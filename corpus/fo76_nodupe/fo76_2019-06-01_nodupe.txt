Complaining? Bragging? Either way, shut up about it or devs will nerf a goid thing. Hardened mass has been mia for 2 months and finally started dropping frequently again since yesterday. I can make flux and shielded marine underarmor again for my vend. These sweet drops are the way fo76 is meant to be. The suffering is over

If your guests are spawning in a weird spot add a few more regular foundations next to that one and they should spawn on one of those

You can purchase new songs in the atom shop! Only 100 per song!

Yeah....you can only lay down 2 mines at a time.

I was trying to type this out, and reddit wants to make sure I’m not a bot.  
---
So I’ve seen groups of 8 or more swarm me. I ran out stims, jumped on a burnt out car, downed a nuka quantum, swung for the fences and took down all these muthurs!!!
---
Was fun!!! Keep up the good work Bethesda!!!!  🤠
---
I only have 1 turret. Since the patch a few patches ago they are MUCH less budget heavy. They used to be like 10% each.
---
Same setup here.
---
what? All the mod plans I can buy are 100% informative of what they are. 
---

---
The ones that aren't are the ones I'm scrapping weapons for. Which makes sense. I can't find those in the wild, I gotta scrap a shit ton of things and figure it out.
---
Plans/recipes. A few select mods. Materials, if I'm in need. Ammo, if I'm in need. Outfits. Weapons. Armor. Canned dog food.
---
I always look through every machine when I travel to a camp. But I generally don't travel to one unless the overview looks promising.
---
Spotify mate, there's a Fallout playlist on there AFAIK?
---
Converge at the camp.
---
Cast out the shadows and scamps.
---
Survive to be champ.
---
Thanks but I ended up finding one in vtu test vault
---
Actually, it started with someone marrying a Radroach, more specifically... a dead one. Roachy. His sad remains are located near the Nuka-Cola facility in Appalachia. There you can find him sitting on a toilet, still wearing that precious necrobeasty marital ring. His story can be seen here...
---

---
Credit due the Polygon YouTube channel and Monster Factory for the content in the link above.
---
He made the move okay, and had been at the CAMP for a few weeks. He just randomly disappeared.
---
I think you're right about servers shutting down when this is happening. I've noticed that also. Thought either it's some sort of bug they haven't been able to correct, so when it happens, they restart the server, or it's somehow just tied in to the server uptime. Neither one makes much sense to me, but I'm with you on that.
---
I think charisma +5 and luck +3.
---
Biv is my absolute favorite of all additions to the game so far.
---
Biv's the name, drinking's the game. And /I/ and in /first/ place, doll.
---
So your saying I shouldn’t have scrapped my 3* Bloodied Pitchfork with SS and something else?
---
didn't they already do this?  a few patches ago?
---
Many monsters
---
Been wondering about the enclave version for a long time, really wish it was
---
Um... how?
---
I've wondered what they were for, myself. Hopefully someone knows.
---
o dang u know what the perk is? 
---
that would be super usefull
---
I gave up on her. Buying stuff from player vendors is way better. Yes, you will need to find a way to make caps and do some server hopping, but results are at least predictable. I decided to switch to bloodied build two days ago and within two days got myself nice 2-star bloodied rifle and full set of unyielding armor. How long would it take to do it via Purveyor? Fuck this bitch.
---
oh ok i didnt know that
---
Maybe there's a female DC out there somewhere and after they have babies you'll find him again.

I was purchasing it from someone else. I’m not level 50 yet so I just wanted to see if it was better to buy it instead of doing the mission.
---
You guys have almost suspiciously cool biology classes

---
Good point.  I usually just go out the door and head to the station since I'm either selling a lot of stuff or scrapping it to put in my stash.
---
hahaha, scared me so bad.
---
Thank you, that’s what I thought. Would have been broken if I had 900 weight and it got reduced to 90, lol.
---
I know a guy that does that. He has 2 xboxes running and logs out the camp with the machines. Meanwhile, a cloaked and crouched hidden character grabs your bag.
---
If you need, I have 5 Nuclear Cards on me at the moment. I'd be more than happy to donate 4 to the cause, for you to distribute as you see fit. Just let me know if you can use em and when for you is conducive to meet up.
---
It's a good idea it might also boost the 76 economy or restore it from the dupeing glitchs that have been breaking it a bit.
---
What about the children? Would they be able to fly like Superman or float like Armstrong?
---
Cryolator is actually pretty easy to make ammo for as it doesn't use that many mats. Flamer fuel definitely needs another fix though. Acid is a right chore to get hold of. I managed to get up to around 3k rounds on a flamer, which took a while, and I used it all at one SBQ fight. Gotta admit it was fun doing it.
---
Cool. I’ll ask around.
---
I assume, hopefully, that everything will cycle back through. I just wish once they cycled out they would be added to the shop for good after a few months. I really really want the camo skin for the hunting rifle, but I missed it.
---
I like the music selection but as has already been asked, where is part 2?
---
Also, perfectly willing to admit that I did not like the selection in New Vegas.
---
That would be real nice, a good tank character, but one that takes more and more damage the more pieces of it's armor is removed instead of just making it one entire bullet sponge hit box.
---
You must have maxed out int!
---
Going to try that.
---
First one that comes to mind is bloody mess. Unless you won’t be doing combat much, I don’t see why you’d turn down a bonus 15%, when maxed out, to all damage (in the luck tree, can’t remember the levels it becomes available).
---
It's a great weapon though it still weighs 8 lbs. Which seems heavy to me for something with 90% reduced weight.
---
I saw one for sale in a vendor for 200 caps ( bargain if you don't have one ).
---
I only listen to background music and whenever I find a radio I switch it off.
---
Having too much fun.
---
Kicked for idling too long.
---
Send help please can't stop.
---
Halloween and witch costume used to be very good. Nowadays i just kill super mutants for weapons.
---
ballistic ammo should sell by 10s by default
---
Doesn’t the perk only apply to the gun and not the added mods though? Thought I read that somewhere. Still, it’s probably broken in some way haha.
---
The way I see it, people will drop their prices when they discover their items aren't selling. 
---
Shouldn't stop you from being a pal and fixing that razorgrain that got shot by the enemies someone spawned in the camp. ;)
---
Cryolators and flamers are better as utility weapons, but if you need acid you should run the Campfire Tales event (the insects drop acid producing junk) and if you need crystal there are a lot of locations that have raw crystal deposits (after one trip around Apalachia to gather them I had more raw crystal than I could smelt and about 500 cryocels to burn through)
---
That is the last word in the sentence so....
---
that does sound really good but i havent put a single thing into luck because they luck perks have always seemed bad to me
---
It's a dirty, filthy, disgusting economy. It needs to be punished.
---
Such a good idea
---
Thanks, that's good shit,
---
That's weird - I usually only end up on servers with aussies and kiwis (am also Aussie). Player tags ending in AU and NZ etc. I see one guy named BloodfartAU often and laugh every time. 
---
I'm happy to team up if u like - GT evansmj. Lvl 242
---
Pack rat- decreases weight of junk by like 90% at full rank- is a must.
---
Everything else, for the most part, is largely determined on the type of player you want to be (melee vs. ballistic vs. energy)
---
My first guess would be around mines but i dont know exactly where
---
Damn Bethesda has us from the start
---
I was able to tame a brahmin today!! I did have to be super close to it. 🙈
---
This right here is why my camp is one of those funny looking ones that's being suspended by a single staircase. Yeah it bugs me but its the only way I've been able to ft to it and not get stuck in my own wall
---
Bulking unwanted junk is fairly good for me
---
I know serums jump from 410-500. And civil war hats was pretty substantial before the nerf. Without unyielding I would say it’s a must at least if your trying to accumulate caps I guess. I honestly didn’t really give a shit about it for the first 30 levels or so.
---
They spawn beside the white Springs station where the mole miners are in their buildings
---
There will never be an update to the music.
---
Shit, I'm on PC...I would have bought it. :(
---
[](/buzzlestia)I've made a habit of buying every junkies weapon that I find for sale. Just in the vein hope that it'll make people sell them instead of scriping them.
---
Third times the charm?
---
It's too time consuming either Run West Tech a couple times or the mole miners with their shotguns and assault rifles
---
Here are some complicating factors which hurt the Endangerol Syringer's reputation:  
---
1) People are shooting low DR trash and saying that it didn't help in the fight. The change in DR from 50-&gt;37.5 really doesn't help your damage and you would be better off just shooting with your main gun than fumbling with the syringer. For the SBQ at max scaling (DR not Health) 300 DR gets dropped to 225 which makes a massive difference for everyone at the fight because its \~30% increase in DPS\* and further hits stacking can lower the DR even more. It is always worth the hassle at SBQBBQ to shoot her with it, for smaller stuff like Fog Crawlers and Mirelurk Queens while solo or small party it is pretty useful as well.   
---
2) Awareness does not always work properly leading to a lot of confusion between people if this debuff works or not. I have noticed it doesn't like to update the DR value while in the same VATS session.   
---
3) The Endangerol Syringer does only work on ballistic resistance and not energy resistance. Currently no anti-armor perks or mods work for energy weapons which is really disappointing. This is a long standing issue with the whole game rather than just the syringer. I am hoping it will be fixed soon...
---
Get the Marine Tactical Helmet plans. It only costs 1 glass, 1 plastic, and 3 rubber to craft and you get about 30c per helmet. With super duper on you get a ton more when you craft them.
---
I mainly go for rare clothes, just scooped up a nice BOS Bomber Jacket for a bargain given how rare it is.
---
The Marine Tactical Helmet (the one that goes with the wetsuit) costs 1 glass, I plastic, and 3 rubber for something that I sell for 31 caps a piece. Plastic and glass can be gotten in huge quantities from Watoga High, though I usually get my rubber from exploring
---
That’s an excellent point. I used to build mine that way for a long time. And guess what? I didn’t get stuck. :)
---
I throw crap in the grinder and put good ones I don't want in my vending machine.
---
Saving 1k scrip then trying it. If I get a nocturnal lead pipe, I come back another day. The legendary purveyor seems to like to give out all her crap all at once.
---
.50 cal needs more mods.   
---
The gatling gun could be more fun if they added something to it, maybe an auto engine that you need some points into science to speed up the fire rate just a tad more then having it hand crank, because real life gatlings fire much more faster than the grandpa arm I'm cranking it with.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Maybe add a fireball optional mod for the flamer since we don't have the incinerator because a long distance fire option would be cool to see.
---
Does anyone know if any of the radio expanding mods for the other FO games work on this one?
---
I've built mine so many different ways and it was only when I make it float do I not get stuck. So I'll float instead of getting stuck
---
Why is that?
---
I still need to get the sausage recipe.
---
Float then fall. Very Wile E. Coyote. Lol
---
This is exactly what I was looking for. Any idea on where to get the plans?
---
It depends on which of the 4 unique versions you're thinking of, the originals aren't.
---
Inside the shack containing the elevator. It should be on a metal shelf directly in front of he elevator shaft, inside an opened blue case with a Vault-Tec logo on it.
---
I want the only light source in my camp to be nuka quantum bottles.
---
There are 4 different Supermutant sources.  Marcus isn't from teh same source as the ones in Bethesda games.
---
Yeah the lumberjack outfit is the only country type thing we’ve gotten, but that was a limited time thing so yeah.
---
Just got a raider chestpiece. Great DR and ER. No mods available for it though sadly. Don’t suppose you’re on Xbox and could mod it for me?
---
I'll have to check if it was automatic.
---
True, but look at games like Rust, or even Minecraft. They have locations around maps possibly bigger than Appalachia. But they all have player built fortresses. I also understand that I shouldn’t use those games as direct examples, but you get the idea. I think if they rest strove to improve their terrible servers, then maybe we could experience the joyous wasteland for once.
---
pc but I got recipe thanks
---
I think I posted about this when it first happened. Maybe on the Bethesda forums. Would love to see it go back to the epic blast.
---
I'm almost certain there is one inside Berkley station where the Purveyor is.
---
There is always one in near  extractor b in black water mine
---
4 different sources.  
---
West coast mutants were initially sterile (you can end F1 with dialog using this) but "get the juices flowing" by Fallout 2.  
---
East Coast mutants are Bethesda creations, they had one flavor created by Westtek supposedly even before teh original Fallout 1 accident made them.  These are in Fallout 76.  Then there's Vault 87's independent creations of Supermutant, and the Institute created their own versions as well.
---
20 hours from your first deposit.
---
I’d use the word “crybaby” instead
---
I’m assuming that’s real time and not in game
---
Yes, real time.
---
The 90% weight reduction, only affects the base weapon. The mod that comes attached isn’t affected by the reduction. So it ways about 8 lbs with the mod and 1.6 lbs without.
---
8 lbs is 3.63 kg
---
Awesome just for reference my GT is; be like JayDee. Lvl 76
---
Ughhhhhh, thanks
---
Not from the sand traps.  They’re only on the greens.  Unrealistic!  Only golf pros survived the apocalypse!!
---
Do you think there is a method there?
---
 I would think to the Purveyor all weapons are the same. It's just us that like this one or hate the other.
---
I have a few good ones but 75% of the time they are weapons I scrap asap.
---
I used my original set of level 30 T-51b PA from level 30 until sometime in the upper 70's when I finally thought to upgrade to a level 50 set. I repaired the level 30 parts back when I first found them prior to hitting level 30. I never had to repair any of it the whole time I was using it.
---
on if you want it
---
Do the mods stack? Like can I have a high capacity fridge bag?
---
I was planning on just going for 1 and calling it, but if I can do multiple I might have to go all out...
---
Haha, good thing I asked! I would have been searching the facility.  
---
  
---
Thank you very much.
---
You may not be able to mod it because you don’t have the mods for that piece. Find mods or create low level pieces and scrap them. That’ll get you mods as well for it.
---
I would do that. Except that raider armor plans are unobtanium so far.
---
I leave mine unlocked as well. sometimes I will build extra extractors I don't really need specifically so other people can loot them if they want.
---
I doubt it. I regularly craft 5.56 in to the 20k region. Sometimes 30k
---
I always get the Arktos lab coat or the Bear Arm weapon.
---
Thanks man!
---
The threshold for ban is a number that you shouldn’t be able to reach through legitimate methods, though if you transfer large amounts of ammo between your characters often then this could trigger the algorithm for a ban
---
Starch genes 2, class freak 3, bloody mess 3 are all must haves. That's 8 points in luck always.
---
I suppose it's relative but when she first popped out of her hole, my friend and I visited her. He got a nocturnal Fatman, I immediately walked up and got 2 nocturnal revolvers.
---
Unless it's a 3 star or has good perks I sell all my legendary gear for 50 caps. If its 3 star and has good rolls the price jumps from 100 - 400. 
---
With my camp being situated in the forest region I keep the price for almost everything low because it's an easy sale to either low level characters or people who are hungry for scrip. 
---
I've already got my load out and every time I've go the the purveyor all I've gotten is 3 * pistols. 
---
I run a heavy gunner in pa so unless we're getting legendary pa effects I'm set for life.
---
I could see defending being fun if I were a stealther and didn't use power armor. to me power armor is fallout though and I really don't like the stealthing mechanics or mini game. If you arent in stealth you can be vats crit if you can be vats criticaled you will die in power armor. if not the first shot usually the second.
---
Oh shoot. I thought you meant you found the plans for the chest piece. 
---
I got you. My bad. Reading comprehension is hard. Lol
---
Revolvers are still pistols. One of those pipe guns is also a pistol. 
---
So that makes 5 pistols!
---
[removed]
---
Nope sorry on PC here .. I would if I could but I can't so I won't :(
---
You should still do the 'mayor for a day' thing. You get other benefits.
---
They just need to introduce Cateye from New Vegas to this game. I'd hate to have it as a mutation. The day time would be so over saturated.
---
no one can see it cause its in your mouth.
---
No prob. Really wish I had the plans for the raider chestpiece.
---
Ha. Nice. Have a great night.
---
Not to mention, having a third appendage would be... "handy". I'll let myself out....
---
That would be cool, they would have other abilities besides having a pip boy for vats. They would even do it the same way eso handled werewolves and vampires
---
It likes it that way.
---
I look for plans I don't know, plans for shadowed leather leg armor for one of my alternate characters, cheap bobbleheads for the use 76 bobbleheads task, and a legendary shishkabab.
---
LOL yup done fd up by inviting the media.
---
Didn't know it shut down?
---
That's what I'm doing though. I'm Mass producing and buying Plasma cartridges on one character and moving them to my secondary. I dunno, if they do ban me they will have a lawsuit wait in for them
---
Make trades capable and scrip them with a purchase, maybe?
---
send them my way ..

I did get a notification from the game that someone was attacking my camp a few weeks ago, and so headed back to my camp and dealt with them accordingly. I forgot if the message was only visible in the map view, or what.  If I see it again I'll take a screenshot.
---
Your welcome sir!
---
I got rid of mine by finding another wanted player - you can't see anyone else.
---
Can’t confirm it’s inaccessible but the last 6 times I’ve tried to access it, it CTD.
---
This occurred over the last 24 hours on XB1
---
Wish it could be higher......  wishful thinking
---
Bro you just posted cringe
---
Nice syringer barrel ideas :) I've also been thinking of some ideas myself.
---
Numbing syringe - continuously damages the limbs, eventually crippling them.
---
Radtoad syringe - the target spawns Radtoad egg mines that damages enemies around it.
---
Bloodbug hormone syringe - spawns bloodbugs that attack the target
---
Nukashine syringe - target gets a massive melee damage buff for 30 seconds, but then it ragdolls
---
It’s not a bug it’s a feature.
---
No, literally it is. They announced it in one the last few patches, they capped out the rewards for killing another player to 1/4(LvL) because of complaints about the 2(LvL) being too costly for players in Survival Mode. This is a large reason of why people with decked out gear and builds started griefing workshops in Adventure Mode, because the cap rewards were better than killing people in Survival.
---
I used to have this problem ( a lot ) in the past but things have settled down quite a bit.
---
It;s rare to bug out now.
---
Vaccine card seriously bro maxed out makes diseases like non existent
---
Well this isn’t a mechanic they intend to happen, I wouldn’t recommend continuing to do it because players have been banned as a result of doing this
---
Yup and each one normally drops 3-5 caps, too.
---
With the exception of word of mouth advertisements are never free but clear only the shop owner would pay it and it wouldn't be required and shoppers would definitely not pay to hear the ads. 
---
I'd be open to any form this takes I'm sure no one is going to implement my little idea its just fun to try and find something that logically fits the world. I guess I'm used to ads so it really doesn't bother me. In in fact for me it makes the world feel more realistic which is how i always like to play any fallout game which is why i have a stealth sniper build because it makes the most practical sense for maximum real life survival than screaming and running head first into a deathclaw with a baseball bat with some nails hammered through it. I understand that other people DO want to play as the super unrealistic melee builds and more power to them its just not me and my suggestions are going to align with my general play philosophy for Fallout. 
---
The map i feel is a horrible place for the info btw. Its overcrowded already, would be different if the game let you filter the map e.g. turn of everything but train stations and workshops, or just have fissure sites would make finding things way less annoying. But as it is i want less on my maps not more. it already feels disconnected from my pipboy where 3 and 4 it felt like it was a function of the pipboy (i think in 3 and 4 it was a tab on the pipboy) this just feels like a secondary bolted on game mechanic that again removes from my immersion
---
Nor did I
---
I need to get this as I get rad worms every single time I run Whitespring. Which makes no sense as I’m always in power armor.
---
Wow.....  I'll check it tonight after work.
---
I think they needed people to jump in with their high level characters to see all the bugs and problems. If everyone started at level 1 it would take forever to see them all. I think they have plans for the future to change things up.
---
Keep talking about it, and they'll increase the mats cost on this one too.
---
I gave up on pets. my first one a sloth got killed by a horde of lowlevel ghouls he should have been able to take with all the turrets around him. the second a deathclaw was just dead when I logged in, so I am done with pets now.
---
I bought it from somebody's vending machine. Got tired of getting nothing from failing campfire tales.
---
Ohh the ones with the swords 🤩🤩
---
p.s i cant even buy the skin i wanted, the whole reason i had atoms in the first place.
---
This sounds sick I'd be down to join depending on the start time, think I even have 6 Keycards to spare.
---
No, fuck no. Nobody likes the idea of seasons. The only reason it gets played a lot is because it’s locked content that you’ll never get again.
---
Smite? The only reason limited time skins are ok is because everyone buys the shit out of them. Because they’ll never get the again. Same with fortnite season passes.
---
Nobody likes those, it’s just limited content so they get them anyway.
---
Seasons work well in diablo 3 because you can get to max level and end game very fast. But if Fallout 76 is going to do survival seasons, (which i think would be absolutely fantastic!) then they would need to make the experience bonus 1000% or maybe more. 
---
But i am totally on board for the idea. I barely play survival mode now, but with seasons, I imagine that would be where i spent 90% of my time. Especially if like diablo, your seasonal character and items could be carried over and shared with your non-seasonal/adventure characters. 
---
Please make this happen Bethesda!
---
We don’t have an exact time yet. Join the discord to stay informed.
---
I would’ve went with the ManBearPig (half man, half bear, half pig) but this is dope 👍
---
Yes they did but it was adjusted again in patch 8 or something to be equal to player level and mam at 50 caps per kill
---
I made a similar post a month ago, was told "i'll look into that", and never heard back. Just saying, don't hold your breath.
---
Well it's the only way I can get ammo for my secondary. But I will start recording every purchase of components and ammo, every crafting session, and every transfer, so if they ban me they will be screwed legally and publicly
---
I second that!
---
no legendary, no mutations and pvp versions of perks
---
Do you use union labor?
---
Weapons I only want with bloodied prefix. If it's a slow and high damage gun like fatman, harpoon gun or what have you, instigating is better but I don't use slow stuff like that. The other effects would be swing speed for melee, vats related perks for weapons. 
---
Armour I only want with unyielding prefix. I have a chameleon with AP refresh that I swap in for pvp. If I could get any roll I wanted on armour it would be unyielding, ap refresh and weapon weight reduction/harder to detect while sneaking
---
Isk, man, those purple nurple twisty hands???!!! 😰
---
I’ve had his happen too! Got a bunch of legendaries off of non legendary ghouls at WS.
---
There are all of two of us at the moment, so there isn't really a need for a Union right this second.
---
this would be on a mouse button for sure, to be used more then the fire button.
---
Dogmeat was in 1, 3 and 4. And made several appearances in 2. All clearly different dogs with the same name. For example in 3 Dogmeat was an Australian Sheppard and in 4 he is a German Sheppard.
---
1.) very nice for only five minutes (just amazing in general)
---
2.) this reminds me of the time where at level 14 I used ALL of my Molotov’s, about two thirds of all of my ammo, and four melee weapons just to kill one of these damn things

My latest version of my CAMP seems to have one bad spawn point and one mediocre spawn point. One is in a pile of rocks that stand waist-high on the ground, so you end up stuck in them waist-high and have to re-fast-travel. The other is on top of a cliff above the CAMP - just tall enough to take some fall damage if you don't hit the top of the resource collector. I need to move the CAMP box a few times and find the sweet spot.
---
As do I. Thank you very much for the offer though. I need plans to MAKE the armor. Either that or the dense mod for the chestpiece.
---
That's RNGesus,  He giveth and he taketh away.
---
My opinion as well. If you're really committed with the last  buff you can save up decently quick by acquiring the two or three workshops that have 3 oil and 3 acid extractors each. I've found you can crank out an okay amount with super duper and ammo smith this way. Observe:
---
3 oil extractors is 45 an hour, same for acid. We'll assume we've got a workshop with 3 harvesters for acid.
---
Counting just for acid, the limiting reagent,
---
You can get 45/10= 4.5 \* 38(ammosmith) \* 1.3(super duper rate) = 222.3 flamer fuel an hour. So really, not too much lol. Based on this I think they should at least make it to where this would net you 500.
---
They are talking about going to said persons profile and blocking them, as opposed to the blocked for session option found in game.
---
I’m going to guess they are tuning the event due to low participation and success rate.
---
Here is what i do :

The public workshop of charleston landfill is bug since the game launch, the big water purifier in there gives 5 bottle each drop, instead of 1, with the 3 differents purifier you can get up to 8 purified bottle each 5 min, ( 5 in the big one, 2 in the regular one, 1 in a little one ) 
---
Just sell 280 of these each day (just get their individual value up to 5caps, with card or charism mentas ) and you get your sweet 1400 caps a day by passive farming.
---
The landfill also have 3 junk extractor, just in case you're missing some junk to sell
---
&gt;According to one guy's selection I browsed, Fluorescent Flux is 2500 a piece...
---
Hahaha...oh wait, he's serious?
---
I've run into a bunch of vendors like that. No, I'm not buying your bulk adhesive for 88 caps, and I'm sure as fuck not spending 162 caps on a plasma core.
---
I think a mutant hound would be cool.
---
Or a feral ghoul for a buttler.
---
Yep- they fly higher than a parade float
---
1k for a serum’s not being a pal ;)
---
I sometimes get QotH still when I travel to or spawn in at my camp in the mire.
---
 I don't use VATS and I don't slot Class Freak as it does not seem to make much difference to my Rifle accuracy. So I'm gonna get by with 5. ;)
---
It's just a load error, I think. I have had this happen with Biv, the taxidermy place, the Purveyor, and I guess Arktos.
---
The only time I had it happen at Arktos the elevator buttons just never rendered in.
---
It usually fixes itself in a couple of minutes.
---
Taming never works for me with lvl 3 animal and 5 charisma, what am I doing wrong?
---
I'm just gonna set this gently right here...
---
[http://fallout.fm/](http://fallout.fm/)
---
Dude i have like 6.
---
That's optimistic. I hope you're right but I'm pretty confident it's just a load error on the client. :(
---
Dude 🤣
---
He wanted your workshop, so he took your workshop... It's part of the game. It gives you a warning for f*ck sake. Quit crying, because it's people like you and your weak ass crew who ruin the game for the REST OF US.
---
Wish i could help but i never used that perk sorry :(
---
I'll be on the lookout for your Willy op
---
Clawdia sadly fell to her death when the game glitched and she "climbed" a power pylon!
---
They have been unable to figure out how people keep finding ways into the dev room. So its ongoing. Most of them get away with it because they use a throw away account to enter the dev room then immediately hand over the goods to an alternate character. Rinse repeat.
---
Preston's great great grandpappy should radio you.
---
Why is this getting any upvotes? It's never been closed since it opened. If you've ever been unable to access the door it's because you just recently logged in and the game hasn't loaded the dlc assets yet, it's the same thing thats can leave Biv's or the legendary exchange boarded up when you log in at either.
---
yeah I do lol. 0 shits given. I don't melee that fist is useless to me and I am already rich enough. so If the in game price is 117 caps then someone would be getting a really good deal. If you buy it just to flip for profit. good for you glad to help, if you buy it because you're melee and want it. that's good too. I don't care one way or the other. I don't do alts to store extra money and gear and my main is at or near 25000 caps most of the time. currently I am at 22 k caps. I only want a three star vampiric laser gat as a possible upgrade but not enough to actively search for one because I'm very happy with it at just a 1 star vamp gat. I don't do regular armor and my power armor sets are all modded up the way I like. for a lot of people enough is never enough for me. I am good where I am at if I rip myself off from time to time that's ok I only need a small income for fast travel money at this point anyway.
---
It has to be a specific creature from a random event zone!
---
I shoot out their knees with a shotgun and punch them to death with a boxing glove.....
---
But then I do that to pretty much everything....
---
True, but do cave crickets deserve to even drop 3star items?
---
&gt;That’s an impressive time, specially solo.
---
Thanks! The variability comes from the fact that sometimes the turrets don't all spawn (saves time taking them out before destroying mainframes in stage 3), and sometimes the mainframe cores take 10-30 seconds to remove and replace in stage 4. I'm pretty sure I could get it to 13-14 minutes if I got a smooth server with minimal turrets  and can replace the mainframe cores quickly.
---
You on xbox?
---
Those limited time items at full price ended up coming back and has a bundle that makes it cheaper than what everyone else paid when it was “limited time”.
---
Look, it’s part of the game. Workshops aren’t that important.
---
'pologies , I will keep a lookout for ya if your on the box.
---
Blackbird never has :)
---
Cass every time I crouch down to get the loot stuck under the table.
---
Yet.....
---
F😕
---
Make a little man cave
---
I also would love to get in on this.
---
Yup I’m on Xbox. Gamertag Omnytrix.
---
 I don't think so. ;)
---
Though I agree with you being a dick move, when you take a workshop it literally does say that you open yourself up to PvP...   
---
It is easier especially for a group to go and clear out places like WV Lumber and similar locations and you can farm more materials in far less time!   
---
WS alone can net you all 1400 caps if you clear that place out!
---
I know their not important, we just claimed it to help my low level character and drop off junk but he killed us before we could deposit it.
---
You do know that a $10-40 new copy of the game is cheaper than a lawsuit right? Threatening a lawsuit just makes you look naive.
---
Right on.
---
they deserve to when theyre marked as a three star legendary lol as all three stara should be
---
I was killed at my workshop but the person let me keep it. I was kind of mad because they were like level 200 something and I was level 70. I guess that’s just how it is sometimes.
---
I'm glad taming has picked up in discussions as I've wanted one for long but refuse to mindlessly server hop for something that'll be dead in less than a week. Here's hoping some changes will be made.
---
sadly its part of the risk of taking a shop. regardless of level if you take a shop you can be ganked. most of the time you wont be but the odd 1% of our community will show up and take it from time to time.  
---
but with the exception of fusion cores and non radiated food there's nothing in a shop you can get easier in the wasteland if you know where to look. look up wanted resources on you tube and try out those places and stay in pacifist mode to completely avoid being ganked. good luck mate.
---
Its douchebag. Just saying.
---
Workshops are legit the place for pvp lmao
---
His reasoning was "desperate people will pay anything".
---
Despite the fact that it's the easiest Flux to get because of Whitesprings.
---
I was on my way to good with salt 3 at level two when I got the refrigerated backpack. With these two together stuff stays fresh for a long time. I know it's a mistake and they will probably fix it but until then cranberry relish lasting 3 days of 6 hour plus game time each day, not bad.
---
I run around WS in my golf outfit to see how many times I can spook someone into hitting me with their supersledge.
---
One of my favs, stop QQing
---
Dammit
---
Take my upvote
---
no, no you shouldn't have ;)
---
Or a cool dlc to explain the guitar sword ...get and ‘ace’ upgrade for one with a flaming effect and a  a death tambo with an explosive effect.
---
Isn't that something like 3 hours a day harvesting water every 5 min?
---
Just finished the event about two hours ago on xbox. No issues. Even completed it with all three animals alive for the first time with only five people. So that was a nice touch.
---
Spoilers: If you seen juice head vid  in lore the robots will have some type of error an you can start the event (Hopely they will add a new mask that's limited)
---
Lol no one knew what it was from. Most of em had played fallout just not 76
---
Yeah I kinda have an obsession with this enemy and everything about it lol
---
That's what i'm hoping too, i'm really pissed about the deathclaw..
---
Spent so much time server hopping for it only for it to be dead within hours...
---
Things like this only happen once in a blue moon
---
Fallout 3 was a masterpiece in the use of the visual medium for storytelling as far as i'm concerned. The level and sound design are so incredibly spot on and blow every other game out of the water. It's just a shame the actual plot is kinda...okay
---
Well there is a unique weapon you can earn each week completing the survival challenge each week. It's a start I suppose. :)
---
It's stage 4 of ghoulism: the irresistible urge to strip naked and party like it's 1999.
---
Me too
---
You just need to use it, not craft it. I actually got the plan but it seems to be super rare drop from all 3 animals surviving
---
the door shut? how?
---
Okay just checked. 3*, 90% reduced weight, bloodied, and reflects 50% melee damage while blocking....
---
Let me know if interested. And what your offer is

Seriously. Such a sad day when my cat was eaten by a wolf. So shortly after my bramin was eaten by a radstag, too
---
I can't even imagine man, but hey at least you made Kotaku! Ask Jason Schreier what he knows about Starfield lol
---
There is a legendary effect that grants breathing underwater and with it you can free up perk points by not needing the card. The guy above you was referring to chameleon armor w/ breathing under water legendary armor
---
It was a good idea. He was calling you smart
---
I don't personally know anyone with the plans, but I've come across two vendors selling them for a deal breaking 200caps a piece. No thanks I'll wait for a fellow comrade to learn it before I pay them prices.
---
Are you kidding? I love those 3 seconds of “hey guys look at me I know where the secret entrance is”
---
Workshops aren't that bad am lvl 70 something and am not scared to go to survive because of high lvl players coming at me and keep spawn killing me
---
I have found that the time doesn't farming materials to craft is more than just killing some duper mutants at West Tek and Harper's ferry. A full clear of both locations takes maybe 30 min and Selling all the weapons clears the 1400 caps. Additionally I get up and usually get a few legendary drops as well.
---
Yeah, just disregard "not happening to me" and "play on Xbox".
---
All of what you describe isn't PS4 exclusive. The friends list/team bug might be PS4. I find that if we figure out who is leader and have them kick everyone, re-join, etc, it works fine. Friends work fine on PC.
---
I play on PC, PS4 Standard, and PS4 Pro. On each one I've had instances where I'm getting killed by invisible enemies, "sleeping" ghouls slide around corners, grass and other textures don't load.... I've had the entire Watoga station never render in.
---
Some cases are probably potato internet on my side - I tried playing during a pretty bad storm a few nights ago and it got weird (even on PC).
---
Mostly it's fine, but there have been some special sessions.
---
I think there's a combination of the game client being extraordinarily bad at retries, but it also seems like I'm getting some janky servers sometimes. I looked at the traffic on my router the other day and I'm getting more connections to West coast servers. I'm in Central. Why?
---
Maybe they tweaked priority or something recently.
---
Still spoils in your gut. At least every time I drink it.
---
Nowhere near as terrifying as [the ones they thought up for Fallout 4.](https://i.imgur.com/TEJh1yF.jpg)
---
I'm a but disappointed they didn't make the cut, but also relieved.
---
Did you just say WiFi?
---
Who plays online games off of Ethernet? RIP.
---
Ya thats exactly my point, they play on a poor connection lol

Steve will be remembered

Another complete-ist here. Need all plans. Need experience with all major builds(all five alts in play with the low woman on the totem pole waiting to get axed when I decide what playstyle I want to try next.) Still haven't gotten around to taming anything yet. Each new toon has a really diff. Experience. I have plans for a hunting lodge I want to build in the hills next to White spring..  I could go on and on.
---
Well I call BS. In any other Fallout game if I saw an enemy (say a deathclaw) I would lay a few mines in front of my position as a defensive measure. The prey inevitably comes toward me we I begin my sniper attack and those mines help, especially since I rarely wear power armor.
---
There’s still bugs and frame issues from BETA in the game. Bethesda cares about money, not quality of products
---
Yep, kill super mutants, scrap lasers for plastic.
---
Nice bro
---
They have talked about doing seasons in the future.
---
This is so sad. Biv play that one about getting shitfaced and waking up in a cart.
---
How long did your cat last? I cant imagine it lasted long because i don't think they have any means of defending their life
---
Cryo is ok for ammo. Flamer is a joke though, and needs some love.
---
Which platform are you on? I can keep my eyes open for it as well.
---
Spell check is your friend. Also, talk about a waste or a nuke.
---
Yas Okkay
---
Thank you.  You're welcome to join us for a bit if you want to.  Just have to give me a few as a friend is introducing me to his trading partner
---
I've seen him 3 times and managed to kill him each time, making for 3 great photos. :)
---
Xbox. Thank you very much.
---
I remember the first time I came across a perfectly fine looking banjo I was able to pick up. So disappointed it wasn't under weapons and I could just aimlessly wander the hills playing mah banjo.
---
I just wish there was more variety, maybe have separated channels for different types of music.
---
One for patriotic songs (I.E. praise the lord and pass the ammunition)
---
one for “pop hits” of the period (butcher Pete, etc)
---
maybe one for some of the New Vegas style songs (Bethesda you added a cowboy revolver, *please* give us Big Iron)
---
You all need the dog pet that can’t die or run away if you build your camp on top of the rocks just south of Delano’s Garage.
---
Are you not just dropping off junk at any stash? Seems kinda situational. Now the light weight stims. That i always have on me.
---
my favorite 🤩
---
Well were did you drop the nuke
---
 Really? 200 caps is ten minutes work, on a bad day.
---
Oh snap, maybe he spoke to soon xD
---
The problem is that acid is precious ( and u need it to make crystals too) its to make about 200 fuel u spend like 100 acid , and u can literally burn 200 fuel in les than a minute of continuous fire ( and we know that flamers arent known by it damage, we spend a lot of time burning the enemy to kill it
---
I really dont think that 500 cryo/fuel is a good amount , maybe for casual players.
---
Dont really think that they re supposed to be used as “utility” weapons , people use this way because it uses a lot of rare resources and i really want to play with a flamer without giving up melt my precious lead ores to make other ammo ...
---
To make like 2000 fuel u’ll spend like 1000 acid , not even doing the event 20 times u should get this amount.
---
I use a BE one regularly now. Sometime I don't hit the vats for some reason,  and by the 4th or 5th round I'm shooting straight up into the air, lol. 
---
It ONLY works good in vats.
---
I came across a vendor doing them for cheaper, bought just enough for the challenge
---
I do, but it still keeps the weight decreased when it is in your stash. When you get to the 700-800 lb weight limit, it will give you extra room. Plus I just throw any extra junk up for sale for 1 cap per junk item. For extra cash.nin case someone needs some extra lead or something.
---
It's for a tadpole badge. Big whoop. Not worth the 600 caps I'd need to spend to check that one off the list. Now if it were for a possum badge....
---
Fictional character?? Should have drawn my dad then
---
I ❤ Strong!
---
You can’t buy it you have to find it or else it won’t count towards the challenge. Check toolboxes and similar containers around cranberry bog or savage divide as well as Scorchbeast guano piles.
---
I know. I'm just fuming. It's just a stupid scenario that I have to ask about this. I do my hardest to play the game as legitimately as possible, and I still feel like I walk on eggshells doing things in game any normal develop er would consider legitimate.
---
It works in your stash?! Thats crazy op if true. Meds weight a ton when they wont sell.
---
Train stations and Red Rockets have stash boxes and a crafting station for scrapping. 
---
Alternatively, one of you fast travel to one of your CAMPs, do what you need, then fast travel back. Then swap roles. No caps spent and you’re still in the same map area as before.
---
Pack Rat doesn't affect the stash. It only affects what you carry.
---
Fuck this guy and his deathclaw, we can all thank him for Kotaku's latest hit piece shitting on the game that I'm not even going to link and give them the pleasure of getting more views.
---
You will still get diseases if you use a lot of chems because of the debuff for resistances but I run what I call a clean build no rads or mutations or chems or alcohol so I rarely see the debuffs except from Radaway and let me tell you if you use it a lot you will still get a disease every now and then
---
It was always special when you came across a power armored raider or gunner in Fo4
---
you knew that no matter how overpowered your own kit was, this guy was tanky enough to stand against you
---
There’s a railcar Midway between watoga station and the NAR repair yard that I’ve seen it spawn at pretty often.
---
 Disease Cure is easy. Perk slots are limited. 
---
 I think all the less weight, less chance etc, are wasting useful slots. Being able to lay down serious smack, saves you from all kinds of problems.
---
Boy's definitely been workin' is core.  
---
That's respectable.
---
I received an initial response on 8th Jan saying to allow 4-6 months for manufacturing and delivery of the bag, and that I would receive 500 complimentary ATOMs in "a couple of days". I didn't actually receive the complimentary ATOMs until 2nd Feb... so 25 days later. Silence since then.
---
If "a couple of days" (which is normally 2-3 days) is actually 25 days then "4-6 months" is actually going to be closer to 50 months.
---
I hope that's not right...
---
Thanks
---
It is what it is bro...imagine my surprise when I laid out my mine trap for the wendigo in his cave only to kill myself because they went off.
---
Not.... us...
---
 I can stand on a car and blow it up. Does not do much to me.
---
 3 Fireproof and a Dense Chest is what makes that possible. ;)
---
Ervy oen herr nedds a spel chekr. Sryosli! Grammar and you need.

Fallout 5 Railroad confirmed! Instead of synth and human it's human and Yao gui.
---
Had this happen when I was trying to invite to team someone in a nuked Whitesprings with three legendaries inbound, but instead exited my power armor and died instantly, being bloodied and all. Words can not describe my annoyance.
---
Average amount of server hops you'd say? I'm a noobie. Haven't tried finding one yet, and other suggestions?
---
I don’t get the non-player ammo vendors at all, especially the machines 
---
who would EVER pay 6 caps for a fusion cell
---
Unfortunately, I have to. I only carry a handful of stimpacks and chems when I'm out and about farming or doing challenges. And not enough people will activate pylons I gotta carry a bunch with me to tank through it.
---
I keep dropping nukes on the queen only to not have enough people show up and fail the event, might even be dropping one tonight (xbox) so I'll let you know! Anyone else who's interested too, we do them pretty regularly
---
Yes the toxic Valley spot is quite popular. I may consider relocating myself. I do miss living in the mire and my new Character finally has some solid guns and perks.
---
More scorched detectors? They're not the same as the tiny geiger-style ones in the mire but that would be my guess
---
What's your gt? Yeah I tried dropping one earlier but not enough people showed up.
---
Which cards lay down the smack?
---
If nothing else it would keep the game fresh.
---
*Seinfeld Theme Starts to Play*
---
I agree wholeheartedly about the lackluster endgame, but the radio has been a major part of every fallout game since 3, and given that this is a game Bethesda wants us to keep playing for "years", eventually the radio needs to get an update. Keep in mind this reddit IS looked at by bethesda and the more the community asks for something the more likely they are to implement it, even if not immediately.
---
Gt is Gwenagin
---
Wifi warriors!
---
For me, Fireproof x 2. Nullifies Scorchbeast attack.  Born Survivor.
---
Game gives ya a marker for the nukacola quantum. Just head to the Nuka factory. And don't take pvp zones if you don't want pvp.
---
do the scorch beast attacks count as fire?
---
Whoops replied to the thread lol, but yeah it's Gwenagin, I also have friends who usually come help out if they're on so we can try and get some numbers
---
True, hope that’s the case. In the meantime I’m not playing until something changes
---
I use t60 when I can't use my X-01(My t60 is like a back up) but ever since I got my X-01 that's the one I use the most. I might start using excavator but I have been doing good for what I have now.
---
Welp that’s sucks! Good thing I don’t need caps and doubt I’ll ever do much better than the stuff I already have.. Definitely learned something though for next time....
---
If you are on xbox, I have extra quantum
---
Start time??
---
Still trying to figure it out. You don’t need to help for the entire duration, but however much you can is appreciated.
---
Sounds like a you problem. And whining.
---
"Hey Todd, the fans want a coop"
---
"Lets open the game up to griefers and hackers and monetize every cosmetic thing we can, got it"
---
I consider people that dupe to be exploiters and exploiters will do ANYTHING to get ahead of other players. If there is a mechanic they can abuse they will abuse it. Its the same reason why they dupe. I'm pretty sure that those dupers who offer items for irl money will abuse the scrip mechanic of having an alt and roll legionaries just because they can and its more efficient. Since there is no other way to consistently roll 3 star in game currently. Why would assume that dupers wouldn't scrip?
---
Mothman Egg Omelets. Base price 38 caps so you can vendor them for up to 10 caps with a high enough Charisma. I can usually get enough to craft about 40 of them, so that’s a good chunk. Only takes about 5-10 minutes to collect and cook. 
---
You can also server hop if you really want.
---
It made it through a few weeks, but I'm sure most of that was luck
---
There's a chance of a single raider armor plan from Signal Strength, but that's it. There is currently no other way of obtaining them. If your character misses out on that plan then you just have to find as many raider armor pieces as possible to scrap. I think safes in Toxic Valley have a pretty good chance.
---
I don't like the idea of three star low levels. Low level crap mobs should be capped at 1 star, middle guys 2 star and only the bigger guns ever get to be 3 star. I feel like it makes the whole term legendary meaningless. They aren't much tougher then regular versions, usually die before they get the legendary regen.
---
Uh, that relates to what part of my arguement? Yeah if you set up a base designed to be attacked it'd be attacked. As for the monetization? Really? It's just reskins. No one needs them, and I've yet to run into a hacker. They aren't a wide spread problem.
---
Yeah the main plot is not incredible but the side stories are amazing. Even the little ones like Agatha’s which creates an entirely new radio station, vampire cult, cannibal town, etc. 
---
Just amazing little moments and yes the atmosphere is incredible. I wish I could replay it right now lol.
---
And he deleted it. God what a cry baby.
---
I want a usable toilet that gives me a small buff after being used. I will be dammed if I don't have working plumbing in my own camp!
---
Do you still have the dress for sale?
---
No, it was closed for a few days at one point right after the patch with the badges opened up. I checked numerous times.
---
I do the same thing. If i get locked in a house, I'm going to shut off EVERYTHING electrical. One guy did that and was silly enough to have his store on a switch inside. Shut that shit down too. DON'T LOCK YOUR DOORS.
---
I did get a sentinel assassin piece off a radrat once :D
---
Turrets
---
I swear I hear “I didn’t kna-hoooowww the gun was loaded”  like 30 times every time I put a decent amount of game time in.
---
You sir at what makes the fallout community have hope for nice gamers
---
Agreed how can I let my fellow brothers &amp; sister now my place is a safe zone.  Ad Victoriam !
---
After the launch of the scout patch it was bugged and you couldn’t get in. It wasn’t a matter of waiting for it to load up, I tried on multiple occasions to get the photos of the cats and couldn’t get in. Saw several other posts mention it being bugged and it was one of the things making scout badges impossible to get.
---
Its good for business!
---
Vats crits to the face owns everyone my friend
---
Oh man that was an amazing tip 
---
I finally completed it the bear yoke was exactly where you said and no stinking scorchbeast to deal with and some of tge urcalite stuff too 
---
Fair play i had spent hours needing just 1 more pic
---
Yeah I know. But I have blocked them permanently not per session. Have tested it. Try it yourself. The block "feature" does not keep you from encountering them again.
---
Cool I'll think about it
---
PSA place your camp in a tree or similar and you can reach up to 9 floors.
---
I'm surprised we're not having a puppers right now.
---
I don’t appreciate you drawing my mom without permission
---
 The smack cards. Weapon + Cards that buff your stuff. Attendant cards that increase damage, Adrenaline Bloody Mess etc etc. 
---
 I have no room at all, for anything else. But then stuff dies fast and I don't get hurt much. Was jumped by a level 80 Scorchbeast at the Harper's Ferry spawn point a day or so ago. It was dumb enough to land and my Executioners 40% Speed Combat Knife finished her is seconds. So fast I was surprised, but I have been filling in the last of my Damage cards. ;)
---
that's all I keep thinking :/
---
What system?
---
I play on xbox and once I block someone, dashboard and restart the game, I never see them again. Just like when I sever hop, I'm actually server hopping.
---
They count as explosions. Hence padded &amp; dense torso mods also work.
---
Great idea!
---
I experienced that today. One ghoul on the parking lot dropped 3 to 5 legendaries at once repeatedly. Only crap but my stash is full now 😁
---
You shouldn’t have to do that, and trees aren’t everywhere
---
I usually have someone else blow me
---
I didn't know it was loaded!
---
I think I have but it only does for a few seconds or minutes.
---
Im just telling you how to solve your problem without having to wait for it to be fixed. Im not saying I dont want bigger camps. Its just not on the priority list now.
---
Rose's Syringer mod works decently, helped me to take down a level 80 Scorchbeast at level 34.
---
As some who plays with an explosive flamer and an explosive cyrolater and an explosive plamsa Gatling. I can say that the flamer is completely unusable with the current ammo crafting amount. I was on an acid deposit while always having multiple worships to produce the fuel needed. The flamer is very weak and requires a lot of fuel to be affective.  This is considering I have an explosive variant which is way better than a standard version. The cyrolater is meh I only use it for SBQ as the damage is trash and ammo is also meh not impossible like the flamer but just annoying and not worth it.  The flamer and cyrolater are heavy weapons and need the ammo production of a heavy weapon. 100 per craft before perks. Make the flamer use 40 steel 5 oil and 5 acid. While the cryolater uses 30 steel 10 crystal and 10 lead. Then it would be inline with the 5mm Gatling gun in terms of ammo and damage output as well as with the .50 Cals damage output to ammo consumption rates. Right now nothing beats the Gatling plamsas damage to ammo consumption rate out of all heavy weapons.
---
Kinda annoying that PC is the only platform with mods.

Calling bull on this I have scraped over a 1,000 raider pieces (my friends helped me find them all) and got mods only. you can't learn to make the part this way.

What would they be spending scrip on when they have infinite of the god tier weapons?

Rifleman

You ever drink a bunch of milk and just feel full? That's why

 Was chatting with a couple of people at the Murmrgh's store just today on PC. 
---
 We were just talking with our mics and its how I like to communicate. I won't direct deal without being able to talk to the person.
---
 I really don't understand the hate for this great tool.
---
I was so pissed after I farmed the 10 rad stingers and found the weapon effectively did zero damage. 
---
Stack that with the fact that shooting animals with it doesn’t correctly count towards badges, and this thing is absolute trash. I completely agree - why did Beth think it was a good idea to highlight this piece of shit? Make it required for several challenges?
---
But thats the consoles fault with its propriety services. Its not a game. Hell they made a half ass attempt to bring popular mods to the console.
---
Same reasons that apple is a pain in the ass to game in general let alone mod.
---
it is funny watching when two pvpers are trying to fight each other and talking shit on area while in chameleon. . that's some high IQ stuff.
---
Adrenal Reaction? Adrenaline was buffing you before and isn't now? You were using ballistic bock before? You have some disease that lowers your damage?
---
The ambient music is actually pretty good. I like to have the radio off sometimes.

I met a fun player and he had no mic. Joined up to get the unique harpoon this week. I dont judge him/her for not wanting to speak. But i just dont understand why all the tools are not available for maximum communication. Seems odd.
---
I think that is partly right. If any player is near your camp then NPCs can be activated.

got a wendigo ghost today, guess I killed her to fast she couldnt pass. 😂 Lagging to the afterlife.

Wait... How do u get the milk? I've "milk Brahmin" thing but i never get milk. Ive been carrying a empty milk bottle with me so next time i get that option i wanted to see if that works.

Hey guys I need attention. Let's all take a minute to thanks the devs for this amazing update!

I play a support build, and I keep a flamer and a couple cryolators on-hand. I spend most of my cryo ammo freezing bosses and most of my flamer fuel on small or fast moving enemies (and bosses when they need some surpressors). I'm sorry that you have such difficulties staying in stock of ammo
---
Cryolaters freeze enemies, no other weapon in the game does this. It's damage is easily surpassable by most other weapons, it has a specialist ammo that's hard to craft: you can try to redefine Utility Weapon but if your strongest argument is that you "really want to play with a flamer" you haven't convinced me. I've been playing support builds since the 90's :~p You're complaining about the rarity of ammunition in a game that provides you with the resources to craft it for yourself, and if you don't like the advice of someone who's been having fun with flamers and cryolators since Fallout 4 then no worries, fellow dweller: I'm passing along advice, you can take it if it works for you or you can leave it if it doesn't. Good luck forcing those support weapons to be your mainstays, and I hope you figure out a way to make your playstyle work within the system of opportunities you've been provided

Glowing Sight maxed out is good in whitesprings nuke zones. With Rifleman perks, I one shot my way through all the bloated glowing ones. 
---
Armorer/Gunsmith for advanced mods. Weapon Artisan is good too just so I don't have to repair weapons as often. 
---
Strong Back plus weight reducing perks since I'm a hoarder.
---
The plasma gun works like this:
---
\- Standard and Bruising stocks count as pistol, all others count as rifle.
---
\- Any barrels with "Automatic" in the name will use the automatic weapon perks. All others use the semi-automatic perks.
---
Plasma flamers use the automatic fire mechanic, but they don't have the WeaponTypeAutomatic keyword, so they use Rifleman or Gunslinger, depending on the stock.
---
THAT SONG SLAPS
---
Its the milk of human kindness that strong  was (will be) looking for.
---
That happens if someone has already milked the cow, or you milk it too quickly apon approach. The cow will moo loudly and kick it's back feet if you rush it for milk.
---
aside from glowing sight ive definitely got all of those lined up to add to my build
---
That's correct. That's just how you have to unlock the mods, because you won't be able to craft them yourself.
---

 Mine is a $20 item and works just fine. When I was younger it was kinda a game to play, well Quake DM and fire texts at each other while fighting. The guy who could do the best messaging, while we were all fighting each other, won that game. ;)
---
 I like the mic. I'm old and talking is good.
---
I think ive had both problems then. One time it had the option but npthing happen the second time it mood and did that kick thing... I did rush it for its milk lol
---
Thank you wise scholar
---
Meh, I've never really found being overencumberd to be much of an issue in this game. It just seems to drain AP quicker.  When I do a junk run, I go through easy areas and don't need to advance to the rear all that quickly. I also have a set of Excavator, but am thinking of stashing it due to the backpack.
---
Now in Skyrim....the speed reduction made it meaningful.
---
Crap..probably shouldn't have said that...dev's may be watching :shiftyeyes:
---
Well, depends on the ammo type.
---
This. All day. I get 28 per helmet. Weights .1 of a pound. I have over 200 in my inventory. Found this out a few days ago. Clear vendors our daily. By far the fastest and easiest cap method
---
Bingo bango bongofuckyourself

Damn that’s great lol
---
Lol @ “bayonets look cool”
---
This is very true.
---
Same. Rad resist needs more % based stats though. As no matter how much rad resist you get it doesnt help in the rad zone. A guy tested with all the rad resist you can stack and he still took 10+ rads a second.
---
&gt;  I think we made a serious dent in the list of player requests and top bugs
---
hahahaha... oh he's serious.
---
Now that Kotaku is linking to this thread in it's latest hit piece maybe it's about time to provide everyone with an update on  this "bug" that was deleting items from peoples inventories.
---
It never existed.  
---
The only issue here, which Bethesda has already addressed in an update since then, was people spamming through their inventories too quickly when selling/scrapping/dropping items.  The game wasn't trashing peoples items, they were doing it all themselves.
---

You lined this whole thread up for that joke no doubt

Goodluck out there brother.

Ad Victoriam!
---
I have the plan and put some on my vendor. 
---
 People usually buy them 3 at a time for the mission.
---
It's a glitch if you repeat the necessary steps on purpose, which I'm sure people do. Like whoever posted the original comment is bragging about how much they can carry using a bug. That sounds just like an exploit, no? Also, I don't care if someone uses that **exploit **, I'm just calling it by its proper name.

Gives it a nice edgy wastelander look, preferably a blade other than a straight up knife

I got one more song to complain about and it’s that Deep South steel guitar one. You know the one.
---
Thats not a valid argument. Thanks for trying.
---
Look it here girl I’ll tell you now they call me Loving Dan.
---
Yes but unfortunately the way they setup the files they can't just hotfix something without creating a several gb update. Which is why we don't often get quick small hotfixes and have to wait for larger patches to get small changes.
---
My pet deathclaw died and I never decided to replace him. He came back to me one day after a random patch but he was reincarnated into a radstag, who also died shortly after :(
---
How do you scrap a legendary? And i though the patch notes said about items disappearing from stash not inventory.

Well more than one fallout character has become a mutie AFTER the war. Wes Tek terminals imply that they just dunked dudes in tanks full of FEV (then neutralized it with some other chemical they dumped in there when the bombs fell). So you’d probably take a serum, or have a whole quest about it.
---
As for Ghouls, Hancock told us in Fo4 that someone gave him some kind of chem, and he woke up as a ghoul the next morning. 
---
4 and NV explained how people could be transferred into robots. 
---
But yeah, definitely a post-reclamation day occurrence.
---
Just make it so legendary effects are disabled.
---
Same with me with the mega sloth i used to own, the radstag lasted a whopping 30 minutes.
---
 "This is part of the game and well within the rules, yet highly unpopular when done against you. Yes, it sucks and possibly a dick move. But I will never let it happen to me. " 
---
this only works if you use stealth all non stealth playstyles are just a vats crit away from death. 
---
 "I like a game that has consequences for my actions "
---
ARK survival evolved pvp hardcore theres little to no consequences for death in 76. in ark hardcore pvp mode you lose everything on death. your character literally dies and ceases to exist all your things are left behind in the world to be looted. you cannot recover and have to start a new character at level 1. if your playing 76 and taking shops for meaningfull pvp you're in the wrong game. 
---
 "I have no right to a workshop. I take it knowing its ramifications. I never take a workshop and then return to my camp. The workshop is my priority and the focus of my actions. " 
---
exactly the opposite of my strategy. I never stay at the workshop. I'm in and out , I then go to other parts of the map while the extractors passively generate items I need. the fusion core generator fills up every 24 minutes. i return at or near that time frame. sometimes I am early sometimes I am late because I don't want to set a pattern. if someone manages to gank me I am annoyed but server hop and I am right back in business in less than 5 minutes. I dont mind the 50 cap donation to the pvp wannabe because I know his character is built around pvp most likely and probably sucks at the rest of the game. I also never go back 1 donation is enough I am not a capfarm. 
---
" I enter into what I call my “hard routine” in which the workshop is my mission, and that mission has priority. Maybe I hunker down in an overwatch position keeping eyes on the shop. I Embrace the Suck because I want the shop and nothing else at that moment. "
---
you do you, I avoid the suck. the suck sucks. shops are to easy to replace on a fresh server. rebuilding on them is easier than putting forth effort or materials in actually defending. bethesda promised no "forced" pvp which means anything you get in a shop you can get in the rest of the game. which also means they will have to have the shops generate enough to keep people interested which means you're better off taking the shop and then going for even more of the same materials you're after in the world. the chances of your shop being taken by a player are small there is no incentive whatsoever for even attempting to defend your shop from another player there is however risk. not much. the death penalty is next to nothing, but going back and trying to defend is usually suicidal for any non stealther in the game. generally you get less downtime in production if you just immediately server hop and rebuild. going back to defend is just wasted time even if you get lucky enough to win.
---
More god tier weapons and armor? They basically can just have never ending legendary rolls whenever they want.
---
It'll never happen, but if it does I'll come back to the game n stop talking shit about it. Take my up vote.
---
As flamer people, I have a few major complaints. I was fortunate enough to find 2: TSE flamers. One with reload speed, one + perception. I can break them both with less than 2 reloads each. Less than 800 rounds total. Less than a minute of sustained fire.
---
I spend a half hour harvesting 80 oil, not even considering the acid, I get less than a sheepsquatch worth of ammo for a half hours work. I know, because I broke them both on a sheepsquatch and still had to finish it with a gattling gun. Yes, I'm using heavy weapon perks. 15 points of them.
---
Limited by stash size! Specialize yourself in one but not all useful things. Bulk scrapped junk, Flux, Fusion cores(full), Ammo, Weapons: Bloodied, Apparel: Shielded Underarmor, Aid: inert flux for drinking, ionized meat for eating, Diluted stimpaks ... Only the good shit. Use your skills that you've learned from rare plans to craft and specialize in these. I specialize in gathering and crafting Stable Flux. Crafting Shielded marine underarmor!

I tried to do the same, poor girl was cannon fodder so I took her to adventure for a few levels. Will go back when shes a little sturdier
---
They've kept mentioning display cases, and the more they talk about it, the more it sounds like we'll only be able to use items from our stash box in these designated "display cases", and not just put items wherever we please. They've only specifically mentioned putting magazines on magazine racks, display bobbleheads, weapons on weapon racks, and etc (we might be getting the ability to put items on shelves at least... hopefully... perhaps even new shelves? And I think we're also getting legit display cases as well as they were found in the files before they even mentioned the word "display cases"). I at least hope we'll be able to use tables as "display cases" so I can put bottles, cups, bows, and etc on them. I'd be fine with that if it means I can't put junk on the floor.
---
Only if she will take all my duplicate cards.
---
Nice, I love forgotten weapons!
---
Agreed. I’ve been carrying around garbage rifle for way too long simply because it has a bayonet.

Regarding everything else in your nicely detailed post; I haven’t been playing long to really comment on anything beyond my agreement that bayonets are awesome and more melee mods would be cool.

All the ammo in the world wouldn't change the fact that the cryolator damage is almost non existent.
---
I have 78 if you need them still I'll drop them. IGN: Churchasis
---
[](/celicane)76 has a player vendor system where you set up an automated kiosk at your camp to sell items to players, placing the kiosk allows players to see a generalized idea of what you have(How many weapons, meds, armor, etc), and allows them to fast travel to your camp.
---
Yeah, but that song makes me want to suddenly kill dozens of Raiders, Pete makes me think he has a masturbation problem.
---
when private or sharable servers come out the adventure mode is going to be as empty as survival mode. pvpers will figure someway to grief on the non pvp and private servers as well. they always do. 
---
on to your point about hiding your camp and not running vendors. thats exactly opposite of what most fallout players want. they got 76 to rebuild america not hide and gank each other.
---
It's not just scrapping, before they added the warning for favorited items along with other tweaks for this specific problem you could just as easily be spam selling junk weapons to a vendor and never notice selling a legendary weapon.
---
I have my store on a switch for the days I don’t want my store open to the public.
---
Yeah.
---
I got the +10 from Lead Lined.
---
Although I have not tried "as of late", may do when I log in later.
---
There are a ton of weapons they could add that were seen in the previous games.  I personally want to see the Shoulder Mounted Machine Gun return among other things.  The Chinese Assault Rifle and R91 Assault Rifle would be popular I imagine.
---
Or just let us sell them in our vendor shops
---
It would have to be cosmetic only, so maybe we could reskin something we take. Tame a deathclaw? You could make it albino. Have a dog? Well we could have a load of breeds to team in it in the atom store.
---
I just turn off the radio and turn on Pandora and set it to "Cab Calloway" has all the fallout songs as well as a bunch of of classics. Helps broaden the gameplay.
---
If they're the junky-looking radio tower things, there's a quest called "It's A Trap" that can spawn near them that has you kill a grounded Scorchbeast - lore-wise, those towers can emit a signal that forces them to land. It's a quick quest and easy exp/loot
---
Interesting!!
---
no its all good  i don't need caps  just good armor.
---
i need heavy combat armor with weight reduction. i can donote multiple TSE weapons to your cause
---
Im old too. I utilize my mic except when i get off of work at 2 am... Or when the family is roaming around. Just the first game iv played in years with no chat. Even fps games have a chat. I get that typing is not a big deal to console players but the option is there.
---
We need power armor scorched in the mire.  They could have those vines growing out of their armor.
---
If somebody replies to my comment (please do), I'll remember to read this when I wake up in the morning :)

I run through the mole miners collecting everything includeing the meat dosent take that long and im usually at the limit or close to it then i go play and see what else comes up 
---
Im at 20000c now i freaked out a little while ago when i didnt have enough to fast travel 
---
I quickly copped on to how selling the guns nd junk work 
---
Also selling intact objects with out junking works for me
---
Acid is precious?  There are spots where you can server hop and log in on top of enemies that provide 9-12 acid in under a minute.
---
In their defense, cats can fall from any height and won't die. At least in FO4 because I tested it :-)
---
Thank you, bot.

---
I never ever turn on the pipboy radio. People actually listen to it?
---
Yea I agree it just shouldn’t be a entire process to be able to shoot your gun lol
---
Because what will really get Bethesda's attention is a new Kotaku hit piece, especially one dredging up the "bug" of items mysteriously disappearing from peoples inventories that ended up just being idiots spamming to fast at vendors and selling their legendary gear and was already addressed weeks ago.
---
Sorry to go off topic a bit but was ShowHealth Redux making you exit vendor screens unexpectedly and at random? or was it doing something else? Because that's been happening to me a lot and now I wonder if that mod is causing it.
---
It only affects the visible number on junk in your stash, it does not reduce weight of stored junk.
---
Other then helmlock hiles which ones got 3 acid nodes?
---
I got one from One Violent Night about Decemberish. Sturdy Raider Arms
---
They had powered elevators in fo4.
---
With the mods plans now available for purchase from the Enclave vendor, the X-01 with calibrated shocks outclasses the Excavator easily. With the perk that lowers the weight of PA parts, you only need to build two X-01 torsos, one with the jetpack, and one with motion assist and swap them out instead of having two full suits on you.
---
My opinion is just use X-01 all the time and swap the torso pieces.
---
thanks. I will login and get it when you're on!
---
Don't feed the troll. 😝
---
They do this with intention, those limited offers to do pressure on you and if you didn't grind the atoms you need for purchasing, but you want a skin really hard, you have to invest real money to get it.
---
Do Bog Town claim or defense. Consistent unless claimed
---
\*finger guns emote\*
---
I was blocked by being solo in my herd mentality from being able to share a perk card. I guess I just assumed it made all the difference rather than spent points. My mistake!
---
IF they weren't worthless. 50% of the time e they just ignore enemies until you the player take dmg.
---
Link doesnt work
---
This is going to sound like ritualistic mumbo-jumbo but I guess you have nothing to lose?
---
Many moons ago a glitch was introduced that would cause being stuck in an infinite loading screen upon 'logging into the world' if you had previously logged out wearing any +carry weight items and you would be encumbered without them.
---
The only way I could get around the problem - which fortunately was patched - was to log in with a different character and play a bit with it first. After that I could log in again with my 'main'.
---
On a more sane note you mentioned a fresh install. Did you manually delete/verify that when you uninstalled the game it deleted the My Games/Fallout 76 folder?
---
Even if it did it would not be amiss that you deleted the contents of that folder again.
---
Tbe relevant ini files will be recreated upon first launch.

---
I do the same thing too. I just hope I dont run into something spawning and trapping myself anyways.
---
 If it were a more efficient system to exploit I'm sure they would.  I agree with you there.
---
I want a boss supermutant in power armor. Like some hulk buster level shit.
---
I didn't get locked into a house, but I fast traveled to someone's house and landed between two concrete stairs. Because I'm in Excavator PA just to be able to fast travel, I couldn't move. I was stuck between the stairs until I fast traveled to the closest point and ran back again (through a swamp that had a Mirelurk Queen in it, which was fun). Out of power armor I could get out of the stairs, but while in it I was trapped.
---
Cut the power to your vendors - this way your camp doesnt show up as a shop and people wont waste time and caps trying to check out your vendor. you can put in a switch but players will just turn them off sometimes so if I want to shut down my shop I just delete the primary power cable in build mode. if you are in passive mode your shop is invulnerable so really locked doors are kind of silly.

I've killed two 3 star ghouls in watoga high school and have gotten drill and a syringe and the other day I killed 2 3 stars in white springs and one drop a 3 star pipe gun  (trash btw) and the other drop two legendary items and one was a 1 star and the other was 3 star armor both trash but my point is this game is nuts with legendaries.
---
PM me your gamertag!!
---
The problem with the ultracite set is a lack of easy to obtain mods. I don't think the ultracite set has a jetpack, and I haven't seen a calibrated shock mod in my 150 levels of play time spent farming the sb queen and I'm beginning to think it is a myth.
---
Out of all the things power armor does, in nuke zones the single most important thing is carry weight for legendaries, Flux, hardened mass, glowing mass and high radiation fluids for making stable Flux. For that reason alone, I think the ultracite set is inferior even to the excavator set.
---
My only build is a heavy weapons PA user, so I always have the power user, batteries included, stabilizer and one man army perks. I also use the perk that reduces power armor weight but I forget what that is called.
---
I think with power armor you have to commit to that being the main build.
---
On the plus side, you can play 2 and then run back, and remote detonate those 2 when you drop a 3rd. the 3rd won't blow, just the first one, and if it's close enough to the second, it'll blow the second as well
---
When you arrive to a boom it usually means it was destroyed before you got there. My fusion generator got busted and it would make that noise every time I came back to camp till I got around to fixing it. I was out of nuclear material somehow and that stuff is annoying to find on short notice.
---
This is a golden idea. The duplicates do nothing for us if we're not planning to max a card out and after all we DID already earn it through gameplay. If a player can't rank s card past the category max; card's just clutter.
---
If Beth's not planning on giving us card builds that we can switch out according to situation; I hope Bethesda really considers the OP's Idea.
---
An Assault Shotgun. 
---
Fires as fast as the assault rifle with high recoil and low range.
---
For when you absolutely need to make the thing directly in front of you 110% dead.

Would make sense if Bethesda added this in as a nod back to this.
---
Any silencer by any chance

If they were smart they would work out a deal with Spotify for a integration in future Fallouts.

It does state it blocks for the session. So once you log they see you again. I've had more then a few trolls that I've had to block via Xbox live. But ur on PC so that doesn't help :(

---
It should be like the thumbs up emote, but replace the thumbs up with a middle finger.

Where's the pepperoni rolls?
---
Yeah, getting to open a new pack of cards isn't fun anymore once you get to a higher level. "Oh, I got another one of those? That's three now I think. Yay..."
---
Yeah but what about all the dupes you get from card packs? Those won’t do you any good
---
Saw one of those down country roads.
---
Also, why is Morgantown flat?
---
Spotify is trash though
---
One syringer barrel I'm actually surprised doesn't already exist is one that would ground a scorchedbeast. C'mon Bethesda if you put in a dragon like creature, put in a dragonrend like mechanic.
---
often over looked but massively usefull is the green thumb perk. for 1 perk card you can easily pick 600 caps worth of flowers and vegetables between vault 76 and billings homestead in 30 minutes. if you combine that with all the other stuff you pick up along the way you're  capped out at the vendor really fast. even at level 4. 1400 in less than an hour if you do it right. 
---
 if you pick the red and blue flowers from 76 all the way to hillfolk hotdogs you can be at 50 to 100 healing salves which allow you to heal tank your way through any obstacles while leveling. 
---
green thumb is avaidible at level 4 and is excellent for early and mid game .
---
Nope, it's all I hear and legitimately had to google if someone back in the 40s was *that* risque.
---
Only if we can pick which cards instead of just all the dupes. I use different ranks of damage perks depending on how encumbered I am, for example. Sometimes I shave a rank of each damage perk under strength to slot in pack rat or bandolier or whatnot. Likewise with Int.
---
If a vendor see someone coming their way that has a load of caps they'll just raise the prices in their machines.
---
i struggle with caps a lot so that sounds great thanks for the tip
---
Animal spawns are separate from enemy spawns. Areas with peaceful animal spawns can still have enemy spawns that are high level. You have to choose camp spots based on what sort of enemies can spawn for high level players in that area. So the safe spots are pretty much in the forest and maybe the toxic region. Whitesprings is only a safe spot if you camp close to a guard point so the bots protect your camp and draw aggro from any mobs. There's tactics that exist already to solve this issue, no need for them to fix anything.
---
Very possible. I was struck by how similar the rubble in this picture looks compared to parts of Charleston.
---
No, they don’t stack but it is really useful to carry two or three bags and hot swap to what you need.
---
Are you PS4 or xbox?
---
Even that is a bug, though. 
---
Select an item, try to sell it, and if you've moved your cursor over another item in the process that item gets sold instead. 
---
Mouseover a random 10mm, hit spacebar to sell, move the mouse over your TSE rifle and all of a sudden that's being sold instead with no indication until it's done and over with. Even if you catch it before leaving the vendor, buying it back from the vendor is going to cost significantly more than you received for it. 
---
You can try it in your vending machine risk-free, as you can just unlist the item after or set an extremely high selling price. The same bug exists there.
---
Xbox
---
I only wish The Fog Gets to You returned, love that track.
---
I found a flyer in a suit case in the game promoting seeing jesco white the dancing outlaw.. ever get to see him around? I got to hang with the whole family one night it was pretty wild
---
milk makes for stronk bones
---
I'd sell 10 rounds of .38 ammo for 1 cap if I could.

Wear unyeiding armor +15 int for 5 pieces
---
They’re such a hidden secret so we hide them in the mountains
---
Imagine having to be the one to write that article. Like there was literally nothing better to write about.
---
They have things like the atom bomb!
---
Thanks, but im busy right now
---
How much lead did you have?
---
Bummer, The games sounds fun, I'm on PS4. I like when people put some of their own creativity into the game.
---
I want videos!
---
Yeah, I didn’t buy all of the workshops, and that was one of them. I got the idea from watching some old fallout 4 building videos where they had elevators and made cool towers, underground shafts, etc. with the rustic lift. It wouldn’t be real hard to just transfer the model and reprogram it over to fo76, right?
---
On ps4 I have some
---
Unfortunately lead wasn't a by-product of the any of the scrapped weapons. It was all assault rifles, laser rifles, and melee gear!
---
What are you playing on? PC?
---
/r/GalaxyNewsRadio is a sub that features fallout-esque songs
---
Some people use this to their advantage. If you set up a well guarded shop right in a high level area where legendary creatures regularly spawn and stay there when your machines are powered up you have essentially built yourself a legendary factory to stock your shop with.
---
What on earth is wrong with you, man?  "People willingly paying for a resource are being taken advantage of" were you dropped on  your head as a baby or something?
---
A heavy gunner should be using Power Armor. Stabilized is a keystone skill for heavy gunners.
---
Power armor provides a ton of DR/ER, almost as much. It also has a hidden \~45% damage reduction effect that is always active, unlike Sentinel or Cavalier, which only work under certain situations and then only 75% of the time. Emergency protocols gives you another 50% damage reduction. You can't touch that in PVE. Add in the radiation resistance that PA provides, and it's absurd to use normal armor with HW, at least if you are thinking with a combat focus in mind. HW do not work well with VATS, so Unyielding armor is a poor choice, and makes you vastly more vulnerable. 
---
Embrace the HW/PA dream team. It works. Very well.
---
Armor mod is best
---
In real life Morgantown is more or so defined by rolling hills rather then mountains you’d find towards the Southern and Central parts of the state. Morgantown’s geography is quite close to Pennsylvania’s due to their close proximity.
---
What's with the down votes here? I ended up switching to the classical station.
---
I just want what we had in Fo4. Elevators, the balcony walls, concrete buildings, scaffolding, smaller stairs, etc. Don’t get me wrong I like all of the new things that have been introduced as well in 76 and I’m sure there’s some sort of data/performance limitations but the stairs are frustrating in 76.
---
Lol sorry I was being facetious.  I grew up outside of Frederick MD, worked as a raft guide in Harper's Ferry, went to WVU.  I was commenting on how poorly they did Morgantown.
---
Good to know in case I ever switch up my mutations.
---
I made a mistake and said that I liked all the other songs and that was too broad of a statement.
---
Yeah, I really miss making all of those cool things. If only we could at least try to do the same. We need concrete walls, regardless. The servers may be able to be improved, and I sure hope they are.
---
Poor Steve.
---
I'm glad he's getting nationally recognized and Bethesda is being brought into light for their digital animal cruelty
---
The easiest way is to buy low sell high. If you learn the market, you can find crazy deals in other peoples vendor. I bought a lvl 50 bos uny sentinel powered piece in a shop for 100 caps. I also buy rare outfits for 100 to 200 caps.
---
Says the guy that probably only uses vats to secure a kill
---
No I haven’t gotten the pleasure sadly :( If you like idiots from West Virginia you should experience the “rough n rowdy” in Welch every year, I think they do it in different places now but Welch was the birthplace of it. Idiots and rednecks from all over the state come to beat the shit out of each other lol
---
I have a bunch of water purifiers at my place and I just sell whatever I don’t need. It sounds silly but I also have a bunch of endurance and luck perks so I end up an excess of food and water which I sell to vendors. You can also farm legendaries and sell the weapons to other players!
---
is 10 people good ?, i have no idea if that's good or bad
---
Alright thanks brother
---
Ahh. I thought it was due to the "obviously". 
---
I usually love the music in the Fallout games but I found the music from 76 to be distracting.
---
I am on PC and I have a 3* launcher with double shot, really fun to use
---
Alright thank you brother
---
Yea that that's what's I was trying to do in the early days of the game when I realised it didn't add up correctly .
---
Once that guy tried it I thought to myself it didn't sound right for the rads gained so I tried it again with a different set of gear and the rad resist numbers still didn't add up and yea. Still didn't help in a nuke zone.
---
If it ever free on playstation + I'll end up doing it there too so maybe one day you'll come across it. :) 
---
I wish you could play it too though, I hate that everything isn't cross platform yet
---
Depends on level, but uranium fever is a good place to start, kill all &amp; then sell the lot at the vendor
---
Another way is visit other peoples vendors &amp; look for bargains, I only normally find one per day, but one of my latest was a piece of armor for 1.2k that I could easily sell for over 10k, but ended trading it for an unyielding sentinel piece.
---
Or look on here for when people are selling seruns for 150caps, sell in your vendor for 300 or sell each day to robot vendor
---
What kind of armor does it give u what kind of perks and is there a video on this?
---
I bought about 30 serums for 100 caps each and resold them for 350 caps each and someone bought them all about 10 minutes later.
---
LOL
---
How much of a problem are scorched beasts?
---
Ohhh yeah sorry I thought you were being serious lol. Bethesda did do poorly with Morgantown. They did poorly with Clarksburg too  imo. I didn’t expect Welch to look realistic at all but being a shitty crater pretty much is how it look in real life too lol
---
Farm whitesprings for 1* legendary stuff and sell them for 20 caps each.
---
This is a great idea!
---
just put 5 big one, each 5 min they drop 5 water so come around every 30 min, but yea for 2-3h of "passiv farming"
---
unfortunetly there is no miracle solution, but that one is the one i found less annoying
---
when i log on i take the workshop and i just have to pass around every half a hour
---
and if you manage to put the sell price higher than 5 you're dimituting by far the amount of time necessary 
---
5 caps for a bottle is the standar 4 charisma + hard bargain + mentas, but there surely is a way to bring water to 6 or 7 caps each with drink food underarmor high charisma and such !
---
Terrible. Every day when I wake up and go and try to get my pepperoni rolls and Mountain Dew I have to fight off Scorched beasts and my local meth heads lol
---
You’re simply charging dumb rates for probably the most common ammo type in the game. I didn’t call you the devil I’m just saying 1 cap per shell is dumb. There’s a few people who may buy that for convenience and then a ton of people who I’m sure don’t realize how much of a scam that really is. After a day you really should’ve let this go
---
I have to admit I am very impressed with Harper's Ferry.  I have my camp up on Maryland Heights and the view is just spot on.
---
They drop from high level enemies, or enemies that drop heavy weapons like Deathclaws or Honeybeasts. The easiest way might be to find a legendary in a player's vending machine though
---
 Any Chameleon Armour involved here? Crouched it blurs all scopes but the Night Vision ones.
---
Literally the only reason I have it on my Handmade
---
green thumb perk at level 4 will net you around 600 caps in plants alone if you pick every flower and crop between vault 76 and billings homestead. it takes about 30 minutes. I still use it at level 240 242? 248? anyway at a very high level when its time to get my daily cap out the vendor thing on I just pick every plant and not bolted down thing from vault 76 to billings homestead. billings homestead alone counts for 400 of those caps just in corn and razorgrain. add in misc junk meat weapons from spawn and I am capped out in 30 minutes to an hour. 
---
you can get capped out faster at higher levels by farming west tek and or the blackwater mines near white spring but often players are already there and have killed the spawn. plants generate for the player individually. 
---
if you combine that with pharma farmer and the double meat meat perks you can really get the time to max cap down super fast, plus stock your vendor and keep selling etc.
---
low to mid level green thumb is definately my recommended perk.
---
It’s just some forced depth of field and it is absolutely horrendous
---
 Its maybe 1500 at the Enclave window, so probably not. ;)
---
u/ladydevann can maybe swing this past someone for the sake of my eyes
---
PS4 here, so sending you the best of luck!
---
Only time I crank it out is to slow the sbq
---
Great I'll add you back once I'm on, couldn't get on tonight but probs Sunday should be doing a nuke
---
Selling wise maybe 1k at most
---
This is some funny shit. Can't wait for the next episode!
---
Same
---
Low key dawg I’m trashed and you’re probably right. Point is I hate butcher Pete with every ounce of my being.
---
That reminds me, I have a nice stockpile of adhesive, I should use my crops to make more and sell.
---
Um I really don’t have the much caps so I was gonna buy it for cheap so yeah
---
Minus legendaries, as I think they are under valued, I price everything under the listed value. Some folks just approach a free market with high egos and no understanding of supply and demand.
---
Indeed
---
what bugs are you hoping get fixed?
---
what are you worried might break?
---
I have to agree with you, it does look very great. Harpers Ferry is honestly a very underrated tourist destination. I’d recommend anyone visiting it at least once in their lives
---
For sure
---
Bloodied explosive Gatling gun and i use the extra damage  towards glowing perk when i enter nuke zone

---
Holy shit "Rough n Rowdy" needs to be an event. Prerequisite to get in you have to be hammered to participate.
---
Is there a difference between the enclave and regular version?
---
Was farming workshops all day had all three power plants(selling fusion cores), the ammo factory, and the acid place in the toxic valley. Decided to launch a nuke to get some flux but get encumbered halfway through. Die and have to quit the server becaus3 I cant spawn.
---
Yes they're both bugs, but they're still not the same bug.  The claims of mysteriously disappearing items both put 100% of the blame on Bethesda AND stoked the fear that at any time anyone could log in to find their favorite legendary weapon was gone.  But that's not what happened.  People just weren't paying attention to when they trashed their own stuff.  But people don't want to admit that the fault might partially lay with them so they concoct these conspiracy theories that then get picked up by crank sites like Kotaku.
---
Which weapons and what percentage range are you seeing? Also, your per and agi help with vats, plus there are vat things on power armor
---
You like your games broken?

---
The snalygaster in the swamp ?? , i really think  when u need to server hop like 10 times at least,to get a good amount of stuff show how bad the things are.
---
Server hop is a solution but is like a troubleshooting .... u ‘ll spend a lot of time in loading to do exactly the same thing over and over again to get 12-21 acid
---
If u think that spend 10 acid for 20 ammo is ok good for u. 
---
But i was saying that people really use acid for a lot of things like melting ores , making gunpowder ... 
---
imo isnt a good deal spend 10 acid for 20 ammo that lasts less than 5 seconds of ammo. If i was like 5 acid per 80 ammo and the fuel consume was decreased in 50%  it would be nice and the game wont be broken like the laser weapons broked the metagame.
---
I could make a lot of bullets with that much steel
---
My weapon disappeared from my inventory between logins in my camp. Sont see how that makes me an idiot
---
It hadn’t finished loading yet or you needed to reboot.
---
Do you not have enough points for the perks to keep guns from breaking? 5int  points I think, isnt it?
---
Thats the thing I've tested my range but I can't even swing my weapon when I'm in vats. This has been on going for a month so ive decided its not oporator error lol
---
Yeah for sure! Explosive weapons just break faster. Especially TSE. Plus they tend to bow up cars and that makes bodies hard to find. Just want to rely on TSE less.
---
It would be cool if they just created a separate mini app messenger that launches with the game so you can chat with players in your server but they don’t have to bake it into the game or gui. Similar to how steam handles chats
---
You can farm oil and acid faster by server-hop killing the two Grafton Monsters and Snallygasters in Charleston.
---
You managed to inspect the gun but not pick it up in time?
---
We’re planning to bring Fallout 76 offline across all platforms around 11:00 a.m. EDT on Monday, June 3, in order to implement some backend service updates. We are not making any gameplay changes, so there will be no patch notes following this downtime.
---
Hopefully stability actually finally
---
I have the same issue. I have a video saved on my system of my trying to kill a blood bloodbug. I took 9 swings while in vats. Each one was a whiff while right on top of him. I notice the most trouble with flying enemies it happens often with them. Other creatures it's only a little here and there. 
---
I stopped using vats almost all together while using my melee setup. I switched my perks up to have max AP points. So I can run and separate any mobs. Then I just do a running power attack to each baddie.
---
Melee vats is like 1 maybe two swings. I'm 100% melee in white springs and I go mostly manual (is it called manual without vats? Ha).
---
Right as i inspected it the game crashed before i could collect it
---
Ghoul slayer would be great, if going that route.
---
Got Luck of The Draw? My Two shot explosive gatling rarely breaks even on a max time SBQ.
---
I just want a plan for a mouth harp.
---
That I don’t have. Keep my luck pretty low. I could mix some stuff around for that to try out. Good call
---
Do uranium fever. Pick up everything. Literally everything. Don’t scrap any of it. Pick up more as you walk out of the mine. Pick up more in the outside area. Haul your 1200 lb self down to Whitespring station and sell all of it. Should net you around 800 caps.
---
Man am I glad I'm not crazy, I have noticed it's normally on smaller enemies. That's a pretty good idea, I regret using vats perks and because of this terror ive gotten rid of so many melee weapons..lol
---
And i know its probaly not the devs fault its likely corporate giving them deadlines they cant realisticaly meet.
---
Pretty sure it's a fluke. The mods are all still 0.45 or 0.65% chance.
---
Have you read the lore behind what the snallygaster is what it originated from?
---
Only worth it if maxed just so you know - it doesn't work super often, but with the full upgrade it repairs it pretty much all the way when it does. The lower two don't repair enough to make it worth it.
---
I see him all the time too and The Fonz
---
Definitely farming enemy weapons and selling them to vendors. West Tek and blackwater mines are both great for it. Also, extra nuked flora sells pretty decent at vendors as well. I agree with checking player vendors too...I once found a max lvl TSE Handmade for 400 caps. Bought that sucker up quick. Could have easily sold it for 10k caps probably but ended up doing some trading with it for the responder firefighter set. You'd be surprised what you can find in vending machines.
---
Awesome. Thank you.
---
Just to confirm, the "alien" in the back of the truck didn't work either.
---
Bye
---
Thank you brother
---
Suprised no one mentioned serums, they sell for 400+ each and only takes a few minutes a week to make enough for the vendor, and they still sell well in player vendors too. Great end game cap generator.
---
Good to know! Thanks!
---
That plastic though my lawd I'll be dreaming of that
---
I don't have any of the recipes. Don't you have to buy them at the enclave?
---
The Wanderer
---
Yea 18k each, but once you get to max caps, need something to spend it on.
---
Giving it a chance to what?
---
Not enclave, science lab. No commendation necessary
---
Yeah it's a pretty fun way to play. I keep running man, action boy and another perk (can't remember) maxed. My character is very fast. I play in no armor what so ever. I can bounce around large groups of high level ghouls or scorched pretty quickly. Level 65 scorched champions or charred ghouls are 2 shot everytime with my measly 1 star meat hook. If I'm drugged or happen to get to them fast enough before going from caution to danger it's always a 1 shot kill. which in full sprint one on one I can surprise attack just about anything before they know I'm there. With a running surprise power attack on a high level glowing deathclaw I can usually do a 1/3 to a 1/2 of its life in one shot.
---
There are times where I have my power fist on and I use vats and I hit RT and nothing happens. I'm just aimlessly starting at an enemy. 
---
It happens every now and again. Is it frustrating, sure, but I thoroughly enjoy the game and deal. 
---
Best of luck, bud.
---
I always dump them on an alt or buy a good weapon. I have 50kish caps spread through my alts. Recipes seem like a good investment.
---
It's nice to be able to take them to get rid of the negative for a while too.
---
They don't stack?
---
Jesco White, great but sad documentary movie. I seent it
---
I got 90 or so on my main lol, just the fact that they should burn so fast when using VATS, but props for the shameless self promotion 😁
---
Idk I dont think I could live without marsupial and adrenal reaction
---
sniper scopes did actually exist for black powder rifles, most notably the British-made [Whitworth sniper rifle.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitworth_rifle)
---
I think the enclave version does a little more damage but im not sure. It does have a cool black finish to it with the enclave logo though.

You can just take another marsupial serum and get your 4 strength back for an hour or so. Etc
---
No negative effects from serums for the first hour
---
I feel you. Was in the same situation earlier . Dont know how often/much you play but take a break for a while . I did that and found the game better again after about a month . This game will never be fixed bc bugthesda breaks more than they fix after every patch . But in my case its fallout and i like these kind of games too much 
---
But a longer time away atleast cools you down . Did for me atleast
---
That would honestly be one of the most accurate parts of the game. Half of the guys I went to high school with participated in the Rough n' Rowdy like it was some rite of passage XD
---
Lol funnily enough as soon as i posted this, i went to camp adams to see if there were any smores lying around, when that event started, which i got the recipe from.  How does it even fail though? xD  It seems fairly easy enough.
---
Oh I didnt know that. I'm bout to spend some caps
---
So that's what happened to my damn rifle. How annoying.
---
7K... Chump change. My husband &amp; I made $1M+ since player vending began. Only problem is finding things to spend it on before our Mains reach 25K again and again. My condolences on the nerfed tse shotty tho...
---
Caravan anyone?
---
Drop everything on death, problem solved :)
---
What are accents like there?
---
I was the HW/PA but moved to HW/bolstering. I got kinda bored of the same screen and being so heavy. I spent most of my levels inside the power armor. Level 15 to 120
---
To expand on your basement idea. It would be cool if we could obtain a special BORING machine, maybe have it be a mole miner quest or something. Let us create underground tunnels. Great implications for pvp and pve with this. Of course it would never happen with this game engine. Whatever happened to destructive environments like in this game I played way way back called Red Faction?
---
I know that they are made with the FEV like super mutants and centaurs
---
I love watching the videos people post on Facebook calling each other out for it XD
---
I agree, petition to Bethesda to get it started lol
---
I like this idea better.
---
Ps4
---
I've had people refuse stacks of .38 for free lol.
---
I read your post. I'm just saying. Bolstering, Unyielding... none work as well as PA for a HW build.
---
Start a new alt! I've got a full health Unarmed build, and a stealth vats Bloodied rifleman (who also has a commando perk setup as well, now.) That way I can always just switch characters if one playstyle is feeling lame.
---
this but unironically 
---
they already sell *letters* so they might as well go all the way
---
Also delayed pilons. Look up Fallout 4 Pixel Art Light Boxes. I can do a static 8X8 creation for my vendor store front, but I'd love 16X16 or larger with the ability to make the boxes change color and create animations.
---
 I think you can buy the plan for some large amount, so it might be worth farming player vendors who show mods for sale.
---
Would love to be able to exchange like 5 of a perk card to get a gold version of it to be able to bling out my perk build with all gold cards.
---
Would love to visit! Whats your GT?
---
raider is nice because level 20 plebeians like myself can use it
---
yup plus better gun accuracy
---
Yeah that sounds awesome, collapsing tunnels, mining ores, Minecraft let’s plays, etc!!
---
I'm shooting for my own personal Scorchbeast. Might be a little hard on sales at the vending machines, maybe, you think?
---
If your CAMP's spot is taken by another player, choose the "Stay on this World" option then "Quit to Menu" and rejoin from the main menu.
---
Avoid using the "Find another World" option as its currently buggy.
---
They’re very hick, they’re kinda southern like but not really, they have their own flair. The Appalachian Dialect is very drawn out and mixed of elements of all kinds of English dialects. When you meet someone from West Virginia you’ll definitely know lol. Even people in the north of the state near Ohio and Pennsylvania still have Appalachian accents
---
True, i guess back to leveling we go.
---
Proper pronounciation Is App-a-latch-a. Remember this rule of thumb: if you say app-a-lay-shuh, I'm gonna throw an apple at 'charge! (From one WV girl trying to help out her fellow Wastelanders.)
---
GT? I have been wanting to do this and would love some ideas 😁
---
yup.  got the heavy mod plan yesterday.  there is also apparently a piercing one
---
That's a funny way to remember! Thank you!
---
This but in all caps!!!!
---
YEEEEEESSSSSSSS!!!!!!!
---
 What is it 32 max, something like that. They fill and empty as people come and go.
---
Just tried drinking water with a hazmat suit from a river, works and easy!
---
Tried to macro spamming R with 2ms intervals, I was literally collecting water 2min after leaving the river, not making this up :P
---
They've gotta perk for that.
---
They're only useful if you suddenly need a rank 1 fist aid when you have a rank 3 slotted. 
---
But anything beyond a spare rank 1-3 set is a waste.
---
Hmm...I should run with a fast-firing .38 weapon just because of how plentiful the ammo is.
---
Be freeeee, Willy!
---
Glad to know my info is correct then, I'm from California myself and everyone assumes we sound like some sort of cliche 80s surfer so I can never be sure.
---
 Whitespring, you mean Ghoul farming? Why bring a gun to a knife fight. ;)
---
To play Raiders advocate here, having duplicates to the point where you can have every possible level of a perk available helps to greater optimize your build depending on what you're doing, what weapon you're using, the average level of your enemies etc. Especially with intelligence, having a 1-5 gunsmith (requires 15 level ups) helps to slot in cards that i need for a given task.
---
JESUS!!
---
Yup!!! 
---
And it Would be great if we could choose what lvl the specific card should be once we’ve maxed out the rank. This way we can collect to have all cards maxed out as well and then test out specific builds. 
---
Perk cards could get fun to open again.
---
Do you know how the west virginia locals feel about fallout 76 being a popular world wide multiplayer game?Other than Mothman are there any local things like foods/drinks, lore, urban legends, sayings/catchphrases that you could suggest to fo76 devs to put in the game?

I just want a 50 cal pistol then my character will be complete

You might be able to find someone to mod it for you for much less than the cost of buying the plans. Just remove any atom shop paint first.

But Tanagra Town is Mire, not Cranberry.

I like the outfit a lot actually. I’m rocking the hell out of it.

It is from the event correct? Just to clarify

There's a text chat mod. It's far from perfect but hey.
---
You can sell things for caps directly from your in-game camp.
---
Oh ! You're most likely correct then !
---
Yeah having rounded and angled walls were my jam!
---
Wow. Good information. I'll have to test out the accuracy to see if your hypothesis is correct.
---
I was never smart/imaginative enough but I definitely see the appeal!
---
Ok, very nice, I'm going to have to give that a shot.. how many dirty waters did you net??
---
This worked for me! Straight north, against a hill, there's a clearing. As another poster mentioned, stand back when you attempt the photo. Its not like the rest that make you get a kind of close up.
---
On my melee Unyeilding-bloodied I am ridiculously tanky. After taking damage, if I ever do, sometimes my health just pops itself back up again. Your Empath probably helped because I think there is a sense of health regen at very low hp during combat, so it was boosted. Still, amazing fun plus epic damage, not much beats it.

Also my gf was trying to punch me to death while naked for the revive badge, and I was way too tanky once I got to \~15% hp we ended up with a small crowd watching as I just stood there taking it for a solid few minutes.
---
I agree that most aren't that great. I'm holding on to about 5 and every night pray that TSE will return to its former glory.
---
Again, I have a very small time to game so I'm proud of my 7k.
---
There is one but only if it's a player attacking it.  
---
Generally speaking from my experience is that if there is no one at your camp it doesn't get attacked, if a player is there it could get attacked.  
---
If your seeing your camp damaged when you return odds are that someone visited your camp, something attacked it, and they didn't have the common courtesy to kill the thing(s) and fix what they could of the damage.

Gt: Ricky Signed on 
---
I'll be on later tonight :)
---
Really? This is news! Oh but everyone would need it right? Damn give us servers.
---
Gt: Ricky Signed On
---
I should be on later, just message me when you add me
---
As of right now you only lose 12 caps at lvl 50 and over
---
You can under the data I think it's called tab and go to events it's the tab with quest
---
I would def go for this
---
Will always buy GB5 for this reason. It straight up gives you a free run of West Tek for every two runs you do normally.
---
Fallout 7 bad ha skill destroyed 😎😎😎
---
I got on the executioner train early, those bloodied twats didn't know what hit them in PVP
---
This is the real reason I left this game!
---
You're going to want to get yourself a serum recipe. Carnivore herbivore or Twisted muscles are the cheapest serums to craft, you can clean out vendor Bots with three or four of them and some boosts.
---
You’re a hero to me
---
I might have a plan for it, I'll check next time I log on
---
Add Death Claw Eggs perk bethesda
---
If you’re on Xbox I’ll do it for free if you provide the mats
---
It's not perfect. Only people with the mod can see it, ofc. And it's only global chat, last I saw.
---
At last, a new idea
---
Pc has no physical version, so region is irrelevant
---
Yes, the sniper barrels make the Ultracite laser beam red instead of green
---
Yes
---
You can buy them from vendor in whitesprings
---
Improvise. Adapt. Overcome.
---
Found one wandering between Superior Sunset Farm and Ranger District Office. Hope everyone can find their Megasloth today !
---
Too expensive for me to buy, looking for someone who might lower the price to something I can manage.
---
50 cal is faster but chews through ammo faster as a result.
---
I can make them, was wondering why no one buys it. Level 20 it does almost 100 damage.
---
I did for 8k last night
---
Yes this is my 3rd since patch
---
Which one does more damage per shot?
---
I love this idea and I’d like to submit [my camp design](https://imgur.com/a/9dLgot9)
---
When you know what to look for, half a dozen or so. You want to see high level players in the residential area of white springs, and nuked flora despite no nuke zone. Usually means it got nuked, and the nuke effect passed, but it keeps spawning like a nuke zone. 
---
One run I found literally every single ghoul had legendaries, mostly trash, but a couple wicked pieces mixed in.
---
Wait, it's craftable? I just bought one for 1000 caps, luckily the guy let me trade it back when it bugged out on me.
---
If you're on ps4 I have a stack of plasma cartridges I can't get rid of
---
A friend of mine did.
---
Lol that’s awesome 😂
---
Its some bullshit for sure but it doesn’t always happen even if overweight.
---
What platform?
---
If want most dmg per shot Gatling , if want rate of fire .50 cal
---
Gatling but it is quite slow. I prefer it though
---
 Friendly raiders with pointy everything represent!
---
Xbox One because apparently I forgot to add that, and now I’m annoyed with myself.
---
My ridiculously convoluted plan to hoard 6 ill-gotten updoots is finally complete!
---
Im not on xbox but thanks
---
GT Tanaas
---
i spend 65% of my game time fixing my c.a.m.p. because of the constant attacks. it wasn't like this before, even when a friends' camp and now it's every fast travel mobs pop in.
---
Okay how would i go  about doing that?
---
So Kotaku wrote this article, as expected, to fulfill their faily quota of shitting on Fallout 76.
---
Yeah, I started doing that with my build too. It definitely is helpful to have different levels of cards, especially ones that give you extra stimpack juice so it's not level 3 or nothing when you need the slot for something else. But it sucks when its a card that you never intend on using but yet you have a whack of them (I think I have 3 of the 'get a warning when you're near a bobblehead' perk lol)
---
Check the sidebar
---
I just want my laser musket back, I don't even play a rifle build but I would if we got that thing back.
---
What platform are you on? I'm sure someone here will be willing to party up. I'm on ps4. However I dont play as much as I would like due to a busy life.
---
I truly hate that fucking song...
---
So I think I’ll stay where I’m FRAAAHM
---
PC, suppose i should've put that in my post
---
Literally anywhere man they started popping up wherever you can find junk so just loot every trash can fool box anything
---
Everybody basically needs to rebuild their camps and keep in mind where they place the camp marker and where they plan to build their vending machines.
---
Stop playing the lottery and get involved with the player market
---
The Gatling Gun.
---
The Gat Gun is ridiculous efficient. Does a ton of damage, it's very easy to keep fed and has an obnoxiously large clip. You almost never need to reload it in combat, even without the extended magazine. And it's fairly accurate to boot.
---
That said, the 50 cal only has a bit less damage per bullet and like triple the dps. It's more demanding on ammo but it's really worth it. I have a primed B25 and my god does it shred everything. You can see the Queen and the Imposter ticking down when you're unloading on them
---
I mean, we have Discord
---
I waited for that outfit when it was first datamined. I then started spaming Bethesda’s Fallout Twitter page with screenshots of the outfit. I’m so happy that it finally came out
---
Hey just a pessimist here, didnt bethesda take away the ability to tame deathclaws and a few others in one of the patches?
---
I wanted to keep it to myself but informing people who might not know seemed more important. Especially considering that some people enjoy the game much more than I do and the info might help them out a lot more than it would me. That, and I have my camp on top of a lead deposit.
---
The Cryolator needs a buff in the damage department to make it viable.
---
check your inventory you most likely have about 20 and dont even no it
---
Maybe if there were some kind of legendary perks you could roll for, but yeah, I'm in the same boat, leveling up is not exciting anymore and even more of a hassle to pick something to get rid of the pop up screen telling me to pick something.
---
Yesterday the ghouls in Whitespring golf club (unnuked) dropped 4 on a single clear run.
---
Excuse me? The bloatfly syringer is the greatest weapon in this game. Hell one time it even spawned a 1 star bloatfly for me.
---
"I'm here to loot and pillage and... Hey how are you for ammo friend? Want some stimpacks as well? Yeah, take them I have heaps ... They fell of the back of a truck, I swear!"
---
Ah shame I'm on ps4 and have it for sale for 150 caps
---
I wish they hadn't mentioned weapons "disappearing" or said Wasteland Whisperer lets you tame things. There's already lots of misinformation about this feature and we really need them to fix deathclaws and sloths dying on spawn if you load in at your camp. It's a really bad bug that's persisted a long time. The only way for me to keep my sloth is to never log out at camp.
---
Wood/Warehouse/brick?
---
and works best high on drugs
---
Dont worry man, minw would look like a stickman that's had a baby with slenderman and somehow a xenomorph is well, all while still being made of sticks
---
Of course. If only the rules on the market forums weren’t so strict...
---
I am been playing around with a faster fire rate flamer. I find it is a decent close range stealth weapon if you can believe it. 
---
My flamer does about 89 damage per shot. I am turning it into a stealth vats weapon. Enemies are not immediately alerted upon firing the weapon. I have covert operative and concentrated fire to increase my damage by about 5 times. 5 times 89 is 445 damage per shot. At a fire rate of 11.4 per second, we are looking at a potential, but highly variable, 5,073 damage per second. 
---
That is pretty devastating. It also helps to conserve ammo. You simply cannot full time burn all the enemies. You need to be sneaky and melt faces.
---
Yeah, I've done that too.  I just sigh and fast travel away and back.
---
Thanks I’ll keep searching then. I’ve found several Broken ProSnap cameras but not the deluxe yet.
---
discrimination against deaf people  
---
games put audio and VISUAL cues in games because some people are handicapped. Let us communicate without mics. Really silly decision.
---
 I had a Kneecapper in F4 that was so much fun. It dropped as a .45 and I converted it to .38 full auto and just hosed down, with a 20% chance to kneecap on each bullet, anything fast and dangerous. I left a trail of Lurks on Spectacle Island that stretched from the beach to over the other side by the Quonset hut. Then went back and smacked em' with a sledge.
---
Just wanted to say hi! My boyfriend and I are from your neighboring state, regular Virginia, and we just got back from our trip to your beautiful state on Sunday! The closest we came to you was Beckley :)
---
Yeah the plan drops in arktos.
---
please think about deaf people and just at a fading optional chat box. Social interactions will increase and its not fair for deaf people or those without the capability to speak/get a mic.
---
I thought you use the broken ones to craft the good ones. Am I wrong?
---
That should be a separate Hardcore Mode. I'd play that but the XP multiplier would have to be high.
---
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
---
I can second this. I had 22 and didn’t realize.
---
They are ubiquitous, wish deathclaw hides were like fecking broken pro-snaps.
---
Check toolboxes, all variations of them, and remember that until fixed they are a 'misc' item.
---
I probably see between 10 and 20 of those per session.
---
I had no idea what it was worth though, I offered 1.5k
---
Which is why I think the timer should be reduced instead of the amount of scrip being increased. This way dupers won't get any benefits.
---
Thank you. Will.you be on tomorrow evening
---
Good one Bot.
---
Seriously how can you get tired of this?
---
Was aiming for 200, ended up with over 350
---
If you are not a supper then your account could be compromised. Maybe a reinstall can help you if the issue is not a ban.
---
100% agreed, bought both trapper prepper sets so far.
---
You can buy it from players
---
You have to use a ‘Broken ProSnap Deluxe’ to craft it. There is also a ‘Broken ProSnap’ which will not work for crafting. They look different too.
---
Yeah, I'm not a duper, so maybe that could be it. Would I get banned if I unknowingly bought ammo off a duper through player vending?
---
I got the plans on my very first run, on tge first day it came out.
---
Is that realy that rare? I should turn my super stimpaks to difussers then and sell them at my vending machine.
---
PC player.
---
Thanks. Didn’t know of any distinction. I just got mine the other day.
---
I just want to spark a flame in your heart
---
According to what the CM said in this thread they are working on a fix:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/butukx/psa_servers_going_down_for_maintenance_across_all
---
With E3 looming in the horizon the devs might have different priorities right now though.
---
Usually 3 -4.
---
Marked as bug please can we get some upvotes this is game breaking for melee specs tbh just makes me not want to play AT ALL
---
Yup... Thinking this is a complicated prob they may never fix...
---
yes after 9:30 pm central time
---
I’ve played about the same amount of hours as ypu, got the game gifted from a very kind redditor earlier this week. I agree with many of your points. One important thing, so far, is the atmosphere of the game - I really like it! 15 hours in I’m still wandering with great caution and I’m trying my hardest to be aware of my surroundings. I haven’t been killed yet, but that’s because I’m trying not to. The world feels threatening yet inviting me to explore. Can’t wait to jump back in (as for now).
---
The weapon wheel is not great, it feels like a placeholder.
---
I have so many unused cards I wanna get rid of
---
Thanks!
---
Awesome thank you!
---
yes, blame the players for Bethesda’s categorizations.
---
I have a couple extras are you on pc?
---
God I wish this was me.
---
not enough music really boring radio stations. One of the best  things aboue 3, 4, and new vegas was the radio host.  
---
So what you did, Bethesda, was you removed radio hosts and gave us less songs and less likeable songs at that imo
---
Xbox :( I appreciate your offer tho.
---
We'd probably need higher camp budgets for that to be more feasible.
---
Oooh will you be on tomorrow? I'd love to play!
---
Good bot.
---
Dupers aren't grinding 1 star legends at whitesprings to attain scrip, that much I can promise you.
---
While I miss Fasnacht I have to agree. Keeping it synched with real life will make the seasonal events more meaningful. Would rather have more and see some minor or major seasonal event each month. Easter, Midsummer, Halloween, Christmas, New Years, Harvest Festival and others.
---
Fix: A camp can no longer be damaged unless the owner is near.
---
Msg me on xbox, I'll let you play anytime I'm on so just hit me up when you want to try it. I'll probably be on tomorrow
---
I’ll keep an eye out. I’ve probably been scrapping them accidentally. I FEEL you on the deathclaw hides. I hear Gulpers and scorchbeast guano? But I’ve yet to find one myself.
---
You are aware they can dupe three star weapons for scrip correct? They can just dupe any piece of three star equipment they want to for scrip. Which is incredibly efficient since they can transfer that immediately onto an alt who can scrip the items and trade for other 3 stars. Risen and repeat. Its way more effective than farming legendaries in world since there are very few sources to get 3 stars consistently. What is hard about this concept?
---
Well how in the fuck is that my fault? I sell unique cosmetics. And might I add not overly priced. I can't  make you see different than what my options are in game. I am not nor ever was misleading you...
---
What a stupid rant....
---
Oh, Scythe98 on PS4 if anyone would like to hit me up, lol.
---
No. You account must use a exploit in order to be banned.
---
Sorry but it’s not our fault that Bethesda didn’t separate clothing from armor or Legendaries from standard weapons etc :/
---
Yep technology wise it’s truly an amazing feat to be able to render such complex scenes on all platforms. Although there was lots of crashes in the beginning, now it’s much more stable. Without hair the models look perfectly fine. There’s tons of details in all the characters. The only thing if I have to pick one is the polygon count of the Dragon model. The two circles that serve as the gun’s rear sight are way too faceted. For such close-up display they should have given it a few more polygons and make them as smooth as possible.
---
After getting FO76 I got very interested the story and bought FO4, installed it with all the add-ons, but haven’t had a chance to play it yet. Western and gambling is a fun combination. I’ve been gambling at mama murmghr’s place since she surfaced, after a few dozens of nocturnal and junkies she gave me two explosive guns in a row yesterday, marked the end of my weeks long losing streak lol 😂
---
A ghoul mutation that actually had cosmetic effects would be awesome if they added it.
---
Have it do healing from rad damage(basically the ghoulish perk), and melee attacks deal rad damage. But -4 charisma.
---
A super mutant mutation would be cool too. +4 strength and +4 Endurance but -4 charisma and -4 intelligence.
---
Why?
---
Because they have to implement TTS and STT if they implement any text chat, due to accessibility rules.
---
Which is, of course, less accessible, but that's what happens when loopholes exist.
---
As others have already pointed out they are both good for different applications and you will most likely end up with both.
---
The Gatling is excellent for trash and you can even, with a bit of practice and the relevant perk, consistently land headshots from hip-fire. Besides thanks to its cousin the Minigun's ravenous hunger for ammo 5mm is abundant, this coupled with its judicious use of ordinance means that in all likelihood you will never have to craft a single round.
---
Conversely the .50Cal with its high RoF is fantastic for mobs with ludicrous HP pools but the ammo is scarce.
---
Okay, well that's good then. I guess I'm gonna have to reinstall the game then. My internet is really gonna hate me for that 😂
---
VATS is an integral part of the Fallout franchise, don’t knock a guy for using an in-game system.
---
That's not far fetched at all.
---
If this was your first time playing after a break, it seems more likely that if you were banned, it's due to something you did before the break. Haven't seen many ban posts recently.
---
Is your Xbox name "Drexxy23"?
---
This is what im talking about... Its not someone who helped you in survival mode. Some rando out there who decided to take a chance and not blast you. Sure we got emoji (and ill continue to pick up every one on the atom store) but how will i ever say "thank you, im near the Charleston train station.. If you come by ill give you big savings on my scrip i have yet to turn in. Im maxed for the day. Hey you rocking snipers huh? Check this out.." Without ear raping you of my 3 yr old in one of her moods. Or me talking like a creepy old man cause its late and i dont want the ear rape myself.
---
The list goes on. Almost no one on pc talks. Give them a chance.
---
Discord is for pre arranged meetings. I want that lvl 100 be able to explain wtf im suposto do on this mission. Thats rebuilding murica!
---
 I had the dreaded 4:8:2000 and after some fooling around it got fixed. So its not always a ban.
---
 Put in a ticket, they got back to me quite fast.
---
My heart goes out to everyone who's had a deathclaw or megasloth just disappear like this. The only way to keep mine safe is to never log out at camp and keep my camp device well out of reach of the foundations. It helps, but I've already had two unexpected disconnections at camp and had to risk my buddy disappearing again. RIP Craig, Craig II, my sense of childlike wonder/creativity, and Craig the Third.
---
No cross play at the moment. Recall them mentioning wanting to do it (this was before the launch), but nothing since.
---
Metal boxes (the black ones), footlockers, Gulpers, Super Mutant Behemoths I can confirm as possible sources of the fecking hides - because I have found them myself in those.
---
Deathclaw nests should be a possible source too but have had no luck with those so far.
---
Someone was selling a bunch of serums for 200 caps. I restrained myself and left them for someone that would need them.
---
Not on XBOX. My gamertag is : Ricky Signed On.
---
Your suggestions of removing VATS and the pip boy, IMO, makes me think you don’t want a fallout game as much as you want a generic FPS RPG
---
Your problems could be related to server issues (or networking). You could try tomorrow for a different experience. Just check your network.
---
Dude.... rifle builds are clearly the choice. If you’re not a rifle build in PvP, you’re handicapping yourself.
---
I regularly see female scorched wearing nurse outfits around Fort Defiance.
---
yes it's just an odd glitch it happens from time to time and no you can't pick them up ,,,and use this site to share from xbox [https://xboxclips.com/](https://xboxclips.com/) find your clip then paste the link here
---
Is fo nv worth it? I didnt think so. Kinda fuckin sucked get ctd all the time. But then again its the best fallout iv ever played so who knows?
---
Rn I'm using a anti armor explosive handmade so I'm already there
---
Ok thanks
---
The break wouldn't have been more than 3-4 weeks in honesty. I can definitively say I've never involved myself in any glitch exploitation in the game, as it defeats the purpose of the challenge in a game so I am quite puzzled as to why I'd be banned. 
---
I don't have a crazy amount of caps, or super rare weapons, and I'm a rather low level for someone who's owned and played the game since launch. So it's quite puzzling.
---
Good
---
What's that suppose to mean?
---
Rightio, I'll be sure to do that.
---
Kotaku is making money off your story. Fyi. Also breeding hate about how glitchy and shitty this game is.
---
Lol pretty much. I think the only way you could be better, non bloodied, is a vats crits one.
---
Get luck 15, critical savvy 3, then better criticals, you’ll be crit’ing every 2 shots and you’ll be a typical survival player at that point. Make sure to use stealthboys to be extra extra cheap. You’ll be like 80% of the other players on there and will be able to kill 99% of them. Depending on what platform you’re on, you’ll run into/begin to recognize the players that are different.
---
Good luck.
---
(Also don’t use stealthboys if you have even an ounce of pride, it was a joke)
---
Also if it’s bad grammar / punctuation it’s because I’m on mobile and I’m bad at life pretty much
---
Global, trade and local (100m) are in it so far. Might be a party chat too.
---
0:38
---
[https://youtu.be/KVDEl_GL3_c](https://youtu.be/KVDEl_GL3_c)
---
Yeah but it was Kotaku so you actually die.
---
I had a guy try to take a workshop from me and my buddies and he kept hiding behind trees and rocks and using stealth boys to get the drop on us. A couple mini nukes in his area showed him otherwise
---
Knee jerk reaction. Have never met or seen about a wrongful ban in any game ever. Gl hope you get it figured out.
---
If you have a mic, you could just ask. I’ve helped a bunch of people get it through posts on here and they just asked in game at events.
---
I wouldn't say I want a generic FPS RPG. I want a tightly controlled, think Doom 2016 or Rage 2, FPS set in the Fallout universe. Open to lots of universe personality with distinctive NPCs
---
Forgot to mention, don’t use explosives or power armor in PvP. Everyone that is close to a challenge will be using fireproof 3 and a Dense torso mod.
---
No it's a good thing all people need to learn how things work and this a hands on experience 😋
---
The people I've pvped with so far get shredded with my explosives, I have tank killer so I stagger them ALOT but I will take that info into consideration
---
i think the comment section gave me more cancer than chernobyl to firefighter lol
---
Ah, okay. Yeah, I hope so too, cause I liked what had been added to the game, and the player vending really added something that I felt was missing from the game. 
---
What's weirdest about it all is, shortly after this post, I restarted my PS4, and was able to get back in a world, and play for about 20 minutes before being booted off again. My internet has been dropping in and out today, but that doesn't explain the error codes.
---
Explosives on a gun is good, I’m talking about fatmans and missile launchers and grenades (plasma and cryo are pretty good if landed tho)
---
No...that's epic! Mwahaha
---
Kotaku made the news so they can make money - also the editors are lazy sacks of shit.
---
I send the author a message about switching wasteland whisperer to animal friend :)
---
Personally disagree with this. This is in 3 as well, and while I don't mind just collecting all the junk I pick up to sell for caps in that game, I would prefer to need to scavenge for junk to repair my weapons, as opposed to either paying someone else to repair it or needing two of one weapon to repair it on my own
---
Dear diary......
---
I been server hopping flooded trainyard and only been getting nothing or ton random glowings. In the past it was way easier.
---
If reporting on a broken feature people want fixed is ”shitting on fallout 76” the i guess so.
---
I just want my damn pets to not die instantly
---
Being that there's no DJ in 76, it's much more acceptable for me to just whip up a spotify playlist to listen to while I play.   
---
I present to you, [Free States Radio](https://open.spotify.com/user/1285825658/playlist/7jGkH39I97tt4YRSzvzlHV?si=fRkuKyTORQec3PnkMFPSNg). Cucks, commies, and bootlickers need not apply.
---
The other day I filled my vendor with 30 wedding rings .. then spent the next 20 minutes laughing maniacally to myself .. sat in the bushes waited for people to show, wanting to see at least someone start whippin grenades something .. it was great .. but ironically sold them all .. not one incident either 
---
maybe BGS should split vendor categories for apparel/armor .. but apparently these things sell well
---
Yes thats how websites work, they generate content to their website and thus ad revenue. Nothing wrong with that.
---
Dang. That sucks. I looked it up on youtube and got it as I was walking away from a SBQ.
---
I'm almost to 1100hrs. So I guess it really depends on how you play plus what your daily focus is, subtract the reasons you left before &amp; multiply by the number of youtubers you faithfully watch.
---
Literally not our fault that Bethesda didn't separate outfits from armor. Fuck outta here with this mindset
---
But in my opinion your kinda rewarded for finding  a rare weapon to help repair the other ones, and it helps with the new people with heaps of pipe pistols and heaps of ammo (second part is based on when I started btw)
---
There ya go. Your internet is wonky and this launcher from pc is questionable. Trun it off and.. Well you know. The whole thing internet included. In plug from wall ect. Sounds stupid and it is. Works tho
---
👍🏻
---
Would that work even though I'm on console and not PC?
---
Except all the comments on kotaku are "people play that shitty game" because kotaku are uneducated gamers reading about people who enjoy games.
---
It’s hard to do that as I’m on PS4 and I don’t know how to capture videos and transport them to my phone
---
Someone probably bought them all to stop you you monster.
---
Second. That was a unique system, but gods I'd kill myself before dealing with it again.
---
you can buy the plan at the raider vendor in whitesprings .. hes in the shop with the robot that sells the blackpowder weapons
---
So what were your favorite parts of West Virginia?!
---
Yeah, it's much better than it was I agree, but you still see alot of camp budget posts even now, what I'm thinking is that turrets don't take up any of the 'cosmetic budget' at all but use a separate smaller 'defence budget'
---
What? No, that makes zero sense. Also, Bethesda did not do New Vegas, Obsidian did. However Bethesda did do Fallout 3, which also has what you're trying to suggest they implement into 76
---
Yes. Hid behind a cart in Site Charlie while a stealth boy was active, an Assaultron still saw me and beamed me down.
---
Not if you have been banned. That shit is tied to your console account. Just saying that the laumcher is wack on pc and the tried and true method works on most things. And stop playing wifi. Get a fucking cable lol
---
Sadly yes
---
It really needs server chat, I'm personally not that interested in communicating with players not on my server.
---
Should I change it to fallout 3 in the actual post, also I never played it looked into fallout 3 by the way
---
The commenters don't matter they don't even play the game and will shit on fallout 76 regardless of the content of the post. what matters is getting this information into ears at Bethesda that can make a difference and actually fix these things because if people don't talk about it they wont fix it.
---
I'm sure this just looks like another attack on fallout 76 but if you actually spend time trying to tame animals and build camps these issues are really noticeable and severely hurt my experience while playing the game so i really would like them to be fixed.
---
I love the game and i only wish it would be treated with that same level of enthusiasms by the devs that its players show
---
I would like that because my camp was grieved by an idiot that lured mobs to my base for fun. It weren't enemies that spawned from fast traveling because the guy actually lured them from different locations to my base.
---
No, It’s a tough world out there these days. I call it good timing for both of you.
---
it give 90 ballistic resist but only 30 carry weight i think
---
 Actually it may. One of my symptoms was a lot of wifi intermittent connections. Still it was more than that.
---
 I built a new machine, I had been going to and had finally assembled the parts, and really, that fixed the problem. Not something that helps you, but hey. ;)
---

Just to avoid anyone else correcting you on who made which game, yeah. Cause to be fair they did keep that aspect of the game from Obsidian when they made Fallout 3

I always thought the stringer was a status weapon, and thus a staple. Turns out nobody that works at Bethesda gives a fuck about it, because it's too interesting.

Literally the best guns that you'd want to use it on in the heavy category.

I highly doubt bethesda reads anything kotaku posts. They are a cesspool of toxic gamers. Last article I read the journalist said she played the game, and basically cited the video Beth posted scene for scene as if that was her gameplay. Idiots.

No, thankfully.

The main quests / overseers quest (following her through various locations) are designed to get you into new areas. once there, you'll see events you can complete on the map, discover new locations that will likely interest you that can be explored, and stumble upon quests in those areas. By the end of it you'll have gone through each factions quests and unlocked the end game content, and will have explored a good chunk of the map. 
---
Then there are workshops, ammo / material farming, trading scrap / weapons / armor on various subreddits / discords, setting up your own player shop, and the infinite grind to get better gear.
---
Yeah, rightio, I'll wait for these connectivity issues to ease up, and see if that's what the problem is. And yeah, I'm looking at cable, it's just a bit hard with the distance it'll have to cover 😂

Hmm, I'll try again when my connection is more stable and see if I'm still having these issues and report back.

I find the fact that we are spread out to be the strength of it. Rarely goes more than 30 mins without someone announcing a SBQ, encrypted or similar event or an interesting trade opportunity. Well, hopefully they will implement server-wide chat in the future. We are all individuals who want different things, and I hope they fix that for you. Personally I will stay with my spread out crew to cover more territory.
---
T-60 is extremely easy to repair but hat should not be what decides it for you. You can get so many improved repair kits for free from SBQ and I think maybe another event or two, and the T-51b provides by far the best physical / energy resist, although somewhat poor rad resist (which can easily be made up for with diluted rad-x / Radshield, which both stack by the way and don't affect your  mutations).

"The tragic story of Steve might seem like a strange, isolated incident, but it’s indicative of a broader tension within the game and its community. It’s possible to get a pet to get attached to in Fallout 76,, but almost everything about the world, going down to the very code its built on, seems intent on trying to extinguish that relationship at a moment’s notice. The subreddit is full of posts with people requesting an overhaulto the pet mechanic, or a little more attention for itso that more players can give it a try for themselves."
---
Currently there isnt a pet mechanic. Hes writing this like there is this massive break in the game. Current tamed animals are just sentries. Anyone can walk along and kill it if you leave, alsocyouchabe a 75% chance at highest rank to get a new pet. No big deal. There is a pet system being developed and it's been hinted at multiple times - but this go with the same fact- let's shit on this game - because nothing works. 
---
It does work - taming a creature currently just makes that creature a moving turret. That's all. A later patch will introduce better "companions" if the hints are correct.
---
.50 Cal is the best dps in the game for sustained dps - great for things like SBQ, the alpha boss at Project Paradise, and Imposter Sheepsquatch. Also great for clearing huge crowds of enemies. The Gatling Gun is the most ridiculously ammo efficient weapon in the game (not counting the harpoon gun which has infinite ammo) - does most damage per shot.  They're both good. I use both for different situations. My BE gatling gun is for generic use - one shotting mutants and ghouls, easily taking out scorched, etc. I can keep that damn thing filled up on ammo just by farming west tek and getting free 5mm rounds from the minigun wielding mutants there. My B25 .50 Cal is primed and for the SBQ, and it freaking melts her in 3 minutes or less.
---
Just curious: you said many points. Are there fun points you disagree with?
---
I still cannot believe they allowed us to use our characters with all our gear. I have a lot of "god roll" items, or whatever people call them and i would've preffered it if it was a fresh start. They would benefit from less strain on the servers too doing this.
---
For the most part people feel pretty proud having the game set in our state mainly because West Virginia doesn’t have a noticeable media presence and other than for negative reasons we’re rarely displayed to the world so people have taken pride in some positive things being shown off even if it is a nuclear wasteland lol. West Virginia’s most well known food item is probably pepperoni rolls which are easy to make and became popular here as a snack to put in coal miners dinner buckets for work so it’d be great to have them introduce those into the game, A lot of people don’t know this but in the Early 1900s the US military and striking coal miners engaged in battle and was the largest insurrection in the United States since the Civil War. The battle took place on Blair Mountain and I think it would be interesting to have a special event where two teams duke it out on Blair mountain for coal miner themed gear and weapons. For more info on the battle here’s the Wikipedia page for it https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Blair_Mountain Confederate General Robert E. Lee’s  favorite officer was Lieutenant General Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson who was born in Clarksburg,Virginia which is now West Virginia and it would be quite interesting to see references or items related to him to be brought into the game. One super common catchphrase from my part of West Virginia is “what do you say, bud?”  You use this to ask people how are they doing but with our accents and how we pronounce things it comes out as “watcha say bud?” and it’s a common form of greeting in southern West Virginia so it’d be nice to see robots with our hick dialect to greet people with that when you’d interact with them lol
---
Travelling Pharmacy and Thru-Hiker just make managing your inventory so much easier, being able to carry around a good amount of chems and aid items. Bloody Mess is a no brainer for any character. Your respective weapon % damage boost perks are also no brainers.
---
Sorry nobody was replying, but I didn't know what you were talking about.
---
Yeah I definitely get how useful it is in that regard, unfortunately for me I only play survival and there is never more than one server in my region so jumping on to other servers isn't really an option.
---
No problem! Most of the stereotypes West Virginians have are more than likely true as much as I hate to admit it XD
---
I think out of 200+ fights I've had one or two crashes, and one or two "queen decided to leave the map" and never came back. Otherwise it's been fine. On PC.
---
Thank you for the info on vids mate now i know how to do it yoy 👍
---
Well you can tame a creature and send it to your camp. Thats a pet nomatter how you word it. 
---
Nobody should be able to kil it but due to how the game loads camp tags even though camps are invunerable to damage from other players tamed creatures are not for multiple minutes upon login.
---
This article is quite literally just reporting an issue about a lackluster feature that bethesda didnt bother to finish for the game.
---
There are times to defend a game from other people shitting on it, this isn’t one.
---
That would be very good.
---
If that was not possible, maybe if we could select cards, duplicates and cards we do not need, to hide from the selection. A selection that shows favourite cards would make it a little easier for people to change out cards for different situations. Some type of sorting for cards is needed when you get up in level and the cards start to pile up.

The main trading subreddit which we aren't allowed to link here because the mods of this reddit and the trading reddit don't like eachother, is one of the top 10 subreddits for posts per week. It's that busy. The trading community is thriving just fine. I have a friends list of 30-40 people on every night, and they're all in different worlds, so if I want to farm something by server hopping, I just go down through the list joining their games. Game is doing just fine.
---
Ah, yeah. Definitely get that. Well, I keep upvoting all posts about both better official mod support and text chats because we need it. Badly.

Nope. I tried that, but it never worked out for me. I would be happy to help you out if on Xbox. I won’t be on til about 4am pst though. Gt Deviant Monster

You are clearly grasping at straws if you think your tamed deathclaw is a pet. It's a turret and that's how the game treats it. There are countless other locations to grab a fresh deathclaw if you're truly looking for a new one. I'm sure you're really into the rp aspects of the game, and I'll be happy to see if they actually add companions. But until they get to that part of their release schedule - your "pet" is a turret.
---
Now I know what yo put in my currently empty vending machine.

If you have 0 skill and are a total piece of human filth not worth the space you take up then you could use stealth boys in combination with the full auto Tesla rifle. You dont have to aim because the shots arc to enemies no matter what and you are very hard to hit while jumping around and invisible.
---
Oof no thanks I like to look my enemy in the eye. Hiding isn't my style
---
nah hes level 2 whats he got to lose really.
---
It's one thing to have a stealth build.. it's another to be using a weapon that doesnt require you to shoot AT your target at the same time as stealth boys.
---
I found one for sale for 4k last eve and picked it up. Couldn't be bothered with the possum badges ._.
---
Actually read the article and read how many times they mention "Fallout 76" and the word "broken" in close proximity.

I like your style very much. The question is - would you be interested in doing some 2D Art work for Project Arroyo? You may have heard about us - we are re-creating Fallout 2 in Fallout 4 and we're in need of all sorts of people, including 2D Artists.

I regularly find one on a table in front of the wave pool at the water park.
---
(Xbox) I know I have! It’s either been disconnects or just screen freezing where you can’t move and have to disconnect yourself. The random delays in movement/actions were bad enough, but getting yet another disconnect when you’re on the final round of an event is beyond frustrating. I just had that pleasure a few minutes ago (again today) so I decided I’d probably better get off rather than scream.
---
You really cant deny a lot of things are broken in the game.
---
Alot of the perks do nothing, alot of weapon mods do nothing and alot of camp objects simply do nothing.
---
The game is broken yet in a much better state then what it was when it launched.
---
But lets not pretend like there arent a truckload of issues still waiting to be fixed.
---
Offtopic - Is there a 2 step verification for beth launcher?
---
You can call it a turret but what difference does that make? And if its a turret why cant i fix it when it dies, i would be more then happy with ”turrets” that are just stationary in my base. 
---
The only thing i want is them to not die instantly.
---
I wish I would have seen this two days ago.
---
I think we should just give them time. they've already done a lot. and rebroken a lot then fixed alot again. but gradually things have steadily gotten closer and closer to being balanced.
---
&gt;Strength
---
Traveling Pharmacy is very very useful for PvE players. Reduced chem weight means you can carry enough chems that you'll never run out in the field. I hesitate to call it necessary for everyone, but I'd wager over 90% of players use this perk.
---
Bandolier is in a similar vein. Reduced ammo weight is powerful if you mass craft ammo. I might call this necessary for users of high fire rate automatic weapons, since you need to carry a lot of ammo on you for those.
---
Pack Rat. "Get-Your-Ass-Home-In-A-Pinch" the perk.
---
&gt;Perception
---
Lockpicker perks are the most important thing here. Having them allows you to skip what I consider the most tedious portion of the Launch Silos, if you have the hacking perks as well.
---
Green Thumb. Picking flowers is a concerningly important part of the game. This makes it more efficient
---
&gt;Endurance.
---
Endurance is weird. It's vital in some builds and nearly worthless in others.
---
Fireproof is the one I'd call necessary, but only if you use explosive weapons regularly. It reduces explosive damage you take by 45% and is the difference between dying constantly to your own splash damage or taking almost nothing from it.
---
&gt;Charisma.
---
If you play Solo, Lone Wanderer is necessary. Free Damage *Reduction* is ridiculously powerful, and it'd be worth it just for that. But it also gives you AP regen. Useful if only for sprinting more.
---
&gt;Intelligence
---
Buckle up. Apparently being smart is useful.
---
Armorer is required for Deep Pockets and Ultra-Light on every(?) class on non-PA.
---
Gunsmith/Makeshift Warrior are necessary prior to late game. You need them to mod your weapons in most cases, and maintenance is a bitch without them until you start farming Improved Repair Kits. (At which point you can probably just drop GS/MW completely.)
---
In a similar vein, you have Fix It Good and Weapon Artisan. Like the above, necessary until you can farm IRPs.
---
Power Patcher reduces the repair cost of your PA. See above reasoning.
---
Batteries Included is ridiculously good if you use energy weapons or PA, and necessary if you use both. Power User can be subbed for BI if you use PA but not energy guns.
---
Chemist. Double yield from crafting chems. One of the few on this list I'd call a universal must have for any point in the game.
---
Scrapper. Can double (or more) the scrap you get from breaking down shit. Saves literal hours grinding materials (plastic and steel, namely) for ammo.
---
Demo Expert. If you use an explosive weapon (either natively explosive or legendary explosive) this is 60% more damage, for 5 perk points instead of 9. Ideally use both, but if you're strength is contested...
---
Hacker. In conjunction with Lockpick it lets you skip the worst part of the Silos.
---
&gt;Agility
---
Ammosmith under Agility. 80% more ammo. Ridiculously potent when combined with Super Duper.
---
Adrenaline. It's a lot easier to trigger and maintain that it looks. You get a full minute before stacks wear off.
---
ThruHiker. Boy am I glad this isn't another Strength perk. It's Pharmacy but for aid that isn't chems. (Excluding Bobbles, SBoys and Zines.)
---
&gt;Luck
---
Starched Genes. Take it. Take it. Take it. Mutations are good, the downsides are non issues even without Class Freak. This makes your mutations permanent as long as it is slotted in.
---
Class Freak. I'm not a believer, but I'd get crucified if I didn't mention it so here it is.
---
Good With Salts. If you don't have the fridge backpack, this is super useful. It affects all aid with a condition bar. Raw flux, raw meat, cooked meat, raw ingredients for cooking.
---
Bloody Mess. Free damage, applies to everything. Enough said.
---
Super Duper. 30% to double craft something while only spend the materials of one craft. So good. Guns, Chems, Ammo. Almost everything you can cradt is affected. The most notable exceptions being Bulk junk and fermentable alcohol.
---
&gt;Best of the Best
---
What I believe that absolutely everyone who physically can get these should as soon as possible.
---
Starched Genes. Mutations are so good. So. Good. They're literally super powers.
---
Super Duper. This, imo, is the best perk in the game. I could go on for forever about it. Honorable mention to Chemist here.
---
Bloody Mess. Free Damage for everyone no matter what.
---
Adrenaline. Even if you can't afford all five ranks, like me, it's very potent. I have it at rank 2 and in a queen fight where the adds don't bug out it provides more damage than any of my rank 3 damage perks. At rank 5 it is ludicrous.
---
&gt;Personal favorites
---
ThruHiker. I use food a lot, for eating and selling to vendorbots. I couldn't walk half of the time without this.
---
Good With Salts. See above.
---
Party Girl / Cola Nut. Makes Nuka Dark 45% water alone, and 90% water together. Yeet.
---
Stabilized. Literal the only reason I still user Power Armor. It's Heavy Weapon specific, but in a vacuum it's the strongest class-specific perk imo.
---
I disagree this would require a rework of how mods are obtained because you'd either have to
---
1. Repair your weapon
---
2. Scrap for a new mod
---
Put a few points in luck, pick up stuff off dead bodies to use, scrap it when it breaks and use new looted items. There are very few cases before level 40ish where you will need good gear. If you do events/story, you can level fairly easily. I would recommend not rushing towards endgame though, unlike many MMO games where they start at max level, fo76 is more about the journey.
---
Didn't know this post existed. Thank you
---
Take naps for the “well rested” XP boost, there’s food buffs that can be used too, cranberry juice for 2% XP boost, Cranberry Cobbler and canned meat stew from the feed the people event give 5% XP boost and Cranberry relish gives a 10% xp boost. Do as many events as possible in between the main quests as that will help too. In terms of weapons whitesprings is the place to go to collect up legendary weapons and armour to turn into scrip to get something better (if your lucky) from the purveyor
---
Well Emergency Protocols is a flat 50% DR on top of your already good DR from power armor, which is probably in the 400-450 DR / ER range. With the diminishing returns on higher DR / ER, of course the 50% from EP is going to be far superior than not having it. The way ER / DR works in Fallout 4 and Fallout 76 is that it gives diminishing returns, meaning that the more you have, the less each point is worth, but more is obviously always better. To get the equivalent of the flat 50% DR you get from Emergency Protocols, you'd probably need 1000+ ER / DR, which just isn't possible to my knowledge. If you want to run a bloodied build and actually take hits while outside of power armor, I think your only option is Sentinel.
---
You can use Dodgy for another 30%, and Lone Wanderer for another 20%. These are all separate multipliers mind you, not additive, but at this point I can run around with 10 HP if I  run dodgy, Protocoled power armor, and lone wanderer (or have an empath in group).
---
I like it
---
It's such an incredible waste that there isn't any kind of ultracite syringer barrel. 30 and 40 damage over 10 seconds are outright pathetic. Like you said, they can barely kill a level 1 scorched. 40 damage *per second* for 10 seconds would have some use. It would still suck, but it would at least have a purpose, especially if the damage is unaffected by armor. The fact that there isn't some obscenely powerful barrel that uses ultracite-infused (Science! explanation here) for an end-game barrel feels so off to me. It just makes no sense in terms of character progression. We're using this weird new compound for armor, guns, and ammo. Why would we not weaponize it with a weapon that already relies on chemicals? It feels so natural
---
The Riot Shotgun from FNV?
---
I would honestly love that for this game, and it would make a shit ton of sense too in the context of the game.
---
I've been having similar experiences.   It did seem like for a time that things had improved but recently it seemed like they have taken a giant step backward with regard to server stability.
---
This isn't what you asked for, but I've tried other builds - melee, stealthy bloodied sniper builds for max 1 shot damage, shotguns, etc. They all were far inferior. 
---
So, here is my bloodied heavy weapons build.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76Guides/comments/blw1y6/the\_bloodied\_heavy\_weapons\_tank\_an\_end\_game\_pve/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76Guides/comments/blw1y6/the_bloodied_heavy_weapons_tank_an_end_game_pve/) 
---
This doesn't use VATS. It doesn't use stealth. It uses a shitton of firepower to mow down enemies relentlessly and become nearly immortal through stacking multiple % damage reduction effects while in power armor. It does the best dps in the game and offers a good variety of heavy weapons, whether you are interested in extreme efficiency (gatling gun) , ultra high dps (.50 cal / light machine gun), or even if you want to swap out the heavy weapon perk cards for melee. That works too.
---
There is a video of me burning down the SBQ with ease using a variant of this (a long 2+ hour stream actually, but the link goes to one of the SBQ fights) in the above link if you have any doubts.
---
A bloodied ultra glass cannon meathook build MIGHT be higher dps but it's honestly qurestionable and subject to a lot of RNG, and dies very easily, requires GG gear like full unyielding / AP regen / sentinel armor and bloodied  swing speed meathook (very expensive). My build is fully functional with power armor and a few mods that you can get crafted for fairly cheap, and a 1 star bloodied gatling gun / .50 cal, both of which are reasonable to keep stocked with ammo.
---
They should just let us switch between perk card levels, for example switching between level 1-5 Gunsmith if you have max lvl Gunsmith. I don't get why that's not possible yet.
---
R8, scrolling is a problem for idea bout swapping perk cards. High level players scroll through a hundreds of cards to swap to 'camp' perk setup from 'battle' setup. I suggest they make a 'heap' for uselles perk cards and 'album' for perk cards u use.
---
I think the Riot SG was semi-auto. I was thinking more along the lines of true full-auto, like the AA-12.
---

---
Servers and game engine can't even handle current load.
---
Well it’s different for me. It wouldn’t show me that it’s explosive by glancing at it
---
I use to have this problem. Team mates controller was broken and he couldn't go into passive mode. Few times I had to just quit the app as I was in food build mode with like 400 antiseptic. for the time being all I can suggest is closing the app the second pvp goes down.
---
50cal, hands down. No spin-up time. Reload at will and don't have weird core things to deal with. Same fire rate as gatling plasma. Slightly lower paper damage, but benefits from armor-piercing, which gat plasma does not, so more actual damage. More controllable recoil.
---
Why wont the mods fucking ban you? You do nothing but create arguments, clearly showed that you're trolling and you spread false information.
---
Were you trying to tame 1 in a named location spawn like; deathclaw island or abandoned waste dump? Because it needs to be from a random encounter spawn.
---
Like running south down the road from Abby's bunker. (I'm not suggesting this location is best for deathclaws, I just know I've tamed a megasloth by server hopping here.)
---
You got that junkie gamma gun on ps4 I know a Italian guy who would shit a Ferrari for one
---
50 cal, you can craft a shit ton of 50 cal ammo for a lot less investment that plasma cores.
---
Honestly play the quest. You start rushing to higher levels, your gunna make the game boring faster.
---
Buying the plans isn't much use for that item, unless you plan on making lots for other people. You're likely only ever going to build 2 for yourself. Might as well hire someone else to craft them for you for much cheaper than 5800
---
I like this thought

They should also consider not mixing super high level players with low level. AND.... take off those floating fucking name tags!  Makes all stealth efforts utterly pointless. All games seem obsessed with them and it's beyond stupid.
---
It's a fucking trash article that spreads misinformation.
---
At least you can start it, every time I get close to it, by game crashes to desktop.
---
Well, I thought about it and I was only partially right - in that I don't think Paradise is difficult (it is only difficult without distributed effort; which depends on the players participating).
---
But you were right. Handicapping higher-level players isn't a good idea. Everyone paid the same for this game, but your individual progression is on you.
---
Future challenges and quests, and events, should certainly (mostly) favor those veteran players who are already very high level. I guess the whole point of regions is, one region is the best for you to operate in at your early level, so you do what you can and level up, to push your boundaries to other regions as you outgrow the old, rinse and repeat.
---
If anything, lower levels could receive a 5-10% damage boost, or a 5-10% damage resistance, while participating in Events with *higher* level characters. As a slight boost for pushing their boundaries, with other (higher level) players. But to reduce the damage output or resistance, or health or anything, of higher level players for participating in events with *lower* level characters, well that is more in line with punishment than balance, so it just isn't a good idea.
---
Even then, there doesn't really need to be a damage boost or damage resistance, for lowers playing with highers, because that in itself is a reward of gaining those higher levels. Very valid responses that inspired me here.

There's a mod literally called nothing but "bladed". The excavator power armor ones don't state which power armor they're for (looking for black titanium in the description is the only way to tell, and not everyone reads reddit to find out about that). There are many other examples too.
---
That’s awesome. I usually settle with HB and unyielding armor and feel I’m doing good. But to team up for your reason is so valuable. Thank you for a great explanation.
---
Is this only during a nuke? Or anytime? Do the ghouls have the legendarys?
---
If it's Arsenal type DLC you're after then it should show great promise at the start of the season, but then not sign anyone and screw up in the second half and leave everyone disappointed and annoyed at the coach.

---
1000 hours level 248 power armor user and I have tried every possible perk card combo to make me tanky and still get one and 2 shot by pvpers. ah you say how about the stealthboy mod for the x-01 torso. sigh no. it drains ap while you're cloaked. if you're very still you just run out of ap and unclok if you try to move they hear you clanking about and with audio directional input can pretty much just wait for your big dumb metal loud ass to reappear then they vats crit you. 
---
the key to pvp is stealth and avoiding vats critical. as a power armor user you just cant do that well at all. oh i tried the mobility route as well and that doesnt work either. untill they fix the broken weapons getting damage buffs from multiple perk card sets (looking at you hand gun and meat hook) everyone without stealth is just one or 2 shot. only stealth and legendary armor will save you.

Cow milk is designed to make a calf grow hundreds of pounds in a very shirt period of time. Water isnt going to do that on its own
---
I should add that initially, I couldn't replicate the problem (tonight) while firing the weapon in first-person while moving backward and diagonally (left or right), so I believed it was fixed. But it eventually surfaced again (even while moving backward and diagonally).
---
So the problem still exists as of tonight (when I recorded the video).
---
Clearly, the code works perfectly for the third-person firing and movement speed reduction/return-to-normal, but is completely different for the first-person firing and movement speed reduction/return-to-normal so that might be a good place to start.

But laser muskets were jury rigged by the Minutemen up in Boston.
---
Not really, but there are some that I can’t relate to since I haven’t really progressed that far :)
---
Anytime, doesn’t need to be a nuke because anywhere that spawns a lot of enemies has a higher chance to spawn a legendary, I normally pick up a couple from the club house, 1 or maybe 2 if lucky in the little shops running down the side and then 1 or 2 in the car park next to the laundry place.
---
I know the lore would be off but since they've already changed stuff I'm willing to forgive it if it means I get my laser musket. Change it up even make it look different so it could have been designed by somebody else, I just want it in game.
---
Exploding gatling plasma&gt;50 cal&gt;gatling plasma
---
Gatling plasma is fun to use but has lots of drawbacks to it like others said
---
I don't see enough of a difference to bother with anything but excavator personally, hardly took much damage even from the queen &amp; that was before I got Scaly Skin &amp; the Resolute Veteran.
---
I guess that depends on what you did after you received them...  
---
Did you just leave them to deal with the Liberators or did you kill them off before leaving?
---
None.
---
Pfft, you think that's bad? There was never a man like my Johnny.
---
Semi. 
---
Better damage per shot, allowing for less ammo expenditure. Means you don’t have to grind as much or as often to keep supplied.
---
Fair enough. Sufficiently clever raiders might be able to do it. Or Free States engineers. They’re pretty smart. If they could get their hands on lasers, I can see them being sufficiently worried about ammo to try to develop something more bang for their buck, or unlimited ammo at the cost of combat efficiency (crank to charge and fire, as implied in Fallout 4. Pretty sure there’s no fusion cell reload animation in the game, supporting the idea that they’re basically unlimited ammo). The Free States already made Appalachia’s handmades. 
---
Or The Responders! Rip a laser off an eyebot or broken Protectron they can’t get working again, amp it up, see above ammo concerns. That would also give The Responders an energy weapon, maybe to give to the Firebreathers, since it can take Scorched out at range, as that’s their MO, lacking the vaccine we have.
---
20 yards is 18 metres, don't invent spurious precision you dumb bot.
---
20 yards is 18.29 meters
---
Yeah it’s a pain in the neck. On pc: just hit enter. I think it has something to do with console control
---
That sounds fun!
---
same shot can happen with protectrons/ robobrains as far as i know
---
There we go! Bethesda! Listen to this person and give me my damn laser musket!
---
praise the lord and pass the ammunition is my favorite. It made a huge first impression because I had never heard it before. I was in the bog creeping with my noob ass through a busted up church, ghouls were starting to make the wake up sound and started to stand up all around in the murky dark. and that song came on. timing was perfect.
---
I've had this with legendary Liberators. Spawned into a server that must have just had a nuke cloud disappear, easy loot.
---
I'm selling a lot of apparel in a vendor, and armor / wepons in another... 
---
I like to stay classy in the appalachian, and I think everyone deserve to be well dressed to drink a tea at Whitespring. You, sir, deserve to be served a hot beer at the red rocket !
---
Kinky
---
i had to quit selling them no buyers now i just pitch them under 40%
---
Loot everything, craft lots of basic weapons and armor to unlock mods then scrap again, cook lots of food and drinks and find places with plenty of super mutants, they give great xp. Claim workshops and defend them.
---
Just finishing the quests will give a lot of xp as well including the overseers personal holotapes.
---
Awesom idea, maybe a mystical ghoul this time
---
definately not all. find a lot of their bodies during the quest. but the hoptapes never account for the entire group so maybe more than just the one guy.
---
Never wondered that
---
Buff psycho. More like...

Psychobuff.

Google says it's 18.288 and I refuse to round up,
---
Also equal to 0.0113636 miles.
---
Haha. Nice One. I Thought About Using That Too!
---
I did say some mate! The pale rider was the best, and oddly the one I saw most complaints about. 
---
That one with the hair or with guns stuck ffs lol.
---
But does he live in a van?
---
Ha, maybe someone on the server hacked and made a phobia mod, you know like those ones you would find for fallout 4
---
I really like the idea, they do have a certain attitude. I love the way they stroll along when chillin' reminds me of that early Micky Mouse animation Steamboat Willy?
---
Were the trappers the only group to escape en masse? I assume the trappers on the island in far harbour are the descendants of them? 
---
Might seem like a daft question, but there has been a lot of lore bending in 76 lol.
---
Bethesda need to fix it but I dont use it not that much but still effects me
---
Can't argue that, ones that don't give you rank ups and are post are worthless.
---
i dont get it
---
Is your camp near west Tek because that would be a long walk with that much weight.
---
He has his own pack mule slave
---
whahhahahah nice picture, you look like a lovely couple
---
I usually go semi auto on my handmade, but switch it up sometimes. Going auto takes twice as many shots, but sometimes feels like it's more effective to me.
---
ok?
---
How many have you named?
---
I did a run about 2 hrs ago and was all protectrons and I mean alot probably 30+ and alot of legendarys.
---
Was after a nuke had been dropped and worn off there, as I went to leave and go back to the shops of whitesprings I heard robots again I was only just past the tennis courts.
---
When I came back another 30 or so had respawned literally 15 seconds after I left.
---
I agree, it is a joke! If you have high ground, you win. You can see their name tag but they cannot see yours. There are so many other games that do pvp better than 76, mainly since this game was not exactly designed from scratch to be multiplayer. 
---
There should be dedicated servers too. For solo/duo/teams  as a 4 man team will always beat 1-3 hands down
---
What about under an orange colored sky?
---
I lost 50 pounds of junk
---
Good idea
---
I really like this idea. Also its a bit of peacocking for me as well. Gotta think twice about running up on a person when they "Want" to be seen.
---
Is that a bug or by lore there is something in it that can see you?
---
Can you send me what you wrote?
---
One good gameing PC is good enough for me not two even if there were not gameing pcs 2 is to much
---
1 inch is exactly 25.4 mm, by law.
---
So 1 Yard (36 inches) is exactly 914.4 mm
---
20 Yards is exactly 18288 mm, or 18.288 m like google says.
---
but "be like 20 yards" is actually 20 metres.  the idiot converter-bot keeps inventing spurious precision.
---
The ghouls definitely have some region/faction based clothing. If you go by the camping tents in Flatwoods where the ghouls spawn, at least one is in a torn up firefighter or cop outfit. And I feel like I may have even seen a miner ghoul? But yeah, I agree, scorched need more variety than Mr. Redshirt.
---
You've put far more thought into this than I😂
---
But I didn't know any of that thanks for the knowledge.
---
 It's possible to run multiple instances on a single PC.
---
im not entirely sure about that but i think you can buy the crafting plans from the brotherhood vendorbots 👍🏼
---
Seems like some folks didn't learn anything about time travel consequences...

[Doc Brown dislike that.]
---
So he's counting as an Alien now.. he didn't last time I photo ID'd him when this identical challenge was posed.
---
Am not a heavy gun dude but most of the the people I have seen that have heavy gun build  use 50 cal
---
You have to see the second pic he posted
---
Yes bro and if you did not do the dlc yet you have alot of cool content to play now
---
What really gets me is that initially they said backpacks would work in Power Armor.
---
And that was a 'mistake'. They let it sit for a while week and didn't think to mention it until the next article. That's a pretty major error of communication that affects a significant amount of the player base. They couldn't have mentioned it sooner than that?
---
I honestly wouldn't have been as upset if I found out it was not so later that day instead of after a week of hype an reworking my build. But they didn't deem it important enough to correct quickly.
---
oh okey were can i see that?
---
Picture #2
---
RNG.  The first letter stands for "random".
---
If the game drops to 25 on amazon, i'll be grabbing another key to make a mule account.
---
They confirmed it was a bug a while ago.
---
What are you? Some guy who doesn't like the answer to the question he asked?
---
I didn't make the law, and I didn't make Bethesda take the cheap loophole.
---
Game should have chat.
---
Reason it doesn't, is the reasons I mentioned.
---
If you don't believe me, go back and google it.
---
oh ... now i understand :D looks cozy though :D
---
Cool
---
I have the money but I’m not buying stuff after I’ve already bought the game, especially after the massive price drop. They don’t deserve it either, considering all the time that’s passed and there’s still the odd dupe exploit and tonnes of bugs and glitches.
---
I could be a billionaire and I still wouldn’t buy atoms. It’s the principal.
---
On the hyperlinks he has on the post, they’re kinda easy to miss
---
If there were no Poster and a bed instead you could say it's quiet romantic somehow.
---
Yeah I have 560 in excavator with radicool and 14 strength. That’s still a decent amount considering you aren’t using PA but still not as good as excavator.
---
Really? I just saw one in someone's camp the other day
---

“[PS4] H: Caps W: 3* weightless hvy combat armor set”

Then it gave me and error
---
I see you’ve encountered the Church of Squatch. Unfortunately, you missed the morning ritual.
---
Doesn't matter, you can't sell, trade or drop them.
---
Halloween is better.
---
I'd definatly recommend Batteries Included over Portable Power, drops all Energy Ammo weight which includes Fusion Cores.
---
They go down to 0.3 so you can carry 10 for the weight of 3 normally.
---
Maybe the H: Caps at the end
---
Probably a glitch where the server hasn’t loaded your damage buffs. Bethesda just ducking sucks at stability dude. But 500 damage is enough to one or two-shot enemies
---
Adrenaline? or your health just increased above 20%
---
Put the wants first?
---
are they very different about the condition degrade and their needs for repair?
---
Yeah thats normal on the market
---
Oh! That's correct. I just equipped and it went to 944
---
Ok imma try it this is the second time it screwed up for me
---
I've thought this too, it would make things more efficient
---
Yeah except Bethesda hasn’t gotten around to it yet. But they will. They basically have gotten around to everything that they can put on the atom shop. Eventually perk loadputs will be part of the game. Trust me. We just need to keep making noise. We get drowned out by stupid ass requests.
---
There's a mod for that, PC only.
---
Perk Loadout Manager

Me too :&lt; I bought this trash three times.
---
It's pretty cool
---
Now you don’t have to worry about your stash being full and being over-encumbered
---
There are many cards I don't ever touch, only have them through card packs. would love to trade in my unused cards or disable them so it makes swapping easier/faster.
---
Ok, you should ask a moderator then :/
---
Pretty sure the only ones left are people that had them before the patch, i could be wrong and maybe they undid it but i distinctly remember some people being pretty mad about not being able to anymore after patchnotes.
---
Unless if you revive him and still leave the liberators
---
Down by the river?
---
I had hoped someone would answer this, take my upvote good sir or madame!
---
I’d say it looks like a shrine to the squatch
---
I'd fix it by keeping the damage the same, but introduce receiver mods that give it automatic fire.
---
Well I'll be damned lol we need that for consoles
---
Thank you God Howard! Lol
---
you come out of that sounding like a fucking buffoon, you realize. Seriously. go back and reread your inept, inane comments... pathetic stuff. I hope you're literally a child. At least that would provide a modicum of an excuse.
---
Come on traps!!!
---
There is a story if you find all the holotapes and notes showing how the leader of the gourmands was progressing down a path that he wouldn’t be able to come back from, including eating one of his fellow gourmands, being exiled and going completely insane.
---
It isn't too hard to find those as mods.  And yes, absolutely worth it.  If I log on with Excavator Power Armor, I get an additional 100 lbs until I exit the PA, giving me 530 weight limit.
---
100 lbs is 45.4 kg
---
That could be a big help. Get the cores out of my stash and then I can make room for some of my meds if I remove Traveling Pharm perk, which would give me an extra three slots for something like Slugger.
---
Omg I just noticed that he is using him as a pack mule, I saw him trading with himself but I couldn’t put 2 and 2 together lol.
---
Your triggered emotion amuses me.

Uh.. Im getting killed in right now.. Right now in ro2. Chat, voice and a tiny tiny company. The base.  One example of how you think your country's laws effect mine. The answer is very few and cripples are not the majors. Get out of here with your straw man.

So, when was RO2 released?

And what country do you think I'm from?

Always use protection a fat man should do it.
---
Anti armor legendary effects and perks have worked on energy weapons since the first energy weapon buff like 4 patches ago. Tested it myself. Definitely a thing lol.
---
I’m not 100% but I think they were most prominently build to combat stealth troops because some of the assaultrons themselves can turn invisible.
---
3rd world of corse. Prob britan post brexit.. And idk to the other.. Years ago. Best fps ever?? Yes and probably

In all seriousness I’m quite sick of them reusing music from fallout 3, they did it in 4 also and now in this. There is so much music they could choose from and yet they repeat songs we’ve heard thousands of times. It’s really irritating since I no longer have the radio on because of it
---
Other players shouldn’t be able to hurt it either
---
Never seen it since playing mate.
---
I suggested such an idea and got downvoted. Take my upvote and hopefully you make it to hot.
---
thanks for sharing. how do i unsee it though?
---
Make cranberry relish mate you get loads at the farm across from watoga station.
---
I agreed until fallout 4 came out
---
The ambient music is fallout 4 is spectacular, the slow piano when you discover major locations really sets the tone I just wish there was more. 
---
Depressing with a slight pinch of hope. Rebuild Renew is the perfect example of these themes
---
Why can’t they just take 15min of their time to add it to the loot table? Can’t take much longer then that right? 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I just don’t know why, when you get a level one card from a pack, and you already have a level one of same said card, you don’t get the option to level it up. Doesn’t make any sense
---
Any level 21 deathclaw that's not on deathclaw island is most likely a random encounter spawn. The bunker icon just north of fissure site prime has a chance to spawn one, and from there to the northern mire are several more random encounter nodes.
---
I have one that appears at my Base sometimes.
---
The top two tiers do not drop.
---
Right.
---
I'm from the US, and I'm talking about US law, which applies to Zenimax, a US company.

And I'm talking about a law that went into effect after RO2 came out, but before 76 did.

---
#imnotracistbut I’ve been wondering why 3/4 of the people on my servers for the last few weeks have been named yoshita or tayata etc, I thought maybe this game was just super popular in Japan.
---
I have to admit, when visiting Japanese players vendors, 9/10 their camps are these elaborate, well lived in, highly decorative masterpieces of engineering.
---
It’s pretty awesome to check them out
---
But all the other underarmor have shielded. And the casual is supposed to be an event reward. :/
---
This , or just a central hub for all traders to open up shop and sell wares, then pack up and move on if one is done with sales.  The amount of caps you burn in a server just to check out some shops only with 40 regular no star guns or shitty vault tec jumpsuits is crazy. Not saying those people can't sell those items. It would just make it way less irritating to see all those shops next to all the good ones without having to spend 33 caps everytime.
---
Cant get the fourth if don’t have the third.  And third is bugged.
---
It took them months to put the bos combat armor mods back in.
---
But they can, until the camp is fully loaded the game doesnt load the camp tag on the animal. So people just see a red health bar deathclaw they can vats
---
I use rads to cap my max health and use both 1 rank of born survivor and 3 ranks of serendipity, I also use radicool as that increases strength with rads which also helps with melee, but if you get yourself some rads you won’t need to worry about born survivor increasing your health beyond what you want and it makes for a good rescue perk so def worth having
---
So many ppl on the market have mules. Nothing new here :D
---
All of your links are to reddit?? Why is that
---
I can make the 3rd tho . So the game just doesn’t register the 3rd I guess? Yeah, still a minor fix for them 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Technically the shielded one could drop from Queen of the Hunt providing that you are one of the lucky few for whom the dailies in The Mire are not bugged.
---
However for this one to drop one would need to learn the previous tier one and that one does not drop.
---
Therefore I believe SoL applies here.
---
Shhhhh
---
Two PCs... twice... Oh my sweet summer child :D

Oh yeah lol he probably only has one pc but it’s a really good one

Ha. Ha ha. Ha.

Beth does exactly what every MMORPG does ... constantly buffing and nerfing, there is nothing wrong with it.
---
Real talk tho. Why the hell would Bethesda take this feature away. It’s not like it was super easy to get a pet in the first place. Just dumb
---

It's all a cap sink. They want us to waste caps. They think it will fix the in game economy. It wont, but it is what it is.

I did it for the 20 revives trophy. There was a guy afk and it died 7 times for me. A martyr.
---
Seen that a few times. Also had a 3 star legendary eye bit that ran away. Had to chase it all around the golf course.
---
which do you like better?
---
I use the cryolator not for it's damage but it's utility. Slows down everything, sbq, alpha, imposter. Ammo isn't a problem it's that it brakes down too fast
---
So what is this suppose to say?
---
Is dog food as popular at street vendor food kiosks as Fallout 76 makes it out to be? Honestly, even serving pork and beans from one of these stands seems strange to me.
---
You need the correct perks first, which you already know, i assume, then you need to find a random encounter location where a mob can spawn in, then you have to be lucky that its a SOLO spawn, with no other mobs around.
---
The Pet you want to tame has to be less than halve of your characters level.
---
It fits in pretty well with the raider faction the Pack from fallout 4's Nuka World DLC. They wear quite bright and colourful apparel.
---
If you're really that concerned over a few caps, chances are that you're not the type of person to visit too many camps anyway.  If it's too cheap you just create a super inexpensive alternative towards new players discovering the whole map very quickly, which is poor for gameplay. You also need cap sinks in place in order to prevent caps from becoming inflated. If everyone has too many caps, then prices go up. Caps are already not difficult to get to begin with, so trying to reduce this cap sink is just... petty. If you really want traffic, don't build your camp on the edges of the map. You don't have to build in the center-ish area where a lot of people do, but don't expect people to pay 45 caps to travel to you either.
---
You're not really focused in school,are you?
---
Automatic has by far the better damage per second. But that’s not everything
---
Depends on your build :) 
---
Raider is good for sniper build cuz it gives Pre, Ag and luck 
---
BoS is good for melee cuz it gives Str and End.... and so on
---

I saw a few Vault 76 jumpsuits for sale with what I can only assume is the shielded mod? I don't quite remember the stats, but it gave bonuses to four S.P.E.C.I.A.L points.

But I can make the protective one I think 🤷🏻‍♂️ 1ch , 1int and 1 luck. I need to check that
---
I got 3 to 4 days worth of scrips with one loot server. Best thing I got was a bloodied gamma. But tons of crap 1 star weapons. But one time got the message that the server was going down, all of a sudden got a aae handmade, TS something railway, combat sentinal bolstering chest, and metal unyelding cavalier. Didn't leave the server till I was kicked, only problem I did get 3 star sentinal wood piece from the purveyor and didn't have enough scrips to turn it in so it became a 1 star when I was booted.
---
It's quite common. You only need a laptop that meets minimum specs to run a mule, not a whole new gaming rig.

Protective or shielded :) can’t remember if resistant has some

I definitely agree with you, I guess I'm just trying to point out that there's always going to be an inherent imbalance with RPG weapon and asset leveling on a game that's being pushed so hard into the FPS style. I don't think it's something that should be uprooted in ten seconds it's more of good for thought.
---
At the end you’ve got all the perk cards!
---
But Bethesda comes with *Legendary Player* mode, you get a special power of such kind for returning back to level **1**. Pretty cool.
---
It's a glitch. You can't pick it up because if you check it's already in you inventory. Less said about it the better really ;)
---
Bloodied .50 build is. Sbq melter. Another legendary builder posted his details last week, I copied them, and it's amazing how much damage this. 50 does.
---
yes definitely! I just jumped back into the game after a few months and the amount of prep, crafting, farming, grinding you have to do before you can even embark on a quest/event is still infuriating. a loadout would help with QoL alot.
---
Same here on Xbox. I assume they're is a new dupe exploit that crashes the server when it gets really bad
---
NZ servers too. So theoretically we're all in the same weird little universe together (though i see more Japanese players than Aussies)
---
Absolutely. My gf and I suffered performance hits since the last few patches. We both run completely different rigs. One using fx 8350, r290x and one using Ryzen 1700x and gtx 1060. The game needs a serious performance patch
---
Awesome post and Q&amp;A there mate! Interesting and funny to hear from a native.
---
Keep it up!
---
Screw this, I'm going home where the road is the dusty-ist
---
No.
---
I thought so, I’m not surprised but I am disappointed. Still playable but I splurged on a 1080 for a reason lol. Average FPS right now is 35. I’m getting a bit of eye ache from it too.

The second one is straight up Resident Evil-esque.

It's called a GTA tryhard. One that got banned from Online and can't buy another account so *it* has to use the already-existing 76 account.
---
Buy the deathclaw rug in remembrance
---
Constant buffing and nerfing really makes for an inconsistent play style. Especially when they're introducing some pretty "we're all on a level playing field" type modes and structures. I get every other MMORPG uses a system like this but they all get insane buffs and builds that ALWAYS end with God Tier invincibility, that is until they get too high of a level.
---
All it does is give people a very Borderlands feel where all of a sudden you're no longer a match with anything or anyone and it's not very survival or wasteland immersive. If the same food/water and aid works linearly, why shouldn't the equipment? 
---
It's more about asking if preemptively avoiding Death Knights and similar god tier builds and classes would be a good idea. This is a game where you're only supposed to be a run of the mill human just like the other 1000000+ people you might come across. Epic level plot armor doesn't make sense if we're all "Each other's NPC's" and if you can just one shot kill people anyways, it just makes it to where people of higher levels have a distinct stat advantage that makes no real sense in a survival game.
---
I'm interested, as I have about 40+ useless nuclear keycards. But no Discord. That good enough?
---
RNG doesn't go cause a result to swing from .65%  chance to 60% chance. That's not random. That would be a fluke if the code hasn't changed.
---
I'm still running 50-80 with a rx460 4gb and an i5 6400
---
Huh. I know they can't see me when I've procced Chameleon, so that's unexpected.
---
I don’t believe serendipity works in power armor. So if you life in it, I probably wouldn’t use it
---
So I’m probably cousins to half of you. I don’t live in WV, but one half of my family is mountain and the other is piedmont.
---
I LOVE West Virginia and mostly because I love wildness. It’s a gorgeous state with hardy people. 
---
Ya know what I liked is how the economy in Appalachia has been replaced with a tourist economy. I think of WV could reorient towards outdoors stuff and adventure tourism it’d be a really great state
---
Hey, thanks man. I appreciate the insight.
---
In a t51b PA I got oneHITed by the Imposter Sheepdquatch...
---
The main promblem is that nobody activate the pylons and the boss is immortal as it should be. I can not activate all 3 alone...
---
The unthinkable amount explosive eyebots is not funny either...
---
Great, thanks dude
---
I rarely fail that event.  Everything seems to be working when I play it. Most the time I have to take all 3 conduits  myself because nobody else seems to bother.
---
 The conduits are supposed to hurt you, that's the point.
---
 Not trying to be mean but those 13 players are awful.
---
 I usually finish it with me and a small handful of other random players.
---
 I also finished the Arctos mission each time as long as other player show up. I don't see any of the bugs that you see, what system do you play on?
---
No problem. If you find it someplace just let me know, I’ll look there on xbox.
---
nice idea! but id limit it to double cards only
---
Well, there's the Fruit of the Looms we spawn with.
---
The player has to be downed, not dead. The icon on his head will show a pulse. If it is a skull he cannot be revived
---
Yeah man, you got it.
---
Thank you very much!!
---
Protective is 2CHR, 1INT, 1LCK.
---
If you can craft it then there is a chance it may drop for you from Queen of the Hunt.
---
The way things are set up it would seem that originaly it was planned to drop from either of the dailies in The Mire however currently the levelled list is only correctly referenced by Queen of the Hunt.
---
As far as I can see is not linked with 'chance none' but someone with more expertise might want to have a look to confirm.
---
Form ID is LLS\_Recipe\_Mod\_UnderArmor\_Casual\_Mk5\_Chance \[LVLI:003D6542\]

Just feels like this is Beth at the office 🤷🏻‍♂️😂
---
I’ll check you out I collect clothing
---
It’s a hard world out there! xD
---
So i just started up every game i have on steam.. And Minecraft(kinda just to see) chat in all of them.
---
Escape from tarkov was the only..well russian
---
You can’t kill them for luring mobs
---
Is it legal?
---
Yeah I have two copies of the game and run it from 1 PC. Makes storing Caps and transferring items way easier. More common than you think
---
Hey its me again! Just dont buy a toaster and expect pizzza! Huzzah. What are you guys like 16?
---
That's interesting. Does having rads alter the point at which born survivor triggers? By that I mean, if you normally have say 200 HP, survivor would trigger at 40. If the rads dropped your HP to 100, would survivor now trigger at 20?
---
Must be tricky holding your rad level where you want, since you're constantly taking them from different sources.
---
U doing it right. I dont know why u cant revive
---
Should just be a normal stimpak. If you don’t have one it doesn’t give you the option.
---
Doesn't say anything about PA in the description. Is it a bug?
---
That uses your material right? I offered to do that for my buddy’s but never did go thru with it
---
I almost exclusively use diluted RadAway, Rad X and healing salve but I carry six stimpaks just for reviving
---
Yep, incredible architecture but often impossible to meet a single person who has a mic on and speaks English. I’ve met two in six months.
---
Flog
---
Hahhahah your 10 mill.
---
I get that Bethesda didn’t want NPCs cos they wanted us to role player wastelanders, but I can be difficult when most of Vault 76s ‘best and brightest’  can’t understand each other
---
I had no idea you could open multiple I gotta try this now have serums I want on an alt.
---
Yes, they do! Because they were developed and/or sold before the law went into effect, they didn't have to care.
---
Some might ignore it too, that's possible. It's just a human law, not some sort of physics.
---
Other big games from AAA publishers are also skipping text chat entirely ( https://old.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/ahifcz/official_comment_on_ingame_text_chat/ ) while other games from the same publisher (Apex Legends) has Voice, Text, TTS, and Speech to Text. 
---
It's a mixed bag.
---
I'm only saying that it's possible that 76 is delaying text chat due to either avoiding having to comply with the law, or until they develop a fully complying solution.
---
They could also have decided after "Looking into it" ( https://www.pcgamer.com/bethesda-is-looking-into-adding-text-chat-for-fallout-76/ ) that they don't care.
---
¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
I seen a YouTube video the other day that made me think of that. And I’d hate to admit it but I’m not that crafty to figure that shit out till they start blasting on me.
---
I have trouble keeping track if we're "Wild and Wonderful" this year or "Open for Business."  And . . . never eat the "past expiration date" pepperoni rolls in Bartow.
---
I was reading all these to say almost just that. Except I was thinking maybe one named Steve hidden as a side mission chained up somewhere waiting to be reached. Maybe Steve could even have his own pet cat watching over him. Or maybe a statue or a book or poster of the "Legends of Steve" put in by Bethesda. RIP Steve, I hope to see your return to the wasteland.
---
Wait, you inspect the item before you pick it up? Routinely? 
---
You don't loot the body and THEN inspect? I always run strait over and mash that button to loot the corpse.
---
They need more emotes like ‘come to my camp’ or ‘here’s some free stuff’ or ‘I don’t want to group up but can you help me kill this thing real quick’, emotes are universal, won’t have to worry about language barriers
---
Pretty sure a Flog is a thunderbox.
---
Nvm I already got one.
---
So that’s about what I’ve concluded. There’s so many different reasons to send an invite it’s hard telling till you add them and find out.. or ignore em
---
How much ammunition do you have to burn?
---
That’s what I thought. I used to use it but then one day I read that and I started to notice it. You can look it up if you want. I’m assuming the card meant to say (no power armor)
---
Bug and pumpkin grenades also. They cause a lot more hurt than people realise. Watched someone kill themselves with a bug grenade try to fend off bloodbugs lol.
---
It was a bug. 
---
All headgear had 1DR added by mistake, so they removed it as fast as they could because it was a minor benefit to players.
---
Thanks for the link, this'll make a good read for me to pass the time as work today haha. 
---
Especially interesting because whenever I've suggested scopes for them before people have always said 'buT tHaT's NoT rEaLiStIc' so I was lead to believe that they never had them in history. When I first got my hands on a few back in beta I was continually scrapping them because I just assumed they would have one.
---
Ah right, thanks clearing that up. Time to cut it lose then ;)
---
yep, everything you build uses your material
---
I’ll check later :)
---
Well, in one of the Unsolved Mystery Quests, there's mention of a former Gourmand, and while he didn't become one, he knew somebody (actually, it'd be 2 people in the end) who would.
---
https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/
---
Yoo the SMMG was such a cool design, I'd actually like to see it somewhere other than the Divide, for at least it'd tie the lore together a bit.
---
I wish the Handmade had the chunkier aesthetics of the Chinese Assault, made it feel more Fallout have the semi-fictional design. Could pass on the R91 though I was never proper into that one apart from the Infiltrator/Perferator.
---
Lol I don't watch the footy but I know enough people to sorta understand.
---
The dominator series is the invisible one.
---
Not my Fo4 char, he was OP from a life of eating Buffout and Yao Gui meat. Constant dmg buff and like 30 Endurance, nothing could stop him.
---
I built a set of Ultracite Power Armour and a couple of days later a complete second set of Armour appeared in my inventory.  Fallout 76 is a fickle mistress, eh?
---
Sounds to me like you'll just cry and make a Reddit post about it...
---
Got one in my vending machine... for 1000 caps.
---
Mwahahaha!
---
Playing in NZ. I have seen Japanese players, but rarely. I do see the same players all the time. Trying to server hop sucks.
---
The Snally has eyes on his lower neck?
---
Didn't they also remove damage condition for gas masks?
---
Genius
---
Like a nub. I dont care and im no lazy fuck either. Ill spend all this ammo... Just means i have to get more later :)
---
You still need a separate account for each instance. A lot of people have bought a second copy for this purpose.
---
Because that requires effort and good programming, same as having some kind of account storage to switch weapons between characters, guilds, and generally bug fixes.
---
Yeah its temperamental lol
---
But, you want them to give YOU something for free. 
---
And how does the price drop of the game matter to you?  Are you second guessing your purchasing choice?  Are you jealous of those that paid less than you?  Does that mean you’d also be jealous of a kid that got it as a Christmas gift from his parents?
---
It honestly sounds like you’re jealous of kids that have more free time than you. 
---
Is that it?
---
That still doesn't fix this broken-ass PVP system that allows people in pacifist to become easy pickings for jackasses with TSE weapons that deal stupid amounts of "slap" damage who can't take no for an answer, or picks a fight with someone willing to fight back only to go after their teammates. Something similatto this person has happened to me, where after an event some loser with a complex started shooting at people and shot one of my teammates who had no problem shooting back, only for this overpowered asshole to one-shot me and the test of my team while we were on our pipboys looking through our loot. Three of us had pacifist on. This should not be happening.
---
I'm a heavy gunner and I swapped out my 50. Cal because I've got an explosive gatling gun, explosive lmg, and a two shot auto nade launcher.
---
This game Needs the Winchester P94 Plasma Caster!
---
Oh I see that's unfortunate
---
Gatling hands down. Have that and an LMG with explosive effect and they both melt enemies and mobs insanely fast.
---
Are you here to argue against a game... Hol up.. Let me save that tag. Are you here to argue legal. Seems like a... Just a cunt tbh. Why are you so worked up?
---
https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html
---
Plug in different information for your answers. 
---
I use a bloodied plasma Gatling on the queen that moves her health bar noticeably and an explosive prime LMG for minions in nuked areas and the silos. I believe the Gatling DPS is higher than both of those (actually it’s the highest I believe) but I prefer the feel of the weapons I use.
---
Its a vida game dog. Whats really got you down?
---
No power armor, wearing that is just putting a bigger target on your back. 
---
1) Easier to see
---
2) You’re loud AF
---
3) With certain armor, perks, and the armor backpack you can get much more DR and ER
---
PA in PvP to me usually just means you like giving away free caps, junk and aid
---
3* with some powered, it’s a BOS Assassin Sent Set for my Rifle build, I have a Set that’s ASS CAV for when I sometimes use melee
---
r/ihadastroke
---
Thanks for the heads up...saved me from wasting three points.
---
Neutral. I don't hate the idea but i don't love it either
---
It was a joke....I mean just about every area near train depots....
---
They all have a near by spot with tons of loot and junk to sell.....
---
i just wish we could hide the cards we rarely use it would make swapping card around a ***"LITTLE BIT"*** less painless
---
I'm still waiting for my rainbow unicorn 50 cal skin that shoots confetti
---
You okay a lot of PvP I’m assuming? Those would be great sets for that. What do you think is a good PvE set also since the assassin part isn’t needed so often
---
That happened to me once, and almost every bit dropped a lvl 1 legendary....this was back before legendary vendor was even mentioned so of course I sold em all at Whitespring.
---
If only I had anticipated the future....I would have set up shop outside the vault and equipped every vault dweller as they made their way out!
---
Depends, now I’m thinking I don’t really need the ASS perk for non PVP, imo it depends on what build, like low health and your a melee build then unyielding, if you like low health but a Guns build then maybe bolstering and high health is vanguard, other prefixes are kinda useless imo.
---
Use player vendors. I’m on PC and I would do it for free unless you want a whole set and I’m supplying the materials. I may just make a whole set and mod it out just for the hell of it and put it in my shop
---
I had a yao guai die from fall damage once too.... i left the game, came back a day later and...... HE WAS THERE AGAIN.... SENT FROM HEAVEN!
---
That’s not realistic but shooting a mininuke ten feet away from you and not dying of cancer within months is?
---
I run unyielding on my new guy
---
+15 to charisma at low hp? Okay! Haha
---
Been attempting to tame all week....
---
Nothing but pacify.
---
When does the tame selection come up?
---
Hit a nuke at Whitespring and tag as many glowing ones as you can...
---
Dog diagnosed with lymphoma yesterday.
---
Guess it's just getting to me and keeping me from avoiding bait.
---
Technical issues are better....  Most of the time.
---
I have an Unyielding BoS Sent and Cav set that I use for pretty much anything, PvP or PvE. That way I can mix what build I want to go with. But I’m wondering what has spiked vanguard and bolstering in the market. 
---
Oh I have 1 chameleon Sent Arm in my set just because I like the invisible for stealth
---
Love that idea!
---
this sounds great but im curious for the sake of running out of special points, is it viable to switch out things like hacker or lock picker or even the crafting perks until youre actually doing those things?
---
Emotes should be a part of the game because they are a part of communication. If there was a type chat I wouldn’t care, but they refuse to add one so other than using a mic, emotes are about all we have. They aren’t just cool things to have, they’re vital to non verbal team play.
---
I brought the price drop up because someone brought up money. I paid $50 and the price dropped severely after Bethesda realised how bad a job they’d done and that it was the only way they’d sell more copies. That’s bullshit, plain and simple.
---
He was really bad at his job
---
I run a mix with +1 perception or +1 agility on most pieces with a dense BOS AP regent chest piece.  All three star but I also have a complete set of unyielding I use as well, I just have swapped and upgraded the pieces as they have dropped. Three of my pieces are also sentinel for damage reduction.
---
This is one bug that should have been in the lowest priority to fix after all the rest of the bugs had been fixed.
---
Felt like a kick in the teeth patching this when they did.
---
Would not mind one bit if the incompetent version control guy made a doo-doo and reverted this fix instead of, you know, reintroducing a pernicious exploit or any of his other usual shenanigans.
---
evil genus this one is...... and I love it
---
There is that, but I have Duplicate picklocks, and Hacker
---
The theme park ones tend to wear the location uniforms and there are Responder scorched in the Forest area. There's a few examples of localised scorched but I agree they could throw some more in there. Definitely faction related ones.
---
Haha, I’ve had that spawn as well at West Tek and wondered the same thing.
---
Puny human can't take mini nuke expulsion.  Human weak super mutant strong.
---
I waited a long time to get the game. And I'm enjoying it quite a bit. Community is outstanding. There are still plenty of bugs. But nothing game breaking for me as of yet.
---
Looks good but swap out perks for picking locks with tank killer as needed.
---
1. Remove all Shotgunner Perk cards unless the build has to use shotguns for some reason. Can replace them with Travelling Pharmacy and/or Bandolier.
---
2. Remove all Picklock Perk cards in favour of Rank 3 Rifleman, Long Shot and Tank Killer cards. Sniper is not really that important if you can get arm mods that stabilise your aim.
---
3. Worth keeping 3 points in Endurance for swapping cards based on location and situations. I have Good Doggy and Dromedary for eating and drinking (dog food and purified water are hotkeyed, so I don't have to even open up my PipBoy)
---
4. Action Boy/Girl not really that important in non-VATS builds. "Powered" legendary effect on gear can fill in that gap if need more AP regen. Mister Sandman is highly situational card and I'm not sure if it works at night while inside of caves and other indoor locations. Could use Thru-Hiker instead for QoL bonus.
---
Removing legendary effects for pvp would probably do the trick. That and sending the damn marsupial mutation to hell. I know it's fun, but it totally takes away immersion and pvp fairness.
---
shit THAT'S why no one replies to my voice chats
---
I was lucky i have done it twice and both time no one showed up.
---
I actually carry 50ish throwing knives with me. I really like them, even if the hitboxes on them are.... vibrant.
---
Sneak attacks help. Stealth in general actually. It’s either that or power armor up and start bashing their heads with melee. It’s a hard stretch where you are as the game is pushing you towards the harder areas.
---
Don't fight tough enemies unless the quest you're on requires you to do so. Farm lower level areas in the Forest, Ash Heap and Toxic Valley. One your damage is high enough and you got all the gear and perk cards you wanted, move to Savage Divide/The Mire. Avoid Cranberry Bog, unless you quest there.
---
Any time you're attacked by a high level enemy or a Scorchbeast just disconnect and join a new server. Or try escaping.
---
It certainly is. I usually run Glow Sight or Butcher's Bounty in normal play. I basically only have the lockpick/hack perks to use during Silos. A few minutes saved doesn't sound like much, but silos area major part of the endgame so you end up running them alot, so it adds up.
---
For the hacker perks i slot out Batteries. If it were any other perk, i'd forget to swap back most of the time. But i can't forget about it cause usually i can't sprint without it kappa.
---
Sounds like a bug and not a feature. Asking how to abuse bugs is frowned upon, my dude.
---
Some people will always hate on it. That's how the Internet works, sadly.
---
But those of us who have been playing since the beginning, and those who are willing to give it a chance, know that things are taking a good direction and Bethesda seems to be working very hard.
---
you need normal stimpaks, not supers or diluted
---
No, it’s a bug that happens once in a while and it’s fun but seems random. My teammate had that happen to his dragon and he was quite happy until he had to reload.
---
I could be wrong, but anything "crippable" is considered a limb in this game.
---
It sure does.
---
But if they put the crayons on their armor, what are all the surviving Marines gonna eat?
---
I use whatever armor I have as long as it gives me a weight reduction perk because I'm usually carrying a bit too much.   Of course, my play style is more Miracle Max than Mad Max.   My vendor shop is almost always underpriced. Except for the two comics, they are probably not priced accurately as I couldn't find them listed in my latest issue of Overstreet.
---
I refused to give the game the time of day when it first released (and just as well). However, with the recent improvements, I picked it up cheap and am ever so glad I did. I have already sunk over 76 hours into the game (got the achievement thingy that told me).
---
Overall, it still isn't perfect, but it is nowhere near as bad as I expected it to be. Bugs and crashes have been very, very few and far between for me.
---
Vats and pipboy are essential parts of the franchise. Admittedly vats has been modified, but I wouldn't want the same for the pipboy. 
---
It wouldn't be fallout without one holding everything you need. 
---
The combat is fine most of the time, and I wouldn't want it to be more 'generic fps', but whatever. Not like any of this would be implemented lol.
---
He probably does
---
Been happening for a while now. I don't even bother with the event anymore. I used to camp on an acid node because I would hit that event every time I saw it come up.
---
No you're not, because it's not an exploit it's a bug. Exploit is something a player does to a bug, look up [the definition](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/exploit) (the use of a bug or flaw in game design to a player’s advantage or to the disadvantage of other players) and educate yourself before you take a high ground stance on something you're wrong about.
---

---
They are born that way, knowing how short their lives are 😂
---
Yep, It happened to me last week too, definitely a bug
---
yeah i haven’t done it in a month or so. figured i’d give it a whirl this morning but, alas, empty. 
---
how does one @bethesda? lol.
---
how can someone really bad at his job become legendary? 
---
unless....did he have a legendary bad boss?
---
Why restart when you can Ctrl-Alt-Del, open task manager, click on Fallout 76, then in bottom right click end process.
---
What platform you play on? I have some weight reduction armor laying around on characters that aren’t super popular to sell I can throw your way if that’s the biggest thing you look for :)
---
Version control isn't their strong suit.
---
I don’t mind spending the caps, but I wish there was a better way to understand what the person is selling before I spend those caps to FT there. Like, are there legendaries? Possibly a different slot to differentiate between armor and apparel (that would huge with me). Serums? Fusion cores, differentiated from ammo. Just brainstorming here.
---
Cryo is fine where it is, but i wouldn't say no to another buff.
---
The Flamer 'buff' was laughable though. It is still nigh unusable without unreasonable amounts of effort.
---
Similarly, .308 needs to be buffed for the sake of LMGs. man, is it soul crushing keeping those feed. it's not as bad as the flamer, but it's still pretty damn horrid.
---
Xbox this time around.
---
This is what pretty much every bloodied melee build does. There's a self explanatory reason for that.
---
Next:  used Sheepsquatch underwear in the vending machines
---
What’s your GT?
---
Well worth the read, good lord I needed that laugh.
---
Works for me on Xbox.
---
Thx for the feedback. One question: in inside areas a sniper rifle isn‘t that effective because you can‘t keep enemies in distances. So the shotgun should be more like a backup plan for these scenarios. Or should I use a midrange rifle im this situations, which profit from the rifleman perk?
---
Sleeping gives you a 5% XP buff? For like 1 hour I think, also some magazines and bobble heads give you XP buffs. Any cranberry food or drinks give you anywhere from like 3-10 xp buffs. But you need cranberry’s which are tough to get at lvl 30. Also a perk in charisma that gives you xp for being on a team tho!
---
I completely agree with everyone here. Now to solo the burrows. And by solo I mean die, badly
---
I know a couple guys with 2 xboxes that do this
---
Has less to do w/ rifle accuracy and more to do with the reducing the side effects. With Class Freak you basically get back 35-40 HP from Adrenal Reaction, 3 STR each from Bird Bones, Eagle Eyes, 3 INT from Marsupial, better chem usefulness from Healing Factor and the food/drink loss is less OMG-THERE-IS-A-GIANT-TAPEWORM-IN-MY-GUT and more you just eat/drink frequently.
---
The INT from Marsupial is the least important; the HP and STR (carry capacity) is more useful.
---
Still, I don't know 5 points of perks (Starched/Class) that can get you the power of Healing Factor, Marsupial, Adrenal Reaction, Speed Demon. The QOL from Healing Factor, Marsupial and Speed Demon is just too handy; I'm not sure I can play without them any more.
---
Since when were camps invulnerable in survival mode?
---
My CAMP is near Mama Dolce's, so I get some canned stew pretty often, combined with sleeping I get a 10% boost.
---
I'm at work for the weekend.  I'll be online Monday evening.
---
I would certainly be up for this.
---
In fact, to be completely honest, I would be willing to pay for a large, complete DLC.
---
Yah that’s good, that’ll help over time for sure, best XP farm is west tek tho, probably close to around 40 or 50 super mutants. Probs too high level for you rn tho
---
Dang! Happening to a dragon would be awesome!
---
Yeah, that happened to me this week. Nothing in the collectors, and also like four mole miners total attacking.
---
My second character is a gunslinger and I really, really want more cool handguns. 50 cal, 5.56mm, 9mm, gimme them all!
---
Pvp is end game.   Just like every other online game.
---
Nah checked the rules and it didn't say anything about it. Isn't that Bethesda's motto? It's a feature not a big! :D
---
They are part of the game. Emotes are IN the game for free. 
---
Exactly which of the additional non-free emotes are so critical to your non-verbal communication?
---
And money was brought up because you brought up the extra time the ‘kids’ have to earn Atoms, because they don’t have to work. 
---
Think it through; let’s say it takes you one hour of playtime to earn 300 Atoms.  That would be a pretty amazing turnaround, since you seem to agree it takes a few days to earn 100 Atoms.
---
Do you make minimum wage at your job?  Because even at minimum wage with a 30% taxation, you’re earning $5.07 take home per your. 
---
Atoms cost $0.01 each, maximum.  
---
So, you’re whining because some kid is basically using his time to earn $3 per hour (and that’s an EXTREME projection), and you’re not. 
---
As far as your own free time?  You have plenty, but you choose to do other things. I guarantee you that if you trimmed it down to the basics, you’d have at least 10 hours a week to play, and that’s a low end estimate. 
---
But you do other things with your free time than just FO76.  And that’s to be expected. 
---
You’re coming across as a grumpy old jealous man.  Chill.
---
I can sneak by them without too much trouble with all the sneak perks and invisibility. But they do notice you alot easier than normal enemies.
---
You’re welcome!
---
Time to learn Japanese.
---
I am someone who pre-ordered the night it was announced, because I really wanted that helmet. I played in Beta and launch and all of that.  IMO: I was really excited when I first started playing, despite the bugs. However, those coupled with the overwhelming negativity made it kind of hard to enjoy for a while. I stopped playing for a couple months, and returned not too long ago.
---
I think it has come a very long way. No, not every single thing is fixed, but I don't know many games where everything is perfect either. 76 is far from unplayable. I think, judging from the Q&amp;A and the Inside the Vaults and all that, it's very obvious to me that the devs are trying their best to listen to us and do what they can, as well. I'll take that and be patient over a dev team that ignores us completely. Granted, I find myself technically running out of "things to do" but I realize this is because I am a very linear person (not sure if that is the right word) and without anymore main story quests to do, I feel a little lost/overwhelmed with "what now" and I know some other people are in a similar boat. But I see the roadmap and this past Wild Appalachia DLC and it was really fun. I have high hopes for the future.
---
Unfortunately, I think there will always be hate on it for a few reasons. Some people are still really mad about no Fallout 5 or a remastered 3/New Vegas. I understand disappointment but *good lord*. Another set of people also want to hate on it because... they think it's still trendy to do, I guess? I've met several people, even my own friends, who haven't touched the game (or even remotely looked into it) but still openly mock it because of the hate train that was so strong on release. They won't even entertain the idea of looking at the updates. It's really dumb.
---
Sorry for a little but of a ramble. I'm not particularly great at articulating myself.
---
Id prefer our own vault instance or a room in a vault but a vault set would be pretty cool
---
the last time i saw it was probably not long after release, and as far as i know you cant switch it on and off. it’s probably just so bugged that your chance of getting a notification is basically nonexistent
---
If you are rarely going to use PA like Me, don't worry about repairing it. after getting my excavator and and x-01 (the 2 I use) repaid to 200% back in like November, I never had to repair them again. and 5 fusion cores last me about a mouth. I'm going to go look at them now probably all busted
---
The OP was talking about a player seeing this data on their menu screen at character selection, not something floating in the air above everyone’s game avatars.
---
No problem :) just send me a message if you’re interested. Save me some weight and maybe help you up your armor specs :) 
---
P.S. it’s free, I’m not expecting caps or trades
---
funny they weigh less then bobby pins
---
I thought we only got the notification for other Players attacking our base, not mobs?
---
Pressumly one like a nasa control center lol
---
You cant destroy them unless you attack the owner. After you do then you can destroy turrets but as soon as he dies you can't destroy anything any more and you're getting shot by indestructible turrets
---
Depending how much dps you are putting out, white springs golf club took me from 25-50ish pretty quick.
---
This may take a few stims and roadways, and careful use of some choke points. Maybe stock up on nades for large groups.
---
i have to rely on reading about it on fallouts news site, but yeah it's pretty confusing in the atom shop
---
Double barrel combat shotgun could be cool. It's been in previous fallout and in fallout shelter so I dont see why not
---
You have a mic. Use it.
---
I have a problem with that skin too, i’m only able to access the red skin but not the blue one. :(
---
I tend to do that as well, but switch over to Inspirational once they’re on my team. 15% XP bonus is pretty nice. 
---
I had been using Born Survivor, but not a lot of people like that perk.
---
Well that sucks
---
Can one off you guys please explain in full to us older less tech savvy peaple how this is done plz lol
---
Either new or too much chems. Can't decide...
---
He probably needed it for an achievement.
---
Super mutants are obviously unionized. He was bad at his job and they couldn't fire him so the only place they could move was up!
---
It will be exploited. I've seen players joining and leaving teams in PvP to be invulnerable until they make their approach or just following a sneaking hostile knowing the can't be damaged but can emote to tell their compatriots where the hostile is.
---
Pure Genius
---
It sounds vaguely familiar, but my head is crammed with 20+ years of Fallout lore, so...
---
Its Kotaku, so par for the course I guess.
---
Human meat we eat,
---

Maybe they are just dissatisfied with your host qualities lol

---
Seems to happen if the server is stressed. The event at first worked fine for me last few times I did it this week. Then I ended up on a server where all camps loaded extremely slow and attacks took up to 2-3 secs to register in combat. Did B&amp;C event while on that server and all the compartments was empty. So, it seems to be connected to distressed servers not being able to spawn the loot. Also had several empty enemies there.
---
I just read a news article in this, and now I'm sad. I've also decided to use my next perk card on the taming card.
---
Give us the lever action shotgun and dragon breath reciever!
---
I don’t play survival, but that’s ridiculous. To be honest, the only CAMP item I think should be invulnerable ever is stash boxes.
---
Just seeing the F word like that made my stomach turn
---
Hahaha, if there is a better use for these free reddit coins I got, I don’t wanna know about it
---
Now imagine the croaking sound I was met with as I approached lmao.
---
It does. Observe that the effect does increase the actual damage, it only makes the limb cripple faster.
---
I don’t think it matters. I only keep Diluted on me and never have the issue.
---
Bethesda needs to add a side quest where you help a deathclaw named Steve kill a band of super mutants and the reward is a Steve statue for your camp. u/deata
---
If the gourmands are the guys from new Vegas, why do the vendor it's in 76 always say "note to the GOURMANDS......"
---
Endangerol syringer does work, and stacks per each unique player application. Very effective against SBQ, Samsquanch, Arktos baddie. tl;dr confirming testimony from other players.
---
The other current debuffs aren't very useful.
---
Thankfully they did atleast add a "gift" emote
---
Australian living in Japan. Noticed from the beta that there were a mix of Japanese and English speakers just from people's usernames lol. Figured it was Australia/NZ because of how close we are...
---
That's a fair trade off. Hopefully 
---
 I'll get lucky like that at some point.
---
Camp counselor Nia (campfire tales) is a prewar cannibal that turned into a wendigo after the war, right? The holotape recording is pre-war.
---
Blurp, that seems real foolish -_-
---
Probably correct, lol
---
According to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bt9phg/mechanics_test_furious_weapon_affix/) and my experiences in game you are correct. Furious and Bloodied are definitely the way to go on these high rate of fire weapons since it reaches max stacks so quickly.
---
Can’t remember who did it but there is a YouTube video of a player agroing all the club ghouls, running over to the parked car and exploding it and him once surrounded. It was prenerf but still. Get creative.
---
I appreciate the Ultracite and Deathclaw Hide, but why were you hoarding so many Screwdrivers?  Like, 250+ Screwdrivers?
---
There is no crossplay at present and although i think it would probably be fine to introduce it between the console versions but i wouldn't want it with PC due to the different input methods, different settings and hackers.
---
The last entry is technically from the dude himself after he eats his wife. Since it would just be him living in the cave at that point, and later the thing living in that part of the cave is a wendigo, you could hypothesize he became one.
---
Hey, if you throw that weightless barrel on that bad boi it will weigh 0.0 !
---
The games great. Haters gonna hate.
---
no patch note probably means: no bug fixed...
---
For now I only hope for a fix for foreign translations. The game is a mess in its actual state if you don't play in english.
---
Lol yeah dude it hella suck I mostly het killed by godly turrets lol unless I break em all before
---
There's room for everyone. Raiders, vendors, chem-fueled conspiracy theorists still hiding from the man.
---
I roleplay as a survivor of the war who thinks we're in a giant simulation like the one Braun tried to make, and we're actually helping to refine and develop the scorched virus, not combat it. It gets stronger and more resistant every time we hit it. Don't you see? We have to find the real exit. I have heard rumors of a phasing gate. Maybe I started them.
---
im not sure if they changed it, but i used to not be able to revive ppl, then i go check if i have any stims and i only had diluted.
---
Wake up, dude. he is talking about mob attacks, not players.
---
Anthem released, people have a new thing to hate on
---
The gourmands are a raider faction in fo76.
---
I did dispatch them, so unless he's on this sub, he probably has no idea what happened.
---
That happened to me yesterday but I got kicked from the server before I even got a third of the way through there. Got some good stuff.
---
No please. So much no. You want it, just do the event. 
---
The food don't even spoil anymore. No need to get me killed again with a faulty event.
---
awesome everyone!
---
Nah,
---
Most of the time it has been pretty lean on the legendaries for me.
---
Very
---
Wellllll then, so I pressume eventually they might be in new Vegas ? Or will just never now thanks to the man upstairs (Tod)
---
i like to compare it to the other 2 games that released around the same time and have online. Red dead 2 online and Anthem. Red dead 2 was a great single player that they have shifted focus to an abysmal online mode which in a years time will be exactly the same as gta 5 online just with horses. and the player base in red dead 2 is.... well they arent friendly. not even slightly. so id say on that comparison fallout 76 wins the online debate, in a years time fallout 76 will be a very unique experience.
---
On to anthem. Fallout 76 got more hate then anthem, more of the big youtubers crapped all over it compared to anthem. And fallout 76 is leaps and bounds better than anthem. ill leave it at that because anthem is quite honestly the worst thing ive ever played. Fallout has a ton of seriously frustrating issues but despite that im still able to immerse myself for extended hours of play. With Anthem im literally in an outrageous fury after 30 minutes because its absolutely hollow and mind numbing. 
---
Fallout 76 has made big improvements, but has a very long way to go. I actually believe that if bethesda stays focused and committed to this game it will have a similar rise from the ashes as FFXIV. i would love to see fallout 76 have the kind of success and lifespan that a realm reborn has had, and the potential is there.
---
I guess thats how i would sum up fallout 76, it still has lots of potential. where as red dead 2 and anthem we already know exactly what they are and what they are going to be. even if they improve vastly anthem will just be a loot grind, and red dead will just be a world of chaos and shark cards... or whatever they are called in red dead. Fallout 76 on the other hand could go so many ways that at the very least we can say we have no idea what its going to end up as. and that warrants more excitement in my opinion than those other two.
---
Bethesda already said they are working on a legendary system. So we could reset everything for some kind of bonus. The perk cards reset too, so getting them will become relevant again.
---
No thanks. Caps sinks are needed to keep the in-game economy healthy.
---
Oh look , another basement dweller who likes to tell other people how to play a game!
---
Neat!
---
That also sounds great but I don't know how that would be implemented.
---
What about lifegiver it adds to your maximum health so if am always sitting at 30% health is it a waist off points
---
Nobody has been reported because of it, so I would try it if I were you. Can't live without it anymore.
---
I still haven’t got mine lol
---
Exactly.
---
I love Caravan so much. There's a ftee app version for iOS if I remember right (made by some random 3rd party). One of my fave things about NV, and there were so many things to love in that game...
---
They were taking requests for the replacements up unto 2nd of May, the 4-6 months was from there, so somewhere between early September to beginning of November most likely.
---
I'd rather be able to trade in say, 10 perk cards, for 1 more SPECIAL point. Now that'd be cool.
---
Assuming it's possible
---
These aren't just Super Mutants, they are 100% science based Super Mutants!
---
Man soon as I heard they were doing it I sent all my receipts to them...and they said it was not enough evidence of purchase...there so fucked,I spent $350 for power armor edition
---
Combine xp boosts with white springs or harpers fairy

Can run both accounts on 1 pc too.

will test it today to see if they changed it
---
This was only meant for player attacks on your camp and not npc.
---
Nah. I spent like 3.000 $ on mine and it runs fine with 2 accounts.
---
He was so bad at it that he became a legend among his peers
---
Also it has to spawn by itself.  If other creatures spawn with it, they can not be tamed.
---
I do get notifications. It is often a ghoul, liberator, or super mutant who wandered close from the nearby farm.
---
But if you are a pve player or even a merchant type character there is a 90% chance your stash is packed full forcing you to hold on to some kind of overstock items and forcing players on a multiplayer to go solo becuase the game system is broken is fair from right
---
I've noticed this camera issue with various things. People have mentioned all sorts of "fixes" you might try:
---
1. Rename or give your camera a custom name
---
2. Reload the camera
---
3. (This worked for me once or may have been coincidence) clear some space in your photo gallery and take another picture
---
Don't expect Fallout from Bethesda, they only do Elder Scrolls.
---
Don't expect co-op game from Bethesda, they only do single player games.
---
Don't expect MMO from Bethesda, their engine is too shit. 2 player co-op at best.
---
Don't expect mobile games from Bethesda, they only do PC games.
---
Yeah it's a known bug for sure. A couple other people have mentioned on this thread that they miss a lot with melee in VATS, but it's not even that. The bug is that you don't even swing. Nothing registers at all; you don't lose AP, you don't swing, you don't even move. It treats you like you are too far away to VATS, even though the bugs are flying right through you.
---
They'll fix it... eventually.
---
It would explain the bodies found at the camp site. Could’ve been feeding off of victims in the surrounding area for some time and our large presence plus the sounds could’ve lured her out from her hiding spot.
---
That song hurts my innocent brain. I cannot tell if it is to be taken literally, or is just a huge sexual innuendo. I don't know.
---
Can confirm, they are present
---
In my experience it changed back and fourth, I prefered the green laser so much, I left the regular barrel on, I'm fairly sure it is just a visual glitch with the laser mods, and they left the animation for the regular laser on both barrels
---
Jst go scorched earth event and there be many people to revive
---
Have my 👍 fellow wastelander.
---
&gt; I don’t think I can say too much yet. Best I can do is assure you that it’s doubtful you’ve celebrated this in precisely this manner, ever.
---
I've been thinking, for quite a while, that it would be beyond awesome to have teams of people launching nukes in each time zone at 9pm on the Fourth Of July.
---
Agreed.  It's basically a legendary camp decoration that often takes a lot of work to get.  When you get a good one, it's like getting a "god roll" weapon^(\*).  Now imagine that weapon disappeared.    
---
^(\*)And before anyone says that a "god roll" weapon is useful, think first about what you're going to say--god roll weapons aren't necessary to play the game by any means.  I'm still kicking ass, at least in PvE, with a 1\* executioner's combat shotgun.  God roll weapons kinda trivialize the game, but it's fun for you, and that's why it's important to you.  And that's why you'd be upset if it vanished from your inventory.  The same goes for Steve.
---
Oohh now that would be cool. You see a suit of power armor hunched over or propped up. As you draw near you hear incoherent rambling before the head twitches and it attempts to lunge at you. It could possibly try utilizing the charge mechanic of power armor and slams, if we didn’t want them to use weapons.
---
The taming mechanic needs some serious love from Bethesda. The writer found a fun story to flesh out that subject. Did you read the article?
---
I'm right there with you. I stepped away from the game and came back on the last day of it. I was totally oblivious and I regret not being active in the community so I could know what was going on.
---
Overall, I like the concept of the Burrows a lot, but it felt like it was lacking in difficulty, length and replayability. I was able to comfortably solo it on my unarmed build. Keep in mind though, that build was made with the mindset of being as tanky as possible without power armor.
---
It is definitely doable and worth a solo run, if you have not done so yet.
---
I am. Message me GT knucklessyrup
---
It's because Bethesda (mainly Todd Howard) are cheap peices of shit and won't give you seperate servers. Todd's entire and ONLY history has been saving and making money for Bethesda, in any scum, fucked up, and crooked way he can; he has the same business sense as Trump. And yet, the fan boys throw his name around, bad or good, and continue to make him untouchable.  
---
Remember, you might "praise" him (honestly, or mockingly) but either way, it secures his place and his business practices. Keep doing it and ES6 will use the same engine they've used since Oblivion.
---
Enemies still turn green when dying though, I'd like to keep that :)
---
Did you mean "doesn't increase the actual damage"?  Not sure I understand "it only makes the limb cripple faster" in your context. What happens when the head is crippled? The reason I'm asking if it applies to headshots is for the sake of killing faster.
---
Rumor has it that you have to almost touch the deathclaw now to tame it, much like hacking a robot.  You can't do it by just aiming from a distance.  I have not yet confirmed this.  I don't know if this applies to all taming attempts, or just deathclaws.
---
I've got an update saying they'll be shipped out shortly.
---
If ammo is an issue for you, semi automatic is very efficient. But if you want maximum damage output, automatic is the way to go. Keep in mind with automatic, you can still burst fire 1-3 rounds, and 9 times out of 10 those single shots still kill most mobs instantly.
---
Don't bring Trump into it
---
This doesn't need to be a political debate
---
I bet someone could make some sort of voice autotranslation mod using Google's Cloud Speech-to-Text API. But learning Japanese is probably less work.
---
I mean both the things you listed are restricted purely for security and so far it has worked extremely well
---
Are you saying you looked at the code and verified that it hasn't changed?
---
Doesn't always work. I've had it hard lock my system a few times, only solution is to power down.
---
Have you been to the Fastnatch parade? :D
---
YYYYYEEEEESSSSS!!
---
So where are you located and what version did you buy? Because everything I've read says the launcher checks your location against the version you bought. You can get around it with a VPN but I don't really feel like doing that for a video game.

i’ll keep that in mind next time (IF) i decide to try it. thanks.
---
Is the game in the borderless and/or have you tried removing the FPS lock? Don't see any reason that should be happening on a 1080 unless it's bottlenecked.
---
I'd recommended having a go on the settings /custom.ini/nvidia control panel if you haven't yet. Not sure I have any hard &amp; fast suggestions but messing with settings is a good start.

Antique lights in the Whitespring furniture vendor for candles/lantern and etc all in one.

I'd say 4 of my 5 best weapons came from Whitespring on just a normal everyday run. It seems the ones in the laundry/maintenance area are the ones dropping everything good for me (but that's obviously anecdotal)

What da f*q was I supposed to do with all the extra Deathclaw egg concrete paint after the Easter weekend. . .

The depression of missing the first egg in the hunt threw me back into a weeklong spiral of Nukashine, Orange Mentats and Psychobuff - wherein some things happened that I’m both proud of and not proud of. 
---
I thought the insult bot was my dad dude... It’s hard to come back from.

But to return to your main point:

it’s not my fault if ya’ll can’t see Mr. Fluffy playing 9 holes at the Whitesprings green in my chest plate masterpiece - that one’s on you.

my first deathclaw, Lilly came back to my camp and started attacking visiting friends...she ran off then and never came back. I didn't find another deathclaw until after two sloths and my swamp doe later all just never came back or just got murdered back at camp. (I super loved that megasloth and I want George back...) but finally I found another deathclaw. Lucy fit right in. nearly nothing ever spawned into my camp despite being not as secluded as usual but not long after Lucy the deathclaw joined ...lvl 60 cave crickets spawned and murdered her... I was guttedh. I managed to find a snallygaster after and gotta love Bob -  he came back to camp and hung out for days! every time I'd approach he's give me this silly toothy drooly grin to cheer me up. he really did grow on me. I logged out night before last and heard a noise as I left game and when I logged in the next day he was gone  . I have a mirelurk king now but he just paces fast and hisses at me when I approach.
---
I miss my deathclaw and my megasloth .
---
Bethesda please fix this.
---
Just a heads up - if you want a tall camp structure:
---
- Do not place your CAMP directly on the ground
---
- (takes patience and trial / exploring) Place it on some sort of existing structure about 2-3 “base levels” above the ground surface
---
- there is a “floor” to the camp boundary cylinder
---
   - if you place it say at the top of the monorail pylon height (regular pylon not the superstructure) - ground level will kick you out of workshop mode 
---
- leverage the pillars method to stack stair modules (tedious and shouldn’t need a glitch imho)
---
- blueprint your base in sections so you can piece it together when you inevitably get “hanging” errors when moving
---
Maybe he served as a Warlord or Primus and become Legendary that way before deciding to become a Suicider.

The things I've found so far supporting this - the ex-leader of the gourmonds got exiled to a cave, where he lived alone (after eating the only other person with him). Later you kill a wendigo that inhabits this same spot, although nothing spells out for certain that the wendigo was him.
---
The wendigo stories from the holotapes tells a story of a man who got radiated to the point of transforming, apparently turning into a wendigo and craving raw meat, and if I remember correctly he was tending towards cannibalism at the end of the story.
---
The quest that gives you the mounted wendigo - one of the unsolved mysteries, can't remember the name - has you tracking a person. You eventually find a note that indicates he ate other people to consume their power, and he definitely turns into a wendigo.
---
Clearly, wendigos are people eaters, so it's really not a stretch to think most of the wendigos you encounter were once Gourmonds.
---
That's why I relate to the song
---
In addition to improving taming, I propose Bethesda immortalize Steve in the form of a new random encounter wherein you encounter a friendly Deathclaw (named Steve, or maybe like, Steve 2 or Steve Jr.)
---
I often play without the music. The ingame music is perfect to match the lonely feel of the game.
---
A lever action rifle should be just fine indoors
---
Sites do close when they are hit, no matter what part of blast zone they will be.

By the way, when you launch nuke, fissures within blast zone blinks.

---
Right, couldn't have anything to do with internet and server infrastructure in Australia being extremely overpriced and outdated, because our Government doesn't understand technology and lets Telstra get away with an extreme monopoly on such services.  
---
No, it has to be Todd's fault, despite the fact that Bethesda is one of the few game companies that act like Australia exists at all, and they genuinely act like they want to improve gaming in the region.  
---
But then again, I'm applying logic to this, which is pretty wasted considering you instantly performed mental gymnastics of an Olympian to leap to Trump out of nowhere.
---
kind of bummed i i'm not getting to play with random people around the world.
---
he was very good at his job, he killed many humans, Mirelurks, Scorcheds and more, his son died fighting a deathclaw and a horde of molerats. His wife died of a serious injury by killing with hers minigun a scorchedbeast and his horde of scorched. Grunk participated in all these battles and killed all the enemies he encountered, all his family members left on the battlefield with honor. Grunk is old and does not want to die in a bed without honor, he must die bathed in the blood of his enemies. In a blaze of glory.
---
Secretly, he's MacGyver
---
Does that mean you'll do it? I'll give you internet points if you do.
---
My Gary, my mega sloth, went to sleepy slothy heaven when I returned to my camp. 
---
There was a meat pile and some super mutant remains.
---
I gathered up the loot, said a little prayer and went to go find Gary V2.0.
---
Instead of Gary V2.0, I found Colin, a lovely timid Death law, in the mire. I quickly shipped him off back to the forest to his new home.
---
On my return to camp, Gary was there... 😳 OMG. I feel like I had cheated on him. He did too and he soon started attacking me.
---
I dined on roast Megasloth that evening and raised a glass of Shiraz in his honour 🍷
---
Your kinda right but also not considering a few critical parts of the elevator system:
---
In fallout 4 BTS - elevators are weirdly setup. I personally spent 2 months trying to adjust the institute main elevator to fit my cave base in the creation kit. I did it in the end but I had to throw out the entire existing scriptmanager for a homemade one 
---
The difference between the horizontal and vertical lifts and walkway rails is just whether it goes up or down.  The horizontal ones do seem easier to work with. 
---
A lot of elevators are tied into a “quest” or additional scripting to allow for them to remember whether they should be in a up or down state and to make sure they’d stop at the right floor. 
---
Again im no Beth dev so FWIW - I suspect with the addition of the mmo / coop netcode to the F4 engine - things that move and move with other things(players) are tricky because you have to move both the player and the elevator on both the client and the server for everyone. (Potentially for multiple players at one time)
---
I’ve seen a lot of games that struggle with multiplayer elevators - when they start they will go and move “through” the player because of desyncing positions. 
---
This is why I think we don’t see as much elevators in Fo76. They tend to be of the “load” variety where you get in and it just wraps you to the next one when it closes the door or goes through a fake super quick load transitional cell to mimic moving through the building.
---
Yah very
---
The requirements for taming:
---
- A random encounter location that spawns a “scene”. 
---
- At the scene it needs to be a creature  by itself
---
- You need Wasteland Whisperer and Animal Friend equipped at the same time (Probably having both perks maxed would help)
---
- In the past pets took up space so you needed extra CAMP budget, but this previous update seems to have made them cost nothing so I’m not sure
---
- Generally the creature needs to be less than half your level but I’ve had various results so I’m not sure
---
I usually get the bug where the grey health bar fills back up and I end up doing little damaged with auto. Sometimes though when I’m being stealthy and use auto it does incredible amounts of damage.
---
Lol
---
Ready?
---
Sure
---
Guess he was right when saying "only one of us is going to survive this, and it wont be you"
---
If you're on Xbox I could probably give you a hundred or two. I'm always offloading them getting more than I need
---
Vending machine also if you give me your game tag i would play and buy stuff from you
---
Alright
---
Range: SENT/ASS/POWERED
---
Melee: CAV/ASS/POWERED or CAV/UNYIELDING/POWERED
---
On RANGE you can add a SENT/CHAM/POWERED
---
rest is not as good, from far.
---
I wish I could! Would be a interesting problem.
---
he is s zen master that keeps being reincarnated as a super mutant suicider, over, and over, and over....
---
Hmmm, alright thanks for the information very informative
---
That wendigo was definitely the ex-leader. In wendigo lore, they’re created when a human consumes another and dives too deep into cannibalism.
---
i'm made a .38 auto THE FIXER to get rid of all the .38 ammo i had. now i love the gun so much I'm making the .38 crap. The rifle is absolutely the best for lower level areas its quite quirk and precise....and on sale at My shop for just 489 caps....
---
Just learn Japanese!
---
It just works
---
Hey buddy I have a  TSE .50 if you're on ps4.

Flog? *eyebrow wiggle, eyebrow wiggle*
---
English is an universal language and japan is quite a smart country. I guess they know english but are too shy to talk it/afraid no one will understand their accent, I know I am. Maybe with text chat a lot of people would interact more.
---
Nope, you nailed it. Bos heavy combat chest piece and heavy leather arms and legs are what I rolled with for the longest time. Only switched them out after getting some solid legendaries. I felt the perks were worth the dr and er trade off.
---
Yeah on PC we have 2 separate options. Block and block for session. Block permanently blocks them. Doesn't work though as in making you find a session without them.
---
Every time I hear someone say _but the servers_ I’m just thinking to myself like smh - have some imagination - ever heard of Rust, Minecraft etc?
---
They seem to manage the electricity and paintings and skins and over-complicated player bases relatively fine. 
---
With the acceptance that it’s not the same engine and what not - it just shows it’s not out of possibility perhaps just immediately not in reach.
---
I'm only doing it for the chance to get plans
---
English is not a universal language you ethnocentric fuck.
---
You can do it I believe in you
---
If you play in the middle of the night to morning hours, you'll get some chinese folks.
---
I don't speak chinese, but they certainly do.
---
No. I stealth followed a lvl 8 because I knew 4 lvl 30 snallgasts where in the area. Got my revive, lol.
---
Unfortunately  Uranium fever has done and got me down
---
That is the conclusion because the wendigo has the key fragment
---
The electrical station in north of watogoa spawns a death claw, they drop gears . Then just server hop and repeat. It's good exp too.
---
I don't know why, I've heard that leather resistances scale with intelligence level but absolutely 0 proof testing or confirmation.
---
I definitely agree though, I end up wearing leather all the time because of it. Leather arm is like 50 and 60 or somethin' crazy, robot arm is 20 and 10, like what? Makes very little sense, they should at least be comparable despite being better in their own areas.
---
The only thing I've found that gets close to leather's resistances is the marine combat armour and it's still not quite there.
---
Read Inside the Vault like the rest of us. Inform yourself
---
It sounds completely right, a handful of people trying to say it doesn't is what doesn't sound right. I've tried regular one, regular ones with AA perks equipped, and aa ones. Naturally? What, would I try instigating and junkies to test it?
---
Armor and weapon rewards are better if you hold off until higher levels.
---
I knew I was hearing a lot of Japanese for a reason lol
---
I'm brazilian. Most countries do teach english in their base education - brazils is notoriously bad, with 80% of students getting to college age without understanding basic math, and still they teach english. Even to the poor in public schools.
---
I dont think its different in most parts of the western world.
---
A bunch of new content. Just click the posters at the train station to get started. Best thing for me has been the player vending.
---
Which weapons and so on, with stabilised perks it still did same damage to enemies i fought.
---
Serendipity is the best imo
---
Since the game came out, what has that done to tourism in the area?  Also, have you seen an influx of people wearing fallout clothing or fallout bumper stickers since the game?
---
Im on ps4. U?
---
You can already build into some pretty detailed areas and the game doesn’t mind / seem to account for the existing stuff. 
---
Because of this - I’m starting to think that the current limits are a soft-cap that they induced so that they can relieve it later to a higher point that’s closer to the real hard-limit. 
---
It’s the only way to keep a “increase” viable in both the dev / players eye. 
---
You just know we’d as a gamer collective go unforgivingly apoplectic when they’d say we’ve reached the technical limit this early out
---
Grab the ant meat while you’re there for Rad Ant Lager (+50 carry weight) also.
---
Careful. I asked for this same thing and got attacked saying I wanted something for nothing and to go tame one like everyone else and stop asking for free stuff 
---
Like dude, decorative means not functional like the tamed one.
---
Just a heads up. Upvoted for the same idea. 😁
---
That's not even old school. That's just rookie error
---
Wow, is this game for PlayStation 2?
---
Private servers and mods if they keep their word.
---
If you were using a gatling laser or plasma the the damage per shot was so low that you wouldn't have seen much of a difference. I can guarantee there was though.
---
I think brewing is more of a personal enhancement kind of addition. Not a way to farm caps.
---
With the party boy/girl perk any booze is easy to make and gives a nice strength boost. Especially whiskey. The bock and hefe and lager are all useful enough to justify making.
---
There's plenty of ways to make caps. Just because brewing isn't one of them doesn't mean it's not useful. And I'm not even sure that it can't be profitable selling to vendor bots. 
---
If you devote your whole camp to being a garden, refine your crop gathering route and technique, craft in bulk and boost the absolute shit out of your charisma... If you really work the game mechanics, you can make a profit.
---
Will have to check if i ever get AA one.
---
Keep telling yourself you weren't being laughed at.
---
That’d be cool yeah. Rocking fatmans like the raiders did.
---
This is very insightful and thought provoking. Thank you.
---
I've started my session today and notice I was not in my coal dust excavator pa. I live inside it and im 100% sure i was in it when i disconnect in previous session. I enter in pipboy and the frame was not there. Seconds after server crashed and Ive got disconected. When I enter again my PA was still not there. Looked in stash and nothing. Really tired of this kind of bug, i've lost a ultracite 3* gattling laser last month in a similar bug.
---
I mean if you revived him, then no.
---
Haha what is it then? 
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!
---
camp flog gnaw
---
Lexington flashbacks and libertalia
---
Hahaha they are so bitter they lost, and will keep losing! 
---
The world is waking up to the regressive cancer that is identity politics.
---
...And the lonely Syringer remains forgotten.
---
Dude, I'm not saying everyone that this happens to is a cheater. You wrote all of that for nothing because I understand and agree with you for the most part, but some people definitely abuse thus BUG and use it as an EXPLOIT.
---
Another example of this is the bug where your when your camp couldn't be placed and it doubled whatever camp items you had placed. Most people hated this bug and didn't exploit it. Some people did. Some people built a bunch of turrets so they would double. That would be exploiting the bug. Same as people who abuse the carry weight bug.
---
I hope you can understand my point now.
---
On Xbox but this happened to me 3 times in a row about a month ago so I just never do the event. Glad to know its not just me.
---
Guaranteed spawn at Solomans Pond I think it is.
---
So, as rare as you want them to be :p
---
Wow I’m a fool. I’ll have to check there.
---
Player - *arrives at player vendor*
---
"I sure am looking forward to buying another godroll!"
---
*vendor turns out to be a cosmetic shop*
---
"WHAT?! Nuuuuuuuuuu!! My expectations were not MET!" 
---
*begins shaking*
---
"No.... Not now!! Must... Keep... shopping......."
---
*Player fails in their struggles, fur sprouts, their limbs distend and briefly assume a dominant T-pose*
---
"I... I am..." *voice deepens* "I have become Griefer, annoyer of others. You shall pay for having a themed store that I cannot make use of! TO ME my swarm of molerats and liberators! I SHAL PUNISH YOU FOR SOMEONE ELSE'S OVERSITE!!! Bwahahahaha!!"
---
One was done, but will try again.....
---
2 was tried.
---
Thanks for the tips!
---
Which level are you now ?
---
Limb damage will never make something die faster, all it is is just a word to describe limb condition. Yes, the head can be crippled but it crippling it will not make it die faster
---
Thanks for that! Have not had any luck with the random being alone.....
---
They seem to always be engaged with others...
---
It would be fun to learn a few basic words and talk to them, I bet they would get a kick out of it. Trade, help, prepare to die,  give me all your stuff, you know the basics.
---
Since this game is based heavily on retro styling cues, I would feel that how they made vehicles may be the same way. When they filled seams in automotive manufacturing (like rain rails and seams) and heavily in making custom bodies, (hence the term "Lead Sled" for chop top mercs) they would basically get the best shape they could out of the steel forming  and melt lead down and then shape it for the rest. With this kind of knowledge I have to think still lives in the fallout universe with hot rodding still being a culture, I would think that they would do the same to fill the seams in armor plating as well. They also have access to rubber which they could melt down and dip the armor in as well. Would end up with a black stealthy color, electrically non conductive surface for energy resistance with ballistic protection to boot. Wait, that needs to be a thing for an armor mod.
---
The scorched are quite literally the lamest, most half-assed NPC's i think ive ever witnessed in a game. Basically ghouls that can still use a gun...ooooh, thanks Bethesda! So creative.
---
I don't know exactly which recent patch broke the game so horribly but some of the new bugs/loading problems are worse than anything I've seen even during beta.
---
The most frustrating is when enemies get to kill you before they even load on your screen.
---
EVERY God damn time I load Whitesprings country club invisible Ghouls kill me unless I stand on top of the bus and wait basically so long, that someone else has come and killed them so now the whole point that I was loging in on the first place, is gone.
---
I could server hop, if I wanted to experience the same problem over and over...  Actually, I do, because I'm a stubborn idiot I guess?
---
Also happening recently : I suddenly start taking massive radiation damage for no apparent reason, die, then lose all the junk I was carrying because how can you fight back when the server won't even show the reason you're taking all that damage?!?
---
I blew through like 45 Super Stimpacks one time that I did try to fight back against this mystery damage and not give up on saving my loot!
---
He was a good dude and got the recognition he deserved!
---
I dig the idea! Sub’d, and I think I build pretty neat camps if you wanna stop by! 
---
PSN FuzzWave
---
Agreed comrade
---
Most Japanese study the language by rote, which means they know how to read and write it, but not to speak.
---
This isn't to generalize at all, but I lived there for four years, most of them aren't particularly comfortable speaking English
---
God i miss the raiders &amp; gunners. THAT would be a DLC to get excited about.
---
I did not know that I needed this until just now
---
Check the guide I linked in my last comment. On the map the red encounters are the ones that have a chance if spawning tameable animals
---
As a Logan native, I came here for this!
---
I mean, you heard him, he just hacks on anything he can get.
---
Resistances are only dependent on the armor level, type (combat, robot, etc.), variant (heavy, light, studded), and armor mods
---
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JohGniYph-c) clip from the movie "Billy Madison" accurately portrays my reaction after attempting to unscramble that loose collection of unsubstantiated thoughts riddled with both basic spelling and basic grammatical mistakes. Thanks for the giggle ya'll.
---
I agree. Vault-Tec is my main character's theme. I'd kill for a blue/yellow reskin of the tents. Dont see it happening though
---
The game is still pretty buggy so some still hate it but im still going strong.
---
Has almost every song except “Atom Bomb Baby”...sad.
---
See that's what I thought that's why I clarified with the no proof testing or confirmation lol, thanks
---
I don't think you're "right", but I like the way you think. You look like a guy that gets the best reframing small annoyances.
---
It's the unmarked lake south of Solomon's pond with the rad barrels, I see them spawn at the southwest gate to whitespring sometimes too.
---
Try o-hi-yo go-zy-mas. Good way to greet your neighbors
---
I was so upset that when I was finally able to get one of those Amulet of Ra red gem things it w missing the +1 DR 😭
---
At least now I know why (thanks to your post).
---
It's actually pretty upsetting that they bother to take something small like that, that's actually cool, away from us rather than focus on horrible game breaking bugs that were recently introduced.
---
Loading this game is basically a hellish nightmare every time now!!!
---
Do you have any "real" drawing to show us? This is better than my drawings I spend hours on lol
---
It is found to be boring. 😝
---
Stay long enough in the same server and you can take whatever you like.
---
 Where did you think the raiders got the crayons?
---
Ooooh, found the idiot! 😉 lemme guess... Trump supporter and you beat the only girlfriend you ever had, huh?
---
I got a explosive cryo, it's terrible. Dmg is lower than a pipe pistol with he perks.
---
Umm i hate to break it to you, but English is taught in Japan to students. 
---
When I visited I used as much Japanese as I could, but it also didn't bother people when I attempted to speak English. In fact, some had enjoyed trying to understand my english since it probably was a funny little charade with some resturaunt owners.
---
'Dispatch'. What a professional.
---
I wonder, are the cryptids in fo76 similar in appearance to what the real ones are described to be? Are those really local folklore that people are aware of or is it like a thing 1 people or 2 know about?
---
Woah thats prejudice asf sounds about 12
---
So... what do I do and who do I add, etc...? YenSid2 on PC? Ingame friend system?
---
Gosh how much energy and time is wasted on learning languages imagine how world would look like if every1 spoke the same language.
---
Faction dances:
---
-Raiders mosh 
---
-Brotherhood soldiers do the robot
---
-Enclave members rave as MODUS causes ambient lighting to descend from satellite
---
-Responders impersonate Napoleon Dynamite 
---
-Free States do era-appropriate dancing, synched to any nearby radios
---
not only would it be good to recycle unwanted cards.. but being able to spend some kind of in game currency for respec points would be pretty sweet as well...
---
Well he's definitely ionized now.
---
From the social page on the main menu, you can add me as a friend, the join the server I’m on. Bethesda does nothing the easy way.
---
You can feel the hate coming from the comments without even clicking on them lol.
---
solid question, upvoted!
---
Is there a thread about these game breaking and consistently appearing new problems?
---
Enemies being able to kill you before you even see them is a problem that is so severe it would not even be acceptable in a BETA version of a game.
---
The game actuality is basically shit until that issue (including the awful "sliding Ghouls" problem) WTF were they even trying to do that could cause those kinds of issues?
---
And why let the player take damage before the game is fully loaded?!?  MAKES ZERO SENSE @Bethesda
---
That's my house!! :-))
---
As player in Japan, I love that Australia is included because Japanese just don't get into chat as often
---
Could you please repost it?
---
After you've found the first one Broken ProSnap Camera Deluxes will start popping up in containers. So many
---
Awesome job on the pumpkin lol
---
&gt; English is an universal language 
---
No, it's not.
---
&gt; japan is quite a smart country.
---
Yes, and has its own language.
---
&gt; I guess they know english
---
No, they don't.
---
&gt;  are too shy
---
Fair enough.
---
Everyone still hates this game. Any article I read with comments is full of rage lol.
---
Where are you from exactly? Have you ever been to another country or learned a new language? English is part of the basic curriculum of literally almost every country.
---
With that said, however, I seem to recall that Japan is one of the few places that does extensively teach English and that most people living their don't know English well if at all.
---
Still no localisation fixes ... it cant be that hard to fix that and it should be on the highes priority!
---
Yep, they messed up and included a wrong file in the patch.
---
Rip
---
You still have them? I'll buy it
---
He must have been a government bureaucrat
---
I remember it being in the patch notes and stopped happening about a month after launch but just started happening again past week.
---
You might even, say legendarily bad at his job.
---
Yesssss!!!! Finally a place for these unused cards
---
&gt; English is taught in Japan to students
---
That's nice.  I wonder when my daughter will start using that English they taught her instead of insisting on speaking Japanese to me ...
---
That's caused by mods.  Either that, or your game needs to download the correct 8.5 GB "lighting file" [PC only, doesn't apply to consoles]
---
It's kind of creepy &amp; sad to witness it. As i tried to decide where to spawn back in, i heard him shooting in the background, so i clicked back to the screen to see, and there he was, going crazy destroying my entire c.a.m.p., shooting my body, and just lurking around when he was all done. Im guessing a lack of actual power in real life has something to do with it.
---
The ghouls were reactions to older zombie archetypes and the Scorched are playing around with newer ones - movies like 28 Days Later and The Crazies that have infected people rushing protagonists, sometimes with weapons, are definately the inspiration. They aree super lazy, though
---
Yep, thats Brazil too. We rarely ever really /speak/ english so its uncomfortable and doesnt sound natural - still understandable to native english speakers tho. Hence why I said text chat should help more people communicate :p
---
Very cool to learn that about japan btw.
---
 No I’m sorry! I don’t know how this works /:
---
You've given me a fun weekend project now. Gonna go see how many legendaries I can spawn using that barrel, haha.
---
You took the words right out of my mouth :P
---
They've already increased it multiple times.
---
I think the only reasonable added storage now would be unprotected - meaning a bunch of stuff you can keep laying around, but anybody could steal it.
---
Ohio Go Zye Moss
---
Scorched Brotherhood members with lasers and broken T60 suits would be a nice addition to the Southern parts of the map
---
My camp is near here and he is never legendary. He also never commits suicide, there are so many times he could have done the deed but didn’t.
---
That's the Aussie player's camp, right?
---
I don't think there's any direct evidence of that, but considering the fact that the they share a name and armor, as well as the fact that they were the only (currently known) faction to have supposedly fled Appalachia and escaped the Scorched, I think it's highly likely they migrated north, settled in Maine, and eventually degraded into the barely sane Fog-dwellers we know 200 years later.
---
He talks the talk, but, doesn't boom the boom...?
---
The wendigo in the cave *is* the ex leader of the Gourmonds. He killed and ate his girlfriend. There is a holotape in the cave explaining that he ate her because he had to, and that he wanted more flesh.
---
Or fortunately
---
That is a real pain in the ass and it's crazy they leave it that way yet they jump right on the bug : "fixed bug where some items of clothing were giving you +1 Damage Resistance"
---
That actually seemed like a cool feature to me, not a bug!?!
---
"Calling all Liberators, this is dispatch, we have a lvl2 learning how to craft"
---
Is this a recent change? Merging Japan with Australia? I've never noticed any Japanese players until recently.
---
Then why play the game?? There's a whole real world in front of you when turn it off.
---
Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrigatogozaimasu !
---
There must be a naked suicider there. Today he picked the short straw.
---
oh man....so THATS what happened to the scout's brother...yuck
---
Did this myself
---
See Zug-zug trained like all potential suiciders do, by spiking massive concrete balls so that when they die they might nuke an entire city. (Super Mutants aren't the brightest) Zug-zug was able to spike his ball nearly 15 yards underground. By the time he left training, he was a legend among the mutants. They called him, Zug-zug the ball smasher.
---
He's pretty easy to miss. I only found him as I had a house just a ways up that creek.
---
Actually english is known and taught as a second language in schools.
---
Alongside cartons of Nukashine that you can drink in the street.
---
That looks the famous Flog Shrine we have in real world Japan... astonishing
---
A few players bought a bunch of my junk, ahem I mean gear, right after the patch update.  No joke it was 5-6k worth of stuff I had for sale for awhile.
---
^ facts
---
Although I'm sure the programmers for this game are talented, this engine is far too limited for even basic MMO functionality
---
I've only ever seen one only because a buddy took me to solomans pond to prove they exist when I mentioned my doubts .. who'd a thunk it
---
No. The Gourmands (plural) are a Raider gang in 76. The Gourmand (singular) is the name of a restaurant inside the Ultra-Luxe Casino run by the White Glove Society in New Vegas. They're completely unrelated, though the name of the Raider gang might be a reference to said NV faction.
---
They did indeed.
---
English is objectively the "world language". Followed by chinese, I guess.
---
That's observable by how many places that dont speak english natively have lots of things translated to english.
---
I'm pretty sure almost everywhere in the world, the flight captain in planes repeat instructions in english (after local ofc), rarely in other languages.
---
Cant really argue with you about the rest tho
---
You have every piece Excavator?
---
&gt; Does the Shielded Casual underarmor exist? 
---
Yes. I have it and it works fine.
---
It's my choice for underwear for alts. It boosts INT +3 for general faster leveling and +3 CHA for max trade at level 3.
---
I've also crafted a lot of casual clothes for sale in my VM.
---
A pain to get it, that's true, but that's another story...
---
Picture or it didn’t happen 😂 what do u play on? PC, XB or PS?
---
Yeah it's kinda fucked up that it was once a human that doesn't even look like one anymore.
---
Exactly fact that it's been a easy PC mod for this long you'd think the dev that "plays the game" would have done it months ago.
---
They should make this an 'event'.  It would encourage people to build more defenses and let other player give a helping hand
---
Ikr ahahah, but languages are fun. I love hearing russian, portuguese-portugal and french. It adds to the "magical foreign strange lands" feeling of traveling.
---
21 I think?
---
As a Canadian, I've met a lot of Americans. One pair I met insisted on discussing politics on their patio till 3 am. Definitely made my friends list that night.
---
I'm not because I don't feel like wasting perk slots for starched genes. It is fine
---
It's 2019. Why shouldn't my toaster also cook pizza?
---
Consoles, don't have "in game" chat either. Steam offers chat, so effectively, PC has the same chat capabilities as console.
---
Or go all out crazy and use the search function.
---
Green resort lamp? Which one is that?
---
So you will be supplying the materials right?
---
I don't think 76 explains it too well. I never got the chance to play much of 4 so until player vending came out there was so much I never thought possible with camp building. Now my camp is ugly as hell still but it's a lot better than it was before I could check out some really great camps out there. And I want to thank those that don't lock their camp. It really helps me learn seeing what you've done
---
It is found, through the powers of Radaway.
---
I saw a camp where someone made a roof of wires - it actually looked fairly cool.
---
If one of them gets destroyed a lot would be powerless.
---
Isn’t NZ an Aussie territory?
---
I kid, I kid.  Went there ~10 years ago for work.  Beautiful country!
---
Stimpacks have an animation outside of power armor. Trying to spam it doesn't work.
---
&gt; english is known 
---
By what percentage of the population?
---
&gt; taught as a second language in schools.
---
for two years in junior high in classes kids sleep through
---
If you come to Japan and expect to be able to speak English, you're going to have a bad time.
---
It's just to disable enemies. As an example with improvised numbers: you're fighting an Assaultron with 500 HP with a weapon that does 75 damage and a +50% limb damage bonus. Your first shot is to the torso, and the Assaultron is now at 425 HP. Your next shot is to the Assaultron's left leg, which has (in this example) a damage bar showing 150 HP - this leg's HP is a condition modifier, so when you hit the Assaultron it's overall HP will decrease by 75 (taking it down to 350 HP) but it's leg will take 112 damage (150% of 75, taking it's leg down to 38 HP). 
---
If you shoot the Assaultron in the leg again it will take 75 damage to it's overall HP (bringing it down to 275) and it's leg will take another 112 damage (bringing it below 0, crippling the leg). No matter where you shoot it the overall HP will decrease based on the stated damage of the weapon: +50% limb damage is used to disable opponentd, and can be a very useful strategic tool (if an Assaultron is charging it's head laser you can take out a +Limb Damage weapon and cripple it's head, you can aim for the legs and slow down a hoard of ghouls that are swarming you)
---
The game is not too hard though..
---
I think this type of post is still hated, no matter how you reword them.
---
Ah, forgot about the key fragment being on his corpse. That's pretty clear connecting evidence.
---
It's just flying enemies. It's a known bug.
---
The ones that don’t work in power armor tell you. Barbarian, Ironclad, evasive, etc. the rest should unless there’s a bug
---
No they don’t but it would be too OP
---
under the lights section then it’s the one of the three resort lamps sold at the white springs and it’s a dark green
---
I don’t think wires actually use up any materials. So, sure, why not an entire roof of wires.
---
Hopefully they do it at some point. I'm currently using the mod on the PC but that doesn't help console players.
---
Personally I'd like to see them change the perk system.  I'd like to see it go away with the points to some extent. Leave it a minimum of one point in each special, Max of 15 in a special and a total of 56 points but let us change that based on card selection. Instead of calling them loadouts call them decks and you can change play styles based on your deck. Those who want 5 different characters can still make 5 different characters. Those who only want one and want to play something different can do so without having to move points around every level.
---
I have seen this guy, i think his name is George his older brother Frank was the CFO at west-tek
---
so long as you can build all that then i would happily reimburse you
---
Technically from what I understand they are all taught english. But of course if htey never use it irl it's easy to forget what you are taught. I took five years of french and I'm pretty sure I'd have a hard time conversing in french now (I barely remember anything).
---
I prefer the conduit pipes, looks much nicer and can pass through walls
---
I think that's the implication, yes. Their exiled former leader became one, that guy from the Unsolved quest who fell into the sunken church and resorted to cannibalism (per the guidance of a Gourmand) became one, Nia from Campfire Tales (implied to be a cannibal who was killing and eating the campers) became one.
---
In Algonquian folklore, Wendigos are associated with murder, man-eating and insatiable greed, and are said to be spirits that possess people and warp them into monsters. I think what we've seen in game is a more science-fiction take on it; all of the people we KNOW became Wendigos weren't just eating people to survive, they were *obsessed* with it. The ex-leader of the Gourmands developed such an intense, insatiable craving for flesh that he began killing and eating other Gourmands. The guy in the sinkhole became obsessed with survival and becoming strong, and killed and consumed the Gourmand trapped with him to prove his strength. Nia was a serial killer who was killing and eating the children in her care. What I took from all of this is that a Wendigo is the result of someone who's experiencing extreme mental degradation, likely from years upon years of consuming human flesh (since we know for a fact IRL that cannibalism is *really really bad* for your body and actually causes major brain damage over time) driving them to insanity, followed by enough exposure to radiation to begin the ghoulification process. The changes to their physiology brought on by continued cannibalism mixed with the radiation is what warps people into a Wendigo rather than a typical Ghoul. You don't see this happen in places such as New Vegas because groups like the White Glove Society stopped their cannibalistic practices before they degenerated to the point of the Gourmands (or, if they resume being cannibals per Courier intervention, I think the implication is that they indulge in more 'controlled' cannibalism; not EXCLUSIVELY eating human flesh. Not to glorify the White Gloves though, cannibalism's still fucked regardless.)
---
Tl;dr I got carried away (sorry I've thought about this subject way too much lmao) yes, I think all the Gourmands inevitably suffered the same fate as their leader and we're meant to assume that all the out of control cannibals in 76 mutated to become Appalachia's population of Wendigos.
---
They can detect clocked enemys but im not sure if they can see them entirely.
---
He means legendary armour effects, not perk effects
---
Yeah. Me too. But that doesn’t apply as much to powering up extractors.
---
I think it’s a bit of a leap to assume the focus is on PvP. That really hasn’t been the case and looking at the community, it’s pretty clear it’s a small percentage of players who actively engage in it. With some actual balance, that could change though. 
---
Being a primarily PvE game, the system that’s in place pretty much works. I agree that the weapon leveling system is dumb, but by and large the system works. 
---
The constant rebalancing is coming from PvP and is purely the result of legendary effects. Speaking from experience, when facing non-god-equipped players when Survival first came out, I took out plenty of 50 and 100 + level players with just an auto pipe rifle at level 12. I got killed a lot more, but I had more than a fighting chance. The balance was fine until top tier legendary gear came into play. Then there was zero chance of success. 
---
I think the solution is simple. Leave things as they are outside of PvP. In PvP, kill the legendary effects. There’s a lot of content that could be developed around PvP interactions, but it’ll be DOA without balance.
---
Yeah, a lot of people don't realize you can Daisy chain things together. It's super helpful and gives a much cleaner appearance.
---
Ah, now I understand
---
I play with the Herbavore mutation, but it doesn't help my build. I use a berserker with heavy weapons that disable and freeze, that lower damage resistance and do rad damage
---
I'm on the ps4 as well xNeoReaperx if anyone need help or just wants to play sometime
---
They make sense in lore as becoming Scorched is like a different strand of ghoulification, have custom animations and during beta I did find their dialogue intriguing, but I do agree with you with them pretty lacklustre. 
---
They could have benefitted from more personality, with a little more sentience they could have been made more fanatical/cultish and built shrines and customised their locations like Muties do with the meat bags etc. Like OP suggested power-armored BoS Scorched could have provided more variance and challenge in the Mire and Cranberry Bog.
---
picture? dude, I am telling you that I sell them in one dedicated VM. 
---
Want to buy one or to check them? 
---
I have any shileded cloth at 1.500, any of the 16 shielded clothes in game. All in stock atm. 
---
For casual underwear there are three clothes:
---
* Fannels Shirt and Jeans.
---
* Military Fatigues
---
* Undershirt and Jeans
---
marzial, my ign. (leaving soon)
---
Yeah, sorry, that's exactly what I meant.
---
you available now?
---
They've sneakily been wearing dense armor.
---
Agreed. Lol. I’m quite anal about such things.
---
Only use mobile (lame i know) but its "change user flair" option on the sub itself. Im sure its somewhat similiar on desktop.
---
I mean .. my kids are in English classes now and they can't put three words together. so ....
---
Mutations are really powerful, but they do come at a price of 2-5 Luck points that are needed to keep and benefit from them. You also get less effect from chems. So running mutation-less build would imply using chems to compensate somehow. But we need a perk that extends chem duration by a great deal, rather than just doubling it. Making them last about an hour or so is not too OP, but would definitely be worth it.
---
I'd never play again if they altered or nerfed mutations negatively. If you can't counter the meta then you have to raise yourself to that level to counter it, not call for nerfs and have the meta brought down to you. 
---
Having mutations is one of the best things in this game.
---
Way ahead of you :p  
---
Nan-ni shimasho-ka?
---
Only in Fallout 76 do we find whiners in every other post.
---
Kill deathclaws
---
True, but I think people check their camps often enough that that’s not a big problem.
---
Personally, I'd prefer a purely cosmetic pet along the lines of ESO where it follows you around, but that's like. All it does. It can't attack and it won't be attacked, it's just there. But I would also be fine with this, I definitely like coming home to my Brahmin roaming around my camp (even if that thing does die fucking constantly. I swear, enemies ALWAYS attack the Brahmin before literally anything else in your CAMP)
---
Maybe he's got a healing factor of some sort. He "dies" but a few hours later he's regenerated and ready for another round.
---
I went mutations then went without them and hated life lol too damn slow and went full white men can’t jump haha
---
One of us. One of us
---
With the modular nature of power armor in 4 and 76 I'm continually surprised and disappointed that they never opted to include armor mounted weaponry. Shoulder mounted cannons or rockets, arm mounted swords or extra large powerfists for when you just gotta punch that behemoth in his dirty kneecap. Turn the power armor into a mobile weapons platform instead of just... powered armor.
---
You never know what makes him legendary - i mean odds are good that he is legendary lazy...
---
Did the same haha, got a Lvl8 into a scorchbeast fight :-) he was happy though
---
That would make you a cheater and you would be banned.
---
Can I use my lion  statues for my camp without right after getting the message that I've build to much?
---
Kamikaze failure frank
---
As far as stuns go. If anyone came up to you and hit you with a big board in real life. Im 100% sure it would stun you.
---
Stick to the west side of the map as you're less likely to encounter higher level enemies, I'm fairly sure they're all level capped in the forest and toxic valley, maybe the ash heap. As mentioned, either stealth or power armor/melee. I'd recommend the latter, regardless of build, as it does increase your damage and survivability a lot more. Stealth is a bit slow going for my liking.
---
I’ve noticed this a bit. Sometimes I’ll take damage and go to heal, but it almost doesn’t take the input and my health keeps dropping, until I hear the heart pound sfx and then I jam the heal button then suddenly it kicks in.  Not sure if it’s some sort of delay built in or what but it’s kinda nerve-wracking, especially when you realize you forgot to stash up those flux you stabilized :/
---
They use copper
---
At *the very least * let us pick "Favorites" so we can stop wasting time scrolling through duplicates and cards we never use!?!
---
Reloading the camera seems to fix this.
---
Meathook if it’s still bugged where unarmed and one handed still apply to it. If not then probably a deathclaw gauntlet
---
I was thinking the 5.56 could fill that niche, or they could even bring back the 12.77 as that thing was a beast!
---
Really. I’ve tested that and noticed zero depletion in my copper supply after wiring my stuff. It might use copper, but it doesn’t seem to use it up.
---
I have my health at about 20-25% because there are rads everywhere but 20% is good because Nerd Rage kicks in however and there are rads everywhere so you can quickly find yourself at 10-15% or below. With just one rank of born survivor it won’t proc till you go below 20% so it just acts as a safety net if the rads get out of hand, Brahmin milk is great for micro-managing rads as it removes only a tiny amount, if you took the rads below the level born survivor fires it would probably fail to fire the way the medical pump on P.A doesn’t fire at its normal 50% health if rads are holding your health at 20% but I haven’t tried it. With lead belly 3 to reduce the rads from food and drink the biggest culprit is ghouls so I have the lead lined backpack and pop a rad x diluted before taking a trip to whitesprings. Worse case scenario is you end up with so many rads you’ve got barely 5-10% health and have to take a dilute RadAway to shift some but you can quickly add some back on to re-balance them by shooting at your own feet with a gamma gun lol.
---
I get the impression that they're extremely rare. I've seen the odd reddit post about several of them spawning in a group (though never with photographic proof), and I've heard there's a very low chance that any group of Super Mutants has a chance of spawning with a Behemoth in it. But I, personally, have seen a max number of three; both in the places you mentioned (though the Whitespring Behemoth I encountered was NOT during a nuke) and also the lake south of Solomon's Pond, as people have mentioned. So they're definitely incredibly rare.
---
Should be able to tranquilize a bear with one shot.
---
&gt;I don't speak Chinese, but they certainly do
---
Quality observation right here
---
start at tanagra town. There is a 1 in 3 chance of deathclaws spawning there(if it's not deathclaw it's either a mega sloth which drops screws or a fog crawler which drops antiseptic). Short walk north to the toxic waste dump(where you start the enclave questline). Inside you are guaranteed 2-3 deathclaws. Server hop, run back down to tanagra town, kill the spawn, then run back and inside toxic waste dump. Repeat as necessary.
---
lol to match the annoyance of preston garvey it shouldn't be a little popup - instead a massive pic of him covering the whole screen till you travel to your camp
---
Only in Fallout 76 do you get a COD fanboy whining about VATS and PvP. This isn't COD VATS has been part of Fallout for a long time why TF wouldn't they include it in PvP?
---
This is just  another I got beat in PvP so I now have to complain post. 
---
&gt;Only in Fallout 76 can you expect to get an overpowered weapon and not have it be nerfed... ever.
---
A few months after release they nerfed the shit out of TSE's.. so yeah...
---
&gt;Only in Fallout 76 can you build absolutely full "tank" and still die in the same amount of shots if you were a pure dps build.
---
Oh look another PvP whine
---
&gt;Have a real fucking back bone and stablized the PvP
---
And another look there's more
---
&gt;Jesus. You're PvP is worse than a hackers playground and it makes me sick to see that your only remark and attitude towards it was "its interesting to watch". VATS is a legal aimbot. Stealth is a permanant invisablity. The right perks and armor and you can legit be invincible. You can one shot people. Fuck sakes, I don't know why I am still bitching and just not quiting;
---
Well why aren't you quitting sounds like you want to?
---
FYI: If you PvP like you're playing COD you're gonna get beat. So enjoy COD it's not Fallout I'm actually glad they didn't make a carbon copy of another game for thier PvP mode. So bye have fun in COD
---
no way in hell im clicking on that garbage disposal
---
Wouldn’t it be great if graham spawn as a behemoth sometimes only with bigger better items for sale!!
---
It's a life choice.
---
Deathclaw gauntlet
---
Um, not to burst your bubble, but you have a slice. Only 7 more for the full pie! Good luck!
---
Yeah I guess I’m never home though so I usually take my friends water
---
I think it sounds pretty good. Skins are nice by themselves and all, but this would allow a little bit more flexibility in terms of armor customization.
---
It's one of the official world languages of the UN. It is also spoken in the most countries around the world. So if one were to reference a language as basically universal, English and French would be the most reasonable choices.
---
Huh?
---
Stairs are a royal pain in the *ss, you'll probably have to rese your camp
---
NICE. Just gotta play for another 1750 hours.
---
The discussion is about whether it's widely spoken in Japan. It's not. 
---
Sure it's the worldwide lingua franca, but that's not going to help in Fukuoka.
---
hmm,  i never turned on the radio.  the ambient music is nice enough
---
Woo! Welcome to the pie in the sky club!
---
Move your camp.
---
Foundation is too high or low.
---
You'll need to place it at a different height and see if you can remove stairs after attaching them again.
---
If locked again, move again and adjust foundation height.
---
It's a currently know glitch/bug.
---
That was what was known originally as the Plasma Rifle in the OGs and they renamed for NV right? Always down for the idea of bringing weapons over from the original games.
---
The dissonance between weapons on each of the coasts does make sense but personally I'd like to see some more cross-overs. Even the original 10mm Pistol is a different one than the 10mm featured in Fallout 3/4/76.
---
I can build all except toolbox and cooler
---
I basically what pre war money being used instead of caps because it fits in the fallout lore.
---
I think they recently took that out, whether intentionally or not, I'm not sure. I definitely remember it used to because I had to farm copper to make wires, but I built recently and noticed it no longer seemed to consume (or even say it consumes) any copper.
---
Because only in Fallout 76 do we get people who are fine spending money on a game that is beyond utterly fucking broken. Keep up the praise fan boy and you won't see the improvements this game deserves and desperately needs, and you'll find yourself with no posts, whining or not.
---
Yes those challenges have been bugged since the scout dlc dropped but the daily events drop possom badges so this is how I’ve acquired my backpack mods, I’ve received them not just from campfire tales but also stings and things and the mutagenic waste tidy up one. As for the beer keg I haven’t seen anyone say they have it on this subreddit but perhaps there’s an issue with it, Bethesda disabled the punch bowl functionality because people were putting nukashine in there and sending new players all over the map so I guess it will be available if the punch bowl is ever fixed so it won’t hold nukashine
---
&gt; what is it then
---
it's not spoken in Japan, is what
---
How do players walk through Fatman shots like nothing happened? Same answer.
---
Maybe. As for the extension to Fallout 4... 76 is a simulation man, it is all a conspiracy, we are all in the pods that were in Fallout 3, living in a simulation, Vault-Tec is watching
---
I grew up in Morgantown and the accent is mostly “northern”. I’ve noticed a kind of dividing line starting at Clarksburg. Below Clarksburg you get the thick WV accent. Above Clarksburg you get the “light” or nonexistent accent. Few exceptions are the random hollers around Morgantown/Preston County.
---
I mean in fallout 4 you can sell 1 prewar money for 1 cap 🤷‍♂️
---
thanks
---
You can find a few at Pumpkin House and Freddy Fear's. I think there are a few with different carvings, like the Vault-Tec logo. These would make great CAMP decorations, for sure
---
English has more people learn it as a second language than it has native speakers itself. Many countries use it for adminstration and it is incredibly widespread compared to.. Japanese being in Japan.
---
Also the circlejerk for Japan is insane. I guess it's smart, whatever that even means.
---
Google says the most common second language learned in Japan is English. So other than Japanese if the person is bilingual, they probably know English. But we should probably stop generally so much anyway.
---
They are shy... Cuz the anime you watch portrays them as shy or you're a weeaboo...?
---
I am actually interested if you have been to Japan or are from it. You make a lot of claims and maybe you know it direct from the source?
---
They didnt drop as legendaries for the longest time but a patch or two ago they added them in. So if you look around hard enough you'll find one eventually.
---
If you’re still interested in helping, we’re short handed.
---
God you are stupid. No ones prying your wallet open who gives a fuck if players enjoy the Atom shop.
---
Cloth
---
Fuck yes it would be. Also it would be cool to be able to loot tiny bits of that power armor when defeated.
---
Yea but I what pre money to but use for buying stuff
---
Cranberries aren’t hard to get. You can find them at aaronholt farm.  North of the dirt track in the forest
---
are you available now? i don’t mind those much to be honest!
---
I would suggest nuking the site, but I doubt even that would help with the base-building bugs!
---
I can get on tomorrow night at the earliest, sorry, Will you be around then?
---
Well that explains the scarcity, and eases the mind a bit. Thank you.
---
how many hours sorry I live in Aus to its night time 1 AM for me right but yeah i should be
---
Try putting a floor on, then find your way back down another staircase and then foundation. 
---
...maybe do this in a way that isn't too impossible to work with... If by chance this makes it worse
---
For the record, a better way to kill a bare is to bring it's health down extremely low and then hit it with a syringe
---
Is there actually any chance it might help?
---
Np
---
It would be 9 hours from now tomorrow, so about 10 am for you
---
.50 cal definitley degrades faster but it's still one of the highest durability weapons in the game. It fires like 10x faster so it's kind of expected. I wouldn't really want to use gatling gun on SBQ because it has substantially lower dps, but for everything else it's fine.
---
ah yeah that’d work well, i’ll shoot you a message then. what’s your gamer tag
---
Well the Plasma Caster was the NV rename yeah, but it was always a Winchester P94 from my understanding as they were quite specific in what companies produced what energy weapon back then! I specified Plasma Caster over Plasma Rifle as most players are more familiar with the modern handheld plasma rifles!
---
Thasher41
---
He goofed. He once was a legendary fighter, but he fell asleep on a watch and let some human sneak in and steal the mini guns. They made him atone.
---
It should help. If your max health is 100 then you'd sit at 30. If after life giver is added we say your health is 130, then the 30% becomes 39, so you get a bonus 9 points.
---
Do side quests. I was in a similar position as you, mostly followed just the main quest line and got to belly of the beast quest at level 28. Events help too, they may not give a lot of xp, but most of them are quick so you can do a lot of them in a relatively short period of time. Also, explore – at level 28 I still had most of the forest unexplored, discovering new locations and clearing them of enemies gave me steady supply of xp.
---
&gt; Google says the most common second language learned in Japan is English.
---
It's the most commonly _taught_, in mandatory classes in junior high. How many Americans speak Spanish from their mandatory classes in high school?
---
&gt; They are shy.
---
It's a stereotype they cop to themselves. More of a joke than serious comment, but with a grain of truth.
---
&gt; I am actually interested if you have been to Japan or are from it.
---
I've lived here half my life.  My career is based on being bilingual so I can provide the missing English skills the Japanese teams don't possess.
---
Not counting ammo efficiency or how expensive ammo is to craft or maintain my order as follows.  BE LMG&gt;BE 50&gt;BE Energy Heavy&gt;BE Gatling&gt;BE Harpoon. I have all the above guns.  For overall dps the king is hands down the LMG by a wide margin.
---
Xbox right?
---
flog is another word for sell, like "i'll flog you my watch for a fiver"

“Run! Run away!! Arggg” - scream legendary suicider super mutant
---
No shit its not CoD. I dislike CoD expect CoD2 and MW, replayed it for the nostiglic feel... thats when I realized that FO76 is in a far shitter state than the hack filled CoD:MW. Legit felt no difference in the gameplay.  I enjoy Rust PvP, fyi. This game doesn't have PvP, it has one shot tag, revenge, tag, spawn camp, repeat process.   
---
I have no problem with VATS, I have a problem with it being usable to two shotting with a pistol, from stealth, without having to aim because VATs gives them 100% accuracy on the first hit, and a 100% accuracy crit kill on the second.   
---
Nerfed the shit out of TSE's huh? To the point of what? From god weapon to jesus weapon? There is a reason they are still being sold on sites for $50, right next to Assassin's handmades. 
---
This post was to pick out and point out the flawless of mostly PvP, of course there are going to be more. No doubt you probably picked up your handmade for $50 (or had it duped), followed a youtuber's broken ass build (with them even mentioning how fucking stupid boring and broken it is), and for once get to feel like your dick isn't two inches. Fucking disgusting that you are defending this mess. I don't want a carbon copy, I want the developer to stablize the game and be vigliant about keeping it stable.
---
thanks, that sounds very promising. I'll just have to free up some of the budget, but I will try it when I get to play again
---
Never actually seen what happens to a nuked base, sorry.
---
Ok, just realized it wasn't listed, see yoy tomorrow dude
---
Need some water after this post because damn it was salty.

Tips that helped me work around the current camp issues.
---
1) before doing anything, place your foundation and attach a metal stairs. If the stairs is able to be removed, continue. If the stairs can not be removed, start over and adjust how high or low you place your foundation. Too high or too low causes the"iitem would be floating/structure needs support" errors. Foundation has to be just right and nothing will be locked into place.
---
2) after foundation is good and you can attach and remove items --- start building from the top down. Currently, nothing can be placed above stairs. Floors, walls, decorations, nothing. Work around this by placing your stairs in an area you DO NOT want it to stay. Build your upper floor. Then go back to the lower floor and move the stairs to the location you want it. Then back to the upper floor to fill in the area you couldn't due to the original stairs.
---
QoL tips
---
1) use advanced power conduits to run wires through walls, floors and ceilings. You could turn a section of wall into a door, run the wire through the door then turn it back into a wall.... I have experienced issues with this glitch that cuts power off, says items are intersecting when they aren't and more. Suggest using the built in method of the advanced power conduits.
---
2)  hook up vendors to a switch behind locked doors. One of the new griefing methods is to turn your vendors off if on a switch. If it's behind locked doors they can't without becoming wanted... Then you have an open invitation to kill them and take their junk. 😁
---
3) If you place a decon shower, put it on a keypad switch and put the code below it. I've had people turn the shower on and leave which stops people running unyeilding, bloodied and/or mutations from entering my camp cause the shower would take their benefits away. Keypad switch auto turns off after a few seconds.
---
It worked
---
Meanwhile us UK folks are still stuck with Cyka Blyat
---
Some random person dropped one for me lol
---
&gt; you should probably mention you are from Japan
---
As if my username doesn't give it away? lol
---
Yeah silencer was one of them.
---
Dude wtf are you smoking?
---
Still stacks from what I can tell.
---
I got one in the first two weeks and haven't gotten another since lmao
---
50 cal has high DPS but it’s not the best, that title goes to a prime LMG
---
Claudia... I love it. I'm sorry for your loss!
---
Singapore too actually and most of SEA.
---
The only way for me to play in NA server is to befriend and join a NA player and boy was it different.
---
Lol it’s always these posts
---
Sorry to but into this....what about something that can be wielded in Power Armor?
---
Looks like it was an incredible fluke, I just did 12 and only got 1 mod. :-( Oh well, I will definitely take getting 6 in 10 tries even if it was a fluke.
---
Yes, the *creative director of BGS* that's currently working on Starfield went to Austin and said: "HEY. Put Aussies and New Zealanders and Japanese players together for shit and giggles," because he's the guy Bethesda goes to when they need to make decisions about servers or the company's bussines. He is, afterall, the *creative director BGS.* It's not like there's people on a higher paygrade who handle that stuff.
---
Also, don't know if you got the memo, but the Oblivion's engine isn't being used anymore.
---
Just looked it up and max health bonus from life giver is +45. Without anything else that boosts health percentage, that would be 13.5 more health when sitting at 30%. 9 more health when at 20%.
---
My response was to you saying it's not universal
---
I would like that idea. They could make it where we can't place a lot of them to keep balance if they are worried about that.
---
Yeah, I just did 12, got 1 mod.
---
I don’t use mutations, the only thing I miss is the +20 carry weight Marsupilian gives.
---
I would not really care if it wasn't partly blocking my turrets, the budget drain from two items is not the end. I already finished bulding so I don't need it to be movable, I just need it gone
---
I saw a quad one in a player vendor last night. I almost bought it for 6000 caps just to have one. First one I'd ever seen tbh
---
fr, and apply something like it costing 10 caps to interact and get (a chance) at something really good (like maybe a plan or something. Or maybe get materials.
---
I'm set up on the iron node just up the hill from it, it's my little behemoth farm.
---
Absolutely nothing. Whats the top build right now? sent/assassins auto rifle crit, 100% stealth?   
---
The meta right now is 100% invisable, 100% accuracy auto-aim shot, 2 shot kill. No counter. Not even full tank spec stops two 10mm shots from killing you, power armor or not.  
---
Cause that makes sense.
---
It's your job to make this item that can be easily found in the world seem worthwhile to other people. Right now it's only worth it's weight in cloth because there's no authority or wealth backing it, and it's something that the game system itself identifies as Junk and will not recognize it as currency. I've seen players dealing in Mr. Fuzzy tokens because they were worth something to that player - if you want pre-war money to be worth anything there has to be a demand for it's use
---
&gt; and for once get to feel like your dick isn't two inches. 
---
Sorry about the misunderstanding my dick is longer than 2 inches you're just seeing what doesn't fit in your wife. I can see why you're confused. Still don't know why you like to watch? but hey to each thier own.
---
😲 I never realized the nukashine! 🤣. I mean, dick move to a brand new player but that would have me laughing if I drank it.
---
Ok will u help do it
---
I’ll be on today!
---
Very nice.
---
Amen.
---
a major G8 nation doesn't have widespread fluency so I don't know that "universal" is appropriate.  
---
"most widespread", certainly.

wasn't the only way to get shielded currently through the dev room...?

Why exactly is West Virginia one of the U.S’s poorest states in comparison to, say, Wisconsin or Illinois?
---
Back about the second or third Patch, Task Manager was partially disabled when Fallout is running.  Ctrl-Alt-Del will flash the popup on the screen for a second and then it disappears.  Using the -Windows- button to return to the desktop allows me to kill the Loader but not Fallout itself.  Task Manager doesn't work from the desktop, either.  Only solution (for me) is a machine restart.
---
Yes I know the requirements just havent had the RNG and not really worth putting any more time into it
---
im out of the loop but check in every so often.  Can someone link a picture of a typical base vs one of these elaborate bases?
---
Ya but unmovable means undeletable right now. So if not willing to move camp and restart, you'll have to try the suggestion to attach more parts... But it'll be tricky getting the other foundation set at the right height to allow moving when the original is too high or low already.
---
Other option is to wait for a patch.
---
I brought this up couple days ago, downvoted bigly
---
the reason this method is used is if one purifier break it doesnt disable all the others in the chain, where as if you chained them up you could cut the power to them all by taking out one purifier.
---
Yes :)
---
i doubt you step away from this game enough to be in anyone's wife, let alone your fat fucking hands
---
In a similar vein; forbid a player from doing damage until everything is rendered in.
---
Had a player, just now, that was unable to break into my camp (via the current route of \[splash damage\] -&gt; \[tags player\] -&gt; \[opens camp to damage\]) after throwing Nuka Grenades and shooting an explosive weapon at it.  
---
All they had to do was log out, relog, run  over before my camp rendered in. Invulnerable camps like mine are lame, as-is exploiting rendering.
---
Why bother with pvp anyway, its an rpg and it will probably never be good because it wasnt meant to be
---
His first mini nuke was a dud and probably killed a lvl 100 player with it
---
thank you, I will try placing floors to the original and connect to second stairs somewhere further away  and see if that will work
---
Pardon me if I'm rude, but you're supposed to use big letters only on names and on the first letter. After a (....) too. Btw, not after these things (,,,)
---
Writing every words first letter in big letter makes it hard and painful for us to read. It's also generally associated with being dumb, but I'm sure you're quite smart - grammar is hard. :)
---
Well, I fell through the floor. If it cant, then it was a glitch that happened twice.
---
cause, for once the fallout series is multiplayer and I'd like to see it in a state where we can actually RPG as PVPers
---
I was hyped to see raider squads, communities build, actual markets
---
instead we got no-life, two inch dick, try hard, fat ass sofa boys (totatally not using someones name to make a previous point) running around with a pseudo hack build running around one/two shotting people, completely killing any dream and chance of rpgpvp
---
Purchase a second account. Then when running the game on your main account, go into the fallout 76 folder and run fallout76.exe. Log in with your 2nd account. You're now running two instances of the game.
---
Mine’s pretty basic, but I keep my doors &amp; purifiers unlocked. And by the time I circle back, they’re still full, since they fill up so quickly. 
---
Might as well let someone else get some PW, right?
---
Oh, you. Got me at the end ;-)
---
Just a little bit of cannibalism is fine tho
---
Let me add: fantastic tool. Anyways, it would be great to be able to calculate the stats for Blade of Bastet and its 100% armor piercing when using Garb and Eye of Ra
---
Yes just get plans for automatic receiver by scrapping handmade or buying it. 
---
If you are on ps4 I can put one on for you
---
Just a wee taste.
---
Depends do i get a chance at leg. Power armor?
---
I know that no one is prying open my wallet, I think that they make some pretty neat stuff in there. But, that is what this game is, and all that is going to be if they don't get thier shit together and stablize it. A fucking money sink for the stupid.
---
American here.  Seen a Japanese player last week.
---
Wait they changed them D: ? Yeees :D
---
Pretty sure they have less perception than ghouls do.
---
You realize it's different people working on the Atom shop? They don't just shut down and say guys we're gonna work on bugs this week. They have multiple teams working on stuff simultaneously
---
I think they took that out back in FO4. I don’t remember ever seeing cooper used up for wires in FO76.
---
Just be aware, if not perfect, that will become locked too.
---
Also, I have not tried this. It was suggested by a couple other users as a way they fixed it.
---
I can not confirm this option.
---
I mean, they'd have to move pretty slow if they remained lore friendly. A suit of power armor with no functioning core isn't the easiest to use
---
Oh my bad maybe it was your Sister... wait you like to watch me bang your sister? That's kind of gross....
---
all legandaries are great at one thing: running away from the fight
---
Can fisto be the dj
---
You can also find plans and mods for it, I forgot which vendor it might be watoga Bos. Your Looking for the automatic, focused, tweaked or prime auto receivers.
---
Not sure, yet.
---
But I am sure something must be wrong about shielded casual plans.
---
The thing is I was offering 25K caps (or even more) for it here and there during one month... and I got not a single offer.
---
No it was duping never anything with nukashine being in the punch bowl
---
I guess there’s a life lesson right there “don’t take glowing blue drinks from strangers” lol 😂
---
Congrats on getting pie. As for selling it for $25,000 caps that’s unreal. I’ve seen someone else have one for sale for $25,000 caps too. I went on to the next vendor and bought one for $25.    :)
---
Would a VPN let you access other servers? I suppose I could go try, have a subscription to Vypr but mostly use it on my portable devices. 
---
I have yet to hear the classic Aussie accent online but I've seen a fair share of Japanese players. Haven't come across any of these excellent camps however.
---
Well said.  👍
---
I was a bigger fan of Fallout 3 than nv. But definitely enjoy nv more than 4. Idk I just don't get the whole idea of how power armor requires a fusion core. And a frame. When it didn't before. Idk. And there's one on Android as well! I have it, just miss it in game
---
YTA no consent.../s
---
My pet doesn't show up red. It shows white and "owned." I have figured out that if it gets lowered health, hopping servers gets it back to 100%. Just about everyone that visits my camp is surprised to see him and asks how to do it. It's great at defending my little shop.
---
No, but it's poor game design that you had the need to do that
---
I just tried this. No blooms
---
That isn’t what he means. There’s tons of things that lock your character into an animation that won’t let you use a stimpack
---
Yes, it ~~made the news~~ was copy and pasted off Reddit as usual
---
Then use the meathook my DC gauntlet does abt 2k w 2/3 bloodied and no unarmed perks though so they’re good to invest in too
---
Didn’t work for me
---
YO SHIT A SCORCHBEAST! HEY! YOSHITA SCORCHBEAST
---
Not at this moment because most powerful builds are bloodied (very low hp)
---
The Creation Engine is a Gamebryo fork. If you look at the code, they literally took Gamebryo and grafted code on top of it.
---
That's part of why half of the shit in their games don't work properly.
---
Could've been me. I have 3 listed at 25,000 apiece.
---
Largely, because I don't want them to sell. Never nabbed one in many hours of playing FO4
---
Not sure how u r getting badges from the events. I'm not getting an from those.
---
In English "," is a comma.
---
How long is it going to last? I'm not going to come on immediately, but I'll come when I can. Got other games to play, like Metal Gear Solid 3. If the thing lasts for only a few hours, I'll probably come immediately. 
---
Also, was just making sure what to do etc. Thanks though, let's hope we can do shit today. If I can get on. And everyone else.
---
You don't like the game don't play it the PVP is what it is you can 1 shot most enemies in this game so why should players be different. I would almost bet that you are one of the Cod players that whine when I go 14-5 with a blunderbuss on second thought your probably a camper and go 5-19 on a match.
---
Should last between 7 and 9 hours. We need as many people who can run silos as possible.
---
Definitely not staying for 7-9 hours. But will try to come on though.
---
I feel like Ted Cruz I don't always agree with ScientistRickSanchez (Aoc) but I agree with him on this.
---
I agree with this not necessarily on the grounds that it’s too hard to find something to tame, but rather that it’s too easy to lose what you’ve tamed after you’ve put the work in.
---
Someone on here calculated the drop rate to be a 20% chance which feels about right but just in case luck or charisma has anything to do with event rewards I always pop a day tripper, formula P or iguana soup just before the bits are awarded, I also have high luck and charisma due to my armour (unyielding) so I don’t know if that helps at all
---
We need to see some permanence to the Perk Tree. Make it so once you have your points spent, you get one free re-roll at some arbitrary level (75, 100?). From there on, if you want to re-roll your stats, you pay for it.
---
Would make having multiple characters actually viable. Right now the only factor is character level and gear, since perks can be swapped out at pretty much any time.
---
I know.
---
ID Tech 6 is a fork of ID Tech 5, ID Tech 4 is a fork of ID Tech 3, ID Tech 2 is a fork GLQuake, GLQuake is a fork of Quake. Would you call them 'the same engine'?
---
Tip for maximizing base height... If you can find a way to place your actual CAMP unit higher off the ground you can make your base that much higher. How to do this? Find a tower or something else to anchor off of. Place CAMP at base of tower. Assuming the tower isn't accessible with a normal stairway, jetpack, or marsupial, build a stairway from the ground up onto the tower, then re-place your CAMP unit higher up on the structure. Start rebuilding with a newly increased height cap.
---
The CAMP height is limited in a sphere around the CAMP unit in 360 degrees. If you place your CAMP on the ground and build up, you are effectively only using half of your overall vertical space.
---
Should be free.
---
Yes u can, u will have to scrap handmades to get upgrades plans for it. 
---
Or find someone here to upgrade it for you.
---
Probably 15 scrip
---
Please add this Bethesda.
---
Our economy was always dependent on coal for the most part is why we are so poor now. Don’t get me wrong some part of the state thrives like Morgantown and Charleston but for the rest of the state never had a diversified economy so when coal stopped selling as much as it used to we all took a hit. Now we have some of the highest drug addiction rates and one of the highest poverty rates in the nation too
---
Lol.
---
Ghouls will certainly provide you with a good amount of laughs. Sometimes their ragdoll when they die is hilarious, and of course they’re just tripping over everything all the time. Wonderful improvements to Ghouls in 76
---
It's called super sledge or grognak axe
---
I don't think anyone has been banned for using quality of life mods, been using this one for months with no contact from BGS.
---
I suppose you could argue such mods make it easier for me to fight other players, but I'm pve and don't change my loadout all the time, just when I need to change from melee 1h 2h unarmed or to rifle/sneak, couldn't shan't play without it now, will just delete the game I think at that stage.
---
Or the Glock 86 Plasma Defender!
---
Smart!
---
You can think of it as a 1* Explosive minigun - -.5k isn’t unreasonable.
---
No man. Have you found one yet? I still haven't and am about to give up and stick with some of the other methods people have posted.
---
Yes.
---
Gamma guns or any kind of radiation.
---
Automatic radium rifle. Vats commando build
---
Meathook but you have to stack unarmed and 1h melee perks. Not worth it IMO. It’s like 9 extra perks if you try and grab all the 1h perks, and it doesn’t make it crazy more than a DCG/PF, just a bit better. Power fist with puncturing mod otherwise.
---
No idea why every thinks DCG is the best. I have a 3rd claw DCG and Puncturing power fist, they both show the same damage in my pip-boy but the Puncturing mod adds some armor pierce, so technically it will either do the same damage (if you are already overwhelming their armor) or slightly more (if your base damage isn’t already overwhelming their armor).
---
Not gonna lie I don't understand V.A.T.S and how to use them.
---

---
Haha just a one star, mine always pop up as 3 stars then kills itself after i tag it from the spawn point but for some dumb reason its explode radius is so huge it manages to kill. And not to mention its legendary troubleshooters wood armor drop for all my troubles .
---
When you use it like that yes, but in reference to a location/building it is the same as thunderbox :P
---
Same here i put one up for 1000 caps for bragging rights lol first time I’ve ever gotten one
---
So far I have randonly recieved 3 pies from the machines, pissed my partner off because he has 3 times the luck and actually tries to get the pie.
---
You still need full sneak perks. On my main I can sneak past them. My low level, even with a stealth boy III, got shot down from 100 yards away.
---
Thank you for that advice! I’m going to go for either a DCG or fist.
---
Targeting missile launcher. Their bolstering armor isn't gonna do shit against a single high damage shot
---
Yeah, I mean you could have a mishmash of wires sprawling all over your camp.....
---
You can also not get up in the morning.
---
Faction checks out
---
I want to see some schorched enclave, or a scorched version of modus, that creepy bastard.
---
I question my camp building abilities whenever I see one it’s a mixture of wow this might of took them a long to or wow you spend some much money on atomic points because the camp looks like the atomic shop
---
[ALL hated that.]
---
I know. I'm a bad person
---
Not unarmed, then. Combat knife for fast 1h, Assaultron blade for medium 1h, super sledge, Grognak axe for 2h. Heavily modded sledgehammers are supposedly close to super sledges as well (I mean, basically at that point they’re the same thing, mechanically speaking)
---
For real
---
I guess we share the same unpopular opinion
---
You can only get them from the purveyor. Legendary pipe revolvers were never in the legendary drop pool, and I have not seen any proof that the latest updates added them in. So for now, just hope to get lucky with mama murmfsjdfdnshjbfghjdfgdfh or find a player who got one.
---
Hey, sorry for the delay I meant to check my storage character yesterday and totally forgot. I don't have any extras at the moment. I tagged your username on my looking for spread sheet and will definitely let you know when I score another one. Is it just the red you're looking for?
---
I have like 6 copies of action boy while I already have a lvl 3 action boy equipped.
---
Mutations doesn't affect your chems apart from healing factor, the one i used once and hated deeply 😂
---
It looks like dead because since there is no serverwide popup most didn't see it beside you are watching the map the whole time.
---
And those two guys which see it - well that's not enough.
---
Sometimes, though, you get unlucky like me and for some reason when you scrap them, you get every single scope, stock, muzzle attachment, and semi auto receiver before you even get a single auto receiver.
---
Pfthhh this is nothing kill those pet them make a meal from it and leave it in a bag on their bed (raider life)
---
"hears the whistling sound of an mini nuke"
---
Me: Oh, fuck.
---
Its a sign they are finally moving on from this game or the player count so low they could merge servers. Either way not looking good for the worse Fallout game ever released to get any redemption.
---
I got the meat and cooked mutt chops
---
I think they are grouped up with stautes and the vault boy garden gnome. You have to scroll a bit.
---
That could even be something to look into for a future event. Maybe something passed the current sbq
---
Junk is your most valuable resource below level 5.  You need to craft armor, weapons, mods for those weapons, and CAMP essentials.  IMO, it's pretty scummy to lure mobs anywhere without dealing w
---
I can run up to ghouls and they see me at the last moment, right before i kill them.
---
AA or executioner crit shots with a dragon. Rads generation as others have said. Otherwise, the heavy .50 call with the heavy weapon stagger perk.
---
I was thinking ghouls, but yeah--something humanoid in power armor would be terrifying.
---
Can’t log in today but literally every day this past week had 2-3 camera challenges. What am I missing?
---
People are getting very bored very fast. The rewards aren't as good as they should be. And most items are at player vendors now.
---
And of course, each one of these "youtubers" has a store to buy Fallout 76 items from.
---
True. Today was pretty much that what most of us wished for since long time... Hope it stays now.
---
Btw yesterday was still a bit..nah
---
First time sneaking into the corvera basement through the pipe I received a nuke in the face with my unstealthy low level skills. Lol
---
Everything you are wearing gets “suppressed” when in power armor. So it’s your power armor, OR your regular armor, but not both at the same time. 
---
The only exception is if you take off your helmet, you can wear headwear. Since it’s only cosmetic, that’s only useful for challenges.
---
Or Legendaries and 5.56 ammo!
---
...it was a long walk lol.
---
I do this with 2 PS4's, 2 PSN accounts, and single copy Fo76. Good for solo transferring until they add a mailbox or something.
---
Only 1 pic.. the lvl up.. craft booze.. kill 10 robots in watoga... and cant remember that other 1
---
What about a legendary rumered 4 hors scorched protectors  of the wast land 
---
Add in 4 protectrons that believe they should help the scorched  like the imposter sheepsquach but they die fast this should be a random encounter 
---
Then add in an event on random places on the map to fight all 4 of the following 
---
Number 1 scorched moleminer in a raider
---
 powerarmor that looks like it has scorched beast bones on it with a yelow glow
---
Number 2 scorched moleminer in a excavator powerarmor with ultracite crystals growing on it 
---
Number 3 scorched in ultracite powerarmor that has a scorched deathclaw skin on it with a green and yellow glow 
---
Number 4 scorched in a X-o1 powerarmor with white springs resort assaultrons fused to it with a green glow
---
Yes like staggering and jumping.
---
I got one out of a vending machine so far but here is a pro tip - I ask found one on top of the westek research center on a table under an umbrella.  
---
There’s a couple places they occur in the wild!
---
Why you deleting your comments? You act like such a tough guy then delete your ass hattery. You sick of getting owned?
---
Good!
---
The last 2 times my base was attacked (in the last 3 or 4 days) I have not gotten any alarm. A diamond will show on the map if you look, but I get no quest notification or any kind of pop up on my screen. 
---
They need to tweak the notifications for Workshops as well. If you're too far away it seems like you don't always get the "Defend from Intruders" prompt.
---
What do you mean?
---
Or brick windows. Wire through the window, select window and change to wall. Now you got a wire running through the wall without an opening.
---
Seriously? I must have missed that patch note. I've been running about like made collecting legendaries to scrap-for-scrip and keep my shop stocked but I'd yet to find a Legendary Pipe Revolver.
---
We loved the Watoga area (except for the three separate bears we had in our campsite, pm me for details lmao), Point Pleasant and White Sulphuric Springs/The Greenbrier. Amazing how close they got the Greenbrier in game, I led us to the bunker by memory! But overall we loved the entire state!
---
Not jumping and staggering is also not really what he means. It’s seemingly programming oversights more than anything
---
I think this is probably the most likely change. I have a hard time seeing them implementing perk set insti-load. That completely negates the whole idea of having player having to make limited choices for their build. Almost might as well make it so you can just load all the perks you want with no limits.
---
Hey dude, the backpack skin doesn't actually tell you it's unlocked. Like you don't actually get a plan, you just learn it. You might wanna run to an armor bench and see if you've already unlocked it...
---
Last time I tried, had a nice group. We even waited for more players before starting. Figured, finally I'll get a 3, 3 rank finish. As we started the event, server locked, but we could still talk. Haven't gone back.
---
If you need to serverhop for something to be viable, it is a glaring signage screaming "this is broken"
---
In the description of these videos, you will probably find a link to a digital store to buy Fallout 76 items for real money.
---
I personally played fo4 for literrally 7546 hours before moving on to fo76 and that song is the only song on diamond city radio that I just couldn't stand.
---
Survival is totally broken, free for all but camps are in god mode, you drop sit load of your aid what meant you can't really carry useful chems but if you don't carry them you can die freely as there is like 0caps lost on death.
---
Bethesda just need to borrow some balls and so it either pvp focused or survival focused at this moment it's neither it's adventure but more broken them regular adventure mode.
---
What would you like to play today slightly broken/bugged adventure survival or totally broken adventure survival 😂
---
Yay! Making progress lol...
---
Patch notes
---
The regular level up (pretty easy ones, we have well rested/diseased), kill 10 robots in watoga, drink 10 alcoholic beverages, craft 24 camera film, and take a picture of a person in sleepwear at a workshop
---
I was really happy to log in for the first time in a short while and see that today's challenges are NOT complete cancer. Step in the right direction for sure!
---
Find a higher level friend who can escort you through Whitesprings, West Tek, Robo Co, Burrows, or a nuke zone. If you can do it on a survival server even better. Use grenades or something that will allow you to tag every mob before they smash it. This will level you very fast.
---
As for drops, you're only level 22 so getting a "good gun" for you is only temporary until you get to level 45. If you go farm those places you'll get plenty of drops for selling, trading, or keeping.
---
Energy resistance is low-value. Physical damage is a much bigger threat in this game. Personally I prefer marine armor (or heavy robot, but it’s rare!) for the radiation resistance. It’s amazing what a difference 60-100 radiation resistance makes overall. Walking by hazmat barrels, swimming, fighting ghouls... you take far fewer rads. 
---
That all being said, leather armor is still way out of wack, scaling wise. Baseline military-built heavy combat, level 50 arms- 20/20. Some random leather put together by scavvers? 22/47. The fuuuuuck?
---
Sometimes you really do just need to stop and appreciate the wildlife of Appalachia. Magnificent.
---
I think it has a lot to do with good players get pissed when noobs don't do shit and just fuck it up so they stop going. That's why I stopped, I can only take so many groups barely getting a tier 1 when I can almost get a tier 3 by myself. Still need the bear arm plan but it's just not worth it.
---
 A pistol takes care of speed. I run Marsupial, Twisted and Healing factor and that's about it for my Stabby stabby build. The only thing I worry about is Rifle Accuracy and my headshots still work fine.
---
 My Disease Cure and Rad Sheild runs produce lots of these items and I get by. Corn Soup is real easy and I can make lots. ;)
---
 I am not going to,try for 8 points in Luck, 5 will have to do as Bloody Mess and Starched Genes is all that fits.
---
I have a few ones with amazing rolls. They are out there you just have to look hard enough.
---
No it’s not exactly americanization it’s due to how many holdings and colonies the British empire had and how much influence they had at their peak and throughout history all together
---
There have been a few on PC.  Never any on console.   I have always suspected dev room was the cause of those on PC.
---
I've seen three in the last 2 weeks, and never one before that.
---
Brotherhood was more or less attempting to assert their authority over responders. Well meaning but all the diplomatic subtlety of a Klingon.
---
I'll check it out. Thanks for letting me know.
---
He started in management. Survived multiple RIFs and was rewarded for his tenure.
---
Except they are basically unusable when building on uneven terrain. Most of my camps are not fully build on foundations.
---
Why do people bother with stuff like this? I play 100% solo and I've got both the revive requirements for badges just be joining events.
---
PSA: You can fast travel to events in progress and guess what? Somebody gonna die. I revived someone at the Scorched Earth for the dry one and Project Paradise for the water one. 
---
Just always be checking the map for events. High level ones are better, more chance of death and you can even do them at low level because enemies prioritize higher level players to attack. I did Scorched Earth with my level 17 alt and revived someone.
---
I'm not OP, but I was born and raised in WV. Growing up, I was always aware of the Mothman, Grafton Monster and the Flatwoods Monster (although we mostly called it the Braxton County Monster). Personally, I had never heard of the Snallygaster or the Wendigo (doesn't mean they're not part of the lore, they just weren't popular in my area). To me, the design of the Mothman in the game is a little different than the folklore (seems wider and shorter). Now, the statue in the game in Point Pleasant looks more like the folklore. Grafton Monster has taken on many forms in folkore, but I really like the game design. Flatwoods Monster looks similar to folklore design.
---
I'll rock em' roll em' all night long i'm a sixty minute man
---
One time a guy came literally bought out my entire shop, almost 12k worth of weapons, armor, plans, etc. it was a very good day
---
Nope! I was born and raised in Putnam County.
---
Yep. Imposter Sheeosquatch and Paradise we're both deserted for me yesterday. I've been jumping servers and they all seem dead...like, only 6 to 10 other players.
---
That's the joke
---
That’s why I keep getting disconnected in Australia, because we share servers ~14,000km (7000m) away?
---
They're probably afraid they'll have that one dumb ass American on their flight who gets pissed that they aren't being catered to, or sees the emergency exit and thinks "I need some fresh air" /s
---
And yet I don't deal with delay if I wait for animation to end. And while in PA i have no delay because PA removes animation
---
You might want to clarify you are talking about PVP. Assassin is useless in PVE
---
I really like this idea!  The Scorched are pretty lame right now so I would like to see an overhaul with them.
---
I could see that Raiders who became Scorched wear T-45d and T-51b Power Armor that look Tribal like the Bone Raider Excavator with the bones and stuff.  Maybe they can drop Plans for Rusted skins?
---
Scorched Brotherhood of Steel soldiers wield Gatling Lasers.  They could also be another source for their paint.
---
Pre-War Military soldiers who became Scorched would drop Plans for the Military Paint.  Currently you can only get it for X-01 Power Armor but the Army used both T-45d and T-51b.
---
One chameleon piece. One auto stim. The rest I want to swap out, but like the other commenter, I run weight reduction. FDC is x3 pieces with the other 2 being ammo. Traveling pharmacy and thru hiker to hit 90% on the food/drink/chems and then 1 ammo weight perk to get close on that. Junk weight and energy weight perks to round out the set. Lol. 
---
Last I tried, taking off all perks and armor set me at something like 850 pounds. Putting them back on I was at 201. 
---
I want to keep my weight reduction, but get AP refresh for sure. Still undecided on the main trait. Almost want weightless.
---
someone made a legend about him
---
Ok you don’t know what he’s talking about have a good one
---
 You can shoot missiles at me all day. I just laugh. All you need is 3 Fireproof and a Dense Chest to be almost immune to explosions. Had a Scrochbeast setting off cars as I farmed ghouls at The Whitespring, just fun for me, but the ghouls die to her, so not ideal but hey.
---
 I will just came and stab you to death laughing all the way.
---
You know there is one on the top of west tek....for free. No one will pay 25k for pie
---
Here you have two: https://youtu.be/TfuAWm9I8GU
---
https://youtu.be/CEBe7KlLDvI
---
And that's on the first 5 videos I've seen.
---
Found the Marine
---
I have the plans, but the weapons themselves just aren't that good.  Anything that can't be Legendary when it comes to weapons has an inherent disadvantage.  The Sheepsquatch weapons are just more middling melee options we really don't need more of.
---
I wasn't planning to build for a cryolator. What's the benefit of using that?
---
 They are light too, so carrying one is no big deal.
---
It slows enemies and it works on bosses like sheep or sbq and slow is really significant more then 50% and last like 30 seconds
---
Exactly, for PVE, SENT/UNYIELDING is best option. Afaik
---
That's nice and all but but don't share it. This gives more players a chance to exploit Fallout 76.
---
You did it. You won FO76. 
---
For real though I managed to get one of these super damn early on my main character. 222 levels later? Nothing. Never again would I taste those sweet preservatives.
---
Yup been using that, just having bad luck, I only get to play a few hours a week.
---
You are pathetic. Yes, ban it from the internet! Silence them! Sad.
---
Can we get a Flog chain going? 
---
Everyone who wants to know, already does.
---
I would have gone with the Ski Sword for 1h over the Assaultron Blade for the same reason to mention the Power Fist above - it has an armor penetrating mod.
---
I think if you use Formula P on yourself it heals them.
---
Thanks for clarifying my fellow vault dweller
---
What's pathetic is idiots who take advantage of a game and cheat to get things to them. Cheaters are pathetic so I don't see how I am pathetic. *Puts a pacifier in your mouth* grow up dude
---
Personally I've just not had the inclination to check out the new event yet. I get anxious thinking about how tough it is and never seeing anyone else piling in. Maybe I'm just unlucky. Yesterday was the first time in weeks I've seen more than a single level &lt;100 player start the encrypted event too. Usually it's just a single scrub.

*Whispers* "Test them with Aligned Mods"

I like marine armor, it’s got well-rounded stats. But the legendary effects are most important to me. I only PvE; PvP in this game is too broke . For my stealth bloodied vats sniper, it’s all unyielding, with a mix of rad resist, poison resist, +agi/per/luck secondaries, and a couple Acrobat third stars. Dense torso on chest, ultralight on everything else. 
---
My HW main lives in power armor; he’s also a bloodied build. His regular armor is a mishmash of pieces, all unyielding +int or +charisma for crafting and selling (only times I get out of my PA), all modded ultralight to weigh less while I’m in PA.
---
My full-health unarmed melee character is focused on being a tank, so mostly marine or heavy combat, mix of Vanguard and enemy-specific primaries, poison resist, rad resist, and powered secondaries. Don’t have many 3star pieces on him yet, he’s new.
---
Vats too locks you out of stim.  Have to leave vats to stim sucks till you get the hang of it
---
Just read through comments and the exploit is patched.
---
Considering the vast majority of Creation Engine is the same and has the exact same issues of Gamebryo, yes I would say that it is the same thing in this case.
---
I might have one but I'm on ps4. forget the enchants but its 3*
---
Vats locks you out of using your stains.  Took me a while to get that one
---
I can do them. meatgoat36
---
Is it maxed? I frequently use a TSE Garling on the queen - lasts a full time queen every time. Same for my Vampire Plasma Gatling - I can go through 15 cores easy before a repair is actually needed.

next time it says your camp can't be placed don't click find a new world stay on that world then leave server you won't have the issue with the vending machine anymore.
---
 My Meathook with just the Melee perksand extra Hooks goes out around around 340. My Combat Knives, granted they are +40% speed, do more DPS. 
---
 I have tested so many Medium Weapons and my Combat Knives are just better. I have an 3* AA Shishkabab with Extra Flames and 40% Speed and I may scrip it today as the Combat Knives are just better.
---
Sure buddy
---
Also, thanks for selling the Medic's +50 Crit damage Plasma pistol\~
---
Yes, that one is. But all you need to do is get in certain discord channels and communities (on console) to get a working method.
---
IMO, the DCG and Mole Miner Gauntlet just look cooler.  But they seem to lack armor penetration options (unless there's something we just don't know about their damage output), so the Puncturing Power Fist pretty much always wins out.
---
Technically, the Meat Hook hits harder (same deal with lack of armor penetration though), but only because Gladiator and Iron Fist stack on it.  It's naturally inferior on its own, or if it's just one perk or the other - a distinct possibility if Bethesda ever changes it.
---
Thank you for sharing. This is incredibly valuable.

I think it would still be nice to award players with the challenge-locked legendary items. Just have them delivered to the player in Adventure Mode by the Mr. Prize-Bot or something.

The Brotherhood in west virginia used T51b not T60, infact T60 shouldnt even exist in 76.
---
Hmmm I always forget the ski sword, I think it looks ridiculous (and realistically speaking shouldn’t even come close to the others, damage wise). 
---
Do the mods get fire axe and sledgehammer that close, though? One thing about 2h melee spec is between Incisor, and how much damage you are usually doing with a 2h spec, you’re often overwhelming their armor, at which point extra armor piercing doesn’t matter. So if the base damage is worse, it stays worse overall. At least between DCG and PF, they have the same base damage.
---
Its a way for the server to reset a decayed nuke zone enemies when they are present (gets rid of the glowing ones and such).
---
Yes, maxed perk and 13 luck.
---
I have tried to do arktos event and it kept crashing me back to home screen apart from one attempt where nobody came and it ended badly, I haven't attempted it since. I'm hoping they fix whatever's going on to crash so many players to home screen with the next update, hopefully then at least more players may try it again. I want the backpack skin plan and the stimpack diffuser plan to complete the tadpole badge but for now I'll just wait and hope they improve the events stability.
---
\&gt; Bethesda changed taming so now you need animal friend to tame a Deathclaw and you cant tame by aiming, you need to go right next to it and a tame option appears. 
---
UGH... thank you for this!!! I'm level 166, have 6 Charisma (so more than enough) *just* so that I could have both Rank 3 perks equipped, and have been trying to tame something since friggen level 100... Never was I able, only would read "Pacify".
---
Then for awhile, I thought it was glitched because I would get (on PC) "\[E\] Pacify" **and** "\[Space\] Pacify"... but either one only pacified them :\\ 
---
I'd all but given up, but tried again when they made some 'fixes' in Patch 8/8.5. Yet, still no luck which resulted in me thinking maybe taming as a whole was broke or vastly changed.
---
Now that I've seen 2 people in 2 days have a tamed Deathclaw, hope restored... and now with your key info... HOT DAMN! I'MA FINALLY GETS ME A PET, GORRAMIT!! :D :D :D

Pretty sure that 300 damage direct impact doesn't count as explosive damage, only the actual explosion does. And unlike most things in this game, the targeting scope does actually work pretty well
---
Cannibalism, capitalism. The Hornwrights ate their neighbor the Garrahans, in a sense.  Got to feed the need.
---
Especially since the virtue was supposed to be demonstrating was "kindness."
---
You are too funny lmao to to quote you don't cater to players demands
---
&gt;Bethesda,
---
&gt;If one thing being a near life-long survival and MMO player has taught me, it is that catering to people can absolutely destroy a game.
---
Have fun being ignored lmao this is Karma and you are dumb
---
How much do you sell acid and sugar for?
---
Yeah you can clearly see the crop of hops he has prepared for his Coopers home brew kit.

It's on a timer. Just wait for the server wide announcement to be radio'ed in.

&gt; You are no better than big tobacoo.

TIL video games cause lung disease and kill people by the millions.

Hes a mutated vault dweller. When he dies he just respawns but he already leveled up from the kill.

---
I remember that sale!
---
Also, what about aligned mods? You are talking about the aligned barrel? One of the wiki's I used that seems to data mine its info does not show any AP cost change on barrels.
---
Oof you went to the northern ones, that's a rough journey
---
I'm sure you will see what you can do.
---
As netrezen said, a lever action works great. Or you can bring a backup semi-auto rifle that’ll still benefit from your rifleman build but have a much higher RoF-  handmade rifle, combat rifle, radium rifle are all fairly solid semi-auto weapons.
---
Yeah I thought so. Always found it amusing that it's Winchester as I've always associated the name with old school arms like lever-action rifles. 
---
Don't shoot me lol but I personally prefer Bethesda's take on Fallout over Interplays but of the things I dislike is the generic gun naming. I guess it's to avoid licensing fees or something when using irl weapons but for the in-universe ones like 4s Assault Rifle I think having a model name instead would deepen the lore, because half of them don't seem to have much background info.
---
20lbs of unstable gunpowder. Not to shame the OP but no one thinks the mothman had anything to do with it.
---
I did read that exact thing on another post man, tried the armor bench and it's not there.
---
&gt;Personally, I had never heard of the Snallygaster or the Wendigo
---
Honestly never heard of the Snallygaster, but Wendigos are a huge folklore thing, however, I don't think they have anything to do with West Virginia so odd they would put them in.
---
Security to whom and how? I am honestly interested in how? And how does every other game in the world avoid these pitfalls?
---
People were raging about PTT and it was fixed in the first week.
---
Doesn’t work in PA afaik
---
Yea i found 300 grenades and have been looking for something fun
---
Xb1
---
Mothman in game doesn't look like mothman I know of, but I still like him. Most of them are extremely well known. Mothman is well known across the world.
---
Ew PA
---
Sorry im on xbox1 ty though
---
I spent like 1k on mine, 3 years ago, still runs 2 clients fine.
---
I completely forgot about the stimpak diffuser plan. That's something else I need!
---
do collision course up by Morgantown airport, 100 pwm per event
---
My testing showed that Aligned Barrels/Grips have the lowest AP cost for their mod slot.
---
I too was an adventurer like you, trying to prove to the world that pistols are viable. I was content when I could take down a Scorchbeast with one clip from a 10mm pistol.
---
had no reason to suicide until he met OP
---
Ew someone who doesn’t actually read the post.
---
This makes me sad 😔 I hope it gets resolved soon for you! Also, goes without saying but just like 'making sure it is plugged in' - Gunsmith level 5. (Bringing this up solely because of going from melee to guns). Best of luck Guy, that really - really sucks 😣
---
Yes, Excavator in the Ash Heap, T51 (BOS) in the Cranberry Bog and Mire, Raider in Savage Divide, T45 in Toxic Valley and parts of the Forest. Sadly there cant be Enclave ones because that goes against the lore, MODUS kills them all in the Bunker before the Scorchbeast spread enough of the Scorched plague to get them.
---
He's like someone out of the Nemesis System in the shadow of mordor series
---
One change I dislike about Bethesda versions of the games is it used to be stated that thanks to the huge hands of a super Mutant, they couldn't even properly hold small guns like rifles, they required the larger heavy duty weapons like mini guns, missile launchers, flamethrowers and this heavy plasma rifle! [which counted under energy weapons stat not heavy weapons], otherwise they'd just break them! Now super Mutants mostly just weild piddly little hunting rifles and assault rifles which couldn't possibly fit their fingers into the trigger!
---
He outran the competition during tryouts.
---
He's really really tough. He's blown up more humans than any other super mutant suicider.
---
But Healing Factor is fantastic. You don't have to heal after fights. And regen is rather quick.
---
There's crossbows, but I don't think there are regular bows
---
just some short feedback as I looked your build up; Bullet Shield is pretty useless imo, get Travelling Pharmercy or Blocker instead. You may want atleast 3 points in Perception so you can atleast equip all 3 of the Lockpick perks. You also should remove Healing Hands, as many run a Bloodied build and that could destroy it when you revive 'em.
---
The problem is that Bethesda's system works in discrete actions.  You can't be in the middle of one action and take a Stimpack because that is a separate action.  The previous one has to finish playing out first.  It's the same reason why you can't interrupt sitting in chairs, laying in beds, or drinking toxic water, except here, it's presumably being leveraged as some kind of game mechanic to prevent spamming.
---
Personally, I agree that it makes things feel needlessly janky.  And part of the issue is that, in melee, the timing for how the game processes subsequent attacks is really fidgety.  I'll almost always get a second swing I don't want before I use the Stimpack I do, just because of the weird timing window.
---
Yeah that are
---
If you shut the robots down immediately after initializing the event, they will get a small dose of healing between waves of enemies. 
---
However they also chase the enemies. 
---
It's still much easier having the bots shut off.
---
I will definitely have to look into that.
---
True. Greets from xXDemolisher
---
Don't know if it was just luck, but twice I've fast traveled there (just to scavenge) and the event started as i arrived
---
I'm for the joy of building and thought they would have taken some of the ideas from the modding community to futrther improve the base building foundation.  Kudos to them making the moveable camp system, but I think that walls should fit, alot of the red spaces should be green, and limitations/restrictions should be reduced to allow "fun", basics like stairs and some semblance of gravity should apply.
---
Thanks to this thread I've learned about the Marines eating crayons meme and now I want a crayon skin for the Marine armor.
---
I would ideally like the bear arm plan too, I'm not a melee person but I do like collecting as many plans as possible. I thought I may have at least seen someone selling stimpack diffusers in there vending machines but so far I have had no luck, so completing the event and getting the plan seems to be the only way forward to complete that badge, this is why I'm hoping they fix it next patch so I can get that badge!
---
I actually messaged all the high levels on the server twice now. I'm kind of shocked how many people did not know there was a new event. Seriously a handful of people had no idea what it was. 
---
Last night we managed to get a decent group together just via messaging but its hit or miss who is willing to join.
---
Pat yourself on the back o virtuous one!!
---
Dupers???? I thought that game was f*in secured!!!
---
Lol if you think that is correct.
---
That website shows Gatling plasma doing energy and ballistic damage. It does not, only energy.
---
That website shows stabilized working on Gatling plasma. It does not work on any energy weapon.
---
You are saying the Gatling gun destroys everything in DPS? are you high? It has high per-shot damage, but fires very slow. It’s DPS is far lower than a 50cal or Gatling plasma. 
---
Technically, as another poster pointed out, the LMG has the highest DPS. But it’s such a pain to keep loaded, I save it for special occasions.
---
I have no mods installed. I had a reshade mod installed back in november but deleted it because I didn't like the way it looked.  Just to make sure I fully uninstalled both FO76 and the Bethesda launcher deleted the file locations and fully reinstalled after I restarted my computer and still does it even with new characters
---
Yeah I've been wondering myself. They're vague about damage modifiers for sure.
---
Blame the toaster company and not the toast. You know.. Like a normal person
---
This sounds like a group with GTA syndrome. He either pissed them off deliberately or accidentally and made them encouraged to hunt him down, or somehow they figured out he’s young and they felt like being douchebags to the poor kid. Happens all the time in GTA.
---
I remember when I used to play GTA, some thirty-something guy kept following me around and shooting up all the stores I tried going into so I couldn’t use them. It really got on my nerves, he couldn’t even kill me yet because I was only like 17 he felt the need to torment me.
---
Oh please tell me this is a joke.
---
Yeah we have our exceptions down here too, one of my friends sounds like he should live up north but everyone in his family sound super hick
---
No need. We all should encourage such behavior.
---
Would you have rather it been *Stephen*? lol
---
Kotaku needs to proofread this shit. Worse grammar and punctuation then a grade school English report by a non native speaker. And they got paid to write this drivel? Disappointed I gave them the ad revenue from reading it.
---
Literally reads like they wrote it and clicked 'publish' without rereading or having an editor read it.
---
Is there any evidence that's even possible? It seems like the non-venison rooms don't respawn fast enough to get to rank 3.
---
The AP reduction is multiplicative not additive so there's a diminishing return on it. By my math you should be getting 69.7% reduction with the mods listed for the combat rifle.
---
because they are running the game on such an unstable engine it is easy to exploit. you see glitches all the time you dont intend on, but here they are every day. until they release an separate system i feel like duping is doomed to stay with us.
---
Anti-materiel rifle.  Need a natively .50 chambered one instead of a hunting rifle conversion
---
You didnt know him back in college man...
---
Essentially, Longer barrels increase AP cost and shorter barrels decrease AP cost.
---
And among the different types of mods, AP scales as follows:
---
Aligned &lt; True &lt; Stablized
---
I didn't do more testing after that, as I had no interest the regular versions of the mods and Bash damage mods just increase durability. I run Unyielding, so I can stay in VATS for days now.
---
This is pretty much it right here, folks. If you are talking about equivalent weapons, either non-legendary or with the same legendary effects, this is the order.
---
But as he alludes to, the LMG is hard to keep fed on ammo, so most HW users use a 50cal for easier ammo management.
---
&gt;It was 7. To help put that into perspective, jumping costs 10.
---
Pretty necessary to use VATS if you're running a pistol build.
---
Those japanese they sure do love to surprise people
---
You haven't answered the question.
---
Gamebryo is a lightweight suite of modular libraries that let developers switch pieces at will. Creation Engine is a fork that's getting updated with ever new release (certain issues in Skyrim aren't present in Fallout 4, and with Fallout 76 the engine was upgraded again), so of course it'll share some code. New advancements upon an engine are built upon previous ones for most engines, because building a new engine from scratch is expensive, needs manpower, and takes time. That doesn't make them 'the same'.
---
I play on Xbox one. It seems as though the issue has returned; I've not been able to play for more than a half hour before being disconnected.
---
We desperately need for people who show up to events to know what the hell they're supposed to do. PP seems like a waste of time most of the time I show up and see everyone running around killing spawns but not collecting anything to load into the feeders.
---
I recently sent in a ticket just to make sure my claim was still active (I changed my account email) and they said it was still an open/ongoing ticket. So I know it's not dead at least. Like another user said, they were taking claims up until May of this year, so I don't expect to hear too much about it for a while yet.
---
What a cry baby tattle tale lmao.
---
I’m not high lol. I see what you are saying. The LMG is psychotic, an ammo hog, and impractical but oh my god is it fun.
---
Bondfan013 pretty much summed it up how I would have, I had heard of Wendigos though before. In West Virginia for the most part everyone knows the local folklore pretty well and Bethesda pretty much brought everyone to life. Mothman is portrayed slightly different in folklore but they still did a nice job with him
---
Ok thx
---
Born Survivor (and things like it, such as Auto-Stim armor), *really* suck if you're Bloodied because they are going to proc every single time you get hit while under the health threshold if their timer allows it.  You burn through Stimpacks like no tomorrow.
---
Serendipity is mandatory for more Bloodied builds, but from what I understand, it doesn't work in Power Armor.
---
Nope they were all random people. That's what amazed me. They were all also pretty crap at pvp as a few of them killed themselves trying. He's level 20ish so it's not even like they would get more than about 2 caps if they succeeded in engaging in pvp with him. It was only one or two that tried to get me. He had everyone go for him first though and especially at events it would be hard to tell that we are on a team. 
---
I could totally understand going for me as I'm nearly level 200 so there is more of a trade off but a level 90 attacking a level 20 isn't gonna get much other than wanted
---
It told me it was unlocked when i got it. Got a notif in the upper right hand corner of the screen saying ‘unlocked arktos pharma backpack plan’
---
I had a similar idea of trading in cards but for things like caps or a temporary buff (to do with the card that was traded in).  
---
Imagine an alien card collector :o
---
If you want details, any mmorpg that write in SQL (or any database) your character progression upon logout or upon stored procedures activation and meanwhile stores progression in RAM are doomed.
---
I bet there is still some extra  .ini file or change left over from the mod somewhere, like in a sub folder under your user account.
---
You just did the cringiest thing ever lol, puts pacifier in mouth.. Good lord. Tells me all i need to know about you. I'm not the one who needs to grow up. And I'm not defending cheaters. But trying to silence them? Too far.
---
*puts a pacifier in your mouth* grow up dude. Just making the game better.
---
Lol, she ate it all and now survives on Radroach, like the rest of us.
---
Indeed it is, there’s always away. This is exactly why I will steer clear until Bethesda says: “your clear,” or “we give up”
---

---
That seem better, I didn't know what to do with the spare point so used it in first aid.
---
Crit savvy is definitely the better pick, if you don't have points for both.
---
I've noticed this since Patch 9 as well - mostly in the form of hitching as I run around.
---
3 caps per sugar 2 per acid
---
As a support build you will need traveling pharmacy and through hiker for weight reduction, if you want dmg go for bloodied build yourself it's even easier to do with support character as you are not the front line when playing on the team, as well i will recommend power armour. I will make a build and post it here for you then if you have questions i will answer.
---
You could find one of the Aussies in this thread who plays on your system, friend them, and then join their server.
---
I think it is a combination of no server-wide notification and random rewards.  You are not guaranteed a three star Legendary upon killing the boss who is the highest level enemy in the game so far.  Why waste the bullets and stimpacks when you can farm Whitesprings or West-Tek?  Or even buy a specific item from other players?
---
Some of the other events suffer from the same problems.  Free Range has no notification.  The Scorchbeast Queen and Imposter Sheepsquatch can drop single star Legendary items.
---
Yeah i get you. Who is really doing the most exploiting here?
---
Something that helped me:  
---
Limit junk stats to 100, for everything except the 2~4 types you use constantly (depending on your ammo / repair needs).
---
That would be great, thanks.
---
Yes I can. Unless they are in pacifist and never claim a workshop. I'll just keep jumping in front of their bullets and contesting their workshops
---
Running a heavy weapon build and only level 31 on the character. I know you get a legendary Flamer after completing some quest and while its affect is trash, I still want it because I think it's an interesting weapon.
---
 Well the Mole Miner's missiles do fuck all, are yours better.
---
Yeah I'm fine with that. If people exploited the game and contributed towards ruining it at its worst, they don't deserve to play it at its best
---
They bothered to reach out and ask you questions but couldn't even be bothered to proofread their pile of deathclaw dung? This article is riddled with grammar and punctuation errors. Throwing stones from a glass house, and such
---
Regardless of who. We collectively need to step away or steer clear is all.
---
I edited. I meant that on my build the Gatling Plasma is surpassed by my LMG.
---
Yeah, I’ve noticed it’s incredibly dead as well. I keep considering trying to run it but half the time the people who show up either dont know what theyre doing and start the event way too early and we get our ass kicked, or they’re too low level to be helpful. It makes trying to actually complete the event a serious pain in the ass- Id like the plans for the new meds and the bear arm, but until they add some sort of LFG thing I think I’m not going to bother.
---
The extra icing on the top is the “death blossoms” has the same bug, but they haven’t fixed it cause nobody cares about that dumb mission.   But the feed the people that everyone liked and gave emergent gameplay, they killed that shit right away. 
---
All it needed was a pop-up dialog box, “&lt;playername&gt; has fed the people, enjoy the stew!”
---
But going on evidence, the only thing more expensive to Bethesda then bug-fixes is dialog boxes, so I guess that’s why we got this.
---
Ok mr technical Im sure you knew what was meant
---
Thanks. I am actually only using Gunsmith at 2 in order to make room for other perks, but I don't think it would be much of an issue if LotD worked the way its supposed to. By the way, what platform are you on? Might be significant.
---
I want to do dmg what meant low hp build, in this case healing after the fight is useless and I'm selling stims to vendors every day.
---
Got mine too.
---
I met a Japanese friend on 76 and since I know NO Japanese I used google translate to communicate and we had a blast! I know not knowing Japanese might seem like a boundary but we have to try and learn a little on the way.
---
Thats lame considering how difficult the process is.
---
You would be a better person if you destroyed their crops or camp defenses.

I am sure your very proud of yourself . Are you 12?
---
Meanwhile, I will continue buying high-end gear at the lowest prices I can.
---
I agree, what I’m saying is even those, like myself, who had any hand in it all should help them get on the right track for the best.
---
Lay a 2nd foundation under the stairs then remove it.
---
Camden park located near Charleston in real life actually almost sold out of clothing apparel shortly after the first trailer of the game dropped it was pretty crazy. Tourism has gone up a little bit since the games release and it’s a great thing to chat to people with because people will ask and say they seen such and such on fallout and it’s nice to give them or tell them about the real life version.

My big question is how can things have value when duping has been happening since Day 1? I've seen a guy with vending machine full of Fasnacht masks. He had 4 of those clown ones and 8 of the owl one.
---
😁
---
Ahhh that makes sense.

 You are wandering into strange territory. What has that to do with missile damage? It is Explosive damage and easily mitigated..
---
It would be pretty cool if the Scorched fungus actually merged into the power armor itself, so it isn’t just a scorched in power armor, but that the power armor has become visibly fused to the scorched wearing it.

I have found one, but only one this way. Ive gotten two more from metal containers

Your apology letter met the required levels of ass kissing. Consider your ban lifted.

I love the way you put it and I might have to revisit to get a feel for what you said. I loved the environmental sounds in 4, the wind blowing through the dead trees, the creaking and groaning of metal near metallic structures, the way it felt reminded me of windy days where I live but without people and it was magical.

No one I personally knows believes in Mothman but my grandparents told me of when they first started the folklore the paranoia that swept through the state. When the bridge at Point Pleasant collapse in 1967 and killed over 40 people, others in the state were scared for a little while that the mothman was real. Everyone and a while you’ll hear some new iteration of the monsters in the folklore but for the most part everyone keeps the original folklore

&gt; Of the weapons I tested, the 10mm Pistol seemed to be the absolute cheapest. One of the wiki’s, which seems to rip most of its info right from the game files, lists the 10mm pistol as having a cost of 24 AP per shot. My tests revealed only 21 AP per shot. Obviously one of us is wrong.
---
The wiki's wrong. The 10mm pistol costs 20 AP per shot in the game files. Most of your results come out exactly one point above the data, although the LMG and Minigun are a lot higher for some reason.
---
&gt; I do want to end with one final thought about how AP reduction stacks. I simply do not know. My Combat Rifle uses an automatic receiver (-50% AP cost), a red dot sight (-15%?), a quick eject magazine (-5%?), and the legendary prefix (-25%). That totals out to approximately -95% AP costs. My actual AP cost per shot is about -75% of base (down to 7 from 26). Clearly, these bonuses are not additive.  
---
Given how they're implemented, they should all be multiplicative, so the total would be 0.5\*0.85\*0.95\*0.75 = 0.30, or a 70% reduction. Your magazine &amp; reflex values are correct. Beyond that it's down to rounding, and that's certainly an ugly business for damage calculations.
---
If anything I should be knocked back, not stand there like a fucking idiot for 5 seconds
---
Nice, which town you from? I wish more people from West Virginia played the game lol
---
Wait, how are you guys having a dot for a crosshair, exactly what I'm after mind you, yet my crosshair is a big 'ol dynamic cross which I despise..
---
  I play without mutations.
---
Collected but never consumed a bobble head or a magazine.  I’ve crafted foods etc that boost melee damage, but forget to eat them, so they end up spoiling.
---
Have access to the WS bunker, but have not yet launched a nuke.  Haven’t taken on the SBQ.   I do have solo takedowns of L80 SBs, a couple of regular and legendary Mireluck queens, and a good number of regular and legendary Sheepsquatchs.
---
Being mutation free works for me - Melee build, L92.
---
Does a bathrobe count as sleepwear? I'm happy to pose for pictures, but it's the only outfit I have.
---
So I've thought about this a bit. On paper, the LMG does approximately 17% more dps if you're only talking about 1 magazine with no reloads, but if we're talking about SBQ, which is where this really matters, you'd need to take into consideration reloads and sustained fire. The reload speed of the two weapons is suprisingly just about equal. I recorded the reload on both using standard weapons, and they both came out to just about .5 seconds. It was really too close to tell if one as faster than the other. So then we have the fire rates and mag sizes - 
---
19.88 fire rate for B25 LMG mag size of 75 and damage of 561 per shot before armor
---
11.38 fire rate for B25 .50 cal with mag size of 250 and damage of 731 per shot before armor.
---
I can go through 1,000 rounds for SBQ pretty easily (sometimes more) on the .50 cal, so let's set that amount of damage as the litmus test here. 1,000 rounds of .50 cal at 731 per shot = 731,000 total damage before armor. So the LMG needs to do at least that much (in reality it needs to do a little more since it has lower damage per shot, meaning it's less efficient pe shot due to how DR works, but we'll ignore that, giving it the benefit of doubt here). 731,000 / 561 damage per shot = 1,303 shots.
---
**So here are our stats for simulation:**
---
**.50 Cal** = 1,000 shots needed
---
**LMG** = 1,303 shots needed
---
At a **fire rate** of **19.88**, the **LMG** will go through it's full magazine of **75** in **3.77** seconds. 
---
At a **fire rate** of **11.38**, the **.50 cal** will go through it's full magazine of **250** in **21.68** seconds. 
---
Both have a reload time of about .5 seconds with Speed Demon. 
---
So how does this shake out? Well, let's do a timeline for each. We start both at full magazine and start firing.
---
**.50 Cal Machine Gun Timeline for 1,000 shots (731K damage):**
---
Fire 250(250) rounds +21.68 (21.68) -&gt; reload +.5 (22.18) -&gt; Fire 250(500) rounds + 21.68 (44.86) -&gt; reload +.5 (44.36) -&gt; Fire 250 (750) rounds + 21.68 -&gt; reload +.5 (44.86) -&gt; Fire 250(1,000) rounds + 21.68 (66.51) = **66.51 seconds** to reach our goal of 1,000 shots fired on .50 cal.
---
**Light Machine Gun Timeline for 1,303 shots (731K damage):**
---
Fire 75(75) rounds 3.77 (3.77) -&gt; reload +.5 (4.27) -&gt; Fire 75(150) rounds +3.77 (8.04) -&gt; Fire 75(225) rounds +3.77 (11.81) -&gt; reload +.5 (12.31) -&gt; Fire 75(300) rounds +3.77 (16.08) -&gt; realod +.5 (16.58) -&gt; Fire 75(375) rounds +3.77 (20.35) -&gt; Reload +.5 (20.85) -&gt; Fire 75(450) Rounds + 3.77 (24.62) -&gt; Reload +.5 (25.12) -&gt; Fire 75(525) Rounds +3.77 (28.89) -&gt; Reload +.5 (29.39) -&gt; Fire 75(600) Rounds +3.77 (33.16) -&gt; Reload +.5 (33.66) -&gt; Fire 75(675) Rounds +3.77 (37.43) -&gt; Reload +.5 (37.93) -&gt; Fire 75(750) Rounds +3.77 (41.7) -&gt; Reload +.5 (42.2) -&gt; Fire 75(825) Rounds +3.77 (45.97) -&gt; Reload .5 (46.47) -&gt; Fire 75(900) Rounds +3.77 (50.24) -&gt; Reload +.5 (50.74) -&gt; Fire 75(975) Rounds +3.77 (54.51) -&gt; Reload +.5 (55.01) -&gt; Fire 75(1050) Rounds +3.77 (58.78) -&gt; Reload +.5 (59.28) -&gt; Fire 75(1125) Rounds +3.77 (63.05) -&gt; Reload +.5 (63.55) -&gt; Fire 75(1200) Rounds +3.77 (67.32) -&gt; Reload +.5 (67.82) -&gt; Fire 75(1275) Rounds +3.77 (71.59) -&gt; Reload +.5 (72.09) -&gt; Fire 28(1303) Rounds +1.40 (73.49) = **73.49 seconds** to fire the required 1,303 LMG rounds to do similar damage to the .50 cal's 1,000 rounds.
---
Time to deal our target (731K) Damage:
---
.50 Cal = 66.51 seconds
---
LMG = 73.49 seconds.
---
The .**50 cal** come out about **10% faster**, but it's honestly pretty damn close. In a real firing scenario, with the chaos of battle, they probably come out to be about even. Also consider that it would probably take slightly more shots than that to make the LMG = the .50 cals damage, because less damage per shot = less efficient vs. high armor, though it probably isn't too big of a factor since both are doing more than double the SBQ's effective armor - thus why I didn't include it.
---
**Conclusion:**  They're about equal, with a slight edge given to the .50 cal the longer the fight goes on. .50 Cal is also vastly cheaper to fire.
---
I have low confidence in the numbers given for sights and magazines. All I can say for certain is it costs me 7 AP per shot from a base of 26 on the Combat Rifle. I am being told that barrels can effect AP costs too. I need to confirm that now.
---
Sounds good. I appreciate the help. \^u\^
---
No sadly not:( I’d really like to though it’s on my future plans for sure
---
Wendigos aren't just heavily symbolic of cannabalism, but also starvation.  A common part of the wendigo myth is that they're always hungry and can never satisfy their hunger.  Some tellings even say they increase proportionally in size when they eat, offering a reason as to why they're always starving.
---
TLDR; Wendigos are the embodiment of those stories about pioneers/travellers getting trapped in the wilderness, running out of supplies, and eventually resorting to cannibalism in order to avoid starving to death.
---
theres this giant screaming goatsquamch. its been terrorizing innocent folks what only want to take photos and die for each others sins.

Thank you for the clarification

PVP is broken with that. VATS'd a guy yesterday, hit him twice with my superfast combat knife and he jumped in the air. I have Speed Demon and Marsupial and in VATS I stuck to him like glue but the hit chance went from 99% to 0% as soon as he left the ground. He wasn't in VATS and one-shot me with a super-sledge. Super dumb.
---
I run around with 30 something perception luck agility so my guy is pretty good in vats with no vats perks already so I might swap out crit savvy idk
---
PvP is cancer in FO76.

shes condescending,but i think shes funny.  If i had to pick anyone to kill, it would probably be The Overseer.  Her voice is so annoying, I wanna go back in time before the bombs, and kill her before she has the chance to make the holotapes.
---
Agreed. Get an irradiated gamma gun and make it full auto. Bloodied guy gets dead. Better if it has crippling and fire rate.

Could the port a diner function as a refrigerator so we could also sell food we've prepared and not have it expire so quick? If so, I'm all over that idea.
---
Most suggestions on this sub are stupid, either because they simply are or because the effort needed to make it happen is just too high.
---
This one would require quite a bit of effort, but I think maybe it might be worth it. The Scorched are a thing that repurposes existing stuff, it would be awesome to see Scorched using more sophisticated equipment, it would add quite a bit of flavor to fighting them beyond their level. Someone else recently said Scorched should be fitted to their area in terms of clothing, this is basically in the same vein, and I'm for it.
---
The first content season, Wild Appalachia, ended last week so read that material
---
Well, you put up the rather silly argument that the damage we do with a weapon directly relates to how much an enemy does with it, despite how inconsistent that is. A level 68 scorched with an assault rifle will deal far less damage per shot than a level 68 super mutant with an assault rifle even though they are using the same weapon. The same thing applies to mole miners, they are just a weak mob and their damage with rockets says absolutely nothing about what a player can do with them. And like I already said, the impact damage that's listed in the pip boy appears to not be explosive, so your dense and fireproof won't do anything against a direct hit. Which is what a targeting scope will do
---
AP cost is tied to weapon weight. Just fyi

Because those who steer clear of said epidemic, maintain the economy.

I was soft banned at the same time as everyone else during the huge ban wave, then I was unbanned at the same time as everyone else during the accidental huge unban wave, then when everyone got rebanned the next day I didnt. I guess they didnt reban the innocent Accounts. So I disagree that we should have been console banned because then I wouldnt be enjoying the game right now.

I don't mind if people want to pvp but do it on the pvp servers. To me some high level picking on a low level or someone just out of the vault is doing nothing more than showing how crap they are at the game or just trying to be a bully in my eyes.

 Missile damage is explosive. Not Ballistic.
---
Semis are easier to control/keep on target.
---
 Unless you can be disciplined enough with your trigger finger to do 3-4 shot bursts, then let go of the trigger, reacquire target, burst, repeat process.
---
Except that there were innocent people who DID get unbanned so the console ban would have been a bad idea.
---
I agree with you wholeheartedly that WV needs to become a tourist state. My dad, Brother, and my grandpas were all coal miners and even they will tell you that it’s a business we need to get out of because it just ain’t never coming back how it used to be. My County is where most of the coal in the state comes from and we’re slowly trying to diversify our economy to include tourism and coal mining and it’s honestly showing success and The best part is that they can coexist with one another.
---
If you were soft banned by console as well, they could lift that ban all the same. It would prevent the wrong doers from making alts as easy.. would have been a major weeding factor.
---
Thanks man it means a lot!
---
I mean its not spawn trapping people just see how people jump in survival do the challenges then leave so why nit have some fun waiting for people to come thru its free stimpack man the games does say its wrong plus if you knew you can holster you're weapon and you'd be fine they cajt vats or kill you if its holstered

Wow. I'm having trouble with connectivity today, how embarassing. D:

As a long time survival player all I can say is just fucking die. Show your son it's ok to lose. Don't quit cause it's too hard.

I get killed multiple times everyday. It's part of the game. My Aid tab is mostly minimal at this point.

Learn the mechanics of who can see you and how. How the red dots on the compass work.  It's all about time in the game. And accepting death as inevitable.

And in Round Three, "Steve the Mirelurk King" defeats ["Deathclaw Steve" by TKO?](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bv4tmk/update_on_pet_deathclaw_steve_its_dead/)

( but srsly, /u/deata sorry to hear your Steve didn't make it T\_T )
---
Yeah that looks pretty dumb imo, like how dinky a lot of weapons look in power armor. From what I've heard the reason pistols look massive is because they had to scale them up to fit power armor and Super Mutants.

Really? That’s...the weirdest coding ever....

Obviously some perks can be changed, i was trying to pick most useful stuff for team based support character without compromising ability to do dmg. For weapons you want cryolator (any) and Gatling gun (bloodied) plus 2 handed melee (bloodied or instigating) when farming solo. 2 sets of pa excavator for looting and t51b for real fights.

And if you want to scan Ram in a process memory space, you have to buy twice as powerful computers. And seing how FAST are our servers...that won’t happen.

Been having wierd lag spikes from time to time today as well. xD
---
Aligned barrels and stocks (plus the "forceful" stock, and "sharpshooter's" and "comfort" grips) generally do have a 5% AP reduction. I think the other common mods that affect AP cost are already listed here, although I might make a table later.
---
I’m kinda disappointed Huntington isn’t in the game I was really hoping it would be but I can’t complain too much since they put my beautiful Welch in the game lol
---
I disagree. The real problem dupers, I mean the ones who dupe the absolute most, sell their items on gameflip and Ebay for real money. If you console banned them then all it would take is 4 weapon sales worth to buy them a new console.

It doesn't suck. Your just new to the experience. You've already learned to wait forever he map data to load.

Allowing PvP attracts the worse kind of players - this game never needed PvP in a single iota for it to be successful.  In any case Bethesda needs to give us a no PvP game mode not this pathetic hybrid that just enables the degenerates.

I hear ya

I rarely use VATS in this game so this isn’t an issue for me

Upgrade your Vault 76 jumpsuit to shielded.
---
Wouldn't that mean that 90% weight reduction would make any weapon VATS compliant? I'll run some tests later.
---
How about your health do you have any diseases or anything that is negatively affecting you.
---
The responders have numbers. While they don’t have the tech or gear.  As we see in other fallout times military fights against armed civies doesn’t go well for either side but one dead solider is two civies armed. 
---
To add the responders have food, in 76 it seems the BoS don’t as they constantly are strong arming them for stuff.
---
Do you know of a website which lists all AP values? Or are you gathering these all yourself? A more accurate, more complete list would do wonders for the community.
---
As for the minigun tests. The delayed spin up needed must have scewed results. Keeping Vats activated slowly drains your AP. I dropped all but one bullet to ensure I did not shoot multiple times, though.
---
Most of the "innocent" people who got banned were the ones who went out of their way to find dupers and take their stuff off the ground. I know many of them ended up dropping it, but it was still not their business to go around looting it. The dupers will always have ways of getting more, all that did was slow them down a bit and in return they helped contribute to even more duping and more instability while also marking themselves as obtaining large quantities of illegitimate items. Imagine if the police caught you with a sack of cash stolen from a bank and you tried justifying it by saying you stole it from the robbers
---
Land of Maple Syrup, come at me Bethesda Austin. Face me and my Moose Army.
---
Yes, it does!

Well done. Looking forward to more posts like this one (y)
---
Hrm. I guess I got to whip out the ol' Lan cable. I'll be a bit.
---
In my server hopping last night, that one was always a regular camera, not the quest camera....
---
Awesome research, thank you for putting this together! I've been planning a VATS character and I was considering the combat rifle over the handmade since I knew it had lower AP costs. This helps a bunch.
---
A few other notes:
---
* The assault rifle does have better accuracy than a combat rifle. It also has a higher fire rate and a super fast reload animation so it kind of makes sense. I still think the AP cost could be a bit lower though.
---
* You're correct about the railway rifle and Concentrated Fire. Any weapon that fires an actual projectile (as opposed to hit scan) does not benefit from the perk. So it's useless on things like the harpoon and crossbow as well. I don't know if it's a bug or just an engine limitation but it's pretty dumb either way.
---
* Fix the fucking radium rifle Bethesda! It makes no god damn sense that the mods are so incredibly difficult to learn for this gun. It feels like it should fall somewhere in between the combat rifle and handmade in terms of effectiveness but the difficulty of the mods means 90% of players are completely locked out of using it other than the base version. If they want to keep the mods as difficult as they are they need to buff the base damage to make it worthwhile to learn. If they want to keep it as it is, they need to make the mods much easier or significantly reduce the cost to craft them.
---
Sorry if that last part was a little off topic. It's just frustrating when you craft ten rifles at a cost of 150 screws and don't learn a single mod. But thanks again for the work on this!
---
Yep. They're just zombie raiders and nothing more.   
---
A lot could be done with them, but I doubt any more will be done.  
---
I mean. Fort Defiance should have been filled with high level scorched in power armor and brotherhood outfits. Instead every time I go there I have to kill a bunch of ghouls that got inside. Because apparently the Brotherhood of Steel can't be expected to clear out all the ghouls from the building that they are using as their headquarters.
---
No disease, everything calculates out fine when I'm bloodied butvas soon as health comes up the negative effects come out of line.  I dont get it nothing I have should create a 20 point swing on any special
---
Missiles deal damage in two phases. The damage you see in your pip boy is the direct impact, and is not explosive. The explosive explosion damage is higher than that. Want to go test it? Take a missile launcher without any perks and shoot it directly under your feet. See how much damage it does
---
This is going to be one of the biggest problems as the game gets older, less active population playerbase, and most of all the terrible limits of 24 ppl to a server. It isn't like an mmo with hundreds on your shard at a time or with LFG systems to queue up with others across all servers that are doing a dungeon or event or quest or w/e.  
---
While it is great that they might want to design some events that are geared to endgame ppl and with some difficulty and requiring a large group of ppl to finish it optimally... with only 24 ppl max on a map, it's not really a great design focus imho. With the limits, unless we get some sort of cross-server queue system for big instanced events or something, then I think events should be more geared to 2-4 ppl max to carry and like fasnacht festival.
---
I don't blame you. I've spent entirely too much time testing various game mechanics by browsing the game files and in-game testing. I'm usually happy if I can get an in-game result within a 5-10% margin of error based on known or assumed forumlas. 
---
I really wish Bethesda would provide some documentation on these "advanced" mechanics or, at the very least, provide absolute numbers for things like mod effects. I understand that you have to balance the amount of information you bombard a player with but  if feels like informing the end user is an after thought way too often in this game.
---
Robots are not players - Pacifist only prevents it from aggroing other players.  Personally there’s just too many cons to having these mutations or using Tesla coils in PA.
---
Not sure that was a tamed pet. I tested the other day to see if players could still kill pets by having a guy not on my team light my bear up with a TSE gatling plasma.... no damage.
---
You have completed the ultimate quest

Wait they can't kill you unless your weapon is out?? I thought  survival was a pvp free for all zone and you can kill at will.
---
Lol I have like 10 of the owl ones.  It wasn’t rare.

On Xbox.  I have the same problem.  Tried it probably 3 times last week - always empty.
---
Oh I meant referring to killing as dispatching. A very businesslike way of referring to it.
---
Let's try some math, using test 3.  
---
Pibe bolt action has a base damage of 70. Hardened Reciever raises this to 87. Assumption: the sum is used as base damage. Could be wrong?  
---
The only damage boosting perk on my test page was Bloody Mess, 15%.  
---
87 x 1,15 = 100.05 (game displays 100)  
---
I tested using three differnet crit modifier totals:  
---
Crit + eagle eyes = +125%. Damage: 2.25 x 100.05 = 212,61  
---
Crit + eagle eyes + better crits = +165%. Damage: 2,65 x 100,05 = 265,13  
---
Crit + eagle eyes + overdrive = +180% and 15% dmg bonus. Damage: 2,8 * 100,05 * 1,15 = 322,16  
---
Those are pre-armor values. Now run them through the armor formula, with a 150 DR target.
---
DamageCoeff = Min(0.99,(PaperDamage/DamageResist)^0.366 ×0.5)  
---
Dmg | Resist | %resist | Dmg to hp | tested dmg

So uh ... either I'm fat fingering something, or one of the assumptions is off. Or the formula from FO4 hasn't been copied directly to FO76. Either way, the perk and the chem works, and my brain is too tired to go back and redo the calc without hardened reciever e.g. :)
---
I wasn’t aware RTS profited that much, thanks for that insight
---
South of Twin Lakes, follow the river, Hes alway there. I kill him everyday.
---
 I can put 40mm into the ground at my feet with 5 Explosive slotted and suffer no damage. As its listed as Explosive damage for both missiles and grenades that's how it is. 
---
 You are the only person I have ever heard claim missile damage is ballistic.
---
She is annoying
---
Take your time. :D
---
Medic builds are good for support. Low dps and general priority with the effect. I’m running a medic build with a broadsider and assault rifle. While I don’t do anything the plan is to provide covering fire and heal up the team with needed. 
---
Not every build has to be the star child.
---
Circuitry?
---
Cherry Hill, Morgantown high school.
---
Oh yeah, that changes things. My char has crit savvy + 15 luck. That's just exactly enough to go need 2 hits to recharge a crit. Can you do it in 1 hit with 30 luck?
---
Well that IS how the game works, yea. Everything spawned in gets a timer attached to it, and portions of the world also are unloaded when not active (no players in the world "cell"). Which is why you can, for instance since it's the best place to experience it, start to roam around Watgoa and right as you get up to a Bot to punch it's lights out... it collapses. Or when you get near the Bot Spawn Tube and the door opens, only for a ragdolled robot to fall out. 
---
That's because they spawned in prior, the area was unloaded to save resources, and during that period their timer expired. You roll in, area is loaded back in, timers check... purged mobs. 
---
This keeps the spawns "fresh" for players of different levels, so that a lvl 20 doesn't roll in to an area a lvl 170 had been which spawned lvl 68 *whatevers.* It's annoying for sure, particularly since they don't *respawn* right away, so you've gone to the area looking for a fight and there isn't anything to fight...   
---
But then also is annoying, assuming your notion is correct (which I'd say is likely), by it killing pets inadvertently :\\
---
Why isn't this stuff available in the game? I've always known that there are hidden modifiers to VATS costs, but it's not something I was ever willing to explore. You've given everyone who uses VATS alot to think about. For example, I use a Lever-Action with VATS, but that's because it costs less per bullet to kill stuff, even if it kills it slower. In sneak I can usually one shot any Ghoul or Scorched, and a few more put down a Super Mutant. However, if it's THAT much more efficient to use something else, I may just do that. At least it will give me something to work towards in terms of damage besides random legendary rolls.
---
Or how about if I spawn at my fully functional camp and then server hope it stops loading with half my turrets and food destroyed. How is that even possible? The building wasn't even there to get attacked by anything. Also - three times yesterday had a message saying my camp couldn't be placed. Last time just to see, I stayed on the world, went right to the map, lo and behold literally no camps no one even near my camp.
---
At this point it seems like you're just intentionally being difficult. Here's a simple version
---
Missile hits you - ballistic
---
Missile explodes - explosive
---
Where is cherry hill?
---
Seriously? That seems a bit silly. I'll try it though.
---
I have noticed this too.  When I am on my main, people leave me alone.  But when I play my lower level alts the bullies crawl out of their parents’ basement.
---
He has dense and fireproof luv 3
---
Just went through my inbox some days later ... 70 base damage rifle, 87 with Hardened Reciever, then bloody mess on top. No other perks with damage bonus.
---
TIL 14,000 km = 7 km
---
Was this in the Mire?  Cause there’s a spot where a dog lives and it’s a natural spawn.  So next time he loads in or someone fast travels there it’ll spawn again.
---
FWIW, I found one in a locker at Wavy Willards
---
the best and brightest probs speak more than one language
---
This data basically disproves that theory. The results match the game data files where each weapon has a specific AP cost and certain mods change that value, regardless of weight. I'm not sure if the weapon weight theory came from a previous Fallout or it was always a guess.
---
Haha whoops I’ll fix it
---
You hit the nail on the head. This problem will only get worse as time goes on and they add more and more endgame content. There needs to be some sort of cross server grouping system. I can only imagine what it's going to be like in a year or 2 trying to get the encrypted event done.
---
I thought the same thing. I tried it on my chem dealer build as they use laser weapons so any form of repair is good. And burst firing seems to proc it more often.
---
Learn all the radium rifle mods.
---
As a dad who plays with his son regularly, that was very Noble of you. 😎
---
Sometimes if I have an addiction or withdrawals it does affect me.
---
Not just his lower neck. It has eyes covering its entire body I just didn’t have time to draw them
---
That’s why I quoted it, doesn’t really work when the role players don’t speak multiple languages. Also lore wise, they probably would’ve only known English and possibly Chinese in case of an invasion
---
I guess I'll drag a ghoul to the pool
---
Lmao game has been out for 6 months
---
Nope they needed it for spawn trapping
---
I wouldn't be able to live with a wire glitching through my wall.
---
That's certainly one of many options.
---
Yeah I think the coolest part is the obvious Resemblance to human body parts. Like if you look at the back legs they look exactly like a humans legs.
---
If they are completely unrelated it's an awful big coincidence. Two cannibal groups associated with the exact same name? 
---
The only way I could rationalize this is that a member of the WV Raider gang had been to the Gourmand in Las Vegas pre-war, like the name and used it on his post-war gang. However, the cannibal connection is still a coincidence unless the restaurant was cannibalistic pre-war. That's seems unlikely to me
---
Voi kuinka surullista :(
---
\+1 to Damage Resistance, and most certainly +1 to Charisma.  I know for a fact that Im' more confident and charismatic with clothes on.
---
Without clothes, ehhh, not so much.
---
80 caps for a bowl of noodles? You gotta be kidding me!
---
People need to start using foundations first.  Wire management is nice but all the floating monstrosities without proper foundations are a terrible eyesore.
---
I dont bother going to it even when I do happe. to see it because of the 9 times that ive attempted to join the event i have crashed to desktop 8 times.  Its just too buggy for me.
---
I just checked Google... You're right lmao. Oh well now it literally feels like I played it years ago!!
---
Exactly people are quick to jump to conclusions and bash on a player when its them that aren't alert get better or don't go in or be prepared to die
---
Yea by Harper, but it was at his camp on top of a mountain. At the edge of his camp in the back
---
He was really bad as a suicider, but excellent at surviving nuclear explosions.
---
Yep, that’s the spot.  You are washed of your sins my son.
---
Just like the real brotherhood
---
I keep shooting her to put her out if her misery.
---
eat it
---
Given the fact that T-60 was used just before the bombs fell, it's possible a few sets are laying about lore-wise just not widely used.
---
Weird it didn't give me the prompt to revive you. It kept saying "go"
---
Self-gathered, mostly with FO76Edit. It's easy to miss stuff because I'm essentially looking up each value individually by scrolling through a giant pile of poorly-sorted garbage. Someone with more experience in fallout modding would probably know how to dump values programmatically.
---
Now that you've proven that these values are actually used though, I may grind through the data.
---
The VATS drain probably explains the +1 point results for the other weapons too.
---
In PA? Emergency Protocol on torso. Really comes in handy when mobs pound on you during WS or SBQ.
---
 You do you. I have suffered no damage from any missiles since I set up for Explosives. 
---
 The Damage is listed as _Explosive_ and I can not find anything indicating any Ballistic Damage at all. You are the only person that has ever claimed Ballistic Damage for a missile, that I am aware of. 
---
 I can stand on a fucking car and blow it up. Walk away with almost no damage at all.
---
What armor you wearing?
---
I agree. For giggles I tested a heavy weapon with and without Bear Arms perk (-90% weight). AP cost stayed the same.
---
Lol. In fallout 3 they were good guys.
---
This. I also don't get it why the used it at Fasnacht and Encryptet, also at scorched earth but not at Arktos... Makes no sense since all are server wide depending on a bunch of players.
---
Guess suicide doesn't keep you in a down state...
---
Executioners gamma gun fully modded does the job nicely, it splits damage across all 3 resistances and with automatic mod it demolishes bloodied builds fast.
---
I play it like I play fallout 4. If you didn't like playing that, you won't like this.
---
How about against other people
---
Lol didn't meant to say that I have a flying monstrosity. Most of my camps are built at ground level. I'm currently using around 6 foundation pieces for my house and everything that's going to float even a little bit is going to get some kind of support.
---
No not even with crit savvy 3, perception mentats, full unyielding and a shielded raider underarmour. It's always 2. I'll have to try later on a faster crit fill weapon if I have one
---
Ive got some copper for sale (cheap) in my machine, and IIRC, am carrying ore so I can smelt more.  
---
I’ll be on later this afternoon, break until midnight, then be on most of the night.
---
PS4, aj ninetyeight,  camp is on a power line tower just S of Monongah
---
Dunno. Never tried PvP
---
Oh my bad , typo, Cherry Grove
---
I actually loved FO4, I find 76 isn't that entertaining when it comes to NPCs.
---
At the Red Rocket mega stop, scorched wear red rocket jumpsuits I read of the green ones
---
While there Morgantown Airport also.
---
I hope so, I stock around 70-100 legendary items usually and it’s a pain exiting and reentering the machine to list the next item every time
---
Thank you wasteland jesus
---
Since I can't hit the broad side of a barn with my pitiful shooting skills, I LIVE on VATS.  
---
And I had no idea about any of this.  
---
Heck, I didn't know that you could change the VATS cost of things!  
---
I'm all in for this data and anything else on the topic people can post. Like... which mods lower AP cost? I have a 10MM pistol that I rely on, but my mian gun's been a hunting rifle (and I'm level 130!) ... and I have no clue how to figure out where to go from there. Combat Rifle sounds good from the chart here, but how can I make it more VATS friendly?
---
Probably on lvl 2 that player wasn’t so sure about junk whereabouts and how to deal with it.
---
): Maybe if I fall from a high enough area...
---
You’re welcome my child.  Make good choices and kill dogs no more and you will be rewarded with 1* wood armor for the rest of your days.
---
He dropped the nuke the first time around
---
Apparently, at least it used to be you want (not neccessarly *need*, but I dunno): at least 4 Charisma *(don't know if chems/armor counts?)*, and either "Animal Friend" or "Wasteland Whisperer" charisma-perks at Rank 3 *(and equipped, of course)*, and your Level must be *at least 2x* that of the creature. *(ie: lvl 60 Deathclaw, you'll need to be lvl 120!)*
---
On top of that, the creature needs to be a "random spawn", which means it is spawned in one of many specific locations where **anything** can spawn. In other words, it can't be a guaranteed spawn point like Deathclaw Island, or something spawned for a quest/event. 
---
Then... *and this is just in my experience*... you need a gun that does **not** have a scope (reflex is OK), and "aim" at it --not just point crosshairs, but actually look down the sights (right-click on PC)-- and then the option shows up. **However;** by default these perks are to "pacify" creatures, as in make them temporarily friendly (not attack, or stop attacking), and that is not what you want. So as OP said, you now have to be **right next to it**, still while aiming, in order to get the "Tame" option.
---
As I wasn't aware of that last part, I've never gotten the "Tame" option... but now that I know I'm about to go see if I can get something, and I can report back.  
---
For the record, my lvl is 166 and I have a base Charisma of 6 which is boosted to at least 9 with my armor, which will make it easier since I'm 2x the level of what almost everything can spawn at.
---
That's why I wear my enclave uniform proudly
---
Tinknered with it a little, this seem alright?

Even it's static -  killed a cute dog. The RNGods will remember...

This is truth, many many powerless angry people in real life turn to video games for their power fix.
---
Fudge that. Most Japanese know English as a second language to my understanding. So odds are they DO speak it and they DO understand you on some lvl. 
---
Plus there culture isn’t very conflict heavy, so I don’t think there going to bother talking to you if they think there English is bad.
---
Interesting enough, the semi auto Combat and Assault rifles have their respective damage and fire rates swapped. Only when fully automatic does fire rate become the same (75).
---
This is fake news. I've had both these mutation for months and have had them go off with and without pacifist enabled on WS bots. Never aggro'd them ONE time. 
---
You likely hit one with your weapon without realizing it.
---
XB1 here - I've always saw the two working in unison - one makes guns break 50% slower and the other repairs them intermittently. I'd love to see the health of it on screen to see exactly how close it gets to breaking before it repairs. That's a massive missing data point in that equation.
---
Hard to be alert when literally the first thing you hear is the sound of an explosive weapon firing you. The screen wasn't even fully loaded yet. I'm only clever 56 and most people I come across are way higher than me. They could on shot me easily. My build is pretty messed up to since my son has chosen alot at level ups. It'll take awhile to get it straight
---
I'm only talking about jumping 10 feet in the air, raining down explosive rounds...
---
Dog food isn’t on anyone’s menu but as for Pork n beans yes. Pork n beans are quite popular around here
---
I had a ghoul do one of their lunge attacks on me while standing near a cliff.
---
As he lunged I stepped aside and he went flying.
---
I wish I’d thought to grab the clip but I was too busy laughing at what had just happened.
---
This is very interesting to hear, as I kind of do both all of the time.
---
it shoud be instance to make it good
---
And my game froze. WHY YOU HURT ME SO, Fo76!? T\^T
---
Anywho. This is my plan: I'm going to willy's park and I'm going to jump off of the water slide into a shallow part  of the pool. Hopefully this will work, and we get two badge tasks signed off.
---
Just explore then. There's plenty of things to find. If you find a tape play it. There's not a lot of difference between playing a tape and looking at an npc talking. At least you can move around while the tapes playing.
---
Yeah okay, as if “Australia” really exists. Nice try.
---
If that doesn't work, we can just get the normal revive. \^u\^
---
My working theory is that successful Vats activation costs 1 AP. I will test this much later today by firing off two shots in VATS.
---
Thank you! &lt;3
---
Worked for today's 'photo of a player wearing sleepwear in a workshop' challenge.
---
Frank horrigan 2: electric boogaloo
---
&gt;The rewards aren't as good as they should be.
---
That's the long and the short of it. The backpack skin is super meh, the diffuser schematic is also pretty meh, and the bear arms weapon is not particularly sizzling either. Given the amount of work and how easy it is to fail the event, rewards need to be much better than they currently are.
---
Compare that to Free Range, which is easily soloable and rewards decent stuff for the challenge, and Encryptid, which is also pretty quick and easy and tends to drop at least something sellable each time, and Campfire Tales, which awards a currency you can use to buy stuff and therefore allows you to work towards specific items, and it becomes very clear why Project Paradise is falling flat despite the event itself actually being pretty fun.
---
Bottom line: if you want people to do certain activities, you HAVE to offer adequate rewards.
---
Yep it will work a bit less dmg but that's ok with support build, alcohol was there because it's basically free, stims you only want to use diluted version (in pa you can spam them easily and there is no animation for that what i really like). With full hp build you can make great use of junkies legendary effect, 5 addictions for +50% dmg.
---
I don't think the overseer was that annoying to be honest just the side quest is
---
Like I said in the main post, automatic receivers will cut a Combat rifle AP cost in half from 26 to 13. You can then throw on something like a red dot sight to further low cost. I do not know exactly how AP reduction stacks. I suspect it is multiplicative, not additive.
---
Just nuke the spq area you’ll find plenty deathclaw. I must have killed like 20-30 deathclaw this weekAlso search savage divide.
---
Have you ever seen a weapons fight? Thats exactly what happens when people get hit. Please pistol whip a friend with a downwards motion since thats the only way enemies do it and see if they go flying. Also in fp, your sight scrambles around, so you dont stand around per se. Things that should knock you back, do. Big uglies like Grafton monster, deathclaw etc.
---
Don't Care.  If he is \*\*\* ... it's an easy kill for loot.
---
Me and my.son got attacked when he created a new character.
---
I asked the lvl 285 why he was picking on a lvl 100 and lvl 2.
---
His answer?
---
He thought I was a duper and using the low level as a mule character and wanted to make it difficult for me to do whatever I was trying to do to break the game.
---
Eventually realized we were a father, son duo and left.
---
So, maybe they were vigilantes trying to be aggressive towards dupers and mule characters? Just my experience.
---
If you were around the vault then there is a good chance that was just a person who sells caps o line for a company so I say good on ya!
---
Her threats are annoying and the quests too
---
How much of a difference does Ultra light give to your ap? I haven’t ever tried but always think to try and see if it’s a big difference
---
Brotherhood in Appalachia’s territory is small, isolated, trying to beef numbers with anyone they can find, hungry, and mostly focused on the scorch threat.
---
If they attack responders, which the public loves, they cut off recruits, food, and a potentially needed ally whilst also gaining a secondary enemy in the face of a larger threat. 
---
That’s just bad tactics. 
---
If they’d eliminated he scorch, then fast forward a few years and I don’t think they’d have thought twice of rolling over the responders.
---
I'll have more probably be able to tinker with it too, feel it out as I go. Thanks for your help... Just need a team to heal now!
---
Should mention, im not trying to come off as a dick. Stuns are stupid annoying, dont get me wrong but i understand why they are there
---
A paraplegic wife .
---
I have a stash full of masks ( not the good ones)no duping but a lot of server hopping 2-3 of us on a team hopping different servers till one of us found the event then the others would join rinse and repeat.
---
On Xbox at least banning people does very little since most people have multiple profiles each with mules loaded down w duped stuff. I was a huge trader and got hit back in February too but I’ve got an alt, not with duped stuff but just to play again. But I mean if you ban  somebody who had the exact same stuff on 5 other profiles your not really fixing the problem it’s just like a minor inconvenience. I do agree with you though that the “softbans” will probably never be undone purposely even if they didn’t do much to help the whole “Epidmemic” but I mean come on I got the same email you did that it would be unbanned in a later patch and it’s been almost 4 months. If any other game softbanned someone for tat long they would’ve already created a fix and unbanned those accounts Bethesda support either doesn’t care or doesn’t know how to fix it.
---
I have Twisted Muscles for 300. I've also got Adrenal Reaction, Grounded, Marsupial, Scaly Skin, and Speed Demon if you need any of them. GT is the same as my reddit name. I'm currently holding the tourist, so you'll have to join my world.
---
Hides don't spawn in meatbags just meat and hands. I've found 4 so far 2 in green footlockers 1 on a gulper and 1 in a dumpster.
---
\*sigh\* guess that will do for now.
---
You'll need the water one for a later badge, but at least this gets you further into the quest.
---
Have fun! if you need any more help, let me know :D
---
It's rare to see pa in PvP, but it can be viable with emergency protocols I think. It's tough though because you're steps are so loud you are constantly revealing your location.
---
Roger that. I appreciate the assistance friend! :D
---
That would be cool
---
300 caps?
---
The European servers are a good mix of languages, I spent several sessions googling what the French/German/Italian for "over here" and "present" was before we had the gift icon available. 
---
Noobs were jumpy when you start shooting the ground near them.
---
Yup.
---
Dunno about that as we were doing events and the same thing was happening. I think they are basically just griefers to be fair. 
---
Sorry to hear that though. Again sounds like he was just trying his luck and being a bully.
---
It's how the mutant cycle works I guess
---
how many do you have
---
What were some of the more commonly duped items not counting TSE or bobble heads just curious.
---
Yeah, I can't test it until later but it does seem strange. My buzz blade procs and repairs all the time even though I'm holding the button. Also, if it's based on trigger pull does that mean you can just fire into the open and it will proc? Maybe it's based on pull + hit?
---
You have to then go to your build mode and place it in your camp. That's what completes the challenge. Hope this helps!
---
Without marsupial I’d have quit the first month.
---
If you want to be rewarded for doing nothing, you should probably try mobile games.
---
As a raider
---
Just trying to have a good time man...let’s fight but chill after haha
---
As a radium fan I completely agree.
---
Done.
---
Okay yeah that makes much more sense what does it take to craft? Because all I'll have to do is get the crafting materials.
---
2500 is to little but it for 300,000,000
---
I've got 14 twisted muscles right now, and 6-10 of the others I listed.
---
Shows up rarely in mute spawns. 
---
I’ve hit two taking over bogtown over the last six months.
---
I want a “let’s go dupin!” emote
---
I encountered a lot of mutegens, and rare ammo surpluses and that what I targeted
---
Can I give this post a ‘go away’ emote?  No?  Thanks, Bugthesda
---
I did a lot of checking before and after. It usually repairs a pretty significant amount.
---
They definitely wrote them in as escaping to avoid completely handwaving trapper armor, and I do think it sorta works
---
If you go look on gameflip you can see things like AAE handmade going for 50 bucks and it will say 15 sold and sometimes more. People are selling full sets of godly armor for 100 to 300 bucks too and making a killing.
---
The Ghoul was trying to do tadpole quest where you have to milk a cow
---
So much misinformation 😳. Limb dmg increase your dmg if you hit legs or arms or whatever is considered to be some kind of those (I'm not sure if wings counts but raw guess will be that they do). Headshot doesn't count for this effect but for most enemies is a weak spot (what gives you around 50% bonus dmg by default).
---
That would work with the base-damage theory if the crit damage was calculated after Bloody Mess but before the Hardened Receiver or Overdrive damage bonuses. Bit of a stretch, although the receiver damage bonus is already known to have a weird timing.
---
My characters don't use Eagle Eyes so I may try some simpler tests.
---
10 violet flux, 30 adhesive, 30 fiberglass and 30 aluminum for both

This is all part of the reason soft bans won’t be lifted, ever. They can ban MAC addresses from their servers which in all is basically a console ban in itself.
---
Quartermaster Teagan: If only these people knew what we did for them...

Then torso is a limb interesting

What a shame.

I'm going to assume your playing on console?

Just seem to notice console player base seems...way more toxic.

I'd imagine that Marine Helmet from the dev room that I see popping up in a lot of vendors for as low as 50 caps.  I've never seen it spawn naturally and people don't even charge as much for it as asylum uniforms.  Definitely sketch.
---
I'm glad someone posted this so it's not just me.  
---
Paradise...sigh.  Last few attempts it's obvious people have read some of the guides here which say to deactivate the event right away.  But then they ignore all but 1 habitat which sees that friendly try to fight the alpha and there goes 20 minutes down the drain.  
---
I've gone to Arktos a few times and waited 20+ minutes to start the experiment.  If no one else is there by 5 minutes, I leave.
---
As stated by others...the effort/risk vs. reward system is messed up and it is a game wide problem.  Last night I hit the 'why am I doing this scout quest again' spot.  To get badges!...For...what again exactly?  Paradise I'd like the diffuser plan, backpack skin, and bear arm plan and mods.  But if the event isn't up what to do and if I'm only chasing those rewards to be a completionist...
---
I will say Encryptid still gets people in my experience.  I've taken to activating it with my highest level character and holding all 3 pylons.  If someone grabs 1-2 on their own and saves me the trouble, I call it bonus.   But when the sheepsquatch drops a 1\*?  When my level 250+ char is rolling with 1\* weapons because I've never really landed anything truly 'good'. 
---
I'm not going to keep chasing a carrot if the carrot is rotten.

&gt;did he survive his own suicide
---
Let’s be fair, this would be a pretty fucking good reason for him to be legendary.
---
I was banned and was totally innocent. I did get unbanned though. As for the scenario you presented I'm sure a lawyer could make the case that you found the sack in a dumpster in an alley or something and were afraid to say anything because you thought it would be dangerous if the wrong people found out that you had mo ed the money. Game rules and IRL laws arent even comparable in the slightest.

Right

Hey what platform you play on. I wanted to see your camp in person.

---
Enemies in m could use an overhaul. Scorched a bit more so than others. Beth has already set up somewhat of a what could be a good system. The scorched have titles attached to their name, and those scorched shouldn't be as mindless as the lesser ranked. Basically they have just enough mental capacity to seek out better weapons and gear. They would be better equipped, much more lethal, and harder to kill.
---
Same with ghouls, theres a ghoul overhaul mod for FO4 which adds half-ferals. Feral enough to attack on site but still smart enough to wear armor and use weapons. Could be a great addition to this game.

Deathclaws need some work, like making them one of the most fierce and deadly creatures to walk the wasteland again. They're hide should be highly resistant to damage and they should be faster than we are and much stronger. One deathclaw should caution even a full team of players at any level. A pack should cause players to even consider fighting. Side note, their hide should be lootable from their dead bodies as well. 
---
Insects are squishy but pestering so I'd say their alright. 
---
Super Mutants also pretty good as they are, maybe could use a buff in their DR. 
---
Cryptids are squishy and generally underwhelming as enemies. I could classify them the same as insects honestly. And they're supposed to be fearsome creatures of the wasteland. 
---
Robots are generally on par.

You misspelled "blatant misguided witchhunters".

But they're all been like this

Ya, I figured he was just a griefer. Just sharing the excuse that 1 threw at me, lol.
---
So I've thought about this a bit. On paper, the LMG does approximately 17% more dps if you're only talking about 1 magazine with no reloads, but if we're talking about SBQ, which is where this really matters, you'd need to take into consideration reloads and sustained fire. The reload speed of the two weapons is suprisingly just about equal. I recorded the reload on both using standard weapons, and they both came out to just about .5 seconds with speed demon active. It was really too close to tell if one as faster than the other. So then we have the fire rates and mag sizes -
---
19.88 fire rate for B25 LMG mag size of 75 and damage of 561 per shot before armor. 439.34 after armor.
---
11.38 fire rate for B25 .50 cal with mag size of 250 and damage of 731 per shot before armor. 630.71 after armor.
---
I can go through 1,000 rounds for SBQ pretty easily (sometimes more) on my b25.50 cal, so let's set that amount of damage as the litmus test here. A prime B25.50 Cal will do 630.71 damage per shot against the SBQ (this is after her armor of 300, and after our armor penetration which brings her down to 165 armor). 1,000 rounds \* 630.71 = 630,710.
---
The prime LMG does 439.34 damage per shot in the same scenario. To do 630,710 damage, the prime LMG would require about 1,435 shots (630,710 / 439.34).
---
**LMG** = 1,435 shots needed
---
At a **fire rate** of **19.88**, the **LMG** will go through it's full magazine of **75** in **3.77** seconds.
---
At a **fire rate** of **11.38**, the **.50 cal** will go through it's full magazine of **250** in **21.96** seconds.
---
Both have a reload time of about .5 seconds with Speed Demon.
---
**.50 Cal Machine Gun Timeline for 1,000 shots (630,710 damage):**

Fire 250(250) rounds +21.96 (21.96) +reload +.5 (22.46)

---
Fire 75(1425) rounds +3.77 (80.63) +reload .5 (81.13) 
---
Fire 10(1435) rounds +.5 (81.13) = **81.13 seconds to reach our goal of 1435 shots with LMG.**
---
So yes, even after reloads and armor taken into account (and that last reload is a bit BS since we only fired 10 shots of it) the LMG is better dps, by about 10%.
---
**Would really appreciate someone checking my math.**
---
**Conclusion**: I'm actually a little surprised that the much smaller magazine and amount of reloads didn't create a much bigger gap here, in favor of the .50 Cal. I'm even more surprised that the LMG came out ahead in a sustained fire simulation.
---
Ain't no way in hell I'm farming .308 or ultracite .308 ammo though. I can make 234 ultracite .50 cal rounds per craft on average. ultracite .308 is just painful to make.
---
It’s 5 AP per mod, but as a sneaky sniper with 1 strength, it’s about having less weight to carry, AND being more stealthy (armor weight affects stealth), AND having more AP.
---
Ahh. Didn't realize that. Thanks for the info.
---
Doesn't that technically make NZ disputed territory? Even if neither country is really pushing the dispute?
---
The (-) near special stat means that you have some negative effects affecting this stat, not that your special have negative value. With marsupial you get -4, so if you have 9 without mutation, then it should show (-)5, just like you mentioned. My guess is that you base AGI is 12, so without perk it should be (-)8 and (-)11 with it.

Now if they could just fix the possum badge stuff that requires pictures then Id be happy. I have so many pictures of vertibots that are apparently not good enough for the photographer possum badge.

Exactly, theres no swinging or anything, just gets old after awhile, but they tend to fix things frequently so fingers crossed they can fix the bugs with the bugs... Ha.

Other thing I guess is it's half term here where i am at the moment so I guess it is possible there are a lot more kids on but still it isn't something I've seen before and I'm nearly level 200

I’m sorry. I must be mistaken then.  I hope you didn’t waste a bunch of time on it.

Maybe he's planning to go out legendarily, with a legendary suicide?

Be sure to do it in a low-level area and maintain your swarm by spawning bloatflies from your bloatflies.  I think they only follow you a certain distance, though.

Where is that? You had way more lick then other people

I haven't been able to get into it without crashing so I never go to it

That's what I thought. But some posts here made me doubt it and keep searching.

Does scrapper effect it?

That song right there is the reason why I made a youtube playlist of the songs from Fallout 3, 4, New Vegas, and 76 that I actually like. Pipboy radio stays off and I run my playlist in the background.
---
Unfortunately minguns are pretty weak compared to the 50 Cal and LMG but I'll make a barely half-educated guess at 2-3k. The fast RoF can chain crits pretty good I imagine so there may be a team player who runs a medic focussed build who'd be interested.

Russian ones too

I always worry when I do my Lucky Hole Mine run and server hop for Acid 200-400 and collect my couple thousand steel I will get banned for the ammo I craft it's easy to craft 15000-20000 5mm so I don't go over 25000 5mm or 10000 5.56 for fear of being banned.

That’s actually pretty cool how the game accidentally encourages you to learn new words

Did they want to talk to you about the annexation or what?
---
Can you get the stimpak diffuser/bear arm/super stim plans with only 1 creature alive? I reliably get 40+ toxic sludge alone so unless the Snallygaster decides to rush to the boss(happened 1 time and the Grafton Monster 1 shot it lol) it's a pretty easy event but I have only gotten formula P and lab coats so far.
---
tbh I would rather do the event alone instead of having leeches just upscaling the Alpha Boss health, most of the time people just crouch there sneaking and not collecting anything.
---
Chaotic neutral.
---
That was a different branch of the brotherhood. They diverged because they didn't completely agree with HQ
---
Yeah encryptid seems to be the same. I got a notification about it after joining a server, I fast travel there to check. There are 4 minutes left, the ISS is at full hp, and there's NOBODY there. Not even the player who started the event.
---
You are top. Thanks!
---
They were the better brotherhood

The internet youtube hate machine moved onto the next game to tear down for clicks, views, and money ad revenue.

MOTHERFUCKER. that is the kind of bullshit that would result on several layers of fucking punji spikes and redundant rings of turrets. what's your handle so i can block you

This is what it looks like when you try to run it on one.

We were giving them this feedback before the beta even started. They said there would be separate servers but gave no time frame and it doesn’t seem to be a priority for them.
---
Fallout logic!
---
disregard...still. FOR SHAME!!
---
Just tested, that's actually what makes it even. Without scrapper it's 1/1/1, With Scrapper it's 1/1/2. 
---
The other concern is that it's technically free exp.
---
I think legendary means they run away so well that most people have only heard their legend and haven't actually seen them.
---
Your reaction to pvp is super wierd. Why would he alert you first? It's not pistols at dawn, he puts himself at a huge disadvantage by not using suprise tactics.
---
Why you couldn't have said 'because some people enjoy pvp' instead of 'because they arnt good enough to fight head on' is beyond me.
---
You go to a workshop in an open pvp mode with a challenge that all players can participate in and seem surprised there's conflict there. Also why quit repeatedly, good job showing your kid how fragile your enjoyment of something can be and how easy it is to basically spoil your own experience.
---
I did in fact only met 1helpful player till now. Im only level 10 but they all try to shoot me or giving warning shots when im coming to close. The only helpful one was a dude who didnt shoot me just did a quest and left.
---
Yes that should do
---
not true. Post change I have tamed a deathclaw, a snallygaster and a mirelurk king. you need both 3 point perk cards, maxed and used and at least 6 charisma. you need more charisma for mirelurk king I think (I had like 10 I think) and I had to be almost on top of him to aim to tame and got no pacify option on him at all. I never needed to be that close with any other tame. I definitely needed both perk cards maxed 3 each to tame my snallygaster.
---
I tamed deathclaws with only 3 points charisma plus one of the 3 point maxed perk cards before the change.  (for the record I tamed a cat, multiple megasloths, deathclaws, radtoads and a doe prior to the change also)
---
I think they just fixed it that if you wanted harder tames you needed both 3 point perk cards. none of them have been over lvl 21 until my mirelurk king, he is level 30.
---
I already have 60+ broken cameras, I'd hand them out for free if there was any way of doing it. I have all the quest posters at my camp, I sell rare syringer barrels/uniforms/etc in my vending machines, I keep around a farm with all the required plants to brew alcohol...it would be nice to also be able to help people with pesky RNG dependent quests
---
Maybe 🤷 I'm pretty sure I didnt, though, cuz the Mr Gutsy's nametag never showed up on the HUD
---
Further testing - I have 26 intelligence so that may be affecting it (unyielding set on)
---
Crafting level 1 leather right arm costs 1 cloth, 1 leather, 2 steel.
---
Scrapping level 1 leather right arm yields 1 cloth, 1 leather, 3 steel.
---
You're literally just gaining 1 steel per scrap, and 3 free steel every super duper proc, along with free exp.
---
I have the posters too and I had them showing what each quest gives the player if they do that quest line. We need to give the others the stuff they need but I feel that we can't sell stuff that easily. This is becoming a bummer.
---
From the moment she came over the radio.... I've spite nuked her before.
---
They can’t VATS you if your weapon isn’t out, and when you spawn in you have a brief period where you can’t take or do damage. You can absolutely be killed after that though. 
---
Your mistake was spawning into the world in a spot that’s particularly important at the moment.   Everybody is taking that workshop for the challenge, so it’s highly likely to have people at it. That initial world load takes much longer than when you fast travel, so you became vulnerable before you could really do anything about it. 
---
In Survival mode everyone assumes that everyone they encounter will kill them on sight—because it’s usually true. Can’t really blame excavator guy for taking you out, he likely assumed you’d kill him as soon as you could.
---
Brb getting a VPN
---
That sucks. You should team up with the dude I met. I'm sure you'll be able to help each other. He actually was quite a good player. He had been taking down Deathclaws to level up and I took him to a few places with level 40ish enemies and he held his own without me needing to intervene much
---
I was wondering why half of the players I met were speaking Japanese. I even ended up trading with one of them before vendors were in the game and it was strange and funny to do over the mic.
---
Interesting. Never seen that except when there was a driver issue or a settings issue with the video card. Ctrl-Alt-Del should bring up a popup and the last option in the list is task manager and it should run from there. But if its not even running from the desktop there's other issues going on. Have you tried putting it on your taskbar? Also have you tried Alt-F4? That should kill the current window or application that's running in full screen.
---
I’m completely against PvP. I don’t even like it with the workshops. If there’s a workshop I want/need, I’d rather hop servers to one with it unclaimed than take it from someone. It takes so much to get one up and going, and I usually don’t claim them because of the risk unless I just desperately need something from it.
---
I found one in a metal box at robco, they are random but so far I've found three or so by just killing stuff and checking containers.
---
I renamed my Action Hero "Vin Diesel".  I really want a ridiculous explosive weapon to call "Michael Bay".
---
I bet it feels great when the power armor clamps down on the permanent sunburn and the green spiky bits
---
Waiting for display cases to come out.
---
You can add custom images to photo gallery on pc, so thats already very risky (offensive stuff) plus it would require everyone to download the image that youre displaying in order to see it, which would likely add a lot of lag. Also its been suggested like 100 times before. That being said if all that wasnt an issue it would be cool, yes.
---
Sorry I have scrapper on at all times and forgot that might effect it.
---
I'll miss the realism of that.  Gas masks don't last forever and repairing it for a few cloth is close to the equivalent of replacing filters.
---
Ouch
---
Did you ever get a fix to this? Just started in my game.
---
I mean, we ARE tryhards after all...
---
Taking an enemy by surprise is fine. This guy couldn't hold his own in a fight so he waited for the first sign of a player appearing and started shooting.No way anyone could survive that much less a lower level player. I've stayed away from survival because I know I'm no match for another pvp. I'll try later at when I get my level and build up. To spoil the experience would be die instantly because someone shot us in the back before we could even get spawned in all the way.
---
Well, the mirelurk king I tamed is a functional guard, but he can also die doing his job.  It sucks, but that's what I have to work with unless they buff tamed animals.  What I'm asking for here is the ability to pay atoms (earned or bought) for a decorative "living" creature, like a dog, a cat, a bird, or even a runt deathclaw or mirelurk, that won't fight, but can be repaired.  Hopefully people understand that I don't want something for nothing, because this is no different than a deathclaw rug, except that it walks around.
---
It gives you cloth and leather also. It's not much (1 per super duper) but that's still "duping" and needs a patch.
---
Yeah I found two kids that had their own brotherhood faction and they steal all the workshops and and call you the N-word
---
I wasn’t aware you could upload other pictures to it (I’m on console) and hadn’t seen it posted before.  But this is reddit.  Every suggestion gets posted hundreds of times and I’d like to think that influences what gets put into the game.
---
The workshop was claimed and I could only destroy the turrets when they opened up on me. If I shot from sneak thier health would drop to zero then jump back up. I think it's more to do with the change to camp damage they implemented to stop griefing.
---
I once had a three star spawn and I said out loud "What in the god damn?!?" 
---
I guess he's really well known for his suicides, maybe he cooks a mean mutant hound stew, honestly who cares I got a one star wood arm off of him so fuck him
---
Yeah on pc you can just open the file and put whatever in, im sure you can see how that could cause issues. If they could work around that and the likely massive lag issue it would be cool tho
---
At least the BoS won't blow up your house for "fun". Well, usually.
---
I don't do the big events anymore.
---
The rewards are simply not worth the effort.
---
I have killed the Scorchbeast Queen several times, and it still doesn't register for the Challenge (*along with Legendary Deathclaws and Super Mutant Behemoths*).
---
I haven't even bothered to *start* any Project Paradise missions because, from what I've read, I don't feel it's worth the time and resources.
---
I still see Legendaries disappear on me.  I'm not going to do a long ass mission and risk that or a junk legendary.
---
1. I think so
---
2.  Can’t upgrade class
---
3.  Don’t know
---
Thanks for doing the science
---
I got a 3 star pipe from the legendary vendor, it great explosive +30% damage to scorched.  Now I carry 5 weapons....    
---
Sniper 
---
Mutated handmade
---
Scorched explosive
---
Silenced mutant rifle
---
And an instigating sledge.
---
And sometimes my MIRV Fatman for giggles.
---
It's not duping that's the point of the perk card
---
Psh...PS are bro's
---
Maybe hes super clumsy and keeps tripping and dropping his nuke. It still goes off and hits his target, but he lives through with some radiation burns and scorch marks, and all the other Super Mutants think highly of him.
---
Happened to me as well but I believe the reason is that they are considered containers and thus follow the same rules as world containers, like a 20 hour cool down.
---
Scouts quest
---
Exactly this is my feeling. The hope is it's an alt account chocked full of junk.
---
Did you come up with this idea on your own? I've never seen it on here before!
---
This all makes so much sense now!  
---
I scored a BE Railway and put an auto receiver on it. I literally cannot hit shit without vats. But with vats...
---
It has become my new favorite weapon. I have recently started to run around squishy (no PA) and have 2 pieces of ap regen armor.  I can empty a 10 round clip into a sheepsquatch and vats will still be engaged while I reload, and I can get a crit every clip. So much fun.
---
Ok. Ty!
---
Im only getting 2 steel per scrap with unyeilding and scrapped
---
its garbage, that's why its dead.  crash trying to get in a lot of the time, hang if you do get in the other half.  imposter is garbage too, most of them are garbage.  like BGS.

The thing with PvP is that DR / ER doesn't really matter. Most people will pierce right through armor armor with perks / AA weapons. There's also some black magic fuckery that goes on with survival mode player damage that makes DR / ER just about worthless. The only thing that matters is getting a set of assassin / sent or assn/ cavalier for the most part, and stacking that with Lone Wanderer (20%) or Empath (25%), Dodgy (30%) with AP regen, Serendipity (45% chance to avoid damage), Blocker (45% vs melee) and maybe Med-X (20%).
---
yes
---
Maybe legendary mods kits would be better but still bought with scrip but costing much more than the random weapons from murmrgh . If we could choose what we got everyone would be running round with TSE and nothing else.
---
I might have to start hitting the player vendors hard because I've only been able to find Shadowed for legs.
---
I think I got spoiled by mods i  Fallout 4 that let you chance weapon class. Ah well!
---
Yeah, I'm hoping weight doesn't have too much of an impact at that level of Agility but I'd be VERY curious to find out before I start shelling out insane volumes of Caps for armor pieces.
---
I've had this happen. You can't take out or sell the duped holotapes. It's just a display glitch, essentially. Not sure what else that breaks, but I've also had the phantom weight and item limit happen in vending machines. If that happens, just Blueprint the vending machine (if you have decorations), store, then rebuild it.
---
Praise Atom
---
I just saw this old post lol would have love to help, we love taking photos lol
---
So gaining 20 leather, 20 cloth, 40 steel and a bunch of XP in a few minutes, from doing nothing isn't duping...?
---
Not having either of these weapons to hand, I'm curious how the damage per shot is so much higher for the 50cal. Don't they have nearly the same base damage (42 vs 43) at max level? The 50cal has the damage bonus from the heavy barrel mod, but that's only +12.5%.
---
Who the fuck sleeps in a bathrobe?!
---
Yeah. Sounds pretty BoS to me. Lol
---
it's not.
---
I try to think like a consumer.....what does the maximum value for my dollar mean?  I do a lot of grinding on 76 and the new legendary vendor has given me one or two good pieces after scripping possibly a hundred 3 star pieces.  How long did it take to collect those?  ages.  It's hellish frustrating to me.
---
Ask for a refund.

Me and my younger sister which is 9 and people say to young to play the game but she loves it sometimes we go out and scrap items and just roam around being stupid to each other in a kind way but I’m 120 and she only lvl 15 because she doesn’t play much and the poor girl gets destroyed by stalker killers which she made them by and some of them are to high even I can’t fight them off so I get targeted too I’m helping her level up even doing the DB and enclave quest line with me and my group of buddy only on some days 
---
Sometime she plays by herself and I sit beside her to point her in the right direction or fight off something she can’t  and once I heard this guy say such horrible things to her it made her cry my sister uses mic because she is a social butterfly and likes talking to people so I don’t like leaving her on her own but I don’t understand why like what’s the fun out of ruining something game time you don’t know what life is like for them games are an escape or a relaxing break for some
---
Repair per proc is based on the condition loss per hit, which is very low for automatic heavy guns. If it is repairing, you won't necessarily see much of a jump in the condition bar, especially not compared to a 2H melee weapon.
---
Interestingly,  I had a tse pump shotty, level 45 but after using it next to the level 35 Anti Armor Explosive shotty I much preferred the level 35 and sold the 45 TSE.  It was just more controllable and accurate.  I like the idea of selling us legendary kits too.  Anything to give us more control over what we get to use in game.  I mean, we spend a lot of time and the cost of the game is not especially cheap...and the console...etc.  I just think the new vendor has made the game even more grindy than before.
---
Are you lvl 50 up because you can just go kill one and if you don't have good guns or melee weapona then kill one with grenades and if you don't have grenades or can't craft a few then it's cheaper to buy them from people or vender bots. And if you below lvl 50 then just buying grenades to kill a death claw would be cheaper then spending a lot of caps on one hides unless you have alot of caps.
---
You don’t. It’s not in game yet
---
Decontamination showers should be too
---
So scrapping a right arm gives 3 steel and a left arm gives 2 steel
---
They didn’t want NPCs because it’s easier to not have them. You can role play a wastelander when NPCs exist
---
Invite randoms to group.  Flash Let's Nuke remote instead of sitting on Site Alpha and hoping your teammates catch the hint.  What's not to understand?
---
That was said in good humour mate! :-)
---
Level 22 and I have two. I also price them a little high for bragging rights lol
---
Didn't take long for racism to show up. :'(
---
Is this what we are, as native English speakers? Why are you reinforcing negative global stereotypes against both cultures?
---
Yea haha, it was a pretty piss poor excuse for not having them.
---
Well damn.
---
That's true!!
---
That would make sense. My assumption was that the turrets attacking me first would allow me to take them out, but the game probably doesnt read that as PvP
---
Heres my sneaky sniper build from another post about the same thing.

"Here is my stealth sniper build.

Weapons are Anti-Armor Handmade for close quarters and Instigating Lever Action for long distance.   
---
Armor setup five pieces of 2\* Chameleon w/ +1 Strength Heavy Combat Armor. Each piece is BOS w/ deep pocket except for the chest which is dense modded. Backpack has high capacity.  I'm around 301 carry weight capable. All makes up for low strength special so I can put it into other stuff that I can use more.
---
Mutations are Bird Bones, Carnivore, Eagle Eyes, Egg Head, Electrically Charged, Grounded, Healing Factor, Marsupial and Speed Demon"
---
Yeah this happen to me, I kept restarting my Fallout 76 until it worked out but if there is another way I haven't figured it out yet.
---
Recently I had just taken a workshop just so I could do the defend quests. A mid level 100s character shows up and tells me that lower level players tend to get picked on by higher levels. He then demanded I give him 60 caps or he'd take the workshop. I just walked away. O well I dont have the workshop anymore. I was done with it anyway.
---
Wish they did though. But we know soyny's entire backwards censorship happy puritan thinking.
---
Marathoner and Serendipity don't work in PA either, despite the perk card not saying so.
---
Lyons was weak, Arthur Maxson shall return the Brotherhood to glory!
---
Still there?
---
Yep. Asked the same thing and got attacked saying I want free stuff. Just saying. Watch out, lol.
---
Get your serum bought and become one of them! :-)
---
I don't think the outfit is that bad, and it was my error. It had crossed my mind, but I'm happy to work through challenges as the only things I want are skins for work benches at the mo
---
The problem is that the rewards are crap versus the amount of effort and weapon damage, I have been to the paradise event a few times now and as previously mentioned everyone sticks to one trough the drop from the alpha is then pretty crap, same with the cryptid event it is virtually the same drop everytime I go, at least for me, the amount of white wolf fedoras I have could fill a room.
---
The SBQ is also getting quite bad, it has happened a few times now where the SBQ after pouring thousands of rounds into her nearly breaking my weapon only for her to fly off into the distance never to be seen again or when she get's killed then drop"s through the floor, so for me it is not really worth the effort anymore and don't get me started on these bloody broken challenges.
---
Super mutants are of both genders and are sterile and don’t have sex. That could be a woman in your pic
---
Only had it do that to me once. After a restart I went through event viewer and found errors pointing at my video drivers. I uninstalled them and reinstalled them and haven't had that issue since.
---
This happened to me with technical data and I can confirm its just a visual glitch. You can't take the "duped" items from your stash. Also, they seem to disappear in the long run.
---
The current player base is active enough to justify it and they would look way worse if they left it to die. Bethesda isn’t exactly hurting financially that maintaining 76 is a detriment
---
The simple math of it is if .1% of players buy atoms, a player base of 100,000 will bring more money than a player base of 1,000. Making the game run well stops players from leaving from frustration. Fallout in particular has lost a lot of players to stability, many of which may come back if its fixed.
---
They probably thought the were in survival mode but I still hate when people do that and a few months ago when we still had slap damage a dude killed me and I did not engage but we still had slap then so he did damage. Something I do weird is the people who killed me I add as a friend them for no reason.
---
On the whole we like it.  Doesnt always capture the state well, and the geography they used make many heads hurt....
---
I'd still ask for a refund. I bought one of the pipboy skins and didn't like how it looked in game and they refunded me no questions asked.
---
So many players want it that Bethesda has to figure out how many beer kegs can be placed in a world before it crashes...lol
---
You know almost every player will be wanting these!
---
Given that you can get BOS paints for the T-60 in Fo76. I’m inclined to think that a few may have used T-60.
---
The 10 times I’ve done it the final bosses body disappeared before we could loot it. Or you go to loot it and there’s nothing there even tho we did hits on it. Safe to say, we don’t wanna waste our time on it anymore 😓.
---
I feel like if they put what we asked for in the Atom Shop they'd make a lot more money.
---
Well I've already crafted it. Pleased to hear though how approachable they are over refunds, but curious how I could start that conversation on Xbox
---
Heavy Leather Armor with Deep pocketed mod is pretty awesome! And yes all leather can be shadowed!
---
It needs an onscreen notification.
---
There's problems with enemies taking forever to load on my screen when I first port in, so I either stand still and miss a lot of trough feeding time, or charge in and often die to invisible mobs. This slow loading has been a problem with new content since Fasnacht.
---
Doesn't help that, because it's instanced, mousing over the event won't show the real number of players there. You might see one or two dots but there could be ten people there. I wonder if thinking not many players are present is making people think it's not worth going.
---
In my experience it's not worth making the friendlies aggressive. For example, the ghoul will full on ghoul sprint across the map into other biomes looking for trouble, often running into several enemies on the way.
---
Hidden in a blown up shop or mine.  Bethesda really should have them added.
---
Definitely did use copper in FO76 ... as someone else said, it was a recent change.  Many many many times I've been CAMP building and ran out of copper, preventing me from wiring anything else until I  went and got some more copper.
---
In fallout 1 the maxon there was pretty cool, the new maxon is just a bad person tbh
---
Are you doing left or right arm? left arm is just 2, right arm is 3.
---
It looks more Mad Max-like. I don’t want something pretty in Fallout
---
Yep realised that, thanks :)
---
Yes please! I would love for Raiders to be patched into (with some in Raider Power Armor!)
---
Difference in prime barrel perhaps? And keep in mind we're multiplying this many times over.
---
Heavy barrel standard level 45 .50 cal on my character = 152 damage
---
Standard level 50 LMG on my character = 184 damage
---
Prime Heavy barrel level 45 .50 Cal on my character = 133 damage
---
Prime LMG level 50 on my character = 165 damage
---
Bloodied prime heavy barrel level 45 .50 call equipped = 340 damage (no adrenaline, revenant, or psychotats)
---
I don't have a prime bloodied LMG on this character to equip and compare. I have one but it's in storage and I'm too lazy to get it out. I'm using the DPS numbers from the damage calculator here: https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html
---
You can see the head cripple effect applied to yourself occasionally. It's quite disorientating. Not sure what it does to NPCs though. Arm/leg cripple effects are more obvious.
---
Pretty sure that the limb damage bonus only increases limb-specific damage, not the damage to visible HP. You can see individual limb-HP bars in the pip-boy, and I think NPC damage works the same way.
---
Haha, I could go assassin's creed with my melee build... 🤔
---
And very nice.  A lot of call centers are moving in because of our "soothing voice"....
---
Weapon skins for the most popular weapons please! My handmade looks so shabby.
---
Kk
---
Am still in that quest and the stupid weapon that we have to use to kill a yao guai is still in my inventory taking room what was the point of it?
---
I’ve seen 4 players selling this for a low of 15,000 caps and it goes up from there... why????
---
It's not duping read the perk card I crafted 10 leather left arms and got 14 total with Super Duper just like the perk card states 30% chance to get double results what you do with the double results is up to you i use my double results for

Hol up, in Fallout 1, the Brotherhood was somewhat along the same lines of Fallout 3. Like one of the endings of Fallout 1 is one where they cooperate and share their tech with people. I mean yeah, the founding ideals of the brotherhood was kind of this mindset but not exactly. Also Fallout 3's brotherhood WAS the HQ. The West coast brotherhood was slowly being wiped out and purged by the NCR during the events of Fallout 3. 
---
Also if you're thinking of Fallout 4's brotherhood, Maxson basically reverted them to a very radical and strict ideology of preserving and controlling tech.
---
Ps4? I do that all the time. Its great to hear that squeal of joy on mic when the see it in the bag.
---
I’m not talking “pretty,” just.... less spastic. Lol
---
I don't even play Fallout 76, and I'm here to pay my respects. Hope Steve is in a better place, over that irradiated rainbow bridge.
---
Cya bud
---
No bows are not in hopefully they will will add them
---
Nope.  Charleston born and bred, and lived in Morgantown, Uler, and the Eastern Panhandle here.  Playing since beta.
---
Fully agree.
---
Most likely got his arse handed to him in survival now the only way they can PvP is in adventure mode doing this... weak sauce...
---
It's technically creating something from nothing in an infinite loop. You gain 1 steel and 3 exp, minimum, on each craft / scrap. And you can continue this forever. You can't scrap serums and get more mats back than you put in (can't scrap them period). Serums ARE good money makes but they require you to farm materials or trade for them.
---
Don’t let the door hit ya where Todd split ya.
---
Lmfao no one cares you're gone
---
I don’t like the gameplay loop of server hopping. Seems weird to me
---
I had already crafted mine, as well, otherwise I wouldn't have known how it looked in game. 
---
You can't submit support tickets for xbox? On PC you go to their support website and do it that way. I admit I have no idea why xbox accounts can't access the support system.
---
The thing here has nothing to do with killing Deathclaws.
---
It's about getting Deathclaw's hides wich oddly don't drop from the Deathclaw themselves, hence my petition to buy them.
---
I'm level 200+ and killed a ton of them, but sadly no matter if it's the lower lvl21 on deathclaw island or the lvl91 glowing ones, or even the rare alphas or matriarchs, they DON'T drop their hides :)
---
that really helps, ill just take an extra 6hrs out of my day to let a server clear out anytime id like to make ammo /s
---
I had the same issue... I just dropped my camera (doing so destroys it) and crafted a new one... Problem solved
---
They need to implement cross-platform.
---
are you on PC? can I have your good loot ?
---
Damn. Sounds like your playing a totally different game than me  i have a camp at whitesprings station and its easy to place my camp every log in. Lots of nukes. Sbq, whitesprings, morgan town and harpers ferry. Maybes its your point of view. I never complained about the bugs cause i got to play with my friends. In the end thats what the game is about. Hell, my group will just chill at my shop for hours just messing around. Interacting with the customers. I understand your frustration though. This game is far from great. But far from bad.
---
If vats is working properly then it's really fun. I'd jump towards an enemy and on the descent lock on in vats and you teleport a few feet next to them and slash or stab lol.
---
My mother is from Point Pleasant and grew up during the Mothman.  She knew most of the peoole who saw it and many who died when rhe Silver Bridge collaosed.
---
They missed a few cryptids though.  Skunk ape,  Pocahontas County Lizard that I know of off the top of my head.  Harpers Ferry is extremely haunted, couple banshees in various places also.
---
Then you're luckier than me, my count is at 2 atm. Let's hope devs decide to add the hides to deathclaws drop pools, wich would be the logic thing to do IMO.
---
I think between 2k-6k depending on mods would be acceptable. Just my opinion though.
---
Survival Mode should have made users create a new character and not allowed anything to transfer over OR go back and forth. 
---
Players having to go back to their safe place and camp in adventure mode to rebuild aren’t exactly surviving are they? 
---
If they started everyone out on the same level without any possible duplicated armor or weapons I guarantee it would have been better. But they didn’t so now there’s issues on both modes.
---
Explosive Radiums to increase the rads and stagger them before they can get you with the deathclaw gauntlet. 
---
VATS crit to the head also works, but I think the panic when the rads start increasing is a lot more satisfying.
---
Yes they will
---
Yup, this post makes the rounds so often yet for some reason Bethesda hasn't implanted a system yet.
---
Who?
---
Also the endemic corruption in business and politics.
---
Lack of infrastructure is also an issue.  Hard to do much if you can't get there.
---
I'm unsure that the picture is showing. Servers shut down for maintenance regularly.
---
When theres 4 or less players on a world it starts the shutdown warning
---
You heavily underestimate what the atom shop actually makes lol
---
happened to me too, sucks
---
Start by reading the wall image for the scouts in any station.
---
The game will guide you from there.
---
Okay well I'll need to get the violet flux before I do anything thank you for letting me know,
---
Looks like we gotta make two separate brotherhood's then 😔 Two different belief systems as the looks of it.
---
I can confirm junk nodes.  Got a Deathclaw Hide from the one by Watoga just yesterday.
---
Responders also probably had many veteran hunters in their ranks.  Hit and run/guerilla tactics are what the Responders would excel at.
---
He was a super mutant accountant and got tired of his desk job.
---
My PS4 copy actually came with a disc but I think I remember hearing PC copies come with a cardboard "disc" with a game code printed on it.
---
Because you are not close enough to realize that the mini nuke is actually shoved up his ass.
---
Please stay it's not that bad and honestly if you quit idk what I would do ^^^/s
---
Yes, and pets! Pets that can't be killed by level 1 moles.
---
The "unofficial" BoS factions with discords are actually pretty cool people =)
---
You hit it spot on
---
Read scout poster do 2 daily repeatable quests then do 3 tadpoles world challenges 5 hours later you get a backpack 
---
You want backpack high capacity mod do 25-30 camp adam fire tale stories events
---
To get 8 possum badges
---
Nice, thanks, I'll keep searching those.
---
I thought that. But couldn’t find any proof of the claim. I figured the hunters and trappers would have made it out to harpers ferry. Being free state land and all. That bunch seem like hunters and snipers.
---
I've had multiple occasions where I'm the only persoon on a world. So I'm pretty sure this is't the case.
---
Every time I do either encryptid or paradise inevitably I get stuck on a respawn and have to crash the game, so why bother.
---
No accurate or verifiable number exists in terms of launch copies sold and sales since launch. There is no platform Fallout 76 is on that allows any kind of tracking of concrete player count and Bethesda being privately traded, never releases profits or sales figures. Literally the best we have is that Fallout 76 is in the top 50 played games on Xbox
---
https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/store/most-played/games/xbox
---
It's quite frankly near impossible to actually say rather Fallout 76 has a growing player base and good supported store front. It does seem to have a good sized player base, given it matches and on some days even surpasses ESO's total player base on Xbox, but that doesn't say much about Ps4 or PC.
---
Tell me.  Did you get any Deathclaw Hides from spawning and killing all those Deathclaws?  Of course the answer is "no".  They're not in the Deathclaw drop table, so this suggestion falls flat on its face.
---
Right, the prime receiver for the LMG on that calculator appears to be bugged. Adding 10% rather than 25% for some reason. That does swing the true results much further towards the LMG, if anyone could handle the ammo costs.
---
Recently? I haven't had that in a couple months
---
Big issue is the BoS didnt really communicate about the Scorched threat.  It would have gone better if they told others about what was happening amd why thwy needwd resources.  It appears they either did not or could not tell the rest of the area or were so bad about it, that it never happwned until it was all too late.
---
It really depends on what mods are on it. Fully Calibrated with a Jetpack you could probably get 10K+
---
I agree.
---
I desperately want to run the event and am constantly checking the map to see if it is up and server hopping to look for it.
---
No one seems interested.
---
Not that the imposter sheepsquatch event gets much love either these days but it is still much more common to get in on that event than Project Paradise.
---
Would love to see a LFG channel or que system set up for this.
---
As a single character player 'perk tree permanence' would force me to start new characters and grind for months to achieve what I can do now with a hot key or manually selecting perk cards for my future campaign.
---
I may do that or call it a day and delete the game as being forced to massively change the way I manage the game would be quite irksome. Will have to wait and see what BGS develop in this area of the game.
---
I burned dozens of levels to re spec my special points once I had learned what I was doing and realized what a car wreck my early game choices had been. At least new characters will have that knowledge already in place. Currently my single character does everything i want except mule caps and gear.
---
Tesla rifle got me in trouble recently
---
Complete 3 tadpole badges, the scout leader will give u a backpack with +30 carry weight but you also get the crafting plan which you can use to make a lvl 50 with +60 carry weight
---
Had it a few Days ago... Great moment to take all the workshops and have the 'single-player' experience.
---
I usually carry a handmade and a combat rifle because both seem to work about equally well and that way I'm using two ammo types (one of which is weightless with perks). The drum on the handmade makes up for when it occasionally runs out of AP. With grim reapers sprint both stay in VATS for a long time and with four leaf clover they can chain criticals like mad. 
---
I also use an insitgating railway rifle but the lack of suppressor makes it difficult to stay in stealth (which I consider more important than AP use) and non compatibility with concentrated fire makes it a no-go for my VATS loadout. I use it in VATS only to land criticals on lone high HP enemies. I have it set up for semi auto use as a knock around weapon for my heavy guns/rifleman OGA loadout.
---
Oh sorry! I had one I could sell ya but I'm on PC
---
I just sold 5 nuke key cards yesterday, my camps all the way north in toxic valley. Complaining about rng is a little laughable, were all getting crap rolls on occasion.
---
We care.
---
Have a friend that runs a single account with 2 instances.
---
Just gotta launch the second from the exe.
---
no mods, but repaired to 200 percent
---
That's what I used to do but lately everytime the 5th person hops off it starts the shutdown process on xbox. Keep at it while you can that's awesome
---
Are you saying that deathclaws don’t drop deathclaw hide? Maybe they’re from the ones that sometimes spawn around my base I swear I’ve seen it semi often and I’m not even that high level barely 70. depends sometimes I get super mutants other times it’s a Yao every once in a while I’ll find one near my base or find one in the wild. No need to act all condescending about it though I didn’t even realize it was rare at all if I ever found any I usually scrap it.
---
Log out and then back in and they probably wont be there.
---
I main the bathrobe. Recently did scorched earth and arktos pharma in it. Not going to take it off just to sleep!
---
Feed the People gave everyone on the server xp boost items and the patch that changed that also nerfed a lot of other xp gains. Draw from that what you will.
---
I'm on ps4, maybe that's why? But yeah as soon as i notice it I'm taking over the world :)
---
I didn't know we were playing Dead By Daylight!
---
perfectly preserved 25-year-old pie that is incredibly hard to obtain 
---
9 caps
---
Usually it only appears in that dome shaped vending machine and it almost never drops. It can take weeks of constant trying to get one. I've never seen one sitting out in the wild like this before.
---
https://i.imgur.com/mqPmM9f.png
---
Weight effects stealth, so light build is the best best. Wooden armor qith the shrouded mod has the best stealth in game. Each piece weighs less than a pound.
---
Oh just saw that they only spawn in containers. Weird I feel like I come across them from time to time not too rare to the point where I’d think about selling it for 500 though I’d just give it away.
---
I would drop ironclad 5 since it's such a low bonus for 10% of your total perks and I'd put it into bloody mess 3 and maybe doggy 2
---
Hope you reported them
---
Time to learn Australian
---
Yeah it's the 308 ammo. I have a be lmg and that's the only reason I don't use it. It's awesome in all regards though, if it only used 556 or 50. Nice to know though, thanks for the numbers.
---
Banned
---
I cant even hold more than 3 or 4 workshops at a time because of all the defend events lol
---
Not only this shit removes all grass for me, now I can't even scrap it same as OP. Fuck Bethesda in the ass.
---
There's 2 types of suiciders..... The ones just stupid enough to sign up for it cause they were told it's an exciting field to work in, exploding with opportunities. 
---
Or the ones that have to be convinced. They are told they will be "Legendary" and upon their suicide they will be granted 72 virgins.....to eat obviously.
---
I have about 40 masks on my other character because I ran the event every time I could when it was active. I dropped even more than that on the ground.
---

I should be on in about an hour
---
Leather right arm is better than left for this. Also shhhhh I like my infinite steel glitch
---
 Just looking for a cat to snap its photo and I end up with 2 Scorchbeats and a Sheepsquatch in the Ash Pit. 
---
 I do love this game.
---
they do take up camp budget though, found that out yesterday
---
I Pick the most important one's. To me that is. The 'taking over the world' comments was me trying to be funny... (i know I'm not) :)
---
Career change.
---
I mean your basically taking over all of Appalachia which is pretty badass
---
Yeah, visiting camps with the new vendor DLC has made me realize just how much they’ve sold in the Atom store.
---
Also because you can’t store either. Only scrap.
---
I once spent 2 hours in Fallout 4 trying to get one of these doped to the gills in anything Luck related.
---
Found out from what?
---
Long story short, but as long as you don't eat spinal/nervous system/brain human meat is just meat.  The Chinese called it 'Long Pork' for a reason....
---
If you look at it that way, Guess i am. At times, if Beth allows me.
---
Loot God looking out for a real one, got a mutants +aim damage plasma pistol and I've made it into my flamer rifle.
---
Now to just craft up some more scrap radium rifles...
---
added :)
---
I'm in western Canada but play late night early morning alot and see a ton of Japanese names. I don't think it's a merging of servers so much as it's the way the servers are acquired. Bethesda isn't using dedicated services they are using Amazon's servers to host the game so wherever the usage is highest is where you will end up logged into.
---
you must
---
I would prefer catmeat, maybe a 175lb mountain lion........
---
i was able to complete this challenge some day ago the problem is thas you need to be stupidly close of the vertibot and being able to take a picture fast enough before he go back up
---
Maybe it's a longjohn or bathrobes
---
Really hoping for private servers so that's a non issue soon
---
Scorch beast piles. I usually find one a day in cranberry bog near the dead alpha at the fissure site.
---
We were able to complete it with the Blue bathrobe. Not an atomshop item cause my friend dropped one for me. No Idea how to get it tho.
---
If pc I can help. I farm legendaries, youve just gotta tag dudes.
---
Whitesprings vendor
---
Yeah I'm with you on that one.
---
Aahn ok thanks. Now i know :)
---
My camera storage is 100% full so I can’t do any of these because all my pictures are memories from beta and early game with friends
---
Can confirm this 👌
---
Clown one (man mask) is a static spawn in the asylum.
---
PvP would be a shitshow.
---
Great for PvE.
---
Any platform can be hacked. Just a bit easier on pc.
---
Agreed.  The concept of 'well this event isn't up/is on cooldown, hop to a server where it's active' is weird.
---
The mechanic is emphasized because there aren't enough events worth doing consistently so everyone is looking for the 2-4 that are.  If there were more things to do that were worth the investment than people would hop less.
---
I doubt its going to happen - there's an agenda being pushed by someone in Bethesda.  You can tell they're fixated on the success of Fortnite and 76 has tried to copy elements from it.  Someone unfortunately is rather misguided but calling the shots from up high so I doubt we'll ever see a full non PvP server option.  As much as I hate it - I know this soft PvP thing is going to be around.
---
I live in the Mojave.
---
I play as the New West Virginia State Trooper....
---
So I wanted to kill her immediately.  Then after her quests I also wanted to kill her for the Valley Girl voice and her unfun quests.
---
I keep 1 thousand script, then I buy a 3 star weapon and maybe a 3 star armour piece. Then I will run whitespings until I’m back up to a thousand. I don’t want to spend it all because I think Bethesda will eventually offer something for like 500, or 750 script. If it is a very limited time offer, and only getting 150 per day. A lot of people will miss out.......
---
Ahhh, thank you very much.
---
Well thank you still
---
Sounds like lag or server issue.  I’ve been playing most of the day without seeing fast travel issues.  If you haven’t already, server hop.
---
I have more games then u cuz im in California. Eat radroach.
---
Are they just called Stalker's Bandana and Stalker's Goggles? Or is is something more than that? Thanks!
---
that wires take up camp budget. I tried placing one and because my budget was full it wouldn't let me
---
Well i dont know what to say then since 2 maybe 3 patches ago they toke it out on purpose was in the patch notes and everything
---
The hell?
---
I think you need to play a radio or instruments to get started.
---
Does it to me as well. Only sometimes though.
---
Yea I was trying to communicate the other day and was like how do I say no!
---
The time is only wasted if the one learning doesn't enjoy being taught. Learning multiple languages allows your mind to work in ways single language people simply cannot. Similar to how those good at math can think far more creatively than those that suck at it.
---
There already is just one language. The words used sometimes overlap, but each language has words for concepts that other languages simply do not.
---
Eh then probably around the 3 to 3.5 range. It's not like it's rare.
---
Being taught english at school and knowing english are 2 very different things. And then comes the accent problem...
---
Probably Camp Flog Gnaw
---
As a member of the Appalachian chapter of the BOS, I can confirm we aren't all like this
---
You're welcome.
---
Yeah it's super annoying. I'll click on something to FT, it'll exit the map and I don't FT. I now just spam the fuck out of the FT button until it sticks.
---
Wow. Well, I guess that about answers that. Lol
---
This has been happening for me for about 2 weeks. It's not just lag and it's not just 1 server.
---
I I think, if i ever get an explosive mini gun, I would have to name it Michael Bay.
---
Dang, doesn’t it get dirty in all that fighting?   I wear my clean bathrobe when I chill around the camp.  😉
---
Curious about all the strange and exotic societies around our post nuclear world? well join Vault-Tec and become an International Exchange Dweller in the V.I.D.E.O program! /r/fo76exchangeprogram/
---
Wow!  Sorry.  Good luck
---
So your flamer does not shoot flames I hope you renamed it Lamer
---
Interesting, abit paranoid, but I see your logic. I've considered doing something similar, save up like your doing but with the intent of dumping it if I find a server that seems to be straight ballin on drops.
---
&gt; Also YouTube needs to be more proactive by not allowing videos to be uploaded for exploits in video games. The person who does this needs to have their videos removed and if it continues they need to be banned from YouTube all together.
---
This wont happen and is really big overreaction.
---
&gt; I keep finding suggestions in my notifications from YouTube showing exploits for Fallout 76. Wtf why is YouTube suggesting me to see exploits? No get that out off the internet.
---
Cause you searched for them , so now youtube thinks you want to see more , same as when you click a random movie and sudently it think you like that specific subject.
---
&gt; Youtube doesn't realize its allowing bad players to share content online that breaks games for companies like Bethesda.
---
Youtube has videos , some videos show bugs and exploits , I do not think it's youtube or the video makers to be blamed for this.
---
&gt; Please Bethesda get in contact with YouTube and make this happen
---
Please bethesda make everyone that ruins the game I like and doesn't play like I want be banned from youtube , it's ez ! it's just a call !
---
While I do despise cheaters ... this is just "NO".
---
&gt; also make a simple selection at the beginning of the trouble ticket setup that says...Report Exploit.  
---
Sure ! 100% agree.
---
But I do think bethesda needs to be better patching exploits and fixing them. It's on them they allowed "fallout 76 bug/exploit" to reach "meme level" on launch.
---
Also most youtubers will only make money IF they have an audience , if said youtubers are getting views from that, then it seems lots of ppl want to see it.
---
If no one watches said videos, I would bet they would stop making , but , like you ... many have actively searched for it , so it's content that is wanted ( be it good or bad ) .
---
&gt;  You can't do anything if you don't know the username which says we have to be required to input when the video doesn't show it at all or if we really don't want to view the video.
---
These videos are mostly made with info that was available in several cheating forums long before the video creation, the fact that bethesda didn't grab the exploit when it was publicly available in forums , after a while some copy-paste youtuber reads it for the "masses" ... and we should blame the youtuber ?
---
Don't get me wrong I do think it's scummy to sell items AND tell how to exploit in a game , IT IS a scummy thing to do, but I woudn't like to have bethesda+youtube deciding what can be shown and not :D
---
So many youtube guides just shows how bethesda cannot at this point handle an online game that needs quick fixes for gamebreaking exploits and that an increasing part of the fallout76 community wants it.
---
That is likely true
---
Clearly Flog got eaten by a Sasquamch.  So his brother made a little alter to his brother F.
---
Tried that too, just doesn't want to start for me today.
---
I named my Cultists Dagger "boney Blade".
---
It’s been happening since 9.5, and it’s occasional. Zero issues before the patch, it’s why I think it’s a bug.
---
Nope doesnt get dirty my agility is so high I dodge all the dust and blood and stuff
---
I think its easier to get them in 76.
---
i tamed my most recent deathclaw pet on the 24th of may. snallygaster on may 26. and mirelurk King on may 31. all via screenshot dates.
---
 a friend just tamed a deathclaw last night. 
---
so they may have been trying to clear up that you needed both 3 full point perk cards enabled (you didn't need it prior to the patch, only the one)
---
I'm not sure, just going on what I have experienced. it's super hard to find one and they don't ever guarantee they come back and when they don't they don't live long. :(
---
Hi, do you mean that the outfit itself is not called the Stalker Outfit? I am trying to add it to the wiki but I don't want to put the incorrect names. Are they called Stalker or Stalker's Bandana/Goggles? And is the outfit just "Prepper Trapper Outfit"? Thanks!!! haha
---
Uh huh.  Lol
---
Meh its no different here on the NA servers can't remember the last time I encountered someone with a mic. We need text chat so bad I don't know why people aren't pushing more for it.
---
Because it’s funny. I personally sell “You’ve Been Insulted!” for max caps in my shop
---
Definitely less stable since that patch.  I was mostly smooth, but since the patch seems like I sudden disconnect at least every few hours.  ☹️
---
I would totally pay for a universal translator plugin for my Pipboy. It would also make Fallout 76 a really interesting place to be. Since you could talk to people from all over.
---
I'll be on in about an hour if your still on and need this.  I could use help with the revive in the water myself.
---
BoS

Bully on Service

Directly from this weeks inside the vault from Bethesda. 
---
Q: Speaking of Fasnacht Parade, is it ever coming back?
---
Maria: There’s a holotape in Helvetia that mentions that since the robots are now in charge, they can ignore the calendar and hold the festivities whenever they please.
---
Mark: My Magic 8 Ball says, “Odds are good.”
---
There is the splitter and focused
---
Without a doubt
---
I wonder how weird would it be, taking in account the fallout lore, if Chinese servers merged
---
If ur on PS4 I have donut recipe
---
Oh thank god
---
Yup, the only question seems.... will it be same time next year, or perhaps sooner. Seeing Maria response sounds like it might happen randomly.
---
Its a random spawn where ever the damaged or weathered ones are. If you dont find coloured variants, dont pick them up and server hoop. I have a white uniform and hat on ps4 if you want it. Just gave away a pink one the other day. Brown is def my favorite though.
---
Do u have another one I’ll buy it off u
---
Stalkers bandana and stalkers goggles correct! 
---
The outfit is, as said, called prepper trapper outfit or something like that. 
---
Hope that helps
---
What?
---
I know there's a laundry room where they can spawn, as well as other spots. I'd just do a full check every server until you find what you're looking for or go crazy and then buy it from a player.
---
I like the YouTubers who make videos criticizing the game while running around with OP duped weapons and armor.  Maybe if you didn't CHEAT the game would be better.
---
i´m on pc. should i search the hole building?
---
Was that a raider? I don't think I've ever seen one in there with a fatman. There's one section where all the gunfire will inevitably light up a car- while turns into an inferno of like a dozen instantly igniting. I've died so many times there because the explosion is freaking massive.
---
You mean the Rifled Barrel mod? Learned to craft it from scrapping Gatling Plasmas.
---
As a Enclave general I leave the fighting to the low ranks
---
Is there a static location i want a second one
---
I looked at the Plasma attachments for AP cost and the longer barrels and splitter barrels all add between 35% and 100% AP cost and the stocks add even more AP cost. So if you want low AP cost you have to stick with the pistol grips with a variant of the short barrel. Capacitor mods don't seem to change AP cost at all. It's too bad the plasma rifle doesn't keep low AP cost because I don't have my special spec'd out for a good gunslinger build.
---
Are you sure your controller isn't broken?
---
Taking the photos still counts even if your photo gallery is full.
---
There is at least one more guaranteed drop point
---
That's how you ruin a game and make it boring. Same goes for those who farm nuke areas all the time. They level up fast but they lose the joy of the game doing the same thing. Been playing since BETA and I'm level  125. This game doesn't bore me one bit only issues are dupers, griefers, and some bugs at times.
---
Power armor is freaking everywhere. You could get a full suit of anything other than ultra, excavator, or xo1 super fast.
---
yes, there is only one. the rifled barrel mod, there are also the beam focuser and splitter nozzles and the sight ring
---
Ohh man awesome thanks 👍 I'll be on soon
---
Buy a new controller. Seriously. Had a keyboard that had a mind of its own. Too much usage? Or some object stuck making sensors pop. Until then lay your controller flat on table and refire that system up.
---
If all else fails smack it while its not connected. Then your good for a bit.. Its like a failing starter.
---
I thought it was bugged as well, but eventually realized I had missed a step along the way, so the DMV part would not start.
---
Have you done line in the sand yet?
---
If this game is still around maybe...
---
You would have to server hop around the areas that they show up at. Try the giant tea pot. If you are on PC, I can trade you a broken one. Name your price.
---
They’ve really made a hash of it I think because they’re trying to be too many things at once. But of course I don’t have any play stats so no idea which play style is really generating the revenue from FO76.
---
Haha I live in New Zealand all new games are $100 or over :/
---
Elevators would be awesome.... But I don't want the one in FO4 (yellow industrial with plywood sheets on the floor).  I want a clean skinnable one for my 4 story loft in the woods.
---
Yeah, i think theres around 20 locations for the uniforms. Some are behind boxes or in the half open lockers. Loot all the staight jackets you find though, they sell for 60-100 at vendors. The first room on the right usually has a colored hat, same with an office on the second floor.
---
This would be great. I have so many unwanted cards it's not even funny
---
GT aGraciousGod
---
sure i should still be on in an hour.
---
Many of the players may be Hikikomori. It's become a tragically common problem among the younger generation but, not exclusive...
---
I've gotten two. I noticed that if the hook is going to grab it, it'll go to the side before lowering down. If the hook goes straight down without going to the side first, it won't grab it.
---
Brotherhood is sort of a fascist group. They pretend they're not, but if you really get into their ethos they're not that great. If you aren't BoS, you're the enemy.  If you aren't pure human, you're the enemy. If you are friends with people that aren't pure, you're the enemy.
---
Unfortunately every time I try to load in I get disconnected.
---
Well, Vault tec is far from a legit company. Maybe having a bunch of people who can't communicate well was part to the plan, like a tower of babel kinda thing. I'm a Canadian and only really speak English (they tried to teach me french, can only understand not reply above a toddler's level.) But role play a mute and only communicates thru emotes and bullet dances.
---
Yes.  The servers sucked last night and when that happens everything loads super, super, slow and stuff like this happens.  I always get paranoid when the servers are super flaky as that's how I usually lose something or get something (server dupe).
---
Japanese schools, for those who perform well enough to attend, are very thorough. If they learned it in school, they actually learned.
---
Really? I haven’t even tried
---
Yeah! He was up in that third floor enclosed bridge between buildings.
---
You can use the "use"button to skip the click spam. Push E and use arrow keys. Uncomfortable but it works. It just works
---
Someone gave me the red version and the hat yesterday. Is this one of the rarer ones? I have the weathered, clean white and brown also.
---
Look up Hikikomori.
---
Yeah! He was up there on that third floor enclosed bridge between buildings.
---
Yeah and it damages your brahmin and stuff. I had to toss all my mutations to get rid of them.
---
Yea you just wont be able to save anymore.. but yes you can still compete the challenges
---
wait, was that sarcasm?
---
Maybe he was trying to RP a ‘protection racket’?  That’s at least a little better than a four man team jumping someone in an ambush when one contests the workshop and the other three mow down the original owner.
---
Best way would probably to buy the plans lol
---
Rifled barrel took scrapping like four of them for me.
---
Ha!
---
He's the Deathrow Marv of Fallout. 
---
Marv gets "executed" in the electric chair and than just spits out blood and calls the guards pussies. 
---
This mutant says hold my milk...
---
The day after they took down the servers was my most steady fps ever in the game. Regular restarts are amazing for virtualized servers. Wish they would do it every day. 10 min off makes the world of difference
---
I like the resources I get from the mobs that spawn.  I don't see a game mechanic issue.  I see a player issue.  So many players seem to not give two shits if my camp is destroyed by spawns.  They want to hop between bases window shopping, but not deal with the wastes in between, even if that only constitutes a couple of ticks that anybody over level 50 can 1-shot, but they leave to ravage my base anyway.  The root of this issue isn't that enemies spawn; It's that lazy assholes who can clean up this issue with a couple melee swings or a magazine of ammo decide to burden their host with cleaning it up, which can end up costing them more in resources and time.
---
Personally, I'd be giddy with glee if they just changed the mobs to aggro on whoever spawned them and attack them relentlessly.
---
And that’s why I murder bucketheads on sight. I’m may be a drug addicted, murdering, thief, but I’m not a xenophobic and racist drug addicted murdering thief.
---
We DO NOT there is already plenty of garbage in ppls vending machines. like the ivory handle plan for 200 caps this needs to stop
---
What do you mean "use arrow keys"? Just went to my map to try arrow keys and the only one that does anything is the one that pops up the challenges. 
---
And for me E is what I've always used. I have to hit E like 10 times to make sure I actually FT and not exit out of the map. 
---
I have found since this has been happening if I am perfectly still, and don't even slightly touch my mouse after hitting E, I'll normally FT the first time, but it doesn't always work and sometimes still just exits the map.
---
Yea I was like ok? Thanks!
---
Ah. On the roof or inside the big main assembly room? Maybe that what's been getting me all these years. Dont think I've ever heard the whistle though
---
Yeah, it’s weird. I watch the sever try to build one of my super old camps before it built my most recent version. Like, it was building a camp I had from a month ago. It’s weird, does the server keep a ton of copies of old camp backups for all players? That could explain a thing or two about why it takes so long for our camps to load.
---
Using armor or power armor? In ultracite armor they aren’t too bad. In regular armor I’m toast lol
---
I beleive performance was hit pretty hard this last patch.  The sliding submerged ghouls and invisible enemies tell you that the server lag is at an all-time high.   Last night was horrific.  My character 'lurches' nomal/slow mo in West Tek (indoors) when I go outside, everything smooths out and it's only a slight lurch occasionally.  I can still fight but everything is janky.  Constant Sever not Responding and Disconnects (immediately after loading into world) especially when SBQ events kick off.  Servers and general graphics perfomance needs serious attention.  This game has been borderline unplayable for he past week.
---
U need one modded?? I got a friend that can mod it to your desire
---
Bethesda just made this the #1 priority for patch 10. European languages script bug and the sneak weapon switching bugs just got pushed back thanks to this post. Thanks /s
---
Damn, I guess I'll try to convince a few friends to help me with the other 2 creatures since afaik it's impossible to keep all 3 creatures alive being just 1 person.
---
No i have one already the body now shows up with no camera
---
I've never found one in the world but I did find one at a camp vendor.
---
If you are under the bridge facing the broken pipe and the main assembly building, he’s right behind you three stories up in power armor and a fatman. Lol
---
If I was Beth I'd get my ass to work and try to comment and put something in the game to remember him as it is technically Bethesda's fault for how their game is made.
---
I usually rely on my perk cards for sneak and it works pretty well. Max out your sneak and pick up covert operative too
---
LOL!!!!! the .38 auto fixer is awesome
---
&gt;This wont happen and is really big overreaction.
---
I'm hoping. It's gotta stop somehow.
---
&gt;Cause you searched for them , so now youtube thinks you want to see more , same as when you click a random movie and sudently it think you like that specific subject.
---
Never searched for exploits and never will. I don't like cheating. YouTube needs to fix this issue.
---
&gt;Youtube has videos , some videos show bugs and exploits , I do not think it's youtube or the video makers to be blamed for this. Sure it's scummy , but be banned cause they showed an exploit in a certain game ?
---
&gt;Expecially since said game has several exploits openly in forums for months before a fix comes.
---
Guess we will have to suffer.
---
&gt;Sure ! 100% agree.
---
&gt;But I do think bethesda needs to be better and faster in patching exploits and fixing them. It's on them they allowed "fallout 76 bug/exploit" to reach "meme level" on launch.
---
&gt;Also most youtubers will only make money IF they have an audience , if said youtubers are getting views and sales from that, then it seems lots of ppl want to see it. ( hmmm )
---
&gt;If no one watches said videos, I would bet they would stop making , but , like you ... many have actively searched for it , so it's content that is wanted ( be it good or bad ).
---
&gt;But your right bethesda SHOULD have a better report system and be much faster in their reaction time.
---
&gt;Having lots of bugs/exploit/cheats appearing and working for X amount of time just make some ppl feel they "missed the train" when it's fixed, so they will jump in the next one.
---
Hopefully they add that system for troubleshooting. Again I don't look for exploits. Stop saying I do. I'm not them, I am me. I look up info on how to locate items or how to do certain things that I can't figure out.
---
&gt;These videos are mostly made with info that was available in several cheating forums long before the video creation, the fact that bethesda didn't grab the exploit when it was publicly available in forums , after a while some copy-paste youtuber reads it for the "masses" ... and we should blame the youtuber ?
---
&gt;Don't get me wrong I do think it's scummy to sell items AND tell how to exploit in a game , IT IS a scummy thing to do, but I woudn't like to have bethesda+youtube deciding what can be shown and not :D
---
&gt;So many youtube guides just shows how bethesda cannot at this point handle an online game that needs quick fixes for gamebreaking exploits and that an increasing part of the fallout76 community wants it. "hidding it" wont fix anything , just make some ppl not be aware of what is going on. Dunno if that is better.
---
&gt;Instead of trying to crack down on info how to break their game, they should just try to stomp on cheating better and faster in their own game.
---
&gt;In fact LOTS of times I have seen that making an exploit public MAKES IT BE FIXED ! How many times have you seen a bug that is working forever , until some youtuber makes a video and then it gets fixed fast ?
---
&gt;Do not get me wrong , I do think these are scummy videos , but to "censure" them so that they wont appear in youtube sarch ( and just the ppl roaming the cheating forums and normal google search will get said info ) is no "FIX" and it wont help nothing other than you feeling better when searching for fallout exploits in youtube and getting a 0 results number ( it doesn't mean they aren't there and being abused ).
---
The gaming community is just not like it used to be. I wish it was cleaned up for many games and not have people causing issues, which probably won't happen since you always have those players plant the seeds of destruction. They are partly the reason why Fallout 76 became a laughing stock and why players like myself don't get alot of viewer on my streams.
---
there was nothing left to do a week after launch lol
---
Oh thats your end lagging out then. When the mouse wont register it mostly due on the server side... But if you direct push dosent work thats client side. Wouldnt suprise me if it or windows causes a memory leak. Most open world games run in to this issue sooner or later.
---
Put some coal in that puppy and fire it back up from start.
---
I don’t get what’s so special about these? I’ve had a few of them and trashed them.
---
Sorry for going off-topic, but:  
---
Never heard of that thing, but that's pretty much me. Are you still Hikikomori if you sometimes socialize on the internet? I'm not sad (not anymore) or anything, I just had so many bad experiences meeting people in my teens that I tend to avoid leaving my house now in my 20s. For the first time in 3 years, I met someone I feel comfortable with and will be going on a date tomorrow.  
---
Isn't that just depression, though?
---
Oh yeah. That dude. That's outside of the factory by the Slocom's Joe and Super Duper Mart. 
---
I've always liked that guy because at higher levels they will be fighting a super mutant behemoth
---
Finally got tired of hoping I would randomly run across the tourist, so last night, I hit wavy Willard’s and started server hopping
---
Took me about 30 minutes and 5 or so server hops for him to appear
---
For the times he did’t show, I roamed into the park, took out the scorched, and checked the lockers by the wave pool
---
Got a bobblehead and a deathclaw hide doing that....
---
the scorched are not smart enough to operate power armor sorry. takes years of training
---
Its in the watch tower with all the halloween decorations or at the pumkin house
---
I had the same experience, met a kid who said I was the first person who helped him when he asked for help. Everyone else had either ignored him or attacked him. However, no one attacked us while playing together I’m level 200 and he’s level 10. But we were mostly running around the forest
---
Ill die for you. Where you want to do this?
---
Take over Poseidon energy workshop. Repair the vertibot landing pad, give it a few seconds and a grounded vertibot will appear. Take the picture :)
---
It’s so sad! There’s way too many grefiers in this game and on here. We are trying to enjoy adventure mode.
---
The coloured ones spawn on the 3rd floor. 2 on bunks and 1 in the shower room. They're a rare find and some more than others. Still haven't found a red or forrest and only got the blue by someone else trading it.
---
Do you have evidence of this? I don't think it's true. Condition loss on my hammer is very low and it's repaired by more than half when it procs. Same for my buzz blade which has a swing speed modifier.
---
I doubt it, I would be just one of countless players with weapons or armor that was illicitly obtained. If anything they would do a scan and delete the weapon at some point, but up until that point I would have a fun toy most nobody else had. Cheers
---
I clicked this I was so excited that planters came out......But ya the take pictures thing was getting stale
---
Preferably in water? ( hoping it will complete the swimmer badge revive req too) Whats your nickname?
---
"This is a very miniscule exploit"
---
Good one smart ass.
---
Do you mean for example, someone in the US making friends with someone on the same platform in Germany, then joining an in-progress game with their newfound friend in order to see what the community is like when playing with all or mostly German or central European players?
---
Telling somebody to launch a nuke to achieve something that isn't possible isn't helpful.  I'm not sure what response you've come to expect when offering unreliable suggestions.
---
I can 100% guarantee that there is no lower cap to AP cost, as certain weapons (I was able to test the submachine gun, combat rifle and assault rifle) with the -25% vats cost legendary effect will have literally no AP cost per shot with the correct mods
---
I hate that part of a workshop. Like if the workshop is claimed in a server you joined, join another. It won’t kill you lol. I’ve vented about this on here and people just tore me to shreds.
---
 Mr.Picklechips
---
Enclave does more damage and they have different crafting trees. With the now realization that enclave ones can't be legendary, they're useless IMO tho.
---
Can you tell me which tower that is or about where it is? I don’t think I remember seeing it.
---
Bring radaway! Gerting my ass handed to me in survival :). But ill hop to you if you add me
---

Very cool, I was hoping that was the case!
---
I can safely say that a lot of people  with "taught-at-school" English level just don't speak because they stumble on some words (*'th' is a big problem*). I can speak English perfectly in my head, and I know how the words are supposed to sound, but actually articulating them is a matter of practice.
---
It just looks so damn goofy...
---
What times are you usually in game? I'd love to buy shielded causual underarmor, haven't seen it at any vendor and never had the plans drop for me.
---
I forget, good halloween watch tower location.
---
You have a piece of the pie, you still need another 5-7 slices to have the whole thing.
---
Also confirming finding one in junk piles.
---
I wish I had your luck.  A while ago I spent about double that time and way more server hops at multiple places to try and get him/her to show, but so far no luck.
---
That's why I think getting a subquest to look for him/her through the terminal would be nice. I don't even care if they give me like 3 different places to search in, as long as it's guaranteed he's there.
---
And yes, not everything in this game should be handed to us on a silver platter, but right now with so many challenges (especially the Pioneer Scouts) that can only be done with a camera, I just feel like I'm being locked out of a lot of stuff just because I'm unlucky with the rng.
---
Irrelevant, mostly.  If the game is losing money, whether or not the rest of the company is doing well, it will be shut down.
---
They *could* keep a losing game running, but it's not in their best interest, or the best interests of the investors, and a company has a fiduciary obligation to provide the best return on the investors' money (within reason).
---
How do you attach it?
---
I use one three star chameleon arm, one life saver leg with improved sneak 3*, 2 sentinel pieces with plus one agility and a dense combat armor chest with AP regen. 
---
Works well. I have a set of unyielding but the added stats from the three stars are better overall.
---
Thanks so much. :)
---
But that's not what I said happened. I said if I move my mouse at all, by which I mean on the map, after selecting FT, even if I don't click any buttons, it cancels the FT and exits the map. 
---
If this is common, why did it only start happening a couple weeks ago, after I've played the game for a ton?
---
I haven't even had a chance to do the quest/event yet - I need that stimpack diffuser! I was lucky enough to get a lab coat (I collect lab coats in game as it's part of my mad scientist theme) because someone was selling one in their camp, but I doubt I will see plans or other gear at this point.
---
Would be nice to have an instance that was solo-mode. I did tool around in there a bit and, while it's not horrible, it is a challenge for a crafting-oriented one-handed weapon using old man in excavator armor #caneshake
---
Confirmation bias.
---
There is a bunch of idiots here turn back now!
---
Honestly at this point I would pay caps to remove cards. I hate having all these unused duplicates
---
It has to be (wait for it).....
---
Night. One Violent Night starts at night and the Temple north of it starts at day break. I sometimes do them back-to-back since they're so close.

You don't.

Pretty sure some of you are.

That's his flog lights.
---
It really depends the country you’re from and the sounds used in your native language. Also english taught at school is not of the same quality in every country. It might be good in Japan (though are all the same school of the same quality) but in France the english taught is usually so-so...
---
You're being ironic, right?  
---
Asians have the highest average IQ and English is the 1st most spoken language in the world. That's an observation, not an opinion.   
---
If I started making reasons for WHY Asians are smarter (on average, of course), then maybe I could be racist. Information is neutral and amoral, it can't be racist.
---
Take this down jesus
---
Every day.
---
Don't forget the Midwest Brotherhood. They saved the world from Terminator level robot takeover. And did it by incorporating ghouls, supermutants, raiders, psychic mutants, machine worshipers, and deathclaws into their ranks. 
---
They are probably the most outwardly fascist branch but they also do (or at least did) probably the most for the community. And they are obviously the least racist (which is what everyone really gets so pissy with in the FO4 East Coast branch)
---
I am being a smart ass, but not to you. I'm making a joke about how Bethesda prioritizes bugs.
---
I'll be sure to pop by as for the camera angle.....ITS SO ANNOYINGLY HARD TO PULL THEM OFF!! But this is a new series and still trying to find its feet so there will be changes down the line. Thanks for the input and sub!
---
To be fair the “bye” emote they actually sold for money and it was just the same waving animation with a new picture floating above your head. Not to mention the whole Christmas emote thing from last year. 
---
But yes, it’s harder to complain about free things even if I do see where they’re coming from.
---
Tons..
---
It's absolutely a bug, and has nothing to do with lag. It began when they started that 15 second cool down timer for fast travel if enemies are nearby. 
---
However it happens when no enemies are near by. No timer shows. It just fails to initialize fast travel multiple times in a row.
---
English is **mandatory** in international dealings. Stock market? You're gonna need English to deal with others. Certain military jobs will require English if a NATO country or a close ally to America.
---
It's a new bug. Not a server issue.
---
I saw my first one yesterday - north Whitesprings gate.
---
Where do you find the handmade? And thanks, but I’m on XB1
---
Stand by your ban!
---
And escape artist.
---
It's from the game data files. Luck of the Draw uses the entry point "Mod Item Condition Loss", with the effect "Multiply Value". Values are -25, -50 and -75 for the different perk levels, with the negative sign reversing the condition loss. Probability is 0.4% for most weapons, 0.3% for automatics.
---
It's less clear how condition loss is calculated in the first place, but something in the range of 0.5-1% per hit for a sledgehammer sounds in the right ballpark to me. VFast weapons may be special-cased for condition loss.
---
Oh oki
---
harpers ferry vendor and watoga I think.
---
Gonna be hard to do that as a coatless corpse.
---
I ran into this EXACT problem yesterday. It's 100% bugged!!!
---
Where is the handmade rifle (or its plans) located?
---
I've have marsupial and healing factor. 350 caps each.
---
Theres a loading screen in 76 that says that T60 was basically “everywhere” before the war. In Fallout 4 theres one that says it was exclusively deployed to Boston 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Done, thanks for willingness :)
---
Crazy idea but... what if they increase the number of players on a map?
---
Launch
---
That definitely makes it seem like the Plasma Pistol is the superior choice for a Vats pistol build then.
---
It's just random, there are still two camera ones it's just the least annoying one (film), so it will keep happening.
---
so you took them all? xD
---
As in "We" do you mean "you"?
---
Also I sell the ivory plans for around 40 caps. I mean if you want to tell everyone how to sell their stuff go ahead but I go based off the market on what's popular or what I feel the price should be for the customer.
---
Another note, some items we call garbage is considered gold for others. So don't think of every item being what you want and instead think of the community as a whole because there will always be that one player who really wants this so called garbage. Think of the community and not just yourself. 
---
I can understand why it's outrageous to see some of these prices but that's why we all look around and not focus on just one vending machine.
---
You hit the nail on the head.
---
How expensive?
---
For players who are ambushed by folks with ridiculous TSE loadouts, it would give us somewhere safe to stash our caps when adventuring.
---
And shrink the "can't build near a neighbor" area so ya know, there can be neighbors
---
Sorry I tried to give advice about something I didn’t know or care too much about. Ngl I kind of wished you were a little nicer because I don’t like not liking people especially this community. I expected the usual friendly constructive feedback this sub usually gives when people are wrong instead of making me feel like I’m an idiot talking to Doc Manhattan or maybe MODUS  haha. Regardless I think super mutant mutilated body bags are the best way to find them from the way your post was titled I didn’t realize those were what you were talking about? Im pretty sure I’ve found some in those too once I realized that’s what you were referring to.
---
Then you obviously haven’t played the game properly
---
very, lol. cant give you an exact number I'm not at my console rn, sorry. but like 1500 ish with hard bargain and grape mentats
---
Worked for me last week.
---
You don't need the plans for the assault and combat rifles, because enemies drop them in large numbers beyond level 20-30. Handmade and lever rifle plans should be bought if you want to use those weapons, and they're pretty good. The radium rifle can be avoided, as it's not good except against bloodied PvP builds and the mods are horribly difficult to unlock.
---
2000 caps isn't much. You get 1400 per day just from strolling into a vendor and dumping the rubbish you picked up in the previous session.
---
20 hrs I believe.
---
Lol why would you take them all???
---
Ok thanks for the help
---
You can also do this I believe at grafton steel.
---
2 caps per shell is the standard rate, and people pay it. The reality is, it's a convenience fee, not "evil". Not "exploitative". 
---
It's not a scam. It costs less than a dollar to make a burger at home. Is it a fucking "scam" to pay $6 for one at the store? 
---
No. 
---
I'm done with your crazy ass.
---
You found a non-gamebreaking miniscule exploit that hurts nobody....Prepare for Bethesda's hot-hotfix incoming in the next three hours!
---
Power armor no, maybe some regular armor can work.
---
Unless of course your paying post fo4, where all you need to do is hop in.
---
A player fresh out of the vault can use the frame, why not scorched? They are still intelligent enough to use firearms and open doors, why not the universally accessible P.A frame?
---
TSE gatling plasma with the splitter melts enemies quicker than anything assuming you are perked for it, but finding an explosive energy weapon is nearly impossible, and you need to be at close range to get the multiple bolts to all hit.  See the video link below.  I see people are selling them on ebay.
---

---
in my experience, there's no problem killing the alpha creature, even with just one or two players. but completing the event is pretty much impossible without a few people.
---
Just scrap any guns to get the plans
---
Not sure, but i find server hoping helps with reset times.
---
Yeah invest into lever and handmade plans and pick up whatever else from enemies like muties, mole miners, and scorched. Keep in mind all pipe pistols can be modded into rifles so u have 3 already
---
Frankly me dear, I don't give a cap.  I like it and I play it, haters be damned.
---
I second 20hrs. From the first purchase during that 20hrs so you can sell throughout the day and not have to stop for (nearly) a day.
---
Doing the lords work friend!
---
I've been seeing loads of new players in the game recintly.
---
Sorry for snapping at you dude.
---
I went to North Mountain Lookout and the Pumpkin House but still no Witch costume :(
---
So I have a pipe revolver rifle 😂
---
Haha.
---
I don’t think that works
---
Just wait until tomorrow...
---
Nah man this game is rooted, the more exploits out in the open, the better.
---
Thanks. That's probably the answer I was looking for. It looks like I just need more in Gunsmith. Still pretty ridiculous how fast the weapons break with a 20% buff to the condition and a repair perk.
---
Make 1400 a day? Howwwww? 😂
---
Agreed!
---
:sigh: I really don't have the spoons to go into this but no, I'm not being ironic. It's not even about language, and what's sad is that you assume it is because you don't even recognize the implied insult that went alongside your 'observation'.
---
Finally, it's literally no one else's responsibility to learn to communicate with you for your comfort just because you happen to speak the most common language. At /best/ , that's elitist. More appropriately, it's racist. If learning to communicate is important to you, then /you/ learn to communicate. Maybe they simply don't care to talk to you. I don't.
---
Love the idea, but i think they need way more server  stability before they can up the count. Events with large population gets riddled with performance issues as it is. Imagine doubling player count, recipe for disaster at this stage.
---
Not that hard. Pick up every single food, gun, junk. Sell to vendor.
---
I have a rank1 hard bargain yet and I can reach te cap limit with a hour of gameplay.
---
Well I have to eat the food and scrap the guns. 
---
There’s a cap limit? Can you sell ammo?
---
You do realize that would mess with the stash weight limit and also camp size, right? 
---
A full server with the majority participating in a large event, causes problems already. 
---
Vending machines mean more stuff in people's stashes, on average. Meaning more server lag in the long run, with a full server. 
---
To increase the server population limit, you're pretty much asking them to spend tens of millions, if not more, to upgrade their servers. 
---
They haven't finished ironing out issues that currently exist, and still continue to release content. For the time being, I don't think increasing server population would be a good idea. 
---
They need to focus on their roadmap while taking care of the game in itself, before making any large adjustments like that. Imo
---
I would say being on a PvP server, why would you think people would be nice?
---
Wasn't on a pvp server lol
---
I AGREE
---
LUL
---
I don't get it. What's flog mean?
---
You can armour him up like a tank, and he loved to play with his teddy bear. That was the best bit.
---
Most Fallouts have a dogmeat......
---
FWIW Bethesda is a subsidiary of ZeniMax Media which is a private company. Its leadership's fiduciary obligation might not be maximizing current shareholder returns - it might have longer term strategies that requires long-term strategies/investments.
---
Heathen!!
---
I don’t think it’s the controller. I have this happen too and had a spare unopened controller around. Switched to the new controller and still running into it.
---
Maybe it should maybe it shouldn’t. It does.
---
Thanks what about the legendary vendors
---
I know nothing about Europe tbh. In the third world (*the somewhat civilized part of it, not war-ridden middle-east countries*) at least, most companies will find you more attractive if you speak English and you're pretty much required to speak English in college (or you pay others to translate your paper for you).
---
If you go low health (bloodied), unyielding is absolutely insane. Is that what you meant by "Undying"?
---
Otherwise, +agi second stars give you sneak and AP, +luck gives you crit gain rate.
---
Probably Chameleon+Powered/Agi/Luck+Sentinel is the "best" combo. Highest sneak rating, best AP/Vats effects, best damage reduction (when not moving)
---
Saw this last week.  I picked up 1 and had about 30 in my inventory lol
---
Anyone know the odds of getting it?
---
I'll sell you one. I'll be around 6pm est gamertag is JS The Ragman
---
That's why I got to give them credit for when then do right.. they saw they read and check reddit and whatnot to see what we say and how we feel.. so if they do go back they will get plenty of angry stuff tomorrow.. but for today.. huzzah
---
I get the Chris Farley/Junky joke, but the 90% reduced weight kinda takes away from it. Chris Farley was a large man. Lol
---
Before anyone gives me crap, I'm a big guy too. Lol
---
They're different for each silo. Go to nukacrypt
---
Great thanks I’ll hit by up then
---
I agree we need it but don't think it's the right time with how buggy the game is.
---
I tried 3 times, only 1 other person showed up 2 of the times. I don't even bother with it now :/ Maybe they will fix it, I like the idea of serverwide events.
---
How it's it that ESO can manage much larger server population with much larger stashes? I think it is doable. I like to at least know that they are thinking about it or looking at options.
---
Whoa, I also have a Deathclaw named Steve.
---
The correct, ingame wording, goes as follows:

---
I'd try player vendors. You can sometimes find great deals at vending machines. That or get the plans to make whichever armor set you want. If you're on PS4 I could make you matching combat armor set that was BoS if you wanted.
---
I want a Halloween event. That is all.
---
I didn't even have to do that. The quest was in my list literally on my first login. For all 4 characters on 2 different accounts that I did it on.
---
Long term gain is a goal of both private and public companies.  If losing money in the short term to gain money later doesn't go against fiduciary obligations.
---
The obligation to make reasonably proper use of capitol exists in both publicly traded companies *and* private companies that open themselves up to private investors.  If we're talking not *quite* breaking even, neither one will probably care all that much, though the company may decide that the assets (including people) could be used to better advantage elsewhere.  If we're talking about hemorrhaging cash, neither the shareholders nor the investors are going to put up with it for too long.
---
hold the fuck on, now, I've seen pretty much every rare cryptid multiple times like the alien, and mothman and fought with them, but since when the fuck was the super mutant suicider in this game?!
---
I’m on Xb but thanks man. Know where to get combat armor set plans?
---
"Yup" it's still derpy and kills friendlies or ....?
---
I'm not saying it's your responsibility to learn English. You learn English if you want to be connected to the rest of the world, because the rest of the world has pretty much unofficially agreed on having English as an international language.  
---
I never said and will never say that you /*have*/ to learn English or whatever. You're just seeing horns in a horses head. If you feel the best speaking with locals, reading, watching videos in your local language, that's completely fine - you're just missing **a lot** of international content (*because it isn't anyone's responsibility to learn english, neither is anyone's responsibility to learn your language*), but you don't have to see those things too.
---
I'm willing to be the problem is permanent structure vs destructible structure. (Player made structure)
---
It is hard on the server to load some people's camps, mainly due to destructible structure taking up more memory than permanent. 
---
This could causes excess stress on the server whenever someone loads into an area, filled with lootable &amp;/or destructible (player made) structure, etc. If multiple player camps were close enough together, it could potentially cause the server to crash by to many players loading into that area at once.
---
I'm not claiming this is the reason, but it makes the most sense to me, from what I know about servers, etc. 
---
I'm willing to bet, if a full server tried to get all their camps as close together, and maxed out their builds. It would probably crash that server.
---
on the power armor bench -&gt;torso modification
---
Just to be clear, not all legendaries just some. But I thought it was supposed to be 100%. Kill a legendary, get a legendary.
---
Red is the rarest, absolutely keep that or sell it for a good 10k
---
/r/76market
---
Save up caps and you can get whatever you want. Sell stuff on there too
---
Platform?
---
I’m down. I’ve selected 3* ranged and almost wavers time it’s been a heavy gun. Really wanting a rifle.
---
On PC? I would like to cone visit your store if so.
---
The colored uniforms are rare spawns only on the third floor, directly next to the elevator. Check the two bunk rooms and the showers. Note that they don't always spawn and they don't always spawn colored ones
---
Getting on now.  You still on and need help?
---
Or you can wait for people to be nice, that should happen asap.
---
Honestly, I had no clue what you were talking about, but I think I get it now. (Maybe.)
---
I use plague Walker and it has never been buggy to me. I think it used to attack people unless you were one pacifist, but they fixed that.
---
Also, bear arms reduces the weight of heavy weapons. It doesn't do anything for melee.
---
If have better mods dont even need legendary perks ...
---
Like make random staggers for 15 secs
---
Give 35 % enemy hp as poison damage  over 10 secs
---
Heal allies on hit ... etc like a support build.
---
3rd person &gt; aim
---
That would be pretty cool
---
Well, I'm not anyways
---
For sure that would be fun
---
Umm...try Grafton station, Wallace (Harper's ferry) or Phoenix (watoga). They might have them
---
You put points in gun runner?
---
Agreed. Some of us only care about the science. Besides, everything ends up on my slab in the end.
---
Don't know about fast travel bug, but definitely see this all the time when i first load in.... basically if i open map before everything is done loading. The nuke always defaults to NW corner. Wait a minute for everything to finish loading and then will display in correct location on map.
---
Of course, this all presupposes that their purpose of conserving technology is worse than sharing it with the remainder of humanity.  History tends to show otherwise though, in our few recorded falls of society, and thus tech level, we saw great deterioration when tech was not preserved during the savage years before civilization rose again.  When a 'databank' was preserved, civilization rapidly advanced after it was mature enough again to use that data.
---
Man i sure hope so, it could be great to see what some people could make
---
True, but he moved like a much smaller man. He was big, but very agile.
---
ps4
---
ILL BUY ONE!
---
How are you/he getting killed in Adventure? Just engage pacifist?
---
Maybe add caps to the payment along with scrip? Something super high, so it adds to the value of caps. They're slowly becoming obsolete...
---
I got u fam. Whata your GT
---
I didn't get killed either
---
I don’t see it
---
So the last time I used Plague Walker it killed the friendly robot you're supposed to escort in Census Violence. I could no longer do that event since I'd just kill it with Plague Walker somehow. :'(
---
That was a long time ago.
---
_Bear Arms_ (with an S) is a perk for heavy guns. The _Bear Arm_ is a new melee weapon from Arktos that's a Yao Gaui skull. I wanted to use the Margarita to run around biting people with a Yao Gaui skull (the _Bear Arm_) while infecting them with diseases because it sounds funny to me.... ;)
---
rads or vats crits
---
What were the other stars on the ski sword?
---
Word.
---
More scorched variants that are dependent on the region.  Each region has an elite scorched variant that can sometimes be found.  In regions where the Responders are the dominant faction, scorched Firebreathers in full gear that wield well-modded ballistic weapons, like combat rifles, and shoguns.
---
In raider territory, scorched wearing raider power armor that can sometimes be equipped with .50 machine guns and auto grenade launchers.
---
In the Cranberry bog, fallen Brotherhood Knights and Paladins wearing power armor that use plasma, and laser gatling weaponry, and sometimes tesla, or plasma guns.
---
They are completely different engines. ESO’s Engine was made specially to be an MMO, Fo76’s Engine is a modified creation engine.
---
I don't know why this got downvoted, this is the funniest and most relatable comment ive ever seen on this sub
---
I asked the same question a while back and I’m not 100% sure but Sadly i don’t think there is
---
Technically the whole BoS is fascist, all factions, because they all believe in a state controlled tech industrial economy, but do not typically run this economy themselves.  While some factions allow civilians more or less freedom with tech, none of them are exactly supporting a capitalist free market economy.
---
As far as I know it is only the Enclave Bunker and the Scorchbeast Queen but I'd like to know as well.
---
AFAIK, they only used to drop from sbq. So at this point only way is from other players who grabbed them when they used to drop or from enclave bunker.
---
I have never heard that and I was/am a pretty big serum recipe collector. I could be completely wrong, but I would think I would've known if that was a thing.
---
I got three x three star wood armor and a rolling pin.
---
At least you can sort of use yours. :P
---
I was told this from a serum recipe collector. I don’t see any evidence myself. Oh well
---
(Luck*4)/20 is the percent chance of getting it per attempt
---
Delayed. We aren't sure when
---
Grats on your date!
---
Not Japanese here, but was curious and did some research. My understanding is that cultural pressure is way more intense there than in any country you're probably living in, and Hikikomori get so burnt on it that they basically become hermits and shun almost all contact. It almost sounds like an extreme anxiety disorder.
---
Damn I'm on XB, I've been wanting to get on a team and farm for some good weapons since mine are shit
---
Technically, the mission should REMOVE food from all the people on the server.  It is, after all, communism.
---
I dig this concept but you need to add gambling for the spectators. Maybe add machetes or switchblades into the battles every now and then. 
---
What about having one fighters supporters wear a specific outfit or stand in one specific area for the fight, maybe a locked in room with a view? 
---
You could use letters to write the wager on a wall for the spectators to see.
---
Damn, I never got that weapon. (Not that I use unarmed)
---
I can't finish that event anymore bc no one ever shows up and it's ridiculously hard with not enough time for the collecting segment.
---
Fiiiiiine I'll see what I can do
---
I like the idea of another cap sink. I don't think they are becoming obsolete though. I make and spend more than ever before with player vending.
---
Im on the ps4 but if a handful of people did this on the xbone and pc it "could" become a thing maybe.
---
"A social update for the players by the players"
---
Players and Enclave. SBQ no longer drops the recipes but IDK if she drops just a serum. I personally have bird bones and speed demon serums. A lot of vendors have them. I think I have 13 BB and 3 SD right now. Marsupial is sold out.
---
Honestly I was red with rage at the moment. I believe Mutant Slayer 30% and I think Group heal?
---
I am on PC so if someone wants it hit me up.
---
By Jove!  I think we've found a wild Capitalist!
---
Would be glad to help...PSN csmit69.
---
Add me as a friend and we can do tonight around 8 est
---
Btw, I'm super stealing that joke. Lol
---
That would be so cool, and make Fallout 76 more of an interesting unique project.
---
na. EP only kicks in at 20%. At that point, you're dogmeat if someone hits you in PVP
---
Not every server is one in the same, they have to allocate their resources to the appropriate projects. It could just be that they didn't have the funding to support a server for F76 large enough to have a bigger player population. 
---
The servers allocated to ESO must be massive compared to the servers F76 is running off of. 
---
Also remember, just because it is Bethesda doesn't mean every game they have, offer the same workforce taking care of it. Not every employee works on every game.
---
Before launching a game, they also have a set of funding and employees working on said game. They have to work within said budget, and sometimes that means cutting out some things, until you can profit from the game and possibly adjust it in the future, to meet gamers demands. 
---
But again, I'm not from Bethesda nor have any concrete info that this is the reason behind it, just the most reasonable possibility I could think of.
---
[deleted]
---
No.  Go away.
---
Fine for PVE, but it doesn't do jack shit in PVP- it only kicks in at 20% health. In PVP, at that point, you might as well already be dead.
---
So no one is getting killed? Then what's the problem? In pacifist players can't hurt you. And you can't hurt them.  So unless you're running workshops, why does it matter if someone shot at them?
---
Just tell him yes, it's all he understands
---
Personally, I've heard so much negative stuff about this event that I have avoided it entirely. Others are probably doing the same.
---
Lol those definitely weren't the effects.  Those are all primary
---
Kit_cloud is my psn. Im just running events that pop up.
---
Have you never been to westtek? 
---
there is always at least one there.
---
Idem pour moi je suis français et je dois bien avouer que dans mon pays nous avons une très mauvaise culture des langues étrangères.
---
Je ne parle pas bien l'anglais et j'ai d'énorme difficultés à communiquer avec les autres ce qui me pousse a joué solo
---
That's just how it works
---
I would say free range needs to be included in this list. I can't keep them moo moos alive by myself.
---
I’m from Bradshaw and I’m sure a lot of West Virginians are playing just not so seriously and we can’t find each other
---
Thats a brilliant idea! Get someone with a high karma or a trusted person in the community to hold the goods and have a legendary buy in competition
---
This right here we should have area an group chats
---
Not until the tyranny of government and the cries of the opressed are gone.
---
This event is so bugged I stopped going to it.
---
Exactly this/\/\/\
---
i cant either, can attached the internal database but not the targeting hud
---
Stop being lazy and open your map more than every 20 minutes. Can't wait for a year from now when there are constant popup messages because 99% of our planet is a lazy piece of shit.
---
 If you want an event maybe check for it occasionally. Maps are too useful to just ignore because you're cool.
---
I would try and max out adrenaline as it’s very powerful and lower some of the other perks that aren’t damage orientated. But otherwise you have all six of the main ones. Class Freak replaced by Bloody Mess maybe as well?
---
Just trying to work out why so many were so intent on trying to is all. Please read the post properly
---
We had a wave of around 16 ghouls after that , we were scared shitless ... But yeah some of them just fall to the ground in a really funny way! I'm just glad that they added this amount of detail in an online game :o
---
Plans for handmade is at Whitesprings, Free  states vendor. Starts around 1800, gets cheaper with grape mentats and bargaining. Lever action is at Grafton same deal. If you really want combat rifle plans they are a reward for completing the mother lode quest, in the mining office close to Charleston train station. As mentioned above handmade and lever action are the only two worth buying as the others drop frequently enough to learn the mods easily.
---
Same. I can do it solo reliably if it spawns a Grafton monster and not a Sheepsquatch - if 'squatch spams ranged there's usually nothing I can do to keep the critters alive. :\
---
Dude!! Tell me about it, if I would've known that that Ghoul was gonna fall the camera angle would be very different lol
---
I have one if anyone reading this wants to trade. I'm currently at work and I don't fully remember the 3 *s. I think they are not god roll but not trash. I'm on xbox as well if anyone was interested. I'm not going a use it.
---
And you get rewarded with a loading screen if you take a picture! This game has a lot of love :)
---
How are you going to balance out unarmed specials and/or people juicing with chems before the fight lol
---
I've gotten four of them legit from the machines, but it ruined the fun when I found out they spawn here. They should make the machine ones slightly different.
---
Should be 250 scrip for a weapon category
---
takes one button and a few seconds to drag and then you know every event currently up on the map. 
---
Please notify me for every event since it boils down to not opening my map to check for events that I am soooo excited to do.
---
I honestly thought the photomode was a dumb gimmick when I first heard of it, but as soon as I saw the photos I took pop up as loading screens I was sold. The camera is just as great (mothman skin is my fave)!
---
Anything would be way better than what we have to deal with now... Having to re-sort my cards over &amp; over again is just painful.
---
I used to be able to take a squatch down pretty quick with my explosive flechette harpoon gun, but I got scammed out of it. 
---
That was a lesson I paid for. Lol
---
Glad to be an inspiration.
---
I understand the OP. I just don't understand why it matters. I'm level 145 and people shoot at me trying to start stuff sometimes, I just ignore them. 
---
On my low level alt I've not had anyone attack me, and have had numerous people just hand me thousands of caps worth of gear. To be fair I haven't played that alt in a month or so, but when I did people were very nice. 
---
It just depends on the people playing at the moment. Some people can't hack Survival PvP so they go to Adventure hoping to start shit. Ignore them and they can't do anything.
---
Well almost have it, doesn't even take that long
---
Literally unplayable
---
Multiple times, but I have never seen one, guess it's time to go searching.
---
It's strange to me how different people's experiences of this are. I only had trouble a handful of times at low levels, and I haven't had any yet with my low level alt. And yet, other people get attacked all the time. I don't know what the difference is.
---
My friend gets a fair amount of grief specifically because she's female, but that wouldn't apply to you.
---
You are getting these video suggestion because either A: they are trending or B: you searched for exploits before.
---
oof, i just started the game but find the main quest quite boring. not sure if I can keep up your pace?
---
I messed about with the build planner, and this feels thematically appropriate.

I remember playing through the last time, I had modern firearms installed and leveled list still intact. He spawned in with power armor and the tank Cannon. Needless to say, no whistle to warn me, and the explosion not only killed me but crashed my game, corrupting my save.
---
*He literally killed me so hard that my character was perma-killed.*
---
No tutorial, you sort of just pick things up along the way. As for crafting tables, they spread out everywhere but if you build a camp, you can stock up with all the different crafting tables. It's just a matter of picking up and learning the plans to build them.
---
Level doesn't matter as much as the point it gives you. The whole reason for level is each time you receive a point to assign to your special stat ( strength, perception, endurance etc) . Each point allows for 1 perk card to that special stat. These perk cards are key to everything. You can get cards related to survival like reduce radiation, or stuff to buff up weapons, like adding 10% to rifles damage...
---
Since you don't have any rad-away(removes radiation)... just die... once you die a couple times the system respawns with full health. 
---
Unfortunately I'm on ps4, otherwise I'd hook you up with a welcome package...
---
Rather than try to poorly answer your questions, I found a [tutorial video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/3Q6I0A-5KFc) that seems what you're looking for. 
---
You probably passed a bunch of workbenches in Flatwoods, plus the ones at the Overseer's camp. Specific workbenches are for crafting and modifying different kinds of items, and most of them will let you scrap your junk into crafting components.
---
Thanks, that might explain what I saw. However it's the first time when I managed to catch this "default" blast zone marking. My lucky day I guess.
---
He basically kept hitting things with the mininuke, but when it failed to explode, he shrugged and [kept going... until you showed up](https://youtu.be/mZ16vBxPcT4?list=RDWabCrFiIDaM&amp;t=191).
---
6 servers and nothing. i will buy them
---
There’s a couple perks u put in there I hadn’t thought about but I’ll have to try and incorporate into the build
---
The bargain perk is trash in my opinion. Just fine it at someone's camp.
---
Haha, I get a lot of Japanese people too, but I'm West Coast USA. Being randomly taken into the group by a few Japanese dudes was definitely an experience.
---
It makes sense that it would see wide distribution, as I think one of the loading screens in Fallout 4 said that the T-60 model was essentially an update to the T-45, with the basic design of the model looking just like a bigger version of the T-45. Basically the Military took what they learned from the T-51 line of Power Armor and applied it to update the dated T-45 line. So wide distribution of it makes sense, as it's like going from a PS3 to a PS4.
---
I was mostly going off what felt like perks that translated well from his actual skills and style, so it may not be max-damage or anything. Should be fun to try though!
---
Happens a lot more since update. Sucks.
---
They still have a fascnacht festival at the end of winter I’m pretty sure, and that seems reasonable I would just like to be able to actually get people together and roleplay as actual West Virginia survivors lol
---
Thank you very, very much!!
---
Fun facts - in Japan they don't jave the letter 'L'. Also, most of their consonants are always followed by a vowel. Such as 'ka', or 'ko'. 
---
So 'Flog' would likely be changed to 'Furogu', in Japan.
---
Well considering without the perk the plan is over 1300 caps, and I can’t find it at anyone’s camp, like I said, that’s kinda hard.
---
Thanks for all the updoots! :D I appreciate it. I really hope they add this as a feature in the somewhat future... &lt;3
---
what mods are best for a combat rifle? i picked up a quad combat rifle with vats cost reduction and i wanna see if i can vats with 80 bullets lol.
---
Martial Artist no longer works with any of my guns.
---
Side note: It being "in since day one" isn't exactly a good indicator of intent. There were lots of silly combos that were "in since day one" - like double dip grenade launchers, explosive lasers, duping items at the Enclave........
---
I rather play 50 cent bullet proof
---
Oh yeah well we have pepperoni rolls, Checkmate.
---
I thought the lost hills bunker existed as some micro state within the NCR? I could be wrong though, but I thought communications had been cut with the west because of elder Lyons, and the outcasts were trying to reestablish comms with them.
---
Then when Sarah died the outcasts were absorbed back into the east coast faction, and maxson was legitimised by the lost hill elders because he was the true heir.
---
Love the lore of this game lol.
---
Loved the Midwest bro hood!
---
Did you not do any of the Fastnacht stuff? Some showed up during the parade.
---
Oh man yeah. I've hopped dozens of times looking for certain things. 6 is barely scratching the surface.
---
I agree with that, the state definitely needs a change in politicians
---
I'm in the NW American servers and get a lot of Japanese players as well. Made decent friends with one who needed help doing the silo runs despite him being higher level. Really cool dude. Didn't understand a word of what he said but god damn could he emote effectively
---
American here, met a french guy who spoke some limited english at around 3 to 4 am my time, he was super chill and we went back and forth trying to teach eachother our native tounges, props to him tho cause hes way better ar english than i am af french
---
Our voices are soothing lol
---
Sorry for the long post, but I'd like to add:   
---
I'm absolutely sure you're a very smart guy, the way you write and articulate makes it clear, but for your own sake, forget politics in such unrelated matters, politics has become (or has always been idk) very emotional and clouds anyone's reasoning.   
---
I know you already know that, but I'd like to remember you the world is a lot more complex and amoral than what our current political climate wants us to believe, keep following the intellectual path and don't fall on those traps.  If not for any other reason do it so you don't lose friends and family over such matters.  
---
Nature doesn't care if you judge her racist - I think Asians higher IQ is mostly due to cultural differences, but **IF** nature made so that white men are supposed to be dumber than Asian men (therefore being "racist"), then so be it. When we see a dog killing a cat for play and feel bad about it, and think "*wow that's evil!*", but that's only natural - it's natural that we feel and think that way, and it's natural that the dog does that to the cat. We can't attribute moral judgements to nature.
---
I like you, man - don't think I don't because we disagree - you have lots of potentials, you stand out from the crowd. I can see you being the intellectual guy that one day will realize: "Wow, so that's how things really are", and that's very special - maybe not now, maybe not tomorrow, and maybe I'll be the one to realize how things really are.  
---
Just be cool and keep thinking.
---
The Midwest chapter accepted everyone into their ranks, even ghouls and mutants!
---
I have just started playing again, I know what it is I just don’t know where it is.
---
Wait, what now?
---
I was aiming to make a joke build with just a minigun and enough 5mm to be nearly overencumbered.
---
LOL!
---
Some of my ghoul-related nonsense.

Run forest run
---
Low ranks doesnt exist, i'm also general
---
But i roleplay as "The Shadow of Enclave/The Ghost of Old World" so i usually raid people, today i stole 26 legendaries
---
That's the kind of discussion I like, you do have a simple solution, and it's one I can dig. I took the leap because frankly it seems  the community is in a collective agreement that Royale might be the direction for Nuclear Winter. Maybe I am just salty towards legendary gear, but I'm glad you're concise enough to help me see that might be what I'm really upset about. Mostly my frustrations come from getting one hit by legendary level people camping in overseer locations, and when I do finally kill them I get maybe 2-10 caps for it which is appalling.
---
that sheepsquatch corridor is super neat and cool
---
It was first reported Mid-november and its still being reported at the start of May, that's a long time for a bug to go unnoticed, haven't seen anything since...
---
50 feels kind of high. I think maybe 5-10 boost from now is enough.
---
Did you hook up electrical to it?
---
Yeah why would I collect clipboards for 1 wood each when I can get between 3-8 woods per log. I usually just FT to flatwoods and walk in one direction for ten minutes when I run out of wood. Can easily get 200-300 wood in 10-20 minutes.
---
Lol I just went back to a nuked zone for the first time since this post and crashed after 10 minutes of looting cobalt flux. The nuke was in Charleston. There were very few enemies. IDK why this game can't handle its flagship feature.
---
As of this response, it has 76 upvotes which is the only reason I didn't upvote it
---
I look at it like the Brotherhood is Lawful Neutral. Players that play that way align to a strict moral code but in general serve their own interests. 
---
Player Raiders are Chaotic Neutral. Sure, they might blow up your camp if it suits them. But they're equally as likely to hand you high-tier weaponry or rare plans just for the fun of it. 
---
"Raiders" might be a bit of a misnomer in this instance. "Anarchists" might be better? Idk
---
Yeah, youll just level really quick. You just have to do any amount of damage to an enemy to get xp.
---
It must be trending then
---
True, but even I am running out of plans to buy, and I'm only a lvl 150. I sell plenty of items as well. I just need and excuse to spend a bunch all at once. Not on the sheepsquatch though. 😖
---
Whats your psn?
---
I have a ps4 pro wired with gigabit internet. It's not the internet. The game is crashing. Don't give me this is not a c crap because that's no excuse. Nothing else runs this poorly. Their flagship feature,  dropping nukes, is broken to shit.
---
Go to the trade subReddits.
---
No. None of the 5 times I've gone in now.
---
What size Generator are you using and do you have anything else hooked up to it?
---
Artillery only takes 3 power or 1 small Gen, but anything else on the same grid (like Vendors) will drain power from it.
---
I used to run Laser Gatling and Gatling with MA. I know. You can dig through my post history here. ;)
---
Bethesda isn't the best at QA. It took forever to fix typoes in "Missile Launcher", "Technical Data", and the electrical connectors being called Barn Building Set. They still haven't fixed Robot plans being called "Robot Left Arm" or whatever they're still called.
---
Those aren't even _code_ like what would be involved with patching Martial Artist. They're just stupid typos. :P
---
Everyone wants to be the Brotherhood because they are the "good guys". 
---
Unfortunately most people are also dicks. 
---
Also they may not actually be in a Brotherhood group and are just wearing the combat armour with insignia because that's the best armour.
---
They indicated it was fixed a few months back.
---
That’s why I’m here, nobody’s answering, lol.
---
I'd more willingly believe that patrols of Enclave survived MODUS' purge and got scorched than Excavator armor was around.  If I remember, the suit we make is supposedly the third one ever
---
How about they put them in game instead of a cash shop.
---
Yea they are fun to collect and a curator type build is fun too lol
---
That was fantastic!  I literally laughed out loud reading it.
---
Fair. Clarification would be nice from them.
---
I ran into a base that had a sign saying, "Please go kill my super mutant neighbors. Thanks :D". So I go and kill them, and I start looting the house. And what do I find? A whole box full of one stars and one there star weapons. Also some one star armor. Maybe it was a reward? Idk XD I took it and ran.
---
Mid West Brotherhood brother! We welcome all races and muties into our ranks.
---
You got the source there mate?
---
If your on ps4 I have a 2 star Anti Armor mini gun and plenty of 5mm to make your dreams come true
---
Thanks, what about for PVP?
---
That doesn’t change the fact that the organization as a whole is very hateful to most non-humans, and even a lot of humans are treated with a relative distaste.
---
I wish more people enjoyed collecting all the stuff in the game, most people don’t.
---
There is a spawn chance at the radio tower near whitesprings
---
Thats amazing game play right there
---
but the negative effect becomes active after 2hours when you use an serum :D
---
It no longer affecting Gatling speed was in the patch notes.  Don’t remember which parch.   Of course Bethesda has accidentally undone things on more than one occasion.
---
You can actually get the Pie?!
---
Cool, thanks.
---
Hand pick the ones with little downsides is all marsupial, healing factor, speed demon. That kind of thing.
---
What I mentioned was the mods for them you can pick up a assult rifle and scrap it to get the mods.
---
They will do it for the atom challenges though
---
... or 250 or 500!
---
I’m a 2 hand melee build on two of my characters (I know it’s stupid and redundant and am working on switching one to heavy weapons) and have turned in &gt;30 attempts at a 3 star melee weapon and have gotten ZERO sledgehammers, super sledges, fire axes, or even a multipurpose axe.
---
Maybe during special events there will be an extra powerful scorched wearing excavator armor and using a pickaxe
---
I use wood all the time. How else will I boil my water or cook my glowing meat? 
---
If i ever have a surplus i simply bulk and sell it for caps. 
---
You can get this challenge just by playing. No need to grind. It's not even that hard...you're just inpatient. Just enjoy the game bud. Take a moment to smell the roses.
---
Also make sure to check every container, especially suitcases at R.R. stations. Idk if people still do this with player vending up, but we used to drop extra stuff in there for noobs and to ease weight. I personally like to hit the toolbox at the overseer’s camp for drops like this as well, just for the likelihood that a new player will find it and can use them.
---
I fully agree.  \*\*\* legendary ranged weapon is way too broad a category.  I keep rolling up heavy guns when all I want is a rifle, or possibly a pistol for my alt.  My alt keeps getting boxing gloves and chinese swords when I want two handed weapons.
---
I'll happily pay 150-200 scrip for the pleasure of a more specific random roll.
---
I used a fusion gen
---
This is why, if I get a pet, I will be making a sign that you'll see as you spawn in, which says the animal is my pet and won't hurt you.
---
Will someone kill it? Oh most likely... But hopefully not for that reason. :)
---
That's sad, man.
---
What do you mean about "cultural pressure"? *I know I could do my own research this myself and not bother you, but in some matters, I prefer people's views than a wikipedia page, so it would be cool if you could elaborate on it.*
---
This makes me think it's related to incels and shit. Recently we had an "*incel motivated*" school shooting here in Brazil - first ever in the country's story. 10 middle school alumns dead, pretty shocking even for me.
---
You think Japan have a problem with this type of thing too? It's such an isolated country, I feel like we from the west knowv ery little about it other than samurais, sushi and pretty women.
---
Ye old flog shed
---
&gt; „wild apallachia“
---
nice formatting
---
I'm surprised. In my experience each client requires a separate login. It disconnects me from one if I use repeat credentials.
---
Everytime I see it pop up there is only one or two player at it they need to let everybody know it's started as the imposter sheepsquatch is busy.
---
Honestly, me either outside the Faschnacht event. I looked up where to find one on YouTube and got lucky with it spawning the first time.
---
This post makes absolutely no sense.
---
Honestly, I feel like there's a couple dozen way bigger issues that Beth should focus on.
---
Is it even possible to get a camera picture of an Alien, still? So that's 40 less Atoms we could have gotten from a functional weekly. 
---
Imo today's dailies are a coincidence, not a sign of Beth changing the dailies for good. At least wait until tomorrow for a better idea.
---
Lol got one!
---
Yeah that too, forget about it because same reason as project paradise...
---
76 is a survival game. You need to eat and drink and manage your rads. (Radiation)  Since this is your first time you might want to start in adventure mode till you get the hang of everything.
---
When you went through the vault the Mr Handy robots each manned (or robotted) a display with items. You need to take all those items and speak at least once to each robot. How to gather supplies, how to use the the camp, and how to get rid of rads were all explained inside the vault. 
---
Once you leave the vault the last vault robot tells you to go to the Overseers camp. At her camp you will find food and water, a cooking station, crafting tables, and a brief tutorial on making a weapon and making armor.  Her camp is stocked with supplies you can use and is a few yards from the river where you can collect water to boil.
---
If you continue down the road to Flatwoods you can run a couple of short quests for the responders.  These are tutorial quests where you learn to boil water to remove rads and how to cook food. If you run around the town you will find lots of meds, food and supplies. You also get several holotapes that recount what happened to the townsfolk. At level 6 you should try the event if other players show up. Completing it and the responder quests will give you recipes and plans. 
---
There are player guides posted on here that can cover all this in more depth. You may also want to look up the camps sub to get instructions for building and see photos of other player camps.
---
Equip woodchucker and follow the dried riverbed south east from Flatwoods. You can collect 300+ in like 5 minutes.
---
It could be plausible for ghouls too! If they turned while in power armour, imagine a broken suit of power armour running at you to beat your ass.
---
THIS.
---
I want to know why there is now 5 stars for weapons and we only get 3.
---
You got deez nuts on your chin.
---
Hell yes.
---
Just like infested terran
---
I get it 😉
---
It sucks. I was so excited for Project Paradise but it's just way too difficult with no good payoff or reward.
---
Im going to up vote that for originality... But mostly you made my day kind sir :)
---
The tiered ones just come over time.  I never chase them.
---
Whats more aggrevating is that it doesnt count the amount you collect from a log, just the amount of logs you collected from gotta hit up 7600 logs and wood piles i think, cant remember why i gave up doing it but that may be the reason, dont hold it against me if im wrong lmao
---
Do you know which BoS group did this? There are many
---
It’s a big country. People can use the same name. It’s really not that deep. Plus, it’s highly likely it IS a coincidence, because the Ultra Luxe existed pre-war, so the White Glove Society didn’t name the Gourmand restaurant.
---
I like her she's kind of cute.
---
Nah b. Trust me I have in my stash right now 20 bulk wood and all that wood is from scrapping things in the world. Exploring buildings and playing the game. Not running through the woods picking branches with my thumb up my ass lol
---
The problem is you're wrong. What you see in the Pip-Boy is the COMBINED damage. The direct damage is pitiful. Like 2, or 4. The explosive damage is the vast bulk of it. So yes, Dense+Fireproof make you immune to explosives.
---
Actually, in the testing I just did between my two accounts, my alt acount shooting a 160 damage missile launcher at my main with 220 armor and a Dense torso mod, barely even scratched him. 1, maybe 2 damage. That's without even having Fireproof active. I think something's bugged there.
---
Having the same problem with the cryptids one too. I took multiple pictures of them, no credit. Also the same with the pioneer scouts pictures one too. Ugh.
---
You looking for one? Not sure if max level, but i have a 2shot and an anti armor one on me if interested. I think 1 is lvl35 if not higher.
---
I currently run a "crafting is caring" build (I pick up all the craft bonus perks and all the team-support perks and mutations) and plan on eventually going with a flamer for the team-heal perk that supports it (I am waiting to switch over until I can find a really nice \*\*\* flamer) but use unarmed/1he for now so I don't have to worry about ammo.  
---
I regularly run with over 1k diluted stimpacks and a stash of molotovs so I can tag creatures for EXP (I really wish they would fix this so, if you are on a team, you don't have to tag anything to get EXP and loot - sure would save on inventory space) and really enjoy it. (I run excavator for the storage capacity)  
---
I thought about going with a rifle build and using syringers exclusively for that pharma-chem theme, but until I find a \*\*\* worth using, or mods viable against higher level enemies, I will stick with bottles and blades.  
---
Santa Claus beard/Plague Doctor mask, Arktos Lab Coat/Science Scribe outfit, Medical Goggles/Civil War Tophat, and currently a Nuka Cola backpack until I get the Arktos, and of course the Arktos Excavator paint... kinda helps me stand-out as a Medic.
---
Only if you lagged severely or didn’t get a hit on her. I’ve had it do it during lag as the server didn’t think I had participated.
---
FO76 servers and game engine can't handle that much players on the same server.  20 players is already too much.
---
Yeah. We don’t need to know the entire history of the Trappers to put two and two together, it’s a neat little nod and bit of continuity, even if we don’t know the full story of how they got from Point A to Point B.
---
Wrenches, or if you’re on PS4 come find me, lol.
---
Yup deffo I have a 1080ti last patch was fine this I can see it struggling at times and that's just running around not in combat.
---
well, I think FO76 missiles follow the FO4 items, in which missiles do have ballistic damage on a direct hit, but it's really minor. In FO4 it's like 15; I think it's a lot less in '76. It's made me suspect and semi-verify a few other things that that causes with some of the legendary effects.
---
Could off been a drill.
---
me and a friend have had this issue where we participate and get decent damage on her and she drops negligible stuff
---
Others commented with actual answers and advice, I’m just dropping a note to say....
---
“Welcome to the wastelands!”
---
It’s open world.  Read every note, listen to every holotape, do every quest.  Especially at the start.
---
Glad you liked it
---
Done it and started again got to get my atoms.
---
When i looted them it showed up as 2 and 1 hour later i look into my inventory to find this mess.
---
I do exact same, explore building and playing the game. Most buildings have wood piles you can grab wood from. No need to run through woods with your thumb up your ass, but whatever floats your boat man, i don't judge.
---
I can sell it for 600 if need one
---
Bethesda Load App, Fallout 76 App, and Task Manager all present on taskbar.  Can kill Bethesda Load App from taskbar.  Can kill Task Manager from taskbar but cannot get it to do more than flash the popup screen briefly.  Cannot kill Fallout 76 App from taskbar.  As I said, this behaviour started with Patch 2 or 3.  Prior to that, Ctrl-Alt-Del would bring up the Task Manager screen over Fallout game screen and allow killing Fallout process (followed by sending of "crashed program info" to Microsoft).
---
Honestly I personally don’t think it’s that deep and it’s probably just a coincidence, but it’s a fun theory.
---
So, honestly for me, my main is level 62 but I've been avoiding Arktos because it seems too complicated, and the rewards are too low for me to want to take the time to actually learn about what I need to do so I don't piss anyone off or screw up the whole event. I figured I'd go back once I was a higher level so my impact was higher and chance to botch everything up was lower :-/
---
Found a really good one the other day and scrapped it.
---
Did you at least get the event awards?
---
Lmao at the third one wtf !!? Ahahaha
---
Had this happen once but it was after a disconnect. Lost the whole chassis. When I logged back, it reverted the game to around 5 minutes before the disconnect (I'm guessing the server crashed and didn't get a chance to update the player db). I had items I had sold but the x01 was gone.
---
Guessing it had something to do with it being deployed during the disconnect while I got into excavator. You couldn't rename in those days so deploying your x01 first was common, you didn't know which was which. They were trying to stop duping at the time though. At least plans are available now days. Only thing to try is check your inventory too after a relog, maybe it timed out and returned.
---
I’m on PC, and I drop stuff in the blue suitcases at train stations all the time.   Especially Charleston.  I only use two types of ammo, and scrounge everything leaving lots to dump.
---
i got grounded marsupial speed demon and scaly skin right now you think class freak is not worth with those mutations ? would also get healing factor
---
I cheated and bought one for 100 caps.
---
A regular legendary mutant just gets really sad...
---
I tried that, no dice
---
It's like the chemistry bench. Why do people putbplabs for that in their vendor for its' normal price? Waste.
---
There should be one on the roof of sugar grove, if they havnt removed it.
---
Its all part of the fun and games my man, makes everything that little different everytime
---
Is no one going to comment on the real gem here? The elephant in... The Room?
---
I’d try it with, then unequip and check yours special stats and maybe play a little. I noticed no difference except I lost carry weight because of Bird Bones, but I knew that would happen. My backpack cancelled that loss and it freed up some precious points for my agility
---
Yes, They were not very good a crappy armor piece I could have gotten in about 2 minutes at whitesprings
---
From my experience playing multiple online games, it’s all about being in the same time zone &amp; in the “same internet area” (think of giant internet cables connecting places).
---
Most likely from Aus we’re dealing with servers that are located somewhere in Singapore and are serving Oceania region ie Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Australia &amp; New Zealand. 
---
Most likely Japan, Korea &amp; China got their own servers.
---
...and he runs around stealing shts from our camps.

We are here though we are few. We who shall see the glory of America returned to the people. We who are free!
---
Flatwood monster counts an alien half the time... it's always worked for me but 1 time
---
Go back to playing fortnite
---
Assuming it was possible without sacrificing stability this would be awesome - how about opening a new vault that players could start a new character from with a whole different set of perk cards or something similar? Might be an interesting way to go.
---
General theory is you have to get 5% of the total damage on the queen to get loot. I've never seen hard data to back that up, and I've gotten loot off her with one good crit before, so...yeah. Sucks, but it happens. The only known thing that MIGHT help is do more damage. Which is...you know..the goal anyway.
---
He'd been listening to a lot of [late 90's R. Kelly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIQn8pab8Vc).

I’m on XB1 but thanks

On torso, the spacebar

I strongly suspect your underlying logic - that objects placed by players are more demanding than objects that are permanent - is correct, but the detail of why is not really to do with destructibility. As an optimization technique for Fallout 4 Bethesda implemented a "precombine" system whereby objects placed permanently in the world are combined into a single object, which makes loading and rendering them easier. In Fallout 4 this wasn't done to objects placed by players (since generating precombines is something done in the Creation Kit, not dynamically in the game), so assuming that Fallout 76 uses the same sort of system, then player placed objects are indeed more demanding.
---
You can read more about precombines at https://bethesda.net/community/topic/86381/understanding-precombines-previs-and-why-mods-that-disable-them-can-cripple-game-performance?language%5B%5D=en
---
Also some way to pay script to level up an existing item, more script the higher the level you go.
---
I guess that’s fine. I’ll need to be complicated and pay with one character and you give it to another one.
---
I'm suprised how expensive the revolvers are in VATS. Does that mean it'd be better to go with a 10mm or Guerilla over revolver and Gunslinger for VATS builds? I'm not the greatest with builds.
---
I mostly mind my own business...
---
I know all of this is far flung fiction, but it's depressing to see two factions with the same ultimate goal of protecting the public at odds. But then I'm reading into a more benevolent side of BoS that we see in FO3, vs the one in FO4, which seem to have little interest in local welfare. They are ultimately a bit cult-ish in their mission.
---
I found one and I just ate it.
---
Ah it's gone then. I can craft everything for x01, all the mods too if you have the mats (PC).
---
Or you know, ask here and maybe Bethesda will see it with enough upvotes :)
---
Got any Jet bro?
---
I'm not sure why they would try to attack you anyway. A level 2 can't be killed and the level 100 character could have pacifist enabled.
---
2'nd that, the few days it did not work since the mod was released were the only few day I did not play. Beth, look at it, use it, see how much of a positive game changer it is, pay the man, get it baked into the game.
---
I think a got a good bit, probably about 1000 damage
---
Also provide no benefit and only a small amount of hunger sated.
---
Ok I'll join you my gt is gamer42083, gotta come to me tho
---
My personal take on it is this: I’ve already acquired the backpack mod and stash I wanted from the Pioneer Scouts so investing the time into earning the other badges isn’t very appealing; Encrypid drops suck, and I already have the imposter helm and mascot outfit so I’m good on that front; Free Range has the lure of staff mods, but even the Sheepsquatch staff is underpowered to say the least; And hearing about the problems with Project Paradise and seeing the mysterious injectable in player vending has underwhelmed me to this event’s value.  I didn’t know about the backpack skin till just now, so that’s about the only reason I have to check it out.
---
Not for nothing, but I think you're mixing up the Free States with communist revolutionaries.  The Free States in the game barely cared about others, and had to be convinced to even help Harper's Ferry, then ran when it was attacked and bunkered down again.  They dont seem like freedom fighters for the people.
---
You have to hop servers sometimes...they spawn there though
---
Have they fixed most of the major issues that plagued release? The playerbase seems like it's still there and healthy. I was a fool and waited for anthem and bought that 🙃
---
Loved Fasnacht.  It was more than just a chance to earn something rare.  The atmosphere of the events, seeing other players goofing around on the parade route, and keeping those robots alive even if it meant them crawling to the finish made the event of me, and I’m sure many others.
---
Yes. Much smoother now. Still has some issues (what game doesnt?) but not game breaking anymore.
---
This has been talked about SO many times here, just do a very quick search and you will find all your answers. Have a good day.
---
Yes cap pool is shared now at 1400.
---
I got the weapon I'm happy with, just curious about the 25k limit you mentioned more than anything.
---
Yeah. It's really disheartening
---
Damn! They definitely used to be separate, that's wack.
---
Nah, it's kind of like the Camvas bag. You pay for one thing and then get something else instead.
---
This thread is golden. Thank you
---
Is there a pet cemetery in Fallout 76?  Perhaps he wasn't sent from heaven but from... 😲
---
Yea they were separate, but you would not have a full 1400 a day due to fast traveling everywhere to get said caps. Now it’s a one stop shop.
---
This.
---
Sounds about right. Is the lead lined backpack bugged? I been getting no rads using it with pa in a nuke zone. Haven't done it enough to say for sure, and there is a bug in the game where rads magically go to 0.
---
I’m sure it’ll be for future content, there’ll probably be some event that rewards 4* and 5* items
---
And this also.
---
I said NOW. Not at the time of the previous posters. But thanks for your respone
---
No one is doing that.  They are just duping the good stuff.
---
O::::
---
Glad you found it productive. I think the consensus on Nuclear Winter is incorrect. It does seem that there’s going to be some kind of PvP element to it, but I’m just not buying that that’s going to be the core of this entire run of content. 
---
I could easily be wrong, but it just wouldn’t make sense with the player base so heavily into PvE and the game finally digging out from the rough launch press. 
---
I have fun with PvP from time to time, but it’s limited. I spend maybe an hour or so a week in Survival. It’s fun, I go in expecting to die a lot and just have fun stalking other players and getting the drop when I can. Eliminating legendary effects (of which I have many on my main character) would make PvP more interesting. Fewer one shot battles, an emphasis on skill over gear, and an incentive to play the game and improve your crafting abilities to get an advantage would all be tangible benefits.
---
Yep.  Hopefully the maintenance announced for Monday will help.
---
All 7 factions now share a single pool of caps. 
---
1400 total, which refreshes 20 hours after your first transaction. 
---
Also, you can visit all the faction vendors at once in White Springs. They’re all in the shopping area now.
---
Thanks for the info!! Btw its "Impatient" not "Inpatient" inpatient is when you're in the hospital awaiting medical treatment...
---
It gets asked about a dozen times a day.
---
Would be keen if they were really endgame and had perks like fills any partially depleted fusion/plasma core to 100 over a fair duration of time
---
Damn, I've also tried that but with 0 luck. I'll keep trying, thanks.
---
I’ve seen a few people here throw around the idea that we could tag any events we want through our personal terminal and be notified when they start.
---
Bayonet for my 50 cal please too.
---
I'm tired of energy weapons and dopey ranged garbage. I haven't used the script stuff in 2 weeks.
---
Totally off-topic but you wouldn't happen to be half-Vulkan on your father's side would you?
---
Side-notes and rambling:
---
Both you and the wiki(s) are likely correct. Your data is simply more up to date. This is of course assuming that no human error was made. I like living on the edge what can I say? A lot of the data on the wiki(s) was pulled directly from the game files via an xEdit script and subsequently mass processed into the wiki format *early on*. It saved a seemingly insurmountable degree of manual labor. The expectation that followed is that various contributors would not only iron out the details but also keep it up to date. With all that in mind, I hypothesize that the discrepancy is likely due to a combination of undocumented balance changes that have occurred since that initial "dump" and said expectations not being sufficiently met.
---
I've always preferred my combat shotgun and sniper rifle over the other choices on each specific character build (VATS only). That's a shame about the railway rifle. I don't currently play any ranged non-VATS builds so I look forward to a fix! I adore that little toot-toot sound that the railway rifle makes when you reload so much so that I want to build a character around it. It certainly has piqued my interest more than my latest character build which is called "Project Rocky 76."
---
You've helped me to clear up a significant degree of personal confirmation bias suspicions. I can't thank you enough for both that and this entire post!
---
This was widely publicized when it went into effect two months ago.
---
At Whitesprings I'm getting legendary items from non legendary ghouls all the time.
---
I have 3 on the ps4
---
Does it? Because there's not a single post about it in at least the last 6 hours. Should I have waited till the wee hours of the night like the other like-minded people as me?
---
I haven't gotten that backpack yet, and yeah, that bug definitely exists.
---
Yep, bottlecap glasses aren't too rare. Cool that you found a set though. Now all you need is a Nuka World outfit to go with them.
---
Lose tenderizer and go with lone wanderer. You've got plenty of damage buffs,  get some resistance.
---
Government control over an aspect of the economy is socialism (and a good thing). Fascism means supremacist (as in white-supremacist) government. 
---
Free market isn't capitalism as capitalism requires currency and free market can be achieved with barter. Neither are sustainable economic systems, though. 🤷 That's literally why inflation is a thing.
---
I hit it instead of potato crisps. It is done
---
Baam, fixed! Autocorrect never seizes to embarrass me. I should pay more attention and proofread. Lol
---
Ideally. But I'm not expecting it because of the server strain. Guilds and faction representation would take less effort and accomplish more.
---
No that's my personal limit I've had people tell me they have 75k 5mm and no bans I just don't know what number Bethesda decides will result in a ban
---
As an American, I'm actually kinda jealous you guys get all theirs weirder than normal encounters
---
Sounds like fun!
---
Anti-Scorched receiver adds a star but they're generally shite. I've no answers for the 5th star, though. It does seem rather daft.
---
While we’re at it, I’d like to able to choose light/sturdy/heavy armor. It’s fucking impossible to get 3* sturdy combat armor.
---
Woodchucker is a perk. I use it when farming, there's 6 piles on my route. Collected most like that.
---
And they continue to work on it diligently. Something new every tuesday almost. Along with fixes etc. This game will be on top in a year or few just like eso is now.
---
If you like fallout 4 you are going to like this game. I don't think there is a great deal of difference. A lot of bugs still exist (it's a big game/map) but for me, it's running better than ever.
---
Beth needs to see this post. Everyone try to upvote the shit out of it. Lots of good points on here.
---
I noticed fireproof and demolitions expert on there. Are you rocking an explosive gun? If so, max out demolitions, and lower gunsmith. I don't use any gunsmith and yes, I have to repair more, but it's worth it for other perks.
---
Thanks. I got bored with previous fallout games but that was mainly due to the lack of interaction with other players. I went ahead and ordered it off Amazon for $20. All games have their bugs but it does look fun and I think that it survived the bad reviews initially, looks like they are still working on it, and that it has a good playerbase still means it's worth a chance.
---
I had two cryolators one after each, almost identical. I know it's RNG but I don't buy quickly now.
---
Thats why they make him carry the drills and wood armo4
---
Tell my wife that. Couple punches and she screams she wants a divorce 😠, like Lisa please let me roleplay as a raider. Smh marriages.
---
is it max level, or is it lower level?
---
I just gifted my alt with a vampire's/explosive/25% AP 10mm pistol, which I modded with a hardened receiver, stinging mag, compensator and true barrel/grip, (true mods for hipfire accuracy, because aiming at a flying scorchbeast sucks) and noticed a HUGE difference between that and the instigating/faster fire/faster reload western revolver I was previously using as a backup ranged option.  The hipfire accuracy on a 10mm pistol with true mods is also outstanding.  A very tight area of fire.
---
I typically use VATS when trying to land a shot on a legendary enemy that's being beaten up by a player or two at the Whitespring, and the revolver would dramatically chunk down my AP.  I can get like 3-4 shots with the 10mm with the same AP expenditure, which adds up to way more damage per AP point used.  Being able to burn up a 15 round mag while staying in VATS the whole time is pretty remarkable.  I might try a powerful automatic receiver after leveling up a couple times for the guerrilla cards.  I use a sledgehammer 95% of the time, so burning up common 10mm ammo isn't a big issue.
---
Check your inventory, see if it hasn't been renamed as a duplicate of something else.
---
I play alone, but I find it definitely adds something to the game with mp. I hate survival though. It's always over too quick for me.
---
Well, I’m sure they could. I guess it depends on the price. I think I spent about 3000 atoms before I ever had to consider using cash, because of challenge rewards.
---
You'll never milk a moo-moo again. Also, forget Instigating melee weapons.
---
Yeah maybe it's still applied. I know the refrigeration is bugged, where it works with salt 2.
---
Well, on the upside they weigh nothing and will disappear on Monday.
---
sebas9176
---
Yeah, cause we need more people running circles around Whitesprings and Westec. 
---
We need more content, not more people.
---
That one specifically isn't duped, it doesn't need to be. It has a 100% learn chance when scrapped, so if you get one, you can scrap it and recraft it endlessly.
---
+karma
---
Then try Farcry 5, Peaches is her name.
---
I dont think so
---
I love this idea...but it's also terrible. 
---
If this was a single player game, being able to grind up and manufacture exact chosen legendary items would be awesome. 
---
In this game, where people farm/dupe insane numbers of items and there's an economy, this would trash that.
---
&gt; I'm not going to try and figure out how significant it is against any other specific rad-damage sources 
---
Barring rounding errors, it should be exactly the same ratio, due to how the DR/ER/RR calculation works. The only exception is when the damage is &gt;6.5x higher than the resistance, at which point you're taking the full damage and further drops in resistance have no further effect. Not going to happen with radiation vs PA.
---
The hidden PA rad reduction value is actually 15% per piece, or 90% total. Hazmats are 98%, IIRC.
---
Is this a bad time to ask for some wood?
---
The official word out of the mouth of Tod Howard is that the game has a great player base and it's making money.   
---
And we all know Tod Howard never lies.
---
Not on PS4, I'm on PC, but we're out there.
---
Flatwood's Monster counted for me when I took a picture of it the other night.
---
I'd like that, or an added cap sink, really anything that lets you narrow down what you're after.
---
I've been looking for a new combat shotgun, despite dozens of rolls I can can count on one hand all the shotguns i've seen.
---
But i have rolled at least 7 crossbows, that although kinda neat, are not what i'm looking for xD
---
In a world where perfect balance were possible maybe but people would be furious if an entire second set of perk cards were unlocked and you couldn't mix the two. If they created enough viable perk cards for a 2nd set, it would be way better to just add them to the existing cards.
---
also very similar to [blade runner 2049](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a0ozKJBBjc)
---
Cap limit is 1400 per day and you can't sell ammo to a NPC vendor bot.
---
FYI, I think most experienced players avoid trading because it is a pain in the ass.  We also don’t want to let you know what our build is and how we are armed.   Thus, nobody is pushing for this.
---
If the swap animation wasn't so long, be worth firing all the syringers in a row xD
---
I mean, I'm not gonna store anything in it. I just want it for decoration.
---
Scrapping only rewards mod plans.
---
Woodchucker plus one run through Sylvie &amp; Sons Logging Camp is like 400 wood scraps. 
---
And my camp is right near a river so I’ll also gather a ton of dirty water. 
---
Free easy XP.
---
Yeah it's a guess game right now.
---
About Camp plans, by now I'd use this: https://m.imgur.com/a/3ZhkLJl
---
It has been a huge help for me since someone posted it here. The only bad thing is finding out where to get some of those plans, but it surely has made my Camp building a lot easier.
---
What platform are you on, I can mod it up for you if you'd like. Xbone.
---
&gt; Fo76’s Engine is a modified creation engine.
---
Which is an updated version of the Gamebryo engine which, ironically, started its life as an MMO engine.
---
Good to know this game still isnt worth my time lmao will not be redownloading any time soon
---
Roof of West Tek has always had one. If anyone actually paid caps for those things...lol
---
I take toast **very** seriously.
---
this for me - the times I notice the quest is up, I'll check to see how many players are at Arktos and skip it after it looks like it's empty. I have yet to even attempt the quest
---
Now i like you :) honey butter on wheat?
---
I noticed on ps4 that even if you delete pictures from the gallery in game, they are stored in the capture gallery in the capture menu.
---
You can also back them up to USB if you like.
---
:) all kinds
---
That link is golden.
---
you have my sympathy lol
---
There have always been five stars on the card, although they used to be diamonds. Presumably they're for future content.
---
Didn't shotguns get nurfed?
---
Yeah, but its fun to shoot.
---
I'd even take choose category, random stars.
---
Oh God, you were one of those.  Do you know BRs were notorious trolls in that game?  I try to never prejudge someone but I did get attacked a lot for answering "No" to the question "BR?". Ahhh, Tibia.
---
Yes I second this. Mostly for my banker cause he doesnt have room for any combat perks, its weight reduction all the way.
---
You can shoot friendly ghouls with a gamma gun
---
lol, im suddenly realizing that I havent been getting daily challenges... I have never actively tried to do them, but I used to complete 2 or 3 a day accidentally. Now I realize why i havent been completing any lmao
---
Yeah, that's what I ment
---
In my more than 1k hours of playing I’ve only come across two servers where there were not only high legendary counts but also each and every dropped item matched the star rating of the creatures. This was simply incredible, when you see a three star legendary you know it’s going to drop a three star loot. Apparently this was a BUG, in both cases the servers were shut down immediately for ‘maintenance’. The servers are NOT supposed to be honest to their players...
---
Can't argue with that
---
How'd you get up there??
---
I recently picked the game back up after a reprieve, today's the first time in my first week back that I am focusing on making caps. I thought I'd been up to speed on all the changes but I guess I missed a few.
---
Might I get an invite? My friends all begged me to get this game and never play.
---
Been getting some great explosive drops in the wild. The purveyor, there was a couple but they were on the wrong guns
---
I've come across a few pairs of them. I think I even have one for sale at my camp. They're definitely not common though.
---
I can't even enter a nuked zone without crashing. They need to reduce player count.
---
Think I seen the combat Bos plan for 750 each at one of the stations north. Looks expensive to me. I'd just search player venders
---
I bought them. They look much better than the default ones.
---
I've heard 1%, although not with any numerical evidence. If I tag a scorchbeast outside effective shotgun range then it doesn't drop loot for me, but I couldn't attach a number to that.
---
A 5% cap would be seriously harsh if you were in a 10-man SBQ fight with bloodied players. Even 1% is quite a lot of hits on a queen if you're not bloodied.
---
playing in an group 90% of the time
---
See, I'm dying to use a rifle. I was aiming for an old school plague doctor build instead of a Heavy/Medic. But that seems more viable... I'll sleep on it haha
---
Do you have similar issues with other online games? Do you run AV and or malware software? I'm assuming you run 76 in full screen. Have you tweaked the .ini file and or run mods? Sorry for all the questions,  just trying to eliminate possibilities. This last one I hate but, have you tried uninstalling, rebooting then reinstalling 76? To me this is a last resort as sometimes updates tweak things they shouldn't. Seen it in 2 other online games before.
---
Joining your server
---
Could u make me the Bos bro? I am rocking the light combat armour only
---
Ill give it a shot. I did this at Wade Airport but didn't get credit there.
---
Don't overlook scrapping to learn mod plans. Invest in SuperDupper to improve yield counts. Build the piece with the least materials (i.e. - Arms) to have a chance to learn the mod plan for all when scrapping.
---
Apparently ‘No loot’ is also on the loot table as well as ‘drill’ and ‘syringer’.
---
You can jump thru the holes in the ceiling with marsupial...
---
Not really...if ur on the map for a while and can check back to grab ammo every so often , it adds up. But i could craft 3x the amount of ammo in the same amount of time that thing takes to make 200 rounds
---
Should still able to be bought and used. I bought them and was able to use them on both casual and the atomic shop tactical op suit.
---
Or Wade airport and you don't have to own it
---
imo 100 for weapon category + 2 stars and 200 for weapon category + 3 stars
---
 I once found two gnomes in a baby carriage, one wearing fashionable sunglasses and the other wearing cap glasses. Even took a picture for a loading screen.
---
Insta melee works. I use it all the time and always had plague walker. You can milk brahmin too, but they run away after.
---
Would be the best option for ANY event imo.
---
But for those event which you hang loose without 4+ other teammates/players a server wide notice should be mandatory
---
Don’t let it get you down man. Life is hard in West Virginia.
---
You can jump on the shopping displays from the boxes in the corner. Then you can sprint-jump slightly to the side of the balcony. You'll get stuck between balcony and those diagonal planks going across from the door. And with a little bit of luck you will be able to wiggle your way up. Just did it.
---
Hay man! Sadly I haven’t played in a long time, maybe in the future! (I play on PC)
---
You have saved humanity and are now hereby  dubbed the Breaker of Pastry Chains. We’ll be OK, you can rest now...
---
What’s stopping you putting it in your stash? It’s likely someone will come along that’ll want it. I’ve recently just been buying cheap PA parts to complete the “scrap PA parts” challenge
---
Bayonets on everything!
---
Ah, good to know!
---
Thanks for this post.  Enjoyable read of the comments!
---
Fasnacht was for me by far the best expierience in fallout 76 as for event - level 2 up to 100+ thrown together hunting for plans/mask, the fun event theme, the friendly dropping/trading afterwards.
---
Hope will see it again next year. Or something similar for Halloween.
---
His intelligence is so low he failed his awareness check a few times. Thus failing to realize he's been dead for a while.
---
One of my friend was an escort for a Japanese exchange class and wherever they went to Vancouver (we live in western Canada) they would have trouble pronouncing the cities name since Japanese doesn't have any "V" sounds in it.
---
It would come out as Bancouba.
---
Oh, I can. On the frame its 10 lbs. All the parts loose is like 60 or 70lbs? I just don't have that much space. I really just want it gone, but can't seem to just throw it away. It's a wastelander-hoarder thing.
---
Save up for the plan and make your own. That's the general rule for unlocking mods for rare weapons. Handmade and lever rifles aren't common either.
---
Treasure maps drop rare weapons but I'm not absolutely sure whether gauss rifles are on that list. Safes and boss monsters also have a chance.
---
The cap pool means now you can finally sell higher-value items like mutation serums to the vendors :)
---
I sell lvl 50 legs with shocks already attached. I've sold like 5 already. They weigh a lot!!
---
&gt; Someone with more experience in fallout modding would probably know how to dump values programmatically. 
---
xEdit Scripts. The commonly used ones are very accessible and well-documented. To be clear, I am not a mod author. I am simply another humble devotee of learning.
---
I think it's still bugged
---
Forgot, is Task Manager set to always on top?
---
😂
---
Yes it could be good. But we need npc’s. Miss having fights with raiders who swore at you. Tougher enemies like squatchbitch that kick the crap out you and keep coming.   :)
---
...Kind of a drill inspector...?
---
*should write more bubblegum jokes*
---
Whatever they do, they should do it so that the BEST weapons and armour available in the game, are available to everyone without the need of extreme amounts of RNG luck.
---
I stopped playing for a while and just came back. This game is so fun again.  Loving the new content and now that its not insanely buggy I'm loving the new content. Also got my first tse from the purveyor today and it was for the class I use!
---
I had one and I accidentally ate it
---
As a BoS player I don't think we are good or bad. 
---
I think the faction has chosen a mission that will put it at odds with people who have different ideas. The long term goal of the Brotherhood is extremely noble and essential to preserve any semblance of a high tech free humanity in the long run but the nature of the wasteland means alot of situations are going to be pretty harsh for people involved in interactions with the faction
---
Totally doesn't excuse players being dicks though.
---
Just remember the first encounter with the BoS was a mission where they send you to a radioactive hell bunker with no expectations of your return. They are not nice people to outsiders, and even fight among themselves quite often over the mission.
---
Trade for it in the reddit market
---
If you're in a server w a team it's worth it that way they can back you up.  It's fun and imo pumps out ammo quick. Free ammo being made while you go do whatever
---
Player vending killed legendary weapons hunt for me. What’s the point if grinding stupid boring events, when I can server switch couple of times and get an awesome 3star item for ~2k caps? Exact item I’m looking for?
---
Same for the Purveyor - screw this lottery, I’m dead tired of Whitesprings runs, wtf, I’m not a hamster to endlessly grind this wheel. 
---
The only things I do now are: login, sell water from purifiers and do a couple of Westec runs which gets me ~1k caps each (all these endless assault &amp; laser rifles). Logout until next day. 
---
There is simple NOTHING to do anymore.
---
It really is. I can't stop coming back to check it now and then.
---
We should have a sticky megathread with all the useful stuff like this, it's crazy that people take so much time and effort to make things easier for everyone but end up being underused.
---
Mines pretty sweet.
---
For now, in my humble and casually knowledgeable opinion, the Heavy Medic is the most viable for survivability. I am slowly working my way toward non-PA and unarmed (got a \*\*\* deathclaw gauntlet I'm itching to use) but I need about 20 more levels worth of perk cards to make it viable).
---
Everything would be picked clean all the time. Dungeon/legendary spawn campers would be even more prevalent. Events would be packed but possibly too packed (could you imagine 50 people at fastnacht). I wouldn't mind this if events and some indoor locations were instanced or maybe after private custom servers come along and we can set the population cap ourselves. As is though I'd rather they lower the cap to 10 people per server because it seems like the best servers I've been on had barely anyone on them.... unless I was shopping then it was fun when there were a pile of vendors to choose from.
---
Yea fuck stealth their mentality is ‘’COME AT ME BRO!’’
---
Does it bother you that people call The Whitespring “Whitesprings?”
---
i think I have herd mentality in my vending machine left for 350.  wont be on for another half hour though.
---
To answer your question on agility, if you have 30 agility or even around like 25, you should have no trouble sneaking around with sturdy/heavy armor. I run a 15 agility build with 4 pieces unyielding (one of which as agility as an effect) and I can effectively sneak right in front of scorchbeats without the Sneak Perk. I’d say the only better sneaking related perk that’s worth it in the agility tree is Escape Artist
---
Yeah but how many years ago was that.
---
If you accept a trade your giving up the right to privacy anyway, what’s the point in only hiding the other 2 stars? It’s just a way for people to try and scam.
---
That's alright, just message me when you get back on.
---
Yeah that's cool. PSN molehands135
---
Protect your pets better. Do you leave a chicken outside to fight a fox?? No, you put it in a coop. Leave heavy hitters outside to fight pen up the others.
---
ok
---
God tier pie

Tesla is a pretty solid weapon for this, although in all reality you could use any weapon lol, seeing as basically all weapons use some sort of perk, but Tesla’s would allow you to hit lots of enemies at the same time.
---
Oh I know man, I’m just being honest
---
lol do Australians really speak English tho..?..
---
 I'm talking to you Bailey 😂
---
I got a 3* Ghoul Slayer's shovel the other night. I'm still not speaking to Mmurrgh.
---
On Xbox and I need a camera, anyone know of locations? Anyone selling quest items for the nukashine or scout badges?
---
I know what you mean about the hoarder part, I just can’t help but keep hold of everything! I wish we could keep names on the PA frames, I’d gladly sell sets of X-01
---
Quick and simple - easy repeat.
---
1. get a government supply drop.
---
2. on the way to the drop - kill what you have to and retain ALL of the gear(also from liberating and looting the relay station)
---
3.  walk(don't fast travel) to the nearest city. Kill all you meet and keep gear.
---
4. once you have around 700 to 800 pounds of gear, head to train station.
---
5. sell everything. You will quickly reach your 1400 cap limit. 
---
6. when you are close to your end for that play session, go kill lots and load down with gear again.
---
7. log out at train station.
---
8. log in 20 hours later - sell to your 1400 cap limit.
---
9. repeat.
---
I found mine at Freddy’s House of Fear
---
Not that kind of ammo. 100k rare items or ammo. 
---
Mine was 100k ultracite
---
Have you ever heard of the recipes dropping from treasure map caches?  That's another rumor I've heard.
---
I got all 5 server hopping for an hour killing gulpers at the gulper lagoon then fast traveling to  dyer chemical.
---
So I was doing this today and had the same result. Got the quest randomly with the dna, but couldn’t do anything else. It’s stupid it triggers when you kill a SB but doesn’t tell you the rest. Fortunately for me, just getting the paper was enough to fix everything. Didn’t need more DNA, just got the power on
---
But i don't have the plan to make a chiken coop yet 😢
---
lmao no I wasn't one of those. I did go around asking "BR?" when a kid and didn't understand English, though.  
---
Educated BRs feel ashamed of the BRBR trolls - thing is, sometime in the 2000s, we suddenly had /**very cheap**/ country-wide internet access ("digital inclusion to all" government policy - one of the few that actually worked lol), if you didn't have a computer, you'd go to a cyber cafe and spend like 30 cents of a dollar (1 Real) to use the computer for a hour. Even in the poorest states, you could still find a lan house (place with consoles/PCs pay-to-play) in your neighborhood.  
---
Being inclusive is good, obviously, but it led to lot of uneducated people having uncontrolled access to the internet and acting stupid in the country's behalf. Brazil's full of stupid people, but that's because we just started caring about educating our kids. To illustrate: I get kinda shocked when I see an intelligent 35+ man because almost everyone at that age over here is uneducated and ignorant due to lack of education.
---
How can i join a raider faction?
---
I don't know if this is true, but I have read here that if you sign out and then sign back in within about 30 minutes your pet should respawn.
---
I’ve gotten two of them one was at hemlock holes and I can’t remember where the other one was
---
I have electrically charged on Xbox. I will be online at 8 p.m. Eastern Standard Time
---
Yeah have an instigating +50 limb damage lvl 35 up for sale
---
Unfortunately heavy weapon vats costs are over the roof for continuous fire
---
I took it of and West Tek Muties almost ripped my butt off.So i say its vital to have it even with unyilding.
---
I don't even bother going when I see it's up. Most people don't seem to know what they're doing and it just ends in failure anyways.
---
Well it had to do mostly with the BoS demanding resources from the Responders who barely had enough as it is. As well as poaching talent from them to join the BoS.  Combine that with the fact the region before the Great War was facing a heavy military occupation due to worker strikes because of all the automation. And the Free State are anti government people so they wouldn't want anything to do with either group.
---
Nice
---
It’s a visual effect probably caused by server lag. My bloodied fire axe got a twin when I pulled it from my stash but I couldn’t use it. When I logged off and back in it was gone.
---
Hey if you’re on PC I have a max level Instigating Pipe Revolver with 50% stronger criticals I got from the purveyor. For free
---
Shielded? Because you can purchase resistance and another one that I can't think of the name of. But I haven't seen shielded
---
 I'm glad to hear it! Sounds like I had the worst luck with it! Rad worms and pustules, you know how it is.
---
Long gone
---
Thank you for your reply
---
Sorry i  was away when you messaged me.
---
It'll be nice when/if they ever bring private servers into the mix. No need to fill up slots on a public server if you're just doing runs for items.
---
Fasnacht was great, I lost count how many times I ran that event. Everybody wanted those rare masks and the low drop rate meant everybody kept coming back.
---
Alright, how much are you willing to sell it for?
---
I tried that. if I had been thinking I could have closed application before it died. I was loading in. 😑 Lag and loading killed my last one too.
---
I flogged my ass
---
You could always leave it standing inside the vendor area of Whitesprings for someone or drop downstairs at garrahan for a level 25 player.
---
Play it. If ur a fallout fan you’ll like it.
---
I've found quite a few pairs of cappy sunnies
---
Aww too bad. I'm finally getting the hang of fallout 76. I had a hard time starting off. Also wouldnt be able to see your camp anyway. I play on xbox.
---
I have a bloodied build, and my sister runs a vampire heavy weapon setup, we both got to the same SBQ fight. 99% of the time, we both get loot. Occasionally(1 fight in 20?), I don't get loot. I don't THINK she ever misses out now.
---
My ass is surely a thunderbox
---
This is simple In theory but each wood source counts as 1 regardless of the amount you get , I’m still short about 2000 pieces I’m over level 200 just some challenges are really punishing
---
I've heard that before but I've been doing treasure maps from BETA and the only rare plans I've received were for Power Armor. iirc it was a Plan: T45 Helmet. I don't think I've received anything like that for months so could be bad RNG or maybe the tables changed?
---
7600 wood doesnt take too long, especially if you use its perk card that allows you to gather twice as much.
---
The one that will take you a while 'Explore Appalachia for 7600 hours.'
---
Isn't there a port-a-diner somewhere that drops the pie 100% of the time?
---
300 caps
---
Ok sounds good👌🏼
---
Bummer
---
look up reddit post on soloing line the sand  - 2 to 3 scorch beasts spawn - then looting the fort is almost risk free
---
Its a male Brahmin so its fathersmilk much more proteins.
---
Nope, I didn't play at the time because I was dissapointed in how the game came out and came back after the big update, so far I've been enjoying it more. 
---
Also, I was a dumb dumb and never visited west tek because I thought Bivouac was the facility, only to travel there and discover an entire new area I'd never visited. 
---
I did finally see my first suicider.
---
I am part of a sub responders/brotherhood group, formed from the ashes of the battle at Huntersville, where the brotherhood and responders put aside their differences for one common goal, but neather one or the other, but more!

 Becouse we just want to help build a better "game"/ world. The drive to help like the responders and the power to stand up and fight the waistland like the brotherhood.

If anyone ever needs help be it fixing your equipment, needing materials or help with events or missions, we are here for you!
---
 Yup. It's cheaper than Speed Demon from my point of view. That may change and the 2 points could be good, but now, as I walk a lot I'll keep it.
---
 If Twisted affected my gun accuracy to any noticeable amount, I would run Class Freak and pull Specials, maybe. As it does not I'm good for now.
---
one for each of your personalities? 😂😎
---
Yeah lol, also it's a national meme (*just drunk bar-table fun ofc, no one really cares*) to mock how asians replace our "R" for "L" here in são paulo. It doesn't help that we have a very famous national kid's character (Cebolinha from Turma da Mônica) that also replaces the "R" for "L"s.  
---
Btw, I think the brazillian accent is a "fad" among americans in the BJJ scenario, but honestly we feel very stupid with our accents ahah, it just doesnt match the english language.
---
.... And his name was *Carl*
---
No one ever realizes anything here; it’s mostly just “I want this I want that, why can’t Bethesda do it if other game studios can?”
---
I have over 600 hours played on a single character and I was missing one table set. Couldn't for the life of me figure out which one it was, but it was the one I wanted for my camp.
---
This link saved me. It really is the best.
---
Switched to Wi-Fi for the luls.. Man i can see how the box players are having a bad time. Bethesda should fix my isp tho... Its really thier fault with no human npcs.... Also is this game still good??
---
Who knows?  I wish I could find some definitive info on this tho.  I really don't want to pay the enclave for eagle eyes. ☹️
---
It absolutely needs a buff to be close to worth it.
---
Yep, get my scrip, get my caps and then just wander around...or log off.
---
Though I haven't found anything at player vendors to buy other than 1/2* stuff to experiment with.  Maybe I should server hop more, lol.
---
I mean I just took the time to launch a nuke and do an SBQ....my reward from the Queen?  A 1* AA sledgehammer and then a 2* piece of combat armor from the event...what's the point.
---
now it's magic is yours.
---
I've been living in the exact place of number 4 for six months. Were you that guy who stopped by asking how structurally sound my base was and when I would be away? 
---
( you might want to mention whenever you build there you'll be attacked whenever you spawn so extra turrets facing the tents is a good idea)
---
I found one in the observatory last week.
---
[The absolutely best kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxcnkT8984c), mate.
---
lol ya I noticed walked in and you were sleeping so I slowly crept out haha . I’ll be back on in an hour or so . I saw In the vending machine jumpsuits but not BOS . U have that one on you?
---
AFAIK, it’s random.
---
My deathclaw died today too. Honestly I would be ok with all the pet problems if we could use a few stimpacks to fix them, like repairing a turret.
---
I just made a suggestion post about it.
---
Yes. I got a total of 3 since I started. One from a safe, and the two I bought, well one, I got both at WS one was at the free state vendor I believe and the other was  in a doggy bag that someone gave after they bought an extra one from the one the newer vendors.
---
YES. I’ve always thought this
---
I'm happy to help. That insight into how one of those wiki's was put together is appreciated.
---
Someone else in this thread told me they took a look at the game files somewhat recently and confirmed the majority of my tests are a single point higher than the game data tells. I'm trying to figure out how this happened, but have no good theory yet. Apparently my Minigun test is too high though. I suspect action point drain waiting for the weapon to spin up may have added extra cost.
---
Also, thanks for the 'gift'.
---
&gt; Follows it up with using the phrase “a Japanese”.
---
lol  got me - looks like I've been here too long; the weird English phrasing is rubbing off !
---
Is that still a thing? Ban because of certain amount of rare ammo? I believe I have more than 20k of ultracite .50 cal ammo in my stash now. I just keep crafting some each time I do an SBQ event, and quickly had a lot of surplus.
---
Cool I'll check and see
---
Short answer: after nuke expires it resets with robots. Itll reset normally when more people show up and reset the area.
---
I have gotten almost exclusively garbage from the purveyor.
---
Yes i had it on me lol but thats fine. Ill be here.
---
I don’t want more people, it’s the god damn apocalypse.
---
It is purely an asthetic thing.  There is no extra benefit.
---
I love the PVP game and that's where it stays on the PVP server. If I play adventure I help low level players all I can. In fact a few weeks ago I dropped some weapons and other gear for a level 10 guy near Flatwoods. Jumped servers and realised I'd also dropped himd a 3* max AAE handmade...I cried a bit but I bet it made his day. I justhpoe he was switched on enough to know what it was worth.
---
I’m more concerned with the other thing. One would say it’s pulling me apart.
---
I would say so, yes. However, someone has brought to my attention that certain other attachments can decrease AP costs in addition to auto receivers, sights, and magazines. Apparently 'Aligned' barrels and grips lower AP costs too. It seems much more worthwhile to see how much variety a weapon has in attachments before writing it off as a poor Vats weapon.
---
"We love our Asian boys and girls*"  "...the japs cleaned the stadium"
---
Apparently you don't. That's like calling a black person a nig.
---
Them damn Australians and they're upside down houses are up to something with thems rice cookers
---
I half expected the same to happen to me tbh. It is just the worst tho! I’m just primarily a single player gamer, but I LOVE the Fallout series, so here I am. Luckily the majority of the community is wonderful, but the workshop situation sucks. I never take pacifist off because I don’t do PvP, but I had some nitwit chick following me once using the fact that I had a workshop to keep trying to kill me long after she initiated and got it from me. (Btw I’m not trying to be sexist either. I’m a girl. She was just a heifer!)
---
Good luck. Keep trying. Even if it doesn’t show just come back and try again.  I’ve been told things that should exist and have had them show up before.
---
I didn't even know this game was popular in Japan until I saw like 20 users on the same server with different variations of Japanese names lol
---
Did you get all the flux, high rad fluids, masses and blood? Serious cash right there.
---
Sounds good
---
They're the only ammo that works in weapons with Ultracite receivers. You can craft them, not sure if you have to find a plan first.
---
Considering my username unintentionally sounds somewhat Japanese, I am going to get a lot of folks assuming as much now.
---
Fireproof perk
---
I honestly don't get what you are saying ahahha. Is "jap" a bad word in english? "Japa" is an abbreviation to Japanese in portuguese, so I don't see any problem with it.
---
If that is the case, maybe you shouldn't be so quick with your assumptions :p
---
increase in damage, bonus damage to scorch beats and scorched. you can only craft them or get them from other players.
---
to craft them you must know the receiver plan for a compatible gun
---
I got one too.
---
Waiting to be able to actually display it in all it's glory.
---
My advice from hunting would be to just suck it up and by Speed Demon or Marsupial first.
---
You can generally always sell one or both of those to players. Worst case scenario you can make them (don't forget Super Duper) and sell them to vendors. Since the vendors don't have the separate 200 cap pool like they used to ...... down some Grape Mentats and sell the ones you made for &gt; 400.
---
1400 caps per day plus at least that from player vending adds up quick.
---
It's a nice coat tho.  Comfy.
---
Just tried again and sure enough the same thing happened. 😩
---
Which platform?
---
I was so pumped when I got my first perfectly preserved pie, and flabbergasted when it happened again a month later... but then I was let down when I heard you can find them on the roof at Westek. Guess my pies aren't as rare as I thought. :(
---
Also for the troubles make it 4k
---
Cool thanks.
---
Exactly- certainly there is a lot of English education in Japan, but the number of functional speakers you're likely to meet is tiny. 
---
It's a pretty common topic of conversation about the Olympics: people are worried that the large number of tourists will have a hard time getting around, have misunderstandings at cash-only restaurants, etc. Many Taxis are installing touchpanel translation devices (incidentally, there is a new type of custom-made cab being rolled out built to accommodate larger-size passengers), and convenience stores and fast food joints in touristy areas are starting to hire quite a few foreign staff.
---
I play with all metal armor( splatter paint for the win) non bloodied, all rise and grognacks for power armor and i have many a DC gauntlet for any occasion. Basicaly speaking... if i move and use potions things explode in piles of goooooo-rific fun. The only 2 guns I have kept since I found them are a lvl 45 furious 1*handmade with a auto receiver and a 10 mm pistol with explosive that i put a auto receiver on. These 2 guns have both shared their greatness and shown me that ... sometimes less is more. I dont have a single gun perk ever  loaded and having those 2 guns has made my hulf smash build viable for 75ish levels. Furious is highly recommended by me. Explosive is nice on the 10mm because it doea NOOOOO damage basicaly but i use it to tage enemies in large groups. Hope that helps
---
Gamertag: sleepy4792
---
Sweet ! thnx
---
Because you guys ask for ridiculous nonsense on top of this like having your ‘pet’ follow you around the map - yeah that won’t add to the performance issue that already exists with this game when every idiot has a pet following them into an event.
---
All
---
That’s awesome! I’m glad you did that. It’s certainly good to know!
---
No problem
---
I forgot pacifist. 😅 Opened us both to pvp.
---
i restarted my ps and it worked after that
---
Yeah, I have those already.  Eagle Eyes is the last recipe I really want and don't have.  I will probably end up buying from the enclave but if it can be obtained as a drop, I'd much rather do that.
---
Tried to finally do this a few times over the last week and yeah it’s frustrating. I’d like to actually complete it myself rather than just randomly finding the dome open.
---
Yes, fascism is a form of socialism, just like Communism.  That's why National Socialists were fascist.  They believed govt should direct privately owned business.  Under communist regimes, govt owned and ran all business.  Different sides of the same socialist coin, but it buys the same thing: mass death and poverty.
---
Racial supremacy is a different metric, but it also existed strongly under both fascist and communist governments.  Both engaged in mass liquidation targeting populations of minority races.
---
I have used ultracite ammo and personally I don't think it's worth the amount of effort to gather the supplies to make them. I don't find the damage all that impressive.
---
Kudos to you sir for not attacking people because they were English, lol. :)
---
The director of 2049 was inspired by a dust storm in Sydney for this scene, probably the same storm haha
---
Okay, I’m sorry, that’s hilarious. 
---
It’s why I always do my vendor runs in Power Armor. Plus I can haul a lot more loot that way. 
---
I’m envisioning you plummeting to your doom screaming, “I just wanted to spend my moneeeeeeeeeeeeeyyyyyyy.......”
---
i had the same thing last night, legendaries everywhere
---
jackoffdawolf69 sells that plan for 80 caps with all the other ~~crap~~ gold she finds on the ground
---
I've seen a ton of frames for sale lately (50 to 1k caps) but no actual pa.
---
I think it adds flavor to the game personally, but to each their own. BoS has historically been assholes. FO3 was the exception, not the rule.
---
Just server hop till you find someone close to lvl 35. Take it out. Emote gift. Back away slowly.
---
Ok, so you'll be on in an hour right?
---
See a lot of Japanese players on when playing late in Australia. Never tried speaking, but keep a couple of phrases handy. 
---
Konichiwa=Hello
---
Sayonara=Goodbye
---
Domo Arigato or just Domo=Thank You
---
Baka=Idiot/Fool
---
No, they were fascist because they were Nationalist (which is national supremacy, such as the Nationalist regime of the Third Reich). Communism has literally nothing whatever to do with Fascism.
---
I like to fast travel to a better game.
---
I have seriously thought about this. I probably will end up doing that. How do you drop PA so someone else can pick it up? In a bag?
---
I'm sorry. Sometimes when you fast travel to mine it loads you in the air. I got goat legs and still break an ankle.
---
Spend all those stimpak and thousands of rounds and if lucky get rewarded a drill or wood piece... yeah kinda really strange that nobody showed up to fight the imposter sheepsquatch... right?
---
Ok I'll send the request
---
fresh out of the vault? I do not know what you did in there for 25 years but I trained to use weapons and power armors.
---
I started it about 3 months ago, so far we have a majority of ps4 members, but still pretty good on pc and xbox too, im actually looking for good people willing to moderate and be the community leaders for more pc and xbox members.
---
lemme know when you’re on
---
if you need metal or leather armor, or a lvl 5/10 gun, I would be more than happy to make you whatever you need. :)
---
What level are you? Did you check under your data: main and side quests? Which did you just complete?
---
They do the same damage as a "hardened" receiver variant, except they also deal even more damage against scorched (and unlike the scorched killer receiver, does not suffer a damage penalty against anything else). This is all right for most weapons, but some like the gauss rifle or crossbow that don't have hardened receivers can only reach that high damage by making ultracite receivers
---
Economically fascism is all over the place depends on where and even when you check. So dunno what you are talking about, BoS are a fascistic political structure only thing being is that they don't form a state.
---
I'll check when I get on ppl keep buying stuff for 20, 000 caps at a time and I'm forced to close the store lol.
---
There's also a free one on the roof of Wes-Tech. You'll need marsupial or a jet pack to get to it though
---
Imperialistic Bigots... That's nothing like the Brotherhood!                              /s
---
Yes I've been having issues as well.
---
Yup I have a pair I keep on my character when I’m manning the shop/out of gas mask
---
The community is very friendly for the most part and the content is still rolling out with every DLC, and most of the new content has been really good as well.
---
$20 is a great price for it, as far as performance goes there's still bugs but they fixed a lot of issues, including one I had that made the game literally unplayable even on low graphics but now I can play in ultra, depends what rig you're on really. 
---
I say get it if you're truly a fan of the universe and world building, it's not New Vegas and there's no human NPCs but it's still fun all the same and I've yet to meet any bad players.
---
Sounds like a plan.  👍
---
Come on if an Int 1 character can use it why not the scorched? I mean they are pretty intelligent, having mastered the art of shooting from cover.
---
As for my time in the vault, I spent 24 years in a sugar-bomb induced coma. Best $20 I ever made.
---
Yeah, they used to be things that you could complete throughout normal gameplay like killing a specific creature or finishing an event. Then they started busting out the cancer like crafting 25 alcoholic beverages (seems like lately it's only been 10), doing something ridiculous with a specific outfit with a rarely spawning creature near you, or taking a picture of somebody doing something ridiculous wearing a specific outfit with a rarely spawning creature near them under rare weather conditions. If anybody finished these camera challenges on accident without knowing about them, I don't know what to promise because I'm too confident that it never happened
---
Yeah, I bought “resort planters” that gave me three dead plants, a plant I already had with regular plant plans, and a stack of empty pots. Had I known I wasn’t getting a planter that had the resort flowers in them, I never would have bought them. I’m still mad about this.
---
uh oh, I'm at that part of the quest too.  Hope its not totally fucked.
---
How come you didn’t max out your slugger perks to get the most out of melee? I’ve got all those maxed out along with bloody mess and twisted muscles, now my two handed melee weapons are doing close to 300 damage.
---
get the perk to search for chems - rad away and rad x are in almost every successful search. Also great way to build a supply  of stims.
---
Flair checks out
---
1k caps? They’re so easy to find though!
---
I’m level 70. I just finished the tadpole quest line. I still haven’t finished Overseer’s Mission because when it’s active I have no location indicator, don’t know if that’s a glitch or not.
---
Yes, please! I’m not a visualizer..
---
They’re the ones that are retiring
---
Fun fact: a perfectly preserved pie spawns ontop of west tek on the platform above the paintings.
---
Tactical crayon paint, adds crayon boxes like ammo packs to the Maine armor, with a face paint that has wax splotches and the mouth
---
They do more damage against scorchbeasts and scorched enemies but the only way to get the ammo to work for your gun you need to have the prime receiver mod for it and I think it does more damage than the other receivers if I'm not mistaken but the only way to craft the bullets is by using stable flux that you can only get in a blast zones from the nukes
---
 i leave spoiled meet, toilet paper and the insulted paper in paper bags on peoples door step who only sell common crap or stuff for stupid high in their vending machines 😅
---
and mods they are the worst "left arm"
---
Yea we need them to release plans for these or at least make them enclave event rewards
---
You can now quit the game
---
look at a map online of all locations.  go to any you havent been to. :)
---
This was already implemented in Sim Settlements IIRC, fo76 should just incorporate some mods from the community and give the guys some kind of credit/reward. Using the pipboy without the "icons on armor/weapon/whatever" mod is such a pain, it just feels like it should be part of the game.
---
"What happened to you?"
---
"New guy"
---
LOL ok i'm in.... hell i'll shoot at anything anyways
---
yeah, thats how most sidequests start.  Also I look up locations online on the wiki and quests will be linked to the location that will show how to start them. :)
---
I'm assuming the many bugs for FO76 will be constantly looked at and fixed along the way but is there a timeline on the really common ones? I.e. (I'm playing on PS4)
---
1. Having to exit out of crafting in build mode (CAMP) to properly build an object.
---
2. Spawning inside of built components inside your own or somebody else' CAMP.
---
3. There are many areas in the game where your character is permanently stuck and you need to respawn in another location or log back into the game. 
---
4. Being in a group yet not being able to see your team in the bottom left corner.
---
5. Not being able to invite friend to group "because they are already in your team" but aren't.
---
6. Not being able to build walls in CAMP because they are intersecting with another object but are not.
---
7. In many cases clicking on the "search" option for animals or contains yields no results and there is quite the delay before an item will spawn and a prompt given.
---
8. Mining or looting doesn't always appear to work. Click on a mine or loot an item and it doesn't place the item in your inventory. 
---
9. Random freezing of game (while selecting item in inventory) and having to quit and log back in.
---
These are a few of the really common issues I've been encountered so far during the game. The one's that I can think of anyway. 
---
Also, I'm not super great with Reddit so I wasn't sure if this was the correct place to post this or not. My apologies if it wasn't the correct place.
---
Really enjoying the game so far save for the bugs and glitches.
---
Would be a good motivator for me to do more Enclave events
---
I don't know anymore. I use the missile launcher on a regular basis and noticed some massive inconsistencies with it. On laggy servers, it will perform two "ticks" of damage, one that just takes hp and another with an explosion that takes hp again. This happens mostly against scorchbeasts for me. I've also managed to kill myself in one hit when a missile clipped or lagged on to me despite having more HP than the indicated damage of the missile. There's the whole problem of two shot missile launchers only gaining 1 extra point of damage in the pip boy, same with the unique bunker buster. Even today I tried shooting a missile at my feet with 250 DR. I took off demolition expert, so it was down to like 195 damage or something. I took 200+ damage from shooting it at my feet.

I skipped the flux for that run, I was definitely looking for HRF. I've got a ton of hardened masses and quite a few glowing masses, always lacking in HRF though :-/

The spiders are big enough there, I dont think there is much of a difference

YOU HAD ONE JOB
---
Fo1 brotherhood was just like fo3 brotherhood
---
Is the length of time in service what makes you a legendary, like ranks in the Army? I think a legendary is someone much more powerful than a regular enemy type. You can be a legendary super mutant day 1 on the job. His explosions do more damage, that’s why he’s a legendary
---
No thanks. I already feel like there are too many people in the world. It doesn't feel like a desolate world anymore. There are people everywhere.
---
Ooooh I need to find siren. never knew it existed.
---
does anyone know if it disappears if your character dies?  just curious.
---
God NO this is the wasteland not modern times people are suppose to be sparse and uncommon.
---
When I played the game I did feel like I was playing a "multiplayer solo game" 95% of the time. I guess 50-60 players would be enough to make this feeling go away.
---
In my opinion, what keeps this game going is its community. I don't play a lot because there's no active community from my country in game, but I love to watch the subreddit. Beth should think very carefully about how much limit is necessary to community interaction.
---
i always find it weird when I am sleeping at a camp and all of a sudden I get fall damage bc the camp disappears.  :p
---
I remember the first time I did WhiteSprings. It was during the beta, it wasn't even nuked and I must've been like 15 or so (I actively avoid players so they don't ruin the experience for me) I got so many legendaries I couldn't count. I died so many times, all my armor was broken but I didn't care, as long as I got that legendary in my pocket before I went down I was happy. It didn't even matter that the good ones I couldn't use and the ones that were my level were garbage. Needless to say I made my 200c that day. Lol
---
wow. that's breathtaking.
---
No that wasnt me, But in my expert opinion it sounds like that guy want to blow it up
---
I appreciate it! Would you mind giving me a link to a good site?
---
Sell that DCG fast. As of next week everyone will have one.
---
Also, get out of sneak. I always look when someone is purchasing, but sometimes no one appears. Last night I was at a vendor, someone was in sneak and wasn't showing.
---
for the map?
---
load your stash with all the 'junk' you need - then the 'junk' you gather playing - bulk it and sell it. Glass, Cork, Asbestos, Fertilizer, you need little of these in stash and bulk sell for a tidy sum.
---
Yeah
---
I have an issue where I can’t play a fallout game without joining the brotherhood of steel. I don’t even agree with them all the time... they’re.. just.. soo... fucking.. cool looking.
---
The real mvp is the person who was able to place those power conduits on the ground without them all snapping together.. I swear they are super magnetized or something, such a pain in the ass.
---
Anyone else pissed about “wind instruments” only giving a tuba, and nothing else?
---
https://fo76map.com/
---
interactive map
---
from there I find a location I want to visit and do a search on the 76 wiki -- if someone filled the location's info out, it should have a lot of info (notable loot, quests, etc)
---
agreed........should have always been this.....
---
If your needing one go to the moth man museum statue and keep server hopeong until one shows there I've been successful I'm finding one there multiple times
---
More stupid suggestions
---
Have you completed the main quests, launched a nuke?
---
In response to that since I was talking about me, I never asked to have one follow you around. Just an option for a camp pet. Like maybe the frog in a jar but walks around and can only have one cosmetic pet at a time at camp.
---
I agree with the following around the map. That would hit performance tremendously and isn't worth it but camp is a different story. 
---
We can already have tameable pets so it's already configured into performance so maybe either a tameable OR cosmetic pet at any one time. There would actually be less of a performance hit with a cosmetic only pet because the game wouldn't need to bother with attack or defense or anything other than just walking around oblivious to the world.
---
Are you fucking... it's an infinite crafting loop that can be automated and abused for experience.
---
This just seems extremely redundant since every workbench in game even power armor stations have this ability.
---
Scout armor mods or the plans would do. I mean they have X-01 plans now, scout armor needs the same treatment tbh.
---
Power armor station if it's a mod...and the mod doesn't require mats, they are included. Otherwise use a plan, which does require mats.
---
Responders venders tend to have it.
---
I know most of the hot spots. I was just wondering if one was on somebody’s server now. Save myself some time. Thank you though.
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
Your first point just reminds me of the textbook out of the loop Facebook mum or news reader, you can’t just get a website to remove content. YouTube has no obligation to do so.
---
Not yet, I had trouble doing it by myself and I don’t have any friends that play.
---
Seriously, what the fuck happened to the rule we used to have about exploits?  This isn't as bad as the last few but people should not be encouraged to give walkthroughs every time they find a bug under the guise of "getting the information out there" for Bethesda to see.  There are official avenues to report bugs to Bethesda and there are ways of posting about this shit here that AREN'T step by step instructions explaining how everyone can get in on the action before it's patched.
---
The place stays nuked even if the big red circle goes away. Just leave the area and do we shit then return. You'll get new glowing ghouls.
---
He clearly doesn’t understand the internet, although I don’t support cheaters, you can’t just ask YouTube to remove content because you disagree with it. YouTube has no obligation to do so.
---
The free staters where anarchists I guess was what I was trying to put forward. But I get what you mean.
---
Have you acquired a nuclear keycard? What was the last MAIN quest mission you completed?
---
r/imnotracistbut
---
No problem. I hope that helps :)

I think pvp for control over workshops in adventure mode is fine. Outside of that? Nah, seems pointless. However some dude came to my workshop (I was on my lvl 25 alt). Ganked me, and ran away. Didn't claim the workshop. Seemed like a waste of time, but I server hopped in case the dude was going to grief me. Some people are just ass hats.
---
My skirt wrapped around my head. I think that contributed to my death.
---
Yeah scrip has been worthless to me without this!
---
I'm on PC. Still new to online gaming, but very willing to help low levels, etc. How do y'all communicate?
---
Sent mate
---
I haven't had issues with my TS gatling, but it happens very often with an automatic tesla rifle. The bug is 100% still in the game though
---
Yea after playing the game as bloodied melee the past couple days, I’m going to go 3 points in sneak rather than evasive. 
---
Does the piece of chameleon make a big difference? That only works when you crouch and do not move correct?
---
Complete list of plans and pictures of items they unlock. Helped me when I was recreating something.

Message me ill give you the details, we are always happy to help. Honestly its become like a second job to me lol
---
have you tried it with med-x or poisoner's gear?
---
Which faction are you talking about?
---
Armor and weapons plans are the worst. I couldn't tell you what any of those mods do just by looking at it. The average person isn't going to know what "explosive vents" does by looking at the plane, but it costs a few thousand caps.
---
Did you get one?
---
Normally, the conversion would be useful, but Fallout 76 only uses the Empirical system.
---
I've seen those Chinese robot fuckers there a few times
---
So a minecraft beacon?
---
Keep calm and breach n clear
---
Wait... there are people in Canada??! 
---
J/K!! 😂😂 I love our cousins to the North, they're like our conscience at times 👍

I've yet to find a player to run it with, am hoping my usual groups return from eso and other games soon!

---
Endangerol syringer does nothing. I have tested this on multiple targets (low, medium and high DR). Two methods:  
---
Count number of shots to kill without/with endangerol.  
---
Check damage done on a target without/with endangerol, using the ShowHealth mods.  
---
I can say for certain there is no damage increase vs behemoths, lvl 91 deathclaws, level 80 scorchbeasts, level 40 turrets and watoga protectrons.
---
No, common culture uses the term Fascism for many things, some of them contradictory, but in economics Fascism is very clearly defined.
---
The "park" in the middle sometimes has an interesting creature.  Last time I did a nuke zone there, fought a 91 Death Claw.  91???
---
Good idea, but I can’t see it until SBQs aren’t laggy as hell.
---
Or cooking for that matter.
---
It's like Christmas morning for me. Incredibly easy enemies with the same or even better chance for a legendary.
---
Brotherhood factions. A couple different ones
---
This. OMG. This needs to happen
---
Probably why we don’t have many using mics/headsets, would be lucky if I come across 1 person per server.
---
I do that for some of the more common stuff, but for screws and gears and such I hate letting them get below 200.
---
I’ve done this event twice and failed both times Because me and my friend usually do it alone
---
Bethesda needs to change what ammo it uses, it’s not a hunting rifle
---
legends say they are still being made
---
How do you like your explosive shotgun build? I don't like power armor so I'm contemplating changing my build and shotguns wouldn't require too much change.
---
Player vending pretty much made every plan in the game cheap and accessible to the consumer. What’s the point of designing content if only a small proportion will grind enough to access them all. 
---
Can’t imagine they will abandon such concessions as the roadmap advanced. So you might get your way.
---
Communism and Fascism are different methods of applying the economic theory of socialism.  These are defined terms in the science of Economics.  Nationalism is more of a political ideology, it's better analyzed under psychology than econ.
---
Sleeping in other people's beds?   Creepy!
---
Started happening to me to now, what is going on.
---
The little liberator things? I hate em
---
It's always gone when I check myself, but I got one the old fashioned way last week!
---
What? Fascism is fascism it has one definition. It is a combination of specific ways to lead a country, which economically is whatever doesn't make the economy go boom, but still benefits the state. Private profits were still a big thing under fascism,just that you buyer is mostly the state in some industries, doesn't change that private citizens reaped mad profits.
---
Yes and no. You can role play all you want in your own head and through your actions, but it is definitely much easier to immerse yourself in a role when encounters are scripted. Too bad most other players are not savvy at either.
---
Thats all folks!
---
I have plenty of good vending, but Insulted is my fun item
---
I’ve seen honey beasts, fog crawler, yaoguai and death claw. Something else I can’t remember but it kicked my ass.
---
I imagine other instruments were planned for the set but were cut before release
---
yea those things gs. I hate those.
---
Maybe, but it says instruments and it’s not, I hoped they would fix it but it’s still the same
---
If you have a spare Frag Mine / Grenade it should get those bodies out of there, I'm unfamiliar with the quest but I've had to 'violently relocate' bodies before.
---
Speed demon would cost you zero perk points, and if you are running pistols I have to think you could use those agility points for damage.
---
No it’d just pop up on the maps when you hover over their base to ft to it but kinda yeah
---
Lol i was just saying in general. Spend 30 caps to fast travel to a guys shop, says he has 30 armor, actually has 30 dirty space suits for 200 caps a piece lol
---
This was my thinking
---
Sent you a friend request
---
I had one but then I put in the wrong code and the keycard was destroyed, so now I have to get a new one. So that’s where I’m at.
---
Overseers mission isn't done AFAIK... story should continue when Bethesda drops some new content.
---
I agree this should be a sticky.
---
True. and I speak from the perspective of a veteran who knows how to fast track the leveling process and would only see it as a minor inconveniance, for a new player with the learning curve on his plate it could be much more inconveniant.
---
No I just need some, I play on xbox.
---
I have scrapped a ton of leather armor and haven't learned a mod yet. I figured I'd have to buy them all.
---
I eat Geckos for breakfasts.
---
Explosive Shotguns are fantastic at moving objects around.
---
EXCELLENT to hear this. Thank you!
---
In real life the White Spring resort is called “The Greenbrier Resort” it’s in an area called “White Sulpher Springs” Since the term Greenbrier is a company and trademarked Bethesda decided to shorten White Sulpher Springs into “White Spring” and rename the Greenbrier that in-game. So it doesn’t bother me when people call it Whitesprings because in West Virginia it doesn’t really exist XD
---
Thank you it means a lot!

You hover over the item press drop an it will drop. Not in a bag but it will be sitting there waiting for someone to enter it and claim.

*Sighs in relief that my campsite hadn't been mentioned.*

ok I see what I have to do now thank you
---
def going to try this
---
Looks like a satanic cult shrine
---
West Virginia is so close to Washington DC that any power armor suits rolled out for the capital would probably end up in West Virginia. DC got hit, so it's highly likely people in the area would be trying to flee to greener pastures as well. It'd be easy for them to migrate.
---
Plus with all the trains in the area, they'd no doubt be transporting the T-60 by train from wherever they were manufactured. There's tons of plausible reasons for them to be in the area.
---
Not sure if you know this or not, but we put a Vendor bot up at whitespring, a show of comradely with our fellow factions.
---
He was routinely found dead.  
---
Then the next thing we know there is some phantom organization charging a 10% sales tax on all goods sold, despite the strong no tax stance of our group.
---
Because of these and other threats, Most of us have gone dark, except for brave Wallace.  What a trooper that guy is.  His soothing voice shall guide us through these tough times.
---
It's purely just a cosmetic thing for your camp no benefits it still contains the same amount of water as a normal large purifier I got those for my camp Because I got tired of looking at the old rusty large ones
---
I've been extracting a junk pile for a few weeks and so far it only drops generic junk (i.e. Aluminum, Oil, Steel, etc...), nothing rare.
---
Did you see a lot of legendary ghoul corpses there?  I wonder if that is where they end up!
