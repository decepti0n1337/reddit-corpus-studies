So he followed you and threatened you because you crouched? Seems kinda dumb to me.

That's where I was earlier, two huge groups including Yao Guai all started vanishing on death, by the time I got to them only a few where still there.

I play on ps4 and I randomly get sound "pops" like a burst from a microphone or a part of a word. I usually notice it happens in between open world loading areas, when you cross between cells it has to briefly load the next area.

Seems so, getting the XP so there's that.

Always send support tickets, but sadly they just auto lock them...

The reign of terror is literally referring to the hordes of scorched and scorchbeasts she's been creating. Aka the things that drove every faction in 76 in to extinction before wastelanders.

Of course it's possible, that doesn't mean that bothering people or using an unreliable method with the paid subscription is an acceptable alternative to this RIDICULOUSLY BASIC feature being in the game

I was able to buy from him twice in the same week once.  And then another time he didn't sell to me for over two weeks.    And then he started selling to me again. I have no clue why.  I think God that I don't have to deal with him anymore because I have most of the bullion stuff that I need now.

other than the SBs they come right to you anyway tho?

Also, please allow them to be silenced and have ammo penetration mods.

Sometimes I reload my shotgun or 10mm submachine gun before I shoot all my bullets.
---
I'm guessing that there is a desync between you and the server which results in the server telling you that your fusion core is empty and to reload while there is still some charge left.

Have you guys seen a QE railway??

Here's a post from a year ago.  Might be because you were spelling Encrypted correctly instead of as "Encryptid"
---
I got this when it first came out and have used it many times on clock towers. Wife will be happy when I tell her she can now get it too now. Thanks
---
She stops when you remove her from your camp...

Shucks.  I was gonna offer to help you out.

It occurs even when there isn't any changes with your health.

Apparently power armor used to be more powerful and resistant but was nerfed, at least that's the excuse I've seen used by tent and fence huggers in PA.
---
I've never been a PA user or interested in it beyond the excavator for mining. If it's that weak why bother, just use standard armor and enjoy some of the cool outfits.

Absolutely agree

You get one legendary from SBQ and one legendary combat armor piece as a reward. You also get improved repair kits so you can repair weapons or armor anywhere. Fluxes for ultracite ammo or decontamination arches. And 3 treasury notes if you've done the vault 79 quest.
---
 I think it's only really worth doing if you can solo the silo wile using as little ammo as possible then fight the SBQ waiting for her to land before attacking so you can do a lot more damage. Also don't nuke fissure site prime directly, make it so it's on the edge of the zone so people who don't use power armor will take part.
---
I'd like a retributive (you get a furious like stack but it's based on taking hits) bonus.
---
I also think that maybe unyielding needs to either cap at 2 or ignore intelligence (treat it like endurance).
---
More to the point, we need events like Encryptid and more with mechanical characteristics to the outcome.
---
We need more primary legendary like Fearless (so you don't run), Antagonizing (pulls aggro), etc. But aggro management really isnt a thing in this game.
---
They're safe as they're connected to the stash system.
---
Same here, never heard of this bug and have never experienced it. I'm on PC too.
---
Thats quite possible. Thanks. Its just so annoying that I have to look at 15 almost done cores that i might as well just drop.

Had to remove her myself, her lines were just repeating over and over and over; just endless annoyance.

Update for future people who may have the same problem. I just told Ra Ra not to go in the room with Power armor and it worked. Sucks but at least it‚Äôs done.

There tends to have a group that keeps spawning near the hunting lodge, and that results in alot of radstags.

This guy is going to open a .308 store and I gave up on the .50 round for .45 and 5.56 like an idiot. Those rounds make you into a crackhead for lead.

How do you get a pet? Still learning, sorry.

What's this? Source?
---
The game can barely handle 24 people as it is. No way they could get mounts into FO76
---
Fachnaut did too!
---
But did you notice the purvoyer sale September 10th?
---
Caps Are very useful for getting guns you want or buying a serum plan
---
Yep, that's my bad. Glad to know it's not just me at least.
---
I try.  I get to play a lot due to a disability.  I remember how bad it sucked trying to accomplish anything with very limited playing time when I was working 10 to 12 hour days.
---
I love how 134 days ago you were asking for help, now your trying to dictate how others play.
---
I checked. I don't have that one. Do you know if its a drop, random spawn, or event reward. Or is it only for sale from robo vendors?
---
Yeah, I just spent the last hour or so moving my camp to around helvetica
---
Indeed it is, my good sir üßê. Thats what he wanted and that's what he got. No griefing me for my 3 cork and 5 screws in the bog üòÇ
---
2525 is the best roll on an automatic, its basically a perfect aim bot with multiple crits per magazine!
---
I don‚Äôt know if this is true but not putting your camp in a non popular pot probably helps
---
As long as you have the weapon equipped when the target dies it counts, even if you use grenades/mines to do the damage.  You can do 99% of the damage with other weapons as long as the last 1% is with the specific weapon it counts.
---
How about no? If they arent in the single player games(which take place 200ish years later), then they wont be in the multiplayer game
---
I love how 134 days ago you came on here asking for help and now your not only dictating others play, but calling them nobodies. like you‚Äôre even remotely important
---
I wouldn't rule out pipe weapons just yet, they still benefit from both pistol and rifle perks.
---
Combine this with bloodied, explosive and dmg increasing perks and they can hit with an absurd amount of damage per hit, even more so if you can stealth it
---
No, I think she says it even more when you finish the quests.
---
HOLD UP.
---
Then my work is done!

They also need to fix the bug that causes corpses to fall below the world. Ive lost legendaries because of this
---
You can also use building to get onto roofs!
---
I actually saw a vendor selling missiles last night. What hope is there?
---
I chill on the fence because of the minions. For some reason the animals that she sends out can one tap me and a lot of the time if a scorched melees me I get one tapped. I'm bloodied but I have almost full bolstering and damage resistant perk cards on so idk why I seem so squishy during the fight. Also for some reason a lot of the time most of the hoard will agro on me and no one else so if I'm on the ground I'm constantly jumping and stimming because the enemies just follow me around and I have to try to get other people to shoot them so I can reload
---
Then you can replace her with Settler Wanderer and hear the same guitar riff over and over and have her troll you with the lines, "y'know how a song gets stuck in your head, someday I'm gonna write a song that does that." After she's played the same guitar riff for the one millionth time.
---
This came from a website someone posted. I found about the same amount on my 2 tries.
---
Headless/naked/invulnerable enemies are a feature not a bug, obviously. They have been part of the game since it's release; similarly, while games like RDR2 show dead bodies on your map, FO76 does everything possible to keep you from finding the corpses of enemies you kill, often throwing them under the world. This is also a feature; good programmers wouldn't just leave HUGE PROBLEMS in a game. Part of surviving in the wasteland is not just stiff competition for resources but also enduring amounts of frustration that could make your head explode, and these kind of features are here to ensure you experience that realism.
---
I actually ran into this issue when I went to the DMV for the quest.
---
Apparently a high level went there before I did and everything in there was lvl62, this was when I was level 40.
---
I had to slowly fight my way through the place making sure I start the encounters with headshot crits (stealth sniper at the time).
---
The fixer rifleman is good. Instigating with vigorous receiver, bock and psychotats if full health is faster than the lever for vats. The lever is good if you're cheap and don't want to use chems and alcohol, but it's really not fast enough (least to me, I'm sure there's better players who can do it outside of vats). Problem comes when you miss in vats, the recover with the lever is too slow imo. Fixer you can shoot again to stack up critical strikes.
---
High perception (radrat steaks, psychotats, 15 per ect..) and the long scope help (adds 1% to vats). Even then, my lever and dragon with +33% vats- they still miss at odd times. If you vats and fire too soon, it will miss almost guaranteed. You're looking to one hit everything.
---
Crits never miss so you want to bank those up for one hitting scorchbeasts or one hitting high hp charred ferals in the meditation/rumble events, this is where the lever is nice to have. It's sort of a ghetto bloodied in a way, really efficient with 45.
---
The handmade can do it too but it's slower, need a hardened receiver to match the fixer's damage. The nice thing about handmade is its hipfire is way way better than the fixer and cheap ammo.
---
Turrets are pretty useless overall, tbh. I don't even bother with them.
---
I agree, haunted
---
It seems like very few people got all the rewards. Maybe duper's chang d that for a large percentage, but I'm still looking for the backpack, insurgent outfit and hat, and explorers outfit, so I'll be on that grind.
---
...if they did that, they would never have released.
---
Was there supposed to be a fix in patch 21 for this?
---
I just have issues with fusion cores completely. If I'm in power armor and a core runs out, the next core comes from my other sets. My gatling laser actually took the core out of the armor I had on so it could reload once. Since then I've had to redo how I store my armor and had to do a respec so that I dont require power armor to walk around
---
Those, mini nukes and any other heavy ammo gets dropped at train stations. My stash is full enough haha.
---
I mean, have you honestly heard how sentient MODUS is?
---
First time I met him I had this feeling something wasn‚Äôt right.
---
This should have been in the game from the beginning and a pretty obvious thing too.
---
No point selling mini nukes or missiles. Totally worthless like ultracite plans and common mounted head plans.  Should be a law against it.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Skynet](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Skynet)
---
I dont pick up ammo
---
Daggerre and wards voice lines are the most irritating part of wastelanders, lol
---
Your correct and incorrect at the same time 
---
It because the fire rate of the weapon is so high that the server cant keep up  the fusion core does empty but is reset to the last point the server had it basically giving you extra ammo
---
There was supposed to be a patch in Patch 20 for it, Bethesda still thinks that they've fixed it and refuses to acknowledge that they haven't.
---
Hell I'd sell 5mm and 50 cal ammo at a half a cap each if the game would let us. Those guns burn so much ammo, goddamn.
---
I am having that problem. She just keeps complaining about her injury and I can't progress to the next phase of the quest.
---
We have a common enemy: Beth.
---
You can cancel quests and it should let you drop the item, not sure of it's just the Daily's or all of them but I had that problem with the vox syringer
---
MODUS is the best hope for Appalachia
---
I love it too, I just wish my 2 radios at my camp would just bloody stay on when I fast travel to and from my camp......
---
Skynet was the AI administrating the Sierra Army Depot, and it had no knowledge of the Enclave. &gt;!It was actually quite nice and provided you had the skills you could put it in a robobrain and make it a companion.!&lt;
---
Cool, just don't shoot her in the air, np. It's people in PA with one gun army staggering her over and over, agroing her but stand up where she can't/won't land, Aaarrrggghh!
---
This happened to me yesterday, but with Yao Guais! I was fkn pissed because I was trying to do Thrill of the Grill and complete the optional objective of turning in the 5 Yao Guai meats. Two of the Yao guai I killed (including a level 66 that killed me the first time), completely disappeared before I could loot them. It was really frustrating! All the other Yao guai I could find had already been killed, and the ones I killed myself couldn‚Äôt be looted, sigh.
---
I just leave her in undies and a prisoner collar
---
Better than hearing ‚Äúpull my finger‚Äù every minute

My BE laser rifle breaks after using it for less than ten minutes. Like I understand  that weapons need durability but repair kits dont grow on trees.

I'm more 'I don't have the scrap, but I fucking love hovering up scrap, l don't even care who you are, let me give you scrap so I can keep grabbing scrap'
---
Soon we're getting an update called One Wasteland, where enemies will be balanced to everybody. What this means is that a level 1 and a level 500 player will be able to play together in the same area. An enemy ghoul will take roughly the same amount of time for both players to kill, not accounting for equipment or damage bonuses.
---
Not a bug, brother..an exploit.
---
Ground tents = fine
---
Float tents from a glitch as it is = bad
---
I know right it's stupid
---
The issue is it's not even 100% reliable on Fo1st. A bad disconnect can mean you lose many things, which is pretty poor if you consider that a paid feature. 
---
An inter-character box is something long overdue.
---
This happened to me with Ps4 msgng
---
I was typing in group chat but heard the Fo76 menu sounds
---
I bought fishermans coveralls and something else AND deleted a character (luckily it was my level 3 i was just beginning, if i had lost my level 370 BETA character id have uninstalled and never played again)
---
i had 1240 atoms now i have 420
---
fucking pissed. not even going to bother with  ticket ( i did take a video clip of it tho)
---
cos i know beth wont give my atoms back
---
Explosive weapons too.
---
It has happened to me once in a year, and yeah it was a bad loss but it is fixed now. Generally speaking it is a sound method BUTFOR Beth of course. Congratulations on having friends - I smell too funny
---
Bags in the uranium fever event area and the floor below the where the shit load of fans and typewriters are in the tall building in abandoned bog town.
---
..But why..,did they have to make such a great character and limit her with so much repeated bullshit dialogue. I like Daguerre and I enjoyed her questline, despite all of the run and fetch elements, it was a pretty good story. 
---
I really think that the fault lies with the sound team, they seem to be overcompensating for the lack of dialogue by repeating the frequency too much. 
---
I've felt for a long time that the entire game would benefit from a reduction in the reptition of the dialogue from everything in the game. The protectron vendors repeat their dialogue every 15 seconds, it's too much. Just change that one element, I think it would make a huge difference in the player experience. Make it like repetition in 45 seconds or even 1 time a minute, then you might not hear the same 3 lines of dialogue every time you interact with these limited beings that are so lovable.
---
Mate,it's only 2 months that is live and already has 2 skins.
---
Scout armor wasn't even legendary for over a year,and its 1st skin was for f1st only.
---
Marine only got the ghillie skin now in the cosmo run after almost 2 years.
---
I wouldn't really say they're neglecting secret service armor at all!
---
It is kinda cursed. I cannot sleep now till I get a Zealots +1 INT SS chestpiece.
---
How does this ruin the game for others that enjoy playing it exactly karen? Is it taking ammo directly from you? Or just seeing others play a game the way they want to instead of the way you want them to play it makes you want to talk to a manager?
---
Ready for all the new bugs with this 'content' update?
---
There's a small gold course right outside whitespring that has about 20 or so.
---
Shit I'd be happy with a flat 1000.
---
I use one of the suitcases in Pleasant Valley. I've seen others use it too
---
I don't recall any weapons in the Legendary run only weapon skins - which is just a paint job for said weapon. Start the scout backpack quest as soon as you can cause it's a great item to have. By purifying station you mean de- contamination ( shower ) arch?
---
Why the heck is Wanderer so damn filthy for crying out loud.
---
It happened to me once in my other account , and they refund me , you should try lol
---
Get him to vegas.
---
It's been a while but i just got the same bug and I haven't found a fix. Have you ever fixed it ?
---
Never. I believe it was 200 stash in beta, 400 at release, increased to 600, then 800 about when vending was released.
---
Definitely Beth real life gear would be much cooler. He earns in game atoms by playing already and probably has a lot of them since he's been playing since release. 
---
Definitely real life gear is more memorable.
---
Happened to me with a sheepsquatch a couple months ago. Got a video of him dying and falling into the ground.
---
I have a bloodied build and a tank build. It only happens on my bloodied so I think it has something to do with that.
---
Not sure if you are even on Xbox, was just the very first thing to pop up. I'm on PC and it still happens a year later but not as bad.
---
Stops for me when the event is over but used to stick around until I left the server most of the time.
---
Actually would start whenever anyone did the event before even if I didn't go lol.
---
ah maybe i will cos i really missed out on a few bundles ..was going to actually buy the 2400 atoms to give me 3600 for two bundles i want
---
This is either gonna be completed on day one or a major pain in the ass
---
I dump all my excess stuff mostly in blue suitcase if there is one or any container in the railroad stations all the time and I always check em too!!
---
I'm pretty sure this is not their fault as much as the messaging system on PS4. I'm not playing on PS4 so I don't know for sure, but I've had this kind of thing happen in games I've played before because on PC. The chat menu acts as an overlay only and doesn't take direct control. This makes your UI continue to be controlled while you're using the features of said overlay application. It's lame to be sure. I hope you get your refund but I doubt it :/
---
a lot of the time I put all the spare ammo the I know I will never use in my vending machine for 0caps if someone else will use it take it that's how it should be imo
---
He didn't make it very long in my camps at all. There's just something about Settler Wanderer that's sort of wholesome and comforting in comparison to the others despite how she repeats the same crap all of the time, I feel like she's really the most upbeat companion and offers the most.
---
Only need 1 point unless that's your build focus, waste of points otherwise. I run demo 1 on all of my classes.
---
Why does everyone have fallout 1st? Seems like a waste of money
---
It should say 5 minutes past!!!!!!!!

Thought this post was about the chicken coop, carnsarnit!

What he said. Also bash works so whittle it down with another gun then finish it off with a bash
---
ya for sure! or a concrete bunker
---
Yes
---
How did you delete a character? Do you not have to type that name in as verification?
---
I do not get why the majority of the community is against this. It is a small quality of life fix that would be such a minuscule fix to implement and would make the world of change for handling and gameplay. I feel like everyone who is against this change are all in the mind set of, ‚Äúohhh call of duty bad, fortnite bad, good controlling mainstream fps bad, we no like those kid games, keep my grown up game clunky and unenjoyable to pilot;‚Äù so much so that it is actually detrimental to the game itself.
---
I've been sitting here looking at gun metal grey. for months (if I didn't put an outfit on). I'm good. I'm gunna pop the ghillie on.  
---
also, I said, "I feel...". I said up front it was my opinion.  relax, mate
---
Those are breakable on Nuclear Winter mode, so you can only really rely on existing structures for true protection.
---
Laste week I said in a comment that I haven't encountered blatant cheating for weeks  Well, now I should eat those words... In the past few days alone I found several blatant cheaters. 
---
One was running through the air shooting people left and right. 
---
Another one was running around, kept doing this weirs spin with his character and people were dying to him. I myself died to him. He seemed to kill me with what sounded like extremely rapid punching... when we wasn't around or even in my line of sight.
---
The last one was using some kind of player-detection hack. I was wookie-ing in a bush on the river bank, completely hidden (verified in photomode). And then a player shows up far on the other side of the river and after while starts shooting the exact one bush where I'm sitting.
---
It's a bummer. I like NW more than I ever expected to like a BR mode. I like that surviving is a viable strategy. The time to kill is a bit too low, but I can live with that. To bad the cheaters are returning and ruin this gamemode...
---
Eww.  Floating camp :(
---
I would recommend not starting with 76
---
Toddamit lol
---
A lot of high level players are high-functioning psychopaths who lack empathy. On the plus side it leaves a lot of time to play 76
---
Bethesda doesn‚Äôt give a shit they stopped responding a long time ago
---
I already got refunded  in other account when i accidentally bought only the red rocket power armor skin  instead of the bundle with power armor + jetpack + power armor station.
---
Also all the games freezes the controls while using psn apps that are in a total diferent tab , so yes its kinda of their fault to dont disable their game comands while using PS native apps since all other games do that.
---
Even so it takes place in the event area I simply made a list I wanted them to see I wasn‚Äôt complaining at all.
---
It‚Äôs coming. Eventually. With legendary perks. Maybe.
---
Plasma does sell but it is kinda niche 
---
Most people who use plasma use a gattling so they would use the cores
---
But the regular plasma rounds are really only useful to people who use the rifleman or gunslinger perks 
---
Plasma guns will scale to these perks so with a scatter barrel on it will give those pistols and sniper builds a reliable shotgun that is also every effective with SBQ  and while the damage might not seem great that's because it doesn't calculate the extra projectiles or burning damage
---
Not saying I‚Äôm against it, just doubtful Beth would add that in.
---
Well shucks, you did again..
---
Then why would everyone have it?
---
And if you don‚Äôt want them too then wellü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Basically, if you not standing on the ground outside the fenced area don‚Äôt shoot her while she‚Äôs flying. You want the people on the ground shooting her since that is what will get her to land. Anytime she is hovering but not landing, it‚Äôs because she is agroed on someone who is on a tent or a fence or the roof of the bunker.
---
Sorry friend. If you‚Äôd like, check out our friends over at r/fo76FilthyCasuals. Pretty down to earth folks.

Have been for a few days
---
Do you have fo1st? I only noticed this after getting fo1st and wondered if the daily items were available to all. Fo1st folks get a fridge for discount this week, I know that, but curious about the daily.
---
They seem to support everything Bethesda does. Fallout 1st seems like a money grab if you ask me. Your paying 100 bucks for something that should be in the base game, or at the very least less than 100 bucks
---
Yeah they blow up and just cease to exist. You gotta get in there quick to loot them.
---
Thanks for your input
---
Could be cool but theres only 2 factions and soon enough you'll never need faction xp again
---
To my knowledge, when you kill a sentry bot, you need to get in quick and grab the resources before it explodes, because when it explodes, all its drops are deleted
---
I do it at Charleston station, it's the closest one to my camp and on my XP farming route.
---
You should turn the wall into a door frame and let the poster float at different distances from the shooting spot.then have all back wall at the same distances(the end of the room). It would look more realistic in my opinion. If you don't like them floating,you can just place a ceiling light bulb,or some other ceiling loght, behind it to have both light and the  poster support.
---
Only have 2 cha. Can‚Äôt share but really appreciate those that do.

I've tried asking for atoms for the missing score, they just auto locked the ticket...
---
It couldn‚Äôt be too good because in the future starving and thirst will no longer negatively impact you so it could be too good.
---
I didn't have THAT many, although I did have too many. I got mostly garbage and scrapped it, or tried to sell it if it was 3 star and something I'll never use, but I still have too many I'll never use because I feel they're too good to sell üòÖ Thank goodness for mules! Plus when vending was down I was able to buy more garbage legendaries to scrap. I also have a Bloody and Exterminator's Rolling Pins that I'm hanging onto for the LOLs üòÇ
---
This is true. I'm sorry but I'd rather keep seeing complaints on reddit in the hopes that enough community outcry would spark something instead of just simply sucking it up and calling out people for specifically not wanting to buy into this poorly managed gameplay, but 9 times out of 10 they'll just give you a free icon instead.
---
I don't know, I think it's plausible. Two headed cows and deer, why not a two headed horse?
---
‚ÄúLovers who Wander‚Äù or ‚ÄúDrip Drop‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt be bad either.
---
Sometimes the bodies will just vanish. It's happened to me two times that immediately come to mind. Once was solo, a 3* gutsy outside of Sugar Grove. One was Wendigo Colossus I took down with a public team member.
---
Both times the bodies popped back into the world after a loading screen. After entering and then leaving Sugar Grove, and after we both (that was important, because it didn't work when we did it individually) fast traveled from the nuke zone and fast traveled back (apparently survival tents override the nuke zone no-fast-travel, because it worked.)
---
Both times, the actual bodies popped back into existence, not piles, and they were previously not found with the camera.
---
Tl;dr: a loading screen seems to make disappeared legendary corpses reappear
---
Okay I'm glad I'm not the only one having this problem idk what caused this to happen because it was not always like this  just great old Bethesda I guess
---
Ah, makes sense.
---
The general understanding was that (thanks to YT videos and reddit posts of yesterday/month) standing on a building, such as v9, would prevent queen from landing. So everyone stood on tents and fences. 
---
Most higher lvs don't die at queens, and when they do its because a legendary death claw and fog crawler combo sneaks up on them while they're focused on the queen. So unless it's now true fences and tents also stop queen from landing, that's where ill stand :/
---
I want to build a range so badly but I've got all my characters C.A.M.P.'s just how I like them üòí
---
This may push me over into firing up a second account.
---
The old place I used to check was the trashcan outside the purveyor's former home. It was by the parking lot. I found thousands of energy cells, hundreds of chems, etc. 
---
I am guessing that place is now no longer in use, but it was always on my checklist when I went to go pray to the RNG gods.
---
Aw sorry to hear that man and I really appreciate the gesture.  It‚Äôs great there are people like you playing FO76.  Yeah, very limited playing time over here but still love this game.  In all truth I shelved this game until just a few months ago because I am primarily a single player game/type person.  Started playing it, and I can‚Äôt get enough (even the multiplayer aspect).
---
It doesn't happen to everyone who is logged in at the time, and it can occur hours after the reset if that is your first login since the reset!
---
No problem, I just looked at my mutation list and I also use egg head mutation because you level up quicker with more intelligence, twisted muscles for my melee character, and carnivore for better effects from eating meat. You could pretty much get every mutation in the game if you felt like it but a couple are build specific like adrenal reaction and talons. Good luck on your quest to become a mutantüëç
---
They sometimes spawn at DN
---
Hahahahaha damn. What platform are you on?
---
Where?? Me and my tesla are salivating
---
Look at this guy! He has "friends". 
---
Yeah right buddy! Nice try!
---
/s
---
DN?
---
Sometimes blood eagles have dogs, not sure about cats tho.
---
I just might try out one slot and see what happens, thanks for the advice!
---
Seen plenty of times were she agroed on a fence dweller and hovered in the air refusing to land. I think in general the point is that her pathing is shit and it‚Äôs best to hang out on the ground.
---
pc my only friend got banned for duping
---
Up near pioneer scout camps
---
Yup, I've seen the same, my partner and I share an account and we've got a full-health sniper build and my bloodied unarmed, and it only happens on the bloodied unarmed toon
---
I haven‚Äôt been booted off, but have been noticing major lag when I haven‚Äôt before.
---
I sell like 3 or 4 kinds for 2 caps, absolutely everything else for 1
---
Surinam toads. I hate them.
---
I got in one yesterday and was also curious. It was just the camp module. That‚Äôs it. No bed, no workbenches, nothing. I‚Äôm next to the wayward so I always expect to have a few tries before I get in but come on
---
No griefing, no.  An option to turn pvp damage off for you completely, and an option to turn it on full blast.
---
Finally, someone with the guts to give us some gold.
---
Yeah I ran into one of those today. Damn queen kept landing like 150 feet away from where she usually lands and we spent probably 10 minutes total just standing around waiting for her to land
---
Gotta reach the 1k damage threshold for loot.
---
I routinely sell .38 .44 then again im not a crying bitch
---
Well of course it supports them:they own it. Yes it is a money grab. No, you don't need it. I have it. If you don't like the price don't buy it. Or buy it for a month and see how you like it.
---
I recently gave up on even trying to sell all my plans and recipes for what they're "worth". All 200--just 10 caps a piece! fuck it
---
You will need to find a solo spawn creature at a random encounter site. It takes a long, long, long, time
---
That is false. The only data left on the old launcher was atoms but everything else including existing unlocked atom purchases did transfer over and I can attest to that as I had significant progress with camp unlocks which transferred over to steam. Admittedly some users here have/had large amounts stocked up on the Bethesda launcher but they were a minority and your argument is circular.
---
Im upset because that asshole raider ‚Äúleader‚Äù got upset when i talked her slave out of taking all the gold. She should be paying me yet she had the audacity to lower my rep even though im the one that started this all. Im the personwho saved lou and gave her the plans. IM THE MOTHERFUCKING LIZARD KING!!!
---
Yes I‚Äôll definitely come back for the quest updates and just roll through those
---
There is a tabby cat called Murgle just up the stairs behind Welch station. (not the stairs that lead down to Welch)

I‚Äôve been having a lot of crashes today. Never really had the issue before.
---
Take not Todd's name in vain, lest ye RNG will sour, and thy server laggeth...
---
I know how to tame things, I don't know where to find cats and dogs. 
---
Thank you though.
---
Basically back out and click back into adventure mode. 9/10 it‚Äôll but you in a new server.
---
I took all the gold as well, we did plan it and make a team but we also promised them a cut. And at least they don't just take it, like the settlers probably did
---
Okay thank you, I'll try this next time a nuke is dropped.
---
I sure hope so
---
Why skip over the indefinite detention and drone striking American citizens man?
---
I think it's more accurate, and less controversial to just say "anyone with power, almost certainly bad, at least in part"
---
That would explain why.
---
Just gotta hop around the event zones till you get lucky I'm afraid, none of the guaranteed spawns are tamable =(
---
Same here. Last whole month of playing I have only crashed once or twice, but today, I keep crashing just trying to launch the game.
---
What would I add for custom crosshair? I didn't see anything on the mod page for it to be added anywhere. Sorry I'm new to modding f76

This

Its harder in groups that melt her quickly, good luck out there wastelander
---
Oh okay. Well that's good they refunded you for their previous blunder
---
I don‚Äôt recommend using in-world containers other than the drop bag, drop 1 round of ammo on the ground, when the bag appears go to ‚Äútransfer‚Äù and put the equipment you wish to transfer into the bag THEN switch characters. I‚Äôve seen many people lose irreplaceable stuff using containers other than paper bags. I also recommend making a trustworthy friend to anchor to instead of playing the game of chance with a private server. What if you drop stuff in your server and your internet stops working? Say goodbye to all the stuff you dropped.
---
The reason a friend is useful is, if something like the scenario I described above happens, at least you can tell your friend to grab it for you so you don‚Äôt lose it.
---
Hey, occasionally they introduce a bug that's fun - like the current tent bug at the Line in the Sand event.
---
I wish there was some kind of timer on them. Fulfill the requirements, and you get the right to trigger any of the events, but each one has a 30 minute cool down or something. Anyone can do it if they fulfilled the starting quest or whatever, and certain other events are regularly triggered on certain times.
---
It would make the game more fun, plus they already have the system implemented with the nukes. Each one resets after like two hours, I think? The rad zones last for 45 minutes, the flux and radiated enimies spawn for about an hour. Take the same idea, but dumb it down for the basic events. Gives some idea on how to prep from the nukes for any new guys as well.
---
Have a crew that goes and grinds their favorite events instead of needing to constantly server hop. I already know several people who server hop the entire time already. They launch all three nukes to get the SBQ and wendigo, kill them, then leave. In a couple hours they end up launching 10-15 nukes. Bethesda might as well embrace that, or at least improve the way to spawn other events.
---
Her landing trigger is proximity based. Being on a fence or tent does not affect that. The reason that it is advisable to get off the fence is that players are spread out more, covering a larger area of the field. If you are underneath her when she finishes her circling animation she will land. If people are spread out across the field the chances of her landing improve significantly. 
---
Bracing for massive downvotes...
---
I thought it was 1500 - in any case, point stands - there is a minimum amount of damage needed to be dealt to get loot.
---
OP - turn on damage numbers in options if you haven't already.
---
If you want you can add me

Not having an account bank in an mmo is baffling. It‚Äôs such an easily monetised thing that you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd be all over it... eg in Star Trek Online you have to buy it, and then pay to expand it more. Not that I endorse over-monetisation, just pointing it out from their point of view

They fixed ash and goo for scorchbeasts in 20. Shouldn‚Äôt be happening anymore

I never lock then, not even fusion cores. Not even my collectrons.
---
If someone drives by and snatches it's okay. I check my resources 2-3 during a session so technically they idle doing nothing a lot.
---
Yeah I know, it should be a feature. I wouldnt mind paing a few caps for that.
---
Fuck Rose. Figuratively.
---
I don't think you can tame dogs/cats may be wrong. just never seen/heard of them getting tamed but other things yes
---
It was a vague tweet so based on the timeline of everything else I wouldn't expect it for at least a couple more patches.
---
Edit I may have been mistaken as the [July 9th ITV](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5AO20UhNUTb3WsBNM6fWXl/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-ammo-converter-updates-purveyor-sale-and-more?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_content=Bethesda%20Game%20Studios&amp;utm_source=Community&amp;sf125090316=1) seems to indicate it is happening with this weeks patch.
---
Hey, I only downvoted this comment because you said something about it. I upvoted your post though.
---
*Perfectly balanced*

Get perks from luck that repairs weapon on hit
---
I didn't even know about the blue suitcase. Thx for the info.
---
Oh no, I agree with you, buddy. I was only speaking of the guy this post is about who griefed me in the bog üòÖ. I would like an option to toggle pvp modes. It would be fun!
---
All those projection effects have issues. It depends on so many aspects,like where you put them,the number of them ,the number of other lights,the items around them.....that is basically just rng.
---
Then any patch could kill or renew the effect. My cola light always worked fine,then bugged for a whole patch and now it's back on as new. The pumpking tho only worked the day I placed it down. The raider/settler cola lamp lights up but I need to store and replace it if I want the projection.  
---
Working as intended.
---
-Actually are you trying to grief on Reddit? Taking your advice will lead to inevitable disaster.
---
I can give you two spawns that spawn each. They aren‚Äôt tamable, however, so they‚Äôll just wander around your camp, but if you move, they won‚Äôt go with. 
---
I‚Äôve only seen one person with a tamed dog and never a tamed cat however. I‚Äôd suggest YouTube, there‚Äôs people who have posted videos about tamable creatures for camps. 
---
There‚Äôs a billboard just west of Solomon‚Äôs Pond and south of the top of the world where several cats spawn. Another cat spawn is Murgle - follow the path from Welch Station.
---
For dogs, there‚Äôs only one I know. Above Harper‚Äôs Ferry, look on the big rocks near the Scorchbeast lure. There‚Äôs a couple, long dead, and their dog there with a bowl. Has an amazing view of the Ferry. Little lower than the rest of the rocks.
---
Yeah , but my main issue its to alert people about this bug that can happen with anyone while they dont patch it.
---
I think this one just isn't coming. It's been heavily requested since launch. There were datamines of mailbox skins like a year back. They never came. I dont know if it's a choice or a limitaton, but they've never commented
---
Its because all of the douches left to play the next big gsme.game
---
I‚Äôd just like to point out that while I thought the private server swap with one account was a potential solution, I tested it once with some legendary items I wanted to transfer between characters. The transfer went smooth. Okay, so how about sending some Junk across? 
---
After logging out of the server and switching characters, I tried to return to my private server only to be met with a crash. When I made my way back to the server, all of the items were gone. I‚Äôm happy this happened with some Junk I could live without, I could only imagine if it was something else. It‚Äôs made me think twice before attempting to transfer using private servers again.
---
Just... don't.  
---
Save yourself the disappointment.  
---
It is embarrassingly broken, and even *if* they make it back to your camp, they won't be there long before they disappear, die, or are killed in various ways by griefers.
---
But if you are *insistent* then the best place I have come across has been the crashed vertibird in the lake directly north of Abbie's Bunker and directly east of Vault 79. That's where I've tamed multiple animals and creatures - including a dog and a cat. I stupidly try again once or twice with every patch just **hoping** it has improved.  
---
It. Never. Does.
---
I noticed my mule account got hit with it the other day. 7/9 dailies got completed.
---
Thankfully it was the mule and not my main

Big brain moves!

Power user helps maintain fusion cores and there are easy ways to acquire them
---
Focus on a particular damage type, jack of all trades characters dont do well, but having different loadout with the same special allotments do
---
Inventory management is an art, either get 1st for junk storage or sont keep more than 100 common junk in your stash, and only bulk aluminum copper cork fertilizer gears springs lead and oil, bulking anything else increases its weight

I have 2600 hours feel free to pm me on any specific question you might have. I just woke up and know I missed some questions there.
---
Disappearing/unlootable legendaries have been a real problem lately in Whitespring, I have had a lot of success in looting them by fast traveling to Vault 76, then immediately fast traveling back which causes the bodies to reload.
---
I mostly play solo unless one of my friends are on.  But I come across cool people from time to time and will turn my mic on or just jump in and help.  I am with you though.  Can't get enough.
---
No, I‚Äôm trying to help people avoid your shitty advice. In-world containers have been very touchy ever since Bethesda patched them when the huge dupe wave happened at the release. And I had a friend, specifically use a suitcase in her private world and her equipment was inaccessible when she returned. This happened a little over a month ago
---
I lock the junk ones at my camp and the robot, but i leave the water purifiers unlocked. I used to lock the back door at my old camp because i didn't want people to use it, i just wanted them to use the front.
---
I always wonder why people lock rolms in their camp though. It's not like I can steal anything?!???
---
No perks make them stronger. You only have perks that allow you to craft more stronger variations and different types. A part of the problem with turrets are they target other items in your camp, plus it seems like they actually invite trouble. I have had less attacking mobs once I got rid of all my turrets.
---
All you can do to make them better is install guard lights. They increase the targeting range. Even then, I had a lvl 5 super mutant pop shot my camp to death while none of my rocket launcher turrets even seen him.
---
Oh no, it doesn't. I've had dead pets and pets that just vanished. I just keep on taming them even though I know they won't last.
---
Yeah it happens sometimes that it just wont start =(
---
I get authentication errors
---
That's how I do it. Find ammo I need buy it three times to complete the challenge  then after buy 25 to 100+ caps worth as a thank you.
---
That's not what you said. That's what I'm saying, your original post said exactly what I quoted before. That statement contradicts your entire post as it says you are inclined to buy the things that leave, please re-read my comments and your original post.
---
In the menu you can select character right...well this was a level 3 just barely ever used as a mule.
---
i ran thru the vault i named it Just 'A' ...apparently while i was messaging i used A in my chat and hit enter. 
---
to the ppl dwnvoting...you people think its impossible to delete a character but are aware you can make fuckin purchases you dont want in the atom shop in that same glitch
---
cool üëå
---
That place you're talking about is where I got my first sloth, he got killed my a players camp turrets half a block from my old camp. I didn't know the smaller animals spawned there, I'll check it out. Thanks.
---
So do I üò≠
---
But as i said - directly **east** of Vault 79, and directly **north** of Abbie's Bunker. You will find what you are looking for (eventually) on the west bank of that lake.
---
Good luck, and don't take their inevitable quick deaths too hard.
---
If you pass the luck skill check you can save athena and cure her headaches!
---
The entire forest area is low level. And theres a bunch of resource maps already made.
---
Not telling you not to do it. But a better use of your time might be something else
---
Whitespring Suitcases (Specifically Blue but I‚Äôve found stuff in all of them) and the cigarette beaching
---
Nvm you edited the post once you knew I was right. You changed That to But.
---
Wait, its MONTHLY?
---
What weapon were you using?  I suggest buying a gatling plasma from the enclave and it will get you loot.
---
Haha swift victory friend, well played sir ü§òüèº

Yeah I'd did this for lead and the sorts....
---
3rd month in 0 lead cause I'm always crafting üòÖüòÖü§£ü§£ü§£
---
I don't believe they stop her from landing at all. I always stay on the ground "just incase" but after killing her multiple times in private whilst sat on a tent, it hasn't stopped her from landing once.
---
Also maybe more people would avoid being on the tents the entire time if other people bothered to shoot the enemies she spawns.
---
Daily is always available to everyone.
---
Thanks for helping us newbies out, it really helps us want to keep playing. I had a lvl 300-something public teammate using my camp as a fast travel point yesterday and when they saw me they dropped off a 3-star legendary vampiric tambourine thing at my level (35) as a gift. I needed a new backup melee weapon so it was perfect.
---
Later on, I was walking to the Grafton train station, and I saw a lvl 12 getting swarmed by radscorpions from the event going on. I ran over and started clearing them out to save him... but then the boss came and I started getting swarmed too lol. Then randomly a lvl 62 dude came along and bailed me out too. üòÇ
---
Dont reload
---
It's related to the amount of damage you take.  If you take a huge amount you die, if you take just a bit more than your health you are downed.
---
Not sure the exact numbers but that's the gist.
---
Contact support, they'll just lock the ticket and ignore you but we need to keep trying damn it!
---
Well, next time try just fast traveling back to the event. I started it that way.
---
Shrug
---
I have a build similar to yours and swear by an Instigating (Primed) silenced Gauss Rifle. Two-shot‚Äôs not even close for your parameters. Have yet to dip toes into a Bloodied one, so lacking data for you on that.
---
I understand
---
I wouldn't waste your time, a cat or a dog tame is definitely possible but they will be lvl one and die almost instantly,  and they are 2 of the rarer pet spawns so you may take a week to find one but it will die the first day
---
Edit: I have stopped taming anything other than deathclaw or mirelurk kings , they seem to be the only creatures that last more then a week
---
The WV lumber company is still full of stuff.
---
Yep, it will have 10x and 100x options to turn in ammo and vastly more ammo points you can bank. 
---
So it will still have the same interface but you'll be able to turn in and buy much more ammo with vastly fewer clicks.   
---
Iirc that's included with the patch coming out next week.
---
Alright, thank you, I'll give that a try when I can, thank you for the help in advance!
---
Fat Man gang.
---
We are a dying breed the nukes must go on.
---
I really think that PVP needs to be more than a whole different mode.  I think the PVP zone needs its own map, not simply a duplicate of the adventure mode map.    I think it should be  a map completely divorced from the story mode, or maybe it could have a story of its own that implements  PVP in some way.
---
I don't have a problem with PVP.  But I don't like it when games put it in the same map where the story mode takes place.  I don't want to run into another player and get blown away while I am trying to complete a story quest.
---
In survival mode, you could do events and launch nukes and all the same stuff you do in adventure mode.  I think the PVP mode should be a whole different map with completely different events that are PVP focused.
---
Survival mode was just adventure mode that allowed you to shoot other players.  I think the PVP mode should be more than that.
---
Yes, normally people are pretty friendly when it comes to adventure mode.
---
Lots of the mean folks are too afraid of direct conflicts so that's where you hear about trap camps or people blowing up each other's camps with explosive bait to avoid the bounty. 
---
Sometimes people try to "scam" each other but it's always something silly like: "He said he'd give me this gun for my god gun if i dropped my god gun on the ground first, then he didn't give me his gun". Which is sleazy, most agree but come on, if you trusted that you kind of deserve it.
---
*Crotchety old man voice*: Back in my day when we wanted to raid or grief other players we did it honestly and wore our bounties with pride, hoping people come to collect. 
---
BUT...buuuut... but... the negative situations I described are increasingly rare. People are NORMALLY happy to help each other out. 
---
Also, for a post-nuclear apocalyptic game with cannibals and raiders and mutants (oh my!), people get shockingly upset when someone does something mean.
---
Here's the link so you can contact the XB1 folks:

I have a 3* legendary two shot Fat Man that does 2925 damage. I was enjoying the Daisycutter but I think I‚Äôll be using the two shot from now on and equip bear arms.

---
Ad Victoriam, brother.
---
I joined a server and there was a player who was hacking and had taken every single workshop on the map. Not a fun time
---
It seems that there are enough ‚Äúbroken builds‚Äù that maybe they should just add tougher enemies instead of nerfing everything.
---
I'm a simple man; I see a yao guai and I ride him into battle.
---
Alrighty:) what would be a better guide type of thing that's not very well know? I just want to help out the community in any way I can.
---
I actually prefer the combat shotgun over the gauss. If you have a hard time finding them, try running picklock. You get the same rewards as orange crates.
---
Settlers are massively ungrateful. I gave them their slice and they just treat you like general shit. I feel Beth coulda had the voice acting change after the raid as you only get a handful of positive comments. Big one is Ward.... Max rep and he's still issuing hollow threats from his bed.
---
Still the rep grind isn't that bad. Not compared to the subsequent bullion grind for SS armor etc. If you chase the weapons and pack mods too it all adds up. Meanwhile.... What're caps for these days ya know? I'm buying shit I don't need so that I'm under the limits constantly.
---
Hey everyone - this guy is really tough!  Let‚Äôs just agree to stop selling .38 so he doesn‚Äôt show us how tough he is. Whew, that was a close one.
---
Not personally but server crashes put you on a clock. Normally you can get back in and get things but system wide crashes makes you loose everything
---
true, you can use blueprinted stacks i think tho
---
Yet another bit of evidence that shows level has nothing to do with the quality of a player's store.
---
If turrets are bad, I hear you can hack robots? If I do so, can I make the robots an ally? Can I build robots? If so, how long do they last in either case?
---
Ooh, thanks!   I have fallout 1st and I did not know about transferring items through that method.
---
I use blueprinted stairs and tables for climbing.
---
Same here. If I get in I only get at most 15 mins before I get booted
---
This is why I prefer raiders to settlers. The settlers don't really care about you and are kind of pussies, but raiders actually at least pat you on the back and say "good to have you with us."
---
I use a BE Railway Rifle. Mines auto, but semi is good too. Its super Vats-efficient. And has a long range. No suppressor though, lol.
---
I was looking for robots to kill for atoms and didn‚Äôt want to wait at watoga so I tried to go there and it was being worked on. This was like a week or so ago. Other than quest that send you there idk that many people actually go there often.
---
I believe its suppose to be the fusion core exploding.
---
That's a band-aid to a broken design.
---
I like things too
---
Damage has already been done. Good idea they do something in the code to track them next time.
---
events normally you don‚Äôt drop your loot but you die instantly
---
I feel you man
---
Yeah but the digs of the raiders are counter-intuitive to survival. You burn/bury human bodies, as they're a massive source of disease. While it's all good to be Mad Max like our there and hang your trophies around, with all these rotten bodies and a dodgy water table those Crater raiders would constantly be battling dysentery and all matter of shit.
---
They also don't like my Responder uniform...
---
Yeah but no more damage could be done if they did this
---
I share travel agent,  cuz everyone fast travels
---
You don't really need to buy steel. just kill a bunch of enemies, take their guns, equipped with scrapper perk and start scrapping their weapons like crazy. eventually you'll be swimming in so much steel you don't know what to do with it because you don't have enough lead.
---
I saw one wear exactly that at a camp yesterday. I was shocked but not surprised.
---
Bush wookie is not my preferred play style, but at level 95, I am getting tired of Nuclear Winter and at this point I just want my hellfire paint.  I am at a point where I really don't feel like actually playing NW the way it was meant to be played.  But  I still want the XP. So I have been turning off team fill, turning on aqua boy and hiding in Grafton lake.

Like i said lvl 28 player running around ignoring all the minions. Didnt die once.

It is sitting on the tent. It works alone cause you are the only player. When you have 10 people gathered around and shes confused who to aggro but the dude on the tent has the most aggro she won't land cause she has no path to a tent that is FLOATING.
---
Well, can you help me? I will be playing on 
---
Monday EST time. I would like help to get to level 10 and stuff. If so you can reply to me!
---
There are some ammo that can be sold at 2caps each - but these are much harder to come by and by in large ammo should be sold at 1 cap
---
I would be into a ghillie topiary camp item, maybe a crouched variant as well, both hilarious and tactical possibilities. It would be hilarious if every server in adventure had ones you could place anywhere for people to laugh at - in fact they need a few items like that, world placeables (these are the social things I thought they would capitalize on with the platform).
---
I'm talking FLOATING tents
---
im Junkies since the game launched, and i use unyielding. Some people like to use vanguard with junkies, but there is so much radiation in the game that vanguard seems worthless to me.
---
im just using the mini gun lvl 50
---
pc doing it as well today it‚Äôs not you
---
With both sides, if you don't take the caps payout you get more rep. With Rocksy, if you tell her that 'Appalachia has a new corpse' you're supposed to get a better rep payout.
---
I wanted to have floating so I was going to put a hanging half wall put it only liked to snap into one place on the ceiling.

I went with the raider punk. Put a pompadour on him and some sophisticated clothes.
---
Yeah, just fought the scorchbeast queen for the first time last night. Once it was dead, it dove into the ground and shot off like a rocket off into the distance, went running after it but never found it, everyone else stayed back, so maybe it was just on my screen that it happened. Was pretty disappointed in the whole thing...
---
dont forget person 5: nuking atlas over and over and over
---
You should improve your level and gear before moving on into harder areas. Just take it easy and enjoy the game, don‚Äôt rush the main questline
---
Glad im not the only one who hears those random pops of talking or laughing or screaming when I come into the game or fast travel.
---
not mine either, I just can barely stomach all the waiting so I decorate while I wait to level my overseer level, it just feels too broken to level a new toon (which i did once just for NW). I can't seem to ever get a crisp enough connection when I get near people to fight properly. Also, I can't sit still and in am abush game that's no good.
---
The settler that can‚Äôt find his tools is up there on annoying.
---
5 people gather on 1 floating tent queen sat there hovering looking directly at them all, as soon as brick head PA 352 lvl jumped off she came right to the ground and i mean INSTANTLY.  His feet touched the ground and is wasnt even .00000001 seconds later than she swooped down and attacked him
---
 
---
She can't get a path to a invalidly placed tent. Just cause yes "oh its not invlaidly placed it let me place it" doesn't mean that the developers plotted her a path to see you and attack you while sitting in the air. 
---
Idc if you ait on your normally placed tent. Never had a problem. But qhen we spemd 10 minutes of unleashing ammo into the queen floating above 1 dude. For her to come down and finish her full health in a matter of seconds once she landed, yes its the tent.
---
Well I guess my comment wasn‚Äôt directed at you was it bud? I‚Äôm staying the fact that their primary job is to make money and not necessarily engage the end user is garbage.
---
What do you recommend trying to get and do
---
Have you tried going and talking to the overseer?
---
Lets be really, people are probably gonna be changing the position of nuke at monongah mine to try and find a Colossus spawn.
---
Atleast someone grasped my concept.
---
IT ADDS TO PLAYER IMMERSION
---
Have you tried talking to the overseer?  Maybe wait until you're lvl 21?
---
What level are you?
---
It‚Äôs a much better community than Bethesda deserves.
---
I had no idea AquaBoy could screw with bloodied builds.  Time to stop sharing that one.
---
First thing I thought of when reading this was how people can connect to fo76 with gamepass for xbox on their pc and that could have explained that convo but then I realized they would be playing with xbox players not pc players so nvm

It's thinking about burning down your Camp though!

I‚Äôm on Xbox and I have had fallout first since I think December or November. But never had a problem. Only thing I have ever had a problem with was it will take money out on the 12th for me every month but atoms don‚Äôt go on account for a day or two.

Get calibrated shocks. There expensive but worth it. I used to only use excavator, but got calibrated shocks for ultricite and now that's all I use.

Been there, but... MusicLady plays the same song (song?) over and over and over. Her quest line should be seeking out new sheet music, not weapon cases. Went back to SpaceLady and we got friendly. Now, when coming home drenched in super mutant blood she is always glad to see me. We sit in bathrobes and listen to the gunfire at night and the random settlers that fall off the cliff near my camp.
---
They were an additional problem in FO4 because they never disappeared and all of those cumulating ash piles caused save bloat
---
They probably assume with any large scale game old players will burn out and stashes will go idle left to rot, new players will always come. If they fix the exploitable methods they can prevent it from happening again. However people that want to exploit will always find a way as the saying goes. 
---
I also have a feeling FO76 was a testing site for other Beth projects which is why their face and attitude shift often and dodge a lot of questions. Fo76 is a masterpiece in my eyes and truly has come a long way in its short life. There is so much more potential in a *game like this* than the bugs and glitches it's known for. I really feel like they need to step up their game on bug fixes and anti cheat. What can go wrong?
---
If you‚Äôre facing trouble with the main questline because they take place in difficult areas and you‚Äôre underleveled then I recommend you do side missions and public events to level up more. I don‚Äôt know what build you‚Äôre currently playing but if you‚Äôre not investing in any damage boosting perks, then you should
---
I left her in the bunker.
---
That should work too, but my mini hits for 2 and the gat plasma hits for 11-14 on the queen, her armor is crazy!
---
Thanks everyone. Iv decided to keep my OG character as I made a new one today and i cba going through that grind again. worst case scenario it takes a couple weeks but id rather grind with decent weapons then pipe pistols
---
thanks man!
---
All of my ammo is at 0 caps at the moment
---
No ammo is even worth a cap. (explosives take too much space and good for ammo convertion), so really they rely on low levels desperation for ammo. Dont buy anything from them. Some people just chase (or wait) for the most caps. Well, its their choice, and its your choice to not buy.
---
That was my original problem, and I put in a ticket for not getting the atoms 12 hours after the renewal fee was paid, but now I suddenly don't seem to have 1st at all, but there's still a $14 hole in my bank account for it.

Hell, who says they aren't constantly battling disease? Plus they've established they don't like the responders, which is admittedly kind of dumb.

Nope. Supposed to be fixed in patch 21

I‚Äôm not getting overly really demolished just needed some tips for long run
---
I reckon everyone who reads this should stop by his server and drop him a gift :) Would be pretty cool to have 40+ randoms dropping you loot on your birthday! Just little things like gold frankincense and myrrh would do the trick

This is probably what you are looking for.

Kk but I'll probably just keep using my one og character.
---
Yeah well I hope it fixes for you because I would get pretty mad also if that happened to me. Being the money always goes out no matter what
---
No I totally agree with you it has the best story but worst way of telling it the need to make more bosses and added more bug free implementation and maybe even have some of the moders help with the glitches they probably do some great things for free its just a balancing act if i had to work for free and fix the game i would happily do so if i had a clue of coding and that stuff
---
There are a LOT of people posting items for sale at the default price the game pops up. No idea what they are thinking; can‚Äôt possibly be moving much merchandise, except for the astonishingly underpriced legendaries that I buy for scrip.
---
Agreed. Shit idea.
---
If people want pets and mounts go actually *play* those faggy fantasy MMO that have that crap.
---
Not mention the programming side. Even ESO (for instance the Sunspire trial) couldn't handle twelve players with pets out and run properly. 
---
This game would implode if twenty peeps hit a SBQ fight with twenty pets, and players on twenty mounts. Fuck it'd never work.
---
I don‚Äôt think they can, or dupers would find a way to heavily exploit it somehow.
---
It's communication it's....intent. 
---
I like him, he's a bit nutty, but fun to have in a camp for a while.
---
How many "SCORE" points is that?
---
And that's a repeatable event, right?
---
it's an exploit
---
One of the best perk cards. I could literally use 2k on ammo and then put perk on go on a thirty minute run and have almost that back in that time.

What's a mule?

Haha much appreciated, my good friend ü§üüèªüçª
---
Get a metal chest piece and ski sword, should help.  The ski sword(lvl 15)can be found at the ski lodge by the top of the world.  The area is tough but you can run in and out.
---
so u can get banned for it?
---
They did blow the dam and wipe nearly all of us out over a woman.... I feel it was quite the over reaction on David's part...
---
Those are my tips if you‚Äôre early/mid game, just take it easy and enjoy roaming around the world and interact with other players in events. There‚Äôs no point to rush the questlines unless you‚Äôre planning on taking a break from the game and want to finish your questline before you do so.
---
if you‚Äôre below level 70-60 I‚Äôd say then you may want to focus on getting more xp so you can experiment with different perks and builds to find the most suitable one
---
Does anyone have a Junkies FFR sub machine gun?
---
I'm lvl 22 but I'll try and talk to the overseer also thank bolt of you for the help
---
But Meg isn't David, is she?
---
‚ÄòBecause maybe if we weren‚Äôt prisoners to soap, the world would actually be a cleaner place. You dig?‚Äô 
---
Or just imagine some equally, stoned student response to your question.
---
Totally agree with you. I truly love this game. Bought it at launch and truly enjoyed it then but to see how far it has come in that time is also amazing. I wish they would show that they feel the same way we all do and shut the cheaters down.
---
And the trade off is the lack of damage. I‚Äôd also like to add one FC only allows for 500 shots.
---
I had someone build me 2 in my camp before I realized that it‚Äôs an exploit. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll get banned for it but it‚Äôs going to be a permanent structure of your camp, you can‚Äôt move it or delete it
---
As with all exploits.. Yes, it is possible.
---
Is the ski sword good, I already have one
---
Yes.
---
Ahh the imagination, No &amp; No &amp; No!üòÇ

Check out nexus mods, there is/was a mod like that for fallout 4. Contact the mod author to help with getting you started. A lot of mod authors are always open to help. It's called holotime... Google it and contact the author... You never know. Fallout 4 and 76 are almost exactly the same engine. Might be easy to port it over.
---
Ok thank you for you help
---
Yes I've come up with the theory a while back, but it's hard to pinpoint the moment it happens to record or describe to someone what is happening.
---
Just like when your hunger/thirst (H/T) buffs wear off, your characters hp and ap drop but as it happens your character takes "damage" and it seems like your character stubs his toe or his head. I've had this happen more often when switching cells or jumping. I think switching cells decrease H/T similar to fast travel but on a smaller scale. Jumping also seems to decrease H/T quicker as well.
---
Just little things that happen no one really knows why but can't explain what it is.
---
Also minor PSA, remember to not check the atom shop until after you load into an adventure mode server as that is linked to autocompleting challenges
---
I would be down to help anyway I can! Although I don't know much about making a discord, I know lots about making a spreadsheet and I'm always free.
---
Happens to me all the time on PS4.  Most of the time, selecting the Fast Travel options (location &gt; Fast Travel for \_\_c &gt; Yes) super slowly works, but every now and then, I have to sprint until I'm fully away from any enemies to get the FT working.  It's tolerable when I'm alone, but in a group?  Man... very frustrating.
---
So then why‚Äôs there scorched still? Because you‚Äôre wrong
---
My buddy just turns off his Xbox while the game is running an has never gotten the bug. We both go into private first and the public, then nw, then back to private. I've only ever got this twice in my time playing this game an once was immediately fixed the day after an I got all my weeklies back but this was before wastelanders. Only lost 1 daily and I've logged in to the game every day since launch and missed maybe 5 days of logins for a vacation last year.
---
*gathering PTSD from Ahn'Qiraj resurfaces*
---
PS4?
---
Maybe make sure you leveled up your specials too. If you are holding on to a couple, it won't think you are truly level 20 yet.
---
I spent a lot of time trying to kill the yao gai by the alpha silo with the syringer. It took forever so I whittled it down and then finished with the syringer. The knife one isn‚Äôt hard if you are a High enough level over the wolf.
---
Yup.
---
No problem, have a great journey fellow wastelander!
---
Also one additional tip since I just saw from another comment that you‚Äôre level 14 which is very early game. If you don‚Äôt do this already, always make sure to loot corpses of anything you kill and also loot the places you visit. If you come accross any weapon or piece of armor that you don‚Äôt need, pick it up and scrap it to get additional loot and also modifications for that piece. Looting junk will come in handy when you decide to establish your camp. And when you do, make sure to build yourself all the essentials like workbenches, a cooking station, and a few water purifiers. You need a warm home that embraces you out in the coldness of Appalachia, and your camp is going to serve that purpose perfectly
---
What platform?
---
If PC, they can change their name.
---
And judging from their name, it's either a 12yo or 11yo who needs to learn how to spell.
---
That's the entrance to The Deep. The game's pathfinding seems to glitch every once in a while and gives you that as a quest location.
---
Agreed, and there's a blood eagle cabin north west of the vault 79.
---
Me every time, and 8 times out of 10 I cant find a thing lol.
---
everytime i say this people like to think that making both faction camps free fast travels is on the same level of urgency
---
Wait, is this actually a thing?
---
It was a game changer for me at the level.  I used a hunting rifle at distance but if they got close I‚Äôd hit em with the ski sword.  Also if you have extra weapons / armor scrap them to learn mods.
---
I‚Äôm sorry I forgot to include that. He was on PS4. He sounded a little older. Probably mid teens.

Was the headpiece in **any** photos when they advertised? Is the only reason we even know there is a headpeace because of the blank space in the atomic shop?

If I ever need you help again can I reply back to you

Thank you so much!

Are u still using them though my guess is that they are watching to see who abuses it more

Thank you

Yeah for sure man, let me know whenever there‚Äôs something I could help you with
---
In the future just go to bethesda.net
---
Okay thank you for your help
---
No I sided with settlers and at end you can either give cut to them or to both but I kept it all. Lowered both my reps. But I also did all missions before hand and have been maxed on both for a while.
---
Play another game for several minutes. Like fallout 4 for example. Then launch the fallout 76 again. Worked for me.
---
I hope you haven't uninstalled the game yet.
---
I've never seen anyone sell ammo 5 caps a peice. Only the new game passers who know nothing
---
I should be able to loot all nearby containers when I loot, like how you do in ESO.
---
I don't think that's unreasonable.
---
You'll agree with me when you kill a legendary, then something explodes and the legendary corpse just VANISHES (probably underground) üò†
---
Yeah I use it, I do expect a punishment for it but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be a severe punishment like a permanent ban. Maybe they‚Äôll be nice and just remove it or maybe they‚Äôll ban me for a week or so. 
---
If I knew it was an exploit I would‚Äôve rejected that person‚Äôs offer to build me one in my camp, I genuinely thought it was a new thing to the game that I didn‚Äôt have the plan for

Person #9: what‚Äôs the bare minimum i need to give to get those skins/recipes

Sure I can help. Who‚Äôs the best Hokage though?

---
Take it a step further and make armor for the different builds.  Like a berserker set that has  1 Dr and normal resists. Or a wasted set for junkies that gives plus special points per addiction.
---
Yeah, you're a poohead too. Fun stuff!
---
But seriously, what's the reward in it besides time spent and expense? Bigger numbers?
---
That's cool and much appreciatd, it's the people who buy 3 individual bullets I get a kick from.  Recession must be tough in Appalachia, lol.
---
I talked to her and that wotked

I'm on PC.
---
My most embarrassing experience in the game is wiping out the Liberator horde in the Forest with a single Tesla shot, and then casually walking over to the Legendary bot and then..."kaboom"...I'm dead and there's no trace of the bot after that.....for the third time....all for a measly level 5 1* leather arm.
---

---
I would be fine with adopting! I'll keep inventory on who's stuff is who's and I usually play from 10am to 4pm every day. I play on Xbox and my ign is xRockwilderx (family account lol) and I'm always down to go farming for supplies:).
---
Umm? Did u look through my post history? Anyways I think it's either the 1st the 3rd, the 4rth and Lord seventh.
---
Nope it was my username right.
---
I figured that out after converting so much ammo and when I decided to exit the terminal I realized that pressing the back button only brings me back to the previous tab, and that‚Äôs when I knew that I can abuse this to convert ammo faster
---
And an additional tip on the way: in case you didn‚Äôt know, holding the back button gets you to force exit the terminal. I also figured this out for the first time when I converted ammo
---
I mean, it takes time to collect bullets. Rarer bullets like .50 and 5.56 are some of the less common and are less abundant as opposed to 10mm. It makes sense to sell .50 at 5 caps a piece. If you think it isn‚Äôt fair then go farm in areas where enemies drop the bullets you need. Also, an abundance of caps is almost always needed
---
Pay no attention to whoever that is
---
Ignore the apologists.

I would just do a chargeback on the membership if it was me and I had paid for a full year of FO1st and it was over 30 day and you can't play.
---
I don't recall now, but I am not certain you have to accept their TOS when you pay for FO1st through xbox live for example. 
---
In any case I have heard many have been successful on xbox at least with chargebacks being accepted by MS.
---
Thank you for this. I feel like this is what I‚Äôve been hoping for
---
Cool Idea, like Horde mode on Gears of War
---
Great idea.  While you're at it, make it a major quest line that takes a lot of work, but is a good story and isn't grindy.  And make it non tradable so even if they are duped it won't matter.  And why not make it a 4 star weapon?  Make it super special, with levels up to 100 to make things easy.
---
Yeah username gave it away lol. Shame, Tobirama is my favorite and you skipped him entirely

I sell all ammo, minus the heavy stuff, for 1 cap. I don't sell fusion cores, missiles mini nukes and such because of their weight and nobody buys them anyway.
---
I retain and then sell every other ammo type though because somebody somewhere always buys the lot they need for a cap each. And I'm constantly restocking.
---
Sucks when your friends aren't on and you wanna mule something.
---
Even then you shouldn't have to hassle your friends to do this for you.
---
And I really don't wanna bother them just to load a bunch of junk onto a mule.
---
Agreed. I'm not a programmer but I do feel like there are fundamentals you would follow if you want a successful game, if you wanted a "real" economy, if it was supposed to be "competitive". I mean take a look at Borderlands. Great game but it's boring because every single thing has been duped to hell and back; but you can play the game legit and it is the greatest feeling finding your first sham or DP Harold. Then there's Diablo 3 where you could play for months and still keep finding gear better than your last and decking it out with crystals and upgrading your crystals.
---
Beth needs to decide if they want a survival game or a sandbox.
---
They should convert the character models of a known dupers into a Scarlett D
---
That's some sad news to hear. I was just farming ticks stimpaks.
---
Most people that get this don't play anymore.  Many that are left will make any excuse for the company that manages to screw EVERYTHING else up constantly, but banning, sure they get that right.  LOL.
---
they could add a debuff with radiation, bc it makes your life so simple to maintain the low health threshold that you need to trigger nerd rage and all the good stuff below 25%.
---
if the bloodied build was only a thing were you can use it only for the time while you are low and deal exceptional damages it would be balanced bc you need certain conditions but having rads in your health bar you have that condition forever and easy.
---
if they make rads, for example, to consume your life each 5 seconds after 50% then you would need a vampire bloodied which is even rarer and tons of radaway, the build still viable but bothersome to mantain bc you are constantly in need of healing yourself and becomes expensive if you use it all the time.
---
It just took me 3 days to sell 100 2mmEMC rounds at a whopping 0 caps a piece. Player vendors really are just an enigma no matter what end of them you're on.

I did pass that check but she specifically said there was still a feeling of something else still being there in the back of her head (something along those lines), but the pain was nothing like before and easy to deal with and that she was happy A.T.H.E.N.A. got a chance to live.

Exactly.

Tho I was using ESC to close it.
---
I got the impression from reading various posts that a lot of folks weren't figuring this out before declaring it "too frustrating to use" (which it very well might still be, I haven't decided).
---
i'm just waiting for the rework before using it again. Hopefully they buff the amount of ammo you get as well because at the minute it is better to sell your ammo and buy ammo
---
Yeah I wish It was more like destiny
---
There's no risk for running a full health build though, with bloodied with UNY it's high risk/high reward. Vanguard's secret service with buttressed mod armor has decent DR
---
Just to let you know for the last two weeks if not more where you see that clock there has been a new discount every day. Like today clock yesterday a player icon and they had free states skin another day. I like what they‚Äôve been doing with a new one everyday

Oh sorry. I really like the Uchiha clan the otutsuki clan the hyuga clan the uzumaki clan and the senju clan. even though I like the clan I just don't think they are all that powerfull. (*BTW I AM SHARING MY OPINION DONT TAKE IT SERIOUSLY*)
---
I‚Äôm on PlayStation so basically ESC is just me holding the back button lol
---
And honestly even with using the technique you mentioned, it‚Äôs still frustrating  having to go through the menu 10s and possibly 100s of times. But thankfully the next patch is going to fix that so no more ammo clicking simulator

That's really interesting, let's get Angry Turtle on the research.

This is good to know!! Thank you for this

I have a very similar pic of her majesty in repose after we ran a train on her.. pic quality looks pc but by happenstance was it on Xbox?
---
Honestly, your best bet is to make a mule character, and have them level enough to get pack rat 3, grab a piece of junk weight armor for them and have them hold it until you turn it in.
---
Junk is one of those things that gets so heavy when you are talking about the quantities needed for this event that you really can't manage it in a stash unless that is all you do.

oops just now saw this but it‚Äôs kaellla if you ever wanna hop on and help

Same here. I figured I'd take one last look - but ah, too late.

Another tip is to hold down Tab to exit the screen quicker when you are done.
---
You don‚Äôt enjoy converting 3 railroad spikes at a time?
---
Unfortunately not Xbox. You were right on the money with PC though!
---
Oh look ^^^ common sense.  That shit's refreshing.
---
I put him in the pompadour and the pink suit! The hair suited him, I thought.
---
I'm so tired of "the dupers" being an excuse to dismiss features that would be fantastic additions to the game. Just start permabanning them and allow for appeals. Duping is extremely hard to do accidentally, and even if you do stumble upon it you make the choice to continue doing it, there's no way to feign ignorance when it comes to continuously exploiting a duplication glitch. "How was I supposed to know the artillery box shouldn't be popping out copies of my legendaries?" doesn't fly.
---
Yeah berserker reducing your guns base dmg because of armor is just bullshit. 
---
The only real way to make the current effect viable is to have legendary clothing/costumes that have no armor like the bugged free radicals mask.
---
Until people still have loads of duped items to dupe with again when they inevitably find a way and thus loads of insane rolls on items happen via exploitation again.
---
If you've played nuclear winter enough to report hackers like 357 and anyone with +_- in their name, you know that Bethesda might as well send you a laugh.mp4 as a reply to your report.

They have no incentive to do so when people can pay $13 for a janky workaround.  But apologists downvote this fact.

Still not working as of July 31 - I'm on PC version.  I had started the game over with a new character and it worked fine on my old ones.  I'm at level 23 on this latest one and all she does is complain about her back.  I'm starting to think she's related to my ex-wife.  
---
I've been trying for a couple of days now.
---
Ok, thanks I'll take a look at the other stuff.
---
awesome thanks!
---
Line in the sand has been popping up a lot for me lately. A lot of scorched to shoot in that one.
---
Doesn‚Äôt pop up as often, but Radiation Rumble is really good for xp too. Even if you don‚Äôt have enough people to complete the event. A ton of ghouls to fight.

With the ammo converter (though it‚Äôs a pain ita) I no longer sell those heavy ammo.   .38 is free, as always.
---
With the ammo converter (though it‚Äôs a pain ita) I no longer sell those heavy ammo at 1.   .38 is free, as always.
---
Put away weapon, and switch weapon.
---
Okay see you tommorow.
---
Yeah, I saw there was a tweet saying they have improving it on the agenda. 
---
I don't really mind nasty conversion rates, as long as they make it where you can sell or buy any arbitrary amount of a single type in one transaction (assuming you aren't going over cap or out of points, obvs).
---
There is zero evidence that anyone has gotten banned for this. Sure, it most likely wasn‚Äôt intended to happen that you could blueprint the ammo maker and some other workshop things, but this has been known for quite some time with nothing being done to patch it. They‚Äôve never banned anyone for camp building glitches. Not foundation pyramids, not floating or underground camps, not build budget glitch camps, or camps with merged items. They‚Äôll simply fix the main issue (being able to blueprint those things) and then let the players deal with the consequences. In this case, being stuck with those taking up a portion of your budget permanently. So I wouldn‚Äôt use this glitch at your own camp, but workshops are another story
---
You know what you‚Äôre right, the who pile effect is cool and all, but it would become just such a huge convenience if it would disappear when it‚Äôs looted.
---
They've been padded out into trades for several months now, it's not just dupers who have them!
---
Exactly they are simply too easy to find... I even put .38 at 0 caps because of the low rarity level
---
I sell all ammo for 1c as well. These days ppl aren't buying my shells though &gt;:(
---
Its just reddit votes bruh
---
Awesome. I did the same with my Xbox character. Did everything except the silo then lost any incentive to 
---
continue. 
---
Started on pc with wastelanders. Finished all the new stuff and the old and started to get into the end game grind (getting all the perks not just for my build but for every possibility like green thumb, scrapper, contractor, home defense, ammo smith, super duper, etc), collecting gear, plans, recipes, making my camp and refining it, the legendary run, bullion, legendary scrips, selling junk. Still having fun doing random stuff
---
Yeah but thats why you delete them then clown on the dupers
---
I have 1st, but I've only had it for the past few days and I was getting these before I had it.
---
This forum IS a stickied list of known bugs. Bethesda just need some devs on the dev team to do some devving.

If you are under level 35 slow down and level up

I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm a little new to the game and I‚Äôve gotten 100 treasury notes and some gold. What do I do with it?

NO! DON'T DO IT!

You can pacify robots using a perk, Robot Expert I believe. But you can‚Äôt build them, and it‚Äôs only temporary, I believe.

Leaving players who have given up legitimate trades for them with nothing?

Sorry, BOS are only coming to subscription?
---
Hey if they haven't used them thats there fault

Yep, that's what I was trying to say. I've seen people say they only check on Tuesdays so I wanted to spread the word that they should be checking every day.

May i ask why their name matters?

I‚Äôll be on tomorrow if you‚Äôre around. My ign is Zoreandr. I might have some low level items you can sue to level up easier too

That would be awesome! I will be able to write notes containing my erotic fanfiction for everyone to enjoy!

To help people spot the cheaters that aimbot or travel through parts of the map with a no clip, or just generally grief with cheats. The block system also doesn't seem to work properly after a reload if your squad all haven't blocked the people who are cheating.
---
I actually do have an AA 25 plasma on my rifle alt. It's just the thing is barely a quinary weapon option, but that's most likely because I run it as a flamer. As with most things I attribute it to user error. I just cant justify using it as anything more than a toy because even an AA 25 combat rifle was killing schorched beasts in a couple of shots, and its ammo goes for cheaper. I love the idea of a plasma pistol shotgunner though. Maybe I should wall it, and start selling the ammo.
---
I think you‚Äôll never get a group of people to do that.
---
Bring build able robots from fo4. I want my robot!
---
Fast travel to an event
---
Meaning you want to know what events can drop them?
---
The Scorched Plague is already caused by Fungus...
---
The Spores are generated and spread by Scorchbeasts. Literally everything in this game with "Scorched" in it's name is exactly the thing you are asking for: Fungus controlled Zombies.
---
I‚Äôve been wanting to make this post. Thanks for doing it.
---
What to do if a legendary SB falls into the pit of summoning? Shit happens waaaay to often.
---
I applaud your laziness. Well done. *nods admirably*
---
yes, as long as it is a regular container. Containers built at your camp work differently. When players try to access containers at your camp, they only access their own person stash.
---
Ok cool I like both the charts given. Guess I didn't think they would be broken down like that on a wiki... whoops!
---
Leave the area for a few minutes and lollygag somewhere else. Come back after and it should be a meat pile somewhere on the ground with flies buzzing around.

It sounds like a Brotherhood of Steel Junkie wanted to get clean so they dumped their chem stash..... Good for them!
---
I may have a plan in my vendor.

honestly i‚Äôd have told you to shut your mouth and muted your ass

What platform you play on?

Started to just run in and mash E or whatever button you have to quickly grab the loot

The Presents are already an integrated part of this game's wonky Economy. They're frequently traded for items of value.

Removing them at this point would be like destroying a huge amount of money from circulation.
---
Some players didn't put any points in charisma. Now It seems like an error because public teams have transform the way people see this SPECIAL section but lone players used to have the mandatory point in charisma and you're not able to share with any less than three. Low levels neither use to have enough charisma to share
---
I always sell all of my ammo for 1 cap, of every kind so you‚Äôre welcome :)
---
I usually wear the lumberjack hat it goes well IMO
---
Forgot what it's called, but there is something that acts as a Pip-Boy for your active character. When playing or not you can change equipment, read Holotapes/ play Holotape games, and eat or drink food. It's pretty cool but it's literally just a Pip-Boy on your phone that's linked to a single character.
---
That and if someone has any extra I‚Äôd like to buy them off them.
---
You could always buy him a month of FO1st if he doesn‚Äôt have it, it‚Äôs not expensive for a single month, he will get some free skins to keep, and a survival tent and unlimited junk storage for the month he has it. Also I do believe you 1650 atoms. It costs $13 so the atoms you get are worth $16.50. Just saying if you wanna get him currency is better financially to go that route.
---
Nope, I only check it on tuesday for the free item.  It's just the same old crap they have otherwise.  If I wanted it before, I would have gotten it.  They need to come out with better items and more new stuff, not keep recycling the same crap from a year ago, over and over.
---
It's a grammar thing so thanks for helping me get my point across.
---
Fusion core battery packs are cool
---
Once you have completed the wastelanders quest, you can go to a gold vending machine at either the Crator or Foundation and transform the treasury notes into bullion gold (20 is the daily limit). You then spend the bullion gold points to buy armor and weapon plans. There is a vendor for this at Crater, Foundation, and Vault 79. The plans available at the Crater and Foundation are reputation locked so you have to get to a specific reputation with those factions to purchase them.
---
Go read the ITVs, they have it all
---
Wow...great tip. I had no idea that would work. Thanks.
---
Or when people don't let the Queen land because they are permastunning her
---
What is the wastelanders quest?
---
Yeah it's not the worst thing in the world, but still a pain.  I've got Toxic Goo on my favorites wheel to bring me back under 20% and when AquaBoy is equipped (or shared), literally nothing happens.  Goo doesn't even restore thirst, it just explodes into nothingness.  Easy enough to replenish goo, WesTek is a nightly excursion to level up for the Legendary Run, but still a slight speed bump.
---
For sure!
---
So the cavalry arrived to save the cavalry...
---
A few reasons why I don't have hope for more mechanicly difficult things (even though I wish we could):
---
1. The "average" player is an idiot, see: rad rumble, encrypted, paradise.  Anything that's not "point and click" is apparently to difficult
---
2. See 1
---
*Note: because of raids removal I have very little hope that the upcoming expeditions will be more than a shooting gallery.  The biggest complaint outside of __server__ lag was that people didn't like the "puzzles."
---
Things I disagree with about the post :
---
1. Why just ranged damage? Melee can dish out massive amounts of damage per swing and are not that far behind ranged weapons
---
2. Stop balancing around bloodied, there are tons of builds possible, why are we balancing based on the 1 specific best-at-everything build
---
*Still would like to see more mechanic related things though*
---
Everything needs a balance right now. Bloodied makes you a demigod with so many stacking bonuses that it more than compensates for the low health. Junkie's is second to best with basically no downsides. Other effects like nocturnal, ____ slayer, etc are all right but literal downgrades from the main few effects. Berserker's is probably its own tier because it's like the inverse of bloodied, instead of stacking bonuses making you OP it has stacking negatives turning you into a wet noodle
---
Bartering isn‚Äôt allowed here. 
---
But for drops, look at Distant Thunder.
---
Somone advised me to move forward, then backward, then as you're moving backward hit the button to exit your armor. I don't kbow why but it seems to work.
---
Best bet is wait for the super sale or check the market pages.
---
Armour or perks that convert your DR into extra damage would be nice, and you could tailor that effect to your preference. Want more survivability? Take half your DR and convert it into extra damage. Want to be a glass canon living on the edge? Equip a full set with this effect and/or rank up the perk to max and get the full benefit.
---
I think there‚Äôs enough mind control creatures. The Scorchbeasts, stranglerhearts, and flatwoods monster.
---
They also need to add ultra ammo to the converter since I have more than 1k .44 ultra and need .45 ultra instead
---
There are 2 other perks that do different things:  
---
* Pharmacist - RadAway removes 30%/60%/100% radiation
---
* Field Surgeon - RadAway works more quickly
---
Does Chem fiend make RadAway work more quickly, or does it make it remove more radiation?
---
I got a bloodied handmade today, im on ps4 thoüòê
---
I just sell most of the ammo that I don't use for 0 caps. There are a lot of ammo types that I just don't use because my character is a rifleman build. e.g. shotgun shells

---
PS4
---
Thanks! I'll get that a try next time. It's been a nuisance.
---
Wasnt really tailored to ranged damaged, just needed an example for my point. But yes, more game mechanic related events.
---
I think dungeons would be cooler. Add in some content you need a group to knock out or branching paths that you can‚Äôt just solo.
---
I just bought a Bloodied Hunting Rifle with bashing damage and faster movement while aiming. I'm not thrilled with the compared to my other bloodied weapons. It's yours if you want it.

Oh f@ck yes.. dungeons would be a most welcomed addition

My only friend is a empty Ketchup bottle named Miranda, but she doesn't have a FO76 account :(
---
Two quest lines. You will unlock the Raiders quests from the main quest line, by helping Rose the robot (be warned, her quests are long, ridiculous, and annoying). You should complete all the Settlers and Raiders quests until you get to the ‚ÄúSiding With Foundation‚Äù and ‚ÄúSiding With Crater‚Äù quests, when you decide who to break into a Vault with. Then do whichever you think will be more fun. I recommend the Settlers, because the Raiders have two daily quests and the Settlers only have one, making grinding reputation more difficult. I also suggest splitting the gold between the two factions so you earn reputation with both factions at the end of the main quest.
---
Melee takes 0 ammo
---
"Draw me like one of your French girls"
---
Try taking workshops, you don't even have to keep them, just taking them gives you quite a bit of stuff.
---
I used to visit lots of player vending machines, (also on xbox) and found plenty of decent bloodied rifles while playing. Grind the vending machines for a few days and you should find one, alternatively hit the trade pages.
---
Ohhhhh thank you so much. I fucking hate rose and her quests
---
She is very annoying, yes.
---
MODUS isn't the entire Enclave, really just the Appalachian chapter head. 
---
Vault-Tec, like many other pre-war titan industries, is very corrupt. Nearly every single vault was designed to actually be secret experiments on the dwellers that resided in them. Its definitely plausible Vault-Tec had connections and allegiances with the Enclave. 
---
The Enclave are basically the FO equivalent of the Illuminati, and controlled the world through various means. They're essentially always the villains of whatever story is being told, and Vault-Tec fits right into that category. Secret villains pulling strings like puppet masters, just to watch the tethered dance for their amusement and experiments
---
Never.  Never ever ever.
---
Just... why?
---
of course, as everyone else has said, fixer and lever, handmade, etc are top as you know, however a bloodied pipe revolver rifle can SLAM. i have a bffr one and i could be wrong but i think it hits near as hard as a lever and someone mentioned it might benefit from both rifleman and gunslinger rn but i have not confirmed that. might be fun to mess with
---
Okay. Didn‚Äôt know that sorry but do I start it or does it just start on it‚Äôs own bc I‚Äôve never seen it before
---
it‚Äôs still a feature filled games, no bugs
---
Just make an alt and transfer the unused junk there its a great way to storage things i have like 2 alts that carry all my unused weapons and junk
---
In that case, just make the account box available only to those with FO1st. It is still better than the alternative.
---
You could get one for her. When is her birthday?
---
Acid and poison DOT will also kill you outright since you continue taking damage after you would be "downed'.
---
I thought the timer was there when there was an enemy nearby? Sometimes my timer counts down and when i am hit or in danger it stops.

You, sir, are an absolute genius.

Heart of the Swamp is the worst for this issue, thanks for the tip, will try it next time I‚Äôm stuck in the mire!
---
Bethesda - we hope you are enjoying the game features, your doing it all right
---
Yes please my friend hasn't been on in two days so I have a bunch of stuff to switch around for everyone
---
I would have agreed but there have been instances where it didn't matter how long they have been a ghoul to become a a glowing one, but it's more or less how much radiation they've been around and for how long.
---
So where is your data that backs up your claim?  I submit that you are grossly overestimating the percentage of steam users to other platforms.  You came here to debunk my estimate that around 400K players exist across all platforms and specifically that steam users outnumber Bethesda Launcher users.  What reference are you basing this on?  Conjecture?  Speculation?
---
Explain this with your maths.

IF every player averaged 25 masks (they didn't).. you can extrapolate 345,860 players ground fasnacht.  That doesn't even include the players that didn't participate in fasnacht but still play the game.
---
Melee and crafting are your best friends in this situation. Lots of things you can craft, both ammo and health stuff.
---
You know since we haven‚Äôt had it for so long, it‚Äôs going to be amazing getting it back.
---
Till they add the next faction
---
Go ahead! Right now the only set bonuses for PA are for the excavator and strangler heart.

Yeah thats a problem youll have as a low level when i started the game i had issues with ammo and stims too but s high level player helped me out a little bit if youre on ps4 and want some help, i could give you some ammo and stims and radaway
---
This seems to be a common problem as of late .
---
That's honestly amazing, I don't think I'd be able to get lucky enough to have the window open at the right time for that. I was wondering g when I was looking at the pictures if they may have had filters.
---
Oh, will you be on in the next few ours?  PS4?
---
But i see you are in a halo community so youre probably xbox
---
This is why we can't have nice things.
---
The only real benefit of berserkers is getting something for trying to cheap out on armor repairs. That's a paltry, bad benefit.   
---
I would increase its damage to at least 200% for starters. Maybe allow DR from perks.
---
Back when the holiday emote came out . I went to them for a return on the emote cause back then it was JUST a icon , no snow or bell noises . They let me keep it and gave me back the atoms. And honestly the lady I talked to was totally cool . Note that costed 2400 atoms .
---
Ah, well thanks for the confirmation, I was losing hope
---
Thanks!
---
since you dont seem to get it- the point is that .38 ammo is literally worthless, but when levelling .308 can run low. Poorer, lower level players will benefit from slapping a .38 receiver on their sniper rifle/huntin' rifle to burn through it.
---
Best way is to use melee builds until youre able to farm lead, steal, cloth and acid those are the most important junk you need for ammo crafting lead and steal for the bullet, acid and cloth for gun powder,
---
Most other bulk items are just weight neutral.
---
Believe it or not, there are new players who haven't seen some of these items before.
---
Fallout 1st - Account Bank. Easy benefit. Easy money. Bethesda.
---
Yes that is orobably it. Go to atomic shop and deselect it.
---
Another use of apt account is for Nuclear Winter. The SPECIAL points can be very different depending on your PvE vs NW play style. I would also say it‚Äôs good to have PvP char for certain occasions but that‚Äôs becoming less and less relevant. I can justify 2 or 3 characters that aren‚Äôt just for muling or leveling/challenges.
---
Totally agree I feel the community is really holding this game back. Just project paradise alone shows the potential we had for future content such a shame the community acts like they never played an mmo before
---
This is one of those, "Oh gees mon, I KNEW THAT!!!!! Why did I not think of that on my own???"
---
Thank you very much! Never under estimate the power of stating the obvious.
---
That‚Äôs how it was like for me when I first started.  Then you start amassing resources and caps.  I now make a lot of both or buy them from vendors.
---
Just wear a chinese stealth suit and destroy it, you cant take it off you after that but it will have 0 dr/er and it will still be stealth,they cant shoot what they cant see.
---
I prefer my minigun, but I think its hard to get that kind of build early or mid game.  I started with rifle and transitioned to minigun, which is what I would recommend.  Eventually fusion cores are pretty easy to find.  Pa has amazing damage and especially radiation resistance compared to non pa.  Also because of some really good perks, pa is a must for heavy gunners.  I prefer the gauss minigun, which you get from some pretty bad guys for some shiny stuff.
---
You consider fallout 76 an mmo?
---
How?
---
It's been a while since I've played but didn't ESO have this feature?
---
Ya, it's when they simply go "POOF" right in front of your eyes. Not rolling away, not stuck in a tree ....poof .... inter-dimensional transfer to fuckyouville
---
Can you access the map? If so, respawn to vault 76, that's always worked for me
---
Fallout 76 already has problems when people move too fast, the game cant support high movement speeds.
---
Nope. :)
---
Go to C.A.M.P. items and scroll to find this and press X (if on PS4 I don't know what on other systems) to unequip.
---
What's strange is that they give seemingly no benefit.
---
I learned this on my own last week, I was so happy to see the emote pop up and immediately bought it with my atoms!
---
My hero!
---
Man that robot is dedicated.  Going lengths to gather the freshest ingredients for his next dish.
---
Ur not the only one, happened to me tonight too. Happens at the Encryptid event as well.
---
Go melee, and craft stims or ammo. Take workshops and do small events. You can equip the Pharma Farma perk and farm the Morgantown Airport for lots of aids. At low level you will always have a struggle finding all of these, and once you hit level 50+ you will want to get rid of most of them. So don't despair! Keep your hopes up.
---
Check on DN I think they know
---
Childish
---
If wastelanders is any indication of how the release will go, then six months after the date they‚Äôve said it will lol
---
Ikr. been using gun fu in its place but it's just not the same
---
It is working on the PTS.  We should get the fix with patch 21.
---
Hey, I just let her do whatever she wants to do. If she wants to walk around with a prison collar and no clothing, that is her business.
---
I don't kink shame.
---
I can‚Äôt do gun fu...  so used to switching targets manually that I wind up shooting at their legs. LOL
---
Rumor has it that scarecrows will be targeted first. So I‚Äôve set them up strategically in clear line of site with at least two turrets
---
I didn‚Äôt even know there was a mask until you posted this. Lmao
---
I'm just here to see the downvotes you get because of your dumb responses lol
---
I‚Äôve heard that their news is weak and not very well structured. Lacking content and not able to satisfy any of their audience. The last time someone brought up that particular source it was a bit of a laughing stock. 
---
I can‚Äôt remember what the initials stand for, though. What was it again?  Refresh our memory, please.
---
I'm pretty sure I've read that the system pulls your unbroken down junk first.
---
Might have to put it in a display case to.avoid it.
---
Great advice! what if the floor eats their bodies tho? That‚Äôs the problem I‚Äôm having.
---
I think its split up into 3 parts. 2 parts in the fall and 1 in the winter
---
The first part is just rebuilding atlas. Part 2 maybe the arrival of the rogue detachment, or the decrypting of incoming transmission from the BoS
---
Part 3 is either the arrival of the rogue detachment, or a type of BoS civil war. Kinda like F3 with Lyon's BoS vs Outcasts
---
Gt narmyknight, Xbox, fo1st. Im on throughout the day and early evening(arizona). Im game to help someone store junk.
---
With no real downsides to running a glass cannon build why wouldn't you run it. There is no survivability when your only downside is losing the junk you can find again.
---
Ive collected on them after they explode almost every time, they drops dont disappear after it blows.
---
Shock collar 'shocked' or just the regular kind?
---
I'll... I'll show myself out. It sounded better in my head...
---
I sell all ammo for 1 cap each (outside of fusion and plasma cores which I sell for 25 caps each if full).
---
Except that time I crafted 5K ultracite .45 then decided not to use it so I charged 2 caps and it eventually sold.
---
Had this happen with my giant mr fuzzy, clean nuka truck amongst other items.
---
... its a feature
---
Why can't they do what ESO does and put everything around into one pile?
---
what's hilarious is if they just made it a combat rifle skin, the combat rifle already uses a rail. it's the handmade that uses the AK style side rail.
---
Maybe the 50calber machine gun
---
Stims are literally everywhere. I had to get the Traveling Pharmacy perk, and even then I'm having to shed (sell) stims every couple of sessions or so.
---
Check every first aid box, they're all over the place. Most quests/events will dump the diluted ones into your inventory for free. And Blood Eagles have a high chance of dropping stims on death, - there's a bunch of level 1's at Hunters Ridge just SW of the vault, you can server-hop these if you need to.
---
I smell a gold bullion themed PA paint down the road......
---
Actually, even a high level toon benefits from a bloodied 38 hunting rifle.. you can still easily one shot ghouls at white springs or wherever you might be murdering unsuspecting individuals.
---
Same here, sounds like a cry baby to me.
---
Right now? People probably think bullets are worth more due to the converter.
---
If they're adding a skin that is gold themed, it needs to be the Pimp-Boy 3 billion. Although for this, I guess it would be the Pimp-Boy 2 billion.
---
Sometimes, if you wait around long enough, the body will turn into a pile of guts and appear on the surface. It might not work all of the time, but I've had it happen.
---
This or find someone who can craft you a heavy metal set. It makes the early levels so easy.
---
I have been tearing open every porta potty ever since I thought to hide in one, and have caught like 5 people doing this
---
absolutely
---
Probably making room for a friend or something like that.
---
Could have just been making room for a friend, or possibly you were sharing a perk card that was detrimental to a player?
---
You the real MVP
---
Todd on a bender
---
They definitely follow you into the train station. Instead, I recommend having marsupial mutation and strange in numbers perk, on a team with another mutated player. Then jump on top of whatever you can for safety.
---
If you're still active I can craft you a decent weapon with some ammo at least.
---
I‚Äôm still on that would be very helpful
---
weapon artisan is for 200% weapon repair   
---
fix it good is 200% armor repair
---
Working for me, if your colour setting are off on your TV you might not be able to see the lighter colour bar over the durability bar. As for gunsmith, level 3 works incredibly well on my TSE GATLING. So nothing wrong with what I can see.
---
There are other ways to heal, too.   
---
If you're in bad shape at the end of a fight, you're better off healing with food, drink, or sleep. Stims are most useful as an emergency heal during fights, but it's a bit of a waste to use them any other time.  
---
Also, carrying multiple weapons, even if you haven't taken any perks in those classes or modded those guns, will make your ammo last way longer.   
---
Early game 10mm/.38 pistol , .308 rifle, and a pump shotgun should get you through most stuff. Worst case scenario, use whatever your enemies are using, and just throw the guns away (or scrap them) when you're out of ammo.
---
The weird thing is- I checked, and nobody joined the group after that. Hell, the guy who kicked me left after a little bit.
---
Can Strange in Numbers end up being detrimental somehow?
---
FML thank God you wrote that, I'd have gone to bed raging. Stupid mistake üòÇ
---
I mixed the perk cards up like a noon. I was thinking of weapon artisan.
---
PSN ID?
---
Gameplay loop. You have a disconnect between gameplay and lore. One thing happens in lore but another happens to make the game fun. A good example: Power armour fuel should last hundreds of years, in game it lasts maybe 20 minutes, this is to make gameplay fun.
---
TOG_Opticz
---
I bought 1 ammo for 5 caps for the daily, because it was an ammo type i used
---
But im like how are you level 140 with these trash prices
---
Fix It Good is for Armor and Power Armor. Not Weapons. You want Weapon Artisan. 
---
Gunsmith doesn‚Äôt affect your weapons durability bar; it stays the same length unless modified by a mode, for example. I like Forceful Stocks because they increase the durability a lot.  Gunsmith simply slows down the degradation, but honestly isn‚Äôt usually worth it. 
---
Use the correct perks for the correct functions and you‚Äôll get better results.
---
Bloodied should be 33% dmg and berserker 80-100%
---
Or junkies +33%, bloodied 66% &amp; berserker 100%
---
Yeah, I mixed them up.
---
Yeah I got them confused. I was really annoyed as well üòÇ FML thank God you wrote that.
---
Well that would help with my storage problems for a few days.
---
Yeah, and that is the fundamental issue. No penalty for death beyond the mildest of inconvenience makes glass cannon builds the only one that matters and throttles all attempts to create team-play.
---
Ah, I see. I just need to be a little patient I guess.
---
I have been finding the increased population of NW to be great stuff, and the score challenges got me back into getting better at it.   
---
I do think the NW challenge should be a selection of tasks: not just one thing, but do one or two of a list of possible things. I find it very frustrating to have to do a revive when a match never calls for it, or to hunt creatures when I am feeling aggressive toward players. You should have a menu of all the possible tasks (revive a guy, kill a guy, kill 3 creatures, use 5 stimpaks, raise overseer rank, survive 20 minutes) so that you are rewarded just for playing NW ("place camps" needs to go, it just means that people slap down camps rapid fire and then DC from match)
---
You sausage.
---
No worries. It happens. 
---
Glad you sorted into it, though.
---
Not participating in a role specific team, sharing a perk he/she didn't like, not sharing a perk, making a spot for someone else, perceived inactivity, didn't like ur name tag, didn't like the prices on your vendors, it glitched, who knows. Just create your own or join another.
---
They wiped my entire account then gave it back to me. I don‚Äôt think I want to play anymore, because only one character was involved and all of my duping was to help out the little people who really couldn‚Äôt get even scraps off of other dupers.
---
Nope. Sorry but if you charge more than the bots do, there's no incentive for me to buy. I can use Grape mentats and Hard bargain on the bots. IDK what some of these people are thinking with what they charge.
---
Lmao only time someone has found me I had a grenade launcher and panic killed myself as the door opened
---
I didn't even think of that hahaha.
---
I can probably help you out tomorrow. My PSN is tracerbullet53. Send me a friend request and I'll make sure to catch up with you.
---
So.Is.The.Fast.Travel.Bug. And I will get arthritis listing the rest. Lol
---
"As a thank you, we'd like to reward you wi-" - CANNOT PLACE ITEM. SELECTED ITEM IS FLOATING
---
For a while I was running naked with a berserker power fist intentionally dying over and over at scorched earth just to get people their revive. During meat week I would die repeatedly in the water to help people get swimmer.
---
I've actually never managed to get that to work. Maybe I'm just unlucky and they clip through the ground/plain despawn for me more often than they "go missing".
---
It DOES show the name, just no corpse or loot option.
---
I was the same way last year. Never played any other fallout game. Still a daily player.
---
Not sure why you're coming to me to complain about being banned for duping?
---
Holy shit I grew up in Tyler county... The ferris wheel looks about the same now... But it's definitely nowhere near a riverbank... Didn't know that was in the game lol
---
It's always the line of 4 porta potties near the blocked off road next to the overpass. I would miss it elsewhere.  
---
I have only seen someone hiding in a Pulowski once.
---
Upvote for sure. All my characters are bloodied and of all the bugs this is the most frustrating. Hell, I‚Äôve had multiple DC‚Äôs, upwards of 4 or 5 a day recently, and that doesn‚Äôt bother me nearly as much as wanting to fast travel to my camp and having select it 7 times... drink some water, walk ten steps, fire a shot, reload, eat something, swap weapons, swap weapons again, walk ten more steps then you can travel.
---
Consider getting an ally. They will roam your camp and help defend it. They work pretty well with turret blind spots too. There are 5 allies in the game. Two that you get at settler or raider HQ, 1 random encounter, and 2 that have their own quest that unlocks at level 20. Truth be told though, most items in camps are cheap to repair so it may be a better idea to just place turrets near high value objects (crops, generators)
---
When was it reskinned?
---
There are so many creative camps out there. But, how come no one ever compliments my camp:
---
Sofia's Pleasure Palace (Strip club, bar, and brothel)
---
I get it, your point about people, who struggle with ammo, it was never the case for me since beta. 50 cal cheapest ammo in the game to make and makes hunting rifle sound like an actual rifle, 38cal more suited for auto rifles. I leveled several characters, and if you using hunting rifle, . 308 is never a problem with such a slow rate of fire, because half the scorched and mutants you kill use hunting rifles.
---
Same! Those 2 are on my list of missing items too... I hope they fix this, but I doubt it
---
Xbox one
---
I wish it did
---
Idk, levelling my sniper, i burned through .308 faster than i could keep up, i flipped 8-10 workshops and zipped around defending them, and the .38 receiver was a godsend.
---
Kudos for the snarky downvote on a new account so i cant reply more. All ass no Class.
---
that's true i do have a bat and a hammer should use them for now but using a shotgun is fun
---
thanks!
---
thanks for the offer but I'm on Xbox
---
It's a rain barrel planter, most likely it's going to be like the sink/well.
---
You can do all that with an inexpensive DLC for Fallout 4, which is a great game.
---
thanks! ill horde those item's from now on
---
Yeah I'm doing that now. Putting it on display. I will go picking the other things when i have the room i guess üòÖ is a pain that this happen tho
---
Those aren‚Äôt negative numbers. All numbers are positive. The negative sign simply means that stat has a reduction applied.
---
Sbq has a weakness to plasma try it with a shotgun mod if you run a semi auto build
---
I go to a public server and drop all the ammo, plans, chems, water and food i dont use in the overseer box in flatwoods. Sometimes ill make lower level weapons with mods and drop them as well. Give new players a leg up.
---
Patch 21, August 4. Should be fixed after.
---
Because waiting the couple of minutes it takes to get into their server is inconceivable?  If this person is really a friend wouldn‚Äôt you wait or are you just stalking people?
---
If you're on PC you can use the enter key to get around this. I originally thought the issue was my mouse until I came across these threads
---
Tell me more about this mask or whatever?
---
Sometimes a power armor suit spawns there and you can wait to hear someone jump into it and kill them while the animation is still going to hop in
---
You on ps4? I may have been to yours a while back.
---
Yep. I love the Gatling Laser, but this issue, though minor, messes with my OCD lol. Last time I used it, I ended up with seven cores with varying charges.
---
I don‚Äôt know the exact reasoning behind this bug, but I recall in Fallout 4, any time you holstered your Gatling Laser or switched to a different weapon, the game would load in a fresh core.
---
it's such a struggle atm lol
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt even like the brotherhood but I find it super lazy that they made custom painted T-51b helmets for the brotherhood graveyard outside huntersville and didn‚Äôt even bother to turn them into paint sets that are available for T-51b or at the very least the helmets
---
I'm not sure I understand?
---
Happens to me quite often, I‚Äôve had someone boot me because I‚Äôm a member of the fo76 filthy casuals sub and sent me a direct message. I just don‚Äôt worry about it
---
... I would‚Äôve killed that robot if it would‚Äôve made her stop complaining about her damn headaches every 3 seconds
---
Trust me. You don't want 10 toons. Lol. I have 2 accounts, with 5 toons on each, all over level 150. Managing inventory, trying to remember what plans you've learned and on which character is a chore in itself. Lets not even talk about grinding out dailies for score. Hah. Not worth the headache in my opinion, was a huge mistake. Lol.
---
thank you
---
what's this ammo farm about? anyone mind shedding some light?
---
They will not DEVELOP this game mode.
---
Yeah I pretty much quit using lone wanderer. After public groups I got the herd mentality serum and stack up on other Charisma perks like bodyguards and magnetic personality.
---
Thank you but do you have any automatic guns?
---
I was very low level when I attempted to steal the egg from Deathclaw island. I would swim to the island to spawn the deathclaw then swim back to the other bank to safely snipe. It was a long arduous process. Apparently my numerous shots alerted a nearby high level player who used the ‚Äúfollow me‚Äù emote. He decided to be my personal body guard and helped me kill it.
---
Nope, PC
---
yeah i've been refining my build a little and was curious because i spend most of my time in public groups now so its good to know that stuff like that is useful now
---
I can make you one but you'll chew through bullets. 2 secs
---
There is a known bug that makes your camp icon disappear if you euip that C.A.M.P. skin.
---
While I‚Äôd like a feature like this, it would give you pretty much infinite storage which doesn‚Äôt play well with FO 1st
---
There are certain perks that really affect bloody builds. If your sharing them sometimes people running a bloody build will kick you.
---
Ok
---
Berserkers isn't all that bad if you put in the legwork and thought into the build. Its a tedious grind, but a very enjoyable build once you get everything flushed out.
---
Thank you for sharing your experiences and opinion. 
---
The ‚ÄòSurvivor Story‚Äô is a reference to some in-game lore.
---
Sorry but have you also got some stims because I have none
---
Junkie‚Äôs for damage, Vampire‚Äôs for tanking. Furious and Anti-Armor also boost damage regardless of health.
---
Heres a comment about my build a made awhile back. Maybe itll help some people.
---
 I run a berserkers, its by far my favorite build. It adds a little danger back to the game. I run a stealth commando build. 
---
- I wear a full set of bolstering sentinel, wood armor ( ill explain why bolstering in a minute ). I break it all so i dont have any DR or ERr at full health. Wood armor is the best stealth armor in the game, besides the Thorn armor. When its shrouded, it literally weighs .45 pounds and gives you sneak bonuses. 
---
- On a side note, if you break all your armor, you cant take your armor off, otherwise youll have to rebreak it all. So you cant wear a radsuit to go into nuke zones. Wear power armor and keep an anti armor weapon around in your stash so you can stand a chance. Or you can get a lead lined backpack, radshield, and rad-x. 
---
- I also wear a Raider sheilded underlining. You can mitigate the DR/ER of it by getting addicted to med-x and wearing a high capacity backpack. This gives you a special boost without an armor increase.
---
- The reason i choose to run bolstering armor is because when you start taking damage, your literally 3 hits from death, depending on whats attacking you. This without your perk cards. Bolstering armor will help you tank damage, the lower your health goes, the tankier you get. It will allow you to take 3X-4X more hits before you die.
---
- While your taking damage, your Berserker's weapons will slowly become useless. So what do you do now? Switch to a vampires weapon, this will allow  to keep yourself alive longer as well as reduce the amount of stims you use. I keep 2 vampires weapons on me at all times. 1 is a laser rifle for ranged enemies, and a gatling plasma with a beamsplitter for those pesky melee attacks.
---
- As far as perk cards go, you basically want every card that can help you avoid damage. This is what my build looks like.
---
 https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3c345fe&amp;d=a72ar2an2pp2la2l71lg2lt2a12ib4eh2l32c72ao0a81sg2pd2pk2pl2&amp;w=&amp;m=1469cf3&amp;nw=&amp;n=Berserker%20Rifleman
---
I run born Survivor to help tank damage as well, i keep a hefty number of Super Stims on me. These used together will keep you alive much longer.
---
- On a side not, my buddy runs a Berserker's as well. His is identical to mine except a few things. He uses bolstering cavalier armor, and also has moving target perk card equipped instead of born Survivor. When he starts taking damage, he runs out of sight to become hidden again. Once hidden, he uses stims to heal up.
---
- I also recommend keeping some phantom devices on you as well and hotkey them. Sometimes things get waaaay out of control and you need retreat. Phantom devices are awesome because they enrage the enemies around you, making them attack each other. This allows you to get away quickly and very efficiently.
---
I really hope this helps you out, id love to see some more Berserker's running around out there. Good luck!
---
Yeah I‚Äôve seen a lot of people having fun with the game just grinding. It‚Äôs really a great thing that a game can be enjoyable for that long for a lot of people
---
I know for a fact that building new CAMP stuff pulls from your stash junk first if you don't have a copy already saved in your budget.
---
I find this out the hard way after moving my camp, lost a lot of my uncommon junk display pieces, very annoying.
---
I use an instigating bashing damage plasma pistol with the scattershot mod to make it a shotty and it shreds things with no shotgun perks. I'm pretty sure this also uses the magic effect.
---
Now see I didn't have the emote yesterday, I had the white dress. I do have the clock today, but I already have it. I always check after 11 central, before I even log into the adventure/private. It a good tip though, cause I know a few people \*my husband\* who only checks on tuesdays or when he sees it on my screen.
---
Yup finished it. Dropped a nuke on Grafton and it‚Äôs stupid monster
---
I can the manage the 5, If you know what you exactly want from a character plans aren‚Äôt a huge bother. I used to play wow and having to manage 8 characters on one server with 4 on another? Now that was something but this seems manageable. Idk i guess i just haven‚Äòt been pushed to that point yet.
---
I've been saying this for ***MONTHS***: They need to add a Berserker's perk/affix kit that acts as an answer to the Bloodied kit and the Stealth kit. There should be perks that key off being in [DANGER] like stealth keys off being [HIDDEN], and there should be perks that get more potent the more enemies surround you while in [DANGER]. 
---
Basically, the Berserker playstyle should be charge in guns blazing, aggro as many enemies as possible, get in close, and essentially **RIP AND TEAR**.
---
Keep in mind, I made this comment over a year ago. So I've made some minor changes to it since then. But this is a great start to a berserkers build, you can further refine it to your tastes.
---
Anyone selling fixer plans?
---
I'll give you what I have. If you want me to join you for a bit Al give you what we come across
---
Well the jokes on them, these can't be moved or scrapped and if you move your camp to get rid of it, it disappears and permanently occupies a portion of your budget and cannot be recovered.
---
Wait that was you thank you man it really helps
---
Ifs amazing this game is still alive
---
Nice power armour btw
---
Yea, the plans dont really become too much of a problem until you want to mod something. Lol. The only real challenge/annoyance is hitting your scrip limit on each character, its just tedious logging in and out.
---
I checked your post history to see if this is bait, and yeah, it totally is (even though you posted about FO76 in r/mmorpg lol). So while I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve got a whole script full of arguments and counter-arguments ready to go, instead of indulging your banality I‚Äôm going to go play the game. I hope you can stop picking fights on the internet and have a nice day instead.
---
I'd like more, too, honestly. Even just a few more would be nice :/
---
Oh I‚Äôm a berserker character too. Problem is a berserker is supposed to be glass cannon like but that‚Äôs not the case. You built passive DR against anything that damages you so your build would perform badly toward late game enemies that will damage constantly via poison or radiation. This lowers your damage and you‚Äôll still be squishy. A tanky glass cannon build ruins the purpose imo.
---
Get enough people together that just might work!
---
Yes, agreed.
---
Ohhh that's bs! Like, instead of using the scraps it use the junk? Doesn't make any sense! I haven't moved recently but I've been decorating so maybe that happened? Idk... Is annoying, This bugs are everywhere üôÑ
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind 10 simply for camp building.  I have 4 camps I will never move and 1 I will move once I find my ‚Äúforever‚Äù spot.  I could try other builds and help me spread out gear a bit, and also would have a reason to buy atom shop stuff.  As it is now, I have no room for anything.
---
Also... happy cake day!! üéÇüç∞üéÇ
---
I have mmo's with 60 plus different characters, if you are not trying to play each super optimal it is not hard. They need to raise the limit, it is a silly low limit
---
This is weird but I *only* experience the traditional fast travel bug on my Bloodied Stealth Sniper character. I play 5 different characters and I NEVER have the fast travel bug on any of the others. Just the Bloodied build.
---
That being said all 5 suffer from the rare crash to "desktop" (I play on XBox) or the kind of funny, fast travel to the wrong location. As in I'm at Abbie's, select to fast travel to Dolly Sods Wilderness and when the loading screen ends I'm at Ohio River Adventures.
---
Yeah. I go hard with scrip farming so that isn‚Äôt too much of problem just tedious as you say. For me i just need Arrows my skyrim 76 character seems to just burn em away.
---
The fuck
---
I noticed that sometimes it says that you have been removed from the team, even though the leader didn't actually do it. I think it bugs occasionally. So you might have been kicked to make room for a friend, as others are saying, or just the game did what it does best...
---
&gt;It's pretty nuts, especially since the damage output of most energy weapons is nothing to write home about
---
*Bloodied Plasma Flamer would like to know your location*
---
If not 10 even like 8 i think would be fair.
---
I have mine spread across 5 characters.  You are showing one thing for sure.  Cork is going to be a bitch to complete on the project.
---
What even is the bug
---
Yup. I have a few characters I've been wanting to make, mostly builds for the defunct raider groups (cannibal build for the gourmands, for example)
---
Its a stealth build, so I dont really take any damage. I can see where bolstering wouldn't be great for any other builds, but works great for a sneak build. Its more of a "in case shit hits the fan" moments. Idk, to each their own i guess. 
---
But I do agree that it does need a slight buff. It should at the very least outperform junkies damage wise. I still remain adamant that they need to make a berserkers armor effect. It removes all resistance, and gives you a flat damge boost or damage mitigation like sentinel or cavalier.
---
I'm kind of OCD about my inventory and stuff. Lol. Its a curse, I couldn't juggle that many toons without visiting an asylum afterwards.
---
Good luck. Honestly I would say save your camp budget and hoard to repair your camp. Stay away from SB sites/fissures. I have the best turrets, whole place is brighter then the sun... and my camp still gets chewed on by mongrels, molerats, sometimes the ghouls spawn inside the actual camp. And even though Im NO WHERE near a fissure site... a scorch beast finds my home once in a blue moon. Turrets are also a pain in the ass... I've had them skip beyond the super mutants and continue to hit my collectron... why, maybe he's an ass while Im away cleaning up Appalachia, I don't know. Where im at I always have either a scavenger/treasure hunter. There are times I come home and my turrets are killing the dude for no reason. But let me tell you... the rabbits where I live do not last a second. My turrets are over them like gravy on mashed potatoes thanksgiving morning. Get an ally. They are about as useless as turrets, but at least they try. DON'T get the musician ally. That's all she does... sits in that damn chair... playing that damn guitar... humming Tales from the Crypt... playing that damn guitar. And no matter how many times you shoot her will she leave that chair or guitar. :) Good luck in the wastelands and have fun. \*Don't get the musician, she's E V I L.\*
---
Oh thanks, I had no idea it was my cake day lol. 
---
Yeah it pulls from the junk in your stash, even if it's not broken down before digging into stuff that's already broken down or in your scrap box.
---
It‚Äôs been this way for a month
---
My lower level characters get kicked constantly but my 150+ never do. Like others have said, it could be anything. Doesn't like your name, camp, build, etc.
---
It‚Äôs not you specifically, I‚Äôm just pissed and you‚Äôre the unlucky bastard that had to hear me bitch about it. Especially since almost all the people unbanned didn‚Äôt even get inventory wipes, let alone entire account wipes.
---
I hear you on that. My bow build is always running out of arrows. Lol. 90% of my camp budget is corn, mutfruit, and tatos. Im sure people see it and just laugh thinking I don't need all that... but I do. Lmao. Its pitiful
---
That's the difference. If you want too optomization, more toons is headache. If you want "I want to run around like a fifties guy beating people with pool cues" no head ache.
---
Fr why dont people do a little research first
---
Interesting, thanks for sharing!
---
Sorry to say this but we can‚Äôt do anything about it and nobody cares
---
It‚Äôs not even that, I‚Äôve seen some posts where the people have made previous posts about it or have had it happen multiple times and they just use the sub as a place to complain
---
Mothmam cultests. Then the tunnel snakes.
---
I regularly clean mine out except for the most valuable scraps like Black Titanium. 
---
You can‚Äôt sell steel scrap, so you have to bulk it first. But most everything else if it‚Äôs over 100, I‚Äôll vendor it if I am just trying to get my caps.
---
Haha I gotcha. But if you're a duper I can't sympathize. I say perma ban all dupers, but I know that's a huge chunk of player base. Glad they did something about it this round.
---
You know if is only for building or crafting things too? Sorry I ask a lot. Just to have it in mind. Thanks!
---
There are some days when a girls just gotta lay back and soak up some rays. [https://imgur.com/Hga1YHL](https://imgur.com/Hga1YHL)
---
Bethesda is definitely aware of it so just stop bitching
---
My ‚Äúforever‚Äú spots are just any spots with a junk pile heh. I like to customize my character‚Äôs look often but for example My first responder character using the Responder PA and Responder pump shotgun skin (Looks great) but now i don‚Äôt really ever have a need to change it. Where my Bloodied unarmed is always changing his look.
---
What about strong back? I play solo 95% of the time and do not have many peeks that help others
---
N/M don‚Äôt have 9 charisma to share it lol
---
Why is there no murderhobo option? We are a vault of murderhobos who drop nukes on West Virginia indiscriminately.
---
I think I can I will double check gamertag xtxsxxesrx
---
Like so many things..
---
Doesn‚Äôt sound like the worst bug to have. These challenges are feeling a little grindy.
---
Thanks for the suggestion appreciate it
---
Heh. It‚Äôs not much, but it‚Äôs apocalyptic work.
---
Same here thought was just me till I remember changing skins when I moved üòí
---
Lmao. I see what your saying. I dont really do that role play kind of thing. My thing is more character builds, and min maxing them to perfection. All my toons are geared towards a certain playstyle, with very specific legendary weapons, armor, and perks. I think the character building in this game is the main reason I've stuck around since beta. Always coming up with new ideas. If I had a toon for every build I've thought of or designed, I'd have over 20 or 30 toons. Lol.
---
1)Go to install directory ({install_drive}:\program files\modifiablewindowsapps\fallout 76), 
---
2) copy project 76.ini to c:\users\{your_username}\documents\mygames\fallout76
---
3) right click Project76.ini, click properties, check box that says "read only" then click apply.
---
Follow the steps every time you want to launch it.
---
or open the project76.ini in the documents folder and it will be in your quickaccess when you open windows explorer where all you have to do is open windows explorer and right click followed by checking read only, bypassing steps 1 and 2.
---
If you need more help send me a PM.
---
I predict this will be very game changing and buggy by the end of this event
---
I stopped playing when I couldnt repair my weapons anymore.
---
I've been avoiding working on a second character purely to avoid any weirdness with the Legendary Run (I know there's no exact proof or guarantee of what causes the auto-complete bug, but I've seen a person or two mention that all they did was switch characters and they lost challenges, so I'm erring on the side of caution). Still, your suggestion does seem like the most effective way to hold more junk outside of picking up 1st. I've got a second character at level 21 or so, so maybe I'll use them to hoard some cork or something.
---
Or maybe 1st for a month is a more efficient option, simply because I'm playing both this AND Neverwinter Online, and I've gotta be as effective in both in the quickest way possible if I want to make the most of any daily play. (Man, I miss when games didn't feel like homework. XD)
---
Or always share ones to remove rads to annoy bloodied.
---
But it's just ammo its basically the one you get from the raiders quest line but it makes ammo a little faster it's not ruining the game for other people because most of the time people have them unlocked so people can take it but it's not really hurting anyone it's just something if you need a little more ammo or want to give ammo to people who go to your camp not trying to be rude but just saying
---
üòÜ

I like how everyone complains about her dialogue and it's a meme but for me her dialogue does not repeat nearly as much and has actually been pretty varied and spaced out. so /shrug

The bad thing is he always says they have more than enough to spare

Well if he doesn't have it maybe the tricentennial pack, or the raider/settler bundles. If he does have them you can always buy atoms/fallout 1st or get him a nuka cola quantum from amazon. If your interested, you could always hit up the wastelands with him...
---
Imma be honest I didn‚Äôt even see that I could share perks the first day it was out. It‚Äôs just not really that obvious I guess. But yes, share perks. Unless you share any perks that heal rads - that‚Äôs not good for bloody builds
---
Can i join you soon?
---
This is me Person 4. I knew my hoarding would one day be needed. lol
---
Yeah my private is different each time. I plop item, go back in, item gone. So that's not really a workaround
---
Yes, but I ended up sticking it out and I've pretty much got everything I want. But I've been trading on reddit since the game started also, so almost a 2 years worth of active trading to get to the point where I'm satisfied. Would I do it again? Hell no. Lmao.
---
Never thought of that. Very proud of you and am excited to find those pesky dead enemies!
---
Yes. I use ssd for my main games. 76 is one of em. Takes less than 10 seconds to load in to the vault and less than 10 seconds to load into the arena. I can loot while invisible and the timer nor circle has even started yet. Some other people who also have ssds will be invisible to me but they're moving like I am an I can damage people before they even get control of their character but they are fully loaded in and the invisibility cloak is gone its they're still in black screen.
---
For a while I was able to do exactly the right thing to make the farmer bots explode when I hit them with my mistress of mystery sword.
---
That made Flatwoods super exciting for once.
---
how do you do, fellow kids
---
"I think it‚Äôs designed this way to keep people playing for as long as possible"
---
That's the whole point of how the game is structured it's called player retention.
---
Be on in a min
---
I've got cork coming out of my ears. Lol. I can pick up the slack, trust me.
---
Osmosis kits, sure. The rest?  Maybe. 
---
I stopped bringing the stuff back to him and letting the thieves keep it for a modest fee. Except if they shoot first or they‚Äôre dead when so find them.
---
Eh excuse to kill cocky raiders. If they would just return what they stole they would still have a head.
---
Maybe. But he was actually outside, at the golf course, hanging around. Id say it kinda fits there tho :D
---
You need to have one other person with you it doesn't work if your the only person on the team
---
Yes, but it‚Äôs the way they do it I guess. I don‚Äôt think I like spending every day trying to get something with no value. There could be other ways
---
You have ~5 min before the server is killed. Lots of people mule stuff this way, myself included.
---
Yeah I did one yesterday that was the same. Mob after mob. I couldn‚Äôt get in rhythm with my bloodied build. I ended up taking radaway and switching to my 50 just so I could get a shot off.
---
I'm satisfied with my gear. It took some time to get, sure, but it fits my play style and build perfectly.
---
If you're constantly chasing whatever the current meta is, you'll probably never be satisfied.
---
Perhaps. I've seen him chasing hostiles, fighting, running away etc, but always just few clicks of his original location, not a lot. Something mad must have happened so hed go from golf place to another :D
---
THAT IS SO HELPFUL! I NEED TO REMEMBER THAT
---
It doesn't matter. I have the same problem with my commando: the data on screen says y have half a mag yet, but the character reloads the weapon to full. 
---
My heavy gunner uses a Gatling Plasma. I just force my character to empty the cores by having no more than 5 with me. Taking new cores from the stash means lots of half-empty cores. 
---
It happens often and exclusively during Scorched Earth, so I am guessing performance issues due to the server being about to implode.
---
I posted this suggestion and it got removed by the mods
---
Yep, and Im always disappointed. Its such a pretty location near the edge of the mountains, and they use it for a box.
---
Take the perks that give your more ammo and stims from containers, Scrounger and Pharma Farma. Even 1 rank of each will make a big difference, especially Scrounger.
---
I guess you‚Äôre right. Maybe I‚Äôll give it another go. A bit more casual this time
---
:/
---
Ok my gt is naturesfunk
---
I always use it
---
Fans: make it so if we qualify the item drops into our inventory, or if the body falls out of bounds it spawns a loot chest for the player.
---
Bethesda: pffft nah time to grind more or waste time hoping it spawns as a meat pile cause we don't care. Means more hunting for you heh heh.
---
Gunsmith is a must if you use explosive weapons or weapons with the explosive effect. BIG difference.
---
Definitely take it casually. Once you get all the good stuff, you kind of lose interest in even playing the game anymore. I mean whats the point, there's nothing to aspire to anymore. The game was more fun when I was using what I had to get by.
---
These devs are trash
---
Thanks! You're just using an SSD via USB? Not modded?
---
Hence the word *‚Äòusually‚Äô*.
---
i think there would be an interest in something like this. Maybe have one or two different workshop every day. That way the guild isn‚Äôt hogging every workshop on a server and people can get what they want. 
---
If its going to be on public servers. The guild is definitely going to need volunteers dedicated to defending the workshops from PvP. If something like this catches on. Its going to be a breeding ground for trolls and the pvp crowd. maybe set up a discord where whoever controls the workshop can send out an alert that the workshop is under attack. The alert should go out to every member of the guild but their should definitely be six or seven decent players dedicated to dropping whatever they are doing and protecting the workshop. Im not a master pvp player but i could probably lend my services from time to time for defending the workshop.
---
Wouldnt know... cant get her passed complaining about her back.
---
That'd be paradise
---
Yeah I‚Äôm
---
Sick of crappy SBQ armor. We got a 3* bloodied plasma and Instigating Ultracite laser Gatling from Faschnat. SBQ is overrated except for Flux.
---
Being on a team by yourself is actually the worst of both worlds, because Lone Wanderer won't work and neither will Inspirational.
---
I was always at westek or white springs and got burned out after a few months. Thanks for the advice
---
Need more screws to finish your PA. Going to check if I have some
---
And let them get out of fixing trade bugs, online-availability bugs, and the rest? It's been pretty bad since the last patch, combined with the increased possibility of blackscreening and never getting your dropped stuff back.
---
At least, that's been my experience since the last patch. Anyone else?
---
this has happened to me twice, bethesda was nice enough to give me back my atoms.
---
It's weird, sometimes i stay and when i go to my camp place, the only thing that's there is my camp lol
---
Here is my theory, ward is former Raider according to the paper at his desk (if I'm not mistaken), and conveniently a raider is always the thief... Is Ward really his own inside man and he would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for that meddling vault dweller?
---
Oh ok
---
2000 hours in. They used to stay there, now it is common for them to disappear. There is no "body" to loot.
---
a absolute legend from here just sent me hundreds of items what a great community thank you!!!!
---
You're welcome.
---
Yea I bought a 1tb SanDisk internal ssd and a 2.5inch external hard drive enclosure case off of Newegg sometime last year for $110. Just plugs in the back of my one x and I install games with long load times and play a lot on to it. The rest of my games I install into a regular 4tb WD external hard drive. Small games less than 10gigs are on the xbox's hard drive itself.
---
Players are using a blueprint glitch to place ammo converters in workshops and camps and placing multiple one's down.
---
I think on launch the game didn‚Äôt know what it wanted to be.
---
Doesn‚Äôt have to be an MMO though to have an account bank.
---
I'm a bloodied build and Im upvoting this. If there was more incentive to play this build I would definitely give it a go. I do carry 1 beserker weapon especially for RR as i like to switch to my stealth suit to collect ores and since I get my health up for this event for ore collection, I want a little backup if I get spotted, although because of other factors, I obviously don't get full damage output from that weapon.
---
I definitely think this build needs love.
---
PVP was my particular concern. A barebones crew to keep it persistent would take 4 people over the course of the day probably, meaning around 12 people doing coordinated shifts weekly, but that probably isn't enough to protect the workshop. Discord was the app that by reputation seems the best fit for organizing this kind of thing but i only know it by reputation.
---
I think a persistent player run location is cool enough that idc about what happens to the resources it generates particularly; if left up to me i would try to keep resource generators powered and unlocked.
---
You dont get score for them.
---
Yep FO76 has the least QoL improvements of any MMO I've played so far.
---
I‚Äôd like to be able to mail my friends items. I also really like ESOs mail system where you can mail an item to a player COD. It‚Äôs a safe way to conduct a transaction.
---
I keep retuning to this event because there's a lot of people doing this event üòÇ
---
JE .50 cal, Gatling gun and LMG. I use the .50 cal the most, it‚Äôs a fun general use weapon, the LMG when I feel like it or need to knock down a scorchbeast and the Gatling gun when I feel like conserving ammo
---
Definitely Demons
---
The Insurgent outfit is similar to it
---
Well Bethesda did so you know one.
---
Does FO76 have bots or any real money trading? I‚Äôm guessing not but I don‚Äôt play on PC.
---
Explosive instigating reduced weight minigun. Point at something. Click the trigger. Thing dissappears.
---
Favorite weapon ever is a BE Cryolator, seems like a cool concept
---
That's the joke.
---
Probably not
---
haha i would if i could
---
I‚Äôd love some instanced team based missions with checkpoints and no respawns.
---
Something akin to a 4 man dungeon.
---
It‚Äôs just like, ‚ÄúHEY EVERYONE, YOU KNOW RHAT THING THATS HAPPENING TO LOTS OF PEOPLE?! IT HAPPENED TO ME TOO ITS SO UNFAIRRR‚Äù
---
I just don‚Äôt see why they think that being the ten thousandth person to let people know about the problem is going to make the devs fix it any faster.
---
I used to pick camp spots based on persistent existing containers. Sort of a free lending library. You can build on some top of some level 2 safes too, but I don't know if they're open or locked. When I was overstuffed and it was on a treasure map trail, I'd stuff it full of weapons for someone to scrap.
---
preston garvey approves of this message...
---
I can only assume that the difficulty (near impossibility) of finding mob corpses is an immersive feature of this game.
---
I have seen her land with nobody on the ground. I have seen her stay up in the air with nobody shooting. I have seen her refuse to land with a crew of unarmed bloodied ninjas. I have seen her land and attack her own scorched minions. I have seen her get stuck on Firebase Major and spin like Curly from the Three Stooges.
---
I have been playing since release. The only real thing was to cripple her in order to make her land sooner. With that gone, now it's a roulette. Freezing her is still effective. 
---
Don't tell people how to take on the Queen. She will do whatever the f0ck she feels like doing.
---
I can see why, though. An account bank would make it easy for hackers to pick clean an account completely.
---
That incompetent narcoleptic cheap bastard being in charge of the Settlers is an indubitable sign of how expendable they are
---
Seriously.  I think half the bitching on reddit about the game is just to drag everyone down.  I wouldn't be surprised if half the complaints about things are just trolling attempts to just ruin player experience in general.
---
No, Todd did not pay me a year's subscription of FO76 First to say that.
---
Sometimes, if you go indoors and then go back outdoors (to engage the loading screen), then you can go back to where you think the corpse was and find a random looting window pop-up over a random spot on the ground. Also works if you travel far away enough to trigger a loading screen and come back. 
---
This usually works quite often for me when a) corpse sinks into the ground, b) enemy is killed too fast and doesn't show a looting pop-up, or c) no loot at all on the legendary you 100% damaged and killed. Sometimes doesn't work at all, though. 
---
Just another dice roll if you think it might be worth the time/effort for the 2-star quad lead pipe of rapid fire it probably had.
---
Yes, I'm pretty sure you'll have more than enough time, especially with another double score weekend coming up, potentially.
---
It affects every group related perk and also some mutations like Herd Mentallity
---
Herd mentality does work though
---
Yeah Gunsmith is broken right now alongside White Knight, both perks have no effect on durability currently, and sit alongside Action Boy/Girl, Adrenaline, and Lock and Load for being broken as of patch 20
---
Tbh, I stopped trying to focus on the best things and enjoy the ones I do find. I currently am using a Bowie Knife dressed as  Pioneer Scout and am having a lot of fun, I don't really care about one-shotting stuff.
---
Use a gofuk on the barrel and a yourself grip for maximum server instability.
---
yeah yeah. bloodied build without bloodied weapon, junkie build without junkie weapon, berserker build without berserker one and so on. I didnt try to educate u. My intent was to make u understand that low health doesnt mean bloodied weapon at all but since u go "Bloodied PA Heavy" without any bloodied weapon (maybe u just like the word who knows) I wont do any other attempt. Thanks for educate me urself though. It was soooo necessary
---
I was on an events team where the leader just kicked people off if they didn't show up promptly for ! events.  I was in the mood for grinding events so I stayed on.  He thumb-upped me when I arrived every time. He thumb-downed a couple people who showed up right at the end of events then booted them.  It was kinda funny.
---
Or maybe even a rogue-like dungeon where the team wipes if every member goes down like (as in NW), and do the goal is to clear as many instanced mini-levels to activate checkpoints that you can continue onwards with on your next run?
---
They seem to hang around where you have your camp object placed. You can move that to get your pet in a different location, but that will change where you spawn in as well.
---
Have you played with one before? I've dabbled and have never been able to get the most out of one. I find the damage to be a little bugged especially with the crytalising barrel when compared to a non explosive version. If you have any tips I'm all ears.
---
This is awesome btw! We need this for the community events!
---
That's a ' magic' weapon right? Each shot is double damage cos the effect can't keep up with the fire rate? Do you know if the explosive damage is also doubled?
---
Instigating/Swing Speed Grognak's Axe. One-shots everything shy of a Super Mutant Warlord. For bosses, a Furious/Swing Speed Grognak Battlemace.
---
Yes I have, I have one myself, I take off the crystallizing barrel and can get it to about 225, since it‚Äôs explosive you really won‚Äôt have to worry about the range of the ‚Äúmist‚Äù
---
Five characters, five favourites.
---
Commando? Bloodied faster fire SMG. Really raw and kicks like a mule: it feels realistic.
---
Gunslinger? Instigating 33 vats reduced weight western revolver.
---
Unarmed ninja? Executioner faster swing knuckles. Two punches max.
---
Explosive expert? Two shot auto grenade launcher. Because loot can fly. Fun. 
---
Rifleman? Instigating hunting rifle. Again, it is realistic.
---
Reminds me of diablo 2.
---
Had this happen like three times in the last two weeks. Also on pc. Was hearing two guys talking about how they just hit level 24 even though everyone on my team was well over level 100(and muted)
---
Empath with lvl3 class freak is like lone wanderer for the damage resistance. And it also works in a single person public team. AP regen from the perk is really insignificant compared to even a single powered armour piece.
---
Those numbers seem stupidly high in  a stupidly short time period.
---
Is this across ALL platforms?
---
Sounds like you're a true barbarian of the wasteland
---
If we‚Äôre just throwing stuff out there then I‚Äôd actually love to see something like where you have to actually build up a camp and then defend it from a horde/waves of enemies.
---
Nice one lol
---
Bloodied 50 critical dmg 15 critical fill Hunting Rifle. It's slow but accurate as fuck and has cool skins
---
Still down?
---
lol
---
I came across a camp that was built like an actual house with a gabled roof, and the top floor was an attic filled with random furniture and decor items. It was great,
---
For gatling plasma:
---
Beam splitter for shotgun effect.
---
Riffled barrel.
---
Prime capacitor.
---
Can confirm. Recently transitioned one character to Bloody for XP boost and it has constant problems with fast travel where before it was very rare to have a problem.
---
If you don't contribute personally you miss out on rare plans. Those are per person each time you donate. The other stuff is for everyone
---
Gunsmith lvl5 is broken in current patch and doesn't decrease durability loss from shooting.
---
Awesome. Sounds good.
---
Best one I‚Äôve gotten is an anti-armor pump shotgun. Combined with the Chinese stealth suit I can just waltz through nuke zones farming xp and materials with no threat to my life at all.
---
Someone jealous of my probably duped legacy weapon?
---
How about when an enemy forgets how to move and when they die you can‚Äôt loot them? Happened to me with a legendary twice but happens all the time to any enemy mostly scorched
---
Someone jealous of my (probably duped) legacy weapon?
---
Magic gauss minigun, so much fun to watch enemies disappear in a hail of bullets.
---
When you plce your camp for the first time at a new one, does the spawn point go infront of you, behind, or is it dependent on how you set the camp modual.
---
I am satisfied with my gear, I am not min-maxing. The game way too easy without a min-maxed item, yiu can kill everything with shitty rolls too... so...
---
I think this issue has a lot do with one‚Äôs perception of the game; to me, the fun comes from scraping for what I can find, completing missions, and using what I find or barter for through normal gameplay. I‚Äôve been burned out on games before, and it happens when I get max levels, with all the skills and god weapons to boot. Nothing poses a threat or is challenging anymore, so before long my human brain naturally wants me to move along to something else. In 76 I‚Äôve made a point to make my build versatile and tough, and as a result I can use almost any weapon I come across (aside from pistols), but I‚Äôm not a glass cannon, overpowered, or an insane tank. Low level fights are a breeze, but fights in the bog or mire can still get the adrenaline pumping! It‚Äôs not quite perfect yet, but I‚Äôm getting closer. Keep evolving your character, and trying new things.. and enjoy all the caps from whatever good legendaries you sell once you‚Äôre no longer attached to all the god-guns. Just make sure to keep one or two of your very best for any pvp encounters or legendary fights. Happy hunting!
---
Any shovel. The sound is satisfying
---
Same.  I have a good minigun and power armor.  Pa is key.  If you're a heavy gunner it's a requirement anyway, and theres no rng to it, so its great.
---
I was just online for about 2 1/2 hours, and had another 3-5 more hours earlier today (hey, it's a day off for me). In that time:
---
* PP once
---
* RR twice (surprised I caught the second one, it happened just as I was logging out)
---
* Path to Enlightenment once
---
* whatever the one at the Palace of the Winding Path is (I can never remember the name) once
---
* Heart of the Swamp once
---
* Heart of the Enemy (I think that's what it's called, when you are supposed to collect SB DNA) every friggin' time I went to join a Scorched Earth battle, so about 5x today
---
* Breach &amp; Clear once
---
* Lode Baring once (while I was doing B&amp;C, pissed me off I couldn't join)
---
* Free Range twice
---
* The Messenger about 49,360 times (it was on the screen *constantly*)
---
* Patrol Duty about 7 times
---
* ~~Jail Break (or whatever the Mad Dog Malone one at Grafton Dam is called)~~Manhunt at least 7 times (Jail Break never showed up)
---
* Back on the Beat at least 3 times
---
* Feed the People at least 5 times
---
* Line in the Sand around 3 times
---
* Fertile Soil about 5 times
---
* Uranium Fever - (insert John Travolta looking around gif here) *never*
---
* Irrational Fear once
---
* AWOL Armaments once
---
* Campfire Tales once
---
* Riding Shotgun - also MIA
---
So basically the good ones happened once, or less often (except in one or two rare cases), and for the most part the boring rote ones are constantly going off.
---
Berserker should be the one doing the most damage. High risk, high reward
---
I'll try that.  Thank you so much!
---
Your PSA is wrong. Atomic shop updates as usual on Tuesdays! **Doomsday Clock** is a part of everyday deals which were mentioned on official Bethesda news site as part of **ATOMIC SHOP WEEKLY UPDATE: JULY 28 - AUGUST 4** article https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2TUnMA1Z6vTZko5tWJ1R1J/atomic-shop-weekly-update-july-28-august-4
---
Here are "UPDATES" for the rest of the week.
---
Responders Power Armor	1,500 1,200 (20% Off!)	August 1	August 2
---
The Inspector Costume	800 640 (20% Off!)	August 2	August 3
---
Party Time Icon	100 **50 (50% Off!)	August 3	August 4
---
For me, she does her Hillary Duff monologue, 'This is my life!'
---
I LOVE the Power Fist
---
Omg. That‚Äôs so simple and so brilliant. Great job pointing this out to us all!
---
Maybe cause I live in Aus the land of tomorrow and future timeüòÄ
---
I think he is selling the stuff under the table to keep foundation running and then use us to get the item back and only pays us a small percentage of what he received and is able to do it again since the ‚Äúthief‚Äù is dead and nobody knows. LoL
---
My scrapbox looks almost the same, with 18k steel.
---
My circuits, screws number will go down soon, I want to craft 100 gauss minigun to test something.
---
What? Im just asking questions to better understand the weapon? Was really curious wether the instigating applies to explosive damage as well. Sounds like you might have a guilty conscience.
---
Every time it happens to me I just find this tiny piece of crap with nothing in it but the basic necessities, and it isn‚Äôt even close to where my camp goes. They put their stuff a full quarter mile away and yet you couldn‚Äôt place my camp because of it? REALLY?!
---
I cant wait for the backpack!!
---
Junkie is 2nd best, but the gap between 1st and 2nd is gigantic. I agree Berserker needs a large buff, but Bloodied needs to be reworked. There are too many benefits to even list. I'd say all the other effects need to be balanced to be in the same ballpark as Junkie's, way too many useless prefixes.
---
Berserker in it's current state should give +150% damage, Nocturnal shouldn't have a debuff during the day, all the enemy specific prefixes should be at least 50% damage, mutant's should be +5% for each mutation up to like 30%. And then there are some like Stalker's and Suppressor that are so bad they might as well just take them out of the loot pool completely.
---
Thanks, I‚Äôve played fallout 4 extensively and completed everything there is to do. So I guess I went into 76 thinking that I wanted to do the same. This definitely gave me something to think about.
---
If you take a med-x and psycho addictions and a high cap backpack, you could probably run level 1 wood/leather armor without needing to break the armor. That'd make it easy to swap out to a hazmat suit when needed.
---
I must not be very lucky as I haven‚Äôt found anything in those suitcases, I guess my karma will come back as I do get rid if alot of my surplus in them.
---
I *think* you spawn a few feet north(ish) of it. You just need to try mapping to your camp a few times to see where you end up. I've tried rotating the camp object a bunch of times and that seems to never make any difference.
---
It‚Äôs about two minutes for me on PC. I wonder if blocked players has an effect on this. It says online that blocking a player means you won‚Äôt see them and you‚Äôll be put on a different server. So if you block a bunch of cheaters then maybe it‚Äôs taking a awhile to find a clean server ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Haha nice.
---
I have a hodge lodge of armor and am happy with it. It does what I want as far as reducing weight of things and one piece has the chameleon effect. I don‚Äôt need whatever the flavor of the day is to be happy. 
---
As for weapons. My fav is a new bloodied pick axe and heavy heated sledgehammer. The only firing weapon I use is my 3* hunters Gatling plasma for the SBQ and my two shot Tesla for radiation rumble (I always collect ore over killing ghouls). Not interested in fixers or handmades etc.
---
I see cheaters on average once a day and play about 10 matches a day. It‚Äôs been worse lately since double xp weekend.
---
Whatever you decide, please work on getting either a TS or Quad cryolator and fss shiskebob. Every player should have the ability to lay down some support if needed. Now iv heard the flamer is ideal for friendly fire but mine never seems to work so thats why i say shishkebob. But if you do want a nice flamer go J or B and that thing will melt all in its path. Cryo ammo is easy to make, just pick up crystal on your lucky hole runs and make a trip up taranga town for acid and more crystal. I just buy fuel. There seems to be a general understanding that making fuel is BS so everyone seems to sell it for a cap.
---
You can, but I'd rather run with it broken. I like my stat boosts from the underlining, which id have to take off if i were to do that. Plus its super hard to complete a low level armor set with good rolls.
---
It‚Äôs called something tick Tequila and you get it from Biv in Morgantown
---
Is this why my loot keeps turning invisible as im trying to grab it?
---
Really? I almost always check the shop first, and have only had one autocomplete incident. I know it's not fully understood and all that, I'd just never heard it was linked to the shop
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve never played a game where it hasn‚Äôt turned into getting the best things. Guess I need to be satisfied with what I have.
---
Without fallout 1st, best thing you can do is manage your junk. Keep the junk you *really* need for daily stuff like crafting and repairing. Also make sure you scrap all junk too to free up on weight
---
Without fo1st you will need to decide what group of items you pick up most (Chems, ammo etc) then try and us your perk cards to reduce their specific weights. You can do the same through legendary armour.
---
The game is a nightmare once reach a certain point without fo1st so the claim that the game isn't Pay to win doesn't hold much water for me.
---
Not actually disappear, I just mean that it melts everything.
---
Okay
---
Mmorpg*
---
Yes, when playing a game that‚Äôs an ongoing platform to continuously play, one must sometimes get creative with what they do. Just find some fun quirky things that you enjoy, there really are many options. Me, I enjoy making a bunch of fully modded low-level machine guns, crafting a ton of ammo for them, then finding groups of very low-levels (like levels 10-15) and arming them with those guns before dragging whoever follows into a high-level hell! Sometimes you can even manage to Nukashine one of them, and when u finally catch up just bask in the bewilderment on their face!
---
Do you still use demo expert?
---
QE Pump Shotgun. It's my Radiation Rumble weapon, and god that thing is fun to use.
---
Sure, it takes like 5 minutes to reload it from empty, as each of the 32 shells have to be loaded individually, but that just adds to the charm of it.
---
Your sense of humor is immaculate.
---
I like the true barrel, forceful stock, beam splitter, and the hip fire accuracy receiver for laser rifles.
---
Corner all 3 fusion core processors and the converted ammo factory.  Make them untakeable by having multiple people on each.  Itll be great.
---
Okay, i just dont like the idea of paying a higher price subscription for a single game. And the fact they make the junk stash or whatever fo1st member item and not a 1000 cap item in the store still doesnt make sense to me
---
For the laser, the only mods that really matter is the beam splitter and a forceful stock for increased durability. Everything else is subjective to your build and playstyle
---
Wait is this for real? You gotta load every shell individually? My quad double barrel just has the normal reload animation. Do lever actions have the same problem I'm curious l.
---
It and many other techniques were posted shortly after the device was released but it doesn‚Äôt hurt to help newbs who haven‚Äôt worked it out.
---
Minus browny points for lack of aesthetics.
---
As many people suggest, maybe try it for 1 month and cancel if you don't like it. You keep whatevers in your stash after you cancel.
---
I think theirs enough game there to play the main stories and then put it down. But if you want to play end-game fo1st is almost a must.
---
Thanks. Knowing that means I can at least try different things just for variety
---
That looks very helpful to someone. I just happen to be a console user and impressed with your answer.
---
I can only purchase gold on Saturday. The a hole won't sell on any other day.
---
Wear the chinese stealth armor broken u still get rad resistance from it and stay invisible, have a 15 agility  with the sneak perks and watch your damage sore
---
I just had this bug one or two times. I guess I'm lucky. But yesterday I fast traveled to point pleasant and ended up in camp McClintock. Weird af.
---
I feel like to make it at all worth it i would need to gather a looooot of extra scrap and items and then cancel. But then i can only take those items and not store any more. Also one of the only alures of it is the junk box
---
Let it sit for a couple minutes and it will let you respawn. Annoying bug
---
Oh good, thatd be some shit if other players were causing that. Doesnt happen too often but when it does its usually at big events where everyone has their big magic guns out
---
Don‚Äôt think I do
---
Except that even after all that effort it still barely holds a candle to Junkies and especially bloodied. Why would your usual player bother when they can get guaranteed better results across the board in both damage taking and dealing by going bloodied?
---
So on the opposite side from where your standing?
---
No no.  If my gun did that, I wouldn't use it.
---
I was surprised too when I rolled it at the purveyor. I took it outside for a spin, noticed at had like 3 shells in it, hit the reload button and then thought "Hmm... is this animation ever going to end? lol"
---
It's not quite as bad as I'm making out, as Speed Demon helps a lot with this.  
---
And yeah, I assume quad lever actions are the same.
---
Scrap and bulk. Only keep scrap you will need. One set of power armor. Limit the amount of weapons. Don't keep magazines, bobbleheads or chems you won't use. Don't keep ammo you won't use and make ammo as you need it.
---
Have faith ye little one, the dupers have this covered.
---
Ya. Anytime after 4PM for me, there are significantly less players and less events. In comparison to playing at 8AM, it's full of players, more events and people buy a lot from my vendors. It's pretty pointless to play at 4PM.
---
Thats crazy, thanks for the info.
---
Not sure if it‚Äôs spoils but you can definitely hold more if you have one of the fridges
---
I mean I sell wierd shit at half their in game price, but yeah ballistics and regs I sell for min
---
Well your one of few my friend
---
yeah, but my guy wants to be carrying like hundreds of the stuff around and you can only fit 10 in a fridge
---
I agree with almost everything. I found with power armour, you can suit it up with a set of armour and call it into your inventory, with a fusion cell in the suit, and it all only weighs 10 pounds. Where as if you store all the armour pieces separate each peace weighs over 10 pounds. When you bulk your scrap does it become lighter?
---
I think that 'glitch' is done on purpose.
---
Scrappable stuff goes in the junkbox and has no weight limit. Once you cancel you won't gain the weight from the junkbox you just won't be able to put anymore in it. Private server can be handy.
---
You on Xbox?
---
Bethesda has a Twitter account you can post  this this there. It'll get their attention sooner.
---
Right, i guess so. Still dont know about the price of it though.
---
I can't believe this thead pops up right after this very thing happens to me. I haven't hunted Radstags in a month, and today I see a giant herd and blast it with my Tesla rifle, and I find like 3 bodies, tops, out of at least a dozen or more Radstags.
---
That, and character-bound items instead of account-bound items you can mail, mean I frequently fall off from playing the game. I think fixing those would keep people playing and "not" ignoring the store more.
---
Will come down to purely how many hours you think you'll put into playing. I play pretty much every day so it's totally justified for me.
---
What about using the Life-Saving effect, Mysterious Savior and Revenant with Berserkers and broken wood armor?
---
Collect your extra 50% damage from Revenant and worry less about the fact you get blasted as a beserker. Seems like it would make sense to me but I've not taken the time to try and assemble that build.
---
Which platform ? Ps4 Xbox or Pc
---
I have a quad lever and the answer is yes lol.
---
I got a bloodied grognak axe and never really was going for a bloodied build but thing was I was already set up for it. Being I used the one perk card that more rads gave you more strength which I was doing so I could carry more. But before that I was using my all rise and I got that and it was a game changer. Next I got a 2 star bloodied death claw and even better. Then I got my first bloodied 2 star combat rifle and it‚Äôs been guns ever since. Those are my top three because it made me change my whole play style around. I got lucky and got 3 bloody weapons in a row from purveyor two weeks ago and I got a bloodied fixer. It‚Äôs not the one that everyone wants but I love that gun also. It‚Äôs 250 damage resistance while reloading and 50 more critical shot damage. So I guess I have 4 favorites.
---
Xbox and level 26 and I know that I‚Äôm low and should wait but I just want this out of the way
---
There is but I think you have to craft it or get it off of a enemy
---
I think I have like 30 of these from the vendors. I took to snagging them from the rusty pick while waiting on people
---
Yeah sry i am on ps4 maybr youll find someone else
---
K thanks anyways
---
If that were the goal i would definitely recommend calling it the Brotherhood (no relation to any other brotherhoods you may have heard of)TM lol. That would be what i would call a "bad thing," but would take so many people... That's four sites, so barebones 48 people on a coordinated weekly schedule. If they were all on the same world they could provide each other limited backup but to have it run smoothly i think you would actually need to double that number, so thats 96 people if my math is right (which, disclaimer, not my strongsuit). And at that point, if a guild were able to coordinate that then that would actually be a really epic feat of cooperation that i wouldn't mind seeing despite it's dystopic impact on gameplay haha
---
Who?
---
I feel like Life Saving, Revenant, and Mysterious Stranger is what would make "Berserker" work. There would be room for a new legendary effect or perk that makes you immune to damage while downed for a second so you keep popping back up unless you don't auto res, where you then drop dead after a couple seconds.
---
You'd burn through stimpacks like a madman but it seems to fit the theme anyway.
---
How is that legacy?
---
I'm only level 35 but I set up a vendor and I sell most of my ammo for 1 cap each... I've narrowed down the guns I like to use to shotguns and rifles... This may change later but for now I'm happy to sell everything else.  Sometimes people buy but not usually.  I'm guessing a lot of people use their spare ammo now for the ammo converter?
---
A warning to not continue abusing exploits
---
Sorry. Thought you were being an ass. Internet and all. I get a nice first hit bonus (x2 damage) from the instigating attribute. Explosive just let's me spray and pray after target starts to move. Instigating and Explosive don't stack on each other as far as I can tell. Perk cards do the rest. But I get the dropped health all of a sudden more health glitch a lot. It does fire faster then servers can keep up with. Not gonna lie, that has killed me before
---
No no no... on EVERY server, on every console.
---
I see
---
Thats another way to look at things. I just feel like the damage boost is negligible considering mines a sneak rifleman build, and hardly ever die. I'm already pretty much 1 tapping everything in mycrosshairs from sneak bonuses. It would be a good way to go for a commando build considering your in the action more.
---
Combat armor has only one type of helmet. You can find it on random hat/helmet spawn locations (does not drop of enemies), and if you scrap one you have a chance to learn how to craft it. Easiest way to get it would be to find a player that could craft you a bunch of them for scrapping.
---
There is but it doesn‚Äôt do anything, it‚Äôs just cosmetic
---
Probably one of those useless NPCs they added with wastelanders in each major location to ‚Äúspice up‚Äù the old main questline or whatever
---
Under Perk synergy, this is a personal opinion but I feel like Mysterious Savior / Revenant technically synergize with berserker.
---
I'm really of the opinion that a berserker build just stacks up Life Saving armor and runs crazy with those perks. Yes you "die" a lot, but popping back up with revenant boost constantly makes that not matter.
---
The various loot bags full of legendary goods having almost 3 Star goods sometimes laid around the white spring golf club was a time...
---
If you‚Äôre on a solo team empath just makes you take more damage
---
Hey it's me, your display track! Yesterday someome launched a nuke and the blast was not far away so the wind dropped your weapon which is really sad because it looked so nice on me, why don't you just pick it up and put it in my inventory again!
---
I like that idea a lot actually. I've got a berserkers pistol build thatd be perfect for. Its super squishy because I used most of my perks to boost damage because pistols are garbage. Think I could make a few sacrifices somewhere for revenant, I already run a life saving piece of armor.
---
prob sitting at max caps and prob just want you to come to their camp. I dont do this but just my guess. there is millions of duped holiday gifts still out there
---
Cant you just make one and find out?
---
You gotta remember that with wastelanders they had to implement all the mechanics AND create the quests/story, then test out all of that. For this they‚Äôll probably just have to test out the quests and stuff for glitches and whatnot so if there is a delay it shouldn‚Äôt be more than 1-2 months
---
He is an NPC you run into when you first enter fort defiance. His sister was a BOS knight (or paladin?) and died fighting off the scourge. Jonah blames himself for not being there and is very depressed when you talk to him. He says that he was too much of a 'coward' and that he should have been there. It seems like he has given up on life and is just waiting to die.
---
I really hope that he might be able to get a redemption arc so that he can avenge his sister.
---
Theres a daily cap
---
I have a warning from the dupe wave so I can't try this glitch haha lolol..
---
The ingredients are obnoxious to grind for. I don‚Äôt wanna spend 30 minutes killing things and finding weird items just to find out it spoils. I kinda figured more people would know about this. Aren‚Äôt questions like these kinda the whole point of forums like this?
---
Nothing because they dont actually track it.
---
Known bug for a while now. No addresses from Bethesda
---
Threads like this are great for me, I'm only level 35 and just started playing last month so I like to learn what the community standards are... I generally sell all my ammo for 1 cap each, but I think I've been pricing my nukes and grenades too high (3-10 cap range) since nobody's buying them... I farm purified water and sell that for 10 caps which I also think might be too high since no one ever buys any. Generally if I'm not sure I try to go with 1/5 or 1/4 of the default price on most things! But I like to visit other camps and get an idea of prices too... If I have priced something too high it's definitely out of ignorance and not out of selfishness!
---
Get to work haha
---
Now it's time to code AIs that can play fo76 and buy a whole lot more copies of the game.
---
It is literally the biggest issue with the game right now.
---
Unlike, say, the 90% of posts that are WHAAA, numbers aren't divisible by 5, and the free stuff they give isn't good enough, and this 30 second challenge is TOO HAAAARD!!!
---
If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, its a duck.
---
One spawns on top of westek, but still a huge moment. I got my first one to drop in 76
---
Yes, and you can even apply the 'standard' pains to it so it matches ie. Bos and shadowed etc, not sure about the atomic shop paints though.
---
You can find it  randomly at clothing spawn points in the world eg. 2nd floor of destroyed museum in harpers ferry, and at some vendors.
---
Also, if you scrap one then you have a (lowish) chance of learning the plan (and you have to keep scrapping to learn the different paints).
---
Isnt that like 62 units? I though they weigh 0.1 unit per, right?
---
Do you have the excavator power armor I recommend getting it unless gallahan mine is where you get it I‚Äôm only level 23
---
There is a Spawn for them at Harper's Ferry In the  broken down Structure next to The Vendor
---
Thank you for your useful response (been away for a month).  Makes sense.  But how do players build the elaborate, multistory, heavily furnished fabulous camps that we see.
---
MODUS isn't really The Enclave.  He just murdered the local chapter and wore them like a skinsuit.
---
*sigh* The simple pleasures of the wealthy
---
It is a cosmetic minigun that used to drop. Spilling a mood to it will remove the paint and you cannot get it back. Think of it like a trophy.
---
Actually, I'll just crack the game, it'll be easy.
---
It was a rare skin that dropped on the minigun from a few sources. Still an incredibly rare drop, but it was duped pretty heavily as it was one of the top tier collector items, along with the 3 rare colored baseball bats that were also duped
---
Could still probably get something decent for it
---
I did Uranium Fever a couple of hours ago and there were a bunch of empty goo and ash piles. And I missed one of the legendaries I earned even after going over the entire area and picking up everything I could see. I'm sure it was under one of the empty piles.
---
Alright, what? The fancys are legendaries? And whats a nuke card?
---
Are the stats even close to one and other?  If your dropping mobs with the fixer in one shot, which u should be. The fixer. The combat maybe useful in a fight when u have to score multiple hits to take down an enemy but I‚Äôd possibly still favour the quad with FFR. No buff but it will hit hard fast and won‚Äôt need reloading as often.
---
yes!
---
Cool story
---
Who gives a fuck about internet points lol, pretending like im the one who downvoted you before. Try . 50 cal receiver and you will never be back anyway, 50 lead and some steel with a bit of gunpowder to make 500 ammo (900 with perk and some more with super-duper)
---
I was moving an entire accounts worth of stuff to a new character and my friend was in my private world to hold it for me. I had too much to leave it in containers or for him to hold so I dropped it at his camp after doing some tests w small things to make sure it was ok. Everything was fine until I logged in to get the stuff and my private world was empty.... Ran to his camp, gone. Messaged him on discord, he had crashed. I panicked thinking I lost a year's worth of stuff but after some frantic searching, amazingly the bags stayed floating in the air where his camp had been. Needless to say I'm hesitant to move stuff with private worlds now bc if the server had reset after his crash, it would've been a disaster.
---
This happens with Guided Meditation and Line in the Sand as well. When lots of corpses and body parts are all over the place I think something is happening where bodies are disappearing. Not turning into meat piles, just like vanishing from geometry. Sometimes if you walk around they‚Äôll pop in but most of the time just poof! Gone.
---
Is there any evidence it was heavily duped. And the bats?  I‚Äôve not seen a single one of either come up for trade?  Just because there was a dupe wave doesn‚Äôt mean every item got duped.
---
Yes, the shotgun always drop as a 3 star with the same effects. I think its anti armor, limb damage, and a third I'm blanking on. The fancy revolver is random all around 
---
And I'm guessing he found a convoy and destroyed it to get the card. The top of the world and whitesprings areas have many convoys pass through them commonly
---
Thanks bro.  After I gain complete control, I'll sell all items for free and will instate true communism.
---
So yeah it‚Äôs it‚Äôs own legendary that you only can get from pleasant valley ski lodge on bottom floor from a bit for trading in pleasant valley claim tickets. I‚Äôve played since beta and didn‚Äôt know about this until couple months ago. I don‚Äôt when it was added but maybe it was added when I didn‚Äôt play for six months. But I finally started going to use my tickets which are pretty hard to get because only some enemies drop them. But claiming you can get outfits junk and stuff but there is this shotgun that you can‚Äôt mod or anything but it‚Äôs nice and I think a handgun. And finally after about 40 tickets I got one. But a nuke card is what you need to launch the nukes. They fly around on these cargo bots I just shoot them when I see them and get the card. I‚Äôve only launched two nukes in two years but I got about 20 nuke cards
---
Seriously can't even use legendary armor perks easily. Have to break the armor and then hope you dont die or enter a nuke zone.
---
It was an error before teams.  There is no build that didn't benefit from Lone Wanderer and Hard Bargainer is very good until you have everything bought.
---
Hit me up tomorrow, I‚Äôll load you up with enough stuff to get rolling. Gt is BarbaraQChkn, shoot me a message on xbox.
---
What a long walk just to take a shit.
---
What‚Äôs the cap?
---
We have multiple accounts ü§£
---
You can still accidentally drink in power armor, so no, those morons didn't fix it.
---
When ever I see these I always do them and today I got one first try then found three legendary enemies and got some good loot off of them, also this all happen at robco,
---
Tbh I like the mountain scout hniform
---
It's part of the game, most likely due to the engine, try increasing your Lightning setting, in my case this "partially" fixed it as it still shows from time to time.
---
I've been wondering the same thing.
---
I personally saw a guy with 5. But they were also banned from being traded in the large market sub. I dont know the extent, but if they were banned from one of the biggest player trading forums it was probably a wide scale dupe. 
---
The bats in all three colors weren't 'duped' so to say like the minigun. As far as I'm aware they were spawned/created through an exploit. That's why only level 1 colored bats were banned from the sub and are worthless. The exploited copies were only level 1 
---
Dupe is the wrong word, so I'll just say there are alot of exploited/glitched copies
---
Or they could just check on Tuesday for the actual Bethesda post that announces all sales for the week, no reason to check every day...
---
We absolutely need a perk overhaul. If we got perks that in any way synergised with other build styles, bloodied wouldn‚Äôt be so dominant, but there‚Äôs nothing out there to make someone want to run anything else:
---
We need perks that rely on your armor rating, work at high health, take *addictions* into effect, not just taking chems, ones that are actually affected by your SPECIALs like Idiot Savant from Fo4
---
At the moment Berserker is basically just a novelty effect with some niche but impractical uses, but if we had a perk like serendipity that worked the lower your armor rating was rather than health, it would instantly be more viable. Improved rad resistance when unarmored would be great. A tweaked version of Nerd Rage but for armor instead of health.
---
It would be a massive process to overhaul and already expansive perk system, but I think we really do need it
---
If you need help. Add me Tsumz on PC. I'll make sure you can transfer your JUNK items safely even if you need someone to hold them. If you don't trust me, add me up, join my Private World and let me know so I won't leave the world.
---
I know I won't get nothing for being nice but hey, just making the gaming world a better place wouldn't hurt  üëç
---
I tried to claim this 7 times didn't work
---
No of people have multiple then they‚Äôre duped. And that makes sense if they‚Äôre banned from the subs why I wouldn‚Äôt have seen them being traded. I shall stand corrected
---
i rarely sell my ammo xD i dont play as much anymore but i usually put healing items, ammo, junk on my vendors for free coz wanted to turn it into like a refill station. Since all i play is melee i have shitton of ammo and bulked junk.  Dont wear armor so i have a bunch of shit commonly used for reparing gear.  Just too bad there wasnt a way i could have limited amt per player per hour or something just so i can make sure they get distributed fairly lol, but that would be a pointless feature since only a veeeery tiny niche would want it, mainly just me lel.  Plus camp disappears when you go offline anyways.
---
Explosive railways are p fun esp when u vats it fully auto(do you dont need to deal with the recoil). It shoots fast and ends with that satiafying choochoo reload
---
My raider protectron will be very jealous.
---
They said they were looking into it. 3 months ago. It ain't happening.
---
Exactly this! Checking out the weekly update is a far better advise than "check out every day you a might be missing out" as if there wasn't enough fomo in this game already.
---
Painful bandaids to patch the lack of basic features. Even the shitiest f2p mmos have global inventory. This is not something we should work around.
---
So I lost that atoms forever? I remember setting the date and hour (My country hour) correctly tho
---
Plasma cores are easy to make and fusion cores do give 1k shots with the perk.
---
From my understanding, Life Saving effects stack multiplicative and not additive. So they run their own check one after another, basically.
---
One piece to 5 pieces average chance of standing back up, respectively: 50% 75% 87.5% 93.75% 96.88%. It'll obviously fail sometimes because it's technically 50% try 1, then 50% try 2, all the way to 5 plus the perk card's attempt. The statistical average with 5 and the perk card is extremely high rate.
---
Just talking about the build makes me want to try it, but I don't really want to level up another character during the legendary run, or convert one of my other two, at the moment. My major concern with it is three things;
---
\- Dropping dead outright instead of being downed.
---
\- Burning through stimpacks enough that you actually run out of them (shocking, I know).
---
\- Being downed frequently enough that you actually exceed the rate limit on the armor and start being killed enough to invalidate the build.
---
If you run out of stims in the field as a revenant you're basically done for. Revenant only needs a down once every 2 minutes to roll, and the armor bits are rate limited at 1min per each. It still strikes me as an interesting build to try, though. Maybe a shotgun build so you have a lot of cripple control to help manage an active choice about triggering revenant.
---
Maybe a build [something like this](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=c75785c&amp;d=sp2so2sd2su2pc2pe2e31cm2cu0ic4i12as2la2l32lt2a80es2a00lu2ce0ck0p00&amp;m=51c24fbd6i&amp;am=11273a-11273a-11273a-11273a-11273a&amp;wp=w9&amp;wm=132636&amp;n=Shotgun%20Berserker) , rely on all the boosts to stimpacks to make you hopefully outheal all your incoming damage until you decide to die, and otherwise cripple targets with shotguns? Running Life Saving / Increase Action Refresh armor in each slot should keep you alive and give you enough AP to do some vats limb targeting for cripples as much as is useful. Chem fiend doubling the duration of stims (and their healing), Field Surgeon making them heal faster, and then First aid raising that even higher. Serendipity give you a little more time at low health when you're there. With all the stuff boosting stims there I'm wondering if you'd even be able to be downed to trigger revenant, just chem fiend and born survivor seems to make me PVE immortal in power armor.
---
  
---
A different weapon might be a better choice but damn I just really want shotguns to be satisfying and they feel like noodles most of the time.
---
Think I'll start slowly hoarding and collecting items to try this build.
---
Id even accept a flat 10 cap fee
---
The Fixer is probably your best bet. It's just a superior combat rifle with basically a 4th legendary effect
---
Not too mention a Q FFR FR is an amazing roll with high DPS numbers due to large ammo capacity, fast for rate, and faster reload
---
The F E FR combat rifle isnt bad. But it's a combat rifle, and furious is a pretty shitty legendary effect. Unless you're fighting the Queen or Collossus. But I'd still recommend the Fixer as it will still out DPS the combat rifle
---
Explosive is also shitty against the queen, so the F E FR combat rifle will probably only shine on the Colossus. But still be beaten by the fixer
---
That would be hilarious, if they just gave the rewards regardless.
---
I share either green thumb or woodchucker. I imagine people would find it nice. Having said that I usually see people sharing perks like strange in numbers
---
I actually play all 5 characters. Good thing I can make as many accounts as I want on Xbox. I have close to 20 mule characters.
---
Some heavy guns weight +30 lb in stash, and we know how many perk cards you need to get ranks, so need to be bigger for sure
---
I'd rather they fix ash and goo piles first.
---
I would prime the fixer since you'll get more DPS with FFR and FR. This would be mainly against big targets like SBQ, SB, sheepsquatch. Then make your daily the FE combat rifle since ultracite ammo are harder to make or get. That is unless you have 100k worth of ultracite .45 then I would just prime both to get max damage. Free aim is a bit hard on the fixer and combat rifle so mainly try to use it in vats to get the most out of your bullets.
---
I'm not holding my breath they bothered to make it usable in power armor.
---
Not sure this is entirely true. I have a B2525 fixer and handmade and haven‚Äôt rolled for a weapon from purveyor in a month. SS armour is being rolled now and once I have a full set of that in Uny then I‚Äôll be satisfied.
---
People buying duped godrolls and legacies for real money, so yeah
---
"Mules" other accounts to store stuff you dont use often.  Up to 4000 pounds of stuff.
---
&gt; What reference are you basing this on? Conjecture? Speculation?
---
Firstly, all the numbers are speculation in entirety because nobody has an accurate up to date count except Bethesda and they like many other gaming companies are vague in their numbers purposefully. Secondly, the assumption that the number is degrading over time is accurate and both normal and going to happen organically in any game. My issue with your assertion is that you are assuming since January when that article is written, that number has only gone up which I am saying is absurd based on in-game experience near daily since that article came out and the steam numbers. Your own article, emphasis mine:
---
&gt; At the time of this writing, the player count for Fallout 76 is an estimated 22,000 to 34,388 players online for the PC version of the game, with console users for XBOX One and PS4 ranging at an estimated total of 400k users across all platforms, **showing a decline from the 1.4 million copies sold at launch.**
---
With that information in mind how you can you possibly look at Steam's numbers for Fallout76 and say that the 70% downward trend since wastelanders of active players the game is isolated to Steam alone and not only that, but somehow magically the playerbase has added 100,000 active players? Are we playing the same game? I logged in tonight before replying to you, to 6k active players on steam and nothing to do after server hopping three times. No foot traffic in my camp for vending, no nukes, barely any events and it was dead as a doornail. Even now there are 6500 players active on a [Friday night](https://steamcharts.com/app/1151340#All)! That is a big deal and to deny that the Bethesda launcher did not experience the same dip is ridiculous. See that number on that page? 32k during wastelanders peak, which meant if we are being generous then 64k players evenly split between beth and steam. Now that same page has a graph with a chart plotting the number since april. Explain to me how this dip can only be limited to Steam when steam is more popular than bethesda launcher in every way, and bethesda.net offers steam as a default purchase option? It makes no sense. 
---
&gt; Apparently 20K steam users did all of this.
---
This is your weakest argument yet. Firstly, that statistic takes into account all platforms which means closer to ~150k and even then the total pc players I am saying is between 10-30k between beth/steam now but likely a bit higher in January, at least 10,000 higher. Secondly, I personally was quarantined and completed the event dozens and dozens of times and currently have over 75 masks in my stash and was able to hop quickly between two to three servers in addition to my private server during the same hour and receive triple/quadruple the rewards for barely any effort and I learned about this strategy from this reddit which means many many others also did which skews your guess badly (what else was there to do during fasnacht except fasnacht!?). Thirdly, This Fasnacht day was extended from the normal 7 days due to the critter spawn bug to 13 days which means the community as a whole had significantly more time to grind for and gather significantly more masks which also significantly skews your guessing. Fourthly this number is across all platforms which I am saying is closer to 150-200k than 350-400k. So you are saying based on this fasnacht statistic rather than direct access to the active players on Steam that there are 350-400k users. Seriously? If you dont see the holes in that, then there isnt much point in continuing this discussion.
---
They did.
---
its called fallout first. You can use the private servers to usually transfer between your alts.
---
And to be honest it‚Äôs far more stable than i thought it would be given we‚Äôre talking about Bethesda.
---
and given that we‚Äôre talking about Bethesda, you do realize your begging them to give you something for free, same Bethesda that basically put there hand out and said "show me da monah" when the players asked for a basic fridge, repair kits, and the color Blue, right?
---
Depends how far have you allocated your perks. Also are you trying to do bloodied melee or rifle?
---
uh, check the whitespring vendors. I think Raf (raiders armor vendor) has some from time to time.
---
[edit: words]
---
I don't think anyone is jealous but the rubber banding that you see on enemy health bars is the result of a bug cause that occurs on several legendary effects including junkies and instigating. There will be a lot of sad people if/when it gets fixed!
---
I tend to give my ammo and supplies away free of charge. Caps mean nothing to me in this game.
---
No, this should be baseline, fo1st is overpriced with such a few benefits. You can trade items with a private world right now you know.
---
You clearly never had to wait 20 minutes before. I have, and it sucked.
---
Sorry, bloodied commando build, was playing a heavy melee build but I'm getting bored with the playstyle
---
I don‚Äôt mind paying for fast travel. I need SOMETHING to spend my caps on
---
Yea, I was thinking about stacking the armor for sure. And I see what you mean, it would definitely be a chore making sure you have anough stims to keep yourself from dying. 
---
Sentinel armor would be a must have for a build like this to help keep yourself from dying too much as well. Ill have to find some armor an switch my build up a bit, but im excited to try it out. I'll be sure to let you know how it all turns out, that way you can decide for yourself whether its worth a try.
---
Count how many points you have to move and how many perk cards it takes. A good bloodied build is at least going to take you 50+ levels from scratch... I doubt it will take that long from where you are.
---
Edit: https://nukesdragons.com
---
This site has many resources, including builds and the quickest way to complete your build.
---
I honestly don't even know what cork is used for in this game. I always sold it to vendors before I got a scrap box to hoard it for all eternity.
---
Many here are complaining about legacies.
---
Then they can kiss my ass. I paid full price for a buggy mess at the start, no way im gonna pay for overpriced sub, before they fix their shit
---
Oh well that sucks, thanks for the help anyway.
---
Oh ok thanks
---
These are what I carry.
---
1. Bloodied Gauss Shotgun. One shots basically everything, I use it for ghouls and super mutants.
---
2. TSE lever action rifle. Just plain fun when the adrenaline perk is working. I use it for events like Guided Meditation or Line in the Sand when it's helpful to be able to one shot a ton of enemies at long range quickly.
---
3. TSE Railway Rifle. By far the most satisfying sounding gun in the game, especially that reload. Toot! toot!
---
Thanks for enlightening me!
---
Oh, that's me. Even though the BoS are my favorite faction, I make a lot of caps selling my junk to players.
---
This isn't a Fallout 76 issue this is a PlayStation 4 issue. My ex-girlfriend ended up racking up $300 in BS on my credit card while on her PlayStation 4 playing Final Fantasy XIV because of the broken bug with the messaging system. There's nothing Bethesda can do about this
---
I think there's a sizable protective zone around Vault 76 that stops players from launching nukes in that area
---
Ad Victoriam Brother!!
---
Guess I'm doing pretty well at 77 currently. I'm looking forward to getting myself some chickens tomorrow!
---
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
lol really? Lame but whatever. Not my idea of fun but ok.
---
I tried it in Overwatch menu and it freeze the controls on menu.
---
Anyway like i said before its not about the atoms refund or anything its more to prevent people to do unintend purchases with this system
---
I checked them all, maybe I was just unlucky as no one had any
---
Thanks
---
It just works guys. Ah plus side is that it only happens when de rng flips out and a godly item is rolled ;)
---
Guess I‚Äôm also doing good I‚Äôm level 74 or 75 and didn‚Äôt buy anything yet
---
My favorite that I own is my Two Shot Fire rate ultracite gatling. 
---
I would like an explosive one, but never really sure what to offer in terms of trades. (Also, I know the ultra laser never dropped as explosive. Will settle for a normal one)
---
Most everything I sell for 1 cap, missiles and 40mm grenades 5 each, 10 for a mininuke. I kept noticing 5.56 sold the fastest, I bumped its price to 2 caps/ea still sells just as fast.
---
You still need a perk to get 1000 rounds, which can be put elsewhere if you don‚Äôt mind halving your ammo capacity.
---
I think 1 cap per bullet is too expensive, considering how much I lug around and how much you can craft at once, 45 should cost 1 cap per 4, .50 is 1 per 30, and so on. Bethesda please let us make bulk ammo
---
Thank you. :) No I don't use the filters in photo mode. I try to keep everything as close to original as possible, sometimes doing selective lighting adjustments or colour tweaking after.
---
Hold up. Is that what that strange little blank icon on the atom shop is?
---
Wait, is that  Purveyor Murmrgh's new skin?
---
(I thought she was hotter when the previous model...but I can work with this!)
---
The forest area around 76. Then you'll be safe from nukes and high level creature attacks.
---
The BoS land, open the coffers, then turn and decimate us for unsatisfactory tribute.
---
Personally I'd rather have all the time invested into one character. If you reach a high enough level you can just unlock all the perks for multiple different play styles and change things up on a whim. If you need to move around special points you'll have plenty of points to do that as well.
---
When you mean container just anything other than a stash box?
---
I don‚Äôt think it does being I saw someone had it in a display case. Unless they keep crafting once it goes bad.
---
Primed guns can only use Ultracite ammo.
---
Just got rank 80 and probably gunna use the earned atoms for the last 10 levels. Thankfully have only been a victim of the auto complete bug once.
---
I think it‚Äôs a cool idea, for those interested, but doesn‚Äôt the server reset at some point and just kicks everyone off? You‚Äôd have to rebuild it... daily I think?
---
So can nukes land anywhere on the map basically?
---
You need ultracite ammo when you "prime" a guns receiver. It makes the weapon deal more damage and suposed to do even more damage to scorched.
---
It is more expensive to craft than regular ammo since you need flux and ultracite but it yields more bullets so many times it is more efficient. For example, if you want to use the LMG (.308) or the gauss minigun (2mm EC) it is best to go for the prime reciever and crafr ultracite ammo.
---
I would recomend you use this on your strongest most expensive gun. That gun you use only for SBQ fights and in the near future for Wendigo Colossus.
---
There're no fixed locations, nukes can be launched anywhere. Sometimes people will be gracious and try not to hit anyone's camp, sometimes they'll nuke wherever they want and expect you to move out of the way.
---
You have a few minutes to either relocate or server hop if you see your camp is in danger, so as soon as you see/hear the warning that a nuke has been launched, _always_ open the map and make sure you're not in the blast zone, no matter how unlikely you think anyone would nuke where you camped.
---
There isn‚Äôt one
---
Run Riding Shotgun. The caravaneers corpses will have them.
---
Tank you tank you!!
---
Is the event live???
---
If you are in your pip-boy... The badge count is how many you currently have in your possession, not how many you‚Äôve turned in. Perk coins I have something to do with the legendary perks, I don‚Äôt think anybody should have any of those yet
---
Nukes can fall almost everywhere. There is a small area around vault 76 that is safe. But you dont need to worry in general about nukes in your CAMP. People dont target other players with nukes because its a waste. It might have been a griefer, or you were selling thing way to high or just bad luck.
---
As to how to launch a nuke, just follow the main quest and you will learn how. No spoilers but it has to do with the Scorched plague.
---
I do too but it‚Äôs not always reliable.
---
I only have the outfit I wasn‚Äôt even aware there was a mask. I got it a while ago for free as a gift from bethesda. Looks great with the grey knitted hat and a gas mask though. No clipping
---
I check shop before login with zero problems, on PC, but that just me
---
You do know we are getting the BOS splinter group as a faction, there already demanding we supply them.
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Nji1wR3q5hoHOKwKQWnK5p1qhtub7O64XPGZxeimpI/htmlview
---
It's a $100 yearly subscription or a $12 monthly subscription. A lot of people buy it for just a month or two to build up a scrapbox.
---
In advance
---
Junkies, field surgeon, first aid, refractor, iron clad, blocker, power Armour user? Full health and high resistances with no immediate risk of poison, fire, etc
---
Yeah. I have had that.
---
I've also been getting this more often lately... XB1
---
Why not save them for atomic shop items? I get that the last levels will be a pain, but arent 10 too many? Besides, if you got to rank 80 this quickly you'll end in no time.
---
No problem!
---
Finally! A cause worth fighting for!
---
Yes, but I have several badges I've earned that are not showing up at all. That's my real question. Only way to tell what I have is to go all the way up to a badge vending machine and see there
---
Yes, anywhere except for the protective zone.
---
If you have a good amount of melee weapons on your main. I'd say make an alt so that you can spread out weapon weight and keep the good weapons. If you don't care much for the heavy weapons and are willing to trade them for bloodied commando weapons go ahead a move perk points which is double the work. Since you have to move the perk point then learn the perk card for the build. Can you post what your SPECIAL stats are now currently? Also will you be using VATs or free aim with the stealth commando?
---
Man. Tons of golf balls on ws golf course and ws. Good farming for cork
---
Hi, do you still need this doing?
---
Dumb question: How can I take part at the event?
---
I haven't seen anything about it in the game
---
I would like her too.....if the game let me complete her final quest.
---
Bloodied is fine, imo. Unyielding is so unbelievably busted it‚Äôs actually laughable. Literally +15 to all Specials, like wtf are you smoking, Beth? It breaks the whole game.
---
Make it +1 per armor piece instead of +3. Maybe let it include END.
---
It‚Äôs chemistry bench and you need blood leaf and a frog I believe. If your looking for the placeable it‚Äôs under floor decor. Just need the same ingredients
---
It‚Äôs a bug, hop servers they should show up.
---
If you are going from heavy melee to bloodied commando it might take you a lot of time.
---
I personally leveled my first character to 210 (currently) and have enough perk cards to play as heavy weaps, melee or shotgun with or without bloodied.
---
You can definetly do the transition but it will take some time. It might be better to make a second character in case you want to go back to your current build without moving SPECIAL again.
---
Sometimes both of mine show zero and I know I‚Äôve got badges on both of my characters
---
This. It is easier to just farm it.
---
Drunk for the brotherhood
---
I wear the gray knit cap, it perfect, unless that‚Äôs what you meant
---
shame pc only
---
There‚Äôs a zone where players can‚Äôt place a  nuke into. The image shows what a player sees when actually launching a nuke from a silo. 
---
The green zone is prohibited. That is the player can‚Äôt target that region with their nuke. 
---
The red zone is the area selected by the player. That is, the player can move the red zone around the map so that it is over the location that they want to nuke.  The game will accept the location as long as it does not affect the green zone

i‚Äôve found him normaly just outside on the road or were he‚Äôs normally by the grills
---
No, I just meant it would sell more. It's already $12.99
---
Yes and if you are in the circle, log out to save your camp
---
Hasn‚Äôt started quite yet, begins on August 4th I believe
---
I'll try that
---
*sad laughter* So yall too huh?
---
I would say the fixer. Specially if you dedicate your build around sneak. Sneak rifle builds are very strong atm.
---
Okay Thank you!
---
Haven‚Äôt decided yet so I may not but I‚Äôve been kinda neglecting animal crossing and my kids have turned our island into absolute chaos. Might just wanna skip the last 10 and take a short break from 76.
---
Or bug fixes for that matter
---
70 over here. But I will never be able to do another season like this
---
I dont see the item in the crafting menu for the chem bench but I do see it in the camp menu
---
Hahaha sounds nice. In that case paying the atoms seems like a good idea. Cheers!
---
Started like 2-3 weeks late and only rank 44. Will have to decide if the end rewards are worth buying the atoms to complete. That fireplace door really has my eye.
---
We should just make everything free and then pretend we‚Äôre using caps.
---
I will say that when it shows zero badges, it shows zero everything. Usually happens after I switch between characters. If you show caps or scrip...them I‚Äôm not sure
---
Bethesda would probably fuck it up though. ESO is developed by Zenimax Online, and at least they show some competence at making online features. Being inexperienced and also Bethesda, they'd would probably end up making more storage deleting containers if they tried to add mailboxes to FO76.
---
They don't give score if they auto complete.
---
I launch 2 copies on one PC , just lower settings when i need to trade.
---
Well according to the ESO Sub reddit, ZOS is pretty inept as well, lol.
---
Almost as basic a feature as push-to-talk but we saw how long that took 'em. Bethesda always gonna Bethesda.
---
No thats what the search bar is for
---
My dude, if this info was listed in a wiki I wouldn‚Äôt have posted this question.
---
I often find one in one of the offices in the Charleston Capitol building. I go there often to kill ghouls and get xp. 
---
If youre on pc I could give you mine. Its just in my stash getting dusty.
---
Ohhh those nuke cards lol i thought it wS some reward from the bot lol. Thanks for the info
---
No album?
---
it‚Äôs definitely science tab i see it all the time
---
K thanks for the advice And I don‚Äôt know if you get it their
---
Sry, Im PC
---
I think if you need volume yes.
---
Ur welcome üôÇ
---
Wendigo colossus is already in game? But this.
---
Pretty sure they added it with wastelanders, thats when i started seeing the tickets. They werent too hard to get at first but yeah they nerfed the droprate.
---
Nope, will start this 8th
---
I feel like text chat is like, way more basic. Original online RPGs were literally nothing but text chat.
---
What happens to the bottle in both instances? I assume we eat it as part of the process.......
---
As to why it feels so realistic. I feel like the enclave is at least partial influenced by real history. And thats why it feels so realistic. 
---
For example A shadow government allmost formed in the 1930s in the United states. The business plot of 1933 saw a group of rich companies/ people attempt to create a private army and overthrow president Roosevelt. If it had been successful. A new position would have been created that had all the power while fdr was nothing more then a figurehead. 
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Plot
---
The enclave themselves did not exist to the general public. Their were rumors and speculation that the president wasn‚Äôt running the show. But to the average American it was business as usual in Washington. 
---
vault tec I believe its been hinted at that most the board members had some ties to the enclave and vault tec was simply an extension of the enclave as a whole. The vaults were designed to gather data on real world conditions, the enclave predicted to encountered when they went to resettle America. 
---
Zax the rogue Ai from fallout 3. Didnt rule the United states.just the enclave.  The enclave follows a very strict chain of command and after the events of fallout 2 needed a leader. Zax who had allready became self aware and created a personality based on past presidents. Assumed control of the enclave and moved them to raven rock. 
---
All the enclave Artificial intelligence talked to each other. Modus and ravenrock zax we‚Äôre talking to each other until I‚Äôm assuming zax went off the rails.
---
Probably a mix of both. The Creation Engine was not meant for this and it shows. They probably tried, determined it would be too difficult to pull off or do so reliably, and then canned it. If they had better communication on issues with the community, this shit would be more excusable.
---
August 4th is update 21 but project Alpha begins the 8th
---
Wait a second. F76 is a MMO? ...damn, i thought it's a storage management simulator (with guns)
---
80 here, but tbh...I am unsure if I'll be able to handle another season of farming. They better add more ways to earn score like they promised..or that's it for me.
---
Idk i just remeber reading multiple people agreeing that there is a cap. So i thought id pass that along. With bethesda trying to tackle the dupers this seems like a pretty simple way to stop them at the gate.
---
Ok bud i gues weel see
---
Not yet. On August 4th update 21 drops with WC and legendary perks
---
But muh free karma
---
Building, crafting, repairing all of them. I think it first checks what you have on your body, then stash, then scrap box. I think it's in that order because FO1st was tacked on... like everything else in this game.
---
What if its account locked like score dailies?
---
They did with cleanup appalachia.
---
To do that, someone would have to tell Bethesda that appeals aren't personal essays.
---
I have no idea what you keep going on about weapons for, guy. I use a bloodied weapons. All I said was he had low health (like a bloodied build) I never once said he was useing a blooddied anything haha. I have exactly 0 clue what you keep goin on about. All I said was the dude was blooddied and he had a tesla and a mole miner gauntlet. All I can speculate is what I saw. A low health guy, useing a tesla and a MMG. Since when is me telling a story about a guy a debate? Haha. You are the one that said BE tesla and all that jazz. All I ever said was a low health guy (who I would assume was bloodied). We weren't in an event in was just me and a guy and he started attacking and I killed him. That's literally the whole story ü§£
---
How?  If Bethesda really wanted to tackle the duper‚Äôs they‚Äôre have kept them banned and not reinstated them with inventories intact. The other way of course would be to fix the dupes and then create an event that has a huge materials sink so that loads of duped mats just ‚Äòdisappear‚Äô
---
Congrats! I've ***never*** landed one in all my time in fo4 and 76 until about a month ago. Insane RNG on the pie. Some people get lucky, but I totally understand how exciting it is when you finally get it.
---
I like this. I've been trying to get people more excited about workshops and building in general. One of the biggest hitches is setting up a workshop initially and efficiently to be worth the setup and time invested. Maybe there is like a certain flag or call sign or tag to let others know in the "company" that it is friendly territory.
---
oh, I'm rank 52 lol
---
Dear God, I'm at level 52. If they hadn't upped the number of dailies I would have completely given up.
---
Quad does not do anything for your dps, only help with ammo capacity. While furious is 45% increased damage at max stacks. People will praise quad, but it is useless on most weapons. Like rifles.
---
Some numbers  [here](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html?left=R_W-TheFixer_L-50_ModReceiver-PowerfulAutomatic_ModMagazine-Standard_ModMuzzle-Suppressor_Major-FFR_Sneak_PHP-100_EHP-99_Hits-0_Addicts-0_BloodyMess-15_Kills-6_Boost-60_TankAP-36_Other-0&amp;right=R_W-CombatRifle_L-50_ModReceiver-PowerfulAutomatic_ModMagazine-Standard_ModMuzzle-Suppressor_Prefix-Furious_Major-Explosive_Sneak_PHP-100_EHP-99_Hits-9_Addicts-0_BloodyMess-15_Kills-6_Boost-60_TankAP-36_Other-0)
---
For bosses combat rifle will out dps fixer by a long shot. Even on Queen where the explosive damage will be almost zero, furious will win (you can test it by removing explosive from the calculator and looking at Queen dps). There is no point using quad just because of the ammo capacity, you will just spend more ammo to do less damage. Especially with 15% reload speed.
---
Other than bosses it doesn't really matter which you use.
---
Beyond the calculator numbers, this comes from 2000h+ in game experience.
---
Gotta have something wholesome to enjoy.
---
Well in Fallout 4, you can get it within 150 tries almost guaranteed.
---
Same. 40 caps to the Cranberry Bog? Please, take ‚Äòem.
---
That said, I do remember what it was like to be an early player who wasn‚Äôt rolling in caps. Pro tip, Crater is less than 20 caps away from Vault 76? (I have the travel agent perk, it does make a difference). Foundation is harder to get to, but Public Teams are really helping to add more free FT points! 
---
If you set your CAMP near Foundation and use Vault 76 as a free waypoint, you‚Äôll save yourself a lot of caps going back and forth.
---
I thought it took scrap first, like, you couldn't use the materials if they are not scraped, good to know now, thank you!
---
Just like I see a bunch if other people suggest, I can tell you that buying F1st for one month is worth it. I enjoy the atoms it gives and the scrapbox is supper handy. It can be a bit pricey, but I pay for it every other month and that seems to work for me.
---
If you dont want to pay, the drop most of your junk. Just keep the enssentials and flux. Junk isnt very heavy, but it adds up to hundreds of pounds.
---
I got two the same game session and character.
---
Did they really.
---
Yes very much so :)
---
This has never worked for me. When I either deposit stuff to the floor (I‚Äôve got the Halloween pumpkin thing)or container, and go back in another character, both the floor and container show up as empty.
---
I wish there was a way we could actually communicate our grievances with them and have them actually listen. Like, what on earth are they doing over there!?! Fallout 76 has to be making them a decent chunk of change and (with the exception of the Wastelanders quests) they're basically been doing nothing to maintain the community's support. The Atom Shop devolves more and more with every rotation with poorer and poorer quality content and more gameplay affecting features. The items provided on the Legendary Run are mostly awful and buggy not to mention how hard it is to reach tier 100 with just challenges. Basic quality of life features are completely absent. Like, what the hell are they doing? Have they just said "fuck it" and diverted all resources to other projects like ES6 and Starfield? Are they too focused on making new questlines to bother with anything else? I wish we could know.
---
Yep same bug here
---
Most times i have straight 0s in my collections tab. They are there just not visually showing.
---
But, I've fought it.  Others have fought it.  What else is that thing in the forest by where the sbq spawns?
---
Well I wish I were as rich as you. I‚Äôve always wanted to just go to every player‚Äôs vendor and just buy everything. The moment the player restocks, buy more stuff. Repeat until someone is crazy.
---
But I mean for real I think having more than one free fast travel point on the map (not camp or tent) is reasonable
---
They haven't fixed the no damage bug. Hell something as basic as the crouch sensitivity being different from standing sensitivity in 3rd person has been around for 2 years. Don't forget the messed up Power Armor sensitivities. They won't ever fix anything. What makes you think they will fix this?
---
Honestly, I don't really care when my friends do it. Only thing that bothers me is the fact that Bethesda hasn't done shit to fix it.
---
Come down to the Ragin Rocket on the PC servers where our prices are Ragin! We have the best prices guaranteed.  If you find it at a lower price elsewhere, we will deal with it as we see fit (not nuking our competitors shhh). Have a rocking good time at the Raging Rocket just south of Whitesprings Resort.
---
known bug being addressed next patch coming up
---
LEWD!
---
This is so sad. Julie play country roads
---
The game is helping you to keep almost empty fusion cores to use them to craft ultracite ones :D
---
Instead of taking stash space and camp budget by putting it on display, I put my precious junk on my vendor for 30,000 caps.
---
They don‚Äôt have communist stuff in the atomic shop for nothing!
---
This Bug is exactly why i stopped playing atm, it really sucks. It's really annoying when you travel from top of the map to bottom of the map... everytime you have to scroll down again and hope it works... rince and repeat.  (On PC you have at least a mouse, so scrolling is  a bit faster, i bet on consoles this bug is even more annoying when you have to scroll over the whole map).
---
When you're in a building it's even more annoying, as you have to walk through the whole building to get back outside and hope it works there. . Fix this... pls. Thx :D
---
I have an AAE gilded minigun that aomeone obviously glitched into existence, I traded for it, so I kept.it, it is cool :-)
---
Aaaah. That. Yes you were right, it is a "random encounter" you can get. There are several spots with a 10% chance of spawning a WC. That spot near the SBQ is one possible spawn.
---
But the event Colossal Problem that has a guaranteed WC will come on patch 21. That is what I meant.
---
But yeah, you were right. The enemy is in the game rn.
---
If you mean do I have photos to share no I don't. Sorry. Maybe I can work it out. Over all it was so good my photos probably wouldnt do it justice
---
It does have that feature in some form iirc. ESO isn't developed by Bethesda, so that's probably why it has it.
---
Right you are, we should get glass too. Hey, wait a minute, where did all those Nuka Cola bottles go?
---
I saw someone saying that it's a paint for the scout mask, but other people saying it's not.
---
Ah okay, cool, thanks!
---
I‚Äôve seen those bodies show up as meat piles after a while. It‚Äôs just annoying to wait for 10-15 minutes for that to happen
---
That's how the old bug happened. It only ever triggered after checking the atom shop or starting a NW match (which checks for NW favorites in the atom shop) before going into adventure mode. This one also seems to happen from game crashes while loading into a server, but it more or less seems to still be the same issue
---
*??? emote*
---
Nope, paper it up!
---
And I think it might go through the inventory alphabetically so if it needs steel and you have an "alarm clock" it will break it down instead of using the 11k Steel Scraps you have.
---
76, forest area / overseers camp, starter town you can‚Äôt select when nuking, rest is fair game
---
I would say that starting a berserker's character is the current hardcore mode of the game. They said survival isn't coming back but there's hope they might at least do something of the sort with harder PVE once one wasteland comes out. Until that hypothetical day, berserker's builds are the best we have
---
Im after a QE15r Railway myself.
---
My dream is a patch let‚Äôs me equip my weapons again
---
Nukes can‚Äôt be launched around 76.
---
Doesn't always happen, but checking atom shop from the main menu and crashing while loading into a server are the only confirmed methods of triggering the bug so far
---
Well, since they already had voice chat, push to talk would simply be adding a toggle with a button press (so one would think at least). Text chat is more basic, but since they already had voice chat in place, adding in push to talk should've been pretty simple too.
---
We have multiple accounts, lol. Bethesda taught us what we needed to exploit without fear of getting banned, we‚Äôll use it for good when needed üòÜ
---
Our bodies were given artificial compactors as implants while in the vault. Why do you think we eat every plan and recipe we come across?
---
What platform you on man? I might have to visit your camp lol
---
Are you on now? I can join if so. I‚Äôm N0GreenStuff so you know it‚Äôs me.
---
In the time you reload you Can shot other 20 times whith the quad fixers, so, Mor√© dps.
---
I mean, we did have hoax stories in the past. But right now the majority of that is happening on the steam forums. People got bored of coming here to make up random bullshit, that mostly only happens right after big updates now
---
Lol that's good idea! I like to have them as decor but for the ones i can't put on display yet i will do that
---
The respective vendor always displays the correct total, like the gold machine for treasury notes etc.
---
Well, they were reinstated because the player count plumeted and the servers were barren. Thats not good for potential sales, so they let everyone come back. And we know that they dont have the capabilities to access our stashes because of the vault 94raid bug that emptied people stashes out. The fix there was a generic gift to all those affected. Hmm this other way you speak of, "fix the dupes." I bet the guys that have to actually do that wish they could just wave a magic wand and poof! "Dupes fixed. All better now guys sorry we didnt do that sooner!"
---
Tbh, even if they stopped all complaining about that specific thing, they would all continue posting about the same other things anyway. That's what this sub is and always has been. This isn't the place to go for originality. I mostly just check the front page for any news, new discoveries, or datamines. You learn to filter through all the rubbish after a while
---
Quad will still lose. Combat rifle having extremely fast reload speed, especially with 15% reload speed.

Makes sense too, i have an steel extractor and 10k scrap at least and this thing takes my bird decor from the stash lol of course üòÖ
---
It spoils, anything not canned spoils (excluding pemmican). Like the pumpkin pie at the Overeers house, never spoils until you pick it up... :-)
---
+1
---
And let us share ss Armor pieces for transfer it to other characters, I think this game need it
---
If you take all the loot they disappear and then new ones pop in. There is a limit of how many meat piles are in one area for you. The same pile can be in different places for different people in case of post death movement of the corpse.
---
Her Name Is Sophia and no i don't think she does lol
---
Tsumz on PC
---
Can help out with transfering between your alternate characters, or storing your JUNKS. But please record down what you need me to deposit (like honestly) since I won't be bother to remember. Will be on 
---
9am-1pm / 8pm-11:30pm GMT +8
---
Cheers.
---
Hey at least with 4 you can get a mod to fix that.
---
By any chance do you still have the extra plan? I've been farming for a while and still haven't found a trick or treater.
---
That's the magic of RNG. Took me hundreds of hours and others it could happen twice in the same session.
---
Fuck Atlas and the BoS we should be able to eradicate them when they get here.
---
But furious only give you 3 per cent Mor√© damage for shot if I dont are wrong, and only while you shot the same enemy, for me, furious is useless
---
I don't really like that the sheepsquatch turns into the usual robot junk like a damn liberator
---
Geez, you're right.
---
TSE flamer
---
Fucking annihilates anything in your wake
---
what
---
Take a look at the link i put there. The calculator shows you the numbers. Furious is 5% per stack, to max 9 stacks = 45%. And that is why i said "for bosses" and "Other than bosses it doesn't really matter which you use."
---
Confused
---
Never had this work for me.  If I lose it, it's usually because the body has gone walkabout and is far far away.
---
If you're on PC you can turn off grass and gibbing from Bloody Mess.
---
One big problem is that it's client side.  Had a Sheepsquatch that did a nice ragdoll and it was in completely different positions for every single person there.  For one it was way down the hill, others was in water, others on top of a hill etc.
---
Not home right now to check my special, will update when I'm off, but the build I'm looking to do relies on VATS
---
The counter updated every 24hrs i think so it wasnt an active tracker. But we climbed steadily throughout the week. Then on the last day we were missing a bunch of scortched, like everyone was saying theres no way we could make it with our current rate. Now granted it was probably a weekend day so the player count was higher. But we all just did our thing, went to bed, and the next day or next tuesday all our rewards were given to us. Now if we really did that it was by the skin of our teeth, and lots of glassed caver exploiters. But its just not realistic. Youve gota relise the game was in a shit state at that time. Wastelanders was delayed. Fucked up glitches were ruining the game. And im pretty sure there was a vendor shutdown. So with all that low moral beth needed to give us a lil pick-me-up. And whats better than a week long event that brings the community together with a common goal and shared rewards? A shit ton of free atoms but they werent guna do that lol so we got the next best thing. A half assed event in atempt patch up a major hole that was missing from the game. Whats been going on lately in the game? A bunch of people are ready to delete the game because a core mechanic in progression is broken. What could bring everyone back together? A half assed event with a common goal and shared rewards AAAAND they made it BOS themed to really pull on those old fans heart strings. You feeln me here bud?
---
I look at it like this...if I see something on someone else and I like the item, it gives me something to work for. 
---
If I simply buy it or find someone who duped it (depending on said item) then I am left with nothing to work towards and the game becomes boring. 
---
Any video game is only as fun and interesting as you make it.
---
I fell like hes gonna get recuted and be like a hardcore BoS member
---
The devs basically abandoned the game. They can add whatever they want but if they can‚Äôt fix basic community complaints that came up almost 2 years ago that are very reasonable and make sense it‚Äôs like they want you to suffer. I played daily from beta for a year straight but the devs killed the game for me. And I poured hundreds into the damn atom shop.
---
I am 100% satisfied with my gear. I've got more guns than can fit in my fav wheel. And I use all of them. It's taken me a year and a half of serious grinding and trading but there's nothing else I want.
---
But we Have for example, junkie weapon,  Yes adicction Have penalties, but not very hard.
---
I don't have any good weapons but my bloodied death tambo is nice
---
Just to add to this in a way;
---
Using subtitles can help you find that cocky legendary supermutant or any talking legendary enemy for that matter that's not to be found
---
Will you be on in about 30 mins?
---
Have you got the future tec camp device?
---
That seems to breaking camps atm
---
I think I burned myself out too fast. I only played for about four months and got to level 200 or something because I was always farming and not really playing the game. Because it was the items I was after. I didn‚Äôt relax at all during the game is my point.
---
Ahhh, well just keep the explosive flamers and cryos in your stash please
---
That's better than phasing into Oblivion.
---
Actually Oxhorn was targeted  during his live stream, and it was obvious they were aiming at his camp. I think Juicead had to quick move but that looked like more of a "his camp was in the way" situation than a "he was targeted".
---
I know a couple of people set up camps that could be loaded near watoga location for whatever reason and they tried to build them like armed bunkers that could be loaded in after the nuke pops.
---
Riding Shotgun is triggerable.
---
You can sell Legendary weapons/armor as long as you don't have any Atom Shop skins on them.
---
It's always been that way.
---
The servers were far from barren. Maybe a large percentage were first monthly subscribers. That‚Äôs all I can think of. Ridiculous to let them back it‚Äôs basically endorsed duping.
---
pc
---
Yup, any of the empty containers you find around the railroad station is what I have used. Be sure to pre position both characters at the same location that way you minimize any hiccups. Don't panic if by chance the server goes down, just immediately relog. If it's not a long break, your stuff should still be there. Thus far I haven't had an issue with it.
---
Edit: There's always a chance servers shit to bed and  you lose some items, hasn't happened to me but could, just saying. Don't do massive transfers until your comfortable with your connection, etc.
---
bonus is so small? What... it's the same as junkies... put on a chinese stealth suit and you're invis with crazy damage. It's powerful in the right build.
---
How do you grind for them? I stick around westek and such.
---
No, there are plenty.
---
If you can't find any then start an encrypted, drop 3 nukes than do another encrypted.   There's your 20 notes for the day before doing the dailies.
---
You still get challenges as usual but you don't get any rewards.
---
The blue suitcase at Morgantown Station reliably works for me. There's also a red one at R&amp;G Station that I've started using.
---
But as other's have said there is an element of risk to it.
---
Vats means you need high perception and high Agility. Unyeilding will get you there but putting points in those special stats is a must. You can dump points in luck as well but I think that is more optional. If you don't have any on those special stats you need to double the leveling. One for allocating the perk point then obtaining the perk card that will kinda help get you in the right direction. My build is sneak commando with vats crit build. S2 P15 E6 C1 I3 A15 L14
---
How should I go about getting said items?
---
I usually just stick near westek
---
Yes, I am on PC though. Are you on that platform?
---
The issue needs to be stickied and consolidate all posts in one.  Bethesda mentioned this once a few weeks back and that's it.  
---
You can't blame players for wanting to post about this.  It's a massive bug that hinders the season pass.
---
I know what you I'm just there are people to drop all my known plans to
---
And with that kind of attitude right there, Bethesda has no incentive to fix it at all
---
Holy crap, seriously? Wow, that sucks.
---
Greeeeeeeeeat.
---
Great post and terrific suggestions. This would add such spice to the game, and open up subsequent gameplay avenues.
---
Awesome thank you this will help me out alot
---
I can be sure. Let me know on here when you‚Äôre on. I‚Äôve got the plan for the non auto prime handmade receiver so you can just have it.
---
I‚Äôm not a fan of the timer for buying and selling scrips/Caps. I get there has to be a limit but it really limits what I can do after a while.
---
Keep in mind they've added dailies, and I believe initially you needed 6 xp bonuses/week along with the challenges. There's room to catch up. Should be possible to make up some ground. With any luck, they'll extend the event as well because of the SCORE bugs.
---
Slayer weapons suck slayer armours are amazing for non junkie/bloody builds a flat 15% date negation to all enemies no matter your HP (provided you get all 5 being Zealots, hunters, mutant slayers, troubleshooters and exterminators). Like the amount of damage even in bolstered secret service armour with ironclad a super mutants with a minigun can do or the stupid high level floaters is insane without a piece of mutant slayers equipped and mirelurke kings as well those armour pieces that most people think are just trash can have real merit when it gets down to brass tacks. That 15% essentially allows you to get through high staggers or constant damage and pop a atom just in time.
---
Im speakimg from expereince. It was evening time in the USA and my lobbies were basically empty. Just a few people under level 50 and maybe a 100 something here and there. Yes i get that it sucks having the dupers back but they did it because they had to. Like it or not theyre a part of the community too.
---
You could conserve a lot of uniformity with blueprints, i think. But yes each reset there would be another push to reassemble.
---
Really hope they take some feedback between seasons, and don't just roll into season 2 after a short break.
---
And if people don't mention it repeatedly, Bethesda has zero incentive to actually fix it. Your post makes zero sense. 
---
" hey guys let me make a post complaining about people making posts complaining. I'm totally not a hypocrite"
---
She stops when she is out of trigger distance.  I stick her and the collectron on top of a 4 level building so they're too far away for their voice lines to be tiggered except when I go and collect stuff or do her quest.
---
I also turned the in game voices down quite a bit because getting a dozen moronic and repetitive voice lines as you run through Foundation to turn in notes every day is nauseating.
---
Not really. Even if I was running 5 extractors, I'd still buy your ammo. As long as it stays at 1 cap.
---
Yeah it's a bit lame.
---
There are some older screenshots of the nuke popping close to 76, that's from the Pre-beta Event they had at the Greenbriar, since the restricted zone is much larger
---
This is the build I'm going for https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#AwUOAgQCCQ0BAQEKAQIDBAUJCg0PEChPA3cDeAPwAQPEAQN7AxADPwO1AQN8A4ABA0YDQQELA6UBA/EBA1EDNgK7AQPVAQEA
---
 thats the problem I dont have the science tab
---
Depends on the item. Some drop from events, some can only be found by the purveyor (mainly 3* legendary items), others, like the asylum uniforms we just found via luck. 
---
If you are looking for items that can drop, I have had good luck with some player vendors. I have also messaged or mic chatted with some that had something I wanted but maybe wrong piece, more so with armor, and asked if they had say the left leg as I see they have the right in their vendor. Some have had said item and would trade for it, others apologize and say they don‚Äôt.
---
C o n s o o m the knowledge
---
So you're not actually looking for meat and leather?
---
Damn, never thought about it ahah
---
Oh, I would spend an hour a day at westek with not much luck. I would get decent items. Just not the ones I was looking for.
---
okay i think if it‚Äôs the frog in the bottle maybe there is actually a plan, i swear i learnt mine from a plan
---
I'm 76, and I completely agree.
---
I did a few NW dailies along the way too, but now that I know I'll reach level 100, I've stopped doing them. Not my cup of tea. I'll be glad when the season is over. Not going to try this hard next season.
---
Have you looked into any of the buy/sell groups on that social media giant (not sure I can say the name but it‚Äôs a body part and a good read)? 
---
Also, what in particular are you looking for?
---
Energy weapons seem to last a decent while though?
---
i have a plasma rifle dubbed "V.A.T.S. Spazma Plasma" that has armor penetration, increased vats crits and increased vats critical gain and i can usually use it all day before even getting below 100% (from 200 ofc)
---
its most likely the bugged explosive modifier, any weapon with explosive takes double the durability hits since each shot is registered as another hit to the durability and if you through 2 shot onto that mix you end up with 4 times the durability drain, really adds up on a flamer or rapid fire energy weapon.
---
i also have an anti armor laser auto laser with limb damage and weightless that still lasts a long time, still kinda sucks in terms of damage but thats likely due to the sheer shitshow of energy resistance most enemies seem to have
---
If your current stats not far from that then go ahead and change build, but if it's far I'd say make a new character so it won't take you twice as long. Plus you can play both playstyles if you choose to. I personally have a commando character and a heavy gunner.
---
No. I heard about this and didn't use it.
---
Fake news
---
Vanguard ap armor. I‚Äôd like heavy armor of any sort.
---
What would be the best way to get this?
---
If you even have three in Charisma, you can share a 1 star card.
---
Another bloodied build !! Welcome to the ultimate build lol

With "high level" being defined as ??  
---
I'd be interested in hearing how you came to this conclusion.   Not challenging, just interested.
---
im rank 85, jangles backpack is next finally! i havent made up my mind if i grind on once i got it or just play and ignore score and take what i get anyways

Berserkers is a dedicated scrip effect.

Scrap them and you‚Äôll learn the plan to craft them. Same with the metal helmet.

This is normal

i don‚Äôt believe it has that feature -Todd

Yeah this is the best method currently, hopefully we get the reworked ammo machine next week and we don't have to worry so much anymore
---
This.
---
lol. i remember being a sneaky stealth suit in my initial silo. About 40minutes in i started hearing gunfire and explosion. Was getting to the pipe repair. WTF?
---
10 seconds later a level 200 something PA .50cal carrying tank just barrels past me, wrecking  Gutsy's and Assaultrons that I am hiding from, throws me a wave and come here to follow him. I just left, embarrassed.  Few minutes later Nuke launched. Joined in the fun killing SBQ. After Scorched Earth I realised I would prob still be in that silo sneaking around if not for that veteran.
---
You sir, is brilliant!
---
As a lower level I do leader of the pack a lot and between the woods and wolf bodies being black and needing to clear the whole pack I often lose sight of where the legendary wolf fell. With the bushes and trees it takes me a long time to find it. Thanks for the tip.
---
Only 1 star I have are crap.
---
This is the truest statement I've heard as of late
---
No. Whatever the highest card is will be active, so if someone shares inspiration 1 and you have inspiration 2 equipped only your inspiration 2 card will be active
---
I have gotten some from the purveyor before, and I believe if you have the secret service armor plans you can roll the pieces and there is a chance you can get it. 
---
I‚Äôm not sure if there are specific events that it drops better from or not, nor am I sure what ap is. One of the markets might have more distinct advice then I do, as I rarely pay attention to what I get from events anymore. But one good thing is that 3* armor from the purveyor is only 60 script.
---
OHH MATRON
---
But you're one who started with "I disagree", and follow up with contradicting yourself. You're saying that health is not a class, less damage output at high health is problematic *and*  high hp and low damage doesn't matter because enemies are squishy. Then saying I am the one who fails at arguing. Sounds like someone has been learning from Ben Shapiro or something.
---
Despite all that, I can catch a glimpse of a good point in your ramblings.*Low health doesn't need to be a permanent status.* Even if you are wearing armor that benefits it. People are too used to the primary Legendary modifiers being the bare minimum, instead of a bonus that kicks in at certain values (except for Nocturnal which makes the armor stats worse if requirements are not met).
---
Being bloodied and unyielding is like Bruce Willis at the end of Die Hard, becoming rougher when the fight goes on
---
The catch is that if the BOS is like Wastlanders then No, I'm not going to try and do the Brotherhood quest line AND anything remotely resembling this board game. sorry, but that is just going to be too much hassle to even try and do.
---
Seriously I got Fallout first in part so I could just Ignore the weird daily challenges,  do what I wanted and still get atoms. for me the private servers and stash box were a bit of a bonus
---
Thanks a million. I‚Äôll give this another go.
---
You can do the challenges but you don‚Äôt get any reward. You finished. As far as Bethesda is concerned, they have done their part. LoL. It is one of the reasons, personally, I am not rushing to get done and just making sure I stay a step or two ahead of the alien.
---
Yup
---
Yeah i reached level 100 a few days ago, sucks that after that you get nothing from dailies and weeklies. Even a paltry amount of bullion or even caps for each level after you reach the end would be better than nothing. Especially as there's still over a month to go
---
Unless your stealth suit is level 25 (or broken), a Berserker's weapon will actually do ***less*** damage than a non-legendary version. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/IwIiIEQ.jpg

yeah it just says score rank 100/100 and max rank

It's not a glitch! It's a feature!
---
My karma is so damn low from what I‚Äôve posted that I can‚Äôt post/comment anything without at least about an 10 minute gap in between
---
Yup, not only that. Sometimes I don't even see workshops on the map, they're marked as normal locations for me, but I remember the names more or less. Very inconvenient on public servers tho.
---
I‚Äôve started a public team before as team leader and the game has randomly kicked people from the team with the note that they‚Äôve been removed. I certainly didn‚Äôt remove them.
---
Oh god, there is this thing that happens to me where I die 5 second before the the event ends and the legendary is killed and it doesn't let me respawn no matter how long I wait and I end up having to reload the game and not getting the loot.
---
Ok. Couple of things. One servers open as they fill. So you wouldn‚Äôt have noticed any less players on a server. There arnt 100 servers open and players spread over them so you wouldn‚Äôt have noticed less. You may have notice less high level and a larger percentage are new players with the advent of game pass etc. And two. I don‚Äôt see cheats in an aspect of life as a part of anything tbh. Looking out for yourself isn‚Äôt being part of a community
---
If you are present at the camp, you can hit each enemies once with Tenderizer, which heightens any damage input done to the enemies
---
Like I said, the weapons are ok, but literal downgrades from the current meta effects. Get 30% against one enemy type, or 50-100% against all enemy types. The choice isn't hard. They need to either be 100%+ against the specific enemy, or 60-75% after nerfing some of the bloodied synchronization
---
Yup, it is a current glitch/bug. If you are missing the standard icon for workshops, the current workaround is to completely close the game and reopen it. This has been an issue since the last few updates. There are some other suggestions on here as to why it happens but honestly, it seems to be random.
---
I was able to move my camp to test a lot of spawn points.  The pet spawns on the camp or a few yards away from it North I believe someone said.  Thank you everyone for your help!
---
The amount of times I‚Äôve spammed the button only to have it switch to the other menu...
---
I assume not, but is that midpoint adjusted for the fact that we had fewer challenges available for the first few weeks?
---
Yup. This is completely normal :)
---
10 is 1500 atoms, plus I believe you get 500 back at the last level. But anyone who refuses to grind anymore and want to buyout should atleast consider doing all the weeklies until the day before event ends, cause they are crazy good for ranking up

Does the faster fire rate effect really only increase fire rate by 11%, like that site shows?
---
Sorry I think with Sophia's questline there are permanently stuck bugs.
---
I have been on the last part of her questline since April. 'Talk to Sophia back at camp'
---
Have reported, and tried every work around recommended as well as others. Nothing worked. Aside from starting a completely new character or Bethesda fixing it it will prob be here to stay for some unlucky to get hit by it.

You can sell any legendary weapons or armor to any vendor for caps as long as you don't have any skin on them. Not sure about gold bullion items, probably not then, but normal legendary loot you can sell at train stations for sure. When I was on scrip max and needed to clear my stash and didn't wanna to just drop them I sold 1* crap to the vendor.
---
Seems like you cared enough to leave a comment
---
The sucky part is that if you lose the normal icons, you lose the ability to travel to the said workshop for free via the map because it no longer considers it a normal workshop and just a standard location. It seems to sometimes let you still travel to it for free if it is under attack or is marked as an event.
---
No, at least that they don't, everything uses damn budget.. except for wallpapers/floor skins.
---
Always look on the bright side lol
---
I dont have that in my chem station
---
It stacks, but DR gives you diminishing returns in this game. A full set of vanguard's armor is +175 DR at full health, which will leave you at 425DR/395ER while at full health. You will still be flimsier than PA since those have built in damage reduction on top of the DR, and honestly you can trade off some of the pieces for something else. You would benefit far more from a zealot's or mutant slayer's piece than raising those points up just a bit higher

---
Season one ends mid-September.
---
Just to confirm for readers, you cannot not sell gold items
---
Can‚Äôt drop either
---
this is what I found out the first day of using it. it does speed up a process a bit, but if you have an ammo you need in the same category you should be careful. I once got carried a way and scrapped a few rounds of ammo I needed xD
---
This and text chat...those are the only two things I want added to the game, fuck every other thing...updates, patches, DLCs, events...all of it...don't care. But give me text chat and a way to give my other accounts stuff...and I'll be a happy wastelander.
---
You can sell the machine tho! I once crafted a few pieces of SS armor, they had not the traits I wanted so I tried the machine and it accepted them.
---
I guess op is talking about the Insurgent, if you look it's more than just a color reskin, there's geometry differences:
---
https://imgur.com/a/xh0zphW
---
Beyond the different bags strapped on here and there, the most obvious is the different scarf, but also elbow pads vs knee pads (along with pant geometry looking cinched), and waders vs clear laces on the boots.
---
Though I like the scarf on the insurgent better, but I don't like how the top and bottom have the same light grey, makes if a bit too monochrome for me, nor am I that much of a fan of the bottom of the waders since my machine has the shiny-things are bugged issue.
---
Any source on it still being a drop? All the info I gathered said they stopped dropping in early 2019/late 2018. Haven't seen anybody report a new legit drop in way over a year.
---
Nm found the datamined answer, it's not a legit drop anymore but apparently it's *technically* possible for it to spawn on any minigun if the game engine bugs out, since even though it's not in any existing loot pool, it exists as a default mod for the weapon. So the real answer is that there might still be a tiny chance under the right circumstances, but it could also be impossible due to recent fixes or changes to the game code
---
Yes you can. Previously before gold you could go up behind someone and buy back their old legendaries. Now the game deletes them instantly when you back out of machine.  So you do get scrip but they made it so no other player can ever have your gold items
---
I'm a little ashamed that I never thought of that myself. Thanks, OP!
---
Some people are very familiar with the game and could be spawning directly on a high end container.  They can easily pick up a weapon very quickly if they spawn beside a container.  I wouldn‚Äôt call myself a Nuclear Winter expert, but your best chance of survival is spawning away from enemy players.
---
Nope, I have the same problem. It's just how it is. I had in my possession 5 or 8 badges but it showed 0 only for the badges, caps and other stuff shows correctly. Server hopping doesn't help, sadly.
---
Market subs got flooded multiple times with both the gilded miniguns and bats during a few dupe waves, to the point where one of them just outright banned trading them for a while. Both were also infinitely farmable via the workshop exploit earlier this year. The bats are only level 1, so you can at least tell the fake ones, but the exploit created level 35 gilded miniguns and legit ones only dropped as level 35 too. The vast majority of them are duped or created via exploits
---
If you're still into bloodied melee weapons and on xbox I have a few that might peak your interest
---
No. I replaced her with Gramps because his words are motivating. Sometimes
---
I tried to fast travel 15 times in a row and it never worked so I got off and played a different game...
---
I have a junkies explosive combat shotgun that‚Äôs carried me for 20 levels. It one shots almost everything, but only when I use V.A.T.S. Otherwise the damage back tracks :/
---
+karma
---
Oh boy.. I once accidentally sold something and quit and then it hit me, I ran back like crazy but it was gone forever. That's kinda lame. at least you should be able to buy back items you sold. can just make it like any vendor with unique inventory if they're so afraid of gold items exchange.
---
A mailbox at a train station. You can mail up to X amount if items to a character.
---
I misread add as "adds", and got hyped for a second there. I'm playing through Destiny 2 again, and it's just night and day when you have a team of devs capable of actually developing GAS into an actual functioning title even after a rocky release. 
---
I'm curious has 76 been announced for next gen consoles yet? I can't wait to see the shit storm if they do another physical release with it's current state.
---
a full set of secret service armor (all pieces modded with the highest dr) will already be at the threshold where more dr is barely noticeable.
---
going for other effects with a fully modded secret service armor like flat damage reduction from enemytype will definitely benefit you more
---
so it does stack but from 350ish on further dr is barely noticeable
---
Haha i am over level 220 and I sleep in other people's tents and play their banjos. No one gives me anything though instead they shoot at me or admire my outfit (many havent seen a red asylum in person before). I wouldn't give a 220+ player with a red asylum anything either though!
---
Jokes on you. Mine just vanish from existence
---
it stacks up to level 3
---
example: 4 people in the group all share inspirational, but effectively only 15% bonus xp is given
---
You are welcome I‚Äôm a lvl 198 player not that high but I try and sell everything under 500 caps including legendaries and I go out of my way to sell all the plans new players need under 50 caps I also think that it‚Äôs just amazing. I was missing the last bobble head for my collection and a random player gave it to me for free so in return I have him a legendary weapon
---
Me too. My poor shotgun shells.
---
On xbox you can hit b and a over and over.
---
Got to 39 for the Sheepsquatch Plush, then did 1 more cuz that was easy free atoms, im done for 2 months
---
Check the Angry Turtle video about Empath. It also works on you when you're in a solo public team. So you take net less damage with class freak lvl3, which works almost like maxed lone wanderer (he took 1hp damage more compared to lone wanderer).
---
I look forward to hearing about it. Been snagging items I find in people's shops to give it a try. An interesting thing about the armor choices is since you plan to break the armor anyway, level doesn't matter.
---
So, finding a level 30 armor piece with the perfect rolls suddenly is godly.
---
You're right that berserker is fun to play but not sure I agree with your set up. Broken Chinese Stealth can tank the rads, and you are invisible the whole time so can't be beaten for stealth. Plus you have max damage for berserker always. The perk that uses a medkit if you go below 30% health is a nice thing to save you if it all goes wrong. I very rarely die when using it including scorchbeast queen / encryptid events.
---
I ran into this issue too, I thought I could bring the value of the wasteland Walmart to them! Why... With our crazy low low prices.. why trade your caps anywhere else?!! But I've found that sometimes for whatever reason... Player camps don't always show up on the map,  so I just decidedly to say eff it and move back to my old spot.
---
West tek, white spring, harpers ferry, the burrows, genial steaks House. Different events. The purveyor. And a shit ton of trading imin the sub that we can't name here
---
I think you meant to say "fill as they open." But buddy, your trying to tell me what i saw. Thats just foolish. And no im not on xbox so again your just spitin giberish. Oh and i dont care about your ideolagies. Have a good day.
---
The worst, most of the time, it try to put you back on the same server, not on a different one.
---
yeah he's doing it wrong. Broken chinese stealth is the end of the discussion.
---
The caps cost on travel is another visual bug. If you own it it says it's going to charge you, but it doesn't. If you don't own it it says you can travel there but won't actually let you when you try.
---
Yes I‚Äôm bloodied still and on Xbox. Let me know what you wanna do
---
But you can not sell crafted legendaries.
---
Lol. U think there 100 servers just say there and the players spread evenly?  As a server gets to a certain point a new one opens. U didn‚Äôt see less players u say servers with low levels that don‚Äôt show on the map due to no vending machines in their camps. This argument for duping is ridiculous. It‚Äôs not remotely based in fact
---
I found out a giant tent is the same as a tiny flag in budget... How's that make any sense.
---
oh god i thought i was on the destiny sub and was about to see someone get yelled at for asking about resilience
---
You‚Äôll need 9 Commando, 1-3 tank killer, 1 concentrated fire, 1 in radicol (whatever it is, up to you on that one), 3 in serendipity. Then there‚Äôs sneak maxes and all the optional agility cards like gun fu, adrenaline, and covert operative. Four leaf clover/grim reapers sprint. 
---
Adrenal reaction and eagle eyes mutations. It‚Äôd take you a bit of levels. 60 on a new toon to unlock cards and get fully set up.
---
Only leather, acid, springs from bears and XP, I'm a veggie üòç
---
It doesn't, nothing about camp does to be honest. I spent 3 hours building a new camp in the mountains yesterday because 1. I couldn't scrap a few pieces in my previous camp because of the stupid bug. 2. item needs support while it's green and other fun like this.. Also display items taking space in both stash and camp budget is just ridiculous.. They need to rework camp building thing, but I'm scared they'll break it even more xD
---
Question ‚Äî the ‚Äúyou‚Äôre already behind‚Äù *isn‚Äôt* random or just a thing that ZAX says? I totally thought it was. It really means something?
---
I know loading in at different times is a huge problem for a lot of people (maybe even me, lol). My advice is find a place to spawn every time that pretty consistently has good loot and then build a strategy from there. Develop a plan for what to do if someone else spawns where you did ‚Äî you can check this by having the map open while it loads. 
---
A counterintuitive strategy is to spawn by yourself in the middle of nowhere and look for loot as you go along. Sometimes I try this when I‚Äôm just trying to casually get my Deploy 1 CAMP challenge, and I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised at how far I can get by taking an unconventional (unpopular) route into the circle.
---
I try every time I see a machine. Never gotten anything. RNG owns me.
---
I recently moved from near the Wayward for that very reason. Its utterly impossible sometimes to place a camp. It frequently where new players throw down their camp machine to advance the quest
---
I need the perk card to give the legendary ability to become unclipped and travel through the map to find all the vanished meat pile goodness.
---
Didn't know you even CAN get it from there xD I thought it was a trolling machine, just like in my youth those machines with toys lmao.
---
It is pretty frustrating, unless maybe these huge herds of stags and bears is a bug also so the whole thing is a broken spawn mechanic? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
94 here and I'll definitely not do another season if the systems stay the way they are.
---
Only reason I got that high so fast was due to being stuck at home "thanks" to Covid and having fuck all to do.
---
Now I've reached a point where the entire game and all it's silly time gate mechanics just bore me. I log in, trade for caps, do the dailies, get my gold, get scrip, log off and do something else. And if the BoS quest line ends with us having yet another dumbass currency with yet another dumbass limit to it the game gets uninstalled.
---
you cant
---
i love heavy laser turrets tho, very efficient
---
Thanks for the info, I'll have a look tomorrow when I can log in from not being so hungover ü§¢. Yeah the damage rate drops from about 330 to 200 something (can't quite recall) and I haven't compared it to a non-legendary version though so that will be interesting to compare. Not that I've had to use it, those stealth suits are super stealthy. I'll keep an eye on this thread because beserkers intrigues me for some reason but I've not done a lot of research on it yet as you can tell so any extra info would be nice to look at. Cheers!
---
The only thing killing their Atom Shop profits is their dumb "fake scarcity".  
---
If they kept more items permanently available and just rotated the special offers they'd get folks buying stuff they saw other people using, whether it's reduced price or not.   
---
On topic, though: Meh. Maybe they'll learn for future seasons and add specific content unlocks tied to specific challenges. The SCORE system is just more grind, basically the opposite of what most folks want.
---
&gt;There is a limit of how many meat piles are in one area for you.
---
That would explain things, there is simply a max number of loot piles possible for a player in a given area and if the game spawns over this number of NPC when killed the game runs a 'clean-up' algorithm.
---
Some good weapons have a minimum level. Keep playing. Craft one if you have materials.
---
At 76, but having  just learned that you get no rewards (zero, nada, zip) for daily and weekly challenges once you've finished, I'm going to slow down. 
---
So long as I earn 2000 SCORE each day for the rest of the run I'll be good - and that's easy to do.
---
Nice
---
The reason I am so late to start playing the game is because I loved single player fallout and didn't want other players griefing me and harassing me. I only play a couple of nights a week and didn't want that time ruined. I was so so so wrong, the other players are 100% opposite of what I thought they would be. My first time at a high level players camp I was nervously checking their vending machine, bought a couple of plans then, BANG,BANG,BANG, I almost poo, spin around with my gun out and there is the owner of the camp shooting a brown paper bag. I walk towards him/her, they wave, in the bag there are 5 plans, ammo and a couple of prices of armour. I was delighted and also felt a little bad I had nothing to give in return.
---
I once saw a level 18 punching the queen. wearing only in a vault jumpsuit.
---
I would of been fine waiting another year or two for a Fallout Multiplayer game.  
---
Just imagine all the things they could of done with a new engine.  The code and engine is probably one of the main reason why we don't see these obvious qol things that any other game gets.  
---
When you really take the time to think about it, its really absurd how much the game could be improved.  Its plastered all over this sub day after day.
---
I tried to log in and play after the seasonal update, but I end up exiting within 5-15 mins.  My Fallout 1st sub expired, so dealing with inventory is such a pain and takes so much time.  The list just goes on and on.  
---
All that being said, I did enjoy the time I played while wanting to play.  I had tons of fun in this game.  Its just hard to stick around and keep having fun.  Maybe its just a me thing, I get bored and lose interest in things way to fast.
---
You could help Bethesda track down the autocomplete bug, one experiment a day:
---
* stay logged in while the challenges reset
---
* log out from NW before the reset, log into adventure after the reset without visiting the atomic shop or NW
---
* log out before the reset, open the atomic shop after the reset, log into adventure mode
---
* log out before the reset, log into NW after the reset (no atomic shop visit), log into adventure mode
---
* log out before the reset, close the app or cut the network connection while you log into adventure mode after (no NW or atom shop visit).
---
Thanks. Most of the time I don't even see my legendary weapons as a choice when I'm at the vendor. Why not?
---
Try to put your camp somewhere quiet and boring with little to no enemy activity.
---
People tend to launch nukes where there are enemies that might become glowing ones during a nuke.  I've found that even Morgantown isnt safe from the occaisiobal nuke
---
And then watch us lose all the things we send cause they can‚Äôt program something that advanced lmao
---
Just another DOH by mr
---
Oh okay
---
&gt;What happens to the bottle in both instances? I assume we eat it as part of the process.......
---
Relevant VLDL - https://youtu.be/VjXOwUnJzA0
---
Could very well be.
---
Besides from the non existent decay timer this is the other reason we don't like those shitty plasma.
---
Zealots or mutant slayers?!?
---
No. Just no.  Why trade a benefit vs everything for a benefit vs only select enemies? 
---
Yes there are diminishing returns but that doesn't make high dr/er worthless. 
---
The better advice is to look to tertiary effects like sentinels/cavaliers (which is why armor is better than pa), and perks like dodgy,  lone wanderer,  and serendipity to simply ignore whatever damage gets past the dr/er.
---
Oooh what did you get?! Mr fuzzy toy? Blast radius board game?
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇlove it! You need craziness like this in the game just for entertainment and laughs!
---
Lol, no.
---
I didn't say it does happen every time. The other way it can happen is if you played NW before the reset, which is why it can happen hours after. (Again, this is not every time, in fact this is somewhat rarer than the other one)
---
I don't mind helping them out I've been giving goodie bag out and used all my gold making deep pocket armour to help them along. What I am sick of is the constant message I keep getting I need this give me that. It is starting to wear thin.
---
Yeah it feels...unfinished to just leave him there crying. I went in once just to check up on him and he was asleep, with ghouls lurking right outside his door.
---
Higher level players giving stuff away aren't looking for anything in return so no reason to feel bad.  Part of the reason we do it is that we have way to much crap to begin with.  My stash probably has 150 lbs eaten up just with known plans.  Constantly trying to get rid of them so they go in the machine for 3 to 5 caps so that low levels can afford to buy a bunch at once.
---
I think it was always in the game but they added the tickets with wastelanders but they should have been from launch
---
Considering Beckett feels like the most asexual companion I've ever met.. this still amuses me. He's trying so hard to pretend he likes us!
---
I don't give a f**k anymore. Level 30ish.
---
WoW Classic is much worse in this regard...
---
Probably because I have modded them?
---
Yeah, I've watched all their vids, was wondering if anyone would, link that lol, other favourites are horse pocket and cross play/aiming one..that's the best
---
This reminded me of that one guy during the beta that came to my camp and proceeded to destroy it then he killed me and cannibalized my body while hysterically laughing in the mic. By far the best experience I had in 76
---
Is it wrong that I wish they would give us one that conveys the sentiment - ‚ÄúF*** Off‚Äù  and  a big ‚ÄúL‚Äù for the donkeys that one-shoot everything
---
This. It‚Äôs the worst when a car explodes and sends all the enemies you killed sky high and then they just disappear.
---
I am on 65 and i am ready to stop the grind is boring me to no end.
---
I got a lot of scrap.  89x Steel/Lead, 65x Cork, 100x Pre-War Money, to some examples of large quantities after redeeming all 610 Tokens.  There's more but I'm quite forgetful.
---
thank you so much for this. I had no idea
---
Zealot's or mutant slayer's, depending on which enemy you fight more. Maybe even troubleshooter's if you like to run a lot of nuke silos/encryptid. Raising your DR when you're already past ~350 is pointless, you get no noticeable change out of it. Meanwhile, 15% reduction against an enemy you frequently fight will be very noticeable. You can still stack everything you just mentioned on top of those effects too. All I said is that it might be worthwhile to replace a few of the vanguard pieces with something that will actually help
---
I found 3 x diff type of gauss mini in a cigerrette dispenser. Wonder how did it happened?
---
just read ur own commentary. u totally confused urself. 
---
ur topic: When my lvl 50 RP food build Archer kills a lvl 150 bloodied guy useing a tesla.
---
and these ones:
---
...he had low health (like a bloodied build)...
---
.. I never once said he was useing a blooddied anything haha..
---
... All I ever said was a low health guy (who I would assume was bloodied).. 
---
I know exactly what I said and I understood ur story. There is no need to repeat it like 5 times. And u could see I responded to another guy about shooting other players during some events and it doesnt have anything with ur topic.
---
take care. no more responding here bcz it is pointless.
---
Yes. U r right. Not the limbs
---
I literally just received an SSD, copied the game over and tested it. I‚Äôve only done it once but-
---
Standard Xbox S digital HDD-
---
0:50 Xbox menu to start menu
---
1:07 start menu to loading into camp 
---
With external SSD-
---
0:33 Xbox menu to start menu
---
0:43 start menu to camp
---
So 1:57 vs 1:15. The camp loaded in almost immediately and ‚Äúwhole‚Äù with SSD instead of piece by piece like it used to. 
---
As I‚Äôm typing this I‚Äôm testing Destiny 2-
---
Xbox menu to the Tower (home base)- 
---
HDD- 4:36 (yikes)
---
SSD- 2:33 wooooow
---
Furious weapons are amazing in my opinion,not too over powered nor weak just perfect
---
yes, if you have no marsupial: to get to it jump in the balcony on the side of the building the harpers vendorbot is loitering in front of then jump over to the broken structure
---
Instigating Lever with 50% limb damage, crit head shots do over 4K dmg, non crits are around 3k.
---
This is very helpful. I didn't know a safe zone existed
---
I seriously cant understand why people have such negative feelings towards the daily challenges. Every day I've been able to mark them off with absolute ease in a matter of 30 minutes. But no matter what I see people on this subreddit constantly saying the challenges are too hard or they gave up trying. Or hell just this very thread someone said "They cant handle another season" 
---
I'm just so genuinely confused on why it's so tiring for some but a walk in the park for others.
---
Spawn at Vault 76. It fixes it, then teleport back to the event
---
I personally run vanguard. Almost full SS set. My resistances are something like 500DR/600ER/125RR. It's viable, plenty of fun.
---
Do you use any skins on them? Or it also could be because they're unique? I can't sell the ones I got from quests to a normal vendor, only to scrip machine
---
finally he is going to gather the ingredients for the cookout. 
---
I hope he quits asking me for the ingredients every time I step in the toxic valley.
---
I'm tired of the grind myself, but what else would you propose that wouldn't be as grindy for SCORE? I'm genuinely curious for different ideas!
---
Can  you please go to official company forum instead of make post on 3rd party website
---
Go ahead and add AllHailMartyG. I'll be on sometime  in the afternoon and we can figure something out
---
I found out you need to sing up for the scout thing with the yellow ms.handy
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇsorry to say but that wasn‚Äôt me!
---
This happen to my 50 cal ammo. But I didn't have it for sale. It's like they reached in and just bought it.
---
Guess I got lucky, I only craft ammo for heavy guns that goes 100-180 per each time you craft. But it did count 100, not 180 when I crafted it. Well you'd be unwise to craft something that has few or even 1 bullet in the pack for the challenge. Or just craft ammo you need because.. well you'll need it anyway :p
---
Bird-bones gave me a gizzard, and the glass from bottles helps grind all that tough mirelurk jerky!
---
I had someone run straight towards me from nowhere wearing cultists Skeleton mask and outfit screaming at me in the night whilst roaming the forest..... as a noob! Really caught me a beauty and just laughed as I ran awayüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Best possible thing they could do is give you SCORE vouchers that you can give/sell/trade to other players.
---
A few people dislikes the slow motion fall... if they have birdbones, strange in numbers buffs that too, with an even more slower fall.
---
I‚Äôd be OK with having to dust off my clown or responder suits for a few atoms
---
When the legendary perks come, only that time will be impottant to use a full set of same PA parts.
---
so your missing the plan
---
right i‚Äôve done those quests
---
Quad bash damage double barrel shotgun. One-shot one kill. Love using gun fu and just laying waste to everything.
---
Patch on Tuesday
---
Soo. Who played since day 1 with energy weapons.
---
They've been super worse. Even after the Buffs they still are barley tier 2.
---
Todd promises to fix the feature
---
Saw someone on here suggest opening the bank in Morgantown a while ago. Thatd be cool. Robot vendor there that stores 50lbs in weight between characters or something, although Steelheart would probably have to change his route for Back on the Beat. They really need to make it so rep carries over on characters too. I've levelled 3 characters now and I shouldn't have to do the rep grind with every one of them.
---
I actually meant Skynet from the terminator series but that's pretty cool o.o
---
How about you keep scrolling and not let something so insignificant bother you? Not to put down the people that are affected by the bug...I would be pissed too, but IDGAF about the posts about it.
---
We need a bank sort of system like they have on ESO. Your characters all have separate stashes but you have 1 account bound stash (probably with only 100-200lbs of space) that you can use on any character
---
Flux and improved repair kit is the only reason I do it now
---
The flamer only works if you bash the thing your trying to heal with it. Go figure, shish is much easy to heal with.
---
I was going through camps seeing what people were selling and I saw some guy selling one for 10000 caps and I thought what a joke I eventually made my way back past his camp for a quest and I figured I‚Äôd check see if he restocked any ammo and someone had bought the pie
---
It‚Äôs not a bug it‚Äôs a feature - Todd
---
So true.
---
How do you mess this up anyway? It basically works with any other Terminal.
---
i‚Äôm on pc can help
---
I played after wastelanders do I get it?
---
That makes sense that VT is an Enclave subsidiary. Makes perfect sense now that I think about it.
---
All these descriptions of Berserker's tactics are really making it sound like fun, reminds me of just starting out the low health build the first time and not having the perks to stay alive. Very intense and fun.
---
If you go to a possum vending machine it shows how many you have. Also perk coins are for the legendary perks coming out soon
---
This was covered above but thank you!
---
Yep, i second that. I also think that the engine is one of the limiting factors here since it was never made for an "online" or "mmo" game. I really liked the game while i was playing it (i'm about 700hrs in, minus that 200  idle hrs :D), but now... there is absolutely nothing to do (i don't count that S.C.O.R.E grind as "something-to-do", it's just an awkward grind for some, in my opinion not-so-pretty cosmetics). 
---
This game does not provide a challenge in any way. Everything is too easy or builds are too OP (Hi bloodied build, or junkies build, or heck.. any other even shit build is kinda semi-OP if you know how to use it). 
---
I know you want to make everyone happy and play the game, that's ok ... but for me, a player that is looking for challenges (and for me... getting that rare outfits or whatever is NOT a challenge), will keep looking for them, because there ain't none atm! You can solo anything and everything ... easily!  So why not add something that's worth playing for? What about content that can only be done with a Party of X Players? What about something rewarding when you do that Party content? What about something where you need a "strategy" to down it or complete it. (Like Bosses that are not just bullet sponges .. Hi SBQ!). You could give the SBQ only 50% HP, or add 50% HP, that wouldn't change anything, it's still waaaaay too easy. Bitch doesn't land anyway!) 
---
I totally agree that there are people that do not want this type of gaming, they want to chill, build bases, collect flowers...whatever. But i don't see a problem here as you could OPT-IN to that content, and if you dont want, you dont have to. .... a well.. there is so much to improve ... i could write a book about it.
---
I'm sure there was about 30 seconds of thought and consideration that went into that "veteran" reward. It was clearly just a miscellaneous atom shop item they wanted to get rid of. 
---
They could have given us something like the Overseer's outfit. That makes perfect sense. An modified Vault Suit. Cause you know, we came from a vault didn't we??
---
Nyet, only if you had an account that had logged in prior to the Wastelanders release. It's not that great anyway, you're not missing anything.
---
Ah ok
---
This game has needed this for a very long time lol.  They could even make it a cool Pony Express type of quest.  Some dude that rides around on a yao Guai or a Deathclaw that delivers mail.  Full set of armor plus a weapon, a weight limit as far as junk, ammo, meds, shit like that.  Would be pretty sweet.  not holding my breath.
---
Until we can benefit from it of course. Then it‚Äôs a bug that needs fixing or the devs get decapitated.
---
I'm confused too. I'm new to 76, so I don't know what the daily and weekly system was like before score. I've played other mmo's and their daily and weekly quests are terribly grindy.
---
I also think it‚Äôs pretty easy, I finish my daily‚Äôs in 30 min or an hour if I do NW and I finish the weeklies every Tuesday in a about an hour also, then I go about my day of nuking and killing. Easy peasy lol
---
I think it depends where you are in game and life. Getting Score is like taking out the garbage. Kind of satisfying but not fun. I don't want to take out the garbage every day.
---
If they *confirmed* they should cause problem for everyone. They just a theory. Only confirmed with video proof was staying online during reset
---
Also Unyielding is a real problem. SPECIAL+5 to 15 bonus means ~10-30% more xp from INT, that alone speaks for just how fundamentally broken it is. No other armor will get close to giving that kind of benefit. Then there's the fact you become a VATS god with insane hit &amp; crit rate, pass every skill check and more. 
---
If you have anything else than Unyielding you are at a gameplay disadvantage because you will gain a lot less xp than Unyielding users, especially compared to those with low health builds.
---
Bloodied is OP with its synergies. Unyielding is broken, borderline xp-exploiting.
---
The other armor and weapon effects all need better synergy.  Vampire, medic, berserker, anti-armor, Nocturnal,  ect, ect.  They all need to be reworked big time.
---
Timed event.  You can‚Äôt trigger it to best of my knowledge.
---
Trust me, you'd have a lot more fun doing it yourself.
---
Never considered having an alt chr, but now I might just do so.  
---
I shall name my new alt, Bob.
---
I know it should be up to Bethesda fix this, but if you are tired of waiting around while nothing happens, get rid of healing factor mutation. Completely fixed the bug for me.
---
For everyone
---
I'm xbox, but I'm only level 33? or so.  What level are the enemies?
---
It‚Äôs a Halloween event but I did get it myself a few months ago. It‚Äôs jsut random I think.
---
Grind it out. Hunting rifle is probably best for your level, maybe use rifleman perks to up the damage. Crafting though is a fun past time. Better to do it yourself
---
There aren‚Äôt really and perk card synergies for junkie. The only build that benefits so hugely from perks and armor is Bloodied. And the perks they use basically make their 20% health nearly as effective as my full health. Half the time, damage doesn‚Äôt even land. When it does, the large DR given by Nerd Rage (obviously combined with their armor and other armor perks) makes sure you don‚Äôt 1 or even 2 shot them unless you‚Äôre also bloodied. The whole game is just a 1-shot-fest lmao, who VATS‚Äô who first. 
---
My original point was, Bloodied (on paper) sounds like it‚Äôs suppose to be a glass cannon build. But it‚Äôs not. They in fact are very tanky, and that‚Äôs dumb.
---
Not if it‚Äôs that classy screw-top wine.
---
You gonna be okay?
---
Correct. It has done for months, I doubt they‚Äôll change it now
---
I‚Äôm on PS4
---
If you are on PC I can craft you one
---
it's just a regular old event, happens every day at random times.
---
I sell practically all legendaries to vendor without any doubts. 
---
Or give them to low levels or leave on stations
---
I think it's vaguely like Assassins Creed where an ET AI basically has run civilization since the dawn of man and had a good hand in our own genetic engineering.
---
Seems like a common theme for things these days and I'm wondering if there's some merit to it. I can imagine being a barely sentient ape and seeing a glowy hologram and worshipping it like a God.
---
The junk extractor near Pleasant Valley Station....................
---
Useful link, shall bookmark that. Now I know not to bother checking for the rest of the week!
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs the problem with putting your camp in high traffic areas. Are used to have mine just across the river behind it, and I think my record was 10 attempts.
---
Also keep in mind, sometimes it‚Äôs just proximity to other camps, not that there‚Äôs an actual camp in your spot.
---
These damn daily level up challenges have me starting new characters a lot for easy level ups.  Occasionally I'll leave the vault and see death from above and join at level 2 if I can find a public team mate to travel to.  
---
Not really going for the event but just because I'm sure a few people will be like "what the hell is this jackass doing"
---
Rather yes)
---
I have no idea what they were thinking sticking one on top of West-Tek. Immediately torpedos the rarity of the pie and makes the machines rather pointless.
---
Lol. Not sure if they had that in the 50s Fallout alternate universe.
---
I really get this sense. He seems... Mostly harmless.
---
If you have members first you can transfer items on private server, drop items at a stop you know and move to the toon you want the items on and retrieve them. If being a member isnt an option than public server and in a team with a trusted friend, drop items in a spot that's not well traveled and join that friend with the secondary toon, you run the risk of both you and the friend being disconnected from a public server and loosening it for good. If you are on Xbox and need items transferred via private server security my gammer tag is Noobnoob2400.
---
üëçüèªüòÇ
---
Where we you when wasteland got dead?
---
I was farm west-tek
---
Motated vaulter destroy it
---
Oh no
---
o i hit SCORE just playing the game doing my own thing. People stress themselves 'chasing' the board when they could just be playing the game their way. And see SCORE as a bonus.
---
Sometimes I think people just do 'gaming' wrong :)
---
I‚Äôd be cool wit the feature if it also works with the assaultron head weapon
---
Avoid camping in popular spots and this message isn't a problem.
---
I usually just use a private server. If anyone needs someone to anchor add me PSN Phawnix
---
Unlocked it in the store?
---
Wine, rum etc. 
---
Good idea
---
Yeah it says the bog wander outfit is unlocked
---
I think mask is separate in the store isnt it?
---
Prior to scrip this was very common. The whitespring vendors were almost always full of junk legendary items.
---
Nice 1
---
61 right now, it's what's keeping me in game but and it's nice. Some of the challenges are kinda much and I this should have been 3/4 the length it is.
---
I thought they we‚Äôre bundled together as the outift says it comes with the mask
---
Nah, we won't, since Bethesda likes to roleplay Vault-Tec in real life :D
---
Perhaps,this is from memory, I can craft the mask.
---
Also they may have spent alot or materials on a workshop like me
---
Strange then I don‚Äôt know if this is because my first ran out a day after I claimed the outfit but Kinda annoyed as i wanted to do a jason cosplay
---
I've currently got a foundation and a set of stairs sitting in front of my camp 
---
Its my own fault for not just building 5 doors for the challenges hahahaha
---
I'm crying on the inside
---
Nothing confusing about it. People have different tolerances for grind depending on their personality, age, and where they are in life. Yes, FO76‚Äôs daily grind is relatively short, but that doesn‚Äôt make it any less demoralising and tedious over time. And if you want to hit lvl100, that‚Äôs still a fair amount of time. ‚ÄòBut it shouldn‚Äôt be easy!‚Äô I hear some of you cry. No, it probably shouldn‚Äôt, but there‚Äôs a notable difference between progressing through skill and just being dedicated/stubborn enough to punch your card every day. Seasons was built around the latter, and it gives pretty much any reward you snag a sour taste. That many of them are bugged is just the icing on the cake.
---
it's because the amount you need goes up by 25 each level.
---
It can also happen if you've not been playing for awhile and just login, the dailies and weeklies will be missing.
---
Mask and outfit are two different items in the store.
---
1 character. All perks and perk points to spare later lets you play any build you feel like when the fancy takes you. That's how I do it.
---
I got a be hunting rifle level 5. I just got 40 scrip
---
They had decent customer support back then, these days if you say anything about a bug or a problem they either ignore you for weeks on end, or immediately lock your ticket...
---
Well shit then i guess I didn‚Äôt claim it in time .
---
When I die at the end of the event it doesn't let me respawn at all and I'm forced to reload the game
---
At this point it seems like something they need to do just so some players can keep up to others.  Being able to mule chems/meds, ammo and gear really sets those players on an entirely different playing field than everyone else.  
---
Just from a trade perspective I spent last week doing some business in the trade sub's discord and you could always tell who had access to mules because the sellers had dozens/hundreds of weapons and armor for sale and the people buying stuff were often doing so with hundreds of flux.  
---
There's a whole economy out there that's not open to a large percentage of players due to inventory limits.
---
Deep down I kind of wish they could do the exact opposite so that there were an actual rarity to some stuff rather than everyone using mules to hoard everything but that would fuck over trading in  general, so better they go all in and let everyone do it at least.
---
Bloodied is only 200% damage when you are at 1 HP. At 20%, the threshold at where most player are using this, the bonus is "only" 80%. Still too high in my opinion, but i just wanted to state this out.
---
They‚Äôve given extra daily‚Äôs to try and compensate people for it.
---
3rd time I've seen this since I posted it and it got shot down for some reason. Really hope it comes to the game at some point, sooner rather than later as well.
---
Who the hell is julie
---
Yeah, I tried greandes and mines and still couldn't down a Yao Guai. I think I need to find a solo lvl 16 one and soften him up.
---
Did they say anything about raising the points limit? I don't even understand why there is one if you could use it all day.
---
Think of it as HOLLOW POINTS for Scorched.
---
Oh, good idea! Thanks!
---
‚ÄúHug me, bleeder!‚Äù
---
nope. if they ask, i'll do 1. nothing goes over asking. had this 8 times since i did this and gave them even more ammo they liked. so, win-win for the buyer.
---
The ultracite laser for some reason shots the green plasma projectiles in NW.
---
I was looking for a reference to this. Thank you for making my night.
---
I‚Äôm 55. Are you doing the repeatable weekly? 100 SCORE is so damn measly though! Hoping for a double XP weekend before the final push.
---
Probably different teams.
---
If you‚Äôre a rifleman or commando, try and pick up a fixer at level 20
---
Can anyone tell me where in the build menu the Nuclear waste barrel planter will show? i cannot find it.
---
at the rusty pick cash register i found probably the sum of 35 large present‚Äôs plans
---
With explosives weapons yes but with luck perk that replenishes durability and level 5 gunsmith I repair my laser gatling very rarely.
---
I do use plasma one too.
---
Just use proper perk card setups? Even without gunsmith my weapon lasts quite long.
---
I do repair my weapon with weapon artisan to 200% always. Weapon durability was never issue for me
---
It's already getting a relatively big nerf come the next patch with them having fixed the hp regen bug with +HP and speed demon, actually. Now you actually have to use stimpaks instead of just facetanking everything and regenerating hp because of the bug. I forsee a lot of low health build players dying in the future because of it. In fact, it might make vampire's weapons more viable solely because survivability is more powerful and useful than pure damage. Especially when you have overkill damage that pretty much nothing in the game is designed to withstand.
---
Just got an Urban Scout Mask earlier this week. The only paint options I have for it are Ghilli (Legendary Run), Atomic Camo (Fo1st), and two "no paint" options which change it from Urban colors to Forest colors, which I didn't know was a thing.
---
Accurate
---
The bottom right quarter of the forest will get you high foot traffic and it's a pretty big area. Just chose a new one.
---
This^^  its happening so much more lately. Your right about going across the map. So tedious to do it multiple times.
---
A tanky glass cannon is... just a regular cannon.
---
That's why I have no interest in running a bloodied build full time (I use some of the related perks and emergency protocols for SBQ because I've lost the flux too many times! )
---
The game is easy enough, so I don't need to breeze through everything even faster.
---
Sometimes it still tries to put you back into the same server. I usually find out who‚Äôs in my spot and block them. 
---
Not ideal but seems to limit it happening to me
---
What's the name of the best mod for the SS armor? Or is there only one mod to increase Dr and er?
---
You could fix bloodied immediately by attaching negatives to low health.
---
Imagine if being below 25% health meant that your limbs couldn't be healed. At all.
---
i remember one time when i was helping my friend with enclave events and it was shortly after a Fasnact event and i had a spare jester and so i took everything i had on off and chased him and he screamed
---
Why would they do that when at the minute you have to have fallout 1st to do that;)
---
Could of gotten pretty good trade for it. People use low lvl guns to lvl their mules.
---
Next as in patch 21 next tuesday? I haven't read anything about it.
---
The game auto completing the daily and weekly challenges has been very demoralising...
---
Alt F4
---
I think so. Saw a vendor with 16 Witch outfits in a stack priced at 1 cap. Tried to buy the whole stack, got a message about how the "server cancelled the transaction" or something. Tried buying one at a time, only able to buy one.
---
Guy later messaged me, I offered to return it, he had two, gave him some Flux he needed in exchange since he didn't need the caps.
---
i met a lvl 200ish recently in a red asylum dress with no hat on and i dropped him a red hat... 
---
but yeah its like figuring oit a present for soneone that already has all the stuff :)
---
Is that halfway point counting the fact that you earn enough Atoms to buy the last, and most expensive, 10 levels just by going through the run?
---
I know that 1 picture going around completely ignores that 10 of the rewards are 150 Atoms each meaning you only have to get to 90 and then use the free Atoms to buy the last 10 levels if needed.
---
It great to see this answer actually getting upvoted, too many times I see a ‚ÄúVanguard not worth it‚Äù getting downvoted. 
---
That being said, I was under the impression that it started at 300, hell, if your observant you can start notice at 266 and up (Heavy BoS Torso and 4 Polyscout limbs)
---
Only 64?ay least I know I dont have to panic about missing score or 2 next time and can chillax more. 90 now and will easily finish constantly trying to make sure brain fungus is up is annoying lol
---
Reply what is your level? Usually the ones for the Daily quests are a bit easier.
---
That's one of the most underrated aspects of the suit, I'd say. That for a lot of stuff, you don't NEED to fight, despite the sneak attacks, because you can literally walk on by, or with high enough agility, literally bump into enemies and then walk away. 
---
Love it for Distinguished Guests, since lower levels can handle the enemies, I can just sneak around and collect all the plates and centerpieces.
---
Same for Dropped Connection and A Real Blast. Just sneak around to the beacons.
---
I'm new here, IGN:RayRayNg üòä
---
The legendary perks wont land next week. They will be released on patch22, or when the season2 starts.
---
Thought of this video as s9on as I read that comment
---
Ohh. those are skins? Nice, i saw a picture of a weapon so i havent even clicked of it fearing that i might pick it up and waste a good weapon later on. Ty!
---
They were actually fun tbh. My favourite was when we had to do a mission to track down a camera which only spawned randomly then repair it for the associated challenges of taking pictures of various things throughout the week. And it was fairly easy to get hundreds of atoms per week. 
---
They pretty much all but removed any use of the camera and film which is really lame. 
---
This is way too grindy for the handful of items I‚Äôm interested in.
---
Which would be awesome if they fixed the bug. Now people auto complete 9 instead of 5 daily‚Äôs lol
---
I would pay 5,000 atoms easy for a FU emote.
---
Ah, guess I've been reading outdated information. My bad.
---
Go some where else
---
Blocking them does nothing.
---
Someone did the maths ages back. 
---
A 200 Damage attack which is a high and rare damage attack at DR 300 will do less damage with a single -15% reduction than boosts it up to 475 DR via Vanguard. And that type of attack is biased to high DR, it gets more in favour of Slayer gear at lower damage levels.
---
Buttressed
---
Cool thanks
---
Seems to me like people complaining about something that was never really promised to us, but would love to be proven wrong and be shown a photo of the mask in a comm from Bethesda. All I knew about was the outfit.
---
LoL maybe if enough of us say that Bethesda will do it. 5,000 caps a pop. They would make a bundle in profit that day. Even if they only offered it for 24hrs.
---
And again, it just works
---
I don‚Äôt get it I have the mountain scout outfit and have had it for a while I did not know there was a headpiece
---
Dense on chest. Maybe a jet pack if not...
---
It never left, Bethesda didn't care enough to fix it!
---
Already past that so yay!
---
I got two recently in back to back tries. I‚Äôm goin to put them in my vendor for 5k caps and see if someone will buy it.
---
[You ever get a melody stuck in your head?](https://i.imgur.com/DBOc8Rb.png)
---
I'm now using all 5 of mine, each with a different build. But being unable to share the gold bullion crafted items between them is a real pain.
---
1. Bloodied Heavy Gunner in Strangler Heart PA
---
2. Junkies Heavy Gunner in T65 PA
---
3. Berserker Commando in busted Chinese Stealth
---
4. Bloodied Shotgunner in magic unyielding armour
---
5. Bloodied Commando in leather sneak unyielding with SS Jet pack
---
Lead lined. See if you can walk through nuke zones. 
---
Chest piece ive got that reduced stagger as im a melee build. Im yet to buy any other stuff as im not playing as much as i would like.
---
I'm at 80 and should make it by simply doing all challenges every day.
---
I already have been doing all challenges evey day since january 2019,so this season was nothing new to me. They're pretty much the main reason I fire up the game.
---
Thank you for reply! I figured as much that jack of all trades might work to some point, after that i would need to specialize in particular weapon build.  
---
Due to main SPECIAL allocation im down to either Str (shotguns/heavy guns) or Per (SMG/Rifles). Tho SMG/Rifles sounds fun, i kinda feel that Shotgun/heavy will get me further or, atleast, make some things a bit easier because whatever build i looked into Str simply feels more tanky.  
---
Its also down to PA or not-PA. I see comments that PA is actually quite sustainable.  
---
Is stat allocation same for both PA and non-PA builds or i can dump excess Str to different SPECIALs since carry weight/backpack dont apply to PA builds.
---
Always wondered if you could walk in nuke zones with no PA. Did you actually try?
---
I have some wicked awesome level 15 handmades, vampires, bloodied, instigating. Giving them away with 1k 5.56. I cannot use them, lowest level 105. And they help level 15 out so much. Not worth the scrip.
---
Psn snow-ninja
---
John Brown is an interesting guy. You see art of him all over Kansas due to his role in the Bleeding Kansas/free state conflicts. It usually looks [like this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragic_Prelude?wprov=sfla1). 
---
Also, wow, that building changed hands/locations a lot.
---
Yeah the 1 time in 100 it goes wrong is painful. I lost a lot of good guns. I would say the best thing is to go in purposefully and just do the transfer, don't do other stuff or fast travel after dropping stuff. I go the Vault 76, down the steps to the bus and use a case in the bus that's blue. Then log out. Character swap and STRAIGHT BACK to private world, head to valut 76 and grab from the bus.
---
The time it went wrong I put stuff in the ice bin by the purveyor then headed in and did some scraping and stuff. Then as I came out to add more to the bin the game crashed. I reloaded it but then it said server not found over and over when I tried private world until the 5 minutes was up and then the world was gone forever with my loot :(
---
Yeah. I think I just skipped a lot of challenges at the start lol. If I'm honest I'm not super bothered if I don't make rank 100.
---
Hope you manage to make it!
---
WAAAAAH, SUPERMUTANT....
---
WAAAAAAH, HU-NAM......
---
\_:D
---
*You smash the bottle like the barbarian taught you.*
---
As the other guy mentioned, Legendary perks aren't coming next week.
---
The perks for different armor weights have also been removed and replaced with different perks.
---
Junk is normally fine. You just got unlucky. I reckon there's about a 1 to 5% chance it fucks up on you.
---
Good morning :) or good day i guess! Im on PC EU. Will do, im trying to get as much info as i could because i dont like bugging people around and wasting their time with something that i could find easily my self first. Its just that 76 is a bit overwhelming and despite net being full of exceptional guides that explain a lot and in a nice way (i found out about boy scout backpack quest by looking at one) they can be super confusing for newbie to fallout and im getting the feel that just by blindly following them i might miss something that i wont get back to since i kinda got what i needed and moved on.
---
I've upvoted in an attempt to maintain visibility but I disagree, maybe try it yourself sometime to see the results. You don't need a full set of troubleshooters or mutant slayers but a piece or two from your most commonly fought enemies can make you tankier than you could possiblyimagine.
---
Same
---
People have tried builds with maximised Rad Resistance in the PTS using also the What Rads Legendary Perk, and  a radaway every other minute or so was still needed to survive.
---
Although there are also bugs that make one immune to rad damage completely. You can stand naked inside the tunnels in Rad Rumble and not die.
---
This wasn't even a veteran reward though, right? Wasn't it just if you had an account before wastelanders?
---
Dude....
---
What ?
---
Separate items, I had to claim them individually
---
How many times did you get the bug?
---
Not my experience.
---
Strange didn‚Äôt show up separate for me
---
Some needs to dupe it?
---
It's really good, much as it pains me to say it.
---
&gt; hp regen bug with +HP 
---
What??? First time i hear about this bug :V
---
You wait for it to come up on rotation.
---
Same for me, im on ps4 in the u.k, and my psn is the same as my handle on here, will have to change my setting to except messages, but will be on early evening
---
Yes. It‚Äôs always been that way.
---
Those were the days! They may have been junk to the people farming whitespring but us filthy casuals thought we had hit the jackpot every time we went shopping there!
---
The totals become visible as soon as an adjust is made to the total. Everything could be showing zero, change your cap amount, caps will now show the correct total, Scrip something, Scrip will now show the correct amount. Badges change so rarely that they stay showing zero for some time.
---
Just that you went into the atomic shop, went to the first tab, and only claimed one of the items...
---
Just a big... 
---
‚ÄúDude... that sucks...‚Äù
---
Someone tried an under map glitch near fissure site prime and he got wiped out from the nuke it was funny.
---
Honestly I‚Äôm annoyed with myself but im not buying first just to get a skin I don‚Äôt wanna get back into the scrapbox addiction again
---
She says "I shook those nightmares" on loop (joke)
---
It was banned because it could be acquired with a glitch. They were never massively duped.
---
with full secret service(no lead lined), glowing blood pack &amp; radshield it gets down to +12 rads which is manageable, you can get it slightly lower as radshield sometimes can stack a few times(not sure exactly how it works). As a junkie's build it's ok, probably would be tough on bloodied.
---
Didn't junkies in FO4 increase with each addiction? 
---
They could have them all max at 99, based on low health/dr or max addictions, and then a sliding scale as the health/dr goes up and addictions go down, which is how bloodied works right now, I think. 1% health is 99% extra damage, right? Do the same with DR, where 100 dr is equivalent to standard weapon damage, and anything over 100 dr gives diminishing returns. 
---
For junkies, just make it divisible by the number of addictions
---
Its 50 rounds... are you kidding me?
---
Of all the things to complain about.
---
If you are high enough level for the ammosmith perk you should have enough lead, acid, and steel to make 50 fucking rounds.
---
Jetpack !!! Its so fun ! 
---
Once you have it you cant without it. Like with the marsupial mutation
---
Me: PS4 user looking for something like a space bar... Keeps opening workshop build mode...
---
Great to hear you guys have a work around, hopefully we'll get one for consoles soon!
---
Go for the limbs first, then the jetpack.
---
Have you ever read patch notes?
---
Also as the other person said, file a ticket or discuss in official company forums what your specific issue is
---
No shared perks stack.
---
For whatever reason there are players out there who will get there early, grab all the ingredients, but instead of depositing them farm minuscule waves of liberators. They also sometimes then decide not to deposit the ingredients at the last moment, watching players run around like fools looking for items they hold. Player level: Trash.
---
How is it with the marsupial mutation at the same time?
---
I totally get that. I bought it for 1 month finally because I wanted that outfit and the emotes. Can‚Äôt support the subscription (I never thought it was right to of scrap box in there). I was weak.
---
I knew about changing the color.
---
How did you get it? I've been trying for one, but no luck yet.
---
Carefull, wallpaper will store things, and wire certainly takes budget, my generator is permenantly unplugged now...
---
It‚Äôs going to finish off this Legendary Run and part of the next one
---
Get the limbs. Its going to take a bit to get decent rolls. The sooner you start, the sooner you finish.
---
That would be awesome!
---
This hilarious post deserves to be upvoted to a number divisible by 5.
---
Dense on the chest, wait for ultralight to be released for the limbs.
---
They won't? Weren't they supposed to release with patch 20?
---
Honestly a really good idea!
---
It is slightly amusing that you talk about wanting to carry hundreds around but don't want to make one to find out if they spoil.
---
Yes, they spoil. Enjoy the rest of your day.
---
Its incredible. And If you build a yeet 2000 in your camp its even better
---
This can work. Yesterday I participated an Encrypted event and killed 3 legendary gutsies.
---
After 10 minutes search I did not find any of them. Went to my camp to stash stuff and went back. They were there.
---
Absolutely Not.
---
Yeah, it supposed released with season1. But they where underwhelming, so they pushed it back to seasons2.
---
This has been happening to me for months. I‚Äôve paid and it says I need 1st so I just pay again. It means that the next month I don‚Äôt have too. I put a ticket in and they said I needed to contact psn. Not had much luck with psn either.
---
No, we need to post about it as often as it happens, Bethesda's utter refusal to help NEEDS TO BE CALLED OUT!
---
Well it looks like it's underground
---
Funny thing is, Bethesda 'fixed' this after the first happy feedback and experiences came in and showed their intention to change everything that benefitted players. Mind you the similar event in the same region didn't get fixed, only the one that people were happy about.
---
Here are more details [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-W1DPhUCRpQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-W1DPhUCRpQ)
---
It seems to be fixed now in the PTU ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TimVc8Lhcxo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TimVc8Lhcxo)), which is a good thing. Nevertheless, the bonuses from unyielding are still massive, even if you would only go for +2 instead of +3 now.
---
that actually makes sense
---
Screw tops these days - but 1950's type stuff would indeed be corks.
---
Ah, thanks
---
The account wide, separate stashes along with the retalent kit would be the most sought out ATOM items if they were available.
---
It's so you can't just fast travel to safety when under attack.
---
So you bought the game twice? Or is it possible to get another account?
---
I tried to run two instances of the game, and it even works... until i had to log in. When second game logged, first was kicked out with "logged from another device" message.
---
Move somewhere less popular?
---
I learnt something new today
---
Thanks I thought you had to trigger it
---
Definitely. I just did the enclave quest on another toon and thought how sinister they sounded. Cant remember thinking that the first time I did the quest.
---
Thanks for the knowledge
---
We should get diabetes from sugar bombs.
---
Me. COUNTRY ROAAAADS
---
For PS4. Highlight the ammo type you want then press X to exchange the ammo, and then O to return to the previous page.
---
Selling for his old raider "friends"... So two birds in one shot - he got caps and Wasteland gets another raider corpse... :-)
---
A word of wisdom: with SS arms and legs you're looking at mind-numbing RNG lottery, trying to get the rolls you need on all armor pieces... With jetpack you get, well, an awesome jetpack.
---
You think the game needs it you you need it?
---
the faster sneak speed mods for legs, the melee damage mods for arms (if you like to bash) other than that i wait for ultralight
---
There is a way to prevent it that someone posted about a while back.  You have to not stay on servers without your camp or something
---
Oh you just noticed, should have been level 60 or 70, but you finally checked and it's only 17?!
---
dev said on nukacrypt
---
I do the same. Followed a player through the prison to give them a lever action the other day. Took an anti-armor pump shotty to a lvl 15 at their CAMP last night.  
---
It's better than leaving little bags of scrippable rubbish at train stations, like I do with everything else. I'd much rather have somebody get some use out of it.
---
well either this is stupid, because why then we need it at all if it doesn't show correctly. I honestly don't even look there for that reason, I'd rather go to an actual vendor and see from there because the pipboy data isn't trustworthy.
---
If you have 1st you can put all your stuff in a world chest on your private world and switch characters, all that stuff will be there
---
yeh i‚Äôve returned to ingame miles were i logged out from, and been moved to wrong locations
---
Both üòÇ
---
No it doesn't.
---
Nukes go wherever people want to launch them. The only safe area really is around vault 76 and the overseers camp. 
---
If you see a nuke coming again, log out. They rarely go to the ash heap anyway, so you prob don‚Äôt need to worry.
---
You can't access the map with this bug.
---
You got change??
---
Dudes been on here begging left and right for handouts. Godforbid he puts in any work himself.
---
I bought copy on steam during 20$ sale, my main account on bethesda launcher. You get account when you buy a game ü§î
---
That does sound fun
---
That's exactly what I was thinking
---
Once upon a time. AFAIK the only events you trigger now are scorched earth, encrypted, fertile soil, and that one at Morgantown airport.
---
LoL
---
I got an Unyielding chest piece in 3 attempts. It is just 1* but can always try for a better one at a later date.
---
It seemed fixed yesterday when I joined that event and there was a tent at the spot but the enemies just spawned around it
---
Sending the raider hunters to harass foundation or something like that would be a fun way to earn it, the "toxic" one kind of conveys that message
---
I don‚Äôt know about that... what OP is saying is if you take total score required to get to 100 and divide by 2, you need that much score to get to level 64. It has nothing to do with how much score is available to earn or how many atoms you get (not should it). If you are past level 64, you are on track to complete without spending atoms.
---
In regards to caps, it‚Äôs only an issue on the ‚Äúcollections‚Äù tab. On the inventory tab it‚Äôs accurate. 
---
But yes, bug is a bug and it shouldn‚Äôt happen and while annoying, it isn‚Äôt game breaking.
---
According to other threads the location for the quest was changed a while ago when they changed Atlas
---
I don‚Äôt mind grind, I personally don‚Äôt like the idea of seasons. It cheapens the game for me. I don‚Äôt like it in other games and I don‚Äôt like it here. 
---
I‚Äôm old though so maybe that is why.
---
One of the major parts of an online gaming service that makes it great or not is the community. Many people in FO76 are great and help others. I always help those who need it and drop stimpacks, radaway, water and plans. I also give them ammo if I can see what weapon they‚Äôre using the most. I do not like overcharging at my camp so plans are usually affordable. I do price rarer plans higher but never crazy high. All common plans and some rare I either give away or put up for 0 caps to maybe 50 caps. I enjoy the game and would want others to enjoy it as well. Glad you‚Äôre experiencing our community at its best and are enjoying the game!
---
Well usually you can check how many caps you have many other ways, that tab is mostly for other stuff you don't use as much as caps like badges and bullion, so yeah. It's not game breaking ofc and I don't even notice it because I only remember about other stuff when I need to buy something using that currency :p I'd rather see many other bugs being fixed first.
---
thanks so much for the offer but somebody already did it for me! things are so much easier now
---
They are really misrepresenting the challenge lol. 
---
That camera is still in game (you need it for pioneer scouts). Build personal terminal at your camp and it will tell you where it is. 
---
Repairing the camera was never a daily challenge.
---
xD
---
Anything I don't need or already learnt goes asprices
---
all plans - 10 caps
---
all ammo 1 cap
---
all spare aids - 1 cap
---
1 star 30 cap
---
2 star 60 cap
---
3 star 100 cap
---
I find no need hogging everything my stash is always full and with in the 2 weeks playing I have all 3 star stuff i needed full ultracite and jetpacks crafted and i havent even touched the main quests yet.
---
Nukes can be launched at anywhere on the map except for a certain area of the Forest.
---
Score is fine, mostly, they just need to add more methods to get it, but what I would like to see is actual end-game content, the game has none. If score is coupled with said content -- we would be hearing much less whining. As for endgame content, well, anything really, at this point even more of the same (ie sbq) would do. I know wendigo is coming, but it won't cut it.
---
I wouldn't even dare to suggest some actual dungeon-like content that would finally put my OP build to the test, nope, never. :P
---
I just started the game, I'm trying to do the story, I keep running into enemies like 4x my level and I'm overencumbered because of the limited CAMP storage.
---
I play maybe an hour a day, sometimes a bit more. I can either do things that progress the story or do things that progress SCORE.
---
I also really don't like NW so I skip all of them unless I can literally drop in, do it then leave.
---
Was about to link this
---
I've seen people trying to sell one for 25k.
---
Someone found my cultist mansion in the Mire last night. I stalked them from outside and stood watching them at the window. I do hope they noticed.
---
I know someone that rolled each piece an average of 800 times each to get an upper tier set of Unyielding ss armor.
---
Yup... 4000 rolls.
---
I usually chill in nuke zones with my marine armor, RadX and sun kissed level 2, kinda fun. If Rad Spinge procs, I don't even need RadAway
---
Oh weird!
---
Yup, every time I go past a machine I trigger it and do something else while waiting. In this case I was looting the Nuka Cola machine to the left when I saw all 3 claws make proper contact with the plate.
---
* they still exist
---
* no
---
* yes, but actually no
---
* as far as i can tell, no
---
To get the exact, or at least somehow decet rolls, you'll need many more attempts, trust me.   
---
If you're running bloodied though, you'll die after every jetpack flight without those soft landing legs, so there's that.
---
I'll give it a try. Thanks you!
---
I know.
---
Thankfully Radiation Rumble is in an indoor location where the clean-up is more forgiving, otherwise you couldn't loot up to 150+ meat piles after the event.
---
It's always bugged me that you don't get caps from the beers, and cans from the canned foods.
---
I've noticed it doesnt let you know the materials you can farm at the workshop too
---
I doubt they'll provide any compensation, They've been auto closing any tickets on the issue.
---
It‚Äôs hard to get out of it once your in
---
You‚Äôre acting like DLC can‚Äôt expand upon them, just like how DLC made them possible in the first place.
---
That's the cushioned mod for the legs?
---
You can survive like 30 seconds. But if someone is sharing rad sponge 3 and someone is sharing ghoulish you can stay in there as long as you want.
---
Of course? Just eat the vial, like a normal person.
---
I‚Äôm level 347, and found a level 35 bloodied plasma rifle in a player vendor for 9,999 caps. Honestly, best thing to use when getting swarmed by ghouls. Even though it isn‚Äôt the max level for that weapon, with the flamer barrel it might as well be max level.
---
I love that joining a public group means that you can travel to team members camps for free.
---
Need to get across the other side of the map for cheap?
---
Find a camp in the general area and look for the team they're on. Join it, fast travel to their base (for free) then travel to wherever you want.
---
I nuked someone‚Äôs base for this today. Sold every round for 5 caps. Had about 13,000 rounds of various ammo types for sale.
---
Weird that you have so many of the same legendary
---
Well we'll see I guess.
---
This is exactly why I enjoyed walking around to discover new places for my camp. For the past 127 levels, I‚Äôve only had my spot taken once.
---
You're doing the right thing. What lvl are you and what build do you run?
---
Fallout 1st exists
---
Wastelanders had this problem in a few spots the other most notably being the Secret Service who have a yuge amount of conversation options but very little progression, hopefully Bethesda is growing these factions instead of making the game full of under realized single mission shallow groups.
---
It's a second meat week on the September 22nd, the first is happening August 18th.
---
dupers exist
---
realistically speaking a dozen people could fulfill the quota within the first few minutes
---
Fallout 1st dupers exist too.
---
They don't, that's the problem.
---
Sometimes when opening the social menu you can see them for a split second before they glitch out
---
Wait. A second meat week?  So why didn't they put that instead of making people assume?
---
Especially dupers who got away with it
---
Get bird bones mutation and the agility perks to level 2 that majorly reduce fall damage. Makes falling trivial.
---
Crossbow still good, I was able to shoot someone from really, really far away the other day.
---
OP there are dupers that could end those milestones on the first fucking day by themselves lol
---
Do you have the 'Bear Arms' perk that reduces the weight of big guns, Bandoilier that reduces the weight of your ammo, Batteries Included reduces energy weapon ammo weight, Thru-Hiker reduces the weight of food, and the one for medicines under strength can't think of the name of it right now. 
---
If you've got some of those or all of those perks, just put them on in some combination until you can get to the nearest train station to get rid of some of the junk you're lugging around, either by selling it or exchanging it for scrip, or tossing what you want to keep in your stash box.
---
Swap out those perks, cook up some rand stag for grilled randstag, cook up some molerat for mole rat chunks, eat those with some alcohol, they all combine for strength and carry weight, I think that you might be able to even use a buffout on top of all of that.
---
Took me 60 to get 4 pieces on uny and 1 of bolstering... still working on that 5th uny. Did get a 1 star but f that. Got REALLY lucky though and two of my first 4 are ap refresh #blessed
---
Got it twice. It hurts.
---
Like Modus would let a BoS fanboy gather millions of supplies in broad day light while all it would take to put an end to it is a single strike.
---
This guy is made of plotarium.
---
I don't see what that has to do with anything.
---
Equip Good with salt and it will take ages for food to spoil.
---
No, Acrobat legendary prefix, reduces falling damage by 50%.
---
Nice. You only need one more ap refresh piece and then probably 2 poison resist would be ideal
---
They did, there's a community calendar that says when the first happens and for the Fortifying Atlas rewards it has a "second helping" pun to explain it's another week of it.
---
I don't know if it's how it works but it seems that when I scrap modded weapons I have a higher chance of learning mods.
---
This is unfortunate, it goes totally against the social aspect of the game. Thanks for replying.
---
Because the name for that reward is ‚ÄúMeat Week, A **SECOND** Helping‚Äù 
---
Kinda sorta obvious.
---
Where do u even get cork that‚Äôs the one challenge we‚Äôre gonna have trouble with I bet concrete is gonna be 2nd most difficult
---
Yeah I made it to sunnytop. I'm maxed out on scrip now. Now to the rusty pick.
---
As someone would say, they just do.
---
Psychobuff gives you straight up rad immunity in the PTS right now. Hope that bug carries over.
---
The same as Power Armor Jetpack, just more dangerous since PA cancels falls damage
---
That's true, that event is really great to loot, no hurry and can leave everything until the end.
---
k
---
This is not really the time to worry about that. Get to at least 45 before gear hunting becomes a real focus
---
Yeah and I have to keep rolling to get good 3rd rolls too
---
At the very least though, the other factions all have some reason to return to. Buying gold from smiley, or buying bullion plans from the other 3.
---
Free radicals have nothing going for them as it stands right now.
---
I'm partially glad it's a handmade skin just because I wont have to hunt for a different weapon. I've got a decent handmade collection as it is but if combat rifle skins could be added to the fixer I'd happily see the screaming eagle changed to a CR skin
---
Why do you think they unbanned all the dupers?üòÇ
---
I went with 4 wwr and one fdcwr one my set. I dont pvp so...
---
If you leave the other player gets more exp, also, I kill almost every scorched before they get in range the rocket just tells me when the scorch beast is in range.
---
I only pvp to troll at workshops lol... usually kill the same guy over and over and then drop them a ton of legendary scrip as a way of saying it was all just fun and games
---
Turn it off
---
Once it‚Äôs repaired, interact with the red box. Doesn‚Äôt effect the event, stops the cunty noise it makes
---
That's awesome news to me. My over 1 year old camp is stored and it's currently just 4 benches and a bed for over a week now. I can't wait to rebuild it,and have that cool orange camp skin.
---
Bellend.
---
Again, if this info‚Äôs easier to get from other players, I‚Äôm going to ask them before taking the time to grind for it. Thank you for the answer, no thank you for going out of your way to insult me before giving it to me
---
You can also use chinese stealth suit for nuke zones and get the legendary &lt;1 rads rate
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
What is betting the account bank or whatever terminology they use becomes a Fallout 1st only item?
---
I think player camps only show on the map if they have a vendor powered up
---
I gave a lvl 3 a furious explosive revolver cant remember of it was 5 or 10 but it was worth more to him than 15 scrip is to me
---
Yep, some people
---
That's barely a nerf, just means people will need to use a atimpack on queen or colossus fights.
---
Because Steam brought many new players.  Many of which quickly tired of the game and moved on.  The Bethesda Launcher players are mostly people who have weathered two years of the storm and aren't going anywhere.  
---
You are right about one thing, this conversation is over.
---
Unless there's a daily cap of how much you can turn in..
---
Not a good idea because they wouldn't fix it anyway:(
---
Yes but you need 2
---
The Radicals are a small, low level faction based in the wrong place for easy drop in missions as things stand with the focus on BoS. Maybe it will change in the future once the 'One Wasteland' update eventually comes live as DLC content will nolonger be constrained by the hi/lo level nature of the map. There's still a huge amount of underutilised space and property that can be used for missions and quest, and not an insignificant number of named NPCs and factions that are currently idle or underused - the Radicals are just one group, Enclave does little, Secret Service have nothing, US Army survivors are pushed far in to the corner of the map, even the main protagonists, the Raiders and Settlers (and Davenport) are basically just one or two infinitely repeating dailies during endgame.
---
Bird bones baybay!!
---
For next week's brotherhood task. I like to be prepared
---
Faster sneak on the legs is useless if you run speed demon, as that caps out sneak movement speed anyway.
---
You think that was an insult? It seems like you have no sense of humor in addition to your presumptive, demanding nature. You're quite welcome, in any case.
---
Someone shared mysterious stranger with you.
---
So you can actually see their name in your friends list with a dot next to it, you can accept there
---
What way do you mean?
---
I have enjoyed the legendary board game thing. I like the team up feature and I have really liked some of the rewards. The only bummer has been shit like the CAMP module being messed up and the handmade gun skin looks god awful if you use a silencer...which everyone uses.
---
IIRC the addiction is always there regardless if u take a Chem .
---
From what I've personally seen via people showing me video of them doing it you don't have to do anything special. You literally just hold E on it like any other blueprint. Thus it's not an exploit. I don't know how you aren't grasping that.
---
I've said it a million times, bethesda says its hard to fix so my opinion is we need mounts like eso. Keep fast travel in but they need to make it to where you have a decent option if you can't or don't want to fast travel. They could give out brahmin in game behind a really grindy quest and sell other mounts in the store.  Its the least we deserve since this bug has been in since launch.
---
That's pretty awesome, the colors just popped so much in some of those shots I thought there had to be a filter on it. Kudos, you defied all I thought I knew. Lol
---
I‚Äôd say that going out of your way to attack me again in response says more than I ever could about what kind of person you are. Have a nice day. :)
---
Same I was quarantine for 11 days so I'm finished already. And I hear alot of people saying they wont do it again but it's harder said than done, theese things are designed to rope you in
---
Ive never done it alone, theres always been atleast one person whos willing to jump in once they see im all by my lonesome... Tea Time however nobody gives a sh√∑t if im alone.. :s
---
No. If you are under the chem effect and you are addicted to it, you are still an addicted person. It wont lowers your damage output.
---
Been at 17 for the past 5 days and been playing kinda regularly
---
I only had it once and that's when I didn't log out until 30mins before the reset. All other times I was always logged out at least an hour before and an hour after.
---
Not saying its a sure fire solution, I may have just been lucky but worth considering if you play right up to the reset and get the issues.
---
Not worth arguing about. Clearly exploit means different things to different people.
---
In a corner of uranium fever there's a cart with some of them. I don't really remember if they're the handy fuel or the bbq one tho.
---
Ridin' Shotgun, if it's not on cooldown.
---
WELCOME! Got a copy and paste reply. 
---
Put a few points into luck as early as possible and use pharma farma. You will have more drugs than you need eventually. (Most builds require at least 5 luck anyways so it'll come in handy after 50)
---
Melee as much as possible to save ammo in the early game.
---
Join a public team. Building gives a boost to INT and higher INT gives more xp. You can then fast travel for free to your teammates and their camps. 
---
Junk is used to make everything. When you build a camp try put it near a junk pile and build an extractor on it. And once you have 500 atoms your first purchase should be a collectron. it collects scrap and junk from around your camp.
---
Capture workshops. They give XP, loot and caps (and usually a free fast travel point but that's buggered). You can then either defend or let it to be captured and then take it back. Taking back is quicker and easier as it's only one wave of enemies. Defending can be up to 4. When you build in a workshop if the junk needed to build something is green then it comes from the workshops own stash so build away. Workshops are pvp zones though. Someone can come and beat you up and steal your lunch money.
---
Everytime you see a workbench get in the habit of scrapping all junk to lighten your load. And then when you see a stashbox (found in camps, train stations, red rockets)
---
Scrap weapons and armor you're not using as you get components and a chance of a mod. 
---
And this link tells you where to find ALL of the things. It is pre wastelanders so some stuff may be wrong now.
---

---
Sleep in a bed and play an instrument until you get a bonus. Takes like 30 seconds. 
---
Plant some crops in your camp. Corn or Razorgrain. And then make soup.
---
You can share card perks depending on your charisma level 
---
3 charisma - level 1 perk cards
---
6 charisma - Level 2 perk cards
---
9 charisma - Level 3 perk cards
---
12 charisma - Level 4 perk cards
---
15 charisma - Level 5 perk cards 
---
So if youre in a team then everebody can share 1 card (if you have at least 3 charisma)
---
Again, you think you were attacked when someone simply makes observations about your behaviour.
---
You came here demanding answers like a petulant child. You have your answer, but now you want my respect as well? Remarkable.
---
Have a great day!
---
Get the jetpack last. The rad resistance and other resistances from a full set of SS, any full set, is the best aspect of the armor.
---
Immature, easy to upset, and desperate for attention. And I‚Äôm the child? Lmao.
---
I started doing it a bit late, made up some time on the double XP weekend, but it‚Äôs getting harder to progress. I want that damn power armor! Going to give it my best shot until the end and hopefully not have to resort to using a ton of atoms if I don‚Äôt complete it in time. This whole thing really triggers my obsessive compulsive traits lol
---
More mods should be coming in patch 21. Wait.
---
Watched a player grab a few ingredients right at the start then go up to the roof and go AFK until the event failed. Lots of us there trying to find it so ended up with lots of confused emotes but I knew what he / she did, likely on purpose.
---
Only time I've ever seen it fail
---
The Mountain Sclut outfit looks cool, slap on a military cap and gas mask with goggles and you've got a pretty cool outfit.
---
Why ultralight?
---
I had that happen to me once, the dot was by a name in the recenti list, never had it happen again since though.
---
Op wants some sort of reward for being high hp.  My suggestion is only the few things I could think of would make sense.  Disease resist and power and attack damage seem like reasonable rewards for being high hp as they would resemble having a healthy immune system and being in tiptop shape to swing a sledge or whatever really hard (someone on deaths door doesn't seem like the best candidate for every feat of strength).  I suggest power attacks specifically because I don't believe more damage is needed on anything other than a power armor melee character, and power attacks are infrequent for most players and not often an option if a player is choosing to utilize dodgy.
---
As far as high hp tankiness is concerned, I do believe more options would be neat, although not very necessary if the rumored poison resist perks are going to be a thing later.  %damage mitigationion on power armor and perks like fireproof/blocker/ricochet/suppressor/lone wanderer make people already so tanky that soloing Encryptid is pretty easy, so I don't think any more raw damage mitigation is warranted.  That said, I think it would be reasonable to tune AP costs depending upon how, universally or just in respect to the dodgy perk.  Dodgy is really strong but simply costs to much for power armor users to use nearly as effectively as unyeilding users.  Making it (or everything) cost less at high hp or in PA or making ap costs higher at low hp seems reasonable to me.  That way there would be an actual benefit to keeping your character healthy.
---
I think he's talking about dupers with unlimited scrap space so they can fill the milestones easy. Could be wrong
---
I love this, 10/10
---
" First things first. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just the XB or my internet connection or both, but dealing with mobs, scorchbeast screams and the environmental effects of a nuke zone will generate serious lag. To the point where it‚Äôs almost impossible to switch targets or guns. "
---
Bruh swapping weapons at the Queen is an absolute nightmare on xbox right now because of all the lag and frame drops.  It is so delayed and ends up switching the guns back and forth sometimes unequipping them entirely.. Have an xbox one X with 76 on an SSD.  No network issues, just really shitty frames and CTDs.
---
Ignore the question mark over Dupers and you find that it's not so difficult if every gets involved.
---
Someone somewhere crunched numbers for a decent daily player participation and it literally came down to a couple of hundred pieces of scrap each. Steel in particular should be very easy as you can get a dozen off some common weapons even without scrapper. In particular anyone not making ammo should have plenty to spare. Cork is more rare but there are still places it's relatively abundant. And of course if Beth also include a personal reward not simply one for the singular community then there's nothing to prevent folk hitting the vendors, in fact it might incentivise some.
---
This. I use dense for SBQ
---
i feel this one
---
It's applied just like any other skin, through the atom shop, and you select it. Of course you have to claim it first.
---
The low health isn't the issue. It's the fact that the best perks, legendary effects, and mutation in the game are exclusive to being at low health, too. Bloodied gives you the highest damage buff because, in theory, having low health is risky. But then you factor in unyielding, and nerd rage, and adrenal reaction, and serendipity, and you're a demigod. Tankier than a full health vanguard build, sneakier than a dedicated full health stealth build, better damage multipliers than anything you could ever get at higher health. It's outright ridiculous

Ahhh....yea, still a Noob at lvl 45. Thanks for taking the time.
---
I mean, it does raise the difficulty level on the game in general.  That could be considered a reward for the high level players that can do everything while asleep.
---
Cool. Thanks for helping out a Noob.
---
I mean, with adrenal reaction and nerd rage, you'd still be dealing more damage with a vampire's weapon than a full health build would with anything else
---
That won't work with me, I already have everything blue printed but the fact that I still have to place it down and place it perfectly right, and that half the time the blueprints won't work or store properly, makes it take so long, I'm clinically OCD. I've done it enough I've cut it down from four hours to two.
---
What's funny is if you go over there people will say that they read and respond way more over here than on the official forum.  Seems like they are right sometimes as someone who frequently posts on both message boards.
---
I don‚Äôt seem to lag much when I do events solo. But when there‚Äôs 10 or so players in scorched earth it becomes a terrible lag fest. The same thing happens to me, I‚Äôll click B to exit VATs and end up opening my pip boy and almost dropping weapons and shit. And then if I stop shooting the queen to reload I‚Äôll still be getting constant damage numbers like I‚Äôm still shooting lol. It‚Äôs an annoying mess. I wish I had a few friends that played this game so we could just strictly play in private servers. I can kill the sheepsquatch imposter in like one magazine if I‚Äôm the only one there shooting at it. But as soon as a bunch of players are in the area killing robots and stuff, I‚Äôm lagging all over the place and can hardly get a shot on her.

Back when I was still regularly playing my first character, I decided to ignore the main quest and just go exploring, so I just followed the railroad lines, long story short I wound up on the railroad tracks behind RG Processing, I was maybe level 20, so there I was happily walking the tracks when I suddenly see a feral ghoul, I stop, take careful aim and get slammed from the side by another feral, and then another, I bolt, turning around every now and then to fire off a random VATS shot, I would sprint ahead of them, run out of AP slow to a walk get hit by ghouls...I was mainlining Stimpacks, then I see a shadow of the RG Station on my compass, I make for it, hoping that the ghouls will give up, I manage to get close to the station, still firing an occasional shot at the ghouls. I run toward the station, 3 or 4 ferals in tow (I want to say that they were level 68 ghouls but I can't say for certain), I get close and then the next thing I know is that three higher level players are there, they see what's going on and just jump into the frey and save my ass. I didn't know these guys, couldn't communicate with them outside of emotes. I had zero expectation that they would have helped me, but they did I thanked them, they waved at me and we went our separate ways. 
---
The player base of this game is amazing. As a group they can be almost annoyingly helpful to newly emerged former Vault Dwellers.
---
You're a sorry excuse for a human being.  Xoxo
---
You're lucky, cause it stays broke. I moved it 54 times to get the 76 camp placement achievement challenge. it changes just fine but it breaks the camp and doesn't allow you to fast travel to it, show it on the map, show your vendors, exactly as my post says.
---
And the game will live on forever. As with every other fallout game
---
It boggles my mind that some people still deny this. Bloodied builds are playing the game on easy mode. Not that there is anything wrong with it while it's in the game, but don't deny that your demigod stat buffs make the already fairly easy game a joke. I really do hope they finally fix it and add some real variety to the game, instead of "use bloodied and unyielding or you are intentionally gimping yourself"
---
‚ù§ piece and love man I got no beef w/ you have a good one.
---
do not do that unless you wanna risk losing your gear. avoid switching weapons and armor, and also try not having them break mid fight.
---
also avoid using repair kits during the fight if they do break.
---
Feeling better, now that you admitted that you can't cut it like an honest player?
---
Bethesda's in the middle of a ban wave and they've already said they are banning people for this exploit, mostly only on wendigo Colossus and scorch beasts Queen Farmers.
---
Online games work differently but alright ‚ù§
---
Are you sure it was a hockey mask tho?
---
Holy shit well that was quite the 180.  In all seriousness, if you think the game is that bad and you hate it that much why don't you go play a game you actually enjoy instead of hate-playing this game and cheating and breaking the rules?
---
Come back to this post in 3 years and prove me wrong
---
I'm kind of split on that. Fast travel is already barely a cap sink anymore with free travel to server events and public groups letting you get free access to people's camps even easier than before. But on the other hand, it really is more the thought that counts; you grind the same boring daily dozens of times and get access to the best gear they have, the least they could do is welcome you to their base and cover expenses
---
Try the basement of the technical data quest.
---
imagine being this pathetic- its a computer game, cheater.
---
Lot of footlockers?
---
YAWN...
---
Just how many time will I read similar post? Don't like it, can't hack it, don't play it.
---
There's more than a few dishonest scumbags out here in the wasteland ;) why survive when you can thrive ‚ù§
---
Nah, you wont kill this game, you are way to tiny for this job. You are not a special snowflake.
---
But this game has server this time and if the game isnt profitable anymore they would have to either shutdown the servers so they wouldnt lose money or do something that would encourage more players to play it more, but atm i think they have enough players to pay the server costs and make profit with this game
---
I mean, you are 100% correct that bethesda's punishment of cheaters is pathetic and utter dogshit, and honestly you should make fun of them until they improve it. But don't act like that grind is anything other than your fault, you earned that ban and for some reason you're still coming back? And then for some reason pretending you don't like the game when you spent so much time grinding it **and are willing to do it again**. The mental gymnastics you guys perform to avoid accepting consequences for your actions is astounding
---
3 years, forever, pretty interchangeable terms but alright. Fallout 4 still has more concurrent players than 76 if that speaks for 76's longevity at all.
---
Me either ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Stop making posts to try and sell your legendaries
---
I had some up and someone bought them and it didn‚Äôt count towards my three. I still sold another thing and bought two others before it triggered.
---
I like the concept of a berserker build a lot more than actually doing it.  Breaking your armor is too much of a pita and I need to wear armor with weapon weight reduction or I can't move...  Which means I cant use the sentinel/cavalier/blocker armor legendary effects.  So I'm stuck with stealth commando berserker, which is just crap.  I mean it works but a tse works just as well from a full hp food build with 400 dr.
---
It's kinda like a car wreck at this point, you know you shouldn't look but you can help it and are only left feeling guilty and gross afterwards ‚ù§
---
Well, for me, I usually gain a level every 3-5 days with about 2 hours on a day. The "Gain a level" daily is one I've failed several times and even when I manage it, it's *backbreaking* levels of labor. 
---
.
---
Add to that the assorted Nuclear Winter challenges. Kill 3 animals? I see *maybe* one in three dips into Nuclear Winter, but I'm dead long before I can do anything about it. Kill another player? Maybe, MAYBE one in three or four hours of play ‚Ä¶ I can't aim, so I need VATS to do anything and, well, VATS doesn't work on players. And I don't have that kind of TIME.
---
The normal challenges are generally fine. Buy stuff  from players? YES PLEASE! Knock out ten Scorched? I can do that! Take a photo? Yeah buddy!
---
But levelling up? Finding some obscure critter that takes server hopping? Nuclear Winter? It's astoundingly hard, takes HUGE time investments, and just leaves me an emotional wreck, either from doing it, or having to accept that I *can't* do it and know that, because  of that, I won't get to finish the game. :(
---
From what I've heard if you play heavy and you use the perk that staggers enemies it can cause her to stagger midair and keep her from landing. I play heavy but do not use this perk, I generally attack her in bursts to keep agro so she tends to stay around the area the group is in.
---
As far as the lag on xb1 and incorrect button inputs. I haven't personally experiance incorrect button inputs but it seems like the lag has worsened personally in the last couple weeks. I honestly thought it was mainly due to the amount of heavy and explosive weapons I was seeing in the queen fights but there might be more to it than that if you are experiancing it in a solo queen fight.
---
I agree ammo goes fast in this fight, it is actually one reason I settled for 2 guns that use 5mm, ultracite is too expensive for me to focus on so I personally don't use it, but if you aren't already using them I would definitely invest in max levels of ammo Smith and superduper because you can get a lot more bang for your materials. I think ammosmith(agility) gives 80% more ammo at max level and when super duper(luck) activates it will double that total.
---
I will say good luck with the quarantine, been there done that, not looking for a second round.
---
If you would like someone to talk theory and builds hit me up in PM we can talk or share GTs, I also play xbox and focus on bloodied.
---
He‚Äôs trying to sell them
---
No there should be one or two fuel directly in sight,if nobody got them already.
---
I don't know what you need them for,but they're a very inefficient farm since there are only a few on the map.
---
I simply can not understand this mentality. Why people do something that they hate to the core? This is just a game that players play in their freetime... so they should do something that they enjoy.
---
Clean fuel not normal clean
---
Never said I could kill it, or wanted to. Pretty sure bethesda higher ups are doing it for themselves ‚ù§
---
I just got the game yesterday and as soon as I'm out of the vault there were two guys, one in what looked like a spacesuit the other in a mask and they kept trying to hit me while talking to the two NPCs by the stairway just outside 76...it was night time in the game and at one point while listening spacesuit dude just stood right in front of the NPC.  
---
Then they both used a 'beckon/over here' gesture to try and get me to follow them...it was actually kinda creepy and I refused to follow lol.
---
Just made the analogy in another post but let's just say the game to me at least, is kinda like a bad car wreck.
---
So you compare a single player game to an mmo.
---
Hmmm... few days ago, someone did the same, also, he tried defend his cheating there also.
---
But they are entitled so it‚Äôs the most important thing right now.
---
I get it but I'm not sure anyone under 40 will üòÇ
---
I really thank the Gods that it's still basically a single player game with teaming up only as an option, and that there are 2 kinds of teams.
---
And Goat Legs
---
I kinda feel sorry for you. I don't care you still got all your duplicate items. Or that you gonna do it again, even bigger. It doesn't affect me. Its just kinda sad you're coming here bragging about it.
---
I had issues with playing on an external so I moved almost everything to my external except Fo76 and a couple more intensive games. Loads were horrendous, might not be as bad on a SSD, but you are still loading through a paripherial. I'd be curious to find out if it helps at all.
---
So you are masohist then. You like the pain.
---
It's just poor wording. It scales off your addictions, not the withdrawals you are currently suffering from
---
I'm rank 2. This sucks for casual players :(
---
I've accepted it man, they way I see it is I traded my main and secondary character for a badass arsenal of legacies and god rolls ‚ù§ but god damn I hate doing pioneer scout quest for the backpack
---
Not just could, will. It's not like we even get a choice in the matter. Anything normal players donate is just to get whatever rewards they hand out into the pool. And questionable sources say that pool is going to include more worthless mounted head plans
---
Guess you didn't read the fully fleshed put version in the other comment. Not so much a love for pain, rather a morbid curiosity.
---
I hope not but yeah you never know
---
Exactly! At like level 20 I found a guy that was selling good plans for 10 caps a piece, so I pay it forward keeping everything at 10. Gotta support local business!
---
I think the first ones a load of bollocks.  All that steel for.. wait for it..  a beret.
---
Really.  As if I haven't seen enough of berets from fasnacht.
---
People like you are the reason that the only time I take workshops on public servers is for challenges. And I always make sure that I'm constantly squatting so that I don't show on the map, sit right by the edge of the area while waiting for the claim, and bail once it completes.
---
Hey man if anything I'm campaigning for bethesda to tighten and refine their punishment strategies
---
You're right.  Dupers who gave themselves seemingly millions of scrap.
---
"Do they really think they have a large enough playerbase?
---
To achieve the fucking milestones of resources requested for BoS?"
---
complains that there's not enough players to hit milestone and then complains that people can and will hit the milestone easily. 
---
I've had Fo1st for 6 weeks and have 100k steel. People who have had it longer (not dupers) probably have millions of junk stashed away.
---
Bethesda will auto fill it anyway if we don't meet the quota.
---
Yeah, still a masochist.
---
Quite the opposite! You really want to live the Junkie lifestyle and continue to pop those chems and/or alcohol because not only does that not remove any bonuses, it removes the addiction (which is always a negative effect) temporarily until that chem wears off again. I have my five addictions on my favorite wheel and frequently add them. As a melee build I consume every bottle of alcohol that‚Äôs lying around to drink as well (Party Boy perk further enables this behavior). Junkie liiiiiife!
---
Thought that meant like it's their second annual meat week. Not like two events in a single year.
---
Smart! That is a good way to avoid getting raided. Especially right now with the visual bug where Workshops show up as normal places of interest on the map, a lot of the time I don‚Äôt know if a workshop is taken or not unless the Defend event is there or if I outright see a player on it.
---
But where's the pain for me to enjoy? Dang I guess I'm doing it wrong cos I kinda just feel chill
---
that's hilarious, sad, and true all at once
---
‚ù§
---
I fart in your general direction
---
I went raider instead of settler because I'm convinced ward sells the items to raiders and then sends me to kill them and get the goods back. And there's something very wrong about his eyes.
---
So, then, you do not hate this game and you are enjoying what is Bethesda doing.
---
Then why you cry a river about your well deserved ban?
---
'Waa waa, I'm an emotional coward reddit! Waa waaa!' is all I hear.
---
Nerd rage doesn‚Äôt work at full health

don't just think of it as another hat in a different color

NPCs have died for that patch, son
---
Dealt blossoms rewards the only good ingredient from the event to the whole server... except the players that participate in it.
---
Yeah dude cos the mini thread started when a guy said fo76 will live in the same eternal glory as all previous fallout games exclusively. So thanks cos you kinda just helped me out in this one ‚ù§
---
I totally do
---
It's really weird to me. In a way, you guys are almost the true hardcore fans. How many accounts did you buy? How many total months of 1st did you pay for? How much did you spend on atoms between all those accounts? Many legitimate players wouldn't want to do any of that grind again after doing it on their main, and you do it on multiple accounts each. And yet you want us to think you don't like the game. That kind of dedication is impressive but contradicts the whole permanently fucking up the game and economy thing
---
I am actually very curious about the Enclave‚Äôs reaction to the Brotherhood‚Äôs arrival.
---
In honesty, MODUS probably isn‚Äôt going to acknowledge them in the slightest, but still.
---
Bugger..if it were Xbox I'd of helped right away. Hope you get it done. Took me forever, like over a year to actually be shown what to do. Good luck.
---
I...didn't say it does?
---
Now go away or I shall taunt you for a second time
---
While searching to see if charisma self res perks work, found that the life saving apparently doesn't consume a stimpack when it resses you, but you must have at least one regular stimpack in your bags.

Only the veterans will remember the days when it took them less than 6 weeks to put out updates

was the same for me last night too, wonder what was up

lol it‚Äôs in the game I‚Äôve fought it in the sundew grove
---
Dias is kind of maniacal. She's a trip. I love Gina, and I haven't done Greg yet. As for a plan that doesn't involve all this, try siding with the raiders.
---
I‚Äôm under 30. Btw where did you get those coconuts?
---
What's interesting is i have never spent money on atoms. Have never got fallout 1st (including the free first month). Never paid for an account (don't even know what that means) and before my characters got deleted I had my main that I played since release and a second account I made a few months ago to try a bloody build. And now I have my new character so I guess that makes 3. Every assumption you made was wrong
---
This is bethesda, ui was made to make you suffer, not to be convenient and pleasant
---
I do them up and look for a matching level player to donate too. Had a nice level 35 two shot ffr handmade, found a lower charector and donated with 2000 556.  He can either keep or sell as long as it helps
---
‚ù§ weird place to make such a declaration but I hope you find the help you need
---
Yeah I've had it for a month or two and I've got loads of spare junk. I do see us maybe getting few of the milestones. But like you said, Bethesda will just auto fill it anyways.
---
Maybe only Nuka caps have value? Frankly, the whole idea of bottlecaps being currency is a stretch.

Damn, I have only started playing a few weeks ago and had a coloured bat, level 35 I think. I just dropped it because I had no space
---
From what I've seen Super Duper doesn't stack with Ammo Smith, it just doubles the base recipe amount. You'll still want both, but a Super Duper proc on 5mm will make 280 rounds (100 + 80% + another 100), not 360 (180 x 2)  
---
One Gun Army is only an issue if you stagger the queen out of the wind up for her pre-landing swoop/dive, which is avoidable if you stop shooting for a sec when you see that specific animation. But yeah, you can always just not use the perk to be safe
---
Never complained about being banned, just think Beth could have managed it a bit better. I like fallout but am disenfranchised with how bethesda is managing the game is all.
---
While that all sounds nice it doesnt work like that in reality.
---
It would take a literal army of developers to pump out story content at the rate that we as players want to consume it at.  I was finished with the wastelanders main quest on all 5 characters in less than a week.  Content which took them months, hell maybe even years to create.   The hardcore players are never going to have enough content to satisfy them.
---
It takes some guy in the art department 5 minutes to reskin stuff for the atom shop and it probably takes months to do even a couple quests.  At least all the expansions are free.
---
Bird boners? Oh yeah, thank brain, that‚Äôs not what was said.
---
I still get loads.
---
I already got the fancies, and scripped them, so now I just sell the tickets. They always get bought fast, as do magazines.
---
Greg did the job.
---
But he wanted to stsy behind and find his boss‚Äôs brain and torture it or something like that.
---
And selling wodka is 1 cap and and empty one 2 caps. Must be bad wodka
---
We shouldn't settle for less, many other services offer more for less.
---
Yea I had some fun with the new game pass guy when it first started. I would hide behind a tree at overseers camp in the full jason get up with a machete and pop out right when they get there.
---
It doesn't need to be story content. It could simply be a minor free update to building cosmetics once per month. It could be a free package update to include 4 or 5 armour sets alongside a bunch of camp stuff or power armour paints in a bundle.
---
My post is specifically talking about cosmetics and camp items, not story stuff, as they don't sell story stuff in the atom store.
---
Cmon. You can‚Äôt use heavy weapons and pa without stabilized.
---
But my money????!!!!!! Bethesda ¬©
---
I think "Lead the way" makes more sense.  It would be handy.
---
Idk i pay a few premium subs for MORPG games and this one is by far the cheapest while also offering its own bleepin server.  I feel like the value i am getting for my money is good.
---
My main desire is not more content.  It is more polish on the content which we already have.  While i would like to see some end game progeession content for groups it is not what i want to see the most.
---
I started out as a Pioneer Scout.
---
Bowie knife, single action, crossbow, hunting rifle, and pump action were the only weapons I used. I'd use a standard until I found a legendary and then I'd use that until I found a better one.
---
Still got my exterminators 40% faster bowie knife with the PS paint for Campfire Tales.
---
I just hope you're not using that JE GP.
---
So you want the stuff thats in the atom shop in game for free?
---
Hah, I appreciate the suggestion, but I am playing this character as close to a hero as I can. :P
---
Feel free to message me on here anytime you have a question

The Jetpack is excellent and a lot of fun....but ... I am leveling a different character at the moment and went with the Dense mod instead .. I don‚Äôt really miss the jet pack and when I go back to my main I find I don‚Äôt use it as much!
---
I would get the dense mod (frees up 3 slots as you don‚Äôt need fireproof) then the limb mods and the jet pack last,  then get a 2nd chest piece so you can swap between them
---
Seems reasonable. I'd fite you. I think most people who aren't new are aware that workshops are PVP areas. Whether you like it or not you're kinda signing a PVP agreement by claiming or contesting them. 
---
I've PVP'd a few times at workshops even though I have no interest in actual PVP for the most part, just for something to do. The way you outline it would be fun. Being able to disengage when you want is the issue most people have I assume or they fear further reprisals, and tthat's not guaranteed at all most of the time. 
---
Being a raider or roleplaying and having the odd PVP fight does not equate to being a dick, and that's what most people can't grasp. Being a dick is being a dick.
---
I agree about that Bethesda should permaban cheaters, dupers, delete all and every single duped items from all and every inventory. Myself will most likely lose one or two weapons that I traded, but I could live with that.
---
And they should add some anticheat mechanic to the game, but not for prevention, just for the autobans itself. You try to do something bad? Bham, you are perma banned, it was your choice.
---
Which one? Only the pink, indigo, and yellow are rare. Unless that was changed with the wastelanders naming update, they also weren't named anything special (i.e a red bat is called red baseball bat, indigo bat is just called baseball bat)
---
Thank you. :)
---
Bethesda already said the cannot grant score to anyone who lost it from the auto-completion bug. 
---
Instead they gave extra daily challenges to make up for it, which didn't really fix the issue since those challenges also auto-completed. 
---
Level 17 is very low in terms of how far along you should be. I think its currently around level 60 or higher. So you definitely cannot catch up before the season ends unless you purchase ranks with atoms or really grind the hell out of the repeatable challenge.
---
Yeah. I actually just, finally, managed to track down a video someone made of all three brains - I only made the OP because initially I couldn't find one. Greg snaps. Dias is likely to become a supervillain. It seems like Gina, despite her issues, is the most mellow and least dangerous. I might just go with Dias however because a heroine never has enough villains she accidentally created.
---
Yeah it is, I guess I've just come to accept it after playing Fallout games for so many years.
---
It was a pink bat. Wish I kept it now
---
If you weren't around a year ago they did the same thing.  Meat week returned for a second week after they made an event where we had to kill a certain number of Scorched and scorchbeasts in a certain amount of time.
---
Ever wonder why they took the vault endgame raid out? Ultimately it was broken and boring. They didn't build any multiplayer mechanics into the game aside from sharing perk cards through charisma and shooting the same bullet sponge. They added no interesting mechanics to the game that let have proper end game mechanics that are beyond just running and gunning.  
---
Most games have a proper endgame, fallout 76 has a endgame, but i wouldn't call it proper or fun. All the fights end up being the same bullet sponge while adds attack. No cooperation outside of damage output. They need some major overhauls to their progression system for perk cards among other things.
---
I don't know.
---
I wanted a full set of legendary forest scout armor, and (other than the mask) I got it. It was a little easier because I didn't care what the rolls are, and I got a few good ones (mostly on the second and third stars)
---
Now I just keep an eye out for better ones.
---
Unless you're getting into a lot of PvP, you really only need to be so good on gear to practically steamroll everything, with few exceptions, so find something you're happy with generally, and just keep a lookout for upgrades. That way, you won't feel like you're desperately searching to complete your set.
---
Personally when I run out of main content I play with new character builds and build new and interesting camps. Some people use existing structures and build around them, my main goal is to build structures that look like they were meant to be where I place them.
---
Will do. My gt is kingsites12
---
I would like them to consider not locking almost everything cosmetic wise behind a paywall after people have already paid the paywall, often times multiple times.
---
To compare: 
---
Fallout 4: Currently with dlc around ¬£40, at release between ¬£40 to ¬£60. Almost every cosmetic in the game is obtainable. There are multiple skins for the power armour (far more than we have in 76). There is triple the story content, quest content, and radiant content.
---
Skyrim: All of the above. Again triple the content if not more so alongside DLC.
---
ESO: Far more content than 76. Is an online game so has costs to cover via the micro-transaction store but still has an incredible amount of in game cosmetics via style. Also has an incredible amount of PvE and PvP content included in just the base game. Equates to around ¬£40 for the base game.
---
Fallout 76 is, as demonstrated by Bethesdas own games, not value for money and is missing a lot. Especially considering they ported the assets directly from fallout 4 (mostly). There are direct ports from fallout 4 that they want you to spend real money on (pipers outfit for example). In total the atom store + the base game would take you to slmost over 1 thousand dollars if you were to buy each item and bundle.
---
I build a cosy camp at quarry x3 and it is probably the best one I‚Äôve done yet

Great work!

---
Agreed. Is‚Äôs spit on.
---
It's  actually Animal Crossing with guns, the real end game is getting pretty/cool things for your C.A.M.P. While being creative with it's budget while also getting cool looking clothes for you and your ally
---
Lmao
---
 I like how your mind works.
---
Moar goldfish!
---
Well I have to agree and disagree with you there.  I agree that there are no multiplayer mechanics such as group roles or other things which does not help them when trying to create end-game content.
---
I have to disagree on vault 94 however.  In my opinion it was closed because people complained it was too difficult and a lot of the solo food builds couldn't cut it in there so it was not popular.
---
We ran that vault 3 times+ a day every day for months on a private server and I can count on one hand how many issues I personally had in there.  It was not broken.  Week 2 was not so great of a mission but weeks 1 and 3 were amazing content.
---
I had the same problem yesterday. I wanted to go to point pleasant and ended up in camp McClintock... Weird af
---
I bought the ripper plan from Graham.
---
I can't craft it, because I don't have makeshift warrior 5, but that's where I got it.
---
I feel this whole game could have been much more detailed but the bean counters put the breaks on the initial development and forced the early release.
---
How is having to interact with healing mechanics that you could basically ignore beforehand barely a nerf. With low health builds every little number in regards to your HP counts.
---
The missile launcher not the sonic thingy.

Not particularly raider-y if you're not doing it for resources.   
---
Even if you call it RP, it's not raiding if you're not raiding them.
---
I think most the outer area of the map suffers from this. I've done a fair bit of exploring looking for unmarked locations etc and it usually ends up pretty disappointing as it tends to be nothing but landscape. A few more random spawns and critters wouldn't go a miss.
---
It's definitely fun. I utilize all 5 character slots so I don't have to delete my best. I loled finding fairly flat spots that are roadside, I use concrete foundations to make it look like there is a sidewalk, then I build a building or 2 against the sidewalk.
---
Those areas are kinda hard to find but they look really nice if the spot is flat enough, and the road is straight enough.
---
My buddy wanted to build a camp using an existing structure so we ended up building a lab under a bridge, and a small town on one side of the top of the bridge. Considering basically everything used was from the vanilla game content it looked pretty nice, like settlers decided to make their own little business district on top of the bridge.
---
If all the exploits in this game were suddenly fixed then the player base would drop drastically. The only thing keeping a lot of players around is how easily exploitable this game is. Sad but true. Bethesda knows it too.
---
Are the BoS and Enclave formally at war at this point in time?  As the Enclave Brotherhood war doesn't start until 2277. Way after the time that 76 takes place.
---
Wouldn't MODUS (and in extenstion the Enclave) just view the Brotherhood as just another group of Wastelanders that don't matter to Enclave?
---
I think areas were left empty so to added stuff later
---
You are just a busy bee friend.
---
First assaultrons in sheepshead clothing now vertigoldfish. Lol
---
Well jeez that‚Äôs a bit harsh - I can understand banning for duping, but I guess it‚Äôs against the TOS agreement just the same.
---

---
Vendors sell Bulk Cork and Concrete.
---
Concrete can also easily be found around the world in bags. Though they weigh a lot until you scrap them.
---
Cork is more difficult to find as there aren't a lot of items that give cork when scrapped. Objects to look out for are: baseballs, golfballs and (antique) globes. So in the end Whitespring is the answer once again.
---
I am apparently contemptible ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I think the most fun thing is not being a troll and posting shit posts like this that you're immediately going to delete right away because you're a piece of s*** who doesn't actually care about the game.
---
I think they get knocked under the map. Happens with legendary robots, too.
---
I've found that getting a loading screen will make the bodies pop back. Going through a load screen door or fast traveling.
---
Yeah, I miss Feed the People from when it did actually Feed (All) the People. I got so much Canned Meat Stew it wasn't even funny in those early days.
---
I did it nearly every time it popped up during the last DoubleXP.
---
I don't think I've ever failed it, except maybe in the very early days around Launch. Now, I'm usually soloing it.
---
Yeah. But that's a moot point. You'd do easily just as much with a junkie's weapon, but you don't have the vampire's regen at that point. The point was that even little changes to the survivability of a low health build is a massive hit to it. Nothing is tanky in this game other than Queen or Colossus, sans magic damage/bug abuse.
---
Are they not instanced? I'm pretty sure I did it the other day and my buddies were picking up diced vegetables either me or the other already picked up, like I grabbed them and he told me there was some there but only he could see them and pick them up.
---
I don't have it yet, but I plan on using it!
---
I don't like berets
---
I drop whatever I'm doing to so feed the people, gotta get that sweet 5% XP boost and food that doesn't spoil.
---
Drinking Nuca-Cola is so satisfying.
---
At low levels, use a bed to recover hp when not in combat, instead of using a stimpak.
---
Yeah, just for having an account before the update. Least they could do was do something special for people who actually participated in beta and thus made a preorder, but that's a bit too logical I guess.
---
Yeah, I know. Luckily it's easy for me to just not do those kind of things but I feel for anyone who can't. Exploiting the OCD or FOMO of some people, or whatever you want to call it, is appalling.
---
Not enough for the legendary sheepsquatch and 2 glowing deathclaws that 3/5 times spawns in my camp. 1/5 being goddamn floaters that destroys my camp every single time
---
The positioning to trip off the bug has gotten more strict, but it's still possible. I had it working just yesterday.
---
I just came in to say, the lag on XB1 is real. I really want an option to dumb down processing, just because of lag. I could live with a pixelated SBQ without lag
---
Ugh. As many of us probably do, I work full-time and don't have the time to play for several hours per day to grind the repeatable XP challenge. I can already tell I'm probably not going to be able to reach max rank before this is over with. Does make me a bit sad, there were some cool things I was looking forward to toward the end of the game board.
---
Maybe ... but if that's the case, it's kinda disapointing as well because it means we'll end up with an over-clustered map instead of just extending it.
---
Of the two maps for a game mode that should have more than two maps, it's the more recent one.
---
And by "recent," I mean it came out almost a year ago and isn't as stale as Flatwoods.
---
Bean counter here (not a Bethesda bean counter though).  You‚Äôre probably spot on.
---
Nevermind that people who never bought the game and just played during the first free weekend are also eligible for the ‚Äûveteran‚Äú reward...
---
Other than that, I also feel like most places seem put together way hastily. Crater for instance. It‚Äôs a cool space station place with raiders, but it still seems so... trashy? Unorganized? Yes there is a faction there, but it seems so tag-tag. I use that as just one example, but there are a lot of places where they obviously put a lot of time into, and a lot of places where it was just kinda... there. White springs, the ash whole ash heep, the guided meditation place, all have great detail and stuff. But my god there is so many places where it was so obviously slapped in:/
---
They said they also plan on d tending the map. They can do both
---
The best fix for this is to stop playing this inexcusable dumpster fire until Bethesda gets their shit together.
---
It's always Morgantown. 9/10 times, it's Morgantown.
---
They need to add more maps.
---
I can dig it. I've wanted to get into the whole roleplay aspect but too few players even know what it is, or at least it feels like it. I fall towards the raider side myself, not only because it seems more fun, but because I'm from WV and the raiders in wastelanders are my people. So gotta side with my people. Lol
---
I've been thinking for the last week or so about how I would like to make an extension of crater, fill the northern areas with raider camps, built by Raider players who are master builders. Probably going to pass the idea past the few people I know who play and build as an idea.
---
No war. I don‚Äôt think they even noticed each other‚Äôs existence before the Scorched wiped the Brotherhood out. It strikes me as odd that they didn‚Äôt at least mention them and the other factions in an Enclave terminal or something. I imagine MODUS might contact them; he contacted the Army survivors from the Settlers quest line in the hopes of recruiting him. Then again, he has the Residents now, and his primary goal seems to just be gathering information. I feel like if anything, he‚Äôd try to avoid a war because he really doesn‚Äôt want to get blown up again!
---
It lowers the weight of your armor and increases your ap
---
Ah, that's good to know!
---
It stopped after I switched from Unyielding/Bloodied to full health heavy PA but it came back like 2 weeks later. 
---
And it definitely feels as if it's getting worse with each passing day. Calling this annoying would be an understatement and the generic "we're still working on this" replies are starting to severely piss me off.
---
This fucking bug exists since bloody ages, jesus christ...
---
As a long time fallout veteran (played all of them upon release - yes I‚Äôm that old), let me encourage you to go back and play ALL of the previous games sometime.  They are all so good in their own unique ways but build the world and history that really make Fallout 76 shine.  So many nuances you‚Äôll miss by not having played before.   Welcome to Fallout!  It is my long-standing personal favorite game series and genre.
---
I had that happen as well. Four times so far.
---
I LOVE IT! It's so much better. Server stability is way up. I crash less. I can buy God roll items for caps. There's new content to grind and even a difficult new boss to fight. The cosmetics in the atom shop are really cool too.
---
Some things I'd like improved that have always been kinda a bummer are; the trade menu still randomly exits, the audio in game doesn't always work ( players often can hear you on mic), and I miss survival mode.
---
All that said though two thumbs up from me.
---
I got three of those. Every single one from the machine in the rusty pick.
---
The machine there knows that Mumbles will screw you over and offers you a free pie to compensate for the constant disappointment.
---
They have both a Cranberry Bog and a Mire map in game files, they just haven't released them yet
---
The power station in the north/northeast actually has a pretty good chance to have the large supply crate, and there‚Äôs usually a bunch of medium ones alone the way at the bases of the power pylons heading to town. 
---
But really, it‚Äôs just because a lot of people don‚Äôt like Flatwoods. It‚Äôs like if TF2 only had 2Fort and Sawmill. 2Fort is a timeless classic, but you can only play that one so many times before it grows old quick. 
---
What I‚Äôd really like is a map in the Mire. Not in Harper‚Äôs or anything. Just in the swampland. Spooky and dangerous.
---
LOL!
---
Last week at a FTP event we had someone log into the console at the first malfunction and do nothing, he just stayed there until the event timer ran out while everyone beat/shot him.
---
Yeah and it's a shame because that area was empty but it was a pretty nice landscape with a little river and stuff. Could actually be a comfy place for a camp if you don't mind the fact that it's a super remote place. All they had to do is just add a few more things here and there. Just ... finish it, I guess.
---
How many of those atom shop items are recolor/reskin. Takes an hour for one guy to pump out that kinda content. 
---
Oh wait, you want it tested too? Too bad, its just cosmetic. The test guy is still on furlough
---
Well, you‚Äôre a more respectable raider than I am. I mean I set boundaries for myself too. But for me the level cap is 50. And I‚Äôll just take junk if I happen to get to it if the previous owner doesn‚Äôt respawn soon enough. Wasteland is a dangerous place. Can‚Äôt just carry your valuables around everywhere. 
---
But, you‚Äôre still doing good. I hope there can be more like you and I out there.
---
I believe it's going up to 10k points, I forget where I read that
---
Its become stale to me because its the only map i ever play, i just wanna play flatwoods
---
ah, those were the days
---
They'll just pump the numbers themselves if it's going to miss, they won't want to look like they didn't have enough subs.
---
Fetchez la brahim!
---
I.....never even thought about that
---
Just get the 1400 daily caps from the vendors. I fast travel all the time and I'm always hitting max caps
---
I said *most*, not all.  You can find a couple exceptions, some magic, but by and large, the damage output of energy weapons is mediocre compared to their ballistic counterparts.
---
Its just tipped the opposite way now, ive played so much Morgantown i just dont want to poaya anymore, i miss Flatwoods
---
After level 5 you can get mutations from taking rads. You can only gain 1 mutation this way through a play session, if you leave a world and region you can gain another mutation though.
---
Mutations can be awesome, but they also come with negative effects. They can be lost or gotten rid of by using rad away or by walking under a functional decontamination shower(looks like a metal aarch that sprays water). They can be retained however and more can be prevented through the Starched Genes perk, this is obtainable at level 30 and is a 2 star(rank) perk. The first rank makes gaining or losing a mutation less likely to occur. The second rank prevents gaining or losing a mutation. Mutation serums can be used to gain specific mutations even while this mark is active. If you wish to try out mutations as a low level and need to purge your rads but don't want to lose your mutations there are 2 items that I know of, brahmin milk(obtained by walking up to a brahmin and clicking the action button) and Nukacola Grape which is most easily obtainable(though a little pricey) from the NukaCola vendor on the 2nd floor of the white springs(from the main entrance go up the stairs, hook a right past the bar, and the room should be on the left).
---
I'm actually surprised at how achievable the run has been so far. I pretty much only log in to do the dailies, and miss roughly one a day (usually the "level up" challenge in adventure and/or NW), and I'm pretty close to on track. 
---
When I first started I looked at the game board and told myself if I could get to level ~20 or so (the first starry wallpaper) I'd consider it a success. But now - just by playing an hour or so a day - I'm around level 61-62. 
---
I don't think I'll get to 100 by the end of the season, but I'm going to be much closer than I had originally guessed.
---
It's kind of disappointing that they didn't do more with this choice, like have the resultant Robobrain chill out at Foundation where you could talk to them.
---
Let go of the grind. No really, let it go. Those cosmetics are not worthy anyway; half of them doesn't even work properly...
---
A can for each dogfood you eat
---
I recommend a lever action, it will change your life
---
I scooped up a well rolled level 30 piece of Unyielding armor the other day for 500 caps, because I figured a little bit of missing DR wasn't the end of the world when I try to get Unyielding gear together.
---
But what about snot choocie disease
---
Ya i have a few but still I think it should still get a buff cause it just does not even touch a commando or heavy build
---
&gt; Spooky and dangerous.
---
And mist plus sun glare all the time, so exciting. ;-) And a Bog map would necessitate all new tactics, too: fighting in the trenches, like in a WW1 scenario?
---
Wait. You guys are getting masks?
---
I just use the skull mask tbh. Reminds me of CoDMW.
---
I‚Äôm at 55 and wanted the raider tree and chicken coup at 78. So that‚Äôs now my target, 78... don‚Äôt care about the other cosmetics..
---
wait i thought 50 would be the midpoint? aren‚Äôt there only 100?
---
I find chainsaws all the time for some reason. I mod them and hand them out. I fell like everyone should have one.
---
SELECTED ITEM CANNOT BE PLACED OVER ANOTHER ITEM.
---
I'm 37, I'm not old
---
Well don't tell me, tell them.
---
Why are you like this?
---
Just because they aren‚Äôt on the map doesn‚Äôt mean someone didn‚Äôt throw down their camp module behind a tree somewhere. Camps only show up if they have powered vendors and stuff to sell in them. Also fallout first tents will block you from placing your camp, they shouldn‚Äôt, but they do. I feel like tents should be kicked back to inventory if someone‚Äôs camp tries to place nearby and it conflicts. Tents are free to place and you don‚Äôt have to rebuild you can set one nearby the camp. Sorry you have to pay to fast travel to the purveyor but stop blocking out my church with your stupid butthole tent.
---
Yeah just wasted 95 technical data because i turned one in while i had all of them on me. Damn it
---
And you should be able to reach that without having to play almost every day but at the moment it‚Äôs almost impossible
---
They knew it was going to be an issue, that's why they give you the disease cure recipie early in the game, they just forgot to make the ingredients readily available. Lol
---
Nonetheless I still enjoy having rewards to unlock, but the grind is ridiculous
---
Nope. Rifleman does plenty of damage and is far less wastefull than commando. I've only ever crafted ammo on mine for challenges. Hunting rifles could probably use some attention to make them more endgame viable but other rifles are fine. I use a lever most the time and have a black powder that's great for giving SBQ headaches.
---
Bethesda is like someone that's had multiple children sequentially, but this is their first time with two kids in the room and they didn't predict any of the interaction that could occur
---
Yeah it‚Äôs should be fine. I work full time and only spend between 30-60mins per day, just score daily‚Äôs and switch off...
---
I remember after a queen fight I had a bounty and a lvl 5 I think was shooting me so I chased him down with pain train on in my power armour. Was the funniest thing ever when he died
---
Was it the actual armor or just a mod?
---
rip
---
However cool that would be, I already have too much cork.
---
Thats a plan for mod you need an armor piece and a armor workbench there you can modify your armor with specific mods its also important for which limb you got that mod plan
---
Haha yep i do exactly the same, fully upgrade it, make some ammo for it and then search for a player at that exact level and drop it for them.
---
Sarsaparilla sunset bottle caps also work
---
My last runthrough was the same: started alone, others showed late, canisters didn‚Äôt respawn, event failed. Alas!
---
I didn‚Äôt know about this bug where the whole server got food‚Äîthat‚Äôs brilliant. I would love to have them bring it back, I‚Äôd never skip this event if they did.
---
good, then this is essentially community service for them
---
Americans will literally use ANY other system of measurement than the metric system.
---
I'm talking about endgame mainly rifleman is only good for saving ammo Ive always been rifleman main even in FO4 as well but i switched to commando cause its just so much better in every way besides ammo conservation, levers are ok but gauss rifles and hunting rifles definitely need a buff imo 5 rounds is not enough and the hunting rifle needs more speed or damage or something to compete a little bit
---
Yet.
---
Non automatic rifles vs automatic rifles are definitely broken in their differences in dps. Pretty sure with all 9 ranks for non automatic rifles, you still do more dps with an automatic rifle of the same type even without any of the perks for automatic rifles.
---
Bone Worms. Rad Worms. I only ever get worms it seems.
---
Real talk even with solid disease resistance and marine wetsuit I'm endlessly catching shit. It's stupid easy to get a disease in this game.
---
I‚Äôm on xbox also and I have been wanting to solo the queen after getting a bloodied fixer from purveyor. But for a week now on Xbox I gotta kill enemies three to 4 times. Sometimes it will show damage but none of their health is moving. I‚Äôm not wasting thousands of ammo to have her health not move
---
forest disease cure ingredients are fairly common..
---
That makes sense. Well it doesnt but now i know why i was wating fuel lol
---
Ya man there just so much better especially in this game
---
Tell that to the random encounter.
---
You would use far less ammo with the non auto. It's the only thing going for it really.
---
Even if you could mod a marine armor piece with ultra-light, you can‚Äôt wear it until level 35.
---
I think, you also have to be the level (or above) of the item you want to craft
---
64 is the midpoint in terms of overall xp on the board required.
---
What other ways is there? Guaranteed reward isn‚Äôt appreciated by anyone. Do you flex your excavator power armor or Final Words? No because everyone has it. The Legendaries‚Äô scarcity creates the value and make people wants them. It‚Äôs completely psychological and nobody is twisting your arms to force you to play it. If you‚Äôre just happy with plain weapon and armors, none of the legendary items can make you login every day, it‚Äôs that simple.
---
If you don't finish it then you don't finish it. Finishing it is a reward if you put in the time. You get whatever rewards are equal to the put the time and effort you put in. 
---
If they make it that easy to finish why not just give us the stuff instead. If they make it impossible to not finish the legendary run in time why not just cut out the whole challenges thing and just says 'here are all your rewards. gg' 
---
 ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
I used a glitch for reputation for both the crater a d foundation, because I just don't have the time to play every day
---
Just use semi-automatic fixers and handmades
---
disease cure exists for a reason. The sulfur water fountain at whitesprings is free.
---
Prince would like to have a word with you sir
---
I suffer from glowing popsicles every time i walk into a nuke zone. I still don‚Äôt know what it does to me.
---
I don‚Äôt have an issue with not finishing it necessarily, it‚Äôs more that the amount of time/grind needed to finish it is too much, I agree, it shouldn‚Äôt be easy to finish, but you shouldn‚Äôt need to play every day finish it either
---
Yup thats about it but its pretty easy to get ammo especially 5.56
---
My lever is hitting for at least 2k plus, can‚Äôt really ask for much more
---
Do you only get one of each per character?
---
So if you have some of that meat then you can just go to them and sell it? Is it expensive meat?
---
I only cure the water and food loss ones. I did not notice any gamechange with others. Maybe the Blight, as it reduce strenght and thats why carry weight, but it just 1 point...
---
There's no point if the automatic variant hits almost the same damage as the semi variant
---
Mine is placed at whitesprings  just north of the mirekurk pond and I FEEL THIS
---
oh that makes sense. i‚Äôm still a bit behind that, somewhere near 48-50
---
Yes, for that reason I bought hot rot PA, to many weeks on sale
---
They‚Äôre not refusing to help, in fact they implemented a tool a few weeks ago to help find out what‚Äôs causing it. They literally don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs causing it, how‚Äôs that refusing to help?
---
When my automatic fixer can hit for 3.5 to 4k its definetly a problem
---
If ya wanna craft fuel for the flamer your best bet now is to make 2mm electromagnetic cartridges and convert em to fuel. It's almost a 1 to 1 conversion but heaps more cost effective than making fuel straight up. Personally I shop around for 40mm grenades/missiles/mini-nukes at around a cap a pop and convert those ;)
---
I just don't understand people?  "I wear this and that with the outfit, Looks great " like it is ok that Bethesda gave us something (half ass) as a Reward and never bothered to fix it. Nothing Wong here, move along!
---
I play through the pain. My wife is always happy when she asks if I have any extra antibiotics and I give her two dozen.
---
Unloading 25 bullets in short order at a cost of what, 30% damage vs a semi? Yeah it's pretty much a no brainer
---
Maybe they should make all those cosmetics available in the atom shop after the season‚Äôs over. But then nobody will ever grind again. If i can spend 500 atoms to buy a handmade skin i won‚Äôt play much to grind for it every day.
---
I do not know. Sorry.
---
Ehhhh I don‚Äôt really think so, some guns will be god tier others won‚Äôt. Can‚Äôt expect guns to be even across the board
---
Junkie builds are are very committed, not sure how you keep up with it.  I‚Äôm a Bloodied build of course lol
---
Exactly
---
thanks
---
You get cork in crystal decanters but I very rarely see them
---
They lock any and all tickets that mention it, they refuse to talk to players, they won't even give us atoms to replace the missing score.
---
But the plans from gold are non-tradable so even if you could dupe gold, it wouldn't affect people
---
Someday that will change.
---
I am not even grinding, I leveled up more in the Run during the Double Score weekend than in the double XP one, and I  am at rank 71, so I am 8 days ahead. And I even lost 1250 score once.
---
So, I do not see why it is a grind and why can not someone skip a day or two. We still have a lot of time, we will just hit the half time mark monday.
---
I know it's totally backwards
---
I‚Äôve had a similar glitch that worked itself out. Once I cashed in a treasury note, it showed the correct amount. You should have 250 gold bullion to start with.
---
Lol. You should have taken it all. There is no penalty for doing so.
---
You probably had to also split with that other dude.
---
They can be a lot more even than they are now its just annoying seeing a hunting rifle do barely more damage than a fixer in one shot with its pathetic reload time and  dps time
---
I did, I took all 1000 gold
---
Well I run both. Bloodied and junkies. Junkies is much easier to manage then bloodied. You just get addicted to 5 chems and you‚Äôre a junkie for life lol. I don‚Äôt have any good bloodied commando weapons right now so I use a junkies handmade and I can still kill the sheepsquatch imposter with one magazine. So I can‚Äôt wait to get my hands on a bloodied handmade or fixer.  My only good bloodied weapons are a bloodied faster fire rate pipe rifle and bloodied explosive black powder rifle.
---
Thats an great idea
---
You said you chose to split?
---
I agree, and it just doesn't feel right. A .50 sniper should be the finger of death and it is.
---
Yep...
---
Fixer is harder to get (legitimately) same with handmade I can understand them doing more damage than guns that grow on trees. My gauss shotty laughs at all those guns though, doesn‚Äôt mean anything should be buffed because of that
---
If you load into a world and get the message that your camp couldn't be placed chose the "try different world" or whatever it's called. 
---
Not sure that's true, though.
---
Afraid not, even though I knew better I still searched the place top to bottom just to sate my OCD. No dice.
---
vegetable soup and cranberry cobbler
---
And get that daily S.C.O.R.E. for joining a team while you‚Äôre at it
---
This pls
---
The 25% faster fire rate is added to the base speed of the weapon. In this case to 3.30, making it 4.125 and then after that the Powerful Automatic receiver gets added to it (4.20), making it 8.32.
---
This is the right answer. The negative effects are temporarily removed, making that Junkies lifestyle one hell of a ride!
---
Good fixers are everywhere right now im finding it harder to get a good BE lever than a B2525 fixer rn the gauss shotty has its downsides tho as it has no suppressing which really held it back for me in my opinion, if you play rifleman and commando u will definetly see the difference in how good they are
---
There‚Äôs a mystery afoot
---
Yes! I'm forever thankful to a player I found the other day. Can't 100% remember his name (was pacman then some numbers after) he was roughly level 258?
---
He gave me some stimpacks + food + plans and a brotherhood recon rifle!
---
I'm only level 10 and this is now my top weapon so I was so overwhelmed by his generosity!
---
It is not quite as useful then as the description suggests, or at least not for weapons modified with automatic receivers.
---
Wow, all in 1 sentence.
---
I had made a "trap" camp a week ago where I would dress as a skeleton, sit on a comfy chair and wait for players to fall in front of me. I'd just slowly get up, do the thumbs down emote and activate the 15 flamethrowers trap and take a few pictures of them getting BBQ'ed. Haven't done it for the loots, though ... they had tons occasions to store their junk and the few who actually droped something got it back. I also droped a few stimpaks/drugged they could grab before I pushed the button.
---
https://imgur.com/a/9hldPii
---
It's also how I found out that anyone can activate your traps. You can also use those flamethrower to destroy one of your wall, build something in the middle of it, repair it and tadaaa you just glitched whatever you just build through the wall.
---
There's probably going to come the time when you will run into a toxic player in the Wasteland.   For every one of these, there are several who are amazing.   Important to keep the latter in mind when you run into one of the former.
---
You sir deserve my upvote
---
Wait, if you're crouching you don't show up on the map?
---
How did i not know this?
---
I forget how much it is, but it's like 10 softshell meat, 15 Mirelurk Eggs, 1 Queen Meat, etc. Pick one option and sell it to her for Rep. (I kept getting into tangles with Mirelurk Queens so I always had some on hand to sell.)
---
You end up with Raider Rep and like 50 caps or so.
---
If you do the Fishbones quest first (he's inside the boat and you have to go through dialogue choices until you can choose, "Let me ask you about something else" and ask him if he needs any help) you can kill mirelurks who attack the water purifier and get enough meat to sell Blackeye on your way out.
---
That's what I use...soup first. Then have can dog food for back up. Spoiled flux for thirst.
---
You'll still show to teammates but otherwise you're hidden.
---
Minigun shreds everything fast. The sheep is very weak too once it‚Äôs visible. It‚Äôs always dead within seconds when someone grabs the pylons. They really need to buff it and extend the length of the event.
---
Good to know, I‚Äôm about to unlock it üò¨üò©
---
I have rifleman and an auto guy.  Both stealth. I actually have easier time with rifleman.  Its almost boring one shotting everything.  Both very similar builds and that IS on trash...not SBQ.  My auto guy stomps the crap outta my rifle guy on SBQ. Which is probably what everyone is referring too.
---
Wait... What?
---
did you choose to split the gold with Meg, or did you choose to take it all for yourself?
---
Where tf are you placed?? üò∞
---
Split it with meg
---
Since the beginning of the game I've had a recipie for a smore. Some day I'll be able to make it and I'll give it to someone as a gift. This has been my plan since level 1
---
Ya thats the main thing which is the sbq and yes u one shot everything but u also one shot everything with auto  and u can do it 10 times faster which is why it needs a buff and the rifleman is just not good at all for the queen
---
Yeah I walked out of one and was like WTF?
---
Yeah. An open pvp with no player markers (except if you want to be a vendor), timescale dropped to around 10. Some actual challenge to the survival balance. Could make 76 the game we'd hoped it was going to be before launch.   
---
I think they'd get a lot more business if there was more freedom to choose how you want to play, but they still want to treat it as if it's a centralized MMO type of thing, apparently.
---
I think what they intended them to be used exclusively as sneak guns, but with the builds out there as they are, you can easily use an automatic in a sneak build.
---
Personally I prefer semi auto rifles but I ended up playing auto, then finally switched to heavy. Funny enough I use the gatling gun as a semi auto in my heavy build, even though it is a full auto weapon.
---
There really ain't any clear balance to the weapons and builds though, unfortunately.
---
So you say, vendors are only safe, if I find a world where my camp can't be placed and I choose this option then?
---
Fucking. Nice.
---
Jetpack!! Makes the bullion grind way more fun!!
---
i have some gold bars you might be interested in ...
---
I'm talking about the Fat Man, Auto Grenade Launcher, and etc.
---
I actually have looted 3* off of a 1* ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.
---
Good point!
---
Instigating SS 90rw shovel. Not op at all but damn it's satisfying hearing the smack it makes.
---
It's not too bad, once you know where the shrooms spawn, but for someone looking for them for the first time and trying to build up stock of disease cures it can be a hassle.
---
I was more being a little sarcastic anyhow. Don't mind me, just poking fun a bit.
---
Honestly, they were probably just trying to give you a care package lol
---
I can dupe gold. The machine is powered by your mother's maiden name.
---
Also I'm not in any way associated with Rumpkestiltskin (PBUH).
---
I know what you mean. I prefer a pure sniper as well, but since I got my hands on a bloodied combat rifle I've swapped to commando. I still use a lever rifle/hunting rifle as my main though, switching to auto for the heavier mobs or boss fights.
---
Corn soup 5eva
---
I used to use razorgrain soup but you can fit 18 corn on one farmable tile as opposed to 4 razorgrain.
---
TAKE ME HOMEEEEEE
---
The point of literally all those perks and legendaries is to give the player an edge when their health drops low. The current bloodied meta is obviously unintended.
---
Attaching some compelling negatives to low health elegantly solves the problem without requiring a total rebalance of all those perks and legendaries: They'll still work as *intended*, but remove the cheese of permanent low health.
---
I love seeing trap camps. I have a building background and it always amazes me how some people‚Äôs creativity comes through. I often deliberately go into them just to see how the work. Then give some feedback and positive emotes to the builder. I am yet to build one but have some great ideas from seeing these designs.
---
The enclave controlled a lot of companies. Poseidon energy, vault tec. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they made an offer to mr.house and he told them to shove it. 
---
 the enclave really is an interesting faction. The problem has been a lot of the enclave lore is buried in earlier games which a good portion of the player base probably hasn‚Äôt played.Fallout 3 had some scattered around But players had to search for it. 
---
Really hoping Bethesda adds more enclave lore to 76 to oppose the brotherhood. they Allready  missed a huge opportunity in 3. the tension between Colonel Autumn and john henry eden(zax) would have made for some interesting gameplay. Colonel Autumns dad was an enclave scientist and is the one who led the enclave east to ravenrock after the events of fallout 2. His dad knew what henry eden was and passed that knowledge along onto his son. Where it gets interesting is Colonel autumn had enough sway within the enclave to form a rebellion. Even had plans to deal with eden if need be. As the colonel was not a fan of edens plan to wipe out anything even slightly mutated on the surface. But Bethesda in the end decided to lightly brush over it.
---
I dont think i ever had one and constanly have around 40. Just farm med boxes as you come across them
---
Yes. This would be great between own characters!
---
I stopped planting corn a long time ago. When I need some I just throw on Green Thumb and head to Silva Homestead and end up with plenty. 
---
But for a Corn Soup aficionado, it does make sense to have some immediately on hand.
---
it happens when you play NW and then play in adventure mode.
---
lol my recycled alt for level up dailies is also named baby
---
Ah ok guess i aint playing nuclear winter anymore can‚Äôt think with that stupid noise
---
Turrets are really not useful, I wouldn't even bother with them.
---
I once had someone do that last one with me at a workshop and it was the only time i enjoyed PvP. Enough to go and reclaim it for a second round and the dude even emotes back a thumbs up. I died both times but it was still fun. I think you're entitled to the persons junk at that point because everyone knows once you've claimed a workshop you're consenting to PvP. Its why i never have junk on me when I'm using one.
---
I don't need 18 (or any of the other plants) as i have green thumb and as a herbivore even just 5 or 6 can last me a long time but i like the aesthetics of  having stuff planted in my camp... even if it does take up lots of budget
---
In other words, there‚Äôs an early game challenge that you experience, that‚Äôs not overly debilitating, but once you learn how to overcome it you get a sense of accomplishment.
---
Haven‚Äôt played this games in weeks since I kept getting booted and the NPC won‚Äôt let me interact with them? Anyone still having these issues? Did they fix any issues?
---
&gt;  the queen has took
---
Might be my personal peevee, but I just can't stand that.
---
Use "The queen's taken" instead.
---
This does work, I will agree, just depends on how fast you are using them, and how willing you are to go looting. I've had pretty good luck in this department as well.
---
*Hermaeus Mora wants to know your location*
---
I just let them run their course. If I give myself parasites from drinking puddle water, so be it.   
---
Unless one of those diseased Scorchbeasts gives me Bat AIDS. I'll pop a cure for that one.
---
60 here. I have up and I'm gonna just get whatever I can and buy the rest at the endnof the season
---
They are saying you that you don't want to play in a server where your camp can't be placed. 
---
Doing so, and moving things in your stash while in that server, may result in your vendors being messed up.
---
Same. But as a Carnivore, I mostly just keep Tatos on hand. A few Gourds to help out my Herbivore friends.
---
At least use the truth... Contentupdates and patches cost real money for consoles, especially with PSN.
---
If you are consuming the bottle then you are getting drunk wrong
---
disease cures are pretty common in first aid containers making the run from 76 to flatwoods also...
---
Bethesda should seriously consider a disease build. The more diseases, high the damage output
---
https://youtu.be/VjXOwUnJzA0
---
Like with a health potion.
---
Really though, I remember when the game launched looking for the ingredients and found everything g but the shrooms, it was disheartening, I ended up looting for them, ignoring what diseases weren't really affecting me, stocking up as many as I could. Then I found out the shrooms were pretty common around Slocum Joe's, and didn't have much trou left there after. There is a learning curve to some of the crafting and Bethesda isn't really much for guiding. Lol
---
I did it as level 35, died like 40 times but somehow managed haha
---
Trade. I believe you get sort of a "pack" of super rare cosmetics, including both masks, very rarely as a reward for completing Savage Divide events.
---
whats the glitch?
---
What platform are you on? I tend to run into plenty of people using the voice chat, probably 1 in 4 people.
---
&gt;Why does f76 feel like a single player game?
---
because they gimped all the shit that was scary to casuals...
---
Spawning in later than everyone else seems to be a problem across all platforms. I play on PC with my partner, and we are on the same (exceptionally) high speed connection. We both have the game installed on SSD. Sometimes I spawn in a good 8-9 seconds before him, and sometimes other people are already running around with gear when I'm still loading. It NEEDS to be addressed. 
---
u/ladydevann are the devs aware of this?
---
You don‚Äôt need to play every day to finish it. Not only did the double XP and double score dailies help, there is upcoming double score and bonus challenges at the end of this month (assuming the community meets the targets for ATLAS, but I doubt that will be an issue). 
---
And there *should* be somewhat of a challenge to get through the entire run. If it was a task that you could complete in 30 minutes, it wouldn‚Äôt be very ***Legendary***, would it?
---
What's glitched about these gillie skin for ss?
---
i find that closing out of the game completely and logging back in fixes it until your next NW session
---
I use both. DPS of course is supposed to be different, but I believe the balance is per bullet damage. My rifles hit way harder in semi than auto, saving durability and bullets. I find it more satisfying to use less to achieve more.
---
Can't tell you here, but if you search "Fallout 76 settler reputation glitch", you should find something
---
who?
---
Im all for it as long as toons that play on a customized word are barred from joining public servers...
---
Pc is my platform. I have voice chat also. Discord. In game chat.
---
I forgot about this, that is truly the best little Easter egg in the game. IMO
---
you should just expect it and be pleased if it doesnt happen...
---
I doubt it, because it makes it a lot easier for dupers to mule duped items
---
Meh.  I guess.  I guess I'm just in favor of competition.
---
Not the nuke side, you know, the regular bright side ;)
---
That's a new one to me =0
---
Ok, interesting. But actually this didn't happen in the last days before this.
---
Why do they have to warn you, the game tells you workshops are pvp, its part of the game, they did nothing wrong and are not cheating or sucker puching, if you dont want to deal with PvP dont take a workshop, I'm not a PvP player but if take a workshop I'm fair game just like everyone else.
---
Good lord, I'm level 200 and I often find myself struggling with aluminium and oil
---
I mean, it is a post apocalyptic wasteland... I wouldn‚Äôt expect a lush ecosystem.
---
Let me get this straight. The first hour's response to this stupid goofy song is 2 downvotes and a fucking grammar nazi?  God damn but this sub fucking sucks ass - that's blaring proof of it.
---
Lol I'm curious myself ü§£
---
Mine was pretty simple, actually. It's basically a dead-fall trap lol. I figured people wouldn't just run and fall into it but, like you said, most are just curious and went into it willingly heh.
---
The flamethrowers are quite effective but each time you activate them, their durability goes down and they're expensive to fix ... like,  1 screw/flamethrower expensive IIRC.
---
I'm in pc as well, I guess just bad luck you don't run into anyone. You can try posting in this reddit with your level and say you are looking for people to play with, I've seen a lot of other people group up that way.
---
I'm with it, don't get me wrong.  I'm not asking for anything to be updated or changed, maybe I'm just fishing to see if I'm the only person who engages in PVP with a bit of chivalry?  Lol.
---
Outside of public events 76 might as well be offline. When you get an active public team it's like a totally different game.   
---
Hell, even "join team leader" quest intances don't let you progress as a team. It literally is single-player. Just dozens of single-players at once, for some strange reason.    
---
I've never long-term teamed up with anyone I met in this game. Still occasionally get good banter with randoms, but it really doesn't feel like the game was designed with social/community play in mind
---
Yeah my mate has one and he says the same! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
exchange for scrips
---
I thought that maybe they were trying to lead me to something good perhaps, it was just creepy as hell at the time...as I just gave a bunch of stuff to a dude at that first airport after I had looted it first and got the keycard, you may be right lol.
---
Live and learn, but the Wasteland IS a dangerous place after all lmao. ;)
---
Edit: it just died
---
You're lucky. The last 3 Mr Handy encounters I had ended with them trying to rob me.
---
Actually, its going up to 100k!
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5AO20UhNUTb3WsBNM6fWXl/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-ammo-converter-updates-purveyor-sale-and-more
---
Even better!
---
The cat model for all the paintings just died recently.
---
I hold onto everything. A few weeks ago I used my VE15 10mm sub level 10 to level a new character in 2 days. I also got a B25 10mm sub at level 20 which let me take down level 80 Scorchbeasts solo while leveling another character. They all have use, eventually
---
Doesn't seem like PvP worlds would give anyone an advantage, should they decide to go back to PvE.
---
I play everyday bud
---
Maybe because Bethesda finally realised that the majority of their loyal player base prefers solo gameplay.
---
It's been in the game since the real sheepsquatch was introduced.
---
Yeah it'd take almost no effort, money, or time to spit our free reskins/colours for us each week/month.
---
So you're telling me that last night when I was killed at the end of AWOL, and it wouldn't let me respawn, that after I let it sit, it still didn't? 
---
Wow dude that's crazy. I must have dreamt it! 
---
It works, you're a moron, and in the future you should really not comment on things you know nothing about.
---
This is why everyone laughs at you.
---
hot rot
---
&gt;Damage output/input
---
&gt;Day/Night Cycle
---
Will a wiki be ok for now? 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Fallout_76_outfits
---
You must be really afraid of those players armed with legacy weapons and PVP armor.
---
I get that encounter quite often when searching for a new camp pet, he should give you 50 or 100 caps if you talk to him a few times after you've killed the sheepsquatch
---
Agreed whole heartedly, the grind to get ally status deserves the travel benefit...
---
Yes he does give a reward
---
You probably didnt notice, its 50 caps I think
---
I waited over an hour once, it didn't respawn, all I got was a floating camera that followed my character when my friend would juggle my corpse with grenades! Only way to fix it is to shut down the game!
---
I would recommend getting the heavy combat armour plans then picking up the BOS plans at Grafton. Starting at level 10 you can have a great set of armour every 10 levels.
---
I just want to teleport on the first try
---
I don't really see the difference in Day Night cycle, but I assume he wants damage adjusted for PvP, not against PvE enemies.
---
That last parts up to the OP to explain, but what's wrong with a faster/slower day night cycle?
---
Imagine being this stupid.
---
Oh well.I did try talking to him but he wasn't responding :/
---
nocturnal weapons for one thing
---
That seems to be one potential cause, but I ran into the ‚Äòguitar sound‚Äô long before I played NW.
---
Its automatic, like when you complete an event
---
Thank god
---
It's a series bug that needs fixing, it happens if you die at the end of any event that implements that change to the respawn system.
---
I think people are annoyed at the hills in flatwoods. When the storms closing in and u have to climb the hill making it annoying. Justmy guess
---
How do you hide in the water without dying? (I'm pretty new)
---
Are they even a popular weapon in PvE? I doubt that letting them be useful for a little longer would give anyone an advantage over all the other builds that blow it out of the water.
---
Do you mean 0.5 weight?
---
Wow. Really? Thanks for informing me of something I obviously know. You're extremely helpful. Now try to get some accurate information to go along with that helpless and you'll be on to something.
---
Good, the only thing I got out of it was that you live your life by gross assumptions and then get upset when someone tells you its more complicated than that.
---
Not 100% true. You take a reputation hit for not splitting.
---
+8 intelligence from cooked scorchbrain/carnivore
---
they would be popular if you could set a fo1st world to perpetual nightime...
---
Before the wastelanders patch it actually made players wait till everyone had loaded. Now it just dumps players in whenever they are ready it seems. It definitely feels like a bug.
---
Aim for the faces
---
I don't consider going into photo mode, building 5 plants and killing 10 scorched to be grind.  It's literally seconds of effort.
---
Do these people not wipe their butts because that is more of a "grind" and I seriously wonder how they keep themselves fed as opening a box and pressing buttons on the microwave is more of a grind.
---
These are some seriously low energy people.
---
That bug was awesome. Getting cans of stew from nowhere and having a carry weight of 1000/-10 were the days
---
You already said no more responding, Mr. Man ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I'm just try to figure out if your curious about something or trying to corrects something. Bloodied has been an extremely common descriptor for people with low. Its noone refers to people as "low health guy". I'm just trying figure it out what your curious about. Response or not, I hope your wasteland adventures are fruitful.
---
Yeah, this was what motivated me to ask/look into it. Hell, Penny earlier in the questline asks what sort of person would make a Robobrain. Er, apparently us. It can be argued it's for the greater good, to give people a chance at a better life on the large scale, but it doesn't help Gina.
---
Honestly it might be more enjoyable if they added 1 or 2 more maps, and after a month of their release, have the game randomly pick maps instead of relying on player voting.
---
I find a bunch often in Mothman Cultist hangouts! I think the Hornwright (or Garrahan, can't remember which one but probably both have em) Estate has some too!
---
S‚Äômores have only been in the game for like a year
---
Yep. I encounter that one quite a bit when server hopping random encounter areas for potential animal taming.
---
There's a lot of problems with PvP etiquette. The last contested workshop PvP I had was when my current character was lvl 7, in mostly lvl 1 leather, against a lvl 200+ buckethead.   
---
Guy at least had the decency to stand and fight instead of just ganking me, but rather than bowing out gracefully after eating all of my ammo and dying, he just respawned and killed me.   
---
Honestly I'd rather be TSE sneaked than put up with the infinite "Revenge" loop.
---
A bit extreme, but I understand what you mean. I still don't see it being an unfair advantage with all the oneshot builds around as it is.
---
I have to do more research into nocturnal weapons, though
---
Loot while you shoot. That's what I do while doing uranium fever. Lags the game a lot though.
---
I wouldn't expect to find a shit ton of rad deers right next to the biggest raider hotspot either lol. Same with that statue you must take a picture of.
---
Yep I got 2 pieces i can jump from any height now
---
Sometimes I will own a workshop, but it won‚Äôt show up as taken by me or let me free fast travel to it lol
---
I can't imagine how you can possibly hit CAMP limits having "just started."  I've run a couple alts up and past level 50 completing wastlanders if not also main storyline before I'm having any storage issues.
---
Wow you're so aggressive against someone who was warning that not everyone is lucky enough for the game to just let you out of the bug after a few minutes.
---
I forget he is there sometimes and I'll be looting FD and he will come out of nowhere and scare the pants off me. Nearly as bad as that damn Wendigo.
---
Oh noüò•
---
Well if you just ignore it, it doesn't exist right guys!?
---
No.  Nor does it include lunchboxes giving you ridiculous amounts of XP on double score week turning some events into SCORE fiestas with multiple ranks gained.
---
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è damn it..
---
But that's the fun part of it, eh? You really gotta be wary of people trying to "help" defend workshops, nobody over lvl 100 really needs those measly xps and probably came to kill you.  
---
Be ready for everything and have at least 8-12 mk2 turrets all around. Place a teleport mat at strategic place, behind an obstacle; always teleport while cloaked and drugged, deploy PA frames to redirect fight... Lotta fun things to do in workshop.  
---
Somtimes, if you find a fellow like-minded pvper, you can even have some chivalrous melee fight, mano a mano. Those are the best.
---
the point being.. any customized setting that could be used to create an advantage not available in a public world is not equal footing IMO..
---
you are entitled to have a different opinion than mine.. I dont mind
---
It should actually be a little easier to get the last half than the first half as there are more challenges now and will be even more added with the Brotherhood thing.  Also lunchboxes help.
---
Of course with auto-complete bug, YMMV.
---
I came across someone‚Äôs camp last night that had a memorial with a bunch of plants and Mr. Pebbles up against a wall. The wall had pictures and neon letters that said ‚ÄúRIP Galen‚Äù and there was a paper bag with some comics left in them. I thought it was for someone‚Äôs kid or friend and I got really teary eyed and left a comic in the bag. They logged off before I had a chance to say anything. So this helps explain that.
---
No, they're not at war quite yet. However, I would imagine that the Enclave would take notice of probably the only other faction in the entire wasteland with a large fighting force and access to probably the most advanced technology in the Wasteland (aside from what the Enclave themselves have access to). So even if the war isn't actually going on yet, the Brotherhood should still be a pretty... eye-catching faction for someone like MODUS and an organization like the Enclave.
---
Waiting for someone one to moan cos they never managed to tag it and didn't need another white fedora üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Some people just don't care about fair PvP, and that's sad. This is why the game sucks for PvP.
---
Where do you find em?
---
Lol that is hilarious.  Make sure he‚Äôs either naked or wearing something very strange
---
I always hated the fact that they call it a "veteran" rewards and yet even new players could get it
---
I get it, I don't mean for this to be more than a friendly argument.
---
Bethesda doesn‚Äôt care bout this. They have made it clear they are not going to fix any bug unless it effects their money somehow.
---
It's not mine, but somebody posted a gallery of the rarer outfits many months ago. Not all of them are super rare, but most are at least uncommon. I can also tell from a brief look that it's a bit outdated by now, but still better than nothing
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/79uAEOc
---
Oh wow. I came across one of these shrines. I thought it might be someone's own pet. It kind of hurt me because I've been adopted by a doofus that looks just like him and been using the same pictures to represent him.
---
True end game is the gather wood achievement.
---
It's possible that the enclave had a hand in it, since they were basically a "shadow government" operating within the actual government and pulling the strings.  But in fallout 4, the assaultron that's in the railroad headquarters leaves clues that she may have pre-emptively launched nukes at China based on incorrect assessments which resulted in China launching theirs and then the world was anhilated.  I don't think there's any confirmation as to what actually started the apocalypse, but it's a pretty good theory, and it's possible the enclave had a connection to that defense system since they have a tendency to rely on AI and huge computer networks to observe and control things.
---
The "cork" could also be made of plastic.   Seen them around often enough.
---
I only eat ionized meat.
---
Would be nice to get the random yells your character made while taking drugs in fallout 4. Imagine a SBQ nuke dropping and you just hear random roars and "FUCKING KILL" all around you
---
The purv just dropped an instigating/33vats gat laser on me. Have not tested yet, but if it works like my stalkers/33 vats mini, she'll die as soon as she lands...
---
I never join public servers. So, no worries op and all.
---
I don‚Äôt play a ton of NW but when I do I always vote Flatwoods and we always end up in Morgantown. I miss walking the bridge.
---
Existing friends will say online or Visiting private or offline etc. A name with nothing after is must be a friend request, that's how you tell.
---
Like a band-aid, best to get it over quick.
---
Same with Brain Bombs.  +3 Int before Herbivore and Strange in Numbers.
---
"No soup for you!!"
---
Same man, fighting on the bridge was fun
---
Don't forget about all the useless atom shop stuff that's guaranteed to be overpriced or a reskin
---
Well Fallout is full of mysteries that makes the games so good. The story is so dark and so evil in Fallout dystopia.
---
I don‚Äôt see that they would.  If GameStop prices and early sale markdowns were any indication, sales fell way short of their expectations. I doubt they‚Äôd risk it when they could rerelease Skyrim.
---
Hmm, I have never had a request appear in my friends list though. I only once had a request appear with a dot under "recent", but it never happened again. Now I just receive the friend notification and no way to tell Who sent it, unfortunately. Maybe it has to do with the fact that I play through Steam, who knows.
---
The thing is, you CAN complete every challenge in 30 minutes. I still don‚Äôt get the complaining. Autocomplete bug, yeah I get it. But these challenges are so simple. Join a team. Take a picture in photo mode. Buy 3 bullets. Kill stuff you‚Äôd kill anyway. Build 5 stairs. Oh here‚Äôs a bonus challenge for doing those 5 simple challenges.
---
Exactly what I was going to say. Herbivore + melons. You pay in carry weight for the convenience though.
---
I‚Äôm glad that wasn‚Äôt your experience, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt an issue for some.
---
Something that usually works if you both know each other's IGN is they type your name in and send a request and you do the same.  Once you have both done it they should appear in your list now.  Actually getting the social menu to show pending requests tends to only work if you are in the main menu.....when it wants to anyways.
---
I shouldn't need to suggest workarounds but this has been broken forever with no indication anything is being done to fix it.
---
I meant the entire Legendary Run in 30 minutes.
---
Perhaps, but that's where they always show for me (greyed out), it can glitch though, both of you sending requests auto accepts it, so that's the workaround.
---
Agreed.  That's my only beef was people who appeared to be helping for a minute or two, then blast you.  Perhaps the community being so nice has made me gullible.  I legit will fast travel to help defend other peoples shop to "complete an event" though, so idk.  The best times were shortly after launch.  I set up workshops like a paintball course with the huge walls.  The days when a Vampire 10mm SMG was insane for PVP because basically nobody had legendaries yet.  Side note: the welcome mats dont work like they did in FO4 if I'm not mistaken,as in a spawn point.
---
Yes, that I know and at least that works, for real life friends or trades.
---
classic todd manuver. Never fixing bugs.
---
junk. They got junk i'm there.
---
A Middle Finger Emote. That is the only one I would grind my ass off for/pay outrageous Atoms for.
---
That would still be too long for some, I‚Äôm sure.
---
I'll give that a try. Thanks for the tip.
---
Also, junk
---
Sadly, this don't work for me.
---
Sadly, this didn't work for me.
---
Yea, that is one thing that at least works, fortunately.
---
Cool. Glad to know. Thanks for the info.

The last time I asked one of these posts sincerely were there any benefits to beg based food outside of food and water, I got a snide 76 vegan "you might get a little buff for meat but while your eating I just move on". I had to remind him he has to eat his precious soup too, the buff is 30min and water doesn't spoil like soup does.
---
I have 28k caps on my sniper character, I have low thresholds.
---
5+ I'll go anywhere.
---
Otherwise,
---
High number of weapons (10+), and in the forest region, I expect it to be new player focused. Will go if I need to unload plans/ammo by dropping it at wayward after visiting.
---
High number of weapons in other areas (15+), i expect overpriced weapons
---
Xcloud.
---
Another vote for junk.
---
Fuel or fusion cells
---
I‚Äôm a new player, but if I claim a workshop, and someone comes to take it from me, I can just leave and not worry about pvp right? They can‚Äôt chase me down and kill me unless I engage?
---
I want to know why gulpers beep when I shoot them.
---
Bears me. I switched right back to the Raider Punk as soon as he quest was done.
---
I did not find the voice over work very good. Especially for Emerson. So drawn out and ugh.
---
Wow what are you guys looking for with junk?
---
Maybe they are synths !
---
Just started fresh with my mutations. Got marsupial, healing factor and carnivore. So tempted to get bird bones again.
---
What junk are people looking for?  Just started loading bulk scrap yesterday and was surprised steel and adhesive sold in minutes.
---
Will this work with pc?
---
Yeah.
---
You were most likely in a group and one of the members launched a nuke. Sorry mate.
---
I accepted. Not sure when I'll be on but on and off all weekend. 
---
I pulled the plan and it's in my inventory :)
---
Same here, seemed to spawn fairly frequently in the mire, north east of the red rocket megastop in particular.
---
As long as you don't go to the workshop when it's being claimed you'll be okay. 
---
I've captured many workshops but I've never had a single one be taken from me.
---
Of course you eat the bottle. We ain't savages.
---
I'd be happy with actual bug fixes that often. I dont think this ship is sinking just yet, but its definitely listing to one side.
---
Whaaat. That's weird, I had that happen before and it didn't mark the quest complete. Well, I'll nuke the FSP just in case lol.
---
Was doing Feed the People and I killed 3 regular ghouls and the lvl 30 was pissed. I never one shot legendaries unless no one shows up after I‚Äôve done the follow me emote.
---
Nah more annoying when big lvl bitches like yall gotta hide on your tents cause your afraid of lvl 63 fucking scorched.
---
 "No soup for you!!"
---
John Brown was a fucking badass.
---
Ah.  Haing only one character, didnt know the challenges were account wide.
---
Does seem like there should be an alternative to the Legendary run For people that have completed both the run and the challenges.
---
in general I look for camps that have a wide variety of items.. in good quantity and are located in areas that seem to me to be catering to higher level players..
---
I visit camps in the east and the west.. but my expectations of the content in the vending machines in those areas differs greatly 
---
when I am actually hunting for gear for my toons I take location into account probably a little more than how much quantity they have.. call it 60/40
---
IMO the worst case scenario is a whitesprings station camp or watoga station camp thats loaded with noob gear.. smh
---
I believe they were automatic.  Bethesda felt bad so they gave people 76 and 1,2 and tactics on steam.
---
bulk steel, lead, ballistic fiber, maybe acid and cloth
---
&gt;"No soup for you!!"
---
Like as in can you use xcloud on a PC or can you use xcloud for PC games made by Xbox?
---
Compulsively picking literally everything up and converting it to crafting mats, I guess.
---
The only other thing I have stored is some Aid items and a partial T-60 power armour with the frame.
---
How do they cheat in NW? I only played NE a couple times and I get my ass beat every time.
---
Bought some bullion from his yesterday, didn‚Äôt know 5k was the cap though so he owes me a few dozen. 
---
Now I‚Äôm trying to figure out what to spend it on.
---
Bulk steel, lead, ballistic fiber, maybe cloth, acid and plastic.
---

If you really think their programming team is stalking Reddit for obscure bugs and glitches, then boy do I got a bridge to sell you...
---
I‚Äòm with OP here. We know it‚Äôs bugged (even I personally only ever had it happen when playing NW before starting Adventure after the reset) and crying about it on the subreddit won‚Äôt do jack shit about it.
---
God damn I'm stoned I thought I was on the red dead 2 subreddit
---
I buy plans (unknown, not read yet) that are cheap even if i have no use for it. In a way, im supporting the player who is selling them.
---
Negative Ghost Rider.
---
Can I play my Pc version Fallout76 remotely on an Android device through this.
---
And even more afraid that yall pla e it so its 15 ft off the ground thinking being up on the top wasnt enough. You gotta make it float cause your just so afraid of the queens minions.
---
The only thing I‚Äôm visiting y‚Äôall for is plans. Plans, plans, plans.
---
And if I show up and you don‚Äôt have any I need, I might buy some small fry things like explosives. Can‚Äôt have enough of those.
---
Under 40? Jesus man the movie is a classic. I‚Äôm 29 and have seen it dozens of times.
---
I've got 237 plans, 27 weapons, and almost 2k steel, please someone come shopping üò≠üòÇ I need the stash space
---
Yesterday I chased a level 16 around to give them a 3 star hunters explosive 10mm pistol. Might be a crappy gun, but it‚Äôs better than anything they‚Äôll likely find for a while.
---
I'm going to say yes if it's from Game pass and it's fallout 76s 'Xbox Version' don't quote me on this though. Reddit seems to eat people alive for mis information. So just know I'm not 100% sure of this.
---
Dias... cackles maniacally.
---
The comment from Radcliff was well worth it.
---
Ah, okay. About how much are they going for?
---
And yeah, I read that, but it seems like there are barely any events in SD. I run every one I see, but no luck yet.
---
Anything with 10 or more weapons and/armor... I also never go to camps on the golf course no matter how much they have, but will always go to a rare Mire camp no matter how little. I'll also check out Wayward camps.
---
gotta feed the scrapbox before i cancel FO1st
---
I'm on vacation rn, so I cant play for 3 days.  You wouldn't believe how much tighter it makes everything just missing a few days.
---
i often see one around in one of the shops, among other miscellanious low-rarity outfits.
---
I look at the plans amount, because It tells the aproximate level of the owner so I can have an idea of the quality of the other stuff I'm going to find there
---
There was someone there with stronger guns doing the job.
---
I've found them a few times in the little barn across from Charleston train.
---
I ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù a new one last night.  
---
Needle Spine.  Effect is -10 carry weight.
---
Folks always clean me out of bulk Acid, Gears, Springs, Adhesive etc.  
---
Loose screws and Titanium go pretty quick. Ballistic Fiber and Ultracite sell like hotcakes.   
---
Nobody buys cloth, cork, or leather. And I'm not giving you my plastic.
---
I will basically buy anything as long as it's not ludicrously overpriced like 10 caps per steel.
---
Sucks, never had a nuke launched on my camp but I guess I‚Äôm at a spot where it would really be a waste. 
---
I would say the beginning area once you leave 76 is pretty safe. But tbh most of the map is safe. Been playing forever and it‚Äôs 95% to fight the queen and before that it was Whitesprings. The rest was Helvetia during the parade cuz some people had to be jerks.
---
I‚Äôve found them in the flat woods church. Also in a shed off of one of the forest stations but I can‚Äôt remember which one.
---
Good chance of it spawning in the clothing shop in Sutton. Also in the barn across from Charleston train station.
---
They absolutely do, e.g. if you have your workshop claimed while being somewhere else, you can very well teleport into it (after you switch to pvp build, pop in some pills and stuff) and surprise the attacker.  
---
Personally I quite enjoy workshop PvP, both as and attacker and defendant, as it's perhaps obvious from my posting history; it's basically the only thing beside trading and building that I do. So any would-be claimant, masking himself as an inconspicuous assistant, is always welcome ;)
---
Ohhhhh I hate this. My teammate is my wife! I'd love if we could quest together again but, noooo it might mess up my experience if she chooses something I wouldn't do. How about less worrying about optimized solo oriented quests and, more multiplayer quest! Before wasteland I'm pretty sure I remember the leader shared there main active quests so I could help them. My wife is done times terrible at finding stuff when with an arrow to it so it was nice that I could help her by pointing that kind of shit out.
---
Yeah not so much. I watched what people were doing and watched it‚Äôs health bar go down as I hit it. I had all the right perks on to smoke this thing into 2021
---
When i have to test sound systems at work i always use Top Gun (if i can find the disc). That opening 5-6 minutes is wizard for sound.
---
E for effort friend. Have some silver.
---
True but with the 30 item per vendor limit isn't it hard to tell if they are new Vs just gave up on selling plans?
---
You know that huge area in the south corner of the ‚Äòheap is up to sumpin
---
I swear there's like 5 of them every time i go through West Tech
---
I saw a lvl 15 on the map and crafted a handmade for them. I then tried to give a lvl 5 a modded hunting rifle but he just kept moving and I don‚Äôt usually play with a mic lol.
---
If I do get any low level legendaries I might just keep a few just to give out.
---
until you get there and its 45 chem benches.. lol
---
Not what I said. I don‚Äôt think a 3rd part market  where people artificially inflate prices an actively dupe and crash said market has anything to do with the game.
---
It‚Äôs documented that most of the Fallout community refused to partake in their beta platform, Bethesda admitted that fact themselves. It‚Äôs fact that Bethesda lowered damage on players attacked by those desiring PVP. What other facts are required to finally kill this widely unwanted ‚Äúfeature‚Äù.  Please, feel free to dispute the facts.
---
Are you trying to put me out of business. I make good caps selling antibiotics and disease cures I‚Äôll have you know!
---
I might have a second if your on PC
---
If ammo is in the thousands, I'll go for a look.  
---
If you're selling 10mm and .38 I'll leave fertilizer on your bed.
---
you progress is saved to your bethesda account. buying the wastelanders stuff is basically just adding the cosmetics to your account. as long as you are playing on the same platform (in this case, PC) you keep everything regardless of the launcher, however for-real-money purchased atoms and Fallout 1st subscriptions are only accessable on the launcher they were purchased on (Bethesda dot net, steam, etc.)
---
buying the wastelanders cosmetics bundle will not reset anything. if you already own 76, i would not recommend getting the wastelanders deluxe edition as you're just buying the game again. just get the raiders or settlers bundles, or the wastelanders bundle that includes both.
---
a life lesson here
---
Ok cool.  I‚Äôll be on and off during the weekend too but I‚Äôll look for you when I‚Äôm online :)
---
What great idea! Kudos!
---
üññ Live Long and Prosper üññ
---
Yeah, those recon rifles are good to make to gift to lower levels.
---
I like to put my own special touch on it, in the form of a .50 receiver, because it's easier for me to crank out 180 .50 than .308
---
Sorry I'm on ps4, thanks for the offer tho!
---
  Go solo in power armor (targeting HUD is helful)  and a troubleshooters or AA weapon.
---
  There will be significantly fewer enemies if you are alone.
---
move slow, crouch at corners to find the turrets, when you hear them ratchet around, back up a bit, then snipe them.
---
I like helping people just to make em squirm a bit and then I leave. Free adrenalin!
---
Yes. Put them on a foundation slab by themselves (no decor or anything, and don't attach the foundation to another piece. Just have it by itself with 2 or 3 vendors however many fit, and do this twice if needed). Then when you move camps, it will be a blueprint you can place and you won't have to refill them. This also works for display cases so you don't have to keep putting crap back in them. Just make sure to have nothing else on it so you don't get that "item needs support" message.
---
A B25/250DR gatling gun. I love it so much. I still try to get my hands on a B2525 gatling tho.
---
What shop exactly?
---
Had her for a while even after completing her quest but got Wanderer atm. I wish she‚Äôd play my piano or something but she isn‚Äôt super annoying.....yet
---
I'm a bit of a cosmetics whore and stumbled across all the stuff you get. It's going for ¬£23.99 and I usually pop ¬£15 in per month on top of fo1st atom buff to get stuff from store so it seems almost worth it. üòÇ
---
It happens often, but someone with 15-30 plans is almost surely a noob. Noobs have sometimes treasures at ludicrous prices though
---
To use your power armour, you need to place it, by using the action button on it in your inventory, that way only you can access it and it will automatically be recalled to your inventory after 60 seconds if you don't enter it. Don't drop it from your inventory, as that will leave it where it is, but also allow others to take it, which you obviously don't want. When you run out of cores, you can exit your power armour and store it until you find more.
---
cant think of how to describe it. its one of the abandoned stores, there's like a bus or trailer in front of it?
---
You can't do anything with power armor until level 25
---
Have never seen a mega sloth.
---
What town/ place is it close to?
---
Figured it out! Thanks!
---
I know. When I first read about him, I just skimmed and thought he was a racist, but when I went back to read thoroughly I was shocked at how much he was the opposite. 
---
I‚Äôm so glad I took the time to find this in game, it was hard. I just hit level 25 and I swear I got murdered at least 10 times by charred feral ghouls. I hate those beefy fucks
---
Interesting as they only appeared today.  Maybe doing a batch addition or something.  Anyways thanks for letting me know.
---
Not sure how they know my steam account.  I only have NV and nothing else.
---
okay yeah that one is worth it. there's also a deluxe edition that has the game and the two bundles, that's the one i was cautioning against since you already have 76
---
When you get out of your power armor you have 90 seconds before it automatically returns to your inventory.  No other players are able to take it or get in.  When you select it in your pip boy you want to click on "deploy" and not drop.  If you drop it its up for grabs and will not return to you unless you pick it back up.
---
Power Armor stations are only crafting stations for Power Armor. It will always be part of your camp.
---
Players cannot steal your Power Armor unless you drop it instead of placing it. Power Armor returns to the owners inventory after one minute, if you placed it rather than drop.
---
Is there a change shortage? I think someone told me about that.
---
Sutton. the town by the Overseer's house. sorry, brain fart, thought i said that in my initial comment.
---
To add to this, bed, not sleeping bag or mattress on the ground.
---
You get cooties from sleeping on the ground.
---
There will be a plan for a simple bed at the overseer's camp.
---
Got it. Thanks!
---
If you are wearing a stealth suit your damage is coming from the sneak bonus, not berserkers. As a level 25 stealth suit already has enough dr to completely negate the damage bonus, and higher level suits reduce your damage to less than a non legendary weapon.
---
I‚Äôve been looking for those too, very cool!
---
Yeah seen a few people complain about the same thing unfortunately. Luckily there isn't really any story to that quest, so while it may be complete, you will get the exact same experience by just dropping a nuke on fissure site prime anyway.
---
Bravo on finding this video!
---
I could be wrong but I'm sure the trailer at mama dolces sells them. Of not the whitesprings resort vendor, I want to say brotherhood sells it regularly
---
Ah no problem. I'll have the check it out. Thanks!
---
I would rather pay with food/water bar decrease or buff duration decrease so it actually makes sense you know, traveling takes time and shit.
---
Who the fuck are we paying the caps to? Such an arbitrary game system that could have been sold much better.
---
Idk, to be honest.  I dont really remember claiming anything, just remember finding them in my steam account, and 2 of 3 of them not running at all.
---
Sorry if I'm not understanding properly, but what trailer?
---
You can wear the empty frame.  Depending on current level and gear it may be the best armor available for you at the time.
---
I'm level 450 and I started dropping plans. I never sell them for more than 50-100 unless they are rare plans like the stimpack diffuser or one of the bear arm mods. They weigh too much for me to keep and keep the legendaries I have up for sale. 
---
I have a camp near Mrurmrmrgh so I get quite a decent amount of traffic but I hope people are judging based in the number of plans. I often drop them by my Christmas tree for free too.
---
Ahhh, thanks for advice. Think I'll get it then.
---
I have been hunting wanted people in the game since the launch. I'm at 48/76 if i remember correctly.. Should just use my second account and get it over with xD
---
Upvote for the spontaneous display of anger
---
"Power Armor Stations" are crafting benches and will move with your camp like everything else. No one can steal items you've placed through the build menu. "Power Armor Chassis" are holders for the individual pieces. If you place it down using the place option you can swap pieces and enter/exit the armor safely. In 60 seconds it will teleport back to your inventory. Think of the chassis like a pokeball, all of the actual armor and the fusion core are in it but it's listed as a chassis and can be compactly stored in your inventory or stash. If you simply drop the chassis from your inventory then anyone can take it, so don't do that unless you're discarding the set.
---
I use parsec, I think I've only had like 20-30ms delay at worst. I even use it out of state and have peaked at like 90ms delay.
---
I only use hunting rifle for actual long range sniping..
---
levers and handmades are my goto for when things get up close and personal.. primarily the lever.. but you can throw a lot of lead downrange quickly with a semi handmade

Im playing a simple [Non-Addicted Full Health Sneaky Vats-Crit Rifleman](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=6b455be&amp;d=sa0sg2pd2pk2e82c72i11ic2a72lr2pp0pl2lt2a02e00a31lv1l71ao0an0ar0p00sv0sb0lk2lb0cu0&amp;w=p80p90ij2i42iq2pa0lm0at0ed3i30ia0i50if2ik0c52&amp;m=5c8&amp;am=-13-1f-1321-1d&amp;wp=w5w5w5w5&amp;wm=1a2936-1124-17-1d) and I fuck shit up on the reg yo..
---
Im not soloing SBQs or anything of that nature of course but when all the perk cards are working properly I feel like its fairly powerful...
---
You can also go to the recent players tab and scroll through that.
---
They'll likely be there and will have that dot at their name indicating the friend request.
---
You are still counted as being in a team.
---
At mama dolces. There is a truck trailer just inside the building to enter it but it sticks out side of building. You lockpick the shutter and there is one in there I'm sure. If not whitesprings is a good bet.
---
From what I understand, you need at least one other player on your team for that perk to work. üòä
---
Oh ok. Thanks!
---
I'm not sure about the android compatibility though. I know you can download on Android but last I checked it was work in progress.
---
Yeah they'll come either way. But if two people place there tents just right by the spawns, the scorched will literally all spawn infront of sonic generator and yoy just gotta tag them with a m79 before the high lvls shoot there gauss shotguns lol
---
FYI it only occurs when running low health bloodied and having the healing factor mutation. If u remove healing factor the bug goes away. Friend I play with and basically run the same build and he redid his mutations and got rid of healing factor and has not had a single problem since
---
If you go up to vault 79, go east from there until you find a little pond with I believe a crashed helicopter or plane in it. There you can find a megasloth that‚Äôs tamable. Can‚Äôt be a ‚Äúhulking‚Äù.
---
Edit: 79, not 97 lol
---
Long term FO players seem to be old school solo rpg players.  That‚Äôs my case.  I was super concerned about multiplayer/online.  Public teams gives me just enough social though.  Love having player vendors and it feels like a new addition to solo FO.
---
I am still turned off by people doing dumb shit trying to PVP and I have yet to touch NW.  
---
Overall after preordering the game and having beta loaded, the multiplayer aspect worried me and I didn‚Äôt touch the game until this March.  I am both happy and upset I waited so long.  
---
What has been amazing is the community.  FO76 has added a layer of community I have not had around the game.  Both in game and online the community is awesome, willing to share advice, help each other, show off camps, trade.  That is the multiplayer magic for me.  Let me be my lone wondering junk hoarding self but let me be social when I choose.
---
As much as people bitch about Bethesda, bugs, atom shop, FO1 and such they need to climb into a time machine to 1997 and follow the journey of the FO universe and see all the amazing growth and positive changes between versions and how FO76 has given a community to us deeper then just the mod community.
---
Love public teams and the balance to let me take advantage of group play but continue to play my style.
---
Not bad good start ty
---
Inspirational needs an actual group for it to work. Not just solo group.
---
Yeah I'm looking for a gallery since that sucks to click on everything
---
You might want to sell those pieces depending on your current level, unless you have a ton of stash space.  They are heavy and take up a lot of room. Plus it's relatively easy to find more pieces when you are ready to start using it.
---
On the plus side, as heavy as they are once you are able to equip them the frame takes the weight.  No matter how many parts you have on the frame, it will always weigh ten pounds in your inventory.
---
no period, not a sentence, come off it mang
---
Yeah this community is awesome but dont touch my cork üòÇüòÇ
---
Vanguard's armor is trash at the high level, it is super amazing early game, a level 1 suit of full vanguards is good enough to take the toughest end game enemies.
---
Damage reduction from armor is a function of the value of armor vs the value of damage taken, it takes more armor to reduce a huge hit than a small one, so gaining more armor is most effective against very high damage attacks, and once you go over a certain threshold the amount of reduction you get for your value falls off a cliff hard.
---
To perspective things, for a 100 damage hit you get these damage values against certain armor thresholds
---
50 armor - 64 damage
---
100 - 50
---
200 - 39
---
300 - 33
---
400 - 30
---
500 - 28
---
1000 - 22
---
As you gain armor, you get less and less difference compared to before, going from 0 to 100 armor is about as significant as going from 100 to 700
---
It's when you start going over a 3:1 ratio that the effect really starts killing your benefit from pushing armor values higher, so with \~97% of all enemies dealing 100 damage or less (A level 80 scorchbeast deals 95 with it's strongest attack) going much over 300 isn't all that useful compared to the other things you could be doing instead. Furthermore, all attacks that deal more than 100 damage are melee attacks from rare and powerful monsters, with only two non melee hits going over this threshold. Meaning the blocker perk by itself cutting melee damage by 45% before your armor is calculated makes the most powerful attack in the game only deal 137.5 damage (glowing super mutant behemoth 250 damage heavy melee) So going much over 400 is not necessary with one perk.
---
Vanguard and bolstering are great at low levels where they can push your armor up to the 300 threshold far sooner than you can do any other way, but when you are high level, and have good base armor that already gets to that point the effects are so much less valuable you are better off running almost anything else.
---
A set that is better than full vanguard armor in almost every single situation is 1 of each: ghoul slayer, mutant slayer, hunter, exterminator, troubleshooter. As not only do you get a straight 15% reduction to almost every enemy, but you also get that 15% against enemies that ignore or otherwise don't care about armor (col G, M-king, Assaultrons, ect), AND to top it off the 15% reduces damage before your armor is taken into effect, meaning you effectively get an 18% boost to your armor, meaning for every 200 armor it is like also having an extra vanguard effect at the same time, but no matter what your health is.
---
Seriously, where the hell are my squirrels?
---
Yeah, that happened once for me, never again unfortunately. It doesn't seem very consistent.
---
it was easier at launch when you could get wanted for accidentally sneezing on another player's cow. now in order to become wanted yiu basically have to pick a lock ownes by another player.
---
my best recommendation? join a server with a fried, have them pick a locked door in your camp, and then kill them. repeat with as many friends as you can. and remember to do the same for them if they need it, too! acheivement for achievement is just common courtesy.
---
You can't stop the robots from talking I don't think. You could turn down volumes on settings, think there's on for npc voices

I'm good. Got my private server for the whitespring daily run üòÇ

If I need to take a workshop I always take one that is available, and never owned. 
---
But always follow these rules:
---
1. Drop all junk at my stash
---
2. Remove all armor from character
---
2a. Will wear power armor for say Dabney Homestead which often has fog crawlers around, but that is all. 
---
3. Own and leave, unless I need to build something
---
I figure if someone is going to try and take it, 99% will not be as nice as you, and I rather it give them the satisfaction of gaining anything except the darn workshop
---
always place, never drop.
---
doesnt sound like fun.. 
---
I liked it better when people just used to kill them as they run at the defenses.. 
---
I hate that spawn points and event areas arent better protected from building..
---
people with bases covered in turrets ruin primal cuts during MEAT Week...
---
Sorry you suck at the game,  just because you have trouble dose not mean its a high level or person on a tent, maybe you should work on your build instead of crying on reddit, I'm not afraid of the minions if I die I die not a big deal, its just a game.
---
The beta is out. I'm currently at work and pc is off. I will play about with it tonight. Looks pretty solid but I guess I'll see. Thanks

I think the fireworks feature presents a unique opportunity for a new left hand item that isn't thrown but uses the slot for a buff. Maybe a synth hand or a mutant hand? I was also thinking they should make a new type of left arm armor called a Leftarm, that allows for increased ranged attack blocking. Imagine a power armor leftarm eh? Gigantic
---
Can‚Äôt wait, even though I‚Äôm a mutant and they‚Äôll wanna kill me lol. I‚Äôve loved the BoS since I started playing Fallout 3, would love to join em even though PA is a no go for me atm cuz my carry weight is tied to my gear.

Yeah there are 4 different respawn bugs, the one mentioned here is specifically to do with events glitching out.
---
I think of it more like a solo game with option to play multiplayer and also a multiplayer economy with occasional multiplayer events.
---
It would probably feel more multiplayer if they started some indoor quests ala destiny.
---
Or more of the tunnel escort like events.
---
they get saved to collect water with latter but they disappear from your inventory tho
---
I have only made and eaten corn soup for the last six months.......my farts are terrible.
---
This reminds me of my 2013 trip to Vegas; I had recently replayed through New Vegas before that trip. I was instinctively saving the caps of every beer I was drinking. ü§™
---
We should get bottles too
---
I dunno about public luck but there is a hole with up to 60 balls lying around. Few people been farming there. The trophy cabinets in the clubhouse have quite a lot too. Again dependant on them already being looted.
---
I'm at work but will be on to.orrow morning uk time add me Jaffa_jizz dont mind helping you out
---
It‚Äôs a mess of an idea at this point. They only had value in Fallout 1 because they were backed by the Hub‚Äôs water merchants. FO76‚Äôs garbled ‚ÄòNuka cola promotion, every machine and automated vendor takes caps!‚Äô barely makes sense.
---
Do the dailies, well, daily.
---
:O
---
I found one on a desk in one of the Storerooms in Morgantown for Back on the Beat.
---
Will hope on my private server and have a good scrounge never really picked them up
---
I spent 500 gold for dirt tiles and made a garden so I can craft soup.
---
I gave up because waiting 3-5 seconds between each dirty water was so fucking annoying.
---
Why the fuck can't I just spam the sink/pump or use multiple at a time.
---
Ok..
---
Launched a nuke once, killed a bunch of players but as the circle got smaller it ended in the blasted zone. I had no PA or a hazmat suit and the enemy did and a Tesla gun so I was toast.  
---
Launching or having other launch a nuke in adventure is still so fun, same in NW but more crazy if your in the blast zone at the time. Imagine being in the very middle of the blast zone and just being oh well before you get disintegrated.
---
WAIT THAT WAS ME I THINK
---
Build out by the cabins with the shaking ground and the screams.

Suddenly half or more of his dialogue takes a real sinister turn with those screams added!

Inspirational works whether you are solo in a team or with someone. I have tested this. It's easy to test.
---
Kill something and see how much xp you get. Make a group. kill something see how much xp you get. It multiplies the base xp.
---
I save them for my alts to power level them during 2x / 3x XP weekends: I have assembled a 'kit' composed of handmades and armor pieces starting at level 15. I switch over to the next 'kit' at level 25, then at 35 and finally at 45. Armor is upgraded again at level 50.
---
I scoffed at the sluggishness of fortnightly patches just after launch. Looking back, that now feels like light-speed.
---
ALWAYS DONATE THE REWARD!
---
Because it essentially is. There is nothing that you ever needed a group of players to complete prior to the few daily score things that say join a group, kill this in a group, blah blah blah. 
---
The original trailer showed us being able to build communities but camp restrictions on closeness make that impossible. It also showed that we would need four players to agree on a nuke and location I order to launch it. Once again another fabrication in Bethesda‚Äôs part, as I launched my first nuke at level 56 solo. 
---
Early on other players could do stupid things like destroy camps without cause and follow you around the map if you contested a workshop and still kill you. My first workshop experience was the junkyard and once taken I proceeded to Morgantown, and had some dumb tush follow me there (I was like level 30 and he was 100+) and killed me. I was like really? Hope you enjoy those 4 wood chips a-hole. They have since patched that to prevent it from happening. 
---
So early on, once many of us figured out how dangerous playing with others was, there were other problems that have since been patched since b.e.t.a that I cannot remember, we play solo. Sure we say hi from time to time, or throw up the occasional wave emote, but in actually we can do just fine by ourselves.
---
Actually seems takes a bit longer between levels now, especially if you play solo most of the time.  
---
I‚Äôm At 58 or 59 right now, and IIRC, it‚Äôs 2400 and change score for the next level.
---
Early in the challenge, you could gain a level just by completing one weekly, now it takes 2 weeklys plus a couple of dailys.
---
Every day head to foundation and get the quest from ward , also when you do the overseers quest , do the reader photos and give them to ward , you'll gain respect in no time
---
Please forgive the dumb question, but do you mean the camera you pick up off a tourist or the camera you switch to for photomode?

‚ÄòOn a private server‚Äô would be the key part of your post there.

---
At the level I am I go to every vendor on the map. I start closes to my home and then plot my journey (think settlement routes from fo4) LoL. Caps don‚Äôt mean anything anymore and I could gather enough in a short time of gameplay two fold if not more. 
---
Surprisingly I have found some interesting and rare things, at least in my opinion, from the smaller vendors.
---
OK !!!!
---
The Enclave/BoS war happens earlier, sometime around 2241 (depending on whether it started in 2241 or before the events of Fallout 2). But yeah, I don‚Äôt think the Enclave registers them as foes at this point in time. It also depends whether MODUS is able to contact the other Enclave locations; from what I‚Äôve seen, MODUS lost communications with both Navarro and Raven Rock.
---
Ah ok never knew this , i just gotta go up on level then i get the tiles
---
Pc hacks.
---
Some high-level players still sell stable flux. I‚Äôm always looking for that.
---
I look at misc, I want treasure maps, bobble heads and mags.
---
I made this build over a year ago. The stealth suit wasn't an option then. I had already gathered all the armor and fine tuned this build well before that was an option. Glad the stealth suit works for you, but i love my build setup. It took a lot of planning and hard work to get it to where its at, and I'm not changing it.
---
I play since BETA, but I never know about this... thank you!
---
Bloodied is supposed to be high risk, high reward as well. There's just so much going for it that it's heavily skewed towards reward
---
Easy solution. Find a friend in game. Do not join a team together. Remove all armor. Take out guns and shoot said friend. Let them claim bounty when friend returns. Rinse and repeat. Easy peasy.
---
I want a deathmatch mode so bad.  They tried with the Civil war reenactment area, but nobody ever showed.
---
Do the daily from Ward.  Choose to donate reward = more rep.  
---
Hop around for random encounters.  My go to is slowcum Joe's or freak show ( then run towards the monorail behind where you spawn). Not sure where the others are but worth checking.  
---
Do the daily 'Photo opportunity'.  Select crater, then turn in to ward and don't ask for payment.
---
Do the daily retirement plan.  When meeting with the raiders convince them to join the foundation.
---
Are either of the rep glitches still working?
---
Then what is left for those who play everyday. They would then complain it was to easy. Not everyone gets everything, it just the way the world works. And if you really want it just buy it. It's all cosmetic anyways, not really needed in game.
---
Dang
---
Ah ok , Where‚Äôs slocum joes ? Haven‚Äôt found that yet
---
They're screwcaps.
---
It's not too hard to find people to play with, especially if you share good perks.
---
Yup, it's totally unfair in a competitive game mode!  I can't say how many times I've loaded in next to an orange chest which is already looted and whoever did it long gone.
---
Should I really spend 31 caps fast traveling to a 5 cap bounty? üòÇ Economics man, it just doesn't pay out.
---
Same thing happened to me a couple weeks ago, sorry to hear man. At least you've still got your nuclear keycard so you can still launch one whenever you want!
---
I'm wondering this too.
---
The only plans I sell are the Fixer and Formula P. But I never get any buyers (or visitors, for that matter).  
---
Maybe I should stuff my vendor full of mounted head plans, just to bait people in. That seems to be what everyone else does.
---
Mine is more ill never (hopefully) have the time to give like I did now, I've been furloughed and now job hunting. This was a unique time
---
Vendor trappers?
---
Just a reminder for anyone doing a Jason Voorhees cosplay, he never once used a chainsaw.  A Mr. Handy Buzzblade however would be accurate as he has used a weedwhacker eerily similar to it.
---
I‚Äôd still stick with the trusty machete though.
---
Raider does never heard of a settler can you explain ?
---
Uh what.
---
Yall obviously are to good to be bad at the game right? 
---
Yeah my build may need some work, but I can run legendaries solo.all day. Bloodied gang. 
---
But I feel the same way with dying. But if the queen lands as soon as your feet touch the ground after she wouldnt land for 10 minutes then they are obviously the problem
---
Sorry I dont wana waste 10 fusion cores trying to kill the queen in air when if she lands i can kill her a lot quicker.
---
Have you tried the Fasnacht collectron? If you own it, change your commie one.
---
I do not give you 3 days, and you will cry for the commie collectron ;)
---
That‚Äôs not supposed to happen there.  Did you go inside the capital building?  (Through the DMV entrance?). It specifically says lvl 30+ should enter because there is some late game story content there. But you still need to have solid stuff to deal with the ghouls in there, and the sheer volume of ghouls.
---
Definitely made me lol, thanks
---
They can place smthing that insatta kills you and then steal your loot
---
Yes through the dmv entrance
---
I went through Charleston as level 350 toon and only saw a few level 15 super mutants. So I wish we could have swapped places with u. 
---
Right now the interior of the capital building spawns level 62 if a high level goes through. Which they do. Because of legendary farming 
---
So maybe a high level ran through right before you and the Town spawned ghouls instead of super mutants. Thus making them level 62. If you see again it‚Äôs best to log out and back In and see if they change
---
Charleston does not regularly spawn these high levels on the exterior.
---
I dont remember exactly, I just know there was a settler one too.
---
I always vote for Flatwoods to hopefully get some variety, but 99/100 times it's Morgantown. I guess people like a hot drop. Quick action then onto a new match. 
---
I think Flatwoods has some great action drops too though; Helvetia, Camp Maclintock, Vault-Tec agriculture center, the Creamery and Sutton.
---
agreed, the early scavenge is pivotal to a match.
---
Crater is just puzzling. Wavy Willards is nearby and has pre-existing, intact buildings and fantastic sight lines for snipers at the top of the water-slide. But let‚Äôs settle in this mostly destroyed wreckage which could have any number of problems we can‚Äôt foresee (ruined power source bleeding radiation, experiments they may have been running while in orbit, etc.)
---
Given how swiftly it was possible to level up during double XP a level 100 could very probably be a noob too.
---
Well let me know if you find it out , gotta get these farming tiles
---
Hm ill see if going to a new server fixes it
---
Yeah supposedly a bug that's been happening for a while now, a lot of high levels now farm the capitol building because of it. Someone else can comment when it started happening, but I don't think was always the case but has been for sometime now I believe.
---
Thanks for covering #7 on the list. To prevent me from commenting what I hate, but had to drop a comment anyways.
---
If you're talking about inside the capital building, those ghouls are always max level (at least in my experience).
---
If you're talking about around the location in general, it's probably because a high level player ran through there recently and triggered all the spawns to also be high level. Try server hopping to get around this.
---
Mate, if someone's selling a shotty with bash for 1.5k, you buy that mofo.
---
Yeah you have 2 options,  get something OP as hell and loud and mow them all down or stealth it up and use a silencer to make your way through.  Getting detected there is never fun as there is like a minimum of 40 lvl 60+ ghouls that spawn in there.
---
Don't think people are actually doing it for financial gain...
---
I might just have a day collecting the map üò•
---
Same.  I would try looking on YouTube.  The other option I like is just build your camp on a flat tract of land and leave holes in the center to plant stuff.
---
I'm not normally a Grammar Nazi but this post makes me weep for the death of the English language.

Why, sry for askin

You won‚Äôt have that problem at all actually the community is very helpful and it‚Äôs very hard for someone to grief you it‚Äôs actually a lot more work then it‚Äôs worth
---
Jason wears a hockey mask, if you really want to use the chainsaw properly you've gotta find yourself a sack hood.
---
It‚Äôs not like either one of us could come back in ‚Äúforever‚Äù. Would be impossible. So I guess I should rephrase to..‚Äùwill live on until the next fallout/Skyrim is released‚Äù. So we can both agree that you will be able to come back and prove me wrong before then.
---
Gta players get banned all day long. Yet still most popular online. I‚Äôm sure u will find an apples to oranges comparison there as well.
---
FO76 is one of the most wonderful communities I‚Äôve ever been apart of. Sure you‚Äôll come across some trolls here and there, but 9/10 people who play are great!
---
They are not always max level (though they are 95% of the time) and max levels should never spawn outside,  never seen it in 1500+ hours and I‚Äôm there frequently.
---
I‚Äôll check right now
---
It's a kind of magic...
---
If you're still looking, I find them often on the bunk beds in the church at Harper's Ferry.
---
Exactly. Because it doesn't work. I will usually go if it's a low level player that possibly made an error. I remove the bounty, drop scrip and get on about my way.
---
You are more likely to find high level players that will give you gear than ones that will bother you. Just stay away from workshops, turn pacifist on, and you'll be fine
---
Is this really true?
---
No buffs for turrets but placing them above ground level and facing out of an empty doorway and having the path to them blocked is the best you can do. Those who think turrets are useless clearly are not using them well.
---
#7 haha keep your chin up
---
Like insatgating on minigun?
---
I can solo a silo, I'm not bloodied I run full health junkies, the queen is not difficult wether shes in the air or on the ground, before tents everyone stood on the fence, people need to just realize everyone is going to play the way they choose and nobody else has a right to tell them they are not playing correctly because its not the way they want it played.
---
Ok so Fallout 4 and Skyrim are single player games which are not monetized in the same way as online games so cannot be used as examples here.
---
Now with ESO, yes there are way more cosmetics available in the game. 
---
However, they don't make their money off of only the optional sub and one time cosmetic purchases.  They rake in an insane amount of money from selling player houses as well as the furniture as opposed to this game which sells the furniture.  Many of the ESO houses are well over 100 dollars.  They also have the crown (scam) crates which generates even more income for them by selling mounts that have a .1% drop rate and getting people to spend thousands of dollars on them to get the one they want.
---
So yeah, ESO can afford to provide more earn-able cosmetics in game because they have many other ways to generate revenue. 
---
As far as content goes?  I mean, yeah they have way more if you count the trials and dungeons but that game is an actual MMO.  This is unfortunately a hybrid game made for both multiplayer and solo play which means it is average in both areas and excels in none.  I wish they wouldve made this game more like a hardcore MMO it would've been even better.  But then the solo-only food builds would get upset.
---
I paid $12 for this game when it was on sale on Amazon.  Insane value for my money.
---
Can't disagree there, ran into other issues where it shows my main and alt account offline to each other after a server hop.
---
Im at 72/76. Been playing since beta haha
---
Multiple people have said this, I'll have to check it out. Thanks!
---
I don't need story content. I just want the gameplay to be fixed, the existing quests cleaned up and the bugs dealt with.
---
Wastelanders was a textbook example of having too big of a scope for a content update. Everything felt half implemented and suffered because the team was pulled in so many directions.
---
East of the wayward.  Not too far down the road
---
Cheaters just got dissed by Father Brown
---
While I agree, I do feel like this trend started in Fallout 4. That game had a huge map with, at best, content that could‚Äôve filled around half of it. 
---
It‚Äôs like with every new Fallout title they have to say ‚Äòmap is x times bigger!‚Äô even if that only means diminishing returns.
---
Don't expect me to sell magic weapons for an egg. If you want one, you gotta pay. Same goes for the sniping shotguns.
---
One way is knowing exactly where everyone is.  On one match I had, their last target was someone hiding in the water by the Grafton Dam.  They just fired a few times into the water and the match ended.
---
Stops working once the enemies turn into meat piles.
---
One spawns inside the shed behind the Ranger district office. There are supposed to be other spawns but I find that one the most reliable.
---
That's great to know.  TY

Worse, Q FFR FR Tesla. I‚Äôm a relentless raider.
---
Lol.  I was a noob a few months back and claimed my first workshop.  Maybe level 10?  I didn‚Äôt understand PVP or much about the new things in FO76 from prior games.  I heard a voice shout, ‚Äúthere you are!‚Äù And got obliterated with some melee weapon.  As I lay there staring at myself third person, I see someone in a sheepsquatch mask lean over me and cannibalizes my body.  I had no idea what any of this was but was LMAO at it all.  Fun experience.
---
For perspective I'm 300 levels and a year into the game and I've been harassed/griefed 3 whole times.
---
Thank you I‚Äôll start hopping there now
---
Is there any quest or anything in Wastelanders that explains what the flying alien looking creatures are, gloaters or whageverWhy the hell did they just appear?
---
Went to one the other day, they had signs up that said "legendary available" on one side of the door and "no uglies" on the other. Not sure if that was a joke or not lol
---
Found around 300 scrip worth of legendaries once in ice box in front of Purveyor. Don't know who put it there, but I want to thank them for helping me get couple days worth of modules.  so much needed for chasing those perfect rolls.
---
Makes ya wonder how we consume magazines and Bobbleheads üòÇ
---
That as well, seeing friends offline very annoying.
---
If a higher level player goes through an area creatures can spawn at their level. Next time just try swapping servers, sneaking, or sprinting past them if you can.
---
If the firerrate is around 200, and primary is Instigating, Junkies, Medic, or Stalker. Or the secondary is +33%vats, 50% limbdamage, or bashing damage.
---
Then yes.
---
*Good, you're not a flake. I'm impressed*

Pipe pistols, pipe rifles.  Pipes.  There is cork in those pipes my friend.  Farm out pipe weapons and scrap for cork!

I put all unusable plans and bullets in my vendors for free 
---
Needless to say they don‚Äôt stay long
---
I almost always have one in my vendor cheap.
---
I highly doubt they will. And even if they do, the wait time for the content is far too long in between.
---
Kill me i sold a stallker lmg today F
---
For sure it is hilarious,  I always chuckle at myself for doing it to,  like lol let me waste my time,  ammo, and more caps for less caps and to see player go boom,  not to mention having to race everyone else on the server there.  It‚Äôs a ridiculous scenario.
---
I drank my dog and got cat hair
---
No you arent going crazy, definitely happens to me fairly frequently. Especially when I‚Äôm crouched, usually start hearing a little ding, kinda like one of those music triangles being hit
---
8. People who complain about what OTHERS do and think they should only play a certain way when playing THEIR OWN game. 
---
It‚Äôs not your game and people have every right to do whatever they want. If you are concerned about what is for sale, stop going to player vendors and only visit Whitesprings. Easy solution that would allow you to avoid all ‚Äúproblems‚Äù on your list.

Yeah except i get a banjo ding ding ding

So....how do they taste?

There are recipes for each region so you can find ingredients and make them no matter where you are. The recipes say (Forest) (Mire) etc. but when crafted they all just become "Disease Cure." They're very easy to make, one five minute ish run can get me like 12 disease cures in the forest.

Would be amazing to have new content every patch.. Ahh.. Come on Bethesda give us dungeons and more vaults with plethra of monsters

Just had a protectron attack the settler and he died so gonna keep hopping

Oh freaking duh, I can't believe I never thought of that myself! Thanks OP!

Now, if we could just get corpse highlight perk cards like in 4...

Ah cool, thanks. But another item was Ultracite armor plan. I can‚Äôt even see it in the crafting workshop. What gives?

I like to brows camps and vendors when in bored
---
H: Trading Post on wrong subreddit W: you to try a dedicated subreddit for these things.
---
&gt;Once again another fabrication in Bethesda‚Äôs part, as I launched my first nuke at level 56 solo.
---
Well, to be fair, the average player who isn't following any particular build probably can't.
---
Heavy mg turrets should be all youll ever need. Careful tho cuz they take up alot of camp budget, i usually have just 4 max in good spots.
---
Had a guy just add a BE15 fixer in a trade the other day because he thought it was fair,  I‚Äôll remember that and probably never trade it because of what it means to me,  I have some other pieces like that.  95% of this community is incredible.
---
Yeah yeah, of course.
---
I didn‚Äôt know it was a mod.
---
But another item was Ultracite armour. I can‚Äôt even see it in the workshop. Why‚Äòs this?
---
Wait, what, really? I thought those were specific to curing diseases in those regions. Thanks!
---
I will look into that. I keep my camp in the north easter area of cranberry bog. That way I have a free fast travel to any nukes or SBQ fighting. I got rid of all my turrets, because the casual mobs there are lvl 40-50 and they were not doing shit to defend. They actually attracted more trouble, then started to shoot my own camp stuff to death. Now I just have a companion there, and I guess they are dealing with whatever attacks, because I almost never have to repair anything anymore.
---
If thats true, that makes sense.
---
thanks.
---
Way to re-construct the narrative to suit your argument. Of course Bethesda, the company most known for their sprawling open world games would continue to support their most recent open world title up to the release of a new one. But there's no chance fo76 will continue to be profitable and get the same equivalent of support and new content over 6+ years as a game such as eso has received. And yeah you're correct, comparing fo76 to gtaV/GTA online is incredibly laughable and not even on the same plane of existence. GTA online is a golden apple to fo76's worn out pair of new balance shoes at your local thrift store.
---
I thought the whole 9 dailies thing was supposed to stay until the end of the run?
---
The 20-plus years of software development experience in me says it may have gone down like this:
---
- bug report: some players never finish loading, causing matches to hang for everyone 
---
- developer: hmm.. (removes waitForEveryone hook)
---
- project manager: bug smashed! Matches will load no longer hang when players fail to load.
---
- nobody: What about the players failing to load? Was it a crash? Race condition in player disconnect code? Server issue with counting number of wait handles and number of ready clients?
---
And so it goes.
---
A mutual bank like in ESO would be badass
---
Did you try to turn it off and on again?
---
No really, I have the typical 9 dailies
---
Apparently a mod. But Ultracite armour IS a piece of armor, and I can‚Äôt see it either.
---
Same. I even told the person who‚Äôs camp I was at to follow me, and showed them in case they didn‚Äôt know. They just used the ??? Emote so I think they got it? Lol
---
There's like 4 or 5 recipes for Disease Cure which are easy enough to find, each using ingredients found in an area of the map. Ex: One that uses ingredients found in the forest area, one other that uses ingredients found in the mire area, ect
---
My experience has been (currently lvl 52) that the first time you ever enter a new place, especially something large like the capitol building, the number and difficulty of the mobs is more intense than it‚Äôll ever be on any return trip to the same location.
---
When I‚Äôve had it show up like this, it meant the other 4 challenges eventually showed up autocompleted.
---
This is why they need to make more dynamic and procedural content. Stuff like that tends to make games last longer.
---
walk 10 meters away from a cursed spot and ft wherever u want. if there an enemy nearby u should walk further.
---
Fallout 76 has fallout 1st which gives you almost nothing of value per month aside from the increased scrap storage; ¬£10 a month for this is quite silly and considering how many people use this it certainly gives them a profitable income per month that more than covers server costs when combined with atomic shop income.
---
Not true in the lower level parts of the world like this,  where he is at that should not be happening outside, some areas have max level caps the enemies can spawn at,  most you should deal with around where he was at outside is a lvl 14 snally
---
It‚Äôs a mix of people killing new players and people helping. In my experience you‚Äôve got a 50/50 shot of either
---
You can also get some by convincing the raider to go to Foundation instead of killing them for Roxsy
---
I've been eating canned dog food since release, as an homage to Mad Max. In my mind it's Dinki Di branded dog food.   
---
I do occasionally eat other foods I cook up if I have reached my vendor cap limit, but when exploring I will eat and drink anything edible I come across that isn't in a container. Scaving is hard work, and the Wasteland provides
---
I got 9 but 1 is auto completed
---
Seems pretty random sadly
---
Oh s my bad
---
Cool! I'd your on this afternoon I'll buy some from ya?
---
‚ÄúCome back 1 year!!!‚Äù
---
It seems like a newer/recent problem too. Like i probably started noticing it like 2 weeks ago.
---
Really, I thought it would prevent you from joining the same server of that person in the future?
---
wtf, they still haven't added this? I haven't played since Wastelanders launched but I always thought they would add it in the first update after Wastelanders
---
I‚Äôve had it for months
---
I mean that can be annoying but there are paths around it, if you learn the map its not too much of a problem
---
Serendipity doesn't work in pa, adrenaline is bugged and isn't working at all rn, why are you using gun fu?
---
I still think we don't need a separate buff for this.
---
Beth should give us receivers with burst capability and place it in the rifleman category.
---
Right. Just not worth it, and up until now the bounty system was actually hyper exploitable too. I stopped bounties after my team mates kept asking for help in a 4:1 PvP as it was just a trap. The bounties' whole team was waiting for the fight. Now with PvP initiation changed, it's horribly painful to attempt team PvP. "Hit me first", "No, you hit me first". No thanks.

---
Do you hold lots of chems on your character like stim packs and rad away?
---
hiii I can do this for you
---
Thanks for your advice. Where are the heavy combat armor plans? And what‚Äôs the BOS? Sorry for ignorance, I am a noob after all =)
---
I had an abnormally long load the other day and by the time I had loaded in, more than half of the for the first ring contraction had passed.
---
Next time team up wth them during, place the Punji boards, spring traps, pre blueprints flame throwers &amp; rad traps EVERYWHERE, then leave.  That's how you get em squirming.
---
Now here‚Äôs a fella that likes his corpse juice.
---
The Ultracite Armor is probably power armor. So it'll only show up on a power armor bench.
---
Hi, thank you so much!!! Whats your GT?
---
That‚Äôs not a cheat, if you unlock a NW loot terminal you can see the location of other players for a short time
---
Yea that seems fair , I‚Äôm not trade specialist but still seems good for 1k
---
Nope, it does nothing at all! All it does is stop you from fighting them, but doesn't do anything to stop them hurting you or stop the game from matching servers.
---
I'm still annoyed about missing the mask. It's to much trouble trying to get it and give it to my main. Since there is no item swapping between characters.
---
I got five as well today...don't relogin or it will auto complete them!! Had that happen the other day as well smh.
---
Refractor sucks, iron clad and blocker don't work in power armor, and power user isn't needed. Field surgeon is great though
---
Is there anything better than raw abestos?
---
Same here
---
This are really noobish traps. It doesn't insta kill, it takes off half health then if you wait around it'll kill on the second hit. I had a level 500 do that to me recently and was disappointed at how bad it is. His chair trap was the same. Maybe they capped damage a stack can do at once. Anyways you can go to map and tp before the second hit. The real traps take some logic to put together.
---
That cork is about to be hot.
---
I saw a video where a guy uses 100 of them to take down a scorchbeast? How did he do that if they take up so much space?? Genuinely curious.
---
I‚Äòd buy that for 1k. Totally fine imo
---
It‚Äôs worth noting that a recent patch basically removed every remaining griefing method in the game:
---
https://youtu.be/TbeiwJFdaso
---
Anything killed should share his loot with the rest of things you kill in a decent radius so you clean radiation rumble in one shot, not saying it's hard to loot, but looting such event quickly become a pain.
---
Blame the awkward handshake that is PVP.  They want you to come back and attack them while they chameleon crouch and jump up and down with broken ass SA Armor.  If someone walks into your workshop even without trying to claim it and they are not on your team you should be able to blow that fucker away the second they take one step in the zone.  I hate that ‚Äúwill they won‚Äôt they ‚Äúcrap, better believe the second you open that pipboy your dead AF
---
Same, and I sell all my extra plans at super cheap. Or free if they end up being common, or dropping them if they happen to be SUPER common.
---
Which I disagree. Just look at chernobyl.
---
It looks like you underpaid. If it is what I think it is, it can go for 6,000-12,000.
---
Gt is xQueenpotato, what‚Äôs yours?
---
I'm level 231 and actually helped someone at the waste disposal site. I just needed to do my daily challenges yesterday.
---
Your build has too much in endurance. Endurance is really not very useful because per rank it doesn‚Äôt really add much health. Your better off not investing too much in it. And I don‚Äôt feel that you that much in luck, ricochet is a low percentage and serendipity doesn‚Äôt work in power armor.
---
As a build w/ 15 strength, I find a build that can utilize all strength weapons more fun. I can use all melee weapons, heavy guns, and shotguns. And it‚Äôs much more fun, because you aren‚Äôt locked into a specific build and weapon type.
---
However, this kind of build will take MANY level ups to be complete because you need so many different cards:
---
My build in case you were interested:
---
STR: 15. Makes the build. I use a chemist backpack so I don‚Äôt have to use traveling pharmacy. Also make sure to use bandolier.
---
PER: 5. Slot in rank 3 scattershot and rank 2 concentrated Fire when shotguns. To be fair, perception really in my build is sone wasted points maybe I‚Äôll take out 1 point.
---
END: 2. Rejuvenated is really good. The AP regen and disease resistance is useful.
---
CHR: 3. Three points is just enough to share a card. I just slot in useful cards based on the situation (Suppressor, Lone Wanderer, Travel Agent, Etc.)
---
INT: 8. I have 8 in intelligence so I can run Nerd Rage w/ either gunsmith or makeshift warrior and I add in stabilized if I want to be a heavy gunner power armor user.  Take some points out of AGI/ PER if you want to run Batteries Included 
---
AGI: 15. You don‚Äôt really need this much in Agility. I also like the ability to run sneak melee build so I have a lot here. Just make sure to slot in Enforcer when running shotguns.
---
LUCK: 8. Just enough to be able to have mutations and to slot in Serindipity/ Bloody Mess/ One Gun Army
---
Well, like Moe and his Swatters, it's fair play to assume history got garbled along the way. üòÇ
---
I think Splatterhouse may have also merged the two monsters together like that.
---
Nice cork bro
---
I wish they would add a component where you could repair and drive an automobile. Running down some feral ghouls would be cool.
---
Oh, i know you already! LOL you helped me with my marsupial serums!
---
&gt;clowndaddy intensifies
---
More like scrawled on a wall in chop.
---
Ah this has just happened to me, all but one daily is completed :(   
---
That's 2k score i'm not getting =/
---
Just messaged you
---
It was an easy fix....make it so if your on the team and in pacifist mode you don‚Äôt get brought into the PVP,  you should always have expected a 4v1 and be pleased when you didnt.  Now poosies just have their friends hide and spot for them, luckily they‚Äôre usually all complete trash.
---
How can you tell if someone has a bounty before attacking them? The other day I attacked someone at random it said there was  a 50 cap reward for killing them but I didn't know that prior
---
Its a power armor limb you need a power chassis and a power armor workbench
---
Gosh, you're like the worst superhero ever.  XD.
---
I can solo a silo easily. Its the fact that your wasting time standing on there. Why do yoy wana shoot a moving target for 10 minutes instead of getting it over and done with?
---
All but 1 of mine is auto completed :( got no score for any of them
---
Agreed. it did indeed fix it! Thank you so much again. I have googled my eyes out trying to fix this.
---
Yeah everyone knows why, thats why we see this post 100 times a day.
---
That‚Äôs a high level quest. It warns you when you enter the building.
---
Who said im a Hero ? More like a sadistic villain who pretends to care about all these puny settlers and raiders
---
That‚Äôs an entirely different situation. Radiation? Yes, they got that. But not (multiple) nuclear explosions.
---
I love Moe so much that I'm sold on this take of it 100%. I wish allies would hold weapons you give them, I actually wanted to make Gramps into a proper Moe one time.
---
Doesn't "seem."  It is.  The amount of score needed to rank goes up +25 with every rank, and once you escape the threshold where the Dailies alone can do it (near where you are), the slowdown is palpable.
---
I shoot her wherever shes at, the longer it takes the more mobs you get, there us more to the event than just kill in the queen.
---
Actually I like to run silos for the servers I farm keycards at the camp in the bog, run all 3 for everyone. Its the fact that your gonna waste time and many peopels ammo especially if low lvls are there.
---
New players dont understand game mechanics.
---
PvP exists? Better attack every player I see, because I can win!
---
 Probably a bunch of children from GTA or something.
---
... alright mate
---
They messaged me calling me a hacker because I one-hit them
---
? I was able to find lvl15 parts for mine
---
My charisma is too low to share the really good stuff. But I‚Äôm good for travel agent if you are looking to port on the cheap.
---
I'm Rank 93, and let me tell ya: you ain't missing out on much.  Nearly all the rewards are flawed in one way or another, and most I'll never use.
---
Frankly, I'd rather have the Atoms that Dailies/Weeklies used to give out.
---
Level 69? Nice
---
I had some level 5 or something hitting me with a board while i was dropping stuff for them. They stopped hitting me to look in the bag. Picked everything up... and the started hitting me again. Like. Can you not.
---
Log out and back in
---
https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/daily.html
---
I don't see how you one hit them if damage is capped around 110, but I suppose its possible with 0 armor. But they get what they deserve.
---
I must be bugged. After I posted this I tried again and the menu didn't even come up. A couple minutes later the menu randomly popped up and I was able to scroll with the joystick. Turned out I needed a razorgrain that on a separate note, needs repairing every time I log in. Separate bug I'm assuming
---
That's what I call ghouls
---
This is the first I'm hearing that the Canned Meat Stew being given out to the whole server instance was an unintended "bug" and patched out.
---
What the hell, Todd.
---
It‚Äôs true. At least that is what is listed at level 100 on the map
---
I like this explanation thank you.
---
I spammed a little from frustration so it was probably two or three hits. The poor sap was just wearing their vault suit(which is kinda weird considering they were level 7)
---
I just stood there and pulled the knife, they shot again and I just went ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wanna do this *shank* ‚Äú
---
Yeah. I was hoping that it was just because they were busy working on wastelanders, but nope. Same schedule of one update every 1-2 months even after wastelanders
---
Oh no! That was a reward from Survival Mode.  I don't know if that event will come back but if so, I hope you get that gun again.
---
My first silver. Im not sure what silver does but thank you.
---
Yeah, and I just looked at the Seasons page at  [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons) and noticed the atoms are not listed as a reward.
---
Moo, I'm sick at the moment. Can bately stay awake ü§ßü§Æüò∑
---
I've been getting a random sound as well, but it's more like a drinking sound or bottle opening.
---
On ps4 next to the treehouse village?
---
I feel like I still find squirrel in Helvetia and strewn about in the forest regions. Maybe try there?
---
Log out and back in again and the rest should show up.
---
lol. I have the same thing, will try the other guy's logout suggestion.
---
Where do I find that
---
Same, but after relaunching the missing show up as auto completed.
---
I've heard it's possible to get it as possibly as an event reward, but it is for sale from the Raider vendor in Whitespring, and one in Watoga.
---
It‚Äôs a bug that happens sometimes
---
Great tip!! I've wished we had something that highlighted dead bodies the same way berry mentats highlights living ones. This is a good workaround.
---
W......was that a legend of korra reference?
---
&gt;I don't consider going into photo mode, building 5 plants and killing 10  scorched to be grind.  It's literally seconds of effort.
---
Leveling up every day is not "seconds of effort."
---
Nor is hitting that Repeatable XP challenge.  Someone can crunch the numbers, but before Bethesda decided to add more Dailies, the expectation was that you had to hit that challenge several hundred times, because Dailies/Weeklies alone didn't come close to finishing the board.
---
Sure, Bethesda changed some stuff.  They added more Dailies and they have another High SCORE event down the road, partly to cover for their failure to fix the autocomplete bug.  But we didn't know that at the time.
---
Oh god im so sorry haha.
---
If someone offers you Vintage Nukashine. Drink it as it gives 100% melee damage bonus.
---
Sounds like a good problem to have lol, I gotta check my steam today I guess
---
I have the same problem. I had the same idea, just tried it. And when i logged in it gave me 9 challenges but showed them as completed. No S.C.O.R.E for me today i guess.
---
Me and my wife got 9
---
It‚Äôs strange at first now it‚Äôs meh
---
Same, relaunched to find the missing ones had been auto completed.
---
The problem I have is ALL the grinds in the game. I‚Äôve come to realize that is the endgame. How many grinds can we put in the game until we drive the players away.
---
I've seen others say this happened when they are on their private server, if that's the case, then hop over to adventure and see if it resets them
---
Julie is the DJ for Appalachia radio
---
My friend and i used to just have fun PvP at workshops where we'd just be annoying enough with mines, nades and chameleon armor. A mild inconvenience if you will. Kinda miss it.
---
Dog food has had a spot on my quick wheel next to purified water since launch as well!
---
If you take a drink you can spam it while it's doing the animation and get more quickly
---
I had it a while ago and relogged to have them come back not completed, I had done some in the meantime so missed out on the 5/5 daily's one as they didn't count while it wasn't visible. 
---
Pot luck I guess, which is a sorry state of affairs after so long. Especially as the issue was meant to be patched out already.
---
No it was just referencing the Alexa play despacio meme. Julie is the DJ for Appalachia radio
---
Yeah, most people tend to share good tier 1 perks.  I tend to share scrapper or whatever.
---
I think the camo on the arms cover up some of the view in 1st person.

---
How can you fit 18 corn on one tile? I'm struggling to get 9 lol
---
Its there, If you relaunch the game you will see them auto completed.
---
This makes it difficult for people to complain about having to drop Atoms on the run, because yes, they give us a fair amount of Atoms along the way. Pretty cool I thought.
---
Solo public teams can get an XP buff from other things like herd mentality. But, inspirational needs others on the team.
---
This. Always make sure to paper your walls before you place anything on either side of them!
---
Haha! Save it for the atlas event soon!
---
Yeah he plays.. You get them time to time if you're farming bullion. I gave a backpack plan to my friend. Have so many 200mm lenses too and had another casual shielded drop from queen of the hunt. Formula p stacks up too.
---
*looks at the hunter‚Äôs pump-action shotgun with extra bashing damage I have on sale for 1.5k rn* yeah me too

Or move items off of your walls then back again!

I had the exact same ones as well.

I logged out and back in, and sadly I have this new list ...
---
[https://i.ibb.co/9gT0K46/Capture2.png](https://i.ibb.co/9gT0K46/Capture2.png)  
---
Notice, all the 'completed' challenges ... I did not do any of them.
---
And, I got no new score for these so called 'completed'
---
This game sucks dick!üñï
---
Yes.  Everyone knows about the terrible score bug blight.  Can people stop posting about it?  The same post a million times here won't help.
---
Only interested in plans. Most of the time it's a bust but I'm still looking for a handful of pretty rare event or quest exclusive ones. Don't feel like dealing with the dupers on the sub that shan't be named so I'm taking my chances with randoms
---
My sweet spot is somewhere around 50-200. Any less and it's likely not worth it, any more and it's usually some idiot selling hundreds of mounted heads, food recipes, and mole miner gauntlets
---
RIP to the players with carnivore mutation
---
what level is it?
---
They're basically a random spawn at fixed spawn points.  Random in that those spawn points pick from a pool of critters - foxes, rabbits, beavers, radstags, squirrels, frogs, fireflies, chickens, and opossums.  So aside from the ones at Whitesprings (which seem to be guaranteed spawns), it's a crapshoot if you'll find squirrels at the spawnpoints in the Forest.
---
Example: I hit up six different spawn points in the Forest today.  Every single one was Radstags.  At least I finally got the Butcher's Bounty card which makes farming them to make Squirrel Stew a bit more tolerable.
---
Yea that page isn‚Äôt 100% accurate. A few rewards are in the wrong order.
---
I started way after its release.  I'll have to either not finish it or buy levels with atoms, but it's my fault, if you start when it starts you should be fine.
---
I wonder if you tried completing one of the dailies that you should have but don't, would still award you score? Complete an event or buy 3 items from another player and see if that does anything?
---
 [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/589](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/589)
---
This is the real thing.  The Season system reduces the already tenuous gameplay of 76 to something that has the player on mindless autopilot, as you beeline from one high-level dungeon to the next, speedrunning and popping heads before the enemies even know you're there.  Rinse, repeat.
---
It really does cheapen the whole game by putting a giant spotlight on its repetition, and if this was the first and last Season 76 had, you would hear absolutely zero complaints from me.
---
Well, I've noticed in this game if something's supposed to be fixed there's a good chance it'll stay fixed for a few days at best.
---
I change weapons depending on where I am/what I‚Äôm likely to face.  
---
My goto is a vampire switchblade.
---
Whitesprings: FSS Ghouls slayers switchblade
---
Sniping: Suppressors Explosive Lever
---
Any place in divide or eastward with lots of robots, vertibots and cargobots: Troubleshooters gatling.  West side robots get an instigating 10mm; I am still working on the kill 1k robots with a pistol. 
---
SBs: Zealots gatling plasma.
---
Anything else: FSS hunters Bowie or Vampire 50 
---
Just for fun: AllStar Whiffle Bat.
---
For those keeping tabs, we are at:

3- doesn‚Äôt work

2- it works

Wow.  Apparently today was a good day to go on vacation and miss the score challenges all together.

It is rather painful to read through üòñ

excellent price
---
I'm 400 now and I had a level 22 come up and beg for my scout mask. He was wearing a red Asylum dress. No goodies for him, he can handle it on his own. That dress says I'm not new here.
---
they just showed upped auto completed
---
Start thinking about your endgame build now. I highly recommend bloodied. Glass cannon forever
---
I bought 25 tiers that i saved with my fo1st atoms and im like tier 97 but i grinded ALOT
---
Yes but I accidentally chose not to
---
I've heard fast movement speeds cause problems with fo76.
---
23 here, reporting in.
---
It's become a staple in my builds just because I like unloading weapons with the auto switching in vats. It's my preference with hoards
---
I started on season launch. Haven't been at it too hard by any means, but doing daily challenges, weekly etc. I've purchased 2 levels so far because I wanted the raider cage tree and firefly lights NOW(then)! Around level 73, so it's doable.
---
Haha except on the odd chance he went there first go and found it! But maybe its just a mule but it seems odd because if I had a mule I wouldn't beg anyone for relatively worthless junk. Maybe he really did get lucky.
---
I've never seen players killing players as a norm. Very very rare instances, primarily at workshops if at all. But rare.
---
For a minigun I feel like you dont really need it.
---
There's a mask?
---
I try not to but I always end up looking at my pip boy to find I have like 100+ -_-
---
I guess I need for someone to explain how you can not always be over encumbered with caps, script, weight, and everything.  By level 5 the only thing you are short on is perk cards and experience now with the public BUILDING teams. You can level so fast and constantly get caps from teammates completing quests. Extra loot from public events. 
---
Seriously, if you are broke get on a BUILDING team and play the events and do your daylies. Except for maybe the SCORCHED EARTH. There is really something wrong with that event now at least 30% of the time ..
---
Help me understand guys, you should be rich and I want to help üôÇ
---
Exactly.  You can do it, all you need is an 1hr a day.
---
It's "something to do," is what it is.  When the actual new content is minimal to non-existent, you cling to what you can get if you still want to play with friends.
---
Well, I wouldn't say 5 minutes, but it would be pretty gosh darned quick, within a few workdays, if not just a single one. Point is still made
---
This is a glitch
---
I wish chainsaws went above level 15.
---
So monthly update isn‚Äôt good enough for ya?!  Not even world of Warcraft does this many update
---
Depends what recipes you have tatos are basically the most common just mix with some random ingredients
---
Heard. I've been so used to a sneak 2h melee, when I need to get through ghouls I just let vats take over and I start swinging. So serendipity doesnt work in PA? Am I stupid and didn't read the perk card lol
---
My favorite Nuclear Winter bug is the power armor being invisible for some people.  Several times my wife and I have played and seen power armor the other could not.  The armor becomes visible when someone else enters it, but getting them to get out is another story lol.
---
i have gotten some fairly rareish plans from this
---
Did you Play NW?
---
A kojima fan who also likes 76? Noice. üòé
---
Also the frathouse jazz.
---
I doubt he would be wearing it as it's anything but good looking. You wear that because you know it's rare. Just my take, and I'm not sure I would toss scout mask into worthless junk category. As I have traded those for some nice legacies. They were common place at one point but now they only drop with the SD bundle at .025%. I'm not 100% on those odds as I haven't had my coffee yet.
---
I don't know.  I think it might not say it on the perk card.  I use dodgy in agility instead.  Emergency protocols is great as well, that's a mod on pa chest.
---
darn. I just wanted to increase thier rep as much as possible before the chains were done. sided with the Settlers in the end but took all the Gold. lmao. maxed both thier reps out few weeks ago
---
Yeah, I saw that it was a fairly good find. It‚Äôs definitely worth going out of the way to grab this quick stash if you‚Äôre just roaming.
---
Oh man, I forgot about that. Wish they'd bring it back, and limit it to black powder weapons (if it wasn't, I never tried it despite playing since the beta).
---
They could even make it a PvE event with human NPCs on one side.
---
and then shoot them
---
*scorched girls
---
Gourd is good for cranberry relish.
---
It's most people don't know how to run it. Rifleman is good with the right gear. Instigating is what it was made for
---
That just happened to me today - not enough items to put in the hopper.
---
I was the *only* person doing the event - no one else was there. I get down to the last two I have to find. I watched one disappear right in front of my eyes. It just vanished. 
---
Then for the remaining 15 minutes I ran around like a fool trying to find the last two. Never found them. Eventually about four other people showed up and they all looked. Found nothing. 
---
And the event failed. I had never seen that before.
---
Depends on the mutations you have if you have herbivore or carnivore then there are a lot of good recipes you can get.
---
My herbivore lives on razor grain soup and corn soup with a brain bomb chaser and cranberry relish on the side.
---
Everything else gets sold.
---
My carnivore has soft shell mirelurk meat, broiled scorchbeast brains and glowing meat steaks..
---
Herbivore is much easier to manage especially with farmable tiles
---
I have found that if you go ahead and stay on world, it usually pops up anyhow. Happens to me at the submerged acid pit near PV Ski Resort and Mirelurk spawn at WS.
---
There are clearly issues with the systems that need radio vacuum tubes. I gotta replace like 12 a week
---
I‚Äôve found that the newer(?) low level players are the ones that tend to pick the fights.  If you ignore them though they can‚Äôt really harm you unless at a workshop.  I actually had a higher level player ‚Äústeal‚Äù one of my workshops but when I went there to scout and possibly reclaim he didn‚Äôt kill me an rather ended up joining my party for a bit and let me have all the resources as he didn‚Äôt really need anything and was just doing it for something to do.
---
16 here, I get it.
---
Make sure pacifist mode is on.
---
Are the 237 plans all mounted heads? Lol. I tend to avoid camps with a huge number of plans because they're all just mounted heads. I don't what happened when I stopped playing in 2019, but I came back to a flood of the same plans everywhere. Do they sell? Why don't they just drop them in a suitcase to get rid of them?
---
I second the Mire camps. Have had some luck there with 1-2 weapons and no one else bothers to visit.
---
I‚Äôve seen it quite often in my experience which is why I said 50/50

I have dumb question, I picked the raiders to raid the vault but haven‚Äôt started the quest can I still go level up foundation? Even after the warning it gives once you pick the raider quest saying foundation won‚Äôt be playable after choosing?
---
"Is it a glitch or a feature?"  
---
Todd: "Yes".
---
There's a decent chance for it to spawn at the blocked rail road tunnel east of harpers ferry. Spawns on the floor of a train car
---
It‚Äôs still being tested on the pts
---
Not that often, mostly just to complete any daily or weekly challenges.
---
Clown Daddy/Sky Humper... same dude. Brilliance on PC!
---
This all comes down to Bethesda thinking grinding is end game and some developer whose bonus is tied to daily logins. This is nothing more than another monetization scheme by Bethesda. They aren't adding content to make the game enjoyable, they are adding content to make you login every day. The biggest trap of the score is people being suckered into buying atoms to level up because of FOMO. The game has evolved to nothing more than an overblown mobile game. Let the downvotes commence.
---
Thats a good point. I don't always wear my red asylum but I do sometimes just to show it off. It commands some respect because people assume you have good gear. If your weapons weren't great presumably you would trade that red and white dress for something amazing. The fact you can keep it means you have some crazy gear.
---
Isn't the vault instanced?
---
My new level 2 was looking for a level 400+ to attack with her level 1 board today..
---
She was especially emotional today!
---
Lucky she didn‚Äôt find one so she curled up with a bottle of vodka and some mutant hound chunks..
---
The current system is absolutely horrible, you need to be level 300-400 to max out a single perk. They're getting so much lashback over it that I highly doubt they will let the current system slide. You might end up being at a disadvantage, but I wouldn't be surprised if they ended up scrapping the perk point system entirely and give you points based on your level only. There's hope for that
---
Giving a bloodied weapon to a low level new to the game, he/she is going to scrip it. Save those for more experienced players that got banned or want to start a new character. Other than those I do the same thing, as it can be a challenge to get them to accept it and not run away.
---
That is a long running joke with me and a friend. Soup is all you need. It's the perfect food.

It is such a thing with us that we call ourselves Team Soup.

---
But also tone down radstag spawns in Toxic Valley
---
I think it shouldn‚Äôt be too hard to find some people willing to jump on and protect it. Might be trial and error at first. But between the roleplaying groups and the pvp crowd. Their should be plenty of players to provide protection to the workshops. I mean their is still plenty of players just itching for a decent pvp challenge. Iv also seen a few players mention brotherhood and responder roleplay groups that could get some enjoyment out of helping out. 
---
as for discord iv used it occasionally but never actually set one up so you would need to ask someone else on that. The reason I suggested it was because its easy to use and private. Users have to be accepted into the discord group. 
---
If the guild had enough users logged onto the same world. Say 6 to 8 players that showed up in full force it might be enough to scare of most greifers. 
---
As to how to get that many people on the same map. Might require some server hoping but it might be doable. I have not tried this myself but in theory it might work. Have two people join the same world as a team. Leave the team then each person adds the remaining members onto a team and have them join.
---
I mean yeah, lol you can. Get some Radstag meat.
---
Here's sbq and colossus with rifleman. Not even my main, he has better stuff.

Lol believe it or not, none of them are mounted heads. Literally can't give those away and I'm not wasting space in my vendors for them. I don't even visit camps that have 300+ plans because it's always 25 of each mounted head...so annoying
---
Someone's optimistic
---
Same here. Ill end up spending all my caps if someone has reasonably priced flux.
---
Thanks for posting, i don't feel so all alone now.

---
This is the build I used. Makes you extremely tanky and lets you deal incredible dmg as a heavy gunner. Highly suggest Emergency Protocols and Calibrated shocks as attachments on your PA.
---
right !
---
yeah I ve been there. it is a forest with no mutated animals whatsoever. there is a famous giant fish but it is ok to be giant for this one. Though it wasnt a nuclear blast exactly.
---
That shit would be sooo fun.
---
I don‚Äôt know if you can create new characters as a team and spawn in the same vault. But other players do spawn with you. Iv seen it a few different times when starting new characters
---
One of the reasons I join groups.
---
I don‚Äôt think so - I‚Äôve been in there with another person before. But, meeting just outside the vault would be fine lol
---
I assume vanguard and/or a combination of enemy specific gear.
---
I try build hardened rifles for new players so they have reasonable weapon to start with
---
grow melons for 20% water and 18% food. Then grow gourds for cranberry relish. Keep a razor grain or two around for when someone kills your Braham
---
That‚Äôs not true. I have no build now nor when starting. Currently I use weapons I enjoy, like my pickaxe and hunters super sledge  and my armor consists of 2 chameleon pieces, 1 poisoners, 1 regenerating and 1 weightless. 
---
It can be done with basic stuff as most of this I picked up well over level 100. It just takes time and patience and lots of ammo and stimpacs. I will admit my first time I entered in the code wrong and had to redo the silo after getting another, but it happened and I was proud I did it all alone and without any fancy stuff.
---
Even if that is a low level weapon that's a good price
---
Travel back to Vault 76 and talk to the 2 NPC's down the steps.
---
Lvl 50
---
Thats a steal.
---
[Just eat the bottle like a normal person.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjXOwUnJzA0)
---
Can you explain the workshop thing a bit more?  What is it about a workshop that allows other players to harass another?
---
That‚Äôs the one!
---
I use mixed effects and types for that matter also...
---
always have at least 1 chameleon piece, 1 auto stim piece and 1 troubleshooters piece(fukka ASSaultron)...
---
the other 2 slots just whatever is the best seeming thing I can find..
---
It‚Äôs kind of specific if you know how to avoid it.
---
&gt; Herbivore is much easier to manage especially with farmable tiles
---
I don't know about that, carnivore can just kill any creature while playing normally and eat the raw meat with 0% chance of disease. No need to cook or go to your camp.
---
When it happened for me i Just logged in and didnt had any disconnect. So sadly good internet doesnt save you from it
---
It‚Äôs resources that can be claimed so because of that players can fight over them and steal from each other.  That‚Äôs the PvP element that still exists but it‚Äôs fair game because again you are fighting for a resource spot.
---
Early on before Starched Genes and Class Freak so at 34 Corn Soup is the best, IMO, regarding filling up and keeping your food/water meters filled. Instead of having one that fills each you have one that fills both. Less inventory space and less weight.    
---
After 34 and with those two Perks maxed then it depends on mutations. I've heard that Herbivore is best for ranged characters and Carnivore is best for melee characters. I'll pick up and cook almost anything and eat/drink often. Little buffs here and there add up regarding food.    
---
Radstag meat can make a food which adds 20 CW temporarily.
---
nope has not happened to me on PC so far...
---
Probably because they made the camp budgets 800, so they have to duck something else up.
---
What about the assholes that sell stupid things for like 10K, Toilet Paper, ‚ÄúYou have been insulted‚Äù notes, and ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a dumbass‚Äù notes. Idiots.
---
If you think those Lego perks will make a substantial difference, you are screwed.  
---
If you think they won't really matter except having some grind end-game goal to achieve, then you're not.
---
Thanks like that it would be easier to get diferent efects and not having to focus on a specific prefix when I craft
---
Did you try continuing the mission
---
The gloaters. Lmao.
---
"Hey, I can float and shoot poison out my orifices, and you can't. Na-na-na-na-na."
---
Hate to admit it, but you're right. Seems pointless to go for anything these days. Bloodied just has too many benefits. I'd been full health build for most of the last two years and recently switched to bloodied. Day and Night really!
---
could you also tame that guy? the start of a beautiful friendship!
---
Maybe I missed it, but I‚Äôd like to be able to see where teammates are as a map option - like ‚Äúsnap to‚Äù them like it does when you center on yourself.
---
I would continue with the Enclave quest, read the posters in the bunker, look at the terminals, do what Modus tells you and see if that triggers access to a silo.
---
You don't need to find code pieces, but will need a nuclear key card from a drone.

---
Shoulda joined Tunnel Snakes. They know how to nurture... and RULE!!!
---
I‚Äôm willing. I‚Äôm still a noob on my first character anyways haha.
---
I never got it on both Xbox and PlayStation. I was even playing nw on ps4 before the change and nothing happened. I rarely play on PlayStation I just got it couple weeks ago and I‚Äôm only level 10 and only level seven on battle pass. But I‚Äôve played since beta on Xbox and am 278 and 78 on battle pass and never had the bug. Just got lucky I guess
---
You know. It doesn‚Äôt hurt you if I am. It doesn‚Äôt hurt me if I am.
---
Or run the stealth suit with something silenced, even if your not a stealth build it helps alot with the turrets and assaultrons
---
76 as well and Im with you, dont want to do this grind again.
---
Completely agree. I've respecced all of my characters at least 10-20 points each fine tuning and morphing my build from its original iteration. There has got to be a better way than perk scrapping.
---
All Blue Suitcases .... most train stations have one .... easy to see, lots of people use them already.  Cash registers at HIGH profile shops (Purveyor and at one time Whitespring Crafting Shop).
---
It depends on the level of the gun relative to your level. I mean, regardless of what it is, 1K is pretty damn good for that.
---
Not sure if sarcasm...
---
There is no way to avoid it completely.
---
Lol should not and don't are different things. I've ran into level 62 ghouls around there as well and just server hopped.
---
Yeah, there is. Just don‚Äôt play an hour before and an hour after they reset. Works for me 100%. Maybe I‚Äôm just lucky.
---
My main, lvl 328, and my current, 283, are picked on always. Sometimes people get intimidated by the numbers but theres a lot of foolishly brave people out there. Sometimes I pull them under my wing after dishing back a death sentence. Other times, I ignore them
---
Mrs. Dubcek reminds me of my uncle's common law skank wife who used to try to get me to fuck her when I was like 16.
---
I got the chest piece and then eventually the jet pack (something I‚Äôve wanted for a while) and it‚Äôs been a godsend combined with Marsupial, the 20% faster run in groups, and Bird Bones. Jet packed my way to the top of the satellite ring in the crater and took some pics I plan to turn into a panorama soon.
---
I'd rather have the 2k steel over a stupid hat
---
On PC never had this problem, I do however never enter the NuclearWinter mode.
---
Magazines orally.
---
Bobbleheads rectally.
---
Since I‚Äôm still finishing my build, lots of misc items will get me to go to a vendor since I still need a couple of serums.
---
Yeah, it's definitely not the only way. There seem to be a bunch of different causes...
---
Imma add you, my username is EclipzeMax
---
TO THAT PLACEEE
---
For the food/thirst meters focus on making Corn Soup and carry lots of it.    
---
It fills both meters and takes up less weight.    
---
Don't worry about building a mega awesome CAMP for a long while.    
---
Build the Weapons and Tinkerer workbench first. The first Overseer's camp has Cooking station, weapons, and armor workbench. It also respawns a few items at times.    
---
Look up a map by level of Fallout 76. Stick to it as the enemies and quests stay within those level ranges.    
---
IMO, always have a backup ranged weapon with different ammo. Always have a melee weapon for low level mobs and decreasing ammo usage.    
---
The costs to repair gear is the same if it's a sliver of damage use or completely broken. Monitor their status and head back before spending lots of time away so things don't break all at once.    
---
Most things can be found and crafted easily. For easy caps early on, sell things like Chems, alcohol, etc.    
---
Vendor's don't buy ammo.    
---
Vendor's don't buy scrapped single junk but will buy Bulk junk. You don't need hundreds and hundreds of everything. This game is a huge timesink like any MMO.
---
Don't play too close to the daily reset, don't check atom shop/NW before playing adventure mode on a public server, be lucky enough not to get a crash while loading into the game. There haven't been any confirmed cases of the bug happening where all three things didn't happen
---
But a piece of plastic that you scan for data representing the ones and zeroes that make up your bank account does?
---
Did you have magic armor with 15% reduced damage while blocking?
---
*Ever*
---
Not happened to me. Xbox one.
---
I don't know why they think it'd be made with irradiated tree sap.
---
Tatos would be more appropriate. Kind of.
---
I see your confusion. You can't enter the same silo that has fired a nuke for 3 hours.
---
It's a cooldown period, you can access the other two or server hop to a clean world and all will be available dude.
---
I mean they modded FO4 with multiplayer elements basically thats why. The engine was never designed for multiplayer and the game clearly shows it. It would have worked for a co-op game but as an MMO it doesnt work well. Like Im on a server for hours at a time sometimes and nobody does events. I cant ask ppl to do events as theres no typing. Its just crap.
---
2mm EC is really cheap. 
---
anyway. It's easy enough to get used to. I've had mine for like 600 hours of gameplay and don't really notice it now.
---
Nope. Don‚Äôt have any magic armour or guns. Running a full set of secret service vanguard with all heavy perks and demolition.
---
I'll buy stuff like that if I'm close to 30,000 caps, but yeah, it does seem pointless for a higher level to try and sell stuff for a higher price. Everything I sell is pretty low and I sell a lot of stuff, so it seems to work well for me lol. The only reason I can see someone trying to get caps quickly is for a weapon or armor they might want from a vending machine or they're trying to get plans for something. That's the only reason I still sell items at my machines is for plans I don't have that I can get from Whitesprings.
---
You can also get cork from a lot of the pipe rifles from super mutants.
---
And there's always a crystal liquor decanter in Big Al's, on the shelf to your left as you walk in
---
What???
---
50
---
Good to know. Thanks.
---
76 is another MMO time sink. The more they can get you to play the more your patience will be tested and in this, many will pay REAL money for Atoms to skip levels. They'll never own what they get and BGS could fold and they'd be screwed out of their money.
---
Scorchbeast. One of the higher level enemies
---
Im curious as to if it was them or not. So I am leaving a comment. Please leave a like or reply to this comment so I may come back later. Thank you
---
For the poeple telling you it's easy to avoid. I think it's more a PC problems than a console problems. Cause i've been playing before and after the daily reset. I chek my atom shop every minute when it's about to reset too and never once i had an auto complete challenge. The only bug i got so far is my jetpack not showing up.
---
I'm on Xbox. I've deliberately played on reset and done everything people tell me not to do about the auto complete bug lately, never had it
---
Random mob although I strongly advice against attacking it at your level. :)
---
You'll find out what they are while you progress through the story, don't worry.
---
One can never be sure when it comes to the scorched plague.
---
"Hurry up , Candidate. The match has just began, and you're already behind..."
---
Similarly to how the Enclave sees itself as an extension of the US government, at this point, the Enclave, and potentially the BoS themselves, might still see the BoS as an extension of the army.
---
I've got a lvl 50 explosive compound I use all the time... It's great for clearing out large areas of enemies, especially with my Chinese Stealth Suit... The damage it does is ungodly with a sneak bonus!!
---
I guess they don't need a courier to fetch them something at the moment.
---
Just turned 26 today. I've known about this since I was 12
---
2mm ec is one of the cheapest ammo to craft tho...
---
Oh wow so thats the event i keep seeing, it just wooshed over my shack nearly took it with it.
---
More rules to follow!  Thank you for telling me how to play my game.
---
My point was that I‚Äôm using double the ammo. 
---
I‚Äôm not that highly experienced yet in gameplay and I thought I could make mention of this bug to be helpful.
---
Yup. Unfortunately it‚Äôs so rare (in my experience) to find vendors with flux.
---
Right above ripper‚Äôs alley on a cliff, sometimes when I fast travel I just fall off the cliff and die but the spawns and resources around are too good lmao
---
The whole system in it's current state on the PTS is horseshit and I genuinely hope they change it. Some of the perks arenot bad but maxing them out is a task only a very, very low percentage of the playerbase will ever achieve. If at all.
---
Yup, no SCORE for me too. Four of them were auto completed ://
---
Can we just add fast travel that works the first time?
---
Dang I took the piss on this one. I didn't disagree with the fact that the Stash system, and FO1st meta pushed by Bethesda being lame af. I just meant that good luck&lt;3
---
Eh, it took me four weeks to complete the season and now the challenges are absolutely meaningless. Before I had incentive to log in every day to get my atoms, but now nothing. I wish challenges still rewarded you something in addition to score.
---
&gt; Haven‚Äôt seen Explosive as secondary effect.
---
That's because you can mod any bow to have an explosive effect, as long as you have unlocked the plan (high faction rep required for this, I'm pretty sure). Other mods available include flame bows and plasma bows, among others.
---
I got a two-shot crossbow some time ago. I added the explosive mod last month. 
---
I used it once and put it away. I haven‚Äôt used any bow since then.
---
Its the second time we had seen it they are so fast, oh awesome so far weve been having a blast exploring.
---
Oh no i was on xbox sorry
---
How much were you playing daily though?
---
Or go to any body of water, and you can smash it until you die from the rads.
---
I have two 3* bows. You can add the explosive effect by buying the mod for it. I love playing with them, but as you mentioned cant use them in PA, &amp; they are slow to reload so not much use outside of low level areas.
---
Where were you when you saw this? There are 3 types of scorchbeasts, the legendary and normal scorchbeasts can be found around Appalachia. The Scorchbeast Queen can only be found during the Scorched Earth Event in the Cranberry Bog.
---
The beginning of my game, sorry. Got this game like 2 or 3 months ago
---
I tried making friends online, but I'm usually just treated as a junk or ammo supplier.
---
I don‚Äôt recall missing on the first shot with mine, I wonder if there is a hidden minimum perception required for it to hit on first shot
---
sadly no :(
---
Glad it helped you, bud.
---
Pfft. Scorchbeast meats are delicious and nutritious. Only thing worth eating, most of the time.
---
I was going to recommend CSS for the bow. It's worth mentioning the Covert Operative perk under Agility. This doubles all sneak dammage. How'd and suppressed weapons do wonders paired with this.
---
You can join an Xbox party and at least start on the same server and pop out of the vault ‚Äútogether‚Äù
---
stable flux
---
Oh no, didn't factor in that I have Thru-Hiker
---
Yup. It's a godsend for lower levels
---
Finally found one too.  AA, 33 vats chance.  Gonna be perfect for a low AP automatic trash mob killer
---
This is a great idea. This would make swapping things between characters so much easier without the fear of losing it.
---
I always have a surplus of glowing meats and glowing fluids lol
---
I always run mixed effects on all my armor. I think it adds versatility.
---
Yeah, this happened to me - it was just gone one day after sitting on it for months. Turns out my group launched a nuke while I was fucking off in the waste.
---
No MMO even limited MMO Fallout 76 is immune to griefers and such problems. I play solo 99% of the time and have since the Beta. Pacifist mod turns OFF at level 5 so turn it back on and ignore the idiots who try to ruin the game for others.    
---
I had a problem with them maybe 3 or 4 times in the time since its' been released. BGS did a pretty good job at keeping enjoyment of the game and those 'people' from doing much damage. PM me if you want to know anything else.
---
Yeah last night joined one and it was just me and one guy so I said I guess no one is going to collect ore so we just where racking up xp then more showed up. Thankfully one guy collected enough to give us the first reward. Only once was I in one that we got maxed but didn‚Äôt get no good rewards. I am going to have to take my t65 in with me and just go after ore instead.
---
Yes, I corrected myself in another comment
---
I'm not a fan of it either. We need some kind of fair drop in mechanic. I load in 5-10 seconds faster than my wife and I'm on an original Xbox one while she has an S. People on console can put the game on an ssd and load way faster than a base console can as well.
---
Junk - looking for stable flux  
---
plans - looking for the rare one I don't have  
---
ammo - .45, .50, ultracite .50, ultracite fusion cores  
---
I'm not sure what amounts of each trigger me to visit a camp.   If it's close, it can be very low.  If it's far, I'll probably try to find the player on the board to see their level. i.e., a level 30 is probably not going to have stable flux even if they have 500 junk listed, whereas a level 100+ might have it even if they only have 25 junk listed.
---
Honestly, I noticed this too, but then I decided to bring Beckett back to my camp and experiment on outfits for him.  I landed on the Bomber jacket and military beret as my "eye candy" Beckett outfit... Beckett's a good looking dude! So... I can't really judge here... LOL!!  To be fair, seeing how people dress up the "allies" in their camps is often one of the funniest things about this game.
---
This statement is fallout in a nutshell has me chuckling for a while üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Does it still work with broken armor?
---
Pro tip: use 1 rank of gun fu in agility. 
---
If you want to get that first shot to hit go in-out-in of vats then shoot. Should land the first one.
---
I sided with the Raiders and didn't give the Settlers any gold. Can I still get the farm tiles?
---
There's some hazmat suits at the entrance, I usally grab one and run around getting all ores. If you wear it, even as a bloodied build the rads are bearly noticeable
---
That‚Äôs the hidden gauss 2-shot perk.  üòé
---
But, yeah, I feel the pain.  I can go through whole clips on my gauss rifle while standing right in front of a supermutant and miss every time with vats (I done that...for science reasons).
---
Lol that's pretty funny
---
put a price like 5 cap and they will go fast. I sell every plan for 5..20 caps depends on ingame price. This way u kinda help to low lvl players and have some extra caps for fast travel expenses.
---
I only put buttressed on the armor. It gives the best effect. The guass weapons I can‚Äôt speak on really. I think I only bought one mod for the shotgun.
---
Are those items rare cause I just drop them to people?
---
I know box spawns better in Morgantown and have better luck with looting and fighting in the city or starting at Bolton Greens
---
Zerk is supposed to be complicated to use effectively. I think the goal is supposed to be no armor at all or a hazmat, but other players such as myself have found their own niche within this class. I use the medx and Psycho addiction, protected marine wetsuit, and level 1 leathers for those sweet legendary effects. I'm working on a weightless set of wood, however it's very hard to acquire these pieces as you will need a lv 4 mule to dump your extra legendary trash to roll 3* lv 1 armors.
---
This happened to me on my main character. I'm not sure why others think it continues, the quest just completes right?
---
I haven't bothered trying to launch a nuke, kind of crappy someone can just spoil the most monumental thing/quest you can do in this game.
---
That said, I'm sure you can still launch a nuke.
---
I didnt know about the fixed Whitespring spawn. Thanks for the heads up!
---
I think it'd be a good idea. Had the same thought
---
Yeah normally I have to much on me to wear that or I would be over weight. So I have to use power armor or maybe the Chinese stealth armor which I will have to unload a bunch of stuff before that
---
The robots were programmed by the Responders and Raiders. The currency was backed by the fact that most of all trading happened at the Whitesprings and could only be done in caps.
---
I tend to look at my own vendor on the map to see if I‚Äôm missing anything. I keep everything at 1 that‚Äôs not a hot ticket item. A quick glance from someone just looking is often enough with a full seller list to bring them in. I keep those low items highly priced so I don‚Äôt need to replace them. I‚Äôm talking 1500 for one stimpack. It‚Äôs just to advertise that I‚Äôm able to keep the item list full. I‚Äôm not expecting anyone to purchase it for that amount. I was constantly stocking my food slot with canned dog food for 1 cap but was frustrated that it was the only thing people bought so I jacked that price up to combat that. I‚Äôm not selling that shit it‚Äôs purely a ploy to lure in you fucks to buy my shit. What I am selling is my plans, my bloodied items, and unyielding armor. 1000 caps per star. But.. I‚Äôve recently pulled the uny due to SS crafting. And bloodied due to crafting the new guns. So now I‚Äôm a peddler in rarities. Event driven suits and hats, currently halved my stock of fasnacht masks, since it‚Äôs over and people might have missed. My flux sales at 500 a piece is impossible to keep stocked due to demand. My junk sales also cannot keep up. I take in a lot of caps from rare outfits, flux, and ammo junk. Nothing better than popping into a camp and they have these items: flux, outfits, ammo junk, and plans I don‚Äôt have. That‚Äôs when I know I‚Äôm in big swingings camp.
---
Thanks, I use gun foo and it does lock after first actual hit
---
I mean the times I've gone there ("behind" the clubhouse itself, on the little hill before the road) there's always been at least two squirrels there so...I'm guessing it's a permanent spawn.
---
Yeah I was mistaken!
---
Your the dumbass
---
Its pronounced diabeetus in WV sir.
---
If you read enough of these threads you'll find that even people who followed this have gotten bugged.
---
I always collect the ore while no one else bothers. Once I‚Äôve collected the 40 from all 4 caves it spawns back in too slowly. If 3 people collected the event would be complete in a few minutes. The last time I did it I did get on the mic and say someone collect ore please. They did but come on surely everyone knows you need the ore to complete it quicker.
---
I wear it with the marine armor helmet, gives a pretty cool survivor look.
---
There is non-hostile one that shows up at Morgantown Airport...it‚Äôs used as a sign of what‚Äôs to come as you progress.
---
That‚Äôs sort of my point.. on my Herby I just pick stuff in my camp when I need it.. then cook it.. nothing spoils if you do it right.
---
On my carnivore I have to find a place to cook it, then store it, sell it or eat it .. not a major issue but just a bit more farting around .. and don‚Äôt get me started about finding squirrels!
---
You get a total of 2000 Atoms along the way. The season doesn‚Äôt end until September 8. Best option is to wait until a few days before and *then* decide if you want to spend any Atoms on ranking up. 
---
We aren‚Äôt at the half-way point yet. It‚Äôs far too early to be buying ranks, for most people.
---
Once the Legendary Run has completed either events will crash and burn with no one bothering or the XP farming will reduce and event goals will be completed again.
---
I've found carrying Corn Soup is the best and great at all levels. Fills both meters and then you can focus on other foods with the benefits you need.    
---
My main has over 200 Purified water and only have 2 Water purifiers going.    
---
I snag almost every recipe I can b/c I like being able to use/make as much as I can.
---
I‚Äôll try the vats double tap
---
I have had this happen 3 or 4 times now,  very weird,  always leaves me wondering if I clicked the wrong thing somehow.
---
I would love to be able to double the effect with the mod AND the secondary Perk.  Can‚Äôt see why I shouldn‚Äôt be able to ..... so few variations of the bow as it is.
---
Honestly, a chainsaw with a flamer and long bar mod is just broken. I used the level 20 chainsaw I got early on all the way up till the 60s. It stacks bleed and fire damage fast, so you can take on enemies way over your level and shred them.
---
Like Benny said, the game was rigged from the start.
---
Public events are public, you are not isolated... go play FO1st. You gain nothing from that launcher, you lose XP and the bloody things are always glitchy as hell.
---
aw hope you guys enjoy the experience so far the community is rather friendly through my play these few months hope they're the same for you!
---
How much do you charge for Formula P plans, and are you on PS4?
---
I can never get into PP that has players that DON'T abandon the friendly animals for a legendary, and I can't watch them all by myself, so it often fails.
---
I'm pretty sure there is gonna be another legendary run, but maybe Beth will add more events and remove dead ones
---
The first time I had seen it was near the place that looka frozen in time with all the robots protecting it, Whitespring I think?  The dragon looked like a Sprite sponsored dragon lime green and yellow. The second time was where my shack is at, near groves family cabin.
---
That you may need to finish the BOS quest line to see. You get access to crafting Ultracite PA at that time.
---
I don't do NW that much but in areas with more buildings and things where containers are tend to spawn more items in NW.
---
If it's in the whitesprings, there is a fissure near by where they spawn.
---
To be honest, strong back isnt that great. I have gotten much better utility drom Thru Hicker (pretty shure that's the food and drink reduction), Traveling Pharmacy, Bandalore, Radicool (if bloodied), and Batteries Included. Weight reduction Has been much more valuable. If you have a moded back pack though, and just have the points to waste, you can probably work strong back in. I still feel like you could use other perks and mods for better weight management though.
---
Happens to me just a single time on PS4. I played a round NW after starting the game before I played adventure mode.
---
Today I was during the refresh in a NW match but nothing happens.
---
Dense is great against scorch beasts. On limps I just roll deep pockets because I'm a hoarder.
---
Man I remember my first scorched beast sitting. I was like, "the fuck is that thing! The fuck is it x screeching at me! Dragon?!?!"
---
I sell out of all those, plus tokens and claim tickets, faster than anything else.
---
I also throw in some ore, for anyone that might need it for the possum badge.
---
Mine lead me to a road then tried to get on the road from a slight ledge and never made it up. After 5 minutes the magic went away.. After a few more minutes he just disappeared.
---
Bugthesda :(
---
If you want proper Fallout historical psycho killers, you need  Pint Size Slasher outfit. :)
---
It might help.
---
It should. If Bethesda has any integrity at all (LOL)
---
I completely agree they should of added more lore to them. I hope they add some quests for their factions down the road. Add it to the list!
---
Deep pockets will be available for SS limps come next update.
---
I have 3 INST \*\*\* bows.  1 Compound.  1 Regular.  1 Crossbow.  The Reg and Cross have 33VATS, 15%Faster AG refresh.  With Covert Op they do unbelievable one shot damage.
---
Any Bow with Covert Op does INST like damage on first shot ... with VATS assist, they are absolutely deadly
---
"Sprite Sponsored Dragon" üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Watch the skies traveler.
---
This is assuming people want the sought after rewards. I don't. And I know this type of comment usually gets downvoted but Im trying to be real and voice why people don't. 
---
The event will be around forever. But the legendary board game will not. Camping the middle spot and firing down the hallways with XP buffs guarantee a huge XP gain. Me running to get ore missing the XP gain for a small chance at a nominal reward isn't worth it to me. It's likely someone will get above the 25 threshold to succeed at the event giving my treasury notes but beyond that IDC if it succeeds.
---
I also agree dropping them 10 seconds before the event ends is the meta. But to collect the ore and wait only for someone else to finish it off would be frustrating.
---
Another words it's safer to camp and grind XP than it is to run around for a chance at a reward miss XP or have someone else finish it missing the XP. After this board game you'll see the event die off and no one will do it so try and enjoy the influx of activity while it lasts.
---
I sell loads of food recipes. There's a challenge to have like 50, so I always sell my extras for 25c. Someone is always coming and cleaning me out.
---
How rich.  You can tell me how to behave on a public server and cast me down to my private server but I can't  play how I want?
---
I‚Äôm rank 67. I‚Äôm I good? What does this mean? Should I be worried?
---
I'll buy out 38 and fusion cells at 1c. I burn through it so fast farming.
---
Two Shot and Quad Crossbows .... but haven‚Äôt seen a single Bow or Compound Bow with those effects and I‚Äôve been shopping since the Wastelanders release and haven‚Äôt seen any discussion.
---
It would be nice to use it on something other than just having fun and that can compete with other weapons
---
I maxed out script a few days ago for the first time. I had to use it or lose it.    
---
I have to get rid of a lot of stuff in my STASH to make room for more things to sell. I have a lot of plans and recipies more than anything for very cheap.    
---
Once I've shaved off a few hundred pounds I'll start putting in more gear. I don't like the odds of 'random' item as 99% of the time I've gotten shit. It's another time sink used by devs to keep you wasting your life away.    
---
There are times when I'll sit and help new players how I can. I'm usually close to the Wayward N of it.
---
Nope. I'm on Xbox and also haven't had it. I have played and not played NW before shutting off the night before. The only thing is, I consistently play after 7:30pm. Once or twice I've played after 2:30, but never before.
---
And what I got was that you are a pompous ass and refuse to listen to someone who has access to more information than you think.  I don't need to go off assumptions.  I've tried to give you as much information as I can without breaking any rules.  You choose to make your own assumptions because you by your own admission have no access to any real information.  Pot calls the kettle black.
---
Especially a high tier bloodied explosive one
---
Pics or it didn't happen. üòÜ
---
I saw a wanted guy around my camp,my door and ammomachine were lockpicked,so i wore the patrolman outfit and hat and started chasing him yelling "Stop right there criminal scum,no one violates the law on my watch",he resisted arrest so i had to put him down, i think he got the reference because i  heard him laugh and he said "i used to be an adventurer like you,but then i took an arrow to the knee".
---
Yes, and make it cost caps to use.
---
Absolutely true ... and that‚Äôs just a base level bow.  With Legendary effects like 50% limb damage, the damage is magnified.
---
Ultimately it‚Äôs worth being in the middle, if you get to launch it yourself sometimes!
---
I feel like of it weren't for the 10k xp lr challenge more people would be collecting ore. The event pretty much always went super smooth for me before the lr started. Now everybody's all about getting xp
---
I'm pretty sure it's linked to logging out from the pvp mode. Log in and out from adventure when done with nw.
---
That weapon is worth 10k caps easy lol my b2525 fixer is worth 20k caps according to you I guess.
---
I sell those. They get pretty good returns from NPC vendors, and glowing blood packs aren't nearly as good as they were in 4
---
51 here, it hurts knowing I probably won't finish.
---
man my camp is on the Riverside opposite of the wayward and i just put him on a rock so i can't hear him :))
---
Yeah, those charred ghouls are nasty; they hit like trucks, move fast and have a lot of health.  At first I had to deal with them by taking out a leg then whittling them down, because they can barely move with a leg crippled.
---
And that's what I'm saying it does garbage damage against the end game boss my BE25 .50cal hunting rifle should not be hitting for anything less than 700 damage on her, but I can use a fire rate fixer and crit spam 400 damage head shots on her makes no sense to me
---
The point is that animals, normal animals, are back.
---
Must be a rarity or a new bug,  hard to tell with this game,  hard truths though man for sure.
---
Nope, Xbox
---
If you mean you have a max level 2-star The Fixer, with Anti-Armor/+10% Damage while aiming, then that could normally sell for around 6-10k, five or take depending on the buyer. 
---
What level is it?
---
Edit: Saw your other replies.  Yes, a max level The Fixer with those effects is pretty nice, and you for a very good deal.
---
My 74 year old grandmother does fine. People are nice, always giving her stuff or helping her without knowing who she is. I'm sure you'll be okay, just turn back on pacifist mode at lvl 5.
---
I would assume they already know about it.
---
I check my teammates and if they are lvl 200+ 
---
If they have ok price I will buy something to show my respect.
---
If you're on Destiny 2 right now, I added you yesterday coz I need to view your precious collection of plans üòõ
---
What‚Äôs this?
---
The exposion explains the wasteland, not the lack of fauna in the existing flora. Even the lush forest in the forest in f76 is empty with regards to animals.
---
I‚Äôve not really lost one engagement so far. The QFFR FR Tesla‚Äôs a cheat code, it‚Äôs the entire reason I started doing this. I think I‚Äôve ran into about 3 people who‚Äôve had upwards of 700lbs in junk? I instantly store that shit into my scrap box the second I claim the workshop. Just recently today ran into a sap carrying about 300 raw aluminum and 700 adhesive, it was a good raid.
---
They give me rads and that‚Äôs all I need
---
I didn't get that help.    
---
I was part of the BETA and it was only through 99% solo that I got where I am today. My first char was so messed up that I deleted it and now my new one is level 94; the highest character I've ever had in the few MMOs I have played.    
---
I'd have to set up my headset as it would facilitate crafting and getting things for someone. My STASH is full of a lot of stuff and I would like to get rid of a lot of it. I'd rather it go to new players who hopefully would 'pay it forward' when they get much higher in level.    
---
I'm on PC and my user: DocB30tn (Doc for short).
---
Road map of where u should be. Changes every day to reach 100 with a day to spare
---
I drop mine, or blue suitcase. Too heavy.
---
If u r on PC i have all of them.
---
Good timing I just started a new character to try out bows.. currently sneaking to the foundation at level 8 to pick up a basic bow plan.
---
Don‚Äôt suppose there are any bow spawns anywhere? One of the hunters camps would make sense
---
As it stands now, rifleman has only some "problems" with the sbq, but that's it. And the SBQ was never meant to be soloed.
---
For the rest it's one-shot, no matter the build. So... No, we don't need a separate buff.
---
place 5 cap for a plan and they will buy them.
---
Yes.    
---
It will be marked as "Unowned" only to spend caps (another stupid choice by BGS) only to get there and find it built up. There's NO way someone could Claim and do that within a few seconds.
---
The stuff in that stump surprised me.. Decent
---
Same as me, first time ever.
---
I love the irony of ChiCom propaganda robots being sold on a DLC shop, Mao‚Äòs brain would implode XD
---
I got it a few days ago but knew of the bug so I haven't switched the skin b/c I don't want this happening to me.
---
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
xD Meat to blow up rad showers
---
Yes especially when fast traveling to vault tec University and mama dolce's
---
No, berserker's is absolute trash in its current state. As another post earlier today said, high risk and no reward. Even what you are suggesting wouldn't be enough to make it competitive unless they changed around the other effects too
---
I mean like I said , I‚Äôm not trade specialist, I don‚Äôt know what things are worth what and it doesn‚Äôt bother me in the slightest if someone corrects me
---
Ok ty for clearing this up for me guys y'all are awesome!!
---
Yes! As long as you‚Äôre not in the workshop you won‚Äôt be free game. I can see when you‚Äôre in the workshop regardless of you sneaking or not as the ‚ÄúClaiming‚Äù progress bar freezes in place meaning it‚Äôs being contested.
---
Mmmmm carbon üòã
---
It doesn't always stay over that selection. I've done this and had wasted ammo and points in converting and buying. Pretty sure this is another 'feature'.
---
That‚Äôs fine! I love the early parts of the game and seem to be perpetually making new characters. Send me your gamer tag and I‚Äôll friend you (my gt is the same as my reddit name).
---
Maybe I‚Äôll try to set a discord up today too if there are others who want to mess around with it offline too?
---
I know how to run rifleman, but I dont wanna run it with a semi auto fixer and hm I want to use a sniper/gauss/lever, cause its more fun, and there's no point in using the fixers and hm semi auto when I can make them auto and do pretty much the same damage
---
I'm die hard Free States, but that's all the more reason to share my wealth with some newcomers.
---
I used to play fo4 and recently went back to it to check the actual limits of my new beast of a PC, and I found that mods I would have labeled as lore un-friendly in the past seemed totally reasonable now. What got my back to playing fo76 was the realization that nobody would visit my settlement or visit my shop.
---
You are always welcome to join me in my cause ;)
---
If they're nearby and have at least 1 weapon. I found a rare weapon at a vendor by traveling to the edge of the map once, didn't have the caps for it.
---
Definitely going to travel to any camp that has 10+ weapons.
---
I usually travel to those that have a lot of ammo, not nearly as much as those with weapons.
---
Just because there is an ingame method to show the locations of other players on the map for a short time doesn't mean there isn't a cheat that permanently reveals the exact location of all players.  If a player is using the terminal, then they still have to find hiding players even if they know their target's location on the map.  
---
Due to how quickly the match ended, the winner getting half of the total kills during the match, and how they went right to the edge of the water and immediately fired a couple of rounds to end the match, I seriously doubt they just used a terminal.
---
I've hit 100 and it does give 500 atoms.
---
Cool.
---
, thanks.
---
Lol, the random encounters with players can be priceless sometimes. Classic.
---
So they can hire an army? It took me over a literal year to finish base game quests over on ESO, and I'm pretty sure I missed some. I haven't even touched the new expansion yet.
---
I enjoy playing FO76, but it's ultimately very weak on storyline and NPC action. I didn't even know I had finished the main quest until someone told me nothing happens after dropping the nuke.
---
Hmm. I was on NW to finish the Daily. Maybe I've got confused at which point I actually logged out.
---
Any ideas on the whole Dehydration etc? Linked as well?
---
The more free in-game content they add, the less money they can make from microtransactions.
---
But then I can switch to and stealth commando and solo her in under 10 minutes ur contradicting urself here, if it wasn't meant to be soloed y can I use my b2525 fixer and kill it that fast but ill sit there for 30 minutes with my BE25 sniper and barely get it to mutate, do you actually use rifleman?
---
I don't sell .38 or .44, but 10mm does sell from time to time.
---
Given the other comments you got an absolutely steal in that weapon.
---
But it doesn't need to be "competitive", does it?  
---
It isn't a competition. It just needs to be *viable*. Same as Mutant's ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 5% per mutation would still be less than the 30% specific bonus of like Hunter's or Zealot's, but it would make it possible to run full Mutant's. But i suppose the diminishing returns of DR/ER would still kind of ruin that.. Ugh why is diminishing returns even a thing?
---
Doesnt hurt to have multiple reports. Should put more heat on them to actually do something to compensate, like a few free atoms to buy a couple missed level ups. It should at least.
---
So few people talk about it, but invisible power armour has become more common than ever. I'll go whole matches never seeing a single suit, but my companions will either see them or someone else will see them. Really annoying being built for Stablised and power armour-dependent.
---
"an exploit we abused is being removed, so that means bloodied is grtting nerfed" No son, that's not how it works. Bloodied needs a nerf with or without exploits.
---
Sure; jackshoegazer on PS4; am on now
---
I'll be on in 15-20min my psn is Eshark7 so look out for a invite :)
---
I get that, but a semi auto fixer doesn't do barely any more damage than a auto fixer and the dps is incomparable, soloing the sbq with a semi auto would either not be possible or u would be there for at least over 20minutes
---
We‚Äôll always have people complaining (whining) about PVP in this game even though they‚Äôve literally put so many safety nets at this point. I see no problem in having a little fun with it.
---
Every other post is about this though.
---
Dont know whats the proplem my friend use bloodied and he deal 1400+ dmg
---
I've got the usual 9
---
I don't experience this, and one of my toons is dedicated gauss shotgun build
---
I never found one (Did the same).
---
Up the road from the Duchess Place (Overseer‚Äôs Camp), across river from Slocum Joes, is a camp that often spawns the wandering merchant that sells bow plans (and mods) ... be wary though, the mods cost about 1400 caps each, the Glow Sights about 250 caps.
---
Keep a look out for my CAMP (PS4) at the teddy bear fire pit (SE of Lewisburgh, NW of Silo C‚Äôs Launch point ......Under the Sky Train tracks.   I have pretty good selection, though I‚Äôm keeping the prices a bit up to maintain stock while I attempt to keep building my shop (I sell compound bow mod plans at cost ..... ridiculous to have to wait until ‚ÄùAlly‚Äù level to get those).
---
Depends what you want from it, mutations, and build. I use brain fungus soup for Intel, carrot soup for perception,  cranberry relish  for xp, cranberry juice for more xp, glowing meat steaks and bear roast for melle damage. A mixture of food, soup and drink keeps the bars full.
---
In real life, I try to stick to steak, eggs and chips, though. Intel, perception, xp and damage seem largely unaffected.
---
I've got a stalkers bow that i don't use. I'm not sure what the other effects are.
---
I'm in xbox and could set what it is if you're interested.
---
are you also using Bloody mess, Nerd rage, Adrenal reaction and Stabilized? (Power armor)
---
also if you have grounded it will reduce your damage so either keep on Class freak, or remove it
---
I only have a 2 in charisma on one of my characters. Strange in Numbers and Tenderizer. I'll swap Tenderizer  for Friendly Fire in certain events. I'm sorry team, I'll have to earn my worth by doing the objectives. 
---
      Tbh, I think people who share bum perks constantly are worse even if they are rare. Not only are they as equally unhelpful, but they are also handicapping themselves. Of course I understand that a lot of the good perks are earned later on, so anybody around 50 or below can get a pass on that. I also understand sharing crafting perks to help out a low level player.  But if you're level 80 and constantly share rank 2 Super Duper at a SBQ, I dont think you should get points for trying.
---
Relog and you will see more :)
---
Yeah, my gamer tag is xawkwardkate :)
---
I run a bez for my alt full time, there are ways around most of the challenges, it‚Äôs not as good as bloody / junkie but it‚Äôs not bad and you can get perfect rolled weapons for cheap
---
If you take med x and psycho addictions you can get armor up to 20 DR. You can get grounded and a backpack for amsot 200 ER and can get RR and PR from armor.
---
Also get a dense leather chest as explosions are very painful. 
---
If you wear low level armor you have to hit exactly 20 DR to be at 0 DR with addictions. I use different lined under armor plus level 1 armor to get there. 
---
For nuke zones I generally just swap to T65 with vamp or run a rad suit
---
So I had this problem earlier today.  My handmade was only doing 58 per shot to the queen when normally its close to 200.  I took off my unyielding armor and put it all back on and then changed weapons and changed back and that seemed to help.
---
Im on PS4 so I‚Äôll keep my eyes open for you.. same PSN?
---
Yeah. Even Rust Forest looks ok though we couldnt spent there more than 15 min. I dont remember if i saw them exactly in this area but sure I did withing 1km zone where the radiation lvl is up to 500 uR/hr.
---
Agreed. Spend one day fighting monsters, doing amazing things. Spend next day getting your tiny flower pots on the Whitespring bureau you just snatched up from Pendleton just *so*.
---
This is the first time I‚Äôve seen such a thing. It was 4 challenges then later all of them and the rest were auto completed
---
Can't use them in Power Armor so...
---
Todd has decided I don't need an opinion on bows
---
Smart ass.. üôÇüëç
---
Hasn‚Äôt stopped some from what I‚Äôve seen
---
Did so, and indeed you're correct. But, shoot. They have been auto-completed without the accompanying S.C.O.R.E. reward. Shoot. Looks like I am now a victim of the autocomplete bug too. Oh well.
---
I don't know why they just don't give you one perk point for every 5, 10, 15 , 20 or 25 levels. Easy as no worries nothing hard to implement either.
---
Why cant you share your information?
---
Nobody knows this stuff going in unless they've researched it.  Don't feel bad.
---
I‚Äôm not using those. Will it increase my damage by like 1000? Cause others are doing damage at 1000
---
The only mutations I have are speed demon and marsupial
---
Also, I can‚Äôt decide if I‚Äôll be using PA or not
---
Just hit me on log-in as well... Poof another 2k score vanished
---
I‚Äôm not really using any armor.
---
Same, I can usually bulldoze through all of the daily challenges in 20m-30m.  Sometimes the NW is dumb like pick locks or kill x creatures &amp; not worth the time.  I can make that up by getting about 20k-30k experience on the repeating weekly.
---
I don't get the whining - lots of people want everything handed to them on a silver platter for no effort on their part.
---
Could I see his perks and armor? What weapon is he using?
---
I usually want to survive as long as possible, and so i HIDE as much and as good as i can. every now and then theres someone who becomes an immediate threat and... well.... sometimes i win. sometimes... the others lose! *wishfulthinking* no. the three kills i could make this week where pure luck...

I have the same issue with dross toss. Contact Bethesda with a customer support ticket, they will probably reset the quest for you. They did this for me though it didn't work and I got the, this has been forwarded to the dev team response. But this is what you need to do first. You could also try deleting you saved game file on you console. Don't worry it resync's when you log in. And nothing is lost .
---
I don't know if rare. But I've been trying to find them for ages.
---
I have 9.
---
Platform and IGN?
---
all of them will provide damage boosts, bloody mess for all damage, Nerd rage for more when below 20% health, Adrenal reaction for the same. and Stabilized for Anti Armor on heavy weapons (and better accuracy)
---
Yes, a level 8 (I'm 278 or something).   I tell them "no" a couple of times and  ignore them.   Whatever the level, if they keep it up, I block them and FT or just leave the server.  Mostly.

One of the stashes gave me a plan I didn‚Äôt know, and I‚Äôm lvl 450-something.

Xbox, GT: vie carry us

PS4 ... Otherwise I would definitely been interested.  I want to test the Stalkers effect with and without VATS assist vs. any other bow with VATS assist.  I have been frustrated with the Stalkers effect and suspect it is broken/bugged but hasn‚Äôt been reported.  I want to put data together and submit to Bethesda.
---
that special guy today was able to walk high in the sky over the landscape and one shot everyone without even being close to them.
---
I thought nerd rage just affects like one shot when it randomly occurs. It‚Äôs a continuous buff? Same with bloody mess and adrenal?
---
Get cannibal perk, eat people.
---
Cook whatever you find for buffs if you want them, or let them spoil and use the fertilizer to make grenades to eat more people.
---
Corn and grain are good for making whiskey. Use the whiskey to wash down the people you eat.
---
Note: Only 50% serious/ 100% cannibal. Because some people taste funny.
---
Start at Vault 76 and go down the steps on your left hand side and talk to the 2 NPC's to get started on the Wastelanders DLC.
---
Fair enough ...... I share your frustration.   I wouldn‚Äôt mind as much IF the crossbow did a correct amount of damage in comparison to the the Compound Bow, not LESS than a regular recurve bow (thats just ridiculous .... its a NERF bow apparently).
---
Take 5 minutes to do the re-skin, 55 minutes to put into that fucking engine.

it is pointless to tell them. u will see the same topic over and over again. let them collect the ore for god sake while we do our best with xp :) anyway have my upvote for ur effort.
---
A few hundred acres of forest is not sufficient to host a diverse ecosystem
---
I just got into this game after years of pretty much boycotting it a couple months ago. There was a lot to do but now I‚Äôm truly seeing the issues. I‚Äôm finding it hard to even log in for the daily score at this point. Definitely looking forward to the expeditions or whatever that are coming soon. It‚Äôd be amazing if they turn this game into a Fallout worthy of Fallout levels of play time.
---
Quit bringing up expand camp budget Because they have explained this more than once. The main problem with is that they can‚Äôt get the budget to expand as long as they continue to support the Xbox players. It‚Äôs a combined game code, server code, and hardware limit. even porting to the new Xbox whatever they call it next year will not solve the problem unless they last gen players from next gen players,

Tasty Squirrel Soup master race. +25% xp for an hour.

I was a pre-order person and stopped playing a month after release. Came back to it in June and honestly, I feel like it's a different game. The wastelanders update, for me, changed everything. You have a choice of companions who you can have live with you, including two romanceable ones, plus a robot of your choice. Also, the shop, although frustrating, really does have great cosmetics, and my C.A.M.P home really feels personalised because of that. Give it a go, it's really worth it. Even if you just pootle around and be a tourist rather than actually follow quests.
---
Yeah, that one
---
You mean the broken record?
---
Deleting saved game data will erase your in game photo album, character display pics and settings.
---
Theres hockey mask in game, can you tell me a spond
---
You will only get 1K+ if you have nerd rage, Adrenal Reaction, Bloody Mess, and perks for the plasma caster.  You won't get more than you are getting unless you use sneak/headshot bonuses.  Your friend's caster isn't better than yours, he is probably just utilizing it properly.  You can't just stand there with no proper armor or perks and expect it to be any good.  With the perks above and sneak/headshots, you'll get 2K+ out of that weapon.  Good Luck.
---
I guess i don't get it or because i am a high level ,what the grind is.  I play maybe 2 hours per day and been out of town not playing for many days.  I am at level 90 and have like a month to get completed.

I was talking about rifleman. And yes I use both.

Instigating Lever, 50% limb, does around 3-4K dmg crit heads

BE25 HM, ~2K dmg crit heads.

And for the SBQ you need to get as much damage as you can in a short timeframe, so the rifle just doesn't cut it. The firerate is just not high enough.

I put a sniper barrel on mine and just use them for that.  (Yeah, I have multiple.   At 1.8 lbs/weapon, why not.)
---
I‚Äôll be sure next time I get to hold on in case any wants it
---
Hey, laser-lips! Your mama was a snowblower!
---
What are the perks for plasma casters?
---
Oh wow sounds awful. That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt play nw much. I feel like it‚Äôs full of modern and cheats
---
Turned 18 5 months ago, have watched the holy grail like 10 times
---
Wow! So, I need Adrenal Reaction, Bloody Mess, Nerd Rage, and heavy gunner. Are there any other perks that I need? Is heavy gunner enough, or do I need some sort of energy perk?
---
Ultracite prototype paint is a BOS skin, they don't just have it for t-60 lol
---
Yes ik the firerate doesn't cut it which is why it needs a buff 3 to 4k is literally nothing when u have what 5 shots before u need to reload its pathetic it needs to be faster or more damage i respect ur opinion man I really want a rifleman buff it would motivate people to actually use it
---
Currently I just eat corn soup, the only thing I can really make atm
---
I also use the sniper barrel. It‚Äôs totally essential. Not sure about the receiver. I don‚Äôt wanna craft ultracite. Also, I‚Äôm only using one, cause I got a bloody one and I‚Äôm not gonna test the RNG gods again.
---
The only time I got this bug was when I tried to connect without realizing my internet was currently down. I think that is definitely one of the causes.
---
I BELOOOONG
---
Interesting. It would make it too easy for someone to farm scrip/gold on main and then spend on the alt. I don't know if that is what your goal is here, but I think BETH goal is single character progression drawing out the grind of the game. I'm all down for people having and using alts, and I agree there should be more incentive to actually build up a second charcter to beat WL and farm rep and gold all over again. There needs to be better alt transfer and trade protection first or something like that.
---
I feel ya.  I hear some say but the dailies only take 30mins-1 hour to complete.  But there's some of us who simply don't play at the computer 7 days a week.  I've thought the biggest detriment to the system is it does feel like it pushes you to log in and play when you otherwise wouldn't.  I don't have an issue at all with the amount of work/time required, for me it's simply how it focuses on the dailies.  
---
My idea is it has all the same dailies but basically turn them all into a weekly reset.  So folks who want to log in for a little every day can still complete their dailies then, and those of  us who would rather log in 4-6 hours on a Saturday could do all 7 days worth of dailies that way.  Same commitments just more flexibility.
---
Yup! Should be enough time to save up a bunch of scrip!
---
Alls fair. Game is not about PvP at all, however they tried to shoehorn it in. It‚Äôs kinda in a no mans land and it makes everyone whine from different perspectives. 
---
People who don‚Äôt want it whine it exists at all, people who enjoy it whine that it‚Äôs been so reduced and neutered. As with most stuff there‚Äôs no middle ground and it‚Äôs a pity really, but it was and is just so poorly done overall. 
---
Workshops are literally the last legit refuge to do it, so honestly I‚Äôm not bothered what happens at them. I accept the chance when I claim them. I never did any on public before the challenges, but even with the challenges I‚Äôve rarely had any issue of contesting as long as you‚Äôre smart about it. 
---
If someone does turn up though I‚Äôd have no problem having a bit of a fight a couple times.
---
I‚Äôm willing to do delete my save file because I don‚Äôt have much pics  anyway but with do I delete reserves or my profile save data?
---
ü§´
---
It's a new Handmade skin that was added a few weeks ago, but vanished in the atomic depths
---
 The forest one is actually the hardest to make IMO. Get the Ash heap recipe, search the rooftops of Lewisburg for Ash Rose, and the area southeast from Welch for lots of Blight. I get about 40-50 per run using Chemist and Super Duper.
---
Nerd rage is permanent effects. Always boosting AP regen, DR, and Damage.
---
It's okay, I just wanted to say something for if OP deleted his save and wonders where his album went.
---
I'm same I'm grinding the rare outfits so do ever event I can to try get them to drop. But there is only normally me doing them. And at minute they seem to be really slow in popping up on map.
---
All we currently have is a skin for the handmade rifle called "screaming eagle" (atom shop)
---
If you are somewhat AR purist though there are things that will annoy you about it, like an AK side mount for optics, and currently no rear sight for irons
---
You sir, are the true soupnazi!
---
Like a lot of people are saying with the armor, scope around shops and see if you can‚Äôt get comparable unyielding pieces. If you‚Äôre running bloodied builds, you can get an additional +15 strength with a full kit. So with all of the perks listed, just look at your armors! I‚Äôve found a lot of people are selling 1 Star unyielding robot pieces on the servers I land in!
---
I'm in that range(300ish) not a single mount, ultracite pa piece, jet pack plan, or mole miner gauntlet plan. I sell a mix of useful camp stuff, cheap(instruments, cuckoo clock, ect) rare plans( bear arm, the fixer, ect) and 3* weapons and a very little armor, also a bunch of ammo!
---
I'm not sure I just did my saved data I'm not sure what the reserve is.
---
Sure, and that's valid. It's dumb that a fat man can break in one shot.
---
The legacy energy weapons, not so much.
---
I knew action boy was broke...i thought i was just imagining my ap qasnt recharchong as fast as it used to
---
We've been asking for this since the game launched. We've also been asking for a proper Obsidian made Fallout game or a NV Remaster for ages. They don't care about their fanbase. They just want to make as much money with the least amount of effort possible.
---
I'm looking for a bear arm plan if you're on Xbox üôÇ
---
I‚Äôve got around 20ish in perception and it‚Äôs still absolutely pants with the 1st shot.  Same can be said with the gauss pistol as well. :(
---
You definitely can. I have the plasma mod on my bloodied explosive compound bow. When I put on the bow perk cards that thing is ridiculously overpowered. I think the bows have been a great addition and are pretty satisfying to use.
---
yup
---
Sorry PS4 üëç
---
Well then I'm happy to provide you with your first confirmed case of the bug happening under those circumstances.
---
I just had the exact same thing happen to me. Logged in to see 4, relogged to find the others have been autocompleted. Don't understand why they cant fix this.
---
Then how did it happen to me?
---
I don't see the connection to fo76
---
Just been my experience they're likely to be lower level. I think it's because everyone builds on the golf course sooner rather than later in their game. Probably because it's a good place to level and has flat grounds to build on. I usually visit the ones across the street from the Station though.
---
Lol
---
I will ask but he didnt played in a month now but what i know he use PA heavy gunner without bloodied perks so with proper perks and armor he should deal about 2k dmg i think
---
Yeah, the same happened to me with the gauss shotgun:  bloodied on the first roll.   So I stopped.  :)    I'm still not sure if I'm going to use it, but I ran out of things to buy with gold, so I thought I'd give it a spin.
---
I was using bolstering before. Alright. I‚Äôll get unyielding. Is that better than power armor?
---
It‚Äôs around 11,000 atoms from 1 to 100
---
Oh I can't wait
---
It wasn't a content update. 
---
It was a full on DLC. 
---
Everyone here is an arm chair quarter back and seems to think things like bug fixes, in an open world, live service, spanning 3 platforms and a bajillion potential player interactions is easy and they're just not doing it because they hate us?
---
Wastelanders was almost entirely well recieved. Could have been more/better, but we'll received none the less.
---
Also, there's this thing... Certification. BGS can't just jam through console updates, It needs to get the green light from Sony/MS.
---
WOT M8?!
---
Yup. I was running gauss pistol. Got berserkers at best. Thought I‚Äôd give caster a try. Bloodied first roll!
---
I only ask because at level 240~ Ive moved to the golf course after being virtually everywhere else
---
I pretty much always collect 25 ore, pop them in the machine to start spawning a few harder enemies (usually Deathclaws that are worth way more than the few ghouls I miss out on killing) then farm for exp like everyone else. It usually only takes about a 1.5-2 minutes to collect/deposit the ore and re-equip my gear and I'm still tagging some ghouls so it's not like I'm totally missing out on exp during that short time. 
---
If you have a friend willing to collect ore too you could probably knock out the first tier in less than a minute together. Event still completes (maybe not for max rewards, but it's better than failing) and everyone has the opportunity to earn more exp from the harder enemies that spawn. There's really no downside to doing it.
---
I was going to post this too! Love those guys.
---
Most of my cards are max level so finding one I have enough charisma for is hard. I do feel bad though that I can‚Äôt share anything
---
Nope, still 9
---
Been really disappointed in Bethesda.  This bug plus a few others are annoying and also very common.  With all the positive press around the release of wastelanders, steam release, xbox pass, and now info on upcoming tv show there is and will be a huge influx of new players.  It would be nice to keep some of those new players and not have them all bail after a brief try-out period.  By not investing the money of having additional personnel squashing bugs it will really hurt the game in the long run.  
---
On double xp weekend I played 4 matches, in 3 of them someone was cheating above the game world killing every single person.  Things like this do not make a good first impression for folks.
---
Plot twist, the bottles of wine are Boone's Farm.  No fancy corks or nice bottle caps.  But, lower middle class white kids love them!
---
Oh no! I'm sorry that happened :(. Hopefully tomorrow they won't!
---
Sentinel armor is one that the 3rd star or effect will be 75% chance to reduce damage while standing still.
---
Are there top tier rewards besides the rad barrel plan? Can you get that more than once?
---
I'm on PS4 as well and started a new character recently. If y'all are looking for new people to play with I'm down.
---
Welcome to the community and wish you safety and adventure in the wasteland
---
I love this community. 
---
"Something is wrong...... Bethesda probably secretly intentionally fucked us somehow."
---
Tasty Squirrel Stew is the carnivore equivalent. 
---
20% with carnivore and 25% with strange in numbers also
---
I go stabilized personally. If you use a lot of hip fire, you may prefer something else
---
For bloodied absolutely. PA doesn‚Äôt have a matching benefit. If you get the Secret Service armors and roll (it will take a lot of time to get the full set) it offers defense comparable to some PAs. I‚Äôve only got 2 unyielding right now but with all my SS armors, I can take a few hits from charred without going down. I also recommend healing factor as an additional mutation just to help out with maxing your low HP. Scaly Skin for additional defense at the cost of AP. I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôll want to avoided Grounded as it drops the damage you do with energy weapons. Make sure you get the charisma perk ‚Äústrange in numbers‚Äù to maximize your mutations if you haven‚Äôt already and of course class freak as well. I‚Äôm sure you know most of this already but I‚Äôm just trying to make sure I cover all the of the bases!
---
Cool. Thanks bud!
---
What about it?
---
Your welcome
---
How does one smelt elderberries?
---
we litter!!!  :(((
---
I hope they never introduce an account shared bank. 
---
Just so people can keep whining about it.
---
One of the best benefits of 1st. Easy stuff swap.
---
Yes! This is definitely the way it should be done, if you compare to other games, they let you progress when you want rather that within a certain set of daily challenges. That being said I reckon to complete the season it should take around 5 hours per week, I‚Äôm currently spending more than 10 but that may be because I‚Äôm slow
---
I sure hope so. Just not worth it atm
---
It's people like you, that are the reason i refuse to even come near workshops.
---
However, it is good that you're at least fair with your raids. No fun in fighting raiders if it's a lost fight from the first second.
---
yes you can
---
Sure am glad I did that barbarian training
---
Same! I've never had this happen before. I logged on and saw them complete and for a second thought I had gotten on before 12 but nope
---
Good to know.  I have ridiculously bad RNG luck, so I don‚Äôt get anything by way of Purveyor drop (recently spent 4500 scrip .... not a single bow) so I have to buy all my legendary weapons .... haven‚Äôt seen the explosive secondary effect yet.  Gotta keep looking I guess.
---
No one said that.
---
Something that could have really helped was a dedicated matchmaking system that would help you locate a team without having to use outside sources. 
---
I'm sorry but I have to disagree with why they failed. I dont think it was because people were too weak to do them. Although yes, I met plenty of people who wanted to get carried through. I'd say the low interest was because the content was mediocre at best. Timed fetch quest with hordes of buffed enemies that ends in a reused boss from a different event for armor that's only useful after you get the full set. Of which you dont even get the pieces, you get plans and a little bit of the materials to make it. So you have more grind and RNG to put up with after you did the actual grind.  The loot was kind of appealing, but no where near worth actually doing the raid. Server stability was also a major issue when I played. It got better after private servers but it's still garbage that you would have to pay for a private server to be able to actually reliably do in game content. Like most things 76, it felt it was poorly planned and badly implemented. I would have rather seen it fixed than stripped though. I was really looking forward to the cryo vault, and was hoping we'd have a fire vault in the ash heap filled with mole miners.
---
Relog and they should reappear BUT they also may autocomplete...
---
The way I see it, it‚Äôs a lawless wasteland. I know a lot of the community detests PVP, but a post-apocalyptic game is much more immersive to me if I have an option to participate in said lawlessness.
---
Ah shit...
---
This happened to me yesterday when I was on Seek and Destroy, so I thanked all the Gods for that hero making me not have to chase the damn cargobot around and go through the bunker.
---
It's a bummer you missed out on your first time, but you can still do it. Frankly, it isn't even that fun to go through the bunker process IMO. Join in on a group doing one of the bunkers sometime to experience.
---
Which event?  I‚Äôve been doing them forever and not gotten anything rare.   Well done, btw
---
They need more synergy with the other perks of the game period.  The other perks need to be overhauled also to make them viable.
---
Leader of the pack. Yeah its the first event I've ever gotten a rare drop
---
There were a lot of leadership Bobbleheads anally inserted recently
---
All good man. If you have a point to waste, there are some really good level one perk cards. And if you dont, that's also good. They get a boost from you being on the team too.
---
Should would have made a great NPC
---
A b2525 fixer is highly more sought after than a AA +10 DMG .....
---
And cap value is absolutely pointless any how. If I really wanted that weapon? Like really wanted it? He could say it was for sale for max caps....
---
Ok. What do I care? Caps are largely useless
---
But we need like 2million where do u get bulk cork at
---
Their design team gets paid more than the dev team, or at least it seems like it.
---
Now to grind for the helmet.
---
I remember in Fallout 4 I had a mod that gave me the bottle whenever I drank something simply cause I wanted the extra glass when building. Then Hardcore mode was added and every time I drank a purified water it gave me back an empty white glass bottle for some reason so I had unlimited purified water... Eventually to make things more difficult I went into the geck on that mod and removed the script from purified water that adds the bottle afterwards. 
---
(Good times... I remember when I needed purified water I‚Äôd visit the brewery where Tower Tom and his gang was at and pick up every bottle and take them up to the vault to fill with purified water. I could get it from my sinks in sanctuary but I decided not to until I build the industrial water purifiers since those came way later. Kinda immersed myself in a way.)
---
Not yet! *knocks on wood
---
Is this the Krusty Krab?
---
this site can give you a rough idea if something is worth caps or scrip
---
 [https://fed76.info/pricing/](https://fed76.info/pricing/)
---
In my twenties. Knew what it was from immediately.
---
This is a known bug with the Future Tech skin.
---
I love running around in a hazmat :D
---
Your way of using the addictions to lower your own DR to allow for legendary armor is big brain tho
---
This screams trap camp haha
---
Update: as u/SuddenlyCthulhu suggested, relogin does work to show the missing challenges. He did mention that they may autocomplete but in my case they didnt. 
---
Hope if anyone else has this bug they read this and dont freak out as much as I did
---
Just happened to me too. I logged back in and it auto completed the others.
---
I had a glitch where I permanently had a disease that had no timer. The only way I got rid of it was antibiotics.
---
Thats because our money isn't backed like it used to. It used to be based on the gold standard. There were even bills that were "certificates ". IE the silver certificate dollar. You could take that to the bank and get a dollars worth of silver.
---
Bruh I swear it's not a trap lol. It's just a really funny camp where we messed around with building
---
Thanks i tried the morgantown method and it worked
---
I already had a helmet and the suit, so this will be a trade item
---
I use to befriend wastelanders get double every animal and every tick but then after it only happens once and a while: but I no for sure when I was crafting stims I needed it I used that perk maxed out and got double. But don‚Äôt even bother crafting stims that way. Get the chemist perk you get double then get max super duper and get the commie collectron and it will collect blood packs and a good bit and that‚Äôs how I never had to buy stims again they or go after ticks
---
Thank you! I‚Äôm not going for Secret Service armor because it‚Äôs such a grind for bullion, which I would rather spend on things like ammo factory. My plan is to get Nerd Rage, Adrenal and Bloody mess maxed. From there, I‚Äôll see what I can do about mutations.
---
Do I need any energy perks?
---
I dont touch any main story line quests much other than gently rubbing up against a couple of the early ones until I am lvl 50.. Same for Wastelanders...
---
I go out of my way to make stews, they are like upgraded soups :D
---
https://fed76.info/a/zerovats/
---
The real value in some of the mods is the reduction in VATS costs for those of use who use VATS heavily.  There was an update that did away with zero VATS cost per se, but you can still reduce to a manageable amount with certain mods. Automatic receiver adds 50 percent reduction. See above link. Have a good one.  Grumps.
---
I dunno man this post screams trap!
---
Come to this camp...
---
Perform action that we tell you that locks up controls...
---
Switch to area chat so we can hear your reaction...
---
The post screams trap camp whether it is or isn't.
---
That sucks man. We've all been there.
---
I've done this on old toons, new toons and somewhere inbetween toons and concluded there's no exact rhyme or reason to how she responds. Old toon was fine, new toon just had to do first Rose quest to get on to wastelanders stuff. Ones in between would have to do the Freestates stuff too.
---
African or European?
---
Why? No additional rewards to grind for+hardly any xp=no incentive to collect ore for me. Maybe if bethesda decides to give us massive xp for depositing ore on par to enemies killed in same amount of time then maybe I would. But im not an altruistic person and until they change this system imma keep killin ghoulies.
---
While I like that sound of base game content added every two weeks... I feel like that would result in a bunch of half assed buggy stuff being added to the game, if we‚Äôre going by the quality of their atomic shop stuff and how little they play test it before selling it to us every week...
---
Go smooch a pickle, this is a shit counter argument.
---
Ok well I'll tell you what is actually is. It's you play the piano to clip under the earth and the camp underneath is really weird because we build a bunch of random stuff. But I can totally understand why you would think that.
---
You can make explosive arrows once you learn the plan
---
yep legit, good drop in fact
---
Who are you who is so wise in the way of science
---
Hey friends, Julie here.
---
Agreed!
---
Yeah lol I thought that was directed at this comment when you commented.
---
This. Especially since the levels get harder.
---
No it‚Äôs not legit if it has a second legendary effect that states ‚ÄúBullets explode for area damage‚Äù that is a spawned in weapon via cheat programs.
---
Around 15 to 20k of every type of junk besides vault steel, including flux.
---
How much life do you want in a post apocalyptic wasteland?
---
Nah. Just chuck it. I imagine you chug and chuck. That's why everything is so littered no matter how much you clean! (Just a theory)
---
I sell flux because One of my characters is a queen fighter and he usually has 20 of each for sale. People buy them fast.
---
If you can find an energy perk let me know! Haha. But probably get the energy ammo weighs less, I think that‚Äôs in intelligence. Other than that, I think the weapons are just grouped and you‚Äôll want the heavy weapons/expert/master perks. Adrenal is a mutation as a heads up! And I feel you on the secret service armors, but once you finish your current gold buys I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth it just to get some decent legendary armors you can ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù.  Good luck in your hunt and welcome to the bloodied club! Everyone hates you, including other club members!
---
C o n s o o m Prilosec
---
I'd do the same if it weren't for high levels who like to clean out vending machines clearly meant for low levels. Bullets go for a cap. Most plans go for half off. Other plans most high levels already have go for 25 caps or less. If I see a low level at my camp, I send them a message with the offer of freebies.
---
PC? Then yes, hacks.
---
I feel you i got a bounty and a group of low levels kept trying to kill me so i let the ole gauss mini do the talking
---
This sounds amazingly terrifying
---
I've it too, strange things
---
Now that's a striking pose!
---
Ooh, those plasma cartridges do add up... Had no idea adrenal is a mutation! Uh oh! I‚Äôve gotta go searching now...
---
I know we are hated :-) I‚Äôm just worried we are about to be nerfed
---
Stop trying to make me starve man, that‚Äôs my food factory
---
I‚Äôm rather liking my carnivore mutation and party boy, most stuff I kill drops meat which I can just eat raw for 40% to 50% per piece on some stuff, and the sweet water special blend is also very handy, along with any beer or other drink I happen to find laying about, like at train stations. Plus I have a ton of booze from the mole miner event as well.
---
Problem with that is, they might pump out many Atomshop items....but look at the new posts each time it updates: Half if not most of the stuff always has some horrible bug that makes it unsuable in one way or another. While I would like faster updates, at one point we have to realize the limits of this newbie studio that got thrown into the cold water on its own in a environment they don't know.
---
From your map screen you can find a team to join or make a new team. 
---
But tbh most people just use the team feature for the benefits and not to play together.
---
See also my legendary free radicals mask.
---
Well you could save them and hope Bethesda introduces power armor displays. I've got like 10 sets in my stash awaiting the chance to show off
---
Do I delete my reserved save or profile save?
---
Excavator gives you x2 for mining. really helpful at high level. keep it !
---
I hardly leave my excavator since it allows you to have 100 more carry weight than all the other power armours  due to its built in carry weight bonus.
---
I think it's random. I'm still spawning late (and the gameplay, netcode and just about everything else are so unplayable I'm probably going to abandon this game) but after saying the same thing five times in a row it started saying all the other stuff.
---
I wish I understood how to get rocket boots so I can hover in the air like everyone else.
---
Who hurt you?
---
Excavator comes in handy running Lucky Hole mine farming lead
---
It‚Äôs very annoying to drop in some place with my team of randoms and by the time I spawn in they‚Äôre already running around with Marine armor and shite 2 seconds after my screen loads in.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs PC.
---
You can still scrap them for mod plans.
---
Excavator power armor doubles how much ore you get, and increases carry weight by 100, and you can still put calibrated shocks on it
---
The communtiy is really awesome so far we have been helped multiple times even given supplies and starting gear but a random nice person.
---
I'd be down to play sometime. My PSN is Thebeeefactor.
---
I had the same 4 auto completed as you did today. I haven't had any auto complete in weeks before today. Only thing of note is my camp couldn't be placed so I chose another server when I logged in. Did not log into NW for weeks. Waited until 12:30PM to log into adventure mode.
---
I believe you‚Äôll need a fire rate of 200~ to trigger the magic damage. Unless, this is a Junkies Explosive, then whatever the fire rate is multiply it by 2 &amp; see if it‚Äôs over 200~.
---
There will be another season but they already announced they'll have pauses between seasons.
---
Thanks friend. There are some pretty interesting perk combinations I've found to help diagnose zerk damage thresholds and DR limits.
---
If you have exactly 0DR, then you gain a 50% damage boost to *initial gun damage * ; so if you use weapon specs and bloody mess, nerd 1, demo 1, adrenal, sneak, it all stacks on top of it. It's op full health and low health too you can see the difference in damage. It's a whole different balancing act though than meta players want, it requires a lot of management and understanding of the mechanics of the game to squeeze every little bit of juice out of this lemon.
---
If your DR goes negative, you gain no gun damage bonus nor penalty but the weapon sure does feel weak.
---
And at 1DR, your *initial gun damage* will go down 10%, causing every thing you do (sneak, crit, weapon specs, etc) to go down a cross the board, this is why this class is difficult to manage. 
---
I actually run mysterious savior/ revenant and bank on that sudden death. I have some footage somewhere and plan on doing a full write up of this build after I've fine tuned it for NW as well.
---
Yeah but you gotta grind a ton to get your rep up
---
Here‚Äôs a video of the random encounter if anyone cares.  Sheepsquatch has some good footwork!
---
https://youtu.be/Xrzf64e_Bow
---
What the hell happened here
---
luck is the only chance you have...
---
Ok cool I'll add u when I get on
---
Just a couple days ago, I captured video of two players (who were in the same team with each other) who I was spectating. Both of them had infinite ammo, both shot through the ground, to like the other side of the map and racked up kills.
---
I started spectating and recording after I got killed right after spawning in by one of those two players, with damage coming seemingly from nowhere, and damage that was not making a bullet hit sound to me, but sounded odd.
---
Once I died, I obviously saw where that other player who had just killed me was, and there was no possible way for them to have shot at and hit me (buildings and actual ground in between us.) Spectating them of course revealed them to clearly be using some kind of a cheating tool.
---
So, infinite ammo is a thing. Seeing other players through the ground and buildings is a thing. Bullets penetrating buildings and ground is a thing. It also looked like they were locking in to their targets, so throw autoaim on that list as well. I wouldn't be surprised if they spawned in with weapons as well.
---
I did obviously send Bethesda the video evidence with names and so on.
---
You are affecting others for no advantage, the launcher at LITS is just a pain, it may cause the scorch beast to show sooner but all the  noise and glitching that launcher causes is not worth the rubbish drops from the bats.
---
Unless Bethesda made a new statement recently about the problems being fixed that's technically not true. 
---
All they did was release a patch in order to *find* the root of the bugs, not fix them. They have yet to update us on if they even found the issue or a solution or what not. 
---
The situation is still a load of bologna either way, shouldn't have existed in the first place and they shouldn't have taken two weeks to get a jump on it.
---
did the fire go out?
---
The servers cant handle it, after the wastelanders update with the addition of npcs(specially random ones) they have to severelly nerd critters spawns due to server performance (thats what's made faschnacht fail this year when it was first released)
---
Unfortunately no, when you use radaway or rad scorpion food to remove mutations it removes a random one. I would purchase the serums from a player vendor for the ones you want to keep, and then go about removing them so if it gets rid of the ones you like then you can replace them. For the future, get starched genes in luck, with level 3 you can‚Äôt get rid of or contract new ones without a serum.
---
Wait seriously?     I mean ive got way too many rad aways but with my lucky those 2 mutations would end up being the last 2 üòÇ
---
Did you pick up wood near the tall trees to keep the fire warm?
---
Ultracite is good, but its down to luck drops on whether you get plans for its mods. A huge majority of people don't have the Calibrated Shocks plan because of its incredibly low drop rate, so while you get good physical damage resistance, it might be a long time till you can use it for general utility.
---
X01 is good for energy resistance, and you'll be able to buy the exact plans you need. I'm at level 228 and I still use it, mostly because I'm nostalgic for when I used it in Fallout 4. Reactive Plates rounds out its slightly lower damage resistance, making it exceptionally good for general and affordable usage.
---
Excavator is effectively purely for utility. Huge ore yields for mines, and extra carrying capacity when used as a full set. It does have the lowest resistances, so its not advisable for combat. Its still good to keep for hauling extra loot for fast travel.
---
I'd say keep the Excavtor armor for getting back to camp on high encumberance, and keep the X01 until you get Calibrated Shocks for the Ultracite PA.

---
Ahh so 1 more question then.   So in the whitesprings bunker they have the recipes for the serums but i think the prices for them are super steep is there any ither way to get the recipes cheaper without putting points in the vendor card?
---
Nope, even after the event ended the fire was still on the ground lit. Basically we were guarding the fire and adding kindling, the progress bar for the fire was more than halfway full. Then the prompt went away, the bugs stopped coming and the event had disappeared off my pip boy.
---
I read that before I made the post, it doesnt tell you where to find it.
---
...
---
Edit: woah are there two different types?
---
Same gpu and cpu here, got a bit better fps by setting the following in Adrenalin (sorry that it's in Swedish but hopefully you will still understand):  [https://ibb.co/SVz1ytS](https://ibb.co/SVz1ytS)
---
That's the only place you can get the recipes for them from, you use to be able to get them from the scorchbeast Queen but this no longer exsist.
---
I always found rose to be a little annoying but I couldn‚Äôt get over how much she sounded like Amethyst from Steven Universe. She would have been an interesting NPC in wastelanders.
---
Congratulations I've been grinding for months for these. Have you a lucky horse shoe in your back pocket by any chance.
---
Are you sure that's not glowing fungus?
---
The chicken coop is alright, though I was disappointed they don't get out and walk around.
---
what platform are you ? if pc i can sell you serum really cheap (150per) / and give you some.
---
It‚Äôs okay I just learned this myself 5 days ago ... first from this subreddit but then I got to confirm it in-game when a crouched guy was defending a workshop. Handy tip if you gotta go to the bathroom or you‚Äôre running a silo!
---
I‚Äôd rather it be more hard work than time and chance to get those things though. I don‚Äôt like the idea of logging in every day and get things by pure luck. That‚Äôs my biggest problem with the system. I‚Äôm ok with putting in time and effort but wiping out westek a hundred times is not my idea of fun.
---
There are other ways to make things valuable than ‚Äúchance‚Äù.
---
Maybe when a character reaches level up 100 they get a legendary of their choice. If someone wants to grind over and over they can do that and not want to bang their head against the wall when they get another ghouls slayer rolling pin. That‚Äôs what I think would be better.
---
I'm on ps4 so I don't know exactly what you are looking at but... 
---
You keep your profile on your system, you would delete anything in the saved data for the game. You should probably do a restart at this point before loading the game again. 
---
When your load the game back up it will automatically connect to whatever profile you log into normally. 
---
I've had weird stuff happen with this game in the past and this does seem to help a little bit, I don't know what is happening here though if it saves a glitch or its coruppted data or what.
---
Honestly I kinda like the pass. Gives me something new to do after so many hours of playing. Most of the challenges aren't too bad other than the level up and overseer rank ones.
---
Im on xb1 lol. Thank you for the offer tho =]
---
Sometimes you can buy them from players, but honestly, there are always people selling pretty much every serum. Sometimes you can get them for really cheap. Also, I wouldn‚Äôt discount egghead, the intelligence boost gives you so much more xp, great for leveling and the legendary run. If you don‚Äôt have class freak, get that leveled up too. Makes most negative effects negligible.
---
Wait until you hit 100 and see the planetarium lol.
---
My GF and I have never experienced this. We play on Xbox, both have it installed on an external SSD, and we always load in at the exact same time. We don't even have the same Xbox, I have the more powerful X, her the less powerful S. We've played hundreds of matches since December.
---
I've been looking for cobalt flux for about a week now. I would go grab some from a nuke zone, but I just don't feel like it. I need 5 to get that Secret Service Jetpack up and running
---
Yea i heard sbq was a drop but i wasnt sure if it was true or not.  Ive completed her a few times and havent seen any of them lol
---
It's possible with 1st.  Probably not what you want to hear though.  If you start a private server, Drop off what you want to transfer in a suitcase at a train station, then switch characters and go into private again.  It will be the same server so your items remain in the suitcase.  Any container will work but the suitcase doesn't have a weight limit.
---
Just remembered! Adrenal lessens the usefulness of stims so that‚Äôs why I got healing factor!
---
I actually saw this for the first time last night. Was so confused when I saw my teammate get in it.
---
That‚Äôs in nuclear winter
---
Block them. Then ignore them.
---
I just did do that. They wouldn't stop if I didn't.
---
Have you tried trading for one on the market sub?
---
It bricks your camp. Hope it gets fixed.
---
Not gonna lie, I lost all interest in them when my Unyielding radical mask lost it‚Äôs effect... That was literally the only thing that made them special compared to any other raider roughing it out there in BFE... and they didn‚Äôt even wear their own mask to boot.
---
Nope radaway removes random ones. Your best bet is to remove them if its going to mess with your build. Then at the very least get starched genes. class freak is also required to lesson some negative mutations effects but I don‚Äôt know enough about bloodied builds to say if you need it. 
---
However starched genes is a requirement for running mutations.  You‚Äôll need to move two points into luck to equip the card if you don‚Äôt allready have room in your special points for it. then you‚Äôll have to choose it when you pick a new perk card and level it up. 
---
The reason starched genes is required is because its pretty easy to pick up mutations accidentally. Standing anywhere near radiation, scorch beast attacks, even getting slapped by feral ghouls can give them to you.  As long as its equipped starches genes wont let you  loose mutations by using radaway and you won‚Äôt gain new mutations without drinking a serum.
---
Block them so they can not see or follow you.
---
Unfortunately there are people like these at every game, these could either be roleplaying raiders or just having fun annoying others.
---
Block and move server is the best I have found.
---
I don't know!
---
Yessir. I've completed the event before and I was doing it with people who also had the idea down. We ran to the trees collected kindling and brought it back while one guy on the roof and another by the shack were one shotting the bugs. It was surgical, no way we had failed legitimately. There wasn't even an "Event Failed" prompt on the screen. Just POOF it ended.
---
Ah you beat me to it!
---
Okay.  Maybe I'm role-playing as a missle launcher repairman who can't pass up a job.   Who are you to tell me how to play the game the "right way"?  Maybe you should go to your private and take your rules with you.
---
Yeah i literally just did that, thank you. Unfortunately there are players like that. It annoys me more because I do everything I can to help others.
---
Jeez, tough crowd. 
---
I didn‚Äôt mean them just giving challenges to compensate was a good thing
---
Then don't fucking load me into the world unless I'm trying to join up with my friends, FFS...
---
The simplest seeming shit this game DOESN'T do...
---
Reskinning or adding a handful of new items is not on the same level with adding meaningful content of any kind.  The efforts are completely different and not even close to comparable.
---
Also, Imagine if this sub was anything more than the same dozen posts being constantly regurgitated.
---
That kinda comes with this style of game, it‚Äôs unfortunate. Next time drop a nuke on their camp
---
You‚Äôve made it past the military wing of the Whitespring Bunker and into the control room (with the pentagon table)?  This step would have required you to become a general, obtaining 10 commendations.  
---
If so, check the Holotape section of your PiPboy for a Missile Silo State tape and run it.  This will tell you which silos are available to launch and how much time is left for cool down on the others.   
---
Obtain a nuclear key card (or two) and enter the silo of your choice.  Use Nukacrypt for the codes.
---
good luck :p don't pay too much each (nothing more than 500) and it's already high priced.
---
good price is around 300ea
---
Thats actuslly a good idea aha. I will do that next time!
---
It used to be but it was patched out a while ago
---
Tell me again how sheep's bladders can be used to prevent earthquakes
---
&gt; Given how much content they add on a regular basis (weekly even) to the  atom store there is almost an entire games worth of content there.  
---
If you think making some cosmetics takes the same effort as making actual game content then you have no fucking clue what you are talking about.
---
A load of people sell them in their vendors. Failing that, complete the imposter sheepsquatch quest line.
---
There‚Äôs a poster about it in the train stations
---
I'm more curious about why we eat bobbleheads now.
---
I wouldn't expect to be able to die and respawn repeatedly.
---
Great answer. I'd love some really tough dungeons too!
---
I've not really got anything I want to trade worth the value of the responders uniform tbh I've a junkies 50cal 10aim faster reload and an instigating ss 1s Wardrum that bout it in way of decent trades. All rest like my asylum dresses I'm keeping got the collector bug I don't mind the grind just wish the RNG God would-be a little more forgiving.
---
I agree it gets tiresome reading the same issue over and over again. But this is brought on by Bethesda. Unless it negatively effects the atom shop, bugs just don't get fixed in a timely manner. In fact they appear to not value bug fixes at all, and want mindless wallets to just shut up and give them money for buggy software. In short, zero respect for their customers, which can be frustrating when you love them franchise.
---
I do not know why FO76 is viewed as such a special snowflake that quality is deemed impossible.
---
YES ...
---
This happened:  
---
This is the second time the daily challenge bug has happened to me.
---
I did the submit ticket thing last time and Bethesda never did anything.
---
p.s. I did not log in today until 12:30 because that was the way we were supposed to avoid the bug.
---
Not if you block them on XBL. That prevents you being match made with them.
---
Go big or go home after all and if you go big enough they can‚Äôt go home
---
oh god, the amount of times i went late into that event just to be tasked to do the ore collection alone ... spoiler, there is not enough ore respawning to do it alone, its a 2 person job.
---
You have the only comment here that matters, congrats.  This is why it doesn't, and will never exist.  The amount of exploits and instability it would introduce is staggering.
---
Were was it said that Xbox was specifically the problem?
---
What was the comment lol
---
"Needed"
---
Exactly aha. That would be funny lol
---
It is a good thing. But as they‚Äôve not fixed the bug that‚Äôs causing it people ain‚Äôt getting the chance to complete the extra challenges either lol. Bethesda truly are useless
---
very very unkikely, but did the timer run out?
---
there are two conditions that I‚Äôm aware of for failing the event, one is the fire, which you told wasnt the case, the other is just the timer.
---
oh, sorry, there‚Äôs a third: beth randomness...
---
m8, you‚Äôre in a streak of bad luck :(
---
ü§î trap camp vison engaged
---
Yes.  
---
The FO2nds won't be too happy about it, though.
---
When did they change it? I remember it very clearly being in the main game at one point during the first few weeks of the game cause that's how I met the same people I still play with.
---
An Einsteinian feat.  I doubt we would've ever figured it out on our own.
---
Just put your tent down and you can use your scrap box.
---
I only play the event for the MASSIVE xp gain...
---
What do you mean they stole from your ammo machine?
---
Post their gamer tags and what system they play on, offer up your own personal bounty to anyone roleplaying as a headhunter.
---
Actually, now that I think about it, it was in the main game. I remember a week or two ago, I was playing with a friend and I executed him that way. So they probably got rid of it sometime recently.
---
That's weird, i never seen that
---
Did someone kill the me legendary
---
Yes, exactly! If it was for Beta players, then I would be happy about it. It wouldn't even take much to make us veterans happy... just a bit more thought than the current "epiphany whilst taking a shit" moments they have.
---
This happens on PC primarily as there are many different build types and only a minuscule handful of console types all competing against near similar hardware
---
It‚Äôs okay because no one even does RR
---
Yes as well as seniority with buildings. If I pop up in a server wherever I build I should get first presidence and they have to move üòè
---
also am I the only one who thinks that fall out first should have unlimited weight and their own servers since you could only put 8 people in there with you?
---
Picklocked my ammo machine you get from the raiders and stole the ammo that was there.
---
The difference on Xbox is profound.  Me and friends noted it's the people on 4k that load in last.
---
Machete or nothing
---
They probably just haphazardly repurposed the ghillie suit skin onto the various armor types.
---
Excavator I still have because it gives 100 extra weight then add everything else I can carry almost 600 with it. Plus if you make ammo the lead the get is amazing. Go to lucky hole mine with it get so lead ore then use super duper and you‚Äôll get about 1k lead from one trip
---
Good idea, gotta find them again, then I will
---
Is that the lvl 50 thing
---
We had one match where I loaded in to the sound of people running around already, and u/Final_Render loaded in another 5 seconds later. It's just ridiculous really and there doesn't seem to be any reason for it hardware wise.
---
You didn't read it too well.
---
Locations
---
Sometimes collected by the¬†Communist collectron station¬†with the 'Proletariat' setting selected.
---
I'm always the Ore Collector. I dont have any particularly powerful weapons and I know I'll be way more useful running around collecting ore.
---
Thought so
---
I‚Äôll try doing that thanks
---
I know, but scrap boxes in train stations and the whitesprings would be nice.
---
on a new server talk to duchess, maybe sell an item, THEN talk to Smiley. works for me.
---
I really should stop being such a casual and actually read the stats of these things. I had no idea. Thanks.
---
Maybe not hacks. There's a visual bug that will make PA invisible to some players until someone else gets into it, and reskins it. You're also invulnerable to damage during the PA entry animation.
---
I think it was just unfortunate timing on your part, that you were shooting him while he was entering PA.
---
this is awesome on so many levels lol üòÜ
---
Yeah but I said in my post that I discovered it in another players collectron. I'm not an idiot.
---
I want to know where to find the fungus, OTHER than from the robot.
---
I didn‚Äôt know this. Gonna start keeping it on me now!
---
Nah wasn't the timer, we we're good, no kidding about the bad luck lol. I even put on my tadpole outfit for the occasion :(  I'll be recording next time it happens so I can send it to Beth.
---
99% of existing bugs are 1 minute fixes. Open the .esm with xEdit and see for yourself. .esm is shared between all platforms.
---
Only a few, like FT or Score autocomplete, are .exe bugs that are actually difficult to fix.
---
This is a really comprehensive answer. I appreciate the information. I think I‚Äôll keep them both.
---
600!!!!
---
Damn! I can carry 285 at the moment. Well, 385 with that info.
---
Yeah that's what I'm just realizing, I didnt know there were two different versions.
---
That's probably the only thing that could have happened but I didn't see anyone looting anything. After it stopped everyone held their positions for a couple minutes then started running around the fire. Also I didn't get an "Event Completed" or anything like that. No rewards, no exp. It just stopped.
---
I was gutted when I found this wasn‚Äôt an option. Hope it does get introduced at some point.
---
so 64 on Monday is the minimum to complete the run?
---
If you use VATS exclusively, true is good, due to the "hip fire" affecting VATS accuracy. If you don't use VATS, the Aligned is better for the reduced recoil
---
Definitely more space in private servers but I think if they added unlimited stash space for FO1st, people would either start getting pissed or everyone would have it.
---
It‚Äôs all a dream.
---
Yeah it's been my 1 wish from this game. LET ME DISPLAY ARMOR
---
Would i be a bad person if i got all the recipes and sold the serums for 250?    Itll fit my vendors theme of everything half off =]
---
Well that explains why it only gave me the option to execute someone that I wanted to revive during an event.....
---
I started by trading all my somewhat valuable items for flux until I had enough for someone to trade a rare outfit for it
---
If you look at the currently available atom shop camo paint for the SS armor, it's the same as the ghillie but without the flat texture applied on top and without the few bits of ribbon. They had the version they wanted to sell ready so they mocked up an inferior version to giveaway for free (Unless you paid to get that far) in the legendary run. They should have at least changed the camo on the atom shop version enough so it doesn't appear so lazy.
---
I still remember thinking that I was so ill equipped to fight that thing and I hid in the broken down air plane
---
When you spawn into cranberry glade  there's usually a good chance to find a tameable animal
---
How much flux do you think responder outfit is worth? Just some know how much to try get hold of.
---
Nothing of value and yet this sub was full of people screaming pay to win about the subscription. Contradiction this seems.
---
I most of the time help low lvls since I have stuff I don't need.
---
I used to just stock weapons and armour.  Used to get tonnes of visors in whitespring. I moved close to the wayward to help more noobs and nobody visits.  I even have a vip lounge where you can see great rolls (tse and fixers etc) for trade. I‚Äôm about to move again.
---
Same thing happened to me. I went to the zen palace since it said recommended level 20 (I was 27) and I was swarmed by about 10 charred ghouls. Very quickly kicked my dick in
---
Shush, that's my campsite.
---
They "fixed" auto completing atom challenges due to logging into NW in an update a while ago. This seems to be a very similar bug.
---
Rightbhhdcyiggyuuu455buhxygcyyrsrharvbtt5hhhvehttgtuhhxtufwg5hcyhe53rtuunsurfehttttthu56r6hrhhtfgygbfdd3susingyour6siudr6t6e6dezh5hsts87zyuu.jt7hhu7ju3u6uh5h65u66ref4hr3f4jzgv xy6=rrrttt4eeeeeeyedeeeeeeeeeeeee544tu6wsd4ff7fftftt5f6r656u√πybf75zurutd5d75drh5s6s u63setsrui3ssyuuhyuu33u ddtdgu2tshw3ugsu5us5xxss56yy66u73yzgrh22srss45
---
I wanted that too lol. How is it?
---
You can't be harmed or engage in pvp before level 5 I believe...
---
And they should totally put a blinged out vault boy right next to it. /s
---
IKR? They used to WRECK when repaired to 200 percent. But they nerfed that
---
I would think that would be the point because then people would start buying fallout first. if I can only add 8 people to my server I honestly think that in my private server I shouldn't have a weight restriction. And anyone else who's in my server who has fallout first
---
How are the 100+ players picking up stuff they dont need. People dont but ammo unless its 1 or less so its a wast if space in a stash.
---
I‚Äôve had that happen where only some show up and the next time I logged in they were there and not autocompleted so there is hope
---
While we are at it can we ban ‚Äúit just works‚Äù lol
---
It's thanks to Reddit that the first one I met is also the first one I knew to follow. Otherwise I would have thought it was a reference to some fandom I'm not involved in, don't know anything about, would have been confused for a moment, and then just kept walking.
---
Instead, they charge insane prices for doing that same thing.  Cash grab, pure and simple.
---
Not on this subreddit. Witch-hunting isn‚Äôt allowed here. 
---
Other places, this is an option.
---
I thought it could also be Junkie Limb?
---
Well, "magic" weapons will be fixed eventually..
---
You can destroy a spike strip and blueprint it and then repair it under them and they'll insta die. Seen some guy griefing people on YouTube doing it.
---
And carry capacity
---
It... Glistens?
---
A neat idea... But I‚Äôd rather they just remove the legendary effect all together, it‚Äôs very useless. Only time I ever bash something with my gun is when I‚Äôm in a low level area and I can one shot stuff with a quick melee to save myself a bullet. Every time I try to bash a high level creature to try and stun them long enough to reload, they barely get staggered at all.
---
(If they changed the effect to ‚ÄúIncreased stagger when bashing‚Äù that would be much more useful, say a melee scorched runs up to you mid fight while you‚Äôre in the middle of a reload, a quick bash of your rifle with this effect would cause them to stagger for a few seconds, giving you time to reload and shoot them in the mouth. Like John Wick in his first movie.)
---
If you're trying to kill Legendary enemies for commendations, keep a look out for Leader of the Pack and Uranium Fever. You can get 6 commendations for killing starred creatures during these 2 Events
---
Keep in mind calibrated shocks for both excavator and all other PAs
---
It absolutely could be Junkies Limb. Yet, the fire rate has to be above 200~.  Like, if you get a Junkies Limb Mini Gun with Accelerated mod then it does magic effect.
---
Ill look it up, thank you.
---
The issue isn't about what is being posted.  
---
The issue is that the mods are god damn useless.  
---
Even trade posts stay up for *hours* (if not [days](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hvk7ie/shielded_leathers/)..)
---
This is the place to go for sure. A mirelurk king seems much rarer than a deathclaw or sloth, though.
---
Will they will they really?
---
Damn really?
---
God people need to use headsets. Seriously everyone has earbuds with those mics on them. I just think most people don't realize that you can use those.
---
You do you. Again, it's good that you at least try to be fair.
---
Nah, they just added more possibilities to the critter spawns. Sometimes it's people. No issue with critters.
---
If you find them boring, then don't read them.
---
It's a fallout community where people share experiences. Just because they aren't you're cup of tea means they aren't someone elses.
---
Don't play nuclear winter before logging into adventure.
---
I'd rather read a story like that than the 500th post about the auto complete bug or "I'm so angry, the legendary run rewards are bad!".
---
There is lots of stuff on here that‚Äôs completely redundant. How many posts are ‚Äú where‚Äôs the best place to level up‚Äù or ‚Äúfast travelling doesn‚Äôt work‚Äù
---
Normal price is around 300. in vendor machine it's like 330/350 because of taxes.
---
250 is a reaaaally nice price. but you should consider that each serum recipes is at minimal 17.500caps ea.
---
And you will need a lot of flux. (they are around 200-300caps ea) :)
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hvk7ie/shielded_leathers/
---
Honestly all junk sells in my vendor, don‚Äôt bother bulking it either. It‚Äôs gone so fast bulking it is just a waste of plastic
---
Oh really? They are trapped in there? Animal cruelty! lol yeah... The plushie and the tree are so far the ones i like the most of these prices üòï
---
You doing fallout 4 they just removed it for fallout 76 I guess because it would be it lucrative way to get more caps?
---
Yes. New version of BB is great for farming ticks. The auto search makes a huge difference. The only catch is you have to have it equipped before killing the creature to activate it, apparently loot is determined on death or the first time you view the container.
---
Kinda the opposite in my experience actually, Ive been looking for a deathclaw for so long, only find mirelurks, hunters and kings instead. My dream pet is another deathclaw or another critter like a beaver or another oppposum
---
Same with rifle
---
But if it was 2 of them and they are friends, the person that is about to have their camp destroyed can just leave and come back once it drops. So honestly doing all of that is too much when they get enough time to leave and come back.  
---
Just wasted energy imo.
---
Absolute saint! Thank you so much &lt;3
---
Me either... yet
---
Or whining nobody collects ore at Radiation Rumble
---
I sell them for 300 and they move like crazy. Definitely worth the initial cost.
---
If people are too selfish in this event. Me and my team pick ore as fast as we can but don't put it in. Once 3 people have fully collected, we put it in and end the event.
---
Waaait, I was told that the Fireman outfit dropped from 2 main quests and Fly Swatter...I could have been grinding Forest Events this whole time?!
---
You cant......
---
Gotcha. Thought you meant the ammo converter.
---
Yeah but the ingame blocking does nothing but make them into a grey silloette that can still fuck with you!
---
Oh its all good. Dont worry about it aha.
---
Wait, this sub actually has mods?
---
Have you seen them?
---
It would definitely be both consoles, but even then it could just be servers not being able to handle it.
---
This is at least the second request like this I've seen, so I would formally like to ask"Can we please stop getting post about not wanting other people to post about"x"" Rofl
---
Imo, just murder all the brahmin.
---
I am back it did nothing
---
Can we please stop the "I‚Äôm so tired of every other post" posts?
---
u/undeleteparent
---
Im too squishy and i slow walk in power armor to help
---
Use bait bombs to trash their camp.
---
I've spawned in front of an epic crate before.  No other players within a decent range of me on the deployment screen. Like a solid 45 seconds of running to the crate would be needed. Yet somehow somebody managed to spawn so much earlier than me that they already looted it.
---
This type of recursion is the best way to end up with a nasty case of stack overflow...
---
Um okay. Have you tried talking to the overseer or clearing the mezzanine level of top of the world? I'm pretty sure you're supposed to beat vanilla FO76 before you can continue Wastelanders.
---
It should also deal +400% bash damage. Bashing is so bad.
---
Whats a bait bomb?
---
I played since day one of release, but couldn't get access to the beta.
---
Do i still clasify as a veteran?
---
Does something happens if you reach zodor?
---
Yes but they only wake up to protect NW hackers when they get called out by name lol.
---
It shows that you hang it from the ceiling... maybe you should have inspected it first. 
---
Idk I‚Äôm just really getting tired of people being disappointed over things they can inspect in the game. They showed you what it would look like. There‚Äôs even a description.
---
It's worse than you think. When you exit the game and re enter you will learn there are 9 and several were auto completed. Do the 5 you see before logging out.
---
To that guy... cheers
---
Got a source on that? Not calling you wrong just curious is all, because this bug has been around since the beginning of the game. 
---
Dailies and weeklies before the legendary run were already in the game and suffered from auto-completion for multiple reasons, which didn't reward atoms either. This is the same bug since dailies and weeklies were straight up spun to reward SCORE instead of atoms.
---
There is no legitimate Plan for it. It unlocks during the Order of the Tadpole Quest triggered at Pioneet Scout Camp in Toxic Valley. Try speaking to the Scout Leader at Dolly Sods Campground
---
I guess so lol also can get the forest camo jumpsuit too
---
Explosive bait. It's from a quest for rose iirc. 2 adhesive, 1, copper, fragmine and radstag meat. Make it at a tinkerer's bench.
---
There are some bad eggs, but the amount of positive people totally outnumbers them...
---
So my luck isn't completely rotten?
---
Right. I woulda got it but I thought the ss under armor would be better for NW and to go with the ghillie. And I agree. I'll wear it with the helmet too but it still sucks they couldn't have literally done the same thing for all the ghillie outfits.
---
What platform are you on?
---
Correct. This is the equivalent of a gun that purposely shoots you in the foot. Only while aiming, but that's like 50% of the time. 250 while reloading is different though and actually very good synergy as long as effects don't break in this game again.
---
I farmed it for someone a while back. Found it in a Metal Box at Whitespring Utility Rooms. Might be a spawn in Metal Containers generally. Problem is it isn't named Clean. You can only tell if it is clean by inspecting it
---
:)
---
Between 150 and 200 would be fair. The same amount for the helmet as well. Theyre going for around 30k now
---
PC
---
Honestly though, its just annoying when you come across them
---
Really I've like 100 or more of each already and max caps. I thought they were worth way more.
---
Damn
---
Ohhhh yeah that could work
---
My raider won't wait until they are 90. Don't take a workshop unless you are ready to defend it.
---
happened to me and several others, in one of the earlier threads about it today someone linked this. post an update to let us know if you can still complete them.
---
[https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/daily.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/daily.html)
---
helps you find the camera and mumbles
---
It's better than a nuke because there's no warning.
---
I'm still not seeing a connection.  Consoles only have to load a small portion of the game map at a time. Larger budgets wouldn't effect this. Particularly with the build limits on how close you can be.
---
No. It's a waste of resources.
---
They were until the big dupe. You can  pick up pretty much any outfot for 30k now, at least on PC
---
Caps are a nonsense currency anyway, so maybe they're just falling out of our pockets as we run along.
---
Ahh, I get what you saying. We should be able to have unrestricted weight in our private servers but if it were in general people would have another "war on bethesda" I think.
---
Yeah the gauss pistol is horrible. I made an alt just for that fun specifically and the accuracy is horrible and the damage doesn‚Äôt seem to match what it says it does.
---
I'd have rather had an atomic onslaught version of the chicken coop than half the rewards I got.
---
given the fact that you guys play anyways no matter the content they add, why would they bother.
---
What happens when you decide to enter a public server?
---
Not like I‚Äôve heard that one before
---
Cheers I try tomorrow when get on.
---
I can be patient.  
---
I don't have a melee only character for reasons so the Ammo maker is better.
---
That‚Äôs true to be fair
---
There is no longer a "good chance" for tameable animals at Cranberry Glade (or anywhere else). It has declined to a "slim miserable chance" since 2018. Now you will usually find robots, dead bodies or the new additions: blood eagles or cultists.
---
Also it is unlikely you will see anything higher than level 21. Very unlikely to ever find a mirelurk king (I had on once and it is the best and most durable pet - died in a griefer Nuke).
---
Finally it is very unlikely your pet will live for more than a couple of hours to maybe a week. 
---
I don't know why Bethesda has destroyed this aspect of the game. But it has. It is now very rare to see pets at people's camps.
---
No prob!
---
Read the title.
---
Geez
---
It‚Äôs a game mechanic... deal with it
---
Blueprint your camp. The major parts and then just wander off. Until they leave you alone. If they do. Hopefully they will as they won't have anything to loot as there is no camp
---
Im so sick of players finding you instantly, and /or getting 20-25 kills per game..
---
the cheating is out of control...
---
sigh
---
Regards
---
JM
---
That would be pretty cute haha.
---
wasteland 3 comes out soon.  it looks amazing
---
And now, as level 535, I actively hunt them......
---
The problem isnt bloody itself but the fact so many perks synergies with it, nerd rage and serenity make it strong as heck. Rather than nerfing it they should introduce perk cards that benefit other weapon builds or having more health making them more attractive to use instead. For example having more health could have a perk card that gave you more exp or more ammo drop from enemies
---
Better than ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a new level 13 to the game and today a level 200 came to my camp and at first I was scared he was going to one shot me with his absolutely overpowered weapon but he ended up dropping me 5000 weapons worth of scrip, 10000 Stimpacks, and a bunch of plans!‚Äù
---
My ammo machine is in a room that has no doors and can only be accessed by changing a wall to a door-wall in build mode. Problem solved. As for water purifiers, I don't lock mine - maybe you should do the same.
---
My first one spawned in the overseers house.  She freaked out of course and attacked it.  It ran upstairs.  So now the radstag is hiding down a hallways and I can‚Äôt talk to the overseer as she is holding a shotty trying to defend the house.   Had to kill it
---
I had a beaver and it actually made it to my camp, but didn't even last a day lol. Everything else lives for weeks.
---
The wand company makes some sick Fallout merchandise.  I got my Fallout 76 pip boy kit from them.  They have as awesome Nuka Cola delivery truck you can get also. https://www.thewandcompany.com/nuka-cola-delivery-truck/  
---
Etsy also has a ton of fallout stuff you can get.
---
Oh and I dont use doors unless they are to make a locked room for trades because no one closes them.
---
Curses, PC. Hopefully you‚Äôll get some takers.
---
I mean NMS was a pretty hollow shell of a game that is still being worked on to this day.  Fallout is now a game that is less enjoyable than indy games.
---
This season is the end of the road for me - the legendary run is silly but I did set out to finish off a few things for cosmetics so after this my 76 career is done.  Doubt I'll play after the year of 1st expires soon after season 1.  I'm doing the minimum as is just get pass this last goal.
---
This game has the most amount of BS nonsense with time gating, daily caps, weekly caps, a gazillion different in game currencies, storage caps, etc...  sadly we've told Bethesda since day 1 but they can't ever solve or fix the problem...  ha, and duping/exploits/etc...  yeah.  Its sadly broken and will always be a broken game.
---
please no.  already too much half second guitar riff loop and vending polka
---
caves
---
Ooo alright.  I didnt realuze flux would end up essentially costing that much since i havent really needed flux in anything im running yet so i just have it building up from sbq runs
---
A lvl 7 probably has less than 100hp, so it could happen.
---
They could always make it a bonus based upon the amount of armor pieces you arent wearing say 25% damage boost per piece no penalties. 
---
The damage might sound low. But here is the kicker weightless pieces don't count as equipped giving you the beserkers damage boosts.
---
Because weightless is an armor prefix you would give up unyielding. Sure bloodied could make use of it, but that's true of anything, bloodied builds with a non-bloody weapon can still crank out damage.
---

---
&gt;General: Fixed an issue that could cause Daily and Weekly Challenges to complete themselves automatically.
---
True I could do that. I actually might do that with every lootable I have at my camp so no-one can access them but me. Thanks for the idea.
---
I'm on 1080p .. load times are 40+ seconds on my Xbox One using built in drive.  I can't find any loot in normal areas by the time I've spawned in and been given player control .. Im being attacked.
---
1. There's 9 today.
---
2. There are never more than 9.
---
Ditto. Every single match. 1080p Xbox One
---
Meh, I just ignore posts that don't interest me.  Life is too short.
---
That‚Äôs a good thing then
---
It‚Äôs not usually low levels (relatively speaking), but when there‚Äôs a new way to grief, I tend to get  targeted a lot when I play my lvl 400+ character.  When nuke mine griefing was new, it was an everyday occurrence.
---
With the new legendary perks, moving special points is penalized because perk cards are the new currency. Every special point you move cost you a perk card.
---
Well, I assume it's supposed to project shapes in which case it fails.
---
I'm rank 87 but I really tryharded (min maxed most bonus exp) on the last double exp weekend. I just got the bug today where I lost out on 1000 score. I'm pretty bored of this game.
---
create a new character for the level up challenges, you'll have them done in 10 minutes.
---
But maybe next season they will have the recurring challenge as 'complete x events' as opposed to 'gain x exp'
---
Duper's are scared to provide all the required materials for the pvp Bois, best guess.
---
Sorry man, on Xbox here. Someone should be able to help out though I'm sure. The wasteland is full of about 80/20 good ppl to bad.
---
He gave you a good start up kit nice
---
What‚Äôs your perception level?
---
A self help solution is to blueprint the ammo machine at the munitions factory, take a workshop and build 10. Or so I have heard. I'm Melee so don't need ammo
---
I dunno.  Using green thumb and starting from the junkyard, following the river all the way down to Flatwoods, you can pick up enough stuff to make 50+.  That is, if you craft with chemist and super duper active.  It‚Äôs very easy.
---
This always bothered me.
---
We scavenge things like bottles and cans for materials to craft.
---
Then we eat canned goods and drink bottled items and throw those away just to 5 minutes later go pick up an old can... when we had one.
---
You can hear it when nearby. I have all perks but never used that one. Usually find it after killing a guy and you get the 4 looting early. Sounds like the orange cases but a raspy noise.
---
You have to complete the other story quest with the Free States. If I am not wrong, you should be at the stage where you are supposed to look for Abbie‚Äôs bunker. Enter it, complete that story quest and go back to Rose. That should resolve the issue.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve never had it happen yet. 
---
I always log off before it‚Äôs time to reset them.
---
Not sure if this is common knowledge but you can still damage her just as much in the air. Her resistance never changes. The lower damage while she is flying is due to DMG dropoff at range. When she moves beyond a certain distance (like all enemies) your damage drops on a curve beyond the threshold.
---
I solod the SBQ a few months ago and I have a couple of pieces of advice to contribute.
---
1. Don't take so much gear, especially playing as Bloodied. Your Rads default to 75% when killed so figure out what you need to push your Rads back to 80% and hotkey that item.
---
2. Don't die. Sounds simple enough but Sneak will help a lot. So pump the AGI, use Escape Artist and Sneak Lv3. Drop GunFu and aim for her head.
---
3. Pop RadX Diluted and get in her face while she is grounded to maximize your DMG/shot. The closer you are, the more you hit your DMG peak.
---
Ignore mobs. Utilize things like Crit Savvy, Better Crits etc.
---
I died once during my attempt and seeing her health reset was annoying but spamming non-anim health items and staying close to her got the job done.
---
Not sure what level, you might need a higher level to get you through it
---
Me 2 but had 1 out of 9 auto complete today so lost 250.
---
I think 150
---
Tbh I dont bother with that anymore. I just tag as many enemies as posible with my tesla rifle
---
I've very suspicious of the Mire and the North-East part specifically. It just seems ripe for more expansion. Also [there's a pretty strange thing that happens if you go out of bounds](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hnyfs5/fallout_76_kingsbane_how_to_reintroduce_the_free/fxeelxi/) that implies there was or is plans for a location past the current world borders.
---
lol veterans... The game hasn't even been out for two full years. Relax.
---
Go into the terminal and select the suspicious person report. It will tell you where to go and get your camera in order to complete daily and tadpole missions. Better than server hopping to try and find
---
u/valseek please pass this one on to the devs. Especially the bank. Sooo many of us would like storage between characters.
---
Ok thanks ye I agree before I was watching a nuke go off and everyone was nice there was like 10 people there and 1 person with a gun that has explosive bullets tried to kill everyone but he got anialated because everyone had power armour
---
Yeah but the card is supposed to show it I thought. So still haven‚Äôt seen it and lol I always have volume all the way down so when I‚Äôm on it‚Äôs usually when wife and kids are sleeping so I never have it up. I have head phones but I never knew the boxes made noises. Man been playing fallout 76 since launch and I‚Äôm a noob I guess. But still makes me mad the perk card is 9 points and it doesn‚Äôt do what it‚Äôs supposed to do
---
Helps to have multiple chars. It takes awhile with one- actually a long time first suit was months in. It's 450 tokens , 3 a day
---
The Fortifying Atlas event calls for players to come up with 200,000,000 cork in like 5 days if I understand correctly. I'm guessing you don't have quite that much.
---
They don‚Äôt exist as far as I know.
---
I would like to try out a bow some time, but until they get something to buff the fire rate, my sneak commando is going to do the exact same thing but better. I love multiple ammo types and a change in playstyle would be welcome but I cant justify the downgrade. I already 1-2 shot everything with a 25 mag capacity. So why change over to one shotting everything with a much lower fire rate? I may get a bow one day as a toy, but it will probably never be a mainstay to my build.
---
I did and their grind-to-outcome ratio left me cold. You might obviously feel different, which is fair.
---
&gt;It wasn't a content update.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;It was a full on DLC.
---
No, content update sounds about right.  Things like Shadowkeep, Warlords of New York, Shadowbringers, NMS NEXT/Beyond or the mega updates in PoE or Warframe are full on DLCs.  Entire new zones, classes, game mechanics, etc...
---
Wastelanders was a questline.
---
If your on PS4 I can gladly help out with the nuke launch. Will be on in like a hour or two
---
My List:
---
You
---
No I mean is the creature lvl 50
---
A lot! It's a big grind. 150 tokens for the suit and 300 for the head. Took me a month or so to aquire both.
---
Server hop fixed it for me.
---
i logged on, had 9.  Did 3,  server hopped For an event, only had 5.  server hopped again and had all 9 again, with the ones I had already done marked completed.
---
for me the simplest thing is don't one shot enemies. If possible.
---
The ammo one and the poison and fire resistance ones have me excited.
---
On the queen stay off the fences and tents so she will land. I know it‚Äôs difficult but it makes life sooooo much easier. And a little tip. When she dies get your arse ON a tent or fence fast and clean up the mob of enemys and tend to spawn. It will save u dying and dropping the flux u just earned. Queen will still be dead to loot once it‚Äôs safe
---
Geez overreact much
---
Honestly the best pvp experience i had was with a low level maybe 28 or 38 something this bitch was pulling some wiley coyote bullshit he tried shooting me with a damn missile launcher from that one really big cliff near red rocket every time I killed him I would wonder what weapon he would bring next eventually he tried sneak attacking me with a god damn gamma gun and nearly scared the shit outta me.
---
That‚Äôs the charm of the FO series in general though. It‚Äôs always had several layers of humor throughout its history. Sometimes it‚Äôs subtle and sometimes it‚Äôs in your face, but that‚Äôs what makes it enjoyable imo.
---
I accidentally did this once. I was getting into a bush and couldn't for the life of me figure out why I couldn't move in further, and tapped forward with my super sledge that I had found, because I was like, invisible bush wall?? And low and behold, it was a person and I felt *awful*!
---
My survivor exists solely on Dog Food and Nuka Colas.
---
I think I'm 54 or so? I'm really needing that double score right now lol.
---
Well, technically the grind would still be there. Most people would probably beat Wastelanders around level 40 and for another 60 levels they‚Äôll probably grind bullion until they reach lvl. 100. Then for the bank, it‚Äôs still a grind to get the best legendary. But I see what you mean.
---
For Atlas!
---
My lil opossum lasted a few weeks
---
Does this has been patch or something it doesn't work anymore for me.
---
No but it weighs way too much
---
I know the perk works, I‚Äôve seen it trigger when a player with a nuke case died.  I think you just have to play a lot of games and stay to the same area to get a feel of where they spawn.  I know one spawns in one of the trailers outside monongah mine and one near a tent further down from there.
---
And then you get the dickhead like me that walks in and shuts the door behind me... I end up not being able to fast travel out because of the ridiculous fast travel glitch so I send a message. If it‚Äôs ignored I send another. And if that‚Äôs ignored, I send a warning that I will blow a wall to pieces with explosive bait if they don‚Äôt let me out. When they ignore that I destroy the wall and/or door. I‚Äôm not getting a 5 cap bounty. You‚Äôre paying for the repair costs for ignoring me. It‚Äôs a 5-10 minute cycle if it‚Äôs left to do its thing, so you get plenty of warning.
---
X4 for mining ores with the torso (ignore the description) and +100 carry weight for a full suit, before Cali-Shocks. 
---
Most people have two suits of PA that they use. ExPA plus their suit of choice.
---
I had the Somerset Special. Had it for at least a week or so now. It was favorited. Started playing yesterday afternoon and realized it was gone from my inventory and stash.
---
I try my best to always have a pet. I've had 3 kings. Don't last longer than a week
---
I guess it's the same as other more complicated events, although this mode is quite simple once you understand the mechanics. But as always there is no drawback to ignoring the ores other than missing out on a *slight* chance to earn rare drops because this game runs on the most ridiculous rng system I've seen in any game, other than lootboxes which I'm grateful are pretty rare in games nowadays
---
?
---
Like 6 or 7 on the shotgunner. Base 6, then +3 for herd and -some for addictions. Non vata build, and they run all the shotgun perks. Except for enforcer I guess, hut that shouldn't matter.
---
I haven't even gotten the miss bug on my PA heavy guns toon, who has a GS because it's good withoutperks. They have like 4 per. Base 3, herd, addictions. Since they're a heavy gunner, they don't have shotgun cards equipped (most of the time)
---
Talk to him and it starts his quest line theres multiple quest you have to do for him before that one clears
---
This ‚òùÔ∏è
---
Don't encourage people to use exploits, especially since you conveniently didnt say that doing that permanently fucks up your C.A.M.P. and screws with the server load.
---
They have been tweaking the rate as they go (adding extra challenges, adding more double score weekend - there's another one coming linked to ATLUS - and a double challenge event).  So the original maths that came out in the first week or 2 of this has gone out of the window, and there are more bonus events still to come.  So I don't agree it's impossible - it's actually easily done with just a casual grind.  That said, I don't completely disagree with you and my hope is that they will be able to take what they have learnt into Season 2.
---
I just crafted 120 explosive bait to use on trolls, I'm watching you lol
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs most likely the NW bug. You know what‚Äôs fun? Doing Vital Equipment with this bug on, before I realized what it was. Because of the constant percent notifications, I had a constant stream of bass music in an area that I knew that other players or NPCs were not around. It was maddening!
---
I've always found it annoying you can't fast travel to Vault 76 or your CAMP when overencumbered. You think those two would be exceptions.
---
yeah i was always running out of ammo then found camps where I could get .308 rounds and shotgun shells sooooo much cheaper than NPC merchants and machines (which often didn't even have what i needed).
---
my thanks to these players as well :D
---
Are you trying to solo/duo her on a private server or something? I've seen at least a dozen people show up for the fight each time over the last month or so and she's died within ten minutes each time
---
I've returned recently, as of about a week ago, and I've never once had a daily glitch, all mine show up every day correctly.  
---
I've also never tried NW yet, as from what I understand NW is what causes the dailies to be botched.
---
LOL, oh no I have to spend a wood to repair it! Why do you shut the door? Why did you do it a second time?
---
Oh ok I see. Maybe I‚Äôm not spawning on their location
---
I posted it about a month ago and got so much abuse lol, probs deleted it now
---
I said do it at a workshop. Fuck server load.
---
If you have the recipe for the Savage Divide one, ironically, one of the best places to farm it is Marigold Pavilion. I have my camp there and I love that I can just run around and get all the stuff to make disease cures. There are also firecaps that spawn in that area ... there are a ton of firecaps near slocum Joe‚Äôs too!!
---
Public server. Usually with at least 3+ 200+ level players. Success rate is like 1/5
---
Just wait till you find Lucky Hole Mine.....
---
There could be place for this legendary especially for some sort of dungeon.  
---
I could see bashing to get some sort of left 4 dead monster off another player being a thing if they are smart.
---
In a new PVP game-mode,  it would be handy for silently killing downed players or enemies.
---
Its rude to join an event and then not help out.
---
Cries in 15 tokens. Can the suit be gifted? Really can't be bothered to grind. üòÇ
---
I uhh, I don't recall needing to send nukes with your permission?we can send nukes wherever we want. Pretty sure Bethesda made an event involving nuking to fissure site prime with the idea of people nuking it. Okay buddy?
---
Thanks; unfortunately I wasn't able to complete them and when I logged back in they were autocompleted. Hope this is fixed by Patch 21 but seeing as how I'd imagine they'd be broadcasting that fix coming in advance that probably won't be the case.
---
For example, on Uranium fever -- if I'm sole protecting a device -- should I not be just wiping out all enemies attacking my area?
---
I'm assuming this doesn't count for low-level events unless low-level players are there, at which I can be a supporter to them as much as I can.
---
I always find it odd that they completely removed Vault 96, instead of just the content associated with it.  I mean, they sunk time and resources into creating that environment, at least leave it in there as an instanced dungeon in the same vein as The Burrows.    
---
I wonder if the public teams could be used as a form of matchmaking for Vault 96 now though.  Just add a new party category for it and off you go!
---
Level 535....I kill her every single time, and I am a high health build.
---
My level 99 alt kills her all the time too, same.
---
No thanks. Not interested in an exploit.
---
I usually get myself a bounty of 100 caps or so and wander around aimlessly going to usually busy areas  I don't do it often because I'll usually keep the bounty for a couple of days and it gets boring
---
So any advice? Or are you just here to lie
---
acid(2/per), aluminum (5/per)(to feed my minigun and gauntlet building habit, can't ever find enough run out constantly), lead (2/per)
---
Fallout 1st made them so much money that they redesigned and expanded Wastelanders.
---
The Xbox loading gap appears to be as high as 30 seconds... It's not even funny
---
Very bad post
---
Edit: and with legacy weapons, extra downvoted
---
I like mindlessly mowing down ghoul hordes with my heavy weapons.
---
I mean, that's lead, but still.
---
whats a fair price for flux
---
I mean regardless I still have 20% phantom weight since last update. Hopefully its fixed soon.
---
Maybe that is where the unfinished Vault 96 would come in. Supposedly has tons of animals stored there. The atomic age Ark. Would be a cool way to introduce different creatures
---
"lol" indeed, you must've expected someone to have a different opinion to you saying not to nuke the queen, just cos you're sick of it doesn't mean we are too
---
I can solo Encryptid, so don‚Äôt go there.
---
What weapons are you using?
---
Do you pop psychobuff or psychostats?
---
Be careful when doing this though. If you have a large elaborate map, it may not let you place it down again. The annoying 'this item needs support' bug.
---
That has happened to me a couple of times.
---
Noone does collect ore. They are all filthy XP maggots. üòÇ
---
Go deeper.
---
Like I said, Bethesda is performing "meta-trolling" and acts like Vault-Tec would do in our world to make us fell like citizens from Fallout
---
Platform and timezone may be a factor. I'm PS4 and EST, I've done about 8 Queen fights in the last month and they've all had a high turnout and been successful
---
Each one of those munitions machines you put in your camp permanently reduces your budget by 5% per machine.
---
After level 142 the game becomes totally different, but we're not supposed to talk about it.
---
I've explored the whole thing, but I'll google it.
---
Did you find the Interloper?
---
/ not advisable for combat
---
I would not say that - at L223, if I need PA, its Excavator.  Sure, the stated DR is a lowly 242, but the hidden resistances gives me significantly better survivability than my (polished heavy metal) armor, which is DR 336.
---
TLDR; Excavator has served me well ever since I got it.
---
This is the #1 reason j won't collect ore anymore. I went from  being the only guy that usually did it because I didn't care about the XP, to one of the guys going after the XP. At this point I don't even care if the event fails, because I'd rather have the XP from the kills.
---
Massive failure on Bethesdas part to punish the guys that are needed to finish the event.
---
Raw wolf meat is all you need!
---
Yeah my main building is 6√ó5 platform by 3 storeys high. It's normally okay but then mainly use the cable towers dotted around the map as my locations to plant my bases. Keeps me in a boundary.
---
First let me tell you that you can fuck right off, if I want to nuke Fissure Prime, I will do it.
---
If you don't like, tough shit, I didn't invite you to MY party. 
---
Then next ist just conjecture, but I think not a single player asked you to tout a cryolator. If you can't cryo the SBQ, do damage, AND survive the adds, then fucken kill the adds and in between damage the SBQ.
---
You can also try to stand up high on a tent or the fence, IF you don't aggro the SBQ or stagger (unequip Tank Killer) her.
---
And yes, I can complete the event, it is really really rare when I see it fail, and then it's usually some fucken idiot that staggered the SBQ. Patch 20 has nothing to do with the failing.
---
IT'S THE FUCKING IDIOTS WITH THEIR DUPED WEAPONS AND TANK KILLER WHO DO NOT KNOW WHEN NOT TO SHOOT.
---
doesn't matter if it gets destroyed tbh BUT if you're at one of the outer devices and nobody else is around then just go ham. 
---
BUT this is just what i do.
---
I had that happen to like 3 days ago. I quit out the game immediately and waited 5 mins and logged back in and it was fixed. I dont know if that helps any one, but I hope and wish everyone best and no auto completing one dailies.
---
I had a pretty cool experience the other day, since you brought up solitary players. 
---
Uranium Fever started and I went right into it. At first, I was the only one there. After a few minutes, two other people showed up. When the legendaries spawned, whoever was closest used the follow me emote and then everyone got to tag it before killing it. 
---
It was a pretty cool experience and completely different from how the Fasnacht and other legendary events had happened in the past. One shotting and cutting other players off is what drove me to solitary play to begin with.
---
I'd like to be able to play that mission in the glassed caverns tbh
---
i have a bloodied bow sneak build. it is fun, but frustrating at times. you get overwhelmed by multiple enemies at times. doesn't work well in a team. rate of fire keeps you from getting many kills in a group. vats is super inconsistent. 
---
i do love using ultracite arrows though against the queen. i sit back in stealth methodically laying into her. 
---
honestly i don't know if i love it.
---
  If you push it, with the right perks, you can carry a little over 1820 in Excavator before you are reduced to a crawl.
---
So then mr. wise, when is the correct time to shoot? Literally nothing about my strat has changed. At 150 I could basically do it myself. Same gun, same perks. Something changed, so please, include me
---
And then crying about being banned for doing nothing wrong. Yea.. That is a great idea.
---
No?  But I'll google it.
---
Aw man you said it better than I did. Bringing up good points lol. Bethesda make the event nuking fissure site prime for a reason, no?
---
To be fair, the queen fight is crazy to try solo I think. I'm only a level 110 but I'll solo run silos all day and nuke fissure prime on PC. Have killed the queen in all but one instance and usually there are a crew of players who will show up once scorched earth starts. I always nuke far enough south of the fissure site to keep the little bunker to the north out of the blast zone for fast travel. I have a prime 2 shot gatling plasma with all 3 maxed heavy gunner perks and a prime 2 shot gauss rifle with all 3 rifleman perks for the queen fight. And T60 power armor set. If you've got a decent group you can kill her in 5-10 minutes. I've seen it done in as little as 3. if theres only 5 of you it'll take all of 20 to 25. Had a close one this morning that took 28 minutes before we took her down but I was late to the party for that one.
---
Also, doing any of the three Enclave events when they pop up awards you a commendation each time you complete them. Bots on Parade and Dropped Connection are very easy to complete solo, and its faster than hunting stars exclusively
---
Im level 192 and was at a level 57's camp who was full of 300 mounted head plans which made me mad so i equipped that one perk with 80% to camp items and i used my bloodied 50% limb dmg deathclaw gauntlet and he hit me so i hit him back and ignored him and started destroying his camp and i was doing 9320 dmg per hit and once i was done i killed him and he left the server. He started it first since i never start it first.
---
You can be level 50 and do the same damage as any level beyond 50 with the right setup. Nice post buddy.
---
u/UndeleteParent
---
Or, if you're tired of the event, just don't do it...
---
Thank you this is by far the most helpful comment
---
It‚Äôs a reward from Beckett‚Äôs questline. So, not exactly rare since everyone can get one, but if someone lost theirs and wants a replacement, they may pay a good amount.
---
Proven BS, standing on the fence does nothing, UNLESS you draw aggro. Then she can't land...
---
The real problem is those fucken idiots with Tank Killer equipped and who shoot her when she's about to land.
---
There's the Emmett mountain hazmat suit that's pretty rare as well.
---
Everyone gets one from the questline.
---
I believe it's a quest reward for finishing Becketts personal quest line. I think it's the only way you can get it unless someone sells theirs.
---
Yup, the concept of tagging a legendary was pretty new to me -- and partly drove me to write the post.
---
5 caps for Fixer plans is a bit low...
---
They sell for 10K caps - the only real issue is by now most everyone already has the fixer plans and the new players from Gamepass probably don't have enough income to warrant dropping 10K on one plan *yet*.
---
Cool. Keep doing things like this
---
It wasn't.
---
I think it's 4x ore harvested from mining nodes.
---
Example, if you need Lead, goto Lucky Hole Mine with the Excavator PA.

---
"SADLY IT WASN'T ME" that was the comment
---
You bet your sweet ass we do!
---
^ this
---
It turns the handmade into an old school AR-10 clone with a couple cosmetic differences (and an understandable difference in caliber).
---
Lmao that‚Äôs random
---
If the group is good follow the lead. Wave people over to legendary. If there's luffagus one shot everything.
---
They failed.....and it was up to MODUS and the Enclave to finish what they started.
---
* Line in the Sand... Do not repair the turret
---
* Uranium fever... only tag the management
---
* horde... if you are not alone, only tag the boss and then kill the adds
---
* SBQ... Don't shot at the SBQ while she's in the air, let her land. Unequip Tank Killer, staggering keeps her from landing.
---
I‚Äôm not trying to solo it, I think that‚Äôs a misconception in the post. I do serious damage against everything else minus the queen. Whenever I join the event it just seems empty, and I‚Äôve failed it too many times now. That‚Äôs why I made this post, because every time I do fail it‚Äôs the same reason. I‚Äôm the only one shooting, and I can‚Äôt focus on the ads and the queen. All I was looking for was some advice and it‚Äôs already turned into a huge ‚Äúfuck this guy‚Äù
---
My only consistent warning for new players is the game doesn‚Äôt have any training wheels on it. They fleshed out the lower level quests and added a bunch of NPCs to add direction but before that you could really struggle to just figure out what to do until you were past mid 30s. 
---
There is plenty to do, just the sandbox nature of the game can leave you confused about what is the most worthwhile way to level and play through story content. 
---
Same with understanding vendor money pools, resets on scrip/caps/dailys, legendary weapons‚Äô worth, upgrading armor, weight management options, trading with other players, running the more challenging events, etc.
---
Thats what I'm doing right now, glad they're easy enough for a low level like me
---
Small guns bobble
---
The one step forward, two steps back era.
---
I never thought of following them I Usually just leave them
---
I always pictured them as being some sort of sugary hard candy.
---
There is always a chance of legendaries spawning during Bots on Parade, so you can potentially get double commendations.
---
THEN WHY IS IT GREEN?!?!
---
I‚Äôd be happy to join them only to stab them in the back at the end
---
thanks ... realized I've been guilty of repairing the turrent in LitS.  D'oh.
---
Which I often don‚Äôt. But this particular time another high lvl messaged me to join. I stand on the fence, that‚Äôs about all I got.
---
Good ideas but the bank would need to have like a 30lbs limit to prevent it being used as a ‚Äúsecond stash‚Äù
---
And the majority standing on the fences are well heeled using exploding plasma gats and B2525 fixers. Drawing agro. Then as u say she can‚Äôt land. It‚Äôs far from bullshit. And yeah blasting her on the way down doesn‚Äôt help matters either.
---
Force of habit. I always close the door. In my own camp, in buildings, in real life...
---
I have a couple that say that - but I know one was a system/game generated Reward at the end of a Fascnacht parade and the other was from from the Purveyor.    
---
If that phrase is indicative of a cheat, then what is the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù verbiage to indicate a legit explosive weapon?
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I was thinking, that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt mention scrap.
---
It‚Äôs definitely a fun backup!
---
Also use a Shishkebab to heal the npcs, if the event doesn't fail so quickly, you have a chance to earn more xp!
---
Main quest line is actually really well written if you take the time to enjoy the story. 
---
Problem is main quest line is given out mostly by robots, holotapes and reading, so your enjoyability will depend on how into that you are, or whether you play fo76 by just following quest markers.
---
Difficulty will skyrocket after you get to the east side of the map, then it will slowly become easier when lv 40-50+
---
About a year ago when there wasn‚Äôt a recent or active dupe going on I found a BE Gatling Plasma as the only weapon a vendor was selling for dirt cheap. Check them all!!
---
With everybody and their momma wielding explosive plasmas and lasers nowadays nobody cares about doing the event right, just show off their newly acquired JE‚Äôs and fill uo the place with ash and goo üòù
---
I hate it when people don't play the objective. I don't mind delaying it, but I want those rare rewards.
---
Damnit, did I forget the part where you get to spent some bullets?
---
If I really have to draw you a plan for that, please please please stay away, you sound like you've turned off pacifist on purpose.
---
ok that's fair indeed,but did they put in the light section,when it gives off basically no light at all? It should have simply been a decoration.
---
You can buy the tokens from people selling them.  You can also buy the outfit if someone has it up for sale.
---
I think this advice better applies to legendaries. Ordinary mobs honestly go wild, except maybe on low level events if there are low levels around trying to get hits in:
---
If ever there was a time to say it, it has to be now.
---
Git gud!
---
why tf would someone want to do that? .-.
---
My friends all have 1st and so do I. We play adventure and NW. NW is literally a free add-on to the game. You could hand out $100 bills on the corner and some people would complain they are hard to break.
---
Been there once since Wastelanders never been back.
---
What console
---
Read the OP, he uses the cryolater, prolly together with Tank Killer...
---
And now that we can no longer cripple her, this tactic no longer works.
---
Right? I‚Äôm thinking the same thing lol. Fingers crossed because my pandemic goal is to play all of the Fallout games (haven‚Äôt done anything before 3 yet).
---
As Patrick once said, "The inner machinations of their minds in an enigma".
---
Great. Thanks for info. I'll keep a look out.
---
Make a new character and level that up to lvl 3... Takes 10 min max: Sprint out of the vault... Talk to the NPC's, go to wayward, kill guy, talk to duchess, go out and build the sign + discover 2 locations or kill 3 enemies.... For NW level up: Use said new character, turn off "fill team" and hide in a bush for 10-15 minutes, and do something else in your life between zone shrinks...
---
I got a bobblehead in a Lootbox a couple of years ago - can confirm that they're not sugary hard candy! 
---
Not that I tried eating it to avoid having to go to the gym or anything.
---
Just do a check on the other players before you join. If it looks like they're high enough levels to complete it, join in. If not, just ignore it.
---
I've only seen it not complete once but there's usually tons of higher levels on the servers I get put into.
---
Will be fixed after the event. üôà
---
https://thumbs.gfycat.com/SpotlessRightCopperbutterfly-small.gif
---
I left 6 different serums in some folk's house because I bought from him a bloodied hunting rifle too cheap
---
I hear this after every SBQ
---
Yeah, it's another 'ghoul slayers gamma gun'.  These developers are pretty bright...
---
Always assume its cheating/hacking on PC. 9.9/10 times it definitely is
---
They show up under the MISC tab I believe.
---
Then it‚Äôs a bad strategy and bad weapon to use.
---
Personally, I use a Zealots LMG with Limb Damage. Give me 60 secs on the ground and I can get her to mutate.
---
Has not happened to me (so far) either(ps4)
---
Although today after a server hop, 4 of the 9 disappeared from the list.
---
Relog fixed it.
---
This happened to me before. I didn't realise this is what caused it. My ally costume completely disappeared
---
Not super rare but very demanded
---
did you glitch your budget?
---
well since all the haters are tired of the game and have moved on the only ones left are actually really nice
---
Nope. Don't even know how to do that.
---
This is another example of a design flaw @ bethesda tm
---
If you actually do what needs to be done for the event, you get very low xp and reward.
---
If you kill everything, instead of playing the event, you get massive xp and loot, even if the event fails.
---
Nah I feel you, it‚Äôs just hard to see when everything dies in 1 bullet that‚Äôs why I used my lever more than my handmade
---
Never thought of my camp as a "trap camp" till you came a long
---
If there are others around try not to one-shot legendary enemies. Have fun. The End. 
---
If you have a strong build, you might consider carrying a weak weapon for tagging.
---
Oh that's cool, I haven't experienced anyone trying to kill me yet, but I'm worried about when it will be cause it will obviously happen, and I found a suit of power armor with like level 30 armor that I can't use so I'm worried about losing that, I took the armor off and just used the frame, until I figured out I could put it in my inventory
---
It happened with a stalkers minigun that I had in stash too that I was gonna scrip. Its like they just took it and I got no caps.
---
Finally, someone with the guts to help.
---
Well yeah, it is a trap! Until they fix the fast travel bug anyway.
---
No, it is not an honest roll. Any explosive effects on a bow that dont come from the explosive arrows mod is a hacked/cheat weapon. Avoid it like the plague.
---
Scavenger Traders in random spawn locations can occasionally sell the plans. But it‚Äôs not common.
---
If you do the event solo, then it's no problem, but with a full team those turrets eat up kills and cost XP .) Same with the SAM.
---
I like Wastelanders and had a lot of fun with the quests.
---
With that being said they cant wait 8 or 9 months for content.  The stuff in game we currently have has been done to death.  I'm tired of tea time and the like.
---
They need to balance large DLC drops with small events
---
The big thing I want to see is content that allows the players to create their own fun.  Expanded camp budget, multiple camp modules that we select prior to loading in, faction related community teams, faction quests and challenges that award faction related rewards, etc, etc.
---
Caps mean nothing. I go to any camp with a decent looking selection thats a high level  player (sometimes lower levels if they have a shitload of stuff since it may be an alt). I have everything I'll ever need (minus a B50C15R Compound Bow which apparently doesn't exist): ) so I just go to vendors to see if I can flip something or get something for a friend
---
I'm a half assed bloody heavy build who only plays on public servers.
---
I've had many successful queen fights since patch 20. Today... yesterday... pretty much every day.
---
I show up. Kill mobs while she flys around. Shoot her when she lands. If there's no mobs I shoot her in the air. Simple as that. There's no secret.
---
Like, I want to go full-on DOOM SLAYER on the wasteland‚Äôs assess.
---
Even a main menu option would be great. You can pre team before hand, or just go into the matchmaker solo. Once you have a team, everybody loads into a room with all the crafting stations and stash box. You make last minute preparations and ready up. Probably too clunky for fallout, but it would have been better than having to rely on Facebook or reddit to form a team.
---
 I have a couple of hair brained ideas as to why they removed it. Everything from stopping people from continuously exploiting it to being able to try and shift its rewards to wastelanders to try and salvage what content they can and just drop the rest. I really hope they fix it, but given the track record.....I am really starting to doubt they will come back. Especially now that they are starting to focus on factions, I highly doubt they are focusing on raids anymore. The only thing that gives me hope is that they havent done away with vault steel...yet.
---
Well someone has to get the ore or you fail haha
---
I don't think I'd be able to kill them if that happened, need 1 more enclave event
---
We‚Äôre happy to help, we understand the grind. We were all you at one point.
---
I have a free grab bag station at my camp. I also drop stuff for lower level players when I come across them. Just pay it forward when you get to a higher level.
---
That‚Äôs basically what the daily challenges are already. This feel way too much like a mobile game for my liking.
---
Fallout 1st doesn't have that option.
---
To report any players takes an act of Congress. I reported a player who was In free roam because he kept finding me and killing me for no reason and when I would attack him back nothing would happen even t rough his level was 20 below mine. I reported him and then I got sent an email asking for screenshots, time, date, address ect...
---
I care.
---
Yep happened to me this week on my weeklies too. There is nothing you can do, I‚Äôve gotten better customer support from activision. Honestly soured me a bit on a company I‚Äôve been supporting and defending since arena.
---
Supposedly it may be coming
---
Even in fpv you can not sneak while running. Sneaking can only be done crouched...
---
I got you fam. Are you on Xbox? I‚Äôll give you 2k regular 2mm EC for free. It‚Äôs taking up too much space in my stash and I don‚Äôt use my gauss minigun or shotgun anymore.
---
I also thought of going meta with the whole concept and scanning for particular fractal 3D sets that various game cultures or factions would be built around. You could perhaps begin to simulate artistic taste this way in user created input/objects.
---
If you think the game is too easy go into the savage divide.
---
Yeah thx for the dv, you can't crouch (sneak) while running in third.
---
Player level and decent stock.
---
The best stuff I ever find is level 50-60 players.  They usually have a lot of junk and a few gems mixed in.
---
I try to keep my machines stocked with A and B tier stuff.  Great primary rolls and decent second and thirds, or Poor Primary rolls and god rolled secondary and third stars.
---
A lot of time I have scrip too priced cheap to sell and it helps Im right next to Sutton station.
---
Where‚Äôd did you hear that?
---
Side mount for optics that comes up and over the RAIL THEY ADDED TO THE SKIN.  LOL.
---
Still really like the skin and only realized the rear sight was missing because of reddit posts since I always have had a reflex on it.  A new gun would have been a lot better but I'll take it I guess.
---
Hope I'm not too late! I run a heavy bloody gunner build. https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=c127e9b&amp;d=c72sq2s32sr2ir2ip2a72a01lt2l71a12lu2s12eh1ib4cu2pq0lg2a80sg2&amp;m=1c29fe3d6i&amp;n=PvP%20heavy%20tank%20build this is my current build overall it keeps up with both defence and offence. If you got any questions about the perk cards in play or that are not in use feel free to ask. Always happy to help give a build ideas!
---
This is still happening? Hide yo wife, lock up yo venders, they glitchin everyone out here
---
Armor.
---
I'm always on the hunt for rare outfits, no matter what the player level is.
---
We had an Osmosis kit. Had. I need you to get it back for me.
---
All the timers are the "bonus"
---
Caps, scrip, score, bullion... you have to login everyday or you lose out on a days worth of currency.
---
From the developers when I asked them at the last ‚Äúask me anything‚Äù on Reddit.
---
It would be fine except for the last 2. If you could control damage output and input then you‚Äôd have to make it so no XP or loot was gained while in the private server, which would also fix the 2nd one because if you could control night and day you could make it always night for the nocturnal effect
---
My assumption was that it was only for the private server, and not the standard adventure servers. But I understand what you mean, wouldn't want that leaking all over regular servers either. I agree that the characters made for those custom ones should stay within them IF the rules could be adjusted for that. I just think that it's dumb that there is no customisable experience of any sort. 
---
Truthfully, I just miss the tension of survival mode.
---
Pipe pistols
---
&gt; I hate that you have to stop running to crouch in third person
---
This implies quite the opposite .)
---
Yeah I know what you mean about switching perks out, but the only major change I would make is to take super duper and green thumb out and just swap when you need.  Maybe pop a couple of points from Luck into Perception to get rank 3 Concentrated fire (worth it imo).  How come you don't run bandolier? Are you energy weapons only?
---
Get rid of some of those endurance perks and put bloody mess and dodgy, i notices when I started playing you take way more damage because you‚Äôre right in people‚Äôs faces so you want those damage reduction perks and the extra damage from bloody mess is always useful, also if you have good armor barbarian is all you need because 5 points for 50 dr is not that much. Use one piece of vanguard armor and it‚Äôs pretty much the same thing. But other than that it‚Äôs pretty close to my bloodied unarmed build, it does so much damage it‚Äôs ridiculous
---
Hmm
---
The only thing I would suggest is having the grounded mutation. 100 er but lest energy gun damage
---
Or maybe he just likes things the way they were before the war? They don‚Äôt bother anyone, they‚Äôre just  farmers and he probably just wants to safely raise his daughter. I wouldn‚Äôt want random people trespassing on my property either, even after a nuclear apocalypse. I‚Äôd be glad he doesn‚Äôt shoot you on sight
---
Do you have a link to your comment just out of curiosity?
---
Yeah I was thinking I'd use it for hip fire, but then if I'm berserker's and low DR I'd want to be stalking and what the hell am I doing up close? I scripped it.
---
"You know, we actually have a few of these osmosis kits, but that's besides the point."

---
Yes, they're very useful and easy. Just wish they'd show up more than once an hour
---
Same.
---
Take it from an immersion stand point. Some people can just run out of the vault faster than you. Based on current projections, none of you will become overseer anyway.
---
I care too.

Good reminder for where some of these items can be found üëç

Bloodied explosive on both lever and handmade, gauss is bloodied 25/25

If you go into your map, then your daily and weekly challenges, under those challenges there are other ones listed. I can't remember which category it was in offhand but there are pioneer scout challenges and possum scout challenges. No quests, just the additional challenges. that do then unlock more things.
---
The skins and dialog are different but you can set like Xmas collector to collect fachnaught treats in the terminal.

Nah I just find that the benefit of chem weight and ordinance weight supercedes ammo weight. I do have bandolier in the deck so I sometimes compare and it's almost always less, I mostly only use .45 and 5.56, exploding .38 for clearing bugs and stuff, doesnt weigh much. 
---
Green thumb is already an alternate, I swap it for concentrated fire when I'm gathering.
---
Does this 'thank you' apply to all players or just the ones who help out new players?  
---
I am just curious to know whether or not I should be happy to be receiving a 'thank you'.

Also how do you change ores to normal stuff. I always end up dropping all my ores because it just collects.

He is an artificial intelligence, who may or may not be plotting the destruction of Appalachia. His systems exist in a Vault under a building that wasn't affected by the war in the slightest.

He did jack shit for Appalachia. Whether or not he is still operational is beside the point.

Finish tadpole challenges and you become a possum

You can smelt ores at a chemistry station using acid, it should be under the smelting tab. And if you look in the event objectives, it says to collect ores. You turn them into the yellow thing at the back end of the middle area
---
Whoops well I have never had Beckett so I guess I have someone else's lol
---
Even if you die you only lose junk. And in adventure you can turn on pacifist in your settings (you cant harm nor be harmed by other players). Even if you don't turn on pacifist, the person who starts pvp suffers a very high penalty on damage unless you fire back

He failed when he didn't realise that Eckhart was only interested in nukes before he even released the super mutants from West-Tec.

Oh that's a relief

Carnivore is key for maximum damage

Top class. Thanks for info. Was thinking about how to go about things. I really don't take advantage of private server workshops. I could make so much materials taking certain places and get loads of plans and items defending them

Bloodied if you want the most damage, junkie's if you still want to 1-shot everything but don't want to be a walking corpse.

How are u not one shotting everything with a BE handmade

Eckhart was the legitimate civilian leader, per MODUS‚Äô programming. Colonel Santiago screwed everything when she tried to destroy MODUS when she launched her coup.

But this part of the country didn't get nuked, at least not until vault 76 opened.
---
I‚Äôd be happy if they made ALL the weapon and armour skins and costumes unlockable for completing certain quests or milestones and then left all the camp stuff to the Atomic Shop, its crushing when you see so many cool outfits on the Atomic Shop but you‚Äôre a broke ass student.
---
I believe you read what I said wrong
---
Someon's bored at home
---
They come into your room and try to kill you if you‚Äôre a high level they r pushovers
---
The atomic shop has had a few different collectrons
---
If you have a mule, you can use it to store food indefinitely without spoilage. Think of it as a freezer üëç
---
Thanks for the input. My issue right now is that I have trash armor so I figured perks was the way to split the gap. I'm betting that when I do end up with much stronger armor I may end up moving back to bloodied anyway. Right now it's just not effective.
---
I mean... most players engaging in PVP just have legacies, especially after the huge duping event that happened. If you want pvp, play NW, not base game.
---
But to answer your question for good builds... bloodied and junkies are meta.
---
Oh no I hope they don't get rid of "The Messenger"!
---
Everything dies in one bullet either gun why would I not use a lever
---
Sounds like they, were definitely trying to get you into some PvP. You should have casually stored your junk, change a few perks to PvP....then rain down hell on them as soon as the 'wanted' bounty popped up (for picking your locks). I am not a PvP either, but I am no pushover in the Wasteland. (I wont start it, but I sure will finish it).
---
She can also spawn at the small campsite East of Crater that you get sent to, to take pictures for the Davenport daily.
---
I would gladly join you in your nuke group
---
I've seen her by the small camp near crater when doing that photo daily for Davenport
---
Nuka Cola is Pre War, Wine isn't always PreWar as it can be brewed, sorta like how Beer doesn't give bottle caps. Fun idea though
---
That only works on polite people LOL
---
Ah ok I c what ur saying but thats the thing I dont think an automatic weapon shouldnt be testing the damage of a lever and nearly having the same damage, the lever can be more fun too but still
---
Sometimes not even that if you're lucky enough.
---
The other day I took over a workshop, completed the defend quest which was liberators, and the xp was enough to make me level up. In less than 10 minutes I had completed half the dailies lol.
---
I tried to but they kept killing me over and over so I didn't have time. Next tume I'll hide and put the perks on lol
---
I couldn't place a floating 1x1 with one stair and a 2x1 on that, 'this item needs support' everywhere, had to break it down.
---
Yup, I've had the same thing happen to me. I guess that lvl 300+ really needed that level 10 pipe pistol and lvl 10 leather armor....
---
I'm thinking of a quick and boring point farming method. I'll see if it works when the perks will be released in 2077.
---
Exactly.  If you streamline it, it doesn't take that long.
---
And you made a good point, I just feel that making me play NW for Adventure rewards is not a way to get me to play NW more.  But if I had the option to place my camp in NW or complete a daily event in Adventure.  I would want to play NW.  I don't play a ton both my characters are NW Lev 4 &amp; 12( I won last night with just 2 left on the teamüôÇ and got a whole level in one match)   I had to play last night for my SCORE, I should have wanted to. Adventure Lev 180 ish main, and alt just over 100, respectively.
---
Thank you for the pleasant and constructive conversation, you are a gem ThrowawayOverseer!
---
Even an axe or hatchet. Ever time I go to a haunted house and the exit has a guy dressed as Jason chasing people with a chainsaw, it's a sure sign that the house will suck.
---
The grenade launchers, plasma caster and 50 Cal MG have no spin up time, not sure about the others.
---
Had trouble around the same time, is your camp at whitesprings?
---
Ya I used ironclad until around level 40 or 50 then split them up, it‚Äôs definitely good for when you‚Äôre starting out for that extra dr. My first character is a bloodied heavy and my second is a bloodied unarmed, the unarmed is so much fun that I haven‚Äôt played much with my main. Also how easy it is to switch to heavy weapon build on the fly is amazing because certain things you kind of need a gun to make life easier, I just carry a bloodied 50 cal so I cover all my bases
---
There is a vendor inside of Crater where all the crafting stations are. About halfway through the hallway is vendor selling the plans too. So seems there are a few locations probably to make it so you don't have to travel far out of the region your playing in
---
69 here only with pve, dont touch NW
---
Pete was shaving his legs to model for the dangling collosus.
---
I swear every time I do this event I am the only one collecting ores and it gets so annoying
---
Sadly I joined this game when score arrived. Enjoyed the game a lot, and really liked how fast the levels went by.
---
As it became slower and slower, together with lost mission bugs, I haven't touched the game for two weeks now, and sadly I don't plan on coming back.
---
Great game ruined by bad mechanics.
---
I've done this event solo and ran the timer out. I've failed it but do it for the xp. I know it's a crap thing to not help in the event because I've gotten all of the drops. But I figure if a player values the drops more than the XP they'll run it.
---
That you can't easily shoot stuff in your face without hip firing
---
Using a flashlight instead of the pip boy's light is much more difficult because it makes a "god ray" that covers half the shit your looking at
---
Not getting stuck in ADS in fpp is amazing (how is this not fixed?)
---
Yes! I mentioned it in the chart but maybe it was too unclear. I run an unyielding set but any DR from it will completely ruin the legendary effect too.
---
Yeah, three log cabins and a shed in a square, fences joining them, cooking bench and communal firepit in centre.
---
This is by design, the grind is the end game.  One also does not have the perfect roll on every piece to do well.
---
Hopefully they'll add more items to buy with gold. I've got what I want so for kicks I bought the Gauss pistol and all its mods. Even with the three gunslinger cards and one other in agility that pertains to pistols, it was a big let down. Game says I'll do 228 damage (I'm a commando) but I only do 15 with headshots on scorched. Right to the scrip bin with that hot garbage.
---
The free items are the *economy white label* product equivalent found in super markets.
---
The game would probably be even buggier. Too many atomic shop items are still not fixed to this day.
---
No.
---
I'll have another!
---
Make it so plans are account wide and ill be happy
---
Yeah i was there after you left.
---
Why I'm the world would it take you that long to complete most of the challenges on there
---
Missed opportunity unfortunately.
---
Mad, what happened?
---
It's frustrating... I deposit the ore as I run past the collection book to screw with their xp farming. There are much easier ways to farm do than that
---
I read the book before it came out as a movie guys üòé
---
Yeaaa but the ghillie suit was free too! They also would've had a pretty rendered texture that woulda been copy and paste but I guess I dont know how it works so...
---
Here here!  Well said.
---
Preach! I can't do it all myself, there's not enough!
---
To be honest, I miss 'Three Dog'. Out of all the games I played, he is the best and most entertaining.
---
Yeh, they were probably really experienced PvPs on alts. They will do that....they know its hard to drag a person into PvP witha lvl 300+ character, so they will create alts that are lower lvl and stack PvP perks to drag high lvls with little PvP exp into combat. Griefers, but they don't mean to be...they just don't realize they are.
---
If you want that look at the one that comes with the Setlers bundle
---
Dennis?
---
I've had that happen to me on my own once.
---
This is probably the biggest turnoff for me for this game. I don‚Äôt want to have to pay 12 a month to not deal with this. I just started I cannot understand why I cannot opt out of having to worry about other people. I‚Äôm trying to learn the game I shouldn‚Äôt have to deal with assholes.
---
It depends on your gunplay style, if VATS is used or not, if the weapon is automatic or single shot and which perks you intend to use the weapon with.
---
Not if RNG is against you on certain challenges.
---
Ending the event before the timer is the reason why people don't collect ore anymore, because this cut off the xp gain.
---
No? It's a better XP farm than event.
---
A lot of shooting.Theres 4 of them in total, levels 50-70 got op tesla rifles, mutations and spam nuka quantum.
---
Update: Even with a Gatling Gun, Gun Fu doesnt do shittttt in a Heavy Gunners perk deck lol waste of 3 perks, where would you put those extra three perks?
---
Exactly my guy, it would be nice if there was an option to turn pvp off.
---
After failing to get 1 unyielding ss chest piece after 70 rolls, I really don't want to go again on the other pieces, it's just not worth it at this point. I'd rather sell scrip or roll for good weapons that has an actual value as it can be traded. I've gotten a God roll vanguard chest piece, but I'm a bloodied build so it's scrip to me as I can't trade it to my full health character or another player that can use it.
---
If you want a super serious post-apoc game, play S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
---
It's way less than what people could get before. Basically you potentionally need to spend atoms to be able to get fraction of that atom back.
---
Its dumb man.
---
This is the first I'm hearing about this. A new shrine will be raised today.
---
True
---
dangit... that was it. should have done the 5 I saw before server hopping - they all were auto completed.
---
Dodgy, it's even in agility
---
They aren‚Äôt the same. I don‚Äôt know what the raider collectron does, but I do know the communist collectron. The communist collectron has two settings, the first being proletariat, which makes it collect food, water, radaways and, for some reason, ball-peen hammers. The other setting is ‚Äúrevolutionary‚Äù, which makes it collect weapons and ammo.
---
We're you in PA?  I have had this too when I tried to see what would happen if I used it in PA.  Instead of saying"you can't do that while in PA" it just crouched me to stare at the base of the thing.
---
Got it, maybe tenderizer?
---
The way I see it I have at least thousands of pounds of scrap metal thanks to that scrap box why can't we have a box for items that we can't take with us into public servers use the favorite system where we click on things to favorite to bring into a public server. But its a good question nonetheless
---
Yeah, like a little score boost would've been nice.
---
It is, they were going around trashing camps around that area felt sorry for one player so I messaged them to see if they were ok.
---
And the people that do that just end up getting all the npc‚Äôs killed. The whole point is to get the rare rewards at the end. If you want to farm xp go do a Whitesprings or West Tek run.
---
Don't say this! It'll go from being a bug to being a "feature"  &gt;.&gt;
---
At this point I'd settle for them fixing the secret service backpack. I bought that damn skin at least 6 months ago and got to use it for about a week before the skin just stopped working for whatever reason. 
---
Bethesda if you read this, there's literally no point to adding cool new things to the atom shop if there's the constant looming threat of the item bugging out and becoming unusable after people have spent money on it. That's how you train to people to not buy atoms.
---
Make it a variant of bloody mess
---
I'm just trying to find comics and a fancy shotgun so it's gotta be a few weapons and misc to get me to come. Price of travel doesn't matter as you can get 1400 caps a day.
---
I don't remember.. I think I may have been?
---
I see you have our missing property.
---
Ward my dude.  It's the fucking wasteland.  I'm sorry, did you sharpie your name on that water cooled bonesaw? My bad.
---
Then don‚Äôt get these items?
---
Idk all I‚Äôm saying is it says the description of it and that‚Äôs it.
---
As far as I know in PA first person you don't get staggered out of firing your weapon.
---
In third you'll get staggered and stop firing.
---
I hate how thanks to the legendary run people care more about exp than finishing the events. I've seen violent night fail because people rather just kill the mobs than finish the event.
---
Bows have two uses:
---
- Flame mod: aoe tag on NPCs for slap damage
---
- Plasma mod: shoot dead bodies to send them into orbit
---
Also: JOIN RADIATION RUMBLE!!!
---
That actually makes sense, thank you. Couldn't figure that out for the life of me. Although I don't use a mule character so I never would have figured it out. 
---
Doesn't bother me if they all go to one person, I just didn't get why they would want that many.
---
Yeah.. it's super fun when it spawns whatever it rolls quarter of a mile away and they all get stuck behind something. And going after them gives the 'leaving event' notice.
---
Om nom nom...
---
Does your username have dudey in it?
---
Yeah, just rank 1 though.
---
Excavator is the only useful PA.
---
I've met it twice, first time it was killed by something else, second time was INSIDE the overseers house, which obviously meant it led me nowhere :-(
---
Yeah, this daily level up and the extra score from XP is putting everything in the toilet.
---
But only the bethesda laziness is to blame here if playing the actual event is less rewarding than killing everything brainlessly
---
Traveling pharmacy?
---
I might not be so bad if it wasn‚Äôt just them trying to sell their ‚Äúprivate servers‚Äù.
---
Me too. I have enough atoms that I can buy out the last 15 maybe 16 ranks, if I do some more atoms challenges. After that, I'm done with this game until fall or winter when some decent chunk of new content drops. I'll jump in during the atlas stuff to grab my free junk but I am but I am burnt out. Time to play some AAA games I'm behind on.
---
I found this out yesterday ...the hard way..
---
Yeah Dudey_Mcdudeface
---
At your level they are murder bats but eventually they stop being as scary.
---
The next season should include a S.C.O.R.E. vendor instead of the S.C.O.R.E. board.  If I want the Raider Tree, Chicken Coop, or the Planetarium Lamp, then I can buy them first and ignore most of the Ghillie Armor skins and Atomic Onslaught skins.  Items like Lunchboxes, Fireworks, Scrip, and Bullion would be repeatable purchases.  So if a person wanted to buy 200,000 Score worth of Fireworks, then they could.
---
This would prevent people from suffering through the dangers of grind and allow players that complete it early to have a reason to still play the game.  It doesn't matter if someone earns 400,000 Score since they would be able to obtain every single reward for the season and be able to purchase as many Fireworks and Lunchboxes that they want.
---
Oh thank you so much dude but I‚Äôm on a PC
---
I've only ever seen the raider and scavenger, are there specific ones that only come in the shop with specific events?
---
I think I found some in the Carleton Mine.  Might have been a drop from a frog or a Mirelurk that I killed in there, though.
---
You messaged me ü§£
---
Yeah exactly though.
---
They're worth no more than the travel cost to West Tek for the free one on the roof. No one has any way to prove they got theirs from a machine.
---
You pretend to be crane by making a sign?  The joke is crane is mad.
---
ü§£ holy fuck! Small world aye.
---
...if i may add a suggestion to use existing bottle: get some high grit sandpaper (1000 or above) and gently sand bottle to give it a 'worn' look, but still remain opaque. As for the label, make your own from construction paper, use a 'white-out' pen for the wording and borders, gently fold the outside borders down about 1/16", dampen folded edge and tear away for a 'rugged' look. Finally, burn a wine cork and rub finger on burnt area, rub on label in various spots and along 'rugged' edge for a 'nuked' look!
---
You can't really ask people to play the way you want. Things need to be more incentive from a gameplay perspective.
---
Unyielding armor is also outstanding with bows and crossbows. I mostly use Bloodied and Instigating crossbows, all using explosive arrows and frames. I don't use VATS much with them as I prefer free aiming from a 3rd person view. All things die with a single shot, except bullet sponges.
---
What?
---
Collect the ore and hold on untill the last 45 second of the event, then drop all the ore. Problem solved.
---
I don't think it's actually in the game yet, maybe the fact that the collectron robots gather it is just a bug. I'm guessing it will be part of next DLC.
---
Don't know why it would, you can't scrap it down to anything else, but if it really does that is terrible thing to happen
---
I'm at 81 today took full advantage of the double xp weekend, but its ruined the game for me and just want to complete the pass at this point
---
Yeah my username is MyUnbrokenSoul ü§£
---
I did the event once with my husband. He collected ore and I ran around with my shishkabob and friendly fire healed the NPCs. The SIX other people there did Jack and the event failed. Of course I didn't even get kill XP.  If I go again ever, it won't be on a public server.
---
I've got dozens of Stable Fluxes in my scrapbox, they still show as Stable Fluxes....so...don't know what you're talking about here....
---
doesn't break my flux
---
The gun runners arsenal, perk.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôve got stable flux stored in my scrapbox
---
Scrap box works fine for stable flux on PS4, I have a friend store it for us after SBQ fights and never have any issues
---
My time with the new system has been limited, but I think I can give you a little more info. 
---
1. Perk slots are shared across all characters, each one can put in whatever perks you want for that character. So one level 300 character=6 perk slots available on all characters. 
---
2. The first rank‚Äîthe card itself‚Äîis available for 0 coins, allowing every character to have some legendary perks immediately. They‚Äôre just not ranked up. 
---
3. Coins are earned per character, so each one has to level up to rank up their cards. There would be no benefit to stripping a mule and no way to cheese the system by just repeatedly walking out of the vault with a fresh character. 
---
4. Don‚Äôt put too much stock in the perk coin costs you‚Äôve seen at this point‚Äîand possibly not even how the system works as a whole. It‚Äôs very clearly still a work in progress. Legendary Perks are NOT coming with Tuesday‚Äôs update. They‚Äôre still likely months away. They‚Äôre reworking the perks now, I‚Äôd expect fine tuning on the costs to be the last step.
---
The only Stable Flux mat that is scrappable is Hardened Mass. And the Scrapbox will not autoscrap it. You have to manually select it and select Scrap. And then confirm the dialog.
---
I'll take it by the downvote, you're having an issue understanding what I'm saying:  
---
**Stable Flux cannot be scrapped. Period.**
---
They cannot be scrapped, because they don'y break down into anything. They will be placed into the scrap box as a normal component.
---
The only thing for Stable Flux that can be scrapped, is Hardened Mass. It scraps to Ultracite. And you have to manually do it. On purpose.
---
Well one can hope they do
---
From what I've discovered with each collectron is that it doesn't matter what skin you're using, each one's collecting abilities (Junk, Scrap, Weapons/Ammo, Chems, Food, etc.) can be used on any of them through the terminal.
---
Only if it involves killing them and not joining them.
---
This combined with the fact u spend 4 useless mins before the game even starts in the vault to map vote.
---
My friends and I never experienced this problem so it might just be you tbh
---
Lol insomnia man. The monotony helps.
---
That's the one! Thank you so much, I was unaware of its existence. It really makes the gun look a lot different huh?
---
Now don't take this the wrong way, but all that sounds like a bunch of selfish reasons lol long story short what you're saying, to me, sounds like you feel as the rewards don't matter because getting that small extra 100 score is more important than anyone around you finishing the event. Now I know in a way its the legendary runs fault for having a gain exp repeatable, but gaining score is not a hard thing to do right now, and putting that above the other players just because, the event will always be around, just comes off as snobbish.
---
Now personally I can do all my daily challenges in maybe 2 hour tops and without spamming the repeatable or doing the nuclear winter challenges I'm already at rank 68. I see no reason to rush through the legendary run because getting those rewards before others doesn't do me any good. I'd rather enjoy the ride and help out others along the way so we have a community to keep playing with instead of being selfish and letting events fail so I can show off that I've finished the legendary run first, and I'm not assuming that's why you're doing it. I am assuming that's why some people do though. If you don't have the time to do all the challenges I might be able to see it not being as selfish but then again you're waiting around in an event just to collect experience for a pittance of score, I'm sure you can easily get at least 2 or 3 challenges done that are worth 10 times that when all completed.
---
Just my 2 cents, you guys will do you regardless lol
---
I noticed she glitches if your near a radio , it doesn't even have to be on. But she's a great voice actor , adore her
---
A biblical plague also provides for plenty of time grindin as well.
---
Often they disappear right before my eyes and I can‚Äôt complete the event because there isn‚Äôt enough material. Bugged af
---
Not if all I want is XP and loot, but turning in ore does bring out better XP enemiy, like the running of the Deathclaws.
---
No offense but I find that hard to believe. The chance of not rolling an unyielding piece in 70 rolls is 1.8%. 
---
I have a full set of random unyielding SS and it took me about 50 rolls.
---
It does actually. Just in an unconventional way. You can drop things in your private world, switch characters and pick it up on the other character by hitting play, then selecting private world
---
Aim down your sites unless it‚Äôs scoped
---
I had a different experience, after I server hopped the challenges that I did not complete were completed without score - NW challenge was not completed. Don't understand the logic behind this bug, it's so inconsistent.
---
When are we going to pan for gold like they showed in the wastelanders trailer?
---
Despite this I‚Äôm hoping to enjoy the game.
---
The best solution whould be dropping in from vertibots but god knows how whould the creation engine handle that.
---
Yes but it's risky, as the world can go down, or your Internet can act up causing the items to be lost!
---
This is not a feature Bethesda intended, heck they don't intend people to trade that way at all.
---
The amount of people who think we are getting legendary perks on patch 21 is too damn high! Lol
---
Sorry to hear that!  This has not been an issue for me.
---
I dislike her as well, I'd be happy with a no DJ station but keep her in still, sorta like an Appalachia station 2
---
I have a bunch of Stable Flux in my Scrapbox.  Never had a problem with it.  
---
&gt;Then I realize that all my flux was still on my person and got destroyed....without any thing even being returned in scrap 
---
This is a very confusing sentence.
---
Don't fix the damn turret at line in the sand.
---
I agree with the other fella who commented, most likely alts because they were too op for their level.
---
It's annoying but honestly I start my day off with a canned meat stew for the exp boost and I grab the lovers embrace buff and then start on my other challenges. If I haven't lvled up by the time I finish all the others I do side quests or challenges until I do. Usually doesn't take more than 2 hours. For reference sake my characters only lvl 252.
---
Just to be safe maybe use the outfit? Might reboot your broken dailies? Other than that I've never seen that happen to anyone
---
You must be lost, because the explanation makes even less sense than your post.
---
Yes, that's why I have a friend wait in the private world for me. It gives them a 20 minute timer which resets when I rejoin. Works out good.
---
Despite the shit players. It is a good game man
---
Ideally I‚Äôd want 3 points in PER so you can at least unlock everything.   Not essential though, but makes progressing the quest line easier.  
---
Bloody mess will be key since you don‚Äôt have all of the damage peeks you would with a 2 handed.  Even then, having that 15% is essential for most high dps builds.  I‚Äôd move some points (at least 3 points) from END into LUCK.  
---
Serendipity or Dodgy will also be useful for a trade off of less DR
---
I agree with that
---
Seems everyone else has no issues with flux. Think it might just be you sadly
---
I have 200 something of each type in there. It most definitely does not destroy flux unless OP found some way to intentionally do it.
---
But its not even a good source of xp.  Far better to just finish the event and go back to your regularly scheduled grinding.  The mob spawn isn't nearly fast enough to make it worth drawing it out IMO.
---
I‚Äôm not big into PVP any more... but getting a decent anti-player weapon should be easy enough. Blap them, then log before their teammates can do anything. If you are on PC, let me know. I can set you up with something. 
---
I see wanted players so infrequently these days. I‚Äôll routinely go find them and kill them as a community service. 9 times out of 10 it‚Äôs some newbie who didn‚Äôt know they were going to get a bounty. I stand on their bag and save it for them (unless they are out for revenge, in which case, game on). Also, fast travel takes you out of PvP. FT away, FT back, blap them again if they start something.
---
I'm 100 percent sure you do because it goes in there just fine.
---
That's really awesome. I love watching the process üôÇ
---
I do, in fact, care.  Sleep better tonight!
---
Is the responders fireman outfit rare? I think I got one a while back but haven‚Äôt looked it up
---
Caps?
---
I live in Mississippi, am on att network.  I rarely have server disconnect issues honestly, but earlier today it was abysmal.  Completely unplayable so I powered down.
---
‚òπÔ∏èShit my rng sucks, hopefully the other pieces won't be so bad then
---
The levelling up takes me a while as I‚Äôm a relatively high level
---
I‚Äôll try that
---
I have never had any major issues. In fact, hardly any issues at all since launch. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on! I‚Äôm trying Fortnite to see if it‚Äôs my PS4, but it‚Äôs better. Worse than usual (normally fine) but not nearly as bad as fallout
---
I've tried equipping the outfit but unfortunately it did not fix the issue.
---
Thank you so much for watching :)
---
Then others would complain that fighting while wearing such an anker would be impossible.
---
i have to deal with them if u are a camp vendor though.  alternatively betheada could let us turn down vending radios like they have for world radio and then i would b fine with it. but im sure they wont ever do that
---
Yeah one of the rarest. Not the firebreathers one though
---
In the beginning, we grind for lvl 50. After that, we grind for more of: It just works!
---
Is the quest active? If it's active try abandoning it then waiting till it comes back up again.
---
Oh wow, then let‚Äôs hope I still have it in my stash somewhere
---
oh got it thanks
---
Did you do them all on the same server?
---
What‚Äôs mezzanine? And I‚Äôll try to talk to the overseer again
---
If it‚Äôs ‚Äòdo westek x times and receive this rare reward‚Äô, then immediately it becomes guaranteed reward and that reward isn‚Äôt rare and neither it‚Äôs appreciated. As long as the reward is the guaranteed result of certain game play, everyone will have it and you can‚Äôt sell it for 200 caps. 
---
This is just like many people complained after Fasnacht, ‚Äòwhere‚Äôs my guaranteed rare masks?‚Äô, well you already got it, it‚Äôs the sun mask, jester, etc, they‚Äôre guaranteed to receive one but they don‚Äôt appreciate it.
---
Yea got 2k in mine that works just fine.
---
So, because I'm not going to watch a 50 minute YouTube video, you're asking why doesn't an AI "perceive" an environment like a player does and make decisions accordingly?
---
Well, it's really expensive.  And it always will be compared to the level designer manually placing "This is where you could take cover" nodes, and then having the AI determine whether or not it needs to take cover.  Am I under fire?  Do I need to reload?  If so, let me seek out one of these cover nodes first.
---
Realistically, this is just an abstraction of what the player is doing.  Your use of cover isn't entirely organic itself.  In a good game, it might feel that way.  You may think that you're the one figuring it out, but often times, its placement is quite deliberate.
---
Yeah, that happens when you use it while you're in a power armor.
---
Removes more.
---
HMM!
---
literally put thousands of flux in my box with no problems. Like someone else said there's nothing stable flux breaks down into.
---
I dump all my ammo for 1c each. I‚Äôll put plans in (no mounted, those are trash), but limited so I don‚Äôt get bought out for resale (I toss circus trailers, outfits, gorillas, pa mods, etc). I scrip my weapons/armor, but my alt sells some. 
---
I could pop some junk on there, but with fo1 it all goes to the bin.
---
While the current way makes you play most, I think a change that wouldnt be OP, would be letting you choose categories. 
---
I.e. buffs which include Vanguard. Bolstering, uny, mutant, noc. Etc 
---
Damage reductions which include all of the creature specifics like hunter. Zealot, etc, even assassin
---
Utility like auto stim. Cham, cloak, maybe even weightless
---
Still a crap shoot but better odds
---
It shouldn't if you take the right chems/perks/well rested/right food and choose the right route across the map
---
I have found the raider versions in raider camps.looks the same but with blood stains
---
I've lost access to a private server while my friends were still in it!
---
Nope, I usally make the usual three per day, maybe 4
---
I‚Äôm going to go try some of this right meow, you are a legendü§©
---
You were only looking for a shady excuse to cancel.
---
The box does not eat flux. If it's not in your box, you never had it to begin with.
---
The joke is clearly beyond you.
---
I think the 20 second timer for both makes more sense. That wouldn't incentivise taking damage and not sitting at low health.
---
Yeah, no.
---
beserkers with nocturnal rolling pin and no melee cards
---
So far there has been santa collectrons(brings toys)
---
 scavenger one (junk or scraps)
---
 commie collectron(weapons and grenades or soup and stims) 
---
fasnacht (alcohol and treats) 
---
then ace the raider(ammo and drugs)
---
Don't use it while in PA.
---
I would do mine in batches of ten or so and usually hit on 1-2 pieces. Considering the actual chance of an unyielding roll my luck was probably better than it should have been.
---
That is rough but good to know. Thank you for the notice. Maybe I will ask my friends to pick my items up from this point forward then
---
I saw one last night. I like to look at camps before I go in and the owner was hiding under the stairs...in a spacesuit. At least put on your stealth suit.
---
But what you just said was people weren‚Äôt happy, who wants to play a game that gives you more grief than joy? I get the rarity thing but I thinks it‚Äôs gone too far.
---
Armor perks should not count again berserkers and there should be some armor sets or outfits that have no DR but a special effect.
---
I almost never get to complete that because nobody collects ores. Instead, everyone just spends wasted time killing the ghouls that the turrets mostly take care of. It's a bit frustrating and a giant waste of time üòî
---
Judgin by the upvotes on the post, I am not alone in that. And you not being able to explain it, does not help it.
---
Fallout NV is my favorite. Possibly one of my favorite games in general. I just have to look past the fact that this game is never going to be what I want it to be and appreciate it for what it is.
---
I have over 1k of each stable flux in my 1st box. It definitely does not get destroyed. I have taken flux out for trade deals and put flux in after queen fights.
---
I‚Äôm on holiday for 2 weeks now, so guess I‚Äôll be spending atoms if I want to finish it.
---
Same here. Futile to try and work on anything productive when I disconnect every 5 minutes.
---
Update, I was too high on marijuana and was wrong. It was in my scrapbox.
---
You're farming junk... go to a lower level area and pick up stuff from boxes and the world. Stop junk farming in high lv zones, those are for xp.
---
What do you even use cork for?......I never see any any crafting items that need it
---
K thanks, I'll try that out
---
&gt;And who‚Äôs still standing?
---
Well, MODUS, but he was pretty damn powerless before you came along, and plot armor dictated that you help him.
---
I appreciate this so much but sadly I'm on ps4 but thank you. Its nice how you do this for people
---
It's not a bug, it's a feature
---
You are punished for collecting. You waste radaways and don't get exp for kills. The rads are so punishing most builds can't even bother going down there.
---
Technically killing everything for xp is protecting the crew so it‚Äôs helping...
---
It seems to only update in your pip boy after you visit a vendor, scrip machine or gold machine and only for that particular currency.  And if you switch characters, it'll continue to display the previous character's totals.   It's very frustrating.
---
Really want to make a " trapped vender" but instead of radiation emitters and flamethrower. Have sheepsquach plushes and sirins XD
---
It's useful for a couple quests if you haven't done them, like finding the ProSnap Deluxe Camera.
---
IMO, there's so much missed potential with it.  For example, this is where they could jot down all the different reset times for Caps, Scrip, and Bullion.
---
Hope it works out for you. Once you have a starting set you then get to do the real grind towards a god set. Then you get the real suck feeling of rolling a god roll piece that‚Äôs cav rather than sent and wishing you played a bloodied melee build rather than rifle.
---
Probably for the best yes.
---
It's best to keep asking for a proper bank transfer system, elder scrolls online has one that doesn't cost a member subscription to access it, the membership just doubles the bank storage capacity!
---
Lol!
---
Okay, You made my evening.
---
oh and add the strobe lights!
---
Thats a good way of looking at it tbh. It is a great game dont get me wrong but it does have its bad points. I dont really play fallout much, only fallout 4 and this are what ive put most time into.
---
Thanks for your post! I needed this as a reminder. I haven't been thinking of using a private server in my need of resources. I do know what I will do this following Sunday.
---
Folks should be able to enjoy the game, however they want to, provides it has no direct impact on others. 
---
‚ÄúRole play‚Äù a raider all you like. Just don‚Äôt be surprised when you get thumped and they run. Folks who want to PvP with you will take workshops. No need to harass folks in their camps who aren‚Äôt messing with you. 
---
Good luck out there. Thankfully this thing seems to becoming extremely rare these days. Sucks you had to deal with it.
---
As it‚Äôs always is for a Bethesda title
---
Story of my life man, igy
---
YES
---
This is true I‚Äôll grant you but it‚Äôs not really immediately obvious. (also personally speaking I just really don‚Äôt like the colors on that one)
---
Huh I had all nine
---
Jokes on you, I‚Äôm a compulsive liar! I don‚Äôt have flux, I don‚Äôt even play this game
---
I honestly just wish the scrap was transferred through the scrap box with my 1st subscription. It's the only thing I really care about.
---
Are we actually not even at the halfway point???? I though we had a lot less time

"Quick, we're doing this Season thing and we need a skin that we can apply to all the armors.  And we need it tomorrow."

---
"Brilliant!"
---
It just works. -Papa Todd
---
At first I wasn‚Äôt so great at killing the ghouls so I relied on everyone else doing it while I ran ore. Now I can kill ghouls, heal scavengers, and collect ore. Which ever someone needs me to do, I‚Äôll try my best. Now, all I need is for people to actually do the event. No one shows up and it sucks
---
Beckett is so creepy when he says that line. I had to stop wearing the Patriotic dress as he would often say that line when my dress flared up showing my underwear.
---
Eh I just explosive shotty them in the face, they stop....
---
A shared scrapbox would be great too, as my unarmed character has no use for junk at all so always has plenty, but all my others are always low on it.
---
Same thing happened to me today. I logged in closer to the reset than usual, but it seems like logging later made no difference for other people.
---
Ahh I see you a man of culture
---
Right?

Lots of people did receive their rare rewards and are happy, just not many would come out and say ‚Äòhey I‚Äôm happy because i just got this‚Äô, although some do. The RNG in this game, although very daunting if you think about all the possibilities, is actually quite generous for some reason. I‚Äôd sure love to get more keepers from the scrips I turn in but I already got many good rolls just by looting farming and visiting murmrgh. I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs a better way to give people what they want. Again, if it‚Äôs guaranteed then it‚Äôs common, just like excavator PA or vault 76 jumpsuit.
---
That just works...
---
I just logged in and they were all already completed. First time logging in for the day
---
Exactly my guy! Everyone should be able enjoy ot however they want to just dont be dick. Its annoying when others harass you. Good luck to you too thank you. Im happy its becoming rarer and rarer.
---
I would buy them all and not re sell
---
It normally happens to me a lot but since I know what I have it never bothers me
---
Much easier and quicker to leave, then come back to reclaim it after that pops up.
---
Yup, kinda the same issue. I wanted to try a new build, made new character, realized I didn't have shit. Kinda sucked for a bit.
---
Have you visited them with the Cannibal perk activated? You can get a nice reaction.
---
The Fortifying Atlas event requires 200,000,000 cork.
---
That's not what I meant.
---
Thanks : )
---
You can have 1500 photos? oO, on PS it maxes out at like 50.
---
Same here.  If I'm in a Radiation Rumble where not a single other person is running, I'll deposit the ore early to mess with them.
---
You'd be surprised how lousy the XP farmers are at protecting the NPCs too.  You'd think that in their obsessive quest to kill every Ghoul that they wouldn't let any slip by, and yet, those six guys in Power Armor blasting away seldom get the job done.
---
Yes on PC. I updated post
---
Shhh. Don't jinx it.
---
Thanks for the feedback folks. I couldn't continue the quest, as it autocompleted when the other just launched as nuke. I looked up the steps I should have taken online, got a card, got 8 code fragments and that then allowed me to access the silo.
---
Fired my first nuke. Was fun.

---
Gun runner, marathoner, action boy, master commando, tank killer, ground pounder and bloody mess. That's my main build but I run a bunch of different ones. The the one card I never take off is gun runner. I even use it on my heavy build.
---
The most valuable cards are the damage, armor penetration and movement cards. Frog legs, gun runner, tank killer, stabilized bloody mess and tenderizer. The hipfire cards are really good too. If you use explosives, grenadier, demo expert. You could also use lock and load for a faster fire rate on the M79.
---
They are selfish reasons.
---
But that's what the Legendary Run did.  It encourages selfish play, as well as playing Events in bizarre ways to maximize XP rather than completing them as intended.
---
It's a shitty design.  And it's only going to get worse with the Legendary Perks.  The fact is, Bethesda has transformed XP into a quasi-currency, and where there's currency, there is greed.
---
It's worth it having it in background making more even if you can make more faster manually.
---
Yo I‚Äôd love to buy that bear arm plan

Junkyard Workshop near Charleston has three junk extractors...

Got some talent there. Top work

Fallout 76 yet monthly update , don‚Äôt confuse the weekly atom shop update for content . Last month we got score , in august update 22 coming and September 23
---
thank you it really means a lot
---
Not as far as I know. Once you get out of the vault. You‚Äôre automatically level 2.  
---
So just kill a few enemies or craft things until you become level 3. It‚Äôs worked for me so far. They can‚Äôt ‚Äúpatch‚Äù it because it‚Äôs just a character leveling up.
---
I'll do believe he have a high luck. With a touch of Unyielding.
---
I didn't keep track. I really don't wanna know.
---
Does anyone remember what the 9 were?  I think I did them just can‚Äôt remember how many there were... even so, I only moved up one board space
---
I did one recently and there was 3 or 4 of us collecting. It was amazing. And the great thing about that was after we did a quick run through at least a tunnel or two we could then join in on the carnage while the timer run down. Everyone wins
---
...or you could just photo mode out and save everyone the headache.

1,400 caps from the robot vendors.

I'm curious if one of mine is considered a trap camp. There's a sign saying 'free mutations' with an arrow pointing to a room that's got a chair quite blatantly on a pressure pad rigged to a rad emitter. I mean, technically it will do as advertised lol.
---
Dude, you need to blame bethesda for the weekly xp score grind. I'm not gonna put on a rad suit when it's far better to tag enemies with my tesla rifle. I'm sorry. I also want to get the damn radiation barrel, but xp grind is far more important as of now. Plus sometimes I don't even wanna grind xp and I go to radiation rumble cause I know I will easily hit that 100 score. It needs to be said, stop blaming others dammit.
---
I'm getting burned out with doing the dailies and I'm still just at 38, started playing again a bit too late.. The challenges need a lot more variety, I'm already tired of the daily routine of 'go to location x because it's a guaranteed enemy spawn for the type you need today, then go buy three individual bullets, grind some xp to rank up, hope to encounter one or three legendaries, claim a workshop, take a picture and you're done for today. I'm not even touching the 'build up', 'decorate' or NW dailies. This season sure has some fun rewards, but the long way to get to some of them is just too tedious to remain fun.
---
I would, but every time I‚Äôve tried recently it hasn‚Äôt worked. If I didn‚Äôt know better I‚Äôd have thought they patched it out.
---
It‚Äôs definitely a problem. I saw another post on here about some guy playing with his SO and he could see that she would visibly load in before he did, and they‚Äôre on the same internet and consoles. 
---
Ah, ‚Äúrocket boots‚Äù confused me lol but you‚Äôre probably talking about the frog legs perk? It‚Äôs good to have but it doesn‚Äôt help me that much in combat because I still suck at PVP haha. It‚Äôs really great for getting on the roofs at Morgantown, though. Oh, and it‚Äôs a perk card that you get eventually ... I think before level 10, certainly before 20.
---
PSA: You can get something more useful than 3 levels, you know.
---
Number 5...
---
You have to go to foundation to start vital equipment, then go to data in the pipboy to track it. Go to crater to start the daily quest there. You also have to manually activate it via pipboy to track it as well.
---
That's a shitty excuse lol you don't need to spam the repeatable exp challenge to finish the legendary run and the daily lvl up can be done easily on a new character or by using exp buffs and perks. Just because it can be done easily by being selfish doesn't mean it's a good excuse. It's like cutting someone off in traffic because you want to get home faster. Sure you get home faster but you screw others over, doesn't mean it's the right thing to do.
---
"How do we get Bethesda to see this?"
---
Just tell them how many Atoms you're willing to pay - the more you want to pay the faster it'll be added :-)
---
I've nothing against the Run. But I think the cosmetic skins should have been quest rewards.
---
I wish they would allow you to spend score on cosmetics you want instead of a controlled path. Then they just need to make cosmetics that arent shit to pair with the already good ones so that when people chose, they arent leaving behind a bunch of garbage and still have a reason to grind everything.
---
It is the wasteland after all...
---
Reminds me of when I used to run around in the skeleton mask and a clown outfit with the flaming chainsaw. It was even better back when the invisible head glitch was still active so I would be a headless clown chasing people around
---
Thank you so much it let me complete the quest and get my rewards.
---
I cripple all the ghouls on my side of the map so they cant harm the scavs. What sucks is people come and kill the ghouls so more will spawn. But if ya just crippled all the ghouls and didnt kill any the event would be easier IMO. 
---
I thought my crippling was helping but am I wrong?  Genuinely want to help.
---
I have a Berserker build that‚Äôs built exactly like that. I don‚Äôt die much simply because stealth is so goddamn strong, but when I do and it all kicks in, it‚Äôs really fun
---
There IS a candy bowl for Halloween. It'll probably make its way back in October. It functions just as the drink bowl does, but with candy and snacks.
---
It‚Äôs the Aquaboy/Aquagirl perk card! I‚Äôm pretty sure you get it by level 10, certainly by level 20. It‚Äôs awesome for the Morgantown map. I recommend having that perk on for Adventure Mode too, it helps a lot.
---
That great! Good to hear it helped.
---
I first bought the scavenger collectron, which let me collect junk or scrap. Then I bought the communist collectron, which let me collect weapons and grenades but ALSO junk or scrap if I wanted. I think each time you purchase a new collectron station, all the possible items become available in the terminal, because you can only place one.
---
Another rule of thumb guys, Friendly Fire (Charisma) affects the Scavs. So please put on an upgraded Shishkebab and whack thwm if they get hurt.
---
Stealth boy and tesla rifles do work in pvp
---
All players who make the community such a great place.
---
My loading screens always seem to be of Meg, and Black Bear Lodge, and the Kelly Monument... I got tired of deleting those after every daily xD
---
Flatwoods was the original and then Morgantown so far. Both are still playable pending the outcome of the before match vote
---
Bug
---
Yes it would. That's an even better idea.
---
Can‚Äôt lie I‚Äôm the guy you hate the most, I use the event for xp only so my fucking build smashes the event and I can solo the full 10minutes of hordes easy
---
They would.
---
Let it be known that if you are able, share the scrapper perk if you can so everyone can get more mats. Obviously everyone doesnt have to do it. You only need one, but still.
---
This... we need more spawns. One of my favorite things about fnv was the unmarked spawns. Death claw island was near the edge of the map and was awesome to discover. Wish fo76 would add more unmarked spawns. No more ghouls too, ive killed way too many of those. We need more mutant , death claws, yaogai, hell even anglers, etc.
---
Bought mine. Makes 5mm. Free mag or two a day. 
---
Worthy for the free ammo. Plus seems one of the more ROI items in the bullion aspect

Oh boo hoo, some music for the 30 seconds you are at a camp will ruin your play session.

It's the fertilizer producer
---
I was wondering the same thing. I logged on earlier this morning to "start" the daily reset timer and checked my 9 challenges. Logged off and got on a few hours later to only find 5.
---
it's in resources called fertilizer producer
---
glittery mess
---
I think it‚Äôs under Resources....
---
I care. Good work wastlander
---
Only. 
---
What is this canned meat stew and where do I get it?
---
thanks. i've done the event several times and never really understood it. yes. i'm an idiot.
---
I don't care if you think it's a "shitty excuse."  I'm explaining why people do it.  Because they want to get it done faster.  Simple as that.  Bethesda's whole Season design is based around FOMO tactics.  Don't act so surprised when players fall for them.
---
Damm I built my camp at the bottom of the hill there and ran that junkyard for months around level 30-50 or so üòÇüòÇ
---
You were talking about it some hours ago while playing! 
---
And yes, this helps explain that.
---
Ya know there is a second shower right?
---
Hell yeah. Could be a cool new faction of sorts
---
Neh.. why would they when you get a portable tent?
---
In the right setting, the classic channel do the trick for me. In a rad/ storm. With the clown outfit and a flaming chainsaw, have fun.
---
aww someone all offended because i didn't like their idea?
---
Feed the people public event. It's one of the rewards from it. Gives an exp boost for an hour, but you can lose it if you die.
---
When a Sheepsquatch started chasing me today, the music went from tranquil to heart pounding. Fortunately, I ran in the direction of a giant hermit crab, then watched the two big guys pound on each other.
---
We try to help out, it makes the game more interesting.  Especially for those of us that have been playing since BETA, we get a kick out seeing a new players reaction to something that we have come to love
---
Bug. When you relog you'll find the missing four all auto-completed.
---
Oh hell yes !
---
Pipe weapons give cork. Go to low levels areas and farm pipe weapons
---
common man don t play it like you don t know, you re not 2 iq? you know how to read? then you can read the objectives in top right corner of your screen during event, its even popping in big in the middle of your screen when the event starts if that s not enough.
---
Who won? I have to know !
---
I think its a Moth man hideout up north that has those and a bunch of cooking pots that have copper
---
Sounded like you were the one getting offended by such a trivial idea.
---
I've honestly never played this event. First, because the glitch when NPCs stole your weapons, and second, because I barely ever see anyone participating, I am a bloody build so it's hard for me to be the first to only player participating. But I REALLY  want to try it!
---
i like when they start discussing about what you did was amazing.
---
Ah i missed that. Hope they bring it back
---
cool
---
I know, I loved it at first but got pretty tired of it being bugged so stopped using it. Phenomenal Cosmic Firepower.... Itty bity chance of it working.... lol
---
No, we still love the game..just want to complain.
---
I'd pay much more than that, even if under leveled.
---
Oh I'm not surprised. People are shitty to each other. Instead of trying to help each other out they rather push and shove to get to the top faster and they don't care who gets hurt in the process. I am not surprised at all, but I'm also not afraid to call people out for it. So act shitty and don't get surprised when someone calls you out for it. Anyways this has gotten off topic now so why don't we give it a rest. If you wanna discuss social interactions we can take to It PMs lol
---
Don't forget the rep if you haven't already capped them.

Thank you.

it a reward from the mama dolce event (feed the people). You can craft better xp boost tho.

Truly art ! If you are a friday fan use the bog wanderer mask or the free radicals and a bomber jacket plus a machete and you can be jason !

Anything is possible my friend. Don't be so closed minded. 2020 is not the peak of everything as we know it. Technology will always advance. I have seen a lot of changes in my 41 years of life.
---
Did they not fix that in patch 20? Or is there a new method?
---
Fuck Carleton Mines.  Fuck that noise. I‚Äôd rather fight a bunch of Wendigos in the dark than have to deal with my ‚Äò[DANGER]‚Äô tag never going away and not knowing when a bunch of high-level radscorpions are going to erupt behind me and take half my health in about 2 seconds.  You know an enemy is overpowered when you can one-shot the ‚Äòboss‚Äô fog crawler but have to spam stimpaks on the ‚Äònormal‚Äô radscorpions.
---
100%. This game is full of anti inmersive nonsense that some people actually love but that is not my case
---
We are in the middle of the fifth week. We have ten weeks total.
---
Basically day 33 out of 70.
---
there are two dailies, you get one per day. 
---
so let‚Äôs say today you went to crater and got retirement plan. tomorrow you‚Äôll get importance of communications.
---
the one to give the riders at ohio river adventures mirelukr meat can be done daily.
---
so, it‚Äôs actually one ‚Äòmain‚Äô daily quest and one minor daily quest for the riders
---
those random encounter are limitless repeatable. some people server hop A LOT to have lits of those to increase their rep.
---
Or you can equip Cannibal perk and tell them you are going to eat them and they will run.
---
Please tell me there‚Äôs a quest where you kill her please please PLEASE
---
I care because I love when people do crazy stuff just to try something out. Stuff like this is what makes this community great.
---
What about the rest of those Raider quests? They give Raider rep too according to the wiki.
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
looks like i hurt your feelings..
---
Should be able to join them lol
---
You can destroy their camp with explosive bait, no bounty!
---
yeah, that's the auto-complete bug no one is entirely sure what causes that one. Mine didn't auto-complete they just don't exist anymore.
---
Some theories include having played Nuclear Winter last before the reset of the dailies, getting disconnected when loading into a server, being online during reset, and hanging in the Atomic Shop or Legendary Run before loading into a server. There might be more theories but those are the four main runs I've seen talked about. I'm sorry that happened to you though, I hope it doesn't happen again
---
Got to love bugs eh?
---
Also 70, also getting burned out. They need to diversify the challenges without making them annoying
---
unless there's a dozen people fighting over spawns, it's amazing exp

I'm just having fun witcha, remember the time you ate the corn on the cob the long way

Now we are onto something! This should be a thing! Rally up a group of misfits, have a photo-shoot and then do some good old fashioned shenanigans;)

That would be much more fun.

Yeah ! This is a perfect idea i got becket in a swim suit and a jester mask

I've found some really good deals at 5 weapon vendors in the forest. Last week a bloodied explosive double barrel for 800 caps. Also found a lot of duds too though.
---
So he started it, how? By having a bunch of useless plans in his vending machine?
---
Well my game disconnected about 5 times before I completely reset on Xbox
---
True, but these two either did not know that or were jokers as it went on (the attacking) for like five-ten mins...I wish I had captured on my Xbox One now lol.
---
It was a weird (but memorable) introduction to the Appalacian Wasteland at any rate lol.
---
Just checked demon asylums video on this, his update was that it had allegedly been patched. But I wouldn't be surprised if people dipping into stash's through vendors is an entire new glitch
---
Since rifleman builds struggle without stealth and crits against swarms, I always just throw on my PA and go do it immediately.
---
Also, suggestion - equip ghoulish. That way, you don‚Äôt need to use stimpacks to heal you up after using the radiation showers, and anything down in the tunnels will have a hard time killing you.
---
And don‚Äôt use strangler PA unless you like leading ghouls on a wild goose chase.
---
anything else?
---
Yep, the retake event is only 1 wave and you get the same end event XP
---
If you're doing all the dailies and weeklies, then you are repeating the XP weekly many times a week.
---
Just side with the raiders at every possible moment. And in the end when you can either take the gold or share it, definitely share it only with the raiders. Gold bullion is way easier to farm than rep.
---
Thx gang
---
The two labeled unmarked are daily‚Äôs also just not marked with a quest market and the encounter ones are random encounters you get at random.
---
Not a problem enjoy.
---
I thought it was the same voice actor but it's not. She does do the voice of Fuzzy Brenda though.
---
Someone created a great google doc for this purpose.   Thought I had it bookmarked, but apparently not.  Hopefully someone will link it.  
---
I think you‚Äôre right on track at 67.
---
Hopefully gamepass grows the playerbase enough the devs actually implement some quality of life improvements. +200 to stash.. even 1000
---
Is it me or is everyone's rain static, when ever it rains now I just have static imagine if rain in the sky.
---
Also, find lev to start his last quest, regardless of what you choose do, you'll get the rep. He should be down in his room at crater.
---
If I remember correctly its till the beginning of September or so. You have plenty of time. Me myself somewhat on the same page. I also don't do NW challenges unless it's something super easy. Today I accidentally put on fill in team and we almost made it till the end without even engaging anyone xD True pacifist way lol.The storm killed us, we were too late to climb the hill.
---
I use a vendor
---
No no1 attacks me anymore it's pretty lonely
---
I hear you. Just changed Becket into: Mr. Fuzzy mascot.
---
I thought it was a fallout boy groupie simulator and I wanted to make sex with the fallout boys.  I thought 76 was the better new version of 69 or something.
---
how?
---
I did the same, but I hid in the medical building. Everytime I heard a wingbeat a little bit of pee came out.
---
Vault 94 was widely known to be a glitchy piece of crap on public servers. If a paid private server is practically required to enjoy your content then you screwed up hard somewhere along the way
---
Well at least you‚Äôre truthful I‚Äôll give you that
---
I had one show up to my camp and immediately try to destroy my punch bowl (Could probably smell the nukashine) So i shot it. Haven‚Äôt had one since or maybe i just miss it.
---
Jesus fuck! This drives me nuts! Especially as a bloodied build, when there are like 5 people with pipe guns in hazmat suits, not doing shit
---
Perfection
---
Hes a pretty nice dragon sometime he will randomly drop gifts of ammo, weapons, junks, and sometimes a decent amount of caps
---
Yesterday some guys contested the charleston station workshop... then they destroyed my camp in the other side of the river... i kill one..jump server. There was no need to dedsroy my camp.. till now, the first awful experience. Perhaps the same f***rs?
---
Some people are just plain c*nts in anything you'll do in life.
---
Dude you just jinxed yourself. Now instead of getting auto complete.. your rewards for daily quests will be negative score.
---
I thought this was a virtual Mad Max convention, fuck
---
I had an incident where I loaded in to only find myself staring at a player in marine armor, pointing a shotgun guass in my face. It was a "Well, shit" moment.
---
Also, the guide I am following says that baseline pace has it at being level 61 by the end of the day.
---
Nice description. 
---
Sounds like it might have had the legendary glow....
---
Before all the PvP balance changes and tse nerf I was about level 150 and had 4 level 25-35 they to ambush me. I introduced them to the TSE pump action. For people that didn't play then I was getting 1200 damage with just shotgun perks on. I took out 2 with 1 shot because they were side by side.
---
I feel like that's the difference between true and stabilized which I get. I'm saying, if you have true barrel and stabilized stock or stabilized barrel and true stock what's the difference that's #1.
---
No. 2 is, How different is that from having aligned barrel and aligned stock? Like do 2 "improveds" = a "superior?" Know what I mean? 
---
Assuming play style, talents and all the rest remain constant.
---
I‚Äôve tried for ages to generate a fixer with a legendary perk without luck. So yes it has value in allot of veteran players eyes.
---
Nah, I just ran silos yesterday. It‚Äôs a little harder with a regular camp door, but if you practice a little it should save you a headache. I check out locked camps all the time with it.
---
You got that right
---
Throw them down next to stuff and it attracts animals and then it explodes.   You can target in vats and blow them sometimes.
---
We try to help out the new players, it makes the game better for us when more people are enjoying themselves.  Will there be griefers?  Yes, but they are few and far between.  I saw that someone let you know about Pacifist mode, MAKE SURE you turn it back on at level 5, otherwise you may run into problems down the road.  Keep a headset handy for when you want to team up, or just leave Area chat turned on, it wil make it easier to find help if you need it.  Welcome to the Wasteland, and if you need a hand, never be afraid to ask.
---
Aligned is a bit of both, stabilized is the best for recoil
---
Very useful info. Thanks for taking the time to test, co.pile, and share!
---
Dis one challeng gaiz tanks for beeng paintent.
---
You just throw the bait and it explodes dealing direct damage to the camp pieces.
---
Who locks their water purifiers? Honestly just wall off the ammo maker.
---
Oh don‚Äôt worry you‚Äôll get 30 million more brotherhood DLC‚Äòs
---
I would absolutely spend whatever it takes to get it. It's so good.
---
Gotcha, so yeah this was meant to be a fix to the original solution but it still persists. It's why we got a ploy for a search on the issue after two weeks since it was still around.
---
Browsing posts here and from my own experience, there's a lot of triggers for it to happen but it's not consistent. It's really weird.
---
I'm sure the NW log-in side of things were fixed, but it's still around and the main offenders are any possible mix of (not guaranteed to cause it):
---
1. Last mode played was NW
---
2. You exited out to the main menu then closed the game, rather than closing the game down while still playing 
---
3. You're signed in during reset hours (biggest offender) or close to by 1-30 minutes
---
4. You open up the legendary run board before entering the game 
---
5. Or, your game crashes on startup
---
There's tons of other problems but these seem like the obvious offenders and if you take precautions with these in mind you'll possibly lower your chances of getting hit by it. Again, it's still completely random for some people it seems too. This is such a shitshow.
---
Every time I go for a can of dog food I think "Nothing like the good old Dinky Di!"
---
Me too. Got a new weapon. Off to fissure site prime and Wes Tec to try it out.
---
Group of four of us run it in two on each side.  One runs the other defends.  Switch do it again then switch sides.  Takes a bit of time but works in our private lobby
---
Griefers gonna grief. Workshops are an easy avenue to PVP. Used to be you could contest a workshop and kill the owner even if they were not in it. So you find the owner in the world, then have a friend on your team contest the workshop. Boom, instant target.
---
Then you are doing it wrong ... the XP is fantastic, you just have to kill fast enough. As there are no waves, it just spawns a new ghoul when you kill one. When I did the event solo on double XP weekend with all the XP/INT buffs and lunchboxes up each ghoul was giving 1500 XP and I counted 170 meat piles after the event. So it was 255k XP in 10 minutes for me. Even without double xp weekend these kills give good XP. But its gets less efficient if more people join.
---
Are you on xbox?
---
Me lol, i want to get a lot of water. I have 800+ right now. Ill wall them both off.
---
That's how they get ya'.  False promises and broken dreams :(
---
If your on xbox press the little button at the top left i think it has got two sqares on
---
I do that except I skip the whole farming, getting water, boiling water thing and just eat whatever is in my inventory until the bar is full whenever I get a red indicator.
---
What do you mean
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4 it‚Äôs the giant middle rectangle button.
---
That's such a nice idea! Spread the kindness. As for now you can just sell them for 0 caps? doesn't work for everyone tho. My vendors are in a different side from the little cafe with a great view I set up in the mountains.
---
If you have the recipe for it, Cranberry Relish is even better. Canned Meat Stew gives a 5% XP boost while Cranberry Relish gives 10% and all it takes to make are cranberries, gourd, sugar, and boiled water.
---
Are you on ps4 if so press the touch pad whilst in the pip boy and it should go back to normal.
---
Guessing the weapon being a piece of junk?
---
Soups and teas are quite legit now after the herbivore buff. You'll end up with +7.5 ap regen, +3 agility, +25 hp regen etc etc just from making food from the standard camp vegetables
---
I use the PA clip glitch, but that requires you not to be able to do the animation but get in your PA anyway.
---
The weapon taking multiple charges isn't a bug is why I'm asking
---
This build is almost the exact opposite of a bloodied comando!   S3, P15, E3, C3, I5, A12, L9 is what I would be looking for.  
---
Other than Serendipity, I don‚Äôt use many defense perks.  I rely on stealth and overwhelming fire power.  Forget White Knight, you won‚Äôt need it, or anything like it.  Just attend scorch beast Queen fights for the 160% repair kits (2per fight.)
---
All Unyeilding armor.  One piece needs AP refresh.  Poison resist and radiation resist are always welcome.  Also one piece of harder to detect while sneaking is nice.   
---
Use Dense on chest and forget about Fireproof forever.
---
Thank you , I had no idea just squandering valuable resources I could have put in my fallout 1st chest
---
Wel ya Live and ya learn , thank you again
---
If your ahead of Zorbo, then your fine. Cus when Zorbo reaches the end that is when the event ends.
---
Just for convenience when they're overcucumbered in an instanced area I guess or if the expeditions in the roadmap turn out to be far areas away or something. Just an idea and discussion.
---
You know, I've been playing since BETA but I'm still struggling to perfect my build. Someone else here gave me a lot of great advice on building a rifle build, and while I'm doing a much better job at clearing a room with my rifles though.
---
My armor though doesn't seem to do much when it comes to radiation.
---
I tried to run to collect the ore in Radiation Rumble before, and I almost died from the radiation in about 10 seconds, even in my excavator armor. I couldn't get much before I had to run back to the hallway to use radaway and stimpacks.
---
To be honest, whenever I'm doing this event, I'm usually the only one fighting the enemies at the first set of shafts. Everyone else seems to be gathered around the second set of shafts killing enemies there.
---
That repo is amazing whoever made it.
---
Not the actual quest, but launching a nuke will be the exact same. The only difference will be no notification of quest completion. You will miss nothing else.
---
Bro there is a block button for a reason people can definetly be annoying but its part of the game block them if u dont want it to happen body them if ur good at pvp...simple, not to seem rude just being honest üëç
---
A bug where assaultrons don‚Äôt have to recharge their laser before firing again.
---
We are on day 33 of 70. You‚Äôre on track.
---
And that encourages others to do the same! However not everyone wants this kindness. 2 fresh players refused my low lvl legendaries and some meds I dropped for them :p well, could be just toons or some people do want to make it on their own.
---
And the assless leather chaps :( so many broken dreams
---
1. Yes
---
2. Hard to do it all, so you‚Äôll have to decide where the right balance is. Commando weapons will overpower shotgun, shotgun is fun though. 
---
3. Serendipity is a must, throw in Fireproof when fighting the SBQ. Dodgy is great, Evasive not so much. I‚Äôd bump up Enforcer over Evasive. 
---
4. Grim Reapers is great, but the extra Unyielding AP will allow you to swap out Action Boy and Grim for others.
---
5. All depends on the fight. Rad-X diluted can get you by more often then not, with Radaway diluted ready to use in you favorites. If things get really bad, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with switching into your Chinese Stealth Armor.
---
as the Emmett Mountain Hazmat Suit can not be repaired its only for collectors
---
Assaultron 2.0
---
Regarding total SCORE points, today or yesterday was the true halfway point, as the score you need for ranking up increases by 50 for each rank
---
edit: or 25
---
It takes multiple charges, I know that isn't a bug.
---
I haven't tested it in 8 months but if I go pull my quad assualtron head out of my stash and spend 1 minute charging it with 20 shots.....are you telling me it actually does 20 shots worth of damage now?
---
Yes YES HAHAHA NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME THIS
---
I use Barbarian Evasive Serendipity for protection.  Dodgy drains AP so I avoid it.  I almost never die playing at 19% health.  I would recommend unyielding armor to max out barbarian and evasive. I don't use blocker because it only works on melee and I don't normally let melee attacks get that close. 
---
My carry weight with 4 pieces of unyielding armor is around 400 lbs with a backpack.
---
I max out all my commandos a 3 and run tank killer and glow sight at a 2.
---
Under endurance i run 1 fireproof aguaboy and radicool.  
---
I would highly suggest the Adrenal Reaction mutation for weapon damage.  
---
Under Luck I run Starched Genes, Class Freak, Serendipity and bloody mess all maxed.
---
I am pretty darned tanks even though I only wear wood armor.
---
VANCOUVER TAKE ME HOME, ALASKA AIRLINES.
---
37, its just a flesh wound
---
Most players are friendly, some even talkative.  Join a team.  Turn on your mic and say hi.  Some won‚Äôt respond, others will.  Last night my team consisted of a friend I‚Äôve had a long time and two people I just met in the last couple weeks via the new team system.  
---
You‚Äôll find 76 is many times more fun with friends.
---
I rarely ever see anyone join the event. I don‚Äôt know why, because I actually love it.
---
This is actually kinda hilarious
---
Disclaimer. Doing this to random people just to be an asshole will get your camp nuked. Repeatedly.
---
Agreed.
---
I always thought the bobble heads were suppositories, but maybe I‚Äôve been using them wrong.
---
Have you gone to the purveyor?  The Event Uranium Fever is good for mid level legendaries.  Riding shotgun is good for higher level, but it only has one guaranteed spawn.
---
I've had around 14 kills in a few games without cheating.  Build a good load out, play a bunch to get aim down and play with a decent team.
---
20% with herbivore
---
I completed the Wastelander's questline and without knowing the consequences I kept most and let Meg have her share.
---
I usually wear my Chinese Stealth Armor. I am overencumbered when I do, but it‚Äôs not so bad. I usually have items to boost my AP.
---
I had no idea.i thought you just had to protect them while they collected.
---
Happened to me too. I logged in at 1215 EST to only those exact 5 dailies. After a few hours, I logged off and then logged back on to find the remaining 4 completed. Such a damn mess.
---
I think you made valid points about what the legendary Run does bad, but it does a lot of good. It really brought me back into the game when I lost all interest after hundreds of hours
---
Shitty design is just typical sentiment from the toxic fo76 Reddit community , that's why Bethesda supports the non vocal majority
---
Oh god
---
There‚Äôs a quest called Hero for Hire where Dutchess gives you a schematic for a Cranes Treasure Hunting Sign to build it to lure raiders to your camp in order to find out where the raiders are hiding.  This is the only quest in the game that can award the Cutting Fluid Recipe.  After running it 10x this morning trying to get the recipe, I looked at ESPN and saw this article about the GM Crane commenting on the sign stealing.  I loled because with only a little stretch you could argue the player essentially steals cranes sign.  It‚Äôs funny.
---
This is a very long post. It may help you get responses to break it up.
---
Lockpick bug - never encountered it; game can freeze now and then, happens in all Bethesda games.
---
Favourites wheel - my PS does not lag when I access it
---
Dying while overweight - they keep trying to patch this, try not to be overweight before you die. They should have fixed backpack mods not applying on death, so it's likely not your perk/mod not applying
---
Diseases - a feature. Antibiotics and disease cures are plentiful. Pick them up, buy them, use pharma farmer perk if you need to farm them
---
Lock picking player owned stuff - yes, it'll make you wanted. This is intentional. It can be annoying to try to find someone to help clear wanted status by killing you.
---
Event ettiquette: people who are nice will try to let you tag legendaries before killing. Mobs are mobs, no one is waiting for new players to tag them. Legendaries depends on how nice people are around you. Its the internet, you can etiquette all you want, it's still the internet. Try to use a faster shooting weapon than gatling gun to tag enemies. Hell, even a  pipe pistol is faster.
---
I haven't done the one at Ohio River yet.
---
I always run to the mouth harp.hoping the others will protect me.because they never play the instruments.
---
Not exactly. It takes 220275 points to reach rank 100.  Meaning you need to average 3150 points each day to stay on track. 
---
33x 3150 = 103,950
---
Anyone that is at rank 61 exactly on the dot is 300 points ahead of the curve.  If they average 3150 daily, they will reach rank 100 by the end.
---
Yeah I've been to the purveyor everytime I have a legendary, but it's few and far between
---
Go to the civil war graveyard - I believe the Yao gai in the parking lot is level 16?  He‚Äôs easy to snipe from where you fast travel in, anyway.
---
Screws: Desk fans, toys, typewriters 
---
Aluminum: aluminum canisters, fire extinguishers, some cans, occasional nodes
---
gears: Morgantown, check behind the counter in the building whereSsteelhearts charging station is located.  Look for boxes of gears (and screws or springs) around workbenches with pegboard tool racks.  Occasionally find boxes at the various workbenches along the road with the arena at Top Of The World.
---
check bot vendors.  I generally bulk anything over 50 or 100 of those items and sell it to the closest bot.
---
Come on man, not common man.  The apostrophe is what goes between don and t as well as you and re.  If a number is below twenty, you should typically spell it instead of typing it in numerical form.  Which to be quite honest, ‚Äúyou re not 2 iq?‚Äù is not written in a coherent manner, you should have probably said, ‚Äúdo you have an IQ of two?‚Äù  You should also capitalize the first word of a sentence.  Between during and event, you should put ‚Äúthe.‚Äù  The version of its/it‚Äôs you used is incorrect.  Again an apostrophe goes between that and s.  
---
So, come on man, don‚Äôt play it like you don‚Äôt know.  Do you have an IQ of two?  Do you know how to read?  You can‚Äôt attack someone‚Äôs intelligence and have that worthless, idiotic drivel that you typed out.  Learn to be polite, you fucking prick.
---
Oh, I care. This will solve the cork issue if some players do this. Thank you for optimizing!
---
I agree and don't take it the wrong way. It's very selfish. But if I applied that logic to this game than one could say playing in a private server is selfish as it helps no one but me. One could also say not even joining the event because I don't need the drops is selfish. We all play with our own motivations. If a bunch of high level players are there destroying the hoards and the low level players are running ore for the drops and it succeeds it sounds like it's a win win for everyone. If high level players are made to feel wrong by playing for XP and not for drops and they stop doing the event and it fails because low levels are running ore and can't keep the hoards back everyone loses. So my suggestion is go to an event and play for what you want. If you want drops get ore. Want xp keep the hoards back. I feel like these things work themselves out.
---
And on the note of rushing the legendary board. Maybe for some rushing to 100 isn't a big deal. But this excludes the following:
---
Bethesda is notorious for effing things up. You're assuming things will be perfect until then end of the legendary season. Ie your dailies and weeklies won't auto complete.
---
Some people like myself are furloughed from work and find themselves with a lot of time. Any day that could change and time will no longer be an option making it harder for those who work to make up the difference; best to get it done as fast as possible so I can.. well get it done.
---
Having kids means today they are healthy and tomorrow they are not. I've gone a long time cuddling a fevered puking child and didn't touch a game. Get my grind on now while I can.
---
The events coming up; the community is going to need focused high level players grinding to get the community events finished. I tend to work my butt of getting things done so I can focus on working my butt off to get the next thing done. Rinse repeat.
---
At the end of the day I play games for myself and have a network of people I help with giving extra plans weapons armor food etc to. I carry low levels often and feel good about it. If I'm selfish for wanting to get XP in an event I don't care if it passes because another person plays and doesn't want to also finish the event that's the life we live and the game we play.
---
Thats new with wastelanders.   Used to be something else there :)
---
Awh lord this is gonna be a tough one but we‚Äôll manage
---
The one off of the tourist.
---
What kind of build are you going for?
---
Thank you! üëç
---
I‚Äôm really not. 
---
I didn‚Äôt say repairing it was a daily challenge but it was part of the original sidequest/mission that led up to the daily+weekly challenges. (Edit: [Looked it up ](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Bucket_List) and it was not repairing it, but it unlocked the ability to craft one. Been a while...)
---
I‚Äôve yet to see a new daily that involves the camera in this season. Maybe I missed those as I have indeed missed a few days. 
---
Do you mean photo mode?
---
I was referring to the ‚Äútake a photo of a cat/chicken‚Äù etc challenges.
---
Yes definetly get this when you have raiders maxed its very handy how can you say no to free ammo
---
I'm actually not sure? I've only just recently started to get more serious in the game.
---
And Project Paradise.
---
Although I don‚Äôt use them, I understand Facebook is where you would look for that sort of group.  
---
There are also some Discord groups, but I don‚Äôt know how to search for them.  You usually need an invite I believe.
---
Ever. It‚Äôs so rare that I see anyone doing it.
---
It's already been done. Last year they tried to push Atom sales by advertising the atom shop in game with a blinged out vault boy at every train station that would open the atom shop when activated. People were understandably upset that it broke immersion quite blatantly and the cut outs only lasted about 2 or 3 weeks before being removed.
---
That's what the quad legendary effect is it's the same with the single action now if it does 20 shots of damage i think it does if I remember right I used to have one
---
I am Become Death's entire quest is just a kind of a walk through tutorial on how to launch a nuke. You didnt miss any special rewards or lore. You can launch nukes anytime. You can hit up youtube etc for a walkthrough of the process yourself. Many will have tips and trick on how to complete it far easier than the "proper" way too if thats something youd prefer.
---
Those aren't junk items. Those are buildable items, usually atomic shop items.
---
This isn't a case of being shitty to each other. If a player decides to actually join the event and grind XP they are at least there doing something. If you did this event prior to the legendary board game there wasn't a soul there! Now's the chance for everyone to get that ore if that's how they want to play the event and get the drops. After legendary this sub will be filled with players complaining there isn't anyone doing the events. And it'll be because players like myself will be hiding in private servers with their friends doing the events successfully so we don't offend public server players and are made to feel "selfish".
---
The event isn't hard. My friend and I can get to 50 ore and keep it alive alone. One more player could get it above 75. I've yet to do the event on a public server where we get it above 75 (which is all you need for rare drops). If everyone plays the game with their own motivations and style the system will work itself out and everyone will get what they want.
---
Well I'll be damned, it actually is working now. I just went and tried it out.  
---
This thing was the biggest piece of disappoint for the longest time.  Kind of gave up on it but held onto it to give myself rads.
---
This would make the game too easy imagine being level 20 ss jetpack armor full modded
---
It‚Äôs not from the season. There is a repeatable daily quest that involves taking photos. Have you don‚Äôt any of the wastelanders questline/stuff for the overseer?
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Photo_Opportunity
---
More account bound things in general would be nice. A safety deposit box to swap items between characters for example.
---
There are hazmat suits available before going in. Better yet, if you have the Chinese Stealth Armor, you won‚Äôt have to worry much about rads and you get a bit more protection than just wearing a hazmat suit.
---
I think they made them annoying on purpose sadly
---
Third person is a must in NW.
---
I've started deploying my camera when I find a shrubbery asset. The 360 view and zoom features let you really confirm your hidden, and are great for watching the surrounding area.
---
The turrets don't even come close to taking care of the ghouls. Plus the ghouls break them.
---
I hadn't really planned on worrying much about stealth, honestly. Seems like overkill to the n^th degree. Really wanted a more run-and-gun build, likely at medium to close range. Hence the questions about defense perks.
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a feature‚Äù
---
I‚Äôve always struggled with the PA one. Slows me down in silos to do biometrics, but oh well.
---
The plans for the excavator power armor are in the R&amp;D area in the basement of Garrahan Mining HQ.   There are a good number of Mr Gutsys and various Protectrons in there, but the main thing is to shoot the laser cannons before they fry you. Just did that a couple of days ago as level 40-something.  It wasn‚Äôt all that hard compared to other spots.  Sneak, spam VATS, and snipe is the easiest way to beat it, which is true of a lot of places.
---
Wait I forgot to add the üíô so my post makes more sense
---
This is my current build.  I started running Strange in numbers and body guards because of the new  Team System
---

---
i start to agree with the other guy about the toxic chumps
---
Happened to all of us today on campfire tales.  I‚Äôve also finished other events without the game awarding me XP or anything.... kind of annoying considering I did all the dailies today and only moved one board space
---
Yeah frog legs.. haha ah well.
---
The solution is obviously to make quest-related plans not-account wide. This could even go to rare plans as well like the croc backpack.
---
Where are people getting all the mounted head plans? I don't have a lot of them and do most events.
---
Except that Secret Service Armor has a minimum level requirement of 50. 
---
Some plans being account wide would be fine, perhaps though. If it was limited to camp decoration items that would be a fair compromise.
---
Any toxicity that I have is due to someone attacking another person‚Äôs intelligence and then typing like that.  Good day.
---
I don't actually believe it does cause I have the chest piece and it crafted to my lvl
---
The legendary run is the only reason people are even doing radiation rumble.  Before this it was a ghost town.
---
I like Vampire + Healing factor mutation.
---
My 2 favorites are a vampire switchblade for general purpose and a FSS ghoul slayers switchblade, which does wonders at whitesprings.
---
Get class freak 2 to offset twisted muscles negative effect on firearms, and a decent automatic weapon to help you with things the fly (vertibots, cargobots, etc), turrets in silos, etc.
---
(I started as melee/sniper, so have lots of PER to support the rifle side.)
---
Lol, didn't account for that, lvl 77 aon
---
then learn 2 other languages before english then you can come back
---
You can actually find Rosalyn in the cells below the Charleston courthouse
---
Good luck mate

Canned meat stew gives me 12% xp with carnivore and strange in numbers on a team.  It amazes me that people don't know what perks are already built in the game.  I use cranberry relish when I can, but it spoils.  Canned meat stew does not.  Also, do path to enlightenment (use berry mentats to find them quicker) for another 5%.  I am regularly getting +22% to +35% alone.  On a team I am getting much more if the team has 4 people on it.  I prefer to be the leader because I will actually switch the team between building and event for the bonus xp.
---
ESPECIALLY if you're rocking the chinese stealth suit with its 1000 rad resist!
---
I go every time it pops and there's usually plenty of others there.
---
I was there and spoke with witnesses and police. Apparently the lad had  mental health break down, something to do with not getting that promotion and a recent messy separation.
---
How should we know op? Haha. 
---
Though some "low levels" actually have glitched NW laser rifles, stealth boys and nuka quantum and will likely trash your lv 48, even when they are lv 5.
---
See here: https://youtu.be/UU6FN7ZxAWg
---
It sounds like you did not encounter a griefer though. Maybe it was just a new player who made a misclick. Ask them next time? Xd
---
Maybe don‚Äôt attack people‚Äôs intelligence in the first place?
---
You cant place in world found objects like you could in FO4. The only exception to that is there was a display shelf Atom shop item (Thanksgiving Shelf) which looks like a hutch that displayed objects in the open instead of behind glass.
---
You can display buildable objects on shelves using a couple of tricks. One involves the placement of welcome mats to create stacked objects which are then glitched into place as a variation of the rug trick thats been around since FO4 at least. The other uses parts of ground where objects appear to sink into, putting the other object on top and then selecting/deselecting the bottom object causing the top one to sink down. Hit up youtube for tutorials on how to do both of these techniques
---
Do you have the Pint sized outfit? The mask works with the clown outfit.
---
It is technically an exploit and in the Grey area of griefing. I don't know why people always suggest explo bait to anti grief, you're no better than them at that point.
---
Yes at least I got that out them
---
Oh that's quite a wall of text here hehe. I'll try to comment on what I can.
---
so the favourite wheel. I personally don't really notice the lag when I open it but it could be because I get constant lag in certain locations so I don't pay attention. you can avoid opening it if you just remember the numbers. I don't know how it works on consoles, but on pc you can just press numbers to use the item that's listed under than number. To make it easier you can open the menu once press on desired number and click assign then choose an item you want from the opened menu. So for example the most used weapon would be on 1, secondary on 2 and so on. You don't have to put stimpacks tho (just in case you didn't know)
---
Diseases are easier to get if your character hasn't rested for a while, is not well fed/hydrated or you've been taken certain meds like rad-away. Also you can catch them not only from diseased creatures but from water if you're not wearing a protective suit or toxic air without  gas mask/helmet.
---
As for accidentally stealing and becoming wanted, there's a weird thing or it's most likely a bug. Most of the times it's red if you're looking at something that can get you a bounty for stealing it, but sometimes it turns white as normal lockpick/hack action. But most of the times it still says "steal". So if you're not sure, just pay attention at what it says. Not the best advice I know.
---
About the legendary events kills. Most of players would be polite enough to hit once and let others do the same, but not everyone. Sometimes it's an honest mistake/accident, sometimes unawareness, most of the times notgivingashittiness, nothing you can do about it unless Bethesda decides to change how this stupid system works. I usually call people and let them get a shot but if I see them killing other stuff without sharing I just do the same next time to those people. But overall it's something that everyone decide for themselves.
---
How my wall of text cleared something a little :p
---
ironically, if you have 2IQ, you quickly aknowledge that only killing ghouls is more rewarding than doing the actual event as intended...
---
I try to but i keep struggling with the rads
---
Sadly not
---
Why don‚Äôt you collect them instead of complaining
---
Before legendary run I was barely seeing anyone even do the event, let alone collect ore.  The exp grind has made it popular again.
---
Pretty sure there is a crit dmg multiplier perk
---
What told you I don't collect them?
---
My 'trap' is an unlocked scrap bot, with a bunch of trigger plates buried under the ground in front of it. I know how to get the scrap without triggering it, but camp visitors don't.
---
So, they go to steal my scrap and a hidden siren blares over their head. That is all, but it scares the shit out of them and they usually flee.
---
Honestly, I don't care if folks snatch scrap if they need it. But I'm also in need...of a nice chuckle here and there.
---
You didn't get invited to many parties before covid, huh?
---
Yep, I see exactly.  I‚Äôve never been good at that build.  It uses like five times the ammo I consume and drives me crazy.  And since you don‚Äôt have many damage increasing cards you‚Äôre going to be even worse off.  I have no idea how to advise.  Sorry.
---
There's a rad shower to the left when you walk into the middle area, and at the entrance there are hazmat suits
---
I dont think they will EVER add the tunnelers and geckos, not do I think they will let our pets be companions in the wasteland:/ 
---
But I will say, we should ATLEAST get different variable pets aside from cats and dogs, that's boring, give us a floater we can name and play fetch with! 
---
I'm assuming they'll work like allys but with food bowls
---
Might be obvious, but Flatwoods and the adjacent Agricultural Research place are great for farming lead, fertilizer, metal, wood, leather, glass, ceramic, and food.
---
i said he was not 2iq and i m sure he understand exactly the event, he is just playing like if he is 2 iq and not understanding anything
---
Since legendaries spawn pretty randomly, the rule of thumb is to go places with many enemies, thus increasing the likelihood you will encounter a legendary.
---
Whitesprings ghoul run, westtek, harpers ferry/burrows are your friends. Grind them until you don't want no more trash legendaries.
---
This thing was capped at 5 shots damage at some point even if charged to 20.  It was uncapped at some point too and would cause health to rubber band immediately.  Pretty much resigned it to a rad dispenser after a while.  So far it's doing 2000+ damage a shot at 20 charges.
---
So far I've only tested it on low level enemies but it used to rubber band those too.  About to take it to the queen and see what the hell is actually going on with it.
---
No pistol perks and not sneaking either.
---
How much mats are required for each donation?
---
do the quests
---
Wait for it to come around in the shop. One of the few clothings worth buying.
---
Yeah I guess I will
---
By saying he does not have an IQ of two, you‚Äôre effectively still calling him stupid.
---
Thought it‚Äôs an atom bundle
---
What if I told you thats its not your internet speed but your consoles performance?
---
I have mediocre internet in my area (15Mpbs) but I replaced my failing HDD in my basic not pro PS4 with a SSD from Western Digital and now I load in faster than a friend who has a PS4 pro regular HDD with a business T1 line?
---
A dunwhich horror dlc would be cool too. Mothman cult seem to be connected somewhat.
---
I logged in today day with 18 minutes left which was enough time too: Join a Group, Take a Picture in Photomode, build like, so many doors, and eat some bubblegum. The only thing I couldn't finish in time was doing 3 events, leveling up, or whatever Nuclear Winter crap that I always skip anyway.
---
As annoying as this is, it is a post nuclear apocalyptic game with raiders and cannibals and mutants (oh my!), so people are gonna be in the mood to cause trouble.
---
It's part of the game. At least they were dealing with the bounties instead of griefing with explosive bait. I know it's annoying that they were robbing you but again, it's a feature.
---
The only thing that stood out to me as scumbaggery is them following you to another server. Never condoned that kind of harrassment and never will. That is when I consider it getting really toxic and downright creepy. Seems like you're going to have to go through the trouble of blocking them.
---
I am unaware if you being in pacifist mode will prevent people from breaking into your locks, but it will prevent them from damaging you or your camp otherwise.
---
Your most likely right. Bethesda likes to play the lazy game with updates but a man can dream right.
---
Pffft, just server hoop and boom all there work to nuke me is gone . Only to the bad people of course. I ain't some monster that's gunna pic on a noob that loves there cute little camp and they're proud of it . Only scammers and trappers
---
Helmets and headwear are not considered armor. They are purely cosmetic. So no.
---
Legendary perks will require a lvl 300 character for all 6 if I remember right.  That should keep many grinding the exp.
---
I'm level 75 and PS4 if that helps. I've been going through watoga a lot and did manage to find a legendary. I've also heard that white springs is a good spot, but I've never had luck there :(
---
Well I think for some types of ammo like 50 Cal, it seems like it doesn't make enough or make it fast enough to really make a dent, given how fast it gets used.
---
According to this:
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/ArmCo_ammunition_construction_appliance
---
The Armco appliance makes 200 50 cal rounds each 10 hours, even though the 50 Cal has a very high firing rate; that's not even one magazine full!
---
On the other hand, the appliance makes 1000 rounds of 5mm every 4.8 hours. That's what got my attention.
---
I don't think it is enough if you're a minigun user, but for the Gatling gun it seems like this may help a lot.
---
silly as it may sound, I wish you could get the option to feed it or give it water as thanks.
---
 lvl330 player here and  i'm proud that community behave like that. Also helping newer players, just couple hours ago gave away like 8 legendary items and dozen of plans  to 2 lvl 20ish players.
---
Never said I was better . Frankly were all dirt
---
ok then understand what you want if that makes you happy
---
I have yes, but now that makes more sense. I have daily quests on ignore because I never liked any of them and got tired of the notifications on login. The standard daily and weekly challenges for S.C.O.R.E is all I was referring to. The last daily quest I remember was the Queen of the Hunt I think it‚Äôs called. 
---
I‚Äôll check through daily quests again to see any new ones they‚Äôve added, thanks.
---
In a few years when we get mods... they'll become reality!
---
I am pretty noobish, I played the game when it first came out and then stopped up until last month. I have no idea what builds there are and all of the new stuff I've missed.
---
That beautiful animal camp to my camp and Beckett fragged it
---
They need to modify the repeatable gain 10,000 xp challenge. Instead of it giving 100 scorepoints, make it give 200 or 250 scorepoints.
---
Agree 100%. 75% percent of the time I go to rad  rumble now its lower levels (alot of 30's brave it), just me, or people solely there for XP which is fine.
---
If I see other high levels waiting to kick it off/fot people to arrive, and  see stealth suits/power armour/or hazmat suits equipped on everyone I expect to run the event.
---
If there are at least two other players properly holding down both access points I'll jump in my hazmat suit and grab my 30 ore, and then assume a guarding position. Sometimes other people will then take thier turn to run ore, other times they're there for xp and legendaries.
---
I onetime grabbed ore, and it back fired. The two level 80-90's defending the scavengers both decided to grab ore at the same time and probably assumed I (at 160) could handle it alone. They didn't realize I was diseased to all hell and out of stims and  ammo because I just ran multiple SBQ back to back haha.
---
Jackalope.  Make it like a REALLY pissed-off, 3x-size radstag with huge hind legs, big bunny ears, a full 10-point rack, and glowing pink eyes that hops, and hops, and hops...until it gores your intestines out.
---
See, the whole level of the owner thing can be tricky. My second Xbox houses my storage/selling characters that are all below level 20 but stock a wide assortment of  3\* legendary gear that I'll never use, but seems too good to just scrip.
---
That's cool! I'd love to go out there one day.
---
PvP can be fun. I'm level 27 yet if I'm feeling PvP I'll melee a level 200 if thats all there is in front of me.
---
You gotta do the "circuit" at Whitesprings. 
---
Start at clubhouse, clear both floors. Exit and head directly north, past the radstag spawn, clearing all of the residences that border the main resort. 
---
Then head south towards the Whitesprings maintenance parking lot/laundry building and clear those there. Next, wipe out the sentry bots. Your WS circuit is complete.
---
It builds up overtime especially if you have multiple ammo types you use right now im using 5.56 and making .45 and waiting for it to build then ill switch thats what I do anyway
---
Thank you, I'm on xbox
---
Tbh idk how that'll turn out with 76. We would be very limited in out creativity due to game performance and what have you. But at least it will be community driven mods.....hopefully lol
---
Alrighty, flatwoods is also good for chems and thank you!
---
Is the permveyor better than farming? May I ask where you farm? I seem to have bad luck at general steakhouse and Harpers ferry. How many legendaries should I expect per run if any?
---
Also I don‚Äôt necessarily mean guaranteed, maybe just like a 1/5 chance after beating a really difficult boss. Things like that.
---
I'm sure there are two schools of thought on that one, depending on your browsing history.
---
I finished up settlers a few nights ago got lazy on the grind
---
If it was really junk, then the junk was already there before they placed their camp.
---
My bad mate, comment wasn't directed at you but people that give shitty advice. "fight fire with fire!" but that's why we're all here anyways cause we each have something to say.
---
Ohh, it was like the nuclear winter vault I'm guessing.
---
why would you play a fallout game and not do quests?
---
And repairing the turrets is so incredibly helpful.  They keep the Ghouls occupied so they don‚Äôt all storm in at once and overwhelm everyone.
---
And if theres no-one there and you dont want to do it alone, fast travel there anyway, odds are people are thinking the same thing and not wanting to go it alone but will join when they see others down there
---
Probably continued fear from when people could steal from your Stash using the vendors.
---
That's why I don't have mine out, anyway.
---
I honestly don't know, I think the main reason was my weapons/ armour weren't very good, but now they are so I'll probably do them.
---
Lol. Ya, that'd do it.
---
He is low key creepy. He keeps seeming unassuming and reformed but it's a whitewash. He has done horrible things and he's just trying to act like it didn't happen.
---
I'm on to you Beckett.
---
1/ Berserkers needs to boost to 100% max.
---
2/ The type-based need to go to 50% (x-slayer)
---
3/ Unyielding needs to not apply to INT, similar to END
---
4/ We need an armor prefix for Berserkers that reduces DR to 0 for that piece and formalizing using armor instead of using broken
---
5/ Stop magic weapons
---
6/ Ensure Furious isn‚Äôt hit-location dependent
---
All the corks!!!!
---
I think some noobs think they're duped or something man. I get denied my offerings frequently.
---
They are either scared, or on a mule account and are actually high level.
---
Friggin A! Never too stale because people still don't collect.
---
That SHOULD be how the event works. Marion hired lazy dipshits, but get all up in arms when they die
---
Give it a few hours and it gets boring. I tend to put my own ambient music on. Stuff from fallout 3 and games like the long dark (hardcore survival game)
---
Considering how the dupe actually worked, that line of logic is incredibly flawed.
---
Big iron should be in this game i know it ain‚Äôt canon but fuck it
---
They should do a multiplier on how many ores you turn in, so base XP from event is 1k, then every ore you turn in after that adds another 500 or 1000xp, everyone would be rushing to get ores in
---
Accedanally ate of of those when I was spamming purified water. Ran out of water and went to the pie.
---
Thanks for doing this. So many people think anyone with tons of junk are just dupers when some of us just have nothing better to do right now and like loading up on resources. :-)
---
Yes, twice last year.
---
We have had a meat week before but there's another one coming up.
---
I‚Äôve been leveling up a lot through West Tek runs, General‚Äôs steakhouse, radiation rumble, and guided meditation. Use carnivore mutation + (broiled scorchbeast brain, canned meat stew, tasty squirrel stew), being well rested, inspirational perk, berry mentats, and shielded casual under armor. That‚Äôs +6 INT, +10 or +20 bonus XP, +5% XP, +15% XP, +5 INT, and +3 INT. Add a full set of unyielding armor for up to +15 INT.  The level-ups come quickly.
---
probably off of the base damage.. but I have no data to back that up.. its just my guess
---
I don't know what event it was that awarded them, something seasonal I think, that the dupers got them and reproduced them by the millions, it seems like. I wasn't even playing the game when this event happened but I have had dozens of these plans because people just started leaving bags full of them everywhere.
---
To the point, learn English, then come back and insult people.
---
I didn't realize at first that it also turns their blood into confetti. I had to stop and snap some pics of a tent that got splattered in confetti blood last night
---
But in the end, you have already been working your a@# of for those plans. But i see your point.
---
Jesus Christ.
---
Do we seriously still have people that think the only ting keeping us from a larger camp budget is Bethesda being a bunch of pricks about it? 
---
That's not how it fucking works.  Camp budgets exist for a REASON and that is the limitations on the game engine, server load and most importantly graphic processing client/console side.  The larger the budget the more shit you can cram into a small area and the more processing power it takes for everything to be rendered.  Ask anyone that uncapped their settlement budget in FO4 what happens when you go overboard with decorating.  Answer?  Your PC tries to kill itself.
---
Had the same behaviour. After running into the auto-complete bug over Double Score weekend, I‚Äôve kept track of what I do before entry/exit. So:
---
1. Finished yesterday‚Äôs NW challenge last (don‚Äôt do NW challenges before last)
---
2. Logged back in to adventure (don‚Äôt have your last log out be from NW)
---
3. Logged out
---
4. Waited an hour until after the reset to log in (don‚Äôt be logged in over the reset)
---
5. Logged in to Adventure immediately  (don‚Äôt log in to NW or the shop before you see the challenges)
---
All of that has kept me safe until today, when I saw the same behaviour as OP; not all challenges completed, but only 0/5 *displayed* ; did those, logged out per the above pattern, logged back in later and now have the correct count, but the ‚Äúnew‚Äù four are completed.
---
If you are early game then yes every bit helps.    If you are end game then you can get the resources to make ammo much faster and in greater amounts.   I have a ammo machine but don‚Äôt use it because I can craft more faster then using it.
---
Is unyelding armour a legendary affix or is it a type of armour?
---
nah man i can t wait to insult people, learning english fully would be too long
---
Aye
---
they could call it Better Criticals or something snappy like that..
---
Oh! I think I had the camp placement thing too...
---
Yes but imagine like mad max intense shoot mutants moment and then go to stash your junk but a big fake pimp vault boy reminds you that you're in a video game. It was just really bad marketing strategy for in game advertising. Even a billboard or a window in one of the malls displaying what's on sale that week in the atom store would have been a million times better than the atrocity they attempted.
---
Lower level people who use that for caps. 
---
:shrug:
---
I don‚Äôt, but my biggest problem is if I‚Äôm playing serious how to not hit the cap limit too fast without just dropping all aid, etc. and not selling it. My end game is playing AROUND the 1400 and 150 limits ... mule it ... careful buying of plans from vendors to get my cap limit back ... etc. 
---
Thankfully I don‚Äôt have all plans yet, so can still do that.
---
BUT I do remember trying to work and hit my cap limit each day, a problem I‚Äôm kinda happy to have traded for my current.
---
The only one I bought.
---
Nevermind. Still does thousands of damage and the enemies heal back to 90+ percent health.
---
Sorry OP, I know this is not what you were asking about.
---
Yeah I wish I could find a perk combination that would make the chainsaw viable
---
The Better Criticals perk under Luck is basically this. 3 ranks, +20/30/40%. There is no debuff attached to it.
---
I am ready for the return of MEAT Week
---
It‚Äôs a primary legendary affix, so you can find 1* armor that‚Äôs unyielding. The tradeoff is that you need to be at &lt;20% health, so it works well on bloodied builds.
---
I'd like to know these magic games that are pumping out tons of content for less. Only one I know of is Fortnite and that's because it literally prints money.
---
Until I hit rank 100 in score....No. I'm getting 500xp per ghoul and I'm not walking away from that. Once I'm at rank 100 then I'm more than happy to collect ore.
---
I had an encounter rather similar to this. I even posted on the sub about it.
---
*What do you mean the art department just can't code in new quests?!*
---
I mean yeah
---
Until you can craft your own ammo, you really need to save it for when you really need it.  I mean, it does make life easier to just shotgun blast anybody that comes within range rather than getting close enough to hit them with a shovel or whatever, but like you said you end up running out just when you really need it.  
---
IMO shotguns are really a poor choice for a super low-level character because the ammo drops are pretty rare, they have terrible accuracy at this point, and the low range means you have to get within the range of their guns before you can cap them.  A good hunting rifle with either a .44 or a good melee weapon will be a lot more efficient than that, until you hit a high enough level and have enough scrap collected to build a decent CAMP and just craft whatever you want.
---
chances that they post on reddit are pretty slim yo
---
You would better off working towards your other challenges that give atoms for completing. There are quite a few and if you‚Äôve been playing for awhile you probably are close to finishing some. 100 SCORE for 10k exp is ridiculous and doesn‚Äôt sound fun at all. 
---
The best thing about buying the next level is that it doesn‚Äôt change the amount of SCORE you already have and I believe the amount of atoms needed to buy the next level stays the same throughout the event. So get those atoms and save them for higher levels of the legendary run!
---
Change servers.
---
Nah i think it'll be easy, a lot of us have literal thousands of these resources already banked up, especially things like plastic which is literally worthless to anyone with FO1st as its only real use was bulking scrap to store for space, with the scrapbox thats not needed, so i personally have about 7-8k just sitting there not being used and never will be that ill happily be dumping into the donation.  
---
In fact this almost feels like a way for bethesda to drain everyones resources because *maybe* they were telling thr truth about stash spaces making servers unstable
---
I just go to the main menu and create a new character. Takes about 15 minutes to level up once you leave the vault. In the vault, skip all the computers. Just grab the shit and run out. If you need to level up in NW, just take the same character and jump into a new match. If you survive to 10-15th place you will level up. Go back to main menu, delete the character and play with your regular one. I've been doing it almost every day for the Legendary run. Works like a charm. üëç
---
250 is what I keep hearing, thats what I based by 100 donations off of.
---
It‚Äôs amazing! We need it full time !
---
Relaxing will just get us fewer updates. Bethesda doesn't care about the quality of the game, so long as people will still buy their broken atom shop items.
---
The scrap box should be available to everyone.
---
Not enough enemies to slaughter at those places. I can get 20k to 30k XP by XP farming radiation rumble.
---
me and my dad played once, and when he spawned, it took me 46 seconds to spawn after him. He already had a handmade, M79 and a marine armor
---
Then why are you here on the reddit?
---
I had basically stopped hoarding right around Fasnacht. It was soothing to pick up everything.
---
I don‚Äôt mind failing. I‚Äôm only there for the xp.
---
It wouldn't have taken so long except for two reasons. 1. The Creation Engine is Hot Garbage. 2. Bethesda Austin had zero experience with said Hot Garbage prior to Fallout 76. They still don't know how to fix basic things nearly two years later. Of course there is 3. They're lazy.
---
I just hit the 66 space. I'm the same as you, I've only been playing 60, 90 minutes per day. I also only do the easier NW challenges, like move your camp 3 times. That one cracks me up. I quickly set my camp 3 times, and promptly throw myself off a cliff to die. Today the cliff wasn't high enough, so I spent more time climbing back up the cliff to throw myself off a second time, than I spent in the rest of the challenge. Last week I threw myself off a cliff after completing the challenge, and one of my teammates was evidently close enough and healed me which I felt so bad about. Not so bad though, because I just ran to the nearby river and drowned myself.
---
While I have been having fun, I don't like the feeling like I *have* to play everyday. There are other games that I need to catch up on. I'll just be happy if I can get that jet pack.
---
I always collect ore.  Matter of fact, thats all I usually do, but 1 person can't get enough.  Yea, I kill a few along the way, but I only do that event to get rewards.  I can level up on my own without rad rumble
---
Sir, I'll have you know must Redditors know the inner workings of game servers, coding, and marketing. Do you're argument is MOOT.
---
I will have to continue making ammo regardless, I was just hoping this may significantly supplement my ammo needs for the Gatling gun so I can use most of my materials to make 50 cal ammo. I just finished off 25,000 rounds of 50 cal and realized I've been using that weapon too much.
---
Casual groups on craigslist. Just kidding never go there.
---
After 20+ successful runs and still not a single suit or rad barrel plan, I DGAF about collecting ore anymore, I'm here for the experience just like everyone else is.
---
Well the ambience is Good but the radio songs are just repeated from fallout 4. So it's kinda dull for me anyway.
---
Fuck people who one-shot legendaries. All my homies hate people who one-shot legendaries.
---
I did not know this was a thing. New guy here tho. Now I know
---
Sometimes you just gotta vent.
---
Can someone clarify this for me.
---
The rewards for reaching the crazy material goals are the outfits and double Exp stuff, so as long as they get met, everyone will get the rewards. Right?
---
But there are separate rewards for the individual player donating which are the rare plans?
---
Is it known how much each player would have to donate to get the plans?
---
Don't blame his mom for him being a douchenozzle.  Even if he is still living in her basement....
---
How about with each item added to the atom shop a story mission or quest line goes with it. Make it follow lore.
---
We're only roughly at the halfway point AND we have another double score weekend AND a bonus challenge weekend to be earned during  the Atlas event and god knows if they'll end up throwing in another double exp before things are over.  
---
People are still so focused on having to buy ranks (or being forced to buy ranks) when Bethesda has been throwing score at us so much that here I am already hitting rank 80 and realizing that by the time the the double score weekend comes up I'll have been rank 100 for at least a couple of days already.
---
It would make no difference 
---
Applied at the start all buffs are working from a half strength starting value, 
---
Applied at the end, all buffs are at half strength. 
---
In your example is not -50%. It‚Äôs x.50 of value.
---
I like how this solution is so simple theres no way no one could have not suggested it at Bethesda and yet they went with xp instead. Maybe they will learn
---
Ah, bethesdas "here's too much terrible advertisement to get you to buy stuff from the atomic shop that won't work anyways" hahaha.

 If you need lead you can find maps of resource nodes you can plant your camp on online. Saves me so much time when crafting ammo I actually had a harder time getting steel to keep up with ammo production after finding a node to occupy.
---
Thanks, it's expensive but I guess I will get it eventually...
---
Quad means 4 times the ammo capacity by the way.  Quad assualtron heads can be charged to 5x4 or 20 shots at once.
---
Should be a good weapon in theory.
---
I haven't seen a chicken there even on a private server since the first patch post wastelanders.
---
Sounds like you know your problem.   I run a gat and lmg.    I run the gat 90% of the time and switch to lmg for queens / encrypted.    I can‚Äôt just run the lmg as it eats ammo to fast.
---
Same. Plans, plans, plans. Stable flux is a good bonus offering. Sometimes a good weapon or even a trashy legendary that I can feed to Murmle.
---
Yes please!
---
That‚Äôs what I want it to really relate to. Maybe the leader of the cultists worked for that company before the war or something to that affect and wants your help. You can side with him or maybe the raiders and settlers who band together to fight the cultists
---
most will yes, but not consumables like scrap boxes, everything else though yes
---
PSA: You dont need anything that the season awards you.
---
It's a known exploit, that started with heavy weapons. I know demon asylum has a video on it, might find a fix there for it. Otherwise: just try to go through the rounds
---
Do you get different rewards depending on what you do during the event? I‚Äôve only run it a few times (at least once with you) and the rewards have been meh.  I have always just collected the ore.
---
I haven‚Äôt had that lock picking lockup happen. I‚Äôm on PC. Maybe some kind of graphics issue? This game runs in borderless window mode by default. Maybe try changing to full screen mode.
---
I‚Äôve been there with the lock pick get wanted thing. Picked a door lock nearby a workshop. Not even the same building. Ran around for a while wearing a dress and clown hat trying to get someone to kill me.
---
If you're on PS4 I'll give you one. They have no legendary effects anymore but I have a spare in my stash.
---
No, that's stupid. How bout Bethesda fixes one of the myriad of bugs that has been present since launch. Then they can add pretty sparkles.
---
76 compare to 3, 4, and NV definitely has way more silly, wacky, and cartoonist elements. Especially with nearly all the Atomic shop items. 
---
It would be nice to get some black paints for armor/weapons. Or more mature themed items, like technological based camp decorations and appliances. I'd prefer to have my camp look like an intelligent adult decorated it instead of a 8 year old child.
---
I‚Äôve seen it once. Accidentally killed it before the name registered in my old brain. I hope I see one again someday.
---
Damn that‚Äôs some luck. 
---
I had a dream the other night that I completed an event in the mire and got two tattered field jackets. I then scrapped one, got pissed at myself and woke up lmao.
---
lol but nothing spawned
---
Or if they just add a goddamn text chat. I get that not everyone wants to use Mic, I personally have no problem with it, but a text chat would make so much stuff easier..
---
Happened to me too many times to count. I've done it so many times I know where every single one is located, so if I hit every spot and don't have enough to further the event, I know someone is being an asshole and I just leave.
---
They haven't been instanced in months.
---
Leveling your main character will give you more Score (500 + all 100 score per 10000 xp). It's faster and less boring (Imho).
---
Radiation rumble gives half of a level in \~8 minutes if you play with all xp boosts.
---
Eventually they‚Äôre a 2 second kill for some decent XP
---
Radiation Rumble- if people are actually grabbing ore and completing it (you'll see them venturing into the radiation pits) put on a hazmat suit or power armour and grab your fair share IF there is another person there to guard. The orr caps out at about 40 a person, reswans to slowly.  I'll grab about 25 or 30 (1 quick run at each pit) and return to defending/farming xp. If you collect ore wait to deposit it till the end (like last 30 seconds), the enemy get harder with more ore.
---
Uranium fever- a gentleman's event, tag the legendary with a low level weapon to share the kill.
---
One violent night- if someone is playing an instrument it's your job to guard them. And vice versa. Also keep the jukebox running and repair it.  Share the legendary wendeifo kill at end.
---
Camp fire tales- help kill shadows, gather kindling, find campers gear, share kill on camp counselor.
---
Load bearing- I'll usually guard one robot if there are other capable players, if there are low levels I'll run a circle helping them if they are getting downed or cant handle the miners yet.
---
Feeding the people. Help find ingredients and guard one of the three items that need defending. 
---
Some events are too quick to share, and easily solo'd. Prison escape with Malone at the damn takes me 1 minute, there are no legendaries to share, just solo it. You can tag team a horde (super mutants will spawn legendaries occasionally) but if you're the first  and only one there. You dont have to wait 5 minutes to kill the radrat boss if you dont want too.
---
Project paradise-  depending on others level and capability, either fill one feeder yourself and keep said animal alive.. or work with the team to fill a feeder and all of you keep that animal alive. How much you can help during this event really depends on the skill level of others. 
---
Encrypted- Only become a conduit/ pylon if you have a plan to stay alive (be it power armour, full set of troubleshooters armour, or stealth suit while spamming stimpacks and nukaquantums)
---
Guided meditation- I'll defend an area. You can share and tag legendaries here but it's kind of not expected as much as other events. The gouls just aren't stationary enough.
---
And most importantly dont start an event if you see people waiting for others. Revive downed players. And just pay attention to others gameplay. For line in the sand for example if I see everyone else with  minigun and tesla rifle staying in the middle I know their sharing and farming xp and will follow suit.  If its wild, and one person is meleing a spawn point it might be a lost cause and better to just do you and get your kills. Lol
---
Yeah I really wish they would have focused on the new factions instead doing a BOS story again.
---
Haven‚Äôt played f4 in long time but didn‚Äôt you get the nuka bottle and cap?
---
What exactly happens when you try? What does the armor bench say?
---
Tomahawks do more base damage than throwing knives, however arc quicker and travel slower.
---
I do not however know what base is calculated from. I think it may factor in strength, bash, sneak, etc. Untested, but may have primary legendary effect added as well, unnoticeable in most cases as they are clunky and take skill to use but I notice way higher damage on one character over the other when using thrown weapons.
---
Sheepsquatch won
---
I was collecting ores one time and died and spawned outside and I couldn't do the event anymore so I keep collecting but didn't know how much I collected and got no rewards
---
Think I've seen it all with my traps. Had guys try the nuke but like you said, logged out before it hit and recently someone tried to blow up my base with bait. They ran out though, only some walls and bed xD

I have another one on my main but not as good (manually triggered) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9K5n\_3fYlTM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9K5n_3fYlTM). Punji don't work. I dunno what people are scared of unless you're bloodied. Only takes half health, gives you time to tp without a rad emitter to lock you in.
---
Check out kazamati on youtube, he has some really creative ones. There's others too but the punji ones only work on low levels.
---
Does the helmet help with airborn diseases by chance?
---
Same here.  I‚Äôm enjoying the run and not freaking out about it. I‚Äôve never understood the mentality of ‚Äòcompletion-rush‚Äô. There‚Äôs no extra prize for being the first one to Rank 100 or the first one to finish the Vault 79 Raid, etc.
---
I never did Back on the Beat until like last week or something. I‚Äôm level 320. For some reason I do it all the time now and other high levels show up. We all have a blast defending that stupid robot lmao
---
&gt;  multiple camp modules that we select prior to loading in,
---
I have suggested this many times on here, it would be great to have as many possible CAMPs as we want (obviously only 1 active at a time) and just choose which one we want before we log into a server, or possibly be able to switch mid session so the old CAMP fades away into storage again and the new CAMP pops up
---
I rarely see anyone doing the event anymore which sucks because it‚Äôs fun and I never got any plans
---
All I care about is getting the few plans I'm missing. So no plans means I don't bother. If they have 100's of plans, I don't bother either because they are all trash mounted plans that were cool when they first released and were rare but now everybody has them all. I only need a handful of plans, but I'm honestly at the point where I don't expect them in vendors so I usually don't even bother checking out a camp unless I'm nearby or a teammate is at one nowadays.
---
Wait.... this sounds a lot like the infected from the last of us
---
I'm planting the chinese seeds
---
I try to always tag to encourage other players to do it.
---
Not everyone will play ball I feel that demonstrating good behavior leads to others doing it as well eventually.
---
There will come a day when you won't even care about legendaries.
---
It just makes the equip noise then doesn't take the junk or mods it maybe I should try resetting the game maybe that will fix it
---
Found William Gibson!
---
Hackin‚Äò and whackin‚Äò and smackin‚Äò
---
Line in the sand. Right now a lot of guys putting their tents down in a certain spot and scorch spawn like crazy because of it. I don't do it, maybe bannable who knows. But if it's someone elses tent- getting a ton of xp for all 3 rounds.
---
That's only one of several ways to get burned. Sometimes opening the atom shop before going into adventure mode can do it, sometimes being on when they reset can do it, and the POS game crashing the first time you try to join a server can do it.
---
For a quick fix, I go to the overseers house.  Take everything, scrap it, and maybe find a pie in the kitchen.  Next is the fair for those toy cars (screws).
---
I never had a problem with the auto-completing challenges until today and didn't know what it was exactly because I had the same screen where it looked like there were only five challenges total instead of showing four auto-completed. Once I found out that there were still supposed to be nine challenges, I logged back in and sure enough there were four auto-completed challenges. Same challenges too (didn't even log in until 7:30PM).
