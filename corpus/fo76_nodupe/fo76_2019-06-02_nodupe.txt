I‚Äôve been seeing them in people‚Äôs vending machines for fairly cheap, if you want to replace it. Also, you can post on here that you are looking for people to accompany you, or maybe  you can accompany them. Heck if you‚Äôre on PS4, I‚Äôll go with you one of these days. I don‚Äôt have a mic though.
---
---
---
Very helpful, thank you!
---
Damn you beat me XD
---
Gets nuked.
---

---
Legendary Suicider: ‚ÄúIs you even trying?‚Äù
---
I‚Äôm on XB but I appreciate it! Thanks for the help!
---
Super glad to see I'm not the only one who was experiencing getting two "Pacify" options....  
---
Seriously, I thought it  was something glitched with my character :P
---
Np
---
Even then, raiders turned to scorched. Where's all the sorched wearing raider armor? Or even raider power armor? They clearly had access to this tech. There should be Scorched Raiders and War Bosses roaming around. I mean, we have Scorched nurses from the asylum (which was already closed by the time the plague hit), so... why not raiders and the Brotherhood alike?
---
Holler when you get a dope plasma cannon,  can't seem to get one myself
---
It happens with my AAE LMG. No telling how much ammo I‚Äôve chewed through trying to drop mobs.
---
LOL
---
Yep, This is actually more accurate than Flog
---
Just don't shoot the ground at your feet.
---
Agreed.  In Fallout 4 it took me forever.
---
F in the chat for Steve the deathclaw.
---
There‚Äôs no holy trinity so there‚Äôs no need for a healer. That said, you certainly could have a team-based build using a very high charisma, a medic weapon that heals on crit, and just generally be the one in the group aware of what‚Äôs going on. Lots of opportunities to sorta RP/play the role and make it your own rather than having the game mechanics make you that way.
---
Maybe PETDA will actually be good
---
ikr!!! When I take my baseball bat covered in spikes and barbed wire to my wife she screams and calls the cops! Like wtf bitch I get money from the government for u and u do this to me? Let me RP as a baseball obsessed raider, jesus fuck Beth like just let me have this smh my head
---
Maybe something like the radshowers or those medical booths you use in the story for the antidote but instead they give different little boosts/perks, would be awesome and another use for the endgame materials like flux etc
---
Money :)
---
Sounds good! I can try and help with community stuff when I get more comfortable (I used to moderate the Megadeth forums, haha).
---
If you were looking for pocketed I'd have you covered
---
I would love this but not at the cost of stash space and camp budget. Also they need to fix a lot of bugs first.
---
Lol hell yeah ü§ò
---
What a cool idea, I would be all for it. 
---
Could be a way to also introduce legendary power armor components if those will ever be a thing.
---
This isn‚Äôt a tip, it‚Äôs an opinion and it‚Äôs wrong.
---
I‚Äôm on PlayStation, Kyle21gunz but I‚Äôm on very irregularly. I‚Äôll be happy to play whenever I can
---
They definitely should have a preview options for plans like what you get on the Atom Shop.
---
PS4
---
Yes
---
This is the problem with half the complaints from this sub.
---
"I think it's doable"
---
"It shouldn't take this long to fix bugs in a huge online game across 3 platforms"
---
"It's an insult to player to release new content that has bugs or exploits. This is what happens when you make players unpaid beta testers....."
---
Here's the thing about what you "think"..... It doesn't matter. It isn't based off of any relevant or comparable experience. Although this is the internet and I'm sure you've suddenly been a project coordinator for 34 AAA multi-platform releases and never had any of these problems. 
---
It's like going to a mechanic who tells you that your engine has seized and it can't be driven. So you hop in and fire her up to prove the mechanic wrong because you "think" driving a vehicle with a seized engine is "doable"
---
I'm sure the reason BGS hasn't increased server player count isn't because they just don't want to, even though it's doable. I'm sure they aren't struggling to fix bugs because they just can't be bothered.
---
How much does it affect?
---
Depends on the level of your card
---
Would there be a noticeable difference between a max level demolition perk and no perk?
---
that would be cool to have more players on the server, even if only 6-12 more, time to up the ante and see if the servers can handle it.
---
Little late here, but yeah these are fucking ridiculous. And I can‚Äôt help but think to myself that I‚Äôm doing all this bullshit for a fucking backpack
---
this is why i stick with The Fixer, until i find bloodied/vats/vats cost combat rifle there is no better
---
What would happen if you popped a stealth boy?
---
It used to be a lot more. When they reduced the two shot damage to 1.25x damage modifier it is not worth the points anymore imo
---
Can't you take the ammo factory and call them in using the signal grenades?
---
we do indeed. just spent the best part of two hours server hopping to no avail. the best i could get was the fibreglass one which isn't too bad. it's only a few points worse than polymer, but, damn it, i wanted the polymer one to complete the set!
---
if anyone else's reading this, i'm pretty well stocked now for chest and leg pieces if you need any... just let me know.
---
thanks. i'll bear that in mind for the future. i'm sure to need more as i progressively improve my armour.
---
You have to get the plan for it and if you want the mods you build a bunch of them with the plans and then scrap them there is not enemy that has a stable drop crown enemies might drop one but rarely I've only had 1 dropped
---
Considering that people aren't shown on the map, I'd think the higher limit would be even better on Survival.
---
Too many!
---
The operators and pack were always the best. 2edgy4me sadism got old fast
---
Assume it means frog
---
As a player who accidentally scrapped Ansel's camera and is now on hour 15ish of farming tool boxes and ghouls with no luck....
---
Please make this a thing. I just want my God damn fucking backpack for which I bought a skin for. 
---
Fuck.
---
Look, a healthy and productive relationship between a community and a game developer! 
---
They do exist!
---
Been getting really bad drops last few days. Even the Queen is dropping me shoddy 1 star nocturnal wood armor and wrenches. Really not worth the 3000 bullets I used in the event
---
Yeah but everyone would have overpowered weapons it's bad enough with the dupers
---
I was logging in late so was kind of looking for an excuse not to play. When the 3rd world I logged in  had someone in my CAMP again I was ready to bail, but thought I‚Äôd see if there was any quick or reasonable challenges.
---
For once I got sleep. Which is good because it sounds like I‚Äôll be busy tonight...
---
It counts the collected units, not the amount. You need to pick it up 7600 times, not collect 7600 wood
---
I was  super stoked the other day... started an alt and at lvl 23ish I did 2 1\* ranged, and both were very decent rifles... a two shot handmade and AA auto pipe rifle
---
There's a noticeable difference. The damage numbers change. It is a percentage of explosive damage (which is easy enough to figure after you get the first card).
---
I ran a junk extractors at all my CAMPs until I got into ammo trading. 
---
I was in it for the springs, screws and gears.
---
it‚Äôs always been like that
---
Not yet; i expect poisoner‚Äôs to work and med-x to do nothing. I‚Äôm fairly certain med-x does the same thing it did in 4 and just adds 15 DR, but I haven‚Äôt tested it in 76
---
I've gotten 5 railway rifles... I just want any energy weapon. So annoying.
---
It usually happens when it‚Äôs been nuked and the radiation zone has gone. You can tell from the flowers..
---
Still probably worth 1 point adding 20% explosive damage, but put the other points into adrenaline, gunfu or Bloody mess if you don't have them &amp; you'll get better damage
---
She‚Äôs cute! Reminds me a little of Ruby Rose.
---
What are those jars? I liiiike them.
---
As if I needed anything to just push the point home today.  I've done Encryptid a ton.  Easily 20-30 times, probably more (given my Fedora count and you don't necessarily get it every time).
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I've also gotten a decent number of the mascot and costume but never the Imposter versions.  Today right as I log in (again) I see Encryptid is up.  I hurry over and get there apparently just in time for the event to end (and claim a reward) but not quick enough to actually do anything.
---
My reward?  Imposter Sheepsquatch Helmet.   How does that make any sense...
---
He crosstrained.
---
I start and end my login at my camp, so I do my best to make sure it's just me before I check out. I'm on a cliff, but I made sure not to have anything overhanging a drop - the only one within the camp circle would injure you, maybe give you a cripple, but not outright kill you.
---
I would like to see "A player is in your camp, are you sure you want to exit?" though. I haven't died, but I've come to a camp and walked up to a vendor just to have it disappear.
---
Bethesda has failed to create new interesting content. Burrows and Paradise are both very generic and boring. The game needs total overhaul if it wants to maintain players' interest. AI of the enemies are really simple and they are all predictable. Most of the enemies are one shot targets for veteran players. Rewards from enemies are basically all the same you can find anywhere else. Items were duped so hard and game is still full of dupes items that there is nothing interesting rewards anymore.
---
Its the production terminal, service entrance straight to the first room with the vendor terminals
---
#0/10 ^would ^^not ^^buy ^^^from ^^^^agaaaaaiiinnnnn
---
thank you so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Which terminal did you go to? They are definitely there and no need to server hop. Remember several terminals exist, each with different inventory. I honestly don't recall which, but has to be either production wing or military wing.
---
Everybody pays the same amount for the game.  If they're willing to grind for the capital to buy legendary effects, they should be able to do that.  RNG shouldn't play a part in when and if they get the in game weapon that they bought the game to play with.  Just my thoughts on what I expect as a consumer buying a product.  Having said  that, I did know that RNG was the system in place and I bought it willingly.  So I'm not complaining.  I'm just saying...the game would have more value to me if I knew there was a guaranteed way to play with the items I want.
---
Always have berry mentats?
---
My TSE .50 gets about a 15% damage buff from a level 5 demo expert. Sucks
---
No problem, I had the same issue when they first showed up.
---
I hear what you're saying, unfortunately, because of duping....cheaters end up with the best loot and the most caps.  So I say give everybody a way to ensure that they get to play with what they wanted in the first place.
---
I like the look better, and the industrial versions definitely sounded quieter than the normal ones. Where I am has no open water so I'm using the small ones now and they still make the small engine sound.
---
But not every weapon....unless you know a duper that has access to all of the best items.....
---
What system you on? I couldn't get mine to work either, I even removed it from central power and gave it its own generator. My artillery was on the outskirts of whitesprings.
---
I'd do her
---
As far as ik they fixed the bug where it uses all your ammo but but the only good one is a quad explosive dmg wise
---
WutFace
---
j/k she looks good!
---
kk ty
---
oh i thought you meant vendor robots
---
Shoddy mini-nuke?
---
There are legendary Scorched, BTW.  Watoga Civic Center mezzanine usually spawns one.
---
But I completely agree -- some poor raider or BOS Knight got infected before putting the suit on; had to have happened at least a few times before the nature of the plague was fully understood.
---
I set mine based on me wanting to sell to make caps, and to help out others. If something is valued at 500 caps, I'll sell for 150 or 200. If it's a recipe valued at 50, I'll sell it for 5 or 10 caps. 
---
I've come across ones that price the way I do, then some that doesnt change a price at all. In the later scenario, it is no better than other in game vendors. IMO.
---
Yep parasites are the worst!
---
I‚Äôm so late! I didn‚Äôt realize my apps notifications weren‚Äôt on. @Falloutpunkbb walked me thru, but if you wanna friend me I‚Äôll definitely send you a chat next time I‚Äôm ready to go thru.
---
They're sitting at the bottom on their second account collecting screenshots.
---
His willingness to die was legendary.
---
i might just get stealth boys to mix with b ments to counter people who use them then, i just really dislike the whole stealth boy setup i dont like the whole feel i prefer chameleon i know its inferior just easier for me .does chameleon armor counter act them? stealth boys never seems to work on my main char with chameleon.
---
Awesome, really my only concern is that I‚Äôd play on a base PS4 for performance
---
Check under stored tab
---
This was my thought. Suicider is the retirement package.
---
Think the complaint is the Ivory plan is fairly common, I have several myself and selling it is just about as pointless as complaining about how much someone is asking for it. 
---
Unless your camp is placed in an area with a lot of low level player traffic many of the plans and recipes are going to be hard to sell.
---
You might have to do part of the mission over.
---
The daily scrip capped at 150 is such a joke. Bethesda essentially says don‚Äôt play this game too much so we have no choice but obey. No event is worth doing unless my friends desperately need help. Otherwise a couple of ws runs and some players vending shopping is my only Fo76 exposure now, done in less than 30 minutes.
---
Sounds like your progress just wasn't saved do to the disconnect. You probably have to redo all or part of the quest to gain access again. Check your pipboy see if it still shows completed.
---
I've never had the easy wendigo ending for it. Every time I tried it I get the swarm of bugs I can't kill before the fire goes out.

This is the first time laying my virtual hands on one

They're bugged. Scrip it immediately or it'll revert to 1 star.
---
Hehe I've got a lvl 45 bloodied combat rifle with vats crit shots doing 50% more damage and +1 agility - perfect for my stealth commando VATS crit build! It hits for around 250 damage each shot with all the perks and at low health with nerd rage - that's with stealth as well remember - that means around 500 damage per shot and that is also with VATS crits. idk how much damage the VATS critical shots do, but scorchbeasts are just jokes for me with this build and this bloodied combat rifle
---
Awesome, will have to check that out when I‚Äôm next in Watoga.
---
i wasn‚Äôt trying to be mean just clarifying
---
Seriously?! Each terminal has its own inventory?
---
Ive been server hopping for the Forest mask for ages since i scrapped it accidently
---
It's worth it if you don't mind fixing the gun and not stabilized. What else you going to run in intel besides gunsmith? TS procs explosive twice so it's worth taking, but then again I have all the cards. If you're looking to spend points on cards, there's better like bloody mess, glow sight, adrenaline. Heck, even tormentor and one gun army is something I'd get before demolition.
---
My base is up on a monorail track and everytime someone fast travels there, even me, we fall and break our legs, thankfully no actual damage occurs.
---
If I do I‚Äôll let you know! Mostly miniguns and Gatling guns. It‚Äôs weird
---
Sounds about right. General rule should be 1/4 the listed value..... at least for most items.
---
Some items are rare and listed value says 50 caps, but players will buy for thousands. No list exists, so you'll just have to check out the market subreddits to see what's considered in high demand.
---
Seems like it. As soon as it gets "good" Beth is like "oh shit turn that off". though honestly if there are that many legendaries in every server I think it would probably just break the game. Everybody would have god tier everything.
---
When you gain further education and/or experience in the sciences you will learn that terms usually have multiple meanings, a specific scientific definition and also an broader, common usage like that typically found on internet, which is generally a vague perversion of the technical term.
---
Most plans you can sell for value. Except some rare or common ones.
---
These jetpacks are quite common and are usually priced 500-1500. I would go for 1k max
---
Yeah, I've gotten into a habit of swapping my Tesla rifle/explosive weapon when I'm around the Whitespring because one slip of the finger and you're as good as dead
---
Only a few available to get so far
---
Ah, you should be alright then.
---
It's weird but it's supposed to shoot 4. Some reason only 1 ball is used. Even the reload shows 4.
---
I was super confused when I picked up a ‚Äúwind instruments‚Äù plan and it said I already knew it. I just didn‚Äôt realize that the tuba I already had was the wind instrument because I was expecting more than one.
---
Yeah, each wing has its own inventory. Like you can't walk up to military wing and buy serums. You'd have to go to science wing for that. Each wing has specialized inventory to fit with what that wing is.
---
Same
---
At the scout camp shooting range there is a schematic.
---
Lol, salt in the wound
---
Haha I have 2 of that ;p
---
This is one of my loading screenshots lol
---
Oh i thought you meant each terminal in that section (4 in production, 3 in military, etc)
---
I know, but I need one already made to repair 3
---
It's still worth it if you build for it. Just like sentinel and cavalier after the balance. Assassin's has never been worth a damn so that's still the same lol
---
Check the cabins by white springs.
---
The free are among you.
---
I noticed any stealth bonus you get from chameleon armor is taken away when you pop a stealthboy.
---
You can get the hard copy from amazon for 20$ once you receive the copy it will have a code for the game not the actual disc. That's the cheapest i seen.
---
Nice! What platform?
---
Oh no lol, sorry for the confusion. In any case, they have all been locked down anyway. You only have access to 1 terminal per wing. The rest say they are busy. Some say it's a glitch but I suspect it was done on purpose ( potentially old duping method was tied to multiple terminals?)
---
I pick a random number less than half the stated value. Wherever the slider stops is your price. Fill up 4 vendors with cheap stuff you'll be more worried about spending money than making it.
---
I don't have your answer, but I can tell you as somebody who was on the fence with speed demon, I hardly notice the increased drain.
---
Ahright, I had wondered about that, as Im the only person in the bunker, and it says vendor busy.
---
Thanks for the help, I'll get that forest mask at some point (i hope haha)
---
you cant obtain them yet
---
I can confirm this. It is embarrassing to speak English sometimes. Too afraid to say words incorrectly, or we get mimicked depending on how thick our accent is.
---
It definitely doesn't work for Speed Demon
---
Gameplay wise I totally agree. Would only be concerned about server stability.
---
Are you on xbox?
---
I found that one some time ago, seeing these threads made me wonder if it's really that rare.
---
Craft one, go to the forest, bash enemies to break it, and then repair it 3 times.
---
It doesn‚Äôt show up at all
---
I had class freak 3 before I got speed demon, I do notice an increased usage of food it is still however small. Drinking has been my biggest annoyance and that has nothing to do with speed demon it's fast travelling.
---
they are outside [Valley Galleria](https://fo76map.com?locationIds=1140)
---
I was so happy to stumble upon that little scene.
---
It is indeed a very nice loading screenshot.
---
For clarity, this photo is from Sydney a few years back. Dust storms like this in cities are actually quite rare. I‚Äôve only experienced one in my life as an Australian.
---
The bathrobe does count - I took a picture of a friend wearing it while he was in the build menu at his camp and it gave me credit for the picture
---
Good to know thanks
---
Go read all the posters on the wall at any train station and get cracking on those quests!!!
---
That was better than mone, at least someone got it
---
This seems a good place to bring up that the crossbow is like half broken in VATS. Pls fix Bethesda
---
Unless it's a really rare plan I sell them for like 1/5 the list price. 10 caps for food recipes, 100 for deep pocket marine plans, 500 for jet pack plans, etc. I figure I got them "for free" by playing events, so anything is a profit.
---
Thanks I‚Äôll get right on it
---
Just based on your post, I'd say you'd be better off starting from scratch with a brand new character.
---
Umm... just do the main quest and side quests, explore, do whatever you want.
---
Alright thanks
---
Or armor type. I only want Trapper pieces.
---
I‚Äôm gonna go with that one, I‚Äôm having no luck with the cabins at white spring either
---
Yup, sounds like you need to do it again. Question is how far did it reset... do you have Defiance Has Fallen completed? I believe that's where BoS questline starts. Hopefully you still have that completed and just need to do Recruitment Blues for the access ID card.
---
Bathrobe does count. Me and a friend did it with the bathrobe. Also i've heard People saying the long Johns can be used to.
---
Honestly just msg the person. If they want a costumer they‚Äôll reply. 
---
I‚Äôm a big laser plasma user so I always msg first before spending the caps to travel out. 8-10 they reply and sometimes give deals for it.
---
And I took four of my team mate while he was wearing the bathrobe and none of them worked. Then I searched online and all information points to the bathrobe not counting.
---
Love my scout amour but yeah some mods would be nice!
---
That 3rd picture is like if Natalie Dormer was a raider. The smirk is strong.
---
‚ÄòInternal Database‚Äô - Yes, but for which freakin‚Äô armour?!
---
Reminds me of the game Chromehounds. The Japanese players used to making amazing and intricate Mechs that would always dominate. I used to make the joke that when the Japanese woke up, that‚Äôs when I should go to bed.
---
To you that would ruin the game for me and many others would be the point of playing if I don't have anything to grind for  I'm sorry but that wouldn't be fair for the players who play the game often because it would ruin it for them duping has already messed it up but if they added this I would stop playing the game what would be the point if I was able to just get what I want so easily
---
Does that effect just the two shot variants or any explosive weapons?
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure MechMaking101 is compulsory in Japan
---
1.25x down from 2.0x for two shot weapons
---
So you put in four shots, and she returned those bullets, sounds pretty fair üëå
---
Not only was it not instruments plural, I was not expecting brass instruments under the wind instruments blueprint. I would have guessed clarinet, oboe.
---
Exactly
---
Something with decent base damage is good, or if you're doing  a "group perk" build, you might consider specing fully out as a medic and getting a gun with the "heals team on vats critical" perk.
---
This is sadly a bit of a confirmation of something I'd thought to myself based on reading posts here on /r/fo76 now for the last couple months (note: I don't read Reddit except a google search result here and there, I'm only active on this sub). I noticed a lot of people who mention various things about how players behave, but in my time (since launch) with the game on PC, I've witnessed virtually none of it... 
---
I have a lvl 78 and a lvl 167, which equate to 700hrs of game time on **only** Adventure mode (yet to set foot in Survival), where I can count 4 hostile encounters towards me... we'll say 6 if I count my friend's who I play with on my lvl 78. 
---
One of them was probably while I was still lvl 20-30s, which he was continually shooting me while I was at a train station... Only much later, after I became wanted accidentally by shooting someone's crops trying to kill a RadRat, did I realize he was probably just trying to get me to kill them to get rid of their status!
---
Another was much later, but again I think the same desire, just to coax me into killing them.  
---
I can't really recall one of the encounters, but I felt it safe to err on counting "4"...
---
The most recent was the only time I definitely know that someone was doing it just to be a dick. I was at Berkeley Springs workshop, claimed it only due to it being a Daily, literally minding my own business while defending it from attacking Liberators.... when I'm taken out by someone. I run back, get my Junk, continue trying to finish the Liberators, and just as I do, I'm taken out again, this time they take my Junk. Meh, it's junk. I got about my business...
---
Keep in mind they never even contested the workshop...
---
So 15, 30 minutes later, whatever the cycle is... The workshop is once again under attack, but was a little busy so I didn't get there during the "Prepare" duration, and it lapsed which triggered the global event. I get there and... guess who once again shows up, to once again kill me? Yea... I ignored the player AND the event from that point and let bygones be bygones. They didn't follow me around, not that they could when ignored, and signed off an hour later.
---
**TL;DR -** From what I've experienced in my 700hrs of playing, compared to that various threads here on this 76 sub, it seems that it's the console players that experience the toxic environment, and that doesn't specifically surprise me. Consoles tend to have a younger audience is all, and not that all younger people are immature assholes... but we were all young once and surely know how ourselves may have acted at that age! :P Of course there are also players from every age group that play on consoles, too, evident by the OP. 
---
Though my point is that the entry price to game on console is much less than on PC, and with the need for laptops these days, most can't afford a gaming capable one. Therefore, games on console I've speculated will have a more toxic environment, as will other games with low system requirements, like Minecraft.   
---
*(I owned and personally moderated a MC server for 4 years, so I know all to well about griefing and how 12-16yr olds act lol)*
---
Eh, it's already broke they might as well up it and fix it altogether.
---
Cranberry BOG in the bootleggers shack basement area ( behind the lockpick 3 door) there is one on the shelves
---
Your welcome. Bashing them to death counts as a crossbow kill, so if you still need 50 kills it'll help with that as well. I used Poseidon because it's chock full of level 1-6 scorched.
---
Now you need to grind for that TSE Pie.
---
Lately, during non-nuke times (with regular flora too), just about every time I approach that area something high-level spawns. Level 91 glowing deathclaw, glowing yao guai, Honey beasts, Grafton Monster, and rabid glowing wolves. Also, high-level radscorpions. I usually get them to spawn, tag them to get their attention and let them chase me to the bots up by the main building. It's fun watching them duke it out!
---
I don't get it. I took so many pictures of my team mate in a bathrobe at hemlock holes... Nothing.
---
Given the servers buckle or even downright crash when all the players on the server meet up in an area, not sure thats a good idea till they change engines or something to actually have some basic server stability in this game first. (Shudders at the slideshow and 5 second action delays that are the encryptid event with a dozen people in a 20 meter radius.)
---
That‚Äôs where I saw them!  Thanks!
---
Ok cool! I'll look into it for sure.
---
Long Johns.

["I may be a criminal lunatic, but I'm an AMERICAN criminal lunatic!"](https://i.redd.it/0hrl3jn0o4xy.jpg)
---
How was it unplayable? Bored quickly I get but never ran across a glitch that just makes the game unplayable.
---
I mean, wasn't there meant to be 1000 people in v76
---
Something like a 12 year old engine now, Bethesda may as well be using the BUILD engine at this point. (Except the build engine was an incredibly good engine.)
---
Defiance has Fallen is completed, as is back to basic
---
Bathrobe worked for me
---
You hit a threshold level in the game, the enemies scale around 40 and you start getting rocked.  The only advice I can really give is specialize in a type, melee, rifle etc and build your character around that using the right perks, armor and a weapon. So many people have problems with the game because their build is terrible.  An example of this specialized build can be found on YouTube under CaptainNoob.  He has a commando build that explains things

Glitch. The day before I was really enjoying it and even made a post about how much I was loving it. Then as I logged in the next day the entire map wouldn't load and i just gave up after several failed re-trys.

What system are you on?
---
Thanks love.
---
Good gear and a decent build will make a huge difference. What is your build? What equipment do you have? Which console? 
---
Why are you over encumbered? Scrap all junk, sell excessive junk if needed. Drop ammo you'll never use or can't sell. Explosive ammo is especially heavy. 
---
Don't carry weapons and armor that you aren't actively using, stash it instead.
---
Get rid of useless aid supplies. Got some Sugar Bombs? Use them or dump them. Don't hold onto them 
---
Important weight reduction perks: Bandolier (ammo) and pharmacist (meds). Other weight reduction perks help, but these are the most important. 
---
I recommend using a heavy weapons build with power armor or a sneak sniper build. Both do great damage and have great survivability
---
I think the player cap is for stability. I still have hopes of them increasing the budget. Optimizing how thats handled could make both possible. I hope so at least.
---
I like it but it‚Äôs not as strong as before.   You could make it stronger with a bloodied explosive as compared to TSE but I try not to play bloodied anymore.
---
If you want to try again... I'm online right now with a bathrobe. Psn is ascarin1988
---
For sure, I see a guy with 18 armors and 10 weapons and they are all crap.  Wasted caps going there.  Should be free to travel to others camps
---
Every version of Creation is quite different from the last. It's their homebrew engine, and it's possible it could handle it. Let's hope their code monkeys are absolute geniuses.
---
Its more of a matter of damage done than shots taken. If he has a proper damage dealing build then I am out of ideas.
---
It's 35 on amazon right now. Was $25 about a week ago, never saw it drop to 20.
---
It was nice. Its been a while since I did 4 out of 5 of the daily challenges.
---
*Impossible.*
---
sometimes third party sellers have it a 20-25 that's how i bought mine.
---
More importantly....
---
ADD TO THE NAME WHICH DAMN SEGMENT THE MOD IS FOR! :)
---
If I'm looking for an upgrade for my Scout Armor Legs, I'd expect if mods are available at the vendor and say "Scout Armor Deep Pockets", that it'll work on ANY piece of Scout Armor...
---
But nope!   
---
It's anyone's guess if the mod is going to be for Legs, Arms, or Chest. 
---
It's not the only item that this problem is with, either. There's a mod you can find called "Bladed". What's it for? Most people probably don't know. I happened to get an event reward once for a Plan (though the server crashed and didn't save in time for me to keep it), and it was called Bladed Commiewhacker. I put two and two together, grabbed me a Commiewhacker and that mod... Presto. 
---
Ranting aside, I agree, we need mods either as physical drops, plans to learn, or *at least let us learn them from scrapping!* Unless that was finally added secretly... but my previous attempts to unlock any only resulted in wasted caps, since... you don't even get junk for scrapping them! lol
---
Another point of Adrenaline is not useless but not really needed as I get to one shot real quick.

 [**u/RFxcGinni3**](https://www.reddit.com/user/RFxcGinni3/)  \- what's your Gamer Tag ginni, are we up for this weekend? Also what's the discord group. I shall join.

That's when the vendor hopping for legendaries starts peeking.
---
I miss spelled bug, sorry.
---
Bloodied dcg or super sledge or be shotty.
---
Fun Fact:   
---
You cannot trade "Broken Pro Snap Deluxe" cameras.
---
I‚Äôm not sure how, but okay.
---
250 for select 3* category seals the deal. Go email Bethesda. It‚Äôs another sink they need in the game
---
What do you play on if I may ask? I usually play on XB and friend plays on ps4. Didn't know if it was like a pc thing. Not saying pc is worse or anything, would personally play on PC due to having more friends play on there but can't really afford one right now
---
Have also seen fast traveling to a player at the event instead of joining the event not give out rewards. But as the other poster said. If your low on damage output there is a possibility of no loot on queen
---
Same here in California. Smoke and ash are just another weather system around these parts lol
---
Terrible haircut. Reminds me of Ruby Rose who is hot garbage. But really pretty facial structure
---
A safer way to survive until you can reperk to a higher damage build is to do events. It will be slower, but there will be others there to help. Tag as many of the mobs as you can before focusing on one. Stash all your junk between them because until you get enough stim rewards to survive, there are people playing that will steal your stuff. Once you have at least 1 each of the perk cards for the gun you like, it should be much smoother fights for you.
---
This isn‚Äôt a queen loot issue. They get loot from the queens body. They don‚Äôt get event completion loot.
---
Bonus points if you can push him into water first.
---
admiral x - is correct I want to add dont give up on the character you will most likely be better off taking the time to fix him vs starting new. 
---
   when leveling I use something I call heal tanking to smash through leveling barriers. get the perk green thumb and chemist and super duper ?? if you can ?  anyway green thumb is the primary - chemist makes it twice as effective super duper is nice to have but not a neccesity. pick every soot flower and bloodleaf from the vault to the moonshiner shack to the super camp to the ag center to the end of the river near hill folk hotdogs. that will take about 20 to 40 minutes and will yeild 100 ish healing salves. healing salves do not generate thirst and have no load animation. 
---
  I beat a level 50 scorchbeast at level 15 with the old heal salve snipe and run like a bitch routine/ build up healing salve then smash an obstacle, rinse repeat. you will get that break through weapon armor / gear you need and once over the hump you can join us on the other side mindlessly killing everything with no real challenges left in the world.
---
I'd kill for a Minigun with both Anti-Armor AND +25% firerate. I keep getting rifles instead. :P
---
Some of us still crash in the elevator.
---
My only idea is that they did not join the event. This happens alot if you fast travel to a person (friend) at the event. It does not regester that you joined the event. Only work around my group has found is to fast travel to watogga and then join the event from there. Does it happen all the time. No. Is it annoying yes. We all check to make sure we have the event on the screen now. ( This is on PC). If we don't see it on screen or in pipboy we travel away and back again
---
Guaranteed drop in Nuka World DLC
---
Not surprised -- X-01 was supposed to have the edge in rad resistance, whereas T-51b was supposed to have the edge in damage reduction.
---
You get drink recipes by doing Bivs daily quests. Hes in Morgantown. There's about 20 recipes
---
The punch bowl is currently deactivated, it used to share beverages, but there were issues so now it's just decorative until they fix it.
---
Yup
---
Bathrobe at Tyler County Racetrack worked for me.
---
disease lower right?
---
There's a couple of perks in endurance that can help you out with that
---
also you can go to inventory tab over to status and see effects look for a debuff there. maybe your addicted or under chem effect ot something.
---
This is my first character. I'll take it off your hands if you like. I can pay as well.
---
Ahh okay I remember him I just honestly did his quest just to get the stations I never went back I'm gonna have to check that out now I appreciate it
---
I would personally replace or at least have lvl 3 skeet shooter instead of glow sight. With enforcer it can help to cripple enemies from further. Won't do much dmg but enforcer works to full effect helps the team out alot with crowd control. 
---
Glow sight only helps with nukes and urianum fever.
---
I have 2! Some of the best moments in F76 so far!
---
Oh snap! I totally forgot about skeet shooter. Thanks!
---
Ok. I might be on tonight, not sure when.
---
The event shows on the screen for them.
---
No problem. I'm a level 300 and didn't find out about it till like lvl 200. Been a shotgun build since beta lol whoops.
---
Klaxon722 is my tag. Dont sweat the timing. I'm currently on a ghost tour in Gettysburg.
---
Plans are 1/2 list price. Legendary junk 1\* 500 2\* 750 3\* 1000, non junk legendaries depends on other parts. Armor is the same. All meds except stims are 5-10. Stims 15, super stims 20, ammo is 1 per except shotgun @ 2, and cores @ 1per charge. Outfits max out at 25. Mods @ 75 , and my favorite moded pa parts cal legs (excavator,t60,t51,x01) are 2k each

The it's strait not enough damage done

And now he is riding on the back of a scorchbeast while setting fire to whitesprings.

I've gotten 3 pistols on all my 3* ranged at this point I have given up.
---
You've probably already checked that they don't need repaired?
---
Go get that bread!
---
Thank you Dr.YouTube
---
If they are not listed in stored, or do not show up after useing repair all from camp box, only way to get it to reset is move the camp
---
server merchant pharma jumping
---
Drop scrapper, rad sponge, glowsight. 
---
If your going for a support build something like ironclad or an endurance perk to help you keep your inside from being outsides. 
---
Scrapper is only needed when at a bench, rad sponge is situational at best. Ad you could have team mate running bloodied builds and rad apounge would ruin their dmg, glow sight is only going to help in nukes or events with glowing foes.
---
The Sons of Dane Compound almost always has one in the basement of the main house. It is locked behind a level 3 lock or you can hack the level 2 computer on the second floor (if I‚Äôm remembering correctly) to remotely unlock it. If it‚Äôs not there, just server hop and try again. Also a good place to get hotdogs for the Possum Backpacker challenge. They‚Äôre located on the grill to the left of the front door.
---
Hell no, well played, well played.
---
You can get this after trading with other, dumping into a non stash container, or dropping into a paper bag.
---
Easy fix. Is to relog. It's not that you are over weight it's server/database lag. Where the server thinks you have more than you do.
---
AGREED OH MY GOSH
---
First there should be items at locations for each player, I hate entering clean swept locations
---
[removed]
---
Flux as well.
---
Yes?
---
Check out cd keys, got my copy for ¬£6.99
---
I came to the same conclusion, you can't actually reach rank 3 in the non-venison rooms, that spawnrate is too slow to make it possible. (Unless the spawns are instanced per player or something.)
---
Scout Armor mods are bugged. Many like Sleek etc. aren't even applicable to the armor. I've had this issue since day 1 (rushed Enclave in beta). Really annoying since it's my favourite armor too...
---
I‚Äôve had this problem before. Went like 15 straight fights and got zero loot despite putting a total of 20k plus round on he over those fights. It was so bad people started giving their trash for helping.
---
Speed demon will do that too.
---
Steal a copy. Doesn't get any cheaper.
---
If I had the chance I‚Äôd try Friendly Fire. But I used to medic Team Fortress, I like the idea though, you just need a soloing alternative perk card layout. Good luck üëçüèª
---
I've done the event solo a dozen+ times, it's not hard, just lvl 3 the critter in the venison room and annhilate all the npcs, the alpha goes down in like 20-30 seconds for me. Whats impossible to do solo is saving all 3 critters for the best rewards, for that a group of 3+ is REQUIRED.
---
That‚Äôs just the best! I just got on here bitching to myself about also getting a freeze and having to exit to home. If we can‚Äôt have stable servers, we need to at least be able to rejoin. I just lost a workshop and all the resource collectors and fusion generator. Yay!
---
Yeah this was news to me. I couldn‚Äôt figure why I couldn‚Äôt interact with mine anymore. Oy!
---
Heya. I'm on now if you still have that confetti!
---
Seconded! Whenever I am looking to by camp plans I have to find a way to google search to that link.
---
There‚Äôs one at the Palace of the Winding Path. Google can tell you exactly bc I can‚Äôt remember to save my life!
---
Ahahahaha
---
I feel like the pies should give us an xp boost for 10 minutes or so since their so hard to get from the port a diners
---
Hehehehe
---
Lol I appreciate the help man, but.. take another look at the post üòÇ
---
I'll look into that. Thanks
---
i'll make you one for free
---
I don't do that, sir.
---
Bethesda doesn't need to prioritize shit, this exploit is fixable in five seconds.  All they do is tweak the scrap return so it isn't an infinite loop. Return one less material and Done.  Don't be one of those assholes that thinks all bugs are fucking equal, there's shit they can pop out while yawning and shit that takes time to fix without breaking anything else.
---
Haircut ruins it. Would be a good female raider though
---
Looks to be about halfway through the waving animation.
---
A picture would be nice to see what the fucking plan looks like.
---
Many people bail on it once they learn that the Impostor is the hardest hitting npc in the entire game that ignores 100% of armor and does 150-200 damage a hit. I see it one-shot unprepared players all the time.
---
Tygart water plant and the little power plant next to it.....Sutton and Helevtica(spelling)......summerville and the dried out lake right there.
---
Gunslinger is alot of fun and I was only half perked for it...that boom of the .44 is so satisfying and you toss in gun+fu and Tou can really put a hurting on.
---
Call me crazy but I play for fun.
---
Seriously, it's like why play when you dont want to put any effort.
---
So if it's 4 shots:
---
Mine is bloodied and can get up to 1000+. Does that mean 1 trigger pull counts as 4000+ ?
---
I played one in fo4 and loved it but everyone says it's not as good in 76
---
The reason why is because the modding community cares more about making the game better than Bethesda does.
---
I would run with some higher level players and tag their kills. Fast travel with them into the bog, gather cranberries, make juice, take a nap for well rested and profit. We've leveled quite a few new builds that way. 
---
If you're wanting to solo it then make a lot of rounds in the toxic valley.
---
I'm sorry, being in the canary zone isn't much fun.
---
to all that figured the cluster of fucks out.... thank you... Oh and I got a LV35 half busted Shitkebab and 2 stimpacks for my 2 hours of aggravation thanks BETH great job
---
Note that Camden park has another bobblehead spawn spot... in the miner ride there's a cart with a skeleton sitting inside. There's a bobblehead that appears on the lap of the skeleton or on the floor next to the skeleton.
---
Never heard as it referred to as the canary zone but thats a super apt name.
---
Events give pretty good exp. Mama Dolce's, On the Beat, etc.

Just pay chinese chilxren to play for you, I do.

I'll be posting my tried and true magazines/game locations once I get the last 6.  Theres a method to my madness I swear  :)
---
Amen
---
Yes you can. But the scrip will take a week and you will be max caps in about 2 days.
---
And just waking up. This is the first kind of post I see about this. I'm guessing there where more of them. Like a lot more.
---
Yes! Don‚Äôt even need a picture- just a quick couple sentences. ‚ÄúClear the area by adding explosive vents to your T-60 power armor! Explosive vents increase damage radius for impact landings. Requires Science 3.‚Äù I think that would be better than a generic picture of a messy folder of papers.
---
Trust me: try these locations. The bed and breakfast is insane and gets me tons of magazines. If you are Xbox, I may be able to help you out with the ones you need.
---
I'm on ps4 and would love that recipe pretty please....pathofcinders
---
I've heard a similar suggestion that it was midway through an animation.  Doesn't seem like anyone knows about an animation that's just this, so that seems plausible.
---
I thought a part of this game was exploring. Walk/run around more and you won't waste caps
---
Loads of low level scorched in &amp; around Poseidon power plant. Also has a guaranteed spawn monster nearby. You could even take over the workshop and nearby Charleston landfill workshop if you wanted to farm defend events for a bit. Poseidon may end up contested at some point, but otherwise it‚Äôs a great base to explore from and farm good low-level enemies.
---
I got one relatively easy, within the span of a few days trying. I would usually try 2-3x per machine whenever I would find one. On this particular time though, I got it in the first try and with only 4 Luck. I ate it, there's nothing special about it. Just restores HP and hunger
---
Explore...?
---
I would fuck her, if you catch my drift. üòâ
---
You can buy them off vendors sometimes. Head over to whitesprings and check em out
---
I love this community also. I try to help all low levels i can. Cause i had no one to help me since i played during the beta
---
It's such a strange oversight. That lack of information should never have left data. 
---
It's like how Scout Armor mods (deep pocketed) don't mention whether they're for arms or legs, they just say "Scout Armor Deep Pocketed" and you have to guess the rest.
---
Yes different PA can used for different things. 
---
And plans are easy to come by if you know where to go and what to do. A lot of them come down to what you would like and need.
---
I have a list lol....but I'm on ps4
---
Was he in a workshop or in the build menu at his camp? Because it worked for my whole group- they‚Äôre not gonna make a challenge dependent on Atom shop items :/
---
I prefer to fight the mutants at the asylum north east a little bit from 76. I Think all the benches are even there and they respawn pretty frequently. Also boat load of lead in the court yard by scrapping the weights and a cool necklace can be found inside.
---
I‚Äôm LOVING my Gunslinger/One Handed build. Not even done with it because I need three more cards to complete it. Not OP by any means, but I get a distinct sense of satisfaction from it. The Single Action Army adds to it for me personally. My old Main was solely into auto rifles and everything just seemed tedious. Not sure how people don‚Äôt just get completely bored of the metas.
---
All about what you enjoy.

The animated picture should be vault boy holding an item over his head then spreading his hands wider as the one item becomes 3 identical items.

---
Plans that are pretty good to get are the BOS combat armor plans that you can now purchase at the Grafton Train station vendor - most other plans will come to you as you quest and do events, take workshops etc! You can also find lots of plans in containers and safes so always check those too!
---
Yeah it goes away after a second. Thought it was weird.
---
Me to i am alsow playing since the beta and helping each other is the most important thing in the post apocalyptic world

Fusion generator
---
Work benches
---
Any cooking/brewing recipes
---
/thread
---
Yeah, my lever action build is also a stealth vats build so I can hit around 1500-2000 damage with a stealth crit. I also have an instigating dragon that sits at 800+ damage in nerd rage. With crit/sneak I can easily one shot lvl 80 scorchbeasts with it.
---
Extra frames are handy as storing power armor pieces separately in your stash or inventory gets very heavy, but if stored on a frame in your inventory the weight disappears and you only have the weight of the frame (10 I think) in your inventory. You can rename each frame so you remember which type it is - T45, T51, Raider etc
---
Seriously this community is the best! I‚Äôm normally a single player gamer and was VERY worried about how this game was going to work as a multiplayer, but for the most part I‚Äôve been pleasantly surprised. I really never expected to see so many people so willing to help each other out and be decent, especially in an online game situation!
---
There's a lumber yard in the North west that spawns a lot of super mutants, great xp and they drop lots of ammo and weapons to either scrap or sell.
---
I‚Äôll stick with the game box image
---
I can concur with this philosophy. I sell 1\* weapons for 100 caps, 2\* weapons for 300 caps and 3\* weapons for 800 caps. I refill my cap stash every 3 days (I also sell 1\* armor for 60 caps, 2\* armor for 180 caps and 3\* armor for 480 caps). Combine my sales of these items with intermittent sales of junk, serums and other oddly assorted items. I have difficulty finding things on which to spend caps every 3 days.
---
Oops! üòÇ
---
Crap I was there today and didn‚Äôt have a suit. I went up to the workshop to try and find one. Didn‚Äôt check the bathrooms right there.
---
Yeah no problem. Just looks most like the waving animation too me.
---
very nice. :)
---
How are you not attacked constantly?
---
"I live, I die, I live again!"

This happens at the WS golf club after a nuke zone has cleared. It has happened this way for the past few weeks.

It's a great filler.

No the damage you see while you have the weapon equipped is a total based upon the gun's damage, cards and ect. It shoots 4 shots at one ammo cost. If it's two shot it shoots 8 at one ammo with increased damage. If it's bloodied explosive it does even more damage especially if you have cards, armor an what not. The highest I have gotten my be dragon is almost 3000 damage. If I were to put on one more piece of unyielding armor I could be around 3300

Ha!  Exactly.
---
The correct price is 3141c
---
150? it will be about 300-500
---
Gotcha. I have a bloodied  3* super sledge so I was thinking about maybe trying a stealth melee build.
---
Cheers! It's just what I call it, for reasons you're clearly aware of. :)

I‚Äôm pretty sure I saw them at the BoS vendor at Watoga.

Sweet, thank you kindly

Just you wait, the list covers all
---
I think it does 4k + assuming all 4 hit. I 2 shot the lvl 85 scorchbeast in glassed cavern with my 1* bloodied dragon. It felt so good.  But sometimes it only removes 1/4 health bar from a lvl 65 scorchbeast if I dont aim dead center
---
I expected it too, but I wasn‚Äôt sure just how significant that edge actually was. It‚Äôs a lot more than I expected, to be honest. 13% is noticeable. I was figuring less than 5% due to the way armor scaling works and the innate rad reduction % baked into power armor.
---
This is the truth unfortunately, whatever number they raise it to has to be able to all play in one area at the same time, we already have issues at SBQ fights with the numbers we have.
---
Not sure how other games like Planetside 2 pull off battles with over a hundred players.
---
Looks like Jerome from Gotham
---
I'd simply love bigger teams. 4 player teams isn't always enough when you want to work together and have fun
---
They don't. I used to love that game on PS4 and most big battles looked like a flip book.
---
No it does not help. Class Freak still needs a couple bugfixes. Im getting rid of speed demon tomorrow. Im running out of food.
---
Ah fuck.
---
90 vs 99, huh? It‚Äôs amazing how that last 9% matters so much. I could probably run a whole nuke in hazmat from full health and not die... I can‚Äôt last 15 minutes in PA.
---
It was probably just somebody‚Äôs mule character. They dump all their tradable stuff onto a low level character that does nothing but trade. It‚Äôs just a convenience thing. 
---
One could argue that it‚Äôs an exploit, but it‚Äôs very common and I don‚Äôt believe it violates any TOS.

Thank you so much bro
---
This. My vendor is level 40, but that‚Äôs because he‚Äôs much more than just a vendor- it‚Äôs a second account, he‚Äôs also a mule, so he‚Äôs got most weight reduction perks except weapon ones, because he is currently at 4/5 weapon weight reduction armor pieces. He also shares more perks as needed (15charisma), enables Strange in Numbers and Herd Mentality on my main, provides Empath damage reduction to my main, and a free fast travel point. Oh and makes it easier to complete certain challenges (group or take picture of another player ones, mostly).
---
But yeah, he sells 1 machine full of max level weapons, 1 of max level armor, and same for 5-40 weapons, and armor.
---
Of course
---
You should try a bloodied harpoon gun. If you watched captainoob's showcase of a bloodied harpoon gun he one-shotted a scorchbeast with it as well - this could be useful because you can just take the harpoon back from the scorchbeast after you kill - that basically means you just killed a scorchbeast at the expense of no ammo and only a tiny bit of condition damage
---
I read that doing the one in water was enough to unlock both. Was it false?
---
Come out to Broken Hill. It's a monthly occurrence.

I don't think anyone sells them reliably. If you're on xbox I have 1 I could sell you. If you're not on xobx, maybe that other commenter can help...

I'm pretty sure you get it with tadpole badges at the scout vending machine

I hope you find it!

Are you on PS4 by chance?

If it most likely was acquired legitimately over multiple characters I wouldn't have thought twice about purchasing. Good to know for the future. Thanks!

Plus these events seem to be just complete chaos..Took me forever at the Enkryptid to understand WTF was going on. Now at PP, its all the same, with no real way to communicate with each other, players are all over the place, the friendly animals die off, players are just running all over the place. Makes my head just want to pop. I have done it a few times now, not sure I will be back, just like the Enkryptid event.
---
Np worries. You should be able to find a mod for 200 or less.
---
Yes i am sir üëç
---
Maybe introduce a new perk card that combines them both in some way.
---
Whit shit I have 3 of them in my stash, people will pay that much for them?
---
Then I may need to stop by your vendor
---
Thank you this will be my first stop my next day off.....
---
Welcome , im on in about 30 minutes
---
I crashed my last three attempts.  It‚Äôs just not worth dealing with that.  It‚Äôs too bad because it‚Äôs a cool event.
---
Paranoid much
---
Good to know. It was the first time I'd encountered something like that. 90% of the time the camps I visit don't have anything worth purchasing.
---
Even Kago's Japanese would be hard to understand, given the language has evolved for centuries beyond his vernaculars.
---
Nope.
---
ESO lacks quality, at least on consoles, graphics wise and combat wise. It‚Äôs an MMO, with an engine built for an MMO.
---
I haven't seen a single one pop up in shops yet, thank you so much! Gamertag same as the name here?
---
What is your Gamertag?
---
Low price of 10k its yours
---
Freaking love my HW/Explosives PA main. I know some folks can‚Äôt stand PA, but man... on those SBQ fights, I feel like such a brutal tank. I transitioned to a low-health build back in Jan-Feb and my firepower output is insane, plus I‚Äôm still very tanky with Emergency Protocols. 
---
No subtlety, just pure full auto firepower with a few explosives thrown in for good measure. I can 1shot mirelurk queens with my fatman!
---
I price at what I would like for an item, but I have in neon letters above my shop saying make an offer. I will always accept an offer if its decent. Mods 25c except extra claw mod it's 250 or 500 depending on how many I have. Bullets 1c if I stock it, don't usually. And recipes 15, mounts 250, and all other plans 25 to 500 depending on what it is.
---
I've been looking for a quad/explosive harpoon gun for my heavy weapons toon. They're sort of rare. The only harpoon guns I've personally found is a nocturnal and a hunters. I've got a 3 star bloodied fatman before... but I turned it in for scrip lol.
---
Either way my heavy weapons toon can rip scorchbeasts apart and he doesn't need a special weapon for it. I've got a bloodied gatling laser, a junkies/explosive minigun, a bloodied .50 cal, a aa/e gatling gun, an executioners gatling plasma and a bevy of other nice heavy weapons. Heavy weapons are what I don't need more of lol. I'm trying to gear out my other toons. I can kill any scorchbeast short of the SBQ before it crawls out of its fissure.
---
Grim project
---
Poor sportsmanship was going afk.
---
It‚Äôs been repeatedly nerfed. 
---
They can‚Äôt make anything better so they just watered it down to be in the mud with the rest. 
---
Great way to ruin a game tbh. They got that down.
---
Yup and I love it.
---
Can only be obtained at the enclave now. Used to be a drop from sbq, not anymore.
---
Agreed, national socialism was nothing more than a marketing term much like "the people's republic of North Korea"
---
It's bs cause I wanted to hail fire on the club house from my base. I guess you can't have everything. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
sad day
---
Are you a morning person or a night person?
---
Same here. There‚Äôs still the occasional butthead, but they‚Äôre so few and far between that they don‚Äôt even count.
---
Both, it happens no matter when I play or how.
---
I imagine their mini nukes are faulty and instead they hit their target with'em like a mace. I'd love a mini nuke mace so much.
---
You still sellin ?
---
I haven't played on PC, but I can give you my xbox experience: I can server hop 20 times and not hit the same server in adventure, but depending on the time of day there's only 3-4 servers of survival active.
---
Sadly I think adding music would probably get expensive quickly with having to pay for rights to it. I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs the majority of the reason why it hasn‚Äôt happened. It sucks, cause the music winds up getting old pretty fast.
---
It‚Äôs been there a while - it‚Äôs a nice way to track badges and scrip for sure
---
sorry i mistyped i just had the one
---
Most times I play on PS4 for a few hours I'll check the map and I'm the only player on the server
---
If atom shoo would quit selling fortnite themed bs and give us the things we want , then it‚Äôd make cash for sure. 
---
I‚Äôd buy the shit out of a bos themed weapon lineup or various uniforms but I‚Äôll pass on racer gear and clown makeup thanks.
---
Plasma with 2x and faster reload,  will be able to drop a perk or two to open them up for others with that
---
Is that a new paint scheme in the atomic shop? I havent logged on lately
---
....huh? 28 legendaries in one loop is nerfed and watered down? What the hell was your drop rate before?
---
Hey I want to get in on this too, but I‚Äôm embarrassed to admit I‚Äôm not 100% sure how to go about finding people by GT on this game. Is there a way to search in the game, or do you look through XBox live? I‚Äôm just not as savvy when it comes to this since I‚Äôm usually playing solo.
---
No just modded heavy combat armor
---
Lots.  So much.   I miss it. 
---
Hell, just the massive hoards fighting you nonstop like a zombie pocalyps was bad ass.
---
Now I‚Äôve got to try this. I‚Äôm curious.
---
I've been trying to get one done, only had one up so far and it was myself and one other person. For me it's been dead since launch.
---
I'd pay 200-250 if i got to pick the weapon.
---
I had no idea lol
---
i did some more testing and the best consistent results of.... i guess phenomena (?) where it moves the camera focus away from the creature happened when i was moving towards it and scanning along its tendrals. i dunno. it might just be a focusing issue with the scripting to be honest, but it might not as well because this is the only instance ive found where the camera acts up in this way. i really hope its intentional and im not reading too much into it.
---
Is there a trick to the pictures for the Possum badges? It‚Äôs so frustrating to take so many and they don‚Äôt have any indication of what you‚Äôre doing wrong. My camera roll is full of pictures of copper deposits...
---
My camp is somewhere not far from Twin lakes north of Spruce Knob and tonight i noticed a low level player walking around there. There was several others camp around at the time. That person went visiting each of them.
---
This thread and some other read had previoulsy read on some matter made me decide to follow him (her?) around. I tried to stay hidden but was very good at it. At several moments, i was diffcult to know who was following who.
---
I even fell off a cliff and died. No one revived me so i use the nearest fast travel. The low level had died too and i was too late to revive. In the mean time another high level join the party. We stayed near the lowbie for a long period of time, even when he went inside WS shopping area.
---
Ultimately, we kinda lured him into the golf club. He died a few times and i was able to revive him. But... Nothing happen.
---
I checked my log and the Pioneer quest wasn't even there anymore. I was kinda mad at me that i had not checked that before starting all of this. But i knew that sort of thing happen and i only need to restart the game.
---
Before leaving i decide to do something i usually never do. I added the low level as friend. That was i could get back following him or her.
---
Next we exchanged a few text messages on Xbox Live. I tried to explain what i was doing; trying to revive someone for the Pioneer quest. Then he said he was trying to set up a shop but had nothing to sell.
---
I reply that i read on Reddit that player will by anything from a low level shop. But my message was missing the word "level".
---
So he or she reply "don't call me low". I tried to explain that "low level" was a common terminology on the internet to talk about a person's in game avatar when that avatar is of a low level. 
---
I think the next that happen is that he or she blocked me, so i returned the favor.
---
I understand that being followed around might freak out some people. But common on, this is an online video game. Encountering others players is the main purpose of playing an online video game.
---
I must admit that even after they "fixed" the pvp of adventure mode i was often trying to evade others players on the map while playing a low level, but this was only because all ennemis levels scale to the higher level if he is the first to enter the area.
---
Or maybe all of that was only because players on Xbox are not very used to that kind of interactivy.
---
they accepted the email of purchase I got from eb games
---
Through xbox on the same tab as friends there should be an option to seach a gamertag
---
I enjoy moving my base to new locations from time to time, but yeah - 30 min daily chore is what it is now.
---
That means you don't have the chest plan.
---
Where did you find the plans?
---
I'd like this to happen as well, but, with adding additional players I can see the new Reddit postings now, "My camp couldn't be placed because someone else was there." About as often as: "Is the game worth purchasing"? or I haven't played in months, "what's changed"?
---
Brilliant. I've got a second account as well but never even considered taking advantage of the perk possibilities.
---
The kelp sometimes just stops spawning.  The other night I got it in the high 40s, today I got a quick 25+ and then it stopped.
---
It's not a plan. They're just heavy combat armor the reinforced mod
---
I‚Äôm no math expert but this right here is why I love Reddit. People like you doing god works behind the scenes.  All I do is spend weekends shooting things and get a feeling for how fast things die with no math to back it up.  Keep up the great work.
---
Oh, okay thank you.
---
I think I benefited from someone else that happened to earlier today... i went to nuke Whitesprings just for a radiation test, and all I had to do was make the keycard to get past the laser grid. Everything else was cleared and the launch prep was basically done- I got the phase completion alert as I walked in to the control room. Just had to clear a few security bots, and launch the nuke.
---
Damn, I might need to work it back in? Maybe a point of it atleast.  I honestly never get spotted in Wes Tek and I never use it.  But I‚Äôll do some tests with it.
---
Parasites disease, and/or speed demon mutation are the likely culprits
---
I was just telling you that it‚Äôs my first. I‚Äôm not attacking you.
---
Yeah, if anything in this game is P2W, it‚Äôs having a second account and being able to run it simultaneously :-/
---
It is random. Luck level should influence it but I don't believe that has been proven in this meta.
---
What platform? And if you don‚Äôt mind, create your current perk loadout on nukesAnddragons.com and we can offer advice on that
---
Congratulations dude I will save this post and watch later but Ill give you some advice(used to edit and make videos).Its really easy,dont let it intimidate you you got this.If you think you did something wrong its okay trial and error is how we learn.
---
Eww
---
Racist undertones PLUS elementary location observations??? Yup, your credentials as a real estate agent check out!
---
Stupid question, there are different server types??
---
Sure thing. IGN roundyroundy
---
A player came by my shop and bought a few items.  He noticed my Tadpole backpack and dropped three diffusers for me.  I thanked them profusely...  saved a ton of searching...
---
Now I just need to find a scout armor gas mask.  I had one from enclave events but I must have accidentally scrapped it.  Never found one since...
---
Sweet! Alright adding now and thanks!
---
The explosive effect adds 20% to weapon damage. Demo expert increases explosive damage by 60%. 20% x 1.6= 32%. 5/5 demo expert increases TSE damage by 12%. Most people would say 5 perks for 12% damage isn‚Äôt worth it.
---
I'd pay 300 scrip just to choose the first prefix of a three star honestly
---
So I solved this wording mystery.  The plan is called Light metal torso or something like that.
---
Just noticed it last week no idea how long it's been there.
---
And most mod plans are never sold. Many are random drops from events or found in containers and where recurring plans spawn.
---
i i find it either at the top of the world in the little armor repair area right near the Top, or it‚Äôs
---
on that strip of Raider shops on the street nearby.
---
When I found one it was at the General Kelly Monument.  I had to sever hop a bunch of times over several days before I finally found it and got the quest.
---
My friends list is being janky so I‚Äôll join your world
---
Yea I'm checking there and the cemetery and then hopping
---
holy shit thats my next move then
---
 Unless you can suggest a better authority on the English language than Merriam-Webster?
---
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fascism
---
Then I'm afraid you've been misinformed. Fascism isn't about the economy. Fascism can (and usually does) contain strict government regulation of the economy. Government regulation isn't even close to the same as government /ownership/.
---
Yeah when they got like 300+ players it was really choppy performance.
---
But they definitely did up to 64 vs 64 players really well,  at least on PC.
---
Dragons break quickly so its not really worth it, theres explosive dragons that do even more damage and they barely go for much on the market
---
Probably a 2h melee build, to be able to do enough damage to overcome armor and not hit like a wet noodle. 
---
Otherwise, since it sounds like you intend to play in a group, the cryolater is kind of a support weapon as it slows/can freeze enemies. It‚Äôs just going to be costly to keep armed. Flamer with Friendly Fire perk can also be considered sort of a support weapon, and might be appropriate with Tenderizer or Suppressor perks (bonus if you have Suppressor legendary on either one, as well)
---
Sounds like the local building inspector to me...
---
Always looking for something to cite homeowners on.
---
How interesting. I'll keep hording them away and see if I can get a lucky streak!
---
Do you have proof they exist? There has never been a confirmed Q of any black powder weapon
---
I might need to just server hop know mod spawn points.
---
What are you seeing that‚Äôs racist there?
---
Since we were able to swap legendary weapons for scrip at least ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
The enclave vendor sells all of them all the time, and all vendors sell things for the same price, so there‚Äôs not much point in checking if another vendor has it, is there?
---
It would've been nice forever ago, but at this point I'm just buying up mostly every plan I don't know that I can afford
---
One of my regular vendors, from before the personal vending machines, has 3 Xbox's and 5 characters on each system. Buying anything from him is often a unique experience.
---
&gt; *FuRoggu
---
&gt;
---
This would be a more accurate transliteration.
---
 
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Most Japanese can't pronounce F &amp; R
---
&gt; So instead they uses H &amp; L
---
The root cause is that in the Japanese language (the same is true for Chinese btw) and to native speakers R&amp;L and F&amp;H, respectively, sound alike. The resulting sound lands somewhere in between the 'western' sounds, and in case of Japanese they sound more like R than L, and more like F than H. 
---
And because their ears are not trained to hear a difference between R &amp; L, to Japanese the words 'frog' and 'flog' sound exactly alike. The same goes for 'hauled' and 'fault' (well, roughly). My beloved Japanese wife will often over-compensate when taking notes, and pick the wrong consonant... ;-)
---
Try hopping servers, that happened to me. I went to a different server and I was able to go down the elevator
---
I just did it on PC about five minutes ago. The deer spawns were bugged to hell.
---
Have you tried switching servers, this usually does the trick....
---
Thats not it's purpose, it's a boss crippler. (lvl 100 alphas/Scorch Queen/Imposter) It's a damn godsend against those, makes everything easier.
---
sold mine for 12.5k
---
I really feel for you on this one but I‚Äôve seen Bethesda respond on Twitter multiple times that they can‚Äôt recover lost items. You‚Äôre probably out of luck on this one.
---
The vendor in the production wing of enclave sells them
---
I don't know, 1 in 5 doesn't sound right, with luck 4? I got one after a lot of random tries with luck 6.  In fo4 it was something like 1 in 673( I think)
---
Just was in a SBQ fight on PC
---
There‚Äôs some cranberries up in the Aaronholt Farmstead in the north of the forest if you don‚Äôt wanna go to the big early on but want the xp boost
---
Sweet. I‚Äôll have to look at that. I think I had been trying to do it in game and it wasn‚Äôt happening.
---
As an Australian I thank you for acknowledging this fact
---
If that was normal you would see the forums go crazy with reports. I did lose a pa chassis before though after a crash, it was deployed before the crash and somehow lost in the revert. You sure you didn't drop it? You might have got excited and hit r instead of t for card swapping, then crashed. It wasn't the server if your friend was still in it.
---
Stability go bye-bye
---
It should be viable as a damage weapon too not just utility.
---
I'll need to check it out
---
[Fallout wiki says no.] (https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects)
---
I wanted a tenor sax
---
I've got one, I just don't know hardly any mods for it.
---
Eh, I didn't make it very clear.
---
For example, with 4 luck it works out:
---
(4*4)/20=.8
---
You have a .8% chance in getting a preserved pie everytime you attempt it
---
Bloodied explosive is still the meta, tho AAE is safer and TSE is just a cheaper version of AAE
---
I hate having to do that though. I can't keep screws because I'm trying to get the suppressor for the handmade
---
Had the same thing happen to me with plans. Spent a ton of caps and fast traveled back to camp.  Once I did it crashed and my plans were gone and my caps...
---
I'm on Xbone, thanks though
---
Definitely did not drop it, didn't have any time to - as soon as I pressed tab to load the pip boy, the game crashed hard (which could be a coincidence but I think the purchase had something to do with it). Also my friends were right next to me and they did not crash, they said no bag was dropped.
---
Whats your gt? Ill invite you.
---
in other words still the same as it was.
---
Really really sucks. I have never had an exploding non-ballistic weapon before and I thought this was my one and only chance to have it!
---
Nice. I'd likie to join your server... friend request?
---
I do that if I show up and the lead and junk resource extractors are locked.  Otherwise, I leave it alone. 
---
I had just taken over the ammo factory when another player came along and contested it [PS4].  Needless to say he one shoted me because of how broken the whole thing is (no countdown so that the owner can prepare or abandon, etc). So I just left that world and took it on another. 
---
So, I set it up to manufacture shotgun shells, set up the lead and junk extractors.  I also took over the Grafton Steel mill.  I then went off and went lead and plastic farming.  In two hours I had crafted about 1200 shotgun rounds but only got about 200 from the ammo factory.  The disparity is even worse if you are crafting 50 cal ammo. 
---
Long story short, why is it that the ammo factory is so contested?  You can make more rounds just farming...  
---
Yes, you can go off and do other things, but you would have to hold it and keep it during your whole session.  It just doesn‚Äôt seem worth it. 
---
It‚Äôs definitely off my list for useful workshops given how contested it can be and how little you actually get out of it....
---
Disagree with the explosive bit, using explosive weapons negates stealth. I have tested this extensively, I am now swapping all my explosive weapons for bloodied faster fire rate whick imo is the most OP build right now.
---
Did you contact Bethesda support about it?
---
everything is strong now bloodied ....fater fire rate ....and anti armor.... some people go for junkies build i tryed every single weapon and they are all strong and can kill fast ü§î
---
Who would sneak to a vendor anyway. That  doesn't make sense at all
---
I understand that part but just trying to clarify what you mean since some people use two shot interchangeably with two shot explosive. So like does the demolition perk also effect non explosive two shots? And were all explosive guns nerfed, or just the two shot explosive guns?
---
It's literally free lmao. 
---
They could've put it up for 100 atoms like the other emotes that are an old animation with a new graphic.
---
If you want to complain about reusing old animations complain about those.
---
Stealth is really nice but imo the most niche and specialised build, as someone who specs in shotty, heavy and melee explosives with the 20% dmg increase are nicer
---
That really does suck. I actually just sold an AAE tesla not 20 minutes ago for 15k. Hopefully they can help you out with this one. Wish you luck with it.
---
Also meta doesn't mean best, I'm sure there are a lot greater builds out there but they aren't as meta as BE AAE and TSE
---
ohhh ok
---
Haven't looked at junkies, what's the boost like for weapons? Where does it cap?
---
I was today years old when I learned this!
---
You know, I never thought of that, but a countdown or some type of warning WOULD be massively helpful for that. I hate the whole workshop PvP deal in general, but this would make it a little better anyway.
---
please update on whether or not you got the same results. im genuinely curious as to whether or not we're on to something here.
---
Sorry I thought that was the obvious part.
---
Explosive damage perks increase explosive damage only.
---
Yeah sometimes the bag doesn't show. If you drop a bullet, everything you dropped in the area will move into the new bag. That's all I got gl!
---
If it's not there don't pick up the item that's there, until it's the Gauss rifle
---
Maybe it was named? Named items have been appearing as other items after purchase lately. I would check all your stuff.
---
Removing the cap limit will only make things more expensive though.
---
Believe it was added with the scouts stuff.
---
Yes, supposedly.  I‚Äôve never seen it listed at the vendor and I must have hit it every day this week on multiple severs.  All I see are arms and legs.  Perhaps I need to buy those first for the inventory to change.
---
Damn did mrbeast start playing fallout
---
Already addressed.
---
Buzzblade build by far, it would tear apar SB Queens. R.I.P. :(
---
yes
---
Lol I feel you. Did you hear the guy on speaker at the swimming badge? The toxic cleanup guy isn't any better.
---
guess so man, I also have a ushanka hat being sold for 9999 caps so... I guess I can get lucky eventually
---
Unfortunately named items don't appear named in vendors, also names don't transfer from player to player :(
---
90 vs 98 means that you take five times as much radiation damage \*before\* RR is applied. If your PA and hazmat had the same RR, that would work out at 9 times as many rads. With the undamaged hazmat RR of 1000 it's more like 12 times.
---
Thanks for thinking outside the box, but in this case it looks like it was a result of the crash, or the item that caused the crash and subsequent loss.
---
So 125k isn't enough for you?
---
For me, it's an obnoxious event because of all of the one hit kills and the lengthy walk back. I spend more time running back to the event than I do actually participating.
---
I've been playing a low health bloody/unyielding build for 100+ hours and I can fight anything without dying. I 1 hit everything except scorchbeasts which take 3-4 hits. I never die, but in Arktos all I do is die. 
---
I'm not against difficult content but this seems massively overtuned compared to other content for no reason. I can take on level 80 scorchbeasts, tank the SBQ, and fight the imposter sheepsquatch without issue but a random assaultron pokes me and I drop dead instantly.
---
Do your pioneer scout duty and clean up the environment. Always remember to take out the trash.
---
Thanks I appreciate it man, crossing my fingers!
---
Super weird, I would get a video grab and post it as well as sending a bug report to Bethesda.
---
I've had the healing issue as well as the no dmg one but rebooting or changing weapons fixed it.
---
No they don't but people have posted that named items showed up as other items once they bought them. Armor appeared to be Power Armor Chassis, etc.
---
I have a "youve been insulted" note in mine for 6969 caps. I really want someone to buy it
---
10% damage per addiction, capped to 50%. I think it got a bit more popular recently because you don't lose addictions as easily.
---
HAHA GOT EM
---
Probably doesnt even have all 5 slots used up
---
me too, but can I sell mine for 42069?
---
25k * 5 = 125k
---
Yup, the math adds up.
---
I've got a Mutants Explosive dragon and it's no joke like \*maybe\* 20 shots max from overrepair to broken with gunsmith 5. It's an "In Case of Emergency" weapon. Hits like a fucking truck, though.
---
It's funny when you kill guys in this game. I turn off the audio and stay on team. But my friend tells me it's bad. I used to keep it on always in pubg but it was the basic fu bitch. It wasn't the single player base you meet here. It's like they were dropped on their head. I been reported too, I'm sure the staff gets a laugh out of it.
---
I sell faschacht masks for 420 caps
---
Some rando wigged out on me when I messaged him on xbox chat. Just asked if he still needed the camera because I found Ansel in front of Whitesprings. Guy completely loses his mind and starts sending shitty messages. I messaged everyone in the server and 3 or 4 people showed up and got it except the one crazy guy. 
---
Long story short..... some people are total dipshits.
---
 so proud of this community
---
Lol. Upvote
---
Valid point. Like how the initial stash limit was 400
---
100%
---
this is brilliant, insightful, and written like its a script for a high tier gaming youtube channel. its much appreciated. as someone who at this point only sets up camp to use it as a vending station, i should probably experiment with more than one location.
---
I had one at one point, lvl 35, slowest to reload fun to shoot.
---
&gt;And those two guys which see it - well that's not enough.
---
Especially considering that 9 times out of 10 those two guys are under level 50. Makes me just want to leave and just let those lowbies get murdered.
---
They removed the legendary random spawn of those with the TSE
---
The only reason things are often affordable is because some people get close to their max caps and sell cheaper or things are bought through vending because players are at Max caps so looking for things to buy to lower how many caps they have. Removing the cap limit will absolutely drive prices up and instead of players spending more they will then hold on to caps for that one off big buy. The cap limit exists for many reasons
---
Hope you get it back. They'll probably do it, I dunno, never dealt with support.
---
After a careful once-over, absolutely nothing. You're golden.
---
OMG DUDE, you're right! Unbelievable.. \[Imgur\]([https://i.imgur.com/rf3whvo.png](https://i.imgur.com/rf3whvo.png))
---
THANK YOU SO MUCH!
---
The assaultrons in Arktos are out of control.  And the respawn makes no sense.  Sometimes you respawn inside and sometimes you respawn outside.
---
When I was at this point I had most of my perk points in Strength to increase my carry weight so I started using Melee weapons while still working on a sniper build. 
---
I picked up super sledges from Super Mutants and started using that in low level areas (left side of the map) to farm for ammo and a sword for bugs.  It‚Äôs the easiest way to find ammo until you get Ammo Smith and Super Duper.
---
Awesome! Glad you found it.
---
F
---
Also 120 fully sourced with ates main weapon. I play survival once a week to get my free 3 star season then back to adventure for me.
---
I run a FE stealth commando build
---
Heh, I'm a heavy gun user and I end up getting pipe bolt-action pistols.
---
Dead games require no players.
---
 When you gain further education and/or experience in political science you will learn that Mussolini and Hitler defined fascism pretty clearly and set it as an alternative to liberal democracy and socialism- it is antithetical to both and is in no way "socialism"

In the most basic sense, fascism is "ultra-nationalism" manifested in the supremacy of the "nation-state" and everything becomes subservient to the state in the name of "the nation" which is conveniently defined by said state.. This includes economics, which for the most part remained in private hands-   
---
The little that most people think of as "socialism" - the welfare state aspects were holdovers from the German Empire (which the NAZIs saw themselves as reestablishing) and were created by Bismarck, a person likewise extremely opposed to socialism and conservative to the core- which is actually why he created a welfare state which fundamentally a conservative conception.

How can you run out of food?   I encounter mole rats, wolves, and a ton of other animals that drop meat on a regular basis.  The only time I dip into my canned dog food is when doing a Nuke event or rebuilding my base (and I forget to use the happy camper perk).
---
Got one if you're still looking
---
Not only that, where's the scorched with automatic weapons? The only enemies that seem to use automatics at all are Super Mutants.
---
Yes where at what‚Äôs your psn

I'm not on atm but I'll be able to help in an hour or so if no one else can
---
Those who grasp to the last flicker of a hopeless cause are merely blinded by their own prideful desire for it to be what it once was; alas, to the slaughter they march; mindless sheep clinging to the memory of what they hope their future will become
---
Lamen term: DeadGame
---
The code is a pretty clear nope on Speed Demon. Not sure why anyone would expect it to work after reading it. There are basically three categories of mutations for the purposes of Class Freak:
---
1. The ones that actually use the spell magnitude. These work.
---
2. The ones that are explicitly written to use Class Freak. These usually work, barring typos.
---
3. The ones where the author was lazy and just wrote the negative as a fixed perk. These don't work.
---
Fun fact: The actual effect of Speed Demon's penalty is +40% hunger and thirst, not +50%. The text doesn't match what the perk does.
---
If you prefer tests, someone was nuts enough to test Speed Demon vs Class Freak by running around in circles a couple of weeks back. It doesn't work.
---
I'm honestly ok with it now that the soup doesnt expire.
---
Great way to get a quick stack of caps from your vending machine.
---
I wish they would allow us two camps. One for our main camp and a smaller one we can throw up when we are too over encumbered to fast travel and really need a bench and a bed. Lol
---
Completely false.  Sorry man.
---
Best way to stop people pvping it is to run circles around the building inside or outside while they try to take it from you but can‚Äôt find you and PvP you until they rage quit 
---
A superb grief
---
Sorry people replying on reddit made you try so hard. Cute though.
---
SHHHHHHHH lies lies. It actually steals your atoms and reduces your character level to 1. Please don‚Äôt do it, it summons scorchbeasts. This method does NOT work. *wink wink*
---
Thank you, I‚Äôll probably be off by then though.
---
It wouldn't drive me as nuts if it was weirdly consistent and ALL of them were like that, but yeah- just random ones not saying what they are for drives me crazy. It's like that for certain PA mods, too. "Tesla Coils." Great... for what?!?
---
They used to work prior to last patch or 2..... i suspect they were intentionally disabled to mitigate all the duping. But obviously I'm not sure. Many say it's just another of many bugs.
---
How would the ultracite compare to X1 and the 51?
---
Had the weirdest glitch with my first one. Never needed reloading. All my balls would go straight to the current ‚Äúmagazine‚Äù had hundreds at one point. I only wish it was legendary. Took them a while to patch it too, on a single shot rifle build it was awesome.
---
And at ammo factory as well.
---
The only robot who I hate more is the goddamn Mr. Farmhand I have to kick out of my camp a thousand times a day. I get it, you need compost. Try the wild dogs directly up the road behind you for godssake, smashing my fusion generator won't help you with that!
---
Switch to gatling plasma double the fun with half the cost, seriously the ammo on it is criminally easy to craft
---
I love pumping .38 or .44  rounds out of somone else's extractor. Then visiting it every once and awhile and clicking it again just incase they switched it
---
Agh not the lake! I already join enough games where I cant place my camp.
---
It's human nature. Look around and you'll see how majority of people agree it'll inflate prices. Just because you personally disagree and want something doesn't make it false
---
It's not for doing damage, it's for slowing/debuffing powerful enemies/bosses.
---
The ones that just say "Tesla Coils" tend to be for Excavator. If it scraps into black titanium it's an excavator mod.
---
But the game should tell you this. I know these are small details, but sometimes the small details are the ones players bump into the most and cause the more annoying QOL issues.
---
The Scorched in previously raider-associated areas wear things like road leathers and ski outfits. Given the Raiders' origins at the ski lodges I figured these Scorched were, in fact, the turned Raiders.
---
None of them seem to wear any armor, but I bet if they did there would be plenty wearing raider or metal armor.
---
If you see anything that sets off any alarms just let me know and ill try to change it. I dont want to set off any red flags
---
They *can* wear armor though. One of the raiders in Rose's quest line has full raider armor on, so it's not like they can't do it.
---
Some of the extra terminals worked for me only when another player was using the first one
---
Wish berry mentata worked for me damn it. Was trying out some new guns when I randomly get lit up by Some dude perched on the whitespring. "Alright fair enough" I thought while popping a berry mentats which lit up the surrounding ghouls just fine but no one else. Thinking hed taken off I go and grab my bag and then and make short work on another guy making a move towards me. 2 seconds later same guy again lights me up. So I go around the back of the building. This time unluckily getting attacked by mole rats. Still I made my way up the building. Checked my mentats. Still active yet apparently the dude was cloaked directly in front of me.
---
Generally whatever material the mod is made of can give you an idea as to which set it's for
---
Sshh! How am I supposed to impress people with my ludicrous number of pies if 99% are from the secret stash.
---
Yes, the game definitely took a performance hit, I had to recheck all my optimizations to make sure they didn't get undone because it got so bad. I'm on a 2080ti and struggling to hold a solid 60fps just wandering around now.
---
The issue with the T-series jetpacks is that the plans are a fairly common SBQ drop (or were a couple of weeks back), so most people can craft their own with 10 flux. 1000 caps is maybe the right ballpark, but if you want to clear the stash space then you should sell for less.
---
Not everything sells for less than default price though. Any plan that's relatively tricky to acquire (ie not sold at vendors) will sell easily, especially if it's useful or required for a possum challenge.
---
I figured, just wanted to make sure. With the perk cards saying different things than they actually do, I wouldn't be surprised about an oversight like that lol.
---
Oh snap, I forgot about that. Wonder they almost never wear the stuff, then - especially the former Brotherhood and / or Army personnel at places like Thunder Mountain.
---
https://youtu.be/MYcqToQzzGY
---
Thanks man! Its not hard to find some good spots, but switching to a nomadic play style really strains your caps however it could really be worth it if you find a spot with good business. But if you want some good locations I would be happy to help.
---
Could be parasites
---
Problem with this is that if you have a C.A.M.P in a popular area, it would be INSANELY hard to find a server, my C.A.M.P was taken 7 times when trying to log in last night, can't imagine what it would be like if the population went up :\
---
Tried junkies for a while but the penalty‚Äôs for using certain cems I started hating lowering your strength and intelligence
---
Yep. There's clearly factions of Scorched. They need to up the ante. I'd love to come across some Scorched wearing Enclave underarmor and bits of scout armor or BOS wearing BOS underarmor + BOS combat armor (perhaps give them a chance to drop those armor/items, too?). It'd make the world feel like even the soldiers turned Scorched, especially if they had some heavier resists to reflect the armor.
---
I‚Äôve found a few of them and sell them for 250 caps in my shop. They always sell!
---
I did this at game release to unlock all the mods I could for leather armor. Must have scrapped nearly 1000 leather arms just to see if I could unlock shadow leather. So happy they actually made the plans available at vendors.
---
Here you go
---
https://youtu.be/6k_iq2f2UQw
---
IIRC, since patch 9, TSEs are reported in the pipboy as having 2x20% extra damage, or 2x32% with max Demo Expert. I suspect that this is relatively accurate.
---
How in the sam hell did you do that????
---
Nope, I play in phases so I just stopped for a while.  I was playing blasted and reporting it never occured to me
---
Hi! Don‚Äôt worry about plans as a new player. Most camp plans can be earned through defending workshops and you get most weapon mods by scrapping every gun you get. As for Power Armor, here‚Äôs a quick guide 
---
T-51B Power Armor has the highest Damage and Energy resistance in the game. If you want a set that makes you very tanky in normal situations, this is it
---
X-01 Power armor has pretty good Damage and Energy resistance, but it excells all others in radiation resistance. I personally use this set for exploring/fighting in nuke zones. Makes me use less Radaway and take less damage from glowing ghouls
---
Excavator Armor has some of the lowest resistances but gives exceptional carry weight. It also lets you mine more ore from ore veins which is very useful. I can get about 1k lead just from mining all the ore in the Lucky Hole Mine 
---
T-60 has middle of the pack resistances but is very very easy to maintain whenever it gets broken . It also has very easy to find mods. The only thing is that all power armor breaks extremely slowly so if you can find mods for a T-51B set and can afford to the once in a blue moon repairs for it, the T-51B set js strictly superior
---
Yeah random rolls on existing items would be better imo, 
---
At the moment if I was interested in one melee weapon and something like a third of the legendaries there‚Äôd be a 1 in 1000 chance each time of getting the weapon I want
---
Those odds make it effectively impossible 
---
I would pay 300,500 scrip, or 5k caps to get a random legendary or re-roll a legendary on my weapon or something like this
---
IIrc it's to prevent duping. Stores only update when you access them. So if two people accessed it at the same time, they were able to buy the same items, thus duplicating them. Unless the devs already fixed that
---
adventure and survival.  2 different server types/gamemodes
---
 Nope...
---
Confirmed this over the last week.  
---
I crafted 10,000 rounds of .50 cal, 5,000 round of 5.56, and 3,000 rounds of shotgun shells over the last three days.  
---
I took the Ammo factory, Grafton Steel Mill, and and acid producing location.  I also farmed all of the lead and plastic locations. 
---
With full Ammo and Super Duper perks, I was crafting 10 shotgun shells to 1 at the ammo factory, 50 to 1 for 5.56 ammo, and about  200 to 1 for .50 cal. 
---
The ammo factory is only worth it if you don‚Äôt have the perk cards. Even so, it‚Äôs a silly PvP magnet so make sure that the first thing that you build is a stash box. 
---
I‚Äôve taken other workshops and never been bothered, take this one and you‚Äôre guaranteed that an idiot will come along, sooner or later, and one-shot you.
---
Sorry you had nothing more to say on the matter and felt the need to make a shallow attempt at petty jabs....good day
---
Nirvana and NIN exist in the fallout world but that would maybe be hard to get licenses for. 
---
 (If anyone doesn't know in FO2 new Reno had Nirvana and NIN posters on the walls.)
---
Disagree good sir/madam.  Good day.
---
It‚Äôs probably got something to do with optimization. But it would be a cool feature to work on after more important issues are addressed.
---
Feel free to add me Majistek for some back up
---
I bet there's a Wile E. Coyote moment too where your character just hangs in the air for a second until client/server fully catch up with each other.
---
Probably an assortment of melee weapons, otherwise you'll need a ton of ammo to make up for the lack of direct damage weapon class perks.
---
If you still want to use ranged weapons then perhaps using Revolvers, Non-Automatic Pistols, Rifles, and Shotguns with Concentrated Fire, Adrenaline, Gun Fu, and Luck based VATS/Crits are your best bet in order to get some damage out without directly buffing a weapon class so that it can count for any weapon. Crits could also work with something like the Medic legendary effect.
---
Lmao id like to think Kurt Cobain was a time traveling dimension jumping mutant hunter who didnt actually kill himself, just got stuck in fallout.
---
Grab a mining helmet. The light is so much nicer then the pipboy.
---
Mine is just up the hill from number 4, it‚Äôs a great spot.
---
Delicious. Mewl for me more little friend. Video games are serious business.
---
Good idea!
---
Can confirm, It does in fact force your camera away in a very jolting manner.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg1RNRgoz4U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg1RNRgoz4U)  Made a quick video recording the interaction, and it seems to activate more if you're moving your character and the camera at the same time versus just looking around without moving your feet.
---
Granny wants punching weapons, but all she gets is bone clubs and knifes.
---
Interesting! I don't think I had those options when I started playing, but maybe its something I had to unlock after the first time playing.
---
Guy shot at me, initiating pvp opportunity while I was using a vendor. I exited, turned around and gunned him down with my AAE Laser Rifle, he cried over the mic, and I turned back around to use the vendor.
---
He proceeded to report me for cheating/abuse because I was "preventing others from using the vendor via hacking". Ok, buddy.
---
I'm curious. Did you ever have an item named "Mothman Power Armor", or is that someone else's item name leaking through?
---
So we did another queen and that player attacked the queen all the time and did get the event completion loot. There must be a damage threshold. Thanks for the advice.
---
He spawns all the time near hemlock holes.
---
I think that they keep adding new scenes as they roll out updates.    
---
I‚Äôve been taking pictures of teddy bears and the scenes since I started playing in January, walked the whole map as a ranger, and never ran into this one.
---
I have a 2 Shot Plasma Gatling with 25% fire rate and +1 Agility for sale
---
Forget the mods, drop plans please. Oh, and fix that urban scout arm dmg resist bug and add the texture changes to mods like Shadow.
---
Seek help
---
Still buggy but worth it in my humble opinion. $20.00?  Wow.... lost slot of fans
---
Well I imagine most people play on one platform so it may be hard to gauge, but as someone who plays exclusively on PS4 I have to say it‚Äôs pretty good. Occasionally harassed by tools but that‚Äôs rare and pacifist makes it a minor annoyance. Generally people are friendly and helpful. Haven‚Äôt had too many issues with the game on a technical standpoint. Might get disconnect once in an all day session. Might go a week with no issues. Occasional glitches.
---
Oh I had no idea yeah that sounds fair then.
---
"All the time" Yeah no I wish.
---
Yeah this would just inflate prices
---
Have to go to the used sellers on amazon for that price
---
Rip
---
Yup, I'd much rather have 1 terminal than people exploiting by duping the hell out of everything. That just degrades the economy and destabilizes the server.  Hopefully they figure out a better solution and re-enable the other terminals next patch.
---
I did new character recently, man cooking pots, fires,... Are everywhere.
---
No prob glad to help out. And glad that player got loot
---
PC has a lot of quality of life fixes right now, notably a mod that lets you keep perk card loadouts and another that gives you a text chat option in-game with other people who have the mod. The community has been asking for those pretty much since launch, but so far only PC has it, and only due to modders. Player count might be a bit low, I tend to see familiar names a lot, but I think that might just be the game's matchmaking system, which is completely awful considering how hard the game (and especially some daily/weekly challenges) encourages you to server hop.
---
Afaik there aren't any real differences between the community among platforms, and it seems like in comparison to other online games the population here tends to be older and more peaceful. Don't let the aggressive reddit part of it throw you off guard. 
---
If it matters to you, xbox was the most heavily affected by duping, and I think PC was the least affected
---
And you didn‚Äôt test T-60 PA?
---
Come on, if you‚Äôre going to do something, do it right....   .grin.
---
Very low rate of getting a plan when you scrap them and expensive to make
---
I don't know if it's the same on pc but on x1 I've ran into him 4 times beside the munitions factory where the oil seep is right next to the cliff headed towards the cabin it never fails I grab the oil and he attacks. Hope this helps...
---
PC. 
---
The only downside to PC is the lack of text chat, which you can do through PSN's text chat. There's a mod for text chat, but I'm not sure how many people use it, and you can only chat with people that also have the mod. 
---
But on PC, you get higher framerates and a FOV slider. On PC, download speeds aren't bottlenecked by PSN. Speaking of PSN, you don't need that on PC. 
---
When they eventually add full mod support, the best ones will be on PC. Fallout 4 on consoles had mods, but there were some odd restrictions set by console manufacturers. But even without full mod support, there are already some really handy mods available on PC. 
---
You can always plug in a controller on PC, if that's a reason why you might want to go with PS4. 
---
Many of the larger streaming communities are on PC, and a really nice feature of 76 is how easy it is to jump in and play with people. 
---
PC hands down.
---
no way! events get f\*cked for low level players already, even for me (lvl 100). why? high lvl players who one-shot every creature except the big ones (SB queen, sheepsquatch, ...)! which means no experience + no loot for those who arent that strong. this is a huge problem as it makes some events unplayable or not beneficial at all.
---
best example is uranium fever...if theres only one &gt;150 player you wont get any loot out of this in the most cases. yes there are players like me who wait for everyone to have at least 1 shot landed on every creature...but the majority doesnt give a crap. so no! increasing population would lead to more frustration and hate... gameplay wise.
---
next thing is the server performace which is, right now, at the least, playable. and yet i havent had one day in this game where the servers dont lag out or i get DCed because the servers arent responding. before thinking about an increase they should fix the server related problems first. 
---
i can really understand why you wanna have more players in 1 session, but you cleary havent taken several points to consideration
---
Yeah, there was an issue with items not immediately updating over time, so people could dupe items by selling them to vendors with multiple consoles (like MODUS) and then having multiple people buy it back. This glitch resurfaced most recently with the whitesprings restaurant bots because they force you into a trade menu after sitting down, and I believe the fix was just completely disabling those vendors for now
---
Just curious, how many hours a day are you playing? Are you doing events or farming squad or what?
---
If I buy it through amazon will it be a case with a code inside? Its not labeled as a digital buy and has an actual time of delivery.
---
Most people give up after the first hour, but near the end of a Nuke at White Springs I find that there are about two spawns left, one right after the other, and that‚Äôs when I see the most 2* and 3* glowing ones....
---
Power Fist...DCG...MMG
---
Yes, it's a physical copy. The disk is a cardboard cutout with a code printed on it.
---
Bloodied...Executioners...AA
---
Oh do go on.
---
Thank you
---
i liked that feed the people did just that, it would "feed the people" of the server.
---
it did make it more fun to do.
---
No problem. Enjoy!
---
I have a few concerns and suggestions.
---
If you're relying on melee then you'll have to do a good amount of sprinting to close the distance with your enemies. That's a lot of AP to give up unless you're planning to take Marathoner. I suggest lowering Adrenaline down the level 2 which will still give you +42% at max which is still quite a lot and then Marathoner level 3.
---
This will allow you to sprint to enemies when you need it while also cutting down on AP costs which saves AP for power attacks and Dodgy.
---
I'm curious what you're using the 2 points in Charisma for, I could see 2 points working with a few perks depending on the situation:
---
If you're on a team:
---
Squad Maneuvers Level 2 - Get to enemies faster
---
Suppressor Level 2 - Makes you tanky in a one big baddie scenario
---
Tenderizer Level 1 + Squad Maneuvers Level 1 - Allows you to give your team more damage when you hit an enemy and makes you slightly faster.
---
Or, Combining "Strange in Number" with 1 point in any of the above options listed.
---
Solo:
---
Lone Wanderer Level 2: Less damage to you, more AP regen help with sprinting and power attacks.
---
Party Boy/Girl - More Strength, AP, or HP when you need it in a pinch depending on your drink of choice.
---
Suppressor/Tenderizer - Same reasons as above depending on if you're taking on multiple enemies or one tanky boss.
---
Field Surgeon - Faster healing is always nice if you need it.
---
Never mind I got one
---
I read that once the loot window comes up it can become public loot and when someone collects it they are taking yours. I don‚Äôt know how technically correct that is but I‚Äôve watched her entire inventory disappear one item at a time several times. Now as soon as she‚Äôs down I spam collect to avoid it. To quote Skyrim ‚Äúno lolly gaggin‚Äù. Just take it all then drop what you don‚Äôt want.
---
Platform?
---
Xbox
---
someday we should be getting the last 200 pounds.
---
no word on when though.
---
Hahaha aint this the truth
---
I would love this. The vendor gives me everything I don't want (crossbows, every pistol possible, cryolators, broadsiders up the wazoo).  If I could force a rifle from the vendor it would be great. Of course I'd get endless medics, junkies, exterminator, zealot, and hunter rifles but maybe secondary effects would be decent....
---
How many caps
---
I was planning on building a Krieg based on the maniac skill tree from borderlands 2. Where when ur health gets low you can activate his special (in fo76 this is just nerd rage). But now I am considering removing that aspect of the build so I can add more perks that fit the thematic aspect better, marathoner could be included in this
---
Can‚Äôt happen soon enough lol!thanks for the info.
---
Unfortunately the Collections Tab does not always work 100%.
---
Badge numbers can disappear or have the wrong number, but go to a vendor and then the correct number can be seen. For example, last night it had zero badges for me, today 3 of each badge.
---
&gt; AA
---
AA?
---
Make an offer
---
marathoner perk helps a lot.  its not perfect, but its much better.
---
I bought plans for a portable toilet and I don‚Äôt know how it looks like or where to find it lol.
---
Max caps I got is 1000 but you probably want more lol
---
Encryptid only tends to get ignored if it gets popped (usually by accident with a first time questgoer) during a SBQ battle.
---
By the time the Queen gets dealt with, there usually isn't enough time to jump over and kill the Encryptid boss before the timer runs out.
---
Most things work the opposite of how you described them lol. Caps are already ridiculously easy to get in this game, 1400 a day from vendors + an infinite amount in quantities of 26-100 from events + small change from super mutants, mirelurks, and containers/cap stashes. 
---
The cap limit forces people to spend caps, thus keeping the economy moving and preventing inflation. This is basic economic theory, increased spending leads to a stronger economy in the long run. Even a high school econ class could teach you that.
---
It's not a server issue for people playing the game normally, but it will become an issue once some asshat finds a way to exploit himself into an overflow or infinite cap source. Which you know will happen. If it isn't already possible, some future update will break something or introduce an incomplete feature that lets it happen. Not to mention there are still some dupers with months-untouched accounts with hundreds of thousands of nuka cherries/grapes on them
---
The issue with trade only items is not that they exist, but that after so many months and after claiming to care so much about the player economy, there is still no functional item-for-item trade system. With how easy caps are to get, they are worth very little, so in an item system so heavily dependent on RNG of course there will be items worth far more than any sum of caps. How much money would it take to sell your mother? Your childhood memories? Your personality? The same applies to all these bloodied explosive shits, even if half of them are duped
---
While there would be more trading done if people could go above 25k, any benefit from that would be completely mitigated by the fact that people are still capable of farming thousands upon thousands a day, and will have less restrictions on doing so
---
&gt; The only argument to not do it is some players will fear monger about inflation but the economy will do what it does. If the prices go up then that drop you sell is worth more and it balances. If the prices go down from a crash due to all the hoarders then there is no problem there either. The economy will be what it becomes.
---
lol. yeah, and the great depression was also the economy just being "what it becomes"
---
Yeah lot more than that. Lol
---
If you haven‚Äôt bulked stuff, bulk it. 
---
Then, any spare legendaries, get rid of those - scrip or otherwise. 
---
If you‚Äôre still over, find fun ways to use it - redo your CAMP if you want, go over the top with it! Make a new gun!
---
Anti-Armor
---
Worth a shot üòÇ
---
would a executioners gragnacks axe be any good
---
How many caps did it set you back?
---
Happy to trade for high capacity backpack plan
---
not as many people are showing up anymore. Less people taking out the eyebombs, less people dealing damage to the ISS, less targets for the robots to focus on
---
Bulk bulk and more bulk
---
Yep, and that info is spreading like wildfire.
---
It's only a problem if you're running a low-hp build. Stop leveraging BS mechanics and you'll stop having trouble with teslas.
---
I just assumed it was a loading bug when it happened to me. Then I read that it made sense. It certainly looked like the items were being collected a click at a time but I wasn‚Äôt clicking anything. Plausible for sure, but I have no idea. Just what I‚Äôve heard.
---
If u guys farming it let me know
---
i saw ‚Äúlong pew‚Äù and thought it was a gun
---
It does exist, it must be rng however. I remember seeing it twice, maybe out of 20 trips. I only go there anymore if I am buying a serum recipe
---
So the Long Pew is a bench?
---
;)
---
That‚Äôs right where I saw him! I freaked too, cause it was only the second time I‚Äôd seen him, but it was exactly that spot at the factory.
---
I found the legendaries I have via player vendors.
---
ahh....nope when you click play  it asks adventure or survival no unlock needed
---
What platform?  I have about 800 I'm selling for 1c a piece
---
Ps4 my good sir
---
Seems like that takes almost as much luck! Usually I see they have weapons and it‚Äôs just 10 standard combat shotguns for 100c lol or they have a 3* pool cue they‚Äôre asking 20K caps for.
---
It's as if it reads your build and gives you something you can't use effectively.
---
Clean the dog shit if possible too
---
Who agreed to this price value? If you don't like the prices, take yo ass somewhere else and buy them. Plenty of camps on the map selling shit.
---
Ha, yeah you're right. I'm usually chillin' up at the top of the steps just waiting for the deathclaw to come on up! That's when I unload my shotgun in his face. (On top of the green bus is a good place to wait it out, too!)
---
People never seem to remember that PS2 graphics look far worse than stuff like this.
---
A large quantity of dust usually is.
---
that is hilariously bad idea, I have just started trying to the SBQ I have dropped 3 nukes on fissure site prime in the past 2 days every time I don't get to her in time and have never gotten anything. Lets just say this skews over lover LvL players
---
Now I wonder if there's a way to game the system by switching to different perk cards. Of course you'd have to be a pretty high level to have all of the weapon perk cards.
---
I'll sell you as many as you want
---
But they're 4caps each
---
Just sold. Sorry
---
I'll be on at 9am CST 
---

Did you even read the post? I need them but not for ridiculous prices, 1 cap a piece, and if you're a good fella, maybe trade them directly for .5?

What fills in that blank, hmm? It's the internet...you can use curse words if that's your intention, it's okay, your grammy doesn't know how to use it to wash your mouth out with soap.
---
I price all my ammo at 1 cap for what I don‚Äôt need. Had someone earlier buy over 400 .45s. That was cool.
---
First time I encountered a mule salesman was similar. But he was pressuring us to hurry up and abruptly logged out, so I was sketched out.
---
Hmmm havent seen much ppl activating it either...might have 2 reasons: it either was completed recently or ppl dont want to play it. i highly believe that its rather the 2nd thing than the first one. i dont think that dead events are a problem of server population, heres is why: i personally like the event, but its not really beneficial enough to complete it without wanting a certain loot item. you bascially stand on one spot for 10mins, kill the alpha and thats it. the whole area looks so awesome, they really did a great job designing it, the event itself is average at the best :( but:  
---
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS ONE SHOT ULTRA GRINDING PLAYERS RUINING EVERY EVENT  
---
take uranium fever for instance....no matter at what time i join, wether nighttime or day time, this event is ALWAYS on cooldown. not enough that you cant play it when you want, since the last patch its also bugged at the moment so there are only 1-2 moles spawning every minute or so...  
---
but why have this mechanic then? whats the point of an event if non server hoppers cant play them?   
---
at least make it possible to play the most popular events more often....free range, encryptid, uranium fever and notify players when those events start.
---
Assuming full suits, Ultra has 80 more than t51b and 60 less than x01.
---
My main suit is partial Ultracite with some X01 to shore up the ER/RR a bit, since Suit-to-suit, x01 has 60 more ER/RR at the cost of 60 less DR. If you have grounded, I'd say Ultra is hands down the best power armor set. If I didn't occasionally use a gatling laser I'd definitely just run a flush suit of Ultra.

Well when I‚Äôm on next later tomorrow I‚Äôll add any Fusion cells I have. My PSN is BlueSkyla_8.

I got lucky the other day and found someone selling a sentinels/assasin piece for like 3k, i flipped it for 7k cuz i dont pvp. That's my new mission at this point, im like a house flipper, but with gear.
---
Yeah, not selling you anything you commie bastard. 
---
Beware of the Red Plague!
---
I‚Äôm guessing that person was joking.
---
Ps4?
---
Honestly I've never used one so i can't say for sure. But in my opinion, i don't think it's that great.
---
The way i see it is at best you reduce the amount of swings/attacks towards an enemy by 1. 
---
Note this is just an example and I'm keeping it very simple by excluding armor/defences. I could be way off too. If so i expect someone to correct me. 
---
Axe output is 300 dmg +/- 
---
Example#1 - Enemy with 1000 HP
---
In 2 swings you remove 600 HP and place enemy at 40% health so Legendary effect takes place.
---
Upgrades dmg output to 450dmg and 1 more swing removes the remaining 400 HP... without the effect, you would still have 100HP left and require another swing.
---
So how much is that worth to you? I suppose 1 less swing can be the difference between life and death depending on the situation. Imagine enemy only needs 1 more hit to kill you, he can match your attack speed, each time you hit, he hits back.
---
so you don't have the time to swing your axes twice. Because next hit you'll be dead. So being able to take out your enemy with 1 more swing would be ideal.
---
I sure hope so üòÇ
---
ABSOLUTELY!!!! PLEASE BETHESDA!!

This is really true - especially for quests like Mayor for a Day where the end is on a roof so you have at least 3 loading screens
---
Well look at you being all smart and stuff
---
Gonna need plastic, lots of it. Then Bulk the shit out of everything, and be sure to break down anything you can. Sell what you can't and burn the rest
---
well my thoughts on it is I have another one that only weights one pound due to the weightless effect and it also has instigating so it kills most things in one hit. I was thinking the executioners axe more for stuff like SBQ and imposter sheepsquach
---
Nothing in that body of text indicated cheating. Just reads like one twelvie griefing another twelvie.
---
Thank you for the link.  Plans with the same name?  You've got to be kidding me.  Now I know why I saw a locker plan that didn't say 'known'.  I had no idea there was another one.
---
Bulking only saves weight in aluminum and lead. You think youre saving weight but its really just the plastic youre using in the crafting.
---
I was a BoS player once, then took a crossbow bolt in my knee.
---
Bulking doesnt save weight lol
---
I'm thinking about how our world isn't far off post apocalyptic appearances despite not having had  a nuke dropped in these places. it's not necessarily a positive to have your breathe taken away, ye?

Sure it does, but only on things that are heavy, like the knowledge of what I did to those Brahmin or my child hood trauma.
---
Heck yes brother, the cause will be fought!
---
I sell them for 1c, but only to free up cache space. Sadly I have the habit to pick up everything. Once I had 9k 10mm ammo and I was unable to get rid of it, so I put in my vendor for free. I had to wait a whole week when someone took it.
---
Whilst true you come across like an entitled brat.
---
go to miners monument, next to uncanny caverns. on the stairs there can spawn a "dead tourist" named ansel, which has the camera + bucket list in its inventory. those "tourists" can spawn on certain spots, the monument one was the fastest for me...took about 1-3 reloads
---
Is it just Executioner or are there other perks?
---
Hoard less.
---
Just get AP refresh bits of armor. It's like having Action Boy/Girl without wasting the points
---
With headshots it will quicker deplete the head-bar and disorient the enemy. Will not kill him quicker. Can also instead quicker knock out their legs, making them crawl, which is great for melee enemies if you are a sniper or ranged. Actual damage is not affected.
---
Reddit.
---
The lowest they to is lvl 15 and that's raider PA. But there spawns raider armor at blackwater mines near the white spring. Also, there's a trailer in the George (I think that's what it's called?) junk yard that has a lvl 3 lock on it that has raider PA that spawns in it.
---
Aah yes, with enemies with massive HP, it should definitely help out more than my original example. Especially since your Instigating axe will lose all it's value right after that first hit. 
---
This is also why bloodied is the preferred melee. It will do huge amounts of damage more consistently. Sure you are low health, but with the right perks can help mitigate that. Like serendipity which causes 45% of all attacks on you to miss.
---
I mean in general the quills are hard bs they seem to do as they please
---
Yes and trickle down economics works too, hahahaha.
---
 I‚Äôve bulked everything but my flux lol!
---
Are you the conductor of the pooptrain?

---
Now watch Kotaku get the title of this post to make a totally bs article about players getting reported and banned for no reason in FO76
---
Wow, the same dude who complained about weapon prices is now complaining about ammo prices. Shocked shocked I tell you. Mr big spender, did you message this guy telling calling him names and be rude like you did the other person?
---
You‚Äôre just paranoid - I move all of my Legendaries and valuable items to my low level alt to sell to keep space free in my main‚Äôs stash.
---
How about bigger teams? 6 Or 8 would be nice
---
You could sell me a max lvl aae combat rifle is you have one. That would save stash space :)
---
Eh not that great then
---
The only one star I would consider decent is instigating.

If it had Swing speed it‚Äôd be okay.

I‚Äôve leveled an alt since the vendor update, and your correct. Much easier. Afterwards I believe that you shouldn‚Äôt have access until a certain point, maybe a lvl, maybe a quest, maybe something. It‚Äôs not gonna change so not worth more words. But I missed out on a lot of experiences when I just fast travelled everywhere.
---
Yeah, and to make it even worse some of the names of the plans are switched around too; like the 'Vault-Tec beds' and the 'simple beds'
---
I'm glad but any idea if they mentioned fixing this issue?
---
Flog.

I never said it would not inflate prices.  Re-read the post.

That was literally the only time in the series they did something useful and objectively good
---
They just went down on Xbox
---
That's what I thought the included personal computer was going to allow! Tracking the events you want to do!
---
no offense but if you really wish for that you either havent played fallout 76 much or you're too lazy to wander around. NEARLY every bigger camp, location, building, ... has a fireplace, cooking stove or whatever thing to cook stuff. allowing players to place fires everywhere would lead to an enormous spam of those structures and also might block spots to build on for others players and so on. its nice that ppl want to improve the game with their suggestions but most of them, like this one, arent thought through at all. they rather tell you that OP is a lazy player....
---
I‚Äôve got one also w +250 while reloading on Xbox.
---
I usually run arktos with a set of mates ready to roll. But recently Arktos has been causing hard freezes after you use the elevator or when someone else comes down while you're inside.
---
Seems that if one person goes in and starts the event, porting to the event puts you inside and avoids the crash
---
 The thing about AA on melee, not unarmed, is that Incisor gives you 75% AA. AA on top will get you to maybe 90% which is not that big a deal.
---
What's your psn? He is not on my server
---
I rebuilt my most recent camp in a nuke zone. Ended up using like 30 RadAway.
---
So that's what that pink stuff is! I always wondered about it, but never googled what it was. Do you have anymore pvp tips or tricks OP? I raised my main mule to level 50, to be able to use all my good stored items. Still getting to grips with the mechanics.
---
Those are legendary, so they spend a much higher proportion of their time above 40% due to the legendary regen. You'd do more damage overall running Bloodied with 80% hp, or AA or Furious, even though those aren't ideal for 2H melee weapons.

---
And well done on your part.  I need to get more chameleon pieces myself.
---
I typically dont PvP but some useful stuff I know of is use gamma guns/executioners to deal with bloodied builds, vats crits for for any senario (can't vats invisible enemies), berry mentats to find stealth builds, ive also heard that if you can manage it the syringer can be decent to get a shot in with to lower DR before you go for the kill. I'm sure other people can give better tips.

It should still provide a drop percentage decrease in the negative effect off the mutation per tooltip. 25% - 50% - 75%

Kotaku is trash, not worth reading.

How is it possible this exact same post was made by someone else also.....

I was playing Mordhau with a friend yesterday in a mode called Horde where theres waves of enemies. And when we die and spectate other people we just say "GJ" "you're doing well" "keep going" and there was one guy that was like "shut up you are dead you have no right to talk"

Nice, thanks for the info, much appreciated! I wanted to give it another try, as i am mainly pve orientated.

It falls into my news feed and it blows my mind how this author gets negative posts from this Reddit, post that only show up like 5% of the time like the kids crying that their duped weapons disappeared, and he makes huge articles about it, and never ever writes an article about all the good changes. I go to the comments to explain how that's not the case and the people there call me a sheep, and then I explain that Kotaku will only always use negative posts so at the end of the month all you see is 90% negative content from FO76 if you're reading Kotaku. Now my posts there never get approved haha. Really trying to get people to think and research for themselves, because want a fair judgment for everything, and I'm getting punished for it.

Have you tried in PvP?  I've found I can apply effects like Karma and Bleedout to non-hostile players using the syringer.

It was pretty good in Fallout 4 and was not just a utility weapon.  They butchered the weapon.  Even the snowball barrel mod was completely neutered.  It takes 25 shots to begin freezing an enemy and it does very little damage with damage cards.  The weapon is just terrible and its only saving grace is that it can slow bosses down.  It is useful for like 3 events so why bother sinking the resources into it?  Just watch Captainoob try to use it.
---
But it is not the worst weapon.  That title belongs to the Broadsider.
---
Sounds good

üòÇ Stalker maybe?

Can you link the user for me, I‚Äôm deadass scared about that for some reason

I always run Encryptid. Jump on, check the map and do any missions that interest me. Check the silos to see who is in one, (if they are, I prepare for a nuke run, if not), sleep, eat relish, play some tunes, Goto Encryptid. The world notification usually gathers a handful of players. Smash that b!tch, then head over to Campfire Tales (if it's night), smash that then head back over to Southern Belle to trigger Free Range.
---
Usually by now, Uranium Fever, One Violent Night or another event that's worth doing is up, do that then Solo a Silo, Smash the Queen then take care of housekeeping afterwards.
---
I have only seen once where no one has appeared for Encryptid, and it's possible the tint notification in the corner was missed

To be honest I quit playing and I cant remember if it was still there.

Yep, check out the link to the first test from a while ago. The debuff is applied to the target and can be seen under "Effects" in pip-boy. Damage reduction (and Energy Resistance) remain unchanged, and there's no damage increase.
---
Yep. Made and scrapped hundreds of them before I finally learned the suppressor.  Didn't keep tabs on how many, but somewhere between 300 and 500.

I can safely guess I have max caps invested in learning the mods.

I have an 3* explosive bloodied .45 sub machine gun and with commando PERKS and demolition it gets 65 dmg per shot at full health, at about 1/3 health its 88 per shot. Tie that in to my adrenaline it can get to 96ish.
---
As someone who plays a field medic build, I would like to point out that while this is a solid build if you want to run every card, you could sacrifice some points in ch for 9 points and run 3 cards of your choosing or 2-3star cards a 1star card, and magnetic for a full 15 ch in a party. Also Endurance cards are op as hell and can heal out of combat team members from anywhere on the map. There is also rev where you give 50% more damage to people you stim. Also in luck- better criticals with a vats heal pump shotgun is a great short range heal that is equivalent to two full stems. And the un sung hero healing rain works in combat if you really want to get regen in a storm. Just some stuff I have learned, Hope it helps.

From reading the ESM, my best guess is that Endangerol actually gives the \*target\* an armor penetration buff on its attacks, and 75% rather than 25% (more bugs). Might be worth trying a PvP test with your mule.

Ive baught a few from player shops , idk were they got em, but there out there

the best spots i found for my lazy capitaliism (trademark pending kappa) type of playstyle have been on the roadside outside flatwoods in on the road between overseers camp, and over by the legendary vendor. it seems to see the most traffic by players of all levels for some reason, but... the scenery isnt the absolute best. ive raked in the caps, but theres probably some better locations that i havent thought of yet.
---
There was also a bug where stagger would shake the weapon out of the legendary or creature and if someone grabbed it while it was rolling around, you lost your legendary if it was yours rolling around.

As someone who plays a field medic I love seeing downed people get dumbfounded by the 50% damage bonus I just gave them on top of ap regen for 10 mins and stupid amounts of hp regen from one stim. Team members never worry about taking hits as field sergeant + team medic + 45% better healing from stim packs give me and everyone near me 118% healing with 80+% healing regen with super stim packs. Your dps will very from build to build though. Personally I use an enforcer pump shotgun build to cripple big and small targets for easy enemy control. I also run explosives 2 for 50% more blast radios. Do not shy away from throwing explosives and the fatman. The more adds you tag and break the legs of, the more your team reaps in the from of exp,loot from shared tags, and not having to worry about their bloody asses flanked or hit from multiple enemies. Just remember you deal with the adds to break legs and let your dps finish them off. You tag mobs with bombs, and keep the enemy low on hp so your dps can flatten what you cannot in one go.

I have an HP laptop that was $600, has an AMD Vega 8 and a Ryzen 5 and it only barely plays on lowest settings. So it's gonna have to be better than that. The Intel UHD 620 is less capable than the Vega 8, so you're definitely going to need a discrete GPU.

Your service rifle, given your description, will be immediately made redundant because it uses the Handmade's ammo, and I'd suggest to replace it with FNV's Assault Carbine that uses 5mm with ~15-25% less damage than the Handmade instead.

I'm playing on a cheapo Acer Nitro. I payed like $450 for it I think. It runs the game on low detail at 60 fps, not the best. It is stable enough and Fallout is kinda an ugly game anyways.
---
 My bro and I built a PC runs it at ultra 60 fps easy all day 4k screen, but that thing costs like $800 plus time. 
---
A $350 dollar difference is considerable on a budget, but for a hardcore gamer it seems to be nothing cuz I watch peeps online with $2k rigs. Which is utter overkill for a game like this lol.

Sadly, many people swallow the crap they peddle, so thwy will keep doing it.

However, it is funny when one of their writers goes a little too far to find drama where there isn't any. I don't read the articles, but seeing them get torn to shreds on Twitter is a good laugh.

The title of this is actually the best.

Can grind legendary Bloatflys that spawn from shooting legendaries, instead of wasting time shooting legendaries with Endangerol that doesn't work.

Oh god! Ah oh so many laughs, stomach hurting

Which is really sad. Bethesda doesn‚Äôt realize that if you let people‚Äôs capacity grow, they will spend more time and atoms for the in-game assets. Top spenders are those who play a lot. In what kind of world where people are only allowed to work so much, spend so much and your bank account is capped at the same amount as when you were born.

Thank you!
---
Thanks for the excellent answer.
---
Very convenient huh...
---
I can get a Scorched Beast down in 2 shots (from 2 separate Dragons) and most players in 1. They are my go to weapons for opening an engagement.
---
That would be truly petty and pathetic
---
I have this bug and switching serves dont fix it
---
it just.. fixed itself?
---
Welcome to the world of online gaming haha, but hopefully you‚Äôre right and he was just a good sport
---
Let me restate it.  Most of us never accept trades to begin with, so we don‚Äôt care about hiding stars.  
---
Player vending has cut down on player trading.
---
I think defence comes from perk cards. Home defence
---
[](/grinlestia)If they're still dead set on no human NPC's then I would love the option to spawn in as fodder raiders, You know, 75 health, shitty teir one raider armor, one stimpack, a random chem, and an unmodded pipe pistol. Our character randomly screaming raider lines.  
---
It'd be a separate que or something. You might even get little rewards for your main character or something? I feel like this system where the raiders are meant to be fodder would solve the problem that current pvp has where it's less of two wastelanders running into each other, but two protagonists running into each other.  
---
Anyway that's my 2 cents.
---
I also need the metal picnic table but recently got the mirror ball off Grahm lol. The windmill is a random plan reward from doing the powerplant events
---
So he reported you because you were hacking?
---
That would be so much fun.
---
Have you played in the dueling servers recently? Maybe it's because I've been playing late at night but it seems like the number of trolls who just around killing people is getting higher by the day.
---
No problem bud!
---
I think it looks pretty much on par
---
I only get broadsiders!
---
You can‚Äôt get it by scrapping. Only by finding the plan at a spawn point.
---
Last time, I saw decent humour.
---
This time, it's more than a little forced.
---
I REALLY want a Bloodied/Explosive/25% less VATS cost Radium Rifle. SOOOO nice for PVP.
---
Might want to use something other than asterisks, since that's causing a whole lot of bolding.
---
I literally just said it was a convenience option lmao
---
This seriously isn't an uncommon post being parodied - a lot of the posts on this forum are written from a position of entitled frustration and are asking to be given money (easy way to earn caps), drops from legendaries (3 star mobs should drop 3 star gear), that bethesda should listen to them personally as if they were a passive aggressive parent scolding a guilty child ("Hey, Bethy darling, it's time to have a tinsey little talk..."); and it does go on if you **Sort by New** and spend some time looking back through the post history
---
True enough.  I did find an explosive double-barreled shotty.  It has another effect, damned if I can remember.
---
But I only buy it if it's reasonably priced.  And this one was.
---
If he was repeatedly targeting low levels because he wasn't skilled enough to face a real threat like OP, then I'd say that's a griefer.
---
Dueling? No, Horde
---
Works well in theory but a lot unlock multiple things.
---
You'll get 20 whole Atoms at 1776 hours. Get after it!
---
If this was my kid...
---
Wow, that's quite sad that it isn't working. I carried my Endangerol Syringer with since... atleast 120h I think.
---
Which is a shame. I used to like reading it when it was new but it hasn't been worth the digital paper it is printed on in a long time.
---
Hehe, I'm at 68, still getting the cards I'll use.  But eh, I'll keep looking for deals.
---
Yes please increase pop size!
---
Wow! Just a hair on the side of hyper-sensitive speculation. Your adamance is a hair on the side of suspicious, if not downright telling.
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
No doubt!
---
One time I was still searching for the camera and some awesome dude in ultracite power armor stopped me at the entrance of wavy willards (I think thats what its called) and gave me the thumbs down, in a way telling me it wasn't there. I should have messaged that guy, he was the best player I've ever met and it was for ten seconds.
---
Yeah I just buy the mods at WS bunker
---
They don't go real journalism, ANYWHERE!  All they do is talk to other blue checks marks instead of getting out of their echo chamber.
---
Lolol trolls will be trolls always playing the victim looking for attention!
---
Don't play other online games.  Have been continuously running Norton Security, SuperAntispyware, and Malwarebytes but only Norton is set for continuous monitoring.  Fallout 76 full screen - no messing with the .ini file; no mods.  Not going to uninstall Fallout 76 unless absolutely necessary.  Task Manager set to "always on top" or at least it was - will check that and will check its operation with Fallout 76 running "normally."
---
Yes, they give you the shotgun, missle and laser turrets. You can simply unequip the perk cards after you‚Äôve built them.
---
You throw 10 d6's -- what's the probability of getting 6 6's out of 10?  The same as any other result.
---
Bet you made around 26 caps of it ;)
---
I actually had a nice spot in savage divide, on the cliff right next to monongah. I had the powerplant, a power armor spaw and two stations right next to me
---
And upgrade it to the bright lamp, I've not been without this since launch
---
 As that's an Enclave operation and Combat Armour is really a BoS thing you ain't gonna find it there. Just Urban and Forest stuff as well as the X0-1.
---
 As a user of that mod I can say I have found 2 in several months of play. I have never seen plans and the Dense mod for Combat Armour is very rare.
---
Yeah me too! Its just no fun getting faceraped by tse sentinal builds all the time so i got gud scrub. I suggest you do the same and next time someone is trying to help dont be such a snarky little shit üëç
---
Ah I finally got one of my friends to place most of it, i‚Äôm damn near outta caps since i bought some stuff too man thanks though!
---
 In addition to other folk's recommendations of resting and cranberry juice, stew from the feed the people event adds exp bonus, as does completing the mothman thing at the lighthouse, and leader bobbles. Sometimes you can find the bobbleheads for cheap from player vendors. You can also get a decent bonus in a party with the right charisma perk cards, you don't actually have to do anything with them just be teamed up. 
---
Lastly, *cook everything.* It don't matter if it doesn't sell for more, or sits in your inventory and rots, it's worth the experience. Eggs, dude. You can get 28 mothman eggs in point pleasant. Radtoad eggs are great, too. Good for 28-70 exp per omelette with just rested exp, pop some grape mentats and sell those suckers. And meat from hordes or defending workshops. Or oodles of soups from silva farm and neighbor, all that corn and grain just sitting there. Add a couple of those exp bonuses before donning your chef hat, and you'll be right as rain.
---
I've bought the dense mods from the Watoga vendors. Some server hopping was involved.
---
Whitespring. Loads of yellowcake on the grounds and cobalt out the front by the road.
---
I had this happen to me. Spent 10k on an explosive shotty. And couldn't find it. It renamed to my T51b pa. Very odd.
---
But the guys playing how he wants. I don't support the behavior, but it is part of the game. Reminds me of GTA. I spend hours and hours doing all kinds of stuff. I spend 5 minutes killing people and all of a sudden I am the asshole.
---
After launching on SBQ twice where nobody turned up I decided to switch servers and message a few of the high level players to see if I could get them over. I got a load of abuse back and still nobody turned up to my third go so having a way of notifying people won't guarantee people actually come. The devs need to balance benefit to the sender with potential for annoyance of the receivers.
---
I‚Äôve almost never had bad interactions with people but when I do, it‚Äôs exactly this type of shit. There‚Äôs no middle ground. It‚Äôs either 0 or 100 on the scale of ‚Äúsalty‚Äù.
---
I did not enter into any agreement with you, or anyone else. Where specifically did you agree to this price, anyway?
---
Fusion cells are Worthwhile to you and are Priced by others: it's your responsibility in this game to  either seek out sources of fusion cells in the world that agree with your cost-to-benefit ratio or to make them for yourself. Ah, the glorious free market: where people charge 9999 caps for a slice of pie and ammunition sometimes comes at a premium
---
You're looking for a legendary harpoon gun? I've got a vampire's explosive harpoon gun if you're interested (I think it's level 40 though) with 25% less vats action point cost
---
While not necessarily low-level, if you can make it to the back of the whitespring you can jump on top of a wall and walk along it to a certain distance where you're invincible (ferals can't reach you). The only issue I can see you having is not being able to kill them, but that's what the robots are there for, right?
---
Funny thing he wasn‚Äôt wrong, you were using an aimbot.  Commonly known as V.A.T.S.  &gt;.&gt;
---
Maybe have diff color for crafting aircraft mods
---
Reminds me of this fellow i found chillaxing outside a blastzone XD

Im terrified by how much this sounds like a friend of a friend's friend. And it was on xbox. I know mouthy teens aren't rare on any platform, but this sounds like his stupidity.
---
I know that. Polymer works, I have successfully applied that to all pieces. But several of the secondary ones do not. Believe me, I've thoroughly tested it. Sleek, Custom Fitted etc. hasn't worked for either left leg, right leg, left arm, right arm nor chest. I've had some luck with pocketed and light, but that's about it. 
---
Like I said, I've had this issue for months for my favourite set of armour. I've tried everything. I've had 20+ different scout armor mods in my inventory that couldn't be applied to either piece of my urban and forest scout armour sets.
---
Only lead and aluminum...   any weight saved on the other stuff is just you using up the plastic.  Of course, bulk stuff can be sold at vendors but you are better off using the plastic to make shotgun shells.
---
Go to the Skyrim Easter egg place near the bottom of the map in the savage divide. Crossbow and spear spawns there. No bolts, though.
---
Ok thanks good to know
---
Nah, not enough invisible limbs and disembodied heads for that.
---
This is a glitch in the Matrix and the agents are working on it right now.
---
So, griefing is ok because it isn't specifically banned, but calling out griefers isn't ok because...?
---
It isn't grieving is my point. If it makes you mad I understand. I would be upset too if I got killed, but it wouldn't provoke me to call someone out for playing how they wanted to without cheating.
---
I'm sure the bot at watoga train station has a lot of weapon plans if that's what you want.
---
That's what I do too...   as soon as she is down, I race to her and spam take everything.  The only thing that I don't keep is the hide.  The bone can be scrapped for bone and ultracite.
---
I know this is super selfish but I really hope the younger teens like you just described don't find their way to this game to be honest. To many game communities got wrecked already because of these kids.
---
&gt; He comes at me again trying to fight me again saying he reported me for hacking to see him and using an aimbot.
---
Oh wow, using an aimbot in FO76, how dare you.  :)
---
Oh my.
---
Let's say for the sake of argument that you're right, he's not griefing.  I still don't see why it's a reportable offense to mistakenly accuse someone of griefing.  It's not like he swore or used slurs.
---
I often think today's kids are going to ruin online games in general with their garbage behavior.
---
Then I read a post like this and it gives me a great deal of hope.
---
Their weapons where rubbish they got big headed and thought they where special all recipes for disaster,people never change.
---
Some people don't get this is a joke, huh?
---
Has anyone gotten this one yet?
---
This has happened to me more than I like. Spawn inside CAMP, spawn inside rocks next to CAMP, die while being attacked while being stuck inside building or rock. Very irritating.
---
Welcome to the military lol.
---
Got one myself and I love it,got the long barrel on it God this alone made a massive difference,also have the short recon scope as it's good for tagging enemy's is there a stock mod for it?
---
Got the sight mod from
---
i hope in the future they allow players to disarm punji boards, by flipping them over
---
I bought the mod from a player wasn't cheap,it's so much better as I can take a lot less damage from enemy's as my chest peice took the brunt of attacks.
---
I know this question is old, was searching for something else and saw some bad info responses
---
but use the shotgun mod with an explosive tesla, along with the explosive perk.. it doesn't lose rifle perk benefits
---
it is extremely powerful and uses very cheap ammo, really only bad vs queen because of the energy armor pen bug
---
you can solo ark easily with it, even with dense/r3 fireproof it still does damage to yourself, so you have to be careful
---
I made these just for you:

Oh wow! That is good news, and I'll definitely be keeping it for now. If I ever was to sell it I wouldn't charge that much as it's only cosmetic. 
---
There is something really addictive about collecting outfits in this game. So far I have; grey fisherman's overalls, longshoreman outfit, clean army fatigues, a colour of ski suit I've never seen before, clean straight jacket, and hunters long coat. All from the robot vendor I think!
---
Might eventually start a shop selling rare outfits.
---
Be careful as there is a marine dense that's misleading as it looks like it's for combat.
---
If you do manage to get the enclave scout chest the dense mos is very easy to get.
---
Opinion pieces are trash. Journalism bits tend to be okay.
---
I'd really only want either a bloodied variant or a quad/explosive. Thanks though.
---
Ran the Burrows a couple times at release. Normal and nuked. I never for anything from it at all. Haven't been back since
---
This is extremely helpful, thank you, power armour seemed so overwhelming at the time, but this is much easier. Couldn‚Äôt find anything online that was helpful
---
Too relatable
---
Is there a location I could server hop and have it spawn?
---
And do a daily or every other day core run as you can go threw them quickly but there is a perk you can use to make them last longer,Mt first character uses power armor but my second don't and I can carry more weight than the excavations with calabrated shocks about 480 with the scout backpack with the high capacity mod with 4 pecies of deep pocketed armor.
---
I do use the t51-b with nuka cola paint and the t-60 for going into nuke zones.
---
Same. Not hating on the game, it's actually in a good spot right now but it became boring to me. I won't even do the challenges anymore. Just get a few caps, sell some legendary and log off.
---
Someone told me they don't want to split up there player base.
---
I think it's a good idea. Make everything level 50 minimum but have the option to go back to the normal server if you want.
---
If they did this a lot more of the map would be used more often alongnwith quests in those areas. I don't go into any area that dosent give me level 50+ enemies because equipment wise I have 0 chance at finding better equipment than I've currently got.
---
I think the most ridiculous thing in this thread is that he said that repeatedly attacking lower level players and disrupting their gameplay isn't griefing.
---
Bohemoth Deathclaw now plz
---
Yeah I figured, but shows how some people really think in a negative way slightly more than in a positive way.
---
There's a couple stock mods. I made and scrapped like 10 of them lol
---
The adventure servers have been diluted by the survival servers, so I'm guessing, but maybe as there are more server worlds for the same people and many higher level players have moved to survival we will be drawing on a smaller pool of players for the nuke SBQ fights.
---
Survival is PVP kill or be killed with no room for Scorched Earth Queen kill rando team
---
I still see nukes on most servers and join SBQ fights, just not as many as before the survival was released.
---
There seems to be a general tone based on following the threads here that there are more general complaints on the PC.  But you get access to add-ons like the loadout manager for perk cards which us console players would dearly love to have.  Also, building a CAMP would be a ton easier with a mouse and keyboard.
---
The Xbox community seems to be a bit younger and maybe a bit less mature crowd.
---
From a community perspective, I find that the PS4 community seems to be a more friendly environment.  But I might be a bit biased being a PS4 player.  
---
I have all three platforms and chose to go with the PS4 for this game simply because I feel that it leans towards a community that more reflects general society, with a mix of ages and backgrounds.  But that's just my personal opinion.
---
Nice thing about the PS4 is that it saves the last 15 minutes of gameplay- report that language to Beth and they would probably get a suspension with video evidence
---
What‚Äôs your PSN?
---
The scorchbeast
---
I must be really lucky, I done maybe 6 the last week whenever it pops up on my screen and there's usually at least a dozen other players that show up there
---
I've done it plenty of times recently without a problem so just luck regarding who is on the server I guess. It's best to see before doing a silo run what level other people are.
---
Not this but I've got a bug where I have to keep switchin weapons to get them to show the right damage amount,only happened since last patch.
---
Congratulations! You have attained the rank of.... Hyena! (taking out the trash and having a good laugh about it!)
---
Not just them, i have seen it happen with other enemies. I got killed yesterday by a deathclaw that hit me and killed me through a house. I didn't knew he was there but he sure knew I was.
---
I got one a week after the game came out and I accidently ate it during a fight
---
Don't go to it anymore as I keep getting the same plans or I already have them,plus it's quite heavy on ammo and stimpacks as I run a bloodied build.
---
NO! MINE IS!!
---
That‚Äôs helpful, I‚Äôve been wanted to get some decent armour, thank you
---
Lol I bet you feel like you taught him. Honestly for all the annoying/shitty things people can do in games without saying a word it makes me believe you should just have to deal with peoples outrages.. like who cares. You've got the internet between you and them. The comm ban system encourages us all to be twats until we're told as much, then bam! just report that person and feel ohh sooo justified whilst having acted like a cunt yourself. Idk just seems like your proud of a whole bunch of nothing. Imo! Before y'all drown me with downvotes lol
---
I recently had one of those days. I did an event in the mire that gave me a travlling leather coat then the purveyor gave me a bit of unyielding sentinel +luck scout armor.
---
I'm sure I've seen them on the bot at harrpers ferry and watoga train station.
---
I've scrapped a few with very little mods getting unlocked.
---
Cant be done right now, already lag issues when lots of people doing large event, rollback, disappearing loots...
---
+ 50 peoples mean 50 camps, when we already have 80 %  around whitespring.
---
If we want like, 50 players, we need a bigger map.
---
You can get some from the scorchbeast queen
---
There is just less players overall, nothing to do with survival on my friend list rarely any one is playing survival because it's totally broken. Luckily i can do sbq solo when i feel like doing it.
---
Serendipity is a must also I use ironclad ,dodgy and use unyielding armor but I managed to buy the dense combat armor mod from a player this alone has made a big difference,but supermutants with assult rifles and some gusts still shred for some reason.
---
In my experience high level players just ignore it now.
---
I launch a nuke at least once a day for SBQ. I've also done at minimum 2 fights a day on XB1, what system are you on?
---
Better be careful, Bethesda might make you write a paper on why cheating is bad
---
Because 3 level 20 players showing up just makes the queen harder to kill and wastes ammo. Level 20s shouldn't even be anywhere near the Scorched Earth event. They simply cannot make any meaningful contribution; they only do harm. That irrates the people who actually do damage to the queen with their primed 50 cals and Gatlin plasmas and so on. So they don't just jump at every rando queen nuke. They do the ones they've prepared for and launched, or where they know they have a team that can overcome the added damage resistance the hangers-on give the queen in a relatively short time. 
---
New players can wait until they've leveled enough to get the gear to be helpful before taking on the queen. Don't feel bummed out for any level 20s that showed up at Scorched Earth. Feel sorry for any high level folks who thought about going until they saw their dots on the map.
---
Idk if your system has the social menu for the game, but try to check on the lfg posts if it does. That's how I find all my good sbq fights.
---
Imagine spending billions of US tax payer money to make a state-of-the-art optical camouflage tool for your soldiers and some fruit flavoured candy defeats it...  
---
That said, it was a really fun anecdote, good job, my friend!
---
Has anyone else noticed a bloodied stealth nerf? My handmade lists the same damage, but doesn't one shot mutants or other enemies like it used to. My AA seems far mode effective now. Maybe I'm just paranoid lol.
---
Updated with tests after /u/jaj22 commented. It's pretty ... significant. Guess there's a reason "danger" is in the name.
---
Whats wrong with the people who rp as raiders?
---
Nothing, I just miss human npc's.
---
They're not all dead... There's a raider in the Arena (with the Power Armour) at the Top of the World who has been standing up preparing to do star jumps for about... 7 months?
---
Why the downvotes? It's very true.
---
Yes please
---
Drink some coffee
---
What actually is the current number of players per adventure world?
---
Cool
---
Does this actually cause a loss of ammo? I had assumed it was just added back to your pool, but I've got too much ammo to keep track.
---
This happens with my camera all the time, I'd like to think I'd notice losing a whole film per login. I really hope I'm not, crystals and silver are uncommon in my circles.
---
Thak you! Well I didn't know who she was tbh, so I googled her and yeah, there's something that makes her look similar. As someone said in other comment, it must be the haircut.
---
 Really? There are 3 weapon buffs of 3 each for 1 and 2 hand weapons, that's 9. There's 3 levels of Incisor for AP and 3 levels of Martial Artist for a grand total of 15 Strength points. ;)
---
They were probably a bunch of poopy heads
---
While i get your concern your wording is still giving me this mental Image. Sorry, but not sorry. 
---
[https://imgur.com/gallery/PCflG9l](https://imgur.com/gallery/PCflG9l)
---
You sure this doesn't have to do with Odd Future's Camp Flog Gnaw?
---
Actually, haircut not much of a problem, since it's the easiest thing to change on the go. In fact I had another 2 haircuts in mind for her. I chose that to fit in the role of tough survivor.
---
What system are you on mate? I've unlocked it on xbox.
---
He might not be using incisor or martial artist. I generally dont use it since i have a AA SS DCG and dont exactly need extra SS or AA for it so that would free up 6 slots.
---
You're right, plus that'd make a new reason to hold onto 5mm when the even the minigun itself is near useless. Maybe give it high DPS, with the semi-auto receiver shooting as fast as you can pull the trigger.

I was trying to farm Mutfruit outside Morgantown last night when I kept entering the radius of Mama Dolche's and 'joining' the event.
---
Would've been fine, but there was a lower level there doing the event and I was all too aware that when I came close I'd show up as a teammate to them automatically, perhaps giving the impression that I was there to help - even leech the event reward, I guess.
---
That's always mid level though. If you get the key off the rollercoaster for New River Gorge Bridge West there's level 15 PA in there.
---
As I told someone else, I can always easily change her haircut on the go to any of the other 2 I had in mind. The hard work was the face and it seems like I nailed it hahaha.
---
Alright not grieving, call it abusing and/or harassing, whatever you want.
---
His freedom to play however he feels like is hindering lower level players from playing however they want.
---
Thats why I keep asking bethesda to only allow pvp if both parties agree.
---
A shame we can't share characters. I would share her settings with you if it was possible. All I can tell you is I started from preset 5.
---
I used to have a few of these on my bridge. I've had quite a few people walk over and past my base without even stopping to appreciate it! A rusty nail through the foot worked wonders to remedy that. 
---
Of course, lately with my camp being immune to retaliation I removed those particular boards in favour of more decorations.
---
I feel like that is part of the grind though. I never held it against anyone. It is part of being out in the wasteland and having to navigate while you are lower. Every one has their own opinions. I personally wouldn't like an agreement option. The entire world should be open PVP with select few safe zones. That is my preference anyway.

When in doubt, temporarily put up the construction lights to light up your build area, thats what theyre there for

Mine is not their either!

&gt;  If we're talking about stable and better-education places like Japan, Norway, Sweden, Swistzerland, The Netherlands etc, it's safe to assume most people will speak English.
---
... and yet, most people in Japan do not speak English. It's only taught for two years in Junior High, and students are not motivated to pay attention and learn it. Plenty of people in Japan _wish_ they spoke English, but there's almost a national complex about it because they don't, though they know for globalization's sake they should.

&gt;Never searched for exploits and never will. I don't like cheating. YouTube needs to fix this issue.

If you never searched for and never watched any of those videos.. how do you know they exist?
---
You do realize that you don't have to search them for the algorithm to figure out what you are watching? 
---
If you click on a video or a few YouTube will start suggesting videos of the same topic.

Watch a lot of exploit videos and suddenly all you see in suggestions is videos named or tagged with words regarding exploits.

I love the way they say in in monotone "Possible fertiliser source found," as they start **hacking away at you with their buzzsaw**

I just wanna say I'm British and the game has made me fall in love with wv. Its made me do research on the area. I love the nature and stuff. Hope I can visit one day. I really wanna go to the whitespring irl. Ever been there?

Couldn't tell you. I did the water on second so the first was already unlocked. But that would make sense.

Fasnacht would often near crash my game during the first few days when it was most popular, if I joined the event at about the same time as when they cross the small bridge I wouldn't see any enemies or players until it had practically ended.
---
I'd love more players in the server but  I just don't see it being feasible. Maybe if they do a port to next-gen systems though.
---
This, that‚Äôs why I avoid Whitesprings like the plague, I mean, what‚Äôs the point?
---
Rip): I went and favourited all my non scrap/sell pieces I want to keep. Now my bar quick select wheel is full and not useful but hopefully that'll stop accidental loss :/
---
There are still some organized hunts but you have to search for groups doing it.  They really need to make the queen drop a guaranteed 3\* among other things.
---
It sounds lime your missing a lot of lead from lucky hole, or havent put super duoer level 3 on when smelting it as i usually come away from there with 1300-1700 lead a time
---
You were probably grouped with someone sharing the radio sponge perk before.
---
&gt;who aren‚Äôt that strong
---
Or like me, don‚Äôt appreciate the lame one-shot meta.
---
Cheers man,  i am nearly level 200 and i haven't stopped playing since beta. Somehow i dont get tired of, walking around, collecting junk, trading, and fighting. I know people have or had bad experience with, bugs, disconnects, dupers, griefers, and so on, but i never gave up on playing.
---
I took some camara pictures of it thinking the same thing but nothing haopened, nothibg showed up as being the focus of the camara and it didnt jolt away like you said, i have tried a few things recently to try to get it to do stuff, explosives, syringer, wearing ritual bindings and mask...
---
Yup it‚Äôs because of the vending I‚Äôve got my unused legendaries up for sale , I scrapped all my unwanted weapons and armor for script , halved my junk/crafting inventory and put on armor with weight reduction perks to carry more and I‚Äôm  still 2-3 pounds from max. Oh I forgot I have the max carry capacity back pack at +120 and I‚Äôm still almost over encumbered.
---
Something like the camping in Red Dead Redemption 2 would be great. It wouldn't be too difficult for Bethesda if modders were able to accomplish it in FO4.
---
Add a disarm option to punji boards and remove it from my bone chimes. I hate players that disarm it, just to get some free bones.
---
If I had one I would ! I just have my AAE lever , AAE ultracite laser and those are ...well you know priceless so not going anywhere lol.
---
I have built up a stash of marginally decent weapons and armor along with associated cheap crap weapons and armor from farming WS during and after nukes.
---
Usually it's range issue.
---
is that a bug? I have only teamed with 3 people since the game started and never in a nuke zone?
---
Is it just me or, yes he couldn't reach with their arms, which is where the chalk line is, but rather he could reach with his outstretched leg.
---
They already do have high level servers to a certain extent, if i select to go to a server on my main character, most people are level 100+ if i make a new character, most players are sub level 50
---
I don‚Äôt -really , I scrapped all the clutter weapons for script and haven‚Äôt purchased any new stuff because of player vending so yeah definitely not hoarding.
---
Thats actually really cool, nothing more iconic as the first steps.
---
Thats normal. All PA allows rads.
---
I sell those for 200 caps.
---
I run excavator all the time and yes in a nuke zone you need roadway about every 15 min or so it seems. 
---
 Bloodied build is heck to run in a nuke zone with excavator and the rad from the zone plus all the ghouls.
---
Gonna be honest here... this base looks sick af, its simple but its sweet. keep up the good work bro
---
So far the purveyor has given me multiple shit sandwiches. I rage with envy at your luck, sir (or madam, wouldn‚Äôt want to presume).
---
Take my upvote man
---
Yep. I recently bought an 3* IE 10mm excavator power armor according to my pip boy.
---
It's almost like you went back to 2010 and experienced a Black Ops 1 lobby
---
i need help with this as well, please. been trying to team up with someone for three days now!
---
platform: pc
---
haha was about to replace my camp but im sick of rebuilding it. so it still an issue?? i mean there known to deliver broken stuff and never fix it.
---
great post. i feel exactly the same way
---
(platform: pc)
---
As long as someone‚Äôs request for help doesn‚Äôt cut off my country roads, I‚Äôm more than happy with that idea
---
You know what? Thank you. Thank you so much. I knew that at least one person out there had the taste, class and intelligence to see the wisdom in my words.
---
No, all armor allows some radiation. If you are grouped and share the ghoulish and rad sponge perks you can you can pretty much mitigate all of the radiation though without worrying about rad x or rad away
---
Me too, are there plans?
---
Nocturnal
---
There used to be a bug that prevented radiation damage, it‚Äôs been fixed for a while though. It‚Äôs not possible (legitimately anyway) to not take radiation in a nuke zone.
---
I was thinking exactly this recently! Apart maybe one or two notable examples I feel the Noname NPCs in 4 like the raiders and Diamond City Guards were the best written, and I miss the immersive reactions the raiders in particular would have when you start picking them off.
---
Imagine how fucking cool Top of the World would look if it was populated by Cutthroats! Various vendors selling weapons and armor, others selling slaves, fights in the arena, one of them tucked away in a corner with a mild dilemma that only *you* can sort out. If Bethesda's town designs are at least the same quality in 5 I think we have a lot to look forward to, but I'm still hoping Wastelanders‚Ñ¢ can repopulate these areas so they can truly shine.
---
I hear you on the immersion option of everyone save themselves type play, but by allowing a 200+lvl player full chameleon with a twoshot explosive whatever doing 1800dmg kill lower level players with a 120 dmg shotgun at best for a few screws and a plastic it is not motivating nor fairplay.
---
Everytime my 10yo son plays he gets killed 2-4 times by those guys and he doesn‚Äôt curse, no mic available, but he feels its not fair and he reports players and I get the email from bethesda.
---
Thats why duel upon agreement or full on pvp only in survival mode should be where its at.
---
Adventure should promote team building mostly or lone adventurer. Just like other games have regular, hardcore, ricochet hardcore etc.
---
How silly it is to be able to run pacifist mode but still get murdered by op players??
---
It is what it is I guess.
---
I think you can only find them, not sure about plans tbh.
---
Its a nice place , tbh i dont even remember it lol üòÅ
---
So much no to this. If you want to be able to run a lot build a high agi and endurance toon, don't just ask for easymode.
---
Yes. I despise her. I was sooo disappointed that I could not punch her to death.
---
Huge props to the VA - and I mean that unironically. The VA did a great job with that charactet.
---
Similar experience here. I was using the Whitesprings station vendor to sell stuff and somebody shot me. I'd only been there about 10 seconds! Apparently they had more of a right to be there.
---
I finished up, turned around and saw he had sat in a chair behind me. So I shot him back.
---
Wait people don't wear bandanas in nuke zones?
---
I‚Äôm not even a new player and I‚Äôve yet to complete the event. Every time it‚Äôs on there are only like three people that go.
---
It's when your server hopping at Charlston for the vendor bot and you gotta hear Melody Larkin telling you to loot the church a million times... Or at soon as you take a single step into the Morgantown - **"HIIIIIIIII!! iT's sAnJaY hErE!!"**
---
well, they are rare af so I put it up there
---
I'm not here consistently so I never found this series until today.  I love them!  Keep up the awesome work.
---
I‚Äôve never been able to complete it due to server instability and I‚Äôm level 140+ on 2 characters. I can‚Äôt really sympathize
---
Hopefully the wastelanders dlc adds npcs
---
Late reply. So, even post patch, if you've cleared the Free States main quest, the linings are not available?
---
None. None are ok.
---
My dude, I can't use a sight on my handmade or half the time my gun glitches over my crosshair making it impossible to see what your shooting. Ahhh especially the scopes... It's been 6 months.
---
What on Earth makes you think they should, or even could, up the server population?
---
Very cool.  I love the nod to the WPA national-parks-style you used!  Can't wait to see the rest!
---
You can't, it's currently bugged and unobtainable. I don't even want to know how much time and how many resources I wasted before finding that out. =/
---
Yep, player vending would have been much more interesting 6 months ago when everyone was a noob. 
---
Playing a new character feels weird because you have level 200's running around and clearing areas for you, plus cheap items.
---
Same situation in one of the Big houses at barkeley springs, Hope they patch It, its a nightmere for newbies around appalachia
---
Juice Head is already making the video
---
We need to buy legendary mods directly, even 1000 scrip if needed, to restart the craft and customize weapon/armor.
---
Since level 50 I didnt craft a single weapon or  armor ü§î
---
(Excuse my unperfect english)
---
I guess hungry doesn't cure stupid.
---
Like the monkey who can't get his closed fist full of cookies out of the jar, but wont let go of the cookies to successfully take only a few at a time.
---
Apparently "tongue but hole" and "amazing chest ahead" are very offensive and oppressive to women....
---
As you can imagine, the dark souls fanbase tore that one to shreds. 
---
Yeah, the memes are a bit old now, but are still a rather silly staple of the community. You would have to be a VERY insecure person to find such things offensive.
---
Still, it is just Kudoku trying to spread some controversy for the cheap clicks. A shame, they used to be decent. Now I just auto ignore all of their shit.
---
Seems not. I've redone the quest a couple of times, even learning all the possible armor plans before it, but you still just get the same reward. Unless they fix it as a daily/event reward or world drop it's unobtainable :/
---
I was building halfwalls today and they were working only when a roof was already overhead; yes it's a broken mess and yes it needs to be fixed.
---
You think pretty high of yourself for someone on the same internet and same sub. Like a commentator.
---
I've got two, one with the "OMFG the whole screen is white if I get close to anything" and one with the regular bulb. One for outdoors, one for indoors.
---
Has this been reported as a bug? I assume so?
---
It's even more fun when you have that naming problem + a bad translation on top of it.
---
One is to many......
---
Well that explains alot thanks, hopefully bethesda fixes it soon.
---
Yeah fuck that, OP. That's an awful idea
---
I set up a vendor mule near to Whitesprings train station, I've lost track of the number of times I've loaded in and died of radiation.
---
Nice idea.  Have fun
---
Can't stand people like that. The tea-bagging usually follows them killing you.
---
It's these little details that make a convincing post-apocalyptic world.  Society will not slowly fade from civilization; in dire need with little fear of consequence, most will do *whatever* is needed to care for their family or themselves.   üò¨
---
Bethesda's designers captured it.
---
Agreed on all fronts. Thanks for reading!
---
Now were Bargaining with the Purveyor??? I guess all we have left is Acceptance that XBOX legendaries dont exist and are all on PS4... why doesnt anyone wanna talk about that?
---
Yeah i guessed ad much, same as wood armor?
---
Yeah sure, what's your IGN, I'm logging in soon
---
Thanks! Also on PC. My favorite way to play.
---
I make a loop through Whitesprings now and then to keep the Radaway inventory well-prepared, but it's common most everywhere.  Rad-X shuts off any mutations you might be running, so keep that in mind too.
---
I have 400+ hours and this is my only bad experience with a player like this
---
Post it on Reddit... Oh wait nvm
---
Heh I think I was most excited to use my scrip and got three grenade launchers in a row. Not what I expected but it's a thing.
---
yes and before I started I transfered myself some stims, caps, and starting gear etc. high level players would run off up and drop off more supplies for me. sometimes I was able to explain I really didn't need it but usually they just gave me a thumbs up and ran off lol.
---
If you're going to min-max to that extreme, then the reality is you would actually need 24 points. 9 for one handed, 9 for two handed, plus six for Incisor and MA. Then there's Blocker, another option. Truthfully, I've been using Incisor and MA because they benefit both melee classes, and skipping the Slugger/Gladiator. I have plenty of punch in 90% of encounters. The only time I felt like I would have been better off stacking those as well was for a level 100 sheepsquatch yesterday.
---
I'm basically looking to add a bit of variety in the way of ranged options, that don't require me to change my SPECIAL allocation too much. Explosives seems like a better fit, and as the points become available I can always take the perk cards for times when I might want to min-max the melee option.
---
What's the AA and SS?
---
I'm using PA so the gauntlet isn't a weapon I can use most of the time.
---
Anti-Armor and Swing Speed. It can be found on any melee weapon.
---
What... You mean Biv didn't fill that little void in your heart?
---
lol, you stole my response!  :)
---
But he's been to the Cloud District!
---
I have a feeling the Wastelanders DLC is gonna bring back alive human npcs
---
Would be nice
---
That is always the best when she Swan dives right behind that picket fense you cant venture beyond. Its like, you even KILLED HER but you still dont get shit for it.
---
I guess mutants are often your guests :)
---
AAE
---
If you die in the event, you spawn back inside in the event.
---
Good for you, Chief.
---
Yes, at least once. Holidays coming, more play time= stash issues will come faster.
---
Camp decoration coming, more and more atom shop stuff= best time for a budget increase
---
I suggest looking for friendly like minded group chats to join like discord or such. Very easy to do the SBQ once you have an organized team.
---
Another big tip when going at the launch solo and hoping on a good server ppl will join in on the fun..... DO NOT Launch your nuke dead centre on the prime fissure.   Aim lower with the nuke circle edge just covering the prime spot.
---
This way the SBQ will be active and everyone can fight north of the nuke zone without the worry of taking rads. This will bring in the bloodied melee fighters that don‚Äôt use PA (like me ü§£)
---
I got a hunters plasma cannon with 10% damage while aiming, and I can put a prime receiver on it.
---
I haven't done it yet because I need some more flux, but I'm hoping it'll do good damage agaisnt scorchbeasts, as long as they're still classified as animals.
---
The stash size is fine for me. I just have to make the heavy armor ultra light so it fits. 
---
The camp budget needs to be a bit bigger. That or things that don't do anything for combat such as letters and lights shouldn't cost as much.
---
Really, when did they patch that?
---
"cringiest edgy 14 yo voice" and "Xbox chat" story checks out.
---
Very big discussion...I took part in many, but im now exhausted.
---
Beth said they are not supported, but if a ban happens, while using a mod that doesnt give ingame advantages, it can be reverted.
---
Grey line all the way and use it at own risk. Mods that dont play with game files are still on grey line, but safer.
---
well you could be hacking
---
 berry mentates have a fixed range . if you killed him over 20 range you ware probably using the esp hack
---
10 % extra camp budget would be amazing, and if they could increase the stash to 1000 I‚Äôd be a very happy wastelander.
---
You will have to craft and scrap lever action gun's until you get it, never seen any plans for sale... :)
---
Love it!
---
Im sorry xbox has WHAT? there's some kind of media stream on there? Can you post a screenshot?
---
Yep, as it's been an issue since launch.
---
You got me
---
*hands in tadpole uniform*
---
Check some commeents on the other dudes submitted posts. He literally copies peoples posts and posts them again under his own account. He's managed to whore himself 34k karma in a month doing that. Amazing the lengths some people will go to for something that means nothing.
---
I have pretty much played one character. I played alternates from time to time but they would suck and I would go back to my main. he is level 248 , continually bumping the cap stash limit and there is absoloutly nothing on the market I can buy but maybe a three star vam gat laser. I've gotten several alts past level 50. and gotten stuck in decision loops of what to do for the day and I end up deleting my alts so I can focus on my main. I started a sneaky sneak pistol packer yesterday but I think I am already ready to delete him. I just find the stealthing and armor selection and ammo making etc tedious and annoying. it IS satisfying to stealth shoot things but the rest of the character annoys me and he is soon for the grave I think. for the record I have had 3 pistol attempts so far and gotten annoyed enough to delete the first two already. SO today when I get home at work I am probably going to sit in front of the character screen for a minute. then go with my gut and just delete my alt and go get a few k worth of caps to be back at cap stash limit. 
---
   I already know what I will do. first I will go hit vendor payout limit for the day since I have a few thousand room for caps. Then I will go take a power plant and while its making more ammo for me I go look for that one peice of level 15 power armor and the rest of the t45 peices so I can have some training sets of Power armor to loan to people. maybe then I will post on the market reddit but most likely I will be tired and ready for bed by then. 
---
   to be honest sometimes I just log in and go be bored in my cool little garage house and watch the map and or people. not even sure why I like it so much but it is what it is.
---
The other day I saw that there was a level 10 and a level 12 that had claimed a workshop. There was a "defend the workshop" event so I ran over, killed the bad guys and rounded up the dropped loot. I tracked the two people, who were very obviously a father and son due to their names, waved at them and then dropped the loot on the ground.
---
Next thing I know, they both started shooting at me. I killed them both but left the loot there and then went about my business. Next thing I know, they've shown up where I was doing my thing and started shooting at me again. I killed them both again.
---
I kind of felt bad because I think they probably didn't know that I was just trying to help them out.
---
This isn't right. The challenge is to collect wood 7600 times, not collect 7600 wood. Likely closer to 40,000 wood.
---
Ahhh, so that's why ive been seeing that.
---
I have found this to be accurate, as well.
---
What timezone you in? Im on european time. I'm level 117, but doing the tadpole quests myself. GT is same as on here, add me, and we can see if we meet up. üòâ
---
I wouldn't even give this weapon a semi-auto receiver, instead, I'd make it full-auto (with receivers basically play with damage and armor piercing), low recoil, ~6-ish standard weight (after mods) in order to compete with the lightweight 10mm sub, giving this kind of sidegrade balancing between the two:
---
* 10mm sub ‚Üí light weight, okay damage, heavy and hard to make ammo
---
* 5mm carbine ‚Üí medium weight, good damage, light and easy to make ammo
---
In addition, the gun would still be competitive with the other 5mm weapons in given comparison:
---
* 5mm carbine ‚Üí AP perks (Tank Killer) allows legendary armor synergy, light weight without perks, good damage, lower individual perk effect numbers with good synergy (Tormentor, Tank Killer), has range-extension perks (Long Shot), quick reload perks (Ground Pounder) is in Perception tree
---
* 5mm minigun ‚Üí AP perks forces PA (which means bye-bye legendary armor), very light weight *with perks*, poor damage, higher individual perk effect numbers with good perk synergy (Stabilized, One Gun Army), has protection perks (Bullet Shield), quick reload perks (Lock and Load) is in Strength tree
---
* 5mm gatling ‚Üí same as minigun, but with awesome damage and higher individual effect numbers with low perk synergy (because abysmal fire rate)
---
Plus, I like the carbine's design in FNV, and its Furious variant would be awesome to be put in the game.
---
Nice, I like that style, looking forward to the next one!
---
The close encounter with the queen still gives rads tho... have radshield  handy if going melee.
---
That and med-x with a set of sentinel armour you can stand toe to toe with the queen.
---
I must say that i've never seen those posters before as i'm from Europe. Just looked them up and i see what you mean! Unintentional nod it is then :).
---
What I noticed is that my mutant chars have rad issues in nuke zones, while using excavator and diluted rad x.
---
Its barely enough and you spend a shitload of em. Normal rad x supressed mutations and rad shield is hard to get
---
Wish the stash was based on slots, not weight. Would be a lot better that way.
---
Server stability isnt the only thing for this, i decided to leave the game and wait a while for them to fix the worst problems, just started playing again about a week ago, the problem now is massive lag, 2-10 secs at a time, something i never experienced at launch and the problem with there mostly being much, MUCH higher players, i move into an area and everything is 60+ to my 21, takes about 4 or 5 server hops at times to find a less populated server, with a higher server player cap that would be much worse for the lower level characters
---
Remind me not to make this for fallout 3 then ;-). Thanks btw!
---
Thanks!
---
AAE is probably better for full penetration but depends on what your killing
---
They should try to give smaller amounts. Usually I leave a few beers and .38 bullets at the exit of the vault when I see a level 1 in it on the map.
---
Yup, mines still always set to the lowest volume.
---
That's probably light metal chest armor, not robot armor. I'm not sure if there IS a light armor option for robot armor.
---
well your from eu so i just assume your hacking (from eu to ) since half of our population hacks in survival
---
Never. It's been like that since the event first started.
---
Next up is the ash heap. So incoming Robo-squatch, mole miners, gas masks and the big bad mining plant thingy (forgot the name at the moment).
---
Well i need to have a half wall on the floor and two triangular half walls on top of it. They make a full wall like that.
---
I tried in a workshop too and i could do this only if i had a full wall under the triangular ones. 
---
The roof was also there. Its shows the pieces as placeable,green,but then it says they're intefering with something else.
---
You can find Gatling gun Mods but they are very rare, saying that I've just seen this (PS4) player selling two mods and for a good price too!

About 12 hours from now, you're top priority I'll message you here and on Xbox when I'm on
---
CAMP plans are red. Weapon/armour plans are green.
---
It's impossible to think "Oh, I thought it was a gun." Since the Long Pew is a red plan.
---
I‚Äôve yet to come across some real world addictol to cure mine. Been playing almost everyday since beta. Thank you Bethesda, you ruined my life! I mean that in the best way possible. I think..
---
A possible alternative *might* be to but the new dungeon crawls on shared servers, while keeping a holding spot for each player with their camps on the original servers. 
---
It sounds a little complicated, but it would have the benefit of reducing the strain on all the main servers while also allowing more people to join the pharmacy dungeon.
---
I did but I seriously think that no matter the game reposting just never works...most of the time
---
Rose gives you power armor, doesn‚Äôt she?
---
Was wondering how to do railings on my open plan, that's a great idea!
---
Found one last night at wavy willards
---
Lol. No. I know the spots. I was just trying to save time. But just after I wrote that I found Ansel. :) Thank you. Never mind everybody!
---
&gt; The only argument to not do it is some players will fear monger about inflation but the economy will do what it does. If the prices go up then that drop you sell is worth more and it balances.
---
No, the drop is "worth" the same; the value of each individual cap goes down as the number of total caps in the economy increases.  Without several other major changes (all of which would make caps rarer) you're causing massive inflation.
---
No , make stash size unlimited completely or at least give us the ability to add extra storage units at our camp
---
Beautiful! Be proud :)
---
Think of all the irrational people who want to see a thing they don't like fail. Now imagine one of those people had access to a "news" site. That really is all there is to it. They have no real investment but want to see it burn because they have some narcissistic need to see something they don't like not exist.
---
Get better internet.
---
Does CAMP size increase with level? I thought it had been said once before, higher level, more camp space.
---
I've gotten the heavy chest piece plan from rose's first quest twice and strudy leg plans from I believe one violent night .. also got the shielded underarmor from uranium fever .. 
---
for actual pieces I've gotten em all over and they don't seem specific to an area which is shit .. but the 2 places I do pick up alot are lucky hole mine and the mining HQ place down south where you make excavator armor as those 2 places I farm frequently
---
I'd recommend trying the north east of top of the world the 2 theme parks and obviously one violent night/uranium fever though to try and get some pieces
---
Fair enough.
---
Though even if they fix it, knowing and requiring that you need to get the other linings before completing it is just a little rude, and puts it permanently out of reach for most of the player base.
---
What a god among men....
---
&gt;TL;DR miss human npc's, bring back the raiders.
---
another casual asking for stuff that its not even on bethesdas menue. you want raiders? go to the survival mode . theres plenty of raiders there
---
Yeah looks pretty good - check out riflegamings YouTube vid
---
It takes a lot of time and resources to keep running silos to launch a nuke and kill a SBQ. The reason to nuke other than the quest is to get access to her drop table which has a lot of items and plans exclusive to her. The issue is that they decided to "fix" the drop table, which really just ended up removing a lot of good items like serum recipes and flooded it with other non-exclusive items. I have yet to get anything new in the past 20 SBQ fights which is really frustrating since there are so many things I still want from her. The whole endevour basically boils down to do I want to waste ammo and an hour+ to roll a really bad slot machine to have a chance at a potential new plan?
---
Also if you want a nuke, launch it yourself.
---
Who knew such a ugly thing could be...nope still ugly 
---
I‚Äôll continue on my way
---
What's wastelanders then.... What's your best guess for that dlc?
---
It's almost as if the people of Vault 76 are starting to make an impact, making the wasteland more habitable.
---
Sorry,my English is poor. It‚Äôs Google Translate.
---
I just want to know which one is better in PVE.
---
Cool, I‚Äòll send you an request!
---
Nah your English is fine,  yeah AAE is probably better than FE
---
Yes, actually glad you say that. I'm sorry I sounded rather negative but indeed let me too emphasise how awesome this community is overall. 
---
I've had maybe 3 or 4 negative encounters in the past and I play from release. So yeah in general the sweetest community I've come across in a long long time.
---
Love you all!
---
https://youtu.be/ew3DOwinbw0
---
This has happened to me also. It can happen with any legendary enemy. I was playing with my friend. He got my loot but i didn't get mine.
---
If you‚Äôre on XB1, I can craft it for you. Otherwise, get to scrapping.
---
Okey,thx
---
I would go with PS4 due to the larger player base/community, less bugs/issues and no hackers.
---
Makes perfect sense. We had enemies in PA in Fallout 4 so it wouldn't be anything new.
---
I've heard this too but have not actually read anything official.
---
That‚Äôs awesome, gonna use it as a phone wallpaper. Since you‚Äôre taking suggestions, I‚Äôd love to see the ash heap.
---
Usually happens when one or more people are sitting on the fence while fighting her. The person on the fence manages to get aggro, AI can't find a path to target, so AI runs away. Just like all enemies in the game.
---
After I got my buddies to stay of the fence I have not had this "bug" once. It is just standard AI behaviour.
---
Vampires .50 mg is great fun if you want to pretend you‚Äôre a tank. It‚Äôs not as effective as the other variants but the survivability is brilliant.
---
Found him, thanks! Leaving server so others can join.
---

&gt;What's your best guess for that dlc?
---
the actual vaults. bethesda is not gona add human npcs. it defeats the purpose of the game and how the game was desinged around. (no humans apart from us)
---
It has improved quite a lot since launch, but don't expect a bug-free experience.
---
We can't possibly know if you will like it or not.
---
I dont know if they already fixed the invisible bug but my team mates cannot see me or damage me even if i am standing right in front of them, i even tried getting a bounty and got one to see if another player who isnt on the team can either see me or damage me but neither worked. I though i do get damage from mobs but not players. 
---
So i thought hey maybe its because im wearing a full set of assassins/sentinels? I took all my armors off, had a player not on team take shots at me and hoping to get rid of the bounty but nope, i seem to have glitched into being invisible/invulnerable to players but a mole rat can take me out. 
---
Managed to recreate this twice already so i hope Bethesda gets their act together on it or else survival   mode would suck if any one else figures it out.
---
Okey, I‚Äôll try. thx
---
Get gud? How do I get gud at wanting human npc's Mr troll.
---
The worst part? He doesn't even die when I unload my Dragon in his stupid face.
---
There are at least two light sources that don't require power for some quick, carefree lighting. If you scroll down to the "assorted lights" picture in [this imgur album](https://imgur.com/a/3ZhkLJl) they are the lamp post on the far left and the barrel on the far right.
---
It's a lot better than it was at launch, but still not perfect. Did you play Fallout 4 and did you enjoy its gameplay? If so, you'll probably like 76. If you're getting it for free, you might as well at least try it out.
---
Ye those whiney lil Cod/fortinite kids can be a real riled bunch. Most times I just pretend they don't exist and go about my day as if they don't exist. Feel like denying them aknowledgment just hurts them more. If it gets real bad,  or I just feel like messing with them more, I try to trick them into dangerous situations.
---
Time to declare war and take on nz to australia!
---
Cheers! Here's to 50 more!!
---
What are the other two effects?
---
I do the power up event
---
&gt;fruit flavoured candy
---
mentats are drugs
---
I‚Äôm in the Eastern Stone zone. Right now it‚Äôs 8:33am. My gamer tag is the same as my reddit name too. I will try to hop on some time today. We will see. Thanks.
---
This looks to be correct. The damage boost the target recieves in both the PvE and PvP tests are too large for 25% armor pen.
---
&gt;I don't like pvp on this game right now.
---
&gt;wants raiders
---
&gt;players are raiders and rp as raiders and doing more raider stuff that bethesda couldnt program for the raider AI for previus games
---
&gt;calls other people troll because he got called out for not having the balls to go to pvp to kill raiders
---
such is the life of a casual.
---
btw wanting human npcs is just air. bethesda is not gona add human npcs. stop cloging reddit with ussles shitty posts . k thx by
---
On PC now. I can put one on yours. IGN raskol.
---
If you're on PS4, you should check out Floopwoods. Best-stocked camp-town on the platform. Have a lot of good weapons for 1-2k caps. 30 max level 3 star weapons and the same for armors
---
Someone did this to me... I just fast traveled lol
---
It's not dead. It's broken.
---
It would be nice, if they dont want to add npcs because they want the players to be from the vaults they should increase the pop. However they need to make the servers more stable, fix alot of stuff.
---
Are you seeking permission? Because no one here can grant you that.
---
This is going to have to be you all the way, both to give yourself permission to use them and to face the consequences if there are any.
---
Moreover given that many here play on console and cannot get any mods whatsoever and if you glance at the stables you will see that they are full to the brim with the highest and most virtuous horses ever ridden by righteous men I am not sure what kind of response you are expecting.
---
It can be fun. But it depends on a lot of factors. The gameplay is based in get loot and exploring, plus fallout lore in form of text and audio. The leveling is fun and the world is immersive.
---
The game have bugs and you need a stable connection, but the community is cool.
---
The reason people want to see Anthem and FO76 fail, is so Games as a Service - and all the shit tier business models like Atom Shops - die, and we can finally get quality single player, buy it and done, games again.
---
Because people are sick of perpetual Early Access, online crap like this game.
---
Emote wheel, stimpack, quick-equip wheel and a go to last weapon used function. Those at the four functions
---
Hands up who is sick of these posts?
---
I get that it's sucks and if people are waiting outside of vault 76 and shooting people as they spawn then that's super shitty of them (is it even possible as pvp opens at lv 5).
---
But that's not what happened, you were in the map proper, at a decent enough level to know what you were doing and the risks associated with that. When I did the challenge I got murdered due to the ridiculous mechanic where turrets are invulnerable unless they are targeting you. I had to respawn and run back. I choose a station further away so I wouldn't get spawn killed.
---
Some responsibility for how events play out and forethought into your actions and you wouldn't have such a bad taste in your mouth.
---
Players aren't raiders, everyone role plays differently. Pvp is nothing to do with people being raiders, you're just fabricating your own reality to try and win an argument that you don't even understand. Something you must do a lot based on your negative karma, go and find a forum more suited to your intellectual level, Spyro the dragon or something like that.
---
My issue isn't launching a nuke, and I've done SBQ many times, it's just disheartening to show up and there's only two other players there and it becomes obvious we're not going to be able to do it ourselves.
---
I also find it beyond pathetic when in a game that's filed with monsters to go let ur angry out on AND a designated Pvp server someone would feel the need to grief. Like how incomplete and dissatisfying does thier life have to be to get to that point?
---
Price everything at 76.  You‚Äôll get 69 back. Nice.
---
1. Chameleon armor is normal and essential for pvp
---
2. when you get them to 0 and they regen it's a visual bug for you. In reality you actually didn't do any damage
---
What do you mean? You don't want to be able to set spawn points on your camp?
---
I genuinely enjoy Sanjay, he sounds so damn happy.
---
Oh and as for casual....im 479 hours in, which isn't easy when I work nearly every day. When you assume..... You make an ass out of u and me.
---
This is brilliant. It would make the game so much more interesting. I hope you make a separate post about this so it can be upvoted and seen by Bethesda.
---
??
---
Unplanned then luck is part of it. Lucky that enough of the people could do meaningful damage to offset the queens scaling damage resistance. For every person the queen gets just a little bit stronger.
---
I've gone to random runs where the opposite happens so many low level or under powered players show and we can't do enough damage fast enough.
---
Sorry I shouldn‚Äôt of posted that comment, it‚Äôs just that I see this post every day. Sorry again

---
I am lvl 180ish. You are correct, the rewards and loot are not worth going to that event anymore.
---
 Spending all that time and ammo just to receive a 1* wooden leg or plan that I already have just isn't worth it.
---
XP on adds is great but I don't care about such nonsense anymore either.
---
 A guaranteed 3* drop from the queen might get me to go there again but I doubt it. It's still a ton of ammo and not much reward.  Taking the serum plans off the loot table had a dramatic impact as well on the amount of people that show up.
---
 I need incentive to do these things. I don't want to do them just to do them anymore.
---
Is this the one where you have to kill 20 people? If so I‚Äôd be up for helping out if you can return the favour!
---
Shhhhhhh.
---
Do you want to start a fire?  
---
Because that's how Bethesda starts a fire.
---
You might want to explain what it is. I've never even looked at the trophy list to know what's required to help.
---
I'm Fireproof!
---
Oh my God, I've never played the game. Can you please tell me how "tongue but hole" can be used in an actual sentence?
---
I bet it can't possible be as funny as the things I'm filling in myself.
---
When the event audio comes in through wouldn't it be nice, nah that actually mugs me offüòÇ
---
Other than explosives, what other weapon skills would go with melee as a hybrid? I thought about pistols, since those don't require strength perks.
---
And the death claw shit
---
God Howard has given you a blessing
---
This is anecdotal however when I play my 140+ character the majority of players I see are also 100+
---
When I play my new level 39 character majority I see are under level 100 and half of those are around 50 or less.
---
While the game does not have a set range of you can only end up on servers within certain level ranges it does seem to try if possible group based on level.
---
Dilute *everything*!
---
IIRC you have to play the game and get out of Vault 76 before you get the option. If it is your first time ever playing the game it loads into adventure mode by default.
---
That's really their opinion. I have absolutely nothing against atom shops. Tho I still think best games to do a service are League of Legends, Warframe and Path Of Exile. Which are highly competitive, but free to play. Fallout 76 is neither. I remember when it released people were really trashing it because it had no PvP, a lot of them bought it for this same reason. They thought it was some H1Z1 and they got mad.
---
I would rather have a 100lb account wide mailbox than a stash increase...
---
how dare you have fun int his terrible game
---
There‚Äôs data in the game files for Alien enemies ranking all the way up until Star Admiral for the toughest one so maybe yeah. I wouldn‚Äôt mind a limited time event where players can team up to teleport to a mothership or something like that and take it down from within like the Fallout 3 dlc
---
Maybe the quests could be audio logs left behind from people abducted or people who hid safely
---
That was either a bug or he didn‚Äôt move at all. In my experience, if they are crouched with Chameleon, Berry won‚Äôt highlight them until they become visible again.

Also, you only have to make the lowest level of the gun and scrap for mods.

The real victory is the 20 screws tbh

I hate disarm on those chimes I'd rather them as a decorative item.
---
no worries.
---
&gt;Do you have anymore pvp tips or tricks OP? 
---
this sub is casual they dont pvp . they only get the odd encounter .
---
That's literally how 98% of the news world is. Someone makes an opinion piece and it's treated like dishonest reporting. Doesn't matter the company or affiliation.
---
People just like to be mad.
---
or he could take off the jacket, and use it to throw over the food and pull it back.
---
It really isn't worth the time. It's quicker and much more effective to get materials and craft ammo. Make sure you use Ammosmith and Super Duper to make much more.
---
best thing i have read in a long time and thank you I hate punk aholes
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
What night? It's always bright as shit in this game.
---
Ya, that's always an option, it's more so just to be a dink than actually trap. Sit outside the door switching between the &lt;3 and puke emotes until they dissapear, then sneak and fast travel urself.
---
Yeah same
---
Archery and Athletics were two of my first three. I can never seem to remember what the third was, but those two are pretty easy.
---
Isn't all of the Trapper armor Raider armor?
---
Always wondered what‚Äôs in their mouth
---
It‚Äôs part of the nuke cool down. I think the server animates eyebots or liberators as it transitions back after someone nukes Whitesprings. The ‚Äúeveryone has a legendary‚Äù thing is a side effect I‚Äôve experienced as well.
---
But yeah it‚Äôs needed
---
I run rifles with 2hand melee for backup...
---
I dont like swinging the wardrum only because it looks bad on screen.. prefer a super sledge...
---
p.s. i'm pretty new to reddit, but it's cool to hear others ask for this too. but on the other hand, still not have it in game shows how big chances are we get it some time...so after all, your comment still was a bit informative to me, thx\^\^
---
I got the joke but others may not. If you are joking, you might want to throw a /s up there.
---
Makes sense the area is covered with nukes flora but it's been like that since yesterday with no nukes going off
---
Thanks.  I was able to get the radiators to work when I use them underneath the floor vs on top like I was using them before. They work for items on the floor but not on the wall. I also am learning that if you lay down the conduits before laying down the floor it's much easier to hide and build throughout your base v s trying to do it last.  
---
I also realized you can hide then pipes by placing walls on top of them.
---
Scrips for days. Nice
---
Lol, great tactics on his part
---
Thank you. They are only for console I assume?
---
How miserable it must be to come into a games subreddit just to be mad that it exists. I am tired for you. Also, while I might agree that the state of industry on releasing unfinished games is frustrating I don't hold my opinion so highly above others that I want the thing they enjoy to die so I can get my way. I am also not so delusional that I think that would work.
---
You ARE getting games like that too, CDprojektred with Cyberpunk and Obsidian with The Outer World. Even Bethesda with ES6 and Starfield. There are plenty of single player games being made and a lot of them, Breath of the Wild, Spiderman, God of War, etc are winning awards. You can't convince me the sky is falling because online games exist when single player games are out here getting tons of accolades. Go back to r/gaming where they might actually believe the sky is falling when a game not catered to them comes out.
---
I hope they don‚Äôt as well. But that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt complain about pubg or fortnite. The siphon off a lot of the dross.
---
An the Yaoguai poop
---
Ya I super didn't eat him either, swearsies.
---
Also the event where the mine is collapsing, you can find silver veins there.
---
I've dropped hundreds of nukes on my level 255 main, heavy guns build. You can do it in about 20 minutes, no problem. That said, I dropped my slt's first nuke at level 51. Stealth build. Cruised the silo super easy. I highly recommend it - stay crouched, use something like a basic 1 star ranged weapon, take out bots and turrets before they even think of getting aggro.
---
Your Totalitarian dreams will not reach fruition until you find a Liberator that gives the Plans for the Bladed Commie Whacker.
---
Happy Hunting you Commie Bitch
---
I've only played one game, but messages can be left for other players who visit the same spot in the game. It's usually just "tongue but hole" with nothing else in the message.
---
If you are in the suit when you log into a server, it glitches to +200 instead of +100.  If you exit then re-enter, or die, it goes back to normal.
---
&gt; Does this actually cause a loss of ammo? I had assumed it was just added back to your pool.
---
I'm not sure that it adds it back. I have the same bug where I have to reload what ever gun is equipped when I logged out. It does start out with 000/whateveramountofammoIhave so it very well may not add it in.
---
That type of kid is the reason we don't have world chat :(
---
And I did it in 20, so what?
---
Lol, read this thinking it was gunna be an actual bitching at Bethesda post. Happily suprised to see you just hate that robots shifty and demeaning personality. Good laugh for my wake up.
---
Ooo I know the one you mean, load bearing in the ash heap, il keep that in mind for future cause usually I‚Äôm just running around there as fast as possible grabbing the iron deposits, never noticed the silver before lol
---
One time I was in Grafton and someone did the same thing. Just kept hitting me over and over because i was in the vendor for like 3 whole minutes. 
---
After like 30 hits on me I get out of the screen and one shot crit him in mellee. Turns out he had a team of 3 just chillin outside and they didn't really know what was going on. They all died within seconds too. 
---
Then they all came back...and died again within a minute. This went on another 3 or 4 times. Good thing they wern't very good at PVP. Like at all. 
---
After this I started getting messages from the friends asking why I'm doing this in a super whiny tone. My response: "Ask your friend. I don't start shit, but I do make sure to end it." 
---
Not sure why they kept coming at me. I spent maybe a half a dozen bullets to make several hundred caps.
---
My favorite are the guys that try to Jack you in teams. One lower level hitting you with some switchblade or something while his level 100 buddy in power armor and gatling plasma stands 10 feet away "out of sight" 
---
It's so laughably easy to spot that I can't help to fight it out just to pity them. Honestly, most of the time i can still best them, but even when I don't these are still the best encounters of the whe game.
---
Ahhh thanks man
---
Good thing they do next to fuck all in terms of damage.
---
Well handled. Fuck that racist jerk.
---
such people do not deserve my refined humour
---
HERESY!!!!!!!
---
BOS hates and destroys all things Mutated, Super Mutated and especially Really Mutated so in my opinion it should come from Modus instead.
---
&gt; based on your negative karma
---
the absolut state of reddit.  carring for fucking karma LMAO
---
the more you talk the more casual you sound. again if you want raiders go to fucking survival theres plent of raiders shit in pc theres 5 factions of raiders lmao . do you even play this game? i mean you cant be this casual lol.. btw hours dont mean shit if you have been playing in the fucking adventure mode .. GTFO aight by good luck with this shity post and good luck carring about karma the imaginary internet points. fuck me this casual is worse than a fucking casual.
---
Lagging behind most likely. Give them 1-60 hours üòÇ
---
Ya! That one. There's all kinds of veins in there including the occasional ultracite.
---
I had some complicatations. Dying to gutsy's that seem to have unlimited ammo and kill me around corners. Not to mention what felt like an unkillable 3 star assaultron that took an entire clip from my BE gatling plasma. Wasnt my prettiest Silo run.
---
I'd say the scorchbeast shit is more pressing than any of that.
---
Hope so, this has never happened to me before though:(
---
i made and scraped about 60 myself fun times...
---
Oh what a shocker, kotaku is being a shitty gaming journalism site.
---
It‚Äôs either server/backend lag or it‚Äôs a bug. Either way if it‚Äôs lag, it will just happen and if they fix it, it will just happen. I remember getting some of the first rewards later on and the messages like, left the vault etc in higher levels.
---
Really? I've never heard it once. One dude used some incredible cursing skill on me once for killing him in survival, but that's it. I barely even see someone with a mic.
---
Mine too. 
---
Why did I sleep in today?
---
Yongyea is too.
---
Yea the deathclaw could have been an experiment idk
---
Love how you edited all the swearing and abuse out of this because you realised you're just being an idiot now.
---
Also, were done with this little altercation now. Don't feel obliged to retort with more caveman like muttering.
---
I was kinda hoping bgs were going to use this between season time to do some bug fixing.
---
I agree they keep adding thing to gather in the game seems only fair
---
I've participated in 5 this weekend.
---
The criteria I look for before attending is if Drop Site V9 is radiation free because I don't use PA. 
---
Drop Site V9 has plenty of room for the Queen to land, and that lovely fence for my squishy bloodied build. All were successful, everyone gave thumbs up, and the server was stable. :)
---
Maybe your TV isn't set up right?
---
I agree: that's a post-apocalyptic wasteland, not a radioactive amusement park.
---
I feel this man. Once I built my pc I notice the quality of comms improved in most games and the average player base seems a lot older. Also I absolutely can‚Äôt understand why people would go back after experiencing 144HZ. Awhile ago I fixed the 60 FPS cap for Fallout and now it‚Äôs always running around 150 fps and I never lag like crazy when things load in usually only dips to 90 FPS. This game just looks so much better when it‚Äôs not constantly dipping to 46 FPS because of everything always loading in.
---
I fully agree. I actually like it that there are games made with the younger crowd in mind. So we can all have our place.
---
Fuck! That would just mess with me for the pure riddle of it. Especially given that particular game.
---
I'd like to know this too
---
Once you do Mayor for a Day, there is a box in the building where the robot mayor is near that robot mayor with some stimpaks you get everyday.
---
Xbox live has a "looking for group" function and players can stream on Mixer i believe.
---
I'm more referencing the old COD lobbys than anything. Ive had vey few negative experiences with any game recently.
---
Yeah I believe if I get railway spikes they weigh like .3 with the 2nd level of the perk that makes your ballistic ammo weigh less
---
Ikr
---
Whitesprings haha, that‚Äôs where I get a bunch of mine. Then I break them down to diluted stimpacks with the chemist perk. I also farm the ticks at the cabin near fallout 76 then by the lumber mill just past that. You can usually craft at least two or three times which should give you 4 or 6 stim packs. Plus with super duper perk, 1 of those times should give you an extra 2 or 4!
---
How do you even have that much? Dude I barely have 2k lol
---
They are kids. Kids do stupid ass things. Do you not remember yourself?
---
Besides, once again, they are kids. They are easy to beat because they just don't have the years of accumulated experience. 
---
And they pay out the same as an adult. Caps are caps.
---
I'm going to disagree with this because any Xbox server I have been playing on has been full, active, and the players participating in events. Your experience is different from mine, and I wonder why?
---
But the contruction light billows out loads of light over a huge distance

---
A cryolator with reduced weight (they are heavy!) or cryo grenades are great against vats builds, it instantly drains their ap making their build useless in 5 seconds flat, damage per second beats damage per shot in pvp too so an automatic radium rifle is a good tool to have preferably with faster fire rate. Railway rifles will stagger a sentinel build so they can take damage, a executioners gamma gun takes care of bloodied builds efficiently. Stealth boys can be used for an edge over a variety of builds and will destroy a snipers build and melees build which relies heavily on vats critical. Chems and buffs will be your friend, ballistic bock or high voltage hefe for guns with psychotats gives a considerable damage boost and a reasonable damage resistance, for melee fury is a great chem gives a 30% damage boost and some damage resistance also glowing meat will add an extra 10% damage also.
---
I thought the bones next to Grafton Sam would work, but they don't seem to.
---
I'm on PC maybe that's why, recently i was placed couple times with French speaking players and I'm in UK. I agree that servers are usually quite full but one server seems to cover much bigger part of the world then it used too.
---
Ikr? I thought they removed nights.
---
hoard less.. spend more..
---
get your trickle down on.. the economy needs YOU!
---
Whenever I go near Whitesprings I get absolutely murdered by charred things, it sucks.I thought it wasn't meant to be that high level.
---
Hospitals, or kill ticks and make your own (use chemist and super duper)
---
I want an ice cream sandwich..
---
Wait, do bloatflies that come out of a legendary always come as legendary?
---
The basement in house at the Sons of Dane compound (where One Violent Night takes place). You do need lockpicking 3 though.
---
I'll be honest. I'm almost 40 years old, and up to this point I've intentionally managed to keep myself out of every single online game. I don't have any experience at all. 
---
Well I guess I did play Diablo 1 for a little while. Not sure you could even message then though.
---
Sorry man I did not get home till way late and ended up crashing for the night since I had to be at work this morning
---
I suggest using the pharma farma perk card, I think that's the one you can search containers for chems with. Any place with bathrooms really, you'll generally find a medicine cabinet you can search along with sometimes a chem container or a first aid kit on the wall. You'll find a decent amount of stims. You can even equip the perk that makes them heal for more then dilute them to stretch them out.
---
That shit is everywhere.
---
This is pretty sad, but to be honest not too surprising. Of course the barrel does the opposite of what it says it does. I guess at this point we have to test pretty much everything before taking it for granted
---
They should make a bank location imo
---
Why are you all bitching so hard on Kotaku in many Reddit posts. I like to read Kotaku but would not take it personal if they rant over a favorite game of mine. Even if they repeatedly talk about an unfixed bug, then be it. 
---
Dont read stuff you dont like and get over Kotaku :-)
---
(x) to doubt on this one
---
Me too. RIP Steve
---
Good story. I don't know how you console players put up with it? From what I hear it seems to happen pretty often on Xbox.
---
Since I found the plan at a player vendor and crossed the plan list someone on here made....they list it as light robot torso.....its worded weird but that's the plan
---
Do a few of the easier events, like Grafton Day.  They often reward 3-4 Stimpacks.
---
The perk card Pharma Farma can help you get a ton of Stimpacks from places with lots of medical containers, like AVR and the runway around Morgantown Airport.
---
Some player vendor still them cheaply too if you have the Caps.
---
Ah, so you have the added language barriers as well to contend with. I'm in the States, so this only occurs for me when my East coast server has players from Quebec and Montreal and I clumsily attempt to converse with them using inferior 'fran√ßais j'etudier dans l'√™cole'.
---
very odd.
---
Can you post a picture of the xbox messages
---
tell me about it, i had to move away from my previous camp to the forest to get away from it.
---
I do events. They usually give a Hand full for completing them.
---
Otherwise find a place that has loads of chem boxes and use the perk that finds more chems when you "search" chem boxes.
---
What about helping other players, is it tedious too? :)
---
Kotaku is an activist organization. Not much of journalist site if you ask me.
---
This is happening a lot more often.  I mean, who can‚Äôt wait the fucking 30 seconds it will take for me to cash in my legendaries?  No different than some idiots that try to gank if you don‚Äôt trade or buy stuff from them.
---
This was also in the official guide.
---
The 'unmarked' legendaries most likely were marked as Diseased, and that prefix will overwrite the Legendary one. That's nothing new, enjoy and move on. You will experience it again, I know because I do every day.
---
How did you come to this conclusion? I'm genuinely curious as to your methodology. Keep in mind that I am still learning all of this as well.
---
I see that both "EndangerolDamageDamageResistEffect "-25% Damage Resist" \[MGEF:000628E5\]" and "EndangerolDamageDamageResistEffect\_Contact "-25% Damage Resist" \[MGEF:003C6540\]" reference to apply "EndangerolPerk "Endangerol" \[PERK:0024754A\]" which has [this](https://imgur.com/a/vZHzI40) effects record.
---
The only record of magnitude 0.75 that I have found so far related to Endangerol\* is [this](https://imgur.com/a/Kk79L1C) effects record for "EnchSyringer\_Endangerol "Endangerol Syringe" \[ENCH:003C653B\]."
---
Due to a lack of knowledge I can't make a conclusion either way from what I've seen. I was hoping that you could help enlighten me.
---
I found an alien in the back of a truck wearing a hat.

You mean they catch the tossed dross?

Chemist per with super duper is where it's at. Save all of your normal stimpacks and craft them into 4 diluted stimpacks with the 30 percent chance of doubling it with super duper. That's an expected value of 5.1 diluted for every normal stimpack you have.
---
If everyone refused to pay more than 1,500 caps for a TSE guess what the price of a TSE would be ?
---
he (she?)'s a pesky bugger to find. been hunting his hoverly little green butt
---
As a PC player we have no way to message other players in the server. So anything is better than nothing.
---
Drugs are Adult Candy.
---
Probably.
---
But it's hard to understate how much influence other players have on it.  Making friends, doing missions with them, selling items - if it were just me wandering around, I'd have gotten bored of the routine weeks ago.
---
And the irony is, I make all these Caps, and yet when I was hovering around 20,000 and was looking to buy something expensive so I could move some valuable things in my inventory to make space, I was at a loss on what to actually buy.
---
I agree with the comments on events.  I do a bunch and am always shocked to see I have 40 stimpaks in my inventory.  And I'm the type of player who eats them like candy.
---
Literally
---
I hesitantly agree,  but have concerns. I mean I can't lie obviously more space would be awesome, especially if they keep adding camp items, as my Camp is already maxed and I'm pretty attached to my current decor. And who wouldn't want more stash space, especially if like me you have 20+ of both Legendary armor and wepons for sale at any given time. Buuuuut, I worry about the games ability to handle much more, Loading my camp on log in seems to really hurt. And even my stash sketches out every now n again when I'm trying to Jenga itemes into it.
---
Open your mind and consider, there are many people on this planet right now that deserve a fate like this. Could be that the only thing preventing a victim from a bit of Justice finally blew away with the bombs and the collapse of civilization. Don't be so fast to judge a scene without first imagining both sides. What ever your initial reaction to something, always try to come at it from the other direction.
---
 I also think that fallout 76 is nothing more than a simulation and that in reality everyone is inside the vault 76. Just remember in fallout 3 that we found the father in a virtual reality
---
Unless you hold on to a bunch of gear for sentimental value, there are definitely things you can sell to make space.  Things like Flux, Stimpacks, Fusion Cores, Ultracite Scrap, Black Titanium, Fiber Optics - it all adds up.
---
I would like to see them bump it to an even 1,000 and call it a day, though.  People will complain about any number you set it to, but 1,000 has a plausible finality to it.
---
Btw. Naming someone on this sub in regards to swhat happened is against the rules and is regarded as witch-hunting. You should edit this post to remove the name or delete the post. If not the mods definitely will.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs kill 20 players. Psn is brm138 if anyone wants to help or get help completing it
---
So I don't really get why you would need that many caps there is nothing to buy that cost that much or is worth that much. If they increase the caps limit it would just drive up market prices.
---
Gunsmith affects all ‚Äúguns‚Äù. Gauss rifle ammo is one half energy one half ballistic, realistically speaking. 
---
As in fallout the cartridge is class as energy for simplicity sake.
---
hey man i had another person come by and help thanks anyways!
---
Thanks, I‚Äôve edited it
---
Watoga emergency services. Equip pharma farma on a good day you‚Äôll walk out with 10-15. If you search all the med containers.
---
I'd just toss it in a vendor machine and see what happens.  Like Explosive or 25% Fire Rate, anything with +swing speed gets some attention, especially when it's a Slow weapon.
---
But in general, War Drums are one of a dozen mediocre "gag weapons" in the melee pool.
---
because there was a bugg where you could dupe items with the terminals. that is why they are disabled.
---
Yep cheap move üëéüèª
---
But if the vault tec was doing that, this connects with the theory vault tec had started the war.
---
caps are needed for opportunities. Every day at least one player wants to sell powerful stuff for an insane amount of caps because he can buy something even more powerful from a third player for an even more insane amount of caps. For this moment, you have to be prepared with a full wallet. :)
---
But...Meta does sort of mean best...Most Effective Tactic Avay..
---
Nah. Vamp on wardrum isn't that great and wardrums weight a ton.
---
Agreed. You think that one 3* that cost 20k is high now? Raise the limit and watch it go to 30-45k solely because why not.
---
I am assuming this is a gun build because of the gunsmith 5. But then are also using Incisor and Martial Artist. Honestly have no idea what you are trying to do here. 
---
"Master of none" or "Jack of all trade" builds will get the same job done as a more optimized build, you are just going to spend a lot more resources (ammo, repairs, stimpacks, time, etc) to do it.
---
After playing this since beta. I feel the feeling a lot of people didnt play FNV: Dead Money or at least learn the lesson of letting go.
---
What‚Äôs a seal the tourist?
---
After some investigative journalism, it was discovered that the young man's username was SuperCena and he refused to believe that anyone could actually see him.
---
Even just like 50, hell, 30 should cover any single item, if not a few, just for internal item shuffling. Nothing sucks more than finding what ur main needs while playing alt and knowing that there's no way to get it to them other than trusting a complete stranger, which isn't gunna happen.
---
I'm on most evenings my gt is EzGrooveRider add me.
---
You are missing out on so much damage if you are splitting between melee and rifles.
---
I would suggest if you want both of these is this. https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3f355eb&amp;d=e00c72ic4a72au2ao0ar2p02l71lu2ep1lv2pp2pd2pk2pl2cr0an2a30lk2se2&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=89ce3
---
As just having legendary armor with +1 strength will help with unarmed melee enough and if you have swing speed unarmed weapon it deals enough damage for being a backup weapon.
---
I just assumed you where going to be semi stealth because your points in agility so yea... and you probably can just swap out white knight with something else if you are stealth as you shouldn't get seen.
---
The feeling when you find this one person with mic on and he doesn't speak English üòû
---
I love everything about this story.
---
My only question is...mind describing your build?
---
I'm a chameleon sniper, and always looking for how to optimize my gear.
---
Um... the way I'm looking at it is if the handcuffed victim didn't have the mental acuity to use their feet to reach the food it means they weren't as capable as their Captor which in turn leads me to see cruelty performed on the Captive.
---
Grats! I hit 45 earlier this morning... though it's on my 5th toon. I still love it. I really am glad I have all these toons, as soon as I feel like something is starting to get stale, I can switch characters and objectives. Currently have 3 above 100 and 1 in the upper 80's. Funnily enough the 88-ish toon was originally my highest level toon.
---
Get out of my shop. My 1c fusion cells are not for you.

"No soup for you!"
---
Wouldn‚Äôt mind a semi daily event like fashnact with invading aliens terrorizing a place. Would be nice to have another event to bring people together.
---
The 25K limit isn‚Äôt the problem. The problem is there‚Äôs so few things to actually spend caps on when you get to the higher levels. This has been alleviated slightly with player vending, but it‚Äôs still something that needs to be addressed.
---
Welcome to the grind. I am still trying to get mods for my bloodied fire rate radium.
---
Well, you could look at it differently - was the movie Enemy Mine? What was the movie with the guy and the alien he had to learn to communicate with in order to survive? Was Lou Gossett Jr. In it? Crap, now I have to google...

Ansel is one of the tourists to find to start the bucket list quest and get your camera.

swear down it's always the best songs that they interrupt! I enjoy all of them bar a couple but there's maybe five tunes that I always turn up the volume for and then bam. Half the lines like Sanjays aren't even inherently annoying but after the 50th time they do start to grind on the brain
---
[psst: tell people what platform you‚Äôre on]
---
Grahm has a lot of those kind of plans if you can find him
---
drop a small generator and make the flood lights it basically turns night to day I have two on a wooden foundation blueprinted I just stick it in the corner and boom work site
---
Ok thanks
---
I found a player vendor with the Stimpack recipe and diluted up a bunch of them. Don't forget the healing salves - they can be helpful as well.
---
I get nothing but single shot pistols and pipe weapons
---
It will be nice if not the fact that i play like an hour per day not enough time for that plus it will require to have always the same people on the server
---
(irl platform)
---
Hrm... yeah we console players have the looking for group option available to us - I haven't used it yet but it pops up on my screen often enough that I know others use it.
---
Perhaps a Discord group would be your way to go?
---
I did it by myself. But I wouldn‚Äôt recommend that to anyone else. I just got lucky. What‚Äôs your platform?
---
What stealth nerf?
---
If your on PSN I'll help you PSN yota151.
---
If you plugged in a controller for pc I would assume it‚Äôd work exactly the same.
---
Challenges still seem pretty ridiculous...
---
I worry if the servers get too populated CAMP placements will get jacked up more often.
---
Lots of challenges are still bugged, even the ones that were there at launch. None of my ‚Äòdiscover locations around x area‚Äô challenges have completed, despite having visited all the points listed.
---
I too can think of more than one reason a person could deserve this 
---
  This game/series is so wonderfully dark. I admit I have a picture of the kid from the wavy williard's quest in my library. The only story I have found so far in the game with a"happy"ending, he made it to a vault. Hell maybe he is one of us. I like to imagine him, decanted from the vault, finding his old nannybot and finishing the quest, reliving the childhood trauma, and finding out his sweet nanny carries around a fiery automatic weapon.
---
Lol thanks for the stuff.
---
Just a mule. I have a lvl 5 with 60+ weapons and 30+ armor.

Official response from Bethesda is this:

You can use them, but the game might not work as intended. That is the official stance.
---
Ps4. By far. Just look in the trading subs and see the distribution of players. PS4 dominates.
---
nukacrypt.com
---
Agree 100%
---
Maybe used to toss the nukes. And today he wanted to try something different.
---
Bob the super mutant was known far and wide for his abnormally strong right arm even for a super mutant. His favorite thing to do to pass the day was to grab a mininuke from his stash in the woods and lob them at traveling traders and laugh when they exploded into chunks or vaporized on the spot. One day he became sick of doing the same thing day in and day out and he started giving his mini nuke stash away and he noticed that some super mutants couldn't throw as far as he could so they just ran into people before detonating and killing all in range. One day he realised he had given all but one mininuke away and realised that once the last one had gone he would no longer be feared by anyone. So with his last mininuke in hand he remembered back to those who ran directly into danger to go out with a bang and he thought this is how he would leave this world.
---
Scrapping them worked for me. If you are on pc I'll mod it for free if you'd like.
---
Very cool!
---
Thanks but unfortunately I‚Äôm on the PS4
---
They‚Äôre giving us ‚Äòlet‚Äôs nuke‚Äô because there‚Äôs been a drop off in people firing off nukes, due to the shit loot the scorchbeast queen dishes out. I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs so hard to just have the SBQ drop a guaranteed three-star legendary, but here we are.
---
Did you scrap a short one and get a long barrel? Or was it specifically already long
---
Prices are already much higher than the cap, people just can't buy those things because the cap limit is low and there's no good system of item-for-item trading in this game. Things already sell for the value of 60k caps or more
---
Watoga Hospital, make sure you have the luck perk where theres an 80% chance that you will get more aid.
---
Don't rush it. I waited until 80ish to do it solo and it was hard my first time.
---
Pretty sure I had five of him trying badly to do the sheepsquatch yesterday. Event ended with it at full health.
---
Really? That‚Äôs odd that they would include stuff not even out yet lol
---
Naw he reported OP for using an invisibility build and I'm guessing the kid didn't know that you could do that lol
---
What's not to love about this great game
---
A thousand.
---
It happens. Now ya know. Take it as a learning point.
---
My wife thinks I am! 
---
I‚Äôve always been addicted to Fallout games and Elder Scrolls games as they‚Äôre so immersive.
---
FO76 is designed to keep us playing by making ‚Äúgrinding‚Äù activities so repeatable, like you alluded to OP.
---
Thats...  when did OP act like a cunt?
---
I'm using discord but recently luck 15 is required to find a teammate in less then hour üòÇ
---
So this wooden platform im standing on in game isn't any help?
---
Every drop I scrapped was the short barreled version. Luck and Intelligence will influence how often you get mods from scrapping I believe. Scrapper mod in the intelligence tree seems to drastically increase the odds.
---
West Virginia.
---
Two Shot Flamer? lol how does that even work? üòÇ
---
My first 3* was a Furious Fatman that I was able to sell for $3k but since then, it‚Äôs been 80% bust rate.
---
Nice I have 14 intelligence, 11 luck and scrapper so I guess I‚Äôll keep on scrapping. Thank you
---
Are star jumps the same as jumping jacks?
---
Not long started. Didn't realise the plans didn't lock automatically! Had to go through pipboy to notes.
---
But in fairness I was worried the game would be terrible (big fallout fan), but I have really enjoyed my time so far with it.
---
Sweet vindication, thank you so much for testing this out and showing us the receipts!
---
I can‚Äôt play more than 2 hours without A Scorched Earth Event being triggered and the guilt gets me there every time. 
---
I never regret it but it‚Äôs a pain to stop what I‚Äôm doing, drop my junk off at and then then join the killing spree.
---
The gun doesn't have to have the mod you want, scrap em all and good luck!
---
Out in the Mire there's a shack that always spawns 7 or so ticks. Use Butcher's Bounty for additional tick blood. It's in the southern part of the Mire, an unmarked location, and if you look where the railroad and river are parallel to each other on the map, it's bordering the river on the northern side of it. Not difficult to find. Use Chemist and Superduper to make a ton of bloodpacks from the tick blood, and then make stimpacks. You can spend half an hour doing it and get 100 to 250 stimpacks out of it. I do it about once a week with how much of a yield it gets me.
---
Not everyone is part of the 0.1% that has 4 accounts all max inv. and max caps. 
---
Most people walk with around 1k-6k caps at any time. 
---
Bethesda does not balance the game for the 0.1% but for the most part for the other 99%. 
---
Go buy some serum mutations and sell the serums, 
---
Lol i swear its almost like people dont play the same game .
---
Now that you say negative information sells well, I remember that my most upvoted post on this subreddit was when I posted about an atom shop item that wasn't as advertised. I didn't mean to bash, but yeah I was a little negative(because I really wanted that atom shop item to look like the picture). And it got upvoted so much. Or maybe my positive posts were never that good :p
---
Wait for the daily "3\* legendary should drop 3\* loot"
---
Turns out, Endangerol definitely does *not* work, at least not as advertised. Proof:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bvulfc/endangerol_syringer_test_round_2/
---
Apparently though, and I haven't confirmed this yet, but you may be able to get those elusive Deathclaw Hides from them. So, yes, I have been shoving my hands into piles of Scorchbeast dung...repeatedly.
---
Forgive the noob statement here but I'm level 50 and I don't even know where to access events like this aside from the glowing blinking yellow hexagons on the map. Is there a menu based area to see what events are active?
---
im sorry im on PC
---
Think I saw it posted twice today
---
im on PC sorry I was trying to do it again and finally got a keycard
---
Honestly, just capture workshops and do easy events. The rewards always give you stimpacks and money.  Pharma pharma is really good as well.
---
Depends on the server but I like the disparity.
---
I usually see 3 tiers on a full server.
---
Tier 1: Low Level / mules (30%)
---
Tier 2: Medium Level (50-90)(50%)
---
Tier 3: High level (91+) (20%)
---
*Rough estimates.
---
(If you want a server full of high levels, check out survivor - it‚Äôs been dead every time I check but I hear it‚Äôs filling up lately)
---
I used to think Bethesda had all this data on how stuff was working, what was popular not anecdotally, but statistically.
---
Learning this weapon does the opposite of what it says it does, I no longer think there‚Äôs anyone at the wheel in that sense.
---
L
---
It takes scrapping quite a few of most weapons to get mods. Probably took me around 20 or 30 to get the mods for the gatling and there aren't that many.
---
idk, but not everyone lives here at forums, having a life outside of it, so sry, as it seems i'm not into all this things. but the chance for you guys being here 24/7, see similar posts is actually very high. why not go out from time to time and take a deep breathe of fresh air. honestly, works wonders. and also helps against arguing over minor issues like repeated posts.
---
I like my games to have no parameters at all
---
Well the people that post those prices and the ones that pay them are idiots imo
---
a) You are assuming massive inflation.
---
b) If there in inflation it is balanced.  Meaning if the prices of things go up, what does it matter at all?  It only means the things you get that drop are of more value when you sell them.
---
Its actually not godly. My AA hm for example with faster fire rate does 180 pip boy dmg , so it farts out the same dmg i think if not more than a quad dragon would . Dont just look at dmg / shot . I may be wrong . Im no number genious though

---
Great story, but it was the ‚Äúwith my new appendage‚Äù line that finally made me upvote lol.
---
I think a previous post explained that since it's a random.chsnce every time you scrap to find a mod, the less mods you have left to learn, the smaller the overall chance to find them was? I'm sure someone else remembers and can explain it better
---
I just nuked the thorn and fort defiance a couple hours ago and was kinda anti climactic cause was expecting a lot more than what I received, there was 2 glowing bloated ones and a wendigo at the thorn (I hit that place just cause), fort defiance only like half the ghouls turned to glowing bloated and the other half was still charred.
---
That sucks. Finally switched to dense mod on the chest armor and don‚Äôt die anymore from explosions ( or my explosive gun). Even with a low hp bloodied build.
---
Your armor is technically unequipped in PA so no.
---
I played with Bear Arms, Ordinance Express, and Demolitions Expert until last week (12 ranks in Str with my other perks as 2 Lock and Load, 2 Incisior, 2 Martial Artist), and it is amazingly fun if you gear properly. Grenadier is good to increase the area of effect you're working with, +50% limb damage on an M79 usually leaves mobs hobbling slowly towards you, and while missile launchers don't do an amazing amount of dps I really enjoyed strapping a targeting computer on a  missile launcher and using it to tag/end flying enemies

You're doing this to yourself

Thank you for sharing! If you don't mind me asking, at what location on the map are those three stacked stones located? They are shown in the 7th picture from the top. I feel like I've seen them before but for the life of me I can't remember where! Is it above Charleston? Ah well, no sense in guessing it's a big map. Also, since I like your second favorite camp more than the first one pictured I'm curious why you seemingly like the first one more?

What about uploading a video about it AFTER it's fixed? YouTube barely cares by this point. They prefer shoving more and more ads into videos ^(COUGH COUGH ad 1 out of 2 COUGH COUGH) than useful stuff like this.
---
Don't think you can trade /sell /drop that item. Pretty sure it's bop
---
Without clicking links:  Morgantown airport
---
Agreed, the chrome and gold handmade skins look promising though. Some tactical looking options would be awesome and maybe a sniper skin for the gauss too?
---
It would be nice to have a higher cap limit, but in terms of most things that would just be putting a bandaid on the issue. What we really need is more cap sinks in the game. Plans are a temporary sink, and not everybody wants to blow hundreds of thousands of caps on plans they will never use. The ISS event hype lasted a few weeks, now nobody runs it anymore. The player vending tax is great, but it's a long-term solution, and isn't enough by itself. Fast travel costs are far too low to act as a cap sink; if you position your camp wisely and use vault 76 to save money, you should be able to fast travel to an event anywhere on the map and come out with a net profit upon completing it. We need actual cap sinks. Here are just a few suggestions:
---
An advertisement campaign for your player vendors, which lets people see what you're selling from wherever they are/wherever the billboard etc is. It can cost for example 500 caps per hour of server time, or a percentage of the value of the items you're selling. 
---
The ability to "rent" or "trial run" an atom shop paint or clothing set for caps. 
---
Faction NPCs to give any of your weapons/armor a unique paint job based on that faction, only available by paying for it with caps. A hotel room you can rent (like those empty houses at the whitesprings, maybe?) to count as a free fast travel location and provide a bed, crafting stations, etc.
---
This is already a wasted opportunity, but imo repair kits should have been something only obtainable by buying from a certain NPC. They don't have any game-changing effect and are only a slight convenience for the lazy or unprepared. That kind of convenience is far better suited as a cap sink than an atom shop item
---
Hell, what about some kind of goodie bags from each faction? They can hold anything from junk and low-tier gear to a rare faction-specific plan/mod/unique item or a legendary. People would be spending large sums of caps for those high-end rewards, and others would be spending large sums of caps buying out these loot boxes or whatever you'd want to call them
---
You on PS4? Swear I saw the exact same base while running around last night.
---
This is why I'm glad all the major multi-player releases I'm interested in for PC are on consoles now, too. It release-valves children off the platform.
---
Yeah, three skins for Pump Shotguns, bit of a waste if you ask me since there are 3 types of shotguns and it would have been a cool little package. Only lever action rifle has skins and the black powder rifle
---
Do you have a link to the handmade chrome and gold images? Assume these were datamined?
---
Hey no worries!
---
Oh really? Dang. Ok

Pump only, makes them more money üòû

I‚Äôll see if I can find them, they were datamined indeed, saw them on here a couple of weeks ago.

I'm not that naive, and I also think I could use them now that I have exams to prepare D:

Thank you! I am starting up fallout right now so I‚Äôll e able to join you in a minute

So everyone turn off pacifist mode and then tag everyone with the syringer for big fights? ;)

You're apologizing for using a PC?

Hi SnakeMan1931!
---
Pls Bethesda Can every enemy drop a god rolled 3* item?

I am apologizing for not saying it in the post

Thanks! I asked because of difference of "real" gauss and Fallout interpretation of it. 
---
Regarding "all guns" - does this mean that heavy guns also included?
---
How do you know their dietary and sexual habits?
---
Thanks for the info. It's a shame we can't remap those controls for keyboard users then.
---
Why don't BGS want to make money, this sub is full of repeating threads suggesting asking for different skins.
---
crickets...
---
IASIP
---
Until you hit that wall again. I had a good system at 400 but I couldn‚Äôt imagine going back to it now.
---
sry PC
---
And the hunting rife has skins, and the minigun, and fat man and 10mm pistol and a bunch of melee have skins
---
I would buy it for 250 caps
---
I think they should make camp and stash sizes a questable and craftable item.
---
For example, why isn't there a quest to build another stash box that adds +100?  Make it super difficult and elite and I'd chase it for days on end.  Make it stackable but with increased difficultly for each incremental increase in size. Start big +100 and then make each increment smaller and smaller and more difficult to obtain.
---
Elite players would have sprawling bases with massive stores which would be desirable and pretty cool imo.
---
Right now I'm handicapped by the size of my base and stash.  I barely have items listed for sale because I often switch between my melee builds and Gunner based on what I'm doing.  Oh also please let me finish the roof of my 4th story build! Sadness fills my heart (also with rain) due to the fact I don't have a proper roof.
---
Let me clarify: the different alien ranks are listed.
---
Id be happy with a 2* every now and then...
---
On the contrary, people selling their god rolls for 1000 caps when plenty of people are willing to pay 20000+ are the true idiots
---
Nah i like the cap. The higher the cap limit the more expensive people will make high end items. Ever since the L and player vendor prices have been really modest and manageable for everyone. All an increased bank will do is raise prices and drop the value of caps.
---
Well. Someone has to do it.

Idk I‚Äôve been under 700 in the 800 stash limit currently for about 2 months. Even got down to 600 when the legendary exchange came but now I‚Äôm hovering between 650-700. I just don‚Äôt keep that many weapons anymore as the weight reduction perks don‚Äôt work in the stash which I guess makes sense but at the same time I‚Äôd prefer it count the perks I‚Äôm not picky though!
---
Thats not true. People are getting scammed for anything over 20k. I see god tier gear for about 10-20k all the time.
---
Yes it does. Two makes a noticeable difference versus one for me. It's my understanding that the max you can stack together and still benefit from is three. But, I have not confirmed that myself and I do not have proof on-hand. Two has been more than sufficient for my needs.
---
Could of  been super mutants that double dipped a deathclaw in the green stuff...
---
Yeah, I try to keep it closer to the 700 side myself in case I need the space but lately I‚Äôve been closer to the 770 mark until I can figure out what‚Äôs not selling and clear it out.
---
&gt; spawn outside of the build zone
---
That means you wil fall to your dead. I finally got people to spawn at the right place by moving the c.a.m.p. thingy.
---
I have just tried it again a scorchbeast without any armour damage resistance =50(mutation) without empath didn't get much damage with empath and all my armour (vanguard etc 500dr) took much more damage, same scorch beast south of white spring
---
Isn‚Äôt it their tongue?
---
I wish they allowed multiple people to use the vendor at once like other games.
---
Then you have a very different perception of what god-tier is. A 1* bloodied handmade can already sell for 10k. It's how a free market works. You can rant and rave against it all you want, but your only options are accepting it or getting screwed by it. I guarantee you if you're selling high tier legendaries at the price you personally think they *should* be instead of their real value, half your buyers are just people who are going to resell them for a massive profit.
---
The reason people are getting scammed is because bethesda hasn't bothered to put in an item for item trading system. If that were there, people could trade a million caps' worth of gear at once safely
---
I've had issues with Norton and online games so I switched to avg. 
---
One the Bethesda launcher there is an option to scan and repair. If you haven't tried that, you might also try that.
---
I'll give it a look. Thanks for the tip
---
Can't wait to see the poster for the Ass Heap
---
Nice, what door is that?
---
Terrable idea... I prefer to spawn in a wall rather an spawning in a decontaminate shower :o
---
With high strength I can carry 3 rifles and a .44 with 300+ shots for each. Also have a battle axe for stealth attacks.
---
Could min/max more I guess.
---
Thanks
---
If you're on ps4, I could point you to a super awesome fb (I know) group I use whenever I need to transfer stuff.
---
So that's what berry mentats do. I don't use drugs because I don't feel like looking around for an Addictol.
---
As luck would have it, about 30 minutes after posting this, I had a level 50 Bloodied M79 drop (I'm also using a bloodied Grognak for melee). I'm still not sure I want to dedicate all those points into Bear arms and Ord Express for a missile launcher and fat man, but I've definitely got space for 5 ranks of Demolitions and two ranks of Grenadier without mucking up my melee build.
---
Does the M79 require Heavy Gunner? I remember when the game first launched it was getting bonuses from Shotgunner, but I recall this being a bug that I'm assume they fixed.
---
I used to be a nice guy in FO76, but the more they remove PVP elements the more I want to be mean to people. Forbidden fruit, I guess.
---
Very good comment! I actually hadn't considered this! Perhaps he was a looted that harmed or killed this guy's family.  Definitely understandable considering those circumstances.  A deserving punishment if indeed something like that occurred.
---
Wear 5 pieces of weapon weight reduction armor and become the stash box
---
I think if it‚Äôs still broken you can drop them. I‚Äôll have to check if you can sell the broken ones. I k ow the repaired ones get destroyed
---
Oh how I dream of a love-child between this game and modded minecraft.
---
Your next challenge: make it more aesthetically pleasing and/or more realistic. It's quite the challenge currently.
---
No problem
---
You can‚Äôt remap them for controllers either though.
---
Why would griefers prohibit fast travel mats?
---
If you're on ps4 hit me up
---
Well it can't be addressed forever. If you have stashed 100k and bought all the plans in the game, there is not much left to do and that's alright. 
---
Now you have the convenience of being able to buy as much ammo as you want at someone else's camp.
---
See now that‚Äôs not a solution that‚Äôs an excuse. And who‚Äôs most of us? Your speaking for an entire community? Plenty of people trade so enough with the most of us or high level bullshit, I‚Äôm level 150 and have been playing since launch.
---
Fast traveling to a room full of pungi boards, rad traps, flamer traps, etc
---
If they end up adding the logic gates from fallout 4, you could make your wildest dreams come true.
---
No, Better option is to have the fast travel mats, and if people see someone griefing, just take a pic and send it to Bethesda and boom he's temp banned for week.
---
*hello emote*
---
AA is definitely better then furious. I have an executioner's combat rifle that i self nerfed to .38 and it still packs a wallop...executioners is definitely undervalued imo.
---
You can buy lots of nuka cola drinks from bubbles in white springs I got one of every type and 7 basic nuka colas, I made a nuka cola bar with cheap nuka cola for low levels.
---
Ah. Ok. That makes sense. Lol
---
For stealth combat either Bloodied, AA or Instigator
---
Depends on his experiences are to be honest. If he played with nothing but toxic people for the past 2 weeks he might be a little more defensive. Still no excuse though.
---
Yes, I would rather have fast travel mats, you aren't understanding the point. My point is that if Bethesda doesn't want to add fast travel mats because of griefers, this is an alternative
---
doing the camden dailies can yield stimpacks as well as supers and radways.  There are three diff ones there to do one random one daily but you do get to do all three the first time you get there.  You can also get blood leaves and door and craft healing salves.  If you are on PC, im philis401 and I occasionally put supers and diluted in my free supply vendor if im on.
---
As I understand it (which is both minimally and poorly!), precombines wouldn't affect most of the objects in scope for "player decorating" (basically, anything you can pick up and scrap), but rather only "permanent" objects and decorations.
---
That said, I suspect the limits the developers worked under would be underwhelming to players if they were given the chance to use them. Think of the "busiest" predefined areas in the game - the ones with the most "stuff"... now think of what players try to stuff into their camps.
---
Do we really think that players *won't* try to display every teddy bear and clean pillow they find in a huge pile in the corner? Or line every railing with beer bottles? Or build pyramids of dog food cans taller than themselves?
---
If the engine *can't* support that - *and* having six or eight players and any number of enemies in that same area with physics applying to *everything* \- then why should they bother? Said another way, if the budget for decorating were so small that people couldn't be stupid, then all they've done is created a(nother) stream of constant complaint.
---
Honestly one of my biggest pet peeves is news sites turning the words of posts and updates. One good example is a news site saying the Freefolk Fundraiser is to make "amends" for finale petition which it isn't. Plus Kotaku literally searches "Hot" and writes their article off posts there and twisting words.
---
Also you can get a gas price sign and put the nuka cola quantum sign from the atom shop to make a cool little advertisement billboard
---
I think you‚Äôre overestimating the toxicity of the 76 community. There are totally dicks on here, but fast traveling to a camp and being surrounded by traps would be very unlikely
---
If you're looking to err on the side of caution, the lockpicking aid mods aren't going to be of interest to you, but everything else on Nexus should be OK. There's a huge difference between a QoL mod that makes inventory easier to navigate and, say, an aimbot.
---
If Bethesda was in the business of banning users for standard-issue modding, they've had ample opportunity to put out a statement to that effect, and Nexus likely wouldn't even have a FO76 section. Instead, their stance is "Go nuts, but if you break it, you're on your own"
---
That's my method. 69? I'm feeling fine.
---
Ah man, this is awesome. I wish I could hire people to kill griefers that do that shit to me. I'm not a very high level and I get messed with and can't really do much about it for revenge.
---
Yea, I love giving stuff away to folks. I don't care if they are a brand new player (though, I prefer that), or someone like me who has played since launch. I mean as it is, I have a completely full stash (probably 20lbs are clothes lol), and only 3 vending machines but with \~40 plans, 28 legendary armor pieces, and 18 legendary weapons (most 3\*)... Yet I still have 15+ weapons and 10+ armor pieces **on** me *(thank you 3x -20% weap weight armor!)*, with probably 75 plans. Every day I deplete the 150 Scrip we can exchange... so if I become over encumbered I don't even bat an eye at giving away legendaries or valuable plans :P
---
As such, I was **just** like you... though since I'm coming across all these cameras, why collect  some and drop them off in the Overseer's chest in Flatwoods? (Though now that I think about it, I had a derpy moment since I hadn't considered they'd need the 'Bucket List' paper to initiate the quest... GG me)  
---
With 9 in hand I got there and... there I proceeded to uncover aaallllll the things we "can't" do with them! :D 
---
It was definitely a bummer, since we just wanted to help... but eventually I realized why it is that way, which at least made it a *little less* of a bummer. :) 
---
**TL;DR -** I, too, like to help out and give stuff away, so it sucked not to. Happy to hear the info was of use to you though!
---
How am I overestimating? I never said that tons of people would have these camps.
---
You can already grief people because the spawn point is set where you initially place down your camp, aka the middle of your build zone. so theres reason for them not to have made this a feature yet
---
Honestly vending machines are so hit &amp; miss for me at least. I feel like I put all my stuff for pretty low prices like I got a T-60, T-45 &amp; T-50 (or 51 I don‚Äôt remember what it‚Äôs called) jet pack plans for 1k.. I see people selling them for 3k, I got like all the Ultracite PA plans but I guess people could get them all just grinding the queen so maybe I should just drop them or donate. Only thing people buy is my flux &amp; my mounted head plans I keep getting bloodbug wall mounts :-(
---
I didn't say they should sell them for 1k caps 10k to 20k is the range they should be at if we increase the cap limit it would just change that price from there to double or triple for no reason. I get is a free market but the value of most if not all items in this game is so minimal with all the nerfs that happen and will continue to happen there is really no true God tier weapon.
---
I hear ya. I‚Äôm mainly shopping around for plans I don‚Äôt have myself. But I have decent luck selling 5.56 ammo and meds.
---
What I would like to see, is low lvl events to be high lvl instead.
---
I‚Äôve got every fancy teddy bear, every nuka cola (except quantum, those are pricey when i do), every alch and all the pre war board games... i figure they‚Äôre a good look among the legendary weapons etc i sell, plus i always have a mass of stims for 5 a piece, figure it helps a lot of low levels... I‚Äôm also only lvl 30 so idk
---
Have to agree if your trying stealth you need optimum damage from the first shot. Furious and excicutioner is more of the run n gun
---
Yeah, well then I wasted 35 caps just teleporting to your base. No thank you.
---
People spawn where you originally place your camp box.
---
Please fix this, its fucking annoying
---
If it shoots something it‚Äôs governed by gunsmith
---
I already know that
---
If it‚Äôs the small minority of people doing it then what‚Äôs the problem? I could easily trap somebody in my shop, it‚Äôs a 1x2 room with walls on each edge and shutters on either side, it would be easy for my to scrap the wire and lock them in &amp; trap/kill them. Basically griefers are perfectly able to piss you off without fast travel matts
---
He made a decent man's FAIR wage for his wares. Your sarcasm is not appropriate, and you're probably the guy selling them for 100 caps per, thinking its for the stack...
---
Get that weak shit outta here!
---
Next.
---
This image would be great for the Fallout wiki.
---
I want to build a brewery type CAMP...lol
---
Got stuck behind a floor and a Lion statue. Managed to jump a bit but the world literally turned upside down and i fell and died. Very weird.
---
Many thanks for clarification!
---
You're doing the good lord's work, son.
---
Yeah, make them like a picket fence/guns and bullets magazine and let us keep them for magazine rack!
---
I cannot even imagine the frustration for those players... :( So my sympathies to everyone affected by that (even if you would undoubtedly be unable to understand my comment here lol)
---
lol after lv40ish I ran thr rest of the game nood.  lvl 72 and still nood.
---
People report others all the time needlessly. If you've ever reported someone else, you will see they ask for video proof. If they didn't record it, they won't have shit. I play with avid PVPers, some of the most annoying fucks in the Wasteland, and they still have their accounts. Using Stealth Boys and Berry Mentats is like the bare minimum of Aid you need to pvp well. Lol.
---
I'm just envisioning a teddy bear screaming like Gordon Ramsay at radrats and mirelurks.
---
You FUCKING useless twat!!! Kill the fucker already!!! Fuck, me!!!
---
There are many rumors on why Bethesda wont add fast travel mats, and one of the rumors is griefing. I think you are missing the point of this post, its just an alternative if they don't want to add rugs.
---
That's laughable to charge premium for pies... These psychopaths are clueless as to what FAIR pricing is... Or worse yet, maybe they are just gouging to gut people for all they have...
---
Again, they already ARE selling far above the cap limit. You just don't see that because, obviously, they can't sell for caps. Many of the higher tier items are trade-only. Raising the cap limit would make it possible to buy those items without fucking around with dropping 30-50k cap gear around and hoping both people deliver on their promise in the trade. I don't know where you're getting the idea that prices will double or triple for no reason. Not only is that false, but even if it did, it wouldn't be for "no reason" - it would be a very clear causal effect
---
Best comment thread thread this morning. Thanks 3 Musketeers.
---
i have a setup at my camp for a decam shower to turn on everytime you walk in to my house however i have a switch that fully deactivates it for my bloodied build friends
---
Placing a travel mat could be just like other pieces that can‚Äôt be placed if that‚Äôs the case if it‚Äôs near a defensive structure or item.
---
I haven‚Äôt seen a 3* in a week, and last night a 2* dropped only a silver spoon soo if 20 posts of the same shit a day makes Beth fix it then so be it.
---
Nuh I love spawning in a radiated lakr risking waterborne disease getting shoved up my rectum daily.
---
Thats a smart idea right here
---
This made me smile
---
haha lmao\^\^
---
Everyone is a casual in this game you fucking casual
---
lol\^\^
---
I got full set of level 1 modded leather armor
---
agree. let me add another 20, just to make sure\^\^
---
Last night I nuked fort defiance. While clearing the inside I switched from hazmat to unyielding set. A dude in full xo1 initiated pvp. I smacked him, then missed with my dragon, and he 1shot me. I Hit revenge and got stuck in a loop of spawning outside the entrance in the nuke zone and dying. Took 3 deaths before I could swap to my hazmat. Good news is I went inside and blasted a hole in the dudes chest with my Dragon. Such sweet release.
---
A better solution for Bethesda is to have stackable items have no weight in stash and then reduce stash limit. The problem with larger stashes is server stability with too many items, but stackable items only count as one item in terms of server stability.
---
Hell only get a 1 day ban. I know someone who called someone a ‚Äúf***ing n****r‚Äù on 2k and he only got a 1 day ban
---
When nerfed, god tier just gets moved down to what is then best. Not disappear entirely.
---
I use a BE Handmade so I can‚Äôt sell my .556 &amp; hmm I guess I never thought about meds! Those damn stimpaks add up in weight man. I‚Äôll use my last 100 lb of stash space putting my extra stimpak‚Äôs for sale but that‚Äôs the price we pay for sales!
---
If you decide to play again and it‚Äôs still there I figured out how to fix it. I‚Äôm on XB1 and I had to go to manage game, save files and delete the save file off the Xbox. There‚Äôs 2 options, delete off Xbox or delete everywhere. DO NOT DELETE FROM EVERYWHERE! If you delete off just the Xbox your cloud save will start up next time you start the game and it will be fixed. If anyone needs a better walkthrough feel free to PM me.

We need server chat. Most good mmos have it.
---
For stealth, probably executioner's. You can hopefully get an enemy down to half with sneak attack criticals, and then finish them off when the bonus damage kicks in. Anti-armor is pretty close to useless on a weapon with that many armor penetrating options. If you use tank killer and a perforating magazine, that will really lower the effectiveness of the anti-armor bonus. Furious is pretty good on an automatic, but a handmade is a high damage weapon already, you're not really going to be hitting enemies enough to get the full bonus too often
---
The reason behind the cap limit (beside many others different users already explained) is that resources are infinite in this game therefore some kind of limit should be created. Otherwise I can simply collect every single item I find around the world and sell it, server hop and repeat the process.
---
That's damn beautiful man, can't wait to see the savage divide and other biomes
---
What is the point to ANY of the shelves or tables when you cannot even display anything on them. Fallout 4 settlements ate far superior. We need to be able to drop and clip items in Camps... Not briwn paper bags! Make the wasteland a waste again!

Ill give you my secret spot, Morgantown airport, where the cargobot lands. In those hangers.

Those skins showed up a few months ago in a datamine but for some reason haven't been released.

I have 8 Broken Deluxe Pro-Snap Cameras .. they don‚Äôt junk automatically, as I don‚Äôt need try to save them.
---
Campfire tales (grab wet kindling only) and teapot are also both great for ticks.
---
make sure you have the right building perks on maybe?
---
Pretty sure they were datamined pre-Patch 9, as the datamine from 9 was pretty lacklustre from what I recall. For ages every tuesday I'm hoping that at least one of them is released, but most of the time Atomic Shop content is weak imo.
---
Best thing I've gotten is a lv 50 Blooded, VATS crit, and less VATS cost Railway Rifle. Not actually too sure how good that was but it had A LOT of interest when I decided to offer it up for trade.
---
It is for no reason because no item in the game is worth that much these are also only assumption from what I have seen I have God tier weapons and I didn't pay anything I understand I have alot of time in the game and alot of luck but it's not worth it to grind out that many caps. Let's agree to disagree on this matter cause honestly we aren't getting anywhere and I don't care that much lol
---
I believe the proper term is scorchbeast guano
---
For a stealth commando? AA. Save the Furious for boss fights, though. It stacks up 5% more damage per hit on the same target, to a 50% cap. So it does amazing on big enemies when firing full auto; but for everyday stuff you probably aren't going to be using enough shots for the furious effect to stack up high enough to beat AA.
---
Probably a first offense on that account. I think it goes 1 day/3 days/1 week/2 weeks/perma or Something like that
---
If you quit the game completely it will resolve that. Had it happen on console last night 3 times in a row to the same world... I‚Äôm think Bethesda did this on purpose.
---
I didn't say they disappear I know how it works. Been playing since B.E.T.A and have seen the shift that continually happens
---
Apparently the director of their atom shop doesn‚Äôt want or need money. Otherwise anyone with 80 IQ would try to provide what the customers repeatedly asked for. 
---
They even nerfed shotguns right before releasing their responder skins so fewer people will buy them. I predict they will nerf the handmade before their skins come out, if ever.
---
That's not really relevant, since you already have a limit of 1400 caps per 20 hours from selling those resources. Raising the cap limit without changing any of the current ways of earning caps would have a minimal effect on the amount of caps in circulation. Sure, people can hoard more, but they are still limited to how much they can get and how much they can hold. People already hold liquid items as a placeholder for the low cap limit. Instead of hoarding sets of assassin sentinel armor or bloodied explosive rifles, people would be able to just carry around regular cash on them. That would be the only real difference to a higher cap limit
---
You get better constant damage from the AA then from F
---
Look for heavy deep pocketed leather... works awesome!
---
It just works
---
That's still not no reason. Items are CLEARLY worth that much when people are consistently and willingly buying and selling them at that price. Denying the reality around you isn't going to change it
---
Blueprints are broken (for the most part), best bet is to scrap and rebuild. You can take one of the one foundation blueprints to a perfectly flat, empty field and  still will not place. If you're on playstation I've been having a blast building bases for people and more than willing to help :)
---
Yes, put dense mod on your chest piece, it protects from explosions and schorchbeast attacks.
---
I'd love a red skin for my bloodied handmade but I shan't hold my breath, the way BGS run their business is strange beyond belief.
---
They have such odd priorities.

It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.

That‚Äôs exactly what I said. But with more words.

Thank you, I'd like it to get some steam! I think I may have got it from my historian hippie Mom, but honestly neither one of us knows where it came from. Maybe the aether? ;)
---
My camp is like a 30-second walk from there. This'll be amazing. Thanks!
---
Thx
---
It could get realy laggy on the servers
---
If it happens again try fast traveling away and then back. Can't guarantee it'll work every time but it has worked for me.
---
Yes its happened to me as well. Perhaps a glitch in the matrix?
---
Do you have launch codes? You prepared to run silo?
---
that can already happen with vendor camps. Players spawn at a specific spot, it's not hard to figure out where that spot is and trap it. So that's not a good reason.
---
Been there...the eybots were lvl 1 and dropped lvl 1 gear.

Full auto sneak criticals at point blank range at night while on chems at low health. That's all three Gunslinger rank 1 perks, Max Covert Operative, Max Mister Sandman, Rank 1 Adrenaline, Max Better Criticals, Max Bloody Mess. Add Critical Savvy, 30 Luck, and Four Leaf Clover to ensure Criticals on every hit (before it was nerfed). Mutated for Adrenal Reaction and Eagle Eyes. High on Overdrive, after feasting on Blight Soup and Awesome Opposom Jerky. All using a 1* AA 10mm with Superior Criticals on the receiver and a Silencer on the muzzle. Adrenaline at Max stacks with Gun Fu active. Lots of damage.

I can get you the stimpaks you want

I‚Äôve encountered those lowlifes in nuked WS. When there‚Äôs a crowed of glowing ones running around I would stand back and let them tag them but instead of the glowing ones they shot the vehicles next to me to get me killed so they can steal the hardened mass I picked up. It‚Äôs a game but you encounter real individuals and their shit personality when you play.
---
The current limit was almost perfect but I got greedy and have specked my main to alternate between 2 builds, it would be nice at level 150+ to have a little more space to store kit I don‚Äôt need to take with me depending on which build I‚Äôm running or whether I‚Äôm adventuring/scavenging  or fighting the sbq lol.
---
Join a friend, fill up a random stashbox (ammo/medkit) with goodies, rejoin server on different character using friends list, loot the stashbox you filled, item transfer done.
---
Haha well its perfect, especially in the part of CA I live. The gold rush, and mining culture is big around here. Not really any coal mining, but still.
---
Haha many people speak English as a second language, so thanks for your sympathy :P
---
To give you an example, in French and German the ghouls are now named something like "reach overseer rank 39".
---
A small group of people not the majority. Those few people that are willing to pay that much are the same people that would probably pay really money as well they are just dumb plain and simple. Doesn't mean they need to ruin the market for the rest of the gamers. It's a video game everything is fake it isn't even that hard of a game with base lvl items. There is no need for an inflated market because there are a few suckers who get conned into paying to much.
---
I know it's a dire injustice. I caught the /s there. :)
---
Absolutely!
---
Please? üòÇ
---
basically, yes. Say each mod individually has a 1% chance to learn. When there's 50 mods, you've got 50 1% chances to learn one, so it's basically a mod every other gun scrapped. When you're down to the last mod... you've got 1 1% chance to learn it, so you might have to scrap 100 guns to get that last mod.
---
That's not \*exactly\* right, but that's the idea.
---
I'm going to have to dive in and find it again. I thought I was somewhere west of 76. I'll get back to you!
---
Really depends on the author. They have some good folks working over there like Jason Schreier.
---
You use them at your own risk but you'll be fine with those two. If Bethesda were going to ban people for them we would have heard about it already.
---
Plus, once you start using those it'll be impossible to play without them so it won't even matter if you get banned.
---
Uh. What ELSE would they count as? Do they seem explosive to you? Energy based?
---
Thanks for sharing this, it's players like you who make this game a great experience. Are you PC or console? I'd like to stop by and say hey if you're on PC.
---
Sounds like eso, not that it‚Äôs an issue, eso is also pretty cool.
---
? Eso? Mind explaining please?
---
I had someone do that with a TSE when I was using the BoS vendorbot in Watoga (phoenix?). Somehow it punted me out of the trade dialogue, or maybe I hit a button, IDK. Either way he was like lv 250 and I was only lv 50 something at the time, so I just waited for his dickhead ass to be done with his obviously more important trading. In retrospect I should have turned on area chat and played the jeopardy theme or something.
---
I can't think of any other meaningful reason, other than server resources, behind this limit. If it comes down to more stash space vs. bigger caps limit, I'd choose stash limit.

Either money is not their priority or they are utter clueless. I don‚Äôt think the owner of their atom shop even play this game.
---
I do have one alt started in the high teens now. He's loud and melee focused with a minimalist C.A.M.P. He uses black powder and baseball bats. He drinks creek water and bathes in radiation. It's a great break from the silence of my main character when I feel things are slowing down a bit. Much more fun when my brothers are online as they're around the same level and I can give them all my spoils without worrying about my own needs.
---
Agreed, let‚Äôs do that!
---
My favorite is the "Can't place because a part of the structure would not be accessible" issue with foundations that has been popping up since patch 9. It makes moving your camp the only way to move/scrap them otherwise they're stuck in the spot you placed them forever.

Rarely does a post title make me laugh out loud, more rare when I'm sipping coffee at Dunkin. Cheers!

 Well you have to chose One hand or Two Hand, can't usefully use both at once. You can certainly collect all the cards and swap em' out when you want to switch though.
---
 I use Combat Knives and Blocker is not something that's very useful for me.
---
 I run 5 Intelligence as that's what Explosives needs. I run Grenadier in Perception for the same reason. I don't know what that has to do with Strength though.
---
It is bad at the moment. Can't place anything unless I've rubber matted it, and the doesn't work half of the time. Things in green won't place, items disappear or teleport to the ceiling etc. It's just really frustrating trying to build.
---
Don't know how many times I've moved an object and it won't go back where it was before, even though nothing else has changed. It's OK because you can snap a concrete block to another now, but in exactly the same way as before. 
---
Oh and a hotfix can fix duping (which they keep causing ffs), but nothing else.

The reason some of us explode every car when we enter an area...

Ah.

I remember back in my teenager days (old guy status engaged), we didn't fling hardcore racial slurs at each other, that seems to be a pretty recent development. The homophobic F slur though... yeah... Not proud of that one, but we are pretty fucking stupid as kids.
---
If you head slightly further east you will find the entrance to the cave, if its where I think it is! Cool little spot tbh.
---
It depends on what you're planning on fighting. The 10mm has great DPS but you burn through bullets. Revolvers seem to be more about burst damage. The 10mm is best for catching things off guard with a burst of sneak criticals. The revolvers can excel at one shot kills if spec'd correctly (preferably using Instigating or other damage legendary effects.) It just comes down to play style. As you level up, you start getting a feel of what works and what lacks, and you can Respec accordingly.
---
This is great info!
---
I‚Äôm REALLY not sure what the delay is. Huge bug fixes take priority over new events and content, as far as I‚Äôm concerned.
---
 My Rifles along with the rest are very strong. Not quite maxxed out but most of the way there. I also run Gun Runner in Agility and use a Pistol for travel sped mostly. Although off handing trash is fun. Just fun to do.
---
 I have never used VATS in any Fallout game.
---
When you wanna go?
---
 Yeah that's not exactly melee as you are using Iron Fist and it does not need those 9 slots. Its unarmed. I have a Meat Hook and its beastly but slow. It is supposed to benefit from both One Hand and Unarmed. 
---
 As my knives are so good its just a toy.
---
&gt;  Meaning if the prices of things go up, what does it matter at all? It only means the things you get that drop are of more value when you sell them
---
That's not how that works, at all.  The value of an item stays the same.
---
If you were going to trade a 3* weapon for flux the amount of flux you're willing to take for it and/or the amount of flux the buyer is willing to trade for it is always the same.  Currently we'll say one stable flux is worth 75c, if there is massive cap inflation and stable flux is worth 700c it wouldnt change the number of flux you would take for the 3* weapon.  The value of the 3* weapon and the flux is the same; cap inflation causes caps to be worth less, that's it.
---
And who had the idea to name different plans with the same name wtf? Good luck with the locker plans...
---
Keep in mind that the engine 76 is built on is old as fuck and the way a lot of things are implemented is super, *super* hacky. It's basically the same engine Morrowind was built with except with almost two decades work of duct tape and fresh coats of paint holding it all together.
---
It's kind of ironic; Bethesda has this reputation of making incredibly buggy games, but I'm pretty sure that if they can push that old engine as far as they have, they could do some absolute magic with a proper, modern game engine.
---
I'm ready now
---
Launch codes are on Nuka crypt. I'll run silo
---
I didn't see anybody mention RNG in this thread. I agree with the OP, and here's why:
---
You cant grind out the gear you want.  U must trade/buy it.  Some items truly outclass others, and they are virtually impossible to get normally in game by 1 player. So should these items all be normalized to fit in that 25k limit? No!
---
So ppl make multiple characters to have the caps to get what they want. Its a royal pain, and risky.
---
I know some ppl here get what I'm saying.
---
That's why I always follow my positive comments by a smiley face. I feel like it's way harder to read sarcasm into "good job! :)" than just "good job"
---
Always used ammosmith but just found out about super duper. Thanks!
---
I fixed this by server hopping.
---
Wait? What? If as difficult to get, it doesn't give much. How about +3 to Luck for an hour or something?
---
 I don't understand the attraction. I would not hang it on my char. ;)
---
I got two for sale in my shop- 50 caps. I hate when I accidentally scrap them... Good to have a spare.
---
Yes and no. Depends on how it's played. If you prefer sneak, the 10mm out performs it. That said, it is amazing for regular encounters, especially with the Criticals boosting the split damage past resistances.
---
Ahneat, CA. Alberta was also a haven of mining, gold prospecting, and the last bit of "civilization" before the trek to the Yukon/Alaska.

It's interesting what sorts of similarities there are between culture and linguistics among various geography.
---
Like a Legendary Kamikaze pilot - survived 30 missions!
---
Just happened to me yesterday with a level 95 diseased deathclaw.
---
I've seen it go for 6k caps and that's about the max nowadays. And that's it somebody is really, really wanting one. They usually go for beween 2-4k though
---
There are little touches like this in all Fallout games, but I feel like I appreciate them more here, what with the lack of living NPCs.  
---
Last night I came across a church close to the event with the farmer not and his very flammable fertilizer, while out searching for this Flatwoods Monster i need to check off my list.  For a second I wonder if I've found it when I feel in the door and see the huge, wicked looking idol at the pulpit.  Some dogs attack when I go in, I put them down.  There are LOTS of skeletons in the pews.  At the front on a table there's a pitcher and several glasses.  Behind the pitcher?  Rat poison.
---
As I look around, plasma thrower at the ready, I crouch and see the brackets on Hidden start to close in.  But I look all around and never did find whatever was lurking about...üò•
---
I'll say this as someone who very very frequently finds themselves over encumbered.  Fast travel is terrific, but you will absolutely miss out on things if you don't at least occasionally hoof it the old fashioned way.
---
My god, we got it wrong; this wasn't torture, but a failed survival lesson.
---
I never get tired of hearing these stories
---
They may as well add fast travel mats. Players can still grief others as it stands due to the fact visitors spawn at the original location you place the camp module. 
---
They should maybe just reverse the existing spawn at camp system. The owner should spawn where camp module is placed while visitors spawn at edge of build zone, where the owner currently spawns.
---
All that caps on a piece of clothing!?
---
10k Dense Chest plans! Woo
---
For real tho, we need stuff to spend caps on
---
Yes. It‚Äôs a glitch. If you are close to the surface the games water effects don‚Äôt always kick in
---
2-3k.
---
I'm on PC. I'm superpeon81 on BethNet. Stop by and say hi! My home will probably be under construction if I'm there. Always tearing down and building new ones.

The fix for that is simple as that? Wow, I feel like a silly goose for not trying that.
---
i was abducted too
---
Lets see how that new protecting the players works fr Mr. Spencer
---
But....why?
---
Yep. It is semi-rare because of how you have to obtain it.
---
That happened to me. Annoyed at first, but pretty funny after I went back and gathered my junk.
---
Thanks. Not sure how I missed that. Pretty obvious.
---
Ok
---
Nice!
---
I wish to remind everyone that Radium Rifles count as an energy weapon. Which means that it is affected by Rank 2 Science Expert (reduces the amount of materials needed to craft energy weapons). Also Super Duper.
---
We have 3 of the 4 same functions though. G for emote wheel, F for quick-equip, h for stimpack. And I believe they are remappable. 
---
Only one we seem to be missing is the "equip last weapon". Shame :-/ But we can use the 1-0 hotkeys for very fast weapon switching anyway, which is better than controllers.
---
I got lucky with mine. A friend gave me the coat for free
---
Yeah, they‚Äôre not going to. How about if you see a camp bristling with defenses you just wait until either a) the owner shows themselves so you can tag them thus ending camp invincibility or b) check your bloodlust and go around the camp, it‚Äôs not like they have massive range.  
---
People behave like absolute dicks in survival, and I could see people just leveling camps from out of range just to be assholes.
---
Sometimes vendors will hang around their bases. If you have a mic, ask them. I've had some say "if you don't see something you want, ask"
---
My personal favorite is 40% extra power attack damage combine with instigating.  You'll one shot everything that's not a boss with just rank 3 incisor, and instigating will be proccing a lot in solo pve gameplay.  
---
Bloodied is the most reliable way to get the highest damage, albeit at some obvious risk.  
---
Anti-Armor is great as you won't need incisor equipped anymore to do decent damage.  
---
Swing Speed is fun but never as effective as one shotting everything.  
---
Weightless is incredibly convenient on melee weapons too if you don't have weapon weight reduction armor pieces.  
---
Best theoretical imo would be a bloodied, extra power attack dmg, weightless power fist. Damage would be in the thousands with unyielding low hp build.  I've seen over 3k dmg with mutations, some chems, and adrenaline.  
---
Perhaps 50% extra limb damage is better, but I'm not really certain how the whole limb damage thing works.  
---
Swing Speed on a mr handy buzzblade raises the dps a lot I think.  A furious buzzblade with swing speed and rank 2 overly generous is actually good.  
---
Certain melee weapons like the puncturing power fist, puncturing pole hook, etc will give some armor penetration from mods.  Combine this with weighted mods on your arm armor, and you'll start noticing a damage increase because enemy armor is being ignored.
---
What?
---
Camp size doesn't increase, you can place the same amount of turrets at lvl 3 as you can at 300.
---
You sure did lol. I did the ol' grind for the one I had. Hopping servers and what not for that damned responder vendor bot. I actually did get lucky though, the first time I saw him he had it.
---
I may get downvoted for this but I am actually ok with the current camp budget. I have seen so many giant empty boxes while traveling to player‚Äôs camps. I just don‚Äôt understand why people need 15 of the biggest purifiers and then cry about not having enough camp budget.
---
I‚Äôm currently hunting for a red Asylum Uniform.
---
Agree 10000%, pvp needs balancing but there is survival mode and thats all the game should have, no need for a battle royale or more pvp modes. Some survival aspects such as food and drink and diseases need to be looked at too, i will never understand why we have to eat and drink in a game where i struggle to actually NOT find food, the game just throws it at you at every turn. Why have the "soft core" survival elements in the game when they are dumbed down to nothing but a bother because you never feel like you need to actively search for any food/drink items. They could have made having to hunt for food and stuff way more fun and useful. Just my opinion.
---
Haha, are you me? My name in game is Nova and pretty sure I had this exact rant to my friend earlier.... I build more than I do anything else, and I know this problem so well. Thought it'd be cool to have a half level for my band, used the ramp piece to bring up two foundations, then deleted the ramp and added stairs. Made a cool stage area, but the two raised pieces had become dependant on each other :( tried 20 or so times to get it to work properly, so many caps down the drain.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't someone entering the event while it's active re spawn all the enemies?  TBH I'm a little wary of joining for fear I'll screw over a player or small group who just cleared out a bunch of enemies....
---
Next on my "falloutcraft" Project list is a functional keyboard so I can play Mary had a little lamb üòÇ

That is epic. These kids have all this video game rage these days. Lol. It‚Äôs the energy drinks I tell ya. Lol
---
Exactly!
---
A little jealous on the jumpsuits since I do UF for scrip quite a bit.  But my clothes closet is already out of control and I only wear 1 outfit.
---
Just to give you an idea. I have a str of 2. I carry anywhere between 3-4 rifles all the time and in excess of 10k ammo. Bandolier 2 makes ballistic ammo basically weightless (10mm,44,45,5mm,38 weigh nothing). .308 and 5.56 weigh .001 per round. I do carry a combat knife for when I want to stick something, but I dont think I have used it in the past 50 or so levels.
---
As long as you are having fun, that is all that really matters. If you want some more help, let me know.
---
Neat
---
Well the purifier are for caps, they sell to robots.
---
My build is centered around crafting, I do everything from ammo to PA, I hunt for plans I don't have mercilessly. Hence why more space is needed, because I do so much.
---
What does the *engine* have to do with a weapon stat? Jesus Christ.
---
Ah yes, and all childish drawings around the area as well. I had assumed that a pair of mischievous kids were at fault.
---
I thought everyone likes to role play a "Raider" so what difference does it make. 
---
Gotta protect and not upset the "Raiders" right?
---
I rigged mine up to the Siren and strobe light so I never accidentally clear my rads üòÇüòÇ
---
What the fuck is a soft ban though? A soft ban? What?
---
I mean I can be deep underwater, no where near the surface and I can still see clearly. I like it alot actually.
---
you can already do that if you want: the spawn point is at the center of the build zone
---
To get the good plans. You either buy them or you buy them
---
Hard ban is perm. Soft bans are a course of time. 2 weeks, a month, 6 months, a year.
---
I swear I saw this same exact post last week... I guess the only way to get Beth to change things is to remind them all the time.
---
R/thathappened
---
Just depends on the player, I guess. I have lots of crops and 2 open purifiers and don't mind if people take some stuff.  Also my living space and workbenches are open. Best guess would be the lockpicking.
---
I bought mine from a vending machine for 3500 caps
---
Low level players can help. If they bring a shotgun and enforcer perk, or a cryolator they can help alot. Did a few sbq last week got alot of repair kits Wich is nice
---
 After all the commotion about it, I had a close look. I like the Duster from the store better, its better camo.
---
 It makes the guy look down on his luck, and it needs a tailor to fix the tattered parts.
---
 I have been wearing T Shirt and Slacks for most of my 98 levels. Got a Wolf Fedora from some guy, it replaces my Trilby.
---
Yeah I see the asylum uniforms are big right now. I don't really understand why though lol
---
Where did you hop for him? I‚Äôd like to hop to try &amp; find sir bot
---
I take the approach that if work benches, cooking stations and indoor areas are accessable without unlocking anything then they're fair game.  I don't take items like fruit, vegetables or water from purifiers as who knows if the owner is waiting on them.  
---
Also, if I cause enemies to spawn nearby I do feel obligated to take them out rather than let them tear apart the camp.  Just wish others would do the same for my camp.  I never had an issue before the vendor update.  Now I'm always repairing.
---
I know you have a laptop, but on a PC build, a decent video card can make up for an average system. These high end cards run systems great at 4K resolution, but if you're ok with gaming at 1080p an RX570 is sufficient (go better if you can afford it). A decent AMD CPU cost sub $200, at least 16GB ram, and don't skimp on a decent power supply (around $75). That whole setup with a case can be had for around $600. It won't be a high-end gaming rig, but will play Fallout 76 smoothly.
---
I think the problem right now is a lot of things are focused on PVP and assuming everyone plays on a team. Now, I just throwing this number against a wall to see if it sticks but I'd assume 90% of the players go at it solo. There needs to be more focus on single player content. I mean look at the failure that is Arktos Pharma.
---
[I believe so, yes.](https://imgur.com/a/afB10OD)
---
r/foundthemobileuser
---
Try to clear out any enemies that spawn due to you FTing someone's camp. Leaving them alive will usually result in the camp being damaged and the owner having to cough up resources to fix it.
---
I'm pretty sure that some players would love a true hardcore survival mode, but the PvP survival any battle Royale are things I will never try.
---
It does happen from time to time. Sometimes you can find the body by using your camera and looking around until it is highlighted in the corner.
---
It‚Äôs pretty easy, really. Don‚Äôt buy overpriced crap at the vendor bots, farm for your own needs, sell the extras. Tons of stuff dropped by mob can be sold for good amount of caps, from chems to weapons to masses. 
---
Bethesda isn‚Äôt balancing the game, it‚Äôs a forced socialism where nobody can have more than x amount of asset. This is literally shooting themselves in the foot because when people play more they tend to spend more in the atoms store. Those who play 20 min per day won‚Äôt pull out their wallets and say ‚Äòhey let‚Äôs buy that spanking new mushroom hairstyles, for the 20 min I play I can show it off to the strangers I run into‚Äô
---
I've got him twice...no coat, but click plans. Question - is it worth having a Responder uniform handy if the Eyebot spawns (the one that tells you to sod off of you're not a Responder)?
---
I live on a mountain so if they spawn them out of the building space they will die...
---
Nude and handmade... 
---
I see what you did there.
---
Some ini tweaks with DOF will make underwater clear, but I dont know the exact ones.
---
I have not a single idea as to why you're getting downvoted. 
---
Oh, now I get it. Sarcasm. Very hard to detect in the written form.
---
\[CAUTION\]
---
That's easy.  Put it in your vending machine for a ridiculous price.  I'm still waiting for a sucker to buy mine for 10000 caps.  Otherwise it's just there to rub it in the face of player that haven't gotten one yet.
---
Stone bench???
---
So is NW confirmed to be battle royale? :(
---
I don't think downing and reviving someone counts as clearing a bounty - they literally have to kill you.
---
I'd say proper CAMP etiquette mostly consists of:
---
* If there are monsters around, kill them.
---
* Close any exterior doors you find open.
---
* Don't picklock or try to force your way into places that have been blocked off.
---
Personally, I don't pick plants or take water unless it's clear that it's there for taking (like having a Vault Boy pointing at it).
---
For my camp, use anything you need. Close the door on the way out.
---
Its propelled by steam and the ammo is an item not a bullet. Just asking mate.

You've failed to accept my friend request. Is it GuardianCat0 or just GuardianCat? I waited 1-2 hours for you. I'm going to play something else and come back in a moment.
---
dense chest + lvl 2 fireproof = immunity to car explosions, TSE weapon damage (explosive side anyways), scorchbeast screams.  
---
sorry ya lost your stuff, but why had you not stashed your flux as soon as you got it? i always stash important items or  stuff i am low on and farming for asap simply because i could glitch die/get player killed/accidently fall into a fissure and then have game crash before i can get back to body/bag.. happened to me alot through beta and first couple weeks of playing.   
---
been several times i have seen awol up as i am leaving a nuke drop and i still make it a point to go to camp stash anything found before heading to awol/imp sheepsquatch.
---
Speed Demon without Class Freak, perhaps?
---
I nuked the pumpkin house and got a ton of cobalt flux
---
Ws vendor ?
---
Charleston Train station. That little shack on the pond is usually where he spawns although I've seen him spawn twice coming up the hill towards the station from that road under the bridge. Be ready though, a ton of people put their camps there and it ruins the whole damn thing because he will not spawn there if there's a camp. Not that I've seen yet anyways.
---
I bought the duster too, it is pretty nice.
---
I think he always has the clock plans. He's had them every time I've seen him. The coat is a toss up though. Hmmm idk lol
---
And I have 2 keycards
---
That's true, but at the same time, not everybody knows (or cares) about the maximum value they can ask for things.  You may have a god roll weapon you want 20,000 Caps for, but I don't *need* it for that price, especially when someone around the corner might unintentionally or deliberately undercut the whole meta by selling it far cheaper.
---
The pie thing might be a joke or somebody showing it off. I got mine out of the freaking port a diner and was so proud of it I put it in my vending for 20k caps. I didn't actually expect to sell it, was just proud. As for the other stuff...I've got nothing lol
---
Hey now, just last night me and 11 comrades in arms attacked Arktos and it was glorious. Besides the 12 of us. 6 other randoms joined the event and let me tell you. It was utter and complete chaos. So much to kill that when the boss came in we crashed the entire server... 
---
What we need is better server stability over anything else right now and QoL's for bugs.
---
Yeah go to chairs in camp building and it is near the bottom, 2 little stone chairs.
---
Did you run yet?
---
I'd say it does, at least to a point.  As the other user said, I definitely notice a difference.
---
Not yet
---
Yeah I saw someone selling disease cures for 300 caps *a piece*, a two-shot fatman with 25% RoF (dead perk) for *15,000 caps*.  
---
I just rolled my eyes and moved on.
---
There is no way that Bethesda can't tell what percentage of players are solo vs on teams. I would agree it could be 90% solo, but why are they weighting development on multiplayer?
---
I only did the sheepsquatch imposter event once because it requires team cooperation and most people just ran around like headless chickens ignoring beacons. I haven't bothered with Arktos because I just don't care about multi player events.
---
They keep trying to force us to like multiplayer fallout, but do so with poor imitations of other games rather than creativity and imagination. 
---
It's not going to work without some revolutionary changes in their development thinking.
---
I know they added a few things to vendors like how Grafton TS sells BOS combat armour plans now, but did they add stone benches to WS? If so sorry for wasting everyone's time.
---
Bye?
---
Sounds like that person was a butt. At my camp people are free to take the plants and water. I usually leave a bag a freebies in my vending area. I have an open workshop area and a cow they can milk. If someone is just starting out, I try to give them some extra aid or armor. I try to be as hospitable to visitors as I would be irl.
---
If anyones wondering I prefer GTAO to this bullshit and will ne playing that instead because I actually have a chance in GTAO
---
"Hope springs eternal"
---
If you put something up, *maybe* someone will come along and buy it.  If not, no harm.
---
Honestly, it's a waste of everyone's time, but other than that it doesn't hurt to try for a payday.
---
It's also more than possible that the person don't really know the value of the items.  A fresh 50isn may not have seen many legendaries, and would overvalue it compared to someone who farms up 20-30 in a sitting.
---
Bye.
---
20 screws?????? Thats loot id kill for now.
---
Bye
---
Stash size? Nope. Not time for that. 
---
1) It will never be enough. You and your kind (the kind who can't manage inventories) will always want more and more. 
---
2) It's not even needed. Even with player vending. I already have to compete with 19 other vendors on other servers.  I sell drugs and bulk, it's my niche because I can't farm legendaries to the point where I have legendaries worth selling. 
---
All a stash limit increase does here is allow every one to sell alot of everything. So the people who come to my shop because the 7 people around me are just full up on weapons and armour? Now they don't need to visit my shop, because that guy has 56 legendaries and all the aid and mats you need all in one place. 
---
Camp budget increase? I'm on board with that though.
---
The only one toxic here is you, he playing the game you should do the same, anyways was system your on I would gladly take all your shit. Lol
---
Bye felicia
---
I think that's the consensus based on data mining, but I'll keep wishing it may be a hardcore survival mode (with heat and cold to manage) or something else.
---
Survival is broken. That's why I don't don't do it. Play in adventure mode if you can't stand survival.
---
I dont know ,but my guess is at the vendor that sells whitespring furniture and stuff
---
'bout your stuff - since you don't need it anymore - i would take it.
---
 I have bought 1* Legendaries for like 150 caps. Its all over the place for prices.
---
They should have made ‚Äúmultiplayer‚Äù like FO3 and FO4, it would have been better than what we have now. They should expand their ideas instead of following other ‚Äúmultiplayer‚Äùgames objectives with a fallout feel. It‚Äôs not it‚Äôs their first time with this ‚Äúmultiplayer‚Äùrodeo.  Maybe they should copy Anthems success and start over. I mean why can‚Äôt I play a ‚Äúmultiplayer‚Äù game solo? I feel I can rebuild the wasteland by myself better than any group can. I want to pvp with myself. Why can‚Äôt they try other ideas that allows me to do quest and pvp solo? It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs a single player game. I also want to mod the game because it‚Äôs too hard and I only beat 4 with mods. I want to mod it so I can build the bestest castle and everyone on my server will be nerfed but me. I‚Äôm just gonna rant that what I want is a ‚Äúmultiplayer‚Äù game that I can do solo, instead of waiting for FO5 or giving them an avenue of trying something different. Peace out.
---
That's probably because you just kill noobs on your mk2.
---
When will u be a available today?
---
No.
---
Cool, when you thinking? PSN onepompousa55
---
 I never close mine. ;)
---
I think it's silly but that's just me lol. I just don't think they look good enough to justify how expensive people are selling them for .
---
Picking the lock. If there‚Äôs an open area, you‚Äôre welcome there. But going into a locked private area?  Not cool.
---
I believe so yes.
---
I recently moved camp locations but was originally up near Vault 76, mainly to help out newer players. I don't ever lock things so I don't mind players taking food and water if they need it or using my house for their own needs. Sometimes I'll put up plans and other things in my vendors for 0 caps and have noticed some higher level players grabbing them all to resell. That irritates me a little since those are meant for newer players that'll actually use those things for themselves.
---
Aside from that, only other thing that really irritates me is when people go through my house and don't close doors behind them. Yeah, I don't lock my doors for a reason, but I also don't want enemies getting inside my house either.
---
I eventually opted to have no doors. :)
---
No kidding. But they look infinitely better to me than the hunters coat.
---
It's kinda rare because the vendor it comes from is a pain in the ass to find, and even if you do find him, the coat doesn't always show up. I've sold a couple of clothing items off for thousands of caps because people like to collect and enjoy showing off their hard-to-find items. Plus the Hunter's Coat is just a really cool clothing item.
---
Thanks alot!  I was thinking of getting a second piece on market and now i will!  Do you use Action Boy/Girl in addition to your two pieces?
---
He was probably in adventure mode but since he owned a workshop, passive mode wasn't enabled.
---
Workshops are PvP zones, it tells you when you claim one. He's playing the game as intended.
---
Im sorry people wont let you kill them
---
And i think that this is the best in our Community we have to tell so much storys becous we woud all do the same

If I hasn't taken off a couple of months, I too had played since day one of the BETA, I probably would be right up there with you. But I'm sitting at just below 500 hrs
---
I agree with your frustration. I'm not quitting because of it, I just don't claim workshops anymore so I can never get injured from other Players. When you own a workshop, passive mode doesn't apply.
---
Round about 700 since Dec 21st.
---
About a week ago I checked and bought the last few plans I didn't know from there, I'll check later today when I'm online, fingers crossed!
---
Just do as many events as you can, you'll be swimming in stimpaks in no time.  Alternatively you can farm ticks and put on Chemist + Super Duper, craft their blood into blood packs and then craft the blood packs into stimpaks.
---
There's a big difference between thinking too highly of yourself and being able to know when you are making claims or assumptions about things you're not knowledgeable about. 
---
I've never managed a huge triple A online title spanning three platforms. So I don't pretend to know how fast or easy it is to fix things, or what issues arise and how they'd prioritize them. 
---
Not talking out of your assistance when you have no experience with what your talking about is not the same as thinking too highly of yourself. Nor is assuming people will suddenly magically start listing relevant "experience"..... This is the internet.... Where everyone has done everything and has "experience"
---
They are only available on Graham and it‚Äôs rng as to whether he‚Äôs carrying them when you find him, he pitched up at the munitions factory and had the stone benches and gamma gun plans on him at the same time, I felt like I‚Äôd won the lottery lol
---
Not sure what you mean by ‚Äòit can‚Äôt be addressed forever.‚Äô I‚Äôm not requesting infinite content here, rather more than just purchasing serums once you reach the end-game (which even by itself is kinda pointless now as they‚Äôre cheap at many player vendors). The Enclave vendor was a huge miss in this regard; that was the perfect place to have expensive, elite weapons and unique plans, instead we got a very slightly reskinned plasma rifle. Expanding Modus‚Äôs inventory would be a natural way of supplying endgame cap sinks. 
---
Yes, within time (some far faster than others, naturally) people will have bought all those guns and plans, and that‚Äôs when you release content *again*. The output will never be fast enough for certain players, but for the rest of us it‚Äôll be a vast improvement on what we‚Äôve got now.
---
Again, pushing your own ideals isn't going to change reality. It's not a small group, almost all high level players (let's say 150 just for the sake of it) I've met are swimming in caps and legendaries and are just begging for something to spend them on. Calling people stupid doesn't make you any less wrong. I don't know why you feel entitled to have the best of the best without any work - granted, it's not even hard work to amass that many caps. I make 5-10k a week just by selling marine armor plans in my vending machine. People selling serums can make that much per DAY. It just naturally follows from economic law that more desirable items will be worth what they are. Don't even give me that pathetic "it's a video game" nonsense, you're here on a subreddit for the game trying to convince people to give you freebies. Doesn't matter if it's physical or not, it is still something of value that people want and are willing to work for.
---
Going to start running silo in about 10 minutes
---
I have a few pies for the bargain price of 9,999 I don't expect to sell any I just like having them there as a joke I sell all my plans and recipes at 10 caps and all ammo a cap a piece. Prices for some items are shocking but you have the choice whether to buy or not .
---
Happy shopping
---
I was having the same problem last night. It‚Äôs hard to tell in this game sometimes if it‚Äôs a bug, an intentional quietly-made change, or some weird-ass condition not being met. :)
---
People were using it as a quick way of leveling...maybe it got nerfed and they hit it a bit too hard?
---
I'm pretty sure he's camera-less if you've already looted it no?
---
Yourself included, Chief.
---
I have noticed people does not understand armor at all. I put 3 pieces of god rolled armor for fun at 99 caps . Many hours passed and nobody bought em lol .  I have bought 3* armors for under 700 caps and sold em on market for 20k each
---
It‚Äôs like ammo, if I sell any it‚Äôs at 1 cap each. If I bit, and I often do, it‚Äôs at one cap each as well. 
---
I‚Äôve noticed people gobble up treasure maps at 30 caps each and fusion cores at the same. 
---
Anything bloodied sells at around 150-200 caps even if it‚Äôs a hatchet. Assassins is like that as well. I‚Äôve currently got a full set of level 35 unyielding armor out in the vending machine at 170 caps each. 
---
My thinking is that, if it was me, I‚Äôd like to buy the whole set regardless of whether it‚Äôs level 35 or not because that doesn‚Äôt affect the +3 stats. 
---
I only price things high if they are unyielding three star, bloodied max level three star or explosive and then it‚Äôs at a maximum 2000 caps. 
---
My serums sell at 330 - 440 caps. 
---
It seems through trial and error that you are correct, the prices have stabilized somewhat.
---
One of the powered doors i imagine
---
I only have one character, haven't checked in a while but have roughly 400 hours. Got the game since launch but I took a large break between February and May
---
At some point you'll do what i did... start a new character and ONLY live in the Beta survival realm. It's different. I switch between the two depending on my mood. I feel they HAVE TO keep refining the game just to keep their name &amp; reputation at this point, so i look forward to many coming updates. It's already come a long way!
---
How so? I literally just stated I have no experience with it, and thus can't make assumptions....
---
Someone deserves to be handcuffed up and starved to death? While the captor sits and enjoys watching them suffer? No, mate, that's psychopathic.
---
Seems like you weren‚Äôt alone in that
---
if only those pressure plates wouldn't look so absolutely out of plane...
---
I thought I was the only one.
---
I wouldn't pay more than 150 for a 1*, it all goes into the scrip pile. I have bought serums for 500 before, but that was more of a convenience than a good deal at all.
---
That flatwoods monster has tried and failed to abduct me around 3 times now, it never fails either when I'm busy fighting a level 80 sb he will come out of the woodwork.
---
I suspected that Sharpshooter and Confirm grip still had that from FO4, but certainly didn't know about Forceful. Thanks for peering into the data to confirm these things! While you're there, could you find out if Enclave Plasma guns have any differences to the regular variety? I find it suspicious that the devs gave it a different damage increase that other patch ago. The Vault Dwellers guide also has them marked as possible Explosive type weapons (which they clearly aren't). Makes me think that there's some secret not uncovered.
---
appreciate the replies.
---
 so consensus seems was pretty much just my unknowing vandalism of picking that lock (to go uptop and help his turrets kill whatever they were shooting *i never did see what it was)
---
glad i asked cause i was timid to grab any fruit (or even visit other camps) after this encounter. 
---
thanks guys  :-)
---
Don‚Äôt suppose you have the dense mod unlocked for raider armor do you?
---
I cant remember where i got the stone bench plan , a white one kind of curved. May have been an event reward
---
Probably someone who doesn't prowl reddit and really doesn't know the value of things and are proud of their finds...
---
Don‚Äôt suppose you have the dense mod unlocked for the raider chestpiece do you?
---
Yes, it is.
---
Ohhh I get it. You make generalizations about the sub but we cant make generalizations about you, big guy. I'm with ya now
---
Absolutely not. It's just speculation based off some voice clips. 
---
And I mean speculation is never wrong in 76....
---
Cause look at all the loot crate style P2w lunch boxes I open every day....
---
Wow some players need to realise that their camp isn‚Äôt a real house. It‚Äôs a game and a low level player needed some food and water, we all know how tough it is at the start. The fact you‚Äôre only level 6 shows that this guy is just a bully. I‚Äôm guessing he was a really high level player as they normally are most helpful.
---
If you multiply DR by 0.25 (as in the Endangerol perk), that's actually a 75% reduction to DR. If you check the perk for Incisor 3 then you'll see that it does exactly the same thing. All the actual functionality of Endangerol is in the perk applied by the enchantment, which is fairly common with Fallout 76. The enchantment magnitudes are routinely ignored.
---
What I haven't figured yet with enchantments is how it decides whether the enchantment is applied to the target or the user. Probably in the flags somewhere. In this case the pip-boy status evidence proved that the perk was applied to the target.
---
It's a pretty long process lol. There's a couple of really detailed posts on Reddit about it though that I know.
---
And what about the AP Refresh Mod.  Is that the same think?
---
Thanks!!
---
I'm assuming the downvotes are down to ignorance, you don't deserve that for observing the lore. Reddit, eh?
---
this is also news to me. if i does, i know what im doing for a WHILE now
---
I would be perfectly fine with fast travel rugs needing a larger spot of open land around them and only being able to place them along the perimeter of a build zone.
---
They‚Äôre always one that‚Äôll fly over Morgantown airport.  Sort of a ‚Äúlook what you‚Äôll deal with later‚Äù fly over as your grinding your responders quest.
---
ITS ANOUT ERTHICS IN GRAMING JRUNALISM!
---
When did I say I want freebies and no the majority of high lvl players are not running around spending 25k+ caps. I don't want the items people are selling I have found everything I want in game it's not hard. The point is you are basing your opinions of the small minority that post on the reddits not the majority of players. Back to the original post the cap limit does not need to increase at all.
---
Unlocked water purifiers and resource extractors are fair game.
---
So are crops that aren't confined inside a locked area, but I personally consider it good manners to leave at least half if there's more than 2 of that particular crop, for other players and the host.
---
Locked doors are a pretty clear message and you'll also become wanted and targeted by the CAMP's defenses if you pick them.  This is also good to remember in workshops.  It'd fine to pick a locked loot box in an unowned workshop, but picking the same lootbox(even though the other player doesn't see the same spawned loot as you do) while the workshop is owned by another player will give you a bounty.
---
Enemies have specific spawn points which refresh when a player comes close to them.  They also aggro on either the closest player or an appealing piece of CAMP like crops, defense walls, and generators.  Because of this, another piece of good etiquette is to eliminate any spawns nearby when you're visiting or passing close to another player's CAMP.  This is especially important when you're visiting by fast-traveling or a Scorchbeast spawns.
---
The last is for CAMP owners.  Be aware of where you're placing your CAMP.  CAMPs can block useful spawns, namely event instance spawns and certain enemy spawns.  Before the CAMP damage fix, I had some people taking potshots at my CAMP and dealing slap damage to me because I placed my camp next to the Charleston station.  Apparently, it's a potential spawning point for the Protectron Vendor and other players were expressing their displeasure through breaking things in my CAMP.  Resource nodes are always a great indicator of where to place a CAMP without disrupting any special spawns, but you may end up sharing that CAMP position with others.
---
Just adds extra AP Refresh. They are different things tho. Powered is a perk, "Ultra-Light and Light" are mods you can put on the armor.
---
There's a few YouTube tutorials on it... lots of work to launch a nuke that way - thankfully they used a predictable algorithm. It's got something to do with writing out the alphabet, switching order, and using nuke codes from commanders to decrypt - beyond that much, it all goes well over my head to be honest.
---
From grahm only, the exclusive plans he has are that, metal picnic tables, kitchen tables, and the radiation emitter and the disco ball
---
Tbh I'm actually not sure mate. I have scrapped a tonne but I don't wear it.
---
I have leather, marine, combat all dense unlocked.
---
I sell recipes for 1/3 the game value, build plans for 1/2 game value, and armor/weps plans for game value [PS4]. 
---
So, most of my recipes are around 35 caps, build plans are between 50 to 500 caps, and armor/weps are from 150 to 1500 caps.   
---
I sell legendary weapons and armor at about 100 caps per *, plus a premium for mods that I‚Äôve added + a premium for Vanguard, Bloodied, Furious, Explosive, etc.  The highest that you would find in my shop are TSE at about 2.5K. Though, I don‚Äôt have any of those at the moment. 
---
My strategy is to just make some extra cash off of my store, empty my stash, and to give players with limited funds the chance to buy decent items.
---
It gets even better when you do all that AND run around in full unyeilding armor lol
---
you google this weeks codes
---
The difference is there's actual daily instances about the backseat programmer types posting about how easy they think this stuff should be....
---
You're generalization is based off of what? The exact opposite of a thing I clearly admitted to ?
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox. I acquired a raider chestpiece but the effects are just too good to pass up. Could you maybe take a look at it and tell me what you can do to it?
---
Treadly teaches us resolve... and the zen of repetition. You're learning and you aren't even aware of it - thats how we measure his genius. Enlightenment, one probiscus at a time....
---
Like I said initially.. Like a commentator, Tator.
---
Would be nice to see something along the lines of skyrim/eso where you can choose your race of character, so like vault dweller, raider, Bos, goul, synth/robot, all with there own benificial perks, and negative ones.
---
Now put on Stranger in Numbers, get a mutated teammate, and see how high you can jump!
---
Sure I could of u wanted mate
---
The White Spring is one of the better places for that. The Burrows is another good one. I bet West Tek wouldn't be terrible either.
---
That's happened to me numerous times with feral ghouls or the other day I killed a legendary and it had a ts lever action possibly more than one star don't kW cause my game crashes before I could pick it up
---
Well, ill be going out here soon for a few hours. Id say around 7 i should be good to go.
---
Ahh just saw this. I got the plan at the watoga vendor mate, like a couple days ago. So it's back in the game if even very rare
---
Other than using a different damage table (three points higher across the board for the enclave version), I don't see any difference in base stats. FO76Edit isn't very good at exposing base weapon stats though, so I can't rule much out.
---
WhiteSpring
---
I can check west of 76 as well I love scouting around the map. Thanks for the offer but please no pressure to follow up I was just curious. I really like the way that you took that photo and the others.
---
Ah that makes sense! Thinking about your response, my first "real" camp is also high on my favorites list despite the many that have followed being objectively "superior." Personally, I would have taken advantage of that water glitch and built a trap for fun. "Give me all yer' booze or drown!" Unfortunately, I've also experience that glitch on more than one occasion. It seemed to happen when you placed a stairway going into water (I'm not sure) which I don't think is possible anymore but I haven't tried it for awhile. I've actually been avoiding building much lately (my favorite thing to do!) because the camp building adjustments have been increasingly frustrating to me. No longer being able to put certain objects slightly into rocks or on top of rocks for example (without something like a coffee table placed first) has put a real dent in making things look more realistic. Anyway, I expect those issues and the others are temporary.
---
Thanks for the guest house idea! Previously, my "multi-occupant" camp designs have been more communal in nature. I hadn't thought of having a guest house in the builds that aren't designed for use by multiple occupants or as a pit stop during or after farming something. You might be able to use 1 or 2 turrets and/or traps to fend off those that would destroy your camp. But, of course there are also plenty of places to build where you can use that budget to instead build a larger camp by taking utilizing nearby neutral guards or just being inaccessible.
---
You are most welcome! I really enjoyed reading about your experience and the accompanying photos so much so that I felt the need to let you know. I think we are of a similar mind when it comes to building. I too quite enjoy FO4 and I still play it.
---
Be safe and have fun!

Yes Agi/Action Boy/Girl rank 3 is a staple in all my character builds so far.
---
I mean, the other Scout Leader is always calling me a Tadpole Scout.
---
I'm not a Tadpole Scout!  I'm definitely at least a Possum Scout and I have the badges and backpack to prove it!
---
...Got a glitch in your programming or something.  \*pouts\*
---
Ok I‚Äôll just message you when I get home from work around 6pm cst
---

---
You could build your camp to accommodate where travelers "arrive" as I did. Its always the same place and always facing the same way.
---
Thanks ill keep checking.
---
Mmm yeah probably
---
Bloodied + swing speed + reduced weight/+1 stength is the most OP combination for the right build (unyielding bloodied melee). I have a bloodied SS deathclaw gauntlet and completely set up right it does 3000 damage.
---
I've been thinking about it, and a battle royale mode could work if they did it right. Imagine a mode where everyone starts with with nothing in their inventory. No weapons, no armor, and no perks that increase damage or defense, but everyone knows the plans for crafting everything in order to level the playing field. The zone is filled with tons of junk and crates full of random material and ammo, and benches are randomly spawned at various locations. 
---
You spawn in and have to start scavenging for materials. Do you go with something quick and easy to craft, or do you risk running around unarmed while you gather enough to craft a bos recon rifle? Meaniwhile, a deadly rad storm is slowly encroaching, pushing the combatants closer together. When you kill someone they drop everything, so when it gets down to the last few players they'll presumably have an arsenal at their disposal.  
---
The winner gets an assortment of "high end" junk like flux and ultracite, a rare article of clothing, and a rare plan of some sort. 
---
If they could balance it so that the match time was 20 minutes or less I would probably play the hell out of it.
---
hoes mad
---
I see... Can you see what it can be tagged as in relevance to perks and buffs? Anything outside of possible Rifle/Pistol Semi/Auto Ballistic/Energy?
---
It's a game mate. Don't be so feeble. Just do what everyone else does and send naughty messages filled with N words, and then report them for cheating or briefing.
---
What a chimp.
---
1* bloodied are worth maybe 3k. Realistically anything else is just people over selling them and hoping idiots who dont know the market are gonna pay more, which they are. Inpatients will make people money but thats not their actual value. Just last week i bought and resold 13** with bloodied or furious buying gor less than 2k and selling for 2.8. Made my cap in 2 hours, went around buying legendaries terrible 3stars for scrip for the week. Your market is either terrible.or you dont know what these things are worth or you are trying to promote manipulative prices from the sound of it.
---
In a bit, dogsh*t!
---
There's a load in time anyways, they can escape. You might get a few but it's not going to work well imo. You can already make them spawn by placing the camp and building from there. Strange how the owner spawns in a different spot though.
---
Passive interaction works better. Like that trap at wes tek, it's set it up so you run to the top of the dish. There's a wall so you can't jump into the dish, but if you zoom in with a scope on the ground it's really nice. They put a switch next to a door. You assume it opens but it triggers a spike trap instead, you ended up falling off the top or (if bloodied) die. They even put cheap mats in the vendor half way up for recycling.
---
Another high percentage trap is a loot bag in a high traffic area, greedy guy comes to see what's in it. Greed traps used to work [so well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ctKLawX_co). Vending changed a lot of this. Most can see any traps before the walls load in, so you should build levels and distractions. Have structure on both sides of the spawn. It's all a lot of testing to see what works, more like an art project. If marsupials can jump or anyone run out of the kill as it spawns, you probably lost a vending customer, as it all spawned right in front of them. If it looks sketchy as hell, no one's going to fall for it.
---
My favorite, I accidentally created one day. Built a locked door and put a fusion generator behind it with windows so they can see it, without any wires attached, decorate the inside using matching items you'd see around. As long as the walls and door are 100%, it looks like part of the game. I've had guys level 80 fall for this. They don't even think and pick the lock for the core.

Screw this African warlord crap.  I want a Slocum Joe's Skin for my handmade.

(Camp budget is full, otherwise I‚Äôd put in a guest bed, too.)

Resources:
---
I have a small adhesive farm - (thedude - thats Tato, mufruit, corn) - while I don‚Äôt mind if you take some if I‚Äôm not there - 
---
if I am in camp, I may not yet had had the chance to pick it to make adhesive.  To that end, ya, if I‚Äôm in camp, might be nice to ask.
---
Same with water purifiers.
---
I also put a manual water pump by the stairs leading to my first floor, so if you need water to cook, use it
---
For whatever reason, not everyone uses a mic.  I run with it set to area.  I find it much easier that way.  
---
As you found out, picking a lock at a camp is bad form, and leads to no good end for you.  
---
BTW, wanted status means anyone on the map can kill you, and there is a cap ‚Äúreward‚Äù taken from you.  
---
Might have tried to team with you so he could warn you you had to be killed to ‚Äúpay‚Äù for stealing from another player (its a game mechanic), 
---
Likely, he downed and revived you to show he wasn‚Äôt simply being a bad guy.  
---
Then killed you because if he didn‚Äôt, someone else eventually would.

Dont let things get you so upset...same with anything in life.. not worth it
---
I've already been considering the experience of a third character in survival mode. I've never been much for the PvP part of the game, but I feel like I'd be doing the game an injustice by not at least trying it out.
---
The energy weapons generally don't have a base type that matters aside from WeaponTypeEnergy. Perk usage depends on the stock and the barrel, where the stock determines rifle vs pistol and the barrel determines automatic vs non-automatic.
---
The Enclave Plasma Gun's mods look like a copy-paste of the standard plasma gun. Standard &amp; Bruising grips are pistol. All others are rifle. The barrels with "Automatic" in the name are automatic. All other barrels count as semi-auto, even the flamer barrel.

Some of us know how to build and would enjoy a camp increase. Sadly the majority build fuck ugly camps.

That would be great, but I think maybe a year after release may be too late.

When I took the photo of the base I had totally forgotten to place my turrets and the rats chewed right through my fusion generator. Lesson learned there! I actually had more issues with a horde spawn down the road taking cheap shots at my stuff out of turret range and got tired of repairing it. That combined with the molerats was just enough for me to move to quieter pastures.

Thank you for sharing that! I was totally in the right to do a charge back on my CC for a refund. All the horror stories on this sub just reenforce my decision. Much appreciated!
---
I'd eat up 10% more in seconds! People say about server stability, but someones CAMP won't load for you unless you travel to it - so having a bigger CAMP wouldn't make that much of a difference. I'm sure we could get another 20% at least without any issues.
---
At level 200+ I have been killed after taking a workshop a total of 1 (one) time at that Junkyard Workshop and I had seen that player chillin' for no reason really at the lookout tower nearby so it was my own fault when he sneaked in a TSE one or two shot in the back or head while I messed with the workbench.
---
I just walked away once I re-spawned ignoring him as I had no chance against a god setup. I'm on PC so maybe that explains it, more squeakers doing the 'Fortnite' on consoles perhaps?
---
Just stick with the game if there are aspects you enjoy and avoid the workshops unless you have thoroughly specked out the server world players you are on with. I find the ammo factory complicated to set up, did it once just because but Fallout 76 enemies bleed ammo so I've no reason to take it again.

He already knows Nukacrypt (The website that shows the code) works, but he wants to know the process as well
---
Wait, can one have more than one mutation at a time? I've only been using marsupial because I thought if I took another serum, it'll cancel out marsupial.
---
Weird I got a friend request and accepted it and waited an hour or something like that. Maybe you did send it to the wrong account. Tough it is spelled ‚ÄòGuardianCat‚Äô
---
I have 400+ hours into this game and this is my only truly bad experience with another player. Its really not as bad as everyone says. Its buggy but its gotten to the point where it's about average as far as other fallout games go terms of bugs. Honestly if you can get it on sell its worth a try.
---
Happened to me last night.  Melee player - coming in from the SE side of WS.
---
saw a glowing one running away from the golf club to the back side of the tennis court.  
---
Went for it.  Got swarmed by that one and about 7 others.  I‚Äôm fighting the mob...I hear the silencer....then the cars start exploding,..
---
Thats one way to tag the mob....
---
- fortunately I had enough health it didn't kill me (I‚Äôm L92 in PA w/ fireproof1).
---
Dust settled, and here comes an L70 to check out the dead...
---
I suppose its possible the shooter didn‚Äôt have good aim, but still...
---
what could go wrong?
---
And another thing... If they want to copy other games, they should get inspiration from 7 Days to Die and The Forest.
---
Only have one character also.  Clocking in at just over 450 hours and level 104.  
---
Have done main quest, all side quests and most daily and events at least once.  Just earned my Tadpole badge on Friday.  Haven't really started working on my Possum badge in ernest yet.
---
Can I use that title for the name of my first sex tape? üòÇ
---
GTA Online + Fallout = 76
---
Nope. They stack
---
That‚Äôs just... so freakin awesome.  I could imagine having al regions in big posters, framed and mounted.   
---
Amazing job, bud
---
Go smell your own farts somewhere else.
---
Yeah even when I can‚Äôt loot body‚Äôs in plants, have negative billion cap item https://youtu.be/5iLFi--Fsx8 and have polygons were flashing everywhere on my map screen I still continued on the but my friend now refuses to play it even though it‚Äôs better now https://youtu.be/wExHRQn93r8
---
You can have as many as you like, some are more useful than others but you could run around with all of them if you wanted to
---
I'd also like to know
---
surprising there isnt a multi hit melee card..
---
Is your sex tape going to be in a video game?
---
Play the game
---
I feel ya, the wires and the ugly pressure plate really kills the look. It would be nice if we had those pipes that could go through walls that Fallout 4 had. The strange thing about it that the pipe connectors are in the game, but the actual pipes arent.
---
Ah yes! Nice. But i'm just disappointed that none of the Pistol Grip mods increase the Pipe-bolt's condition.
---
true, but they can atleast make it so that turrets don't auto target nearby passerbys. Literally, I've had my weapons away (appearing as yellow dot) but i would still be attacked by camp turrets im not in conflict with.
---
It‚Äôs like an adorable puppy you love dearly, that keeps pooping in your shoes. 
---
I want to shout at it by I just don‚Äôt have the heart lol.
---
There's not that many bugs now. The worst for me are the ghouls at White springs that stay in sleeping mode but still move, that said it's bleeding hilarious to watch and makes it more of a challenge to fight which I like. 
---
I've not really come across game breaking bugs, and for me at least crashes are quite rare.
---
But still glad you're enjoying it üòé‚ò¢Ô∏è
---
and theres no way to defend urself other than running away?
---
ikr
---
Standing ovation for that babysitting comment. Holy shit, online gaming the last decade smfh.
---
Communist Poster plans are actually **Anti**-Communist posters.  Just FYI.
---
You are definitely entitled to your own opinion. You are not wrong because I can see where you're coming from. But on the flip side, i can see someone fresh from the vault not using them because they need a to enjoy the game first. I'm level 154 and pretty much done it all and now it's time for some fun! I think mutations, well multiple mutations, in a way is an end game thing anyway.
---
The blueprints never worked for me either. Some used to build on a 1x1 and then above to get around that, but it looks so bad.
---
Erm.....   yes.
---
Hahaha, you feel me üëçüèª
---
Idk, I personally like the game it is now and if nuclear winter adds PvE raids that‚Äôs enough for me to enjoy until wastelanders
---
But I‚Äôm also easy to please
---
Yeah I still play fo4 daily just to fight gunners and raiders that are actually a bit challenging. 
---
Then I come back to fight schorched that just stand there doing almost nothing. It's sad and I honestly don't know why they removed so much intelligence from npcs.
---
I assume to help the game run or be able to be played by a wider group.
---
Are mutant hounds rare? I've seen a bunch of 'em.
---
Play events, explore and sell as much junk as you can carry lol
---
Lol everything im doing now basically
---
They fucked it up, but obviously a hot fix to remedy another fuck up on their behalf is more important lol.
---
Are we absolutely certain that that is what is going on (that the magnitude is simply multiplied by the DR)? The multiplication would make sense but only if it is a factor of a larger formula. For example: DR - (DR \* m) where m represents the magnitude. I need to learn a great deal more to piece together formulas from these files.
---
There do indeed appear to be ENIT - Effect Data, Target Type records/flags as you mentioned. After selecting an "Ench" prefixed EditorID, if you filter (in the right pane) by name "target" and check the box to keep children you can then select the various "Ench" prefixed EditorIDs to see the different Target types. So far I've seen "Self" and "Touch." "EnchSyringer\_Endangerol" has the "Target Type" value set to "Touch" currently. Of course, you could also use a top-level filter or script to do a more exhaustive search.
---
Thank you for your assistance!
---
 The PC version work quite well.
---
Kill enemies and sell there weapons üëç especially super mutants. I have a few locations I will visit daily (Westek etc), wipe out all the enemies, get over encumbered and then sell all the weapons and chems etc for my daily 1400 caps. I'm at 22k caps, never go below 20k routinely. I can get 1400caps worth of loot using this method in about 45 minutes or so.
---
Obviously you get loads of XP, legendary spawns too so its win win.
---
Oh wow
---
there isn't an AP refresh mod you can add to regular armor. There's one that gives you extra max AP, that's light/ultralight. Power armor has a couple AP-refresh-ish mods you can add.
---
 You can get it to fight, but it still flies off.
---
Like I was saying earlier my alt is a craft build ammo to PA, hence the reason I need more space because I'm full of bulk junk and stuff I have built to sell.
---
I run my stash on a razor thin line of what I can hold.
---
An increase would relieve pressure and better service to my customers.
---
I was like this when fallout 76 came out just listened to the youtubers, media, and rage wagon and automatically assumed the game is trash, then January hit and I couldn't stop thinking about how there's a new fallout and I haven't even touched it.
---
Looked around Ebay until I found the price I was looking for to buy it, fell in love and proceeded to buy the rest of the full price in atoms because I felt it while flawed it was good and would get better, and I was right.
---
It's really good but it doesn't have newer stuff like the Greek letters or possum tent
---
Mines is in the same location, i also managed to place the floors through the water tower. Looks nice
---
Hey OP, any update on this? You get to finish it?
---
Really? I‚Äôve got daily crashes, especially in nuke zones. üò¢
---
Xbox sucks?
---
Bad news, I'm pretty sure they patched the thing where Scorchbeasts were affected by Hunter's.
---
There's gotta be a strategy descision involved with why there is no skin for the most popular rifle. I cant figure it out though. Guys have played the game for hundreds of hours and quit already. Whats the hold up?
---
I can tell you rn there‚Äôs way worse games out there lol I think Anthem might be the worst I‚Äôve ever *tried* playing 
---
It kept crashing on my super PC. At least Fallout 76 runs haha
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bvevvj/is_there_an_item_i_can_craft_with_minimal_effort/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
On PC I've experienced crashes but not that many. Definitely not every session. The worst day for me was a month or 2 ago when it crashed out maybe 3 times in one session. That's it. Maybe it's a server thing and I get lucky.
---
I'd like to see the "Gold Cards" actually be something special, like cost 1 less point to equip or something along those lines. Would bring some excitement back to lv ups once you had all of your main cards.
---
Even before this bug, did you go into a room, especially at whitespring, and catch a ghoul standing around. Then, suddenly, I guess sensing you‚Äôre there, they immediately get into another position; sitting, lying or crouching, Like they‚Äôre actors on the Freaking Truman Show. Lol.
---
Do the main quest. Fort defiance has a suit on the 4th floor I think
---
Advertise on 76 market. See if somebody bites.
---
Happens to me all the time, with scorchbeasts as well. Oddly enough I‚Äôve had the bodies spawn at my camp on occasion.
---
Lol, not seen that happen, I've had scorched do weird stuff kinda like that, but not exactly that.
---
A bunch next to a Behemoth? That's where they get you.
---
Also there are spawn locations for armour. Pick one of these locations and server hop until you have all the pieces you need.
---
 How would I know?
---
Haha, just kidding üòÇ
---
+ goat legs = no (or low) damage jumping from the top of Seneca Rocks.
---
Your legs will still be broken for a minute though.
---
But it will.
---
No I have no solid info. But so far each bump in stash space/build limit. Has been small. And just like vending machine, your display will be tied up in your stash. For a few reasions
---
1. If it's tied to your stash, no one can walk up and take it.
---
2. Have to limit what can be displayed by a simple mechanic that won't cause lag/instability in the servers.
---
As it looks from my rose colored glasses. You will be able to use either a display stand ( max of 4) or an air stand ( max of 4) or a combo of the above, but each have 10 slots tied to your stash.
---
And I would not trust Bethesda to not introduce a bug in them where you items can be removed via an exploit or duplicated. But we will see when they release it. As of now I have not seen any info on release
---
Really. The ghouls do that a lot for me. They‚Äôre like, ‚Äúoh shit! Places everybody. Places!‚Äù Lol
---
It's an acquired taste for sure. It's got many problems but I still enjoy it. Other than the Resident Evil remake for a couple of weeks when it came out, this is the only game I've played in a long while.
---
Hahahaha I really wanna see that now ü§£
---
But muh immersion!
---
*heals broken leg with a stimpack
---
Fort defiance spawns a suit as does fort venture will spawn pieces. The vertiberd in Watoga has PA that spawns there regularly that will have T-51 pieces.
---
Yeah FO76 is bit addictive
---
I like this alot
---
A whole week, dang.
---
I FINALLY found a tameable animal. Level 16 bear. It didn't even last 15 minutes. I was trying to follow it back to my camp to be sure it made it, but we ran into FOUR level 45 glowing wendigos. :(
---
No such luck here. I've waited, I've clicked, I've server hopped. She still expects me to start the whole Key to the Past quest line over again. And, sauce for the goose, I can't go to the 2nd level of Top of the World anymore... crashes the game, every single time.
---
I hafta believe someone at Bethesda is at least embarrassed by all this... at least a little, right?
---
Don‚Äôt fast travel half way across the map will safe a ton of money.
---
In the workshop. And it should be 10 steel.
---
It's funny that most people only read the title üòÇ
---
Sell things to other players, buy serums cheap and sell them back to vendors for more, don‚Äôt get scammedüòÇ
---
I'm going to grab lunch, but as soon as I get back, I'll add you and give you this Vampire's All-Purpose Axe I found.  It's only worth 5 scrip to me, but to a new player, the decent two-handed melee paired with a regenerative effect should be invaluable and carry you easily through at least level 30.  IGN shiningQuasar
---
A few thousand thumb downs made by angry costumers that don't agree with vendor pricing and jealous players that don't have a nice camp?
---
According to your logic you should never apply for a job, because there is a possibility that you can get fired. Are u trolling?
---
Are you some kinda stupid?
---
I watched videos on camps, how to find items, how to do quest, theories, and most importantly I watch Juicehead (top Fallout 76 YouTuber who gives info).
---
I even heard of exploits from players on and off the game, I read about it through articles, and oh my favorite one of all is right here in Reddit.
---
So as I stated before I never searched for them. I only watched that one Youtube video yesterday when it showed up as a notification. Reason why I watched it because I talked to a player along time ago about us squashing these exploits because of them ruining it for us.
---
Morgantown airport hangars - the ones around around the cargobot pad.
---
 Take stuff and sell it. Its slightly more complicated but not much. 
---
 Drugs are everywhere, I only use Radaway, Radshield and Stim Paks. I sell the rest. All weapons have value, either as scrap, for various reasons, or you can sell em'.
---
 Many found foods have value, I cook my own for my consummation and sell the found foods.
---
 Try to grab enough crap at the places you FT to pay for the trip. Its good practice and can train your looting if you pay attention. 
---
 I have no serious things to buy at this point and my normal practice keeps me in the 2000 cap range most of the time.
---
 Now if I need money I farm places where lots of stuff is. Wes Tech springs to mind. ;)
---
How about you go into your CAMP, build a huge bridge to nowhere, over the vast river of flowing tears...and get the fuck over it!
---
Yeah, some are sore losers. Once I saw a wanted guy and ft near him. I saw him talking to a vendor so it was the perfect chance for me (maybe a bit of a coward move, but hey, I‚Äôm a stealth sniper, it‚Äôs all about killing while undetected, right?) and shoot him, first shot didn‚Äôt kill him so he starts looking for me, second shot, he‚Äôs dead. I wait for a while because he didn‚Äôt respawn right away, so I ‚Äúleave‚Äù, his body disappears, and I collect his stuff and leave. Next thing I receive a friend request from him (I block messages from people I don‚Äôt know) and in the message he says something like ‚Äúkid, what‚Äôs your problem?‚Äù . Lol, he assumed I was a kid? I‚Äôm in my 30s. Hey, if you don‚Äôt wanna get killed, the first thing NOT to do is getting wanted.
---
Wes Tech Springs?
---
Sorry no I've only gotten the quest a few times to show up and everytime I was either busy or finishing my session so sadly it's still hasn't been completed. But I will def post a response as soon as I'm able to complete it
---
Lol, I had one fall out of the sky at my camp the other day.....no loot.
---
Its the price we pay for server based games.
---
Those pies are PERFECTLY PRESERVED... Well worth those caps :)
---
Grinding steel seems live a very good way imo
---
A really simple and specific solution would be to have a new way to report a griefer who does this.
---
Set up your travel matt in a kill room? Get a player complaint. Get enough complaints, get banned from vending. Super simple.
---
Theres always a bite.. Or rather a sucker born every minute.
---
I really do not wanna know how much real world life time I wasted in this game.......
---
Need to go outside now....
---
I run excavator in a nuke zone.  Have 1 perk that radiation restores some health.
---
Pop a radx-x when you first start hearing the Geiger tick.  
---
Radx, rad away, nukacherry as needed after that.
---
Probably still AA for most purposes. With sneak attacks + Tank Killer + Perforating it won't give full value against squishier enemies because you'll hit the damage = 6.5x DR cap, but those should die fast anyway.
---
Executioner's doesn't work out well numerically. The best cases of three-shot or seven-shot kills would take the same number of shots with AA. It's particularly weak against legendaries because of the HP regen.
---
The break-even with Furious vs AA is at about eight hits, so Furious is good against the bullet sponges but that's about it.
---
The dumb thing is that Bloodied at 75% hp is better than AA, even without Adrenal Reaction.
---
I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs true...
---
There are many individuals that you simply won‚Äôt cross path in real life, because of who they are and what they do. The beauty of online gameplay is that it cancels all physical distances and bring all kinds of people to your doorstep, a good reminder of the world we live in.
---
Behemoths are rare, and behemoths spawning with hounds is rarer - the challenge is to take a photo of both of them at the same time.
---
Literally just bought these plans at a lvl 120 guy‚Äôs CAMP for 75 caps. Gotta keep looking!
---
 The game is kinda crammed into the consoles and nerfed a bit to fit into what they can do.
---
 I'm sitting on a new machine a Ryzen 2600 with 16G of fast Ram, a I TB Intel SSD in the M.2 slot so direct to PCIe, not SATA, and a GTX 1070. 
---
 Its very nice indeed as the game is no real challenge to the hardware.
---
 I suspect from many posts that the network is not handled as well as the PC, but that's just a guess, albeit an educated one. This is the eighth PC I have built.
---
I'd rather Bethesda find a way for us to be able to build CAMPS next to each other so that we can form little trading outposts and possibly the start of pocket communities, especially since LadyDevann already confirmed that they're working on a way for us to join our last played server.
---
You actually need some things in bulk you need like minimum 200 of all the good stuff and probably around 100 of the useless stuff having only 20 of anything is very very low if you need to get something it‚Äôs better to have an excess than to have to go out and get scrap for every little thing
---
Does killing same person 20 times count?
---
Appreciate it. Literally just attempted it, had to Google and stumbled across this post. Haven't played since shortly post release, I honestly thought they'd have worked more of the bugs out by now.
---
I've got gadgets and gizmos a-plenty
---
I've got whozits and whatzits galore
---
You want thingamabobs?
---
I've got twenty!
---
But who cares?
---
No big deal
---
I want more.
---
Thanks for sharing this!
---
Holy shit I'm excited for E3.
---
I hope so too.  Would love this to be a PvE mode, a combination of what you stated along with diablo 3‚Äôs.... I can‚Äôt recall its name, but where the game hit you with swarms of enemies while it was testing you.  I guess a horde mode?
---
You know it's not the same.
---
Most of the stuff you listed is what's needed for armor or weapon repairs. And holding only 20 of it isnt anything. Especially if you're active in the Wasteland.
---
I wouldn't go to Modoc if I were you guys...just saying...
---
Good find. Thanks.
---
I'm pretty optimistic about the future content for the game! We should get a megathread or a discord going during the presentation so we can chat about it while its happening.
---
Been looking my friend, ever since the possum challenges started. It‚Äôs been a slog. Actually, I‚Äôm not sure what will happen if I ever find them. My life might lose all meaning. Lol
---
Screws, aluminium, springs, adhesive are some things I'd never want to have less than like 100. All the other stuff seems to be in every second building.
---
In the article it says the full episode will be published on June 4th, which means there may be more to this so keep an eye out!
---
let me guess, you are lvl 9 and play 1 hour a week
---
Thanks for the idea
---
Could you point me towards this please?
---
Don't forget the 105mm lense... The more specific, the more "fun"
---
 The Cooking Stove works fine. There are 2 that don't. The Wood Stove and the White one, I forget its name. I went through all three. ;)
---
id be okay with a stash upgrade system, pay either caps (or atoms if Bethesda wanted to go that way) for a 100 at a time upgrade for your stash box. those who need more stash space can upgrade it, those who do not won't. the upgrade could be per character (if caps) or per account (if Atoms)
---
Pioneer scout with Ranger hat
---
oh really? i didn‚Äòt know. is it under appliances? i‚Äòm not in game right now.
---
I wear the green shirt and combats, faschnat beret, backpack and shades when I‚Äôm meeting people etc, the rest of the time it‚Äôs the bos hood, engineers outfit and plague doctors mask lol.
---
Yeah but repair costs are terrible and they sometimes use weird scrap and crafting armor uses the useless stuff too
---
well, the very best price you can get it from the vendor is 700. So immediately, sell value would be around 1k (gotta make it worth your time). Add in the rareness factor, and you can at least double that. So 2k would be a typical minimum. But the price goes as high as the market will bear.
---
If you're active in the waste all the stuff I listed is lying on the floor next to you. But yeah 20 is a bit low I was just trying to make a point about keeping heaps of something because you might "need" it some other time is a silly concept.
---
It's better to have it and not need it, then need it and not have it
---
Fort defiance, Bos outposts in cranberry bog, and some old military bases. The best is if you can find someone selling it for 1-2 caps per piece
---
 Me either. The Red One in the Atom store is a skin for the Cooking Stove.
---
 I think appliances, but I have not fooled with my CAMP much for months.
---
But on a serious note, I used to agree with you.
---
 I still think people with the marsupial mutation are annoying af constantly bouncing around like idiots...but now that I realize how much of the map that is normally inaccessible is opened up with marsupial, I would never go back. 
---
 IMO Marsupial is worth it just for the tactical advantage of being able to reach so many more elevated positions.
---
id hate to be that guy, but just don't die
---
Swimsuit with sun hat
---
Yup, it's bugged. I don't know ANYONE who's completed it.
---
That‚Äôs totally unconfirmed
---
In any other instance I'd agree.
---
At this point every player is one Google search from finding an in world location for this stuff.
---
If we don't want to do the grind, what does it really leave?
---
I know it's supposed to, like at monster Mash, if you die, it counts down 3 seconds and auto respawns you inside the high school. But some events it doesn't always properly register you as in the event, and you have to manually respawn, and it puts you outside. I've seen this at uranium fever and project purity, and at powering up power plants.
---
Anyway, it'd be nice if you died indoors, if it let you respawn indoors anyway, regardless of events. Stuff like nuke silos and the Burrows are super annoying having to run back in if you die.
---
I'm 217 and play daily, which is why I wonder why so many people complain about weight.
---
Y'all still got previous Fallout Hording Habits.
---
I tell you what I wouldn't pick.
---
A rifleman build without Tank Killer.
---
Sounds op
---
Watoga has like 5 spawn points for PA. There are like 7 in that section of the map iirc.
---
Check the roof tops ;)
---
True, but I am nit running a rifleman build.
---
Well done. I hit 250 today, coincidence.
---
I'd like to see a shared stash across all characters.  Shouldn't have to create mule accounts.
---
I'd rather they make vendor and stash different ones. Other wise the limit of item sold per vendor makes no sense.
---
but still, making the ovens work in places like bunkers etc would be nice for cooking on the way
---
Sheepsquatch mysterious fur scraps into ballistic fibre, ammo bags and military grade duct tape too also scraps to it
---
And that seems... less threatening?
---
Vault-suit.
---
Well for max dmg you will want 12PER, 3x commando perks and tank killer, if you dont want that much PER id value tank killer higher. Atleast 3LCK for bloody mess. Demo expert does effect explosive but its not worth it, I however still run lvl 1 demo because its 20% for 1 point and effects grenades.
---
I find PA perks overrated so INT would come down to do you want to farm less cores and repair less often? 
---
Then theres blocker(str) and fireproof(end) which are good for most builds.
---
Agi seems pretty meh for PA but being said I have it maxed so I can fly further.
---
Stinging then, I think? I am not sure if perforating or stinging gives better armor pen. Mind me asking what you are trying to do with the HM on a non-rifleman build though? If it's just tag a load of stuff in VATS (or outside) then damage is kinda a non-factor. Curious.
---
Wardrum is fun to use and typically has high damage, but even w/ swing speed perks, can be too slow for certain enemies.
---
Also depends on the variant for bonus damage.  IIRC the troubleshooter version based around 150ish, with +30% on robots.  IIRC, modded with spikes, pushing 200 base damage (without chems or other buffs).
---
Thanks!  I'm going shopping now!üòä
---
*crying* oh wait no
---
1900 hours
---
Yeah the same thing happened with me today. So many liberators which made farming legendaries super easy! There was one bugged out one which kept giving me a different crappy legendary every time I took one off of it
---
Which is why I got a refund lmao not gonna lower the weapons performance to make it look how I want
---
yes we have, scavenging is a big part of any post apocalyptic fantasy. Why do we even have limits
---
Me too! When I sit back and think about how much has actually improved, and the wide range of content that they've added to the game over just 6 months, I think there's plenty of reasons to be excited and optimistic. They've done a lot of unexpected things, and I look forward to be surprised again.
---
A megathread would be great! I'm sure that every Fallout related discord will be lively during E3. It's gonna be a great time!
---
I know but that‚Äôs not always possible
---
Wow. Rude.
---
Nope buddy. Im talking about the vendor system being broken for 1 cap items. I sell all my ammo for 1 cap, but if someone buys a few hundred you only get a couple of caps.
---
I'm just not interested in challenges or events at all, so I'm not playing.  PvE raids would be great fun, but also not original.
---
Space suit. You look like a dweeb in it. Especially if you pair it with the tin foil hat or any of the robot heads except sentry bot.
---
Found robot armor of varying types at that rail car between Watoga station and NAR repair yard fyi
---
i love people like you.
---
Tedd wants to know your location
---
thanks
---
Two chatacters, was at 560 Thursday night, probably closer to 570 now.
---
I thought the counter in game was for the whole account not individual characters?
---
I have 10 mutations and they all work fine
---
I am using a shotgun/melee/heavy weapons build.
---
But I dont like wearing PA all the time except when needed and I find using heavy weapons without PA looks really silly so i got my self some nice rifle.
---
Mmmmm bacon
---
Yeah. That‚Äôs one of spots I hit every time I change server.
---
I‚Äôm level 150+ and day to day stash management wasn‚Äôt really an issue until I started running 2 builds on the same character. Now an extra bit of space for my second load out equipment would be amazing, 200 would be far more than enough.
---
Selling stuff like lead and plastic. You're probably a lower level, being as you just started on PC? Go to Point Pleasant and harvest those Mothman Eggs. Get Super Duper ASAP. Make omlettes, that's around 300+ caps a day, and takes like 10 minutes. You're gonna get tired of the Flatwoods Fertile Soil event, but it's fairly decent for exp and caps early on.
---
 I hear ya. :)
---
Need a fourth floor? Place your camp device up higher to raise the build ceiling limit.
---
Go for a Nuka Cola build (2* Cola Nut) and you can get rid of all those pesky chems almost entirely! And free up 3 points in STR by dumping Traveling Pharmacy!
---
If you don‚Äôt want to travel around too much, check the militairy posts around the whitespring bunker entrance. Mostly I can get around 8 bf from just checking there.
---
Yeah, that's what I thought. But I couldn't be ABSOLUTELY certain until today. Great. Can somebody tag a Bethesda Reddit account so this bug might finally get patched? I' not sure how to do that.
---
Erm.. I do get shot at a lot?
---
 You kill the cute possums? You monster! ;)
---
&gt;Recipes seem to have stabilized at 50‚Ç¨
---
The sweet spot for plans seems to be ~20-25% of their list price, so 20-25c for a 100c refrigerator plan, or 50-75c for a 250c deep pocketed limb plan. I sell all my food recipes for 10, and they seem to move in spurts, but fast enough to justify keeping them for sale.
---
&gt;What's the value of bulk glass?
---
Here's my guide to junk vending (I sell a shit ton of it):
---
* super common mats like wood, glass, and steel get sold for .5 caps each in bulk form, so 1 bulk steel or cloth (30 units) is priced at 15. Bulk glass or leather (15 units) is priced at 8.
---
* more desirable/less common bulkable things like aluminum, adhesive, and copper go for 25-30. 
---
* things that can't be bulked get sold for 1-3 caps, depending on how easy it is to farm them. Screws? 2 caps because you have to actually hunt for them? Nuclear waste? 1 cap because I'm swimming in the shit from killing glowing enemies.
---
The only things I sell for more than that are ultracite scraps for 5 and ballistic fiber for 10, both of which seem like fair prices given their list price and difficulty to acquire.
---
&gt;Ive had some truly useful armor that was only 1 star, but good stuff, priced to sell at 300, and no one buys it! 
---
This is tricky. Low level characters are often hurting for cash, so the thought of spending 300 caps on a random 1 star legendary is insane. By the time you're at level 50 you've probably got your own mish mash of assorted legendary armor, so you're hunting for 2 or 3 star pieces that are upgrades to your current set. 
---
The only 1 stars that sell for me are really desirable and/or rare combinations like unyielding scout armor pieces or weapons with uncommon effects like quad capacity. Even then, I price them at 250-300 and scrip them after a day or two if no one snags them.
---
As for the 10k preserved pie? I put one in the machine at that price and it sold, so I put another one in there at 20k along with a snallygaster spit explosion for the same price. They're joke items, but if someone wants to buy them more power to 'em I guess.
---
Good point i guess still needs tweaking
---
Btw perforating gives 40% ap while stinging gives 20%+10 round mag
---
Sell your purified water and craft a ton of Marine Helmets (sell for around 30 caps each)
---
Nice. I guess I was talking about you! Congrats on 250!
---
Agree I was Streaming just second ago til I saw this and 100% agreed increase Camp and stashed box and make a Junk Box Too
---
Stay in stealth while in your workshop and you'll get a lot less PVPers since they mostly only bother travelling if they see you on the map.
---
scam traders
---
Without tank killer I'd compromise and go with the stinging mag. You get 10 more rounds than perforating at the expense of a bit of armor pen.
---
Lol 50 caps is nothing, everyone remember losing 200 plus ? 
---
Also workshop opens you to pvp. You should know this by now. The only thing to do when someone kills you at a workshop is to server hop , don't fight.
---
What? The DLC roadmap literally says new story, quests, and factions
---
nope you get 6 camera paint jobs..... enjoy
---
I heartily endorse your previous tank killer comment bit it ain't always about maxing out. .I never use my best guns...its just too easy...I usually run with something im only partially specced for or a combat rifle with an auto .38 receiver on it to nerf myself a little.
---
Grind your way to 17.5k caps and buy a popular mutation recipe. Craft the serums, sell 2-3 per day at the vendors for 450-500 and sell the rest in your machine for 300-400.
---
Central east coast - been teamed with some folks living in/around Mexico City.  But...they spoke fluent English.
---
 You buy it in various places. The Whitespring is one.
---
no, as far as i know. since you are still unarmored. but fair warning. if you attach a prime to a .50 cal machine gun you cannot remove it
---
A cooking stove that uses wood should function. Those that use electricity or gas probably won‚Äôt unless connected to a power source. Camp stoves should work if you add gas.
---
I'd go perforating even w/ tank killer unless the gun is AA but that's just me.
---
Saying it‚Äôs going to be ‚Äúall questing and story‚Äù is speculative. We don‚Äôt really know what that dlc is going to be. It could be a 30 minute quest tying into a kart racing event. It *seems* like it‚Äôll be a ton of story content but don‚Äôt state it as factual and confirmed info
---
What is blocker and fireproof?
---
It would be great for clearing places like west tek as a heavy melee build though.
---
I agree on the scrap. You really don‚Äôt need more than 20-30 of most things at any given time. Think about it, if you have a lot of something it‚Äôs only because you don‚Äôt actually use it. 
---
However, one man‚Äôs trash is another‚Äôs treasure. I sell 1* items out of my vendor for a couple hundred caps all day long. People find different things valuable for their own reasons. I might not see any value in a 1* hunter‚Äôs handmade, but somebody else might. Maybe they just want a handmade, so why not grab one with a bonus? Maybe they‚Äôre collecting them. Regardless, many sell. So why would I just dump them? Even if the don‚Äôt sell, they get traded in for scrip, but you can only get so much per day. 
---
I like offering a lot of variety. If I had the space, I‚Äôd fill all four vendors with legendary items.
---
[Scroll down](https://imgur.com/a/3ZhkLJl) to "Powered Gates" and I believe it's the one on the far left.
---
No, that is fair. You can find the pies in the world without even playing the vending machines, they spawn in set locations. When people charge that much they don't expect others to actually buy it, it's a display piece at that point. There are some players who can afford that price and will buy it for fun; but the pie spawns in vending machines where you can gamble your time for a possible reward or you could head to one of the static spawn points in the world. Most vendors know what they're doing, and are appealing to a richer player than you are. If the sight of gear that you cannot buy engages you please be aware that every player has had the same chance to find the same gear based on the amount of time they spend in the game and how active they are in events and quests: if you want to buy other people's successes from them those players are entitled to judge how much the item was worth to them and to balance that with how much they think people will be willing to pay (players can gather 1.4k caps easily and even more than that if their shops sell well). If this isn't fair to you then there are thousands of other vendors who want your sales
---
See that's the thing, it's forcing you to make difficult/interesting decisions. 
---
It's not just saying "Hey guy, you can do everything, and be anything with 0 sacrifices! Doesn't that sound like tons of fun?"
---
And it may seem like fun at first. Then it gets old real quick. Everyone can do everything. 
---
Bo-fucking-ring
---
I like that I decided to play a trader. I like that I had to make that choice of what I was going to deal in because the stash won't let me sell a ton of everything. DonI go with a little bit of everything? Do I go with a lot of one or two things? 
---
Do I craft and sell thus limiting my selling space?  Or scavenge and not have to worry about storage being eaten up by mats?  Do I visit other vendors to try and find cheap deals and re-sell? 
---
More stash space means every one can just sell a bunch of everything. It means you get less specialized traders. No variations. No niches. Boring.
---
Which is why it would be op. You‚Äôre heavy melee build is already strong af and perfectly fine to clear any area of the game
---
Join team so we can clear silo
---
 My guy in T Shirt and Slacks uses Combat Knives. Looks evil. ;)
---
Nah, it's fine as it is.
---
For sure. Mine runs around in power armor with a swing speed sledge and all the ranks of martial artist. I‚Äôd trade the speed for AoE damage in a heartbeat though.
---
I wear the manta man costume. I love it.
---
I was literally just thinking about this
---
Gotta fix my stash first real quick
---
Why tho? Ppl will just complain its not enough when they hit the new limits. Sell your stuff
---
I've been straight up spamming friend requests for a guy named GuardianCat. Not spamming, but about 10 adds. I've been expecting for you to add me. Whose requests have you accepted?
---
I totally forgot about the various speakers. I have used them to warn me when my doors are open/opening via pressure plates in the past but this is a much more interesting way to use them!
---
You can get all ultracite PA plans by using the terminal in fort Defiance. That‚Äôs how I got mine.
---
But that‚Äôs the problem. You probably one shot most enemies as it is. This would just be one shotting multiple enemies at once. When will these people be satisfied with the difficulty? When we look at enemies and they all die instantly?
---
Three hits for a super mutant warlord.
---
Much appreciated, I didn't know the numbers :)
---
We were promised cap sinks. Beth delivered.
---
I think the camps need bullboards like the ones at Scout camos, so we can put posters and messages on them.
---
They were the same in FO1...
---
1) If it's unlocked, have at it. 
---
2) Crops are free game, they're instanced so you picking them deprives me of nothing. 
---
3) Close the doors behind you, you were raised in a vault...not a barn. 
---
4) Respect private spaces.  I have a private area so visitors don't have to wait for me to get my thicc ass off the workbenches.
---
5) Tips are cool, if you really liked/appreciated my c.a.m.p. please feel free to donate a nuka cola to the cause.
---
6) You spawn it, you kill it.  It's only polite, and  Fusion generators are expensive to repair.
---
Honestly, it's as good as reason as I could have hoped for :)
---
Arizona has some crazy ones too, not orange but brown and dark. You can find this pic of a giant dust wall if you search
---
Doesn‚Äôt change anything nor take into account the people nearly one shotting scorchbeasts
---
*I AM THE STASH BOX*
---
Food build. Obv.
---
I think that's an entirely valid opinion, but of course not everyone is going to agree with it. I personally think in a game where there's all kinds of mutated things, and as much radiation is around, it's totally in the realm of probability to end up mutated, and not having a single mutation after hundreds of hours in a toxic dump is unlikely. Realism in games like this are always so different from person to person; I don't think it's very realistic that I can carry 400+ pounds of stuff, and literally tens of thousands of rounds of ammo and chems. That I can go up against a Scorchbeast and barely get scratched. So realism? eh, we tossed that out the window when we booted up the game, imp. 
---
For me it's kinda like how I am with PC games in general. I start out totally vanilla, beat the game, then start modding it to see how you can make it better. Mutations are fun as fuck, especially marsupial with Stranger in Numbers. I'm here to have fun. 
---
At this point, playing on a lower level alt that doesn't have mutations, and even going back to FO4 (which I am also currently replaying, have over 1400 hours in), not having marsupial is WEIRD AF. I feel like I'm tied to the ground. I can't even jump over small rocks, it feels so weird and limiting. 
---
But.. to each their own. If you're having fun, that's what matters.
---
I'd love to have a real storage box since I'm constantly filling up the stash box with junk aid items that i dont use. But your idea of having people steal from storage boxes would make more sense in PvP instead of in PvE.At least that's what i think
---
For 1
---
There is a behemoth spawn south of Solomons pond in the savage divide. I've farmed him a lot but never saw hounds there.
---
It's for balance reasons. Would be op if you could build a floating base. It would be safe from ground enemies, and if you initiate pvp you would have an unfair advantage unless the other guy has op gear and mutations.
---
BEFORE YOU USE them, make sure you don‚Äôt have starched genes equipped or you won‚Äôt mutate! Also rad x cancels mutations for the time its in effect
---
I agree that it's not about maxing out. The game is easy enough that there's huge room for flavour builds, and I love making them :)
---
sNeAk AtTaCk x 2.o0 dAmAgE
---
It makes a huge difference. I have 5 pieces along with Action Boy 3, Rejuvenate 1, We‚Äôll Tuned and different types of food and I can full refresh 280 AP in around 2.5 seconds.
---
I haven't been able to find a spot with a cliffside view that also has water within camp building range. The best compromise I found was to build on the cliff just west of Solomon's Pond. You can slap some small purifiers down in the dirt for slow, steady pure water production, and the pond is a 30 second jog for times when you need a bunch of dirty water to boil/cook with.
---
There are only a few different common perk operations, and the usage is consistent. "Multiply Value" is just a multiply by the constant, while the Endangerol enchantment just applies the perk and changes nothing directly.
---
The other common method is that the enchantment uses the "Peak Value Modifier" function (for example) to add the spell magnitude to an Actor Value, and then the perk uses the function "Multiply 1 + Actor Value Mult" to do the actual adjustment, which does V = V \* (1 +  av \* const). This is normally used in cases where multiple effects can stack. I'm not sure if actor values can ever be negative, but the constant can be, in which case the effect is a reduction. Check out the STAT\_\* perks for many examples. Tenderizer is also a good example.
---
Amen brother!
---
Change servers
---
I do this on one character (carnivore herbivore excluded of course)
---
I do wish there were some alternatives where being "clean" had at least some advantage.
---
When it comes to releasing new games, I think they have learned their lesson the hard way.
---
Although, many Fallout fans seem to overlook Bethesda's releases by saying that it's normal for Bethesda and this is nothing new. Or make sarcastic comments to forget how low quality product Fallout 76 were during its first few months. This kind of unconcerned reception, at least did, put Bethesda in a position where they were able to continue releasing untested and unfinished games, because they could get away with it. Now, maybe it's no longer the case for their future content, and they really have a motive to fully "bake" their games before releasing them, as they have lots of reclaiming to do in terms of reputation and integrity.
---
It's good to remember how much better, more stable and richer in content the game has become, thanks to a really awesome 100-days. If this current game build was the one in November, Fallout would have received immensely better reviews and even more fans. However, I'm sincerely super excited for all the new stuff that's coming out very soon.
---
It's the price per cell minus 10 percent fee.
---
Sounds like one of the appalachian weight watchers
---
This started happening to me yesterday, but only on silo charlie. I dropped from the other two just fine, but 3 times in a row I crashed going down that elevator. A hard reset on the xbox seemed to fix the issue, but I haven't tried yet today.
---
To the hreo of the day, my hat tips to you.
---
He's on his 6th... 3 resets and 7 crashed...
---
It seems like you are telling me how I should play the game.
---
Thanks Walt, now it‚Äôs stuck in my head.
---
You launch yet?
---
Happened to me last week. But after I swapped servers was ok. Try having him load a mule, then go back to his main.
---
Why do I need fireproof?
---
My assaultron head just lost its bloodied perk as well):
---
I'd love a "reach your camp" or vault or safe zone challenge .... I have so many other games for a battle royale
---
Thanks for this thread. I'm working on level six. Maybe I'll visit someone's camp now that I know some etiquette. Hope it's not the first guy you met though.
---
It‚Äôs fine as it is. Pay attention next time.
---
Hes done a few soft resets, will try that and post results soon.
---
Fallout 76 Rule # 1: Don't die
---
Fallout 76 Rule #2: Don't die while carry precious junk
---
Fallout 76 Rule #3: You got contracted by rad worms
---
I have a 5 tier camp now lol.
---
Amazing! I love the scenery :D
---
So is that a 3x3 base? I've been trying with 2x2 and taller
---
Leave server. Problem solved.
---
It's not for balance lol. They've royally fucked the building system. Nothing works like it did, and it wasn't great to begin with.
---
I see so many beautiful and creative camps, and I always think they'd never be able to recreate them since the patch that ruined building.
---
TL;DR: Baiting and trolling children into suspensions is the only part of this game that works.
---
-10/10 would get children suspended again.
---
I agree I constantly scrap and sell whatever I can and usually only 500/800 but I would like a even 1000. The camp budget definitely needs to be increased because I was near max with my little mansion but then had to remove a bunch of extensions so I could make it seller friendly. Also I think it‚Äôd be nice if things in your vending machines didn‚Äôt count towards stash space.
---

I love watching them leave and land!
---
It really do be like that
---
you forgot #4 you contracted bone worms
---
You can get every mutation at once though you can only have either Carnivore or Herbivore at one time.
---
No is tree pnt six fyv if u spec
---
lol nab
---
Awesome, sent a friend request, feel free to message on here or discord (Cybercop#1700) at any time.
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs necessarily easy mode but I agree that‚Äôs part of the rpg side of things and I think they should improve that not diminish it
---
Good to know that it's a bug. Sad too though. I was just on a server that it was double nuked and I couldn't get it. :'(
---
Mate how the fuck are you being downvoted?? I love and play this game a lot but VATS melee being unable to hit flying enemies, stealth only working when you're the only one attacking the target, camp building becoming incredibly glitchy since Patch 9 and becoming stuck in a foundation when fast travelling to someone's vendor are just the tip of the iceberg.
---
Kotaku are pretty lame 80% of the time but your comment above speaks nothing but truth. No point people trying to hide the state of the game otherwise these things will just be brushed under the carpet and forgotten about.
---
I don't see why not- it should record everything the player sees and hears no matter the chat status (in game team or area, or ps4 party chat)  
---
and my sleepy self should have been more clear- he game caches 15 minutes of gameplay at all times (length of time can be changed by the user) and you can save it permanently at any time
---
It's especially nice for my Unarmed build.
---
They're hard to get from the machines. But there's two that spawn in the world (that I know of) in sort of hard to reach places (unless you have marsupial or a jetpack). So I guess they're technically rare, but if you server hopped you could start a collection of them. Every now and then I do a sweep of Wes-Tech and its been up there every time. People don't seem to bother to jump up there and grab it lol
---
Lever Action Rifle is a top seller
---
Have plenty of trapper plans, not sure if the robot plans are still there. Have like 150 plans in stock so maybe.
---
It seems like you're hold hundreds of pounds of useless crap.
---
There are still a lot of people that don‚Äôt seem to understand that the price is per item either, which is causing some difficulties. I saw a guy selling 45 ammo for 450 caps, he had 3000 rounds. Clearly he was trying to sell the lot, but didn‚Äôt get it. Even after messaging him, he still didn‚Äôt understand.
---
I see your point, I think stash size should be dependent on Camp size, level, etc.
---
Something to strive for, not something given.
---
That would make sense hence if your a mom and pop store (low lvl) to a corporation (high level).
---
Or maybe increases in vendor sizes based upon sales  obviously the more sales the larger the market size.
---
Food for thought.
---
That's because some fallout wizards are capable of getting a mutant hound to follow them from Huntersville. 8 of my 11 attempts, it didn't want to follow me that far, and turned around halfway there. 
---
The last 3 attempts, it just vanished into thin air, like poof, gone!
---
I also tried luring it as far as I could, then kill it as it starts to run back, and then used explosive weapons to move it towards the behemoth. But again, it just disappeared into thin air in all of those attempts, so I have never been able to complete that challenge.
---
Yes but unfortunately I lagged out
---
Omg yes please!
---
Same thing happened to me, although it wasn't two hours. The really annoying part is that you can't just name the communist without evidence second time through. I'd have expected otherwise in a Fallout game :P
---
plans, but i sell them inbetween 15 to 50 caps
---
just a basic crafted one or legendary?
---
Well ya but I'de have to convince my friends to play 76 again :P
---
There is also sometimes a spawn at bog town. But thats not the point lol
---
Sounds like you‚Äôve tried
---
Horde Mode would be cool, but it should be as another separate mode....maybe in a arena-style DLC like Moxxi's Underdome from Borderlands....hosted by the raider bot Rose maybe? haha
---
In Division's Survival mode, patrolling enemies were an obstacle that you could avoid, or risk engagement if you really wanted their supplies. I think it would work better instead of just sending out a horde - make this mode truly focus on making tactical choices.
---
Leaving in 5 minutes
---
We're too casual for mules lol
---
25k on one account and we're all happy as hell
---
Yes you can
---
There seems to be an over abundance of trapper, marine, combat, etc. plans. Never new robot plans were so scarce.
---
Might be worth running one thru the vault, just to see if it works

What a baffling ignorant person lmao

it is quite possible! because i‚Äôm an imperfect person, and i never noticed that.

Nah Xbox unfortunatly, plus I'm like real paranoid. So I generally am incapable of trusting anyone I don't know in person. It's a hindrance 4 sure, but I is what I is.

Interesting our boy didn‚Äôt respond to this one üòÇ
---
Buffout and disease cures seem to sell well.  I don't have a whole lot put in though.
---
Sell items at low costs is more likely to get caps. I would sell purified water for 4 caps max.
---
My support character wears the Responders Paramedic outfit. 
---
Seems to get the "I'm here to help" message across pretty clearly.
---
I came here to ask about it too. My wife plays on an xbox one and has no issues, I'm using a one x and can't fast travel to events or use elevators without crashing to the dashboard. I tried sites charlie and bravo, neither worked. I also crashed trying to elevator into the arktos pharma event. I deleted all the save files from my xbox and the cloud, that didn't work. I also uninstalled the game and reinstalled today, same issue. I'm hoping the next patch fixes it. Is you friend using a one x or a normal xbox one?
---
Post made me wonder about that because I do seem to find trapper plans constantly, they still tend to sell though but I price things to go quick.
---
Yes I have, in real life it‚Äôs called The Greenbrier and I went there for the golf tournament there they have every year, The Greenbrier classic. It‚Äôs a beautiful resort if you ever come to the US and visit WV I highly recommend it. I‚Äôm so glad you find West Virginia so interesting and beautiful. We‚Äôre a small state but it‚Äôs beautiful beyond comparison

Last of us, God of war, horizon, I hear the most recent assassins creed is good, rdr2s regular mode is apparently very good, that spiderman game people loved, zelda, doom, days gone, sekiro. Those are all single player games, also all in the last 2 years and the ones I can think of off the top of my head.

Serums sell very good but I just started selling bulk lead probably sold close to 50 of them since yesterday maybe 60 caps is to cheap.

They could solve a lot of peoples stash problems by assigning realistic weight to guns.
---
Then you realize there is always a "god tier" no matter how shitty it is, its just in relation to the rest of your choices available.
---
I think thats a cool suggestion. I would have it work like the fermenter for alcohol. Some alcohol can be used right away, while some other (lead champagne, nukashine) can ferment into Vintage versions of itself. 
---
It could be cool to have the same done with some meats (oven-baked mirelurk cake, pumpkin pie, etc) and it could give a small bonus compared to if you just made it the quick way, like it maybe lasts 20% longer, or gives 25% extra food.
---
This is why the Survival servers are so fucking great. I've lost count of the dudes I've iced, taken a hefty amount of their scrap and then melted into the countryside nearby, never to be seen again. There's nothing quite as satisfying as burying a dude when he fast travels home and merking him before he can deposit his loot.

Some people dont want to realise that someone can like a game and still express negavive opinions about its current state..
---
But i dont know what the end goal of cussing and downvotin everything that has something negative about the game. 
---
So they want a broken game that delivers subpar quality because customers attack anyone disapointed by lackluster delivery?
---
I dont know how someone can deny that taming is a pretty half assed feature and that the game needs a lot of work
---
My CAMP has a dedicated vending area that can be powered down and closed off when necessary, from a terminal inside my personal space. That area is locked with a keypad and powered door, has all the amenities inside for when I just want to be left alone. Also helpful if I jump into survival, because the room is totally inaccessible from the outside. There‚Äôs not a pickable lock anywhere.
---
With that said, I also have an open house with two beds, unlocked crops, water and a junk extractor, along with a separate workshop area with all the benches. All of that is totally open and accessible to everybody.
---
yeah, first time i saw it, during the beta, i shit myself... what a game!
---
check when I'm on later.
---
Serums (all of them), stimpaks (everyone seems to price them high), 5.56, plans, shielded under armor, x-01 calibrated shocks, x-01 jet packs. These are my top sellers.
---
That is a massive issue.
---
Why does a shotgun weigh more than a cannon that should be mounted to a ship? A Minigun is less of a burden to carry than one of the most popular assault rifles in the world...
---
Yes you watched a video. What dont you understand? Youtube suggests these videos because you watched a video in the same topic! Its a feature not a bug
---
I agree but maybe not in the way that you expect. The opportunity cost for having so many mutations with both Lck/Starched genes rank 2 and Lck/Class freak rank 3 doesn't feel high enough IMHO. Maybe they are intended to be that way? I'm not sure. All I know is that to me it feels like the disadvantages of not having them far outweigh the disadvantages of having them.

Is there any chance that you or anyone who happens by this post can check in-game if you benefit from [Swamp Tofu](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Swamp_tofu) while having the herbivore mutation? It's listed under the meat category in the cooking crafting station but it gives 0% food with carnivore. You can get a decent amount of swamp plants in and around the river [just west of the Dyer Chemical](https://imgur.com/a/JU799Tn).

How about instead of a story they make PVE challenging. PVP is the only challenge left because the mobs are all easy to kill, SBQ and imposter sheepsquatch aside. Even those are sleepwalking events. I want to fight mobs that are levels 200+ and present a challenge.
---
Build a box around the it, only go in to harvest your loot, and get out when you're not harvesting. It's not that hard.

20caps per stim? No wonder why no one buys them... , is a great system about the wanted thing. I can claim a workshop and lock my extractors and if someone locks pick them i dont have to wait for him to contest my workshop ill just kill them on the spot. Same with my camp i lock my purifiers and some doors for my generators. If you are in desperate need of water just ask , don't pick my lock or u will die. And the generator is for enemies they can't open locked doors. Is not for you to figure what secrets i'm hiding in there.
---
I hate to burst this bubble but this is in fact a bug. I‚Äôve had the camera turn away like that is several random locations and I think it‚Äôs something to do with the geometry.
---
33 cap one star armor....bulk steel at 7 caps doesn't last long either.
---
I know, it‚Äôs more like a ‚Äòstore there at your own risk‚Äô approach instead of a broad increase of everyone‚Äôs stash. That way people can put non important stuff there, such as temporary food and water or lower value junks. If they get stolen you won‚Äôt lose sleep. Of course if people pick locks they risk PVP, possibly for nothing but spoiled fruits.
---
20 caps is too much. Even before player vending came out I was buying and selling stimpacks for 5 caps a piece.
---
I can't stress this enough. You have to price things to move, not what you think you ought to get for them. Those kind of prices are for semi rare stuff, or an amazing 3 star or legacy item. Not something as common as stims. Just saying.
---
nice, i forgot a about selling x-01 gear. how much u sell the shocks and jet pack fo
---
I don‚Äôt want battle royale but I want better survival. PVE in this game is not event a slight challenge at this point. If I die it‚Äôs from another player or my own laziness as I sleepwalk through mobs. Give me more fights with more people.
---
No. But I am correct nonetheless.  The vendor dulplication method did not cause server instability.  It did not cause server crashes.
---
Updoot so Bethesda sees this my dudes.
---
You're doing good work Imentet, thank you  :D
---
Apecifically during the Crash Course event, it will come in, circle the airport for a while then fly away.
---
It's a pansy though, it spawns as neutral, but unlike other neutral enemies you can't make it agro, and the very first bullet you hit it with will make it fly away early.
---
Sorry you‚Äôre having so much trouble. Please open an actual support ticket with Bethesda. 
---
Have you tried hard-resetting your console? Make sure that when you start 76 you are launching it fresh and don‚Äôt ‚ÄúResume‚Äù. Good luck ‡≤•_‡≤•
---
Great, another instance of things not working the way they should. Good work, though.

I'm not sure if this is happening to others, but the game sometimes fails to show me what item was bought from my vending machines, just the caps that I earned. I sell just about anything too, but I'm guessing that my best selling items are prime plans and ammo. I think I sold a lot of super stimpaks before, but I'm reaching 80 stock right now, so I'm not sure if I was lucky or people are no longer interested in them. One thing that I know was a big seller is technical data, too bad I couldn't keep selling it once I reached the BOS questlime on my newest character.
---
I don't know about it being "fair," especially since it is a static spawn anybody can get, and yes it enrages me when I have a 45 hour a week job and kids, and when I see little shithead joey who is 13 and running around selling god tier gear for 5k+ when he hasn't done a damned thing to earn that duped shit.
---
Seriously 5k+ for one weapon?!?!?! ONE weaponü§î I've sold dozens of weapons and they are all priced fairly. 100 caps to 500 at the most for a GOOD 3* roll...
---
I'm pretty sure my weapons will kill any old thing about as well, especially after all the nerfs?! How are these things still this much? 200 hours and I have yet to even see an explosive weapon outside little Joey's hands...
---
I'll buy disease cures all day...and .38 ammo but that's been scarce lately ü§¨
---
&gt;Twisted muscles 
---
What about ones like Eagle Eye and Egghead?
---
I personally leave my purifiers unlocked and then have people leave their spoiled food behind as payment as indicated by a sign. Free fertilizer for me to bulk and sell passively to the vendors, and free water for them.
---
Yep they also have one arm up in the air now as if they are giving a speech like leaders, when you get closer they remembered their current incarnation are ghouls so they jump back to ghoul poses lol

True. 500 lbs of flux. Fortunately stash holds 800.
---
Damn we are a needy and demanding player base..
---
Specifically that it‚Äôs an assassins, with that secondary, only the assassins prefix does this, same with poisoners and... something else
---
Rare plans, serums, and rare crafted items.  I do fairly well selling, adjusting prices as needed.  If I‚Äôm around max caps, I‚Äôll randomly buy ammo if it‚Äôs 1 cap each.  I found as long as you have these conditions met, you should sell everything very well...
---
1- Variety of inventory.  If you have most of all types highlighted, more people will visit.
---
2- Quality of inventory.  If you have level 5 pipe pistols, and your camp is in cranberry bog, good luck.  You need to sell good excess chems, legendaries you don‚Äôt want, uncommon or rare plans, etc.
---
3- CAMP equipment.  This may sound funny, but it really does help.  Make sure you have a stash box, and workbenches available.  If anything, it makes people stay longer at your place to possibly browse your inventory a few times.
---
4- Pricing.  The most fundamental and basic thing.  Really pay attention to what the overall community is selling items for.  60% of people I visit are way overpricing in one way or another.  A player can have 4 machines, but if I see a stimpak being sold for 100 caps, I‚Äôll assume the rest is overpriced and not even look.  Check the boards here to see what your items are SELLING for, not what people are pricing them at.
---
1k on the shocks, and 1.5k on the jet pack. They seem to sell pretty good, any less than that and it's not worth the materials to make.
---
I dunno,  just fought a guy for a bit who tries to claim my workshop. They had same setup but I used my berry mentats and recon scope on them, plus sensor array in power armor will give a general direction where you are, friend or foe.

---
You could make it another cap sink essentially. 
---
Players would have the option to "invest" into their own business. After they invest x amount of caps they are granted an additional amount of vendor space (but make it exclusively for vending, not an overall stash increase). 
---
Or after they invest the essentially get awarded a passive perk that gives a bonus of x amount of weight in vending machines doe not found the against your stash limit.
---
The they'd need to begin investing again, hit a higher amount and be granted another small weight reduction in their vending machines.
---
I would just build a elevated platform with 4 walls and a roof around the storage box and change one wall to a doorway when I needed to get to it.
---
I would be for having this no different then using a container when your overweight and returning back and collect it.
---
Magazines , I have to restock them everyday.
---
After the fail of Survival mode I hope they learned their lesson and that the engine isn't viable for balanced PvP (neither is the stability) but knowing Bethesda....We will see what comes next
---
I give up. What would you like me to say or to do?
---
They‚Äôd be swimming in fucking money if they made a handmade skin
---
I've started buying .38 after getting a two shot combat and swapping it over to a .38 automatic reciever. Cheap to make and buy
---
If this happened I‚Äôd go back to PVPing in adventure by taking workshops. It‚Äôs already hard enough to find fights in survival, don‚Äôt make it worse. Change the scoring system back to most kills so we can find each other and the Care Bears can level in peace.
---
Must've been a rogue member of some kind of post apocalyptic P.E.T.A. group
---
This is just my totally uninformed opinion as someone who has been collecting these uniforms, but I would pay like ~$3000 caps for any of the colors.
---
I noticed sometimes the message log stops showing at all - not just for vendor messages.
---
the pipes are in the game, there are two "items" in your building menu, one with all the switches ,the other with the simple pipes
---
Lol and dont forgot the other one...I am not a tadpole!!! And it is judging me when you say oldest tadpole I have ever seen.

You‚Äôll get them when the vault raids open

Thanks for sharing! I don't visit IGN much so would have missed this!

Savage  arms .308 bolt action with a full wood stock, and 21 inch barrel weighs  5lbs. the fo76 equivalent (hunting rifle) with a short stock, and short  barrel weighs 6.6 lbs. A  lever action Winchester model 1892 weighs 6  lbs. with full stock and 20 inch barrel. the in game equivalent (lever  action rifle) weighs 6.6 lbs. with short stock, and short barrel. By the  time you mod these to have a long barrel, and full stock they weigh  around twice as much as the real thing. That's just two examples, but I  am sure that this is true across the board for all of the real world  fire arms in the game.
---
Either really.
---
I‚Äôm not sure what the negative affects are. But, with class freak all mutations are decent.
---
I think eagle eye helps with vats. Egghead increases intelligence so you get more scrap from guns.
---
I would've tried to assemble something like this myself...if only there was a powered door for the blue building set
---
Rare plans (anything BoS, Marine, harder to get weapons), ammo, fusion cores, antibiotics,  radshield.
---
It's not the servers. I've probably done 100+ and never crashed once.
---
I still think they should have made a "trader hub" instead of "camp vending"  
---
but the economy is shot, so what would be the point
---
The vast majority of the time I am crouched and most of that time I can't see over the overgrown grass. That often leads to me jumping around while attempting to acquire a target, track a target, or just to get a better idea of what's going on around me. I often play as a medic and even if I'm not in your party I still attempt to do what I can to prevent you from taking damage. And that requires a keen situational awareness (read: bouncing around like a jackrabbit). I'm not saying it doesn't look goofy as hell from a perspective other than mine but there's at least a few good reasons why you may see someone bouncing around. Additionally, it definitely opens up interesting new venues for otherwise impossible strategies or ways of getting around.
---
The conduits are in 76!
---
Also makes one spray a lot tho.
---
I really like the rust skin on unmodified Power Armor in Fallout 4.  I would like that to be added.
---
Just to be clear... all my friends could see me and I could see them despite seeing ourselves as chameleon. I never tested it with mobs.
---
I would rather have a 200lb global mailbox than an additional 200lb on a stash...
---
Love this idea!
---
Depends on your build tbh. I use a lot of stealth so I use bird bones, eagle eyes, speed demon, adrenal reaction marsupial and healing factor and that‚Äôs it. I don‚Äôt use melee unless it‚Äôs in an ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù scenario at which point my unyielding gear gives me all the strength I need. With these perks of mine I don‚Äôt even need the perk for reducing the negative effects.
---
Is there a discord or another sub to join to check this out?
---
Does this actually work? As in is 5x20% = 100%? Or does FO76 do it weird where the first is 20%, then the next is 20% of the remaining (so like... 36% reduction or something) and so forth until the 5th piece gets you a solid 70-80%?
---
I had to trim off some AGI for LCK because of Starched Genes but the minimal difference has been amazing. Originally I was going to go full Brotherhood and stay away from any serums (muties die) but then I accidentally got Talons from something and I'm an Unarmed main...then I tried out Twisted Muscles....welp I guess this chapter of the Brotherhood is going to be mutant friendly because I need these.

Tinfoil hats.

Someone had posted a thing on reddit not too long ago. Now I can‚Äôt find it for the life of me. But he/she had itemized them by rarity. I‚Äôm not sure what expertise was applied to their judgement, lol, but was just curious what others thought. I price them in my machine based on what a pain in the butt they were to acquire, because I got all mine from farming Defiance.
---
each target after 1 takes 50% damage up to 3 mobs ?
---
it could be balanced...
---
It will take me some time to digest all of this so for now **thank you**!
---
i've asked in the fo76 discord and no one knows, i'm just hoping that the next patch fixes it
---
I'm so down for this, and would literally be what bethesda envisioned I would think
---
I build the bare minimum for myself, but have seen some amazing player camps. It‚Äôs clear that some people take a lot of pride in what they build.
---
Not saying it couldn‚Äôt be but you didn‚Äôt mention any balance suggestions
---
I second this
---
This. Raising the number of players is going to make the servers more unstable tjen they already are.
---
I went by a persons camp and they were stocked on everything. They had a lvl 5 toon, so figured they were the mule. Great gear from 1*-3*. All priced at 25000 caps. I assume they wanted you to negotiate, but I didn‚Äôt bother. 
---
Then went by a different camp and they showed as having 30 something armor pieces. Cool, Pissed away the caps and travelled. Got there to find out they had a few crappy clothes and 18 PRISON COLLARS selling for 20 caps each. I‚Äôve never wanted to level another players camp, but would make an exception here. Thanks a lot ass, I want my fast travel caps back.
---
Kitchen Stove is non-functional.
---
It's still a great idea,and since I've yet to hear of anybody griefing so that wont be a problem, although it wouldn't hurt to further increase the stash box limit
---
Play it and make your own decision
---
Ammo, Stim packs and drugs. 
---
It's what I sell the most of hands down. Mostly drugs. 
---
I lied. Just drugs. The others sold well, but being a Chem pusher has better me the most consistent sales.
---
I tip my hat to you, good Sir!
---
Dont worry Mr. Poopy pants I have extra diapers
---
Very well written!!
---
Wow, looks great. Can‚Äôt wait to see what you come up with next.
---
&gt; Give it a break already! And don't even get me started about how you talk to me like you're Nazeem asking how often I get to the Cloud District.
---
&gt;  I would take a million angry Assaultron Dominators shoving their claws into my kidneys if I could be given the chance to shove your precious Bloodbug proboscis right up your propulsion jet.
---
&gt; See you tomorrow. I'll have your bugs.
---
Absolutely tremendous post, 10/10
---
Best idea I have seen in forever....
---
Someone would hack it thou so they could do one shot explosives...
---
Actually grabbing the pie out of the machine is a right of passage in this game. Proving you beat the RNG god. I played 500+ hours and never got one till one day I got 2 in one play session, then never again.
---
You should totally get 49 more of them^((I'm totally not suggesting this due to pie induced insanity I suffered in Fallout 4, got 56 of them in that game)). It's actually pretty fun to see how many of those pies you can collect.
---
I sell them for 3,000 all day long. I think that's pricey, but the market abides. It takes a lot of time to get them. while you are trying you are also wearing down your gear and wasting ammo, so repairs are a factor in my price.
---
Most likely a glitch. It has happened to me before, but only on rare occasions. Even if you are overencumbered, you should be able to respawn at the nearest location of your last death.
---
Werewolf attacks are completely random and unpredictable, like the vampires. No one can be blamed for senseless acts of violence perpetrated by man beasts not in control of their actions. 
---
For a modest fee I will represent you if this ever goes to Jarl for arbitration, you will not spend a single night in jail or your septims back, guaranteed.
---
Its been discussed already. Mr. üí©
---
If that's what it takes to obtain bacon... then it is a worthy sacrifice.
---
They had a gold one for awhile I belive
---
I would highly recommend you find your way back to the relative safety of your camp and spend a play session in weight reduction mode.  
---
If you are in that last 100 # zone, then you are close to the item will be destroyed on drop, you cannot craft because you are at max weight area.
---
Given you have to exit PA to craft, if you are already near max, when you exit PA and lose that carry bonus, it may put you at/over max weight,  At that point, you will not be able to craft (or repair) to use those things you are carrying.   Nor will you be able to drop them (at max weight, its a destroy only), nor can you scrap. Its destroy only,
---
When you get to camp, find your camp device and select repair all structures,  This will help remove some junk weight.
---
Scrap whatever junk you are carrying.  That will reduce a bit more.
---
Build stuff.
---
Yes, I know this from experience. 
---
Mitigation ideas:
---
Look at your stash box and personal inventory - where is the weight?
---
For example....
---
 Out of old habits, I pick up every radx/radaway I see.  
---
Over the weekend, I realized I was carrying almost 1k of them... and 300 stimpacks, and 70 purified waters.  At 1/4# per.... over 350# total right there. 
---
If you have multiple PAs, make sure all the parts are mounted on a frame.  On frame, the total weight is 10#, off frame, its the sum of the parts.
---
Find the closest train station and turn in some of those legendaries, or sell off some of the excess stuff.
---
Since the reason for stash limit is server performance and number of item instances, I'd prefer to have components not take weight in stash and instead be limited like 1000 pieces per component. Since components have no durability, any number of single component can be stored as single instance with an integer counter. Three pieces of food stored take more database space then 1000 of lead...
---
Dts? Disappearing turret syndrome?
---
Seems like a good solution
---
U left already?
---
He will spawn if a camp is there, just not in that same location. if a camp is there he will spawn at the other end of the upper tracks. Not sure if you still have to run to the other end of the lower track first, but it's not a bad idea, because there are both separate spawn locations and you could get lucky twice.
---
to be honest, stashes are lagging the game right now... let them stabilize that first before increasing the amount of items on display in a single server...
---
You did not have pacifist on, or were you in a workshop?
---
I get my stimps from completing events
---
Add me on PS4: flooping_pig. I just realized that I made it sound like a group project but it's just my personal camp. 30 3 star armors and Weapons apiece, at lvls 40, 45, 50
---
Have my upvote. That was pretty good.
---
Wait a week for patches to new content and then have a look. Lots of new stuff, obvious ones and more hidden gems as well
---
Also, please please please reduce the weight of plans. They‚Äôre pieces of paper, why do they weigh a quarter of a pound each?
---
Yep, thought I'd rebuild my camp slightly differently but now one wrong move and I have to start from scratch as I can't remove floors at all!
---
Usually whenever I need ballistic fiber, this guy in a police cap and underpants randomly drops me a couple in the middle of the road up to the military training camp without me ever even asking or know who he is. Wish I was kidding that I genuinely get more fiber from him than looting.
---
It's people you that make the community and experience great
---
I believe the cap is 90% reduction. It will never go above that.
---
My nuka cola‚Äôs seem to go quickle
---
Wherefore in the case of wherefore art thou Romeo, actually means why are you, not where are you.
---
Honestly, a swarm of enemies should attack you when you claim a workshop instead of opening you to pvp in adventure mode. And I mean a swarm, not 5 waves of 3 ghouls.
---
Be sure to price the same ammo type the same, or it takes up multiple spots.
---
Shotgun shell 1cent is one slot shotgun shells 2 cents another slot.
---
Mostly ammo 1 cap. Some plans
---
Militant Vegans are now a thing?
---
E3 will probably get you hyped to play it "Big changes ahead" right now there's new stuff but I wouldn't say it's enough to get excited about, even though it's good stuff the game still feels the same really
---
sounds like battle Royale... not for a br in fallout
---
Ahhh, I didn‚Äôt know this.. maybe that‚Äôs why no one buys my Ultracite stuff..
---
Southern divide.....come join us.....
---
Where is said group??
---
It‚Äôs rare when I sell the plans I get. But I just list them for like 50 caps mostly players under level 50 will buy them since they don‚Äôt know you can get the whole set for free
---
Anti armor magazine everyday. You can't have enough vats for 80 shots anyway. Let ap recharge while you relaoad.
---
Clearly you've never been a victim. Be thankful.
---
Good runs guys, 2 for 2
---
Hopefully they don't nerf fallout 4 stash sizes
---
No matter how much they raise the limit people will keep complaining cause there‚Äôs no room. There‚Äôs probably a lot of stuff in there that you don‚Äôt need to keep. That‚Äôs my problem, I‚Äôm a god damn hoarder and I can‚Äôt help it
---
Just did it at Bog Town, not horrible
---
That's not necessarily true... generalist builds like str are more meta than stealth despite not having  as much dmg due to being far easier to pull off every time and it's not that niche with still a fair amount of dmg
---
Good runs, 2 for 2
---
Criminality. A little risky,but totally the fastest.
---
we could really use those last 200 pounds in the stash system.
---
Yep. When I'm farming I loot everything off the bodies and I can keep going for 20+ minutes this way before risking getting overencumbered. Of course I'm using neally all of the weight reduction perks and all 5 pieces of WR armor.
---
Thanks very much!
---
Cool story, bro.
---
Fallout wizard here üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è , I‚Äôve done the challenge twice before and this time i didn‚Äôt even have to do it. 4/5 daily challenges showed up as complete when I logged on
---
Scout Leader Penny is a gift to mankind and I will never be convinced otherwise. 
---
Uff-dah!
---
The problem is, if you unlocked this forever, it would still be just another band-aid solution. Like plans, it will only be a problem for a little while before somebody has all the required upgrades. Something like 10 caps per pound per hour of playtime would be a very effective cap sink
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure when I put on a 3rd armor with the same FDC weight reduction nothing changed in my weight. 2 makes a huge difference but putting the third on did nothing.
---
Aww, shucks. Thanks for the kind words. :)
---
Fellow  fallout wizard. I did this challenge everytime it came up.

As someone who can only find green and brown. I think I‚Äôm cursed.

Oki doki!

Down To Scrip?

I felt the same way: was skeptical about this kind of wide multiplayer lobby fallout game. Was hoping for more of a Borderlandsish co-op. Now I'm glad they did it this way. It has that borderlands co-opish feel but with other people you run into, who are real characters btw. I've met saviors, scamps, engineers, merchants, stoners, leaders, followers, and people who usually just get out of the way but felt that this time they should say something. Everybody's been more entertaining than I expected and I expect I'll be playing this on and off over the next several years. 
---
And yes, the collar does add a "hey I'm kinky!" flair.
---
It's an easy fix if you do a little due diligence ony
---
 your selected site.  After you pick your spot, have friends (if you have any lol) fast travel to the site.  Other players will always land in the same spot.  Build accordingly. 
---
But yeah it would be nice not to have to bother with doing that.
---
Nice attention to detail.
---
Mine is executioners/ +10 aiming/ reduce weight...bit I never make .38 ammo...all my lead goes to 5.56. (B/ffr assault rifle is a greedy bitch even if I don't use her much)
---
Nope. I got all the 400+ of caps for it. I see what you mean though. I noticed that yesterday when I purchased some plans. I got three for the price of one for some reason.
---
You even said you checked an exploit videos description...
---
Yea permanent increase would be more convenient, but actually pickable storage boxes would be hugely fun. People will rethink their camp building, around both vending and secret storage. Bethesda can even sell lots of skins for them, like a camouflaged skin for a storage sack would make it pretty hard to spot.
---
Was just trying to tell you how youtube works
---
Nice fanfic bro. /r/writingprompts
---
My full set of deep pocketed unyielding armor gives me something like 430 carry weight when I'm at 20%. I know the bloodied build isn't for everyone, but if you want huge melee damage and PA sized carry weight it's a good way to go.
---
I‚Äôve been there! It‚Äôs actually easy for him to escape because the pole has no top, so nothing was stopping him from just sliding the handcuff up. But I digress, very cool little environmental storytelling.
---
Survivors guilt....
---
I use the "lady Janets soft serve" spawn location for him about 3 times a day when im bored. 
---
My run is to spawn in, run out of the woods and across the street from your spawn point, where there is another random spawn event point (usually 3  enemies, and a chance to find something cool). then hang a right and run to the bus through the woods. I stop on the rock ledge there to see what has spawned in. if it's not the bot I try again. this way you get to avoid what ever time  waster is lurking in that trailer home unless they see you. This method is just to make it faster and less ammo wasting if your going to server hop. (server hopping Pro Tip: You should make sure that the area is fully spawned before you run over there. I do this by leaving my pipboy radio on. when the pipboy radio starts playing, you will know that the world is actually ready.)
---
great ideas. the more functions and different playstyles the better.
---
Yes. I had ten went to 5 and now im down to two.
---
oh god, thats not rain..
---
I wasn't arguing for any  one build over another...just defining meta...
---
I mean, if you used VATS you did technically use an aim not so he wasnt wrong...
---
I'm sorry. I've had so many negative comments recently.

Yes this was after I saw the notification show up on my phone.
---
Im DTF.
---
Ok , good start, definitely not a bloodied style player.
---
Deep pocketed armor plus my simple backpack has me at 325. That's not even with the extra carry backpack mod.  Power armor now is less carry weight for me.
---
Oh yeah I completely agree with you. It‚Äôs actually impossible not to bounce around, especially if you are being rushed or swarmed since there is no way to do a short jump lol. Tons of good reason why a marsupial would bounce around.
---
But I am talking about a different breed of marsupial...the kind that NEVER.STOP.JUMPING. 
---
 Absolutely no chill ever and determined to jump on every single surface that can be jumped on at all times.
---
 Say a thank you prayer to Atom if you have never run across these special bouncy bois.
---
I can recommend the book "Reality is broken" by Jane McGonigal, it explains a lot about what it is that keeps us interested in games. 
---
Also kinda related to your post: I was recently building and decorating my camp and thinking about atom shop items I want to get for it... And then wondering why I wouldn't put the same effort into my apartment. So yeah, this game is kinda catchy
---
Just glad I beat them at their own game

Yeah. It happens to only one of my characters. Sucks ass.

Yea better make sure the walls are bullet resistant. I was just at a player‚Äôs shop ten minutes ago, some supermutants suddenly broke the walls and also one of the vending machines, all while I was browsing the content of another vending machine.
---
I make a ton of caps by simply stocking my vendors with desirable items, and pricing them low enough that they sell consistently. Which requires a lot of game knowledge and a lot of trial and error. 
---
But in general, this is probably the fastest way to make caps. Player vending. There‚Äôs been many days where I‚Äôve made well over 20k. I‚Äôve even had to start buying serum recipes from the enclave to dump caps, when I can‚Äôt find a player to sell them to me. And basically all I do is fast travel around to farm events, and a few key locations.
---
Oh no you can still be viciously murdered in pacifist if the other player is strong enough
---
Preach brother, unfortunately I think any serious changes/fixes to the build system will be lower on the priority list. There is a laundry list of other issues, the system is not all bad but its needs a long serious look.
---
I may have been that dude in the T-60...
---
get anything good?
---
Most ‚Äúsellers‚Äù aren‚Äôt sellers, they‚Äôre giving items away at or below cost.
---
This is why only that crap moves- as long as the masses keep getting things basically for free, there won‚Äôt be a market, so why bother?
---
Tbh, you put bored, capped out or at least fully outfitted players in a game with nothing to do with money and yeah, they‚Äôre going to destroy any economy by giving shit away.
---
It‚Äôs just another sign of a dead or dying game.  There is no aspect untouched by the basic fact that we‚Äôre playing on a corpse.
---
Wanted level remains
---
Lots in the hills near Silvia farm.  West and South of 76.
---
And so am I? Most effective could be defined to be the most efficient over the whole game, defining it to just the highest damage negates the fact that build may be niche and might not be easy to either set up or pull off. As an example stealth builds are higher dmg right now but are very niche and str build speccing into any of the melee shotty or heavy means you have a wide arrange of very good and malleable playstyles. Including explosive legendary effects which can be boosted by str.
---
Can you show me a picture of them??? Im not seeing it.
---
Stop drowning the ferrets
---
Sweet, I server hopped at the soft serve for a bit (maybe 15-20 times) didn‚Äôt have any luck so I thought I had the wrong info on the bot. Good to know I wasn‚Äôt completely wasting my time just unlucky.
---
It's been a min since I used a crossbow. What's going on with em???
---
Yep. Luck be with you!
---
I would have preferred rerolling chances on existing weapons, similar to Diablo 3 reroll system, only not limited to rerolling only a single attribute slot. I'd be happy to pay a few hundred scrips per reroll weapons I have to eventually have the stats I want, or even pay more to add stars to existing items.
---
According to this, that guy did you a favor as all that time spent carrying it slowly around wasn‚Äôt worth it since you should‚Äôve given everything away for nothing in your vending.
---
Doing it in an hour or so......gt is same as name
---
Ohhhh okay. Cool beans. I won't be so angry about it now then I guess haha
---
At least you can find brown.
---
You are doing a 100% better than me :P
---
In fact after 1500 hours and countless events I only have two cosmetic rewards and the green asylum uniform is one of them.
---
The other one is the black cowboy hat, which of course it can also be found as a 'world spawn' because of course it does.
---
It couldn't possibly have been a nice jumpsuit, no, it had to be the only common cosmetic in the whole fucking tangled nest of levelled lists :P
---
Either way I guess that makes it a 'prized possession' to me ;)
---
Not really, a couple prime receiver plans I didn't have and 9 plans I already had.
---
With1-2 rare exception of grievers, I agree 98%
---
Egghead is high intelligence and unless you are hacking it‚Äôs pretty unnecessary given it‚Äôs limited use. I think you over fabricate fusion cores and maybe your XP gets a buff but the downside wasn‚Äôt something I was willing to take on. May have been -4 strength? Don‚Äôt remember. 
---
Eagle eyes for VATS
---
this happens with a few quests sadly
---
Yeah I sell mine for 200 each cause it‚Äôs just Ultracite but maybe that‚Äôs my problem. The base price is like 500 for some of the plans so I thought I was doing good by putting them down at 200 but maybe people don‚Äôt have the caps? I‚Äôll probably just lower it again, fuck it
---
Fortunately I haven't had any experiences with them yet and I hope not too
---
Leaving server should clear it, but of course, it doesn‚Äôt.  Horrid coding.  Horrid devs.
---
I'm trying to sell Jetpac plans for 150, and they are not shifting, I have 22 T51b ones,  they are a pretty much guaranteed drop from the Queen now, Ultracite armor plans just get dropped. 
---
 I get steady caps from Serums, the trick is keeping them cheap, for me that's 300 each, I keep 3 of each in stock, buying flux at 100, 300 gives me a good return, occasionally someone will come in and clear me out, I'll go to their vendor and see them reselling for 1k+, good luck  to them, I've made  the better part of  10k, They'll be lucky to sell 1.
---
I‚Äôll take a look. Sending psn
---
Take a picture of the silo thing opening and launching it. A video, perhaps. I knew this existed, though.
---
I have the deep pocketed armor and the increased backpack mod putting me at 400 carry weight at full health.
---
Why stop there? We can be forced to be fully zoomed in while using the 105mm lens. Using only the mole miner camera skin. With caltrops equipped as your grenade weapon at the time. While wearing a fursuit. Oh, and maybe a mr fuzzy costume in game, too
---
I‚Äôve lost stuff doing this. Don‚Äôt know why but my friend was standing right by the world container and when I logged back in it was gone
---
That‚Äôs what I charge.  I have every damn color in my vending.
---
Even if it was released in it's current state it would be underwhelming. They should have delayed it a year and polished it. The new content has been exciting and promising but it just feels like this game is circling the drain at this stage. Bethesda still has a lot of work to do to stabilise the situation, big fixes is way more important than more content.
---
Yeah if you got the luck to have a behemoth spawn and bog town full of muties then indeed.
---
Would it be a static encounter then i would agree on not horrible. But it isnt and therefore it's pain.
---
But nevertheless - congrats to you mate!
---
I found a behemoth at bog town this morning before the challenges reset, but there were no hounds. Maybe two weeks later when I get the behemoth spawn again
---
Do you have strength mods on any of your gear?
---
Nope.  That‚Äôs just the way it is unfortunately.
---
If it's battle royale I'm probably gonna keep playing, but with a disgruntled fine.
---
Mascots and clown heads do fit in though.  It's the post apocalypse and there is something to be said about peacocking.
---
Immortan Joe tied a guy in pajamas shredding a guitar to the top of one of his murder trucks.
---
Its clear you have armor that gives strength or weight bonuses. Armor gets removed in PA.
---
They work just fine.
---
You're losing the pocket and/or strength bonus from your regular armor when you climb into PA.
---
I thought that was fixed in the latest patch?
---
No just deep pockets on everything, it's why my carry weight is 345 without Power Armour.
---
You‚Äôre just proving his point and making yourself look bad
---
I feel like a lot of them (namely healing factor) make the game too easy, so I don't use them. Immersion isn't really an issue though, there are already other immersion breaking issues around every corner. Not that the game is particularly realistic to begin with
---
Idk wtf his problem is
---
My camp is there. I farm him every time I travel back, it whenever somebody comes to my vending machines... It's wonderful, but yeah, never ever had a hound there
---
and today we get one of the most annoying camera dailies returning for 3rd time "pic of behemoth and hound together," along with one that requires another player, outfit and location, and of course a hunter/hunter that will continue to never be done by anyone.
---
Yeah unfortunately I didn‚Äôt do too many queens before she stopped dropping the serum recipes so now I‚Äôm kinda fucked cause I believe there‚Äôs no way to get them now right? Unless I pay the outrageous plan prices people will charge me. Maybe a lot of people already have the jet pack plans. I see the jetpack‚Äôs sell for like 3k on the market so I thought selling them for 1k would give people a discount &amp; gimme some extra caps.. I was wrong lol
---
I got this exact thing last night for a 2 star meat hook, might have to rework my character a bit. It's actually pretty fun.
---
Congrats!
---
But i'm curious - How many servers/lure attempts were needed?
---
I would love BioCommMesh mod to be available for Marine or Scout Torsos as well
---
That‚Äôs what I meant, like nope there‚Äôs no problem, that‚Äôs just the way it isssss doo doo do doo doo do doo do dooo you will never carry weeiiiiighhhhht.
---
Great work.  More art, less whining about griefing is needed in this SR. Keep it up
---
I have a vampire's plasma rifle from back in the days when they were bugged and could only spawn with one star. I've turned it into a plasma thrower since then and we have come a long way. I'd give anything to slap some more effects on that
---
&gt; bees dick
---
I kek'd inwardly and outwardly
---
I'm up for anything in this system really. I'm over 500 hours never recieved 1 good legendary anything armor nor weapons. I've literally used the same 1 star furious meat hook for the past 75 levels or so. I've been stockpiling ammo in the Hope's that one day I'll get something good but it never seems to happen. I dunno the grind is starting to get old when there is no pay out for doing it anymore. 
---
Just like the magazines. I get the same 10 over and over and over. I stopped looking for them all together. 
---
The odds they have set in this game are trash. Either play for 10 hours a day or spend money on our stuff or you won't get it. 
---
Sorry to the semi casual gamer that cant spend all that time just farming. It doesn't matter that you bought the game same as everyone else. But dont get rewarded too bad maybe next game we put out you'll buy that and have a chance.. it's getting old
---
Yeah but when I wear Excavator Power Armour my carry weight is 485, I prefer the look of the X-01.
---
#5 Endgame. Endgame never changes.
---
Here‚Äôs my secret....I give shit away for less than what an noc vendor would give me...
---
No fucking wonder it ‚Äú moves‚Äù.  It‚Äôs essentially free caps to anyone who can be bothered to flip to an npc.
---
Good question.  Hope there is a solid answer
---
You on PC? I have a baseball bat for you.
---
I had someone do that with a vendor in white springs. I was selling some items and all the sudden some one was hitting me over and over. So i backed out to see what was going on and they took over the vendor...so... I killed the vendor bot.
---
Maybe I have a glitch on the Excavator Armour, never thought about it till this answer.
---
Regardless, people wouldn't be happy with a lack of human NPCs despite them never promising them from the off.
---
haha, yeah. I have so many ultracite PA plans now
---
I dunno if it was or wasnt. I just know I was in pacifist. And got mowed down. All pacifist did was prevent me from defending myself
---
If they knew that it was going to be poorly received why did they try to hammer out as many pre-orders as possible? Should have been upfront that it was going to be bad and that they will fix it along the way.
---
On Xbox!
---
You get a reroll that costs 60 scrip if you sell your three star you got for 40 scrip immediately after purchasing it
---
tbh I got bored and started playing FO4 again idk why
---
In that case OP would need to further define exactly which tactic he wants to optimize as pve and pvp are two different animals. And you know what they say about Jack of all trades.
---
Gotta love the good ol‚Äô bait message. I think I‚Äôve entrapped hundreds of salty kids into comms bans over the years. I love my weekly ‚Äúthank you for making xbox a better community‚Äù message.
---
Look at him, owning it. Like a grownup. You don't see that kind of dignity much these days.
---
Are you talking about the mission with the holotapes??? There's no way to complete that quest. Is unfinished because they plan to add more.
---
I feel like if they stick with it its going to be in a great spot in a year or so, but I'm just worried that a large amount of resources will start to be pulled from it when its Starfield time.
---
snacc attac**
---
Not always
---
But you watched it, you dont need to search anything because you watched the video
---
Hey, there's a similar situation in the Wendigo Cave. Some guy was cuffed into a pole, similar situation, no food, bandana covering eyes, fucking tibia was sawed off.
---
This and a skin that has deathclaw hide draped over the power armor
---
When the gane was initially announced I had hopes that they would have an equal level of play to the Frost mod for FO4, only with other players fighting you for everything. 
---
Imagine if every dead tree only provided lumber to thr first person who got there?
---
I would also make being overencumbered much more of an issue dobthat you couldn't have the first player out the gates just take every tree and fuck everyone else over. 
---
Being severely overencumbered should slow you down to the point of immobility. Making it harder to aim in addition to doing health damage. 
---
Imagine how dangerous nuke zones would be if only one player could harvest a plants flux?
---
No problem, just trying to help
---
To be fair, before it launched they did put out an open letter admitting she was gon' be rough.
---
Ok, so your seeing the writing on the wall finally?
---
Saw this before release.  Fallouts fallout, and that‚Äôs a huge thing, but it‚Äôs not fortnite or rust, or pac man, it‚Äôs fallout.
---
These devs even realize it by now- I know they do.  That‚Äôs why fo76 has no future.
---
Basically half the time you enter vats with it, it will miss every shot no matter the hit chance. 
---
Also concentrated fire doesn't work at all.
---
I said before player vending. You don't read too well. I literally give my stims away to low levels whenever I run across them now because they hardly sell these days.
---
I expect more from Bethesda
---
Thanks for understanding.
---
D:
---
Rumor has it, there‚Äôs a bug on excavator armor... I believe it‚Äôs something like, if you load in with your excavator PA suit on, you get extra carry weight, and the second you step out and go back in it drops to normal. Very weird but very beneficial if your looting!
---
That‚Äôs what they want to force down our throats but until they realize fo players like it solo, it goes nowhere fast.
---
I only use marsupial and grounded..
---
I run starched genes2 but I do not run class freak
---
Oh man yeah that sucks. Because of that I was cryolating the queen down to give us a better chance but the past month I been helping crippling her with my shotgun so she doesn't goes flying off so we can do as much dps as we could. The past week I been running into a group of players on multiple servers that seems to kill the queen with more than 18-22 min to spare
---
Only other thing you can do is get motion-assisted servos for your torso piece
---
Omg this needs to happen. Why not make it where you have a quest line where you kill the most OP enemies to get the mods for power armor and clothing.
---
Yes, I used my mule for two friends last night and they got the trophy..now I just need a few kills to get my trophy
---
Yeah so I can quit using alts
---
If you aren't Bloodied, Deep Pocketed mods on each piece + Standard Backpack alone will add about 100 carry weight.
---
If the data was shown (on pc at least) , I‚Äôd bet you‚Äôd see a huge number of dual account players trying desperately to get around the multiplayer shackles they want us in - that should be telling in and of itself.
---
So the Calibrated Shocks are working I just confused the Power Armour glitches, I always thought your armour benefits worked in Power Armour, clearly not.
---
The reduction adds up 20 to 40 to 60 to 80 to 90
---
Oh i pay close attention where they spawn at mine, just wish others would too. I know it's somewhat predictable, and sometimes not, but when you got someone asking for you to move something via voicechat and through xbox messaging to no response, or belated unenthusuatic or accusatory response... Is just a little vexing.
---
Aw I see it not just me then. I had this happen 3 times so far with the Free Range event.
---
LOL! You reminded me of when I want to get up a small step/obstruction that I can't walk up or over and instead I jump 20ft into the air. Praise be unto him because I have yet to meet one of those special bouncy bois.
---
U mean launch nukes from every silo or what exactly do you mean?
---
Aww man
---
Customer service is important to me.
---
a shitty little robot
---
Yea it happen not too often but yea it does
---
No I mean just secure all the silos, destroy all the robots and disarm the security.
---
I've got my perks, mutations and armor at a place where I can basically run forever during the daytime of I have a pistol. I highly recommend this.
---
Yes, yes they are. Thats why i have 4 Rocketlaunchers and two heavy Lasers upfront.  Makes for a nice source of income aswell. Just go exploring, return to camp, loot smushed Supermuties and carry the loot to the nearby Station :p
---
A lot of great suggestions here. I wish they had a reporter style outfit something like Pipers from fallout 4.  Something that says I‚Äôm totally neutral not here to help or harm.
---
Thanks n.n
---
Yeah hope so. Would be cool if we got some cool content for doing this.
---
Sure
---
Awesome. My PSN is jamilla0126
---
Oh, I expunged almost every Chem from my Stash a while ago.  Stimpacks are ridiculously heavy.  I only keep a couple of those, and a couple cans of dog food, in the worse case scenario that I find myself with absolutely none and need to find more.
---
I find Cola Nut setups interesting, but I'm not sure where reliable sources of Nuka-Cola are found.  I don't think they show up as random drops from enemies like dog food does, so I'd always need to make the fast travel rounds to find it, and I just can't be bothered. üòã
---
Eh. Alright.
---
Not necessarily launch nukes, just secure the silos, which 76 overseer is tasked with.
---
Umm, silver! Thank you!
---
Not all weapons are suited for extended use, but each has their strengths and utility
---
you need to complete the quest in one go without logging off/ switching servers. it happens with a few quests and its a know bug.
---
Alright
---
Pimp Boy in da houuuuuuse
---
Joining your world now
---
No prob
---
I'm not entirely sure they do.
---
CAMP space used to be a concern when I had more turrets and did the whole farming and Brahmin thing.  But now that I have basically a 2-story, 2x3 CAMP with a single turret and no crops, I've been able to decorate it pretty densely and am still only about halfway filled.
---
You might want to list what platform that was...
---
I got drilled the other day at my workshop. Level 250 and level 120. I figured they were taking the workshop so I just re spawned at my camp (not interested in PvP). I make a vendor run and then check the map to see what's up, I see that I still own the WS??? Apparently they just wanted to kill me???
---
What about the players who dont want to use voice chat?
---
Definitely on my list of things to do.   Hopefully this evening.
---
I agree tbh. I get that it's annoying not to have NPCs and such but it makes the game stand out a little and is a defining feature of it. How many games give you all your missions through dead people?
---
DAAAAAMN thanks for the heads up. Now I'm scurrred
---
What I believe you are seeing moments after take off is the stage 1 (solid fuel boosters) detaching from the main...body?...whatever it's called. I don't know. I'm not a rocket engineer. Something changes and it looks cool. It's the little things. Very cool!
---
Your error in your thinking that fluctuation of prices will effect every item across the board flat.  It will not.
---
Fast travel to Helvitica. The yellow house just down the street from the spawn point has a wood storage area. Slap on Woodchucker perk and get over 100 wood in like 60 seconds. Server hop if you need more.
---
Wholesome content.
---
I would like a steampunk style skin for my railway rifle it would go great with my current characters look.
---
TLDR: "Get with the overcharging meta, people, or else you're killing the game!"
---
Look for 'the couriers fallout 76'
---
Get a mic
---
I'm of the unpopular opinion that CAMP size will never be large enough for players into building detailed camps.  I can also appreciate that larger camps might have a negative impact to server performance.   
---
Stash size, if I had to guess, is mostly a function of server performance that is holding back an increase.  In a perfect world they find a way to increase it without negative server performance impact but imo there are a couple things they could do as a stop gap.    
---
The weight of some weapons is absurd and especially weapon mods so taking a pass at those would help.  I'd guess a lot of players with stash weight issues its due to selling weapons and armors but mostly weapons as many can crest 20 lbs per pop, some over 30+.  Doesn't take much to hit that 800 lbs cap when 10 weapons can easily weigh close to 300 lbs.
---
Additionally allowing for easier transfer of stash items between characters in the players account would also help as this way players can "mule" items and this would help mitigate the problem.
---
Great post... hate to admit, but I was prepping for a scorchbeast battle and needed stims in a hurry, went to the first camp I saw and dude was charging 40 caps a piece. I think that‚Äôs crazy high! I will take some time to craft them when I can, and when I get a surplus I will sell them in my vending machine for 15 caps... wish more players priced competitively!
---
Not everyone wants to use a mic.
---
Is it that?  If ignorance baffles you than perhaps its not someone else ignorance but your own?
---
Dunno, can only point it out. Can not make people understand it.
---
Thats the best Thing about it!!!! I love the missions the dead people give you!! OMG!! So Epic!!
---
A lot of people will start taking a workshop just so they can easily kill you, then leave without taking it, in the hopes that you will return.
---
The hardest choices require the strongest of wills.
---
70,000? I thought someone said limit is 25,000?
---
No worries, you could also have you main and alt in the same (secluded place) on a map, and make sure you are able to get back to the same server with both, leave an item in a world box (toolbox, safe, any container) and swap but that's also super risky
---
As you level up they will get easier. For now, don‚Äôt do them until you can actually do them
---
Still burying his head in the sand I see.
---
At least he admits they should have tested it longer
---
Search for 'the couriers fallout76' on fb. They are legit the best. I've done multiple transfers with them absolutely 0 hassle
---
I actually really love this wtf
---
Hey now, they also drop intestines, which is a component of Fasnacht Sausages.
---
Delicious sausages.
---
Same here.  I'll see the Caps display, but there won't be any message for vending or anything else that appears in that area of the screen.
---
Reminds me of that feeling starting the game. [That's beautiful man.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5T96LHnEWw)
---
I‚Äôll be on soonish I‚Äôm happy to help if no one comes to you earlier psn zuperfly1
---
watch ur bac*
---
smh then your not a true Bethesda game fan. Just one of those Bethesda game haters....
---
Caps farming, this is what they do now.
---
I have this issue with an holo tape as well.
---
I just got done doing this for the second time on another character. It‚Äôs brutal. Whoever came up with that quest line obviously has some pain they want to share.
---
You literally make no sense, do you always have such a bad attitude?
---
10-4. Mine's mavhay.  I'll be on the lookout for you. I want the backpack soooooo bad ;)
---
Me and my brother loved the quest.
---
That would suck. Yay, fun gameplay where every server is empty of every material.
---
Why not make all legendaries only drop the legendary to the one who takes it first
---
Since they're different studios, in theory that shouldn't be an issue.
---
Im level 100
---
In real life. Do you have a text chat?!??! NO! You only have voice chat! Meaning get a mic or dont chat at all you Bethesda game studio game hater!
---
For a time, I'd say Flux, but I don't have as much of it to sell anymore.
---
BOS Combat Armor Helmets aren't amazingly profitable, but they sell pretty regularly.  Shielded BoS Underarmor moves as well, but it's rather resource intensive to make.
---
Treasure Maps are always selling.
---
Had a difficult time moving various Junk and Chems, so I don't bother with those anymore.  I don't know about other players, but I don't know enough about what resources I need at any given time.  Only when I decide to upgrade or repair something, and half the time I'll just be lazy and do it all at Whitesprings.
---
Real life is not the same as a game, do I have to explain that further? Games are meant to offer options to suit different gamers, it's called making a game accessible.
---
I was having a problem with that the other night on pc. I did a scan and repair on the game install and updated the GPU's driver and it worked fine. Is there a way to do that on the xb?
---
Unmodified backpack, deep pockets on 5 pieces of armour with strong back gives me 400 as standard for scavenger/adventure everyday use. Combined with weight reduction perks it does perfectly for my needs.
---
Did you have a stealthboy icon in your effects under ap bar? And did you have weird flames covering your body?
---
I've wasted months trying to get another copy to learn combat armor.
---
Yea, that one and I believe Belly of the Beast start you from scratch.
---
Literally the exact same problem here (still).  HUD on X01.
---
1000000 IQ: Buy all unyielding +strength and reduced weight and run around with 30 hp
---
Nope
---
Camp and stash sizes and number of players per server all tie back to server performance.  They are set where they are for good reasons.
---
Yea, it happened to me with that quest and later on don't start looking for the brotherhood transponders until you have the time to finish it as that one resets too.
---
We don‚Äôt call them colored anymore.
---
I‚Äôll bite the bait. You‚Äôre engaging in text chat now. Any time you send a text message instead of calling someone, you‚Äôre engaging IRL text chat. Text chat exists IRL.
---
What are they called?
---
Can confirm this has happened to me as well. Makes them feel cool to kill people half their rank and minding their own business apparently
---
I can't remember what category it's in, but it's an outdoor port o potty.
---
haha
---
You were in survival mode right?
---
Sometimes when stuff has been in my shop for a long time I just set the price to 0 and if it doesn‚Äôt sell. I just trash it.
---
Git gud scrub
---
Not sure why he downed/revived/killed you. Were you still wanted when he finally killed you? The only way to clear being Wanted is to be killed by another player, so if you were downed but revived, that may have left you Wanted still, and he finally killed you to clear the Wanted flag. In that case, he was trying to do you a favor ;)
---
Everything you did is fine except for picking locks. Don't pick locks that belong to other people (IE their camp or an owned workshop), they locked them for a reason!
---
Only thing like that on xbox that I know of is uninstall  and reinstall
---
Really? I learned the marine then. Recently bought the plan in watoga. There is guys that have both, they advertise their services on the market.
---
How much are kids seats? They can‚Äôt possibly be just $5 anymore, can they?
---
This game is immersive so we need to make it as immersive as possible and adding crappy Human NPC's from fallout 4 and test chat would be non-immersive and just plain stupid. Text chat is irrelevant when there's voice chat.. If you want a text chat program then go to discord! You shouldn't be playing an Online game! Also if you dont want to talk to players then you shouldnt want to text chat with them either. BGS hater.
---
Average wait times at my local DMV on days before and after the weekend and before and after holidays are fairly extreme in my opinion (it's a relatively small city). I asked one time after waiting 4hrs before I angrily left and illegally drove away when I should come back so I could get my license renewal before I retired. Now I wait on average 30 minutes to 1hr. The more you know. Even my first run through this quest when I couldn't find that damn piece of mail for what seemed like an embarrassing amount of time wasn't as bad as my IRL DMV. Also, the in-game attendants don't seem to mind when I yell expletives at them and the other patrons so that's a plus.

This, area has so many wood piles next to each other you'll have 250-300 wood in a matter of like 10 seconds.
---
I don't even look at them lol
---
I think the issue now that‚Äôs different is they‚Äôve introduced a whole player economy with the vending machine so players are holding on to more legendary items and ammo they don‚Äôt personally use. I‚Äôd just be happy if the vending machines had their own capacity separate from your stash.
---
Can you build your camp ON the opening platform?
---
That would be kinda neat lol
---
maybe they learned it before it was bugged. Either that or the guy I was trading with knew both and didn't realize it. I'd be down for testing it further with someone that knows combat but not marine.
---
Fake news. Where you hear that from CNN? When your outside and someone comes up to you and says "Hello sir?" Do you reply with 
---
A. Your Voice?
---
or
---
B. A Text chat? 
---
.......
---
Hey man I just got a legendary revolver from the Purveyor that I have zero interest in. It‚Äôs a 3 star... I‚Äôm on PS4. I‚Äôd be willing to trade it to ya. I am out of town and won‚Äôt be on for a few days but just a thought!
---
With around 700 hours game time and only encountered 2 griefers and one scammer.
---
First, don't tell me what I should or shouldn't be playing. Text chat can exist alongside voice perfectly fine, so try and get this through your thick skull: not everyone likes speaking to strangers in an online game but they might still want to play it.
---
How do you kill that which has no life?
---
I think they even said, it was only a half finished game so be prepared for that.
---
In the pip-boy calculation, Explosive for non-shotguns currently adds +20% per projectile, or +32% per projectile with max Demo Expert. The slightly puzzling part is that the Flechette mod sets the number of projectiles to 7, while the calculation there looks more like 8.
---
The pip-boy numbers don't necessarily match the real effects. I don't have any multi-projectile explosive weapons to test.
---
Ya got turned red. That‚Äôs all.
---
The first kill was actually somewhat of a kindness, since it would get rid of your wanted status. I let people run away when it happens to me, but the first time I became wanted on accident, I just wanted someone to kill me and get it over with. 
---
Reviving you just to kill you again was a bit of a dick move given the circumstances, but they didn‚Äôt know your intentions. And at the end of the day, dying doesn‚Äôt really matter since caps and junk are easy come easy go, so it‚Äôs no big deal either way.
---
Don‚Äôt worry too much about pissing people off. There‚Äôs some mean things you can do, like exploiting poorly designed pvp mechanics to trick/force people who don‚Äôt know any better into pvp, but otherwise there‚Äôs really not much you can actually do to hurt other people. Many resources can be locked, and they all come back over time. Camps can be repaired for dirt cheap. Worst thing you can do to someone outside pvp is steal their junk bag after they die, which may be deeply offensive, but really isn‚Äôt that bad.
---
/s ?

I rebuilt my friends camp last week and my plans had to be cut short due to the ‚Äúinaccessible‚Äù bug with foundations and stairs.   My own camp is a sprawling McMansion on the golf course but I had to just tack my shops on as an after thought since I could never recreate my house until this is fixed.
---
It‚Äôs a fantastic idea. You posted a comment about it earlier and I‚Äôve been thinking about it ever since. It would be very challenging to implement, but would truly make the game one of a kind. 
---
I‚Äôd say make it something where you can kind of play/travel as you like, but are spawned in at a random level with random raider gear. If you pick up other items, craft mods etc, that‚Äôs all fine, but when you die‚Äîwhich you will‚Äîyou drop it all and get respawned at a raider camp. On respawn you‚Äôre randomized again so the death is essentially permanent. There should also be some way to team up with others, Raiders do generally move in packs. 
---
You‚Äôd only be able to pick up npc appropriate items and have limited carry weight, no stash of course and the whole eating/drinking thing could be done away with. 
---
It could be attached to the character of your choice, so any rewards would be assigned before you start. 
---
I love the idea of rewards based on damage, not necessarily kills. I‚Äôm thinking a randomized selection of caps, legendary scrip, scout badges or even atoms could work. No crazy amounts, but you would be volunteering to be the content, so it should be worth something.
---
No, I just want a harder, end gamish adventure mode (pve).
---
Like after all the nukes from vault 76 players, winter comes, but is a nuclear one, much more fucked up regarding radiation, and bringing glowing and high level enemies to all regions, including forest and toxic waster.
---
[Heres](https://twitter.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1054475944101138443) the link to the letter if anyone was curious.
---
They should be able to fix that fairly easy I would think. If the known works off naming and not id, change the names.

Just to get the atoms for Woopsies - it's worth a try lol

You can also connect wire connectors to the top and bottom to pass through floors and ceilings.

We dont need BGSG haters in our community! The game is perfect the way it is!! All we need is more Holotapes and more dead people quest not some stupid text chat and Alive human NPC"s. Theres not point! First we have text chat! Also, we have a ton of emotes that explain every from "hi" to "bye we have it! Plus BGS is even adding more!!
---
I've sold loads for that price, and seen them listed for much more
---
Just curious, is fire rate indicated with rpm or just simply fire rate?
---
Nope, it has something to do with the chameleon armor effect, falling and power armor. Something people who build high rise camps and being dropped to your death upon spawning in would probably have experienced but did not know it as they still take damage from mobs and such, and with pacifist on you they don't take damage from players and on their screens they see themselves like normal but other players don't. Not even a tag even when not crouched.
---
GT to join?
---
The excavator armor has a set effect which gives +100 carry weight. X01 doesnt have this and that's why your weight changes so much from one PA to the next.
---
I do have the backpack already.....does a full set of one armor give better benefits?
---
What happens in Beast Form stays in Beast Form
---
This would be great atleast for the rarer weapons such as radium rifle, handmade and lever.
---
It just says fire rate, I assumed it was rpm. Either way, my handmade rifle with somewhere around 90 fire rate is faster than the Resolute Veteran.
---
Sorry.....same as name
---
Oh I see, you see anyone who disagrees with you as a hater. Isn't that kind of childish?
---
I've not been talking about adding npc, I don't agree with them adding that so late on in the game. What I have a problem with is your stance on text chat and your weak af arguments against it that make zero sense.
---
You just reminded me that we need kill cams.
---
coughRandyPitchfordcough
---
That, plus rarer ones like dense toros mods or BOS combat armor mods too.
---
Thank you all for your feed. I can see how people would just complain after its bigger.
---
Still, that speedy receiver is a monster.
---
Maybe there is a slight chance it's possible that he knew both and was holding a Marine plan. Tiny chance lol but hopefully people can come through who definitely know one or the other and you can all check. I'm sure as hell on the edge of my seat lol
---
I hope so.

Dolly soda campgrounds workshop has 3 wood extractors of you want to just get it without much work.

---
This time 4 tries. Last time i was getting in first try but my challenge pal called me to his server where he already did it. First time took a good 10 tries to figure out the route.
---
One thing i learned is that you need to refresh the hound's aggro. Basically once every 100/150 meters you need to crouch and engage again. It will do his cry and will follow you again. If you try in one swoop you hardly reach half way.
---
Before i knew that silo codes expire on mondays. I went to charlie prepped for nuke to find out there was no code... ended up going to bravo and alpha to do the same thinking it was just me. So technically i was at the point where you type the code on each
---
That mutagenic waste isn't going to clean itself.
---
Mine is shooting only around once every .75 second.
---
This comment deserves +karma
---
Sure, why the heck not. Need help in the silo?
---
When Todd say all online game have issue at launch he is quite right...
---
I didnt test all online game of course, but I am an mmo player since a long time and all I have tried were dommed at launch
---
Dark age of camelot, Anarchy Online, Wow, Tabula rasa, Aion, Conan, Eso ... all of them had really difficult time at start... some are dead now, but some are still here, decades after.
---
So... yes, personnaly I wasn't expect much from f76 at start.
---
We need to see what's coming next
---
Well, in the interview he mentions that people from Rockville have also been working on 76 as well. Its hard to say whats going on with Starfield right now and if it will effect 76 at all though.
---
Yeah ive noticed that my automatic faster fire rate handmade goes no where near 500, maybe they are displayed differently between different guns.
---
Sure...can always use help
---
With a lot of luck you might possibly find one at the asylum maybe.
---
Bro you on xbox? I‚Äôll sell you all of these!
---
Itll be perfect!! The richest will have them! Why no?!
---
Can I get some? üòÖ
---
Actually a really cool idea, pick a loadout, area restricted based on level, all players and camps hostile, that would be really fun to organise raids and such this way
---
If you're dependant on your PA, why not ditch it in favour of a backpack? With the right perk setup and legendary armour you can carry vastly more than even the excavator allows. 
---
I only really wear my PA to safely traverse cliffs these days. Sprinting is a requirement for my enjoyment!
---
But that was after about 3,000 tickets of crap. Don't give up lol that was the point of my post
---
I saw that one too!  I took a pic of that also.  Very cool how the mood can change in the turn of a corner in this game.  Looting and pillaging a cave, all is normal, turn a corner and see that scene.  Some cam make you stop in your tracks and soak it in for a min or two.  Totally changes the environmental mood of that cavern.
---
This is off topic, but anyone have the stone benches plan or know where to get it? I sell bulk acid lately but the alcohol plans, mounted head plans, formula p plans, all been selling good. The outfits from technical documents too. Fach plans kind of dried up, but already sold most of them.
---
Mine cranks them out at least 1/second, but definitely not 500/min. 
---
I think it is something like the receiver itself is able to do that, but you‚Äôre limited by something else on the gun. Kind of like having a hunting rifle that has a high ROF, but crap ammo capacity.
---
....However, the ammo for the Gatling negates this theory.
---
Does anyone have any photographic evidence of Todd not wearing that jacket? I‚Äôm starting to think it has magical properties like dr strange‚Äôs cloak or Excalibur‚Äôs sheath
---
You still get a fare share of dicknoses on PC.  
---
Had one guy wail on me because I was in a vendor window and he wanted to use it.  Told me he needed it and to get off now or else.  I had just opened the window, but I guess he's more important.
---
I was in Pacifist, so I told him I'll take as long as I want while he kept hitting me and calling me every name in the book.
---
Perused the wares, got a drink, went to the bathroom, got a snack.  Came back and he's going  crazy.  Telling me he's going to find me and kill me blah blah blah.
---
So I just stayed in that window until he eventually left.
---
I was ready to close the window when he first arrived but he started his shit.  He needed a lesson.
---
It doesn't matter what platform, there are people that care all consumed by a gamer rage.
---
Agree, and if you werent aware BOS plans can be bought for around 100 caps each from vendors cant remember the name but its the one in toxic valley.
---
Explosives are nowhere near as powerful as they used to be. And also there are already turrets with explosive rounds in game.
---
Yeah, it's *gotta* be something like that. I'm not sure off the top of my head what the fire rate is on the LMG, but it's definitely not 500 and that thing fires so fast it's a wonder the bullets aren't hitting each other.
---
NO NO NO NO NO, do you want to ruin the game? Cuz thats how you ruin the game.
---
lol, I guess I miscommunicated. What I was asking was, where in the building menu did you see them. My bad. When I was looking for them, I didnt see them in the menu. But glad you showed proof they exist tho. Now I know what im gonna do when I get home from work tonight.
---
Travel to Greg's Mine Supply and walk over.
---
Nice üòé
---
I think it will make the game better and make all the old players come back
---
imo single star bloodied weapons are not worth more than 500 caps. Sure, bloodied weapons are good, but noone is going to pay 1000 caps+ for it. If it would be Bloodied Explosive or Bloodied Fire Rate+, that's where it gets it in the thousands.
---
Thats just my opinion of course, y'know.
---
That makes sense. I was mostly wondering if everybody else's was firing at the same rate as mine or if I needed to do something more.
---
Yeah I found that out a bit later haha.
---
On my way to you now! I know it‚Äôs awesome
---
I'm super nervous to try an uninstall but let me see if there is anything else I can try before resorting to that.
---
Are you a troll or do you really think so? Honest question.
---
Lmao that‚Äôs a pretty good way to teach him a lesson. It‚Äôs definitely not perfect by any means but on average a lot nicer. I still remember my first 5 minutes out of the vault there was a level 92 I ran into and he just gave the come here emote and dropped a bag of stuff. When I looked in I was shocked to see 96 stimpacks and 500 bullets it definitely helped get through the miserable early game when you get crippled every other hit.
---
Thanks for a serious answer
---
What do you people do?  Pick up and keep everything you come across?
---
My stash hasn't gotten above 650 since the increase.
---
1200
---
PvP is broken in many ways in this game, yes.
---
If your looking for pistol ammo I might have you covered. I left a couple thousand rounds of 38/45 in the fist overseeers camp so I‚Äôll see what‚Äôs left. 
---
Xb1 gt:Gr8dne42 mostly late nights
---
Havent  you ever heard of pay to win?? Either you have and youre an idiot, or youre ignorant to this concept and don't realise that ideas and implications of ideas like this are one of the things that break games.
---
Yes yes, I know that haha But those who do speak (and understand) would more than likely be ***playing*** it in English, yes? So I would not imagine they'd be impacted much...
---
No, I meant for all of those who *don't*, and are playing the game in their native language.
---
Bethesda definitely doesn't do sufficient patch testing on their end, as I expect 10 mins with the game set to another language, that big of an error would've **easily** been caught! Quite sad things are they way they are. It's stuff like this that makes me think my joke of there only being 4 people working on 76, might actually be true! :(
---
I don't play the game in that kind of ruthless Vault-Tec style. _We're all in this together_, and antagonistic players are rare in this game. Locking water purifiers is just a waste, those things generate water so fast that theft would only be an inconvenience to you if you never left your camp. If you're gone for 10 minutes they've already refilled. Nobody is gonna ask for water when the Dying of Thirst emote costs atoms and hardly anyone uses a mic
---
In regards to the locked doors for enemies I have a double pressure plate switch on a powered door. Easier than a hinge door to use as well, shuts itself
---
Yeah 20 caps might be high, gonna lower it to 15. They've sold at 20 before in bulk but they're taking up too much space and need to go
---
If you‚Äôve ever played android iOS games like castle clash it eventually makes players leave the game
---
Fort defience
---
Initially I thought losing CAMP destruction in Survival was a pure negative‚Äîbut it is kind of logical to have a sort of safe zone. If you build right you can have just that. So, it‚Äôs grown on me. 
---
Still, either turrets shouldn‚Äôt attack players who aren‚Äôt in PvP with the owner or they should be destructible. If CAMP protection is something they want in Survival, there‚Äôs no reason they couldn‚Äôt leave other objects safe while not protecting turrets.
---
This has happened to me at level 20-30. I‚Äôll be sitting at my workshop basically just running back and forth collecting clean food, junk, etc then scroll through social media waiting for everything to fill up. 
---
Only happened twice but once it was a level 200+ came down and killed the level 10 me and level 20 maybe friend I had. He did end up taking the camp but after he already said this camp meant nothing to him as he already had everything. 
---
Recently was level 30 and had a level 150+ come and kill me out of nowhere (literally jump scared as he came up behind me and just whacked me and killed me instantly) and then just left. Taking absolutely nothing. Never understood it
---
Welcome home.
---
I think spending 100 dollars on a 5 star weapon would be the best investment ever. Id by atleast 4. You dont think its a good idea?
---
The reason i need a lot of purified water is because i use it for crafting diluted stimpaks , radway etc i burn through all that in hours of sessions. Is not because i dont want people stealing it. I normally go around low levels and give them free water , chems, aid and ammo. I sell stims for 10 a piece and they sell pretty well
---
If you are on xbox ill give you a green one.have a few and they dont sell for much i see them all the time for 1k in vendors
---
I post mine for whatever the default price is.  The value of anything in this game is all about personal choice.  I don't see any value in most bloodied items because I don't play bloodied.  The ease at which you can limit out on caps also makes the demand prices pretty wild as well.  I am typically near the cap limit, so my prices are generally pretty low.
---
I'm not overly upset with 800 lbs of Stash.   Not with the backpack and the myriad of ways to reduce carry weight.
---
Camp Building Budget ..... yeah, I want that doubled.  There are a lot of creative players (not sure why so many lock their doors, their isn't anything to steal) who love to build .... it's one of the things that a very large proportion of FO4 loved about the settlements.  C.A.M.P. is settlement Ultra-Light.
---
On my way
---
What exactly is broken though? Do my weapons do too much damage? Is it because of level difference? Because just now I had a fight with a level 110 and a level 191, me being 187. And they both basically oneshot me while I couldn't do any damage.
---
Around morgan town station , or flatwoods you can have nice spots.
---
Yup. Had that happen to me a couple of times. Joke was on them, because I frequently dump my stuff. One guy, I guess was hoping to pick up my brown bag after killing me, and found there wasn't one. I saw him hanging around my workshop, so I decided to troll the troll by waiting a bit before going back, and let him kill me. After the 4th time, he got on mic to cuss me out for not having crap on me for him to take.
---
Nope, and yes the shocks are working... X-01 just has much less carry weight. I found those plans for sale in the medical wing at the white springs bunker! Super pumped cuz I‚Äôd love to run my x-01 stuff more. Just saving up caps to buy it, and that pesky violet flux!!! Someone please nuke harpers ferry please please please!!! Lol
---
Anywhere more east?
---
It‚Äôs a good point, I think I‚Äôll focus less on strength. More on perception for combat and other specials to make crafting and survival easier.
---
Did it ever do that? I don't get wanted often so I wouldn't know
---
This accounts a entire troll account lol
---
You can still be attacked while in pacifist, but you can't be hurt by someone else without activating PVP with them first. However, you are automatically flagged for PVP when you take a workshop, or someone attacks your workshop. The problem is, pacifist isn't turned off, so you can then be killed while unable to fight back...
---
What‚Äôs the specific weapon your using. There‚Äôs still a damage bug for pvp I think.  My bloodied Farman ones shots about half the time. The other half has the bug
---
I found the majority of my collection when I was heavily farming for junk and straight jackets at Fort Defiance. I think I received maybe one or two from events that I can't recall the name of. One was gifted to me by a friend who didn't want it.
---
Unfortunately, I can't wear them anymore. I creep way too many people out by walking up to them as a female medic billowing in a males voice. The extended, awkward silence is entertaining for only the first few times.
---
Thanks for the suggestion.
---
I‚Äôm gonna to lean more into sneak and combat skills. Less in strength and melee.
---
Reasonable price only happens to reasonable buyers. A noob will spend 5k on a three star suppressors SMG with bash damage, and keeps wondering why his ‚Äòbuild‚Äô can‚Äôt kill sh*t. A seasoned player won‚Äôt hesitate to pay 2K for a one starred Bloodied Handmade and use it to quietly one-shot most creatures. Noobs count stars, veterans look for primary effects. Bloodied ranged weapons are pretty rare and highly effective, don‚Äôt let it go cheap if you found one.
---
You can still kill them with radiation from Nuka Grenades, slowly.
---
Saw a dude today who had marine combat helmets in his vending machines for 2000 bucks. Guess he never actually sells them. I sell them for 150 each. I tought the dudes with 1k serums and original priced plans where greedy as fuck, but the marine helmet dude was the icying on the cake.
---
I played dark orbit for years and spent over 2k USD on the game! Still wasnt the strongest and the added shop content never broke the game. Just made it better! Some people play for years and get the best gear for free. But what if I didnt play for years and just joined the game??? It would take years to get these high lvl items. Well I introduce the Item shop where players can simply spend money on things like gear and weapons and in a few minutes become stronger than players who spent decades on the game. That would make this game 100x better! You dont think so!?! Plus it will make BGSG even richer so they can release even more powerfull stuff to the shop!
---
I do mine at site alpha, the only issue is a bear that spawns, but easy to manage.
---
Simple fix.
---
Step 1. Move you camp. Do not build anything in the new spot. Spot should be in another One ( ie forestire,bog, divide).
---
Step 2 exit the get completely. Power down your unit. Go outside and play in the sun for 60 min ( sun optional).
---
Step 3 log back into the game. Move camp to another location.
---
Step 4 repeat steps 2 and 3 3 more times.
---
Step 5. Move camp final time. Logout and log in. Rebuild camp from scratch not from stored blueprint.
---
It's a Mutation.
---
For free?
---
So is it just survival that has the issue?
---
Yep - well known and lots of photos out there but very welcome to see more! The blast doors do open.
---
Found this post through google. Came here to ask someone help me get the Revive portion done. Will gladly return the favor. 
---

---
Xbox one
---
Go to the market
---
I got in a situation where every single piece could not be removed.  Had to move camp and start over :/
---
oof
---
I've done the whole altruism thing to low levels, but you never know if you're helping an actual new player or just topping up an alt account's supplies
---
Snacks to die for!
---
I posted it there too.
---
Op sorry to hear about the frustration. Not sure if you play solo adventure. But I also get my ass handed to me most of the time I take a workshop.  Most times I took and defended the ammo factory I had a low level probe me and a 100+ finish me. Ended up converting to melee since I couldn‚Äôt feed a gun. 
---
Hope you have good summer gaming wherever you end up. If you looking for someone to roam the wastelands with look me up. Xb1 gt Gr8dne42 most late nights.
---
Ooooh, in a ring so that the rocket travels through it? Nice.
---
Because everyone reads random statements put out by the developers before they pre-order a game.
---
Yeah, confirmed, the serum gravy train has left the station. Scrap at 1 each, or less if you bulk, will fly off your shelves.  
---
 Cryolator Ammo, 1c each would be nice earner, rare that this ammo is priced right.  
---
 Excavator armor + Superduper, Lucky Hole for Crystal and Lead, Vault 63 for iron. Acid is the bottleneck for this. Alternatively, Steel from scrapping guns at West Tek, Lead from the gym in Firestation and 3 Silos would reduce the acid outlay.
---
Had to replace camp two times today due to two bugs, one where foundations ended up interlocked and impossible to remove, and another where you cannot remove items placed under water surface
---
Will gladly help out but won't be on till later.  Perhaps someone will be able to help out sooner.
---
There‚Äôs a cap stash near my place that I loot once a week and however many caps are in it, that‚Äôs what I set my prices at for standard 1-3* gear. Every weapon and armor piece has been set at 78 caps for the last few days and I‚Äôve made about 3k.
---
Its really not. Honestly I think we should just have emotes and get rid of Voice chat as well but then alot of people would get mad so lets just keep it i guess...but just imagine running around the world and the only way to contact people is using emotes!! Would honestly be the best game ever
---
If they have healing factor they will heal during PvP conflict. If they have sentinels or assassin's armor they won't take much damage.
---
What you want is to hit them a lot. Single hard hits won't get through the armor. You need multiple shots. So automatics are pretty good at that.
---
You want every AntiArmor thing you can get on your gun.
---
Agree to disagree
---
I thought the exact process was that you are flagged for PVP with someone if they take your workshop while you are in its boundaries? Before patch 9.5 (or 9?) it was accross the whole map.
---
I had a great set up (I think lol) in one of the houses in Charleston, but I moved recently and since I've been back I cannot fit any benches, or even decorations because they teleport to the roof. I shouldn't have to glue things down with rubber mats. It just looks stupid. 
---
Sort it out guys lol.
---
Actually I think they should lower the stash limit. Its wayyyY too high! I think 100 stash limit is good tbh
---
Yep - serums are down to 400\~500 caps. I've actually bought them for 250 but you can sell them back to a vendor bot for 430 caps or so with Hard Bargain maxed, so that's not sustainable.
---
And worthless. The stash space/weight limit/call budget are fine as they stand. Yes there can be inprovements. But tbh, if people quit building large structures that they can't fill up then it's an issue on the player not o mechanics.
---
If people have an issue with hording, it's not mechanics it mental. Ditch the stuff it's not going to get better , learn how to manage what you NEED over what you want.
---
Caps not gonna beet this dead horse again
---
Just burn it and be done with it.
---
The regenerating health thing is a bug that has been reported since launch. It has happened to me many times too, and I don't really know what causes it. But in a PvP scenario, having your enemies constantly regenerating HP is just an unplayable experience.
---
PvP has many, many issues, not just that. Balance is completely non-existent, uncontrolled high ping and variable ping players leads to lag for everyone and hit registration issues, invisibility glitches, invincibility glitches, VATS itself, stuttering, respawning making you completely exposed until the worlds decides to load... well, I could go on and on for days. It's clear that Bethesda isn't experienced at all in PvP, but they still rushed out Survival for some reason... and now practically no one plays that.
---
This is a fallout 76 sub. Not dark orbit. different game. And I know I'm not alone, at least 80% of everyone on this sub will agree with me. And 2k on a game? You are an idiot. That is all.
---
I habe my perm base in white spring
---
Can't say coloured, but people of colour is fine lol.
---
HONK HONK!!
---
Lmao OP posted this then went mimi's he's gonna wake up to a nice shitpost...
---
A very cool idea. Legitimately original and interesting.
---
I think this kind of idea would really shine in some events, where fodder players would be able to respawn a few times throughout the event. 
---
How about a little skill-tree for each kind of fodder enemy? Engagements would reward XP for the skill-tree associated with the enemy type that you are. Those skill-trees would be more about trade-offs than just making your character better. 
---
Some examples: 
---
* Extra health or defense instead of aid items.
---
* Gear options that tilt your defenses either towards energy or damage resistance. 
---
* Weapon options that fit the enemy type.
---
* A defensive aura that buffs nearby mobs, or the ability to revive mobs on a cooldown. 
---
* An offensive aura that buffs weapon accuracy of nearby mobs, or increased weapon accuracy.
---
These are just a few examples, but it feels like there could be a bunch more. There could be specific options for different mob types, like the ability to spawn as a Super Mutant Suicider. All of these options would be random until the player levels up their skill-tree enough to be able to make choices.
---
I have mutations and i don't even bother with radx. I simply pop in a radaway as needed. The rads you get while in PA are very minimal, i need a radaway every like 10min or so. I favorited them so makes it very very easy to just pop one in while I'm running or even fighting.
---
Oh yeah - one more thing - that special helmet originally only found in the dev room? I bought one recently only because I had heard that it offered some DMG to the head, unlike all other helmets. Unfortunately that's been nerfed so I scrapped it. Now I just use a beanie or baseball cap...

I now know how I ended up punk during Faschnacht. Something something Berry Mentats.

Fine kill 500 glowing ones. reward is 10 atoms

What types of challenges are you struggling with?

You‚Äôve found the matrix-
---
The thing that annoys me most with nukes in this game is they slam into the ground before they detonate. That doesn't happen IRL, they detonate high in the air to maximise destructive potential (if it's on the ground, the earth absorbs 50% of the blast).
---
I though this was common knowledge, but apparently the devs of a video-game literally centred on nuclear war fallout don't understand basic knowledge of atom bombs.
---
lmao
---
Well. I would leave enemy loot drops as is, just change the in world resources.

I get around 30 rounds in 10 seconds with the faster mod

Atleast that ya know... a challenge

Plans, magazines and bobbleheads all weights a pound a piece at least for my where they should only be .10 or nothing. I've got about 45 pounds in all

Yeah they are a pain to find and id rather help people get one. I normally buy them if i see them cheap at player vendors
---
368 hours. Only one character, level 193. Been playing since day one of the Beta.
---
I know that the CAMP stash and Vendor for sale inventory is linked for a reason but, I wish Bethesda would re-think that reason. I REALLY like having a ton of stuff to sell and spend much time shuffling things around so that I can. The expense is my toon being way over encumbered, hopelessly so. I'd be happy with a reduced CAMP stash limit to say 500 and an 800 net vendor limit.
---
You there ?
---
About to launch actually
---
Fun fact: If you stand on the blast doors as they are opening to let the nuke out you fall in and the doors close on top of you, essentially trapping you in a small room until you fast travel away. The nuke doesnt kill you on the way out.
---
I have almost all the weight reduction perks also. 
---
Hows the damage resist?
---
If youre server hopping for the armor dont take the cores out or when you hop the frame will be empty.
---
Or you can run with two fall damage reduction legs for 0 fall damage.
---
Oh i would love to get one on PC :D
---
I got stuck in three sets of foundations in one session yesterday. Tres annoying.
---
This would be so much fun. Small xp rewards maybe. Hell let me be a horde event.
---
There's a whole little area up between Top of the World and Site Alpha, full of cute little streams and small bodies of water. I put my base where the brahmin spawn. ‚ô°
---
I'd pay cash for a max 3* tse 50 cal machine gun. I can't seem to get lucky with drops or caps. Never had any kind of tse. After a while you just get desperate.
---
Nuka-Cola machines predominantly, although the Kanawha Nuke Plant has plenty scattered around. Not as many as you'd expect, but plenty. I keep a good stock of both Nuka and Stims and so always have the Thru-Hiker perk on. I never run low on either because I can pick up as many as I want as they have very little weight. Got about 120 standard Nuka, 120 Cherry and 50 quantum
---
I have launched from all three in one sitting.  It didn't do anything.  I thought the overseer was killed by a mole miner.  The last holo was outside a small cottage I think.
---
Ps4 player here, but curious... what event??
---
Also scrip is currency the legendary purveyor out in Berkeley station uses. 
---
You trade in any unwanted legendary at scrip machine at any train station for max of 150 per day. Max 1000 total per player.
---
Then you go visit the legendary purveyor and pay her with scrip.
---
You pay per star and type of legendary. For example 60 scrip for 3* armor.... or 100 scrip for 3* melee weapon. 
---
Then purveyor randomly returns a 3* of that type. It would essentially be any type of armor. So no way to choose between marine or wood. No way to choose which legendary effects either. It will all be randomly generated. But it at least guarantees the amount of stars and type, increases the odds of you getting that one piece you been searching for.
---
Way to delete a humorous post mods . So proud
---
I'd say it's fine as is. It's an auto launcher. If there was a buff to its durability it would be broken as f---.
---
I've got a 2shot legendary and some times it is annoying to have it break quickly, but fir what it is, it makes sense.
---
I‚Äôll give you 500 caps for it
---
Dude this is so cool! Now that adventure and survival has been separated the community in this game rocks! Running in to a random high level player who is just bored and messing around can change your game experience for good. When I was level 20 or
---
So I had a random 200+ guy follow me around dropping serums, plans and recipes and it honestly made my life so much easier trying to level up. Level 90+ now and loving it, once I get all I want, I‚Äôll spend my end game dropping cool shit on lower levels
---
Nah, it was 400, went to 600, then to 800
---
Exactly that one. Bought it from another player vendor for 150 caps and scrapped it. Learned the plan this way. Now i sell them for 149 caps. They go away pretty fast. I run around in a full marine armor set, so the helmet is a must have for me. ;)
---
GT ?
---
So Im the only one that gives them away because the challenges require it and I want the wasteland to look good? I've given a white, red and pink away so far. Brown is the only one I thought looked good.

Walk over to the elevator. If the button is green, activate the button and and make it go back to yellow. Then get in the elevator and try to use it. üëåüèª

Works all the time for me.

You can just have it i have alot of caps lol. I be on later tonight
---
Well no... not for serums. You can take serums any time and the game shows that you've gotten the mutation.
---
I'd rather not have microtransactions ruin this game even more.

My favorite camp location was just south of the South Mountain Lookout tower, east of Watoga. It's beautiful there and just about 12 caps travel from Whitesprings, 6 to that train station no one goes to, and maybe 8 caps to Watoga. There's no water, but it's a stunning Vista and the watchtower spawns mid-level scorched for xp/loot. On the cliffs edge there's a remnant of a camp, in which there's a duffel bag that 4 separate times spawned a Gatling laser. It's e light out of the way that you don't get many visitors, but still close to several points of interest and of course traders.
---
thx for explanations :)
---
 Don't feed the troll.
---
Its very annoying. Actually the most annoying aspect of this game. Bethesda needs to fix it quick. If you kill someone you should not be able to take their caps. I lost about 300 caps in one night just being killed over and over again.
---
Fo4 perks were total shit also. I would buy interesting perks for atoms all day long.
---
...or they make a choice based on visual impact and fun
---
_Hmm, whatever could have happened..._
---
Do you have a max 3* TSE 90% RW Gatling Gun?
---
uhhhh, so I tried the camera thing again, because I wanted to try to start completing the tadpol scout missions and it seems to freak out when you look at the ground period. 
---
so I don't know if it's the interloper effect or that the camera is just bugged now.
---
Invest in some perks like bloodied mess, nerd rage, or the serum adrenal reaction even if you are not a bloodied build.
---
I honestly can't be bothered. It's much easier to gift a new player with a nice little starter pack to suck them in. I trade with a few regulars and also in the forums with stuff far more valuable for the most part to he bothered. I'm certainly never hurting for caps at any rate.

I have all the mutations (except herbivore) and the appropriate perks to match but I think mutations should be MUCH harder to acquire and have much bigger drawbacks.

It just works.

I just hit the big 5-0 last week and it's a wonderful feeling! Even more so to realize that you're really just getting into the funüòé this game and its community is absolutely amazing! I can't wait to see where itll all be in the future! Cheers to the beginning friendüçª
---
My bank account begs to differ with you.
---
The *right* ones will sell for over 1000 caps, but *most* items aren't  worth that much.
---
Other players can't harm your pets anymore unless they're in PVP against you.
---
Though your pet is still going to die eventually from the wide variety of other stuff that can kill them. Like glitches and enemies that spawn at your camp when it's FT'd to.
---
hopefully they will add an account wide 200lb mailbox before they bump it to 1000
---
Sounds like your enemies have sentinel or cavalier armor. Basically each piece reduces damage by 15%. If they have 5 pieces, thats 75% reduction. So them healing can be a visual bug essentially. You open fire and on your end game thinks you did 500dmg, so health is reduced, but eventually once it uploads to server and sees the 75% reduction, recalculates the damage done and health meter goes back up since no damage was actually done.
---
So let's say you had 1000damage, 75% reduction means only 250 is all your doing. Even then if player has 400+ damage resistence, then you can't event penetrate their armor.
---
If you intend to PvP, you really need PvP gear and knowledge to counteract said gear. For example it's my understanding that weapons that stagger can counteract this. Since sentinel for example needs to remain still for 75% reduction effect, you stagger them, they move and lose that buff and your weapon will do more dmg.
---
I wish I lived where you live. I‚Äôm close to LAX and the DMV office I got to is 2 hour wait IF you have an appointment (which must be scheduled at least a month in advance), and 4-6 if you don‚Äôt. These are normal waiting times unfortunately.
---
I dumped my Ultracite PA plans, you get a full crafted set and all the plans from doing the main Brotherhood quests, which most people with the spare caps to spend on the plans wouldn't need

Sorry for the long awaited reply, my internet doesnt always work. I'm on xbox

Would‚Äôve been a missed opportunity but he‚Äôd actually have call out for help for you to revive him. He probably wouldn‚Äôt have done that. :)

I had a couple of different run-ins with high level players being jerky this weekend. I ended my playing this morning with someone friendly so it all balanced out, but it did remind me of one of the reasons I usually stick to myself.
---
Aww man thanks for letting me know.
---
You can build a floating base right now that doesnt take damage.. just build a 1x1 foundation and stairs...
---
Welcome to two months ago :)
---
Oh - you learn the plan from it? I didn't know. I run a full set of BOS Combat armor. Two pieces chameleon, and all pieces originally ultra-lightweight, but now deep pocketed. I just finally got the armored backpack plan so lost 30 carry weight but with the pockets I'm back to 300. Happy days.
---
Isn‚Äôt that literally escape from Tarkov? Also sidenote, the whole premise of Vault 51 and Nuclear Winter is based around PVP, IE eliminating other teams and being the last people standing, not just surviving, so I would say this isn‚Äôt likely. It could be an extra mode though
---
Some Burning Ring of Fire from Johnny Cash while its happening.   Social Distortion's version is pretty good too.

[Johnny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=It7107ELQvY) or [Social D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BaksqH2YXQ).
---
Yep silo doors open, you can stand on them and they lift you up. You can step inside, the door can close on you and you can get stuck and have to fast travel, some complete idiot (me) once did that.
---
Also, you know that targeting tcompter you used to launch said nuke? Directly behind it, other side of glass is the missile you are launching. You can actually backtrack to that room (circular room before launch room) and get your ass completely cooked, some moron (me) did that too. 
---
Weirdly flames from missile when stood on silo (outside) don't hurt, flames from missile when stood inside silo, insta-death.
---
missed it dang
---
That and you can go to the list of places left to be photographed, take a photo and see if the quest pops up. 
---
I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôve repaired the camera as that‚Äôs the first step.
---
Awesome fight thanks for letting me know. That queen just melted!
---
Achieveble
---
The problem is everybody thought they was about BETA. That BETA would be rough, but they'd be ironing things out. Little did we realize they intended that statement to be the full game.
---
It's a game about survival in wasteland... your'e supposed to feel the pain....
---
In any case, give it time. It gets easier as you level up. The right perk cards and gear will go a long way. For example some perks help by mitigating damage, increasing damage output on weapons, reducing radiation or disease taken.
---
Some perk cards help with manufacturing your own supplies. Like Chemist, for 2x the chems. Ammo smith, makes more bullets and super duper for chance to 2x anything you craft. 
---
Early on you will die a lot. It's part of the game. You'll eventually get the hang of things and everything will be a breeze. If the quest is currently to tough, try taking a step back and explore other areas. Do some side quests or world events. Level up a bit and gather supplies and then give it another go.
---
Some will even wait until you are in the process of building to sneak up and contest workshop. That way you have no time to react.
---
 Why creative use of signs and letters.
---
Yeah....that was an awesome fight...thanks for the help...might do another one in a bit
---
I have 40% weapon weight reduc in gear atm, its pretty good haha.  I don't mind using a stat in a 3 star legendary for weight reduction, even more because I'm strictly pve in this game.   Yeah I would rather that perfect 3 star armor, but its pretty hard to come by.  
---
That being said.  Bethesda has some cool stuff to work with when it comes down to the other stars that aren't being used in our legendary's.  For example, we could have a way to accumulate some sort of currency.  We than use that currency to purchased a weight reduction stat to our legendary.  It could be a random weight reduction stat, or maybe we get to choose.  Either way I feel there is some cool stuff that could be implemented.  Than for pvpers, they could maybe choose pvp stats for their legendary's and become even more godlike.
---
I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess they already have this idea for when clans come into play.  For when you join Brotherhood of Steel or whichever, you gain points towards that clan, than use those points to purchased an extra stat for your legendary.  At least something along those lines.
---
&gt;When Todd say all online games have issue at launch, he is quite right...
---
The problem is a majority of the bugs and issues stemmed back to Fallout 4. If it were just bugs related to online code/changes that'd be one thing, but half the bugs were from four years prior.
---
Snallygasters do that as well if you headshot them as they start to turn around.
---
Thank you, im just not used to how they‚Äôve changed it so drastically.
---
Before vending came out I could only ever find serums at the Enclave for 3600, so when they were in people's camps for 1k each I'd snap them right up. These days, not so much. And only partly because I have 90% of the mutations
---
Has anyone ever played Vigor? Its basically like this and a ton of fun! It's a game preview on xbox! You go into what is seemingly a battle royal but you dont necessarily have to kill anyone but the object is to get back with supplies and such to build up your safe house. Theres a storm pushing you and a time limit in and out! Its intense and a blast just low budget and slow development as a result. But the mechanics would work wonderful in fallout if that's what it sort of ended up being. I'm all for a new mode to take my never ending focus off the billion tasks I already have lol wasnt sure about BR but I love this ideaüëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº
---
agreed.   please make it 1k  at least
---
Ya I'm guessing he did not read the whole context of it.
---
I mean you can't say there wasn't any sign of a rough launch... I feel like this letter was heavily circulated by news outlets. I'm not defending the launch, I'm just saying they at least said something.
---
Gt: TheFooly64 add me. I get on frequently-ish and like lvl 66 down to do whatever lol
---
Alright , write back to me when your on
---
people hording 1k steel and wood in bulk
---
Healing factor doesn't work in combat. What he really needs is Crits. Crits melt everything, regardless of armor. Dodgy helps a lot in PVP, and Serendipity could turn the tables. Problem with Workshops is the people that take them aren't looking for PVP, they're mostly looking for resources. The people that contest Workshops are looking for PVP and are usually built as such.
---
Survival mide is still in beta so its hard to call something a failure if its not finished yet (although i do not personally play survival becauae of how broken it is)
---
I hate those fortnight houses...
---
You didn't lose ammo... Your gun is just unloaded. Have tested many times and not a single bullwt is lost
---
To be fair, they should have taken that as a sign the game shouldn't have been released. Seems more of a dick move to know a game wasn't ready for release only to release it. 
---
I predict seeing the general trend of making customers pay for the "privilege" of  alpha and beta testing games to continue, but with the addition of the "roadmap" keyword thrown in to appease the player base.
---
Yeah it takes some adjustment. I do strongly suggest taking your time though. Don't rush the main questline or you'll continue to have this problem the entire time. You'll need to explore and do world events to level up a bit before moving on in main questline. 
---
Try sticking to this level map. Get high enough lvl before moving into the next area and so on. Otherwise you'll tend to have problems. Ultimately though.... don't be afraid to die!

Maybe she was, but her mission was still to secure the 3 silos. I've also wondered what her last known communication was/ where it could be found.
---
"3 silos"?
---
Cool, anything strange happen that you noticed?
---
I feal ya on the wait times. I refuse to go to the DMV. I do it all online. When they asked what the problem was. I asked them this question
---
"Are you going to pay me to sit and wait in your line for an appointment that wasade in advance (3 weeks). Just to pay 35 to renew. Cause my hourly rate is 150.00 per hour and 75.00 per each question answered"
---
The repsone was "take a number, park it and send us the bill."
---
Total bill 1250.00 was payed by the city with a statement that they would fix the wait time. Once it was aired on the local news.
---
Now the wait times for an appointment is less than 15 min. Course the city had to take it a loan to pay for all the time wasted. That was 5 years ago. I have since given up on going to them and di it online. Takes me 10 min and it's mailed to me.
---
All of them to complete my collection. That‚Äôs pretty much all I have left to look forward to in this game.
---
P.A.P.E.T.A.!?
---
So, being unarmed what's the best for me ? I see several but I dont like how it takes - intellect or agility or others. Do they counter each other ?
---
I‚Äôm in my level on that map so that‚Äôs great, hope it gets easier cause being a mom and using this game to relax is not relaxing tbh.

Positive effect is an increase to energy damage through the art of keyboard warfare, negative effe t is faster malnutrition
---
Completely depends on the weapon. Bloodied pitchfork? I'll pay 100 caps and feed it to the legendary wood chipper. Handmade, lever action, grog axe, etc? I'd pay 1k each if I didn't already have them.
---
Doesn't happen to me in adventure. So yes would have to say in survival only.
---
I may be using this cliche in the wrong scenario. I'm thinking it is more likely kids who play Fallout 76 will be using consoles and mainly play Fortnite and are simply using the same gaming style 'Battle Royal kill everything at all cost' to this game. So they have no need or use of the workshops beyond killing whoever has claimed, they move on and keep killing everything all the time.
---
I never kill other players and often don't kill NPCs unless I need the resource (carnivore mutation), I spend much time just sneaking up to critters and invisibly watching them enjoying the atmosphere of the wastes :)
---
I do farm Whitespring for stuff but ghouls just need killing.
---
Camps in adventure cannot be destroyed anymore either. I'm sure it's just a bug they can't fix as far as survival goes. I really wanted to buy a weapon from a dude, snuck up with weapons holstered, and as I brought up the trade menu their rocket turret spotted me and blew me straight back to the vault. I just wanted to give that dude caps!
---
You understand that the only reason there isn't text chat is so that they can convince us to spend money on fucking emotes? In game gestures. No.
---
Go to Fort Defiance and take the elevator up to the 3rd floor. Check the beds in the two rooms up there, then check the bench in the bathroom. If you can't find any, server hop and keep on repeating this process until you go crazy, then find one on a fo76 trading page and pay around 5-12k caps for one. ‚ô° Just kidding about the last part but unless you wanna buy one off of someone, you'll have to server hop Fort Defiance for a while. I'm on a mad hunt for the pink one so I just server hop for a few hours until I find a colored one, then go back in 48hrs.
---
How did you get it?
---
I wear the rose dress! Running around in a pink dress and white heels through the wasteland just makes me feel good.
---
Why on earth would they do that?!
---
They're trolling you, probably amused when you ask them to stop. If u ignore them they don't get their jollies

Send this to the mod team
---
Posting here will just get you deleted again...

Who's dat?
---
They really need to lower the weight on stim packs.  I never thought of a Nuka-Cola as a replacement, interesting idea.   So I'm guessing you just pop a stim when a limb breaks, and than use your Cola's for everything else.  Pretty cool.
---
I really don't like that they are almost impossible without help. I like playing solo for a reason, and they've gotten too specific. I liked when they could naturally be done, not go to a specific place in a specific outfit at a specific time while eating a perfectly preserved pie while the other person dances with a radroach

If your on Xbox I can ship you a brown for free. Got lots of spares. Gt chnm88

I'm always struggling while trying to find something that I unlocked with a plan. It would make building a bit easier.

Yeah kinda like a massive alarm clock in the morning lol
---
The majority would say otherwise
---
Dont know I got a ts ffr auto launcher. That I've been useing now for over a month. And I go thru about 600 round before I even get below my 100%. Course I over repair to 200 and use gunsmith 5 all the time. Hvy weapons/ bear arms /pa build. No prob.

I've heard the Camp Decoration thing is just gonna be letting us fill up the display shelves, not place any item anywhere like the FO4 OC Decorator mod
---
You'll never find out, it may have been too short a title or some expletive that was flagged, when I get posts deleted it is usually the title was bending the rules a bit. I just re-post with a different title and check the body for obvious no-nos.

I have well over 500+ for sale right now... unfortunately, I am on PC.
---
Absolutely not.
---
It's not a sms like psn. It would be a server wide radio blast, all survivors would hear.
---
Mindlessly run through fort defiance over and over and over again.
---
Just to put it out there, FO4 also had loads of stuff on rooftops, places really quite high up too where some of the only ways to see them are with console commands or some crazy jet pack flying
---
When that starts I just take a small bathroom/snack break.  Make em wait a little longer. Or call in a friend to grab the vendor just as Im getting out so they have to wait even longer.
---
Damn

Yea howd ya doit?.  I got heat flash from the event the horde: mire anglers.
---
I‚Äôm on board with your suggestion for more food preservation techniques, there‚Äôs a lot of preservation methods that would be really interesting to see implemented in the game.
---
But your suggestion for the alcohol doesn‚Äôt make sense. All alcoholic drinks have to be fermented for an extended period of time in order for the alcohol to be produced so none of it should be ready ‚Äòright away‚Äô the only thing the fermentor in 76 does is speed this up. 
---
But there is a very good case to be made for implementing new recipes for the food items that would allow for them to become preserved in order to extend the time before they spoil. It doesn‚Äôt make sense that things like cranberry relish or jam go bad so quickly when they‚Äôre shown as canned preserves. 
---
A canning bench would definitely be a great workshop addition.
---
Double Yield on pistols would really, really help the pistol builds.  An Intigating Western coupled with a Executioners Single Action, or a Bloodied/Vampire combo ....

But yeah ... Pistols generally annoy me far before I can get anywhere with them.

I'd argue the reason survival isn't good for pvp is because of legendaries and Vats. If those were removed it'd be a lot more balanced. Hopefully this game mode removes at least legendaries from the picture.
---
Yeah I remember the struggles for real. Now I almost own every plan. So not so big a problem anymore. 
---
But I must say, sometimes I don‚Äôt even know what plans I‚Äôm selling to people.

They could also just add the right description for the items. So that not every table is named ‚Äútable‚Äù.

Would help out a whole lot

Marine and Combat Armor dense torso plans are named the same. It also seems that learning one makes it impossible to learn the other.
---
Exactly a precise description for each plan would be great!
---
Ppl dont always target the eyebombs... But when they do its right next to me!
---
Nailed it. Just big, dull, empty, 4-storey boxes. With locked doors to their empty bedrooms and crafting rooms with the basic broken-glass wood door
---
Cheers thx, must check it out.
---
anyone have hardened and glowing mass they want to sell 
---
on the same sever?
---
I'm not going to read through all of this, even the first few sections include many things that were already fixed a while ago. Where the hell are you getting this from?
---
Looking for that myself...lol
---
Oh okay! I didn‚Äôt realize it worked that way. Thanks!!
---
So in Adventure, when using player vendor machines, do the turrets not attack you? I mean what's the scenario where someone gets to just use all the camps and vendors on their server. I still haven't been able to use a single camp vendor and one person used mine, then tried to leave and got executed. I had to completely turn my turrets around to save lives.
---
&gt;It did not infringe on any of the rules so you have some explaining to do
---
Actually, no, they don't.  They can enforce the rules, or not, as they see fit.  They don't owe you an explanation any more than they owe you the right to post here at all.
---
If you feel that your post was removed in a way that wasn't following the subreddit guidelines, you're welcome to *politely* have a discussion with them, or to accept their decision and move on with your life.  Other options will probably result in you learning a valuable lesson in 'free speech'.
---
I ignored some dude who was stabbing me for over 10-15 minutes before he stopped following me around Whitespring, I eventually took off all my clothes and walked away in my undies as he kept stabbing doing no damage but then he disappeared, some people are just plain weird.
---
How many? I have two bulk plus about 150 loose. I'll be on after my boys little league game...7ish est
---
B.Mentats work like that? I was doing Hunter/Hunted Mode and mine were not displaying the other player no matter what, even when we engaged.
---
You shut your whore mouth you communist. I mean that in the best possible way.
---
I agree with you. I got one of my characters with no mutations and she's still powerful.
---
I was clicking the start button on the preview. .then notice the link is from imgur üòë
---
I keep my camp in the forest just for this reason. Everything in my vendor cost either nothing or next to nothing. So far no one has abused it too and I‚Äôve been there for quite some time.
---
Oh shit, I've never even tried to kill one. Might have to remember that avenue.
---
Any place that you mention here there will be 5 other players whom read it and the will move there too. On the side of a mountain a player creatively put arrows pointing to a sleeping bag partly glitched showing from the mountain side. Lay on it and you enter a room leading to other rooms hidden inside of the mountain. Water? South of Top of the world is plenty of water
---
I mean it‚Äôs both really. They aren‚Äôt all air burst and have differing mechanisms, such as the US W88 being able to be contact or airburst. From my understanding it comes down more to if you want a bigger collateral damage, 50/50 ‚Äúbomb‚Äù to ‚Äúnuke.‚Äù 
---
 Where as airbursts happen anywhere from 30km to the point where the explosion won‚Äôt touch the ground. This I think spreads radiation further and acts as an emp in a way, but the destruction is generally less scaled because it‚Äôs not even at a contact point from the distance in the first place.
---
Lol. You commie pinko
---
Lol must've been really bored or something
---
Someone building next to WS station.  Woooooow. So edge. Much original.
---
Idk it seems like it‚Äôs the collapse of capitalism and communism of all old world values and institutions. There wasn‚Äôt exactly any winners in the nuclear war. Except maybe extreme libertarians, sadist individuals and anarchist experiments.
---
That, and Shovels.  I honestly can't get over how a Shovel, which you'll only ever use for doing treasure maps, saddles you with 6 WT.
---
By that same token, it's weird that you can't craft a Shovel from the start.
---
My, monitor is fine.
---
_Everything_ is valuable. In terms of utility and not just caps. Everything. Even animal shit, acid, heads in jars, etc
---
The game almost becomes unplayable after you played with certain mutations.  If you ever start new characters you will make it your business to gain mutations.  On my other character I got lucky and gained around 10 mutations and still didn't get the herbivore mutation.  So I stopped gambling and just got the syrums I wanted for the remaining mutations.
---
90% of the time I'm with friends, so we all run empath and herd mentality.  There is some HUUUGE benefits grouping up with mutations in this game.  CHR, strange in numbers and class freak.  The 15% exp card is awesome paired with feed the people reward and the sleeping buff.
---
My main character runs every mutation EXCEPT for herbivore.  For people who don't know how Herbivore and Carnivore works.  You still get the stats from the other type of food source.  What it doubles and takes away is the food%.  So you could live with herbivore and even both if you find enough dog food.  Its way easier to just have Carnivore, since meat is everywhere and some players like popping lots of meat for all the stats it brings.  Oh yeah and you can't get any diseases from eating meat with Carnivore, almost forgot about that.
---
I've seen this happen with ghouls a good bit
---
G.t.? Lol
---
Yup, if they have pacifist off they're probably trying to bait you into combat. Possibly a trap
---
Maybe his cat was walking over the keyboard while he cooked dinner, or it was his/her's kid?
---
It happens in fallout 3 too sometimes when you like stumble over objects I think but never really knew why they randomly grunt. Damage seems insignificant too
---
Gamerdude23 sorry I forgot it lol
---
Into a vending machine either for free or for some nominal price... although it's a bit misleading depending on your own level and where your CAMP is.  Don't be a Lv. 200 and have your CAMP in the middle of the Mire and sell Lv. 10 gear. üòã
---
On mobile so I may not have the titles completely accurate. 
---
Under the electrical connections tab, there are two entries for conduits. One entry simply has the conduit piping, and splitters. The other has the pass through, floor and ceiling end caps where you can connect the wiring.
---
As of now, your best bet would be melee or stealth commando(check out captainoob).
---
Would love to get the jet pack plan, or have you just make it for my PA if you're on PS4 :)
---
Messages are made in mad-lib fashion. So you have structures like "___ but ____" , or  "____, therefore try _____". You get to pick the words (or short phrases) that are filled in, so you end up with amusing gutter humor like "tongue but hole" or "beanpole, therefore try using two hands"
---
Great points, all of those also directly apply to Bethesda‚Äôs business practices.
---
Sorry about my ignorance but does it give you any benefits like the shielded BOS officers suites? 
---
Also I saw a ‚ÄòBrotherhood Scribe jacket‚Äô in a vending machine for 12k caps, what does it do exactly?
---
Yup have had this happen to me me 3x, usually 3 or 4; 40 to 50 something lvl ganging up on players. It's for the caps sucked for them when I took theirs lol.
---
Per toon. And if course people who take things this seriously often have multiple accounts. (some even play mutliple platforms. Where do you get the time????)
---
Do you have any powered right legs with +Str by any chance? Been looking for a good 3 star RL!
---
Depends on the weapon. A 1* bloodied machete can go for 200, a bloodied lever action will go for 5000 or more. Prices go up very high when you get multiple good effects or those that synchronize with each other (i.e vats crits and vats accuracy). If you're talking bloodied, a good 3* can be trade-only due to being worth above the cap limit
---
I‚Äôd probably need about 50 loose and if you have any aluminum, gears or copper I might pay some decent caps since I‚Äôm running low
---
Thank you.
---
I am glad that Todd actually acknowledged.... to a degree, that it was half baked and needed more time.
---
Personally I think it is a cop out to say that it needed more open beta time. 
---
It was plain as day that there were multiple issues that probably would have been seen even if played on a server in your own office.
---
A prime example of this is one of the first quests in the game in the toxic valley where the fucking token machine wouldn't work. This game really needed an added 6 months of hardcore in team testing before going to any type of beta.
---
Sure can, IGN Tazier
---
Never mind, he died.
---
Servers are being moved to Howardgrad, that's why we are getting disconnected and all the maintenance of world messages, embrace your new leader, embrace your new leader OR DIE!!!!
---
Are you sure you need shovels for treasure maps.  I'm 99% sure I didn't have one when I was doing some a week ago.  I did this one daily a few days ago diggin a grave, and I had to go find a shovel on the ground to finish it.  I didn't check its weight, but I will when I log in, unless I already dropped it.
---
1* bloodied isnt rare lol
---
Some bugs yes. 
---
Half of them, no. 
---
Most bugs are specific to fallout76 .
---
 It's not an excuse, tho.
---
The trouble is the shared storage boxes limitations due to performance.  You get this in a lot of MMO's.   I would settle for a shared location storage stash of only 200 if there could be a single storage stash at my camp of substantially higher limit.
---
Damn! I was just booting up! Where did you find him?
---
I'm not sure I agree with the original premise.  Capitalism was alive and well before the Great War.  Automation and profiteering have a strong presence in the storyline of Fallout 76.  I'm not sure that the war was capitalism versus communism but rather the United States versus China.  I mean, after all, China is far from a pure Communist ideology.
---
My girlfriend is offering a three star ghoul slayers gamma gun for 25k. We think its hilarious.
---
I always pretends I'm getting bitten by tiny mosquito or I had a rock in my shoe when I randomly grunt in pain but takes no damage. 
---
I think when you loaded in an area with where enemies are and taking damage but don't see anything it cause the game haven't render em in yet. Usually when I swing my weapon, I get XP for killing invisible ghouls lol
---
RandyBitchford  *   fixed that for ya.
---
Just west of Lady Janet‚Äôs soft serve in the road.
---
No you‚Äôll be fine
---
The explosive damage from your TSE will kill you if you use it at close range. Fireproof mitigates the damage...
---
Ok, what I though. Thanks! Boy you were fast. :)
---
This happens to me all the time including blood spots on the screen and the ubiquitous grunting, seems to sometimes happen when running on the flat and often when running up or down hills, maybe I'm spraining my ankle?
---
I‚Äôll go looking and let you know if I find it.
---
It‚Äôs easy. Just don‚Äôt get mobbed. If you get surrounded they‚Äôll drop your health quick.
---
Guyd we found the guy that goes to a store CAMP, spawns enemies and leaves them wrecking the CAMP!
---
Do Explosive Vents even do anything in 76? First plans I got for the t45: jumped everywhere, never any damage done by it
---
If it's nuked, sure. The burrows by itself is fine as long as you have any kind of decent build
---
Ok, so lots of ghouls Im assuming?
---
Ok, that seems to be consensus
---
Thats wrong, ive bought and learned both plans. Named the same but still show up regardless
---
Thanks, I appreciate it. I‚Äôll be hopping servers in that area for him too. I‚Äôll let you know if I get him.
---
Yeah, you'll be fine. It's just filled with level 40-62 ghouls, so if you can handle Whitesprings you can handle the burrows.
---
I've never tried them myself, but every post I've ever read about them basically suggests that... nope, they're buggered.
---
Yes, and robots and an assultron Boss at the end.
---
I think i suffer from this in real life
---
Ok, whitesprings is really easy.
---
I have a heavy weapon build. I know what I signed up for but one of my weapons can be anywhere from 20-30 pounds :'(
---
Yea, you have to be at your workshop to be flagged now!
---
This is wrong, I have both learned.
---
Those could be trouble, no?
---
Was fighting a mirelurk queen. She tossed out some eggs, one was a diseased hatchling and I‚Äôm 99% sure I got it from that. My teammate got the blight from the queen.
---
The nuclear silos Alpha, Bravo, Charlie. They have a gym near the entrance.
---
That one is for the Excavator, all the ones that don't specify the name are
---
You can learn both, I have both
---
This fallout is almost like a lotus island. We wonder in. We dont leave
---
An AA, Armor piecing mag, or troubleshooter gear and it‚Äôs cake.
---
Seriously though, what has revitalized the wasteland? Vendors. If I can‚Äôt buy what you ha e that I want I‚Äôm going to grind and bust ass until I have the caps to get you‚Äôre selling.
---
Currently ( real day and age) they have progressed into a more capitalistic state the same as all eastern countries. However, at the time of the war they we very much a communistic state.  I appreciate the lore debate and welcome more ( I‚Äôll probably lose) . I made this post more about the hypocrisy that is Bethesda.
---
When did you do so? I lined up a trade with a guy that knew combat armor but not marine(I know marine but not combat) and both of our plans showed as known to both of us.
---
Ok. Are there a lot, or just like one small wave?
---
Arcos Pharma. A wonderful place for anyone needing caps/legendary/chems.
---
! VERY IMPORTANT ! This place, like all others in FO76, is scalable - as in solo makes this possible - if even one other player enters, the mobs increase and get more aggro - If you are in midst of this and another player enters, quit out to desktop &amp; re load - you end up outside Arcos. Getting to the train station(morgan is closest) you can quickly sell you 1400 limit and then either quit out to relog in 20 hours and sell again, or load your stash up(if you have the room) or simply play thru without fast travel option.
---
I went to check out the new(to me) level 50 area below pharma. there are, literally, dozens of chem boxes in the low level upper part, those with the perk that lets you 'search' for chems will give you anything you need.
---
Upon my exit from the elevator below, the quest immediately begins - I wasn't expecting that and got my butt kicked multiple times. There were however, 3, legendary spawns, two were animals and the  other the (supposedly) level 46 assaultron - 3 stars ?! really for a level 46. I can say that without a LOT of careful, time consuming prep and planning, this cannot be soloed. Not knowing what a completion awards, I cannot say if it might be worth so much effort.
---
Failing the quest combined with killing the assaultron, gives you 30 minute window to loot away. After 30 minutes the quest resets - I am sure its random but the 2nd spawn of a 3 star level 46 legendary assaultron was a mixed blessing - another legendary drop but also killed 3 times beating it.
---
Once I realized(very quickly) that I could not solo this quest, I instead went exploring and avoiding mobs(robots &amp; hi level ghoul types). Every room, box, shelf, locker &amp; safe are all full of awesome stuff - to sell. None of it worthy of chasing for use, but the gear combined with all the junk you can loot - I will be 4 days straight hitting my 1400 cap limit just selling everything I got in this one single place.
---
My short term goal is to be able to buy the UBER Power Armor mods now available at white springs. Going in with bare min of food water weaps and stims(as in about 400 pounds below my weight limit) I came out with nearly 1200 pounds of sellable loot.
---
The real kicker is that. after 30 minutes, when it resets, so does ALL the loot. There are multiple workbenches(chem, Armor &amp; weap) to break the items down - if there is a tinker bench I didn't find it.
---
Like so much else of FO76, this area needs tweaks. I am fairly certain that they did not intend to have multiple legendaries spawn each time, nor did they intend for the quest to, quite literally, be run every 30 minutes. It should, and probably will be, modified to daily or weekly but until that occurs - this IS your one stop shop for it all - Massive amounts of chems to be had from an insane amount of chem boxes, more sellable loot/junk than you will ever want/need and a LOT of repeating weapon drops(50 cal machine, light machine, missile launcher, gatling and assorted other types) that, if your not inclined to collect and sell junk,  looting the weapons you find will also make you very wealthy.
---
Go for it while it is available.
---
Oh that makes sense.  Yea, I feel like Ive played a lot, but Im level 77.  Even if I had the time I can't enjoy one activity for that long.
---
That isn't floating. And if the stairs or the foundation break, proof goes your base until they're repaired
---
If you just want to drop stuff, I suggest the stash boxes at the overseer's camp and flatwoods church. Either that, or find a low level player on the map and drop everything on the floor of their camp.
---
Its very likely he knew both, I learned combat armor one after the most recent patch, and I also found a second and sold it to someone who had marine unlocked and it worked just fine
---
Excavator PA.
---
Ghouls, there‚Äôs plenty, robots about 10ish.
---
It‚Äôs not as rare as three star bloodied but a specific good one isn‚Äôt easy to come by. More than 1000 hours in the game I‚Äôve only come across three bloodied handmades, two bloodied gatling guns, two bloodied LMGs. Some bloodied melee stuff like walking canes and golf clubs are more common but not good ranged weapons.
---
no kidding! the only skin (or anything really) i would be more than willing to buy atoms for
---
Last question. Is it long?
---
Put your camp at the middle of the map.
---
The amount of skins on most other online games these days is insane, we don't have that many in comparison. The Excavator skins were cool tho, glad they added those
---
Ive come across them a lot specially now with player vending, id say a *1 bloodied handmade at most is only worth 1k
---
he swore he only knew the one. If you know someone else on xbox that has a plan I'm always looking.
---
Damn, I been server hopping off and on for about 2 days in that spot looking for him.
---
I like to finish up, then as soon as they go for the vendor just mow them down. If you can‚Äôt be patient, you must die. This is a civilized post-apocalyptic world after all.
---
Im on ps4, my best advice is to server hop the BOS vendor in watoga, thats where I got them from. Def not bugged just rare
---
CEO of Gearbox Software
---
Suppose it depends on your game play. I like to steal everything that isn‚Äôt nailed down to sell at harpers bot.
---
Dang.
---
Silly me, I spelled his name wrong
---
Yup, spot on, most people have what they need, and those that don't have seen plenty sub 500. Its no longer the cash cow it was, but its still good money.
---
I've been doing this too with the same hope. xD
---
Aye, my camp is ENE of White Springs, up the cliff from the sat dishes.  Higher level area, not well traveled by tenderfoots. I'm just getting into enough coin where I'm not penny pinching the fast travel.  Just might move.
---
Same here. That‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve ever encountered him. I tried near the Charleston station but there was too much traffic there and I still had no luck. There seems to be two spawns near  this one too.
---
Well where to get the plans?
---
Do you ever get care packages dropped for you to sell?
---
I did not intend to do this. I needed the benches on the upper floors but didn't want to deal with the hassle of the scorched swarming me.
---
SO.....
---
I set up across from the fort/missile battery up on the rocks and started sniping the scorched. A hunting rifle mod to 50 cal ammo and LONG range scope. The scorched couldn't figure out the  shots were coming from and would take cover.  I drew them out of cover by using a missile launcher on  the vehicles in the parking area - they explode nicely and all the scorched rush over to them firing wildly. I did this twice  - once the left and once to the right
---
Then I had no more scorched to kill. I walked onto the grounds and the line in sand quest suddenly triggered.  I repaired the missile launcher BEFORE I used the terminal to start the quest - I think this is very important to do.  I then triggered the quest and for ALL 5 waves, had 5 single scorched come up and try to beat on the sonic generator - no weapons on them. I killed 2 scorched beasts through the 5 waves and had to repair the missile launcher and sonic generator once.
---
but wait - there's still more.
---
My original purpose in coming here was to access the benches - much to my complete surprise - nothing spawned inside the fort. There was a danger notice  and I constantly heard the breathing of a scorch beast but  there were no mobs to fight.
---
When I departed - i found no scorched remaining on the grounds.  I left the missile launcher in good repair and active.  there was a single scorch beast flying over the fields behind the fort but nothing else.
---
I think that when you snipe the scorched into extinction(including the \*\*\* one which generates others - you have a wide open fort to defend. A glance at the map shows the nearest fissure a LONG way away. The few that do come during the wave(s) are ones that were locally around and drawn by the fighting.
---
I have no idea how long it will stay clear; all told I was there a little over an hour - no scorched had come during that time.
---
Have fun with it - remember that fo76 is scaled - even 1 additional player on anything you are trying to solo will pooch the kitty.
---
Good Luck.
---
That's the argument against this; players build traps where players would spawn
---
I got it from a diseased hatchling a mirelurk queen spit out.
---
I love this and I'm not even a stealth build! Lol
---
Wonder what China is like in the Fallout universe. Probably much worse off than the US I think.
---
lol I killed the four super mutants who damaged the camp. Oddly I spawned inside the vending room and all its doors were locked. No idea how I could even spawn those guys üòÇ
---
More reports for people to make and admins to go through. Spawning players outside the Camp radius doesn't need that
---
If you get a bloodied explosive rifle then nerd rage makes sense, if not its not worth being at low health for a regular explosive rifle
---
Ps4?????
---
If you‚Äôre the Player character approaching a raider camp or something, does it go into a loading screen while the Fodder character gets connected to the lobby? Or would you enter a lobby as fodder and when people approach different places you‚Äôll be spawned in repeatedly in the same lobby, just in different spots around the map, as interactions occur?
---
Yes please. I have the BOS Jumpsuit but the amazing looking logo is covered. When I have the space I ditch the bag! 
---
Surveyor costume with the backpacks look great!
---
They call me StinkySquish now.
---
Fallout players are horders......
---
Just a little more space for a few more screws and radroach meat
---
I cant check now but ive played since beta and am at roughly 550 hours, cant play until i get back home on the 29th at the earliest though, and my PC tends to throw a paddy when it hasnt been switched on in a while so probably a few more dsys after that
---
ok, but I could put another card(s) in its place until right? Or is it not worth the risk?
---
I personally would use those 3 in endurance and get life giver to have more health, also if you dense your chest armor, you really will only need 2 points on fireproof instead of 3
---
Alright just let me know and if you want me to launch one just let me know I have a couple keycards.
---
What system?  I have one for sale.
---
What do the garage hi for? I got a forest hat today. Have a couple other cookies too.
---
This is a really good point.  I've rolled for the longest time with a 1\* Bloodied Power Fist (just Lv. 40, no less) and a 1\* Bloodied Gatling Gun.
---
The other day, I was able to update to a Lv. 50 BPF and a 2\* BGG with that 10% damage boost while aiming.  It doesn't seem like much, but when I consider that the BGG gets up past 400 damage a shot when I'm low health, that extra 40 damage is quite a bit in terms of other guns.
---
I think the tediousness of it just got funnier to be honest, knowing that most games wouldnt hold onto it for as long as this game did, other games would have caved and given into the impatient gamer much earlier
---
I did pretty much the entirety of main quest in swimsuit and fashionable glasses. It delighted me to no end. Particularly being barefoot for it all. Some real John McClain shit.
---
I have a keycard....doing bravo solo right now
---
Stims might be heavier, but they are much more plentiful.
---
I pretty much only play in survival and people exaggerate everything bad about it.
---
I forced myself to go through the entire decoding process when I launched my first nuke. I read a thread on how to to it correctly. I had to wait until Friday to have enough letters. I did it on principle. I ran the silo solo and dropped it on Whitesprings. I traveled there to run through MY nuke zone, and then the server crashed. 
---
Since then I use that decryption site.
---
I've hopped that vendor so many times I can do it with my eyes closed lol
---
Should add unpainted to that cus i have my war rider skin on it and its my go to PA
---
The most I‚Äôve seen in player‚Äôs vending is ‚Äòassassins‚Äô stuff, apparently nobody uses or wants them. But no I don‚Äôt see many bloodied at all, especially the useful ones. The highest priced item I‚Äôve seen so far is a three star non-E Stalker‚Äôs dragon with bash damage priced 20k. To the one player who‚Äôs looking for it, it‚Äôs probably a reasonable price.
---
That is true.
---
Nah this one been here a long time. I remember it back in Nov.
---
Really good reasoning that may be the winner for me.
---
Thanks! So I'm guessing the damage will still be fine without it. Thanks for your help
---
Strangler plant, and I believe Vault 94 is the origin
---
Fair one, but PvP isnt for me in this game, only had bad experiences with it when people used to tag workshops youd own across the map then randomly come and 1 shot you.  
---
I knowve nerfed unyielding sentinal assins armour now so they can be killed but meh, its left a bad taste in my mouth already
---
Yea just go out and get a tse rifle for 6-10k, specially a handmade or lever and youll be good. Im not a vats build so I cant say how good all those perks you have in vats are though
---
How does this work? Do you get caps for winning pvp? I‚Äôve only done pvp a few times and never paid attention to what happened after.
---
When you go into power armor you lose all of you armor stats and it gets replaced with power armor. Honestly power armor is the weaker route to go right now until they make legendary peices.
---
I wasn't planning on it but I might now just to have something to do...I saved your post and will hit you up if I do...what's your psn?
---
I'm debating shitcanning vats myself since I like to manually aim. Any suggestions to where to move those points?
---
Yep everybody dies fast. Only need for a legendary is to make it 1hk instead of 2 or 3. 
---
Sneaking/headshots with blackpowder puts almost any player on the ground lol
---
As I sit here and play survival all day everyday. Nobody plays lol. You don't play and you repeat the same dogma these forums spout. It's like when the game first launched and everyone was repeating the same shit about bugs and the world being booring with no NPCs. We know that's not true. Just like I know what you say isn't true. It's just the dogma everyone repeats.
---
they do? I never knew that. I learned something new today :)
---
Garage?
---
One of the challenged was a camara 1 to "take a picture of an alien" and seperately below that was to take 1 of the flatwoods monster, they were listed seperately in the same list altgough flatwoods monster did check off both from the list
---
Invest in adding to the melee build, strenth also gives more carry weight and you can get rid of random weight reduction cards that take up space
---
Oh, I though it was gonna be a flamethrower trap. I have these powered doors but with the conduit wall pass-through instead of going round the outside. Doesn't look too great, potentially suspicious, but it keeps the critters out. On FO4 you could set a timer switch on it to close after 1, 5, 10 seconds. Not here tho, for some reason
---
And take the bag. That upsets me more than anything.  They always wait until my back is turned too.
---
Imagine all 25 plaers on server will be fodder
---
Psn is jafar_quenton_7. I do have a nuke keycard, but no code.
---
Fair enough, i will pribably try it when its finalised and out of beta, but for now its not my thing
---
I don‚Äôt think carry weight is your issue.  What are you picking up and carrying around that is weighing so much?  Are you picking up everything enemies drop? Or grabbing everything not nailed down in a room?  
---
You mentioned carrying junk to sell, there are far more efficient ways of earning caps than selling junk.
---
Actually had just finished a run through myself :)
---
Oh. Nice. First time? Or repeat?
---
ok so in strength. Action boy may be worth to keep for other uses right? I may get rid of concentrated fire, gun fu
---
I usally get contend killed than ill leave and come back and they wont be there. Waste of time they are. Wont even give me a chance to change from my building build to my pvp build.
---
&gt;nd pathetic when in a game that's filed with monsters to go let ur angry out on AND a designated Pvp server someone would feel the need to grief. Like how incomplete and dissatisfying does thier life have 
---
This. Prefect answer IMO
---
Darn. I‚Äôm ps4
---
Appreciate the thoughtful response! I try to do a "spring cleaning" of my inventory every so often. For me, it's always a ton of misc Aid and ammo. At the specific situation that resulted in this post, I wasn't carring a full load (about 340/385) I just happened to notice after I died  my carry weight that's posted on the respawn map was back to my normal non-PA carry weight of 300. Limiting my respawn.
---
It seems out of place for equipment to grant a carry weight perk that clashes with respawn rules. Seemed like a bug to me but it now it looks like that's just how it be.
---
Repeat.. good for legendaries
---
Cool...no problem with the code we can look it up when needed.  Have you done one yet?
---
Oh, really. Hiw about xp? Better or worse than whitesprings for those?
---
Unless they randomize it around the perimeter of your build area (which would be fine) a player can always know or find out where players will spawn. Meanwhile a randomized spawn aeound the perimeter will result in wile e coyote action.  
---
Grief... Uh, finds a way.
---
Right. I log in to Survival everyday before going to Adventure to see if there's anything interesting. Not only does the leaderboard show very few players in each server I join, but also I can clearly see a decrease in activity. 
---
The first few weeks, the Whitesprings was a death trap. Now it's a nice walk around the hotel.
---
I mean, great for you if you like it. But many people don't - and they have moved on.
---
&gt; Do you get caps for winning pvp?
---
Yes.
---
You might not.  I assumed they did because that stupid Buried with Honor quest *insists* that you have one and I therefore figured that all mounds were the same.
---
Well, to the grinder with you, Anti-Armor Shovel! üòã
---
We will never know
---
*Really?* 
---
I thought you only got junk. Well that makes sense.
---
Was waiting for some one to drop this knowledge
---
Not. Yet.
---
Was it Survival or nah?
---
I'm familiar with that glitch, but after I died it was as if I wasnt wearing the excavator power armor at all anymore
---
Hmmm good question, on gut feel I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs about the same
---
That's 9 hours per day, wtf.
---
Ok. Good to know
---
I've had 2 people (at different times) come up to me and ask me to kill them because they didnt want to be wanted anymore. They came back, thanked me, dropped some items for me them split.
---
I just did it over the weekend, level 52. Had no problems.
---
Ok nice. Do you have any insane weapons?
---
its been on my load screen for over a month.  Really sucks.
---
Yeah I run bloodied and have 3 unyielding and 2 bolstering ww reduction pieces.
---
At 30%  my carry weight is like 345/448 in PA I'm well over 1000
---
I carry all the weapons lol
---
Oh damn I never thought about mutations as a negative thing for the Brotherhood. That's something to think about there; what if a Paladin has an ear grow out of his face or something similar, will he be shunned by the others, even kicked out?
---
I do indeed. 5c on bulk gears and copper and 7 on the aluminum but I only have 3 or 4 of each available.
---
I don't like this love it or leave mentality this sub has. Anything slightly critical seems to eat hate even if it's humorous.
---
I have the post saved.
---
He's just porkn ya. 
---
He's got some beef.
---
Have him now.
---
I have him now.
---
I am by no means an expert but feel free to pm me with questions &amp; I'll do my best to answer them; I can also team up with you in-game if you need something like a bodyguard for quests or a hunting/scavenging buddy, or if you need guns made or upgraded I could also do that as long as I've got the resources for it.
---
That's really awesome!
---
I am sick of all the high levels defending me hunger levels like the other day I had a level 60 come up and hit me so I was about to do teach him a lesson but wouldn't you know his little buddy that was a higher level just had to get involved I think when text Francis a lower level challenges a higher level that should be between them he if they pick a fight then you better be able to back it up
---
Come hang with me. I have a Melee alt around that level.
---
On PC, GT same as username.
---
did u already launch?
---
Shit. I‚Äôm logging in
---
Going to start 4-5 now if you want to join.
---
Nope...still in silo
---
Needs a full reboot for me, though fast travel works *sometimes*, I mute my sound then I can carry on without developing tinnitus. The system just can't handle all the exploding stuff in the cell.
---
I deliberately sit there in the transaction interface just to make them wait. Sometimes they'll go AFK so then I attack, kill and take their caps. Other times they'll FT away and then I come out.

Thats my build, ignore the low health stuff, get tank killer instead on perception for rifles. Currently with this I do 500 per shot with my handmade and 1.4k per swing with melee

same. but FT never works for me.

and still, they‚Äôre going to release the next elder scrolls in the exact same engine. press F

Do they stack by addition or multiplication?
---
Because if it's strictly by addition then with goat legs you should be getting healed.
---
spoiler alert
---
BUT BUT BUT this game has no NPCs so there is no story! /s
---
Seriously though, the environmental storytelling in this game is what drew me into it FIRST.  Couple of tableaus that stood out in my memory:
---
* The Responder stuffed into the fridge at Flatwoods.  Having to listen to the audio tape, analyze the environment and find his stash based on the clues was great, as opposed to the generic "here's your waypoint in the HUD follow it to loot".
---
* Murder suicide in the mountains, one skeleton with a pickaxe in his skull, another next to it with a revolver nearby.
---
* Crystalized corpse with a shovel, they must have been digging a hole in the woods to dump a bunch of coffins for some reason.  Accelerants strewn all about in the crater with the coffins.
---
* Couple of raiders playing checkers in a lookout tower using caps for game pieces, must have disagreed with a move and killed each other.
---
70% camp budget used
---
Scratch that. There‚Äôs now way I‚Äôll get there in a reasonable amount of time. Where did you manage to get him ?
---
And some opossum, to go with it!
---
You might have already reached 90% if you had perks like traveling pharmacy or thru hiker
---
Same place as before. West of Lady Janet‚Äôs in the road.
---
Survival mode hasn't outright failed, it's still in beta for god knows how much longer.  They've already said that once the mode goes live there's going to be changes, among which will be regular character resets to prevent people from reaching a god build and then dominating for all eternity.
---
Talons gives +25% Unarmed damage, that'd be a perfect as a starter for you. Other than that, Speed Demon can help you close the distance between you and your target quicker and also makes the sprinting power attack faster, Marsupial is as addictive as crack and the withdrawal is like losing your shins. To keep them you'll need Starched Genes level 2 perk from the Luck stat (unlocked at level 18 or 20 I think) so you don't remove your mutations with Radaway or gain unwanted ones.
---
Here's some more info:

I think Stephenson used the same engine in his 'Rocket' 1829 O.o
---
Level 200? Do people HAVE lives?
---
Yes. I did it alone on another character. I succeeded, but only by pure luck. I found a good server that didn‚Äôt boot me off. But it took me forever, because I didn‚Äôt really know what I was doing and I kept getting hopelessly lost. Have you done it?
---
Sent you a friend request, i look forward to dying in your proximity
---
Boo
---
Just unselected it from your pipboy and you won't see it anymore
---
thx! You've given me a lot to work with
---
If Sludge Lung would actually register I might bother tracking down Whoopsies.
---
Hey, just wondering when you logged into the game for the first time today and saw 4/5 daily challenges completed by itself, did you crash or get some error saying "unable to login" etc and go back to main menu / crash to desktop?
---
Because it happened to me and some of my friends (on different day). Some of our daily challenges completed by itself before we did it. We thought someone hacked into our account and did the challenges for us lol...
---
I have the perk that makes bullets 90% less and the ammo weight reduction still works with 2pcs. So not sure the 90% total thing is accurate. Most of my bullets with the 2 gear pieces equipped weight 0.000lbs. .38, .44, .45 all weight 0 when I check inventory with 90% perk and 2 20% gear pieces
---
I have the plan and can put the dense mod on the chest pieces as long as it is a chest piece I made. It doesn't even show up as an option on legendary items even though I know the plan.
---
Sure there will always be an amazing combo of items that is God tier just that it does shift constantly and what's at the top today could be standard tomorrow.
---
Of course, and some brown sauce too ü•ì
---
[](/lcehappy)I would assume the second one, just connecting to whatever server needs a raider, but it's not necessary for the players to ever see loading. You don't get a loading screen when another player joins the game next to you. If fodder has a slow connection, or load time they might pop in a little after the fight starts, it really depends on how Beth designs the que system if they implemented it.  
---
If we're tethered to specific locations, the que screen could (I think) preload the zones we'd be in, and allow near instant load ins. Also since raiders have no reason to pick up anything loading could be sped up by not loading in junk/items lying around.
---
Strange, i have bandolier as well and didnt think my ammo weight armor stacked with it. Ill have to check again
---
Fr
---
Id be down to if you can sell me some ammo and springs on the cheap, or trade for a weapon.

Sorry - PC here :(
---
&gt;To be fair, before it launched they did put out an open letter admitting she was gon' be rough.
---
A week before the "beta"
---
Hey! Danse did it!
---
Yeah, I'm out of the loop on this one (not wondering who Gearbox is. Wondering what did this guy do)
---
none of the missions require chameleon stuff
---
how about a herpatology onesie
---
Yeah, I'll try this. I had already completed a couple before it disappeared. Seems like a long shot, but definitely worth trying.
---
It's gone completely, unfortunately. It's not that it's not active, it's that it isn't there any more.
---
I'm gonna be honest here. I love it.
---
dear gods how i miss that event.
---
Silly fool. Everybody knows that our true lord and savior is *never* seen without his Level 999 Jacket of Upmost Goddliness, and the rare occasions where he appears without it are simply pretenders trying to imitate our lord
---
Oh god yes. Bloodied against those damn Lt-Gutsys with the anti-armour gun attack never ends well. They're Bloodied Kryptonite. 400+ armour rating doesn't mean a thing against them
---
Fastastic idea! Lets also stand there like fuckwag while a sniper potshots us to death. *what was that? must of been nothing...*
---
This is true, ive been digging through all the bat crap I can find since I found one in a pile.
---
I'm going to say this to the next a-hole that wants to PVP me

The alcohol that was immediately ready, was hard lemonade. I didn't mean ALL alcohol ingame was immediately usable after being crafted, most of it does have to ferment first. I merely used the same fermenting example, as I would love to see similar mechanics regarding baked goods.

Lol no
---
big bacon colonel
---
Set across form southern belle, mega sloth in tree and hermit up the road makes for a good 500 xp every time I get on. Just make sure you set up enough turrets
---
True, the majority would prefer to blame Bethesda over their own connection or hardware limitations.
---
What in the hell?
---
I don‚Äôt think I did, I played normally and when I opened my challenges that‚Äôs what I saw
---
A man with the deals. I do 30c for most bulk. Maybe 40c for lead. I usually have 10 bulk of each. Am I pricing to high?
---
Sounds like the same dip shit, that hit me up the other day, well I was sleeping. I gave him some mouth punch for his time.  Seems like these idiot's are coming over from the survival mode looking to cause problems, thinking they are special.
---
Yeah Ive launched a few...did a spur of the moment whitesprings nuke Thursday night. I'd do it more often but my weight has been an issue a little lately and the silos have soooo much lead and other good junk lol.
---
Clearly that photo is from before his origin story began
---
Yeah, and server-wide event notification of ZETANS ATTACK would be pretty cool
---
Just look it up use Google I'm sorry but I dont know everything I dont know how to get these plans because to me the gun is just a waste of ammo when I could be using the lever rifle
---
Get out of our sub you fuckin troll
---
If what you have is in you junk section  then it is useless and junk only. The camera you fix and use to take pictures appears under the misc section and can't be dropped (can only destroy) or traded.
---
Where did we learn this???
---
In the mothership zeta dlc for fallout 3 there are holotapes from the vault tec owner
---
Had the same thing last night. Stopped at someone‚Äôs camp to make some food, this twit starts stabbing me while I‚Äôm making food. He hit me at least 8 times.  I waited til he left and looked on the map to see where he was. Then I get killed, didn‚Äôt see him.  Went for revenge and this twit and his twitty pal are trying to one shot me. Hit the numbskull but he must have the bloody perk cause his health was low. His bitch then one shoots me. Didn‚Äôt have anything worth the time attacking me, so I remember his handle. This bait and switch is commonplace now.
---
I'm a man of my word. I said every time, so upvote for you!
---
Ill be down to farm it. Need some people to, im lv 198 bloodied auto rifle build. I can solo boss in 20~ seconds, just those damn creatures keep dying!
---
Stash size doesn't need to be increased. Camp size most definitely does though. They keep adding shit to place down but the size has remained the same it's disheartening
---
For real. I can see it being like a good twenty minute event. Foot soldiers, teleporting mobs like in mothership zeta, shooting down said space ships, 
---
A few good zetan weapons would be cool too. Just have to balance them out for multiplayer. And the summer would be complete.
---
I've gotten Sludge Lung several times.  It's definitely checked off on my list.  I've definitely got other challenges that are bugged, but not the diseases.....so far.
---
Haha. I go to the fire station for lead, but I hear you. Do you have a mic? Maybe you could help walk me through a little bit. Make it more efficient. I know I got seriously waylaid during the mainframe core part, replacing them and such.
---
The explosive shotgun nerf only nerfed shotguns, it did not nerf shotgun mods for the odball weapons.
---
Thank you good sir
---
Aspire my man, you GET that demo expert, then you HUNT for a BE rifle to use. Always perk for the final game. You will be better off not having to waste respec points.
---
Sometimes, with extremely low health, taking a rad-away outright kills me...no idea why.
---
I'd pay extra to limit my melee tries to 2 handed only. Last time I visited her I went for 8 melee weapons and got 7 one handed.
---
*Correction: They didn't nerf shotguns. They fixed the Pip-Boy to display the correct amount of damage they were actually doing (cause there's no way my Shotgun was doing 200 damage per shot while still doing pitiful damage against everything). The same goes for TS weapons (which displayed doing the same amount of damage as their non-TS counterparts.) 
---
The TS Fatman was the most noticeable with these fixes. Pre-fix it says it only does around 400 damage (the same as a regular Fatman). Post-fix it now says it does upwards of *900* damage and that's without Demolitions Expert.
---
With dense and fireproof 2, I can still kill myself at low hp, but only with my BE laser, it's common in PvP, so Fireproof 3 might be good

What was your carry weight in PA?

I run a deep pocketed combat armor with 1 ammo reduce and 1 food and drink reduc in the 3rd roll.

Can do 415 but only 315 dr but it‚Äôs all assassins/powered and 3/5 sentinel.
---
Try dropping your camera and crafting a new one.

You'd better go roll some purveyor quick.
---
I agree the only "Reward" for being top 3 is a bullseye on your back to be griefed by tryhards. Survival mode is a joke and is only designed for the players to be forced into pvp because it's the only way for Bethesda to force us I to it. For some strange reason Bethesda is obsessed with us doing pvp. They want to force it down our throats. Nobody wants it and nobody asked for it. I really wish they would just come to the realization that their version of pvp is a total and complete failure. Pvp doesnt work in this type of game. This is an adventure/survival game not a adventure/survival game in the sense that I could lose all of my hard earned meds and junk to a fool that cant help himself but always want to kill another player and only enjoys the game for just that and nothing else.
---
We might be more understanding if they renamed it from pvp to griefer/immature 10 year old/tryhard/for adults that have yet to grow up mode, then it would probably be more accepted for the honesty alone.
---
But back to the original idea of the topic, I think the player should be handsomely ewarded depending on multiple factors like staying alive while completing quests/events, getting kills on players,  claiming workshops and taken them from another player. But all of those done in one life.
---
Gt: C4DynamiteBruh, its summer for me so I‚Äôm on all the time
---
Old quest bug I ran into at launch that's still affecting me:
---
When doing An Ounce of Prevention, if you have cannibal equipped when you go to collect the feral ghoul blood, collecting it shares the prompt with eating the corpse, and if activated, will result in you eating the corpse and setting whatever flag says you collected the blood, but without actually giving you the blood, preventing you from actually getting the blood and continuing the questline.
---
I had to make a new character to get around it, and support couldn't do anything at the time to fix it.
---
When did you learn them? Recent or pre-January?
---
Can‚Äôt deny the logic here.
---
Yeah, I would say your good to drop it.  Treasure map searching can be cool.  I would never do it without youtube though, haha.  It gives me some extra ammo and its good for breaking down some guns to learn mods.
---
I was repairing armor at my camp once and some guy blasted me with a shot gun.
---
After last patch
---
This is what I was talking about with someone the other day. We eventually came down to the conclusion that the best way to do this is to emphasize survival and scrounging for food and supplies as well as resources to make weapons with an emphasis on building your character for a given role. 
---
I feel it would be pretty cool if you got to tag certain specials which would give you a pool of starting perks and special points (possibly also have to tag a weapon type to gain plans for that weapon class) and maybe having to push certain objectives to gather more cards and rarer resources.
---
But I completely agree that The Division‚Äôs Survival Mode is a great reference for what would make this mode great.
---
Yep same. I'm a space Pirate at the moment... But I love having the outfits... Christ knows where the jumpsuits came from but UF would make sense since I run that religiously for steel.. and lvl 40 drops aren't too bad
---
If they could stick to the essentials of a game review, gameplay, graphics, audio, story, is it well optimized, etc., that'd be fine.  What I don't care about is the woke shit they try to inject.
---
I play video games to escape for a couple of hours a day.  If I wanted to hear bad political opinions, I'll turn on CNN or PMSNPC.
---
I question this as well, and my argument is not so much about dying around the queen after a fight.
---
But I met up with a guy a few weeks back and sold him 30 violet flux, now if he wanted, he could have set me up and ambushed me with his crew, then scooped my flux and not paid me at all. luckily he didn‚Äôt and was honest but the potential is there
---
Did it work for you?
---
If you can solo the Whitespring you can solo the Burrows. Practically the exact same difficulty.
---
Oh yeah, dicks abound on any platform, but as he mentioned, the player base tends to be older on the PC and a bit more mellow.
---
But no matter the platform, it's always fun to bait the ragers into blowing a gasket.  üòé
---
Have a two shot I turned into sniper rifle and a quad a put a flamer mod
---
I believe it's what they did for stability on consoles for some reason. Not sure how right that is as I can't find a source so take that for what you will.
---
Good question. I'm also interested in what opinions are out there from those with plasma experience..
---
If you have a bloodied build then that over all else. If you like high health then furious.
---
That wouldn't make sense because stable flux is just an item to craft with. Raw flux is an aid item because it can quench thirst
---
Try exiting and re-entering.
---
Try using an addictol.  There was a bug that hid withdrawal effects from chems.
---
Blight?
---
Already did. Nothing happened
---
Ok, so I haven't encountered this one yet. But I have a lot of friends that have. Recently I guess in the event you die after the sbq, your flux disappears. So I applaud bethesda for this whether it was intentional or not. Cause I'd rather no one have it than some random benefitting from my mistakes or carelessness. Also if you go the a sbq with said "good junk" on you. That's your first mistake. ü§£üòÇ  just giving ya hard time friend we've all made the mistake but we learn and move on.
---
Loot. Everything.
---
What do you mean?
---
Sorry, F76, was glitching.  It wouldn't let me accept, said it couldn't add you.  It's just updated now to say that you are now a friend.  If you're still around, I'd love to have a bit of swimming fun!
---
Lol if only I had the scrip
---
Will keep that in mind
---
Might next guess would be Herd Mentality mutation or the Blight disease.  Have you tried a radaway and a cure disease?
---
There's a disease called the Blight that reduces all SPECIAL stats by 2.
---
Wood armour
---
Sell older stuff you dont use. Lower level armour and weapons. Maybe extra chems or junk if you have a CRAP load of the stuff. My camp was near a lake so I'd harvest a lot of purified water. I have probably 140 bottles of it on my person, all the extra goes into my vending machine.  If you have other items that you just never use, put that in there as well.  Plans or recipes that you've already learned but found copies of.
---
Well obviously how could I have forgotten about wooden armor
---
Use the search bar. This question gets asked a lot and there are plenty of good tidbits below. Good luck!
---
I contracted herd mentality. But when i wanted to get rid of it nothing happened. I tried for ages but the mutation wasn't even appearing with my mutations.  And i already tried curing diseases
---
Also if you on XB, clear your cache, had a similar issue, cache clear worked for me
---
Pistols are "meh". Especially laser (they don't get any armor piercing capabilities at all). The best is probably an AA 10mm pistol with a Stinging mag (for more AP plus a few more rounds). 
---
But pistols... yeah. The problem is the pistol perks compete with so many other very good perks in luck. You miss out on SOMETHING nice. And pistol's don't have any perks that ad armor piercing.
---
Sugoi!!!   O\_O;
---
Thanks all! 
---
I've gotten to like this C.A.M.P. so much, I finally have to start a second character (that means think of another story in my head first). Been playing since beta and only have the one. 
---
Time to start the story of another so I can play with some more C.A.M.P. ideas I have going 'round in my head.
---
I still want character names to show AND gas pumps for decorations!
---
Yeah i love my one star Bloodied gatling and 50 cal, most creatures are one shot done, or two at most, never need to worry about blowing up myself like when using explosive versions. Features like Faster Fire Rate would make them even nicer but honestly not necessary. Many three star weapons are pure garbage but look attractive to new players.
---
Im on ps4 so don‚Äôt know if or how that‚Äôs gonna work... really bugs me that we still got so many bugs in the game
---
Well no i dont have it. Already used cure disease
---
Best tip is - don't rush and just enjoy appalachia.
---
...and spend a little time at your Terminal before you leave the Vault.
---
You should probably swap it the other way around. Flamer mod had 306 ammo by default, quad barely raises that. Meanwhile a sniper only has like 7 or 9 by default, quad will make a huge difference to that.
---
I don't think so...I just undercut because I have a hard time just throwing stuff away but I could really use the stash space...anything over my personal amount goes at bargain basement prices...I also sell most of my legendaries at 10C/ scrip...33 cap one star armor never lasts long.
---
**Repair Kits** lmao
---
Have you tried a rad shower to cure herd mentality? Although what other mutations you running? Might not want to lose a good one. Class freak takes away a lot of negative effects when you unlock that perk card.
---
I'd strongly suggest the flamer barrel. It does pretty much the same damage as a regular rifle barrel, but has a dps like 6x higher and a clip size of 306. The sniper barrel is extremely underwhelming, it takes a huge ammo cut but is only a little bit stronger than the regular rifle barrel
---
Not really, people leave stuff occasionally but it seems more like inventory cleanup. Thing is, I don‚Äôt really even try. At the end of the day, any caps I do get are caps I never would have had anyway. That being said, I‚Äôll still sell 3* legendary high level stuff at market price. It‚Äôs the stuff I‚Äôd barely keep anyway that I leave cheap. Plans I already know, non expiring aid items. Magazines and bobble heads, etc.
---
Fine idea that .. time for some fine tuning and testing üëç
---
Solution: if you get a good weapon, but it's not your build, don't trade it in! Put it in your vendor! Let's get those weapons in circulation so they can get to the people that need them.
---
Do you have a mic? I'm on PC, I can lend a hand and some advice, as desired. IGN Tazier
---
Do the quests in order unlike me who eagerly skipped half of the questlines during the beta...
---
Stash sizes sure, but I see no need for CAMP size increases.
---
Godspeed Deskin...
---
There is a way to clear your cache on PS4, if nothing else works, just look it up
---
Thats the thing i was farming for mutation and i got plenty of good ones and whenever i get a one i don't want i use these decontamination showers and it usually gets them off. But when i got herd mentality it didn't even appear with my mutations!  And i tired many times to get rid of it and lost grounded and electrically charged because of it. Doesn't seem to work. The game probably glitched and it thinks i dont have the mutation but its effect still is effecting me.
---
Hey there mate! I got it done most in all regions without any prob.
---
Maybe just wait a bit longer till the cam register the objective.
---
Had a few times a similar issue but after 3 snaps it checked.
---
Congrats on holding off for the lower price and less buggy version.  It's a good path to follow.
---
If you've played a Bethesda game, it's in the similar vein of "sure theres a main quest, but I think I'll go exploring today instead".  Dont be afraid to leave quest lines that get too hard.  The world has many cool vignettes to find.  Bottom line, take your time.
---
Also, dont be afraid to run a test character.  Took me about 6 or 7 levels before I understood the game, then started over.
---
Enjoy the ride!
---
I know it's the shit!
---
Sounds like herd mentality is the culprit.  Making sure that starched genes is not equipped and take a long shower at a decontamination arch or use rad away.  Then maybe try to relog.  I am kind of out of ideas though.
---
If you are in a group does the stat reduction go away?  I would confirm that it does so you absolutely know the issue, then report it as a bug.
---
Weird flex but okay.. I would say most people have a stable internet connection. Put your dick away.
---
If literally anything doesn‚Äôt go your way, whine and cry about it to Bethesda on this sub.
---
But for real - have fun. This game isn‚Äôt perfect but it‚Äôs a damn good time. Congrats on buying it.
---
For two shot explosive weapons like grenade launcher and fatman yes it was a fix, now it shows total damage for both projectiles combined. But explosive shotguns were definitely nerfed again. In the previous TSE nerf they were nerfed together with other weapons. Now it was nerfed a second time under the excuse of ‚Äòbug fix‚Äô.

*I AM THE TABLE*
---
As looking for a megasloth in cranberry bog for the daily i saw - i'm not kidding - 8 sheepsquatshes down there on diffrent encounters.
---
 Was a little bit off.
---
Gt: ZOMBIE1502
---
I'll try grouping before showering all my mutations away. Give me a sec. I dont have people to play with so if herd mentality it glitched that would suckkk
---
I had it again today while restocking, I sent msg, and asked why in sneak, they said: habit. I mentioned not to get mad if someone logs off then, because they can't see you.
---
should be under mods when trying to upgrade a t-60 chest piece
---
9k is insane for a 1star bloodied, that being said, it's all about the type of weapon.
---
Value is based on quality and rarity. 
---
A 1star bloodied DCG? I'll toss it up for 1k. Handmade? maybe 1.5k (bloodied rifle builds are a bit more popular than bloodied melee builds IMO).
---
Bloodied pipe wrench? lol, 300?
---
Yup. Its herd mentality i got all my stats buffed now
---
Just imagine you hit your toes on a stump...
---
Common bug/joke
---
Dude I had a the same problem last night. Finally had someone with eyes on the prize. Last night on ps4 they were on top of the light house south of 76
---
Oh man I got a few of those!
---
It‚Äôs a torso mod. You probably can‚Äôt see the mod because you have ‚Äúonly craftable‚Äù option set at the PA station and you don‚Äôt have the required mats. Unset that option and it‚Äôll pop up in your torso mods.
---
What's your price?
---
Stairs and foundations are immune to damage, you can't break them. That is why people used to make "bunkers" out of nothing but foundations, because they are indestructible.
---
I‚Äôm available when you are
---
üëçüèº Usually SRB for solid rocket boosters, then the nuclear warhead would be the payload and the rest of the ‚Äòbody‚Äô carrying it is called the Upper Stage. Probably propelled by a liquid fuelled rocket engine.
---
2 of the annoying daily challenges imo:
---
take a camera picture of a behemoth &amp; mutant hound
---
take a camera picture of Graham st workshop
---
and they keeps coming back.....
---
Thank you found it!
---
Yup. It even appeared in my mutations.  So i cant get rid of it unless im grouped?.. Thanks for that suggestion i was completely lost now i atleast have an idea what to do
---
Were was it?
---
Might also depend on location cause so far all my encounters with hatchlings weren't successful.
---
I guess it‚Äôs not soo random.
---
The point they are getting at, is if this doesn't happen now, it won't happen with fast travel mats. As it is now, they could trap the area where people spawn in without fast travel mats. So adding fast travel mats won't change anything other than make it easier to stop people from accidentally spawning in your foundation or walls.
---
How do you check the hours? I'm on xbox
---
Seconded. Sadly.
---
Hey dude! Yeah it registered and all that, tried everything and now crafted a new cam, let‚Äôs see if it works now.
---
Start button, challenges, character challenges, hours in Appalachia
---
Don't rush through the game. Find a group of friends to play the game with, so much more enjoyable! Enjoy your stay!
---
Fingers crossed Mate!
---
Go and get those sweet atoms!
---
Cool I'll do it once I get home
---
USA launch the nukes first.
---
I don‚Äôt believe so. It‚Äôs a set amount of shots per core although I‚Äôm not positive about what happens if you make one at say, 110%.
---
Just on top of it as it‚Äôs launched. No balls
---
that seems to be the case. I had someone I know and trust a bit better and it showed as not known to him and he only knows combat and metal.
---
did yall lower 3 star legendary drop rates from 3 star mobs , cause my farming routes have been abysmal since the patch nothing but steady 1 star garbage....on every 3 star i kill....
---
Ledgendary Weapons &amp; armour are the main attraction. Bulk junk and aid is also good. Try to sell abit of everything for the best results. Happy trading!
---
I wish id have done this before i started so it may just be me but its up to you. My first character i invested perk points into useless perks that i didnt end up wanting or needing later down the road. Id suggest looking at everything available to give yourself an idea of the build you want before hand and while you play so you dont have to worry about moving points over and over and over after lvl 50 lol. I believe you can access the builder though this page, if im mistaken just google it. Lets you play with points and mess with all the perks. Play around with weapons and see what youll enjoy using before investing in those cards. Early on id say pharma perk under luck is good to have and help you stock up on stimpaks early on. Enjoy it, take your time and youll pick it up as you go! If your on xbox keep an eye out for me ill happily help you out.
---
I got one last night.  Checked the cemetery and the monument for 2 caps fast travel in between.  Took about 10 server hops and found one at the cemetery.
---
Who says we can't? My shop is called Sticky Pages and I use the neon letters to make it known.
---
My bloodied explosive is hard to beat I imagine.
---
Traveler's leather coat, green hood, and/or skull mask/plague doctor mask
---
Yup.  PVP losers who have to harass other players who don't want PVP becuase they can't cut it on the REAL PVP server.  They do this to farm caps like others have said.  There was a bug that would have you respawning in front of the ass hat over and over each time getting 1-shotted and losing caps. I'm pretty sure they fixed it with the last patch, but I no longer take workshops because of the PVP harassment they cause. BSG will simply not eliminate PVP in Adventure mode no matter what.
---
Penny is *GOLD*
---
If they ever think about remove her then she always can stay at my camp.
---
Down at the farm south of Watoga.  Sunrise Farm, Sunset Bog, something like that.  
---
I took out all the other mirelurks before throwing a molotov in the bog to chop it up with the queen.
---
I let a diseased hatchling bite me quite a few times after I took down the queen, because a friend and I were talking about rare diseases earlier in the week, and he assured me that the whoopsies came from diseased baby mirelurks.  Turns out it's true.  I did have to let the little shit bite me a few dozen times, and suck down a radaway to make myself more susceptible to catching a disease before it "took".
---
I've found a BSS WR Rolling Pin that I sold for 23k, and an AAE WR LMG that I traded for an AA/50/15 Lever Action that works very well. I'm going to try and find a BE15 Lever at some point to test a slightly modified build. I've had ok luck with Armor from Purveyor, but weapons are a total crapshoot.
---
I got all my marine plans from world spawns or treasure maps. never looked for them on vendors.
---
Ladies ride broke down gotta deal with this sorry
---
I do. But they never sell first of all, even good stuff. No one will buy my Bloodied railway rifle for 2k it's been weeks and I don't have the stash space for it at all. I can put 2-3 weapons in my stash b4 I'm over and get dozens of trash items that don't sell fast enough. Unless they up the stash space again it's not a viable market
---
Thx! Will give it a shot.
---
Congrats btw!
---
Always thought it was bugged but that post gave me hope!
---
So, I couldn't get the big glowing one off of me, and when I respawned, it spawned me back at camp with no stimpaks!
---
I swear this isn't my day.
---
What‚Äôs a consistent way to get caps cause I kinda wanna get the serums
---
Sorry.  I‚Äôll keep posting here as I find him, at least until I find a long coat.
---
What point? He is a commentator. And you are the audience, kid.
---
Lvl 300 and nearing the 2000 hours.. i has got nothing usefull to do in my life :)
---
Adrenal Reaction is bugged.  Still debating whether to jump in and try it, or simply write it off as a lost BSG cause.
---
I'd stock up on serums (I have 3 backup serums for each mutation I use in inventory) just in case something horrible happens.  You don't want to have to hunt down all the serums again - plus you'll probably want to start an alt character and they'll need mutations.  A good vendor will sell at about 400 -500 caps.  A great vendor will charge 250 (buy up if you find them).
---
And then everyone clapped?
---
Haha yeah the hunt is real, got over 3k stored and waiting for something really cool! And it finally worked with a crafted new cam
---
He is not getting bacon
---
OP wants that name to be displayed when someone is viewing via the map.
---
It worked, thanks!
---
What's so great about the Black Diamond anyway? Gives +1 STR, what else is so special, does it do extra damage over a normal Ski Sword?
---
Drink whatever alcohol the quest asked you, then pull a pistol or rifle, crouch, use vats, keep shooting until the crits meter filled, then do a shot with vats crits.
---
They definitely stack. Are you maybe not using a one handed weapon?
---
I forget what other rare disease I was trying to catch, it was a few months ago and I may have partaken of special hobbit pipe smoke earlier, but I had to let an angler hit me a couple dozen times before the disease "took".
---
I wish it worked that way for radworms and glowing pustules.  I can get those just by looking sideways at a diseased ghoul.  I don't even bother to cure those anymore unless I'm right next to the sulfur spring drinking fountain.
---
Thanks mate..will keep that in mind
---
Hi im here for the punch and pie? Somebody told me there would be punch and pie.
---
&gt;if people quit building large structures that they can't fill up then it's an issue on the player not o mechanics.
---
Not a problem if we get a lot more decoration and building items, which is what is one of the top camp things ppl have been asking to be added since the beginning.
---
I mean, nobody really wants a railway rifle. I think the bigger problem is that most of the weapons are worthless trash that nobody wants. I always put all my 3*s in my vendor while I'm waiting for the exchange to reset. Most never sell because really, who wants this junk?
---
I hit level 50 and never got my trophy. Gave it til level 54 and gave up on ever getting it. It actually made me put the game down for a while, but ive recently picked it back up. Gunna try again with a new character. I dont mind too much cause the new vendors are cool and Im sure i picked a few wrong perks along the way of my last character but now I know what im doing.
---
They do. Are you sure gladiator is the right perk for your weapon.
---
1 perk is 2 handed, another is 1 handed and another is unarmed (gauntlets and powerfists) 
---
What weapon are you using?
---
Flamer barrel with semi auto rifle perks is a good time.
---
Well then I don't know lol. Maybe My TV isn't set up right lol.
---
Brambles in the forest.  A broken off sharp stick hanging down from a tree.  Twisted your ankle on a loose rock.  Mosquitoes (non mutated).
---
I want to buy stuff for my camp in the atomic shop but my budget is full
---
I keep the duster as well. sometimes i want the open jacket look, sometimes the closed. both are cool!
---
In rifle gaming vids he sometime shows it.
---
I‚Äôm here for the free hat.
---
I'm having the same issue. I had missile turrets so I can still see the power cable going to where the turret was but no turrets sbd can't build more
---
&gt; breaks immersion
---
immersion is a lost battle in FO76
---
Probably PC user, they just leave the game on, go to bed and Steam still counts it as hours played
---
An armed post-apocalyptic society is a polite post-apocalyptic society.
---
Sallllllllllty
---
It's time for more servers and an code optimization engineers.  I'm all for bigger CAMPs, but the servers suck so bad now, I think the game would be unplayable if they taxed the servers any further.
---
Often happens when a food drink or chem effect wears off

I have to say PVP puts me on the edge of my seat, if I'm alone. I hate it because I'm old and I hate getting my junk taken. I hade instable Isotope and Electrically Charged as two mutations. I stay way away with PVP. I was doing an event and little did I know that because of those two mutations in the heat of battle another player was wounded by my mutations. I became red and they didn't think twice....whap whap, I was dead and all my junk gone. When I respawned, they messaged me and taunted me. Lower level but two of them. I had no idea of how I became red. Anywho a friend told me about those mutations and I got rid of them quick. Had I been with another player, I would go after my junk. Needless to say, if I see a low level that made a mistake like I did several times when I was starting out, I'll pick them off from a distance just so when I'm level 200, I may have completed the, "Kill 20 players," objective and get some atoms. That PVP seriously gets my adrenaline pumping and at my health now, I'm liable to have a heart attack! So, if I pick you off from a distance and you are below level 10 with a bounty on your head.....I'm sorry, I'm just trying to get to that achievement. Also, I'm too ashamed to come down and smash you with my sledge or fireax. I can't wait to get that achievement out of the way! Peace my brother's and sisters. Cyclops out.üëäüí•üëç
---
Awesome dude Bethesda needs to look at them
---
So this is a bit out of context but what is fo76 like now? Is it better or is it still the broken mess it was on release?
---
I'd imagine after this there would be constant complaints of "I had a workshop with a vendor set up and a griefer took the workshop from me rather buying my stuff" etc
---
This is a good idea :D
---
With right build BE will give you ridiculous DPS and beats everything. I think I would put AAE ahead of FE for full health, but that just my opinion.
---
Idk, I bought it yesterday but I'm bored. The world just feels so damn empty. I'm only level 5 and playing solo, that might be the problem.
---
sounds good :) give me a shout when you're back and I'll see if I can get some stuff together to trade for it.
---
Not  to worry, I'm on ps4. Thank you for the offer, though :)
---
Flux, ammo and plans sell well for me.
---
PC player "Tracycky" sells them for 350 caps per.
---
I just loaded up on mutations last night.
---
Honestly, I'd rather let raiders que. When they hit a set number in que, they spawn you in at a random raider camp on a random server and your group gets rewarded based on total damage dealt (like, maybe give the same prize pool/chances, but just get an extra roll for every X damage). Not even \*just\* PvP, so much as the full raider experience, trying to survive the world of Fallout with shit AC, a bent pipe pistol, diry water, and a LOT OF JEEEEEEEEEETTTTTTTTTFWOOOSHHHHHOOOOMMMMMAAAAN that stuff will make you jittery!
---
It only affects how quickly Fusion Cores deplete when used in Power Armour unfortunately.
---
There's a certain Magazine that reduces Heavy Weapon ammo usage by 20%, maybe keep an eye out for it in player vending and use it in long or tough battles?
---
Although I'm xbox based, there is a possibility your issue is your layout of your base, if this is where you are having problems. I wasn't able to access my weapons bench until I made a slight adjustment in the placement of another bench. I would get the animation to begin use  but then drop back to standard view. It wasn't until one of the benches was shifted it completed the process. Perhaps there's an issues stopping you from stepping back when finished?
---
Haha nice, glad you were able to get it eventually. 
---
Easiest method I've found is this.
---
Stand shallow end. Attack your buddy/helper to initiate PvP. 
---
They attack back until they down you in the water.
---
Note since its PvP you can't just revive. The person not in water needs to send a Team invite. While the 30 second countdown is running, you'll see popup of invite, hold options (ps4) and accept invite.
---
Once in a team, option to revive you appears.
---
Don't loot everything. 
---
Your inventories are limited. 
---
Unless you are building your camp you only really need enough resources to do repairs, cooking or any short term goal you may have (ie; quest repairs/crafting, crafting ammo, brewing, making chems, etc)
---
Focus on rare commodities. Screws, adhesive (make an adhesive farm at your camp) ballistic fiber. You can mark these items in your pipboy in inventory/junk component view. 
---
You shouldn't fear being overencumbered but you shouldn't get carried away with collecting everything. 
---
Having said that, learning to craft mods for weapons/armor is done by scrapping that item. So collect plenty of those, nake your way to the nearest work bench, red rockets and train stations will have those as well as your stash box, break down those weapons, stash any valuable resources and continue with your day.
---
Taken during queen run
---
No ranged legendaries. All 3 rifleman perks maxed, used the fixer and lvl 50 combat rifle which does 90 damage. Black diamond sword for melee fights. I was in my PA and used around 5-6 diluted stimpacks, along with 3-4 blood packs. After dealing with all of the ghouls, boss fight in the last room didnt feel like much of a challenge.
---
I do the same thing lol
---
I want long distance area chat if we're going to do that, make sure the wag can hear us.
---
Sell 1400 caps worth of stuff to a vendor per day.
---
If you have spare perk card points, invest in 3x Bargain for better vendor prices
---
If you can run it, West Tek super mutants drop a ton of guns and they sell for 18-24 caps each. 
---
Sell every weapon/armor you pick up
---
Sell all your purified waters/stims/drugs/food since you'll get them from running events and open world. I start my game session with less than 5 food/water/drugs
---
Yeah its not so bad till you realize they are meant to be talking to little kids not adults there unmodified pre war robots.
---
Was using death tambo. After equipping though, the damage didn't change. Maybe it takes a few seconds to register?
---
It has come a very long way from release.  There are still bugs, but nothing like before.  They have added content, and basically created 2 servers: PVE and PVP.  There is still limited PVP on the PVE servers, but mostly in relation to bounties.
---
Was using death tambo maybe it takes a few secs to register?
---
Bog town. Pylon side. Both will spawn near each other every now and then. Don't die....
---
How much?
---
The chances of getting a Behemoth at bot town while mutant hounds are there seems so small.  I've hopped there hundreds of times and never seen it happen.
---
Death tambo won't work. You need Iron Fist perk for that (punching). It's considered unarmed (talons mutation will work on it) and twisted muscles will all stack. 
---
The gladiator and slugger are for weapons like swords, bats, axes.
---
Weird. Happened to me the last two times I was there. Stupid RNG
---
That video intro gave me rad worms. I refuse to watch it. Could you post your build here, for us to see?
---
Very nice - if you‚Äôre into RP, I happen to know a great discord for it - about to start an event for the server too.
---

Thanka you the link
---
i do , i shouldnt hafta delete ATOM stuff to buy ATOM stuff ...that i cant place in my damn camp , if they intend to sell any CAMP atom goods they need to way increase it , like 40% more than its current max
---
I buy all fluorescent flux under 80 caps I ever find. Also enjoy seeing 5mm and 5.56 ammo for a cap apiece, and any unknown cheap-ish plans. I tend not to buy weapons/armor much, but a friend buys any terrible 3* piece under a few hundred caps just for scrip.
---
Okay thank you
---
I wasn't sure if it had been patched or not, so I've been keeping it. The only thing I've been able to find on it is that they patched animal friend from working on them.
---
Okay thanks
---
It's immediate soon as equiped. The perk doesn't work with death tambo. You need Iron Fist
---
Just a joke. That would be wack if they did
---
Excellent grammar and logic
---
Tambo is unarmed I believe. I primarily use unarmed, death claw gauntlet, mole miner gauntlet, power fist, etc all unarmed.
---
The quick toolbar image of it should be a hand, right?
---
You'll want the iron fist perk.. Only 3 levels of it available though, cause unarmed gets powerful ;)
---
quad with perforating, anti-armor with drum, everything else stinging.
---
K thanks for your help
---
That or make it so that you get greater buffs proportional to the number of mutations you have. Say a 2% damage increase and  2 DR, ER and RR per mutations.
---
With all 18 Mutations you could have 36% more damage for weapons and 36 DR, ER and RR per piece.
---
This would make it a serious contender with Vanguard and Bolstering gear sets.
---
&gt;I don't know anyone who actually does the event as everyone just puts down a fusion generator.
---
I recently started a new character, so didn't have fusion generator plans or the materials to make a generator to waste on a workshop that might get contested by a higher level character who wants to make their own fusion cores.  Almost every night when I started playing, I'd take the workshop, then repair the power plant myself to power the fusion core generator and all the other extractors.  The power up event isn't that bad, lots of enemies for experience and materials.
---
I wouldnt be half as salty if Howard would have communicated this 6 months ago.
---
The funny thing is that Fallout 4 was the least buggy launch from Bethesda since, probably ever. Todd even said that in the last 6 months, no new content was added, they just focused on bug fixes and refinement. Compare that to Fallout 3 where "the making of" video told that they were adding new content up to two weeks before release. Fallout 4 felt like it suffered a bit for it, but who knows.
---
And I agree that if Fallout 76 was released now, it wouldn't have been able to be made fun of as much. But I think the hate would still be there ss the bugs just exacerbated the announcement hate.
---
i disagree it needs to be increased substantially or they need to reduce Junk weapon and armor weight significantly.... or make weight reducing effects work on stash as well as your person ....any of those would significantly improve the player experience...i spend most my damn time now battling the encumbrance monster while wearing excavator armor just to lug it all around cause it cant fit in my shop to sell .... 
---
]
---
You know you look bad and it‚Äôs upsetting you üòÇ
---
Of course it's a risk but one I'd be willing to take. 
---
In fact I was going to take. I learned you can't vend in workshops just now. I needed to get rid of plans, I took a work shop just to see if I could vend there. 
---
If I could've I would just have left and dealt with whatever ramifications came of it.
---
Did you kill them or ran?
---
It's only useful on high fire rate weapons. Not sure if it stacks.
---
gtfoh you silly ass bastard ....
---
I like this. Good #'s
---
Nice! Gotta stop by some day
---
Friends and family...  so important, even in the wasteland...
---
Things like this is why lettering should take up a lot less CAMP budget.  
---
I‚Äôd love to put up ‚ÄúThe Road Not Taken‚Äù by Robert Frost and notices like ‚ÄúWater for weary travelers‚Äù but I don‚Äôt have enough CAMP budget left..
---
I‚Äôm thinking that they need to let us make custom signs, which would reduce the number of items that they need to draw in the game.  They could sell different types of wood, letter type, etc.  in the atom store.
---
Looks nice hope it goes well
---
Mmmmmmmm
---
He replied before I added that. In fact I added that as a direct response to his comment.
---
you obviously dont sell anything worth a damn in your shop lol
---
Damn just don‚Äôt play it. The 20 percent xp boost is good and people aren‚Äôt that much of an issue. It‚Äôs harder than adventure, that‚Äôs what I like
---
Lol just have a player stand next to a car or use a fat man or gernade and pasified or not ur still a corpse
---
I'd like it just so my TSE handmade won't vanish on me.  Skins were reputed to make it next to impossible to accidentally drop/sell/scrap a treasured legendary.  Why they pick the lamest weapons to skin is beyond me....
---
I went from excavator to x01 by dumping everything on the ground and pick up one by one only the ones I must have. That way I knew what‚Äôs absolutely necessary and what‚Äôs just a luxury to have. Now my total weight is about 200 lbs so I can carry 150 more in x01. if I go farming for lead or steel I still jump in my Excavator.
---
I've gotten sludge lung from creatures, and from the environment...and it doesn't register.
---
All of them?
---
Be on the lookout for caps stashes as well, a perception perk card called fortune finder makes a noise, and luck perk card cap collecter allows you to search the container for even more possible caps.
---
There's a subreddit for vendors to advertise, perfect place to leave feedback. Sadly it isn't seeing much use.
---
I might get it then, I hope Bethesda learned from this and they'll go back to the quality they used to be
---
Not true. Yesterday I had this happen to me and despite me ALWAYS having pacifist mode on, I was able to get shot once and turn around and obliterate the pesky intruder with my mole miner gauntlet
---
I honestly think these prices are even too high. I price plans at around 10% of the list value for higher dollar items (above 100 caps) and usually price stuff less than 100 caps at around 25% if they are useful (like armor mods or rare recipes) and at 10% for normal stuff like tables lights and tea recipes.
---
I personally have not bought a legendary for anything more than about 100 per star, and honestly I usually won't buy over the item's list value (like a vampire baton for example, is worth about 16 caps). I don't know what the "buy rate" is right now but I can guarantee it isn't 250 per star. I couldn't move a 3 star, two shot, level 50, gatlin gun modded with the best mods for 400 caps. I tried for almost a full week.
---
Everyone already has their duped two shot explosive whatever, so all other legendaries are effectively worthless.
---
Again, not an expert or local. My understanding is that conformity and excellence are a big part of their culture. You're expected to essentially be an optimal person during most of your daily activities and interactions, and failure to do so leads to social judgement.
---
Their culture is significantly less violent than my own (USA), but didn't they just have a mass knife killing there or something? Not sure, my wife mentioned it while I was busy and have no idea if that's the correct nation.
---
Other then the jerks that trys to kill low lvl people when the low lvl never wanted to. I agree
---
Love the idea, but need to be careful in how it's implemented. Probably need different categories.
---
For example if someone comes to my camp looking for good armor and all i have is outfits. He might give me a poor rating. Yet someone else will be ecstatic finding all the outfits they want. It wouldn't be fair to give a poor rating because vendor simply doesn't have what your'e looking for. 
---
In a situation like that, i can see someone being negatively impacted for no real reason.
---
Power user will double the shots in a Gatling laser. Gatling plasma do not benefit. Instead you can craft double durability plamsa cores and get up to 500 shots per core instead of 250.
---
If so then that‚Äôs a d1ck move. Specially for the Xbox X
---
This. Look at the OP's post history. He's just a troll.
---
Yeah that's what OP was advocating for, a spawn around the perimeter
---
Staying here until 8pm Eastern.
---
It's an anti-grief measure, I am guessing. Possibly combined with "Lets not have antigrav bases". Who knows, maybe they'll fix it eventually.
---
The Gatling gun fire rate is bugged. It shows 10x what it really is.
---
Also, the rate of fire is basically rounds per 10 seconds, from what I've heard. Divide RoF by 10 and you get your rounds per second. So a 91 fire 50cal fires 9 rounds per second.

HAHA yes exactly. The C in SPECIAL can also stand for Civility! Unfortunately, i dunno if I'm well equipped to mow them down. Then they call their equally uncivilized friends and blam, I'm dead.
---
While he was at 76 specifically tho? And the "owner";  I thought Vault Tec was a giant public company? I do t suppose you have any links to this? Sounds familiar as I've played Mothership Zeta but that was yeeeears ago
---
Do you happen to know what  it's called?
---
That's really unfortunate.  Have you tried an alt character?  I managed to complete some world challenges that failed to register on my main character....location discoveries, magazines and the like.
---
Not giving BGS a pass on it, and it's definitely something that needs fixing, just saying that for whatever reason I can do certain things on one character that I can't with the other, and progress on social/world/combat/etc challenges seems to be account-wide.  My main sniper character has certainly never killed 1000+ robots with a blunt weapon, but my melee/power armor alt definitely has.
---
Don't forget the level 200's also leave behind level 68 super mutants and ghouls sometimes.  Once you get armored up and have a halfway decent legendary weapon, it's actually a fast way to level up. A round at Whitesprings almost guarantees a level up.
---
Same.
---
Seriously, go to adventure for PvP.
---
Honestly tho, haven't had anyone try to PvP me in ages.  Made plenty of friends tho, when they discover I can obliterate a hoard while still letting them tag the legendary.
---
yeah for sure, the lay is pretty much idendical, go down the lift, the gym is not far from entrance. lots of lead. Heavy mind.
---
I proved my point. And as I said before... This dude cant look at himself as a fo76 redditer, but loves to call everyone else out. but I'll put an emote to apease you. üòÇ As youre obviously dissatisfied and wanting more.
---
For anyone else that needs to get this done, it‚Äôs so much easier to do this in Wavy Willard‚Äôs.
---
Find one of the several pools, take your armor off, agro a scorched, stand in the pool with the person reviving behind you.
---
When the scorched downs you, make sure the other person is in the pool with you when they do the revive. This works in the shallowest pool I could find 100% of the time. I‚Äôve done this about 10 times for people.
---
I got handcuffs for all of 'em. Plenty of room for Flo and the Sonic Guys too.

Yep... that thing rocked.  Sheepsquatch story was better, but forget those pylons.  Those suuuuuuck.

Remember kiddos,

StarField is going to run on the SAME ramshackle, jury-rigged engine that brought you two decades of the same bugs and crashes.
---
Let Todd Howard ramble on about what his product is going to become. A turd will never become cheesecake.
---
There are some nice spots between Top of the World and south towards site Alpha.  There are streams and ponds all along that section.  Just be careful not to put it near the bear spawn points and you should be good.
---
Clearly, he wanted human bacon. Nom nom.
---
Yea but as soon as we get more decorations )yes I agree we could use more) then people with those big empty full budget builds will be whining for more build budget cause they didn't plan ahead and or down size their building to accommodate the current restrictions that are in the game for stability issues ( not that I agree thats the reason but it's the stated resion). I used to build big and had those open areas in my build. Got tired of the look of "too poor to decorate" so I down sized. Have a fully decked out lodge decorated 2 vendors , 4 small purifiers and 6 turrets and still have 45% budget left over
---
Had a wanted dude ask me to kill him, and its like "hell no."  I know you have a buddy waiting to snipe me, piss off.
---
Nope everyone submitted their own bill to the city. Hence the city loan.
---
He‚Äôs aware he‚Äôs on here just like everybody else. He‚Äôs just calling out the trash. Idk how you‚Äôre this dumb, kid.
---
Bethesda would make the spaceships use the same damn fly/air attack/land cycle as the Skyrim Dragons and the Scorchbeasts, I guaran-damn-the it.
---
We do really need some heavy damage energy rifles from the Aliens. The plasma gun just isn't as good as it was in FO4, and the Alien Blaster is so bad it shouldn't have seen been in game
---
The only time mine emptied was when I had to store it when I was changing my camp. It should stay the same every session, no refilling necessary
---
I was pvping a dude and one hit with a death claw thing I went down and I was in high lvl X01 power armor and it was a lvl 30 dude and I was not trolling him we had a little tournament. Please Bethesda

If in WhiteSprings only the finest of Legendaries.

If in flatwoods, stimpacs, adhesive and level 1 fully modded hunting rifles

I... I... üò≠ Dear God save me.
---
EXACTLY. BSG needs to spend the Atom money they make on servers and optimization. Zero chance they'll increase anything that will implode the servers in their current state. Once they do that I'd like 1000 stash capacity.
---
May end up having to do it again in the future. The "Camera shots stop registering for challenges" bug happens often and seemingly at random.
---
Just started event
---
This precisely. You gotta think of the buyer here.
---
Most of the common plans are things newer players can use. Newer players don't have a lot of caps.
---
Older players don't want garbage legendaries.
---
Chems at 15 is a good mix because both older and newer players use those and I think 15 is totally fair. Same is true with ammo. All types are pretty common if you know what to hunt. 1 cap per ammo regardless of type is fair except missiles because those just clutter up inventory and I usually throw those in a sack.
---
But hey, if people want to not sell stuff because they are asking too much it's fine by me. Lower level players often way over price their stuff because it isn't as easy to get excess.
---
I'll have to give this a try.
---
I don't know about goat legs but the the percentages stack for the fall damage reduction legs (50%+50% = 100%).
---
Power user also affects fusion cores in the gatling laser
---
I got some loot you can buy.
---
Lol, I've got like 400 caps total right now!
---
The best luck I've had for violet has been out by Harper's Ferry.  I know that's not White Springs, but I hope it's helpful!
---
Oh damn, the Zetans are definitely active in Appalachia then
---
Not my experience at all, I use a bloodied one, and I only use 2/5 gunsmith, it lasts a long time. Are you using a 2shot varient? 2shot is baaad for durability
---
I don‚Äôt have problems with the laser and plasma gun. Yeah the damage is low but it makes up for the ammo and the added effects the guns can deploy. 
---
And the alien blaster i see why they nerfed hard. The crit it uses is too much for a multiplayer fallout.
---
I actually have 2 characters on the 1 account and Sludge Lung won't register for either of them.
---
Most studios that have been around for a while have used the same tech for most if not all their games. 
---
Saying Starfield is going to run on the same engine, inferring it‚Äôll be the same as the current version, is extremely reductive. Sure it‚Äôll be the creation engine but it will likely be heavily modified from the current iteration since it‚Äôs likely a while before it comes out.

R/FO76stores
---
Only 20 actual store posts. 
---
3 of those from the same person.
---
Well it's good to know they're not bugged at least.
---
DollaCoffee on PC
---
Evidence for that?
---
Are you doing 2-handed or 1-handed melee?
---
I wish I could help you out.  Try submitting a ticket to BGS?  At the very least, it'll put that fact on their whiteboard as something to fix.
---
I mean, I still have Fever Claw and Heat Flashes to acquire.  One of those could turn out to be my Sludge Lung impossibility.
---
Just got my PS4 back, is project paradise still available? Or was it just for Wild Appalachia? Anything new to jump into? New quests?
---
I would like to at least be able to build a town of 5-6 decent sized buildings but I doubt the engine would be able to handle that
---
I sell plans, ammo at 1c (Plasma Cores at 100c), serums, shielded under armors, bug parts, scrap (screws at 3c each; bulk lead, bulk steel), rare outfits, and random stuff like Grape and Orange Nukas.
---
The variety seems to help keep me going.
---
Next part should be replacing the broken motors with your crafted ones. Looking for a box on a stick roadside in the mire. If I remember correctly, there is one next to a sign north of the crevase dam. Once you replace one, the quest should show markers.
---
Aluminum, Lead, Adhesive, Screws .... but at reasonable rates .... sells like hot cakes .. especially lead and screws.  (I've made over 10 000 caps on farming these junk items alone, since Vendor station launch .... and I haven't really been trying that hard)
---
\*\*\* Weapons and Armour .... but only if they are good.  With the right prefix (Unyielding, Bolstering, Bloodied, AA, TwoShot, Instigating, Furious, Executioner .... and Junkie if you are willing to wait for the right customer) a one star will sell, but ONLY if if is the top weapon in its class (handmade, lever, ski sword, etc. ... the rest, no one buys - not even polehooks which are the best in their class)
---
Other legendaries sell, and sell quickly, if you sell them low enough to scrip.
---
Ammo:  .45, .556, shotgun, fusion cell .... at one cap/round ..... very little else sells (maybe .308, i've never tried)
---
Some specialized PA parts, modified with expensive, and hard to acquire mods .... but they take up a tonne of room in your stash box.
---
Awesome, thank you for this! I basically bought the gun to turn in to the legendary scrapper because it was a 3‚≠ê for only 500 caps through another player's vending machine. After I saw that rate of fire, I thought it might be worth hanging onto. Guess I'll be turning it in after all.
