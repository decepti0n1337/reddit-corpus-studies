For Nuclear Winter - it's best to make everyone go to the main menu and join as a team in the social tab there. The party leader then controls when to play.
---

---
For Adventure/Survival - go ahead and click join, find them on the map and click on them, always has a send team invite there.
---
---
---
Awesome idea! Wish I would have had someone to show me the ropes when I first started. Probably would have been a good ice breaker for me, too, as far as playing a game with over real people. I've been a solo gamer for so long. Because of that, I play 76 solo despite it being a multiplayer experience. I do a lot of trades and sales but, when the deal is done I'm on my way.
---
Plus, I'm an older gamer and have reservations about playing with the younger crowd lol.
---
Anyway, I applaud you. I think it's awesome what you're doing so, keep up the good work and good deeds!! I could never do what you do but, I do try to help out the newbs when I can...in my own way - it's just not a very social experience.
---
Whats CS:GO?
---
Yeah my gamertag is suspended. And I bought the digitally. The friend I played the game with thinks I was suspended for having too many springs (which I’d been saving and looting off the people I killed forever). I’d been saving springs from about level 50 to my current level, 110. But I figured their algorithm only suspended duped items not just any large amount of items.
---
Wait till this guy turns in some scrip...
---
Bro this is fallout 76 lore, they are time travelers, gotta think outside the box
---
Teams have been a bit glitchy the past couple weeks. If you can’t invite someone, see if they can invite you. Try having all members exit their respective teams and reform if you’re still having issues. 
---
Or try forming the team outside of the game first and select the play as team option.
---
What do you mean "you people" ?
---
Great dude!
---
It’s free... it can’t get more worth it then that.
---
"titty fucking christ I HATE the DMV!" might be the realist thing I've read all day.
---
Just call me Mr. Sneaky Sniper 😎
---
Cheers to you too - One more thing, I’m pretty sure you can do this on PC, perhaps on PS4 as well - I think you can turn off your audio from other players completely, which could significantly lower any anxiety. If you do encounter a griefer, just let him hop around you like an idiot and go about your own business.
---
Damn, and I only got ganked by 3 kids in power armor in survival. I managed to kill 2 by popping all my chems &amp; using my shotgun &amp; grenades though but the 3rd guy 1 shot me
---
So three of the same model different colors. Right. So one skin.
---
Thanks for the reply. I'll keep that in mind before I attempt that quest again. 
---
I don't get a lot of free time. Wasting what little free time I do have doing the same quest line over and over and over again just doesn't appeal to me.
---
DEAR GOD
---
Okay just from playing alot more I've gotten most of it down I think. It sucks because I'm terrible against other players but I love this game mode. The only thing I'm still not sure about is if you can even get well rested or well tuned? I feel like it's not a thing. And the expired stimpaks seem to be working the same as the others but idk still
---
Dude it’s amazing. You should totally check it out! What platform do you play on?
---
Not used to aim assist. I always turn it off when able to. The game overall just needs polish. Again, this is constructive criticism, not toxicity.
---
As a level 3 that took nearly an hour to figure out I had a machete, I thank you.
---
Also a shout out to the person who helped me as I tried to punch 6 mongrels to death.
---
What do YOU mean "you people"?
---
Love stuff like this. Can’t wait to try it out. Someone was also suggesting hiding in portopotties and pot shooting people and running back In lol
---
The only winning move is not to play...
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
How about a nice game of chess?
---
Someone launched a nuke on the small circle yesterday so me being me ran out and got killed. I came second but the nuke killed everyone on the team th aat launched it and we ended in a stalemate.
---
It’s good to know you’re out there, balancing out the more saccharine antics of others.
---
10/10 predict this will happen in a later update.
---
Right who even cares about lore? Ill just make it up something with robots taking over just like everything else in fallout, right. I dont play the game for lore i play it for totall noob annhialtaon for sure brother
---
That's true too
---
&gt;I don't mind the hate because it will dissuade Bethesda and other companies from the shoddy practice of launching games in an unacceptable state with the notion of "We'll just fix it later".
---
&gt;But I also feel like Bethesda deserves credit for turning the ship around. 
---
???
---
Why would we give credit to them for 
---
&gt;"We'll just fix it later"
---
Set up up a lvl 9 squeaker last night.  Made him a a 10mm smg,  over 1k rounds,  fully modded leather limbs and metal chest.  Took him to uranium fever,  inspirational 3 being shared.  Tag em,  I kill them.  Then had him sell the guns with hard bargain being shared,  easy set set up
---
It's a weekly thing... New around here?
---
that’s so awesome. I haven’t played much due to work but when I do, I’m always happy when someone needs help or even helps me when I’m literally sucking at the game. you the real mvp!!
---
Wish there was a unique reward for no one "winning"
---
sorry i have no clue
---
Have everyone you want on your team in the main menu and send a team invite through the social tab. Once everyone has joined the team - also checkable in the social tab - party leader can take everyone into NW.
---
I've only played 2 rounds. Second time in, my squad win win no mics. So piss off.
---
When you move your camp, everything is stored. So when you place it back down, it’ll be in your ‘stored’ tab.
---
Titty fucking Christ lmao
---
If photo mode is available, get good at pulling it up and exiting it quickly.
---
I use it in adventure to peak around corners or under platforms from time to time.
---
That is great work! I wish you had a way to track them and see how many stick it out past level 100 or see who quits playing early, etc. I’m willing to bet that the majority of the players whom go through your training camps end up becoming long term players. 
---
Bethesda should be paying you for this work.
---
Thanks buddy
---
Everything gets downvoted when posted here. It's pretty standard. Don't take it personally. Some people hate that you're playing this game.
---
I love this idea man, this truly is the FO76 community in a nutshell, really caring and exceptionally generous to new players
---
Ah don't like people teaching others?
---
whollly macarooni :D' im on xbox how much off is the discount.
---
Is this announced or presented somewhere? Or do you have to find it by scanning through the Atom shop and/or CAMP menus to see what's new? Because it would be really nice if there was a popup dialog box or something selectable in the menu that told you what you just got. My Overseer 4 box dropped at the moment I died and I was busy figuring out what happened, I didn't see anything listed saying what was in it (maybe I missed it).
---
Tagging u/Ladydevann in the hopes that if this isn't visible somewhere now, it can be made more visible in the future. Also, something in Vault 51 or in the menu that lets you see your overseer level progress and next rewards would be nice. Currently I only see that immediately after death.
---
If anything it’s sub machine gun but I’m glad everyone is sleeping on it
---
My Mic just dies randomly and I can't talk for some reason.
---
This is the only game that does it and resetting the game fixes the problem. I've also noticed that leaving party chat also causes this problem.
---
Basically. I know they caught a lot of shit for doing BR but you don’t have to do it. You can okay the whole game and never touch it but if they fill out the mini games and do rewards to keep people going back for goodies shit there is hardly a limit for it. Even doing goofy ones or like a horror theme for fall. It was smart as long as it stays as a side optional item. It’s a good grind break so I’m glad they did it.
---
The more you level up your overseer rank the vault becomes more accessible in sections, more games you play and level up you have more than enough time to explore the vault.
---
Yeah just happened to me twice. Gave up.
---
This happens to me on PC
---
Like a countdown? A countdown would totally buy everyone those precious seconds in the beginning.
---
pipe revolver is the best because if you attach a rifle stock to it then both rifleman and gunslinger perks affect the damage
---
Nothing I’ve said disagrees with that.
---
where did you buy it for $11??
---
Hopefully someone on Xbox comments, because I'm on PC. I wish I could be more helpful!
---
I know but I am curious does it always have to put down on the floor because I want to get it off the road but I am not ready to set up camp anywhere and don't want my camp to be put anywhere!
---
Yeah i think we would get to walk around the vault. I don’t see why we wouldn’t be able too. Fallout thrives on story and exploration. I personally think we will end up getting to go into vault 51 and use a terminal to que
---
That's true...
---
So annoying, I keep getting hyped seeing all the posts about it and I can’t even play
---
Nope I just suck at pvp and having big blue targets makes it easier.
---
if you're low on required junk moving it also repairs it. just an fyi
---
In all honestly I have been playing since release and have enjoyed it. Each update has been fun and interesting.
---
You're fucking USELESS in this game if you can't talk to your teammates.
---
Go into the social menu and invite to team, once they accept the invite and successfully join, you can load up NW and they will be put in your squad
---
20 minutes of gameplay and then 20 minutes of loading times needs to be fixed
---
I enjoy helping people 
---
Die.
---
You both need to be in the main menu.  One needs to invite the other to join a team while still in the menu.  Once you've teamed up, the "Play" button should turn into "Play with Team"
---
Have fun!
---
I thought there was a free trial, is it only pc

I play on the PS4. When it was first announced, I was so stoked to explore Virginia and chase Mothman. Then I was turned off from it. I've seen some good reviews thus far though!
---
I actually lol'd
---
No offense, but were you expecting to be impressed when you clearly don’t like BR in general?
---
I’m level 56 and every high level player (100-200something) I’ve come across has been a dick. Shooting at me while I’m trying to trade at a station, showing up at my base pretending to be nice and then destroying shit (before player vending), and just overall being entitled dicks.
---
YOU STILL FUCKING LOST!
---
So do I but, I have gotten in the top 10 the last several game just hiding.
---
Winner gets a nukashine
---
General?
---
No problem, they have to be on your friends list though, you can’t invite “recent” players to your team
---
But of course downvoting instead of wanting to have a discussion about why this is a problem.
---
This is exactly sort of issue that Bethesda will overlook and will mean game will peeter out and die because of frustrating inbalance.
---
I don't know. Should you?
---
I found a match 10 seonds after I posted this lmao.
---
I do other things than play video games with my friends. Don't be a fucking coward and turn on your microphone.
---
I'm slow moving through the game also. I'm level 89 now but, I still haven't explored most of the Cranberry Bog and a big chunk of the Mire. Never done a silo run and launched a nuke yet either. And I've only been in a nuked zone 3 times. Absolutely nothing wrong with taking your time progressing through the game. I don't know how many hours I have into the game but, I know it's a lot. But still having a lot of fun and not even close to being bored.
---
You don't have to have team fill enabled if your team is getting you killed. I don't team and prefer it currently.
---
LOL the image make me laugh. \*tink\* looks around \*tink\* sees lowbie \*tink\* shakes head and goes back to making ammo.
---
But... free junk?
---
I think you may in fact just not like BR in general.
---
So don’t play it? The game mode is completely optional and doesn’t give any benefit to the other mods other than cosmetic but that might not impress you either
---
I find someone almost every game because I'm not a COWARD and I break the ice myself.
---
any fixes? i'm having the same problem
---
Yes you can build same as in adventure but you dont need mats.
---
Yeah I accidentally made it to the final teams on my second go 😂 I’m horrible at pvp and had managed to not get seen even running around lost the whole round. Got the final teams message and promptly died haha but it’s still so much fun.
---
Your welcome.
---
Yea I just made a post about that. Unless u can get confined kills turtling is the best thing to do. And the cabin with the broken floor at the Greg resort is the best place for that, theres holes in the walls and shit but only one entrance and it's very central for the first few circles.
---
hello?
---
Could be because of restricted NAT type
---
Did you miss the wastlanders announment?
---
I have a microphone, and friends. 
---
Maybe people don't want to play with some random talking at them down the mic.
---
Join a discord or something- plenty lfg servers out there
---
Before the legendary vendor I never got anything good off drops. Was level 200+ before I got my first explosive weapon. Everything I own came from a trade or sale. A majority of it was duped I’m sure. One seller wasn’t even trying to hide it as they had multiples but the price was cheap and couldn’t pass it up. At the time it was the only way to get anything good. 
---
Now the drops seem to be better and sometimes the legendary vendor may give something useful to sell or trade.
---
Killing people who otherwise may kill you.
---
I'm sure EA is responsible for at least some of the bad, but the developers (or at least management) really truly goofed in some pretty horrible ways.
---
Let me put it this way, EA+Bioware=nothing good.
---
But yeah, in the big picture I think Bethesda will be used as an example of how to recover from a bad release (and hopefully not repeat as badly), while Anthem will be used as an example of a AAA developer that truly failed from start to finish.
---
In the Anthem subreddit most players seem pretty certain the game will simply be abandoned sooner than later. And that's almost certainly going to be because of EA. I hope they close Bioware honestly.
---
If you didn't like the base game, why do you think you'll like the add ons? It's still fundamentally the same game.
---
I need to be able to run not just sprint for a sec. Also last laugh need to be fixed so it happens after you die not when u get downed.
---
\-1 enemy on a server, I guess.
---
It's a hit or miss thing for me, seems like most of the people I try and give things to run off or back out of the trade. A drop box at camps would be cool!
---
Level 1 can’t even be killed right?
---
Thank You 
---
#:')#
---
It’s not for everyone. Happy trails I suppose!
---
I usually go up and punch them once with the butt of my gun.  Then they figure it out and start cussing me.  Haha
---
I agree, but to be honest it's peobably not going to cha ge much. There will still be people with a lot of free time who will quickly level up in NW and the divide between players is there again.
---
A balance might exist, but it's more complicated than just having a different set of SPECIAL points.
---
A cool idea is if u have a large group of friends yall can set ur camps encircling Whitesprings and it is fun too see dozens of artillery go off
---
I just got into a lagfest match, everyone was teleporting everywhere and I died instantly to a molotov detonating a meter away from me. I think I'll pass this experience.
---
Sounds like it’s not the game for you if you quit after only a couple of quests :/
---
No. They give us all of the tools we need to talk in the fucking game itself. I like queuing with random people and playing the video game. Just turn on your goddamn microphone and stop being a fucking coward.
---
Responders!
---
I guess they are man but I’d still much rather have some one close by who can do a lot more than that.
---
Too busy testing 🤓
---
No. The entire point of this mode is to extract money from the pockets of you idiots. Cough up.
---
As long as your teammates have functioning cerebellums (not always guaranteed), mics aren’t really necessary. In fact, some guy kept blathering random crap on his last night and only served to distract our team. 
---
Stick fairly close together, make sure your flanks are covered, and avoid open areas if at all possible. Let the gung-ho teams weed each other out as you make your way quietly to the next point, stopping at high ground to see what you can see, and only engaging targets of opportunity.
---
Lots of new players, lots of venders, lots of grinders around WS. But not many people doing boss events.
---
I love reading things like this.  I just downloaded the free trial to check it out and have played a few hours.  I've got hundreds of hours played in previous Fallouts, and had skipped this one just because of the whole online thing.  
---
It's been a long time since I've played an online game that seemed to have nice players like yourself.  I fully expected there to be a horde of high levels chilling right outside the vault waiting to mow me down 10 times over and then just deleting the game.  Instead, I was able to roam around and scavenge a bit and do a few quests and wasn't bothered.
---
I won't have a lot more time to play this weekend, but I've decided to go ahead and buy it so I can see if it stays nice.  So, thanks to you for treating others nice, maybe this can turn into a nice semi-popular game with a fun community.
---
This is a great idea, and you know they're going to do this in the future!
---
I noticed the same, I’ve given away soooooo much stuff this evening, it’s actually been quite nice lol.
---
Find someone willing to show you the ropes. Moat players are nice and like helping out. Its no biggie to ask for basic help. Or watch a youtube video of how to play it. Eat drink kill stash build repeat
---
Somewhere between level 5 and 10 is a small stash box. Level 10 has an overseer chair and level 16 has a medium stash box for your camps. I'm only level 16 now so I don't know what's past that besides a bunch of icons
---
To be honest I did that with elder scrolls oblivion, killed a few rats...boring took it back for a refund.
---
Re bought it after hearing how much people liked it and it became my most played game with several hundred hours into it 🤷‍♂️
---
Don’t force yourself. If you don’t like it walk away. Have you played any other fallout games?
---
Which system?
---
Glory to the risen
---
the impact is not the point, the point is they sold this game on the promise of cosmetic only. By letting little things like this go because they have very little impact allows them to keep pushing the boundary until we have them nerfing food/drink rates to sell us refrigerators only acquirable from the atomic shop. This game is ripe to be monetized, and it likely would be more if it didn't bomb as hard as it did.
---
If these repair kits were in since Day 1 it would be more an impact, as most players have enough resources to repair without issue.
---
Was it still broken and in need of relogging a few times?  I liked the quest over all, but in the immediate post BETA, that quest took so many attempts for all the terminals to work the right way.
---
I think PA should be used for major engagements. I do that in FO4; I leave it home unless I think a major battle is coming. 
---
I think it would not make much sense to use a power wasting tank for simple scavenging, and if devs made the world SO dangerous that suddendly you need PA just to survive 4 shots, than it's silly.
---
I haven't got to max level, but I think in terms of LORE, Power Armor should be used a little sparingly for everyone but the most rich factions (As in BoS or very few players). 
---
I would hate to find myself in endgame being forced to wear PA all the time just for simple survival in simple areas.
---
Don’t have an exact number, but you’re right in the ballpark price-wise. Also, griefers have been very rare for me and I’m about level 77. People are incredibly nice.
---
So long as adventure mode is a profit center they won't abandon it.  This is just simple economic reality.  Even if revenue dips on adventure mode they also have stats on how much new revenue each new PvE DLC generates and that will likely drive further development.
---
im assuming you on xbox and Free trial only ?
---
joined to advanture mode and after that successfully joined NW
---
I'm having trouble with high sensitivity. Doesn't feel the same across both modes. Im not too sure at min, could just be I'm just not very good without vats
---
Not everyone likes every game. We all have games that we didn't get too far into.
---
Just head out and explore. My first couple hundred hours was all solo and loved it. Then I found some randoms whom I’ve since friended and enjoy that too.
---
Dont shoot the giant bats
---
if I can cant itself to enjoy it, its not worth playing.  Altho its diff from previous fallouts and I dont think is the best one, I still find it enjoyable.
---
Man I'm sorry. It's so good when it works right and I only ever had it just stop loading the first time I tried and after that it's been great
---
just go to a new spot, open the Pip-Boy and place the camp.  it does cost Caps for each subsequent move, so make sure you're prepared to spend those.  Your Camp will re-appear whenever you log back in.  But once you place  your camp, it's there until you move  it again.
---
Damn french people. Mocking us a second time.
---
Bill Murray wants to chat with you
---
It was a temp suspension with the 4 8 2000 code tho
---
I’m not fighting people in my briefs, man! There are rules, even in war.
---
Whats your discord?
---
How can I download the free trial on PS4? I can't find it anywhere
---
Since the update?     
---
Good to know,'will have to report as a bug for them, it effectively doesn't work for them then
---
Hahaha. Now I’m definitely going to shoot a giant bat :)
---
Why do people need to brag about doing this kind of stuff over, and over, and over?
---
What's a good deed if nobody knows you did it, right?
---
Nah, .38 is.
---
/r/literalshitposting
---
I usually play alot of adventure...I jus have issues now getting into the game.
---
I find it’s important to know what weapons your teammates use based on their perks. Through voice chat you can swap weapons with each other and make sure everyone has enough ammo and stims.
---
And thanks
---
you should try your lever action with a calibrated receiver instead of hardened.
---
To be fair, there was speculation that the Engineer paint would come out on a daily basis for each model of P.A.
---
Thank you
---
Actually NOT a caddy shack reference but unexpected. 
---
(It was a line by Frank Burns in M*A*S*H)
---
pew pew pew
---
I enjoy following around low level players and just dropping bags of shit in front of them.
---
Back in pawnee ;)
---
&gt;big streamers
---
This is where you are going wrong.  These people only ever follow the trends and memes currently going on.  That's how they stay relevant and keep their popularity.   Of course they hate on it, it's what the cool kids do.
---
I had this thought too and really hope so, nuke zones look a little crappy now by comparison lol.
---
It was sarcasm, and that was my point...
---
112 is a fairly large number, was this in the last day? Or have you been doing this for a while. Kinda curious because that is a lot of resources for one, but it also seems that this would be good thing to do as a group
---
sure, I have shown up at Overseer Camp and made weapons and armour for low levels and answer any questions they have, but I am not that great at interacting as an instructor for the basics- I mean what do you want? I am a scavver, a scrounger not a post doc.
---
So I was thinking that it would be good to have someone who knows the basics, someone good at building camps, someone to introduce them to the scouts (because this should be started early so challenges can be met through regular gameplay), someone to show them good resource sites, someone to each them advance battle skills, etc. but mostly someone to teach them not to kill the Horde bosses!! (just saying ;) )
---
and I think it would be great to have this grow into having support roles- resource gatherers, armourers, cooks and chemists- which brings me to my point, if you need some resources I can contribute- I am currently a little low having grind all week to get the Blackbird skin (got it this morning) but materials are plentiful in this game and I am a scrounger after all...
---
Thats good to know. How frequently do you run into other players out there?
---
You need to have 1GB free on the drive your OS is running.  Just had this issue the other day
---
Fair enough, I just recalled struggling to feed my hunting rifle back in the early days.
---
Ammo scarcity aside, I think the ~8% damage boost and cheaper ammo makes it worth the upgrade.
---
Oh ok so super slow building unless you can save blueprints
---
WV is mine all mine
---
The first few times I played, the endgame was always at that lodge on the Flatwoods end of the bridge (opposite end from the ice cream place), and I thought it was going to get pretty boring pretty fast. Since then, the endgame has been pretty random for me, including at the relay tower overlooking Flatwoods, Sutton rail station (where, this afternoon, I spectated a guy getting caught in a tiny sliver of land between the rail station and the cliff when the fire circle stopped the second-last time, pinning him in an unwinnable location), and most entertaining so far to me, one that ended up about halfway along the bridge, with the two guys I was spectating being on the ground below the bridge and their lone opponent hundreds of feet above them up on the bridge deck. The guy up top tried dropping grenades and molotovs a couple of times, but never connected, and somehow the guys I was spectating managed to land a shot on him when the fire circle was about 10 yards across.
---
Most of it, yes. You can't take any of it with you though. I just leave it for the next person when I log out.
---
Ha! I was actually in the process of crafting him a BOS rifle, but if you're going to shoot at me I'l just find another noob to give it to :)
---
I don't have a mic...
---
I just got the creepy 4 mannequins one, but no chest.  maybe they read your post...
---
This has been over the course of the last week, but has drastically picked up in the last day or so.
---
Sent it to you
---
I think this is what a lot of us wanted when we were discussing PvP, no legendary play.  I'm glad this was implemented.
---
Same here its definitly bugged.
---
No, but that doesn't stop them from trying. Also, the person that prompted this post was level 6, so they would have been fair game if pacifist was off.
---
This week, often, usually not often. 
---
The story is no where near as heavy as 3 or 4. You'll need to listen to holotapes and read notes. Just explore like the other games and dont venture too far into the red or grey or blue areas until you've leveled up some
---
Does this not work with underarmor?
---
Just had it happen. Closed the game, reloaded and got straight on.
---
nope cant challenge either till level 5.
---
welcome to BR
---
Tried that. I had to find them in-game and talk to them. They could invite me, I couldn't invite them.
---
On release it was an amazing game with massive issues, now it’s an amazing game with far less issues and tonnes of brilliant new content. Lots happening in the future too so now would be the perfect time to get stuck in.
---
his rifle was level 1 he didnt say the level of the player just that he was a lowbie.
---
Simply because it encourages others to do that same thing. It's obvious some people play raiders religiously here.
---
I am erickj75! Will add you when I get back from dinner! Also, I have a glitch where voice chat doesn’t work, so I will have to use parties to talk.
---
It says on the news page it's daily.
---
There is one that requires no rank elsewhere in the vault, can't remember where.
---
Its a survival sim, it might not be your cut of tea. I got into it by just playing and exploring. The controls are similar to Fallout 4 so it was easy to pick up the basics. For other questions I recommend Youtube. It is what I used if I got stuck
---
This.
---
"we create an online post apocalypse world for you to play in....and everyone's nice to each other"
---
Love that Todd recognized this during the press conference
---
Love even more that people still give and are ready to help the noobies good on you my guy!
---
Honest question that ill probably get downvotes for anyway, have you really seen people say F76 is becoming a battle royal and hating it because they think it’s moving further away from NV? Because that’s idiotic, and it’s unfortunate if people are starting to use NV just as an anchor for their baseless complaints.
---
I've played it with a few different builds. It really doesn't make a lot of difference other than some perk card restrictions but that's the same in the other modes.
---
Unfortunately gun 🔫 fu don’t work
---
As someone who doesn't normally use his mic - help me out here with a couple of things, because I haven't been able to figure it out on my own.
---
- Is push-to-talk enabled in NW or just VOX? If I have the game set up to use Backspace in normal Adventure mode to let me speak, is it working the same way in NW? (Nobody has replied to me when I have talked so far, so I don't know if it's working.)
---
- This one is kind of a game-wide question not just in NW. What is the difference between a filled-in speaker icon, a hollow speaker icon with an X beside it, and no speaker icon? I'm thinking respectively it's "I have a mic", "I have a mic and it's muted", and "I have no mic". Correct?
---
- Do I need to change the mic settings in the game overall to make it useful in NW (I'm talking the "team/area/all/etc/whatever" settings)?
---
Alright ill try to look for it
---
Do you not know how Battle Royals work?
---
It does indeed, was a little disappointing not to get it to add to the half dozen I have lol.
---
Here lies GregParso - he did not survive long.
---
aw ok thank u
---
Okay so the best thing to do is just place it somewhere hidden and come back to it once I'm kinda ready to actually build something ?
---
 So your issue is they have been trying to balance the game? You dont give any specifics but none of the changes have ruined any play style. Also, all online games have balance updates, so im not sure why this is surprising to you. As for the banning, that was completely deserved. All of the duplicating has caused just as much damage to the game as the glitches did. I have no pity for those people, I hope they never get unbanned.
---
good for looting med-high lvl areas.. bad for shopping...
---
Ive only seen a couple big time vendors when ive been on
---
I got followed around by higher level players as soon as I came out of the vault that kept on trying to kill me and kept me from using the workbenches in the area and also robbed a power armour from right infront of me, deffo gonna buy the game now and just go around wrecking griefers heads when me and my trusty fire axe level up.
---
Yeah I would appreciate that as well for the times when I gun someone down but a team mate finishes them off
---
Bye
---
The one standing up looks tired and ready to fight to the death lol.
---
I don't consider myself to be very good at PVP,  but even I last longer than a lot longer than five seconds most times.    For me it's  a lot of fun... in small doses. 3-5 rounds and I'm like okay, that was fun now back to adventure mode.
---
FTW?
---
Thank you. I didn't want to have to check again because I'm eating dinner but I swore I remember it saying daily.
---
F
---
And how often I’d get punched there 😂
---
I've been caught off by that because I assume '=' is for stimpaks, as per the documentation. If I pick something else up first, though (before a stimpak), I hit '=' and get a dose of Fury or whatever, as opposed to healing goodness. I have to learn to hit 'h', I guess.
---
Most likely they’ll be static items which can’t be interacted with and don’t take into account what junk you actually have in your inventory/stash. Like there’ll be a fully stocked magazine rack, shelf with teddy bears on, etc. I would be pleasantly surprised if you can actually stock them up yourself, but tbh I think the devs will go the easier route.
---
There’s no way to force it to use a drive that my OS is not on? I don’t have many things on C that I can get rid of.
---
Oh my bad.  I can never keep track of what I read in the news vs what I just see ok Reddit
---
It does work for them, so it’s not a bug. The actual speed that you bruh down the blade (the swing speed) is faster just not the attack speed since it’s not a swinging weapon.
---
If I had to guess it’s as intended just not ideal.
---
I too bought the under armor for BR and can't equip it, but I can equip my plague doctor mask.
---
Yea your the type of person that makes it impossible to talk about this game. I’m glad you enjoy it now but I hope you realize the damage people like you have caused
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bw6ump/the\_way\_of\_the\_green\_thumb/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bw6ump/the_way_of_the_green_thumb/) this is a guide I wrote that's especially helpfull to lowbie / new players for dealing with standard medical, cap, and leveling issues you will most likely run into.
---
They should be in your crafting menus like one of the items is the vault boy costume when you go to armor crafting it should show up
---
Took me a while to realize why people were running around nekkid (except for armor). Another reason is it seems that not everyone can see your Atom Shop favorited gear. When I was killed, my cowboy hat and bomber jacket disappeared and I looked like Malcolm Reynolds in the desert.
---
LOL love it. go poke a deathclaw while youre at it :)
---
Yes I have that issue too. It helps if you can join a friend on a US server, and then it seems to put you in US servers after that.. but going into a new game on your own, you can't find a game.
---
Yeah it bugs me too... with another character I had both the west virginia and mothman things displayed, but that’s not possible anymore without scrapping other necessary stuff.
---
It's a lot like Fallout 4. Explore the area around the vault when you get out. Then start following the main Overseer's quest. 
---
Pick up everything. Scrap all junk when you find a workbench. 
---
Store all junk when you find a stash box. 
---
Keep the best weapons and armor that fit your play style and scrap the rest. 
---
You get weapon mods from scrapping weapons. 
---
Be sure to read all the plans, recipes in your inventory. That's how you learn them.  
---
Favorite your weapons and aid items.
---
Yes and you can also find quick walls and turrets in loot boxes, they go into your wheel so it takes no time to put some walls around you.
---
Same happened to me
---
They should just implement separate NW character with all special at 1 + 49 adjustable point, so when you get that juicy 9 points perk, you can raise needed stat and use it. And then, when you get even better perk, lower it back to raise newly needed stat.
---
All cosmetic unlocks are account wide anyway. Why we need to use existing character instead of custom vault 51 dweller with adjustable specials? Looks not very flexible and also give highlvl players (like me) some advantage.
---
&gt; if I can cant itself to enjoy it
---
Do what now
---
There are 99 comments, so I'm gonna be #100. I think the same way too, the game did have a bad release and I do believe they should have delayed it, but right now it's doing really well. I don't see to many bugs, and even a youtuber said that the battle royale runs better than some of the others he has played. I really think this game has a good future, and that it will turn around. It's definitely a fun game if you have friends to play with, but if they could fix the endgame it definitely would be much better
---
I'm enjoying it as well, I have a little over 5 hours in-game so far... However, I don't think I will buy it, at least not now.   
---
I believe the free trial will satisfy my curiosity and desire to try it out. Maybe I will come back to it in the future, especially after human NPCs are added.
---
Has to be an oversight. The point of a br is everyone on equal ground. Having people higher level with their specials through adventure mode negates that be ausw they'll clearly use stronger perk cards.
---
Are you using the same character for adventure mode and nw mode???
---
I haven't played.  To be honest.  Just didn't feel like coming on here an rubbing everybody's face in a decision that only impacts me.
---
Not that I know of but I didn't have to fool around with it much.  
---
I have the game installed on my "D" drive and I still received this message.  I found I had a lot of videos saved to the "C" drive and just moved those.
---
If you have 76, or other games for that matter, on your "C", moving those to a different drive should work.
---
Play style: bait
---
Annd it’s gone
---
If you feel you want to play it as you've played other Fallouts it's mostly soloable aside from a few events .If you're feeling sociable try to team up with other new starters , there's a steady stream of players emerging from Vault 76 so it won't take long to bump into people around the same level as yourself.  
---
I'd say just jump in spoiler free and you'll feel completely familiar it's all pretty much the same as Fallout 4 aside from the thirst and hunger meter.
---
If i could do my first few hours again i'd wish i'd known to break down my junk at crafting tables before putting it in my stash box!
---
I'm still having this problem myself. I've done what you recommended. I don't have mods.
---
Yes
---
I find .308:.38 on a scale of 30:1. Every 30 times I've found a 308 ill find a 38
---
At Walmart you can get it for 17$ so I will most likely get It there
---
And if I could piggyback on this conduit discussion - I have a hard time connecting wires to the conduit pass-thru pieces.  They simply won' connect for me.  I have to place the conduit pass thru piece, store the wall, connect the wire, and then replace the wall before it'll work.
---
Same here. But that character gained NW levels - perhaps misworded?
---
Oh ok, that makes sense. Thank you!
---
Hub for what? 51 is cool but the lobbies in 76 are smaller than that and there’s only so many people who will be in it at oncd
---
&gt;This game was created to be a complete cash-grab for investors
---
as if that isn't a youtube fanboy claim that has been heard idk 1000 times and makes zero sense since all future content will be free- yeah, investors love giving shit away for free
---
could be region locking, i've only gotten teamed with other australians and i've been having trouble getting matches in the earlier hours of the morning, but i expected that
---
When they lock exclusive content in the new mode what do you expect?
---
With as much feedback bethesda is getting about it im betting it will eventually be able to be in the vault for much longer.
---
This game isn't like the previous fallouts.... You don't have quests where you will be able to talk to npcs, choose the dialogue you want and overall make choices. At least for now, unti the Wastelanders Dlc comes. You listen to the stories of the people who lived here. Try to find out what happened. You just listen and do what they were trying to accomplish. If you go with that mindset in, that you won't have quests like the previous games then you might enjoy it.
---
At this point, yeah.  Good news is you can Fast Travel to your CAMP for free.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Thats why relying on mods arnt always a good idea
---
Once the passthrough it placed in the desired wall, you have to like walk inside your building to the INSIDE side,  then trigger the "connection" there... then walk outside and connect it to your destination terminal. 
---
It's annoying .
---
I'd rather see they do the entire map, and circle is random each time.
---
I really don’t get why I’m getting downvoted... what’s wrong with people? I assume they’re ok with getting screwed over. Because that’s what it is IF this isn’t a bug which eventually will be patched in the future. I spend 1000 atoms on the billboards and can’t use them now. Asking for a refund is in my opinion absolutely the right thing.
---
You’re welcome! Good luck to you!
---
I miss being able to pick up low level legendaries for my new characters at Sutton station and Flatwoods. Now they all get scrapped for svrip.
---
How’s your frames in other games?
---
No. The other three are unreleased.
---
Search reddit before posting questions like this
---
At the end of a round of NW it says how much Overseer xp you got and at the bottom it says how much adventure mode xp you got. So I don't think it is misworded.
---
Oh yeah that makes sense thanks
---
You can find armor but not clothes I’m pretty sure
---
On Xbox, griefing is minimal in Adventure mode.  You can set yourself to "pacifist" and mostly avoid pvp, unless you decide to control workshops.
---
There are some specific ways that you can be tricked into PVP situations,  but you can avoid those if you're wary.
---
Pretty much.
---
booooo
---
Oh yeah no this sub, like most of reddit, is the vocal minority. Sometimes they hit the mark with what all the community wants. Mostly they don’t. Doesn’t mean either side is the correct one.
---
I’m the kind that likes squatting in outhouses.
---
Tried it, deosn't work for me sadly
---
Story-wise this makes a ton of sense. Everyone in the vault would have grown up together and would want to help everyone survive. Sure, you will always have a few assholes in a group but I imagine that an untouched vault would grow up to be a fairly helpful society since up until the doors open everyone would have their own jobs and specializations that they would have to teach other people to be able to rebuild.
---
True, just brainstorming. It's definitely happened more than once, but there was no level up in Adventure.
---
I have about the same amount of wins and I’m level 13. My GT is Bren IV
---
Message me if you’re tryna play
---
Really this is above and beyond. But do you find many people that just want to play their way? I'm sure you're kind if they do, but what I guess I'm getting at, is the game that hard that I/we need assistance to understand it?
---
That's strange.... My friend with an 1060 plays fine on high.... Something must have messed up with the inis.....
---
That and having to get multiple numbers. I loled hard on that part. I think my favorite though is that quest you get with the kid securo thing at the water park. Was a very compelling side mission with no extra fluff.
---
Weight plates abound.
---
- The weight room at the motel in Flatwoods (in the corner of the first floor).
---
- The weight room at the Charleston FD.
---
- The exercise room at the main building at Vault-Tec University (south end door is closest to it).
---
- Exercise yard at the penitentiary near Grafton. Just waltz on in.
---
Adding you now
---
.. and the 50 cap limit keeps the consequences from being too severe.   I mean,  the game does warn you that players can attack in the workshop...
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Lucky_Hole_mine
---
If you got plenty of acid for smelting, that's a great supply of lead. Especially if you use super duper and the excavator power armor.
---
Xbox. It's supposed to be 4. It's bugged. I've gotten teams of 3 a few times, teams of 2 a few times, full teams most.
---
Go to the atomic shop and push the interact button on the piece of gear.
---
Yess
---
I cant really help you, im on xbox. Its set to auto in the chat settings. If i switch my mic on my teammates can hear me. Not sure about the mic symbols as sometimes ive seen all 3 of them active while that person is talking, so i think they may be bugged. A lot of the time on xbox the other teammates are in a private party and you wont hear them and they wont hear you. Could likely be the same for pc. 
---
Hopefully someone on pc can tell you more.
---
Keep in mind, it's 10:30am in Australia, a very large portion of the player base is at work right now. Yesterday queuing around 6-11pm took less than a minute.
---
The lack of oceanic playerbase does concern me especially with adventure rewards (skins, etc.) being tied directly to PvP. Hopefully this free week draws in more players for our region! As you mentioned, 250 ping to NA makes for a horrible pvp experience :(
---
Go to social in the main menu the you should see your friends list invite your friends to your team and wait from them to join then your set then play nuclear winter
---
U can favorite atomic shop outfits by going to the shop
---
I have my doubts that I have leveled up as many times as the NW end screen says I have (if true, I've gone up about 15 levels without playing 1 minute of Adventure). However the last time I briefly loaded Adventure, I opened the pip-boy and then my perk cards, and "Level Up (1)" was on the bottom of my screen. Check it out there.
---
God bless
---
Your missing the rest of your feed maybe? Or the search bar?
---
Yes it's broke and well documented.
---
Update: so it worked a couple times for me just now, but for the most part isn’t triggering.
---
No problem
---
Don't use perk loadout manager, downloaded it but never got around to it. I'm just waiting for SFE to update so I can use the text chat mod again, it's amazing how different the game feels without it.
---
We took a level 8 to fight the SBQ last week. It was hilarious just hearing people's reactions to them being there and beating the end game boss with just a standard pipe rifle.
---
Yes it will but kills was about 10 exp each so only a little slower.
---
There is no reason to try to change your mind. It's clearly not supposed to be that way. The point of BRs is that every single person is on a equal playing field. having people able to equip higher and better perk cards is just going to turn off people. Why bother to play this mode down the line when others that have played it longer will outright be better equipped than you?
---
Oh, did I upset you, child? It's ok. Go have an ice cream and calm down.
---
I am not saying that extreme. I get that back in the day we got games and if they had bugs there was no way to patch it, but I also felt that this led to less bugs on release. We have tools to patch our games now, so I am happy we have that especially now that games are a lot more complex. I am just saying that I wish more of the mentality for the love of the craft (which leads to less mistakes) was allowed in the corporate world. Pipe dreams I guess.
---
Yeah I haven’t been seen any posts yet. Glad to know the issue is known.
---
idk. reproduced 2nd time:
---
1. died in NW, exit match
---
2. tried to connect to new match -&gt; infinite load
---
3. exit game (to desktop)
---
4. launch game again
---
5. join advanture mode, leave advanture mode (to main menu)
---
6. join NW -&gt; success
---
Maybe i'm lucky but if something reproducing more then 1 time - it looks like system
---
PC
---
are you on fullscreen?
---
Probably not.  It's been datamined and shows to different types of skins here.  https://imgur.com/a/aUQY2wC
---
Solo playing and playing with friends are both really fun but for different reasons. 
---
Solo you really feel like a survivor out in the thick of it pushing your limits in a fun way, and you will still run into other survivors who 99.99% of the time will team up with you and help you out when you get in over your head. 
---
Playing with friends is great cuz you have your buds to hang out with and you can diversify skills it makes the game less challenging if my opinion but it’s a blast. 
---
It’s good to go into the story spoiler free and to experience the twists yourself 
---
My advice would be to just be mindful of food and food based perks. Keep some non perishable foods with you as much as you can for emergencies.. Managing hunger isn’t hard to do but I’ve had a few incidents where I almost starved to death. And eating spoiled food is a good way to get sick... also sleep on beds raised off of floors.. mattresses on the ground are another good way to contact something
---
Enclave here, these people better not be muties.
---
One thing I would add is be mindful of weight when you're putting stuff into your stash. Perks that reduce item weight such as Bandolier, Ordinance Express and Bear Arms only work for things you're carrying. Once they're put into your stash, their regular weight is applied. So something like a heavy weapon that weighs a little under 2 pounds when you have rank 3 Bear Arms active will instead take up around 20 pounds of storage space.
---
Also, grab all toys! The blocks especially, since they’re everywhere and I believe they have lead.
---
It's not his PC/Console I get the same error, I cant finish downloading the game... I try to download Skyrim legends and have the same error too :( the download stuck at 98% and the size of the download changes every time I think is the fault of bethesda or something but not from our internet or PC/console
---
Thank you!
---
Ok
---
It should just be removed and have perk cards be randomly looted it or something. It'll just make people not bother to play it later. Why bother when you're at a distinct disadvantage.
---
The "swing speed" on the weapons is a little quirky, because these weapons benefit from continuous application  of the blade, both the Ripper and BuzzBlade effectively do no damage on the first hit from the swing.  
---
  
---
Standard weapons benefit tremendously from swing speed buffs, so I'd really have to consider this accidental at best.  
---
Kind of like Vampiric, at launch both of these weapons gained zero benefit from Vampiric after the swing in, once documented and reported it was quickly (By Bethesda's standards) fixed
---
I know exactly what you mean and it is fixed
---
Nice to see there's still some people like this in the community. I remember a lot of people did this sort of thing in the early days of the game.
---
Atomic shop - Appeal/Skins - Select one you unlocked - Press the "NW favorite" button/key

Could be. Though Fallout's full of insane AI's.   
---
Fallout 2 had one named ACE that tells you that the Great War was cause by bored AI's 
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/ACE](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/ACE)
---
so setting myself to 'pacifist' will enable to be not hurt by other players ?
---
Absolutely.  Redo survival with zero legendaries whatsoever.  Only perk cards, mutations, and vanilla mods allowed.  It should be blast to play when you don't have OP duped gear asshats camping at train stations/Whitesprings.  At least you have a chance to fight back.
---
I usually start by turning on my PC. then I stock my desk with a cup of coffee and a couple water bottles, maybe some snacks. snacks are good. pants are optional, boxers are my most comfy . Then I double L click on the fallout 76 Icon and it begins. LOL joking aside I ran into the same issue till about level 24 or so. it was missing something. that fallout 4 vibe that I could never correctly define back then either. then I was sneaky sneaking through a church. a church with pews and gross water, dark, dinghy, and it had a creepy ass vibe to it., I heard the sounds of feral ghouls waking up and they started standing up all around me!! I was fucked, outnumbered, under-leveled, under equipped. Then the song came on "praise the lord and pass the ammunition" LOLOLOLOL hell yes there was the thing I couldn't define and was looking for. 1000 plus hours now. still hooked still cant explain why exactly. 
---
I say this - commit to fully maxing out a build at [nukesdragons.com](https://nukesdragons.com) most builds require level 58 to 60 something. you're gonna F it up so add another ten levels to that for correction time. IF then you haven't found that thing you're looking for you probably wont in this game.
---
Great job! You make us proud! My hubby and I (level 160 and 182 respectively) hung out at Flatwoods last night following the newbies, handing out ammo, stimpacks and weapons. The lil guys and gals weren’t bashful at all approaching us as we handed stuff out. I felt like Santa Claus. I was worried we’d scare them off, but maybe it was the big vault girl head I was wearing made me look approachable. Most memorable sight, a level 3 player in tighty whities and party hat running around with big grin. You be you, dude! Here, have a stimpack or 10 and weapon. Clearly you don’t need armor with that attitude. Made me laugh out loud.
---
At far as I know they don’t. I could be wrong though.
---
I had that happen earlier today. Rank 11 guy goes down, I'm trying to kill the guys who downed him. I'm jumping around with a pump action, downed 2 of them, and they finally got me. That fucker had the audacity to say my aim sucked... When he died way before me. Some people....
---
I'm enjoying it, and I'm not usually a BR fan. There are a few neat ideas employed - I've talked about the fire being a great game dynamic/mechanic before. Something else I only realized today during a play was that the "Extra Crispy Scorchbeast" that seems to appear near the end of the round is more-or-less an equalizer if the teams are far apart - the team being harassed by the SB is being "outed" as to their location.
---
I can can, I twist, I cha cha EVERY BODY \*turmpets kick in\*
---
Lol gitgud?
---
All I want is for it not to take so damn long to go from one match to another, I’ve timed it and it takes over 5 minutes. It’s ridiculous, I’ve never seen any other BR game with wait times like this. It’s usually 1-2 minutes max as you die thick and fast. Do something about the wait times, I get you can explore the vault but, “eh”
---
Camden park. 
---
Grab all the toys and wooden blocks in the room with the robobrain, over by the entrance there’s some letter blocks on a bin, on a bench near the dross toss there’s more blocks then hit the area under the rollercoaster and grab all the tin can traps cause they have both lead and steel. You should have loads from that one quick run.
---
Where is that?
---
lol "brrrrrrrrrrrreeeehaaaah!"
---
Yeah yeah I know lol. Just hard to play sometimes when you can’t have any coms since no fill teammates have a mic.
---
Imagine sniping from MT Blair
---
Haven't played much of nw but I have a guy or two on xb that we can team up with. I just did the Xbox gamertag/name change thing so my name is rednekbmw1934 or rednekbmw#1934. Not sure how the new system works yet
---
thing is as well how STRONG the perk cards can be, huge movement speed increases, armor defense increases, massive buffs to weapons if you get the right combination.
---
We're not talking a few %, gains are into the 40% increased damage, improved hit fire, etc.
---
Lol I sucked too but i played nw all day yesterday and i can see myself getting better (I'm still garbage lol)
---
That is shorter than I thought, so very impressive
---
well if you need help or resources, send me an invite
---
will be on in about an hour
---
Lore went out the window and fair while back unfortunately, that said, since I stopped worrying about it the game became more enjoyable lol.
---
Bethesda is triggered by duffel bags. They can’t.
---
On the bar
---
Considering the plethora of identical threads with one or two responses all celebrating BR in almost exactly the same way ...
---
It seems odd that so many have absolutely ZERO tolerance for an alternate perspective, but all need to come to this thread and pile on negativity toward a player simply for having a different opinion.
---
Disagree with the opinion.  Okay.  Attack a player?  Oh yeah, right, PvP, BR lovers ... sorry, I forgot.
---
I do the same thing! I went into flatwoods and made a tone of modded upgraded level 5 aluminum bats and handed em out. I made 50+ was dropping em trading and putting them in the first aid box in front of the flat wood church. It feels good to help new players and show them how nice the player base is!
---
Those guys are lying to themselves. In reality they’re probably major assholes IRL but come online to pretend to be nice because people don’t like being murdered.
---
I agree with this. Not saying that I don't want it fixed, just saying that I wish companies allowed more baking time before release. I feel that we get the "NMS's" of the world because of deadlines and all that. Humans make games. Humans get tired and burned out when they work tons of late nights in a row to meet a deadline. This is what leads to bugs. We will always have some bugs and things that need fixing. I just wish games could be mostly stable on release. I didn't hate on fo76 at release. In fact, I didn't think the game was as bad as a lot of reviewers said, but as someone who plays somewhat casually, I didn't hit a lot of bugs that a lot of people here were angry about, like not being able to complete some main quests. I was so far behind that by the time i hit that quest, it was fixed. I get that it's a business and they need to make money and sometimes just releasing something to make money to make it better becomes the strategy. This affects the customer base though. It's risky. Now there are people who might enjoy this game and won't play it because of the bad reviews. Like that's it. They'll never look on reddit and they'll never look back. Not our problem right? But a problem nonetheless.
---
(xbox) Unless im blind, how do you add friends to your party? I cannot find it anywhere and it wont let me from the xbox menu.
---
OH. MY. GOD. MY FAVORITE POWERARMOR
---
My biggest issue with it is that unless i make a new character and lvl them specifically for NW,i will have to respec points on my Adventure mode character,which will be way too time consuming since i can only respec once per lvl after 50.Then if i want to go back and play Adventure mode,i will need to do the same because my build will be all messed up.
---
Battle royal Fd the economy lol. oh well I'm already rich enough.
---
I soured on the game really early—I don’t want to beat a dead horse, but I really didn’t like the lack of NPCs and it seemed like every player I encountered just shot at me and never wanted to interact in any interesting way. If I had stumbled across someone like OP I might have felt differently about the game. 
---
Are players more cooperative or more into roleplaying stuff at this stage? Forgive me for not knowing, I haven’t turned the game on since shortly after launch and I rarely see posts from this sub
---
Lmao @ one option... I see what you did there. Let him figure it out
---
Free
---
There is. Its called death.
---
Agreed I don’t know the exact turning point for me (around where player shops became a thing) but I’ve been enjoying it from then on
---
I recently saw a review of 6 months later I didn't watch it but it's good people will take a second look.
---
Free right now
---
I deserve the downvotes. My bad OP.
---
Bethesda is the lore authority. They in the IP, so they can alter and add to the lore as they see fit.
---
If you take a workshop I will kill you. If you are in the world fighting enemies, I will hit you and then jump in front of your bullets, and then kill you.
---
Same lmao
---
I like earnable cosmetics. Like my old COD days
---
its a well executed BR but BR is just not my thing either. its ok adventure mode awaits me o7
---
hey stop please
---
Except for a couple of circumstances:
---
1. Someone on your team engages another player in PVP. This makes you automatically hostile to them and vice versa. 
---
2. You control a workshop.   Another player can contest it,  making them auto-hostile.
---
There are perk cards that increase some of your weapon damage by 40%, how is that not a big difference as you can also chain that with other perk cards to improve those weapons further
---
But that's the problem - I can't trigger the connection on the inside.   And I was wanting to connect the inside portion with something on the inside of my house!
---
I’m all for this. I put a lot of hits on targets and do a lot of flanking/flushing people out of cover but don’t get many knocks/kills.
---
R u mad loser ?
---
Me too. I'm on PS4, it makes our queuing time into another game even longer
---
It’s not about being pro. It’s about making you quit the game. We the griefers win.
---
They've fixed this game when it was beyond repair. Think about that.
---
You won't want to run into higher level players anyway cause u will fight higher level enemies. When doing missions or exploring look on ur map and see if anyone is around.
---
Ok great. What servers do you play on?
---
You're just taking up the mission of the Responders, making sure people know how to survive in Appalachia.
---
Again, you misinterpreted my original comment.
---
You can still play Fallout 2, boomer
---
Honestly favorite faction of the series, followed at a close second by the Followers and Lyon's Pride.
---
Bug Fixes does not equal to new content being made.  Maybe you missed the entire discussion.
---
sounds good, im a solo player so number one is crossed off, number two is an optional action.
---
so im safe :)
---
Does anyone know if you get rewards for getting first place
---
Same issue. Adventure loads fine.
---
Tried force quit, restart, entering adventure mode, then leaving via quit to main menu. Launched nuclear winter mode.
---
Match found, connecting, then loading screen with spinning vault door forever.
---
Was working earlier, am Europe based so could be related to latency with fellow gamers, but then why would it have found a server.
---
Is frustrating, given the mode is enjoyable.
---
Why is your main drive so full? That is not good. You should really resolve that fir the sake of your whole computer.
---
 "Wow, you really aren't from around here, are you? I just saw you take out 3 bandits in clown suits with a golf club. We could use somebody like you. "
---
LOL
---
As a newbie who has become really frustrated with the game, THANK YOU. I have died and died and died, found one weapon then run out of ammo, I’m really not very good which sucks because I rocked the hell out of Fo4, and loved it. 
---
Also, I had one person try to show me around I think but no voice chat and I have NO idea how to make the little charades thing work properly! 
---
You are a star! Have some Platinum! Your work is so appreciated!
---
I like that one as well as the one in... I think Garrahan? The one where you have to become an executive to get the drill to go.
---
....friends? I don't get it.
---
Silent Pudding is wrong.
---
/(See what I did there?)
---
The griefing in adventire mode is almost non-existent. The only real way to open yourself up to PvP or taking damage from other players is by claiming a public workshop, and the game worns you when you are about to do it.  Even then, if someone comes to contest your workshop and you don't return to defend it, they just take it over after a minute and you're still invulnerable.
---
Also, I just checked prices. It's  $30 to DL via Live, or you can find physical copies at places like Walmart and Target for $20-30.
---
Been happening with me as well. For an extra fun experience try shooting heavy wepons in power armor while aiming down site in third person. Enjoy your invisible treadmill!
---
You're the motherfucking man.
---
Ah, a troll.
---
[removed]
---
Thanks though!  Gonna give it a try.  You all aren’t helping my addiction...
---
I'm playing on PS4, so no mods, no. It first occurred 3-4 months back and would happen randomly now and then. In my experience, only ever in the Mire, but I can't say if it occurs to other players in other places. Haven't seen it for a good while though, up until the update. Not sure if that was sheer luck or if anything changed though.
---
Oh, so neither of the two inside tubes will catch on another piece of conduit? That is weird.
---
I wish I could, but it’s almost entirely a bunch of programs I actually use and save files that insist on being there. The drive itself only has 120GB max, where as my other drives have 3TB between the two of them.
---
I do run g-sync fullscreen, not windowed. DOF enabled here though.
---
This is hate culture aka the best way to get views
---
I mean you have a completely different perk card system I don't see why its such a stretch to have a different SPECIAL point system.
---
As it stands its way to difficult to respec, too much RNG to get specific cards you might need to be competitive, or should be some way to trade cards in for ones you want, and as well the disadvantage level 1 players have against level 50 ones (Adventure mode levels)
---
Try this:

Survived 10 minutes with a hatchet a few throwing knives plus my crossbow

They are paint for certain items and a few buildable armor suit pieces.
---
Are you familiar with how coding for games, particularly on this scale, works? There’s a multitude of things that could be hampering that process — who knows if changing that single value led to same strange cascading of effects that broke other aspects of the game? Maybe they’re working through a version where they have to fix all of those issues, or maybe they’ve just decided a handful of plants in a single area of the game map isn’t worth compromising the relative stability they’ve finally been able to achieve.
---
To your point on resources, don’t forget that this is also a business with a product to sell. The longer they can bring in a profit from new purchasers, the longer they have to iron out the kinks. Did the creation of Nuclear Winter pull people from other departments? Almost certainly, but if the new game mode can get X number of people to purchase the game for Y amount of money, the longer they can support it.
---
 Regardless of the negative sentiment around the game, they’ve made a significant amount of progress in squashing the truly game-breaking bugs. Your issue with the plants may be annoying and odd, but it’s not even close to game-breaking and is probably being addressed as such.
---
I only had that bug and an issue at basic training, but they were big. I skipped them for over a month. I did them both after level 40 I think because I was tired of spending 20 minutes or more just to have to start from where it would reset after logging back in.
---
As soon as you wear armor, it's unequipped
---
I'm mostly on adventure but my one buddy has been bugging for nw. I was on all day. Giving the poor gal a break. Anyone else with an original xb1 seem to get hot with fo76? I may have to break the wallet open and get a new one I think.
---
have you turned it off and turned it back on, have you unplugged it and plugged it back in, have you restarted your computer lately, have you updated your audio drivers recently, have you tried a different set of headphones to see if the headphone itself may be broken ? 
---
sounds like audio card and or driver issue but most likely a restart of your pc will fix it. 
---
It Help desk thanks you for your call please submit a positive review in the ticket. have a nice day.

High charisma is good if you’ll be playing together because it affects the perks you can share with each other. Charisma 3=1 lvl perk, charisma 6=2 lvl perk, charisma 9=3 lvl perk

hmm follow on questions. is it a wired headset or wireless - is the dongle fully seated if wireless.
---
Agreed.
---
I think it's the driver. Haven't updated it in like 5 years lol. How would I update it?
---
I quit for a long time and am just now starting back so I’m very low level. I’m not sure what the servers are in fallout but I’m in Tennessee so Itd be great to play if you think we’re on the same server
---
Well it is the wasteland, not many people left after the big one. Heard everyone moved to a place in the desert called New Vegas.  To far for an ol timer like myself.
---
It's already on sale right now for 50% off. Amazon has it for $17 as well.
---
Completely wired.
---
Ah, I misunderstood. I didn't quit the game. NW works for me if restart. So for me it looks like this: 
---
3. exit game via Task Manager etc. (forcing quit cuz i can't get out of loading)
---
5. join NW -&gt; success
---
I tried joining adventure mode between (1) and (2) and it didn't work. But if i restart the game, NW works normally for me fo one game. So each match I have to restart the game, that the problem for me.

Selecting something from your favorite bar QUICKLY is almost impossible on console, id love if they reworked it.

You can craft level 1 BOS recon rifles. If you;ve done the BOS questline, go to Defiance and look for the terminal on the wall just to the right of the door leading inside. One of the entries on the terminal will give you the plans. 
---
The best part is that it's a fully modded out hunting rifle that has the same crafting cost as a standard level 5 hunting rifle with no upgrades, so it's pretty cheap to make and give away.
---
I upgrade them to 50cal receivers and drop a couple hundred rounds along with the gun.
---
I see a try free demo, is it the trial?
---
They own it now but didn’t create the franchise, I would have preferred it remained faithful to lore but what they’ve done is quite exceptional.
---
I played several matches tonight... got a couple kills and enjoyed it very much. Just dont care for the long load times....oh well
---
The trade window is stupidly unintuitive. I've resorted back to dropping shit on the ground, using the gun emote, turning my light on and off, and eventually sending them an XBL message if they still don't get it.
---
You’re like a living, breathing tutorial
---
Bethesda wants all the files for a game in the same directory.  Bethesda does not provide a function for changing game directory.  Bethesda wants you to uninstall the game and reinstall on another drive.  I went through this with Bethesda last night on tech support.  The tech support specialist told me that copying from one drive to another produces errors.  When I told her that is untrue, I mentioned that even if it where, the launcher has a check files feature.  Bethesda feels that 70+ gigs is not a problem for anyone to have to re-download for any reason.
---
Solution: The fix is to copy the entire Fallout directory to another drive, uninstall the game in Bethesda Launcher, then hit Install in Bethesda Launcher.  It will ask where to put the files.  Direct it to where you copied the files, upon which the launcher will spend about 5 or so minutes checking stuff and then the game is good to go.
---
This! Instead of loading screen after loading screen, let us explore and hang out in 51 until a match is filled up!
---
Oooh don't think I've done that one. Any idea on name or more info? I tried googling it but couldn't find any quests besides Miner Miracles which doesn't sound like what you're talking about.
---
It's a video game, dude. There *is* no point. Except having fun, which you clearly did because you said it was "pretty cool overall" so mission accomplished?
---
Is now, wasn't for a while, and some people haven't gotten used to the shift yet so they still think it's full of salty rage 'round here.
---
Go into the glass carven with excavator armor and mine the ultracite ore
---
TSE was nerfed, it hurt my tse gauss but it was needed, slap damage has been removed from players on pacifist mode, camps are indestructable, basically douchebag griefers are running out of less and less ways to seal club noobs.
---
Didn't they say something about breaking down ammo too or am I mistaken? Been trying to find the article but I'm having trouble locating it.
---
No need to be an ass, tanks.
---
I think it takes up like, 50 or 60 something gb. I could be wrong though
---
What, do you just go naked under your armor then? Is that for all atom outfits?
---
Awesome, thanks for the reply!
---
Oh yeah I love it, just mentioning why no one could find the stuff in game.
---
It’s the theme park south of the nuka cola plant
---
That would be amazing.
---
&gt; For me it's a lot of fun... in small doses. Sometimes I'm lucky and find decent armor and weapons, other times, not really. I have fun playing 3-5 rounds and I'm like okay, that was fun now back to adventure mode.
---
Pretty much how I feel playing any BR.  Around the 45minute mark, even when I'm doing real well, I'm done.
---
Wander. Fight. Scavenge. Die. Repeat.
---
Welcome to the Wasteland.
---
Add my gamertag. When we are both on, we can join either of our servers. I think the two guys I play with mostly are from Michigan. They play with a guy from PA like me.
---
For me, I love player vending, both grinding and selling and visiting player bases to shop their machines and looking at their CAMPs.
---
If you only use it for 2 things you will love it for the mole rats and radroaches.
---
With the large Ferris weel?
---
So aftee restarting some hours later it went down to 7gb so most likely both are telling how much info needs to be dled
---
I will always give this tip because it saved the game for me: server hop if you run into overleveled zones! I was going solo and struggled to make it to level 20 since every time I went anywhere (even supposedly low level zones) everything was 60+ due to higher players being in the same area. If you server hop, you can spawn enemies closer to your level and finally complete quests without running out of materials every freaking time...
---
on PC at least it would be nice to have an action bar at the bottom of the screen so you can see what you've got at a glance without obstructing the center of the screen with the wheel. The wheel is fine when you've got a few minutes to breath and sort things out, but mid-fight it's such a pita. Though that's true of adventure mode, too.
---
I hope someone did more in depth research but a quick run against one, my hunter prime explosive and my Zealots prime explosive handmade both did identical damage. So either the shown damage is bugged, or both hunter and Zealots effects scorchbeast
---
Ok. I’ll add you tomorrow when I get on
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6lu7jIlXd5clSzKJ23Inza/atomic-shop-patch-10-items-and-sales
---
Well I feel silly.  It's every other day.
---
Great response! Thank you for the tips!
---
Are you looking for a specific weapon? If so what? Also lvl and platform would really help with the advice buddy.
---
Yup. It unlocks the entire game until 6/17. If you decide to buy it, all of your data will stay with you so you don't lose any progess.
---
Pro-tip: the gunplay is quite a bit snappier than F04, so I'd recommend going into adventure mode for a bit and dialing in the x/y sensitivity before jumping into the battle royale (if that's your thing).
---
People like you are what makes this game so amazing. 
---
I can’t wait do that. I used to play on my Xbox but it stopped turning on in feb (hopefully getting it fixed in the coming months). So when it was free to play, I hopped on my computer and downloaded it. Wonder if I’ll go beyond level 45 with this character.
---
It's called Motherlode. I poked around and it's actually Hornwright, the competition!
---
nope ran out of content to do, think last thing i was doing was getting excavator armour or something like that, was yellow custom power armour from south area, was missing one or two pieces, quit around then
---
Thanks! I’ll definitely check it out after I get my feet wet.
---
Sounds good to me. I'll be on later tonight likely around 10 or 11pm eastern
---
Hmmm yeah your right it did succeed at giving me some fun for a bit. I do feel I would have had more fun and gained better satisfaction in adventure mode for the time though.I only had 2 hours before coming to work so I have a little remorse for spending it in BR mode. of course I wouldn't have known that if I hadn't tried it so I guess nothing gained nothing lost really.
---
Both Hunters and Zealots affect the SBQ. That was datamined some time ago.
---
Ok cool
---
Adventure is a joke with all the duped OP gear running around.  The player base is so corrupted they don't even think buying duped OP gear is wrong.  BSG did jack sh!t to stop legendary duping and it's pretty much ruined Adventure's balance. It absolutely made Survival a bad joke with duper gear asshats one-shotting each other at the train station.   Play honestly and you'll grind 6 months for 1 good god-tier OP weapon and maybe assemble a partial OP armor set.  Cheat and you got god-tier OP gear without any negative consequences or doing any hard work.  I hope BSG learned from NW and realized that the fun was sucked out of the other modes by the duping they did little-to-nothing about.
---
Ive been there once today aaaaaaand im not going back xD
---
Your comment that I replied to was about fixing the game. Not once was new content mentioned.
---
2 shots are great, if they both hit the target.  Very poor for snipping.  I have a 2 shot explosive Handmade that is EPIC!!!  Scorch Beast Queen needs my Furious Explosive Prime Handmade.  I'm whooping her ass every time!
---
I wanna go on that tour.
---
I agree with that mindset go play and not worry about perfection just now. glhf.
---
That might be an overseer unlock!
---
No it’s got a big rollercoaster called the widow maker, lower west side of the map. Look for the big red nuka cola bottle on the map then look a bit below that past the river and you should see a theme park. 
---
There’s some scorched in there but they’re not too bad plus there’s a nice vendor not in there named chad so you can sell all the scorched’s guns to him once you’re done splatting them!
---
Lol I eventually started using my mic to ask "thumbs up or thumbs down" questions. Trade window needs real work
---
Could always make it a cross-server area. So you load into it and it's technically off of your main server. They'd probably have to put something compelling there to draw people to it, but that's doable.
---
Oh wow. See that’s the kind of stuff I would never know about without this sub. Thanks for the heads-up!
---
Copy files to a new directory.  Uninstall Fallout 76 in Bethesda Launcher.  Install Fallout 76 in Bethesda Launcher and show it the new directory you have the files in.
---
Ok thanks!
---
I like helping people too. Before vending (and still sometimes) I would drop my extra plans and recipes and stuff in front of new people.
---
Same problem. Had a CtD too. But I've only managed to actually get in a game once. Normally just get stuck in endless load screens.
---
I'm sorry you're a dick.
---
That is the Fallout files, not the entire launcher.
---
Give it a week.  The freebie players will disappear and things will not be as crowded.
---
this
---
Just fine. Anthem i was getting 65ish on max settings.
---
I haven't heard of anything, but I would love either breaking it down, or the ability to bulk it to sell at a more reasonable price.
---
Yep, that sounds a lot like FO4.
---
Let's be honest. Bethesda Austin's taken a bigger axe to the lore with 76 then Bethesda Studio EVER did.
---
Are you just too lazy to google this?
---
Yea when it says "you have leveled up, return to adventure mode" it means that your overseer rank has leveled up and when you return to the lobby of nuclear winter in vault 51 you see the progress. It's very misleading, since adventure mode is actually an option for a game mode.
---
pew?
---
Game having resolution wrong on first launch is pretty much on every title, sounds like you're really digging to find reasons to dislike the game. There is a option for motion blur and depth of field. The optimization is really bad though.
---
Kill a few bats?
---
Every can of paint is 5 units of lead and Watoga HS has 7-8 cans in their sets and crafts classroom.
---
The entrance to Blackwater mine has 3-4 cans on the shelves to the left and one more in the entrance to then Uranium Fever area.
---
The pickup bed in the parking lot next to the workshop at White Spring has 3-4 cans.
---
And don’t overlook pencils and toys/blocks as the other poster noted.
---
&gt;"That didn't go according to plan."  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Narrator: *There was no plan.*
---
I picked this game up after putting it down shortly after launch. The first player I encountered (within a few minutes of leaving the vault) game me tons of goodies. It was really refreshing. Good on you!
---
I don’t understand why everyone is punching each other. I just find a swank couch and have a seat. 
---
Lobby-punchers of r/fo76 why do you do that which you do?
---
Ah, I see. Their light radiates away from the source on the first pic. Thanks for the info!
---
I've tried it with my underarmor and it doesnt work as of now...maybe eventually because seriously bought one just to wear and no....
---
What are you going to do in adventure after you do everything? It’s gets boring after
---
Oh I have that quest but haven't started it yet! Yay, now I know what I'm doing today!
---
Good luck! It's a really fun game, especially if you enjoyed the exploring aspect of previous Fallouts.
---
Yes. Right now it's vault suit or naked.
---
A way around that could be to let us adjust our perks outside of the mode. Like put a step before you appear in Vault 51 where you can move cards around. Then when you're ready you're in the vault and just have to wait until it fills up. Then also make Vault 51 available for single-player exploration in Adventure mode so people have time to explore the terminals, rooms, etc.   
---
My biggest frustration with NW, and BR in general, is all of the waiting around. I just want to jump into the action ASAP, because who knows how quickly I'll die? As it stands I really only have the patience for 1 or 2 rounds at a time.
---
I completely agree with your point, I would have much rather enjoyed a progression system that was built around your proficiency with weapons &amp; play style, instead of just becoming godlike through RNG drops.
---
What level are you out of interest?
---
Damn i just scriped a quad one
---
31
---
Black would stand out in green/brown sunny Appalachia.
---
Yeah it can’t hurt to try it again.. honestly the way the updates are going this is quickly turning from an okay rather fun spin off into one of the most intricate and diverse fallout titles...
---
I’m not really enjoying it all and I’m purely playing for the Adventure Mode items. It just doesn’t feel right to me at all. More power to those enjoying it but on Xbox, for me at least, it’s extremely sloppy performance wise and it doesn’t help the environment ends up being bland and samey and everyone camouflages with the scenery, it’s just a huge chore for me.
---
Also, sure they improved the combat but I’ll be damned if the combat system in this game still doesn’t support a mode like this, far too many times hit detection has been massively off for me and cost me a kill or even got me killed.
---
The inventory system is trash too.
---
I love the base game but I’ll be damned if this mode doesn’t massively highlight every little flaw Fallout has had and still has since the third game
---
I don't sell much junk--I use it all!  I do sell screws, gears, and ballistic fiber, since I do tend to run a glut.  But I don't imagine that will last as I adjust my habits.
---
Buy?  Why would anybody buy junk in the game, except in the most desperate of circumstances?  Why buy junk, which is a nearly infinite resource, with caps, which are far more finite (only so many vendor caps and events per day).
---
I can get ~2k steel on a Blackwater mine run.  Lead at Lucky Hole is even faster, but that's ore, so it takes acid.  As does gun powder!
---
Ain't nobody keeps that level of mats just to sell.  And, as I said, even if they did, it would be absurd to spend hard fought caps on it.
---
Well at least we are getting npcs!
---
I'm just concerned that the devs will stray from what made it so great historically.
---
I would love to see an open world experience with 4 player coop for example.
---
Yeah they are actually kind of hilarious sometimes and aren't all that bad.
---
It's a bit unintuitive, but if you check your character challenges, it will tell you the reward(s) for your next NW level up. You can also sort of distinguish based on the pictures - weapon and PA skins clearly show what they are, the red nuke squares are perk cards, the cartoony looking boxes are player icons (because all player icons look very cartoony), and the realistic ones are camp decorations. The photo frames will tell you in the upper left of the screen that you unlocked a photo frame
---
Shit, that's a great idea. I don't normally turn on the mic unless I'm playing in a team, but I might have to for this kind of stuff.
---
FYI To anyone wondering, in a different terminal entry you find out that ZAX sent that "original" message by *posing* as Dr. Stanislaus Braun.
---
Fallout still has great replay value. I've been obsessively looking for one undiscovered thing in that game.. No one had found it according to bethesda
---
We had very detailed testing last week, it's +5% gun damage per hit up to a stack of +50% (or 45%? can't remember)
---
Or everyone who's selling stuff is in the BR.
---
rip. I guess I misread it
---
I get this reference
---
Have you updated your drivers recently? I’m just spit balling here.  Do you have monitoring software? If so, does it show heavy CPU, RAM, or GPU loads?
---
I remember in one of my first matches I picked up a board and tried killing the person next to me. Turns out they had a gatling gun already and two-shot me
---
I do it slowly anyways because a few times my game has crashed while trying to process back-to-back sells too quickly.
---
Character
---
Did I want it? No.
---
Do I suck at it and get a little salty when I die? Yes.
---
Do I like it? Yes.
---
My ONLY complaint is I seem to have an issue where when I die and exit, I sometimes have to close and relaunch the game, otherwise it tries to 'find' another NW server but never does.
---
AGREED 100%
---
Break immersion how?
---
There are tons of trees, a surprising amount of the map is covered in shadow. Also most interiors are pretty dark.
---
You mean you don’t like it when you shoot someone and they instantly transform into an 8 story building? 🤣
---
&gt;Lying Lowe
---
!!!!  I haven't done the Lying Lowe questline yet. Let me get this straight: an object is in F76 that looks like the Robot Workbench, but you can't access it the same say you did in Fallout's Automatron DLC. ie, we can't make Automatrons... yet. Hope springs eternal!

I know I'm supposed to restart the game or logout of Bethesda and log back in again or something but when I was loading the game I saw the ads for bargain microtransactions and I'm just, tired or something.
---
perhaps fallout 76 is one of those games that splits from the timeline, Ex: hellfire power armor development began eariler or stuff like that
---
It's no longer working.
---
Someone helped me when I was starting out. I mean im still starting out but yeah... That hunting rifle and food / water was really helpful. Thanks for being one of the good guys
---
I love you 😆
---
You are a good man.
---
I think the more important part is that it weighs 1.1 but provides no stat or resistance buffs. It's purely cosmetic. I use my silver shroud outfit instead, the full set weighs .2 and is much better looking. The black blends in surprisingly well with the rest of the map. Not as well as the desert camo power armor though
---
I get where you're coming from, but I wouldn't necessarily agree. Maybe because I just don't care to that extent. Who on my team actually got credit for downed, killed and/or both isn't a big deal to me. I would however like to see an addition of total players downed/killed by your team, next to your own at the end of the match. That'd be pretty nice to know.
---
That being said, if there ended up being actual statistics tracking at some point, I'm 100% in the same boat as you. Seeing as it's just casual fun (for now at least), I don't feel an urgent need for the change, although it would be welcome. Just my two cents.
---
For me anyways, having to shoot a butt naked burned leftover pizza roll 5 times to kills it makes less sense than doing the same for a heavily armored raider wearing as much protection as I am
---
Semi-related anecdote: I wanted to try out Fortnite one day, but couldn't because I had like 3000 friend requests in the Epic launcher. I had registered my account way back when it was only used for Unreal Engine and chose the name "marco". A lot of people add me out of the blue, for whatever reason.
---
So yeah, because Fortnite tried to load all these friends, it just didn't run. I can definitely see how similar issues would appear with 76. The social system was probably coded and tested with the assumption that you'd have at most 50-100 friends. So who knows what they're doing with the friend list? They could be updating every single entry every 10 seconds, for example, which might cause the random stutters. Or the friendlist UI isn't optimized for such a huge list. It may depend on your bandwidth, latency, PC hardware, online vs offline friends, etc. to determine if you actually experience problems.
---
Thanks for the confirmation guys.  I was super excited when I first got the Furious MG-42.. but couldn't figure out why it felt so weak compared to any other legendary MG I had....
---
Cut down the lobby and starting area time in half, and it would be great!
---
“I’ve marked this settlement on your map”
---
F**k you Preston, I must have rescued the same kidnap victim 5 times and goddamn I got tired of building extra beds in every settlement.
---
Following
---
Does power armour have any advantages or just cosmetics
---
That's what it's been like since launch though, minus big streamers playing it. Every possible thing about the game could have some way of being twisted into something to bitch about
---
My advice is to read some builds and start building your perk cards accordingly. There are some really great builds in Reddit. I personally like Bloodied. But there are several great ones out there. 
---
I would also consider using melee weapons to start, since ammo will be hard to come by at first. Maybe just have a backup ranged weapon just in case. 
---
Once you have played a while, you will find a style of combat that you prefer. You should focus on one type of build, but don't spread yourself thin by picking multiple types of builds to run at the same time, because if you do that, you won't be good at any one thing, just average at everything. For example, don't throw your perk points into both ranged and melee, especially at first.
---
Lastly, it can be hard to meet people in the game. My suggestion is to join lots of public events, and you will eventually meet some good people.
---
But as previously stated, spend some time exploring. That is a big part of the fun. I hope this helps.
---
There is also and overseer chair unlocked at level 10 for your camp. Another stash box skin unlocked at 16 I don't know past that as 17 18 and 19 appear to display icons
---
Its easy views. I hate it
---
Nerfing tse shotguns
---
Atm no, but Vault 51 is on the adventure mode map, it's just closed off, hopefully it'll get opened so we can take our time exploring it outside of waiting for a game.
---
If you mean the blood raider one, yeah that was a limited time thing a few weeks back
---
An player vending
---
Yeah, I did the same... first thing I ever spent Atoms on.
---
Tell me something I don't know
---
As detailed [here](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6lu7jIlXd5clSzKJ23Inza/atomic-shop-patch-10-items-and-sales), they seem to be changing them out every 2 days instead of every 1 day.  The availability of them is also kind of strange.  The T-51 is available for 8 days, whereas the others are only available for their respective 2 day window.
---
Yea I don't like leaving it on unless I need to, makes the game sort of tiring to always have to talk or be mindful of noises. But yea the thumbs emotes have been very helpful! Lol
---
This right here is exactly correct
---
The subject of the entire thread is about if the "new content" was made recently or not.
---
My stance is they are only doing bug fixes.
---
I saw a bone raider one too. I'm sad I missed both.
---
The person who gets the kill gets a lot more XP.
---
It's annoying to do the work only for someone else to yank it away by shooting the downed person.
---
You wear the stalker outfit
---
Yeah it is good but not a 80% good but thanks for testing
---

---
I killed him with a couple other people at level 24 with the black diamond as my only weapon, and yes I did help. I used like 82 stimpacks.
---
So...... I have this game, preordered it.
---
Have yet to play it...
---
I usually play on the fruit machines lol.
---
You are right. I forgot about some interiors being pitch black.
---
Same issue here, got endless load screens with NW.
---
Guess you can do what ya want, but there's a lot of high lvl players who aren't dicks in any way. I'm lvl 242 and last night gave out a few set's of studded leather with deep pocketed to some new players. There is some people who are dicks but there's some like me and a few other's who aren't playing the game to troll low levels or people higher than myself (Last high lvl person I saw was like 800+.)
---
Where do I ask
---
Getting the kill gives XP, so it's kinda not fun to have a kill stolen when you are trying to level up.
---
when I got Fallout 76 on launch I knew the game was going to be bad, like my expectations were low but to this day I still  enjoy the game and I have been enjoying watchingthe game change and grow. what annoys me are the youtubers who just make vids to trash the game .. theres nothing wrong with criticism infact I encourage it because you can see two sides of an agruement but goddamn enough with the fallout canvas bags ..
---
Lets hope. They make a area full of lore, and then only give us life 5 minutes to explore. What's up with that?
---
I'm starting to think the display might be bugged, I watched captain noob get very inconsistent numbers with the same weapons and I myself have gotten things that don't seem to add up. More specifically, damage numbers for furious do not reflect what previous testing showed or what the health bars show.
---
My advice is to pick one location where it appears and server hop. Maybe I was extremely lucky, but I found it on the fifth or so time. The teapot, I believe...
---
Those are some quality ideas!
---
Yeah I started about a week after launch and im only level 26 so I’m falling behind.
---
It will take me a loooong time to do "everything in adventure" and maybe it's boring for you, but I've not been bored yet and I play every day. If it does get boring I'll just play something else but they add new content to the game faster than I progress so I don't see myself getting bored...um ever...
---
Been naked since my first match, my friend.
---
The civil war graveyard/museum is where I went to actively search for it, when you fast travel in or load, it puts you right out front where it spawns, plus there's a yao guai in the parking lot that you can kill with the syringer for two birds with one stone.
---
It also just seems to get better in general after rank 10. 11 is a revolver skin, 13 is a 10mm skin, 15 is a power armor skin
---
I think a lot of people on here had good advice with level zone but I would also add, you can go do some NW for a while and pull down experience so that your character is stronger... 
---
Also what is your endurance level? A few points in there and the right perk cards will make a world of difference
---
I’m impartial
---
It wasn't me, there was some thread about it here about a week ago
---
Yeah, 10 and below is all the shitty profile icons and stuff
---
Ok. Here's advice from someone who did exactly that but at launch. Then came back out of stubbornness and orneriness because I've beaten every damned Fallout game and this one won't beat me!  
---
Explore.   
---
That's it. This is a game with a beautiful map and it helps to know that you level up here through some quests but mostly the game is about exploring. You can follow the main quest (though let's be honest, it doesn't deserve that title) but don't do it in one go. Stop and explore and kill monsters between sections. It expects you to be jumping like crazy in levels as it sends you to more and more dangerous areas. So just explore and enjoy.
---
Oh, and ignore loot. The main game mechanic here is that you get weapon mods by scrapping weapons of the same type. So only loot what you can carry or scrap. And don't horde items. It's against all Fallout experience, but sell or scrap it all. Found power armor 5 levels above you and can't use it? Scrap it. You'll find more later, I promise. If you're not using it, scrap or sell it. Same goes for legendary items, healing items, food, junk you use to craft stuff, etc...
---
Ooh ok... I'll ck to see if I have it. I did the bos questline but I had blinders on .. thank you
---
Bro can you just hook a brother up on how to effectively get screws?  Holy shit I cant find any of these, I've had like 6 since starting.
---
as long as you don't make a separate account, yes.
---
Once I connect after waiting almost 10 minutes at a loading screen, game-play runs as it should half of the time.  The other half I receive "Server Not Responding", or sometimes it'll just move me back about 10 seconds of game-play.  
---
Everyone seems to like the new content but it is aggravating to spend at least 15 minutes for a couple minutes of game-play.
---
Yes, if you buy using the same Bethesda account.
---
Alright. Hit me up when you get on.
---
Tbh I can't wait for some one to make a list of all the ranks and rewards. I feel like that Hellfire skin is going to be really high in the ranks, same goes for that armor that looked like it had rebar spikes or w/e all over it and it came in like 4-5 different versions.
---
I mean... ghouls?
---
U can't get killed in ADVENTURE mode unless u take a workshop or u return fire
---
You’ve gained my respect from this, have a silver you deserve it!
---
&gt;There is no executive in the world that will spend a lot of money to fix a badly launched game. Why? Because if they fix the game, that will not generate new revenue.
---
It definitely was not your stance. This is what we were arguing about.
---
I thought you were a molerat.
---
The only issue I've had is finding screws.  Any advice there?
---
Take my upvote. Won't be able to unsee that.
---
What free event?
---
Honestly, i wish we got a comprehensive list from bethesda themselves on the portal. That would rock.
---
This is amazing, do we have a page like destiny Sherpas for 76?  Just a chill place to offer help and request backup.
---
I didn’t see that one. I’ll have to take another look, thanks!
---
I've put in 12+ hours trying to play the new content.  I am still level 2.  Is everyone else having atrocious load times?  10 minute load time is my average just to get to the lobby.
---
Not at all. I load in almost instantly
---
Because it isn't just cosmetic. It's an underarmor.
---
That or just let us see all the ranks in the character section of challenges. I haven't played the BR yet but the 1 challenge is NW: Unlock Overseer Rank 1 Once, Reward = Vault 51 Jumpsuit. So might be worth checking that out and seeing if it show's what the reward is after every rank up?
---
I hope it’s all in adventure/pvp only and they quicken up the lobby for BR. The vault does look amazing but I’d rather get to the fightin rather than ales it an extra 3 or 4 minutes.
---
My Fallout 76 is not installed on the drive that it wants the extra space to be on.
---
I must accidentally returned fire. But I dont know how since I didnt even know he was there. I was in workshop. This sucks
---
Thanks for the info brother 🙏
---
yes! i've been crafting/dropping barbed/flaming pitchforks too. :) it's the the most fun 2-handed melee weapon i think, i would have loved one when i was new.
---
i've also been dropping civil war suits &amp; dresses.
---
The 4:7:2000 error is driving me nuts. I have a 26 character software generated password and every time I exit a NW session it forces me to log back in. It won't allow a password paste either so I have to kill the game in task manager and relaunch via the Bethesda Launcher which doesn't actually log me out.
---
Yes, but it only shows for the next level, never anything further.
---
I like the knives, don’t get me wrong, I’m a melee first player but...
---
I love the inlay skin for the lever action, why in God’s name hasn’t there been a handmade skin offered yet, or have I just missed it?
---
Survivalists outfit + brown or yellow flight helmet on me. Works like a champ.
---
This is the best BR I think. Why? Cause it's nuts! Grenade launchers, miniguns, power armor, it's actually fun! There is no camping 10km's away and trying to snipe someone. 
---
It's quick mayhem and it's lovely.
---
Depends on what perks are active, could that be it?
---
Reason they should show all the ranks. Although I feel like if it goes based off Adventure or Survival it could be Overseer Rank 50 (But that might just be me guessing?) Surprised it hasn't been datamined yet, maybe when it gets close to releasing, I feel like it would have to be a list in the files showing the max rank and rewards per rank.
---
no thank you

Is what I use in my custom ini file. Just came back yesterday.
---
Go into the FO76 game settings and check if the Chat Audio slider is all the way down. 
---
For the last 4 months me and only 1 other person I've played with have had the issue that everytime we hop worlds the chat audio is set to zero
---
Same happened for my main, no such luck on character 2 :(
---
headshot damage?
---
Good post. This is a question I've seen a lot and I didn't have any good sources.
---
Im playing the game during free trial and Im almost convinced to buy it. Survival mode looks really exciting but there's one thing that bothers me and you mentioned it in your thread. Overpowered weapons. I guess Stealth boy should be removed. I would love to see permadeath option too.
---
The game is really not that bad and it has potential to be more casual but funnier Dayz
---
But I can strip down to nothing?
---
Nope. It's just less terrible than expected.
---
They should come back noticing the Blackbird paints came back and people wanted them for months, now they’ve been in the store for a week and Bethesda decided to leave them in for another week.
---
Hornwright in Charleston maybe?
---
Why do they deserve credit for turning around a game they purposefully launched under-baked and buggy as fuck, exactly? A gane they didn't expect people to want or to have it get high reviews?
---
You guys giving Bethesda credit for fixing a broken game and adding content to it that should have been there at the beginning is really sad. Probably why Bethesda and Todd couldn't give a shit how much they piss people off 'cause they know people will still kiss their ass.
---
I was just wondering if this was possible. Well done!
---
Nope, still seeing them on mine.
---
Nice work.
---
This is probably the only way I will ever win.
---
Sorry to hear that. I managed to go into the settings and turn on the damage numbers earlier today (before trade attempts) and test that out in adventure mode when I was able to stay connected for a minute or two but that’s about all I have done with the new content.
---
The odd thing is all of this started happening BEFORE the update for me so I don’t know if it’s a possible cause or coincidence.
---
Did you have your issues prior to applying the update or after updating?
---
There’s ultracite at every fissure site on the map. You could have picked everything up in a fast travels
---
Yup. Every time it goes back to the title screen, it counts as a disconnect for me. I have to close the application and restart FO76. This happens whether I sit and watch a match to completion or upon quitting. Going right into another lobby would be way better, but I expect it to count as a disconnect nonetheless.
---
Started it up and when it comes time for me to create my character the audio cuts out. Found it was a common bug and went through all the fixes I could find. Was really happy to be able to try this out for free but looks like I won't even be doing that. Who wants to be play a game with no audio!?
---
76 days?
---
Also check the miners memorial, that's where I got mine
---
And added bonus, as soon as you find it, you are gonna be finding broken prosnap cameras all the hell over. I have six in my stash
---
I mean the current version, with updates and all
---
What platform are you? I've got some ultracite ore I could sell you on PS4.
---
I think 2 min is too long along with long load times, I just want to get into a game.
---
I read a post that said it’s almost 97 GB
---
I really hope so. Cause while I may be a Responder, I'm an edgy Responder.
---
Oh well that's annoying, thanks for the heads up.
---
Oh hey, your link just goes to the Imgur page for that picture.  Did you also have a look for the Bethesda page where they give the info?
---
I’d pay good atoms for one of those in my camp!
---
And lick my balls whoever downvoted
---
I find it very hard to take the man seriously.
---
Aight thanks
---
Hahaha same dude
---
Well I'm not playing adventure mode until they fix it and that's gonna be a while. And both me and you know that the BR mode is not just gonna be a trial game mode.
---
26
---
I just walked into the showers with two ladies in there... proceeded to turn on the shower 😜
---
Me too!
---
Yeah same. I can ear my mask. It's just disappointing to spend $7 for nothing.
---
Workshops flag you for pvp.
---
I wasn’t really into having excavator but now have a full set of it in the stash with blood raider on it (I got both, and tbh it’s the only reason I made another set of excavator was for blood and bone. All the other skins don’t really interest me.)
---
&gt;  I was in workshop.
---
Holding a workshop automatically flags you for PvP.  Doesn't matter if you return fire or not.
---
I think they should up e EXP amount a little. Seems so long to rank up
---
I was actually gunna buy that for the sole purpose of using it in NW, this is bloody good info thanks
---
how do you deal with the long wait time?? its like 7 minutes to join a game after loading screens, and after dying gotta do it all over again
---
I was baffled for the longest
---
You should have gave it to him anyway just to see his reaction
---
Lmao... "Chinese Legendary Farms"
---
How'd  you know, datamining? Morgantown will be tight as fuck, will miss marsupial though
---
I’m saying… if I want to play solo, there should be NW lobbies with only solo people.
---
My wife has been playing on the couch next to me so honestly, I just watch her play.
---
First nuke launched 2 weeks ago at level 122, solo.  No rush...
---
This guy was great for a distraction from all the creatures running around but besides that he wasn't much help. I just thought it was good fun though, not complaining at all. Good on you for coming in clutch with those stimpaks though, I'd much prefer that over everyone shooting at it when you really only usually need a few with good guns.
---
Yes, datamining. And it'll be Morgantown and the general area around it. Same for the others.
---
maybe north/central/south variants? If only one I'd probably have to go with Top of the World.
---
I greatly enjoy the Excavator armor I just hate the gaudy bright yellow color.
---
Yes, but a tactical ops, much like a vault suit, is an underarmor. It start with a VERY small base dmg resistance and is later upgraded with certain plans.
---
But because it has a dmg resistance (even though it's the same as the vault suit you would normally use in nuclear winter), then I guess it doesn't classify as a cosmetic.
---
I think it's a mistake and theyll probably change it for the real release.
---
I'm having a hell of a time with that quest lol it keeps repeating itself for some reason if I join another server. I didnt realize it until after doing it almost all of the way through and my buddy asked me to join his server so he could keep his workshops while he gets off for a moment and it restarted itself when I joined in.. not gonna lie I rage quitted lol
---
I stand corrected, thought I’d read every day. My apologies.
---
Yea, that’s how we all felt about it xD.
---
I may just go there. If I am sever hopping might as well farm goul bears
---
So... What is a ping?
---
Sweet cheers for the info mate appreciate it, you know if Charlston will include any of the Ash Heap?
---
yes it is!! ugh. There's no tag system (e.g. Apex) so it is VERY DIFFICULT
---
You can use an external tool.  bethesda.net
---
I disagree.
---
Most reviewers completely overreacted to the issues.
---
If you would say the game is a 8/10 now the bugs at launch wouldn't make it a 3/10.
---
Would love to help you out if you need any sort of help
---
Honest question, have you ever played a BR? This post sorta just outlines the entire premise of them.
---
Also, the visuals for the nuke changed in Adventure mode. It's significantly worse. I believe it's a mix-up with the nuke from NW?
---
do all the file checking stuff.  1st: Bethesda Launcher
---
This sub was so bad with hate I just couldn't stumic it. I liturally just re subs like last week. The game it's in a really good spot not so this sub has finally calmed down.
---
And yes it's considered an article of clothing that can be removed. However, so is armor. The issue that I think caused the problem is the dmg resistance. Although it is irrelevant.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbvCI22Gtvc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbvCI22Gtvc)
---
I have had that happen when I've jumped into a server that has recently been nuked. It is remnants of the nuke, at least in my experience.
---
Question?
---
Would it be a bother to ask if you could post a video showing what fine is? This game is incredibly choppy &amp; cannot hold consistent 30 frames on a PS4 pro.
---
It will include a fair amount of the Ash Heap. 
---
And to answer your question from another thread of yours I read earlier, the Hellfire PA is the asset from Creation Club. There's also a few Creation Club weapon paints coming.
---
It should. If it’s not have both or all people restart the game.
---
Do you have damage display turned on? This is a new character I’m using, Level 22, I have very few perks. Sometimes the damage output from my Weapons is double, and sometimes damage is a fraction of what it should be. This is really confusing, but love the display.
---
Try a clean install of nvidia drivers.
---
Have you ever had a disruptive or toxic player you took on the tour and just turned the group against him to where they all just beat him down on your order and left him in cranberry bog contemplating his life choices? ....Yeah that was me. I will have my revenge!
---
I had not seen the blueprint options. Did it happen each time you used the max size blueprints, or occasionally?
---
But what about the simple aesthetic of a rickety shack on a hill? You can't beat that.
---
On all platforms *
---
So many newbies on PC! I can only play one of my characters because it's the only one that can solo a SBQ. I gotta do something with all these keycards taking up space in my inventory. I'm about to launch on Morgantown if they don't hurry up and git good.
---
J/K!
---
Maybe... ;)
---
Yup, that's what I was doing... I tried to spice it up a bit showing some (many multiple...massive) amounts of Orbital Strikes on Mister Handy lvl 8s with raining down artillery trying to pump the the people up!!! "YOU WILL HAVE ALL THIS UNLIMITED POWER!!!" I told them... as it was all raining down..
---
But all I did was scare people and they ran off into the dark unforgiving woods... I saw them on the map and they then disappeared...likely eaten alive..  (How I failed you gibberish named people 5+) So.. I learned and I settled for just dropping bags of water and weapons and ammo. Now I need more screws and hopefully don't screw people into death like I did when I started out. Case and point... help them but don't over do it by showing them what they can do later on, it'll be too much for some.. Much love for this post. Keep it up.
---
Half of any fallout game is exploring without a quest or a marker. With this huge ass map, there's alot of stuff to explore
---
Try changing the setting but I have found this an issue as well on ps4
---
Do you use party chat a lot in other games? You may have to switch your priority from party to in game chat
---
How long does a silo run take?
---
I was honestly bummed when I heard about br at first. But I can't stop playing it it's so fun. And the rewards are totally worth it. Got my first Lazer rifle skin today.
---
Thanks
---
No issue with FL AT ALL. Been playing since Jan.
---
sounds good :) 
---
i just bought it just now :)
---
The difference between the way you feel and the mainstream haters is that you have played the game and have a valid reason to be upset. Hopefully with the new content coming out it won’t feel like such a grind.
---
Aw :/ that’s too bad
---
If I do troll, it's by blowing up cars. I don't grief, I don't rip people off, I only blow up cars. And even then, the other player doesn't get hurt when the cars blow up because PvP hasn't been activated. So it's for my own satisfaction
---
But if anyone ever needs help, I'll help them and I'll give them items, just be prepared for a harmless (but kinda loud) explosion if you're around me
---
Just a side note buzzblades are some of the best weapons in the game. 
---
A vampiric one keeps you max health dummy easy.
---
A bloodied one does 200+ damage per hit like it’s nothing.
---
Overly generous (charisma Perk) gives 50 rads per hit on melee weapons, with a buzzblades 3-6 estimated hits per second that’s mad rads.
---
Buzzblades man.
---
They need an intelligence energy weapon perk.
---
Intelligence Is almost useless especially if you swap perks to do stuff.
---
There should be a perk for damage and perk to reduce durability loss both in the Intel tree.
---
Don't take everything from every container. Stick with a couple of guns and at least one melee weapon. Don't take multiple copies of the same weapons you are going to use. You still have manage your inventory weight.
---
did all that stuff, verified my game, wiped the drivers, used the latest one, then tried my older one. still nothing. i play for less than 30 seconds and it just crashes. never once had this problem with my 1070 when i played the beta
---
Making Camps bases help alot. Having them pre made as a blueprint is even better.
---
I learned it from countless scrapped marine armor pieces. I couldn’t tell you how many, but I would honestly guess hundreds. I just got it for the arms a few days ago and I’ve been playing since release day. It’s all RNG.
---
They fixed it in a patch. Haven’t played for a while but was there a recent patch ? If so they could of reduced the bug.
---
Not everyone would be vaccinated against the scorched disease. Even in an alternate universe future, there will be anti'vaxxers.
---
School trip to the Mire
---
 The early release is a Beta, things will likely change.
---
What system are you on? I’m happy to join someone if I know ahead of time that I’ll be getting an invite. But I don’t usually accept random invites to team up.
---
My bet is they kill them off.   
---
The Scorch plot does NOT mesh with anyone else entering the region without dying horribly.   
---
So here's my guess.  
---
The entire scorch plot is deleted, the official stance is that the Vault 76 residents killed the scorch queen and ended the plague. The missions relating to it are deleted and replaced with new settlers vs raiders questlines.
---
Oh I get ya. Two of my friends blow up everything they see just to see the explosions lol. Same goes for me too, dont grief and don’t rip people off. Here to enjoy the game with the majority of decent players who aren’t trolls xD.
---
Shot location (for example a headshot) as well as armor for when its fractional?
---
Don’t be a twat.
---
I made it to top 3 by just hiding. Felt brave with my grenade launcher and did nothing but alert 1 to where I was. I lost. So close.
---
I have no silver or gold, but have an upvote. The most valuable thing i can give
---
Huh?
---
Bump
---
No thanks, I don't want other players to loot my corpse easier
---
It was broken by this last patch and just got updated this past hour.
---
Pretty much, people buying skins to flex on the BR.  I think it is very limiting, locking the BR behind 76 purchase.  If it had been like how save the world is seperate from FortniteBr.  I also think, ghoul, supermutant, robot, Molemen[really any sentient gun toting 76er] should be a playable option in a Fallout BR.  It also should have come out when 76 first came out. It would have been $$$$ for them.
---
Possibly, yeah. I just thought it was interesting, because it was only in and about the irradiated stuff of the small location. Like, it could be reasoned that the stuff is the radioactive variant because the area itself is much more heavily irradiated compared to the general local area.   
---
I suggest that because it's not a large area, just everything concentrated on that small spot
---
It may have been my error.  I moved the fallout files to a different drive in hopes it'd help.  The drive I put it on ended up being a different model than I had thought.  Now, I am moving Fallout 76 back to the original drive.  Hopefully that will help.
---
Windows keeps introducing incredibly bag updates the last year or so.  That could be the culprit.  
---
I would start with powering off ones home network for a minute.  Then do driver clean installs.  Then check windows updates manually.   Make sure your system has spare room on the system drive and the drive the game is installed on.
---
Also, make sure the game settings are not too high for your system.
---
Wow, that’s a good while then. So is it legs and arms as one skill or are their 3 separate ones for arms - legs - chest?
---
Thanks for the reply too 👍🏼
---
Have you looked for side stuff like the mistress of mysteries? A lot of 76 is more about events, world exploration, and workshop claiming than traditional quests.
---
The other problem is complexity. It's a lot easier to bug smash when your game has at most 60 minutes of gameplay and a programming team of five guys you know fairly well. Something like 76, cobbled together from something like 4, with as much undirected action as it has, is going to be horrifically difficult to bug smash, all the more so if your bug team doesn't have the sort of demented minds that would do something like try to duplicate items by screwing with the server timer. Especially with teams of good lord who knows at this point.
---
My personal opinion is that almost no good game will avoid day 1 patches. Now, yes, 76 was *much* more broken than usually acceptable, but it's also unsurprising given their previous releases. They make wonderful sandbox games, yes, but there is a reason they're referred to as Bugthesda. Given the choice of no more games, or extended patching to fix released games, I'd prefer the extended support.
---
I’m on Xbox
---
That sucks you had such a bad experience with it. Sorry to hear that yo.
---
use your phone or a PC to run a Ping app.
---
Just add it to the growing pile of challenges that are bugged! Will they fix it?? Who knows!
---
Niceee I was hoping they'd start implementing some of that stuff, I wasn't a massive fan of the design but I hope they implement that Anti-Materiel Rifle. Cheers again for the info you dataminers are fucking wizards lol
---
Nicely put!! I have no problems with honest criticism but it’s time to move on.
---
Stick close to team-mates and if team-mates go down, move fast. Other battle royales give more of chance or time to survive when downed. So if you're downed you need team-mates nearby and if you're team mate goes (this is for EVERYONE, PLEASE listen) don't be a douchebag and sit back and wait for the perfect timing, if it's too dangerous to revive. Atleast provide cover fire so that the other team doesn't finish off.
---
I played yesterday with a team that; an enemy squad of 3 surrounded our house I downed 1 from a window, downed 1 coming into the house, then almost downed the last, but got stuck because I teammates where blocking the stairway. There were 2 of them full health, with weapons, the last enemy had a fraction of health left and they ran and hid in a room. Leaving me to be killed.
---
A rough ballpark you are looking at 500+ matches (if the xp per level remains the same, and doens't increase as is the norm) as even a decent performance, a few kills and surviving ten minutes, will only net you at most a fifth of the xp bar. At 2 minutes to start from the lobby, a minute in loading (combined into lobby, in and out), and say 12 minutes survival, you are looking at playing hours every single day for three to four months if you ever want access to that lore in-game.
---
Hopefully as others have noted this is just a measure to stop everyone doing the sneak peek from being spoiled too early, because even the most hardcore aren't getting to 100 in a week (and if they do then they deserve the rewards and perhaps some medical treatment for the physical state they must be in after not sleeping and taking stims for a week solid), but I'm on the fence on the likelihood as they could have just disabled the tapes and made the laser gates generally impassable.
---
The reactions on here *and even on r/fallout , notorious for being particularly toxic towards this game*, are overwhelmingly positive towards this mode. It makes me wonder where all the dislikes on the e3 trailer are coming from
---
Don't have any mods, no custom/changed ini, varified files of launcher and game. What do you mean by turn off, like uninstall? 
---
Specs have been added to post. 
---
Thankyou for teplying!
---
Yep. It's a mess. Still buggy, but admittedly not AS buggy as it was.   
---
To be fair. The big fixes shown in E3 are all related to Wastelanders. So don't expect any changes other then them adding battle royale until Wastelanders goes live.
---
Yes! So much easier to spot!
---
I get the "slippery slope" argument. It's not compelling, especially when you can get atoms for free by just playing the game.
---
The nuke quest is the main quest.  The main quest expects you to be 50+ at some point.
---
Just kill a lot of monsters and craft a lot of stuff, you'll level a lot faster.  
---
Also, some items can increase XP gain, as well as the Team XP Perks.
---
A way of pointing out a certain location. Gives teammates a heads up on the location of gear, enemies, etc.
---
It’s in Firestorm, apex, blackout, pubg, pretty much every BR. It’s frustrating trying to point out a location when everything is just trees.
---
Do you use Power Armor?
---
A couple things -
---
1. For straight up more quests, read the posters on train stations if you haven’t already. They’ll lead you on the Nukashine, Sheepsquatch and Scouts quests.
---
2. Events - this is probably what boosted me the fastest when I was farming for some enclave armor. They give great experience, caps and weapons and different events have different rewards. Enclave events - healing items, armor &amp; water. Uranium fever - legendary weapons. Feed the People - canned dog food &amp; canned stew, low level weapons &amp; armor. Some of the ash heap events grant ores &amp; stuff. Free range - fight the sheepsquatch ;) they all give a decent chunk of good stuff though, try them out and see what you get.
---
Finally, just explore! I held off on all the quests until I found every location on the map (2nd character, level 95 atm) and for instance I didn’t even leave the forest until level 28. Obviously you don’t have to go everywhere. But it’s fun to just look at an icon on the map and run there, stopping everywhere along the way. You might be surprised at what you find if you keep an eye out :)
---
But otherwise, the quests are really only used to get into the Enclave bunker, and also the quest rewards are level scaled (that’s why I waited to do them) for instance, if you complete a quest at level 30 you’ll get a level 30 item, and if you do the same one at 50 you’ll get that legendary reward as level 50. That’s why I waited
---
Final thing - if you have a hazmat suit and someone nukes Whitesprings, just crouch in and tag the ghouls. You’ll get a decent chunk of HP and loot for tagging them. If you’re on PC I can help with the silo too :)
---
there's a 3 hour video of fallout bugs. I'm sure the few false bugs had not been the breaking point for people not liking the game.
---
didn't show up for me when I checked main
---
Thanks for getting to it first my man!
---
Ah. Ok. Thanks
---
Glad to help!
---
About to go into match. Trying this.
---
Legs for legs, arms for arms, and torso for torso. I wish you good fortune in your pursuit.
---
I hate PVP, so this is exactly what I didn't want from this iteration of Fallout.  I wanted people working together to make a better world, but nope.
---
Diable or uninstall, is knwo to cause issues with alotnof games
---
Maybe if you're humping it through the sunlit plains. Me, I stick to the dark underbrush, thank you kindly, and it's been working for me better than "nekkid tiiiime!"
---
Well that is just my thoughts.
---
So many reasons. It needs to be reverted back to day one. All accounts unbanned. Chaos and fun again.
---
Make sure you're running fullscreen and not borderless windowed, update all drivers and try using "iPresentInterval=0" in the .ini to force no vsync
---
A friend of mine had the exact same issue with a gtx1080 and a high end intel cpu (can't remember which) and if I remember correctly his issue was that he was running in borderless instead of fullscreen
---
In some cases just applying a tiny OC on the cpu might do the trick. I've read about people having similar issues with other games and just changing the clock speed a tiny bit fixed it. But I'm guessing that won't help in this case
---
I'm level 43 and haven't done the nuke quest yet, if your on Xbox I'm down to do it with you.
---
Use multiple and it worked pretty much every time just drop it down and build it a few times and the entire server lags out and crashes. Would probably be even easier with a few people working together to crash the server.
---
this sub is going delusional
---
Unfortunately no, I couldn't get my Mr. Attorney bot to agree on my waiver, so we stay out of cranberry bog.
---
No, you are right.  I haven't turned it on a few hours but the news on the game itself said daily.
---
It doesn't seem to be a rare problem either since my 2 friends I play with get the same error very frequently. It surprises me that this/another post of this issue is getting little to no attention.
---
I submitted a support ticket and only got a generic automated response back which gave me basic instructions that didn't help... Guess I'll manually reply and hope for an actual answer...
---
I'll update you if I get a solution, let me know if you figure anything out before I do, same goes to u/hericstrada_pc
---
I play on Xbox so everything except for the network stuff I can’t do.
---
I have turned it (router and modem) off and waited a minute before restarting to see if that would fix it. I didn’t unfortunately. I’m pretty sure the issue is specific to fallout 76 though since non of my other online services are having issues.
---
I do use an external hard drive though and I have launched the game on both the external and internal to see if one of them was the issue but had the same results with both (disconnects).
---
Thanks for the suggestion though, hope you find a solution to your problem.
---
Yeah, it sort of kills my buzz for the trial.  But I completely get it too.  But I would be obsess with getting as many trophies as possible and would have bought the game too.  But it was a nice trial.
---
DogZilla the destroyer has struck again
---
Maybe not directly together, but in a couple of articles and YT comment sections about the BR mode, I've seen some people saying shit like "the game failed so hard, they're turning it into a BR" or "nothing after NV is worth playing". Generally along these lines. Usually with nobody who has actually played the game being there.
---
&gt;your naked ass on the other hand is harder to spot
---
 You’ve obviously never seen my naked ass...
---
I’d enjoy that. Maybe a trading area but vending machines kinda make that unneeded
---
And? I never said people were somehow wrong or bad for not liking the game. A 3 hour video of bugs falls right in line with what I was saying was fair criticism. Maybe you meant to reply to someone else.
---
Thanks I'm 11 so my voice is changing but I love this game
---
Its their chat thats saying that, the people that aren't playing the game and have only watched reviews on it trashing it
---
Br is the new death match for pretty much any game these days. And thats actually OK with me.
---
so, the cosmetic outfits you can favorite for nv you can wear at the vault, but when you load in the game you're in your vault suit, you can still change into your cosmetic outfit but then you can't use armor with it.bethesda said in another post that it's intentional so that armor is easier to see. power armor skins still work tho.
---
I accidentally hit enter before I finished and edited my response.  Sorry about that.
---
My claim is that they are doing only critical bug fixes to meet whatever obligations they have due to contracts with Sony and Microsoft.  That includes game balancing.  That does not include new content.  New content can also be an improved user interface, for example.
---
Mind listing the perk cards you’ve seen?
---
I’ve got:
---
3L quick hands 25% insta reload chance
---
1L pharma farma
---
1P sniper (75% breath)
---
1C EMT (60s regen on revive)
---
6L Lucky Break (Repair armor...ummm)
---
3P master commando 40% auto rifle dmg
---
3E ironclad 60 DR/ER outside of PA
---
3S Incisor 60% ARmor pen
---
PS4? if so ill gladly help ya out
---
Sounds good to me :)
---
Ok dude, whatever you say.
---
I enjoy the game and aside from a rocky launch i really don't feel like i have been lied to.
---
But whatever you say, keep on hating. I'm sure somebody in the bandwagon will listen
---
I mean i solod it at level 30
---
It was tough af but doable, just stay mobile
---
You could.... Talk? Over the mic?
---
Disc or digital? Do you get a code when it crashes??
---
Nice, another good easy spot for lead is lakeside cabins, the workshop just on the edge of the dry lakebed near Camp McClintock in the middle of the map.
---
It has a lead resource you can place a resource generator on and if you look just next to the gate on the perimeter fence there’s a power box that will either have 10 or 100 power depending on if the power plant has been restored. 10 is enough to run the resource generator so all you need to do is wire it up and harvest. 👍
---
Honestly I have no idea. I had to start over fresh basically. When was your suspension?
---
Ok cool, I'll do that
---
Additional suggestion for PC: If your team is capable of communicating in voice, at least listen and emote thumbs up/down to indicate awareness. Watching two dudes yippie ki yay their asses directly into an ambush I called out to them is vexing, as is the one guy simply grabbing literally every weapon they find and leaving me and another team mate with literally our fists. FFS, you don't need more than two weapons at a time, especially when one is a .50 MG, you putz!
---
You are a legend, my friend! I just started carrying my best friend and now I've got a much better way to introduce the game to him. Actually PLAYING the game with him instead of trying to level up as fast as possible. Inspiration to us all, brotha!
---
They can be used as part of the enclave main quest to unlock silo to launch nukes.  They expire weekly.  Most peeps just use nukacrypt instead of trying to find them all, which can be tedious.  
---
Unless you are doing the enclave (unlikely if you are lower level), ignore and they will eventually self destruct and disappear from your inventory.
---
Xbox :/
---
Would also like a different pipboy, as why would I want to scroll through my adventure mode guests or junk etc while in nuclear winter.
---
No more of a justified bully
---
After moving Fallout 76 back, loading times were improved.  
---
If you have a smart phone you can just run a ping app.  Just make sure your smart phone is only doing data on your home network and not the cell network.
---
never got into power armor but happened to me too, i loved it
---
Im lvl 19. Should I just ignore them till im higher level
---
Digital all my games are
---
Yeah that particular bug was patched out a while ago but has resurfaced on a very small scale. 
---
What happened to you was very rare and isn't representative of the game at all. 
---
Give it another go and if it happens again you can get the privilege of calling the game trash or whatever
---
Once you collect 8 for a single silo, you have to decipher them into a new set of numbers. You can skip this whole process by looking up the weekly codes on nukacrypt, but I'd recommend doing it the first time yourself. Google how to do it and you'll find an explanation. It's pretty satisfying to when you do it on your own.
---
Yup. That's why I play. It feels endless and i always encounter something new and different. And if I obtain too much I can go into selling and make me some caps on the side for fun or just sell to robot vendors or try to give stuff to newbies
---
I love BR, and they freaking killed it!  Have had fun almost every match.  They variability of play styles available is really something special.  Knowing where enemies are when you spawn and heck spawning instead of gliding in is awesome as well.
---
Damn sorry my guy but theres bound to be others like you so keep searching.
---
Before i answer.
---
Are you remotely good? (Are you capable of getting at least one kill) ive joint about 5 different people yesterday from Reddit and well..... Yea...
---
you have full access to your camp building tools except torrents
---
It's funny because Apex showed up out of the blue and stole all the thunder. 
---
Now this Nuclear Winter came and stole all our hearts.
---
Xbox
---
an Hour and half to create a character?  Wow, I would expect the game to timeout before checkpointing.
---
It’s really too bad this post has so many less likes than it should. My opinion exactly, though a hot bar for our picked up items would be helpful too.
---
Yeah, it's not like of you choose to play without a team, a disadvantage, that you get more overseer XP. If that was the case, I would choose that.
---
You'll need to contact Bethesda directly, then.  Their customer support submit process runs 27 invasive diagnoses tools when you send in the completed request.  Yesterday, I did the "reply by cell txt" and was chatting with a tech within 10 minutes.
---
Wow, that is so sweet of you!
---
We need more kindness like this in the gaming world.
---
Just stop. You keep changing your mind and trying change what we are talking about.
---
Im 19, seen a 20 a few hours ago tho
---
What level are you? If you’re a higher level, find a low level player in an area that’s over their head, follow them, and let them die. Revive them, kill all the enemies for them, and you are their hero! It’s a win-win
---
Our camps still indestructible in this mode?
---
Lust looted several a couple of mins ago...
---
I absolutely love melee builds as they're both fun and powerful except melee players may find themselves dying more late game because of how powerful end game bosses can be. 
---
But I'm running a good heavy gunner build rn which I'd be happy to share what perks you need to invest in and what to skip out on.
---
Welcome wastelander! My GT is the same as my reddit name. If you catch me online I'll take you on a tour  to unlock some valuable fast travel points and hook you up with some gear if you want.
---
There’s a wendigo cave??
---
(I’m lvl 17, haven’t gotten very far 😖)
---
mothman plushie!!!!!!
---
Yup! That's it.
---
Yup.  Enclave is 40-50ish.
---
Bullying is never justifiable.
---
Yeah, apparently when you get to a certain overseer level, you’re rewarded with exclusive cosmetics. At least, if the Bethesda website is anything to go by.
---
I'm not into BRs.
---
Im into this BR.
---
The lever uses a nice dot but see what you mean.
---
use gun, if that don't work join a team and use more gun
---
Don’t have the game open currently (surprising right?!) but as soon as I can I’ll send you a list of what I’ve got unlocked.
---
Thanks!
---
*laughs in lead belly*
---
Fruit machines? What am I missing about Vault 51?
---
Pretty sure I have a fix! Apparently, you need to boot up the game directly from the Fallout76.exe file buried in your chaotic folders. 
---
Go to Program Files (86)&gt; [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) Launcher&gt; Games &gt; Fallout76, simply double-click the file with the 76 logo. Now hurry up and abuse the game before the free-trial ends!
---
Right its a bug from long ago resurfacing because of server issues. Explosive is the number 1 cause for the glitch so as long as you use anything other then explosive you'll be fine. 
---
If you wanna keep using that explosive weapon then you have to exit the current server And rejoin another one.
---
Attack the first person you see to show dominance.
---
There isn't an autoaim feature. You have to actually aim yourself.
---
Yeah I did the Mistress side quest. I need to start doing events as I don't usually participate in them because I'm underleveled and my weapons are pure garbage
---
There is a popup. Did you read it? The part about PvP?
---
I’m gonna bully you as long as you wanna ignore factual corrections and speak nonsense. About as good a reason as there can be
---
I came back and just started a new character, I put perks wherever I wanted to and just had fun when it, now that I’m above 50, gotten some decent weapons worth speccing into and have a good idea on what play style weapons wise I enjoy playing, I’ve started swapping points out towards that
---
I think that is what they tried to do with the favorites. Only problem is they let everything you pick up stick there instead of just a handful of items
---
Expectations are key. Anyone who played Skyrim (or any other Bethesda game) had to deal with all the broken quests should know these things come standard in a Bethesda game. 
---
Everyone who didn't want an online multiplayer game, v just another sequel to fallout 4, was prepared to hate on this game since before release. All the "nobody asked for this game" comments were extremely common as soon as the game was announced.
---
People swear they have a profound hot take when they second guess every decision of a developer then get mad when the developer is true to their word and constantly improves and updates a game. They want so bad for everyone to hate on things rather than enjoy them. 
---
Now they have conspiracy theories that the crowd wasn't really cheering. This I'm mad and hate everything social media industry needs to die a quick and painful death.
---
no i takes damage normaly
---
Probably just got downvoted because there's already several posts about this with many more upvotes
---
I can run one in about 20 minutes.
---
The games finally finished downloading, I do not know what it was, but when I closed the launcher (minimized to the hidden icon taskbar) after 10-30 minutes the games ended up downloading normally :D
---
Please let this be a normal field trip...
---
"Was" one of he best weapons weapons in the game IMHO.     
---
 
---
Pre-Over repair Nerf they could damage competitively in comparison to other melee weapons (few friends and I did some kill speed comparisons), post Nerf they do trivial damage in comparison, in the same amount of time.   
---
(We did a BuzzBlade, Ripper, Combat knife, Axe, sledge, etc vs Supermutants and compared time from first hit to death, non-bloodied for a more accurate baseline).  
---
They still keep you very well healed but do pathetic damage.  
---
The Ripper is even worse...   
---
   
---
I'd like to repeat the tests at some point now that we have damage counters :)
---
If they made some of the other rifles like the lever action like the laser and a handful of automatic ones it would be perfect.
---
I recorded the entire thing for anyone that cares to see
---
Yes. But a level 24 Assualtron drains my health and my weapons suck. Like yhe best one I have is the Black Powder Rifle and that still takes like 10+ shots to kill for me.
---
It definitely helps. I got some garbage cards and even foolish duplicates (one star AND 3 star fix it good)
---
Use some builder websites to familiarize yourself with the cards and when they unlock. 
---
I'm working on a junkies build, I finally got a bloody character and the damage is great but kind of stress full. It doesn't take much to make my heart start beating. Maybe a chameleon/sentinel sniper build. Nah. Maybe I'll try to figure out how use cavalier well.
---
I am on xbox!
---
Go to the bridge. It has the best loot.
---
ill take that in mind. ill send off a salute emote or xbox you a message if i see you around.
---
Clearly you're a man of great taste and nobility.
---
At least it’s 20, this happens to my bear arms character and will go from 280/340 to 320/340 upon hopping servers.  Best fix for me is swap characters then swap back.  Should fix it.
---
Cool!
---
It mostly just depends on the area I feel, with some exceptions like encryptid and grafton day. Events will expose to to more legendaries and will give you better weapons.
---
I've repaired my installation, but the problem persists
---
Trust me, it’s well worth it. Even though the weapon reward is...a bit rng, to say the least...
---
I play on a pro and u get bluescreens all the time. It's just the game bro. If it playing for a few hours without a blue screen your having a good night
---
Pick up any gunpowder, ammo, aid items, or ores?
---
I assume Windows is installed on C:?
---
Always give Windows at least a few gigs of free space.  I panic when I get lower than 32 gig free.
---
I disagree, it's the same as others BRs, you say this because this mode is new, and people haven't mastered it yet, so it feels better to play with people that match your skill, and there is nothing wrong with that
---
People said the same thing about apex, and now that it is Full of hardcore players it is very difficult to play, same with fortnite and other games.
---
There is literally nothing that really makes this BR different than the previous ones
---
Well done is when the game doesn't crash and the servers are not disconnecting regularly.  BUT.... They did GREAT in making BR a fun experience that will bring in more people. Making the game stable and working out the bugs will make sure they stick around and buy stuff from the Atom store.
---
Lmao some mics have this weird things where it displays someone has talking so chances are its a glitch with the mic.
---
I know this since my mic does the same thing so chances are these people you are encountering just aren't talking.
---
You have to talk to the Mr Handy. He will give you a quest to pick up toxic waste, do that dump it in a barrel.
---
Same here with the Bunker Buster mission every time I log out and get back on it brings me back to around halfway through the quest.

sounds like mob mentality. People on the internet absolutely  LOVE to bandwagon on things. Its fucking stupid honestly. Its just popular to laugh at and hate on Bethesda right now. Granted, we are all aware of their mistakes and issues, but it gets to a point that its just ridiculous. I think a lot of it really is genuinely hyperbolic nonsense. So many things blown out of proportion imo and not to mention Todd's reputation is completely in the gutter now with all these videos that hype up how he lies and stuff. What a shame
---
Anyway, is there some reason we should have reservations about Cyberpunk? Im asking because I am genuinely curious, not necessarily because I disagree or whatever.
---
I havent disconnected once and have been having a whale of a time, might be your connection
---
Thank you, I've tried switching servers multiple times. However, the bug still persists.
---
Radaway too depending on the quality of your company
---
When did fallout become a BR?? Half serious question.
---
Which mr handy? The one at the camp doesnt say anything
---
Crashed Space Station looks like it could be a hub in Wastelanders. That would be awesome. IMO it's much cooler than Whitesprings, and should have less lag since Toxic Valley doesn't have a whole lot of performance impacts compared to other zones.
---
Happened to me too, wasn't even spending that long making a character. Best to just spam all the OK buttons and GTFO of the vault asap, then make your character appearance once the character is permanent on the actual server.
---
I have to reinstall the game every few hours cause it says the application is corrupted and won't let me play til I do
---
 A day ago
---
Check his jumpsuit, and check if his name is Reuben Gill.
---
He's been there for a while i think, i found him the other week.
---
Its a fallout game, you gotta check every pot for suprises
---
Haha yes I posted this and then noticed I had about 25 Nuka colas and another 15 nuka Cherry’s and 20 purified water . Always forget to check the aids!
---
I wear armour that reduces the weights of various things, like weapons &amp; food, drinks, and chems. This glitches pretty frequently and often requires reloading the app to fix. Could it be that?
---
I don’t have a mic

Everytime I get a blue screen the game also starts freezing and not loading things in before it happens

both work (no grass but still plenty of bushes) in the fallout76.ini file in mygames folder in both adventure and NW

There are a few dead Vault Dwellers scattered around. Haven Church and Red Rocket Megastop are two places I've found them.

It's okay, but I just feel bored entering it now. There's not much to do.
---
Still need SFE to be updated though.
---
Getting this a lot too on PC. Try loading into Adventure and then queue back to NW. Some say that works.
---
I've run into several dead dwellers in my travels. They are usually stuffed somewhere covert (like a refrigerator). 
---
There is little or no context surrounding the nature of their deaths, so we can't make any assumptions about who they are. Yet.
---
Why the hell did my brain read breathtaking as another word for breathing and not an actual word with a definition and why the hell did it take me a solid 5 minutes to actually acknowledge breathtaking as a word
---
What mode is free for all!?
---
he gave fallout 4 a 9.5 out of ten? Really? I don't know him super well but based on what videos of his that I have seen, that doesn't seem at all like something he would do. In his first 76 video I think, he seemed like he absolutely fucking hated BGS in its entirety and had hated them for a long time
---
Just turn off fill
---
Do pistols if you just genuinely like them, they don’t hold any relevance. As for other builds, if you want to do melee, don’t try to start off with unarmed melee cause you won’t be able to use PA and the unarmed weapons you get starting off aren’t spectacular when compared to other melee weapons. Explosive weapons like the Fat Man or Missile Launcher usually don’t see much use because their damage output doesn’t justify the ammo rarity and overall weight of the weapon+ammo
---
my question has been answered.
---
You mean no vats? I hardly use that as is so no worries there.
---
Only to save loadouts from ingame. Those created in Nukesdragons still work fine.
---
i have the opposite problem on xbox, i can hear ppl well (when i have my headset on, if it's on the tv i can't hear anyone) but ppl say they can barely hear me. party audio works fine
---
Turning off fill is not Free for All mode. It only makes you solo, not everyone else.
---
Heavy explosive guns so missle launchers and the like. 
---
Besides that? Not much. Some builds require a lot of specific stuff as to make it actually viable like most late game pipe gun builds but you should be good.
---
Yea but I think that’s just your team tho. I think everyone else is still teamed up right?
---
Decide what kind of weapon you want to mainly use, then focus on the skill that lets you deal more damage with that weapon type (for example, strength for heavy weapons, perception for rifles)
---
Corrupted. Hmmmm u didn't turn of the console or exit while it was loading ?
---
Well, you can make teams for Nuclear Winter.  Either with friends on the Social menu or keeping Team Fill on when entering staging.  Also, if you find the players in the Recent tab on the Social menu you can report  them there.
---
That’s a bit unfair tbh
---
What?
---
Ah I see
---
If you mean nuclear winter, there are teams of 4. You can autofill to get randoms to be on your team.
---
Sorry, man. I’m on PS4. I’ll leave it to someone else to help you through a silo.
---
Because a lot of the best weapons max at 45, the climb from 35-45 is a long grind.  Well-rested and cranberry relish help speed it up a little. But basically, grind events and kill enemies. If you have the stomach for it, travel light and play survival for the bonus experience (especially while the pvp-focused players are in the BR beta).
---
You do understand not joining a team just puts you in a match solo while everyone around you is teamed up?
---
I've been able to start actual testing of VATS crits. Still collecting data.
---
Thanks for extending the assistance - alas, I’m xbone. Seems the frequency for better gear in online 4 sale forums is on PS4.
---
yes and all ppl have to be on the main menu
---
&gt;Pretty sure I have a fix! Apparently, you need to boot up the game directly from the Fallout76.exe file buried in your chaotic folders.  
---
&gt;Go to Program Files (86)&gt; Bethesda.net Launcher&gt; Games &gt; Fallout76, simply double-click the file with the 76 logo. Now hurry up and abuse the game before the free-trial ends!
---
Reposted to you, just in case you still haven't found a fix, my guy
---
I have a be lmg, doesn't do that. No gatlin to test. Legendary enemies will heal once if you don't kill them first shot.
---
Look at the number on the back. Likely it’s 94. That vault opened briefly a little while after the war. Head over to it and read the terminals. It’s north of the mire near the truck stop
---
Ive been on all day and I live in some rural ass country. May be a problem on your side
---
I'm stealing that joke.
---
I mean idk for sure, I haven’t done it. I just assumed it meant you were going at it solo not like separate server for every man for himself. If that’s the case that would be pretty fun! But maybe else has 2 cents on how that works. I just joined random teams until I met some younger guys who invited me to a team and now I play with them. Communication is a huge advantage
---
When it blue screens for me the screen goes blue. Come up blah blah blah happend then it force exits me back to.the ps menu.  Then from there I re enter the game and it plays
---
You may need to go the the Atom shop to claim them first.  It's been a while since I did my tricentennial but I'm pretty sure I had to go to the shop before I could make the outfits at the armor bench.
---
Average of 5 games was roughly 1,000 XP to my adventure character
---
Wait until you see the frog legs perk...
---
If you mean the card packs, you go into perks in NW. If you mean the boxes, and other stuff, they are all cosmetic and can be viewed in the atom store/built,in camp mode or paint jobs added via work bench.
---
Checked that, connected via LAN and have fastest my area provides. The guy I played with had the same experience.
---
Please no respawn mechanic, that is something that is ruining battle royals.
---
If you die first up, its tough luck.
---
I'd like to see a leaderboard/stats (Shows how many kills you have overall, kd, other stats)
---
Ping system would be good.
---
I'd like to see a better notification system when you down/kill a player (Maybe bottom middle of the screen where it can catch your eye rather than top left)
---
I know this is a sneak peak and they have potential with this, but lets see what they do when the mode releases properly.
---
What what?!? I don’t spend much time on here reading on certain specifics on a new mode. I thought nuclear winter turning off auto fill would put you on a solo match just like most battle royales. I didn’t know it would only exclude you from being in a team.
---
Things have been going pretty smooth for me. Possible error on your end?
---
YES! Why players who can't use microphone have to be at disadvantage, because thres no simple pings like "Enemy there" and "Going over there"? That sucks at the moment
---
I did that earlier, worked like a charm.
---
I believe one of the community reps recently responded to an earlier thread that they took this request back to the devs for consideration.  Since this is beta, they are very interested in feedback and I expect this basic functionality will be in the release, tbd.
---
Yeah but when you have two seconds of invincibility left and you pick up a bunch of random shit without looking, you want to know what’s the best thing to switch to immediately. Not have to open the favorites wheel.
---
Bang there’s ur answer smart guy
---
Pistol is only viable as automatic vat crit build.
---
That im aware of but would be interesting to see if they add what she did between her last holo tape and the settlers/raiders coming into Appalachia
---
Hard crashed to home screen on xbox in my first ever NW match, I  didn't even have time to fire a weapon, but it was fine after that.
---
Double this. I actually just built my first true CAMP (not the usual cluster of crafting stations) and I’m level 52ish, and the only plans I have unlocked are the single action revolver, assaultron head, and lever action. Also just started rose’s questline, even though i came across the area back in my thirties. Nothing wrong with taking your time with the quests spread around Appalachia. You might cause a hell of a racket when you decide to do them, though, so you ^(might have some unwanted guests)
---
I just realized that after making this post genius!
---
Some ppl have been getting lucky with servers and others not so much
---
Check your connection and if it still doesn't work then I suggest waiting til tommorow or in a few hours.
---
I'll keep that in mind but im no help in events with a level 30 hunting rifle as my main weapon :(
---
True true, but vat damage won’t mean much if it’s like pistols only, I can attest
---
I guess. I tried deleting and downloading the game and alot of people reported server downs, figured it was the update
---
You can go to the site nukes and dragons and it will show you perk card layout for specific builds your trying.
---
Hello! I used to have this same issue. In order to troubleshoot your problem, please answer the following: 
---
1. Is your game set to run Fullscreen?
---
2. Do you use multiple monitors (2+)
---
3. Does your system currently have multiple GPUs running side-by-side? 
---
That I am aware of! But i mean what happened to her after her last Holo? She was severely wounded and about to pass out. Just curious to know what happened. Picked up by wandering merchants? Survived amd bunkered down somewhere? Guess i have to wait till its released ingame
---
Yeah, that’s different. It’s not hard to find other guns though.
---
"Okay you're absolutely right and I can't articulate a counter-argument and I might like Fallout for the wrong reasons but thinking is scary so I'm going to choose be salty instead still tell you to fuck off though"
---
&lt;3
---
No, whatever cosmetic you favourite in the atom shop, will be what you automatically load into vault 51 wearing. You will also be wearing a vault suit, but it won't show because it's an underarmor. 
---
Imagine the layers like this. The underarmor, is a long sleeve tshirt. The armor you get in the game is a shirt that goes over the top, but still leaving the underarmor visible. And the cosmetics are a jacket that then covers everything visibly. You are still wearing those other pieces of clothing, they're just not visible.
---
getting good requires a lot of not being good, keep at it.
---
Looks like you're the asshole to me
---
I look at it this way, if someone tells a helping out story, then maybe someone else gets inspired and does the same or something similar. It’s not as bad a thing as you think.
---
 "Hand over that toaster Civilian, it's too dangerous for your feeble mind"
---
LOL heard that in my head with Danse's voice. laughed out loud.
---
I'm a friendly helpful player
---
i know, man but im telling you, it works inside vault 51 but when you're in nuclear winter, in the world, you will be wearing your vault suit.
---
Try to stick with your team four guns are better than one also if you know your about to die drop some frag mines
---
I did once but it was on accident.
---
The chests? They’re just player icons, you can select them in the atom shop. One of them is a camp item, a small blue chest
---
It's possible.
---
The beam splitter is the only reason why it kills so fast. It's also the reason why it breaks so damn quickly too...
---
seems excessive.
---
Huh weird. So for you explosive weapons are completely unusable? Personally I have no trouble with them so I'm baffled by this.
---
Yes. Melee is still good even if you don't have a legendary weapon.
---
Have you been mean to todd recently?
---
Yeah man.  I play a 2h melee build with no power armor.  I 1 or 2 shot most enemies.  Even the tougher legendary enemies aren't too tough.  Can take down normal scorch beasts in a few swipes too.  If I have time later on I can link you my build.
---
It's fucking awful imo. I've had multiple server issues and bugs... I think what's worse is, they came out at E3 basically took the piss out of the fallout comunity, then said "we knew it wasn't going to be finished"... While knowingly lying about how 'new' it was going to be... Then ontop of all the bugs and server issues were facing in the actual game, they release a fucking battle Royale... Honestly it's becoming an absolute shit show.
---
Gunpowder, missiles, mini nukes
---
I mean, don't get me wrong, the ping sounds handy.  But I've been getting on okay without it.
---
 Ruh-roh. It's Scooby Doo!
---
Do you get an error code when you crash??
---
I think they should have grief friendly servers(open combat and open player base destruction) and story/exploration(current settings)
---
The hard part is going to go back to normal game play after this week.
---
Alpha definitely didn't work for me today :(
---
Meh seems like most of my teammates are always running around randomly anyway. Worth a shot. 
---
Btw. I was not successful lol
---
Same thing happened to me!
---
I punched a guy to death who had a shotgun,  at some point he realized that i was flanking all around his body, he panicked and started trying to run away instead of continue missing shots lol.  
---
anyways i downed and killed him!
---
Whenever I come across something like that I use a automatic energy weapon. Seems to do the trick
---
Sorry, some of my stupid might of seeped into my phone.
---
Eh. Personally I've always hated when a drastically higher level player attempts to help me, following me around and handing out free loot. Never liked sharing any experiences, and if you drop all that free shit, even if it's basically worthless to you, gives me a terrible sense that you're just patronizing me. =P
---
So if a guy just wanders off when you're emoting at them, or trying to use voice chat, don't bug them. Some players've done that to me a few hours ago when I started playing, and it's annoying! 
---
&gt;!Let the downvotes rain down on me!!&lt;
---
Happened to me as well, but can’t confirm it’s on my laptop using WiFi across the house or the servers themselves
---
I haven’t, but I’ve been in 3 different matches where another player did. (In one of them it killed me. 😂)
---
Problem is there are no stabilizers on the enemies after the nuke zone goes away but you can still get some caps for that raw flux.
---
I have the same system, same problem!
---
Ya. We had a guy nuke one of our matches. Dude was on my friend list from the 76 market forums. I loled as it completely screwed me. XD
---
People like to share their GOOD experiences. Not everything has to be so negative. Plus people want to let other people know that not everyone is a mean ass.
---
i've been building a ton of super modded level 1 pipe revolvers along with deep pocketed leather sets and handing them out to people exiting the vault. carrying some level 5 pump action shotguns that have been dressed to the nines has also been really useful to hand out to new players that i see walking around. im mostly a solo player, but i would love to see more people get into this game, so im trying my best to start them off with a fighting chance. i set up my camp between flatwoods and overseers camp using a concrete defense wall as a message board on the side of the road telling people to scrap every weapon and armor piece they cant use instead of dropping or selling it. that was one of my biggest regrets when i started playing. survivability lives and dies by the equipped mods, you know.  your tour idea is gold. good on you, mate, for making the wasteland that much friendlier.
---
You sound distressed. As a friendly, helpful player, how may I assist you? 
---
I have a satchel of mood altering chems. Here, look at me giving you a satchel of chems. Look at me!
---
LOOOK AT ME!!!!!!
---
Unfortunately I didn’t. Now I know. Next time I’ll know what to expect. It happens. People make mistakes and grow from it.
---
I've just been having fun finding all the exploits like the ability to crash the entire server by dropping max blueprint camps a couple times causes the entire server to lag and crash.
---
There’s one at the northern ski lodge in savage divide as well, iirc.
---
Opposition... have no slightest interest in BR
---
The one at kiddie corner cabins. 2nd or 3rd shack forward and slightly left of the fast travel in spot. Mr Handy is in the lake side of the cabin.
---
With /SDP40610? No WAY!
---
I don’t believe so. I’ve been a believer out of 76 since beta and have generally enjoyed myself.
---
Yeah I think they'll figure that out, preview week and all. Was wearing my snipers outfit, it's a...advantageous color...
---
I am running into this as well. On my pc which is not connected via WiFi. Only way I have got it to work is to shut down both the game and the launcher but even then it o my works for one round before the issue returns.
---
My team  just wiped out the map by building a camp and waiting out the rest of the players. We built our final camp just on the fire line and dropped a nuke dead center of what was left and it took out the rest of the players on the map. It was epic.
---
First we get told by 76 overseer to help each other ... along comes 51 and wants us to kill eachother
---
double bladed, flaming chainsaw maybe?
---
You can use max size camp blueprints drop them a few times and crash the whole server so you get the points quicker. ;)
---
I just posted this.  Over the last hour I've got in one match.  Every other time it infinitely loads into Vault 51.
---
That's my 8th hop and no luck :(
---
I was wondering about limb damage people say it only stacks cripples but it says damage lol
---
Buy Messiah Resurrection in the Atom shop
---
Are you already over rank 30? Damn
---
Not if you crash the server you're on. Right now the servers can't handle max size blueprints being used without massive lag and crashing by dropping it a few times.
---
So, garbage opinions. I’ve seen comments about them failing too, but mostly from people who seem like they just want to hate something or collect some likes.  People like that give legitimate criticism a bad name.
---
It’s what I do. It’s quite easy honestly. Just make sure to have incisor and martial artist as well as the other melee perk cards that pertain to your level.
---
That's why its best to make the decision on one's own. Never trust the media lol. I will say though that I don't blame anybody not wanting to spend the money on something damn near the whole world said was bad. Glad they did the free trial this week and that you're having a good time with it!
---
It does several times ot would have come in handy when I was next to a strange player
---
not even the slightest same problem that I have with Fortnite. I paid for save the world not this kind of mode and when the rewards that carry over to adventure mode are so small and cosmetic AKA no new perk cards....it just makes it a carbon copy of that game mode....not impressed and won't be playing it in the future.
---
agreed.  Dealing with equipment could feel a lot smoother and quicker for sure.
---
how about orbital bombardment?
---
I hope so. You said question enough.... Lol
---
The trick is to build blueprints in adventure and place them down quick
---
Not sure why but when I read this, it sounded like a robot voice in my head🤣
---
see bethesdas reply on this https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bz9wj1/atom_shop_apparel_cant_be_worn_at_the_same_time/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Msg me ur gamer tag
---
I agree hopefully the other vaults we can go in. Maybe A Spoiler: but if you think about it the experiments in the other vaults maybe still going if you think about it because it's just been 25 years after the bombs.
---
Have that same issue. Have to end task on both the game and launcher and relaunch it. Even then it will stop working after one match.
---
You keep track r bugs right? Try dropping a max size blueprint multiple times. You can crash the whole server just like thd old 100 leather arms used to crash it.
---
Running around naked isn't going to help if you forget to unequip the giant red arrow floating over your head.
---
If you are in a good team and talking to each other you can make sure to give the guy with bonus damage to heavy weapons the gatling gun you find and give the auto weapons to the guy specced for them. And etc...  its so much easier to win when your team helps eachother get properly equipped. 
---
And having the proper special points on will make a difference with that.
---

I didn't want it.  Still don't want it.  I've played it, and while I'll play it to unlock the skins/plans, I don't want to have to.  I'd rather that the development went into PVE content.  I understand why they did this though, as it's the repeatable kind of thing to keep entertained between PVE content, but still.. rather have PVE.

Sorry about that

we do . its called  microphone. so easy. but hardly no one uses. gets on my nerves. 15 years ago I was praying for this tech masterpiece now we have audible area chat and no one uses it or runs around playing stupid music blaring. people suck. I wonder if I am human sometimes. the way you weird humanoids around me act makes 0 sense to me. seriously Emotes are the current gaming generations for communication?emotes? wtf a picture is truly worth a thousand words but you don't need a thousand words to ask a neighbor if he has 10 millimeter to sell.
---
Deaf ears my friend,  deaf ears....
---
You have nothing but a vault suit. That’s it.
---
I’ve personally not had a problem getting any possessions back in adventure.
---
Why were you turned off is the real question? Its been good.
---
Then why didn't you do that? Lol can't even take your own advice.
---
Im trying a trial week as a seasoned Dayz player and the only thing that stops me from buying the game is lack of permadeath server :)
---
What kind of enemies and where were you?
---
It didn't, it is simply a choice to enjoy FO76 in a BR if you want, it is pretty easy to ignore.
---
Either I saw you or someone else doing this yesterday as I was passing through Flatwoods. It was cool.
---
Yup even figured out how to crash the server with max size blueprint. The servers are unstable like I figured they would be.
---
Mutations make it easier much easier
---
100% all of this. I don’t really bother with reviews because if I did Id miss out on a lot of games I’ve come to love.
---
Nuked whitesprings, great for legendaries (if they don’t despawn 🙃)
---
Yup never trust the fake news lol it’s like a train everyone jumps aboard on
---
You have nothing but the vault tec underarmor on. Thats it.
---
Each match you start all over. You find armor, weapons, chems etc throughout the map, each match. Only thing that carries over is XP. Thats pretty much it 
---
You can only have 7 perk cards equiped at all times, so doesn't matter if you level 100+. You can only have 7 perk cards. The ones from adventure don't even carry over, you have to start unlocking them all over again.
---
This is all done automagically
---
if they did it on personal PC at your camp or something that would be amazing. it would add to immersion and give us a needed communication tool as well. that is brilliant thinking I love it.
---
respect
---
ironic as fuck 😂
---
over half the team I have been on only one other person uses the mike and most people ( me included) suck at communicating were things are.  It really helps facilitate team play, especially with random teams.
---
That's odd, I've played quite a lot and haven't gotten a server crash yet
---
You made me laugh lol
---
No I've been having problems all day as well although it has been getting slightly better, as in about 10 minutes into a game instead of a minute or two in the vault.
---
True, but that assumes you have a squad or can get your PUB to turn on their mics.
---
Consider running a system disk cleanup; Windows uses a lot of files and doesn’t always clean up after itself.  See this from MS:
---
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026616/windows-10-disk-cleanup
---
Note that the space is not really freed up until after the reboot afterwards.
---
Good luck!
---
Haha yeah I’m pretty good and yes I can get at least a kill. I definitely can improve though!
---
This game was never bad , just a few hiccups here and there but overall is fun to discover and grind. Don't worry about the market and price of items. With the new legendary system all those people selling weapons for 150k caps won't last long. And they banned a lot of dupers and duped accounts. So is a matter of time to have everything back to normal
---
Different vault with a different overseer. In fact you are fighting to become the overseer.
---
Mb a regional sever thing?
---
[Here's my build.](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f4664ab&amp;d=sb0s42sm2sg1sn2se2p90p80pa0er0ej4c72cu1i90i42lt2l71lu2l92a70au1a03s70a81&amp;w=p10p40p30p00e60e00e10c50iq2i50ia0i30if0ii0ic4lm1l01lr0l20at1&amp;n=&amp;m=cfh)  I feel like I may have missed a few perks, but those are mostly the ones I run with.  I'd like to fit in martial artist, but I really feel no need to have faster swing speed ATM since i'm able to take things out with one or two hits anyways.
---
I never said I wasn’t. I murder noobs and blew up camps, I take over workshops from level 5s and trick people into aggroing me, I steal ballistic fibre from people all the time.
---
I finally ran out of space and scrapped them all, but I was hoarding all of the clean/undamaged items I came across.
---
Use a max sized blueprint and build it and then pick it back up and place it againm, only takes a few times to start lagging the entire server out. Can even completely crash it if you want.
---
I have gained a level once
---
From the sound of it. Nobody is a mean ass. Everyone is nice af and it is sickening because these same people are assholes.
---
You don't take Anything in with you. Only a vault suit that's auto equipped soon entering the loading screen into vault 51. Feel free to take this off if you want to save 1 carry weight.
---
You can take in any outfit or skin you bought from the atomic shop.if you wish.
---
How is respawning ruining battle royale? That makes no sense brainlet. "If I die, I dont wanna be able to play again"

 Many Atom store skins also work in BR if you favorite them in the atom store.
---
also dont force our pve characters to be locked to our pve stat distributions.  
---
i play melee in pve but why on earth would i want to do that on NW?
---
Yea it takes me a good 5-7 minutes to leave a game and join a new one. I wish they had a option to just go back to the vault or something.
---
This.  I wish everyone had a mic in NW.  Such a huge advantage.  Remember that the majority of people playing this are NOT regular BR players, they are Fallout players that are still learning the ropes and having fun.  The moment this becomes serious business, the fun (and the players) will go back to adventure mode.
---
I legit got blocked because some low end youtuber was shitting on it and making shit up while I was talking to him. I only said I liked the game and I'm glad Bethesda is listening and he kept argueing with me and saying shit that legit showed he knows nothing about the community or the game.
---
You know they didnt release the BR right? Its out for 1 week
---
It's worth a lot more depending how many people you kill and how long you last. I scored over 1500 on one game.
---
OK put in about 10 to 20 matches after work yesterday
---
it was fun for about 5 matches - loved the burning ring, like some of the fighting some of the time
---
did not like it over all by the end of my session - just overall BR type play. short pointless, shallow, luck plays far to big of a factor. dont like the mode, I feel like it was done well but I don't have a lot of experience with BR to compare it too so take that with a grain of salt.
---
Just play it. You're going to die but you lose nothing. Then play again.
---
Yeah doubt this’ll be fixed by it fully comes out
---
The game wasn't bad to begin with, but reddit and streamers want there to be something to complain about, so they find any little thing and will beat that dead horse till there's nothing left.
---
In Burrows, if a body disappears you can find the meat pile at the ghoul's spawn. It could be the same for Whitespring. Do you know where the spawns are and have you checked them?
---
It was never as bad as they said, and it has gotten much better as time passed.  I am glad you are having a good time hope you stick around.
---
Bethesda wasn't ready for the servers to have adventure, survival and Br mode. The servers are taking a toll right now. Can barely play 2 hours without crashing. Before the free try i was playing constant 9+ hours never had a crash.
---
That game mode sucks. Then I played it lol
---
Thsts why u dont base ur opinon on what others say
---
I do, and will give it try once I get home in a couple days.   
---
What platform? (Console, PC, etc)
---
 I been playing since it came out about 6 months ago and honestly I didn't have that much bugs (well I did but they didn't bother me) the reason there were bad reviews of the game is because people had a bad first feeling of the game the first few months of the game were not to good but but no the game is great so after this hopefully people will start seeing its great game the people that I would say still have a bad feeling of the game maybe still hate it from when it was released or the they hate a fallout game being a online game. (That might not make sense or it's to long what am saying is FO76 is a great game and I agree with you and people should try it out.)
---
The hero the people need
---
I’m not talking about the future. I’m talking about right now. We don’t know how long it will be gone and how long we have to wait.
---
Honestly i downloaded this game for the free trial and instantly bought it the next day due to the sale. My first encounter with a person made me want to get into it. Gave me supplies and helped me with a world event.
---
When one leaves Nuclear Winter match, the text bubble tells you to log on Adventure mode to look at what you received from the match.  I didn't find anything in adventure mode, though.
---
Wastelanders is good on paper but let's not forget how short the main quest in fo76 actually was. I'm super stoked for wastelanders but won't hold my breath as I suspect it will be too short on content.
---
That sucks
---
Once the game runs on PS4 sure. The moment a fire fight breaks out, the frames disappear. ☹️
---
Is not you is the servers , they will get better once they upgrade for better performance. Bethesda wasn't ready for the amount of flow of players.
---
That would be better too. Downing is much harder to do, so it should be rewarded with the most XP. Kills should not be rewarded nearly as much.
---
I wonder how many of the free week players will stay.  I wish beta players had a unique emblem next to our names
---
I think he means about respawning during the match.
---
I'm a power armor melee build. Armor to give me a solid carrying weight limit. And using a selection of knives to really enjoy the close up fighting style. 
---
The Vampire or Furious combat knife with swing speed is a lovely little health dropper, with a small mob of 4 supermutants there is a flurry of stabs and then collecting of guns and junk.
---
Perks suggested for this build, Gladiator ones, incisor for the knife.
---
Pain train, and full charge for power armor, to use as a battering ram to stun your victims before slicing them to pieces.
---
I do couple rounds of NW and then switch back go my daily grind of adventure. But never survival. Unless is a weapon challenge
---
Depending on your level it differs. You can go to the atom shop (levels 1-10) and see the icons you’ve unlocked. And also it gives you a stash box that looks like a small loot box. That’s as far as I’ve made it tho.
---
 I am enjoying BR as a diversion, but honestly, it is not my thing.  I really like that you earn caps and P for adventure, as I wait for new quests with Wastelanders I can enjoy BR when I am bored with farming.
---
Congrats
---
It kind of hurts my soul to say it, but every game should probably consider a Battle Royal mode for their upcoming games.  Judging by their popularity, that is just what this generation of gamer likes.  Also, for whatever reason, there is usually a distinctive lack of click bait hate videos for BR games.
---
Let me quest next vault will want us to breed like rabbits
---
Perks, Perks, Perks.
---
Lvl 25 is start of Power Armor. (equip the Power Armor Chassis without any armor.  Adds a ton more carry weight.)
---
Having a camp is best for food and water.
---
My suggestion would be to focus on going after the .50 cal mg which comes in lots of locked crates and kicks even more ass!
---
Thanks m8
---
I saw it a while ago and shifted to the private server life. I've had some amazing times playing Legion on a server large enough for LFR ques to actually go off regularly but still small enough that you can see the same people randomly in said LFR ques. Nothing like ingraining yourself deep enough in a WoW community to be able to get seriously obnoxious rulebreakers muted out of world chat with a single discord message.
---
Strange, haven't had that one... Yet
---
Tbh was thinking of buying when they announced the update anyway, it's dirt cheap at walmart rn. But free trial week was icing on the cake
---
Rat poison contains lead.
---
I hope for both those things. A overseers loyalty corps badge would be awesome
---
Idk the more I think about it I'm not sure. Actually killing someone may be easier but it's more crucial
---
Silver pocket watches typewriters and deskfans are my go to for screws
---
If theres any others i havent mentioned because yeah i wonder the same thing
---
Every timeless Bethesda game has had glitches and bugs. But people still buy the games. I knew what I was getting into. It has had problems. But I thoroughly enjoy the games, and I will continue to advocate for them based on the enjoyment I get from them.
---
I had one match on xbox that im pretty sure had some cheaters in it. The very moment my game loaded in there was a notification that 2 different people had found the briefcase. Not even 1 full second into my play time. Coincidentally enough, the server disconnected about a minute after that. Thus is the only server disconnect ive experienced, so im not sure that it was actually a coincidence. 
---
Otherwise i agree with you! In having so much fun. Ive barely touched other BR games, so i dont have a lot to compare it to, but i am hooked. I have barely touched FO76 in the last month or more as i was getting bored with it. But i had yesterday and today off work and played almost the whole time. My main character got to level 10, and then i decided that this would be a great spot to level my alt as well, and i just reached level 10 with him as well. I have a bunch of wins now, and when i lose, it just makes me want to keep playing!
---
I'm 90% sure the placing junk thing was only referring to display cases (you put your junk in them to show them off), and not hand-placing junk around your camp. 
---
That being the situation, display cases were pushed back due to complications getting them 'just right'. Hopefully we'll see the best version of them some time during Nuclear Winter phase this summer.
---
Why so mad?
---
Long to rank up? I got 10 levels in a few hours. Lol
---
Don't be ashamed of your voice and if they don't like say duck you
---
Welcome to Appalachia
---
I'm a friendly player ( I think ) but I'm sick of hearing others talk about it. 
---
It seems you have people who are super evil and others who are nauseatingly nice.
---
Exactly! I've played about 30 minutes of Fortnite before this and that's all.  Having a blast here though
---
You should report it to bethesda
---
Am not to sure but the ones that open and shut maybe but the ones that don't like the barn set one would probably make there health go down maybe be am not to sure.
---
There is a lot of grinding required in the early game. You have to grind levels. The reason for this is that enemies scale to the highest Level Player in the area, which was fine when everyone was a low level but as you're late to the game, you have to grind levels in the forest or team up with higher level players to get anything done outside of the forest. Its not like the other Fallout Games where you can simply follow the quest, it's an MMO with a Fallout Skin
---
In most games u get something special if u were a beta tester
---
As one of the people who Alpha'ed we had some feedback that hasn't showed up yet..    
---
We suggested(oddly enough) nearly the same thing for weapons, auto assign first melee to 1, pistol to 2, rifle to 3, glad we weren't crazy...  
---
    
---
Also suggested the Chems auto-assign to specific slots and either to weakest to strongest or strongest to weakest so you didn't end up with 3 of effectively the same chem taking 3 slots.  
---
Half my deaths when playing the alpha occurred while I was trying to assign stuff to the favorites wheel
---
If you don't maybe you should consider searching for a new a career. In the same sense if you don't like the direction a game is heading, maybe find another game.
---
They are just icons to my understanding. They aren’t something you open
---
I had no issues
---
Yes. When i play with friends and we play like i mentioned above, we were winning 3 of 4 matches together. When im alone with random teammates, sometimes one of them has a mic on, i win more like 1 in 10.
---
Haha nice one
---
lol not sure if world of tanks and stuff like that count but I never played fortnight or a battle royal specific game before no.  what few videos of fortnight I saw never generated any interest for me and after playing this Battle royal mode I doubt I will any others. I am not understanding how people find fun in it beyond a few sessions to be honest. had the same issue with COD World of tanks etc. just short meaningless battles. I just dont get it.
---
That’s what happens when you rely on YouTube to tell you how to feel about a game.
---
Theres a few dead vault dwellers in the game
---
I do and I’ve never had that happen.
---
i’ve gotten like three of same one i’ll check it out when i get back on though
---
also great succeed for players, BE319-00102 here, for winning
---
Ah thankyou for letting me know
---
That's okay, he stole it too.
---
Hey man! I'm super low level, is there a post where I can see when you do these tours and how I can join them? I've got voice chat and been looking to get back into the game! Not sure when I'd be available though, thanks :)
---
GMT 0
---
Why so friendly ?
---
Time the beam so it ends up beaming into a post or something.  Jumping around in random directions helps a lot with melee NPCs.  
---
You need to change weapons.  Black Power Rifle is meant to be a 1-shot, 1-kill, weapon.  Without the Perks to back it, you'll get slaughtered.
---
Yep! You have to activate some of them in the Atom Shop which just seems silly.
---
It automatically pings enemies for you, they stay pinged until they're out of sight for like 8 seconds or something
---
Why?
---
and bethesda fallout 76 is most win!!
---
I just hope they are legit players and not banned players coming back because they haven’t learned their lesson. If some were banned but back to play for real this time, then welcome back.
---
succeed all time
---
/r/iamverybadass
---
I have 25, wanna run with me?
---
Get a use a mic.. or ya be left behind
---
Perk packs, just check your perk menu in your pip boy
---
Place it in your camp.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/buy-now for purchase and you will win always for eternal success
---
Was this on ps4? Just finished a match where we were on the ground and there was ppl on the bridge and we got the win. Just assumed they died. But maybe it was a tie
---
when you level up to rank 4 you get a crate thing though
---
RIGHT?!
---
that features honestly revolutionary
---
You revert to the vault suit, which you can take off manually and go naked. I imagine any Atom shop clothes that normally go underneath armor will stay on
---
Social, find your friend and select invite to team....then team leader takes you into play - nuclear winter
---
I’m down. Getting back on now, what’s your GT
---
i would love a tour. let me know when u start it up again. Are you on pc or ps4?
---
Wont really help given I don't want to be in a team and it seems like voice chat is fucked for me at least (ps4) I can have master and voice volumes at max and not hear people.
---
at the main menu go to social and invite them thru there make sure they are at the main menu as well and it says they are at the main menu next to there names
---
Sir, do you smell burnt toast!?
---
I agree. There’s a menu glitch where I can’t even join my friend’s team to rejoin as squad.
---
Melee will work.
---
Well dont use emotes cuz they give your location away to everyone
---
Try removing mods and resetting ini
---
You have to go to adventure mode. It’s a stash box.
---
Its last man standing. Respawn is terrible
---
BR was blast we fought and died and win together for all of win. i thank all fighters with us for success and, wish you all great wins for future winnings to the ending
---
I'm totally fine with that, too. All I wanna do is finish my Nuka Cola shrine and be absolutely not weird about it.
---
Curious to see how this works, I've already tried some unusual tactics like how to aim while falling. Surprisingly, your accuracy is still dead center, it's just your gun model blocks your view
---
I'm overseer rank 27 and my team only managed to pull it off 5 times so far. I've actually only seen 2 others besides the ones we launched,
---
ohhh thank you
---
I did it seems the codes are easy but the briefcase is very rare, found one off a body and launched one.
---
Correct but be aware that as soon as you find armor you get back in the vault suit.
---
Where can I find that in bulk?
---
Np. They should explain it better.
---
I just started on PS4 but I've yet to run into an empty world. Super nice group from what I've seen and based off those I've ran into so far.
---
included is comment to begin and end for future champions
---
They aren't JUST icons.  There are skins for power armor as well as stash boxes too.  You also get the Vault 51 jumpsuit to craft in adventure mode.  There's likely more, but I haven't seen the entire list.
---
All i ever here are people breathing into there mics
---
Power armor in nw is not the best makes you a big target and marine armor is probably the best type but that's my opinion and wood is the worst maybe scout armor is worse then power armor but honestly I don't know but again that's my opinion.
---
Ok so in fallout 4 the majority of enemies get scaled with your level. However in 76 levels of enemies are based on their location and some can scale up in levels. 
---
So either you are entering high level areas OR other higher level players are passing through locations you've been at and are scaling those enemies to their levels. The former is usually the case tho.
---
I tried one game of NW - saw the same old tired BR mechanics, closing circle of fire, choose where you spawn, grab something from the world to use, etc.  A BR is just a BR, this is a Fallout themed BR which might appeal to some Fallout fans.  I can see why the OP might like it more and find it easier - it doesn't have the harder to master gun mechanics and twitch skills of more advanced shooters like PUBG or CS:GO.  Fortnite might seem too childish to some, and PUBG far too hardcore, so NW is some sort of BR middle ground.
---
Or its changes and quickly changes back again.
---
I'd use the "Edgy Responder" flair if there was one
---
Interesting, that does seem common enough to be relevant once people are good at the game.
---
Badly nerfed two shot. But if you go for bloodied build as a glass cannon then you shred through anything. Anything Bloodied explosive or Anti armor explosive or even anything with 25% faster rate. Other than that the usual melee build with 8k damage while sneak attack.
---
There are TONS of people playing on PS4.  I don't know what bizzaro universe you got that assumption from.
---
I haven't found anywhere with more than a box or 2.
---
I know you use to be able to put them on the support beam thing then delete the beam. Idk if it still works however.
---
BR really brings out the competitiveness in people
---
Ooooh, that would make a lot of sense. I'd assume the logic being so you can actually tell when people have armor on.
---
You know, you’re right! I got so comfortable pushing a series of buttons that I put things on autopilot and really stopped actually playing the game. Now I'm back to making difficult decisions in difficult situations (deciding which perks to equip) and enjoying it so much more!
---
Is there a list somewhere of the rewards?
---
Only in your camp
---
Are you using VATS with 1 rank in targeting limbs?
---
Going further than that like enemy over there, loot here, gun here , need weapon etc
---
Ya and people will learn all of the possible briefcase spawns. That'll make a huge difference since there's an abundance of keycards already.
---
I can give you a bunch of water in a few days when I’ll be on. Add me Emart51
---
Keep your eyes open, your ears clear, and your buttcheeks clenched.
---
At. All. Times.
---
Are you on xbox1?
---
Which PA was the jetpack for?
---
This is what we call a mega-stroke.
---
Add me GT:Shearluck
---
Do the damage numbers popping out is not the damage dealt?
---
Very cool, I was wondering what the hell Braun was doing in 51, as opposed to 112, where I assume he is now.
---
Have you gotten off the game since it came out
---
They will shoot through the wooden shutters when open and any open doorway. But not the metal / barn / warehouse / brick windows.
---
Yeah I feel like this will be added or it should.
---
This is not fortnite. We do not need no "respawn ticket" the game is already fast paced enough to have people respawing all over the place.
---
So basically you need to go far out your way to do it and the only possible situation it happens is someone intentionally doing it to fuck other people over. Yup... Definitely counts as unstable...
---
There are a lot of good folk in Appalachia.
---
I have a higher-level main, but when I run out of caps at the vendors/scrip at the exchange machine, lately I've been tinkering around on a very low-level alt. My level 7 alt set up a camp at a remote spot on the western edge of the Forest and installed, just for the hell of it, a vendor. He didn't have much to vend other than a few hundred stray bullets he'd picked up, for a cap apiece.
---
But it wasn't five minutes after I hooked up the vending machine than a level 155 player fast-traveled over and bought every single piece of ammunition I'd put in that machine. I'm sure he or she didn't need it, and thought he or she was just being kind to a trial player...but I was grateful for the favor. The gesture really touched me.
---
Keep doing good deeds, people!
---
I think I’m going to wait on nukes until the newb week is over. Not enough high level players on servers to go after fissure prime.
---
How do the plans work in NW? If you get it in one does it last for the next? I've not even seen metal walls yet.
---
and br mode is best of the mode to become all
---
It finally worked on Fullscreen = 0 Thank you for reminding me of that!
---
never forget BR infinity
---
To bad no video. Sounds epic
---
Ok then.
---
Oh man you got ‘em
---
By leaving duffel bags of spoiled waste.
---
Is Reuben Gill the Vault 51 Overseer?
---
Ran into that twice today.
---
Then explain why r/Fallout, a subreddit that has been testing a new butthole in Fallout 76 since B.E.T.A, has suddenly turned around since the free trial and embrace the game.
---
If there is any sub that should be bashing the BR it should be that sub.
---
Power armor doesn't is not the best males you a big target and in my opinion marine has better armor but that's my opinion
---
I love that glitch. I think it's a event I do daily.
---
Oh alright when you're playing with friends and you get merk'd in the beginning guess you'll just sit there for 15-20 minutes watching then
---
External lives always thank you
---
You should stick to the forest region until level 20. Then venture north to the toxic valley till 30. Once there you can go to Welch till 40. Then move onto the middle of the map and over into the mire. At level fifty you can go into the cranberry bog. Unlike traditional fallout games where all enemies are scaled to you. This map is layout is where there are different areas for different difficulties. If your having trouble leveling up and collecting aid and junk I recommend claiming workshops. You gain a lot of experience for claiming and even more for defending. As well as the event rewards of junk aid and plans. There are workshops in all areas so no matter your level there will be multiple available.
---
I think the time is for people joining and for u to pick perks
---
Thats not what he means, ping like in APEX
---
Upvote for receivements
---
It's possible. You just won't be one shotting creatures.
---
Yes.
---
I know I’m around level 95 and I’ll get on do a couple things but I’ve kind of done and seen it all and it’s like ok now what? Nothing to do so what are people doing all the time to get this high level?
---
Not hating I legitimately would like to know so maybe I can get mentally invested again.
---
Maybe there was a nuke zone there before and it just faded out
---
It would be too large for people to traverse. If you’re in the Ash Heap and the zone goes to Toxic Valley, you’d be boned.
---
To bad ur on the Xbone. I have almost 300 stimpacks on ps4
---
Yep, you get sent there on a story mission. ENJOY!
---
Need more context.
---
I am click up all times
---
then it isn’t him, Gill’s body is on the ground in the forest region.
---
Nope. None of that matters. 
---
It never will. 
---
Fan outrage at an unreleased product!
---
Game company promises to do better! 
---
Fans tell them they will hold to account!
---
Oh look a new elder scrolls game.... Preordered!
---
And the cycle continues. 
---
Gamers have short memories and are notoriously weak willed slaves to the cult of the new.  For every one of you here that promises to not forgot.... There's 6584 others who won't even think twice. 
---
Game subs represent a microscopic sliver of the consumer base. If everyone held BGS to account and demanded better..... They could ignore you and ES6 will still be an obnoxious success.
---
I’m gonna guess this guy doesn’t like multiplayer
---
That's if team survives that long. And you don't have to wait. Have some patience
---
That's actually exactly what I did in the first place. I wish I would've fixed the crooked piece before the most recent update because I can't get it to work anymore :(
---
LOL its had its rough spots and they did deserve criticism but the media did go overboard on all the hate hype. I unsubscribed from several you tubers I used to trust in game reviews. I had maybe 10% of the issues they were ranting and all frothy mouthed about and I started immediately at first launch. I think they  force bugs and errors specifically to give themselves something to rant about.  just a feeling and I have nothing concrete to say for sure they do. it just seems odd that you tubers get them so often yet I rarely do.
---
Shower, food and a lil bit of sleep. NW is crack.
---
Lol you must be desperate. Too bad, I'm on ps4. I'd have tossed some stims and water your way and you could have kept your clothes on to lol
---
You can also use the showers
---
I remember my first beer.
---
Are they still bugged? they used the eat whole cores when you put them away
---
I havent been keep up with the patches
---
You tell them, I'm sure they'll change to exactly what you want now.
---
Lol. I got downvoted because reasons? Lol
---
Those level 5 wankers will do it every time.
---
My team mostly does. Feel bad whenever a friend dies and he sits there. "Have some patience" oh yeah I have to WAIT to play a video game how fun, I sure do enjoy WAITING for my friends to finish
---
I gotta win to get those sweet rewards my guy
---
I give stims to lower levels all the time. I remember how it was trying to get out of the forest..
---
When I jump on I might be considered " low level ", I'm lvl 123 lol, there's always people on at any given day or night.
---
Welcome to the entire game industry....
---
Not just BGS.
---
Agreed. Perhaps they could also make a duffel bag backpack skin to coincide?
---
I'm playing to unlock everything. But I always start and end on adventure mode
---
After what they did to my camp I can agree with you
---
This reminds me of /r/destinythegame. Heartwarming. &lt;3
---
Must be bored
---
I havent noticed that. I got kills when a teammate finished a down guy off
---
Just got off after a 4 hour play session.  Not a server issue in sight for me on ps4.
---
You're a pathetic mess
---
SURPRISE! You nuked the entire fucking Mire. Have fun
---
it wasn't an assumption i was on the ps4 version for 2 hours and saw no one..
---
Always people playing on PS4.. See you out there!
---
16 crashes in a row?
---
I call you have a shitty PC.
---
Stay in noobville until level 20+.
---
Someones butt hurt. Want a bottle?
---
maybe i had a bad world or something. i saw no one around me hmm
---
You in a match?
---
everything i had in adventure mode is still ok after trying nuclear winter, do not worry
---
I actually spent time punching other people than going through the terminals. I hope OP's post happen.
---
Believe in the servers then &lt;3
---

---
You can do it with a few people. I've got about 6 with me at the moment.
---
Bro you hit that awkward time when everyone leaves the server
---
Kind of wish this was a feature, it's loads more realistic and looks cool
---
Absolute slags the lot of em
---
Rifle gaming on YouTube has a video of him nuking himself lmao.
---
Wrong
---
You can redirect most things with junctions. Also, you can move those programs to the larger drive.
---
America here, get matched in 30 seconds or less usually
---
Ah, okay.  Thanks for sharing the info!
---

Cook-Cook, Driver Nephi, Violet, and Motor-Runner don't want your damn list.

In a match.
---
To unlock further into vault 51 you have to keep winning which sucks
---
I wouldn't say the game was bad, but it was definitely rushed and unfinished. I'm glad they're improving it, but I probably will wait at least until Wastelanders releases before I start playing it again.
---
How do you set down your camp?
---
no hacks with this time and besheshsda is win for each all to fight
---
We need a burning paper bag then :D
---
Now we gotta work on the phrase "might of."
---
Friend me and I’ll put you in the party.
---
It would be a token you could get from fighting a mob or something, not everyone has one like Apex. And sitting and waiting for your friends to finish isn't fun? Like sorry I got killed by a group of 2 and bled out before they could get me, now i have to wait 15 minutes while they win the game. Waiting isnt fun, I didnt buy video games to WAIT. Not every player should drop a banner or whatever, it should be an item you can find and use
---
Already did and to atrn_ra
---
Normally the game runs better than you described but it's not perfect.
---
Sounds more related to your set up. Not saying your rig is at all bad. Just some config problem.
---
I think in atom shop you can see them
---
im giving it a chance. since it did buy it off cdkeys fer 20$
---
on xbox digital store with the E3 sale discount its 30$ fer the basic edition.
---
its currently downloading.
---
[deleted]
---
please continue to purchase with all cards, cards are significant 2 all buys. play now and with friends to succeed others with friends. and all are welcome to the now besheshdda 76 fallout sir
---
I don't think I could take the constant punching noises.
---
[thumbs up emoji]
---
Didnt work, still kept moving really slow at spawn 😔
---
Nope not really, it only takes dropping itna couple times which I noticed when i dropped it the first time in the wrong place and then quickly moved it to the right place I wanted it. That is how I figured it out by complete accident. So no not "far out of my way".
---
UPDATE 2019 June 11th, This was Fixed!!!!!!!!!!!!! I haven't played in a while but logged in today and the tooltip and damage seem to be fixed,   📷

They tried, which is why fallout 3, 4, and 76 take place away from the West coast. But the old lore was too strict and didn't leave much room for new things. At some point they we're going to have to get into old lore to establish new stories along the timeline.
---
Good question.
---
Because where is the consequences for dying?. 
---
&gt; "If I die, I dont wanna be able to play again"
---
If you die, it's because you fucked up. Get better at the game and learn to stay alive.
---
You can just run in, die, then get respawned? lol
---
The real skill is staying alive, this is why Games like Pubg are still going strong.....no respawns, you mess up, you die, its on you.
---
Sure some are just slogging through it for unlocks and XP to level their low level characters faster but it seems like most are actually playing it cause they're having fun.
---
I still disagree. I like how this BR is different then the main stream ones. Using other games ideas takes away the individuality. It would just be another BR in the end
---
Visit player camps. Most have their purifiers unlocked.
---
It could be shared credit,   
---
It was suggested in the Alpha (if that's what it is) because we ran into issues where X did all the damage but Y ran up and executed them with melee and Y got the credit when X did all the work
---
win must win and, become master in time of all many times. BR mode is succeed in total
---
Pc and only takes dropping it a few times noticed it when I misplaced my build in the wrong position and moved it to the right position right after.
---
Is this what you hipster Reddit kids call a quality shit post?
---
I played through the entirety of the main quest solo. It’s definitely a bit more challenging I imagine than going in a group, but definitely doable. The game gets a lot easier once you start to really flesh out a build with the perk cards and get a home base set up with plenty of resources for crafting and repairing. Also, if you find that the enemy spawns in a particular area are way too high for you, try a server hop or two and the area’s level may adjust down. It may take a couple tries, but it does work. I’ve had to sever hop several times while I was going through the main quest because some quest areas had the enemies over 40 levels higher than I was at the time.
---
It's literally no different from PUBG or Blackout
---

---
I played 76 like crazy until I hit level 50 and it got boring but I’m a BR junkie and this made me fall in love with the game all over again.
---
Elaborate again
---
There are always the chance that blueberry can be god-tier.  Godberries are real.
---
Yeah I want to have a list of all of the known nuclear winter perk cards as of right now. i have a jumping one that gives me 3x jump but I'm curious as to how many other ones like that there are.
---
Name checks out.
---
&gt;same sys
---
It's really very annoying.  
---
I can SEE that people are talking.... but hear them? Nope. Grr.
---
To be fair, there were some game breaking bugs, and there still are a couple of them in there. But the game is still enjoyable despite them all and amazing fun
---
"Get better and learn to stay alive"
---
I drop 6+ kills a game, I've taken out squads by myself. Being killed as soon as I spawn isnt fun. Watching my friends play a game isnt fun.
---
I will when your IQ increases above the double digits
---
Open your pip boy in the lobby press triangle or Y and then press the touchpad? On the ps4 controller. Button callout should be at the bottom of the screen for whatever system ur on.
---
Idk for sure but I get that error when my internet is being super shitty like when the ps4 is downloading updates while we're streaming Hulu and I try to play 76.
---
Appreciate you my friend. Keep doing the good you are doing it is appreciated
---
Thank you Tulus
---
Gotcha.! Thanks alot for advice. I really needed it :)

Has there been a responder skin for PA? I saw a bot walking down the road and i was like damn... This guys stylin!
---
Sure thing!
---
I've got 300/300 and I'm the only one on my connection, so it's not my internet. That's what I thought it could be from the beginning but I've ruled that out.
---
I hope it's more along the lines of how we had the display stands (weapons, magazines,bobble heads, ect) and then certain pieces that can be placed (nuka-colas, alcohols, canned foods, plates, silverware, stuffed animals, cups/glasses. I don't see why we wouldn't be able to do it if the game remembers our Camps and how they are built have the junk included in our budget (though if that's the case hopefully either give slightly more budget.
---
I do not have any kind of silver or gold to give, but you have my gratitude and admiration
---
I'm level 55 and just built my first fancy camp as well. Always did the rustic sleeping bag and crafting stations. Finally decided to try out making something substantial and it was pretty fun!
---
What would you say the best way to get food is in fo76?
---
Added now sorry was in match
---
Placing camps give extra cards?
---
Lol. Ur the one thats not giving details. Guess you live up to ur name. You are a localretard
---
One of the challenges seems bugged so it’s repeatable and gives a new perk card every time. It can be completed before you come out of invisibility so it’s worth doing as soon as you load in
---
I get into a match in about 5 minutes from menu to final load screen. The weird thing is that the whole lobby is populated almost immediately, but I guess they give people time to explore and read the lore. That’s my best guess.
---
Cross platform isn’t going to happen, my frames are pretty good, and I think the crafting is fine. I feel the game has gone a long way and is still getting better with every update that comes.
---
Nothing personal against you but F*CK all people who hate on this game I mean Jesus Christ let people find out on their own and keep your own dam n opinion
---
Grabbing a low hanging fruit huh? Expected. Why the fuck do I have to elaborate on Blackout and PUBG being basically the same as this? Literally just fuckin look at it
---
Maybe if Wastelanders flops they'd shift focus away from PvE then but I don't see it happening otherwise. Even with NW being somewhat of a hit after release it still pales in comparison to the massive positive response they got from the Wastelanders reveal, with tons of people pledging to come back or buy the game for that.
---
Fix your audio
---
Both me and my friend have the same problem. The volume for voice is extremely low, i can barely hear people.
---
Framerate is the only one of these that's actually a valid issue lol
---
i was surprised when i loaded the game that it's missing a chat option. what online pc game doesn't include the option to chat with each other lol!
---
that's just one of my few huge issues with the game.
---
I think a lot of people reacted to it before they tried it and then never went back to change their reaction. (Now I'm thinking back to what reaction I gave it).
---
You can enter your username and password in your custom ini and it should keep you logged in all the time. You can find the exact format needed on the Nexus.
---
So is it still working this way or was it just my game? were X kills someone but Y finishes them and gets the kill?
---
Well I think I have my pass-thru backwards, then.  The two tubes, as you say, are outside on this setup and the stick-through conduit part is inside.  I'll have to try turning it around and see if I get a better and/or different result.
---
Stash huh? Il take it lol
---
I will when your IQ increases above double digits
---
I've had this happen seemingly for no reason in the middle of a session while playing the game. One moment I would be picking crops for crafting alcohol and then the notifications stop appearing. I'll have to keep an eye out if using a workbench to scrap junk/etc could be the cause of the issue.
---
Yea we’ll that is the r/fallout community for you
---
Well yeah, of course they did. I'm just pointing out how suddenly it flipped a 180 once it's no longer universal hatred for the game just because that's cool
---
Like the FNV mod that crucified Todd Howard?
---
Commit toaster bath
---
lol that’s just ridiculous!
---
Goto the atom shop and favorite it for nuclear winter works with some other outfits and skins also
---
&gt; sealing the stairwell that goes to the next level 
---
Sooo... 100 floors of "dungeons", a la Sword Art Online?
---
Have you invested in the Sneak ability cards?
---
Do you have Escape Artist yet? I don't remember when that unlocks. That helps immensely.
---
But do you understand the concept of a battle royale game?
---
To survive to the end.
---
Does not matter how many kills you get if you die........
---
Don't die early, its easy to avoid fights early on until you find a weapon (Which isn't hard, you will have a weapon within the first 30 seconds)
---
Again, if you die early, that's on you. It's because you tried to take someone on who is better than you (or stronger) or you fuck up. simple as that.
---
Watching your friends play is the punishment for being an idiot and dying early on.
---
Don't come crying about it on reddit because you cant stay alive lone enough.
---
Honestly @ E3 and it's killing me I can't play and tell you, just going by the Suggestions we made, hoping that's why it happened
---
The game is just so damn ugly and blurry man. Really hoped it got better after a year.
---
It's because the game hard lock region. Possibly for ping purpose. It doesn't have a timer cutout for when there are no people nearby. 
---
It should be in a way that once it reaches 30 secs or a min , the game you just force you into a lobby regardless of ping.
---
See if you can play when most people are, guessing about 10am NZ, that way it matches about 6pm est us I think.
---
Guess more players equals less time to start. 
---
I'm an ozzy &amp; wait times are similar to what you've seen some times, but not always
---
That’s crazy!!
---
Wouldn't it be more like you hear bad rumors about said chick and when you finally get drunk together and hang out at her place, she's into the same shit as you and cooks you breakfast in the morning?
---
it seems like all or nothing right now.
---
If you have the chat audio up max, you can hear them, but as soon as you change it, nothing.
---
Mandatory ada compliance? Got a link to information on that?
---
I’m indifferent.
---
Same, just started today and 3 kids in power armor camped me in survival. I look forward to doing the same
---
Go to your pip boy, then there should be a button. For me on PC it's Z, I can't remember if that's the default or not. You can move it as many times as you want without cost in nuclear winter
---
oh i see it now thank you!
---
I bought the game for a hundred dollars and honestly, if I compare it to other Bethesda titles it’s easy to see why there is so much conflict around this game.  Companies shouldn’t release games in the state this one was in and the business model of creating an online game with in game purchases has always felt a bit exploitative to me.  I think the criticism this game has received is valid but I’m glad Bethesda is addressing it.
---
Is there a difference?
---
I think they also unlock craftable stashes in the other modes
---
Commenting so hopefully we can get a dev to look at this bug.
---
Mine was loud as hell when I loaded into a lobby.
---
There have been a few times when I left people goodie bags and they just walked away. I used the gift emote and flashed my light, but no luck. But there are some who do take the gifts and that makes it worth it. Sharing is caring! :)
---
&gt;Being an idiot early on
---
Oh sorry that when I spawn in, 2 other guys look directly at me with a shotgun, blow my head off, and I have to wait, very cool. Forgot that's my fault the game loads like ass
---
I don't know. But it looks like at the very least there are some inconsistencies. Captainnoob tried it out on his stream and got very different numbers shooting the same enemy with the same weapon, and then different numbers again shooting an identical enemy with the same weapon
---
In New Zealand too, but I find that the time varies.
---
Huge difference, a ping can be done to anything without needing the map. For example in apex you press On a gun and itll say “x gun here” to all your teammates, double tap the same button and itll have a visual on the screen on the spot you saw an enemy saying “enemy here” and so forth
---
I'd start BR blowing out your custom INI settings that are using the overflow numbers (999999999) and loading the game and seeing what you get with a baseline INI, then add I slowly
---
Ironically, this sub was full of so much hate leading up to E3...
---
Flooded with anger about a possible Battle Royale mode, hoping Bethesda gets booed, and generally negative and pessimistic comments. I was actually kind of shocked tbh.
---
Welp, we are getting a Battle Royale, but also human NPCs and a more solid road map. I enjoy coming back to the wasteland when these new changes come in.
---
Also, /u/blastbug gave a great analogy.
---
I guess that would be helpful. I feel like people have already started doing that with emotes though.
---
You don't state what system you're on.
---
I have had two wins now. So, they have to be behind a rank. Just not sure what rank.
---
Does anyone else see a... nevermind.
---
You can do it solo by hitting whatever button it is on the game mode menu screen (says at the bottom - turn off team fill).
---
Your it for my first few rounds, was a blast.
---
They really should, the reward stream is nice beyond level 9 but very unintuitive for anybody new to the mode
---
Someone definitely has, because they used it on me. My team of 4 had descended the hills into Sutton Station and had wiped out a bunch of opponents; I had just greedily grabbed everything in one guy's duffel bag to distribute to my teammates when the nuke warning came out. Instead of dumping everything and running like a smart person would, I crawled my overencumbered ass towards the safe zone, chasing my teammates, but was the only one caught in the blast.
---
You are welcome now roam free young maxon
---
Waters easy, visit player vendors, most of their water purifiers are unlocked
---
I sometimes get infinite loading screens when getting into a nuclear winter match .
---
 Also got kicked 4 times tonight from normal adventure mode. I guess they are working on servers or something but damn it's annoying.
---
Just finished reading your post, great that you put it out there, I never thought a big gaming company would take feedback that directly, amazing
---
I'm a little chagrined that you don't get any points for an assist.
---
You can also get them insanely easy from a lot of rads
---
Guessing a lot will by the amount of posts on here by new players
---
My first Bethesda game was Fallout 3 LULW Good try though. I do like fallout 2 though. 
---
Found the BR kid.
---
That actually sounds like a very good system to have
---
You can also make diluted stimpaks in the chem workbench.
---
Level 10.  Got it yesterday.  Working my way through some base quests, hitting lower level events (Fertile Soil, Collision Course).  Enjoying it so far.  Tried to make my character look like Handsome Jack from Borderlands.
---
Download and play. It is free this week.
---
I'm on, Sertith IGN.
---
Had at least two or three guys over at wild Willie's water park in the toxic valley so  I would cripple the the scorched and let them finish them off melee finally got rid of a bunch of fucking drugs to.
---
Initially, I was hyped for this game. The idea that I'd be able to run around the wasteland with my friends was absolutely captivating for me. But as the game came closer and closer to release, I slowly became worried about not only this game, but the future of the franchise. And, as we all have seen, Bethesda has made some major mistakes not only with the game itself, but promises they made to fans (the bags, the helmets, the rum etc).  Upon playing the early access, all of my fears came to pass and more! The survival mechanics I'd loved in FO4 were now mandatory, there was a frankly annoying and confusing weapon crafting/leveling system, and the perk cards. God, how I hate the perk cards! I get they wanted us to be able to change our builds at the drop of a hat, but they could have done this more clearly and easily with a perk tree! They promised a single-player experience but having played through a reasonable chunk of the game, it's honestly a truly boring experience alone. Most enemies are bullet-spongey, or made of glass, with no in-between. The Scorched are just BORING to fight, and the Vaults are timed experience(last I checked at least). With no chat system, it's really hard to get people to join you in the first place without joining discord servers or some other out-of-game equivalent! I could go on, but I think to be laconic I'll just say: This game makes me VERY concerned about Bethesda's plans for the future of Fallout.
---
The weight of your equipped weapons and armor influence sneak too. Put away the fat man when sneaking.
---
Especially all the YouTubers who acted like it was one of the worst games in history. Angry Joe gave it, what, a 2 of 10? There was a lot of truth to his review, but at the same time his review was skewed. It featured video of *other people's bugs*, not just his own. Compiled together, it made the game look vastly worse than it was. Even minor graphical issues in some of the reviews were portrayed as near game breaking.
---
The game definitely had problems at launch, of that there is no doubt, but the way some of these videos were edited it made it look vastly worse than it is or was thanks to selective editing. Hell, quite a few of the videos didn't even touch on the common bugs players *were* experiencing. Problems were cherry picked or made to look far worse than they were.
---
People rode the "Fallout 76 sucks!" bandwagon for clicks and likes across the board.
---
:D
---
Tried tweaking your *.INI down to min settings?
---
Ah sweet, I will do so
---
I just got it helping a low level lol man I really appreciate it though
---
Gave it a shot, [here](https://i.imgur.com/F3ilWF2.jpg) it is
---
Sorry for taking a minute to respond, but the best way for lower level would be to claim the sunshine meadows industrial farm just west of flat woods. You can also do the Feed the people event in Morgantown, or the final option would be to invest in the Can Do perk card under luck. This allows you to search certain things for food such as trashcans, dumpsters, and lunchboxes. Just hit triangle (on ps4 not sure of other consoles) to search them. Once you get higher up you can run Watoga for canned dog food and run the good doggy perk card.
---
Oh good.
---
might want to mention what console my dude
---
Dude wtf, crash every time I fast travel to you.
---
I played some more today and all the talking I heard was about going out to Taco Bell and when people were raging :)
---
Windows 10.
---
Game performance was terrible at launch, and between the client and server crashes due to bugs and dupers the overall stability of the game was pretty bad at launch. Definitely didn't help the reputation.
---
But, if one has a headset you can just call out what's there? Odd times I dont use the headset I'm using the emot wheel to get my teammates to my location because I've found good loot. They get the idea
---
Possibly because the br mode requires a new character
---
Try using social to fast travel to me.
---
But should people choose finishing an enemy over downing the rest of an enemy team? If you down all of a team, they all die. The only time I can support finishing in a fight is when it’s long distance and they might be able to rez.
---
You can't really bring melee up to par with ranged without making the characters able to absorb more damage on approach and that just breaks the whole experience.
---
Melee has to be treated more like an extreme version of shotguns in games, high-risk high-reward, you have to use the environment and get close and then you do high damage. That's the only way to fit them into a shooter without making the guns feel weak and unfun.
---
In real battle, melee is a last resort, you would almost certainly be dead before reaching your target unless you're crafty. In most shooters, melee is strong but extremely difficult to pull off, and usually more of an extra insult to your target for defeating them that way.
---
I feel like a pig among guinea pigs
---
This has become a WITCHCEPTION!
---
I have this problem too.
---
Most of the emotes mean nothing in nuclear fallout and as we all know unfortunately most players dont have mics
---
You probably don't have much to worry about the game is being fixed new stuff being added and this is most likely a one time deal from what Bethesda has said
---
This isn't your game. It happens. I played this game months ago, and hated it. Now I started again, and I love it.
---
Thing is, they did fix many things. The problem you are having isn't something that can be fixed, because you don't enjoy the game.
---
Fo76 is NOT a fallout game I am sorry to say. If you try to play it like a fallout game you will hate it, always, don't matter what they fix. I mean I say this but I assume most fallout players play fallout for story and role playing right?
---
FO76 is a survival genre game. You have to look for weapons, food, water, build your house to survive type of game - if you like this, then you'll enjoy fo76
---
also, get chameleon or, at least, very light armor. :)
---
“It has not been fixed” what a load of shit. I’m glad I’m not a developer because the ingrates that have dogged this game have no clue what’s been put into this project.  Such a silly divided fan base of openminded people vs copycat Facebook posters. You know what I don’t like? The McRib. Some people think I’m crazy and some agree but I don’t go posting every chance I get about how I dislike it. It’s none of my business. I don’t like it so I leave it alone. Walk away. There’s been boatloads if improvements and fixes. You’re wrong. Sorry for the rant but ffs.
---
Melee is so damn fun legendary or not. I love sprinting up on someone and just slicing them to ribbons. A lot folks panic pretty hard
---
When did this start
---
It's a thing in all BR games
---
Been playing a ton the last 2 days without a disconnect.
---
I can't remember the last time I actually saw a nuked area.
---
The game was really bad at launch, but theyve been patching and expanding it to where it's actually pretty fun now.
---
Yup
---
perkloadout manager has been updated.
---
...
---
Impressive, actually.
---
Just make sure you don't spread your perk cards then when selecting a weapon type.  Choose one and stick with it.  For instance:  Dont take multiple cards in rifles, pistols, and heavy weapons.  You just want to pick one of those.
---
That;s all well and good, but it shows a slightly worrying trend in how bethesda releases games, choosing to release them in a broken buggy state and fixing them later, rather than taking the extra time to release them properly to begin with. I know that's not a new thing, they've been doing that for years, (with the launch of FNV being a really good example of this) but it really worries me that they sort of got away with the broken promises they made surrounding this game and how they'll treat Fallout in the future.
---
I’ve wondered about this so don’t kill me if it’s stupid, but does it change my camp in adventure mode?
---
Not sure what you mean by worried. Im talking about 100% atom bought stuff. I want cool hoodies or seeing cute stuff like pink miniskirts and tank tops or even bloody raider cloths. I'm a simple guy, I want to look like a dope killing machine and idc if i have to pay money for it
---
Sounds like a problem on your end.
---
Yesterday, with the NW patch.
---
This is a problem in every multiplayer game, and is not new to 76. Most playstations come with a shitty litter earpiece mic thing. It takes time to set it up so that your voice goes through the mic, and sound comes out of your favorite, non-gaming headphones or speakers.
---
Most people don’t feel like futzing with that. They just wanna blow stuff up or read terminals. I’m sure its similar on xbox, and probably worse on PC, where the damn thing does not come with a mic what-so-ever.
---
Also, I’d be willing to bet that a lot of the people that don’t get on their mics are either 
---
A: Women who don’t want to be harrassed by 14 year old boys
---
B: Kids under 12 whose parents won’t let them use the mic.
---
C: People in parties who are chatting with friends that refuse to play 76, because only kids and 50 year old neckbeards play that. (Literal thing a person said to me).
---
Solutions to this could be:
---
Change gaming communities to be less abusive to women (good fucking luck)
---
Require all players to require proof of age to play (good luck unless its the UK)
---
Provide a free, decent, plug and play headset with every console (good luck convincing sony or microsoft)
---
Until that happens, maybe 1/3 of the players I encounter use mic’s?
---
The thing about vat crit pistol is that with  furious/crit dmg/ vat cost, you can do sizable triple crits in one vat activation. Paires with AP regen gear, your enemy will get triple crit vat headshot every 3 seconds. It's not something you can just shrug off.
---
Multiple crit auto pistol build will eat your soul just as quickly as TSe shotgun does.
---
They are truly the lucky ones. I hate it AND I put so many hours into it. It had so much potential. I kept telling myself it would get better. Enough was enough though. Much like Battlefront 2. All for nothing.
---
I haven't seen one yet.  I've seen multiple posts asking that same question but no one has a full list yet.  I doubt anyone has made it to a high enough level to list it yet.
---
Tried to recreate Nate from Fallout 4, the one that was used in the marketing and E3 reveal for the game. What do you guys think?
---
&lt;sarcasm&gt;
---
Thanks, the FO76 sub has been pretty solid, I posted it on the Fallout sub and those guys are brutal.     
---
I was surprised as well, and really hoping that was a step in the right direction, hearing us...  
---
That said, there is an exploit in NW they were warned about during the Alpha but maybe didn't take seriously, which I think is funny, if nothing else it confirms that listening to the feedback is important.
---
I guess I should have put IMO there. sorry
---
Mild stroke. Nothing a stimpack and some rest won't fix.
---
Hopefully this goes in the same direction of ESO. Huge wave of positivity and this makes the creators more motivated to continue pumping quality content to the game. 
---
I just started the free trial and I love it so far. Will definitely buy it.
---
Hope Your Enjoying Your Day
---
Bethesda didn’t do FNV
---
We can only speculate, but i have a feeling she will be a very central part of Wastelanders as a whole.
---
Yep. I played survival a couple times. Couldn't care less. Doesn't feel like good gameplay, not really rewards for playing.
---
But nuclear winter. I see it as something I'll keep playing for fun, even after I've collected the rewards.
---
Apparently the whole world wants Battle Royales and I'm just old or confused. 😶
---
As I understand it, they've got teams working on different aspects of the game at the same time, I'm not saying it couldn't happen, but right now we are solid.

Also you can’t always account for bugs in internal testing. Sometimes bugs can only be found in the wild. As someone who used to help test games I can see that first hand as bugs didn’t appear until the updates came out. Bethesda has been fixing the bugs as best and as fast as they can. They are doing their best and I think they have been doing a great job.
---
Something something, low skill barrier, maps that you know pretty well, and executed fairly good for being a beta.
---
They do...

r/failedcomment
---
Not so much directed at you so I’m sorry but I’m just tired of the hate. I like this game. It’s not perfect, but it’s fun and I’ve got more than my money’s worth out of it since December.
---
No it doesn’t. They’re not linked together. Please upvote main page if it helps. It’s at 0, so someone is trying to keep this information from people. Just create blueprint. You can even blueprint your CAMP and take your whole CAMP minus a few defenses into NW.
---
Please tell me you didn't think NV was a Bethesda game
---
It will stay where it was in adventure.
---
Most of the reviews were super clickbaity.  That's why I made my decision to buy it at launch based on gameplay videos that demonstrated that the content creator actually tried to experience this game before condemning it.  I figure that any reviewer worth their salt should want to demonstrate what they like or dislike about the game and should have the appropriate equipment/software to do so.  Furthermore, they should be able to include several minutes of legitimate, personal gameplay and not just several clips from outside the vault or Flatwoods that are only a few seconds long.
---
This is pretty fun actually. One thing I’m craving though is combat. I just got the game a few hours ago so obviously I’m just starting but some more combat would be enjoyabke
---
Because it does suck. Completely dated and terrible gameplay/graphics that do not translate well to PvP scenarios at all. A completely boring story that is ultimately one long fetch quest. The scorched are such a lame enemy to fight and scorch beasts are a total headache to try and fight, especially for melee builds. I liked the game when it came out, too, but it’s total shit, you’ll see
---
Obsidian did, IK, but Bethesda was the one who said, "Hey you've got 18 months, make a fallout game." And to my knowledge, they are the ones who handled the bug fixes though I might be wrong about that one.
---
This was something they've been working on since before launch, it's part of the reason it's so polished and clean (there are some bugs of course)
---
Yea dont worry, the fallout sub typically is people who cant let go of new vegas and fallout 2 and just constantly bash 76 for some reason, kind of weird that they 24/7 discuss a game they hate so much but thats the world haha, keep up the good work with the bug finding!
---
I need a 10 hour long bass boosted version asap.
---
Personally I’ve started playing again after 5-6 months because of all the cool stuff they’ve added and will be adding, it’s going in a great direction!
---
Yep! It's that simple.
---
“No characters to get attached to” they said. 
---
The real characters were the players we met along the way.
---
What broken promise did they make with 76?
---
Spot on!
---
It’s because so many people are doing the free trial that serves are having a hard time handling it. Give it a few days and everything will return to normal occasional crashes.
---
I know Obsidian made it, but it belongs to Bethesda. It's also my favorite game in the series with over 3000 hours.
---
I can't wait to give it a second go! Currently downloading
---
Just wondering if OP still has the original or an extra code to give. Kind of late to this post but if you do I would appreciate it a lot if you would let me have the code. I am a big Fallout fan and have played the majority of the games and to be honest I am looking under the sofa cushions for loose change because I'm barely scraping by so if you could let me have it I would be forever grateful. Thank you.
---
Thanks and you nailed them quickly!
---
Yeah I just chuck them here on reddit so more people can have the codes because not everyone knows about the site
---
I wanted to ask about that. I played for an hour or two tonight and had two hard crashes. I’m not even sure if the food plant event finished bc it crashed at the end. If it’s this unstable, I don’t think I’ll be able to play it even though I am enjoying it right now.
---
Same! I don't know if this is Inon Zur or not, but they nailed the feelings the inagery evokes when I login and see that fire spreading.
---
I feel ya that's basically what I commented earlier
---
They are Free! 
---
I love brown and yellow.
---
I would normally say, it depends on what you like. But seeing as though they are covering everything for everyone, and even NPC DLC will add alot of storyline that felt a little missing.
---
With how cheap the game is. Yes, definitely.
---
I've got that friends list, when I open it my client freezes for 4 to 15 seconds, really sucks when I accidently open it in combat
---
Alts don't fix it :(
---
We know, it gets posted at least once a day.
---
Ok knock on wood I think I fixed it I try validated my files and it works for me now
---
SYNTH! KILL IT!
---
The canvas bags, the helmets, the Nuka rum, and straight off the TVtropes page, "there will be dedicated private servers for single-player games that will become available some time after launch" but I accept that that one likely won't be ready for a while.
---
Damn all these dudes on console.. feel like an outcast here on pc, dang lmao
---
Does your character carry them into the next game. Otherwise it seems like class freak is kind of useless
---
I'm a complete and utter jerk. I aggro mobs of Ghouls and kite them to new players, I also watch as they die instead of giving stimpaks. In between random chaos I go skipping along the roads whipping frag grenades in random directions. Teabags be upon you. ;)  
---
This make you feel better?
---
I've gotten the first confirmation reply, and the second reply back in like January saying the Atoms have been awarded and to wait for an update on the bag production, but nothing since.
---
Plus in Angry Joe's review I recall the one guy stating he got to level 100+ in his videos. That's a hell of a lot of gameplay for somebody who hates the game. Why would you sink that much time into a game only to go "Nope, it sucks!"
---
It'd take most people 10-20 hours of really playing a game to make that call on a game, but it takes about an hour per level in Fallout 76, maybe a little less, so that's... what, let's say a least 75 hours of gameplay. At least. And you play a game that long only to have completely negative experiences? You don't need to do every quest in a game to do a review.
---
There was just a lot I felt like "Something about this story doesn't sit well with me."
---
So what about this video showing a brand new account passing items and getting banned for it.
---

---
If you ever do manage to give feedback again, the biggest thing that would help the mode is either better ping system or a faster way at changing weapons, even if its only between two selected ones
---
People overreacted. It has improved a lot in terms of stability, but it's been consistently enjoyable.
---
Anti-battle royale players discover battle royale games are fun, find out where circlejerking gets you at 11
---
I have experienced this rather nice glitch on a BPR and a Harpoon Gun.
---
They went back to normal after the imaginary magazine was depleted.
---
Like PvE or PvP?
---
I try to at least keep the punching confined to the boxing ring. Otherwise what's the point of the thing?
---
Actually yes. I will do this now as well. Any idea how far the mobs will chase you?
---
I think I got PA paint at 16, next cool thing is laser rifle paint at 21
---
Not born yet
---
Well good. I don't know how these things work so I can only assume.
---
I didn't like how using VATS to shoot is in real time now and I got bored not really knowing what to do so if they're adding a storyline I'd like that.
---
THIS is why I jive FO76. The community is so friendly, even if they don’t know it. Looking at other games like Fortnite, which I have grown to dislike, this game is so amazing compared to it. The team working on the game actually cares about its player base and not just money! (*cough cough epic*)
---
Yeah, my experience with the scopes has only been terrible
---
May MAY be useful at the end of the game in a niche scenario, but mostly... trash
---
I have maybe an hour to play tonight and I can’t get past the Bethesda account creator because it refuses to recognize my email is an email
---
You get your rewards immediately. There's nothing additional to claim, unless you count the holotapes you can pick up around vault 51 once you reach certain levels
---
Posters at train stations
---
Lvl 35. OP is not quite there yet.
---
I played with the same people since beta (and one since alpha)... playing without them sounds sad :(
---
I keep seeing people mention a ping system, drawing a complete blank..  
---
Agree on faster weapons, I wanted / suggested the melee / pistol / rifle for the first 3, and if you kept hitting the "x" hotkey it would cycle through the weapons of that class.   
---
Hit 2, 10mm, hit it again .44, hit it again and the single action pops up, etc
---
Hey bro. Need to talk it out?
---
What are your PC specs? Because I've got a GeForce 1050Ti with an Intel core i5 7500HQ with 8 GB of RAM and I have to play on the lowest settings and I still get some lag (not spikes)
---
i feel i would run through all that .308 and those shotgun shells in one sitting
---
farm them at the Morgantown airport.
---
Okay, so. Servers “will be available some time after launch” they did say it could be about a year before they came. The rum? People just don’t read or inspect what they see, the bottle I could tell wasn’t a real bottle, also that wasn’t them that was the people that made it, Bethesda just gave the rights to the company to produce the run. it’s a collectors item like the Quantum soda made by Jones. The bags? Things happen sometimes things can get expensive and items have to change, was it wrong not to say they would? Yeah sure but that doesn’t take away from the game itself. The helmets I’ve seen, they look good what’s wrong with them? They are collectors items, things to display. The only broken promise I see is the bags and i didn’t care much about them because I didn’t get one and I was to busy having fun in game. The game is being worked on and being fixed and HAS be fixed since launch.
---
Reddit's really gonna kill this meme pretty quick
---
Try putting a flamer mod on the plasma
---
Its something that apex reintroduced and fortnite copied as well, a ping can be done to anything without needing the map. For example in apex you press On a gun and itll say “x gun here” to all your teammates with an icon showing on screen, double tap the same button and itll have a visual on the screen on the spot you saw an enemy saying “enemy here” and so forth.
---
It makes it so that you dont need a mic to properly communicate, which I feel is a problem in this mode
---
Yes. Happening a lot in Adventure mode.
---
PvE
---
Odd. Then again sneaking has never worked for me either, even with stealth boys but I just thought it was the lack of ability cards.
---
The flamer mod only changes the projectile it shoots, it doesn't set enemies on fire. That's the beta wave tuner receiver
---
[I only know because a few of the community got to visit the Dallas office and do some Q&amp;A and Playtesting](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/byrtju/bethesda_hears_us_i_know_because_being_an/).  
---
One off, but hoping they do it again.
---
Also the mode is really fun, just since its the beta for it, I feel suggestions are good to put out there
---
You sure he isn't just fast travelling?
---
Ask again when wastelanders comes out
---
15 for raider armor. Can find it in a couple places.
---
He was born, just frozen.
---
Sadly no, not in any meaning of the sentence. You can't see anything beyond the 4 it shows you in the end-game menu, you can't see what you have already earned, and there isn't an indicator of where to find it. But the early rewards are all player icons, perk card packs, photo frames, camp items, and starting from rank 11 weapon/power armor skins
---
Don't worry, there'll be plenty of it once you start making your way out of flatwoods.
---
Not sure if its a glitch, but enemies won't stop chasing me. Had a sheepsquatch chase me halfway across the map. I imagine if you hang back and jog they should keep up. ;)
---
Your comment made me lmao haha
---
Ahhhhh well damn that makes allot of sense.  
---
I assume it drops a marker in the compass?
---
Making survival like Rust would solve everything :)
---
As a new player who just picked up the game a few days ago. Thank you!!
---
Huh, you know, the whole point of this post was to have a constructive conversation about the game and the perceived issues I had with it, but it's all become a mess. LOL
---
Don't be too surprised when they do. This sets a precedent. We shall soon see.
---
It shows up on the compas yea. Thats another thing though, its weird they didnt add a minimap to the mode
---
Thank you for telling me that
---
You have to add them to team before you select the game mode. Maybe another way but only one I've found that works
---
one of the random noobs here! Trying the game out for the week! If anyone wants to team up on PC please let me know! I have no idea what im doing on here. lol
---
I think it just checks if you have a point available to spend, not if youve actually levelled up
---
There is a guy named Preston looking for you, said something about a settlement needing help. He said he'd be back in 5 minutes.
---
Just saying, it's V different from fork knife/pubg and is really enjoyable if you're looking for a bit more challenging gameplay...
---
I know that sounds sarcastic it isn’t though
---
Yes lots of positivity! But as you said, twitter and Facebook post are just hundreds of typical hate comments by people who never played the game
---
Before you join NW you will need to form a team.  Hold start to bring up your social tab and then add them to your team.  Then you can join in on NW together.
---
Is that even a thing?
---
I have no option to add him to my team. I tried being a team in adventure mode, but when he left the server and entered Nuclear Winter, I couldn't join him.
---
edgy stuff
---
You both must be at the main menu. Then you can Invite him you your team. Once in a team both of you will select play with team and then on the NW game mode. It will load you into the same lobby and put you on a team. It’s best to communicate through discord or some other party chat as that is unavailable while on the main menu.
---
There's no option to invite him to my team.
---
Like it's a review, so it's... an opinion... you seem incredibly passionate about proposing that other people have opinions *while* tearing me down for having an opinion. So my question is, are you for or against the concept of opinions. Give me your opinion if you're pro or an objective arguement if youre against.
---
Angry Joe is an obnoxious twat tho. Surely this is a factor.
---
👍🏻
---
Flatwoods church has a few typewriters and fans that spawn, there's frequently a couple boxes of loose screws inside the fertilizer plant down the road too. Otherwise, shop C.A.M.P.s with a large number of junk on their map icon.
---
Did you even fo4 brah? XD
---
FYI - Brotherhood Recon Rifle can be made as lv1/5/10 etc and I've been giving those out to the newbies. It comes with great mods too, like a suppressor and recon scope to boot!
---
I’ve had good luck with scopes a few occasions. I win my first match with a scoped laser rifle.
---
Yeah, but people take his reviews like litany for some reason. Back in the day, his review was often cited as one of the biggest reasons people didn't give Elder Scrolls Online a chance.
---
I saw your reply.  I don't think you're doing something right.  Post a picture of what it shows when you press X on your friend's name in the social list.
---
they also say New Vegas is good so true opinion is invalid
---
kind of /s but also not /s
---
In Nuclear Winter? I’m cornfused.
---
Okay then talk about the game, not about things outside the game like bags and people who can’t see a bottle isn’t real. We are here about THE GAME. As I said in my first comment the game has come a long way from the launch, it has been fixed. Games are not an easy thing to make and fix bugs are not always caught or even a thing until updates and content are in the wild. Your comment to this was about how there were broken promises and how the game hasn’t changed since launch. That Bethesda chooses to have it with bugs and problems. Honestly I doubt they want bugs and problems, a lot of them have been fixed since launch.
---
I find it useful when im outside of a battle. I can usually pick off a few before they stim. Then i can lay enough cover fire to prevent their team from revive them. Other than that, full auto. Handmade or 50 cal.
---
Been soloing it, but not a fan of voice chat. each have their perks.
---
This might be a bit lengthy but I'll give all my experience. I'm not pushing for anyone to get it.    
---
I've been a fan since I found Fallout 3 GOTY edition at Wal-Mart for PC years ago.    
---
I was highly skeptical even though a lot of things about 76 are really good.    
---
1. The map is very big and you don't run into large groups.    
---
2. You can solo 99.99% of the main quest alone. Depending on gear, perk load out, your level, and persona kill you progress at your own pace. I still have not completed the last part where you do X.    
---
3. You do not need to spend real money to get Atoms. Playing the game you can get at least 3000 without really trying. Eventually, repeatable are largely what you have to do to get more.  
---
4. For the most part, the game guides you where you need to go and what to do. Look all around you as 'places and things' aren't as easily seen.
---
5. Use the Nukes and Dragons website to plan your perk cards at least up to level 20. Don't spread yourself too thin.    
---
6. Your personal weight seems large at first. Don't hoard. 
---
7. Item condition is a thing I don't like. The higher the level of an item the longer the 'bar' is.
---
8. The maps in every train station have push pins. Move your cursor over them and 'use' it will put that location on your map. You cannot travel to it b/c you haven't been there but it's marked. Free travel points!!    
---
9. Vary time with questing and hunting down 'stuff'.  
---
10. Build a basic CAMP. Don't worry about making it big and fancy. That takes time.    
---
A 4 x4 building with a roof. Door. Bed. Stash.    
---
Concerning crafting, build a Cooking and Tinkerer bench asap. Cook raw food asap. Food items that do not have a condition bar don't degrade. IMO, best to keep 95% of it in storage.    
---
If you would like any more helpful hints let me know.
---
Yeah, I reckon that’s true, mostly just been fighting ticks and stuff so far. I did have a run in with the new scorched faction which was pretty cool. I accidentally touched one of the frozen bodies and got a ton of rads from it haha
---
What's wrong with the quick switch button?  I know on ps4 you can cycle between your last 2 used weapons using the left dpad button which works fine for me.
---
I dont mind the disconnects,  because i like to server hop.
---
When the electrician turns my power back on I will have a few games.
---
No they don’t stay into the next game - class freak seems pointless to me too
---
At 12 we get a statue we can build that looks kinda like that small power armor one but it’s a pip boy holding the severed head of another pip boy and it’s honestly my favorite thing ever. 😂
---
I think I saw him at the whitesprings, he said something about playing with Mr and Mrs Robot
---
Yeah but why would you
---
It's such an underused and underrated part of the game right now. My team got creative and built some real nasty forts that put us at a huge advantage in the final minutes. Love how it keep you safe from npcs too. Not scorched beast tho...
---
but you do have to acknowledge that there were problems with the game at launch.  what you're saying makes it seem like people were bashing a perfect game for no reason.
---
I wonder if the damage reflect on mine is affected by the Anti-Armor portion, so it reflects more damage back because of armor pen?
---
There's quite a few vault dwellers. They come from I think vault 94 (the one in the mire region.) They left their vault early but after an incident that destroyed half the mire and caused the stranglers to be spread around they locked themselves back in.
---
Nope, not actually getting disconnected, just sometimes get that disconnected part when playing nuclear winter
---
But.... but i like my seemingly innocent but inter-Expanding dimentional paper bag!
---
I thought it would be terrible, however, it is oddly fun for some reason. I really like how you can use it to level up your adventure mode character.
---
Apex has a respawn system that works fine. And it takes away the annoyance that op stated of potentially watching your friends for the next 15 minutes instead of playing. The consequence for death is your team is down a man, and a respawn isnt guaranteed
---
Fair enough. I see where you're coming from on this one. Thanks.
---
Dude I wish I could have met you when I started, I'm currently level 19 and still struggling to get by.
---
Understand this compleatly. More of an advantage than having power armor.
---
Exactly what depth does an NOC really have oh 4 different branches what happens when that is over. FO76 provides infinite possibility’s if people were not so anti social
---
To get high ground.
---
I mean, there like are like, what, 13 mutations. And serums are extremely rare and standing near rad to farm specific mutation is not possible. 
---
That guy won the lottery. Give it to him.
---
Not yet - might search some posts and see what people have - I am rank 8 and I know for sure I’ve unlocked four player icons (three that look like loot boxes and one that’s a mega sloth) and a stash box skin
---
Or, just play the game as it was written.  Smh
---
Maybe it's because your muscles are twisted
---
It is viable. Not without its quirks but is widely used.
---
Is a 'free' 2x multiplier before 'augmenting' perk cards, a rather tempting proposition for many myself included.
---
Get someone to craft you The Fixer, is a competent levelling weapon that would help with your predicament.
---
If you have the storage to spare just get the lvl 20/30/40/50 ones.
---
Stick to the shadows, you are a bit of a way away from the point where you can walk up to a supermutant in broad daylight and go 'in your face!'
---
Due to a long standing bug if someone/something is engaged in combat with your target and in melee range you will lose your sneak attack bonus. This can be a hideous thing but the devs are not in a rush to fix it.
---
Until you get Escape Artist you are going to be severely crippled. Remember that you need to 'walk' not 'run' while crouched or every step you take will be like if you had wind chimes hanging from your arse.
---
You will also drop from 'hidden' to 'danger' in a second flat for no apparent reason. Another long standing bug that is screaming 'fix me'. Silver lining, these days it clears by itself after some unknown conditions are met, no need to server hop to get rid of it.
---
Wood armor is your friend for now. If you have done the relevant quest you should be able to make it shrouded which will help further.
---
Persevere, it gets better.
---
Option to hide backpacks because I want to just wear my tuxedo please
---
The moonshine mask was a limited item during the fasnacht event and will most likely return when fasnacht does
---
Ya in br
---
Try gaining some xp from something in AM?
---
No it was in br he went from suton to the lodges in secounds
---
Nothing follows from one game to the next.
---
You really need flesh you posts out more  **borderlands-esque** could mean literally any part of borderlands i think you mean to say instanced and limited to 4 players which i don't think will happen outside of a couple of "raids" as the whole game is kinda built around the idea of random interaction and workshops and the rest of it.
---
Also what is  "**Wastelanders mode"** do you mean the nuclear winter match of the wastelanders update with the npcs and other content.
---
Yes it still works that way - I shot and downed a guy and my random teammate came and one tapped him and got the credit for the kill and I only got credit for a down
---
Thanks. I've been avoiding this solution to date due to the account security implications but I may have to give it a go unless the issue is patched soon.
---
That's a great idea too. :)
---
I don’t have a problem when respawning, but only when fast traveling to a teammate or team camp.
---
I think that we will most likely be able to enter the vault to have a look around once it’s fully released
---
Get some more patience then.  Meditate or something.
---
Just thought of that - hopefully find a couple turrets in the world however I noticed that a friend’s turrets were hostile to us - I don’t think it shot at us but it was definitely red
---
No, its not a bug.
---
I can see where the free trial = free 7 day duper mule accounts.  If more people are starting to play you can bet the dupers are rubbing their hands at all the possible new customers.
---
It’s not bad at all and I will never understand content creators that say this game is unplayable and “dead”.
---
Yes, at one point during the release of this game, it had numerous bugs causing lots of frustration in the fallout community (not saying this game is in a perfect state) but for the most part, majority of the hate that this game was getting was people just jumping on the hate bandwagon.
---
There are a lot of people out there that like to run some quality of life mods that just make the game a little better, so why not make it a little easier for them to enjoy both aspects of the game.
---
PC and doesn’t work either :/
---
It's a perk, frog legs. It takes up a massive chunk of your agility, and you can't control it. Definitely screws up any chance of stealth gameplay when you're trying to jump over some rocks and end up 10 feet in the air for everybody in the area to see. It's balanced, I would even say underpowered
---
On PC, thanks for the the reminder.
---
Wastelanders isn't going to be a new mode, it's an game changing huge update.
---
Same.
---
Silly question most likely, however not played the NW much yet - how do you place your camp? Do you need it to be pre-build or just dropping the C.A.M.P. kit down?
---
A lot of people don’t get it. Had one of my team wandering the whole damn game with no armor and I kept signalling boxes and the come here emote and shit and he did not compute
---
XD sorry to say but I actually have a perk that lets me jump 300% higher its called Frog Legs
---
Ok my gt is HomerSimpson428, message me when you wanna play. Do you have a mic?
---
Sorry, as others have mentioned. A lot has been fixed and I too am tired for the game getting all this hate for things OUTSIDE the game. Fuck bags, fuck rum, fuck the collectors items. The game itself has changed a lot since launch and has gone a long way. You may not like it because it isn’t the traditional fallout game but so far I’ve loved it since launch and I’ve been playing a lot more with these player made shops. The Battleroyal mode has become my most played thing this week because for a pre beta it’s pretty well made and fun, only bug I’ve experienced with it has been my friend getting stuck in power armor as he tried to revive me, and that happened once. Bethesda has been doing a fantastic job on catching and fixing bugs.
---
I'm not new to the game; however I have been enjoying the new people.  I was in survival yesterday server hopping around green country lodge trying to milk a Brahmin for the weekly legendary weapon, and I kept getting a bunch of low level people following me and shooting at me.  It was barely doing any damage; and I already figured that would happen, so I wasn't doing anything but I did have to mess with one of them, he was a level 8 and after I finally found a Brahmin that I was able to milk, I chased him into a building had him cornered then dropped a full set of lvl 10 1* legendary leather armor set gave him a thumbs up and ran away.
---
Wait, how would you know where he went if you're in Nuclear Winter?
---
Because saying the game wasn't that bad resulted in you being harassed, it eventually got you tons of clicks and traffic to join in on the hate mongering. 
---
Eventually people shut up and let them hate on it until they moved on. Now things are turning around and hopefully we get some updated reviews.
---
Just need to drop the kit down, not build anything
---
The building is nice. Designate 1 builder. If a fight breaks out his CAMP should be going down immediately and a blueprint as well. Enemy in later weeks will be doing the same and if you’re too close you can’t build a CAMP, so sipped is essential.
---
_every_ five minutes
---
It doesnt, I logged on and used my character I've had since launch.
---
*Mutie purging intensifies*
---
These posts are starting to make me puke. Just pat yourself on the back and tell yourself *I'm awesome*.
---
My money's on a massive server edit/update like WoW Cataclysm was.
---
Not really. I played Pubg, Apex, and Fortnite. I didnt like any of them. Battle royal games arent inherently fun, this is one is though.
---
Any idea what rank you'll get that knight helmet? That's the main thing I'm looking forward to.
---
Oh I read it wrong, didn’t know that thanks
---
If you REALLY wanted accuracy... destroyed building models need to be added to the game. The white spring doesn’t even have the windows blown out or the paint chipped. I know the camps get destroyed wall variants... but still.  
---
But then you’d essentially have to have two versions of every building texture and model in the game... you know how people love to complain about patch sizes. “This game sucks, but could it please download faster”. Lol.
---
As an aside, if you want a game where players get to drop nukes... you need a game engine with destructible objects. That’d be my top request for Fallout 5, or any future multiplayer fallout for that matter.
---
22 has a laser rifle skin, 24 is the silver NW statue
---
I agree with you, they should make a kind of data base of what we sold during the day
---
Is it just me or does it feel like the ring of fire isn’t as destructive as it should be? Just won my first match and the last team survived for 3-4 minutes out in the storm trying to spam grenades on us. I’m unsure if they used some special armor or just a kajillion stimpaks (Im sure it’s the latter of the two) but it felt a little unfair. Maybe if the storm gradually became more unforgiving as the match went on? Does it already do that? 
---
Also when hacking terminals, it’d be a pretty cool advantage to highlight where the nuclear briefcase is! I’m unsure if it’s too OP or not, but it feels like it’d make turning on the hacker perk in the beginning of matches so much more useful. (Not that it already isn’t, if you haven’t hack into a NW terminal and you’ll be surprised by the badass things the game lets you do!)
---
yes I, the BR kid, am fully aware of the concepts of me becoming a pornstar in Fallout 2 and blowing up the Enclave Oil Rig. Good try though.
---
They just need a hardmode for PVE. Really hard, challenging survival mechanics, with a good reward structure for skilled solo play and grouping up.
---
Marsupial doesnt drop in NW battle royal. Lmao.
---
These posts need to be deleted.
---
"This game is awesome posts"
---
"I helped a newbie posts"
---
"Bethesda please..."
---
" This game sucked but my post content is the total opposite I fooled you all haha posts"
---
I like how frantic and hit or miss it is.  My first game, I found a pipe automatic and a scoped magnum before I was killed about 3 minutes in, probably the second or third death of the match.
---
My second game, I got paired with a bunch of shrewd players, found an automatic combat rifle, a submachine gun, and a grenade launcher.  We survived by spawning into a relatively middlin' area where enemies were unlikely to also spawn, scavenged Flatwoods while skirting the edge of the firestorms, and made a single final stand.  I started by noob-tubing blindly in the enemy's general direction then pulled out my submachine gun and landed only a couple of hits before I was downed.  My teammates did most of the clean-up, but were nice enough to revive me to land the killing blow.  It probably also helped that that final enemy was too distracted by my second teammate to notice the first reviving me.
---
Long story short, just keep trying.  Communication can help a ton, but is not absolutely necessary to win.  Even players who usually shrink away from PvP can taste victory and Nuclear Winter means you can do it without the risk of losing aid and junk.
---
Was wondering the same thing
---
I have a Zealot's gatling and, beleive me, it make the SBQ notice me instantly.  I can watch the health drop (a little at a time) and the SBQ is staggered when she's flying.  I'll have to see what's going on next time in regards to damage per shot.
---
He's dead I killed him because he was a whiny biatch.
---
U could see a guy flash as he went from across the screen like sonic
---
Yup it’s a bug with heal being the same keybind as exiting your PA.
---
Seeing a flash on the screen doesn't exactly tell you where he went, or prove that he's hacking.
---
The unlocks from my understanding or not character specific because their atomic store items. For example the chair you for example the chair you unlock at level 10 I was able to put in all of my characters camps but I've only played NW with one character.
---
Tons of them. I'm avoiding that area of the map this week. 
---
#SOLO FOR LIFE!
---
This
---
Yea I've got a mic.
---
At level 16 is another stash box. The large orange one is somewhere in the twenties I do believe.
---
I've have played this game long enough to know he was hacking there's no way he could move that fast he was going faster then a fat man shot would go
---
I just saw the laser rifle skin on my upcoming Rewards oh, pretty awesome about the silver statue only being at 24. The bronze one is a bit dark and hard to see
---
Its honestly kinda unique the way they presented it
---
How did you know where he went?
---
I haven't really used VATS
---
Just started the game. Got knocked off the server a couple times. It was so strange to have another player on voice while I was in character creation. I didn't get his PSNID. Another guy named Sneeze tried to give me a power armor chassis but it froze my game. But that was after a duplication glitch doubled his power armor pieces. I still have the chassis. I got my water lesson during a kill the farmer event, and played some Battle Royale. This game would be awesome if it weren't so glitchy and/or compatible with lesser internet connections.
---
In case you missed it, PLM is updated.
---
The trailer already showed that some locations will look different, like the crashed space station will be a raider settlement.
---
I also have probably over a thousand kills in surival
---
He just had really good ping time.
---
Yes, that makes sense, thank you good sir I’ll have to change it
---
Really high DR while it is intact As long as it isn't the t-45 one.
---
19 akshually
---
Because u could see flashes of him as he went flying around the map
---
That was fixed 2 updates ago did they re break it?
---
If I’m not mistaken compadre I think you do get XP for knockdowns! It shows up at the end of the match :-) 
---
Also totally fucking agree, my dumbass has the worst time remembering where everything is in vault 51!
---
And really really really fast legs
---
😐I AM EMPATHETIC TO YOUR CAUSE BUT I DO NOT FEEL STRONGLY ONE WAY OR THE OTHER😐
---
Make sure windows and drivers are all up to date.  reboot everything. dance a jig.  sacrifice something to the old gods. Maybe it'll work.
---
I’d be happy just with my presence not being screamed to everyone with the auto deploy of the “Help me” emote when I go down
---
Do you have any proof?
---
Thanks again, great run
---
Doubt it.
---
Your level and everything you unlocked in adventure or survival has now effect on NW though.
---
I think it’s personally meant for people at higher levels.  There’s probably going to be better rewards at level 20, 30, etc.  Just like how we get to go into other areas when we level.
---
Not sure if you know but you can place pieces long range too. You can use it to cover downed allies.
---
Yea, most people that hate the game haven't even played it
---
Thanks, I found a solution though for some reason having my XBOX controller plugged into my PC was the problem, I'll leave this here in case it helps someone else.
---
Why the fuck would you add grenade launchers to this mode? Full auto grenade launchers as well jesus. I'm finding so many grenade rounds too.
---
He would appear in one spot the a second latter he would travel a accross your screen and appear again and would just travel around killing people
---
I don’t use gunfu, but here’s a bump for visibility.
---
I don’t, but there’s a chance I might have set it to that when I’ve used it the one or two times I ever have. Thanks for the advice!
---
The Scottish and Irish use to go into battle naked so as to not tarnish their clan colors.

---
Thank you :)
---
How would you be able to see him if he was on the other side of the map? Wouldn't the terrain block your view?
---
You have to turn gamepad on in the settings for this issue to be non existent, but then if you have both plugged in you HAVE to use controller.
---
Oh most definitely, I’m wondering how they’re going to close it off! If West Virginia saw all these kinds of things (but the rest of the east coast didn’t) then what happened to our survivors? What happens to the wastelanders that we’re going to meet in Fall?
---
I knew they were cosmetic rewards for adventure, but I didn't know what they were or how to check them.
---
Dude I joined my first game ever of 76 today and someone dropped me so much shit then built me a base with what I feel like is everything I could possibly ever need. All the stations, decorations and all! THANK YOU MYSTERY MAN/WOMAN
---
Ya because when I was trying to win the match against a speed hacker I was able to record him doing so. If you don't believe me fine I just though I would let people know about it
---
This game has a LONG way to go. It's a blurry ugly ass mess. Glad I got to try it for free this week. Definitely feels and looks like another early access. We'll see if it's any better in a few years.
---
Mire needs to be at night!
---
Hopefully it isn’t a bug at large, though if it was, I’d probably have hear about it just through Googling it. Hope you can fix your audio as well!
---
No. I have three accounts across 2 platforms and can’t use my PC accounts on my PS4
---
U must be real stupid
---
I saw someone post about it yesterday. They said it still works for pistols.
---
Interesting...
---
May I ask how you can create the camp in adventure mode and blueprint it if you already have a permanently built camp? 
---
Other than defensive items, are there limits to what you can build?
---
It’s random so yeah... I’m not complaining
---
Can I see the recording?
---
I wear my giant vault girl head with pride at all times. Thank you very much.
---
So must have broke from the combat update. Darn
---
K.
---
Why is everyone downvoting these beautiful responses?
---
They'll add storyline into the online game. But vats will still be in real time.
---
That was the joke Ted.
---
Now that I searched it there's tons of complaints.
---
There's Bethesda-created *(might be wrong on authorship but its on their tutorial website)* tutorials for how to create dynamic shelves in skyrim in the creation kit - I hope they didn't take the easy route after all this time.
---
That being said I don't even care at this point I just want them to release them.
---
You da real MVP mate. What are you on? pc or console?
---
I'm thinking about quitting. All I want to do is play adventure mode but I can't. Ever since NW I get so many random server disconnects all the time! I don't want to play BR but those are the only servers that I don't get disconnected from every 5 minutes and it's very annoying.
---
Okay good 😂 so hopefully it'll get fixed and it wasn't just me!
---
Yep, I’ve been loving this game since last November. Watching new items come and go from the Atom store, new events happen, the DLC expanding the world, the bug fixes making everything a little better every month. I feel bad for people that never gave it a shot because the masses told them not to like something.
---
Bring back the ghoul mask from fo3 just as a cosmetic
---
have link?
---
We did the same tonight every time once the numbers dwindled.  Had a nuke launch in the bag. Waited until circle got small and they all started moving toward us and LAUNCHED.  Everyone died hahaha!
---
Oh yeah, you got plenty of fighting to do. You want PvE, just wait till you come across a horde of supermutants fighting a Sheepsquatch. Or you're wandering alone in the mire, pitch black and suddenly a Mothman appears.
---
No problem. I expected a few more people to show up before the end but that's how it is some times.
---
Camp or train station
---
Wow, thats amazing. I wish I had the money to get all of these things
---
I’d love to see people square off around Morgantown airport
---
First you drop your CAMP anywhere and then (for example) place down two foundations, then place walls, two windows three solids, one door. After place steps inside and place 1 roof. 
---
Once all that is done, you need to go back into build menu and hold X (on PS4) and it begins highlighting things. When the selected items are blue, that means you have no added it to the blueprint. When you select items they turn white. Turn the two foundations white first, then the stairs, then walls, and then the roof. ~save blueprint (with a custom name if you want)~
---
You should be able to drop it in NW. 
---
The reason I suggest highlighting things in a particular order is because I am under the impression that it constructs the blueprint based on which item was selected before, so if you do not do it this way you might get a “floating item” error.
---
Its literally a daily challenge, how can people not know it's a thing?
---
Thank you. I’ve had this question on my mind since it came out
---
Plus it’s really fun trying to be tactical when you see a group. Sneaky shot here. Mine there. Shotgun in the building
---
Noob with BRs here.. what does ADS mean..?
---
Lol no one fallout mmo but here we are. Might as well enjoy the surprises in life!
---
I've been there since launch (now a little over level 275) and I'll tell you it's still a buggy mess. They've introduced bugs into patches that still haven't been fixed and it's still very laggy in certain areas.
---
I really haven't had a matchup that was negative yet in this NW mode, up to level 8 now. Everyone has been so friendly, yet focused. I haven't had anyone mansplain anything to me, and when I talk tactics, people actually listen. It's been a complete shift in what I was expecting going in compared to my prior BR experiences. The players in this game are fantastic. I know there are some asshats, but they have been few and far between. To think I've been avoiding team play since Beta when I really didn't have much to be concerned about. This will change how I step back into Adventure mode for certain.
---
In every online community it is very common for people to cry hacker/cheater with no proof whatsoever and it usually just turns out to be salty players. The thing is if there are people hacking there is going to be lots of videos of it popping up sooner than later, but as of now I haven't seen a single one. So maybe you have noticed the first speed hacker, maybe it was just a glitch or maybe you are just making stuff up but there is no way to know for now.
---
I thought it was going to be a disaster but they executed it really well and i was tired of being shit on by my friends who never played it and had just seen reviews on it on youtube.
---
Ha the took the .38 rounds. Suckers
---
seems similar for me i found way less enemies since the patch however the ones i do find usually seem to be two or three stars that actually drop two or three star legendarys
---
I am lucky, because most of it I reviewed as gifts. Slowly growing the collection.
---
I tried that, no good. I'll see what happens when I level again, maybe it will just level 3 times.
---
So far events have been the best, most consistent resource for me. Apparently the horde one in particular is especially good.
---
Sounds an awful lot like Dilbert Winters
---
Even with my mic, my aim is so bad I am always a disaster. I'll keep trying though.
---
I just started playing again yesterday. And created a whole new toon. Yes the game was fun from the start.. but it was SOOOOO glitchy and kept crashing. Sometimes to the point where I'd give up for a week or two at a time. Not only that, but once you did enough in the game... the content and quests... just felt boring. I'm giving it another go and I'm enjoying it because of how much smoother it's running. *I preordered this game, so I was also salty it went on sale 2 weeks later*
---
Damn that's alot of loot
---
I don't think you can bring any of the underarmors into NW.
---
People that talk like that are accustomed to eating their words.
---
It's new that's why every one is there and  most of the players will drop it with in 3 weeks. I would say around 5 to 10% want pvp so a fair small part of the player base.
---
Not everyone checks every menu babe.  Some people just jump into game. Many people don’t even know there’s a two-shotgun. For survival challenge atm.
---
Just hit 21, 25 seems to be another laser rifle skin :/
---
Theres only 14 teams per match but hey top 10 is something haha
---
Aim Down Sights. “ADS animation” is the animation it goes through when your character goes from just holding the gun out to being aimed down the scope
---
How do you know if the servers are crashing if you are not playing? Just wondering.
---
Yep. Been saying it since launch, as have several others, and we get downvoted to oblivion every time we talk about how broken the legendary system + vats is.
---
Proof is in the pudding I guess.
---
Kinda shows how silly anti- people are in general.
---
That would be awesome
---
My second game, my team won without losing anyone. Only had to kill one person. Everyone else took each other out.  Was a good round for us
---
Now if you see someone with the same Q, you can answer it. Good luck!
---
Flatwoods is good. Take note to where the containers spawn. Spawn yourself on them. Helvetia is ain’t too. Sometimes cow spots creamery into the bridge is good. It’s getting hot though.
---
2000? The Y2K virus has finally emerged from its 19 year slumber...
---
It figures after I post this, I was able to do it. I killed at least two with it and then because I nuked the safe zone, I indirectly killed a few others mwhahaha
---
Sorry, I should have been clearer.
---
I'm familiar with camp building, I have a large max budget permanent structure in adventure mode. 
---
My question was how the two are unassociated when blueprints count towards camp budget and how can you build a second camp to blueprint for BR when your permanent adventure mode camp is at full budget?
---
Hey thank you all so much for your replies! I can’t believe I didn’t know/notice this change in the way enemies are scaled. It makes sense though. I’m so used to just focusing on main missions in games/fallout universe, so that’s what I did in this case. I guess I have a lot of work to do to even be able to start these missions.
---
Thank you Col. Klink!
---
Good luck I hope they ship it out to you soon and that it is good quality this time!!
---
I don't really get any more points than that when I actually play.
---
Quick update: just finished making my first bottle of Nukashine with Biv and I already love this drunkard of a brain jar
---
Report the bug, they'll fix it. It isn't the end of the world.
---
Weird presumption that people would be more likely to read reddit post, and not look at the menu in game, but whatever floats your boat.
---
I bought game like month after release and it was bad almost unplayable,but now i enjoying it too
---
You've just experience the tip. Just wait 😉 This community is awesome 😁
---
Just me and my char
---
https://i.redd.it/6rbd0h554oh21.jpg
---
Is that is what happened? wtf.
---
Turn off your pipboy light
---
it had a glowup
---
She's usually behind one of the counters for the massage parlor I believe.
---
Also, why would you link me to something that shows a weekly challenge when I clearly know about these challenges?
---
On?
---
That would nice as well
---
The CAMPS are not linked to each other in terms of budget, but if you have max budget you cannot create a blueprint of the NW CAMP you desire. You actually have to build the structure which in adventure mode, which directly affects your budget, but once you hav e a blue print you can rebuild you camp and take that blueprint into Nw and place it and it doesn’t affect your budget or anything related to adventure mode because they are not linked to each other. 
---
Basically, remove stuff to make room, build blueprint, register blueprint, rebuild your CAMP (whatever you removed) and you’re set. Go into NW and place your blueprint or build a completely new CAMP since CAMPs in NW cost 0 resources.
---
Did you alt + tab in the game at any point? I notice that the times that I launched the game and never alt tabbed at any point it didn't happens
---
She's in the service hallway behind the dining areas.
---
Oof
---
Meh. I am horrible and so are many other people pugging it.
---
Half of it does. The hip-fire cross gets noticeably smaller and the rays don't spread as much when firing.
---
As long as my power armor still protects me fully, it doesn't bother me that I'm glitched half way into it and half out of it. I play first person so I only see the issue when I accidently switch views and only for like . 3 seconds. Other than that, crashes every now and again but what game doesn't have that? It being laggy and slow is also part of the users internet bandwidth as well, not just the servers. It's an amazing and addictive game that everybody should try. At least once, especially if you like the Fallout series.
---
Oh yes sorry PS4.
---
I like the way the mode is implemented, but I don't enjoy this mode with the type of FPS Fallout 76 is. I kinda hope that between NW and Wastelanders Bethesda will give the game a few thick layers of polish. The code, the networking, the visuals...everything.
---
Sounds incredibly painful.. thank you for the information.
---
I came close to a kill. But a teammate swooped in for the final shot.
---
cue "no one asked for a battle royale, lol XD clearly dead game stupid broken junk lol" people crying on youtube who have probably never played 5 minutes of the game.
---
Me too... It's very very annoying! I had to switch to ballistic heavy guns again, the laser is just too annoying to use again 😔
---
Must be some amazing friends, such an impressive collection
---
Have you farmed Morgantown Airport? I would offer, but I need to find more myself. I'd definitely invest in Pharma Farma in Luck to farm low level places, or places you've cleared if you feel like switching.
---
Yeah the two shot version is very powerful. With demo expert it deals about 1k dmg at full health
---
I think that only your team can see it
---
I can help in a few mins but I can give you some tips now if you want me to message you on here.
---
I won the match why would I be salty just saying psa
---
I think so, yes. It looks super weird...
---
The secret is starting to get out that our community is fantastic.
---
Whitespring for plenty of one star and occasional 3 star.
---
 Legendary enemies pop up all over the place on the map and any events you are willing to take on. 
---
You may get killed a few times but keep going back.
---
Yes it was... 😔
---
Lolol that woodland armor is camo though! Same with the blue marine and scout armor colors that make no sense.
---
From what I’ve seen it is! I think this is an especially good time as well since there’s a stream of new players coming in.
---
The silver shroud costume is great for hiding in the bushes. Had an entire group walk right past me and didn't even notice. I even killed one with a crossbow, the others ran away and i didn't want to chase after them and give up my position.
---
With enough time you can get about everything done. But since i'm quite busy right now i can't play that much. The daily caps and scrip already take a lot of time i can't be farming lead and acid as well
---
Just focus on grabbing a shotgun or heavy. Spray and pray will get you kills.
---
lol considering you don't start with any weapons, i highly doubt it.
---
You have the same amount of time as them to find a weapon yourself.
---
You get rewards for every overseer rank you level up. They are cosmetic.
---
My core count doesn't increase, so I don't think so. I do have lots of new partially cores stuck in my inventory again however...
---
It’s not. But it’s pathetic that I could instantly see the problem coming and a team full of devs didn’t
---
Now I can't find a server with enough people to fight the SBQ. Not that it matters since I can't get through a silo without a disconnect anyways.
---
if you don't like watching teammates play, then don't play or don't die, simple as that.
---
These people who complain about "Having to wait 15 mins to watch a teammate play" are what is wrong with gaming in general.
---
I felt bad for my team when i went afk and was spawned across the map for them by the time 2 of them died i finally made it to the last teamate we died after
---
You get to be the overseer. Now you’re in charge. It’s mostly just a lot of paperwork. Not as glamorous as it sounds.
---
One of my favorite [phrases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixWybGQnPHQ).
---
: )
---
Oh, I’ve done that. Just not the kills part. Picked up a shotgun off the drop and couldn’t even take out a guy punching me.  I think I had armor and he didn’t. We were downed at the same time.
---
You have to know them in adventure mode and survival. Gotta go get the plans in there.
---
I'm usually using third person, haven't seen that one... The "random shooting in a completely different direction than where you're aiming at" happens in first person for me though... Something with autoaim assist I guess?
---
I've had fun with long scoped combat sniper rifles  in two games
---
They're totally pointless in a firefight
---
.. but on a cliff, firing down with your 800 range, collecting headshots- Amazing.
---
Thats...what I'm kind of nervous about. Like, to a T. 
---
To each their own obviously, but its just not my kind of content.
---
I feel like this is an exploit, and I shouldn't be doing it.
---
Nothing. I've won like 10 times now. You only get rewards for leveling up. You never have to win at all.
---
Ah, ok. I've found quick wooden walls a few times, but they're not in my inventory to read so I wasn't sure how it works.
---
I've only played survival a few times to collect the weekly legendary weapons, but NW has been too fun to go back to adventure mode for now. It's great to interact with so many different players, and see some people that friended me at Beta.
---
It’s just sounds like a lot, but when you do it it takes literally 5 seconds.
---
Mr matty plays was the best example of a you tuber just being a dick. Played a couple hours of the game early on and told everybody not to buy it.
---
Seen 120+ users who barely know there's life outside Whitesprings and other Reddit-advertised locations.
---
Might be worse than that. For me VATS refuses to even start maybe 20% of the time.
---
Some people don’t dude. Just because you do doesn’t mean everyone does. You’re not the center of the universe, even though your shitty parents told you you were.
---
*lol* not in my camp. It would take me an hour to dismantle enough to give me back the budget space and given the current issues with building, I doubt Id be able to put it back together the way it was.
---
Definitely not worth the hassle for me.
---
Those are what u can use during battle. Just like turret plans. You Dont have to place them in camp area. 
---
In order to make a base you gotta place down camp then start building
---
I wish my friend would follow that advice. He has a select few reviewers that can say anything at all about a game and my buddy just goes with whatever they said without forming his own opinion
---
I really wanted to laugh at what he wrote but he's account is deleted.
---
That would be awesome but I wouldn't want it to be dark every other game. Maybe loike 1 in 5 or 1 in 10 games. They could give other weather effects like fog and rad storms too.
---
its not wearable due to being an underarmor not a pure cosmetic item, since it can be modded.
---
I think speed demon is better lol. Just fast zigzag with sledgehammer, they can't hit you since they don't have vats :)
---
Wow. Stay classy.
---
Feels good killing everybody else. (Insert This is what survival should have been comment)
---
There's one that does but it's blocked from being equipped.
---
Do you use a VPN? Happens to me all the time. But I use a VPN to be able to sign into the game so I thought it was a problem facing me only... turns out not.
---
I think Bethesda uses Google Cloud for their authentication services... that's why I use a vpn cuz it's blocked where I live.
---
Eat a snickers man.
---
Ooooh, thanks.  I thought was all for camp. Neat to be able to build outside of camps. I've only done a couple rounds, still need to figure stuff out.
---
No prob. This also all applies to Adventure/Survival as well, not just the BR mode
---
Btw congrats on the roll! Jealous of that weapon! A B-FFR Gatling Laser is one of the last ones I'm missing (ultracite being better in every way and shoots cool green beams as bonus!). I got like 20 variants with most legendary prefixes 😎
---
YEAH! FUCK LEGENDARIES! MAKE SURVIVAL GREAT AGAIN!
---
And it was one of my favorite perk cards...RIP.
---
Yep the only benefit higher level players have over low levels is maxed special points and all plans for creating a base, so metal walls and bricks walls are hard to destroy
---
I've hit overseer rank 11 and I still havent run into a single Deathclaw gauntlet
---
Not sure what you were expecting lol dumb cunt
---
Seriously, fuck him. Also, fuck Juicehead, fuck Yongyea, and fuck all the other click bait  assholes who have been riding the rage train since day 1 without acknowledging the improvements they've made.
---
I've been plenty critical, but at least I offer constructive criticism instead of gargling someone's balls over things that were fixed months ago.
---
&gt;There’s a wendigo cave??
---
Yes, there is...and please don't go there until you can handle a high level glowing diseased wendigo! 
---
My CAMP is not too far from there and I've rescued more low levels then I care to count...worse, I've seen way too many brown bags that go un-reclaimed from hapless victims either too afraid to go back or just keep dying
---
Other weather phenomena would be great tbh.
---
Don't ask me brah, maybe you trying to spread rumours that wouldn't be anything new either.
---
I forgot how many bots play this game. Waiting isnt fun. And in battle royale most of the waiting is done by people who drop in and wind up facing an enemy with a gun before they get to one. A respawn system tends to hold the interest of players longer so it would probably increase the longevity of this game mode unlike the base game which is currently only populated by bots who think sitting in your camp and roleplaying as a vendor is fun. Im not saying its on a base timer, im suggesting a system similar to apex or like op suggested collecting a token off of a high lvl mob. Or even after a certain kill count is reached by the team. Then respawns wouldnt be guaranteed and they would be risky to achieve.
---
im a trial newbie and i am liking the game better on pc atm i just need to gop on prime time for east coast (i live in hawaii) and make some friends
---
x) just do it during NW it’s as simple as putting your CAMP down at the beginning of the game and then proceed to do it before every fight.
---
Are you this dumb?
---
so you will be saying, damn you scoarchbeast leave me alone. why can i loot in peace lol.
---
im glad you are liking the game,
---
Remember you need to unequip and equip the Stabilized perk if you exit and enter your PA or login on your character. Else the bonuses don't work either. Especially annoying for ballistic guns since they also loose the AA bonus otherwise... 😣
---
Get a load of this shitter
---
I played from beta, have loved every minute, even though it crashed a lot sometimes, I still very much enjoy the game, the social aspect mashes the game everything that it is. This is why you never listen to the crowd and just try new things. Enjoy!
---
It already has a storyline...
---
Ooh can you blueprint from NW too??
---
I don't know if that's a good indicator, smaller map, less mobs, less junk, no events, no player camps.
---
 On the other hand I know precisely sqaut shit about what really impacts server performance, just seems like that would be impactful.
---
Just started today and had a level 55 tour me around the west part of the map
---
From what I understand mostly grinding for their perfect legendary gear.  Can take a long time.
---
It’s not still broken you’re just an entitled little brat. Delete the game and play call of duty
---
What ???
---
Yeah I loved it too, thought they would have thought about gun-fu perk before making it be auto-bugged. Just have this new feature be disabled while gun-fu perk is equipped. Hope it’s an easy fix
---
I was not able to. Not sure if it was a glitch, but I was not able to. That’s why I found this solution.
---
It seems a bit different - first I found none then tried again and scored a few good ones. I went to WS and like all the ghouls in the building all seemed to run into the first room. 
---
Player vendors are a mixed bag - I have wasted a lot of time looking around but have found a few good deals.
---
Free week??
---
I still stand by the statement that no one really wanted battle royale.
---
The gamemode itself is OK, and I won't criticize people who enjoy it in a negative light, it's just a large portion of the player base wasn't exactly on bended knee begging for battle royale to come out.
---
It's a surprise its good, yes, and a welcomed one at that. That doesn't suddenly qualify it as something everyone wanted though, you know? It's like wanting a sandwich and someone gave you some really comfy slippers, it's a welcome surprise but it def doesn't pander to the original itch I had in the first place.
---
There is nothing about 'being social' when you have some mouth breather arguing with someone in his house over his mic nor is there anything about 'being social' listening to someone eat a bag of chips into their mic.  Sorry.
---
What's the second kind?
---
I have deleted it. I just wanted a conversation about problems with the game. And I'll pass on COD, thanks. I like a bit more to my shooters than "stand here shoot these non-descript humanoids".
---
I try to get my PS "friends" into the game but everytime I mention how much I like the game and recommend trying it (DURING A FREE TRIAL no less) I just get met with hostility in a shared message group. So in someways I understand why it's easier to just hate on the game then have to deal with justifying why you enjoy it so much.
---
And by contrast the mute majority are the easiest to please. 
---
I enjoy it to an extent but it needs a MASSIVE amount of polishing to be good. It's currently in no way worth paying for by contrast to other free survival BRs, and the result will either be a dead playerbase in a buy2play game or a free game with a nearly-dead playerbase. The amount of fine-tuning this BR needs will take too long to have a respectably large population.
---
I don't have Discord but I am on xbox1. My handle is Nocturnaria, if you need any help!
---
tbh they look kinda ugly, but camoflauge well in nuclear winter
---
Sssssshhhh.
---
No, you wanted to whine about it and thought we would all back you up, take it to r/fallout I’m sure they’ll be lined up to hear what you have to say.
---
Bloodied explosive.
---
I just prayed it wasn't another balance disaster like Survival, now I have hope that Survival weapon balance can be fixed.
---
You get the pleasure of punching other players and hiding behind the laser grid whilst taunting them at rank ten
---
Technically even if there was a night setting/event, you’d still see what you currently see. Nuclear Winters are pretty bright, considering the air filled with fire.
---
Agreed
---
Try horde events, the AWOL event and uranium fever. 
---
Locations such as Whitesprings, West Tec, and the Generals Steakhouse have good chances at spawning legendaries.
---
Hi liking the game better on pc atm i just need to gop on prime time for east coast (i live in hawaii) and make some friends, I'm dad.
---
I was looking for constructive conversation and maybe some suggestions or maybe somebody would say something to put into perspective. If I'd wanted to just rant and rave and trash the game, I would have gone to r/fallout instead. I thought maybe here I'd get a varied opinion and a real conversation instead of everybody just agreeing about everything. I guess I was right about that part. LOL
---
I'd agree with this tbh.
---
One is heavy, and the other is sturdy
---
Welcome to the game! 
---
If you're in Adventure mode, and have pacifist on, no one can hurt you unless you attack back, FYI.
---
Maybe try rewording your post so it’s my “bitch bitch bitch bitch whine complain OMG BUTTHESDUR¡”
---
Yeah I don't think anyone would complain if the AP was doubled.
---
Ad Victoriam brother!
---
You don’t. You’ll stay at like 10 hp
---
I’ve seen this as well
---
Then continue playing, I just was pointing to the fact that the haters had substance in the early days. Now not so much although I feel there might be still a little to clamor about although there always is.
---
I've personally played league of legends since the middle of season 1 and can't stop. Although I gotta say aside from the drama in the personal lives of professional players the game has honestly been really solid on its development.
---
In the early days I remember it being incredibly common to have someone DC while loading into a game, often two people would bug splat.
---
If you're not going to use bloodied I'd go with anti - armor over furious as people still aren't sure if forious works. Although it should be a lot easier to tell now that we have damage indicators in game.
---
He's dead.
---
It did suck when it came out.
---
Just want to echo the community part, I've played a lot of games online and this has to be the most helpful community I've been a part of. Yeah the game was rough at first but the people made it worth sticking to.
---
Agreed, there should definitely be assist xp.
---
REEEEEEEEEEE
---
I'm sure they will add in the other weapons after they balance them
---
I role play a 3 pack a day smoker, fits me just fine.
---
I kinda feel the same, though I’ve been spending a lot of time on Nuclear Storm more so than survival. It’s a lot of fun honestly, though major problem is performance for me which is the only reason I wouldn’t consider actually buying this
---
One of the default F76 faces is just Nate but some of the features changed. If you change them back you too can search Appalachia for your son like we do.
---
Just strip totally naked no armor etc. Don't have a gun equipped.... And go to whitesprings train station. Someone will understand what you're doing.
---
I thought I just forgot to switch back from ammosmith again but nope gunfu was on. It did seem to work I checked, definitely something up with it though. The instant exiting VATS is nice though, I no longer get disoriented by doing an instant 180 when I blast ghoul and the body flys past me at light speed.
---
And you are complaining about FPS? How shitty is your computer?
---
What purpose could that possibly serve? There's no point in needlessly trashing a game like that. Only children sit there and whine and complain and don't do anything to solve their problems. I said in the title of my post that I was looking for ways to make the game better, to fix it. And as quite a few people pointed out, the game has been fixed in a lot of ways.
---
Yet we can’t get them for our camps 😡
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one who has noticed.
---
Takes approximately two month to make this mod, takes approximately infinite time to add correct content. It's nice they put something in-between for those needing their daily rads.
---
Is the mod dope? Not even close. Is it fun to play? Yes.
---
lol yeah, that's pretty funny.
---
Seems like some weapons it's fine. Others not so much lol
---
It's not a gaming laptop, if that's what you're asking. Not everyone has the money for the best PC setups.
---
im on xbox and im willing to help, also I would definetly wait for  you to be higher lvl before going a silo. 
---
about ppl not accepting your team invite, with ppl trying to trick ppl into PvP can be the main reason why your invites doesnt get accepted.
---
I’m surprised with the server disconnects, I have not encountered that as a frequent problem since launch.
---
On the other hand, the problem may be that you are trying too hard to enjoy it.
---
If you sit back and play for a good 2-3 hours and you don’t get into it, it may just be that it is not a game for you.
---
I'm going to offer a different point of view.... If they're easier to see, it's easier to steal from also.
---
Id rather keep the brown bag and have a map marker tbh than it be easier for other players to loot my junk.
---
&gt;I'm just shy of 800 hours in and I'm still exploring
---
Ditto. Just went over 800 last weekend. I honestly couldn't believe that I'd put that much time in, but there is the stat, laughing in my face! 
---
I've still not been to every marked place on the map, though at least I've got most of them now. I know there are still a ton of unmarked locations I haven't seen yet just based on what I read here. 
---
Unless I'm teamed up and doing events i don't use fast travel anymore I just wander and soak in the wacky, beautiful world that is FO76
---
Yeah, sure, add crawling. But that bleed out timer better go down fast as fuck and they better move slow as hell while crawling.
---
Last thing I would want is to down someone and they scuttle away behind some rock or behind their friend's CAMP defense and I just wasted ammo for nothing. If they choose to move, they should be heavily disadvantaged.
---
Hopefully it won't take them a month to fix like the melee VATS fiasco?
---
Maybe spread a rumour that every time Gun-fu fails to kick in it dupes all your equipped and favourited items :P
---
&gt; Get a load of this shitter
---
Username checks out
---
Yes, same on XB1 since the update.
---
Haha no kidding! Probably get us banned without it being a real thing 🤣
---
Your pc is garbage and you blame the game. Lmao.
---
I started playing the game about 3 or 4 days ago, fully expecting I'd probably return it. But I actually ended up really liking it, especially the camp system.  Got a cliff side cabin overlooking the starting area. Not just that though, the map is really fun and so is the whole card system when it comes to leveling. I've had very few bugs, and what I have had are so minor its barely mentionable. Only gripe is level locked gear really. All in all though, it think its pretty good. Solid 7.5/10
---
You can literally look at this exact subreddit and see how many people are saying “Bethesda please do this or that” y’all are not in the minority at all. Pvp is completely broken, survival is a joke, this battle Royale is what survival should’ve been in the first place.
---
Yeah, that could very well be the case. It may just be because I don’t have as much time as I used to for gaming, so when I’m doing a quest solo and get booted to menu or griefed- it’s a bit too easy to just put in another game lol
---
Na i can see it when i down other players. Its the same for all
---
I’ve met a lot of cool people playing Fallout and it’s pretty awesome!
---
Ignore this guy, typical troll posting all over about how much he hates the game and shit.  No idea why he's on this sub lol.
---
I was under the impression it fired how it did when they came into production?
---
So the first shot will be delayed until the barrel is spun enough.
---
LOL 😂
---
The Forest is the best place to for players below level 20 to gain xp. It has some easy events and most of the responder quests are located there. It also has a lot of resources that you can utilize. 
---
The backpack is obtained through the Pioneer Scout quests, and it's really just basic fetch quests that it takes you on. But I wouldn't go and worry about it right now unless you really want it, because the quests are located in the toxic valley and there are some high level enemies in that area.
---
The pleasure of crushing your fellow vault dwellers. Remember Tanner? The kid that bullied you up at VTU? Yea, he's dead now. Because of you. Reap in the satisfaction and rewards. But seriously, you get overseer xp.
---
Good job grabbing the low hanging fruit
---
I’ve met a few people. One guy who was in the hundreds came up to me and said “I’m dropping plans in a paper bag, some you can use now some you can use later” he dropped them dipped out didn’t even get a chance to say thanks lol
---
In the games defense the start of it is incredibly boring, but mid to late and endgame is a ton of fun. I’d give it another shot if you liked Fallout 4.
---
I'm a PS4 player Depends on times/ servers. 
---
I've seen me hoping on during a weekday and it's been 5/10 people spread out across the map. I always see loads of players in other sessions.
---
Death wish.
---
So what do you want them to do? You can't blame Bethesda if you don't have a PC good enough.
---
Here's what I just did leveling up my Alt character:
---
Stay up north and to a circuit of WV Lumber, Wade Airport, Grafton Steel, and Grafton town. Do stealth attacks and plan on running away if you get mobbed.   All these places have low level super mutants (avg lvl = 5 -10, with bosses at lvl 22).  Grafton Steel and WV are great for leveling up due to the sheer number of easy to kill low-level super mutants.
---
Use frag grenades.  These work wonders at slowing down enemy mobs.  Frags cripple enemies making them limp around and unable to chase you.  I toss one in a group of super mutants and find about half can't do much but limp after you.  Makes managing a mob much easier
---
Check forest player vendors for low-level legendaries!  I started my alt with a couple of hand-me-down legendary weapons and armor (lvl 1 - 10) and I supplemented that with legendary stuff I bought from player vendors in the forest.  By level 15 I had 4 legendary armor pieces and some pretty good legendary weapons I bought from vendors (example lvl 5 bloodied Combat knife, Lvl 15 furious pump action shotgun, lvl 25 Vampire's Chinese Officer Sword). 
---
Do all the events you can in the forest.  Especially do the Leader of the Pack event (Aaronholt Homestead) to get the low level legendaries which will GREATLY help you level up and go places and deal with higher level enemies.  Once you have decent legendary weapon(s) you can try Whitesprings to get even more legendary weapons, but keep in mind while enemies scale there, it's used by everyone so you'll most likely encounter 40 - 60 level ghouls left by the high level player just before you.
---
Get Excavator PA asap (level 25) to help with keeping radiation manageable at places like Whitesprings and nuke zones.  Once I hit 25,  I made Excavator's PA and used my Vampire's sword to farm Whitesprings. PA keeps rads/damage manageable with mobs and a good vampire's two-handed mele weapon (sledge, axe, sword, guitar, etc.) works great against mobs there.  Each hit keeps restoring your health so you can clean out a mob with a Vampire's weapon that would otherwise require you to continuously pop stim packs if using another legendary effect weapon.   I regularly took out lvl 40 - 60 ghouls without much trouble (just takes time hacking away at 'em).  
---
Invest in Fireproof perk cards asap.  These will make you practically invulnerable against SB sonic attacks, explosions, and fire.  No more getting killed by exploding vehicles or a random SB encounter.
---
Also plan on getting mutations as early as you can (lvl 30 for starched genes to keep mutations permanent) if you plan on using them.  At level 30, get starched genes as the next two perk card picks and then buy serums you want from player vendors (avg price is 250 - 500 per serum).  I found marsupial and Speed Demon really help early on.  
---
What platform are you on? I'm on PC and can help with making PA and donating any low-level legendary stuff I'm not going to use for another alt I just made.
---
Pride and glory!
---
Man i better get over there and see if anything is good to loot!
---
So I haven’t missed one yet? I don’t really read the news tab in game or check the website, I just check the shop once a week usually for anything free.
---
It seems to grant more xp
---
Good to see a Sabaton reference,  thanks stranger
---
I’m not sure how the servers work, but adding the ability to toggle weather or day/night just from your perspective would be awesome as well.
---
White springs
---
Long range laser shotgun that uses rifle perk
---
Would not put it past them :P
---
Look up Old World Radio on youtube or google A-Bomb Radio.
---
Plenty of fallout music on both.
---
Jelous
---
\-50% Armor is just that -50% armor
---
Example you are shooting at a Glowing Mirelurk with 150 Ballistic resist. your weapon's damage only counts for 75 of that 150. meaning more damage. it does nothing against unarmored enemies though.
---
Durability and armor pen would fix them
---
I added you!
---
Personally I just play the Appalachia Radio playlist from Spotify while playing but I know a few people aren’t able to do this so I thought if they add it to the game it would be both helpful and cool for players
---
It's like that awful show where they travel around looking at ppls junk! But when not edited it's a lot of horse armor out there.
---
Raccoon skin hat
---
What paints have you gotten at level 20? I’m interested in the awards and 20 is the highest level I’ve heard of someone getting as of now.
---
Not just you, night seems very bright to me as well. Fo4 had the same issue, sucks this game doesn’t have mods to fix that.
---
Intelligence is god tier my guy. Two perks every ranged player needs on at all times, if you have and explosive weapon:
---
Gunsmith, and Explosives Expert.
---
Why? You will hit super extra hard with an explosive weapon, plus that perk. Gunsmith keeps the weapon from breaking too fast to be useable.
---
Or, you can use just one of those with the fusion core perk, and almost never run low  on cores. 
---
I also highly recommend blast radius in perception, as it also ups the splash damage of explosive weapons.
---
Explosives is just an all around great perk investment. Anything that goes boom is suddenly useful AF. I think on top of it all, splosives just got a damage buff. My damage values are way higher in my pipboy than they used to be.
---
But yeah, screw adding an energy gun perk, just buff it! Or add “laser suppressors”. Or both! Or nerf energy resistances and cards related to that.
---
Posters are located at the train stations.
---
Message me your gt
---
So much this.
---
I hacked a terminal and got option to show all enemies on the map for a little bit. Doubt this guy but there is a way to see ppl if you got hacker equipped
---
I should probably be documenting this but 26 is a player icon
---
I recreated Deacon with pompadour wig and all, just because I love his voice actor so much. Hard for me to imitate that voice though, with mine being female. Curse you non existent Adam's apple!
---
Lol that's awesome
---
I could be mistaken but I'm pretty sure this is just the beta run mixed with the free weekend. If it isn't then they're wasting most of the map just having it secluded to the Forest
---
oh shit sorry i forgot that little detail lmao, my GT is the same as my name here. 
---
again sorry
---
The new legendary scrip is in a new trainstation in the Mire, near Harper's Ferry. Kinda north.
---
Bring up your menu, there's a section to change your appearance. You can do this at any time.
---
Well really NMS could have saved it self on day 1.   They could have changed it from "Release" to "Early Access" and none of that would happen.  It took 2 years after "Release" to make an Ok game.
---
I’m so confused now...
---
Would love this so much!
---
Main reason why I play NW.
---
It's called bug fixes and patches. I'm still glad they're at least fixing the game though.
---
There's a number of reasons for that but the biggest is probably just as simple as all of their opinions were formed from the poor launch and they don't know how much has been fixed. Either that or they just hate 76 because it's "not Fallout" since it's so different to the previous games in the series
---
In the beta it was extremely dark. There were alot of complaints so they brightened it up.
---
Yep. This was my first thought when playing.
---
I find a single player mode very unlikely but I could see the benefits to it so I wouldn't be opposed to it
---
PC specs?
---
Added
---
Obvious dev is obvious.
---
of course, but I still have to fight against squads - this wouldn't be the case in a dedicated duo mode.
---
I'm still not playing it. The reload time is way too long.
---
For anyone confused, read the terminal at the far end of the military wing of the whitespring bunker, past the robot vendors. Prepare a bucket for fyour mind to be blown. 
---
Literally anything could be possible in this game because of this.
---
I just read the patch notes, you are right! Apparently it’s just a pre-beta sneak peek, which is disappointing since I’m having so much fun but also worth it since that most likely means a ton of improvements and more zones. Now let’s just hope they add the weather and day/night cycles.
---
This is so sweet and wonderful. I just hit level 30 but it’s been a slow and painful (mostly solo) process. I would  love more support and tutorials from other players, if i could find it. Even having played and loved other fallout games, there are some things about 76 that took me a while figure out. 
---
That being said, every now and then high level players *have* shown up and followed me around for a bit... but i had no idea what they wanted so I get nervous and fast travel away or quit the game, because I’m awkward. Sometimes they seem helpful, but sometimes they just start attacking me and my camp.
---
Just last week I ran into a much higher level player who followed me for a bit and kept killing all the enemies that attacked me. They kept crouching near me and putting their character’s face in my character’s ass. It was very charming. I felt like we were making a very weird yet special connection, but then they signed off and I lost them forever... *sigh* is there a subreddit for missing connections in games?
---
&gt;maybe this can turn into a nice semi-popular game with a fun community.
---
I'd like to think we're a fun community now and for a lot of us it's become quite a bit more than " semi-popular "...though I certainly understand how someone who hasn't played can get that impression from YouTube and other online reviews. Bethesda has come a long way since launch and has been doing regular patches fix bugs and they keep adding content. 
---
What platform are you on? If it's PC I could perhaps give you a guided tour of some of the places in the Forest and a few goodies to speed you on your way...
---
REEEEEEEE!
---
So I just did a bit of testing on the CAMP related questions. I placed my camp in Adventure Mode, left the server, loaded up Nuclear Winter and deployed my CAMP there (clicking a button which said "move CAMP", even though I had never used it before in that mode) and placed a few camp objects. When I went back to Adventure Mode, my original CAMP was still there, unaffected by how I deployed the CAMP in Nuclear Winter.
---
TLDR: It appears that placing a CAMP in a Nuclear Winter round has no effect on your CAMP in Adventure (and presumably Survival) Mode.
---
I think they talked about it more for the point do mods as having servers for mods would require lots of downloading and such to load into them. Honestly a single player mode doesn’t fit the current game. It’d be great to explore without lag or play without internet though.
---
Nvidia GTX 970, 8GB RAM, AMD 8320 8-core 3.5GHz processor
---
The two friends I've played with so far have stronger GPUs than I do and experience around the same amount of frame-drops, for the record
---
&gt;(1)How do you get camp set in NW? I found some parts in box.
---
Parts are just quick deploys to put up a wall, you use your camp like in adventure mode except not need for materials and you can use blueprints you have made
---
&gt;(2)How do we launch nuku in NW ? I found the nuku cobe in box. 
---
You need 4 codes and a brifecase to launch 
---
&gt;(3)Which weapon best for battle in NW? I can not find 50cal.Should I huck computer for get Good weapon in NW? (4)Your Perk build advice for NW.
---
Both depends on you really but stealth boys are great so use them.
---
How?
---
For #1, take out your pip boy and it will say which button to build camp. However the turrets and walls you get in boxes will either be in your favorite wheel or inventory.
---
Yeah. I bought the game on release and then dropped it for a few months. In that time they fixed major issues an dim having a blast.
---
Because I don't
---
Tripled! Quadrupled! Quintuoled?
---
Yes. Because video game politics have a lot to do with gay people irl.
---
It is but you have to be a type of player so you would force yourself to complete all the quests i am a solo player I completed all the quests alone but once I did I was looking for people to play with so it is worth it but not for Long periods of time
---
It's not
---
I played Nuclear Winter as 2 different characters on my same PSN account and each character had separate Overseer Ranks, so judging from that, it looks like you would have to grind it out for each character.
---
You know what they meant, T_D user.
---
Definitely. I used preset 1 for anyone going for this look, although preset 5 and 15 are solid starters too. The more Nates out in the wasteland the better the chance we have of finding Shaun.
---
damn dude i just started and i could use someone like you lol, need more of you in the gaming world.
---
You playing on PS4?
---
Yep
---
You can join us. My PSN is Bloodlineflc. I could help you farm up.

I’ve done Uranium Fever Twice since the patch and have had way more two and three star drops than usual.

---
i know someone that this something like this but with the eye of ra for 10k and someone got it,  to make it even funnier my friend lost about 7k caps becuase he was at 22k caps at the moment of the purchase. instant Karma at it best.
---
save your caps early on. dont buy anything if you can help it. use those caps to fast travel to player vendors and events around the and always discover one point of interest while you're there. fast travel back to the vault is free and to your camp is free, use that to your advantage by putting your camp in a different section of the map than the vault and use them to save caps covering large distances. 
---
normal quest progression should take you north to the water park then south towards the ash heap then mid game you can kinda go where you want but dont push into the right side of the map till you're 30+. just exploring will unlock area quests that will get your leveled at a steady pace. following the main story quests will put you in range of a lot of side quests. 
---
if you're in a rush you can always farm super mutant towns and server hop but its not much fun. you can also grab power armor and go into a nuked whitespring area to leech XP as long as theres a group of high lvls doing a loop, just tag stuff and get tons of xp. 
---
feed the people event at mama dolces is one you should do often. the reward gives you a food that gives 5% more XP for an hour, sleeping in a bed for a bit will give you a temporary boost as well. 
---
around lvl 38 you'll get access to starched genes luck perk. get 2 ranks of this asap and find a player vendor that sells the marsupial serum. make sure you dont have starched genes equpped when you drink it then put the perk back on and never ever take it off unless you're adding more mutations. marsupial serum is by far the best mutation to get while leveling, lets you carry more but more importantly jump higher so you can get to places you normally couldnt and get away from enemies that cant reach you.
---
yeah np hope to play with you soon.
---
Tokyo so you would be 30 minutes ahead of me.
---
Thank you very much!
---
Nice
---
i do agree it sucks and the quest itself too, but wait until you try to get your back pack . lol
---
If your looking for someone to play with I’m solo rn, xb1 btw
---
Some of his best friends are black as well
---
i think you are wrong. When i equip the highcap Backpack and my energy resistance goes below zero, i take more damage than i would with 0 energy resistance
---
Thanks you info !
---
Probs because reviving and getting out of power armor are binded to the same key. They definitely need to change this.
---
Agree 100%.
---
Lower the resolution you run the game at.
---
Idk about Juicehead specifically, he seems to be on a redemption arc of late.
---
It's not actually a chest.
---
Oh, so what is it?
---
The xp needed does increase every rank 
---
But the whole sneak peak fact makes a lot of sense
---
Time for an upgrade.
---
Just watch porn during this time. So the family knows what you are doing.
---
Okay!
---
i lightly supplied a small group, maybe 8 people with a bit of purified water and stims  
---
and then teamed up with one of them and got them some stuff, even got them a power armor frame and dropped them some spare cores  
---
it felt good
---
afaik pretty much all enemies have at least some damage or energy resistance
---
Switch bladed two people &gt;:D
---
This is beyond gay
---
You can mute and your problem would be solved or used a head set. 
---
I use a head set when the baby is going to bed, solves the problem of the wife nagging me for being loud. Hell sometimes I don’t even have the volume on and just wear the head set to have silence...
---
Do our SPECIALs ever increase?
---
Did my first 500hours solo and the next 500 with my team mate, enjoy both at their given time
---
Yea I’ll watch it muted on my phone and just listen to the deployment lobby lol
---
In the beta it was perfect. There were complaints so they made night into blue day. Then they put a dozen night vision scopes at every vendor.
---
I never played a BR game before was not disappointed.....now it's 3am and I'm still going, won only like 2 games though but it's so addictive, most fun I had in a good long while
---
It's just a player icon.
---
Later on you will get s small blue chest for a shltash box. But you will get like 4 or 5 icons first.
---
Welcome to the game.  I'm glad you gave it a shot.  I started during the beta and honestly I didn't think it was too bad even at that point.  The best thing to do is always to try a game, if you can't I would tell people to watch some of Oxhorn's videos about Fallout 76.  Watching someone play the game, enjoy it and yet be able to criticize it when it falls short is far better then the short "reviews" of the game.
---
I tried it ...made an honest attempt but fallout mechanics are to clunky and sluggish even with sensitivity turned up I'm pissed off that I am essentially being forced to play a game mode I don't enjoy just for skins for adventure mode and its complete bs for the lore hunters like me that never wanted mp fallout in the first place the concept is ok but I'll stick to adventure mode but I'd bet everything when it's out if beta they will pull some fortnite type bullshit with season passes for skins and plans and that will really put the nail in the coffin for me Bethesda was the last hope for gaming and they caved in on the monetization wallet raping the industry is failing gamers because all the gamers that make the games are under the whips of corporate bs and greed and like sheep gamers just give in

Top 10 Anime Character Redemptions
---
Did they change Survival Mode recently or something?
---
Trying to do it on PS4 and it doesn't fucking show free trial. Still $29
---
The "team full of devs" are working on future games.
---
Probably famine, or a good old natural disaster, or aliens. Or all three.
---
I did the same and I’ve had a bit of a similar experience. I watched Todd’s E3 thing where he was like “our community is so nice on this game” and I legit have people sprinting around following me shooting me. This is not what fallout is supposed to be.
---
go into nvidia control panel 3d settings and change the vsync settings, if its on try fast, if its still bad just turn it off.
---
I mean, you're not wrong.
---
Make sure Windows and drivers are up to date.  Run the Scan and Repair tool in the Bethesda Launcher.
---
Sick
---
might end up dying if you’re in the middle of the game switching to text on console though so meh.
---
Don’t they start spinning if you hold the aim button?
---
Or am I thinking of something else...
---
I dont think the CPU is supported for the game. However you can try a few .ini tricks. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ai6o3t/pc_useful_ini_settings_everyone_should_check_out/
---
Search the above link to turn grass off. That's one savibg Grace you can try.
---
You can also try overclocking. My friend has a similar CPU and an rx580 8gb GPU, and 16gb RAM. He gets similar hiccups. Not much beyond upgradibg will help, besides some ini tweaks.
---
The mire... Couldn't see 2 feet in front of you.
---
Don't. I'm close to the vault and do this frequently, I always regret it. Some level 100+ stops by and buys my entire stock, most likely to resell to a bot vendor because it's all worth way more than I'm charging. It's why my serums are all 300+ now.
---
Then you wouldn't need to use the perk card.
---
Ah! I misunderstood. I can understand that, then. I'd be lying if I said I didn't forget duo specific queues were a thing in other BR games.
---
Yeah dude I’ve got in on and I’ll stay and watch once the team dies and nothing ever goes off even with a squad looting my bag
---
not to preach realism in a game with something called a sheepsquatch, but this is how these guns behave in real life, minus all the plasma and shit
---
The special stats can be altered in adventure mode (leveling up) but you will always be limited to 7 cards in NW
---
I know why it is happening. I just wanted to bring awareness to the bug.
---
Anything you unlock, they're Player Icons and Photomode overlays
---
All they need is make a broom weapon so the witch characters can equip them.
---
Definitely not. Heavy weapons without a doubt, still have their place. I don't run heavy builds, but I still own QE harpoon because it's easily 1 of the most powerful weapons in game. Heavy builds are extremely important for the dmg against the queen.
---
Salty dupers told you what to think, peasent
---
Constructive criticism is good and needs to be apart of this sub and other forums.
---
It’s 3 fewer people to kill
---
i understand a lot of the initial hate  
---
but i keep getting people telling me outright lies now  
---
like all future updates will be paid  
---
they're going to abandon the game quickly because of the poor start  
---
the game wont improve because they wont listen to players  
---
there's nothing they could add that would improve it enough to be a real fallout game  
---
i think E3 is a good summary of them being wrong  
---
i said right at the beginning if they stick to it and evolve the game world as they go this could be the BEST fallout  
---
and just look at that, settlers and raiders are moving to Appalachia soon  
---
huh, apparently i needed to vent, too
---
If you have a gaming headset, some of them have separate channels for what they see as "chat audio" and "game audio" and will sometimes act oddly in games with built in Voice chat...
---
Thanks man. Probably Thursday evening for me
---
First I've heard of this one, I kept having the second mine explode when I threw it..
---
My own placed turret decided to shoot me.
---
Is 18 the last reward?
---
Well that's unfortunate
---
You deploy a CAMP as you normally would through your Pipboy.
---
I don’t know what parts you found in a box, usually you find Chems, Stinpacks, Mutations, Grenades, Weapons, Ammo and Armor.
---
.50 cal is a higher tier weapon usually found in a box that is beeping or in a locked lvl 1 box/safe and maybe it might be a drop from hacking a computer and requesting a weapon. Not totally sure on that.
---
Dropping a nuke requires four nuke codes and a nuclear briefcase then you can place the nuke as you would in single player 
---
The best weapon is on how you play with what perks you have unlocked. Combat Shotguns, .50 cals, scoped levee actions, Tesla guns, and ultracite lasers seem to be my go to
---
Well the thing is.. Almost all Youtubers stream garbage out of their mouths now.
---
I used to watch some Youtubers until all the Fallout 76 bashing went on.   It  was fun for me to play, not what they were saying.   They were just making up crap and spewing that stuff to get views.  It was all a money grab.  So I quit watching all of them.
---
Strongly doubt a single player world is coming....  
---
A large chunk of '76 is controlled on the backend / Bethesda side, and having individual "Cloud Server" instances for every player would be insanely cost prohibitive.
---
It’s definitely fun, I just hope it stays that way. What I like about adventure mode is that it doesn’t matter if you put in 6 hours per week or per day. You’ll have the same amount of fun. 
---
Right now we’re all noobs in NW, but in a few months time it will just be dominated by squads playing that mode 24/7, making it less fun for the casual player. Same reason I quit games like COD. I just don’t have the time to keep up with the grind.
---
That would be sweet
---
Wouldn’t they be able to have client side saves instead of cloud based ones?
---
Good info. Thanks you very much!
---
I don’t think step children usually get multiple massive updates constantly.
---
Are you now or have you ever been an employee of Bethesda Softworks LLC,  ZeniMax Media or any of their affiliates?
---
It’s working for ps4
---
It really is though. I'm not sure how they'd redo it, but I'd like to see a change too
---
On PC and not Xbox but in the past I've seen a few  posts about clearing the local cache for '76 resolving a bunch of the server disconnect issues for people.
---
The map could probalby choose a random time of day. That would mix it up
---
Furious exploding unless ur fighting high armor enemies
---
I know and understand the updates and stuff but with nuclear winter out its HUGE! I just have that feeling cant explain why I just feel that way.
---
Max AP should be doubled, but the time it takes to refill the bar stays the same.
---
It's literally impossible to read your paragraph here in one breath, so I'm just here wondering where the fuck all the commas and periods are
---
PC, its when i open a fast travel menu on a friend using the map.
---
Nuclear Winter is still beta. It just came out this week, they will get it balanced and smooth
---
And STASH skin.
---
And weapon skin later on.
---
And a underarmor with 51 number on it, instead of 76.
---
I actually don’t like online or multiplayer games at all, apart from FO76. I like RTS, TBS and RPG games. When I heard about this battle royale mode, my heart sank. We already had Survival mode, which I wasn’t interested in, and most social media posts I’ve seen are people begging for more PVE content to advance the storyline. Now, I’m not one of those weird screechy people who just shouts about things they don’t like without trying it first, so I tried it. Fallout 76 was my first proper foray into the world of online gaming, and I love it. And so, I had to give the battle  royale mode a fair try as well, even though I assumed I’d hate it. It’s just... not my kind of fun.
---
For me, it’s terrible. Every single prejudice I have against online games was confirmed. You have this tedious two minute wait at the start (“Explore the vault! Discover the terrible and tragic past of vault 52!”. Yeah, nah. Why not allow my adventure mode guy to do that? Wouldn’t that make more sense?), the game drops you back to the main menu afterwards (what would be so wrong with a lobby?) and... it’s something that forces a player to play (read: fire a gun for a while) a certain way, because vats doesn’t appear to work. Now, I have developed a habit of playing the game using the features that come with the game (in fact, they are emblematic of the game going back to 1996 when I first played Fallout 1). My adventure mode character that I’ve had since the beta is specc’ed out as a vats user. I have no idea why this isn’t in this game - it’s not like my perk cards or special stats will help me, it specifically removes them as components of the game. So, I am forced to play a lacklustre FPS game instead, with this mode. Thing is... if that’s what I wanted to do, I’d play a different game, because those other games already do that. That’s not what a fallout game is supposed to be. The main pull of the fallout games as far as a FPS aspect goes is that you can do it your way, fight how you like, survive how you like. Have YOUR fun, not be forced to play it one single way.
---
Not in this mode. Everything does around the same damage, there is no access to vats, and the panic button (stimpack) has been turned into the camp build button (I REALLY don’t understand that decision. Why the hell would you lock the player base into the habit of pressing = for a stimpack and then CHANGE it for a single mode?). I now have to use the god-awful favourites wheel to use them. And the adventure mode world? It’s empty, for the most part. The player base has been cannibalised into BR mode. There’s nobody to visit or interact with or help or squad up with in adventure mode right now.
---
I can’t disagree with you. I’ve never seen any post on here, on Facebook, on YouTube, on twitter of anyone asking for battle royale. They’ve almost universally been asking for more PVE stuff, more story stuff, for the storyline to be advanced. But we got given this. Now, if I was a cynic (spoilers: I am) I might say that this appears to be an attempt to bloat the player base by adding a game mode that exists elsewhere to attract those players. Then they can sit in the boardroom and go “Oh, wow, we got an extra nine bajillion players this month, we are doing things right, we are going to be very rich indeed!” I enjoyed fallout76 from the start, and I’ve stuck with it. But this sort of thing isn’t where the effort should be going because it in no way plays to what makes the game unique out there in the marketplace - it turns it into a generic title that is basically just like almost any other online game. And that worries me. It feels like a testbed for something else, like Mass Effect: Andromeda was clearly a testbed for Anthem.
---
What are Bethesda going to do with their franchises? I mean, I don’t care overmuch if I have to go “ah well, that’s a shame, never mind” if ES6 or FO5 turn out to be “games as a service” or “Battle Royale” titles, because I don’t have to play them... but it’s still going to be a shame, if that’s where we end up. And it’s a shame that it currently feels like there’s not much point me playing fallout 76 at the moment because the battle royale mode they’re testing out on us right now has cannibalised the core game, leaving the Appalachian wasteland feeling more like a wasteland than ever. And it’s a shame that the battle royale mode itself puts these weird constraints on the players that makes it all so... generic. If I wanted to play battlefield or Fortnite (and I don’t) I would play those games. There is nothing unique or special or imaginative about nuclear winter. In fact, they have stripped out the things that made fallout unique in order to make the mode in the first place, and I don’t know why.
---
I always get depressed when my assumptions about something are proven to me to be correct. But... well. I guess I’ll do something else this summer. I’m in no way having a go at anyone who likes it (I’m not the fun police) but I do worry about what message this is sending out. 
---
It feels more and more these days that computer games are going down the EA route of profit&gt;game design. We already have one EA. We don’t need another. I’ve been playing games since the eighties (I’m very old) and I don’t remember the hobby ever feeling this... dirty. It’s a cheap copy paste of another game at the expense of what made this game stand out in the crowd. At best, it’s misjudged. At worst... well. It feels as though we as a group are being treated with a degree of contempt for what (in business jargon) amounts to “brand loyalty”. Eliminating player choice, reducing the options for how people engage with your product is not a good thing.
---
I have loads of suggestions for how the mode could be tweaked to improve the experience, but based on the fact that we got given it with a massive fanfare as though it was somehow an answer to our prayers after spending eight months asking for story content doesn’t lead me to believe that there is much point asking for them. The quietly happy majority who have been positive this whole time are being ignored anyway, so it’s not like they’ll listen. I’ve already slowed down my pace of logging into the game over the last month as it is because the last actual fun part I was impressed with (due to the aforementioned preference for story, teamwork, and my preferred play style and not being forced to play a certain way) was Fasnacht, which was months ago. Wild wasteland was... ok. It was mostly content that, in all charity, should have been there anyway from October, but... like I say. I’m a fan of these kinds of games, and it was a pleasant surprise how much I enjoyed an online game up to this point.
---
Ah well. Back to my indie game library for three months it is. I might come back for the next update, if anyone is playing adventure mode anymore. At least with that mode there’s no tedious two-minute wait to actually get going, and the option to play however you like is intact.
---
It sounds like porn?  I wouldn't know.
---
There is a perk card for that!
---
Should be pinned tbh
---
Camp items you pick up are in the misc tab or favorite wheel.
---
To launch a nuke you will see 4 thin slots and a bigger slot next to your AP bar. The 4 slots are for 4 codes you need and 1 briefcase to actually launch it. You need to interact with the briefcase in your inventory after you have all the 4 codes.
---
Weapons depend on the player. I prefer the radium rifle and grenade launcher. If I find a gatling gun I will use that instead of the radium rifle. I personally think the grenade launcher is OP especially early on before everyone gets power armor. And we'll the radium rifle is grand because rad resist dosent really exist all that much and it just eats players for breakfast both early game and late game. Gatling gun is just great for everything. If you find the leaver action it's also a nice addition for ranged combat.
---
There is??? What is it? 0:
---
Men and women grunting as they punch each other... What the fuck kind of porn do you watch?
---
I'm sorry, but I couldn't help but laugh at that, with you being unable to kill a guy who's punching you
---
Haha
---
Yeah, no VATS anyway.
---
True, every sever has 15 people around flatwoods and just one or two around Whitesprings.
---
Perks builds is up to what perks you get. You can have a total of 7 cards as long as they follow your special stats. I've just found the double radious for explosives and it's fun.
---
Your suggestions dont really work if you are just going to say everyone elses opinion is wrong and you are the only one right.
---
If you saw it coming where is the warning post asking them to be careful, or prepping people for the "I told you so"?
---
I think Juicehead is probably more even keeled.  At least if you have watched his coverage of Fallout 76 in the last month or so. I could be wrong though...and that certainly wouldn’t be a first.
---
That's true.
---
I think is what todd meant when he mentioned this being the friendliest post apocalypse they could think in the E3 conference. I completely agreed with him there too. As long as you avoid survival people are incredibly friendly to eachother, even getting in line at vendors and waiting for their turn. Back when the purveyor launched I remember people lining up neatly and wait for their turn. It was one of the funniest things I have seen and a great example of how the community is like. Helping noobs and making sure they enjoy the game is a great way to get more players into f76. Keep it up OP
---
Yeah, there's no possible way a series with anti-capitalist themes would have pro-LGBT devs.
---
Theres a reason why game developers shouldnt/dont listen to the not good players in the playerbase
---
*insert that's you joke*
---
I really need to get back to this game
---
Known issue, Bethesda already acknowledged it and said they are looking at a fix
---
When you get punched they could say with a high joyous voice saying "Good day dweller" and 
---
"That was Rads!"
---
Yea I'm getting bored of the same area every time, which sucks but at least we'll get more areas
---
I had no desire to try NW, but now I definitely will.
---
You do not
---
But you can find serums in crates
---
Thanks you Good info ! I will try.
---
No but you do get new temporary mutations with in nuclear winter but they will be removed after the match
---
This game is great, people are just mad cuz they are crazy. Never trust the media
---
You see people for a bit after they shoot I'm pretty sure. Idk I like it
---
I think a lot of the hate comes to people not being sure how to handle not being the hero.
---
I don't play a lot due to time, but when I do, I decide between whether to gather supplies or do a quest or whatever elde, like I'm trying to survive another day in the wasteland. It's refreshing
---
#Bethesda this is a cool idea, take a look at it, and make it happen.
---
I agree 100%. I didn't buy it at launch because I was skeptical, and then I heard it sucked. So then when I bought it two weeks ago it has been nothing but fantastic. I have enjoyed every moment of this game and I cannot wait to see what is to come.
---
Thanks. I knew about the site but since the redesign, there is no longer the date range displayed. Is it automatically handled or is there a chance last week's codes could remain up? Also I'm in a different timezone and I don't remember when the codes reset so I could be just in the middle of a nuke silo.
---
It is an exploit but is only for today cause it's a daily challenge so use while you can
---
For some reason mine stopped being able to be farmed after 20ish games, no idea why
---
I’m thinking static too but something that checks against either what you have collected in the past or currently have in your stash. Like you could place the glass display case to teddy bear and it would fill it with what you have seen. Kinda like the previous bobble head stand. From opossum badges we know it keeps track of collectibles like types of teddy bears and magazines nuka cola etc.
---
Or maybe you interact with the item and fill it up like the magazine racks in fallout 4. Choose what items of that type that you want to fill.
---
It's not just about the client side saves, it's part of the games engine running on the server and not locally.    
---
It's why everyone sees the same Enemies when at a location, with the same level, rather than different monsters and levels, the whole game is not running on your PC, a chunk of it is controlled by the server.
---
The real winner is the grenade launcher! I just keep pushing ppl out of cover and my team had 2 50 cal. Ez pz.
---
#There is going to be several maps for nuclear winter. The map you are currently playing, is just a sneak peek of what Bethesda is planning to do.
---
No worries. I'm writing them down as I go so if I can fill any gaps I'll post in here.
---
Thanks for the information., I appreciate it.
---
[](/crazyfs)I play with controller, there's no auto aim, but I haven't had too much trouble winning firefights. It's more a question of getting the drop on players than anything else in my experience.
---
he's just a tedious rephraser of reddit posts with the charm of baking soda. Churning out dozens of hours of droning to make a few bucks and build a monotone brand.... blegh.
---
Its melee BTW
---
They should definitely double AP since you cannot use V.A.T.S. on players.
---
I agree with you.  I think some of these youtubers don’t see just how similar they are to the gaming industry they so oft despise.  If you do the right thing for the wrong reasons, (or with the wrong approach we’ll say), at bare minimum you turn a lot of people off.  I wish they would just review the game and offer the criticism instead of the hate.  I am not sure how many people realize you can be extremely critical of something or someone without being hateful.
---
This is so cool
---
no, vault suit is underarmor meaning its the only thing on still
---
No worries! Happy to help a fellow vault dweller!

Heeeeeeey guys don't forget to like and subscribe!

Gets him views, gets him $$$ ultimately.
---
I'll make a post tommorow of rank rewards for first 30 ranks that where I'm at
---
I have a Park card that requires 6 perception, though.
---
I rarely experience disconnects, but they can most likely be expected if you play for long periods of time on the same server.
---
I'm having precisely the issues everyone's been complaining about since launch. So I'm simply not sharing in your experience so far. Tonight was my first night playing the game and I got disconnected twice, I got huge tanks in  FPS in event area's (on Xbox One X) and to top it all off, literally every note I try to read in the world is blank....wtf is that shit!? I googled it and it seems to be unique to me for all I can tell. Every note, every posted board....the propaganda flyers look normal, found one page that had the art background of something, but all text missing, but otherwise every persons paper notes are entirely blank.
---
I thought "no way could those nasty issues I heard about at launch still be around" and here I am, already bitching about it on my first night of playing the game. I'm gonna keep trying but I really hope the fun starts soon...
---
The perk card would still be useful if base running AP was reduced.
---
No its not. Many of us have and continue to play all game modes only being kicked a handful of times in months.
---
A few consoles have problems with its older wifi card. Check your connection. I get fps spikes but almost nevet get kicked
---
Carrying power armour is an issue?
---
somewhere in this sub i was reading about some kids uttering profanities in voice, because his victim refused to die as he wanted.  I haven't tried Textchat yet, as SFE needs to be updated first, so I don't know how the text-community is right now, but I do appreciate a somewhat higher entry-requirement (install a mod) for a global textchat. 
---
besides: seen from other games i somewhat expect to read (or: not-read)  kyrillic, international servers or not.
---
Lol I guess the punches don’t sound like porn but 90% of what you hear is just men grunting lol
---
It just works.
---
I love not having a global chat channel tho. ahhhhh.
---
currently energy resist is not changed by anti-armor, but it is a glitch and may be fixed later
---
its wit for people who don't have any
---
Get my upvote sir not many are aware it does help at the starting ranks...
---
AJ is a clown. Lets Dell tell him how the game's like, watches other reviews and posts his own a month after game release because of "costume troubles"
---
Game Controllers have always been supported on the PC since the dawn of time.
---
Personally, Mouse and keyboard FTW.
---
If you enjoy something why do you care about someone reporting the news?
---
MASSIVE SPOILERS:
---
Read the terminals, the whole thing is a Simulation run by ZAX, that computer voice you hear in the lobby.
---
Have it equipped same with armor
---
I think you might need to reinstall man, I'm having none of these issues. I'm on a base PS4, and events def tank the FPS, but nothing besides that.
---
The audience is there, he’d be stupid not to make videos in it. A few of the F76 videos are some of his highest viewed videos on his channel.
---
Don’t hate.
---
This is actually good, these new players might well be people who were apprehensive about playing in the first place, with people like you showing them that the game is good and the community is friendly then people might actually give it a go in the long run
---
There is a difference beetween reporting the news and farming the views
---
That's also a bug? That one might be a feature. But yeah land mines will despawn after a couple of minutes.
---
I tried camping a house on Survival with a 2000 cap bounty and put 2 mines at the doorway. After 10 minutes no one came so I went to collect them and they're just gone. 
---
This one is extremely easy to replicate, just place a mine down and wait 5-10 minutes and it will be gone.
---
Thanks console peasants!
---
That’s what I said.
---
OMG!
---
Spec agility? 
---
Marathoner plus action boy/girl?
---
For me, switching from wireless to ethernet cable connect to my router made a big difference. Apparently some wireless routers can change your ip addy every now and then which will cause a disconnect.
---
Ah, I played the B.E.T.A. and remember it being a good level of darkness or at least not noticeably bad. I personally prefer a realistic/immersive level of darkness.
---
Change it to a canvas bag
---
Thanks! Have fun making your perfect build Overseer :)
---
I do have one more question....Can you go in alone or do you need  buddies? The reason I ask is I tend to be a loner as I am an older guy (51) who enjoys gaming and don’t have a lot of friends. I know......pitiful....lol
---
NOT everything is player icons and photoframes there is also camp plans, weapon skins, power armor skins, photo poses as well...
---
its obvious down the line... Ghouls, BoS.
---
I've literally been preaching this for months and getting nothing but hate and downvotes from the entire "oh poo no Fallout 3 remaster" fan boys. People need to think for themselves.
---
This is so funny too, because you have to admit that even if you were the most diehard fan of the game you were worried about how this particular addition would play out.  If you were cool with it or wanting it, you still felt like you had to cross your fingers, like “please be good...even if not for me, just for the game and most it’s players.”  I felt like a Battle Royale would just...well...let’s just say I have never heard anyone say they wanted it.  I swear, sometimes it can be frustrating to feel like the devs of any particular game don’t get what the people want...and then rarely, like once in a blue moon, you’re so glad they went with their gut.  Not often, but this is certainly one of those cases.  I have never personally enjoyed a Battle Royale style game, but apparently a Bethesda Royale was missing in my life!
---
Add me if you stay on. I like to run around and help people level up. Mre605rc on ps4
---
Thanks for the info, please upvote this post so others can see it too if your reading this.
---
You cannot.
---
I’m sure this has been suggested, but a ping system would be so helpful- whether to ping enemies or loot. No one is using their mic so having additional emotes or pings that we can use even while knocked would be great.
---
It’s actually fun but I actually like royales besides fortnite and apex.
---
I made Shaun for one of my alt characters. Maybe if we find each other, we can complete the prophecy.
---
&gt;I soured on the game really early—I don’t want to beat a dead horse, but I really didn’t like the lack of NPCs 
---
I'd tell you that it's a good time to get back into it. Most of the griefers have moved on and you can't even get hurt in Adventure mode anymore unless you take a workshop (and even then most folks will leave you alone) or you hit them back. The easiest way is to just make you have Pacifist on in settings.  
---
As for NPCs, I take it you did not see the E3 trailer? Human NPCs are coming in the fall with dialog trees as a part of the wastelanders DLC, all for free. Bethesda has also put a lot of effort into fixing the worst of the bugs and added quite a lot of content!
---
Hope you decide to give it another shot.
---
You missed OP's point
---
Remove all legendary weapons and armour, simple.
---
do you have ghost bullets constantly shooting around you too, animations and all? Happens to me after another player has been in the area so far. I guess it's worth trying a reinstall, the lack of background stories is really bugging me, but fuck me, another 70gb download....guess I'll play tomorrow....
---
Nothing pitiful about that. When first log in on fallout 76 and when you highlight nuclear winter there is an option to auto fill team or not just click to your liking.
---
I cannot right now, but could gladly give you 20 or so tommorow.
---
solved this problem by switching my desktop resolution to 1600x900
---
If youre crouching there isnt
---
Nope! All you need to do is go to a workbench and hit repair with components
---
Oh god I can’t bear it, I have to take my headset off during the lobby wait, why can’t people just check their social media feed or something instead or creating all that noise lol
---
If it brings people in and keeps the game healthy then I'm all for it.  There's still plenty of us that won't touch it with a barge pole.
---
Fans and typewriters. Scrap them to get lots and lots of screws
---
"Green, sweet I can place it!"  
---
"nah man, you require a foundation lol"
---
A group of people did this for me today and I was incredibly, incredibly grateful for it. Wasn't having a great day and I've always wanted to get 76, so I said fuck it why not--and I had a really great time. I ended up having one of my most memorable video game experiences to date, and I leveled up to 10 my first day! Haven't even touched the story yet, we just went exploring and grinding. As soon as I'm capable of doing this for others, I will. Thanks OP for doing what you do, and to everyone else that does this--thank you too!
---
I made a few level one hunting rifles today and have them out to anyone I could find that was low level near the vault, along with some .308.
---
No, you can use weapon or armor benches to repair relevant items.
---
You don't need them to repair, they are basically a portable way to repair. Before they were added, you needed to use a workbench to repair weapons and armour. They're not really pay to win, cause you have to go into your inventory to use it
---
My friend headshot people left and right in 2 secs using iphone in fortnite. Meanwhile, i need 15 secs to pick aluminum can with controller. 
---
It's just training i guess.
---
Have any pesky raiders attacked you and your tour group?
---
I'm the opposite. I love Fallout 3, New Vegas and Fallout 4. Played hundreds of hours of all of these games and I'm quitting Fallout 76 before the free trial is over. I'm level 12. The game is a little laggy, there's no story like Fallout 4 so it feels empty. There's no difficulty setting. I would rather just play Fallout 4. It just feels like FO4 but worse. VATS is better in the older games. I need radaway all the time and rarely find any. I enjoy playing games on easier difficulties. I don't understand why anyone would want this series to go multiplayer.
---
We’re gonna have to wait till after the br mode week is over. Everyone is grinding for those cosmetics
---
Player icon and stash box skin
---
Two shot explosive was the rage a while back.
---
My point here was to to emphasise the use of spectating as a que period. Which I thought was different enough to be its own post.
---
Icons or skins from atom shop. It's literally the image shown, not an actual crate to open.
---
Yeah but it turns out that people with "bad eye sight" (or bad monitors, or both...) like to live vicariously in Fallout as people with superhuman eyesight.
---
Looks unchanged in the ESM. Spread still multiplied by 1.5, unaffected by Class Freak.
---
yes we are getting robot companions.
---
This is the best rhyme i've ever heard

This reminds me that I’m going naked just to do the 5 wins card pack.
---
Also, because armor is for chumps and I love going Full Frontal Assault as a woman in Nukes.
---
Im a newbie to. Like the game so far, im almost positive im going to buy it. Ive always wanted an online fallout game, glad they have been fixing this game. Im only at the part where you find the lady by the river after registering as a volenteer though.
---
Ready to release my YongYea disstrack

Except when you are wearing power armour.

General Gutsy:  “Gents I wanna see those shoulders back and asses out!  This ain’t a drill!  Storm’s a comin’!”
---
He’s got a spare now, don’t he?
---
they are pretty much already doing this.
---
This👍👍
---
That sucks, man. I'm on PC and had a few issues with server disconnects but they have been fixing things. Have you let Bethesda know?
---
You don’t need others to play this, I’ve played solo since the beta and the holotapes are very atmospheric and immersive if you don’t have the distraction of other people’s voices, big events will draw in players from around the map so if you launch a nuke at fissure prime others will come and help take down the scorchbeast Queen with you but there’s definitely no barrier to playing solo and it’s totally worth it in my opinion, being solo affords you the ability to take your time and soak up all the detail.
---
I for one, would like to thank you for writing this, because I had no idea ammo crafting was a thing! That explains why I always have no ammo! I am a low level, have under 50 hours in the game over 2 accounts, currently I am doing a rifle man build cause my first I had no idea its a melee tho.
---
I'll give it a try, thanks, and I'll add it to the [Weapons](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/brdzxw/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_weapons/) bug page once confirmed.
---
hmm ill try again dont know what im doing wrong, thanks!
---
Fissure Site Prime is pretty year round I'm told. ;)
---
I'd admit...     
---
I'd love for my pages to be getting smaller...
---
The map is bugged, 80% of the time it never shows me where teammates picked until after match starts.
---
This is not your typical BR where you run slide and gun.
---
No.  FYI, you can earn repair kits in-game by killing the Scorchbeast Queen.
---
we're all different. for some reason for 30 years I always end up good two shoes in RPGs. maybe at most I'll go option three sarcasmo.
---
Agility doesn't affect AP in NW.
---
Nice, I remember captain noob did a review and couldn't kill ghouls at point blank range, it's great that Beth has balanced it better.
---
Hit me up and i'll produce the the instrumental
---
Nope nothing like that at all, very little glitches if any. I think if you have a "Reinitalize PS4" option on Xbox it might help, but I would reinstall if I were you.
---
Good to know, ty
---
I'm a fan of pumpkin soup, myself. Them PERs.
---
Again thank you the information. I do love to help other people out the game. ....esp if I see someone struggling.  I am AvgGuy42  on ...PS4....level 237)
---
Yep it really deserved a buff
---
This actually sounds like a great idea so people actually work together. I really like your idea.
---
YongYea lookin like a Zombie reporting on 76 just to get him hits
---
Anything good in the 20’s? Not far from there
---
haha tis just happend to me :D thank you bethesda.
---
Damn level 237! I'm jealous!
---
Soups are great! I recommend lowbies check out Aaronholt Homestead north of 76. The crops there are great, and there's about 8-10 cranberries you can grab. Double the yield with Green Thumb and you've got bonus XP food for a while, plus all the soup you can carry.
---
Im having the same experience. Game destroyed my expectations since they were Low Lol. The radio is god damn fantastic and the ambience music is the best in the series. Makes exploring very enjoyable.
---
No.  See the picture in my post and you'll see when they release and when they're available.  You can get the current one all week long.  The next one drops today sometime (June 12).
---
Let yourself get a feel for the game before making a character with a build. Also get action boy for early game, its needed :) what platform are you on?
---
That's what men do, though.
---
I've been getting disconnected every 2 minutes  and sometimes even faster than that. I got maybe 15-20 minutes of uninterrupted play time in the afternoon.
---
Whats an action boy? Im on PC.
---
Theres also a challenge for get X wins while naked.
---
So theres even less reason to wear the jumpsuit
---
Do you have all of the resources to repair?
---
Hope I still have one left lol. I always dumped cannonballs at train stations because I had no use for them. it's ordinance express time baby!
---
Honestly though how’s it farming? Isn’t he just talking about fresh news to do with the game?
---
I guess you're right, though in the A10s, their minigun has instant spin up, as does the vulcan mounted on hammers, choppers snap in the Hercules... The ramp down is long, not the spin up.
---
Also, on ballistic guns, it makes it easier to sync chamber trigger with barrel location i guess, once the spin is constant. So I guess there it would still kinda make sense... On energy weapons, there's no such thing. The barrels generate the beam... But since we're taking a fictional future with energy weapons, power armor, aliens and a nuclear holocaust, I'm sure technology for ballistic weapons would improve to make instant firing a reality 😉
---
Also, there's a gun in destinyA 2, Autocannon. It's a minigun which fires immediately and takes time to ramp up to full speed. It was very fun to use when I was playing that game :) I sås using it all the time.
---
Love them referring to their entire player base as “a small number of players”
---
Great ideas and I was thinking the same thing.  I’m assuming since this is a sneak peek that this will some how tie into the regular game mode.
---
Action boy is one of the first perk cards you can get, maxing it out greatly increases AP regen.
---
It's under agility.
---
I'm on ps4 sadly, I would have loved to help you though.
---
You can leave the vault and change appearance at any time, once you’ve left the vault bring up your menu (not the main start menu but the in game main), there you will see an option to “change appearance” just select that and your good to go.
---
You better get one before people realize it's a decent weapon now
---
Nope, you have to pull the trigger to start the spinning. Also while aiming down sights.
---
I think it’d be cool to have to find Vault 51 then entering it puts you into NW mode.
---
Yeah you can see emotes of enemies. I did drop some ammo to my teammate and make gift emoji, second later we was bombarded with granates and i saw gift emoji in distance from enemy player. What a great gift they gave us.
---
Thanks bro will do! 👌
---
Thanks for this, had a good laugh...
---
Yeah I feel so.
---
The guns start firing only once their barrels reach maximum velocity.
---
Same here bud. Using this free week on Xbox. Loving it so far. Only issue is it is disconnecting from the server every 20 mins or so.
---
Great advise for the new players!
---
After some time though, if you can get your hands on mutations, what i did was get carnivore. Now i basically eat everyone. I get 2x benefits of meat and don't even have to cook it anymore. Paired with Cannibal perk, you just eat all your enemies.
---
I've thought the same.
---
ooh thanks for this tip. I've been having issues with it all day.
---
Not sure, but I got 2 rewards for each level under lvl 10. Always NW perk card plus something (loot box icon, Megasloth Icon). I even had the craft plan for small box under lvl 6 (not sure on which level). On lvl 9 there is some background maybe for photo mode?
---
Welcome to WV!    
---
Man alive, I've literally had several brutal conversations in the last couple days on a couple of my posts only to discover none of the people actually played '76, just going by second hand info...   
---
At launch it had issues, but as one of the insane people from the B.E.T.A. The majority were either overblown, known issues the Youtubers "accidentally" ran into over and over (a setup) or flat out lies (the week long "nothing is encrypted debacle")
---
You dont open them, you immediately get the rewards that are inside of them just look at what stuff you have.
---
I like his reporting and holding companies responsible.  
---
I dislike it when he pounds then into ash.  
---
This game doesn’t need negative press at this point but Bethesda does of late.
---
I did 80 levels only taking generic things like carry capacity and crafting.  Wish I would have specialized a weapon type first
---
You don't. Those are not crates you open as loot. They are skins or icons from atom shop.
---
Preach
---
I felt the same, I bought this game two weeks ago for €18 and started playing it with some friends. It was the most fun I've had while playing a game for a long time.
---
&gt; **V.A.T.S.:** Now closes immediately when one of your attacks kills the targeted enemy. 
---
Directly from the patch notes. Must be a conflict with the mechanics of Gunfu and the new change.
---
When you go to hit repair, it gives you two options. Keep an eye out for which button to press.
---
&gt; Yes they will probably pull this stunt again. But how much leeway do we give them?
---
Did you play, or do you remember how fucking horrible ESO was at launch? 3 (4?) years later and it's a great game that continues bringing in new players.Yes, 76 launched in a sad state, and we shouldn't forgive them for it. But, all the free content and patches are going a long way to fixing shit, and I can appreciate that when they could have pulled an Andromeda and just blue balled us all.
---
No, your not.  That is what survival mode is.   People need to be killed so they fear for their life. That is what makes survival mode what it is.
---
I'm getting downvoted and so are you, but tonight was my first experience and I already have to try to reinstall the game (on console no less, where there's even less room to botch an install). I *do* have a feeling something was off because I seemed to have a very unique bug of not being able to see ANY text on the papers throughout the wasteland, but art loaded fine. So, I plan on updating my experience once I reinstall the game I spent last night downloading so that I could redownload it again, but let the record show, I'm not super thrilled so far.
---
So i go to atom shop to get them?
---
I was quite satisfied with him giggling like a small child while desperately trying to find something negative to say about Nuclear Winter
---
Ahhh.... no need to be. But I do appreciate it.....lol. My goal to get to 400. ......Are player levels nerf’d to accommodate the lower level players.....
---
Wonderful. Good info, thanks friend
---
YES.
---
I play mostly solo but also met this awesome guy while just exploring and we play often now :)
---
If they do any form of 3 dog I am going to have to hunt them down and kill them!
---
Yeah but it’s not even enough AP to dash across an open field.
---
I will be for sure.
---
In the atomic shop?
---
I'm on the PC in UK
---
Listen the game had issues at launch, no question, but the "tin foil hat" faction that called it an orchestrated hit job (just enough to get the hate train going) looks so much more plausible 6 months later..
---
They don't teach critical thinking anymore, it sounds silly but most people actually struggle with forming / owning an opinion..
---
If by "talking about" you mean "complaining about shit that was fixed months ago and speculating about some bullshit I heard from other Tubers", then yes. Otherwise, no.
---
If that’s the issue is there any way of getting around it that you know of?
---
Ooooooh i see it now thanks man
---
Lol nice. Bethesda is the gift that keeps on giving.
---
Dodge buff would be swell, might make it to strong without vats crits tho
---
Is it just to invite to team or both?
---
Well test it with speakers and the headset fully disconnected, don't just power it down, unplug it and or the dongle.   
---
Assuming everything sounds good, check for a software update for the heatset you have (many have proprietary software that unlocks features) or download and install said software and try it again with the headset.  
---
Oh, and look for a second volume slider on your headset and adjust it.
---
In that case, you probably want carrot soup. Same PER bonus as pumpkin (I think), but it grows faster and doesnt seem to get targeted as much as pumpkin, gourd, or the vertical plants.
---
My SteelSeries Arctis 7's had the same issue FYI
---
Was is it like that a the time?
---
suck my dick bot wow maybe not such a positive experience after all
---
I think he means Adventure, not 76.
---
Lol I'll keep playing and I'll keep posting when I find them. I'll tag you next time to make it easier.
---
21 and 24 you get weapon skin for the laser Rifle 25 is the silver victory statue like the bronze but silver 26 is a photo pose if I remember right...
---
I want an Eye-Bot I :)
---
Your right! I dont understand the ppl that watch shit about things they don't like... But the guy prob makes bank for doin it.
---
Feed the anger cause it give them some meaning their lifes i guess.
---
My nemesis is the neighbor who brings his dog over to poop right on the edge of my lawn. Going to leave a nice brown bag of fertilizer on that guys door step this week! Wont get paid for it tho.😞
---
What was the code you got when it crashes
---
Wow man, 3 platinums, Congrats!
---
One bug doesn't represent the whole game.
---
I get what you mean. We've gotten the Legendary Purveyor, but otherwise not much. BR is kind of a HUGE thing they were working on, instead of further Adventure content. 
---
I really hope Adventure gets a lot more awesome stuff. I want more quests, more areas. BR is neat, but it's not what I want.
---
You need those bottles to make uber amounts of cocktails!... You know if you like to roll play that kinda thing... Otherwise dont pick them up dummy
---
NW is the big news now. A great mode, a novelty. Obviusly people jump to play it for a while but soon there will be action again in adventure
---
Thanks man! 👍
---
Sorry, meant aim-assist, edited the post.
---
It was recently brought up and we framed the question was differently.   
---
 **Basically how they are Leaving money on the table and that they are discriminating again part of the player base, even if unintentionally.**    
---
By mentioning some very simple examples I think it made them listen.
---
-I have several ExPat friends who are non-native English speakers who can't get friend to play the game, because they don't speak English well enough to be comfortable but fluently read English.   
---
If other MMO's can show us anything it's that there are tens if not hundreds of thousands of thousands of potential players who fall into this category.      
---
-I have a few disabled internet friends who wanted to play the  game but can't or don't feel comfortable talking in game... For many even a slight stutter will keep them from jumping into '76.    
---
-Women, in 2019, make a growing portion of the player base. And without speaking out of turn **MANY** still don't want to speak in online games for fear of discrimination or harassment.   
---
More than a couple people I've traded with in game (I'm a medium to large scale Merchant) only after months of trades turned on their mic's and spoke to me for the first time, turning out to be women, because of issues they've had in other MMO's.  
---
**All of these represent lost revenue, one of them as discrimination/lack of a accommodation and the last can be seen as not providing as safe environment**.
---
You're obviously the useless one
---
I love you and these tours. this is truly a great example of awesome community.
---
Sheepsquatch, Pioneer Scouts, Arktos, The Burrows, vending machines?
---
I played it a few months after launch and I've come back to it recently. It's good with friends, and it's better once you get past the low level grind. Still has some game breaking bugs thst I'm sure you'll come across but if you take it for what it's worth and didn't pay $70 us for it then it's certainly a decent game. It just could have been so much more.
---
I did this instinctively
---
Totally meant aim-assist, not auto-aim my bad haha! Thank you, that's good to know that the gap isn't too bad at least. Maybe I'll pick it up on PC after all!
---
I played Fallout 76 the first time yesterday, and while the experience seemed stable and the fairly enjoyable, I think dismissing all the criticism the game had received is unfair.
---
To me it already feel like not having human NPCs was a big mistake for a fallout game. The quests are missing "gravitas" and is a far reach from the Fallout games that made the series great. (A mistake they seem to fix with the upcoming expansion).
---
I think it's fair to say that the overall stability has vastly improved since launch? 
---
The in game economy has also been heavily criticized. It's too early for me, and OP to tell if any of that criticism is warranted or not. 
---
Also, a lot of bad games can be  still be fun when playing with good friends. That's not to say the game is actually any good.
---
Partially.. I think higher ups dont like mods but the developers (and most others in the company)
---
want to keep em.. and the probably rushed this release for the press.
---
Idk tho
---
Looks pretty close, nice work! Something about it looks not quite right to me, though I can’t put my finger on it. Can you do a side-by-side screenshot of your character and default Nate?
---
GL friend :)
---
Won't happen because consoles.
---
You have to have 6 perception on adventure/survival mode on that character to use that perk. Seems like the idea is to get players to try out the base game to enter nuclear winter.
---
Thanks! PM me you psn name?
---
So before i start i want to make a temporary distinction until someone gets the armor and gets an exact name. So the armor in 76 i will refer to as inferno as it is the creation club model and the one from 3 as hellfire.
---
So we actually have very little info on hellfire but from what i know it is made out of duraframe like ED-E )think of it like ultracite a new strong metal) and it had systems that enhance heavy incinerators. Based off dialogue in NV and LR with ED-E and his logs.
---
The exact dialog is one sided but Whitley in a chat with colonel Autumn says 
---
"Yes sir, I understand that we need the Duraframe assets for Hellfire armor, but-no, sir. Yes, sir. I understand, sir." 
---
So i think that he means the actual Durafarme material rather then research staff as I'd assume Whitley is a Robotics expert and may not be much help with designing PA this leads me to believe it may have been based on a prewar prototype which is mentioned in vault 51. I think this log
---
"Good, you're back on-line. Listen to me, ED-E - if you stay here, they'll dismantle you for parts. You have to go now."
---
Supports the idea it was more related to actual material then RnD especially because in with Broken steel the suits are still fairly rare with even sigma squad an elite unit only has the leader in one.
---
So if the armor isn't called hellfire and isn't made of Durafarme it is as the terminal in vault 51 a prototype which was later improved and completed in 3.
---
Is that a gamepad thing?if so I then I don't know
---
It's my username on reddit NotBanned_
---
Check stats?
---
I can't grow crops where I'm at, really. There's very little dirt. Plus I think the pumpkins are cute.
---
I play solo so I don't have to talk to people and at least I know I will help me unlike most "teammates".
---
Seen a review for nuclear winter on a gaming site yesterday (wish I could remember which one) that said the br mode was on OK addition in an otherwise boring and dead game.
---
I mean wtf man he didn't even touch on any of the other additions or improvements to the game.
---
From the main menu go to social and invite them there. Then queue for a match.
---
All great, but if that's all we get, and NW gets all the attention, I'm going to be unhappy.
---
It wasn't just Youtube. It was pretty much every reviewer out there *and* the majority of people that actually played it during launch.
---
Now you can dismiss all that criticism as unfair and whatnot but what do you expect from the average consumer? 
---
"The vast majority is saying this game sucks but what the hell, I'm just going to spend $60 of my hard earned money in the off chance they are all wrong because I'm a strong independent mind?"
---
That's not realistic.
---
+1
---
Thanks, gotta try this later.
---
I was actually planning to go cannibal myself...
---
Yeah well, I'm not throwing $60 on something I don't need when almost everyone is saying the thing sucks and isn't worth the money. 
---
Maybe you people have more disposable income than I do.
---
At this point I'm having fun but I'm still not sure it's worth the €35 at the end of the week.
---
U/nwordcountbot
---
Thanks, haven't explored this place yet. Just the farm south of the Vault.
---
Even if my CAMP is basically a corn field now, extra XP sounds nice...
---
Yeah, most of the people hating on the game, how glitchy it was... Were talking about the beta. A beta that was supposed to be glitchy...
---
My psn is Deathsh. You should hit me up.
---
Just be real, you really wanna leave the /s off
---
Can't wait to see your data! I've been testing my own weapons and found a strange anomaly to TSE weapon. I know the effects have been nerfed (and wrongly so in comparison to 2000+dmg melee??), but it's strange that the dmg amount shown on weapon does not quite tally with actual hit listed. My normal explosive weapon dmg listed was more or less what I got on hit listed.
---
you say that like it's a bad thing. Malcolm Reynolds,  naked in fallout? ... I'm going to need to see a picture though. ...for science.
---
I dont like the idea of action boy being mandatory just to play the mode.
---
I'm a big fallout fanboy and bought it despite the guy at GameStop telling me not to. I kept an open mind about it and came in knowing it was going to be an MMO and I probably wouldn't be "the hero".
---
It's been enjoyable. Level 21 and broke as a joke but there is something just so satisfying about the hunting rifle this time around.
---
What level is the hot rod laser paint at?
---
XO-2 is mentioned too...
---
Maybe you could call one in to strafe around a certain spot for some time from a radio tower or something.
---
Oh, no there is another one,'I think a 1 point card that cuts the sprint cost in half
---
i just got a fresh piece from the purveyor. it says +25 rad resist and it doesnt show in the stats and doesnt work.
---
From a practical side of things, Pharma farma is very handy to have early on. You'll be swimming in stimpaks and anything you don't use, you can sell. 
---
Also, a tip that isn't expressed in the game too well, when you level, you don't have to pick a perk from the stat you just raised, e.g you can raise the strength stat but choose a perk card in agility during a level up. It's a handy when you want to raise a stat to accommodate a perk card you already have but because of poor luck,  you are lacking in perks for a different stat.
---
In a similar vein, when I first started, i didn't actually level myself up until level 10. During the first 10 levels, you get a perk pack every 2 levels. After that it's every 5. So to cut down on getting duplicates, I wait til level 10, opened the perk packs, then filled in the blanks with cards that were available. It doesn't take too long to get to 10 and the early critters are fairly easy.
---
Bought it and cannot use it. Fml
---
Don't know, but assume it's a overseer lvl reward
---
And camp items.
---
And the slapping of flesh
---
I get this when I spawn inside a rock face.  
---
Aside from the bug it's impressive to see how the map is built up of so many moving parts.
---
Yes, this. I hate that it sounds like I’m taking damage even though I’m not!
---
Haha.
---
I like both 76 and new Vegas.
---
Being able to actually play without VATS freed up so many perks
---
Can confirm Entomologist is bugged. Can't complete 'Path to Enlightenment' switched server 3 times and never got credit for it. FML.
---
Is Nate the new Gary?
---
No it’s not. I’m the same. I have zero interest in killing other players. You’re not wrong: it really limits options!
---
I like the short ap. It makes you really think about where to find the next cover. It can suck in a heated battle or running from the storm, but it's a risk versus reward type thing and the maps not that big. Pubg I can spend the a whole game just running to get to the center and still die.
---
I've never had much issues until this recent patch. Then server disconnects mid game for no reason.
---
"Not only how to survive" If they're on Survival, they're dead after playing for more than an hour or two cause of the BS leaderboard system. If they're on Adventure, it's actually a literal joke to survive, you'd have to have dementia or be incredibly young of a player to struggle. 
---
I guess I kinda of did the same thing for one person once, except I was on Survival, and I helped him to the first town, and as my final lesson, i said "Now look to the sky, do you see where the sun is?" Then I shot him in the back of the skull, t-bagged his body, then put 20 Stimpaks, a Stealthboy, and a dozen Frag grenades into his loot bag on the ground and told him "Don't trust fucking anyone on Survival, you're welcome!!" and skipped away.
---
Not sure they have that yet. This isn't even a beta, it's just a preview. So not surprised if something like that is entirely missing.
---
Plot twist
---
You can have both on at the same time
---
Foods stack, only chems and booze are one at a time
---
At overseers lvl 5 you will get an actual container, that can be built in your camp, but the other 3 containers, that you will get as rewards until overseer lvl 10 are just player icons, that can be claimed in the atomic shop. They are called small, medium and epic crate and the icons look like the actual crates, so its kinda confusing. You will get a few more containers and objects that can be built in your camp on higher overseer levels.
---
Sums it up for me lol
---
You are an awesome human bean!!
---
Ive been trying to help the noobs, but so far they have all ran away from me :( apart from 1, he shouted at me and questioned what i was doing there! so i blew a raspberry down the mic and ran off....
---
I added a video of that.
---
Can we just appreciate how cool the map looks without trees. Looks like Scotland
---
I think you had a glitch rendering in..  
---
A couple posts over that past few months looked like this, basically nothing rendered.  
---
Respect the desire to get it attention and fixed, but unless you reproduce it, it might be a one off.  
---
And don't be an alarmist...   
---
You won't be banned for posting a bug/glitch in a constructive way, however providing all the steps to reproduce it in a post, and encouraging people to use exploits would get you in trouble ;)
---
Yeah can you imagine Fallout players that like having deep interactions with NPCs and branching storylines?
---
Tod stood on stage and promised them they would get a solid solo experience to a fanbase that is known to love a good solid solo experience. That wasn't delivered. And now you guys are acting like that community was in the wrong.
---
As a PC player not using a controller I prefer having them auto-favorite to =.
---
Don't buy ammo unless it's from a player camp at 1cap each.  At your level you probably haven't even done enough or visited enough places to accumulate that much.  Believe me though, unless you're using automatic weapons, you're going to have ammo flowing out of  your eyeballs soon enough.  If you ARE using automatic weapons, you should tag lead in your pipboy for scrap and then make your own.
---
There *is* a mod that introduces a text chat, but that's a band-aid solution more than anything, since both parties need to have the mod in order to send and receive.  Native text chat really should be a thing.
---
yw
---
Oh, and no joke, did you submit a bug report?   
---
If not get to it!
---
If someone left a paper bag of crap on my bed I would be upset but if someone left a massive duffel bag full of crap on my bed I would be really upset
---
Thanks for the tip. I’m not using auto weapons but just pipe weapons until I can get a decent melee build going
---
I just use the auto heal button
---
Edit: didn't realize console doesn't have that
---
Do you play on PC? If yes, do you have Text Chat Mod. If no, why?
---
Neither should be mandatory just to fucking run
---
 Not anymore
---
If it’s an atomic store item then yes
---
I mean TBF when it first came out (when they reviewed it) it was a flaming piece of garbage. A year of free updates later and its finally playable
---
Never buy off robot vendors. If you must buy, buy off players. They can sell bullets at 1 bullet per cap or even 2 bullets per cap.
---
Give it time, eventually you pick up enough ammo scavenging. Find a melee weapon and use that when you can, will allow you to save up ammo. Like if 1 enemy, you can use melee vs an entire swarm of them. 
---
If you can scavenge a bunch of gunpowder, steal and lead, you can make your own at a Tinkers workbench . Eventually you can get perk card ammo smith to produce more ammo as well as Super Duper to 2x anything you craft.
---
As far as making caps, vendors have a combined pool of 1400 caps every 20hrs. Sell to them everything you don't need. Gets you 1400 daily. Pick up everything you see and sell, sell , sell!
---
Because the game engine setup for Anti-Armor was only designed with DR in mind, there is no comparable ER switch.
---
You probably should but the sickos wouldn't allow you. Instead they want you to suffer in the wasteland and watch you drink toxic water, eat ghouls and get mauled by bloody mole rats.
---
To be fair us scots and the Irish are just fucking nuts all round lol
---
Yeah, nice try.
---
[SHAUN!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAhG9D9UO7c)
---
It's not mandatory, and your special effects your ability to run longer, but if you really want to haul arse you've got to dedicate some perk cards into it.    
---
As much as you think it sucks, there is balance there.
---
Now THAT... is awesome!
---
I can see why, the game is already too easy, why be given a crap load of resources and make it even more trivial. The only real resource i've come to run out of a lot inthis game at level 40-50 is Aluminum and Lead
---
I sell broken ones! (You cant sell made ones)

---
People (including myself) should learn to not compare FO76 to FNV, ever.
---
Its not the same, it’ll never be better. A lot of people I see continue to compare everything to FNV. That golden age is over lol
---
Where can I see all of the perk cards so I can plan ahead?
---
Can you grab some Gifs or screenshots to show the differences?
---
Yes, but anecdotal is all we have at the moment. I can’t see server population activity from my computer - can you?
---
I’ve logged into adventure mode twice in the last 24 hours. First time there were five players and vendor camps. Second time there were two vendor camps, and about six players under level 15 around Flatwoods.
---
Just because something is anecdotal, it’s doesn’t invalidate the point, experience or observation being made. Your point is as anecdotal as anyone else’s. It’s not invalid, it’s just what you saw. 
---
Same here.
---
To follow up on this, I tested turning off my shared nuka shine power armor skin and the issue went away. So it might be related to that :)

I saw someone’s workshop with the stash boxes today so they are an in game item :)
---
How do we know what camp items? Is there a place where we can see a list of everything we received?
---
The grumpy gits of r/fallout aren't liking it because newbies look for a fallout sub and find r/fallout as their first result and the sub is getting swamped with people saying how much they're enjoying the game.  
---
Makes me smile :)
---
A lot of people just don't have them.  I'm not much of a multi-player gamer, so there's normally no need.  Fallout 76 exists in this weird space where I wish it was single player but I play it anyways.  :|

[This code works, date is different due time zones.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bz90sr/nuke_launch_codes_june_12th_to_june_18th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ios_share_flow_optimization&amp;utm_term=control_2)
---
No, the kill wouldn’t be credited until the player is actually killed. So player A downs enemy B, player C (A’s teammate) finishes B off. Only then is A credited with the kill.
---
If B is revived before C finishes them off, there’s no kill to credit.
---
It's not either / or, there are teams working on each portion, and [I promise I'm not blowing smoke](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/byrtju/bethesda_hears_us_i_know_because_being_an/).
---
Pretty sure Beth broke this mod a while back :(
---
No special points do not effect your ability to run. This is repeated several times in game. I think it's part of the problem. The game has us set to the base default AP with no boost from our stats so we never are able to run
---
You just pointed out my biggest problem with BR games. I got into the top 10 in on the last one I played (not NW) by just waiting for it to auto-kick me from the air drop, then deploying my shoot as early as possible to take the maximum time reaching the ground. That was a 100-man BR, and just by _not playing_ for as long as possible, I made the top 10. Kind of disillusioned me to the concept.
---
It's a brahmin cow.
---
I have been handing out the brother hood sniper rifle. Can make it for lvl 1s.
---
They have different teams working on portions of the game, most studios do that,[I got to chat with them](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/byrtju/bethesda_hears_us_i_know_because_being_an/).
---
Survival is still in beta. It’s a great mode, unfortunately a bit unbalanced atm if you have a brand new character, that said, hopefully we see Bethesda talk more about updates to it and bringing it out of beta soon
---
Myself, and people I play with are all hoping when it comes out of beta where everyone has to start a new character at lvl 1 and can’t bring anything into the mode. 
---
Thank you for the code, I launched my first nuke yesterday!
---
At overseers lvl 5 you will get an actual container, that can be built in your camp, but the other 3 containers, that you will get as rewards until overseer lvl 10 are just player icons, that can be claimed in the atomic shop.

You will get a few more containers and objects that can be built in your camp plus more player icons and frames on higher overseer levels.
---
Training, I never use vats in game so now that I'm playing against people who always rely on vats but can't use it I can pick them off left and right
---
Its soooo repetitive and boring, why do people still watch the content, its easy and low effort
---
Ahhh missed that, sorry got to play and Alpha build and have been out of town this week so haven't seen what's different.   
---
Valid point then.. Odd
---
It is back with the new patch. Random as anything on how it suddenly occurs or goes back to normal.
---
No mods, deleted ini files to get game to reset them. Scan and repair game.
---
Took all my gear off, logged out, logged back in. Wore coat first, was fine, then added apparel one at a time, got to my Left leg armor and coat was see through again, thought I have found the problem. Tried repeating and next time it was under armor that triggered the problem. No matter how many times I try I now cannot get a repeatable way of triggering the coat problem.
---
BTW I do not normally log out in 3rd person, but when I do all the clothes come off before logging off, is that normal to log off naked?
---
Since patch I also have dashes on upper part of screen, can be seen in pictures and that is something new.

Phbyea maybe you do, but I had a few knock downs where I got them to a slither of health and someone snipped it from me, and also I sont think dieing outside the storm counts, I knocked a guy down and he died in the storm and it said in the kill log I killed him but no xp
---
there are some really good melee perk cards in nw. with stealthboys being semi easy to find, melee is a real option for those with the skill.
---
Actually can you not use your wearables from adventure mode?
---
Its good to see the new people coming on board and enjoying it.  the game had some real issues when it started but is in a better place now
---
Sweet, thanks!
---
I just need to get better on my aim. I've never been good at PvP for 76 but overall I'm loving it what little I've played. It's a good side mode from the main story of 76
---
Don't focus on META, that's boring as hell and removes much of the fun that can be had by trying different things out....     
---
I hit level 300 8'ish weeks in (yes I need an Intervention) and deliberately ignored the META.    
---
There are tons of great examples, but one is pistol builds, people are still sleeping on VATS crit pistol builds and they can be a ton of fun.
---
Kinda not true the game is grey...very grey with tints of red. Bright white will stand out more. the jump suit on the other hand has a bit of gold that is the problem but harder to spot then a naked model. Half the time IDK who's shoting at me
---
For me, theres a bug where vats stays on, two seconds after the enemy is dead, so I end up staying on vats, vats’ing a dead body. Super annoying bug. I play on PS4. Does anyone else experience this?
---
Get any cool unlocks for lvling up or us it all just perk cards and player icons?
---
Still doesn't work :/
---
Give it a few more days and someone will hopefully uncover every NW perk card from data mining on PC, that’s how we find out most of these things.
---
Yeah or just give us the smoke grenades that you get from the vertibot stations in certain workshops. They suck but could be great game strat. I watch the scorch-beast at the end for it to start launching sonic waves at players  hiding in bushes, if vertibots could do the same as that it would be nice
---
Yay! This encouraged me to give two new players full sets of armor, basic guns and ammo, water and food. It's literally nothing to my junk pile. I throw away and sell most leather I get anyway... They seemed most happy :)
---
Live in Malaysia. I can download and play but gosh, it has been horrendous. No Asia server (not that I can see? from windows resource monitor and ip connected), ping is always above 180ms.
---
 Welcome back!    
---
     
---
Screen dashes have been there for 3 patches (honest) so not a new issue, but will include it in my round up.  
---
Could you get a picture of what it looked like, and specifically what pieces of armor, every single piece, and what "size" it was please, because the "ArmorAddon" records change for different size armors, and the rendering controls are on that portion of the record.
---
Unless it's silenced that sniper weapon will be your downfall. Any non silenced weapon will have ghouls and other enemies (I hate mole rats!) hone in on you.
---
I run a sneak pistol build for entire game and you basically need to crouch everywhere you go. Don't envy the guys in melee and power armor. To each their own buddy.
---
the Possum badges are really really hard
---
I know very little about the mothman, but there are different types.
---
On PS4 it returns to normal when world is fully loaded
---
A rabbit each.
---
The vendors have a shared caps pool that refreshes every 20 hours. That pool is 1400 caps (and 150 scrip but that's for later). 
---
In the early stages of the game, you're probably not going to be able to farm 1400 caps a day, but you should be able to do a fair bit.
---
And funnily enough, farming is often a great way to get bulk caps early. Green Thumb is an early perk card that will double the amount of flora you collect. Base yourself somewhere like the Aaronholt Homestead or some other farm, with a lot of resources and you can make a lot of food, very quickly. 
---
This food, in turn, can be sold in bulk to vendors, so a quick farming/cooking expedition can make you a couple of hundred caps in about 10 minutes. At the early stages, before you're scrapping bulk weapons, wood is going to be a limiting factor on your cooking exploits - a tip is to find wood in the forests using third player perspective. You'll find you double your speed of collecting wood through this method.
---
I thought data mining was when they take the game code and interpret the data (meaning they could figure it out without having to play and unlock in the game).
---
Maybe it feels wrong when it is taken out of context like in the mode now. Yes there are power hungry vault dwellers, whom will forge a deal with the commies if they have to.
---
But when we get it released and explore vault 51, maybe there will be a little background.
---
Also when you look at it as simulation, it is not as violent.
---
I love it can't get enough...
---
I just started streaming this game today for the first time, and no one came in my channel for 2 hours straight! The only message I received was "game play is horrible in 3rd person", and nothing else. The problem is that... I am having thee most fun I have ever had streaming with Fallout76, and their battle royale is friggen AMAZE BALLS ! This game is really really fun and i'm having the time of my life playing it.
---
Yes, yes, no as far as i’ve seen, and yes
---
I don't get why people need special statuses like that, it comes off elitist to me.
---
Being vocal about it has worked in the past though and will continue to work. Of course I don't think Reddit is the majority but the vocal mi ority is all that is needed.
---
I won't accept it and I don't understand why anyone else does or worse, defends the companies for their shitty practices.
---
You can enter buildings? Those with loading screens?
---
Or sprinting costs nothing.
---
Not yet. I’ve played both in a team and solo and the best I’ve done so far is 6th when I was solo and I died because I was taking out a guy in power armour and was hit from behind by a shotgun. Plus, I’m shit at BR, so I suspect others will be able to solo a win.
---
I haven't played it yet, so I can't comment but is that really the hill you're willing to die on?
---
No never found a pipe rifle before
---
Is it though?
---
No, but interiors like houses and such
---
No I went back and checked, still full of clickbait garbage.
---
Not the rifle. The human merchants.
---
You summed it up perfectly I couldn’t agree more, even if they’re not human NPCs at least something that biologically alive for gods sake lol
---
Yea seen Them before 😉 have s spot where it spawns often
---
It's feasible that you could just "run" a server when starting a singleplayer mode. Some games start up a local server in the background for singleplayer. 
---
I'm not saying that would, could or should I'm just saying that it is feasible to do.
---
I really wish that subreddit got some better management, it's absurd how often daily hate threads come up. It's such an unpleasant place.
---
I wondered if it was new, just have never found them before!
---
Im normally very nice to other players, but sometimes lessons must be learned...
---
No idea about the list. And can only say about the small supply stash, which is right below the regular stashbox.
---
I haven't progressed much.
---
Sadly not when I played. Maybe an Xbox Xclusive feature I guess =/
---
Make them blast Ride of the Valkyries across the map.
---
The story isn't you fetching anything, you're following a trail left behind by someone? Same as NV except not predictable.
---
Thank you for the heads up! It was changed for me and now it works!
---
Thank you this is super helpful
---
I've got the same issue, I'm level 79 and nuclear winter keeps telling me I've leveled up in adventure mode. But switching to adventure doesn't show any exp gain.
---
Consoles actually have a way to chat using the console system. PC has no way at all for chat in game.
---
I hope i would stumble upon you. Just started downloading 76 :D
---
Does it show anywhere my total available points in each special?
---
Or when you place a floor or wall down and can no longer remove it causing you to move you're base just so it resets it all. That shits getting annoying lol
---
Or maybe you *will* throw them away.
---
So I could be playing as Mr. 5-by-5?
---
I love Fallout 76 and I’m going to be honest and say the game was pretty bad to begin with. It wasn’t as awful as YouTube reviews made it out to be but Bethesda really dropped the ball on it. 
---
I’ve been playing since the first day of BETA and have had so many problems and bugs that either prevented me from playing or made me so frustrated I put the game down for a week. My game even deleted itself, twice... 
---
I still love the game though and kept playing. I’m excited for new content and more improvements. I think though that the game as it is after the last patch is what is should’ve been at release.
---
TBH I played this game and had a lot of problems with it. I returned my copy (to his actual owner lol)
---
Now, I see where the game is at and I'm buying a copy for myself. They did good. Plus, I'm hyped for NPCs, that's everything I wanted for the game for me.
---
You can see the SPECIAL points you've allocated to your character in Adventure/Survival mode in the perk card screen and in your PipBoy under STATS &gt; SPECIAL.
---
I checked the atomic shop today expecting to claim my PA skin and was very confused. Thanks for clearing that up.
---
OP, you can listen to people or you can listen to the wiki. This game works basically off the Fallout 4 engine so we can use the information from there.  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage\_Resistance](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance)  
---
The main thing to pay attention to is at the very bottom concerning armor piercing. Basically because damage is relative to armor and the scaling is not linear so the 40% AA you get from some mods is basically 20% damage and the 50% you get from the legendary effect is basically a 29% damage. 
---
The reason this really matters is because the reported damage boost from furious is like 30%, but that is damage that ramps up. So you get x% per shot you land up until a max. This mean that AA is almost always better than Furious. 
---
TL:DR AA is the best thing in game next to Bloody, Furious and TS are about the same unless fighting at range or boss monsters in which case Furious is better.
---
It's just the best isn't it? Even though I'm level 155, I still have players giving me stuff, and I have so much love for that. I had a guy do an event with me who was at 326 and he just dropped 2, 3* legendaries and a heap of aid items for me and another person did the same thing at my Camp. The community is awesome and I always pay it forward with other players &lt;3 I can't count the amount of times I've put myself between a high level enemy and a lower level player who's got themselves into a bit of a situation. Once it's all sorted, I'll always drop a bunch of stuff for them to help them out. Being a regular player it's also nice to see the same GTs out in the world too, like; oooo dang I remember you from last week, you revived me when a damn Glowing Deathclaw snuck up on me. Much love to ya'll! The Wasteland may be all jacked up but us Vaulties are still showing the love &lt;3
---
Thanks yah I could see the ones in pip boy. But don’t recall seeing it on the perk screen. Will check again later in case it was a glitch in game or in my eyes
---
Honestly this game has a great community, I found 2 guys on New Years and me and my gf spent the night playing with them wanting to launch a nuke but they didn’t work, but we had fun doing stuff, traded a bunch of items, they even built me a fusion generator cause I don’t know the plans yet. 
---
Seeing all this good stuff makes me happy to get back into the game after some time.
---
Invisible supermutant, deathclaw or something big like that. It punched you.
---
Good to hear. Thanks.
---
Atomic store items only, unfortunately. :'(
---
Yeah I’ve been doing the same being somewhat of a seasoned tour guide &amp; showing them a good time.
---
Amazon has em for $17, join us friend
---
No, the ground was shaking only inside the station. Not following me. Again and again only inside.
---
Well you are not the only one helping, but it is good to point this out so others can follow example. 
---
As I cannot use mic so much, I just use "newbie kit method". It hapens I collect ammo I am not using .10 or .38 or  .44 as well as other gear you can sell or just drop. 
---
If I see lowlevel, just craft it level apropriate weapon with 500+ammo and set of leather deep pocketed armour + 20-50 stimpacks + spare plans. Nothing special, just redirecting abudance to ones who may need it. 
---
I never wait for thank you. I am not helping becouse I want to be praised. 
---
I am helping becouse I can. 
---
Maybe, one day, they will return the favour.
---
I did buy some items from atom store in the past. But can’t see anything in my apparel section of the pip boy.
---
Yeah I feel u on something feeling a little off, still tweaking things but it’ll never be exact. [Here’s ](https://i.imgur.com/Plodruo.jpg)the side-by-side

His reviews are biased and skewed towards popular opinion. When has he ever given a score that contradicts the popular opinion? All he does is maintain his channel with safe reviews.
---
It was always fun to play but people overexaggerate the launch issues. Surely there were a bunch but a lot are fixed and which multiplayer online game doesn't have issues at launch?
---
This message is actually on a terminal in Morgan Towns Vault Tec University, weird to think it was a hint at a BR mode.
---
You must "NW Favorite" them first (by pressing "Enter" key on that specific item in the atomic store page) in order to see those costumes in your pip boy.
---
hope this will help :)
---
Got some tips for items with a good weight/value ratio for the bots?
---
I usually just sell them my chems (chems are bad kids, mkay...), packs of cigaretts, alcohol and silver/gold watches.
---
Junk items or bulk seem not worth the effort for a cap or two.

Sometimes the dead deathclaw is named "Traveling Merchant"

Jump into the Atom Store and favorite the items you have unlocked that you want to wear :)
---
Some console shooter games have aim-assist features built in. FO76 does not add any. VATS is the closest you’ll get and it’s available to gamepad and keyboard users. I play on game pass as good as I do keyboard. If you feel handicapped using a gamepad vs keyboard you probably are lol
---
So many jumpsuited, party hat level 2's roaming around the forest. I've been getting them to follow me to the overseers camp and making them some low level goodies. 
---
Most just seem to want to want to explore themselves which is understandable. Others run off as soon they see me, so maybe longshoreman's outfit and a sack hood is a bad idea haha.
---
Nope, no VPN.
---
Not 100% on this but i think 4 floors is the max
---
Random encounter. Always be in the game at random locations.
---
What platform are you? On PS4 we could team up. I play melee (Lvl 8) and usually leave all the ammo behind...
---
Another tip besides crafting yourself is to carry two guns with different ammo types, e.g. a pipe- and a combat rifle.
---
Plus a melee weapon for the easy stuff like radroaches...
---
It's still boring.
---
That's about right. I think data mining is the only way we'll find out, no player is going to get enough Overseer rank-ups to unlock every perk card in this 7-day sneak-peek given how slowly new cards are unlocked.. Bethesda could tell us with the full release perhaps.
---
Even without perk cards, melee weapons will do a good job at your early level.
---
Glad to see other players helping too, I've been doing the same helping new players  well before the free week came but I've been upping my game since this week started.
---
Never thought of giving tours but I have made sure they get a good start with decent armour, weapons etc.... I've even gave a few newbies some low level legendaries in my travels, warned them which areas are no goes till a certain lvl.
---
Keep up the good work fellow wastelander and I hope it encourages others to do the same as us
---
Thank you mate
---
I suppose our status is the high levels we hold and the gear with have. 
---
I was bewildered by some of the beta players outfits and gear at launch. Made me feel like I was far behind, but I was something to aim for.
---
Check Ebay, Amazon. Chances are you will get it for under $20. I bought it for $12 in December. I still don't play it because it's boring, the quests are uninspiring etc. but who knows, I might play it one day anyway.
---
My platform is Xbox but thank you for the  invitation for a possible team up
---
Until 17th. It's only a free trail ver and you can play for 7 days.
---
They either stalk you or they try to kill you. They’re very rare, an Easter egg creature.
---
The lower level ones stalk, and the higher ones kill.
---
Mothmen however, do chain spawn, meaning that if you’ve found one, you will probably find one again soon.
---
Gotcha thx
---
no prob :)
---
Dont think its mentioned above but it might be worth mentioning about the pipboy light for dark areas. I didnt know I had one when I first started playing.
---
I can’t even listen to the negativity of any online YouTube person. Doesn’t even matter the topic.
---
It’s not super clear with all the colours and the numbers themselves are quite small!
---
Plattform?
---
Some people say pistols work for them or unequipping all perk cards works, but neither is working for me. It's annoying as I love the mechanic, but it's not game breaking. I've just replaced it for now, as a mod said it should be fixed with the next patch :-). 
---
With they'd play test before releasing though lol.
---
Just wait, you are calling it too early. Game is quite fun, at the beginning, but when you will be aware of all the flaws and the boring endgame.....
---
Not everyone has the patience of a saint when it comes to seeing the same question being asked multiple times a day, when there's a very handy search bar right there.
---
But, I'll try again: [Is this worth buying or coming back to - the definitive answer is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bn33ul/is_this_worth_buying_or_coming_back_to_the/?utm_source=reddit-android)
---
This a carry over of a bug in adventure mode, if you get dropped from a server and your team mate doesn't log back in, you're boned.  
---
Takes 5-10 minutes for the social system to timeout of being part of a team.
---
 Are those pictures below enough, everything I was wearing and last two are updates pics of how it looks, but basically same as old pictures? Lost me, not sure how you get size :)
---

---
Chess set. I recognize that easily
---
I have seen the two background and only can assume one is constant ping which is why ppl get kicked with less then ok Internet. Also it could be thier version of punkbuster like program.
---
I do know if you jump into the NW mode it wipes your ini to presumably prevent lowlifes from sneaking in vats or something
---
Cool never seen it before
---
Crit Build Auto Weapons are very good, Explosive lasers are very good, Tesla guns are best.
---
If you want to PVP, definitely steer clear of heavy guns. Guns like the QE harpoon are decent but you’ll need a Tesla if you don’t want to get massacared by the SB+T meta.
---
Maybe in future you wont be a sheep..
---
My only .INI mod is to turn the damn main menu music off. If Bethesda boot me for that then I'll just stop playing. On all of my accounts.
---
This and also "teammates" that rush to container and pickup all the ammo and stims... Don't take more that you need! Or at least share!
---
Frog Legs + M79 = Win.
---
Don’t even aim, rush people, you’ll never die. I’m now level 32 and I have about 40 wins.
---
Came here expecting this reference. Was not disappointed.
---
Thanks you Good info !
---
Go to any train station and look for the 3 posters inside.  Read them to start the Pioneer, Nukashine, and Sheepsquatch quests.  Also check out the Burrows in Harpers Ferry.  The legendary vendor is here now too.  You can sell your old legendary items at a machine at train stations and turn in the currency it gives you (scrip) at the train station NW of Harpers Ferry to roll for more legendary items.
---
Yep, you totally can.  
---
I'm currently using Long Shot (P1), Picklock (P1), Tank Killer (P6), Lifegiver (E1), Team Medic (C6), Hacker (I1), and Pharma Farma (L1)
---
Also also remove that beam spliter! It hits x4 causing you gun damage to degrade x4.. But it does not seem to register 4 hits. So for now im going with high rof close quarters laser rifle. Get the job done and has 30 shots per reload.
---
It need something tho.. AA or double the ammo per reload. Its taxing running laser right now.
---
Drop ricochet, it’s nigh useless in this game, and change Sluggers to Gladiators. Combat knives swing much faster and have better dps overall.
---
Now i understand the username
---
The ability to override startup preload has been blocked to close a loophole in Battle Royale.
---
As such we can no longer load custom fonts in Adventure Mode.
---
Alternative means to do so would be much appreciated given that the mod ban should not apply to all game modes.
---
xd
---
I'm not doing one handed weapons, from what I have seen they are worse than two handed and unarmed. Swing speed doesnt bother me.
---
Lastly, drop Solar powered and pick up adamantium.
---
My auto Vampire/Firerate laser rifle is incredibly good with beam splitter
---
I can tank 3 pylons with it easily without a single death easily. It takes 5-8 shots for me to heal from 10% to 100%. Fire rate is very fast and recoil is almost non-existent makes it very easy to hit with or without VATS. If I want damage i can use other guns like railway rifle or auto tesla.
---
Highly recommended.
---
If thats true check the crossbow also. It has ammo you have a chance to gather so it seems in the same vein.
---
through the leveling we find out more about the story in the holos
---
Also, check out [this page](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Bucket_List) for info on how to start the questline to get your camera.
---
Also, ricochet seems like a great perk, what is bad about it?
---
Don't go overboard with charisma and intelligence. If you're not on a team, charisma 4 is enough for maxed out Lone Wanderer, and Intelligence slightly higher so you can craft/repair things well, and maybe for the added durability of Gunsmith, which needs to be equipped when your in combat.
---
Yongyea especially! For months he was just doing Fallout 76 vids, shitting on the game and people are lapping it up in the comments, many of which haven't played the game because of his videos, and many others like it, or haven't played since launch.
---
Adam's apple owner here: still difficult!
---
It's a power armour build, adamantium is 100% useless.
---
Whoever told you that lied, the DPS matters most on mobs, not a raw swing. With Bloodied, you’ll be doing 500 damage and you’ll melt anything anyhow. Source: Have a similar build, and Every class of Bloodied Melee Weapon.
---
Nice build! The whole perk system really sets Nuclear Winter apart from other BR’s, Bethesda is on to a winner here if what we’re playing this week is pre-beta!
---
the residents of vault 76 (us) are very competitive and would want to become overseer just because we can
---
This is why its slow to progress. 2/3 of ppl already have a way to bypass this.😞
---
I’ve been making level 1 brotherhood recon rifles with super duper and passing them out like candy at 76. Everyone loves them.
---
Forget a PA build and use unyielding armor set. Bloodied is junk in PA.
---
No this time when it blue screened I was just waiting for a invite and it did it
---
You actually need new mad scientists as you executed the last ones when the science wing needed to be "purged".
---
I was playing with the bright yellow paper bag mod since november. Disabled all mods to play nuclear winter and my god it sucks trying to find these bags.
---
It’s reflect, not deflect, you still get 100 percent of the damage on yourself, and the damage you dealt with the perk has no armor penetration, so it’s close to 10 points of damage each time it procs
---
Okay, cool. Thank you. I'll rank up more and see if I get it then.
---
Look at me.. Im the overseer now!
---
You must increase your special stats in adventure/survival mode first.
---
Currently, you'll need to go into Adventure or Survival mode to allocate your special stats. I could see that changing at some point, but that's the way it is now.
---
You need to level up in adventure mode in order to add to your SPECIALs, then you can equip 2/3 point cards in whatever slots you have them for
---
Can't stand the guy, don't know why people watch him.
---
How many hours do you have on it?
---
My 2 cents...
---
* A kill gets you 20XP - if you have taken 50% of that life one should therefore get 50% of the XP.
---
* A smaller bonus (5XP) should be awarded to the person who did the final killing blow to the downed enemy.
---
It already has a story line, quite a long one.  
---
Did you not follow the quest pointers?
---
What ammo do you need?
---
I can't remember it off the top of my head ill have to download it again and see
---
I've had to do the same for my Brother-in-law, he doesn't have a great deal of money for games so he chooses carefully. Safe to say that FO76 wasn't the top of his list when it came out.
---
Now that this free trial is out he's jumped on, I've taught him what I could having sunk days into the game and tried to kit him out for the next few levels.
---
We played for a few hours so he must have enjoyed it, hopefully I have a new regular to play the game with.
---
You missed this at the top of the FO76 reddit page...
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning)
---
Yeah, that helps a lot. At a glance, your character’s head seems to be too tall an narrow. While it has been a while since I’ve played around with the character creator, that should be a pretty quick fix that would make it much closer to the original model.
---
Why are you ppl not eating dogfood!
---
Oh no, I'm back for the BR not the base game grind :(
---
Oh, I remember back in the day when you got the decontamination shower on the second floor wether you liked it or not. Those were the days of hardships. We had to walk to...
---
I'll show myself out.
---
He also made over 90 videos on death stranding alone. A game that isnt even close to releasing.
---
He also only reviews things on release which means he is literally the worst person to listen to when it comes to anything MMO related. He was horribly wrong about ESO and it's repeating just the same yet again with Fallout 76. Both games started out messy but look at ESO being one of the current best MMOs on the market; Joe still hasn't covered it since. I would listen to his reviews on offline games though since they generally don't change.
---
I’m looking for shotgun shells, .308, .45,  
---
.38, or even 10mm
---
Definitely would stop people from getting bored of it.
---
And no-one has a clue about what it actually is.
---
Absolutely.... Dropped all of mine recently at a train station. Now avoiding picking them up at all..
---
Does your settlement need saving?
---
I know.
---
It's hard to dodge a hate boner when they're coming at you from every direction.
---
But you did.
---
You're here.
---
Welcome to the matrix. The world the world doesn't want you to know about.
---
One of the issues me and my buddies ran into was that the heavy guns are way to strong, a 50. Machine gun took down 3 guys in power armor alone in 5 seconds before they realized where the shots came from that's a bit unfair, we had scout and marine armor and power armors on top yet died as if we were naked
---
His only saving grace is that he doesn't pander to the alt-right unlike most gaming youtubers.
---
So starting with a clean player for this mode was totally dumb, when I have a library of decent leveled adventure players from last year. Dammit. 
---
Is that actually documented anywhere ?
---
Cranberry cobbler is a good one - you can make that up at Aaronholt, 20 instances a harvest (there's 10 plants) or 40 in vendant season. Nice &amp; light and good value. Also, excellent food to have in your early levels as it speeds up XP gain. 
---
Weight will always be an issue (adventure is, more than anything, a weight management challenge) but the further you go on, the more perks you'll get that will assist with this (through hiker &amp; weight reduction armor).
---
Alcohol is pretty heavy,  and can get you overweight before you realise it, but I always carry some whiskey with me, in case I need to buff my carry weight for some emergency fast travel; whiskey+grilled radstag+psychobuff. 
---
In terms of bulking, it's only useful for the crap you're not going to use to get it out of the inventory - stuff like ceramic and glass. If you're okay do dump it, then just dump it instead. This is, except in the case of lead and aluminium. Bulking these will halve their weight and you should always keep your supplies of them bulked.
---
People wouldn’t get bored of it.
---
Best choice
---
Gt?
---
For me un- and re-equipping the GunFu Perk card fixes this issue (only for the current session, tho).
---
Can you not see what is happening in the video? Lol.
---
Wierd... To much hopping servers before it could register? 
---
Im on pc and ill give you mine... I got a TSE double barrel from the gamble so im going to build around that for my next char.
---
I bought the game dirt cheap 2 weeks ago on xbox one s. In short It's terrible, after a few hours of play. The combat is janky, the shooting is so bad (compared to say destiny), the enemies seem to be lagging constantly and the performance is trash.
---
Just my experience so far.
---
I'm in Morgantown and have had that happen just once. The players are a little older and know the world a little better but still need those cheap stimpacks and radaways.
---
The titles of videos juicehead puts out still puts across a positive comment in a negative light, his last video for example that I watched was talking about NW, the title said "its ACTUALLY good!" Something about that title in itself says to me he was looking for a problem with the new mode and was maybe a little disappointed he didn't find something major to complain about, the consistent skepticism in his voice seems to support that in my opinion. You tubers are the devil when it comes to gaming reviews, when I watch them it makes me cringe watching them all jump on a bandwagon to grab a few likes and squeeze a few dollars out of it.
---
Then you can just stay at 1 point per special forever then.  See if I care.
---
Some will, I don't want to try it out for a while because I burnt out on BR ages ago.
---
Both.
---
Developers/Publisher: I see what you are trying to do here, but I will not be returning to the base game grind so I guess NW is dead to me as well.
---
You do gain Adventure mode XP from playing Nuclear Winter too, along with caps, so it's not too bad
---
You and your teammates just need to be on the main menu.  Then just use the social menu to invite them to a team, and the team leader then clicks "Play with Team" and selects NW mode and you'll be put in a match together.
---
I would like to add that signing up with the scouts early means you start earning credit for the different scout challenges early while adventuring, so that is a good thing to get done.
---
Nukashine 😅👍
---
What's that background?
---
Its free feedback for the game developers.
---
Ive check 3 different servers raiders vendor in white springs
---
If it has to be a neutral gound where damage is not dealt then it might as well be an area where we are totally unable to use any weapon or punches, like the Think Tank in Old World Blues.
---
For an audience with zero interest in adventure mode (me) that isn't going to sell the NW game mode.
---
Outfits in the atomic shop can be selected and worn in the lobby and in game, although in the game they often get replaced with the armor you pick up.
---
Ive checked 3 servers raider vendor in white springs
---
I having so much difficulty finding this damn broken camera, i server hopped a million times and nothing
---
While I love this theory, I do believe the reason for the door discrepancy is because the DLC is in Sneak Peak, adventure mode is not.
---
Thx.. 
---
Didn't mention it as it's the same as in fallout 4. Added in snippets.
---
Death Stranding looks so much fun!
---
Too busy trying to get all the footballs in the goal in NW
---
Mr. Codsworth just hovering around "Oh really"
---
You should retitle so people understand that you’re happy now when they see your title
---
I think it’d help if they kept making monthly rewards for it, rotating the maps out, letting us continue discovering the secrets of Vault 51 slowly instead of no lifing it and hitting level 100+ in the first month, etc.
---
I’m sure a lot of people would hate having to wait in between seasons to play it, but I like the idea of keeping it special somehow, and letting us take a little time to jump back into adventure mode without feeling like we’re missing something in NW.
---
Then the event scorched earth would actually make sense visually
---
If only all the critic against it was for the bugs and whatnot. You also have "this isn't a real fallout with quests and NPCS!", "I don't want to go online to play my games! and the evergreen "BUT THEY PROMISED ME ELDER SCROLLS 6, DAMNIT!"
---
So we shouldn't just pretend that people liked it for the obvious reasons. There are plenty of haters who just didn't want to give it a chance and in fact wanted to see it fail.
---
Idk how to retitle
---
Fair enough I guess, but you're only playing one piece of the game without experiencing the rest, it's actually an enjoyable experience, especially with how far it's come
---
Thanks.
---
Is it possible to plant raspberries in your CAMP?
---
yea thats what i thought regarding the F4 numbers. But in F4 Furious used to stack higher iirc and i m unsure about how high it stacks here
---
76 is a control vault. It's not supposed to be habitable anymore.
---
No I didn't, I saw that bethesda posts here sometimes but I haven't been to the website. I will now.
---
I'm really enjoying the newbie influx as well.
---
&gt; I've played many online games and I've never, ever had this kind of community
---
Warframe's great for it too.
---
Bethesda launched the game when it wasn't ready, so i can understand some backlash. But i do feel it was taken too far for "clicks". I stopped playing shortly after launch, because I had so many issues on PC just trying to play, so i left it stabilize for a bit. I came back a couple of weeks back and it's amazing seeing the difference from what i remember. I felt a little betrayed by Bethesda after launch, but although i'm not forgetting, I am willing to give them the recognition that they have worked hard to turn it around.
---
Right I picked it up for the free trial expecting to be bullied but I dont think another player has pointed a gun at me yet all they do is help great.
---
Everywhere I went looked like this, basically I couldn't see rocks, trees, cars, buildings, grass, etc. but I could see players and npcs.
---
I'm level 6 and noticed I got "Vault 51" icon and photo frame, "Small supply box" icon and CAMP stash. I like the stashes particularly, because good design, brightness and easy to spot, just the thing to place in my camp vending area for other players.
---
I have already ground (grinded) one player to level 120 and launched nukes solo and unsupported at level 15 with no glitches ([yes pictures to prove that](https://imgur.com/kJizbR3)) last year. Took a look recently, but the base game is dead to me. 
---
Came back for the BR which is great if it can be played standalone, but not if its coupled back to the base game grind.
---
Same, broken!
---
You can scrap weapons to learn the more for it. Easiest one to do is the hunting rifle since a lot of low level super mutants carry them. For some other more powerful rifles (e.g. lever action), you'll need to buy the plans for it and craft/scrap them. 
---
However, it you want a spawn point for a sniper rifle in the wild, there should be one at the top of the wooden tower at the tadpole camp where you start the Ever Upwards questline.
---
Charleston
---
Tell me
---
ok, but feedback for the dev team, there is no point telling players they can 'favorite' apparel if the apparel voids armor. Its confusing and counter-intuitive.
---
I still see YouYubers shredding it but I'll give Bethesda credit, its a fun game now and has massive potential. I wasnt too excited about a BR mode but the fact it levels up my adventure mode character, I'm happy to play and unlock everything. Plus it's a less toxic community so easy to find people to play group with. 
---
The only issue I have is no one's at my camp buying all my stuff while I'm at war!
---
Please tell me you haven't wasted the opportunity to "recruit the noobies with the voice of Friedrich!!!  
---
ARE YOU READY FOR THE THRILL AND EXCITEMENT OF LIFE IN A POST APOCALYPTIC HELLSCAPE!!!!!
---
 Prepare for danger! Prepare for adventure! Prepare for survival!
---
Yeah I have seen this on the road not far from the fire station
---
That fan art is pretty awesome, thank you for sharing :)
---
As it turns out I hardly ever get to interact with anyone that lives past the Ural mountains, we are in opposite sides of the dial after all; is nice to hear your heartbeat in places like this :)
---
I wouldnt say you are feeding the noobs, more like teaching them to fish, so they can fend for themselves. Good on you.
---
Why
---
That's fair enough then, although I do think it's annoying to have to go back into adventure mode purely to progress for another part of the game, surely it's not too big of an issue for newer players/characters as the XP earned from NW can take them quite far if they manage to do decently enough
---
Honestly I'm surprised with how friendly everyone is.  It's rare especially in a game like this
---
I'm level 42 and I still struggle with ammo, some enemies are super tanky and take a lot of ammo to kill
---
I find the mirelurk kings a lot more to handle in there than the actual wendigo.
---
You can craft them too in the tinkering workbench.
---
Then you will hunt for lead :D
---
Gets a lot easier as you level up, you find more on enemies and also you’re stronger so you use a lot less bullets to get kills. And you will have built up a pool of resources to craft ammo with.
---
I switched to melee when I was lower levels because of this problem, playing melee for a bit let’s you build up your ammo store
---
I dont think I've been there yet
---
Good to hear!!
---
I was at someone’s camp and found a lvl 5 playing all the instruments there while I was shopping, so I made him a BoS Recon Sniper and a puncturing boxing glove.
---
He/She showed loved and keep me entertained while i finished shopping.
---
What are the legendary effects?
---
Its had pretty much a year of development by one of the biggest studios since those reviews, any game would have improved.
---
230 main here. I had to go for ammo every day. One SBQ will eat up to 6k 5mm ammo. Bethesda should increase ammo drop. I switched to melee later.
---
Also cheap on cdkeys. Was like £12 so that's probably like 15 dollars?
---
Yeah, it would be nice. Especially for new players.
---
that's a old glitch where an enemy is invisible.  I had that happen to me quite often when the game came out.(haven't in months though)
---
I've never played in melee class in either fallout or elder scrolls. is it more fun or are you solely doing it because it's too difficult to find ammo?
---
yes coz its free....ppl take everything that is free. wait until the 16th of june and BR will be freakin dead. dont flatter yourselves with the idea that you were right all along since so many ppl play right now.....its over soon. and after that we stand, again, at the point where we need pve content. but hey f\*\*k it, right? i mean as long as there are a few thousand players more for 1 week everythings fine
---
Sounds rough :X
---
They'll most likely show it inside of the next inside the vault tomorrow.
---
I got lucky, I've got what most would consider a sub-optimal character that I've been playing. The results is I have relatively high PER and AGI, but not max) and at least an average of 6 on the other stats. As it turns out that works out REALLY well for Nuclear Winter so far, so far the most expensive cards I've found cost 6 of a stat which I can afford to equip.
---
I'm currently hoping to get Rifleman to pair with Tank Killer. I'd use Commando but... I'm hot garbage with most auto rifles in this game. I tend to use a lot of single shot weapons that go for more precise attacks over spray.
---
Until the end of time
---
 That's a relief. I'm really enjoying the game so far. I'm surprised how much fun it is considering all the bad stuff I heard about it over the last year. 
---
On the topic of resources, as a low-level character I've been scrapping just about everything that I picked up that I don't intend to use. What was your strategy as a newbie when it came to items that you didn't need? Sell or scrap?
---
Uhh. Here we go ahead with crying for nerfs.
---
The reviews were from the game at launch and were justified. The game has had almost a year of development since its release, any other game would have also improved.
---
Ammo grind was a bit irritating for me as well at lower levels. It persisted until I got Ammosmith, which is a long way off for you. Only advice is to kill a lot of super mutants for ammo, gunpowder, and scrap their weapons for steel. The little weight rooms in the flatwoods motel and Charleston fire department are good for lead. Also lots of steel scrap at wade airport. Tag lead for searching and items containing lead will appear with a little magnifying glass next to their names.
---
I played yesterday and today. No issues.
---
Punching very annoying :( i wish i can find quiet room there
---
By the way, What reward do you got at runk 32?
---
What an idiotic response.
---
You’re still an idiot.
---
Good tips. One last small one, Take off your clothes in the lobby!
---
They provide zero stats but have a weight of 1.1
---
You should definitely play with a controller.  
---
I could do with some easy kills ;)
---
Oh didn’t know that.
---
Like kills and wins etc
---
So when will nuclear winter be out for good?
---
I’m new, trying it out for the free play but will for sure purchase. I accidentally stole from a guy cause I was just wandering and looting, not realizing you can apparently lock up stuff and keep it safe. All of a sudden I’m “wanted” and this level 200+ comes over to me and just fucked my day haha. I felt awful and told him such, he seemed pretty chill after the fact.
---
In the Documents\\My Games\\Fallout 76 folder create a new text file and name it Fallout76Custom.ini.
---
Open it and add these lines (and nothing else):
---
\[Login\]
---
s76UserName=your\_login\_goes\_here
---
s76Password=your\_password\_goes\_here
---
Then start the game from the .exe rather than the launcher.
---

Yeah it’s a really fun game, I’ve played since launch and whilst it wasn’t in the best of states at launch I’ve always found it enjoyable and the bad press a bit harsh. 
---
Scrap scrap scrap! Although I would sell guns that I found to get my caps up, however you get mods from scrapping guns so I realised I had no mods unlocked. But all the junk you find just pick it all up and scrap it and you’ll get plenty of resources before you know it!
---
Buy a Nukashine and drink it , best buffs in the whole game!!
---
Thanks for the info!
---
This takes place before all the V76 friendly people.
---
I did it cause bloodied power fist was only way to kill super mutants and other anoying mobs in one shot, but then you go to arctos pharma event and Alpha will kill you with one slap, so you can't kill him as melee. 
---
This game is actualy pretty frustrating in lategame, because bad healthpool and damage of enemies, from bosses to basic mobs. Like fucking cave crickets, why do they survive same damage as deathclaw?
---
Ok might be, but what enemy makes the ground shake like that?
---
Yeah, people who are having a fun time in a game are always amusing, unlike basement living trolls.
---
It is even worse, when you're at the bad end of a closing firestorm. Happened to me once, when I couldn't outrun the storm because stamina ran out. Maybe give us infinite stamina if  the storm is closing in, and we're a certain distance from the edge of the storm.
---
It WAS in rough shape when it released. I don’t blame people for getting turned off by it. But it was naive for people to think that it was going to stay that way.
---
The next big update is PvE focused, all about Wastelanders returning. That comes in fall.
---
If youre one ps4 i can give you some ammo if youd like
---
What platform?
---
Yes! It's been so long since I played fallout 4 that I forgot you could tag items. You are breathtaking!!
---
Hey, it's fun so I don't disagree, but it's also new content in a game staved for it and something a little different. Maybe wait a few months before making sweeping assumptions like that. I've already migrated back to Adventure for the most part, unless my friends on mic are playing.
---
Omg
---
Exact same happened to me! Had a level 120 player drop me a heap of purified water and dog food not even 15 minutes in.
---
You need to create a custom ini file, not modify the existing one. I think you'll find good tips on what the settings should be via Google (search fallout 76 custom ini). It doesn't reset to the stock ini when you update. May prevent you from playing Nuclear Winter mode, but you can always remove them replace it.
---
I recognise that games companies are businesses, but they are releasing defective products and then fixing them later. I feel like we need some form of quality standard (i am no expert on how this would work) so they cannot realease in a state like the norm of late. I get they are pushing the boundaries of what tech can do, but this can't carry on.
---
Not nerfs. Balance. I won 8 of my last 10 games, and half of them were because I was invisible with 3 stealth boys.
---
How about 5 scripts?
---
I think it's safe to say most people didn't want BR, but most of us have come to like it since actually playing it
---
GOOD FOR YOU YOU’RE SO COOL!
---
Ha-ha Gary?
---
Shitty ISP is very different from a server crash. Server crashes would mean literal thousands of players getting cut off at once. In any online games, EVER, the sub reddit would be instantly flooded if servers actually crash. 
---
Games like this require data centers to operate. If it crashes, it would crash hard and explosively (figuratively speaking).
---
Would you like some Mentats? :p
---
I had a similar bug where I entered and then my health started to drain slowly. It kept draining until I relogged. I was mildly inconvenienced
---
You have to be carrying a grenade when you die for it to work.  
---
I've used it, all it did was transform me from down, to dead in an instant. Not the most useful thing ever. Would need to be that grenades didn't hurt the owner in NW for this to serve any realistic use/purpose I think, as all it does is confirm death.
---
You should just quit mate, this way we won't have to read about another person winging about the game.
---
What platform are you?
---
Thanks Jim.
---
If Endurance still works at all, then yes.. it makes sprinting cost less.
---
Back to you Sandy with the weather.
---
I loooove helping them out.
---
I'm set up near the lumber yard by the vault. One of my Vendors is tagged "Level 25 and under only. Please take only what you need." it's full of stimpacks, water, radway, low level weapons and armor, ammo. All for real cheap or free. I also keep all my water unlocked. If I'm at my camp when a level 2 drops by, I drop loot for them as well. 
---
I have to stock it every half hour or so. If it's too full, dbags level 75 and up show up and clear the entire thing out.
---
I have done that to by accident
---
pve if u put pacifist on then u don't have to worry about PvP in adventure
---
No witch-hunting. Read the sub-reddit rules.
---
Just a wild guess, have alt+tabbed while playing?
---
This happens a lot for me and this is why I play on borderless window mode, sacrificing half my fps for this. But because I am too lazy to reinstall my windows.
---
How about the person with the highest overseer rank can create laws and shit inside V51?
---
I always manage them to see it, be it with the lantern, teabagging the bag etc xD
---
My console is hardwired so I hardly ever have those issues
---
Yep i came here to say the same thing.
---
Frankly the reason that dropped bags in NW aren't paper bags aren't just for visibility, it's so you know it came from a corpse. I agree that the paper bags are a bit of a bummer, lunch boxes suggested in this sub so many times make so much more sense... but well they haven't changed it yet so.
---
Update: wanted to add that in endgame pistols seem sadly underpowered compared to rifles, as pistol lack any armor penetration and have lower base dmg and fire rate. I would love to get a gunslinger build as potent as my rifle build but havent got there yet. Only came close by using pipe revolver with rifle stock as they get bonus from both gunslinger and marksman perks, but I guess thats unintended and a fix is coming.
---
If i get a pistol with two shot explosive perhaps this build would work:

---
Sadly no cannibalism and stuff like that but hopefully the defense perks could help with survivability since its not a stealth build. Another minus is low AP and therefore less AP.
---
If you're coming here to look for someone else's validation you need to just gtfo.  You already knew the answer to your question before you asked it.  You're either going to keep playing and deal with the servers crashing every now and then, or you're going to bail and play a different game.  Why waste your time posting this?
---
That’s because it’s a drama channel disguised as a news channel.
---
Nothing like scrapping your first hundred pipe pistols and finding a hardened receiver gives you less damage than a gold club :)
---
The guy who designed the DMV quest should be flogged and beaten to an inch of his life
---
I got one more guy to get through that questline  and I’m done.
---
Its a pain at 1st but gets much easier as you go along. Making ammo is easy and you find it every where. You end up dropping what you don't use. Don't forget it has weight now so can use up a lot of storage.
---
Gary!
---
other posts hint at the solution. whether your melee or not , always carry a big stick.
---
most stuff, like buckets, are far easier to club, rather than throw ammo at them.
---
unless you come across something really decent, steer away from automatics.
---
Depends on your time zone. I am not much of a team player, but can help you during the newbie levels, whilst explaining the game's mechanics. Also can provide a bit of supplies, until you learn how to manage your own.
---
So, I'll await for your reply.
---
What are the requirements for the challenge and the reward?  I can't check right now.
---
Just stalk someone
---
I can play NW with my custom ini.
---
&gt;A better look at rewards. Easy. Give us a list. Scrollable in game or outside it even! I'd really love to see what I can acquire at rank 50, or 37, or whatever random rank I want. Gives us all something specific to set as a goal instead of a vague showcase of PA and Helmets.
---
This, so much this. The first time I saw the images for the rewards, it confused me. What do each of those symbols mean? Is the vault symbol something related to the vault 51 lobby that we start in? Is it an unlock-able cosmetic? It didn't help that when I reached rank 2 or 3, it tells me "You unlocked vault 51!". I legit went in to adventure mode thinking that I unlocked access to the vault itself outside of NW. Turns out, it's either the player icon unlock, or the logo for photo mode unlock. *I still don't know which of the two vault 51 reward icons at the bottom of the xp screen represents which.*
---
That's not even mentioning the little box icons. I've seen some people say that it affects the contents of the loot crates in the mode itself. I haven't seen anything really concrete to show one way or the other.
---
My suggestion for this: Add in a button either on the character selection screen, or the NW selection screen, or both, that will bring up a screen showing our progress in overseer levels. Let us see what rewards we've unlocked, the rewards we've yet to unlock, and don't spare the juicy details. When we hover over an unlock-able, tell us: Is it a perk pack, is it a player icon, is it a buff to the loot boxes (more ammo/silenced weapons/better armor?), is it a cosmetic unlock, etc.
---
This is by far, the biggest (and so far only) gripe that I have with the mode at the moment, and that's coming from someone who really doesn't usually enjoy PvP modes all that much.
---
The game mode expressly states that those effects are turned off to avoid unfair advantages
---
You rebel you! rawr
---
PSA off of this: DO NOT alt+tab while having stylised interfaces open in the game. Things such as world map, mode selection screen, perks, etc. They cause the game to become washed out and lose resolution. If you want to alt+tab, do it while you are not opening anything in game. Just you char looking at the ambience.
---
For me it's like 12 pm I don't know what time zone so I'm free to play now if you can
---
You gotta admit it captures the bureaucracy perfectly
---
There's no official numbers but I suspect it's adventure
---
This is well deserved for Fo76! I played since day1 and I saw it keep getting better week after week. I had a lot of good moments with this community!
---
That's interesting, two identical (or so they appear in task manager) exe s did get me wondering. :) 
---
I have no issue in game. 
---
But Bethesda using the close program 'x' to minimise to system tray rather than close the launcher properly irks my pedant ways no end :D
---
I normally drop plans for noobs. Not because I'm superior but because when you first start out it's hard to find plans to get armor or camp items. And if you don't want the help that's perfectly fine you do you boo but instead of just walking off stating "It's annoying" Emote no back or use your voice chat to tell them you're not interested. That way they wont be following you around and you can continue doing what you're doing.
---
Surely someone dropping you a few plans is a lot less annoying than if you were killed by the same players.
---
Yeah gonna see just how high I can get before the week is over I'm almost to rank 15 I'm hoping I can snag the assaultron knight helm before the sneak peak ends, cool rewards either way tho I much prefer playing to unlock skins and whatnot to paying for them with atoms hopefully they keep it up with the unlocks
---
No it likely wont disuade or change anything. Its no longer the developers behind these decisions of shoddy early releases the bigger the company gets, its the finance department trying to satisfy investors and its only getting worse. Its been like this since Frogger.
---
Rebels roar, punk.
---
I tried that too, but it seemed to ignore it. Tested with disabling vsync, but it was still activated.
---
i assume you are on PC, when did you start playing and do you have a rough estimate of the amount of friends on your friendlist?
---
You're thinking of Team Fortress 2.
---
Good to know (I haven't tried)! Thought they said they were going to block those who did.
---
It's only here.
---
Jim Sterling just needed like 10 hours after the Beth showcase to put his latest "Bethesda is pure evil" piece out, as did other youtubers such as Legacy.
---
Admitting the game had a turn around doesn'T get much views.
---
as weird as this sounds, i think that when it comes to these types of games from the Bethesda brand, we can expect it to start out pretty ugly, but as time goes on get way better
---
deathclaw, sheepsquatch
---
i disagree it can use a little boost but not too much the whole purpuse of running out of stamina is for you too make tactikal dessisions looking for bushes too hide in and regain stamine etc.
---
I'm an older "Filthy Casual" on PS4.
---
I'll run the waste land with you, no problem.
---
adsta05
---
Not sure about the math here.
---
I got a full suit of t51 and t45 armor for each of my characters as well.
---
The whole point of a BR is that everyone starts with nothing
---
I love the fact that this game is starting to gain the good attention it deserves. I butt heads with a lot of the youtubers who i thought were "level headed" when i said that the game was fun, half of them blocked me and i unsubbed to the other half, the only one who i didnt was MrMatty, he seemed more open to hearing opposing opinions and actually played it after each update, i hope this game gets bigger than fallout 4, i hope for new maps to explore, and i hope this game keeps going.
---
No you should not have mods installed in the data folder and active in the custom ini, also i can say that reshade also works in NW they don't block it
---
melee builds were quite fun in 3, NV and 4 as you had the slow mo cam of kills with VATS. or being able to shiv 3-4 enemies via Bleach/"nothing personal kid" teleportation. 
---
from what i've experienced in 76, melee builds don't have much going for them in terms of fun as the swing animation and impact/feedback isn't really a strong point with their game engine. you can get some pretty good damage tho...
---
Or you could look at it as 6.25% of the time it works everytime
---
Those early graphical glitches are some of my favorite memories of Fallout 76 so far.
---
I'm sad I didnt get it sooner it is fun but I think I'll like it alot more when NPCs are a thing. I like the community I havent been bullied in fact the opposite people give me supplies and then run off into the hills. It does stutter often but I havent been booted to the menu like I see other people saying. Overall I think there's a ton of potential and I cant wait to start building my C.A.M.P.
---
I think you have an eye disease.
---
I've enjoyed it because the main places I farm in the Mire and Bog are not picked over already with all the low levels sticking to the west side of the map.
---
Almost definitely Adventure Mode, but since there's only 24ish people to a world it'll be hard for you to notice any difference in player count while you're in the game.
---
Gigabit connections are known for dropping connection.
---
I brought the tactical ops apparel and cant equip it in the nw lobby(iv crafted it in adventure aswell)
---
I was able to download the next day. I noticed what seemed like lag on shots and was suspecting western servers. They should be at least a Singapore server? You are able to see the data centers on pc?
---
Yeah buy a new one
---
Its turned around because people from here keep posting that its amazing. Actual /fallout'ers are steering clear and have given up on the franchise.
---
I understand the need.  
---
I also know from MANY previous games how vial it can be.  Maybe it should be left out.
---
Same thing as duping, so nah. Exploiting is exploiting, even if it's only for a day.
---
Armor worn under Power Armor is never active. It's not been that way in FO4 either. In earlier games PA was a form of regular armor and also replaced the armor beneath. Power Armor isn't neccessarily better than other armor to my experience in NW. Being slower I have died in the fire when the others in the team outran me.
---
I just hope combat armor will be a thing and would fit between scout and marine.
---
On a different note, think i saw you in br yesterday, Keezy? 
---
you got deaded
---
Was gonna say "bad bot", but then I realized that's kinda his M.O.
---
I also think that laser rifles are too weak. Splitter breaks at incredible speed but does not increase the damage at all.
---
You have to shoot all the magazine bullets to defeat the super mutant.
---
It is a weapon without any advantage now.
---
Moreover, the Ultracite Laser Rifle is less damaged, so it is less than a cockroach in the toilet.
---
You should increase base damage by + 20-25
---
%.( + 30-35% for Ultracite Laser Rifle)
---
Is there a place where they announce when the next Inside the Vault is going to be?  Just curious where you got your date from.
---
Tried playing, it's fun but laggy as fuck for me. Low settings, gtx 1060 3go, 16go ram, i5-5600, and good internet connection, still laggy...
---
That’s good to hear :)
---
They had stated a while back that this is still coming but they're having difficulties so they had to delay it. They don't have a timeframe on when it's coming yet.
---
Seems all technical or graphic option questions get down-voted and no comments on this subreddit, even if it is a specific question with no clear answer on a faq or popular guide. So I will answer you since I like to help.
---
Imma be straight with you mate chances are you may not get decent performance on that older rig, My 960 struggles alot But checkout this guide on editing the .ini files. Changed everything for me.

Because this game is fucking shit
---
You cant spectate enemy players.
---
Harsh but true
---
**cough** and console. It's a pain to open peoples profile to send a 4 worded message
---
For me it's almost 1 pm, so we're close. However I am at work today, despite my cravings to play. And I have D&amp;D scheduled after work. So the earliest I will be available is 5 pm tomorrow.
---
IGN Geneziz
---
Why in the gods name are you playing it then?
---
Sure dm me tomorrow or will I dm you9
---
I agree... a button that bring the player (or team) back in Vault 51 for a new game.
---
Nah, you in the wrong BR.
---
Yes I never really cared to stay but I think I'm usually made a spectator of the guy who killed me, so if that's true and you killed a party member of the three that killed you and they communicate it's possible  that you were spied on.
---
is it set to fullscreen and not borderless window?
---
Yep! I alt tab all the time. I only chose full screen because it’s basically unplayable at windowed mode due to the poor frame rate. Saw a fix for it and been happy ever since! Well, except for the resolution issue...
---
best comment ive read today :)
---
I do, but it doesn't drop this often...
---
Well then how did he spectate me? I wasn't on a team. I couldn't have been anything but an enemy player.
---
I'm able to pinpoint the server ip location. Mostly western u.s, very rarely getting oceania (oz/nz) server and never ever get east asia server (not sure if there's such thing) since south korea and china are listed in [bathesda.net](https://bathesda.net) fallout76 page. Lag while shooting is totally a big bummer, unable to pickup loot (due to poor network) after spending 15-30 minutes wasting bullets and melee weapons durability fighting nasty flying rats and what not is even more annoying. Why not, just add a cluster of servers for us 🤯
---
A lot of these settings I didn't know about helped, I appreciate it!
---
I think each mode tries to get around 20ish ppl in it. except NW which is the 50.
---
When you find a way to spectate enemies let me know.
---
and you're just an angry, gross, miserable, irradiated pile of molerat droppings.
---
‘They’? You mean the people who make money off click bait, enragement and video views?
---
And yetmy last match someone with Frog Legs(?) just jumped around with a grenade launcher non-stop.  That needs to be removed or impose incredible AP costs to balance it
---
Let them kill you when you're not on a team. Or die to the storm while not on a team.
---
ZAX recommends that the first approach to a new member should be aggresive to show dominance.
---
They are a source of great enjoyment. I like teaching them about some game mechanics, like not open a lock if it says "steal".
---
Sorry; I can't get on my pc to share mine, but it was simply a copy/paste job I did from a tutorial/post. Definitely works for me. The motion blur and for was killing me before. Sorry for your struggles getting it to take.
---
To be fair I do run around punching ground/butts
---
You’re just asking for upvotes, we both know it. Why don’t you label this “upvotes to the left”?
---
wow that is awesome
---
Sure its rp?
---
Also maybe the Overseer from the last game can be announced in the next game/round? And you can get extra Xp if you manage to kill them. I know Apex does that as well
---
I think its better if you ask that question instead
---
Don't forget all the Facebook videos of people trashing game stop for not giving them refunds, or the people that decided they needed a class action law suit for some reason. I was absolutely disgusted at the gaming community at the time.
---
Sounds like an internet issue
---
Thanks for the suggestion, I'll try it later today.
---
I've just a few questions: would I be able to join Nuclear Winter with a custom ini?  I've read of of people being denied access for modified files and I wonder if the autologin counts.
---
And, what is the security risk exactly? Do people have to hack my computer and know what to look for and where, or can they get it through the game/launcher somehow?
---
I'm pretty sure that's not true, but I would love to be proven wrong. I thought you could only have 1 buff per category: food, drink, chems, magazine, bobblehead, etc.
---
A death zone of sorts? Something from the nuclear winter that bled into adventure? If anyone tried battle royale mode - does it look like that when you enter the outer fire ring?
---
Someone reported a similar "death zone" in a nuke zone yesterday.
---
np, game on.
---
Auction house, for items that several people might wanna put in a bid on. Hidden bids, highest secret bid wins. Items stays up for bidding for 1 hour. That should draw people and is a good way to sell items that you don't know how much they are worth.
---
Wait... I thought there was a release date put out for Death Stranding for fall-ish of this year???
---
I know its in active but still power armor should be one of the best otherwise theres no point due to it just making you louder and slower, and my point if the post was for how big guns are OP especially the 50 caliber which can kill in seconds even with armor and with perks makes you more tank as well and faster reload and more! Another issue is how after switching a weapon you get a major lag spike
---
Yea my biggest beef with it is that if the people I live with are standing outside my room they will think I’m just watching dudes fuck and punch each other, with an occasional she-grunt.
---
The building area is a sphere around camp. It extends upwards and downwards. Of you can put your camp on an elevation (for example on a tree) you will be able to build higher. I belive max is ~9 floors.
---
There are plenty of people who love this game.
---
PS4.
---
Me so dumb.
---
The word “dead” means nothing these days. 
---
I’ve seen people claiming Overwatch dead, you know one of the largest E-Sports games of the past few years with a large returning player base? 
---
“Dead” just means “I don’t like it” anymore. Fallout is online so now it’s “dead!” They nerfed bastion so now Overwatch is dead! Battlefield 5 is dead because women and terrible marketing!
---
Not that , but rather the game is accualy fun , I saw a lot of people say that they hate Battle Royales but that they love Nuclear Winter (me included) , that could be a cause too.
---
Nah, I think they are fine they way they are. The only other way to become invisible in NW is the chameleon mutation (that I know of at least). And honestly that’s what the stealth boy is made for, to be able to attack your enemy without them knowing where your at
---
Lmao
---
That's too bad. I'm amazed an AAA game doesn't have sea server. The same thing is happening in borderlands handsome collection. I can't join any lobbies without worse lag. Oh well, thanks for the info.

classic kiddo answer...only thing that is missing is that you insult my mom. freakin fortnite kiddie! im not just a stupid fanboy that munches on everything bethesda serves us. you do you, but i wont forget what the game was at launch and i also wont forget what the main goal of fallouts should be. go on....hop on the BR servers with the fortnite kiddies in the free week, but u will see that this mod would have been better as temporary event.....

You have to select it in the atomic shop and a little nuke icon will appear in the corner of the item. It's noted down below as "Enter) NW FAVORITE"
---
A lot of people like the game, but a friendly bit of advice... don't expect anything from reddit. At least one of the mods in both here and r/Fallout is corrupt and abusive, participating in the trashing of 76 and banning people who disagree under the guise of 'civility' while allowing the worst, most toxic behavior I've seen in a game sub.
---
This sub usually has people who like the game, but the same abusive mod is here, so... like I said, take care. Don't bother disagreeing with anyone who spams lies. Judge the game yourself, try to get others to try it themselves. It isn't a tripple A title, but it's damn fun for what it is.
---
What if you didnt have 2 friends to play with. What if it were just you. Would it still be fun?
---
This, I got carnivore to offset the negatives of speed demon. Never looked back.
---
Most likely yes. If you had to make an account, as it's bound to your account. I believe I've read you can get the game 50 percent off after the trial. So it would be stupid if that wouldn't be the case.
---
Nope.  If you are moving your camp tho this happens.
---
There was a period of time you could pump levels extremely quickly if you nuked Whitesprings.  2-3 levels an hour wasn't an issue at all, and that wasn't even *trying* to grind or be efficient.
---
Well to be fair the game was garbage and wholly unfinished until later patches
---
I honestly used to shit all over this game. I bought it about a month back and the community is one of the best I've ever seen. Never change!
---
It's a bad week for vending, sure. But it is made up for by seeing all these new players. 
---
Every server I have been in there is usually a stream of level 2s wandering down from the vault. Amazing to see.
---
I got a perk card that increases jump height by 300%.....but it takes 9 AGI to equip and I have 3 :(
---
What are the other modifiers?
---
Lvl 8 scrub myself, but my first experiences:
---
Finding ressources to craft:
---
There is a gym a bit north of flatwoods with weights and dumbbells, easy spot for lead. Steal is nearly everywhere. Gunpowder seems a bit more tricky, but you can craft this from acid and cloth. No clue how to farm acid efficiently…
---
Also, consider carrying two or even three guns with different ammo types. Hunting rifle, pipe rifle, pipe revolver rifle take .308, .38 and .45 ammo.
---
Plus, keep a melee weapon for the really easy encounters.
---
Or, group up with a fellow melee player who has no use for the ammo himself. Playing on PS4?
---
Thing that annoys me the most is all the people who jump on to any post from Bethesda, or a news review of the game with 'people are still playing?' or 'Nobody plays this anymore.' Erm... no.
---
Instead of wasting effort to slam the game for likes, go play some game you do like. Jeez.
---
Yeah, a nice change of pace in Flatwoods. I can now drop free items for the new players again! I even teach some of them a valuable lesson about locks and "steal".
---
Me too! I’m babysitting a friend and I only shoot enemies when is having trouble so he makes all the xp and lives the experience!
---
And guess what? He’s loving the game!
---
If i do this challenge, does it award it to all characters?
---
You sound like my friend! :D
---
I remember I convinced some friends to get it despite the reviews and the enjoyed it, and shut up about the hate train. People take the word of critics far too easily. Make your own opinions!
---
Will edit and add
---
Then they should remove stealth boys.
---
I could do with it being a little higher, but I do like that you have to think about your surroundings more when you can't just sprint through them.
---
It should be removed entirely.
---
As long as the custom ini is not used to load any mods you should be OK.
---
The concern is that anyone running the most basic search in your PC will find your credentials in 2 seconds flat.
---
You will have your login and password stored inside a text file - and the contents of plain text files can be recursively searched - right next to the words 'login' and 'password' :D
---
How much of a concern this is that is entirely up to you.
---
I think you only get one - to the character that completed it
---
I'll go ahead and try this when I get back on, thanks.
---
I had a few mods installed (map, weapon sounds) and it prevrnted me from going into Royale unless they were all disabled. Adventure was fine though.
---
Is it still available for free trial?
---
The floating damage numbers don't seem to consider transient effects such as the furious damage climb or the Tenderizer boost. It also appears enemy DR is not considered (i.e., shooting a mob with Explosive Handmade will show two numbers, 100 + 20, the same as the weapon's listed damage).
---
The sneak attack and crit-spot hits are shown relatively correctly.
---
People got lots of clicks for hating on FO76 when it came out.  I got it day one and have been playing it since on PS4.  It had its problems for sure when it was released, bugged quests, balance issues with guns, fucking scortched beasts spamming their attacks non-stop and never landing and a couple others i forgot about.
---
You would think after one video explaining why you hated the game that would be it.  Hell no.  Video after video after video saying the same shit.  It got clicks and got views.  Just recently with the fucking bag.  Got them all started again.  They hate the game so much why the fuck they care about the bag not being in anybodies hands just yet?
---
If someone is a fan of the fallout series most likely they will like FO76.  It still has my attention which is pretty rare.  I have started 3 different characters which i never do on other games.  Once i beat the game and the stories Im off to the next game.  FO76 keeps me coming back.  Fuck I'm still finding spots i missed the first two times around.
---
Damn.. My main is a commando..
---
That's not true, you can once your team is eliminated.
---
This perk uses 9 agility points, so I think it's quite balanced. Keep leveling up. You just need better cards.
---
I think the influx in server disconnects (not game crashes as that's a separate issue) are due to the free trial week combine with the release of NW. I'm on PS4 and wired. Seems to have gotten worse after this patch but theres a lot on the servers right now.
---
This was meant for the guy saying it was mutants or something, not you mate.
---
I think we do... Right on the dpad, or am I crazy. I could've swore I did this last night.
---
Same here, problematic when you're being rushed by a group.  
---
This update is supposed to have fixed it, but in turn it's broken gun-fu.
---
Lol BE3 Bundle
---
I thought it always worked.
---
I genuinely thought you could find her body somewhere lol.
---
Maybe I'm wrong, but I understood that raiders were from Whitesprings after the rich and greedy folks that survived the war were kicked out by the robots.
---
Why don't you go back to call of duty? 
---
I don't want to talk to some fat fucking freak over the Mic after I've been to fucking work all day. 
---
Some inbred fuckin Autist screaming at me to pick him up over and over... I'm honestly fucking good bro. 
---
 Nothing to do with being a coward.
---
Yep, ive died countless times to scorchbeasts and whitesprings ghouls.
---
Just Started up a discord server for Fallout https://discord.gg/MwGjx9 - everyone is welcome
---
Well in my game def not as well as in my friends game
---
Even *aftet* the end of time
---
I didn't buy this game for a while after release (it ended up on clearance for less than half price) because I'd heard it was a trash fire, I haven't enjoyed a fallout game this much since new Vegas.
---
yes they are, but I don't know if that's the same group of factions, but it should be. Some of the trappers got away, so it makes sense that some of the others would do too!
---
I mean, it worked out pretty well for OP this time. Missed the infestation of bugs at and after launch, and they get to play after additional content was already released.
---
Agreed. As much as I want to just run around everywhere, I also want other people moving slowly so I have better chance to shoot them :)
---
Hate fortnite/apex where you speedily jumpfire and your wrists have a seizure trying to keep the reticle on point.
---
Mine was jumpy as hell when I was stocking it along with my player trade window
---
Up vote for the Bleach reference I watched the show in Japanese with sub titles  and to this day I can't stand to watch it in English.
---
Who the hell spells Shaun like that anyways....
---
https://youtu.be/CntnRHoMe3g
---
Definitely not working on my handmade anymore.
---
I'm on ps4 and the colours are awful and over saturated. Sometimes they seem to return to normal, but it can be quite jarring.
---
It's usually on Tuesdays
---
Yep, I took of hacker and put on ground pounder
---
I love this idea! You’ve inspired me to do the same!
---
The difference when you play with a good team is huge. Got my first win last night and all 4 of us made it to the end, everything gelled. Prioritised reviving team mates over looting, stuck together, covered each other. A bad team can be a struggle.
---
Agreed,
---
The servers crashed on me 3 times. Many more times since that. (Including a time when I wasted tons of scrap on a base.)
---
I've encountered invisible enemies. 
---
Enemies disappeared on multiple occasions. 
---
Also, the main quests are just RIDICULOUS...
---
I'm very sad to say it as I really wanted to like this game.
---
Also nice little mutual appreciation society you have here.
---
I enjoy it a lot as well. Unfortunately the game crashed three times (all three before the airport mission thingy) but for the rest no issues.
---
Perhaps, but canonically, was that the only source or raiders?
---
Yea, can confirm too, not working atm.
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
You are just asking for downvotes, we both know it. Why don't you label this "upvotes to the right"?
---
You’re funny
---
For the people thinking of buying the game, remember the steam version is on the way. (Bethesda announced it a couple of months ago)
---
There's a challenge for you to stay 10 minutes in the stormfront!
---
I don't mind it. Being tactical about where you are in terms of the storm is all part of the game for me.
---
Flatwoods has been stuffed lol, but I like it.
---
I have a keyboard for my ps4. Wouldn't be an issue here.
---
Again, I may have understood it incorrectly, but all the Appalachia raider factions were the Whitesprings survivors.  They just turned on each other and became different gangs.  Just how I read it though.
---
I turned my TV down here because of this. Lol..
---
Walmart had tricentennial version for sale 19.00
---
Make the duffel bags a non-clipping item. Right now you can’t walk through the duffel bags. In NW one time I killed a guy on a set of stairs in a basement and the duffel bag blocked the stairs and I couldn’t get out.
---
It's not likely but they could have hacked a terminal and gotten everyone's location on the map and you being by yourself became a target
---
As far as I know, the only source in Appalachia, yes.  I doubt the only source in all of the country though.  Likely not.
---
Wow I am in shock it seemed like he had such a good marriage.
---
You're not good, you are a prejudiced asshole and a piece of shit.
---
This is it. After the last update half the furniture in the golf club disappeared!
---
That's every Battle Royale game wait time.
---
If you already/still have a high level character, just use that one.
---
You'll have a better SPECIAL rating than a level 1 and won't need to play Adventure to level up.
---
Oh, were they the guys that Bethesda bought over? That studio who had been working on a MOBA type game originally? I didn't know if they had been split up into teams or kept as one studio! :)
---
Me and my partner always play together. While we are both only level 22 we helped out 2 new players for a little while with some supplies and just explored for a bit. It was great fun!
---
Practice, but vats is deadly with the right perks. Vats players would've dominated in BR if they had included it.
---
When you unequip a perk in NW, the amount of spare space you have in each SPECIAL catagory comes up above the line of selected perks. So if you have a Perception of 8 for example, and already have a level 2 perk loaded, then it'll say 6 under your perception heading.
---
This happens with me on PC as well, along with its chem counterpart.
---
To fair, it was pretty crappy at launch, but I've recently jumped back in the last week or so an am also having a blast. They've fixed and added a lot since launch and there seems to be a tonne more stuff coming, so this game is only going to get better over time. I think this will be similar to No Mans Sky, which most people say is pretty good today compared to launch.
---
right actually if they nerfed legendarys spawned but buffed the chance to drop two stars or three stars im fine with that
---
Ouch. Maybe don't drop on made structures thinking about it I guess I always drop directly onto the ground
---
This is the only brawl that matters in the end. The one where people take off their clothes and punch you randomly.
---
I’m 14 AGI, I need this card!
---
This is the payoff for restricting what could be a flexible control system to make it work with console controllers.  
---
*cries in pcmr*
---
Yea! the default settings for this game is absolutely trash. What game starts out windowed with some random ass screen resolution. My first impression to say the least wasn't great. Its not the bad once you optimize it!
---
Still not clear about how to redeem or check on what I've got from boxes
---
My tips:
---
SOLO
---
* If you want to play '**SOLO**' make sure you select the '**DO NOT FILL**' before you start. Those that 'join a team' and then do not 'STICK TOGETHER' are the worst kind of person and I hope they get eaten by a Mirelurk Hunter.
---
* Make a wise decision of engage or not, you have nobody to revive you!
---
* collect meds more than weapons
---
* leave downed enemies as traps/lures
---
* protect your rear with mines
---
* Be a sniper until the SB arrives, then use your close quarter guns
---
TEAM
---
* **GET A MIC**
---
* Spawn together
---
* **STAY TOGETHER**
---
* Share weapons, dont loot everything.
---
* tell your team what build you have so they can give you the relevant weapons
---
I'm on ps4 and get those glitches from time to time along with some artifacting.  I think it's server lag they've also happened in every fallout game I've played so it could be their engine. I'm not an expert though.
---
I got two melee kills by sneaking up behind players. Then got killed by their teammates
---
Go to the atomic shop and look at the items you own and see whats new
---
   That's called being a beta to an alpha. he displayed dominance and you smiled and submitted till he liked you and "took you into his tribe." congrats! butt kissing is a survival skill for betas and you have succeeded. I am not intentionally trying to be mean but you essentially just gave him a social reward for being a douche. The guy is wrong for messing with a lowbie and doesn't deserve social acceptance or recognition. I don't like bullies and I don't like to see betas bending the knee to them. 
---
   Key notes about pvp rules of engagement in adventure mode to help you out in the future. 
---
1. if you are on passive you cannot  "challenge" by shooting a player on accident. 
---
2. when you shoot a player with passive off you have issued a challenge, you are doing no damage until they fire back and accept the challenge. 
---
3. as long as you AND YOUR TEAMMATES have not accepted a challenge or entered a pvp area to take a workshop you are immune to player damage. 
---
in other words unless you have passive turned off and intentionally try you cannot be harmed. this also applies to your camp. camps are indestructible until you accept a challenge by firing back. 
---
next step in the alpha beta relationship progress will be him encouraging you to go be a douche to others with him. You will follow because you're a beta and your alpha wants you to. When you catch yourself teaming up with him to grief some other hapless noob I hope you feel bad, grow a spine and block him from your friend list. otherwise enjoy being his b.....eta.
---
Yeah but without the damage bonus which massively helps pistol builds out of stealth. 
---
It's clear that they don't put much effort or time into play testing these patches.
---
A reward for leveling up.
---
Maybe - this is just a thought - he should prepare those costumes ahead of time, so he can get the review out in a timely matter. 
---
Or better yet, he could get rid of those cringey skits that nobody likes
---
Has anyone got them yet?
---
Proof? Examples? Reasons? Your opinion isn't as compelling as you seem to think
---
It's strange but the most effective natural camo suit I have worn so far is the Hazmat suit!
---
The Ring of Fire (tm) gives most areas an orange glow and when hiding in foliage of any kind the colours of the Hazmat suit just fade in!
---
Oh i love orbital bombardments!
---
will try! wish me luck
---
You could just jump into adventure, open your pip-boy, level up, and leave without actually playing in Adventure.
---
I keep rolling the same two cards! But I gotta try this when I manage to get that melee speed card!
---
The problem is that when you’re level 3 and a 50+ guy shoots you in the starter area it still does 1/4th of your health or so.
---
If you are on PC, set the resolution close to what you want, exit and manually edit the ini file.  Then set it to read only and restart the game.  Expect this will work but have tested it.  If this doesn’t work, just remove the ready only setting and reset it in the game.
---
Get the Can Do perk in luck, Good Doggy perk in Endurance.
---
That's how you stay fed in the wasteland.
---
The boxes don't open. You literally are getting the boxes.
---
They're player icons and stash boxes.
---
You'd feel the same if they broke a perk essential to your build. It isn't the end of the world, or the real world for that matter, but it shows how little effort they put into these patches and play testing them!
---
Nope. For some dumb reason accessing the account database is locked down to whatever platform you are currently using.
---
I can’t even connect in. I get one hour to play today and the server disconnected before I get to workshop
---
RIP stretchy bois.
---
Yea, it’s so fun. Recently I’ve gotten an overpowered Gatling gun and shotgun build.
---
Then don't play it. I find Dark Souls extremely boring, yet and don't go around reddit saying how bad the games are...
---
There is a mod manager that takes 2 seconds to disable or enable your mods again.
---
yup. tried NW some yesterday... I just don't get why people like Battle royal. I also don't understand the running around punching each other bit. To each his own I guess.
---
It's also on PC, fast traveling or dying fixes it
---
Sounds hot
---
Research a bit more before moaning about something you don't understand. Someone was better than you and that is it.
---
I say always save for 3stars I'm currently lvl94 and only have 1 armour piece I wear thats not 3star and its driving me slightly mad. I cant seem to find a good 3 star right leg. My weapon load is also all 3star except my slient sniper rifle which I cant seem to find anything better for distance kills.
---
You just need to rename/move/delete your Fallout76Custom.ini to disable the mods, there is no need to rename all mod files. This would also work for anyone, regardless of which mods the person uses.
---
You ain’t alone man, realised I’ve been waaaay to lazy using vats, now I’m struggling!
---
The influx of new players like yourself has given me something to do again (other than collect screws and aluminium!)
---
I have been running all over the Forest handing out lunch bags (Water, Radstag steak and Dessert) and lvl 5 Brotherhood Recon Rifles.
---
It has been great so see so many new snipers sneaking through the undergrowth!
---
Move, dodge, block and make sure your perk cards and optimal
---
I have aiming problems too, it is so hard to kill some dick running around spaming stimpaks with controler. Especialy with hunting rifle or any other useless bolt action gun. 
---
It is just spray and pray, but really funny one.
---
Same. I learned I was truly incompetent at any kind of pvp situation in Quake III.
---
You kids have fun with your extra xp and loot chests!
---
Thank you for your answers. 
---
I found a fix for lighting:
---
 [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/332?tab=description](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/332?tab=description) 
---
And for strange framedrops:
---
 iPresentInterval = 0
---
in  Fallout76Prefs.ini
---
As soon as you can get the ammosmith perk do it and you'll craft twice and have enough for like 5 events and 6 quests
---
The game was 6-7/10 at launch... I can't see any reason why give it below 5. Yet the metacritic score is skewed by this whole inflated negativity
---
I have blue camp pa skin reward from nw
---
Shhhhhh
---
Don't make them harder man i hate survival mode and don't want to spend time on it. Those nukashine's are going to waste
---
What level are u?
---
16
---
It sucked at launch.
---
I've loved this game from the start! There is always going to be issues with online games, they're constantly under development. But they have listened to their player base and started delivering on their promises. You get the odd asshole player but most people are pretty genuine and try help where they can. Hands down one of my favourite games!
---
The thing people need to realize is that people on youtube want views. The best way to get views is pander to the masses. The mass didn't like the game and was determined to spew that for as long as people listened. I preordered the game, canceled then watched someone play it on twitch and bought it the first week it was on sale. Loved it for all it has improved drastically.
---
Oh ok thanks, the rewards actually look quite good
---
To just close this out, everything went back to working correctly after the update.  Must have just been me as no one else seemed to have the issue.  Glad its working again and I can actually get around.  Thanks for all the suggestions and help.  You peeps are all great.
---
Yeah. Wow is supposed to be dead for at least a decade. Dead now means "the game is different than I want it to be and I can't cope with my feelings"
---
I've done it long ago and didn't know there was a weapon reward. Then again, I've sold very rare outfits for 1 cap to vendors because "my stash was full" and had no idea they were rare.
---
Just a game anyways.
---
Gaaaaary?
---
OH! I mean... uh, y'know what suit is the BEST? The CLOWN SUIT! Wear that! It's... uh, invisible! Totally. I'm not lying.
---
No, I think 121 (something like that) is the highest level we've seen exist so far, as evidenced by the levels required to access terminals and holos dotted around Vault 51
---
Melee in NW is rare, but damn usefull in close quarters, use while inside buildings
---
I mean.. I killed 3 people, they were all just as geared as I was in a 3v1, so somewhat skill based.  I got 4600 xp for a win, which would be insane if you were wanting to level up an alt.
---
Post beta I would crash and had to do the quest 5 or so times. 
---
The not so good old days. I did it on an alt a few months ago and it went fine.
---
Oooooh
---
Or teach them 2 do that, then kill em. That's real teaching right there
---
I am Dimidenko, I am from chernobyl, I did live in radiation, before it was mainstream. Then i moved to 'murica, to work here, for better tomorrows...
---
Some guys took me to this place where they gave me blue elastic outfit with 76number on backs. We was living in underground bunker for 25 years. Whole time they were making fun of my accent. Now, when we are in wild appalachia surounded by nuclear winter, i am gonna get my rewenge motherfuckers.
---
Same here. I’ll keep trying because I want to see if it “clicks” but... yeah. I don’t like killing my fellow dwellers. Never have. I’m more of a teamwork/help folks out kind of guy.
---
Oo, I did not know this. Playing nekkid tonight!
---
Same. Playing a FPS with a controller (I'm on PS4) just sucks.
---
So I also use VATS if I can't safely snipe them. And I avoid NW. Bad memories of trying to get just a single kill in Fortnite...
---
I love this comment so much Jesus Christ
---
Really, really ? Now that's an actual SOLUTION (if it works) thank you ! xxx
---
That is incorrect. I'm rank 20 and i've never seen an enemies emote show up.
---
Remember to dodge, dip, duck, dive and dodge.
---
For the record I asked doe both BR and hard core survival on day 1, and don't really care for adventure. We do exist! There are dozens of us!
---
Wholesomeness ur good person g
---
Scrounging itself is never ending. With the stash limit you save up mats and then do a large repair/craft run and then you have to acquire all of it again.
---
Its just part of the grind, it's not as annoying when you get up to higher levels, it actually becomes therapeutic in a way.
---
Yep. Makes me wonder - there’s a thing about “learning the tragic history of the vault”.
---
I think that would have been content better suited to adventure mode where the v76 player could enter the ruined remnants and find out all about it. Just feels like a disconnect... learning the history while it’s being made? Seems... disjointed.
---
Plus that would mean that they could get rid of the tedious two-minute lobby wait.
---
What kind of a build will you be running it with?
---
You've inspired me. I think I'm gonna do the same on XB1. Cheers!
---
I thought this was actually the way it was going to happen lol. Made no sense to me to put the vault in the world and not be able to activate it in any way.
---
The development phase isn't over yet tho.
---
Just hit level 11 myself and I’m shocked at how much I am loving it.  It’s absolutely hilarious and downright comical sometimes.  So good.
---
*r/gaming told you it sucked, the people most unqualified to judge videogames
---
10 maybe.
---
This could be, however what I'm willing to see is a vault 51 for every player.
---
All i know is that super sledge is expensive as fuck because bloodied and swingspeed is one of the best things out there
---
Search "the fall of 76"
---
I go three stars for armor and two stars for weapons. For me, %50 of the minor prefixes are pretty good, so why not. But don't blame me when you get nocturnal wood armor with #1 charisma and that sweet safecracker bonus.
---
Vault Ted, he's not much of a speller.
---
lol. Most of them still happen with some regularity.  But that's a Fallout thing - If you didn't see something totally hilarious happen with rag doll physics and clipping regularly in Fallout you might think something's wrong.  I remember in FO3 where guys would collect like 500 mines put them in a huge pile and lure an NPC to step on the pile which launched them like halfway across the map.
---
Glad you're enjoying it, I played since the "beta" and my issue was the lack of end game content and the way the higher level stuff drops, I was never too bothered with legendary weapons on fo4 and prefer the fo3/nv style for weapons with there being special variants. I'm aware this wouldnt work in an mmo setting, but I really wish the armour and weapons had a different system. I stopped playing around Christmas because like I said, lack of end game and I'm getting back into it with nuclear winter. I haven't tried survival yet and I'm not looking forward to getting marked by lvl 250's.
---
Excuse me but I came here to talk about Fallout 76, not to be kink shamed.
---
Git gut.
---
Seems the good rewards are much higher up. Chair is at 10, cool statue at 12 and then the really cool stuff seems to start dropping in. The Shark 10mm skin, new pa skins etc.
---
Yep. Bethesda may be sloppy and sometimes out of touch with reality, but they are not stupid. They wouldn't support a game that is dead ("dead" aka noone plays it, not modern "dead" aka I don't like it). If the game was not worth supporting we would end up like Anthem - unfulfilled roadmap and radio silence...
---
To be fair it was a very buggy and shitty game on launch. It’s improved a lot since then. 
---
Personally speaking I enjoy it but would still enjoy it more if it had been true singleplayer with limited co-op. But that’s what I’ve been saying from the very beginning. 
---
Or if they’d release the software so people could run their own private, customizable servers on their own hardware. That’s something else I’ve also wanted from the very beginning and still think would be awesome.
---
8...?
---
Man why not just make it like it is in adventure mode for creatures. Did you hit them? Yes. Then you get xp when they die
---
There is no coercion on my part. That paper bag with a few lockpicks next to a locked Supply Drop is totally coincidental ;)
---
Mine doesnt do it. Literally just get inspect, purchase atoms or back
---
That doesn't work anymore
---
I am.
---
I just tell myself, logical fallacy as it may be, that it used to be much, much worse.
---
Cannot keep raging for any length of time, is exhausting, but I can keep myself soothingly bamboozled all day long :P
---
Still haven't played it, will try soon but it honestly isn't what I would choose.  I hope I like it but PVP has never been my thing I'm into helping not harming but fingers crossed it will be good.  Now that this is out can we fix the hundred other things that are still broke.  I'd like to play without crashing at least once every time I play the game or have some other weird glitch.  And for all that is good fix the vendor lag, I know this was implemented as a way to stop dupping but my god it is horrible to sell the 1400 caps worth of guns to a vendor.  But I'm hoping you're correct that I'll like it because it isn't what I wanted.  Upvote my friend, see you in the wasteland.
---
I just eat spoiled meat,fruit or veggies
---
I disagree. I don't want people to de able to just run forever everytime I start shooting them. If someone wants to be a runner use perk cards.
---
I would watch this youtube video actually.
---
I would’ve thought this was just a fallout 4 screenshot
---
Man, you're really hung up on this whole Alpha/Beta concept. Sounds like the OP was just making the best of an annoying situation, and made a friend in the process. They didn't "bend the knee" to anyone.
---
 Go you OP! Enjoy the game the way you want to!

I agree!! So much fun!!

Take perk cards that increase  your AP or AP refresh rate.  Collect, hotkey and use items that restore AP.

I KEEP TRYING TO VAT SO MUCH ITS INSANE. AND THEN ILL GET INTO THE HABIT OF NOT TRYING TO VAT BUT ILL ACCIDENTALLY DO IT AND BE ABLE TO DO IT ON A CREATURE AND THEN IM STUCK IN VAT MODE AGAIN!
---
Not too much to stock on first 5 levels... And sometimes even 20 (but that's debatable).
---
There's a few places that a good sources of lead. One I know you've been to is the motel just north of flatwoods. There's a little gym on the ground floor that has some weights in it and there's a crafting bench outside a house on the road leading to the church so you can scrap it.
---
As someone mentioned above. After you mark things to search for them it makes it a lot easier to gradually collect things so when you run out of ammo, you'll have built up enough scrap to make your next batch.
---
There's also a perk called ammosmith(under agility I think) tha let's you craft more for the same cost.
---
I'd recommend picking up everything you find and bulking the surplus things you don't need to sell to the vendor bots. Ballistic fiber, ultracite scrap, and black titanium are ones you should hold onto though.
---
Thanks for the reply
---
Make sure you do it at 50, otherwise it'll be whatever level you're at. They changed how it awards things snow.

Fortnite is full of super speed kids dosed with energy drinks.
---
Fallout is more adult game, I killed many people, who looked like they don't have idea, what they are doing in PvP mode. Give it a try, you won't probably win (if you didn't get some pro team), but there are hight chances you could kill someone, and there are camp items as reward, you could do atleast new skin for stash.
---
Should have posted I was talking specifically about NW BR; got no problem in adventure.
---
X-01, I spent days trying to get that from the store when it first came out.
---
Says a guy crying on the internet because strangers don't want to talk to him on a video game.
---
I've been playing this since the launch day. I've some highs and some lows, but the game keeps getting better and better. You just have to accept it for what it is, and go with it. I have met some really good people, from all kinds of places, and I love it. -mroboto
---
Still? Its fix one thing , break 2 more, add content, and not fix shit that's been wrong for months/since launch
---
I saw a post commenting that the artwork in the wastelanders teaser showed a new vault door (59?) , and in fallout lore that vault contained dangerous criminals. It's possible they'll come from there.
---
I play solo and get consistent 10 minute plays, sometimes even down a team or two. But winning as a solo player ... not with my perks. The key thing is to spawn in a less sought out location like Beckley Mine. If there are people on your spawn point, run lime hell and loot on the run.
---
Also solo players get a lot less wait times in my experience, it's just hard to win.
---
Arktos Pharma has a three story all-you-can-loot-buffet.
---
Definitely a mix of experiences I have had multiple games in a row where I either pick a spawn surrounded by others and get whacked in the first 20 seconds or I get a crap weapon and they get a hand made and mow me down lol ( lever vs hand made didn't go well up close) but then I had an awesome game last night also. Got chameleon mutation early and went all in with it and got a team mate to swap me his grenade launcher and gave him my Gatling gun and ensured I kept armor off to allow chameleon to work. We went really far as a team through teamwork and communication (we both were no super stars lol) and unfortunately my team mates died before the end but it came down to me, another guy, and the good old scorch beast and ofc he's in PA and the circle is relatively tiny at this point and he has higher ground. Mexican stand off, I got the drop on him due to scorch beast we exchange gunfire and I managed to come out on top. I got ultra lucky tho, explosive build kind of (bonus to explosive dmg), drugs, and explosive bobblehead made me a monster.
---
Also had some funny moments, some random dude walked up to me and emoted thumbs up and gave me the feeling he wasn't going to shoot me so we kind of had a mutual agreement though emotes not to shoot each other till later lol.

Welcome to Appalachia. I hope you enjoy your stay, for however long it may be.
---
I've been doing this to, but a sudden run in with three mirelurk kings has spooked me a bit. 
---
Now I tiptoe and take moments just to gather my wits about me.
---
For me it's Can Do in whitesprings. Will literally be all the way down the stairs and then the trashcan next to the greeter is like "haha just kidding you forgot this" and I have to go get it
---
Not necessarily. The idea is to be last man standing, so rather then kill as many people as you can, plain survival and staying alive as long as possible any way you can IS a viable tactic. If that happens to be avoiding battle then that's fine.
---
Many gun/power armor paints. I plan on making a post as soon as I find what level the “knight” helmet is at and the beginning of that Red Hot Power Armor
---
Yeah I'm just starting this game and practically nobody uses a mic. Only time I hear something was a kid with really bad faulty mic singing something and talking to himself whole time in a very robotic tone (because of faulty mic).
---
Anyway how the way I see it is you basically follow the highest rank player in the group and stick together regardless. If anyone breaks you'll hardly survive. The game makes you develop a pack mentality. Just stick together and follow the more experienced guy and assist each other. That's it.
---
I don't mind new people but the whinny gimme gimme is the hardest for me to deal with.  I make some armor or gun for  a newbie and suddenly its can you make me this, can I have that.  Trying my best to not be turn on them.  It's a good game but part of it is doing the work of actually playing.  My suggestions to take that gun ammo and armor and get out there, do some quests, learn the basics of actual play and if needed take two seconds to look up something.  I  want to be helpful but I came here for some down time and enjoyment not to use up all my junk and time catering to your whims and whines.  If I don't accept your invite take it as it is don't get all upset and come smack me to get my  attention, your likely to get a different kind of attention.  Anyway rant over sorry.
---
I thought they removed all slap damage?
---
Thanks for the info! I was hoping the majority of the griefers had moved on, and I hadn’t heard about the updates or the E3 trailer. Definitely going to revisit it this weekend.
---
&gt;Much appreciated. This will finally help me decide wether or not the suit is worth those precious atoms.
---
Could be old English
---
"Ye lords and ladies time is neigh go forthe grubbing clad in ye power armor"
---
Go to Documents\My Games\Fallout 76 and rename the .ini files in there to .old
---
Launch the game again and see how it goes
---
I still don't enjoy it. That being said I'm glad everybody else is having fun with it.
---
The best kind!

You can also construct  camps structures on the fly though blueprinting them does not work.  With a good team it cam take less than 20 seconds to assemble a fortress.

Do not place turret kits indoors, they will get stuck in the ceiling.

Turn off your pip boy light.

Dont dress in flashy fashion  if you can avoid it.  Favorite an outfit in the Atom Shop like the camo suit to blend in better. Most players cant tell a person from a bush from a person.

Thx, will try and see how it goes.
---
join the official RFN discord :) you can find the link in the bar to the right, if not, https://discord.gg/falloutreddit is the subs official discord :) loads of people there!
---
I don’t know but I never shot back so PvP shouldn’t have been enabled in that way (I think?)
---
Sweet thanks, big help
---
I'm glad that you enjoyed the game, that anyone was able to enjoy it really, but you have to understand that there was a lot of anger coming from those of us who paid premium for special editions or full price for a game that could only be considered *barely playable* at best in its first months. Then Bethesda fumbled with every effort they made afterwards to fix their little PR disasters that was just basically rubbing salt on the wound (search on youtube and you'll see no end of terrible reviews/commentary about the state of the game).
---
I think that the game is now starting to get decent and if Bethesda was being honest with us that they should have withheld the game until it was actually ready instead of releasing it in the state that they did. Not to say that they are any more or less worse than any other developer with a newly released MMO-type game and that once they get a year or two into patches and content expansions that the game starts to feel like it was fully developed -- talk to anyone who played Destiny from day one until the end for just one example of a game turning itself around once it had time. This is just unfortunately the industry standard for now, massive crunch for developers and rushed products being released before being ready simply to meet an arbitrary deadline to pad the publishers bottom lines.
---
That said, yes, Fallout 76 is miles ahead of where it was on day one and it does seem to be getting better. Hopefully Bethesda can turn this into the Fallout game that everyone was hoping for because I can basically promise we wont be seeing a release of Fallout 5 for a decade at the rate that Bethesda develops their single player games nowadays.
---
1. If you had been paying attention, most people do, but having one useless mute on a team is like driving a car with one flat tire.
---
2. I don't want to chat about your feelings, you weird little pervert. I want you to be able to tell me where that fire is coming from and if you have/need extra gear so that our team can run at peak efficiency. Jesus fucking christ.
---
Actually I had a follow up about workshops whenever I play fallout I find myself claiming a workshop and then right after, leaving the game would you way the best thing to do would be to claim the workshop as the first thing you do?
---
Asshole wouldn’t stand still!
---
That's the idea though in battle royale, you either use perks to help with sprinting/ap regen, or choose to pay more attention to the storm/surroundings in return for dmg perks or whatever
---
Add more biomes as possible maps! Maybe the mire for the next one?
---
Here’s my info dump - hope it helps:
---
Aqua-boy/girl from endurance is very useful - there’s a lot of water about and you have to access it to get dirty water to boil up for drinking and food crafting.
---
Super Duper from Luck is invaluable. If it comes up, get it. You will never, ever regret having this perk.
---
Personally, don’t do what I did. I would say that you need only about five points in intelligence. You can swap your crafting perks around depending on what you’re doing, and those are really the lion’s share of what the int perks are. Focus a bit more on strength and agility, with perception taking precedence over agility if you intend to go heavy into melee or heavy guns. In fact, if you can get strength to 15, with the right perks you have the basis for a pretty amazing mid/late game character. That said - this is advice. Your character, your choices. Plus, who knows? YMMV anyway.
---
Anything that either gives you two of anything when searching (green thumb/butcher’s bounty) or allows you to search a container (remember, you have to click on “search”; it not automatic!) do extra ammo, food, caps etc. Is likewise invaluable early game. They can be found in perception, luck and I think agility. Ammosmith is useful too, especially when you get a high-end weapon with rare ammo, like a .50 HMG or another similar weapon like the infamous handmade rifle.
---
One thing to consider swiping if it crops up in your perk pack is Starched Genes from luck. If you get radiated enough, you may mutate, and you might find that you love your mutation so much that you want to incorporate it into your build. Problem there is that you lose the mutation if you lose enough radiation poisoning, making using radaway to increase your health a bit of a dangerous activity. If you have starched genes (I think there are two ranks) equipped once you have the mutation you want prevents this. 
---
Last bit of advice: don’t stress about it too much. You will make mistakes with your selection of perks. But, you get new packs as you level up, and later on you can even choose to redesign your SPECIAL stats. So, if you mess your character up, don’t worry. You can fix it later on!
---
Best of luck, and I hope to see you out there in Appalachia for a nuka cola and a radroach roast!
---
Is this a Perillo Tours thing? I just usually kick them a basic gun and some ammo, then say "get along little doggie."
---
https://youtu.be/pWdd6_ZxX8c
---
That last tip is an incredible bit of advice. Nice one!
---
Where did they spot you at? I rarely ever see any Kings! 
---
Also: I just killed a Megasloth because I'm trying to farm the Handmade and I know it occasionally drops on them and it didn't and I feel bad. Dude was literally just chillin' in a tree and I only saw him because I VATS'd the area to see if anything was nearby. 
---
I then found a Scoped Handmade on a dumb Super Mutant not even a minute later. :(
---
Don't forget about the 2 hanging RadStags when you harvest the Brahmin.
---
I'm assuming they'll do different maps on rotation.
---
Just take a few moments and really think, and I mean REALLY THINK, about the sort of person who would become a "video games reviewer."  
---
I ignore EVERYTHING they say except for the general idea of GAME IS COMING OUT and just watch a long spot (45 minutes to an hour or more) of uncut gameplay footage.
---
The game is fine. As usual, it's the people playing it who suck.
---
Can you give me the run down on that?
---

It's weird. I'm on pc and my camp's near the overseer's camp. I throw .308 in my vending machine for zero caps and nobody takes it. 5mm is gone in seconds though, but usually to really high levels trying to feed their heavy weapon habit.
---
My laptop aint that good, lol.
---
I dont really need a new one tho, I over indulged with the desktop (4K aus dollars) I just need my laptop to be able too perform simple tasks like buy stuff from the atom store or roam whitesprings for legendaries.
---
I am more impressed by the fact you are already lvl32 in nw haha
---
Same. I had no interest. Didn't like PvP. Never, ever played a BR game before. But this is great.
---
Personally I spawn myself at the overseers camp, loot it, run very quickly to the bridge right next to it, put down my camp and build a concrete piece with stairs so I can get on top of the roof of the thing, and wait. If the storm is coming for me, I move to a spot I am safe and repeat the camp process to somewhere high and hidden.
---
I love the game but it was glitchy as hell to begin with and it's still janky. Doesn't mean it isn't a lot of fun. Just being honest.
---
I think I saw him in a huge settlement with a guy with a bald head and a scar across his left eye. I’m sorry but I don’t know anything else but you should try the detectives office. He might be able to help.
---
I have, and I have to warn you it’s a lame plot twist.
---
Can we see the photos?
---
Buddy i think you never saw combat shotgun+stealth boy combo
---
Have my up but why not all platforms if we're at it?
---
Would be nice even for consoles without the need to exit and re enter constantly for a single message.
---
Doing the Homestead part is "fun". I got killed two times getting hit by guy with a Fatman, so I took out my dusty TS Fatman and managed to take it and then camped there for two hours fragging others who came for the achievement as well. X-01 with stealthboy, TS Auto Grenade Launcher and BE Gatling Plasma for the invisible dudes and Bloodied Primed FFR 50cal against the visible ones. Was "fun" for me lol.
---
The only files under that directory are Saves, Fallout76 and Fallout76Prefs
---
To be fair, this game launched in a state that was absolutely unacceptable.  It deserved the criticism.  It's definitely gotten much better! That's a good thing.  However, the point is it should have never launched like it did.
---
Yeah that's correct, but who knows the origins of this new group. Maybe a vault full of criminals or something lol.
---
So, what did you get for your three rounds?
---
Go to the lighthouse near Vault 76,you can see the top of the lighthouse from the spawn point, if you can see a body hanging over the edge of the platform that will be it. Just server hop until you spot it.
---
Thanks for replying man, you are awesome too, already translate and forward your comment to the artist friend, cheers!
---
I totally get that this game can be played alone or with auto-matching like Nuclear winter if needed, but if you want to hangout sometimes we can do that, too. Most of my mates are on PS4 but I play on BOTH PS4 and PC myself (such a fallout 76 sucker...)
---
Should prob be only allow to spectate from 1st person view. 
---
Third person view with wicked camera movement angle would give the player a huge advantage with spectators calling out plays lol. 
---
But hey if it’s aloud, just another reason why we should team up instead of solo play I guess.
---
What platform are you on? The game is supposed to be like 50% off or something right after the trial.
---
Welcome to Appalachia. Enjoy the exploration.
---
You may need to disable the option 'Hide extensions for known file types' in order to see the extension.
---
Said that for the sake of expediency rename Fallout76 and Fallout76Prefs to whatever you want.
---
Those are the preference files that will be recreated with the default values once you rename the existing ones.
---
I was walking along and I triggered a Mr. Messenger event. What could go wrong? They're easy to do in the Forest, right? This led to me running into a Flatwoods Monster, and all the hubub and commotion triggered the kings near the model home thing (still to new to the area to remember all the names. I was also just getting used to an explosive rifle someone gifted me, so between the kings and me blowing myself up, it was a pretty ugly experience. Still, fun area and the first I've been to with a bunch of legendary enemies just moseying around.
---
Just because he is a higher level doesn't mean they are good, just means they have played the game longer.
---
Could you help fill out this list ?, or if you know another list tell us, at least say things that have been unlocked, thank you.

Sometimes the image of some reward has not loaded me either.
---
On EU gamers have kind of an established tradition of not using mic, ever, with random players. There's language barriers or people being shy because they might not be fluent and sound off so it's almost impossible to communicate with people.
---
I thought PLAYER INTERACTION was the point of this game being online so it's still absolutely mind-boggling bethesda thinks a terrible emote system that limits your interaction to pretty much "hi/come here/bye/ok/no" is okay, with the other alternative being using your real voice which bethesda thinks the average gamer will do on a whim.
---
I found a area loaded with gear and no one ever spawns there. Since it’s discovery I’ve ranked in the top 3 teams playing solo consistently. Only problem is now I can’t play teams because everyone will know my spot. Best advice is check your challenge list a lot of easy challenges to get a quick couple perk cards.
---
I pre-ordered too. I think alot of hate, mine included, is from fans who spent thier money on the full priced version and got an unfinished game in return. It was a kick in the nuts when they price dropped and offered nothing to the fans who bought into the prelaunch hype. 
---
 I was part of a large PS4 community of 100+ players that was a part of launch day. Due to all the bugs and glitches, it took only about a month for everyone to quit playing. The hate was deserved in my opinion.
---
Holy sea buiscuit this is beyond
---
Thx, the game is fixed now so I’ll be on my way too the wasteland!
---
Ditto.
---
Would love to but I am in GMT.
---
Chances are I will be at work - like now - while you are awake and wandering WV while you sleep ;)
---
Working long hours 7 days a week makes for a solitary gaming existence :P
---
It just works
---
Bloodied ss like the previous person said. Ask whatever you want..I’d sell it for 3000 but I’ve seen weapons like that go for way higher
---
People still use the explosive shotguns so someone would give you maybe 1500 caps for it, especially being pump as they seem to do more real damage 
---
The furious grognak is a good weapon but not hugely expensive
---
The assassins plasma, while I love my plasma, that prefix makes it scrip IMO
---
no but it would be really funny if you did.
---
No Sir.   It turns off automatically upon joining the game mode.
---
I went on a whim and bought this on release date, can honestly say this game was definitely worth 60 bucks imo because the amount of time I sunk into it. Definitely fun especially with friends. Now you can have your own vendors and all that it's even better. I do miss the 2 shot explosive damage before they nerfed them. Felt like demi gods wielding those
---
Launch was bad, now is good
---
Good stay in you're adventure lane kid
---
Pleasure :) Fun travels!
---
🤣👍
---
Just turned 40 but thanks for making me feel young.
---
That's a good tip; thanks.
---
At  least u knew it was a dumb question lol good luck
---
Yeah I didn't say the highest ranked player is good, they just played longer and yes, more experienced in a way. Ultimately you need to stick together regardless. I don't think anyone can really stand a chance being solo
---
I actually really like the chair
---
Well you had to be "that guy"
---
i’m currently shopping for a new build! i’ve got a completely useless halfway build i call “retrieve your loot bag” ᕕ(ᐛ)ᕗ for some reason or another i got it into my head that i needed an all unyielding armor set with barbarian?? and i have made it to level₅₈ dying at ever encounter with five or more enemies my level...
---
what’s yours?
---
You welcome enjoy it while it lasts
---
Never trust the media. They make a living out of painting dramatic tales of negativity - often with a hidden agenda if not simply the agenda of growing their own exposure as the expense of honesty. The truth is out there but most people just listen to whoever shouts loudest.
---
Agreed! I also dont think a slight nerf on active time for either would be a bad idea for NW.
---
Don’t get me wrong, I really do hope it’s the case. I have a huge magazine collection now and would love to display them.
---
I set up camp near the overseers camp and im selling purified water for 3 caps, free wood and cloth and selling stuff like army helmets and gasmasks for 5 caps
---
Its great to see new players in the starting area. Glad you are enjoying yourself, and hope others share your enthusiasm.
---
Blue camo pa skin at level 15
---
Damn -- that's game changing.
---
What I have collected of rewards and some perks
---
You gotta try to get a team with headsets. It helps so much when u can communicate.
---
Yeah I don’t really mind if we keep third person or not. I just really want first person spectating. With my experience of the third person spectating, they won’t be giving an advantage at all.
---
I'm glad you're enjoying yourself! I personally have been playing since launch, and even with its rough start, have enjoyed every minute. Ive always felf the small issues that existed in the early days weren't AS bad as people made them out to be, I mean, we all remember backwards invincible dragons right? But Bethesda has been fairly consistent about repairing said issues. 
---
So as others have said, it's always best to form your own opinion,  media sources such as youtubers will almost always lean on negative hype because people are obsessed with drama.
---
Get the fuck out of here bro, you're talking fucking shit. 
---
&gt;run at peak efficiency 
---
Doesn't have friends, a team or even join a Discord server. 
---
Get over the fact people don't want to to you, you  arrogant fucking weeb freak
---
I had a gut feeling this would happen when i was reading the patch notes
---
Its on for a week from the day after the conference i believe. Give it a go.
---
Nah. Just this time.
---

I love this so much! Hahaha
---
Can someone tell me how to turn stormtrooper mode off?
---
I haven’t killed a single person yet.
---
I'm a solo player of this game. Doing my damnedest to get a solo experience from it. I don't play this game for other people; and prefer to interact with others as little as possible. 
---
Using a mic and interacting with people would literally defeat the purpose behind how and why I play the game. 
---
The only time I use a mic in this game is if I'm talking to my other friends who don't play FO76 in our clan's private TS3 server while I'm playing.
---
Yeah it'd be nice if we could at least scrap any excess ammo to use for crafting types we need. Quite often i have to just dump a load of ammo because it's taking up stash space and no-one seems interested in taking it off my hands for free
---
Yeah. I was interested by it, I do like BR games, but I was so worried about how it would work, how it would be received, whether it would just get publically battered by the haters. But I'm really happy with the result. I think it's the best thing they've added so far in terms of how well it works. Few QoL additions, but other than that you just pick up and go. Love it.
---
My only issue is it can be boring in end game without friends to play with 
---
That’s why I like the new battle royale mode
---
Thanks. Didn't think so, was hoping for a reason why. .. I'm getting my arse kicked 😂😂
---
If u can doge a wrench u can dodge in NW
---
Yes that's true too. It may be, canonically that the Vault 76 dwellers launched the nukes that sealed the fissures but caused the nuclear winter firestorm and Zax kindly opened the door to offer them "shelter" while the storm passes.
---
You can create a custom .ini file to make it 1360x768. I forget the exact line you need but there is definitely a solution.
---
Doesnt work with the under armor. Not sure if it's intentional or not
---
I only meant if they fixed the camera pending/control for spectators. Be like having guardian eyes trolling around watching your back lol. Having someone call out targets in the tree line behind you that you shouldn’t see is a big advantage. 🤷🏼‍♂️.  
---
But ya I’d would like a first person view for sure 👍🏼
---
funny thing here, he did not think to ask others.  every event, i ask for all the meats.  every one is happy to oblige.  never short on ingri.
---
Stealth Rifleman with furious suppressed handmade. It's doing what I like to call, "the work" and it's kinda my baby in this game. Covert Op, Sneak, and Escape Artist are my favorite perks in the game.
---
10xp per kill.
---
I think its better to hide and get to top 3 if you want more xp.
---
That's so bad, do it for the money man!  
---
Remember to have some nukashine after every hard working day :D
---
Agreed sticking together is a must!!
---
Yeah hopefully when it's out of beta we all have to start fresh and they release some survival specific stuff to do so that it keeps it interesting for players who have already done all the quests.
---
Maybe using the personal terminal to give you daily challenges that reward caps, scrip, ammo or repair kits.
---
In the vault 112 simulation there was a series of hidden mechanics to reveal the control panel, I wonder if vault 51 had you similar hidden tricks yet to be found. 
---
If it's not a simulation then I don't see how canonically it can stand with the rest of 76 and it's ongoing story since inevitably all the dwellers would die except one, which cannot lead to the wastelanders dlc. .
---
I think they need to be a little harder - no kill 25 legendary enemies harder - fuck that - but at least make it so you run some risk in Survival, whether it’s by having to travel around the map, or something similar. This week’s challenge is the easiest one we’ve had so far.
---
Lmao. Funny stuff.
---
Kill people, down people, revive people. Your combat style does not affect your xp but rather your chances to kill people. Avoiding confrontation will definitely alter negatively, as this is a pvp mode (but you still get xp based on the minutes you survived(
---
Oh right. Yeah first person only is the way to go.
---
Always get them too :) yum!
---
Agreed sticking together is a must 100%
---
I'd be glad to take you up on that but I'm on PC unfortunately.
---
Due to the way the DR system works wouldnt this mean effective damage increase will always be more than 50%? Unless the target has literally 0 armor?
---
the problem is people had 3 major problems
---
1. They (a mix of youtubers, articles, and bethesda) over hyped the game till it was so insanely regarded that it was basically impossible to meet the expectations of the super fanboys that had a mental image of the perfect game they always wanted and nothing could ever have come close to.
---
2. A large number of people who tried it and hated it have never played a mmo so common mmo issues in early days they had no reference to things people who have played day 1 mmo's have seen before.
---
3. The game actually was pretty buggy. Not going to sugar coat it they really had a ton of bugs early on I'm honestly not sure how many were caused by the number of players and how many were just flat out they released the game to early. They really should have had a 3-6 month long beta to get the major bugs out of the way before 1.0 release it would have given them a lot more cover as they could have pointed out it was a beta and given them at least some wiggle room.
---
You seem like you can't fucking get enough.
---
I'm not going to wade through your degenerate metagame.

---
Welcome to the wasteland friend.
---
Yes, that was kind of what I meant, does the xp from “surviving” outweigh the risks of killing? Is it better to kill 10 and die or get to the last 3 from hiding and the xp placement bonus that it brings?
---
It's really refreshing to see such a friendly community.
---
We now have damage numbers, have someone you know test it
---
When did they change it? Just had my lvl 27 toon complete it 2 days ago and it gave the lvl 50 unstoppable monster.
---
I'm just wondering what the hell I'm doing wrong, nearly always die within 30 seconds of entering the match.
---
Overwatch's current meta is just stagnant, but people usually forget that word exists (along with a few others) so they just us buzzwords like "dead" and "mistake" usually ending the title of the article off with a question mark
---
Are you on PS4??
---
Keep in mind they are calling it a sneek peek. Its possible they are gathering data and feedback before they release other regions. Pure speculation ofc.
---
Someone *really* like camping
---
And the vault suit is 1 pound, think of all the extra stuff you can carry without it
---
Haha! This is is exactly what I'm talking about. Things like that really make an impact on new players. Keep up the good work!
---
So far I've found it a fun community.  I've had some waves and ran into a guy in a spacesuit looking for a lost spaceship.  I'm still not sure if he was serious or that was a roleplay.  I may actually throw my mic on from time to time if it keeps like this.  
---
I actually said semi-popular on purpose as I'm not sure I want it to turn as popular as something like Fortnite.  I didn't even avoid it because of reviews, but mainly because of the online aspect.  I've just grown annoyed with how the MP games have turned into either hyper-competitive toxic PvP or MMOs where you have to schedule your life around your game.  I've done both and I've moved on from that at this point.  I play games more to chill/relax and neither of those game types do that for me.  If I can keep roaming/building/questing as I have so far I'm fine meeting people and doing multiplayer things as long as it doesn't hit a brick wall where I have to join a clan and schedule three nights a week from 8p-12a to go raid the mirelurk cave to get the "phat lootz" then I'll be around a while.
---
I'm on Xbox, but I do appreciate the offer.  I won't be around any this weekend anyway.  Besides, it feels so much like FO4 to me that the learning curve has been zero.
---
I think it's cool how he acknowledges the community :: cough cough:: and all of the wonderful suggestions, which we know where the majority of them came from 😁
---
In response to #3: I had just assumed that the way you have to fully rejoin a new server and how slapped together the whole startup seems, was just a placeholder system for the sneak peak week. As in hopefully they have a smoother system for when it acctually gets released
---
Fallout 76 players: There isn't enough CAMP budget.
---
Also Fallout 76 players:
---
You did nothing wrong. Unfortunately thats just how the game works. In the future always click to try another server
---
That's why I don't trust the hate bandwagon anymore. They're pretty much the emotional appeal of entitled crybabies trying to sound smart. Basically, they portray themselves as the "cool" kids saying "this is lame". 
---
This is happening more and more these days. Everything sucks now. It's like a bunch of pessimistic fucks came out of the woodwork. The last season of GoT wasn't the best, but people are acting like it's the worst thing in the world. Making it seem worse than it is. And it's all to manufacture this fake drama bullshit, get clicks, and views.
---
Yeah ot would be nice, however whithout proper keyboard for the console, trying to type whole sentence on the controler, would be simply tedious.
---
Yes, I hope and thought the same. Hoping this really is a beta and they listen to the suggestions and bugs
---
Not yet. Mic is highly recommended.
---
Ya I've been having that happen. Also had this wierd thing happen where aiming my gun didn't slow my move speed, almost seemed to make me faster, was super disorienting :P
---
:/
---
Have fun :)
---
Make friends. I spent months soloing (and enjoying it) but recently I made friends with a few other players and it's been a blast. You can do some quests that would be normally far above your level and get some great exp boost(15%).
---
Don't scrap and stash everything your stash will fill up quicker than you think.
---
I hate BR games and I hate nuclear winter. It's derivative, uninspired tripe.
---
You were unlucky I think. The safest option when your camp can't be placed is to quit back to main menu and restart to find a new server manually. The option to automatically try to find another server can result in you needing to reprice everything in your vendor machines. The option to move camp for free is not something I've tried - I thought it would require rebuilding everything. 
---
So I  haven't seen your issue before- seems to be a fairly specific set of circumstances and it shouldn't happen again.
---
The game was absolute trash at launch but has gotten WAY better, to the point that it's one of my favorite games in the franchise.
---
I sometimes watch Fortnite twitch streams and the time they have to wait in the lobby being 'matched' always surprises me...
---
No classic 10mms?
---
How do you quit back to main menu? I usually have to ctrl-alt-delete myself out of the game when this happens
---
People somehow plant vegetables/trees on them
---
Ok thanks for answering :)
---
I'll not bother with it then if you can lose everything for no reason. I don't see the point in starting from scratch every time I log on. Don't see the point
---
Pity they didn't put stay on this world means for free but you lose all your camp. I would of picked the other option
---
So basically like the main story ?
---
I thought that had been patched.
---
TThe regular Fallout sub went back to being extremely cancerous towards the game, and when you try to point out that Fallout76 has a good solid community that continues to grow they respond with:
---
"Metacritic reviews are all negative" and then they all just continue to downvote you.
---
Like uhh yeah the game didn't have a solid launch and most people just review bombed it without playing because they didn't get Fallout 5 and were pissed that Bethesda tried something new.
---
It's really sad how biased and hateful people are.
---
Open the map (M) and bring up the menu (Z) and you should be able to quit to main menu or quit to desktop. Doing either before restarting will put you on a new map.
---
I have been seeing it a lot lately, last few days
---
Somone woke up early...
---
You only lost your camp because of the crash otherwise it should have let you put down the building in another suitable location
---
&gt; There was a lot of truth to his review, but at the same time his review was skewed. It featured video of other people's bugs, not just his own. Compiled together, it made the game look vastly worse than it was
---
Uhhh... what kinda argument is that?
---
With the recent patch it looks like. Just did it on a level 48 and it gave a level 45 salt of the earth. Last week I did the unstoppable monster at 44 and it gave a level 50.
---
That is an option?! But not sure if I want to use it.
---
What kind of times do you see?
---
I don't mind the launch reviews, but anything recent that's negative are just people circlejerking their of outdated opinions.
---
Everytime i see a post like this i have to jump in and approve entirely, i have to play just some hours a week cause i can't interact a lot with other player since i cannot use mic during the hours i usually play...a text chat will be the salvation for me :D
---
At launch! He kept it going well into 2019.
---
Yeah I posted about it. Bethesda replied. They are looking into that. Correction meant to be implemented in mext patch.
---
What’s the mechanic for gaining weapons?
---
I’ve played four matches and have never lived more than two minutes before being shot dead with nothing but fists to fight back with.
---
When i read the patch notes i asked myself "i wonder if they tested gun fu".... 
---
I got my answer 30 mins later on reddit.
---
   Of course he did , that's why griefer's grief. It is to establish dominance, its all about taking power and control from people in order to feel better about themselves and fill the social drive of our primitive monkey brain to climb 1 step higher on the food chain. the drive to hunt, gather, build, and overcome obstacles is exactly why we game anyway. we do the thing, fullfill the drive, release the dopamine, rinse repeat. It is literally the source of our enjoyment of Video games. 
---
   The problem I have is that the alpha in question Isn't a good alpha. he is a wannabe alpha. a true alpha eats last and protects the tribe. he makes the tribe stronger through cohesion and team work because he is smarter than the wannabe apha and understands that the more the tribe cooperates the stronger the tribe becomes. 
---
   The wannabe alpha is just not as intelligent and seeks the brute force approach which has better short term results but bad long term results. Also he is more likely to abuse the members of his tribe to maintain his status. 
---
   I predict wesjc and his new friend will hang out, his alpha pal will F with him from time to time until he is desensitized and no longer annoyed at the alpha wasting his game time. then he will come to beleive its the social norm and then impose said social norm onto other players outside of his tribe. when they do not smile and bend the knee he and his alpha friend will gank them and will accuse them of being weak and broken when in fact he is following a weaker lower intelligent alpha as a beta. 
---
  over all the alpha beta relationship will create toxicity and reduce the health and well being of the overall community. which as a wanna be alpha he will never even comprehend because hes just another moron. if you have to explain why some behavior is bad too a person chances are they are going to be dumb to understand it anyway. most of us just intuitively get it just by being average or higher intelligent humans. its not their fault they were just born stupid and aggressive. luckily battle royal will most like continually scratch that itch to fight and establish e-dominance and we wont have to deal with them in adventure mode as often.
---
Thanks for answering :)
---
The other bloke said I should click the choose other world option. And that this is how the game works. 
---
I'm not going to bother with it. I wasted all day yesterday on it to be back at the start again, I don't see the point in redoing the boring grind every day
---
But that's not what your OP is asking for
---
idk man, my character is a huuuuuuuuge qt
---
Theres never a benefit for winning in other BR, so... You just get more exp
---
You need to chill. You realize you sound like the crazy douchebags on tv people make fun of for being so hung up on the alpha beta thing. It's a game, I was fucking around.
---
It was last I checked, at least it didn't work the other day when I tried it.
---
It did let me but most of it was missing. :(
---
Everyone answering is contradicting each other
---
I always thought they came mostly from the Ski Resorts. We know their leadership at least came from the Top of The World.
---
Ah the good ol “ you browse T_D” move lol
---
In other br you can get skins and stuff for winning
---
Ah. Yeah, I'm sure there are some AP boosting cards that you'll be able to unlock in NW at some point though.
---
That's certainly what I am hoping to accomplish! I didn't particularly have a distaste for the game back when it launched. I did a lot of what there was to do but the bulk of my game time then was a lot of solo play. Can't say I'm too interested in the solo game again, at least until NPC's are around, but it'll still be far more entertaining to have another person around!
---
The .45 SMG and commando is fantastic gun for close range, not even much recoil to control
---
I'm having trouble figuring out how to post them from my Xbox to here without making a whole new post lol
---
I don't quite know enough about the math about it, but I believe it depends on where you already are on the curve, since as far as I understand, it steeply drops off before 50% and steeply curves back up after 50%
---
Go play those then??
---
And thats lame.. They made it so you can stuff by lvling up which is more friendly.. Not anyone is a tryhard nor good at BR
---
I'm on Xbox and it is 50 percent off. But I'm forgoing work to help my wife with her very very sick mother, I'm compensated in other ways, but day to day money is a no go for me, I hardly can keep up with my gamepass and gold.
---
There will probably be atom rewards for "winning five br" and such.
---
And yet if they only played 20 hours you’d still dismiss their review by saying they didn’t even experience the game.
---
I'm not complaining jackass. I'm asking if there is a system I dont know about.
---
Pretty much! I like the seven card limit in NW, makes for some challenging optimisation.
---
How did you get 1000xp from losing? I still end up with around 600 exp when getting like 7 kills and second place, then 1000+ with the same kills and first place.
---
In the challenge tab it tells you you get a perk for winning 5 matches or winning five in your underwear or winning 5 in power armour. Apart from that I have no idea
---
Click scan and repair in your launcher.
---
Its lame to reward people for being competitive in a competitive game mode?
---
LMAOOO I wish this was just a copy pasta so bad what is wrong with you. You are not an alpha you are loser my friend lol
---
Go to modify/repair inspect and press the button that says workbench repair
---
Depends on AI killed and placement as well
---
And that is a redirect of blame, trying to establish faults in others instead of owning any responsibility or acknowledgement of personal culpability. typical beta behaviors I would expect no less.
---
I'm aware, but to be fair, again... Bethesda did kinda keep screwing shit up.  The bag scandal, the information leaking, the Repair Kits in the Atom shop, the Bobby pins weight, etc etc.  The game is fun, I have fun with my friends.  But that doesn't excuse the massive mistakes that Bethesda made along this journey.  It's good people keep on reporting it because you have to try (keyword try) to keep companies honest.  It's just not been a smooth ride man.  Of course shitting on it gets the clicks too and people have hammed it up for views.  But you can still enjoy this game and realize that it, even now/recently still has problems that deserved to be talked about.
---
I'm definitely a "solo 4 life" type of player, but yeah, try to make it a few friends, even with much higher levels (don't be me at level 10 and get freaked out when they're around). It's good just to chat once in awhile, and they can offer good advice, and even help in a pinch. If lower level players came up and asked me nicely for ammo, stims, and whatnot, I'd surely help them out (really helps to have a mic in this game unless you really don't want to interact much with others).
---
Also, don't allow the few jerks out there to spoil the whole game for you. Just block them and move on with it.
---
You get those sweet cosmetics. It shows you at the end of every match what rewards you're close to.
---
You can still repair the old way with scrap but it's behind another menu in the crafting menu to accommodate for the new kits. While in the repair/modify portion of the crafting menu (default space for me) press T for the repair menu and then R for scrap repair and T for kit repair.
---
I want that PA skin.
---
Well it would be nice if you had stuff like that available to bring but again i ment more flashy stuff haha. Like in other online games or almost anime looking stuff
---
Youre just whining tbh.. Theres nothing wrong to do things differently. Go play fortnite buddy, you'll fit right in.
---
Workbench or repair kits.
---
Look at the keybinds at the bottom of the screen - when you pick something to repair at a workbench, now there are separate options for workbench repair (same as always, fix with junk) and repair kits. If you have repair kits you can also use them directly from your inventory by inspecting the item you want to repair.
---
No, you dont need a kit. Choose to modify and then you must press inspect/repair (its something like that) than press repair.
---
If you have pacifist mode on, you can't engage PVP.
---
The word "Free" almost always brings people out from the shadows. 
---
 I would have to assume the majority of them won't play past the free week.
---
Oh, yea, I forgot about that one....
---
  I was thinking about the effect that enrages a target for X seconds, followed by X seconds of ambivalence....
---
Go to the appropriate workbench.
---
Press the option for modify/repair.
---
Press the option for repair.
---
Press the option for workbench repair.
---
I agree it's less intuitive than it used to be.
---
The scorch queen drops them, and you can buy them in the atom shop. You don't need to, though. As YEEYEE85 said, you can repair at the crafting table.
---
Haha! and wake up in The Mire afterwards? I would never make it back to work :P would end up as gulper fodder :P
---
This guy is insane lol. But yes I knew I was never in any real danger, I did not shoot back so he was really doing nothing. I was playing along, could I of blocked him or moved servers or whatever else? Yeah. But then I wouldn't have this story.
---
Probably looking better than female GTA characters lmao
---
I've seen a lot of opinions, speculation, and other info (Data miners have pushed a lot of different info) on the Furious effect, but often thought it seemed better, at least on some weapons. The most commonly accepted numbers from the Data miners suggests a 6% increase per shot, maxing out at 40%, but those numbers never made sense to me. I have also been getting really strange numbers from some enemies that suggest they have significantly more armor on certain body areas, and the shots even act as though you are hitting a different enemy, for instance on a SB; Torso Hits: 20, 24, 28, Wing Hits: 10, 12,14, Back to Torso: 20, 24, 28 again. So there is a lot going on with the damage equations that's hard to make sense of, but seeing the actual HPs is really valuable in fine tuning your build, and selecting which weapons to use.
---
To be fair, there's a difference between you liking the game and the game being good. You can like a shit game. That's perfectly fine.
---
That being said, this game is miles ahead of what it was at launch. But it's still pretty shit in terms of quality. You're not having major bugs or crashes, but many many people still are. The servers still suck. The latency and lag and hit detection issues are still there. It's still a mess. But now it's a mess with some content as opposed to when it launched.
---
Glad you're enjoying it though.
---
You're being a fucking dick because I thought there must be some kind of reward for winning... because that's what winning usually means, you beat everyone else at something and WIN something... why dont you go join tumblr "you'll fit right in".
---
Lol thanks for the dislike. Is it my fault that the game crashes all the time?
---
Why are we bargaining this? Lol
---
He is just dedicated to his rp
---
Oh yeah? Well I'll take your advice and just block the assholes. See ya buddy no use spouting your nonsense anymore, you blocked
---
&gt; I have no idea where to get these kits.
---
I know you can buy them in the Atom Store. Hopefully you can get them in game as well, but since restarting the game with a new character, I haven't come across any. Maybe they're quest / event rewards at higher levels.
---
 "And that is a redirect of blame, trying to establish faults in others instead of owning any responsibility or acknowledgement of personal culpability. typical beta behaviors I would expect no less. " literally sent during the same time you called me a losr. 
---
and yes I am an alpha. I am rich, I have mated and created life,I have went to war..and now I am on the declining portion of my lifespan surrounded by a world full of noobs.
---
That sounds like an internet problem not a game server problem.
---
You crazy
---
Pm me your address, I'm about to order you a copy.
---
You are insane
---
Thanks for the answers. I must have missed the option last night to repair with the bench instead of a kit.
---
Endgame mainly looks like finding the best gear for your playstyle, doing nukes, taking on the scorchbeast queen or the sheepsquatch imposter or if you like to build just adding on to your camp like me lol. There's also more vaults aside from 51 opening later this summer with PVE vault raids.
---
Did you check the "stored" tab in the camp building interface? Your place may not be intact but all the individual pieces of it should be there, I think. You may have to rebuild, but it's not from scratch.
---
Holy shit you're nuts
---
Fucking wack job
---
Wait wait whoa what? You don't have to do that!
---
I like to give out some cranberry cobbler to new players if I have some on me. +5% XP is always appreciated.
---
Always great to see new ps4 players feel free to add me Thydus-_ on psn and ill gladly lend a hand to any new peeps tryna launch their first nuke etc.
---
Nope
---
Damn dude, youre crying too much.. 
---
You're too sensitive and ita pathetic.. Boohoo, Bethesda made it so everyone can try to get sweet stuff and youre whining cause you cant have exclusive stuff for your own
---
Sorry but the detective is not here, he's been missing for some time.
---
Yeah that happens to me too sometimes. You need to shut down the game to get put into another server.
---
Because it was a broken and buggy mess, even more so than we’re used to from Bethesda…so he was right.
---
I think I watched like a half of one of his videos when I was thinking about buying 76. Figured he was just some click baity asshole and looked elsewhere.
---
No, unfortunately.
---
And there you go boasting again.  Stick to your award winning posts about suggestions.
---
It's $17 on Amazon.
---
You came on here and didn't whine and complain about this and that, I'll buy you a copy so you can keep playing and enjoying it.
---
Treat other players the way you want to be treated.
---
If both of you are in "team", you should be able to see the quests on your screen as well.
---
I made a new toon and got to lv31. Starched genes, one freebie mutation that i need later, lets go find a vendor.... it took a while and i overpaid. Due to usually having more than half the players being from the free trial.
---
But an influx of new players is worth 1000 caps or so that i overpaid. Ill get them back soon enough.
---
I never said people who dont win shouldn't get stuff you ignorant trolling little fuck boy. I was saying there should be a bonus for winning. It just makes since. That's what winning is. I see you removed your dumb ass comment too, maybe you realize what a fucking idiot you look like.
---
This whole interview was just how many different ways can we ask/tell Todd howard fallout 76 was bad.
---
Perhaps she just stumbled into some bad lighting?
---
To be fair, it only took a couple hours at launch to see the shitty state the game was in. Also Mr Matty Plays is typically a school for Bethesda games. So for him to say not to buy it was saying something.
---
It’s random at this point, don’t think that’ll ever be an option!
---
Haha, at least they looked consistently awful :D
---
Ah back then the secret was simple.  If you wanted it on the first floor you took the ceiling out for a minute.  Wanted it on the second floor?  Don’t take the ceiling out.
---
I did this for the first time yesterday!  
---
Dragged my over-encumbered ass to a vendor camp, bloke has conventional weapons and armour for sale and locked his bloody work benches away too!  
---
Git got a bag full of rotted food on his bed.
---
No bud, on XB1
---
I agree 100% with you. I check this sub regularly because I really like the fallout franchise but no way I was gonna give my money at launch with no NPCs in the game.
---
Giving it a go with the trial, so far I'm enjoying it, performance is not great all around, game is entertaining enough but feels like a beta version to me still. Sure its stable, but I don't think there is enough  content to warrant a finished game - if you discount the BR mode.
---
Increase your endurance and agility and use the marathoner perk
---
It's sad you are getting downvoted for that. With as many gaming youtubers who do, that's a saving grace.
---
(and I'll admit I do find Angry Joe amusing though I'm sad about hearing how unfair he was to 76 and yes he gets views by rants so he is totally motivated to make something sound as bad as possible when he's ranting about it).
---
Unfortunately you need to trigger the quest yourself. You can co-op the quest of course but you cannot “share” the quest if one of you did not trigger it. There are also some quests that do not have markers, they are simply notes find in the world and as you find clues throughout your travels, they lead to a reward or a conclusion to a story.
---
Just change the option to fill team to solo before you join the world, it's much more fun!
---
There's a difference between giving criticism and feeding the toxic fire that began to surround the game purely for its existence. Many of the YouTubers took up the opinion of whichever camp would garner the most views rather than going into it objectively and finding their own problems.
---
The whole thing with the repair kits I never understood anyway, realistically the number of people that focus on PvP aren't going to need to use repair kits because they've already sorted all their gear out and even if they were going to use them it means going into their inventory and repairing the stuff.
---
I understand people were upset with the principle or it but they are in no way game changing or advantageous to the larger community. I, for one, have never better one and don't think I'll ever see the need for one.
---
You even need to already have the plans to make use of the generator skins so that there's no advantage to players at the start, even though you can get the large generator plans, or even the fusion, very early in the game.
---
If I remember correctly, fallout BR has a overseer rank which rewards you with a new item each time. From what I heard the rewards for each rank get better after 10+ or so.
---
Some screenshots might help.
---
I'm at rank 20. The rewards are cool but I meant why isnt there a bonus for actually winning.
---
There isn't a stored tab &amp; I cant get near the camp box thing whatever it is for more than a second at a time because three robots attack every time
---
Thanks, will do.
---
Seriously. I realize they are trying to review it so have to play enough to get a good feel, but you can do that in 30-40 hours. By 100 hours you've long gone past figuring out what you like/dislike about the game and are just enjoying it.
---
5 minutes 10 minute in the extreme, but we're talking huge player numbers being filtered I guess to make the 100 people lobbies. 
---
Bethesda I expect will be optimizing the servers for NW :D
---
Gonna assume it’s because this is just a sneak peek and not finished yet :)
---
Satan should be so lucky!
---
Jeez dude, what are you 5? Stop crying and having a stroke..  No one is trolling, youre just upset and sensitive cause you didnt like the responses you got which wasn't even that bad. I really feel bad for you , IRL must be tough on you
---
Makes sense.
---
And assuming all the individual pieces are in storage, once you've rebuilt it, you can "blueprint" the design so that it rebuilds it quickly next time you move came - whether by choice or not.
---
If this is recent I had read other threads that posited a glitch that would automatically apply facial damage cosmetics but I don't really have much info.
---
With a decent build, you can do any of the current in-game content without any legendary gear. The only real "exceptions" would be the encryptid and scorched earth events, since those are large bosses that usually a good bit of the server comes to help out with (since it's a server-wide announcement). It's probably still possible to do without legendary gear, but it's impossible to test unless you filled an entire server with only your friends that all agreed to do that. The new project paradise event might be the only thing coming close to impossible without it, since the final fight against an alpha enemy is "timed" in the sense that your animals are always at risk of getting one-shot and failing the event
---
I'm not sure what others do, but I at level 228 and with 490 hours in the game still have fun walking around the map finishing up challenges and going through dungeons. I don't really like going out of my way just to grind legendaries, but the most common things to do for them is to go to west-tek (many mutants, you usually get a couple legendaries and some decent loot, not unusual to find multiple 3* mutants), whitesprings (mainly golf club), and the burrows. You can do them with or without nuking them, but I believe people only really do the burrows when it's nuked. The overall experience is that most of the stuff is either bad or a good roll for a weapon you don't use, so it's pretty exciting (although rare) to find a new good weapon for yourself after you already have something decent. 
---
There are also tons of things to work towards if you're a completionist, and many rare things that require tons of runs through a certain area or event. For example, the encyrptid event has a rare chance of giving you a plan for the fixer, a unique "legendary" combat rifle that increases your stealth. Allegheny asylum has a rare chance of dropping you colored asylum outfits. You can rarely find a charleston vendor bot in two spots, and that bot can rarely have unique outfits you can't get anywhere else. If you enjoy the gameplay loop, you'll have things to do for a very long time, and keep in mind that by the time you reach end-game there will already be more new stuff
---
Eh.... I'd probably want them to get to 30 hours but 20 hours should be enough to get a general feel. But 100 hours you've definitely gone past a good feel for the game and into you're enjoying it.
---
The grind from 100-200 is your collection and multiple ranking of Perk Cards to min-max your character's performance, fine tuning your weapons and gear, and hiding in bushes chuckling as low levels run by you with mole rats biting their ankles :)
---
If you have the xbox app save the photo and post them on imgur
---
Its because all I eat is dog food :(
---
No, its because you immediately go with that dumb bs. "Go play something else if you dont like it". Go the fuck on you little troll
---
Plenty of musical instruments and beds for those sweet xp boosts
---
Should be able to scan your own face or a photograph and create a character from that!
---
This is going down as the nicest thing anybody on the internet has ever done for me. Thank you
---
Yeah 5 mins is a long time to me. Even the 2 1/2 ive got is a bit lengthy. Because im playing with someone who isnt amazing at shooting we tend to lose and die pretty quickly. Longest we lasted was 10 mins but died in our first fight lol
---
I've been itching to try it for ages. I saw it down to £15 on console but it's always £25+ on PC. From the original release to the post release support I knew I didn't want to give them more than £15 though. 
---
Actually bought it for £15 on Saturday as I was trading in some old junk due to a house move. Only just got around to playing for 10 mins before work this morning and  it seems promising. It looks and feels a lot better than 4 so far, interested to get into the meat of it tonight.
---
I do not like either after 5 games and funny thing is in one game I could not get a gear and hide near a cliff edge whole game and I won.. WTF right? :)
---
Did the SBQ yesterday and it capped out after about 15-20% increase.
---
Bloody mess is a 9-luck perk, it boosts your damage by 15% with all weapons. Briefcase detector requires 9 perception, and marks any nearby nuke briefcases on your compass. Gun runner requires 6 agility and makes you move 20% faster with a pistol equipped.
---
The game crashed at least 8 times the first day I played it, not to mention some other bugs. Literally stalker was more stable.
---
Also, some people enjoy cutting themselves.
---
The very first weapon "crushing blow" was tough to get. 25 starred legendary creatures.  Lately these have been simple.
---
Insert customary note from me here - time to remove PvP completely from adventure mode, cause all it does is promote trolling.
---
I’ve tried the running with the basic marathon perk and without it.  It seems to barely make a difference.   I’d rather run my pistols bonus damage card.
---
Until someone uses their ass
---
Alright, so what about underarmors? At the moment, your only options are to use the default blue suits shining to the distance or to be completely naked. I bought tactical ops suit to not be looking entirely stupid and to my surprise, it doesn't work at all. And I am not talking about functional benefits there, just about the cosmetics. Similar to other people here, now I feel that I have just wasted 700 atoms. ;)
---
I disagree,  it's not like you have to stop moving, just stop sprinting.    It adds to the strategy big time.   I've been seallow3d up by the fire a few times.l, it sucks, but it's my won fault for skirting the edge so long.
---
Yup, that was redick.
---
Anyone who has to say they're an alpha, is no alpha. Anyone who brags about being an alpha online, is a tweeb douche bag. Anyone who believes in the concept of alpha/beta as much as you, is just sad.
---
I found it as playable as any other Bethesda game when it came out. I'm still shocked people expected a non buggy/smooth running game... it's fucking Bethesda. I love their games but well running games is not something they are known for (and in fact are completely known for the opposite). If that kind of thing makes the game unplayable for you, why are you even playing their games?  
---
(I know some one will say I'm excusing them. But for me it's more that that the buggyness of their games doesn't get in the way of me enjoying them... and I can understand for some people it does. But for those people I don't understand why they'd expect a game from Bethesda to be any different and if it bugs them that much, they shouldn't buy Bethesda games or at least wait a few months for things to get smoothed out).
---
Ah yes okay I'll do that in probably the next hour or so I'm cooking breakfast rn
---
Well what’s the solution? We so t have smoke screens or anything for decent cover, the wall kits have to be accessed from the pip boy
---
I suck at pvp and being rekt in 1 vs 4 is not gonna be good for my mental health, thanks for the reply ;).
---
Dude, You're seriously childish.. All you've been doing is crying, having a stroke and using toxic language..
---
Youre complaining when NW is beta and they can ads or change stuff.. 
---
Calm down and go exercise or something.
---
Youre trolling yourself cause you keep replying and thinking im trolling when im not but youre a sensitive kid worse than a woman on her period. 
---
Thats why i recommended fornite
---
Do double barrels go to 50? Some weapons stop at 45
---
Thank you all. Really appreciate it.
---
Same here as well.  Played 5 or 6 matches and really wanted to like it.  I just cant get into shooting other players over and over any more. I think my Call of Duty days really burnt me out on any kind of shooting other players.
---
 I really wish they would have made it a completely separate entity from the regular game. Not a fan of hiding game elements like base items and clothing items behind a mode I don't want to play.
---
 As sucky as it is I may have to AFK level up my nuclear Winter levels just for the rewards.
---
I just want offline mode so the combat doesn't feel like complete garbage, I prefer my enemies to die when I shoot it not wait half a second for them to notice they died. That's all there is to it.
---
I hated the game at launch due to shit bugs. I've just been waiting for everyone to say now is the time to jump in....
---
 That's taking it to the next level!  Honestly one of the great things about this game is the community of players. Of course there's that other community of super pissed people who spit venom, but mostly I've found few of those during my time actually playing.
---
It really helps to carry a melee weapon and use it on the easier enemies. Any old thing will do.
---
I started playing it last night for the free week.  I had no expectations and already was well aware it’s not a Fallout game in the traditional sense
---
Pleasantly surprised.  I met a fella this morning who invited me to team up, then built a house at my camp, crafted me a hunting rifle, dropped a bunch of meds and told me that he created a new character because he knew a bunch of people were just starting since it was free and he wanted to help them out.  
---
So... yeah... I’m not blind to problems and this wasn’t what I really wanted from a Fallout game, but so far I like it for what it is.  I’ll be interested to keep playing and dig deeper.
---
..just reading the fine print if you must know.
---
Actually I kept losing until I went solo and then won two back to back
---
To be fair, most players at launch didn't  like it either. I played through it like a single player rpg and enjoyed myself but got bored when I finished the story and it became repetitive.
---
Not sure how it is now, but at that point all there was to do was to farm nukes for legendaries.
---
I would advise you not to bother with PvP in the larger game, its badly balanced and benefits far too much from gear and builds rather than actual player skills.  Getting better weapons and armor in the end game can take a while - you just go around clearing certain spots where legendary enemies spawn and can turn in unwanted stuff to get scrip.  Scrip allows you to buy more legendary gear from the Purveyor (special vendor) though its just another roll and quite random.
---
There's plenty to do in the endgame but it will start feeling more of a grind rather than discovering new things the further you progress.
---
This!  I would definitely do that
---
I'm not a reviewer or streamer, just your average twat, and I hated the game without reading or watching a single thing. All due to bugs. 
---
I'm not saying I won't jump back in, but I was pretty pissed.
---
Was being the key word, it's come a long way and I'm delighted to see what the future brings. 
---
Human NPCs Aladdin interesting dynamic and nuclear winter is amazing. I'm going to be sad once it goes away until luanch.
---
If anything I've learned with Bethesda titles over the years is don't buy on launch date. The games are always too rushed and need several patches in order to be fit to play I remember skyrim with the backward flying dragons lol I've been playing it online with 3 other friends love it excited to play nuclear winter 😍
---
Honestly, Bethesda has gained a lot of haters over the years (from people who are still bitter about the changes they did to Fallout and just from people who hate their games and cannot comprehend why there are people who love their games). And if you like Bethesda games and talk about them, you encounter them a lot. So for some of us it was very obvious that while there were valid complaints, there were a lot of people who were fanning the flames cause they were overjoyed to "finally" (in their eyes) see Bethesda get hate on them.
---
I'd be really happy if they add earnable weapons like this in adventure mode. Just make the challenges pretty tough, but doable.
---
That being said, he was incredibly hat in hand, which is unusual for God Howard.
---
yeah - similar event with me about 2 weeks ago. my shop is right next to monongah and a level 2 comes up and starts talking and asking noob questions. I didn't buy the shtick at all because no way a true noob is going to be running around in monongah at level 2 with nothing but a party hat. he asked what was that over there and asked me to follow him. anyway I followed him just to confirm my suspicions (junk was stashed and I am at 25k cap or near it always now so validation of my very strong suspicion was worth 50 caps to me. ) and sure enough two stealthed peeps shot me down.
---
Little bit of both. I never used melee in the other titles either, so it was fun to change it up. Ended up sticking with it and now I'm kinda half and half melee / guns.
---
Just uncheck where it says fill. It's a really bad idea though.
---
I bought it at release, struggled with it a bit (I find it harder than usual to pick the right order to do things in). I just picked it up again. I’m loving it. It’s by far the best map ever. Also, everyone is so nice. I’m level 20 and run around in some dirty underpants and a party hat. One high level player (whose camp I was using) gave me a massive pile of stimpaks and weapons) then another high level player gave me a full set of Power Armor parts.
---
It's normal and some days are far worse than others.
---
Edit: just read properly. No, it's a group mode.
---
I play in first person and always holster or put away my melee weapon as it's really annoying having that thing waving about in my vision all the time, but I like to look around and explore.
---
But I think the great majority of players are in kill mode 100% of the time and never bother holstering as killing everything all the time at all costs, requires the weapon to be available with no second delay getting the weapon out and ready. So everything in game is done at the ready for the next kill (Fortnite).
---
Meh I'll pass - I'd do it for a QE DB, not that TS10 POS!
---
"Sucked" doesn't really come close to describe what an absolute dumpsterfire of a game this is.
---
Lol? This post is two months old.
---
Ah - step ahead of you there - this is why I keep a 12 year old kid in the house.
---
It's been bad the last three days...the longest I went on PS4 without getting disconnected is about 40 minutes.
---
It's not really elitist, lol. Just a little something to show how long they've played the game
---
Games are always better with friends, I’m glad you enjoyed it.
---
And the floor during it....it looks like a sorority house with synced menzies and not a sanitary napkin to be found.
---
Yes, I saw that one, but since I have the Zealot's Explosive LMG,  with Faster reload, the extra damage it gets may skew the results in favor of the LMG, but it still eats much more expensive ammo.
---
You know I never thought of that. My stepdaughter loves battle Royal type games, I should just let her play when I'm not playing. Thanks for the tip!
---
I saw 10+ players in Flatwoods at once today...
---
Haven't seen that many since the beta.
---
With two PVP world modes now available I do wonder what the reason is for leaving PVP in Adventure.
---
I remember back when I was just a wee level 5 running around the cranberry bog like a headless chicken.  A random level 100 came out of nowhere and dropped me 50 purified water then about an hour later a level 300 gives me 30 super stimpacks. Ever since then I have always tried to have an overwhelming amount of water purifiers in my camp for the specific purpose of dropping it off to low level players.
---
Sadly not technically trolling or an exploit.. you were in a pvp area :(
---
Doing God’s work
---
Come on, there's no need for that. And besides, THERE'S NO FINE PRINT, OKAY? What's more, it seems like you have an ad blocker installed in your scope, please don't do that. Think of all the fireflies that had to be captured just to make these ads so shiny!
---
Thanks so much for the help I really appreciate it
---
Are you on PC? I can't stand to edit a character's face unless I turn up the texture quality to Ultra for that session. You might also be having trouble with good lighting for making changes; there's a facelight that pops up when you go to change your appearance, but it might be worth the trouble finding a good (and safe!) spot to really dig in under good lighting. 
---
Other than that, I'm not sure what else. Remember that you can set the texture for each part of your characters' face - so like for the cheeks, forehead, or neck it'll say something like "ruddy" or "creased", and the 1-5 variants for different types of mouths, noses, and eyes match up with that too for age. So think about consistency - a lady with old wrinkly eyes but smooth, toned cheeks is gonna look funny. And don't forget the 1-100% faders to determine the intensity of different facial textures - for skin types like I just mentioned they seem fine at 100%, but almost all of the stuff in the makeup/blemishes categories is meant to be turned *way* down - subtlety goes a long way.
---
If you're having trouble with the actual shape of the face and where to put everything, that's trickier to give tips on. The biggest thing I can emphasize is, again, subtlety. I've seen a lot of female vault dwellers that are just a *little* too skinny, with eyes just a *little* bit too big; if you want something about your character's appearance to be pronounced, but it looks a bit cartoonish when you take a second look, just try toning it down.
---
They try so hard but it just ends up being suspicious.  Usually the behavior is so odd that it can't be anything more than a trap! 😐
---
76 Taught me that online reviewers are unreliable and will blow some bugs at launch into a whole storm of exaggerated and flat out lies. 76 is one of my Favorite  games at this point.
---
That's very cool of you thank you. Unfortunately I'm on Xbox.
---
The game is amazing and will get better. It's also had a year's worth of updates to smooth out stuff, which is always good!
---
Don't even try here man. There's no one here left to have rational discussions with about the game.
---
I agree but I would loved to have seen their faces when they realized to late that I killed him and ran! I only got 6 caps but it was more of an honor thing lol but I still hate trolls
---
I prefer to munch on the corpses of my enemies.
---
xD
---
I wouldn’t be so sure that their entire player base is having problems. I’ve been searching reddit for people posting similar issues. I’ve only come across 5-6 posts. I don’t think it’s affecting all of us. Just some of us.
---
If you're on xbox I'd be more than happy to have you play with me and my 2 friends.
---
I enjoy killing them and taking their supplies. The wasteland is a tough place mwahahahahah
---
As of right now i cant even access the game freezes every time i try to log in
---
There's various rare weapons and outfits as well as legendary effects on armor and outfits that you can try to get, certain effects such as twoshot and explosive are better than others and wanted more than others.  Also getting plans and building up your camp are some minor endgame activities if you want to go through the trouble
---
SHAUN?
---
Technically speaking yes however the workshop was not being contested and I didn't own it so this could have happened anywhere.
---
Dear customer, there is no need to be in kill mode while at my shop. My rocket turrets will take care of all the critters and mobs that love to interfere with your shopping spree. Rest assured.
---
You can slap yourself on the back and tell yourself what a good job you did!
---
Use the 'let's nuke' emote if you have it
---
IIRC, the "slap damage" is zero now. So if you got pacifist mode on, there is now way someone can troll you into an unwanted fight...
---
Just to throw in a second point of view, me and my friends have all built our camps around a train station. 
---
There is a minimum distance you have to build from each, but this distance is not far if you find a couple perfect spots for it! 
---
We spend a hell of a lot of time at ours camps, running back and forth to defend each other’s, and monitor our shops. 
---
Camps are a massive part of this game if you want them to be, although I do agree that having fast travel points spread across the map is a good idea for preserving caps!
---
read top of reddit
---
It's funny you should say that about automatics, one of the first things I found was fully automatic 10 mm pistol. I had about 100 shots and they were gone after one group of feral ghouls. I've been tapping the trigger since then.
---
 TL;DR but i hope you’re having fun on your vacation :)
---
I applaud your efforts but feel it is going to fall on deaf ears. I think people are just jumping in to see what it is all about. Most of the big video streamers I watched on Youtube had no idea what they were doing and really didnt give a crap about their teams. For someone like me who is usually a solo player, it will be very frustrating to be matched with completely different players everytime. So much so that I am probably just going to stay away. Being a sniper and tactically trained in real life, I just cant die in game because others arent going to work together....
---
I gave it an hour or so and I couldn’t get into it. Felt like a poor runoff of the older fallouts. Glad there was a free trial &amp; I didn’t spend the money.
---
I want that medieval welding helmet.
---
most youtube talking heads are still doing their best to crap on the game..
---
there are a few who have embraced it tho.. notably juice and mantis...
---
just light the left arrow key tf up every dialogue sequence
---
They actually need to fix PvP in Survival then remove it from Adventure.  Survival should be based on the early game PvP model with no Pacifist option...  right now its just a spawn campfest for the most part.  Survival as a hardcore mode requiring new characters, with resources in the open world being much more scarce, and open friendly fire mechanics (harsher version of the slap system) would appeal to a much larger audience.
---
NW is the true PvP mode!
---
There are materials that you see lots of but you don't use much, mainly being ceramic (ashtrays, plates etc), glass (mostly emtpy bottles), fibreglass (phones), rubber (toilet plungers) and more. They are useful to bulk (which uses plastic so hoard plastic!) And tee hen sell to vendors. Also wood ... When I started playing I was mostly around flatwoods and I scrapped and saved everything that has wood but then I stumbled on the logs just south in the dry reiver bed and you can find loads there when you need it so now I save weight and leave wood alone (brooms, mops, picture frames etc).
---
Things you should save and never sell .... Lead, plastic,  steel (although common you do use a lot), ballistic fibre (look out for military mo bags and military grade duct tape. This is used for armour repairs at higher levels so hoard it now), plastic (used for bulking and shotgun ammo, energy weapons crafting mostly), screws (never have enough screws for weapon crafting and repairs, armour repairs),  ultracite (I am s watching around now at level 39 for a bit of ultracite to mod some underarmor and I wish I had known I would need that earlier).
---
Google a good fo76 .arterial resource guide and it will tell you what items contain what base materials. Some will seem weird and make no sense so common sense out the window just print out and keep a guide near you.
---
Quick wheel. Also don't be russian, you don't need to push all the time.
---
SuperMutants and Gutsy's are both well armored, so the AA getting higher damage is to be expected. I did a little testing this morning with a Furious Assault rifle, and also found it was not getting any increased damage from the Furious effect, not sure what's going on there, but I will try some other weapons when I can.
---
would be a lot easier for them to monetize skins for that. but I would love to see a lunch box with the moth man on it or wendigo on it
---
Welp, that explains it. Thanks.
---
Unfortunately, there is no cross play.
---
When they told you it was bad they weren't lying, but that was almost a year ago, luckily Bethesda has spent their time wisely since then making this game what it should have been at launch :)
---
Good doggy. ;)
---
Proof?
---
But there will be no cross play???
---
If you're on PS4, you probably ran into Clown Daddy (that's his YouTube, not his in game name, so no rule breaking).
---
He has a character that takes advantage of the fact that most people don't think twice about killing a level 2, and shames them for it when his buddies come out of the bushes, murder them, and break their camp.
---
I stopped playing fortnight save the world because they spent far too much of their development time doing the battle Royal part.
---
I thought save the world was alot of fun. 
---
 I too fear they will start adding more resources and time into the br mode.  Let's just hope they are completely separate teams and don't steal any adventure/survival mode developers.
---
when i was new, i blocked those annoying carebears who tried to destroy my exploration experience and learning phase by "helping" me... be nice in real life for a change. in a video game, you guys are an annoying, spoilering pest and I'm still not perfectly sure why youre doing this...
---
Yes, there are more things to do now.
---
Sadly no there isn’t cross platform “yet”
---
Good doggy is only one rank. And since you got the animated one, the other disappeared.
---
idk how to prove it to you
---
If it’s the animated card it simply replaceed the other card so yes you would still only have one
---
Nuka crypt. Com
---
Two high level players today gave me a missile launcher and other weapons, a vast quantity of stimpaks, and a full set of power armor parts. It actually cheered me up in real life.
---
The quick wheel is messy, hopefully they make some adjustments
---
I wish I could help you but I really don't pay much attention to the cards in the pack.. I open them just for the stale gum :)
---
Workshops and team exploits still enables PvP.  And most that contest workshops don't want to take the workshop, they just exploit it to get into PvP.  So nope - just remove it entirely.  Even with Pacifist you'll get people just coming up to you punching you and being annoying as heck cause they hope you'll turn Pacifist off and engage them.  PvP enables trolling period.
---
Maybe this was a pre-patch camp and they haven't updated the build?
---
But there will be????
---
Look it up on google is the easy way. People post the code for each silo every week so you don’t need to collect all the code pieces
---
I've turned it on and off multiple times over the past few days and no change. Do they have a specific requirement to play the trial or something?
---
Cool. Dumb question - are these guaranteed spawn or potential? Presume it's randomised.
---
^This
---
I think you get them when you buy the game.
---
I think it might have something to do with lighting, now you mention it.
---
In strong sunlight my female character looked fine, but when I went into the church in Flatwoods she just suddenly looked desperately ill - all gaunt and shadowed!
---
 You can go [here](https://nukacrypt.com) or do it the legit way, where the three possible words are in the enclave bunker  in the war room idr exactly how to decipher them though i believe the site i linked says how
---
Something is screwy on PS4 right now.  People are having major issues, however PC and Xbox seem to be running great.  Give them a little time to smooth things out.
---
dude, seriously....   i have watched tons of video's from juicehead about fallout 76 and i learned a lot of stuff.  it's unfair that you include him among the haters.
---
Ohh yeah I used it never before but I tryed it in NW and it was Awesome!
---
NO!!!!
---
Pics, of course! Lol 🤷‍♂️
---
Good Doggy is only a single tier perk, therefore it cannot be upgraded.
---
You won't be able to have duplicates in your stack of perks, let me explain; you can get multiple copies of a card, as long as it is an upgradeable one. Once you get to a point that you cannot upgrade anything, any duplicates you get will not appear as they are completely pointless.
---
Let's take a random 3 tier card as an example. Travelling Pharmacy, it reduces the carry weight of chems and stims. You could receive 6 copies of that before any further copies you obtain disappear.
---
3 to make a lvl 3 Travelling Phramacy
---
2 more to make a level 2 Travelling Pharmacy
---
1 More that will be a lvl 1
---
Any further copies of Travelling Pharmacy that you get will not appear among your cards.
---
This is a mechanic that is more useful a further 100 levels away. You may have an armour piece that reduces carry weight of chems, at which point lvl 3 Travelling Pharmacy gains a level of redundancy. A lvl 2 may be better, but you can't break down a lvl 3, this is why you get duplicates of multi-tier cards, but not single tier cards.
---
I hope my long-winded explanation helps
---
TL;DR You won't receive duplicates of cards (even if they come in packs) unless there is an available upgrade.
---
happened to me on PS4
---
Is the first time so i want to do it step by step. But as far as i know the code word is revealed slowly during the whole week. And i want to do the silo run today.
---
I've already collected the 8 code pieces. Now i need only the code word to decrypt them
---
The CAMP mechanics can be confusing at first, but they’re simple once you learn them. 
---
1. Your CAMP location and build is permanent, unless you choose to move it. You do not ever have to lose your CAMP. 
---
2. When you log off, so does your CAMP. When you log back in, it places back down exactly as it was when you left. 
---
3. Sometimes when you log in, someone else is already in your spot. You will receive a notification to “Find a new world” or stay on that one and potentially move your CAMP for free. 
---
4. If you stay on that world, but don’t move your CAMP, it will be right where you left it the next time you log on. One might do this if they’re joining a friend and don’t want to switch worlds again. 
---
5. If you choose to move your CAMP, your structures pack up and live in the “Stored” tab in the build menu. From there you can try to place them back down in full (difficult with large structures) or scrap them into their individual pieces—which will then be available under that same “Stored” tab for you to use without wasting new materials. You can also scrap those pieces into junk components if you don’t need them. 
---
When it comes to CAMPs, you never really lose anything. It sounds like in this scenario you’ll need to rebuild because you chose to move, but your structures and items are all still there in the build menu. Just place down your CAMP box and build again—but probably clear the area first. 
---
I’ve heard about a bug that removes your vending machine items if you choose “Find another world”. I can’t speak to the accuracy of that. I’ve chosen that option many times since vending came out and have never had a problem—but that doesn’t mean it’s wrong. If you have vending machines you don’t want to risk resetting, probably best to choose to stay on the world, then go back to the main menu and relog. If you’re on the free trial, you probably don’t really need to worry about that yet. 
---
As for losing your junk...Scrap and stash, scrap and stash, scrap and stash. Every single chance you get. Never carry junk on you. When you craft or build it will pull directly from your stash, so keep it all safe. Get in the habit of doing it before you log out. You never know when you’ll die—especially early on. It’s not worth the risk of losing it to keep it on you. 
---
It’ll become second nature after you’ve played for a bit and the mechanics start to make more sense. They can be frustrating at first though.
---
Maybe for Xbox and PC, I highly doubt PS4 and PC will be.
---
If u didn’t hear apparently Xbox and PlayStation companies are going to be working together and if there together I’m sure pc will tag along so I’m sure it’s going to be cross play also and the new call of duty is going to be cross platform
---
I have Zidongshophobia. Keeping my gun drawn is the only way I can use your machines.
---
idk how imgur works and i don’t wanna make a whole ass post about her
---
First thing I tried lol
---
Still waiting to get that perk...
---
I think being able to stack foundations from the use of campfires had been patched. I believe you can still grow crops from them. I haven’t tried.
---
Your Progress within the free trail is saved and you can continue when you bought it.
---
Ok, that makes a lot more sense. Thank you so much!
---
as a rough estimate, I'd say it's improved by 43%. If you're into BR mode, make it 58%.
---
+/- 2% depending on your patience level for the day.
---
Just because the game has been through a year of development and is better than it was doesn't mean that all the criticism that the game received at launch wasn't justified and untrue. Hopefully once the new expansion hits people will try out the game again and have a better opinion of it.
---
Got the iron stomache perk? Or just sitting thru the diseases?
---
found a level 6 holotape near the theatre stage (behind curtain)
---
I searched before, the three panels said "in progress".
---
So: no words
---
Honestly I find the current balancing to be more frustrating than fun, and it’s personally turned me off the game for now. I won’t claim it’s dead though. These days I don’t have much time for online shooters since they require a dedicated timeframe to play even one match, and I rarely can get through a whole match without needing to put it down, so when I do have time to play I’d rather play something that I am guaranteed to enjoy like 76, a different Bethesda title,  Zelda or something.
---
Clickbait? Ugh.
---
No, I don't believe you can save across platforms, unfortunately.
---
It's still not Fallout.
---
A lot of people just decide beforehand that the game sucks and proceed to inform others like its a fact. Seeing a lot of twitch streamers shit on the game after like one battle royale match
---
I don't have jt. Could be a good idea but it's a paid emote though and not sure people would understand the meaning of it.
---
I've never lost a camp in 6 months of playing (but my friend did- the rules are a little confusing). This is not how the game usually works. The first guy that said "click to try another server " is right but I've heard of rare occaisions when you have to reprice your stuff if you do that. Replacing an existing camp for free is risky as the lanscape is so varied - it's tricky for the game to automatically to place foundations. We ply ina group usually and if one of us can't place their camp, we all quit, rejoin and all is reliably good. 
---
Have a littel patience and don't give up on the game - you'll be glad you did. The first couple of weeks are the only real struggle. Before you know it you'll be a demi-god with weapons that make you laugh they're so powerful. Happy to help kill the robots if you need a friend  - my in game name is **wellibootz**
---
Dues v(a)ult!
---
I'm a plague walker so dieases
---
kein ding alter , tausend dank:)
---
it was free not so long ago :P
---
First, the game has received a lot of tender care and love so you're getting a much more polished product than it was released as.
---
Second, most of the people who said that 76 sucked wanted another typical Fallout game and were unwilling or unable to take 76 on its own terms for what it was.
---
You could just ask. Even if they don’t have a mic they can still hear you as long as your not on a party chat with your friends.
---
Dont tell PETA, they'll try to take your kills.
---
I got downvoted to shit once for liking the idea. I feel vindicated, glad people are enjoying it!
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_76
---
You can fix the format even from a phone.
---
How is go here and play a recording while you stand in an empty room and nothing happens not predictable after the 5th time it happens?
---
You get 100xp per match. By afking them and or crashing the server you're on you absolutely can level up extremely fast.
---
Depends on how you play.   
---
My suggestion is do not try to rush the game to get to the "end" and in the process, ignore much of the storyline (and the backstory), side quests, and exploration. 
---
 Just like other iterations of FO, there's a lot to see and discover - visual gags, homages to movies, books, and other games, etc.  Rush through, and you miss a lot of that stuff.
---
 More stuff to do will be added over time.
---
Levels and gear will come as you explore and discover.  
---
I made L100 over the weekend, and there are still places I haven't been and things I haven't done.  And I'm still enjoying the game.
---
IMHO, rushing through the game is counter-productive.
---
Yessssss please!!!
---
Build a brahmin pen at your camp. Milk, store, rebuild, repeat.
---
I also like the low amount of standard AP, makes the perks you choose matter more.  I've got 3 perks devoted to sprinting, personally.
---
The crates aren't loot boxes or anything, they're just items for your camp in adventure/survival
---
They're random. No idea what the spawn rates are but anecdotally the bridge seems to spawn two epic crates on average, with nine possible locations, so I'd guess it's around 25% for epics.
---
Same on Xbox since the update.
---
Good luck, people have harped on Bethesda for a while now about adding text chat.
---
Well fuck me everybody is gonna be using it anyways
---
Not everybody can understand English sometimes. People are from many different countries. This is why I'm asking for an universal emote or way to share.
---
Lol No worries, then.
---
*Angry Shop Owner Noises*
---
But there was a scorchbeast in the trailer
---
Yea, wtf. This card would be awesome. Instead I keep getting dupes.
---
I share your concerns. Im guessing a majority of them will be gone after this week.
---
I’m just questioning if the HP values being shown are actually real.
---
It wasn’t opinion or speculation I was throwing around, it was in-game testing between two of my accounts (and likewise with the other guy who posted after I reported my results). I literally shot once, recorded HP, shot again, recorded HP, repeat until the target was near death. Heal up, repeat again. 
---
Most commonly accepted number I’ve seen is 5% a hit to 50%. Which mostly fit with what me and the other guy recorded in our testing. 
---
Either they’ve reworked how Furious works, or the displayed numbers are wrong. That’s why I said it needs more controlled testing where we can see (on the player side) how much HP is *actually* being lost. Basically, the same testing I did, but with also recording the pop-up damage numbers, and seeing if they match.
---
I get where you're coming from, but I also have a certain resistance to all of these suggestions that you and others are making because they want NW to be more like all the other BRs. 
---
Low default AP makes it worth choosing perks to improve it.  I've got 3 perks towards Sprinting, personally, and I love that I can Sprint twice as long as anyone else now.
---
This has to be it's open thing, you know?
---
Since the BETA an almost guaranteed way of getting disconnected from server or bluescreen is to claim a workshop. Once you have done that it is only a matter of time.
---
Approaching 1200 hours of gameplay, all workshops claimed multiple times, by myself and team-mates. Staying in a session long enough to get to the second defense is rare enough to be nigh on miraculous. 
---
That said, if you end up in a quiet session you may be ok, but once it get's down to 2-3 people the server shuts down anyway.
---
Yeah the frame rate and frame time is terrible on ps4 but on pc it’s all running "ok" .
---
Are you on PS4? I'll come check out your shop my guy. Hit max caps and had to take mine down
---
It's hard to say as it's the current version, back in the BETA you had to start a new character in the retail release to unlock trophies.
---
Nah, survival mode is the one at risk. Adventure is still the majority.
---
NW is going to fizzle off soon enough, me and some friends enjoyed it the first day, but now it's just a filler mode.
---
Adventure is the core game.
---
I love to see asian creativity in camp building! I'm not particulary creative myself and need alot of inspiration. Keep it up!
---
I appreciate you explaining. It is very kind. I understand a little better :) But I  don't think it's for me, 
---
 - Full screen turns my monitors blank &amp; randomly freezes the computer. (I have a 1080Ti &amp; Ryzen7 2600x) No other game does that 
---
- In windowed mode I have tabs half off screen. 
---
- I have nothing of my camp except the stash box &amp; bit of floor. 
---
- And it constantly glitches &amp; crashes. Or I get killed while trying to work out the not so intuitive controls.  Ive logged back in about 25-30 times today I have been at this for hours.
---
This. I was vocally against it. "Hur Durrrr you should resources to fix bugs lol" downloaded the update launched into NW. Had a blast and said "wtf. This is fun AND good. Dammit, well played" it's fresh.
---
Juicehead?? Can confirm he doesnt bash the game at all, in fact hes the opposite.
---
 Hes one of my go to fallout 76 youtube content creators. I say one of, pretty much my only go to... Not sure where you got that from dude.
---
Yeah. I don't get why they do that.
---
This Happens sometimes.
---
You can now milk brahmin.
---
Same on PS4 Pro, game even drops frames just changing weapons.
---
Special points don't effect your AP in NW. Special points have no bearing at all outside of equipping perks. Also even with marathoner the difference is negligible.
---
Counter point: all of the plans that all the high level players already knew suddenly became sellable.
---
They can't realistically do that without either completely overhauling the storyline for new players/characters or making a post-Scorched instance of the map that can't be accessed unless you've killed the queen. Neither are going to happen. Lorewise the Scorch Beasts will go extinct without the queen and since they're the main vector for spreading the plague and controlling those infected with it, that'll die out as well. Gamewise they'll always be in the game, and you'll always be able to trigger the fight with the Scorch Beast Queen.
---
The game was made by Bethesda, a beloved studio for a lot of people, it was advertised as AAA title and cost $60. Fallout 76's quality on launch was not worthy to have Bethesda's or Fallouts name attached to it with the product that people had received.
---
Its been almost a year since release and Fallout 76 is closer now to being the game it should have been at launch. Hopefully reviewers give this game another chance when the new expansion hits and enjoy it.
---
Some things definitely used to be worse, alas, now other things are worse. Back in the BETA, if you opened your pipboy or your map then they would immediately open, now it's 5-10 seconds of being frozen before they open. Invisible enemies were a rarity in the BETA and your camp would load within 10-15 seconds, not a minute or 2. Also, the game used to be able to render as fast as you could run, now it barely renders as fast as you sneak.
---
What?  Bot is ridiculous.
---
&gt; Random reward for completing Personal Matters and Earth Mover, Event: Lode Baring, Event: Breach and Clear, Event: A Mine of Her Own, Event: Battle Bot.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Low chance of being rewarded for completing Daily: Mistaken Identity, Horde events, Hunter/Hunted PVP, and all Powering Up Quests.
---
What platform are you on PC, PS4?
---
Im on pc
---
just played for like 15 minutes yesterday.   made it to level 1lol.
---
didn't understand something. i tought that you always started fresh in each new game? so if you are level 10 or 1 you have the same chances for the loot etc, the same skills more or less etc.  but how is it possible that some dudes from another team were already all in power armor after being on the map for like 2 minutes?
---
It's normally every Thursday but it's occasionally delayed until Friday
---
This... I still haven't reached level 10 from Beta!
---
End game is essentially (for me at least) farming a few spots for legendaries, cleaning out the vendor and getting my daily script. Nothing super grindy like GTAO.
---
I grunted while reading this so there may be some truth to this statement
---
on PS4 you can just start a party and invite the players you want to chat with.
---
Players can even be on other games.

Give it a week. People lose their collective shit when something is labeled as free.
---
I'm all for giving games a second chance, hell I'm playing No Man's Sky at the moment, but the way this community is now acting on the criticism during launch is bonkers to me.
---
If I was to believe some of the comments in this post, the game has been great since day one, all criticism was unfair because people "just wanted to complain about something", the people that asked for refunds were "disgusting" and the Fallout community disliked the game because they are "antisocial" and want to be "lonely AF".
---
How the hell can I believe these same people that now claim the game is good now?
---
Can you explain this comment a little more? I feel like I'm missing something. What's the conspiracy theory?
---
I am on pc so that's not the guy and he is a regular poster here in reddit so I cant name him. also I didn't attack the level 2 at all I owned the power plant and he was just getting me to follow him into the contest zone so his friends could contest and engage.I knew it would happen just didn't care. 50 caps is nothing to me and it didn't even cover the cost of their fast travel split three ways. also no salt because I always expect to lose a shop and never over invest. 100% profit all the time everytime.
---
Good counter point. But now we all have to move our shops to the forest. That’s not so bad I guess.
---
Zzzzzzzzzz
---
I agree but it is deceptive and a bit...sketchy is the word?
---
you dont have to be competitive.. all you have to do is show up and eventually youll level all the way up even if you lose every match you join
---
I appreciate the kind response as I said to the other chap
---
I played for 8 hours yesterday I was determined to get the most out of the trial. Today I have been at it since 0700hrs it is now 13.30hrs
---
But I don't think it's for me,
---
- Full screen turns my monitors blank &amp; randomly freezes the computer. (I have a 1080Ti &amp; Ryzen7 2600x) No other game does that
---
- In windowed mode I have tabs half off screen. https://postimg.cc/kBCXWdDx
---
- I have nothing of my camp except the stash box &amp; bit of floor.
---
- And it constantly glitches &amp; crashes. Or I get killed while trying to work out the not so intuitive controls. Ive logged back in about 25-30 times today I have been at this for hours.
---
I think this is the best Moment to Start with 76.
---
With the NPC's comming Back in Fall and the New BR Mode, There is more than enough to do and explore.
---
I got a 6-point Agility perk that increased run speed by 20% with a Melee weapon equipped.  Run for your Knife, or something like that
---
I agree. I LOVED the idea. And did defend the gameplay and was like... it's not as bad as everyone says. My hate didnt come from that. I wouldn't even call it hate, but anger. My anger came from the slap in the face and the unplayable tendencies. I knew once they got the kinks together itd be a great game. What grinds my gears, is when the people doing the free trial, "ohh this game is great idk what you're talking about"... they didnt give you a free trial 5 months ago? They did that for a reason.
---
Dude, it was literally broken graphically and so unstable, hugely compared to 3 or 4!
---
agreed and the current meta has all of the advantages vs regular low and mid level players trying to defend.
---
I'm just glad they disabled area chat in there.  It would be pure madness.
---
Ah, yeah.  That's actually how I met him in game.  I'll admit I was super salty at first, but when I respawned I realized it was my fault for trying to get an easy kill on a low level.  Then he gave me a clown costume and told me to follow him around.  Easily some of the most fun I've had in this game before NW came out.
---
Harassing people in workshops is silly I agree, but they're the only real pvp areas left in adventure mode (aside from a few griefer techniques)
---
The hero we deserve. Thank you!
---
I wouldn't call it unfinished. They said from the start that it was going to be an evolving game, and it launched as an open world that was capable of being updated and had a lot of lore, a main quest, and a few side quests. There were some pretty big bugs, but nothing that was "literally game breaking" to the degree of certain other online titles, or even previous fallout games. You could log on and play the story since day 1, which I'd say is an accomplishment for the studios first online game. 
---
I get wanting something to be more polished, but without releasing and getting feedback from the community the alternative is tens of thousands of man hours and a release date that's years out, vs releasing the game and crowd sourcing issues from millions of users and fixing them in the first few weeks/months. Maybe it's because the fanbase wasn't accustomed to online games, but almost always if you don't want to deal with major bugs it's best to wait a few months before picking up a game.
---
I don't think anyone has gotten there yet, to be honest
---
Because it really hasn't. Like a single player can at will crash the NW server by dropping a max blueprint build a couple times in short succession. Noticed this accidentally after misplacing my build and quickly rebuilding it in the right spot and then a moment later entire server lags out and crashes.
---
After finding that out I tested it a couple more times and it is a joke easy to crash them with the camp.
---
They should give more xp for kills tbh. Not enough incentive to engage group it you don't have to, the way the xp is set up now, it's worth it to hide and stay alive as long as possible
---
i just get bored from the lack of quests with meaning. i quit out of boredom at level 60 but got my money worth for sure.
---
Free demo week. I'm happy about it, means we can start replacing all the banned cheaters, and the "raiders" that ragequit when they couldn't slap kill, or grief anymore.
---
I have... [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bzhj89/nuclear\_winter\_perk\_compilation/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bzhj89/nuclear_winter_perk_compilation/)
---
Yes but most of my really good stuff is sold. I have a couple of blue and a bunch of brown asylum uniforms I’ve been farming to sell.
---
wow. I'm so impressed with the community sometimes.
---
incredible, creative, well done.
---
what platform?
---
👍
---
You have to craft the helmet separate- at an armor workbench
---
😂
---
This game would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customer.
---
Or they see past the honeymoon phase. The servers still suck and can be crashed at will with a mac sized blueprint camp being placed a couple times.
---
I love him
---
I got that reference. Damn dummy thicc rogues
---
Thanks for the update, I will make the change to the primary post to reflect the update.
---
Yeah, he really showed his colors there.  I stopped trusting him and watching him when I seen how skewed he makes his videos.
---
I don't like PvP either and I've never played a Battle Royale game before, but I had three sessions on NW last night and had huge fun. I had to tear myself away. Quite often I just want a short session in the wasteland and I can see myself going to NW to give me a Fallout fix when I don't have enough time for a prolonged bout in Adventure.
---
Yea they need to change this. It's pretty much worth it to avoid battles early on and hide. More xp that way
---
I've mostly had good luck with it early, while people are scrambling for guns, and against AI enemies to avoid gunshots that would give away my position.
---
10 minute wait time? Maybe 4 minutes on Ps4 and  I try to spawn away from the popular spots gives you a chance to get some good gear and not engage in PVP right away.
---
I've spent hours playing and gotten to overseer lv 12 but I really don't enjoy competitive games so it just doesn't feel fun to play. I actually find it pretty stressful and am disliking it more the more I play. 
---
I mostly play 76 for exploration and lore so seeing the doors/terminals/holos locked behind overseer lvs of 100+ is really motivation killing.
---
please tell me there isn't a way for a player to crash the server...
---
friken griefers don't deserve to exploit that bug...
---
A free instead of paid BETA would have helped that.
---
Curious if there is a cap to xp for minutes survived. What if last 2 or 3 players just stay in circle and don't kill each for an hour??
---
This could only work if updates weren't planned several months in advance and on a tight release schedule.
---
As a Youtuber allow me to say this..... Not all of us are that stupid. I personally have a couple heavy weapons perks smashed into the same stat as well as a few in other stats. I apologize if they gave out the wrong info, you'd be surprised how often they do that!
---
I e gotten so good at making all of my characters the same my friends can’t tell between them except sometimes I change the hair. So much so I added freckles to one the other day and my friend was like &gt;_&gt; this one has freckles!!!!
---
My theory is young up and comer wanna be alphas wanting to farm salt and scratch the itch in their primitive monkey brain for establishing dominance. its less about the caps and more about figuring out how to break it, piss someone off, and feel good about themselves so they can puff their little chests out and get a laugh. my suspected iner monologue for those guys goes something like this. "look at me I am smart for exploiting this easily figured out loophole and making that guy waste his game time and get angry I am therefore a superior being and he is a loser.ha ha ha I win I win I am not a loser I am a winner"
---
What a great Bodyguard
---
*"Nothing to see here - get away with those cameras!! No pics please!"*
---
Hmm good point!
---
DRUGS
---
Do not be like that either.  There was A LOT of crap wrong.  Bethesda did a disservice to the game releasing it like that.
---
They have been doing a bang up job fixing it up tho.  Why?  Not because they care about you.  The care about damaging their Fallout cash cow line.  If this was a new brand, like say Anthem, why double down and try to fix a non brand?
---
Let us spawn in with 1 minute of immunity in case we get screwed and have 10 guys that are around the exact same spot.  I've gotten killed almost immediately due to this.  right before spawn, I know im in shit when the player positions are shown, so a minute would give me time to get out of the area until i get some gear. it feels like about 20 seconds at the moment.
---
Their job is to make money off people playing their video games.  If they don't try to make any changes to what they produce they run the risk of going out of business and we just get the same game over and over.  I agree with what you say about NW attracting a more aggressive crowd but that's just Bethesdas way of getting new players to buy their game.
---
DRUGS!!!!
---
No addiction effects in NW so pop the drugs like it’s candy.
---
I’m 80 and cars blowing up don’t do Jack to me, so it’s all good and fun :)
---
Too bad this subreddit hates mantis because he wont pretend oxhorn isn't the scumbag he is. Thankfully major commentary YouTube's have finally picked up on it and are calling oxhorn out for his constant lies. TRO has no dog in the fight being that he doesn't game or have anything to do with the gaming community, yet after he looked into everything his video on it tears oxhorn apart for being a scumbag and liar.
---
*ANGRY RAIDER NOISES*
---
Its not a loot box. Just a Box you can place in your camp
---
It’s really just the lighting in some places is not great - you can make a stunning looking character and they will still look weird in bad light. On the same hand I can only make decent looking female character and I can’t make males at all. Their noses are all horrible and just ugh I hate it
---
I like to find locked c.a.m.p.s and marsupial my way in through places they didn't think to secure. If you're couch is next to a window 3 floors up and the doors are locked, I'm gonna leave some raw fertilizer and toilet paper on your bed.
---
It's dickish but doesn't harm anyone and I usually buy some ammo or something while I'm there.
---
That's sweet of you. Thank you :)
---
This. Never liked BR. Can't stop playing The Atom Games.
---
No problem, and if it's not there for some reason, directly across the lake at the dam building, there's one on the outside on top of the building (it's a small bit of story/lore about why they're there). Only problem with that one is that the place is guarded by super mutants. Depending on your level, they can be a bit tough to take out.
---
I don't believe you get anything for rounds. Only for challenges completed and Overseer's rank. Also, games should not just reward for minimal play. To ask what someone is/was rewarded after a minimal amount of experience is equal to asking to be rewarded everytime you take a shit.
---
If you open the social menu and click your name and select leave world to go to the main menu - this normally puts me in a new world
---
The game has changed. We all live in a socialist collective at Cobbleton Farm now. All of us. Even the Scorchbeasts. There are plenty of tatos to plant and harvest. We enjoy our new lives.
---
I never wanted it. Played it, not interested.
---
My huge worry now is how everybody is lapping up yet another BR game. 
---
Its worrying for the long term future of adventure mode imo. If too much focus is starting to be focused on NW at any point in the future il he done with the game.
---
We "film" using the in-game photo-mode cam on PS4 but we live stream the episodes so people on other platforms can watch. Plus i hope to edit the footage into something more "watchable" than just a live stream but like i said above, its one of those bugs we have to work around.
---
LOUD NOISES!!! *think I took too many DRUGS!
---
I want mine to have a dung pile skin so I can drop it with "you have been insulted!" And some fertilizer on other people's camps
---
Just remember Bethesda now believe that it doesn't matter how the game launches but how it'll develope over time. Not to mention they also knew it was gonna launch poorly.
---
Gotta love this community! lmao

---
Just use a max sized blueprint camp place it a few times and boom goes the server. It is just like I tried to tell everyone the servers can barely handle 24 players static camps, 52 players and moving a camp around completely lags out the entire server to the point of crashing.
---
Jesus yes.
---
My hope is that I could continue it on Steam.  I do not want to start over.  :(
---
But doesn't more Nates mean more Shauns? You'd end up finding Shaun only to discover it was some other Nate's kid and not yours.
---
Your experience was different than mine. First of all, 4 actually ran better at start than any of their previous games (yes, it still was buggy but Skyrim apparently was an unplayable mess on PS3 until some time later). And New Vegas, as much as I love the game (it's my favorite game of all time) I'd say was equal to worse (yes, different developer but same engine). 76 had some real annoyances but it was perfectly playable.
---
FUCKING KILL
---
I've recently been seeing some lousy textures on PS4, but no FPS issues that I've noticed.
---
Just yess yes yes
---
As a level 26 in the game mode. I’ll tell you a few things.
---
What guns are you using? The best Guns in the game right now from me personally, are the combat shotgun/pump action and the Gatling. You have the two of those and you’ll do great things.
---
Aiming in third person is sometimes easier, you have to switch back and forth a lot. The Gatling is the most aids gun in first person for me and can de a damn thing, so that gun in third person just shreds. And it can be used as both a shotgun and sniper which is crazy.
---
Power armor is decent. I usually don’t pick it up unless I have my heavy build on which I’m using right now, but mostly every other build should probably stay away as it clunks so loud you can hear it from like 4 houses over. 
---
Overall, try using different weapons, switching camera types, and blend in which might mean skip the power armor.
---
I think it’s hillarious myself.  “What’s going on in there” (grunt slap punch) “Oh nothing dear”
---
Witch Platform are you know?
---
I picked up the game last month, as I see it on sale on Amazon. Absolutely love it! I remember hearing all the hate for the game, but it's a lot of fun. I've not really done any PvP (killed one wanted player, but that's it). I just really enjoy exploring the world and doing events.
---
Yup...it’s pretty annoying. :(
---
Sounds just right for new players then haha

Well, you have to compare it to play time. You have to travel to the vault, wait to queue up, then play through the round as far as you can get. OP said they took down at least one player. You should earn something for that... Say it takes 25 minutes to complete as far as you can get in a round between travel, queue and fight. That's 25 minutes you could get a lot of loot and XP from. 
---
I haven't had the time to play the new mode yet, so I don't know what the reward structure looks like. People talk about learning plans and stuff, I was curious how fast that went.
---
there's a overseer lv101 holotape at the exit from the vault, think it will be some time before i can use it, overseer lv5 here, lol
---
That sound like a very specific bug, I don't even know what you mean with "max blueprint build". In about 15 V51 games I've not had a single crash or disconnect
---
The videos I'm talking about are about how bad a game FO76 is, how Bethesda is the 7 circle of hell, Todd is lying even when he is not tlaking and we as players are responsible for the downfall of gaming culture.
---
They are just serving an audience who want to fortify their opinion they got from 3rd party sources and are producing traffic on their channels.
---
But those are only the major updates; I was thinking more of the smaller changes.
---
Max out luck
---
I would actually like the ability to defend while still being able to perform my normal pve functions in X01 power armor. my biggest issue is the fact I would have to ditch the power armor and embrace stealth which is annoying and gimmicky to me in pve. and truth be told I spend 99% of my time in solo pve enviroments so breaking my build just isnt worth it for me. so I am left with either intentionally trying to defend and being a loot pinata or avoidance of the area and not defending shops at all. I am opposed to rewarding them for their antics so therefore I just avoid it for the most part. if a pvper does manage to get me I don't get too upset because I know he got really lucky or spent a hell of a long time watching and waiting.
---
Then why are you here?
---
It’s very possible that they spawned in a location that has a Power Armor spawn. There are plenty around the map and you can easily pick them every time you “drop” to get lucky and see if one spawns.
---
There is virtually no end game outside of the grind for additional levels (for duplicate perks and the occasional fine tuning of special allocation) and legendary equipment for scrip to acquire more legendary items...for scrip...to acquire more legendary items...for scrip. 
---
As far as end game content, there isnt any. You can do Encrypted well before end game. You can do Scorched Earth well before end game. You can do Project Paradise well before the level 50 advised. Until raids are added, and only if they are implemented correctly with some more advanced mechanics than we currently have in any of the other meaningful encounters, there is really no end game content to speak of.
---
honestly, the game did suck when it first came out.  I did not at all expect a typical Fallout game.  But I at least expected a more polished and finished game upon release.  Aside from the ridiculous amounts of bugs and crashes, the gameplay was also pretty bland and boring even from an exploration side of things.
---
I played for about two weeks when it first came out then quit.  But then came back to the game about a couple weeks ago.  I will say, I have enjoyed it but still don't think it's great.  There were definitely major improvements.  But the game still has a long ways to go.  Still plenty of bugs but at least crashes have been very few for me compared to before.  So the game is at least playable.  Some improvements to exploration and building parts of the game have helped made those aspects of the game a little better.  But I still think it's a bit bland in parts and building still has too many frustrating bugs and mechanics in place to allow people be completely creative.
---
In the end, I am very glad Beth is sticking to this game to improve it because I've always seen the potential and I always have loved the Fallout franchise.  I think about 3-6 months from now and we might finally see a bit more of the game that should have been released from the beginning.
---
NW and PvE are tied together, so im not worried about work stopping on PvE.
---
As for NW...its reignited my interest in the game after pretty much quitting a few weeks ago. (played Metro Exodus...meh).
---
Its exciting and you get PvE experience for playing.  I suk at it too, but after a while its VERY gratifying to get better, and level up to get new NW cards that are pretty awesome.  I suggest you give it one try :)
---
I'm in the mire and have only had 1 customer at my vendor this week. Though it's pretty fun running the low level events with the noobs. Let them tag the mobs then wreck everything that moves. 
---
If only gun fu was working..
---
Theres no easy respec, once you hit lvl 50 you can move a point around every time you level up after that
---
After Level 50 you can Switch your skill points as much as you want so it is no big deal.
---
Hehe. Not at these prices.
---
Power Armor, Chems and the almighty glitch king.
---
Seriously though, I was capping everyone not in power armor one shot to the dome yesterday.
---
I have and the core gameplay is just BR. And i absolutely hate BR. Like pretty much more then any other "genre" of game.
---
I share his worries.
---
You're put in a team, but that doesn't mean you have to play with them. If you want to go solo, just wait till the other three have chosen a location, then go somewhere else. Chances are they'll all be dead before there's any chance of meeting up again.
---
Welcome to Appalachia, I'm glad to hear you're enjoying it! I've been playing since launch; it was my love of the franchise as a whole that kept me going. I adore Fallout and have played them all (except Tactics, we do not speak of Tactics 😝). 
---
I love their storytelling and all the little tidbits they leave lying around - it makes it feel like a very real and inhabited (albeit currently deserted) world. One of the Whitespring holotapes actually made me cry. 
---
I hope you'll continue having a blast, and if you ever want another part time teammate, hit me up (goes for anyone really)! PSN is the same as my Reddit handle.
---
Whatever you do don’t rush, trust me, the best part is the journey.
---
Endgame feels empty and pointless.
---
😀
---
I waited until level 140 to launch a nuke. I've spent most of my time exploring, doing events, and I didn't discover the fun of challenges until late into game either. I do the dailies and weeklies, work on collecting all the magazines and am working on completing the possum badge challenges too. Those alone keep me playing for a couple hours every day and dont feel like a grind.
---
I just do small time charity, I leave free ammo un a bag in my shop regularly,  and if I come into a sweet legendary that's low lvl, I'll hunt down a character close to its lvl and give them it. Best gift so far was an lvl20 AAE Gatling gun. Also if I see low lvls with high rads I'll usually dump 10+ radaway for them, I'm usually drowning in the stuff tho, so that's a win win kinda thing.
---
im pretty terrible aiming
---
Depends what you like! I've found endurance useful, as well as agility for things like pistols and running.id say as you start out, look for a couple of damage increasing perks and some basic survival ones too.
---
Hmm that doesn’t sound promising
---
I perfectly realize that. I also realize that crowd may be more lucrative. So as some one who at most will maybe now nad then when bored try that mode and some one who loves Adventure mode, I fear for the mode I like. 
---
Just because that's the way it is doesn't mean I have to like it :P.
---
I thought you could toggle 'fill' to off. Is that not right? Or is that if you just want to fill a team with friends and not have it done automatically?
---
If only those events ever seemed to pop up. But ty for this info!!
---
I believe so I’m in Australia and every time I come across a player they have a Ozzie accent
---
I doubt Bethesda bases its strategic decisions, that ultimately turn into development roadmaps for their game(s)based on reddit or the forums (except for the occasional uproar) or any social media, except in very few cases (used as PR, like the Bobby pin's). A company dec model is more like this:
---
Check player count on server within a specific timeframes
---
Check hits on activities per activity type
---
Introduce new game modes to increase player count (Survival, new quests, BR) to generate more income.
---
Lead player count/new player count to microtransactions store to increase revenue
---
Do this every quarter to show off before your company's stakeholders and increase share value.
---
It's amazing how so many players still believe major players in the gaming industry are either NGOs or democratic corps. This is business, entertaining people is their core business, but generating revenue is their goal.
---
Your poll is a great idea, but don't count on Bethesda to carry any suggestions from its results.
---
So what you're saying is you're one of the people who put useless items in their vendor? That really steams my hams here. Do you know how much time I waste checking out vendors with costumes instead of armor? Toooo much. Good luck with your vendor though!
---
There's also 100 lvl door to ZAX core, i'm curious what you can find there.
---
Nope - you have to find cranberries wild, and they're not common. 
---
You can plant blackberries in your camp, but they're not very useful.
---
Remember to pay it forward to noobs after you get geared up and settled.
---
It should do that automatically, from what i have read is that Australian's often find them self together with Japaneses players.
---
I live in Scandinavia and i end up with players from Scandinavia, UK,Germany, Russia, etc, etc...
---
But have noe delays, i play both on PC and Xbox, fast and stable, probably 2 drops on eatch system in a month...
---
If you are just joining a game solo you shouldnt have any delay. If you are joining  a friend  they may not be in australia.
---
So I usually go in solo than invite friends to my game.
---
If you are using a VPN or something that could also account for the delay.
---
As far as I know it puts you in solo. Not 100% sure as I've not felt the need to try, it's a really bad idea.
---
Here are a few tips I have learned through my play time (lvl 190)
---
Scrap every single armor and weapon you come across to learn The Mods for them.
---
That way when you find a nice legendary weapon or armor you like you can upgrade it to your play style.
---
 Loot every piece of junk you find, bulk it and sell to the vendors to get your 1400 caps per day.  This uses a bunch of plastic so definitely find places that have plastics. Just North of Bolton Greens is a crazy cat lady house with lots of cat bowls you can scrap for plastic.
---
 Try to have a plan what kind of build you want so you don't waste perk points when you level up.  There are websites out there that will help you. I did not use one as I like to do things by myself but that put me around level 80 when I finally got my build to where I wanted.
---
 Taking over workshops will give you plans as rewards. Defending the same workshops will also give you plans as rewards.
---
 Remember you can move your base anywhere that isn't a map location.  It's handy when you become over encumbered and need to scrap some stuff fast.
---
 Do events around you, as many as you can.  They can reward plans, caps, experience, items, rare outfits ect...
---
Most important... have fun!
---
 That's all I can think of right now.  I'm sure others have more and better tips for you as well.
---
It depends on the type of build you'd like to go for.   
---
Melee, rifle, etc.  
---
Personally, I really enjoyed a lot of what luck had to offer. At least back when I played at launch. I'll probably end up with a similar build.
---
It's only been two days, don't stress.  There are holotapes that go up to level 101, and the most I've seen anyone achieve is level 20 so far.  
---
I'm sure all will be revealed haha
---
Great to hear but to be fair it’s in a
---
Lot better shape now than it has ever been. You did the right thing waiting.
---
Yeah I hope so!
---
Matches can be pretty quick. Last night one of my shortest matches was about 3.5 minutes but I also managed to kill 2 players in that time. You get XP for kills, downs, AI kills, and other stuff. You also get a little bit of Adventure Mode XP and Adventure mode caps, on top of the NW xp stuff.
---
It’s amazing I spent some time last night and this morning in survival and upon spawning in I was immediately in the top 3.  I played for about 2 hours hanging around Whitesprings and only saw 3 players the whole time.
---
I can't yet... I'm on vacation. I probably will (since unlike survival it seems I lose nothing by trying it). But I just worry if it becomes too successful if Bethesda will just forget about adventure mode. I mean companies will do that (Rockstar promised us SP DLC for GTA V before online became successful and then they completely forgot about SP at all and I'd be shocked if we see anything more for SP RDR2).
---
Yep seen him
---
Cool! What kind of guests will you be having?
---
That male version from the mistress of mystery dress is amazing!  I Hope everyone get to see this.
---
I believe X-02 **is** the Hellfire PA
---
Edit: My bad, sorry X-03 is the Hellfire XD My bad, X-02 is the more fancied up PA of the X-01 variety
---
with a little balance I would defend and have fun doing it even if I lost from time to time but right now my build just completely sucks for pvp and its awesome for all things pve. so it is what it is and I suffer the consequence of my chosen play style from time to time. by the same token in pve I often let stealthy gimmicky players die in pve and loot them so they can suffer the consequences of their builds. not all of them. just the ones with the obvious tell tales of being a douche. ie mascot head, stealth, annoying ass open mic etc. basically players I don't like. if they fall I loot them on principle. "yup your build sucks for pve thank you for the ballistic fiber."
---
Now this needs to be upvoted
---
I usually just quit when I die, can you rotate the camera when spectating? If not then it doesn’t give much of an advantage.
---
Most people should be playing on third person anyway. So it’s not like they’ll be able to spot something you wouldn’t.
---
All of this is if you can’t rotate, which reading your other comment leads me to believe that you can.
---
It got killed as soon as it got out of E3.
---
You start out with 250 base hp. You get 45 more from the lifegiver perk if you have it. 50 more from buffjet. I believe some magazine also gives you a bit more if you're lucky enough to find it
---
Take your time. This game is less story focused than previous titles but has loads more to see and explore. 
---
Perks confused me for a while at first, so once you figure out your play style and which weapons you like, invest levels into that weapon. You can save level ups until you're ready to invest them. 
---
Mutations are fun! Make sure you do invest into level 2 starches genes and buy your mutations from player vendors, not the game vendors. You'll save tons. 
---
Make sure you get your 1400 caps from selling to vendors every day.
---
At low levels (and high levels too really) Pharma Farma is an amazing perk card. I survived solely by getting extra stimpacks from kits and selling all the chems I found. I still do this at almost level 200.
---
sometimes when trying to switch to someone else it says it’s changing the spectated player but the screen’s black and usually ends up crashing the whole game. last time it happened was yesterday. 
---
also since you can’t switch to a first person view when the other player hides in a bush or stands in front of a wall you can’t see shit
---
German.
---
I know this going to come as a shock, but I’m not one of the game developers, hence the fact there’s no distinction made between armor and apparel in that little inventory box is not my oversight.....
---
I was going to run a solo last night but would've been just me and one other at the blast zone it looked like.
---
the game did suck, the launch was terrible. the following months of nerfs were worse. now things are finally where they should be.
---
I've never gotten any paint from doing TD, and for a while my daily routine included a trip to the basement. Is there something I should be doing differently? Dress up in my BOS finest or something? 
---
Purified water and 5.56, the occasional scribe outfit. Very frustrating. On a good note I bought the Initiate paint at a vending machine so while my pride is gone at least I have shiny armor.
---
also, is anyone ever going to come clean out that drop box? it's turning into a fire hazard I would think
---
Oh we are in a different time period for us we are still in Appalachia but in fallout new Vegas fallout 4 timeline around a few months before 111 opens currently
---
Well, damn. Woulda been nice knowing this 25 stimpacks and 1,500 rounds earlier
---
*Sigh*. I'll give it another go this weekend
---
It's about 50/50 for me. When I get a whole squad with mics, we usually get to the top 5. If not... well carnage ensues and more than once I've been the sole survivor of the squad (right before being ambushed by more cohesive units and dying like a dog). :)
---
BUFFTATS!!!!!!!
---
Server stability is a persistent problem. It gets worse with high traffic. New content. Influx of new players. Lots of server hopping. 
---
It'll calm down.
---
Try it with friends, like a full squad, if you haven't
---
I wondered about that!!
---
That delay has killed me at least twice. Step out of cover, aim and fire.... er.. fire... um.. fire please? Nothing happens, dead.
---
Its a Toggle.  Tap Shift a second time to stop sprinting (or let go of W as you noted).
---
&gt;Especially all the YouTubers who acted like it was one of the worst games in history
---
If you were never a FO player.. I guess you would not understand it.. I stuck with it from day one..
---
Because I have consistently played it... I beat my stability drum... but have never had issue with "not fun"! I'm NOT a pvp player but ok, wow.. YA! NW is a damn lot of fun.. Finally removing the legendary effects for a PVP is the right answer.
---
I do predict a downfall as some players that progress and end up with some advantage as they move up in level.
---
Another fear is the nuke code keys. Someone somewhere may discover a pattern or other and end up constantly nuking the field and player count will slowly dwindle. Let's hope I'm wrong. There are some players out there where their goal is to just push the limits of a system, find it's weakness, exploit it rather than just play it. It is a different world than when I was a kid! Maybe that's why I like the "slower" life and thus Love Bethesda for having a place I can call home. I love your game man!!! (here comes the drum beat) but got to work on stabilization.. bam, bam, bam....
---
Playing NW, I was at first having issues with the rush in the lobby and feeling of having no time to figure out the perk cards until I realized that they changed the keys (for the controller on PC) for removing and applying perk cards. Why on earth they use different keys than elsewhere? The Architect in me says it should have been consistent with the other instances in the application. I also feel a lot of the comments are SO correct about, Why does the player not come back to the Lobby after a session end/completion??
---
i think that would be better if (i don't know if already exist) there was a perk card to buff the AP, more tactical choises over what perk cards use
---
What do you mean by team exploits? I've had some dodgy-seeming team requests and wondered if there was a way they could mug me if i accepted
---
Sometimes it's a deathclaw labeled traveling merchant
---
They could use the new terminals to do these polls which i think would be exciting and an effective use for them.
---
Explore everything but limit yourself to the Forest for the time being. The area is huge and there's so much to do. Try looking at the big houses on the east side of the dried-up lake. There's a great quest to be found over there.
---
1 tweak that I would like to see this post have:
---
#formatting
---
They could never support mods on official servers. It would have to be private servers and the characters wouldnt able to go back and forth.
---
As a rabbit headed person in a tux this makes me happy to know my brethren are out there doing the same thing I do lol.
---
Most of my experience of this is in Flatwoods, which is where I do most of my hunting. Interesting that all of the similar perks are exhibiting the same problem, makes sense. I wonder how much network communication is involved in the success determination process?
---
Ah. I've seen that one. Never realised it could be deathclaw or human.
---
As far as I'm aware, those haven't been found yet, might not be available.
---
Don't be a Cunt.
---
Not sure if for everyone but PC here and same issue.
---
Across all my accounts.
---
This 'repeatable' has the rare honor of joining all the 'dailies' in The Savage Divide and The Mire that I cannot 'trigger'.
---
Hashtag justBethesdathings
---
Good question, the mentioned it in the latest patch note so it should already be in the game...
---
I agree that the testing you did in the past was legitimate, but from what I'm hearing, and seeing, the Furious effect may not be working the same on all weapons, or on all enemies, shooting a SB this morning I found that hitting a Wing vs Torso was yielding different results, and causing the stack up to restart as though you hit a different enemy.
---
Same here, thought I’d give it a try last night and all of a sudden five hours blinked by. Part of the fun was being a dork in the lobby: playing music on stage, naked boxing matches, and joining this one guy in the middle of the lobby who was spamming the irradiated emoticon - we just stood there and threw up for 90 seconds together.
---
Yup, bugged :/
---
All I can say is your lucky to have customers.  If you dont like that i hold a weapon at your shop, put up a sign, and I'll go somewhere else.
---
Im not at my camp 90% of the time, and even if i was, I'd be grateful to have people checking out my items for sale.
---
Maybe you should also require a dress code too... :D (like only formal wear at my shop).
---
I second this!
---
Yeah, me too. I played one game of NW and decided it wasn't for me.  Went right back to Adventure mode to play around in CAMP build mode for 3 hours whenever I play.   So far all I've noticed with the influx new players in Adventure is that they don't know all the in-game mechanics.  Im on xbox, people are generally pretty passive.
---
I guess we'll see which kind of people sticks around after the free trial ends
---
Yeah all the servers I've found have been flooded with new players. I was confused at first because I was only swing one or two vendors on the map compared to the usual 10-15.
---
Then I looked over at flatwoods.
---
Wait a month, let the baby flowers grow.
---
Probably reward for becoming overseer lv 599 :D
---
People also told you it was a ton of fun and was only going to get better.  Shoulda listened to us instead.
---
You can kind of respec but it can take some time. Really you just need to decide what type of weapons/gameplay you want to spec into. Strength is good for basically everyone since you get more carryweight and weight reduction perks and is for melee and shotgun damage. Perception is for rifles and lock picking. Inteligence is good for many things like durability enhancement, modding weapons and armor and also bonus explosive damage which can be helpful. Luck has a ton of good stuff like super duper, bloody mess, starched genes. 
---
Overall I wouldn't worry about it that much, you get a ton of points and levels come easy.
---
The Public Workshop tip is a good one. Great rewards for both taking over and defending (once, I never hang around after the first defend mission) though I do recall the first ever plan I won was for the Dirty Ashtray. Bah.
---
Eh, 7 months.
---
I have had mixed thoughts. I’m not a pvp person so I’m still wondering if it will be something I like.
---
You do, a pretty decent amount too. 
---
Action boy/girl and marathoner. Also the perks that give you 20% speed when holding a specific weapon, also there is the run faster when below 50% hp. 
---
That’s all the ones I know.
---
Give Adam his apple back.
---
I've seen Goat Legs at lvl 9-  Agility I think. Take no fall damage.
---
But you knew it was going to have content added for years, not a static game.
---
Yeah dude, Reddit is not exactly 100% reliable
---
someone, somewhere, already said it but i would love a vault map, claustrophobic ambientations and close quarter fights, be careful around the corner, awesome.
---
Ignorance is not stupidity.  People who didn't know this aren't dumb, they just didn't know this.
---
I don't want mine looking like a Dung pile, everyone is searching those for DC skins right now, your junk wouldn't last no time.
---
High strength is a must for melee.  
---
For Adventure mode/non-PvP:
---
Incisor3 for armor penetration. Martial Artist3 for swing speed, bloody mess3 for additional damage.  Glowsight3 for additional damage to glowing enemies.
---
Fireproof for resistance against fire and sonic attacks
---
If you plan on playing mostly solo, I would not spend too many points in Charisma - most of those are for team benefits.  Couple for lone wander and tenderizer, swap out hard bargain when trading.
---
Consider if you want 1H or 2H weapon as primary.  (there are perks for both) 
---
2H generally do more damage per hit, but 1H generally hit faster, so ultimately may do more damage in the same time frame. (3 hits at 80 per is better than 1 hit at 180).  
---
2H weapons are heavier.  (super sledge is 8#, a switchblade is 0.4#)
---
Gauntlets and a few other high damage 1H weapons cannot be used while in PA.
---
Your weapon of choice will change over time - your main will become less effective for the enemies you are fighting - time for something new.  Because melee is up close and personal, I like vampire weapons, as they regen your health every hit.
---
I will melee any Sasquatch with a vampire switchblade, but change to heavier guns for SBs and Assaultrons.
---
  Before I went full time PA, I used a combination of Chameleon and cloaking armor. 
---
But you have to be standing still for chameleon effect.  Cloaking activates only when hit, but good in a mob.  Chameleon worked b/c sniper was going to be my secondary specialty.
---
I don't play PvP, so I'll leave that to others to address.
---
Damn :( thx!
---
One of the best things to do early on is capture workshops.  Even if you don't set anything up they are great for exp, caps, plans, and meds.  Early on you will always be looking for ammo and stimpacks, so again capture the workshops for easy rewards.
---
I started with a rifle/melee hybrid character and still run it.  Try to find some weapons you enjoy and then use your perks to boost them.
---
A good idea is to pick a melee type at the start to save ammo, and then find 2 guns that use different ammo types. This way you can save on crafting it.
---
Make sure you remember to pick up higher level weapons as you advance.  You can find level 1 hunting rifles early on but make sure that once you go up in level to replace those.  Even if it's the same weapon type the damage is noticeable.
---
That’s a great idea!
---
The circle collapses/shrinks and they burn together,
---
An Asari thumb? Is that a mass effect reference I smell?
---
You have a new mutation: cancer
---
To do it manually, you gotta play word scramble with the code pieces. Find it on your own. Or you can wait till the weekend for the enclave bunker to provide it. Usually up by Friday.
---
Doing it on your own can give several answers and you gotta use up a key card for every try.
---
I've got about 20 at this point, sadly you can't trade them. Somehow I traded my first camera after completing the quest, some guy requested it and I just gave it to him, haven't managed to since then though.
---
I just find a quiet place to sit down while I'm in the lobby. I don't want any trouble.
---
Ive done the daily quest with the Pioneer Robot st the swamp.
---
He want you to collect some items fromm bugs and after finishing this quest ive got 1 plan for a Trophy.
---
I saw a camp with a wendigo Trophy so i think i just do this quest over and over again to get it?
---
You can kind of test what theyll look like in game by going to the part where you choose body-shape and then adjust back and forth from there.
---
They even said on stage "a game where anyone could kill anyone, no-one chose to. It gives us a bright future for mankind". 
---
But also here is a mode where you only kill other people.
---
Pathetic. The gameplay is nowhere near tight enough for that.
---
Awesomeness!
---
I was under the impression that you couldn't tame mirelurk kings any longer. I must ( and hopefully) be misremembering.
---
This is great news because some asshats killed my old ladys mirelurk king, Elvis. She was devastated. 
---
Bethesda! Please make our beloved pets repairable. Some bones, hides and some raw meat. Let us Frankenstein them back together
---
As I approach the 50 year old mark I am becoming more and more surrounded by immature fools (as I was at their age I admit. I am only perfect in the bedroom with the lights out wink wink nod nod.) you being honest and mature about your learning experience gives me hope. good on you mate hope you do well in the game and in life. o7
---
Am I the only person having an audio issue with the game during this trial!? Everyone out here having a grand old time playing and I'm just like "I can't hear a fucking thing!" This is bullshit.
---
YEAH. ESO is currently the most popular MMO game in the world.
---
I love adventure mode and was hesitant about NW too. I don’t usually play BR games and I suck at PVP. That being said, it’s hard to tear myself away from NW, been staying up til 3am playing it these last two nights. It’s so much fun and completely different from the main game. Worth checking out when you get home.
---
Well at least it's not just me and my incapability.
---
Thanks for your respond!
---
There’s no rotating. And a lot of people play third person? I thought majority went for first person.
---
It did suck at release.  It's a very different game now.
---
They probably do, idk. They should do third though as you said, better POV.
---
How easily craftable are missiles and mini nukes? If i one day decide to go on an explosion rampage would I be able to make a good amount of them if I hadn't been saving them up before?
---
but you can use a keyboard for console.
---
In addition, on console you have been able to send instant message to users even if not on ur friend list (the typical screencaps I see in groups about stuffs) but in PC there is no way to communicate via text, no chat, no direct messages, no friend list / ability to send messages like in Origin, Battlenet, Uplay etc...
---
Pleasure :)
---
Hey, they say that misery likes company.
---
I would rather think that misery is a little bit less miserable if in company ;)
---
I've come across too many bugs to let it be fun for me. Most guns I pick up if they're automatic will stop firing after a couple shots, the gun still is showing the recoil animation while the trigger is held but no bullets resulting in a death for me which is very frustrating.
---
Have you met many Arabs, OP?
---
Wendigo trophy is part of the sheepsquatch quest line
---
I've only been back in the game since Monday, but I immediately went to Vault 76 to give the newbies water and food.
---
Atom shop. Press confirm on already purchased atire to equip it in nw.
---
Thanks, you too.  One thing I've learned is that if a murderous clown hands you a costume, you wear it and follow him.  It's better than the alternative.
---
This cost me two kills in NW last night as I had two dudes dead to rights coming through a door way on a boat. Instead, I just sat there firing no rounds with the barrel spinning haha.
---
Asari not sorry 🙃
---
No stash to track in NW, no vendors to track, no massive amount of items and creatures to track. Yeah, I think that the servers can and are handling 51 players pretty well.
---
It's not.  I don't use it.
---
You attract more attention running around.  It's that movement that catches the eye.   Move from cover to cover.
---
No one is calling anyone stupid, except you. It’s not immediately obvious that you can have more than one perk card of the same SPECIAL stat. I found out by accident.
---
The wendigo plan isn’t there. He only gives bug plans afaik. The wendigo is at the hotel in the mire with boomer. You find a note on a table in front. Pretty fun little quest.
---
I play solo now...not that i didnt try team. I just got pissed that i was reviving my teammates, but when i went down the other 3 just ignored me (played at least 40 matches not one person revived me)....f#$k that ppl.
---
NW is smooth and fairly fun but after playing  2 rounds it was already getting boring.  I think there is some initial hype but people are gonna spend most of their time in adventure.
---
Well some people seem to be unhappy with it's inclusion as in the lore, it makes no utter sense (I do want that PA badly, but I wanna see what Beth does to make it fit hehe).
---
Hellfire was first created and made Adams Air force base by the Enclave around 2277, which is well beyond when 76 takes place, so it already dones;t make much sense, as how does a PA, said to be made in the future, exist in 76, where the little enclave were cut off from other enclave bases like Poseidon oil rig and Adams Air force base? A bit odd I may say.
---
A terminal inside also requested for X-02 PA inside Vault 51, which shows that they did have connection to the enclave still, but just how? If MODUS was cut off, (he was having a lil chat with VAX, computer of 51, but when Kovac Muldoon went down, well lets say that chat got rudely interrupted). The X-02 was made shortly after the destruction of the Poseidon oil rig in 2242, which is also way beyond where we're at in FAllout 76, which is the year 2102, so its a huge 100 year gap difference for both X-02 and X-03 were first created by the enclave, so it's all just very shrouded on how on Gods good scorched earth those two PA's are mentioned, hence some peoples disapproval.
---
TL;DR : X-03 Hellfire, and X-02 made over 100 years after vault 76 opened, and yet they shown in game, how so? Some people mad, get their excavator PA and All rise' and riot
---
Yeah.   Not looking for buffs just wanted a proper combat outfit.
---
There is a NW pacifist mode, but you have to stay in Vault 51 and scrub the toilets while a Mr Handy flicks you with a wet towel.
---
I'm glad you are not having any crashes or anything. I'm here to say that some of us still have a lot of crashes and disconnects and bugs so be prepared for that at least on PC, you have a like 50/50 chance of not having any bugs when you get this game
---
Nah, first 20-30 lvls seem to take longer (especially if you tend to explore over questing) Then it picks up speed until about the 100ish rang. Your doin just fine little one. ;)
---
I think around 10 of rarish materials like screws or springs. Not that hard to make if you collect junk.
---
Yea, finding the 1st one was a PITA.  I server hopped @ Wavy Willards about 5 times before I found one.  
---
For each hop, if he wasn't there, I went inside and tool out frustration on the scorched.  Bonus: found a bobblehead or two and a deathclaw hide during those runs.
---
  I found/picked up a second deluxe camera a couple nights ago - IDK if you get the quest if I drop it for you...
---
*fissure site prime discovered*
---
Yup, the coolest until now, i have it on a short wall where you go down the stairs, you look straight into it's eyes while you go down, lol
---
It’s a prototype. Information from vault 51 terminal
---
More like lvl 760. Ya know...just cause...🤣
---
I wish him the best of health, I’d hate to see king John ill.
---
Also there’s the ironclad perk.
---
https://variety.com/2019/gaming/news/video-games-cvaa-accessibility-law-1203099440/
---
Just use a rad away bruh
---
Then why can I crash It at will with max size blueprint being placed a couple times?
---
Your coming in at it's prime though. I defended the game but it was very flawed at release. I stopped for 4-5 months after the crazy duping fiasco. But coming back the game has grown a lot and is really worth it now. And by fall this is going to be a great game. The game took 9-12 months to become what it was suppose to be.
---
Nope, your saves and atom shop purchases will not carry over to other platforms/services.
---
I have one for sale at my camp for like 40 caps I think also on pc. I'll be on a little later if you want to meet up.
---
yeah, best to not hold any cold drink's in one hand while doing the quest, hehehe
---
They really are easy, aren't they?  Sometimes it's harder to earn 10 atoms on a daily than score a 3* weekly legendary
---
i'm level 268 atm and for about 100 last levels my end-game has been:
---
-legendary farming (mainly at west-tek)
---
-trading for better gear with other players (through a certain FO76 market subreddit)
---
-finding ways to improve my camp design and/or location
---
-server-hopping for good vendor deals and selling stuff at my own vending machine (which only recently became possible with the introduction of player vending)
---
-keeping a regular supply of stuff to scrip and vendor to reach the daily limit
---
This is what the lore on the loading screens say.  I don't remember anything about the raiders originating from Whitesprings.
---
Where would said list come from? The recent datamine had all the Atomic Shop items in but there's no way of knowing which are rewards as far as I'm aware.
---
Dark times indeed...
---
so have a toggle to turn it off.  easy.
---
I think so, too.
---
Many people are saying NW is what survival should have been. It may have killed of what little love people had for survival mode.
---
you can't use mods in NW mode.
---
What? Max size blueprint just means a large sized camp being all placed at once. Only takes a couple times of placing It to lag out and crash the servers at will.
---
Whats your gamertag xbox ps4? Pc?
---
Some perks add energy or damage resistance I haven’t seen a perk list but I know there’s a perk that adds damage resistance if you’re shooting a heavy weapon so that plus ironclad would stop some damage
---
I think what you're looking for is party chat...
---
I had the game when it first came out and even played beta, I absolutely loved it. The only issue me and many many others had was lag and duplication (which made the guns I earned worthless). I see that they've fixed so many issues and this game is beautiful now, I am actually happy to see this as it is now.
---
When I started my first match (first ever Battle Royale) my aims were to A) Kill someone. B) Live for more than five minutes.
---
In the end I managed eight minutes and mowed down two other players with a sub-machine gun.
---
I was so happy.
---
Now I want more. Much more...
---
Maybe from someone who’s been playing it a lot could create a list on what they’ve unlocked so far and loads of different players could expand it if they are higher levels
---
Holy crap, that is amazing!  I was hoping for some crazy cards.
---
Bad it's like every other battle royale game/mod, nobody comunicates if you solo que.
---
Wholeheartely agree and indeed it's a bit less miserable lol
---
For me, this was the first Multiplayer game I've done....from what I've heard, I'm very lucky in that! I've played every FO as they were released, right back to the first and I'm really enjoying this one! 
---
You may want to check out this sub: r/filthycasual it's a bit more....casual? 👍😁
---
The game had some problems sure, but to be totally honest most people just jumped on the bandwagon of hate so they can get more views on their Channel on YouTube. Of all the YouTubers covering the game I've actually seen very few actually play it themselves recently.
---
Too many people had already decided to hate the game before it ever came out.
---
darn I didn't know that, it seems like a real design flaw to have a server shutdown like that.
---
When you do an event to power up a Power Plant, which takes a good amount of time, then capture its workshop its an investment you've made only to be let down by the server.
---
I remember Star Wars Galaxies, I used to setup farming machines, they would stay running for days, with me logged off and I could come and pickup their products.
---
Everyone figthing, some of them naked, and I'm playing the piano. I agree, that's what a hub should be
---
It also makes the Scorchbeast Queen event undo-able. You really need 8+ lvl 50s to beat her.
---
In PS4, hold Square to holster your weapon
---
I'm not sure I agree with the statement of Never.  Also, I don't see any issue with private servers being part of the roadmap going into the future.  People have been interested in that function since before the game was released.
---
We (my husband and I) preordered it on launch and played endlessly for a couple of months. I had a great time at the start until I had completed quests and what was left, at that time, was Nuke Farming Whitesprings or Queen, which was fun for a while until it wasn't. I did get salty for a while about it and put it down but I'm having a good time now. :D
---
Technically speaking, you're running all the time. It's the sprinting that drains AP.
---
Now if you were forced to move at walking speed all the time (PC key:C), then yeah, I could see the point.
---
I like the fact that sprinting is restricted. It forces a slower, tactical, think and move style of gameplay. As opposed to "he who masters twitch reflex, masters them all".
---
I've played all day and night since the game came out and won 20 something matches. I'm only lvl 21. I dont think people are high enough to make such a list yet.
---
New Player also dont understand the pet mechanic, I had to stop 2 level 20 guys from attacking a friends deathclaw ... A bit of emoting and a mean ''stop'' via microphone seem to do the trick.
---
Also the other annoying thing is the stash size
---
Did you scan your face and upload it to the game?
---
It seems to be completely dependent on the individual, personally I never get disconnects or crashes but then some people get them constantly. I have a feeling it has something to do their location or possibly the servers/netcode are very sensitive to packet loss so even if your internet seems fine for all other uses it might not be for 76. Could also have to do with your routing to the server might be a bad hop on the way. Since you are on PC there are some network tests I could have you run to see if we can find the issue if you want.
---
Yes, me too. I get scared when I find another player. And I forget how to shoot.
---
Good to know this at level 14.
---
I like the high cost of running, it adds an extra challenge. Will you risk running from point A to point B, or find another way around where you can sneak?
---
Handsome little fella!
---
There is no crossplay features and although i think it would probably be okay to implement it between the console versions but i wouldn't want it with PC due to the different inputs, different settings and hackers/modders etc
---
I'm a lousy shot anyway, but I also panic in tense situations and fumble the controls a lot. When I get kills in NW it's with a machine gun. When in doubt, spray.
---
So glad I live alone in a house with my husband lol. I'm punching along with everyone else.
---
Well, I'm thankful for all the ppl that shit on this game non-stop. Most of them don't buy the game, shit on it, and when Bethesda sees that the sale numbers are lower and could get bigger than that they are, they keep working on this game. If more people bought this game, they wouldn't work this hard for the new improvements and features. So yeah, you, the guy that keeps making the same 2018 refund jokes on every social media picture they put, thank you! Your shitposting makes the game better for us, the players. Even if you waste your time for some social media points. 
---
I know there are some stupid decisions like the Atom Shop repair kits that are still present (basically pay to win), but other than that, the game seems kinda fun.
---
 I do agree with other commenters that Juicehead and other clickbait youtubers still use Fallout76 as a content creator money machine... Can't blame them, $$$.
---
And one more thing, Todd said on E3 that we have one of the nicest player communities, and that is true, only because this game isn't that mainstream. It attracts specific players.  But that might change with the Battle Royale mode, since it could attract some new type of players.
---
Unless they incentivise more...like winning a match give you something more like caps or scrip, I dont think it will hold up. PvP is a joke, but was a thing, and the ISS and the burrows and the habitat event etc....when u try it, you'll see that it's a loop of dying and waiting....not worth the reward in the long term.
---
&gt; didn't deliver on what was promised?
---
The only case of that was with the canvas bags, which didn't affect the majority of players. The game itself was exactly as advertised, barring the bugs. Countless people complained about the fact that it wasn't just Fallout 5, even though it was explicitly stated numerous times that it wasn't going to be one of those games.
---
Welcome to the Wasteland! Join the fo76 filthy casuals sub, that's the one we're actual fans of the game hang out. r/fo76filthycasuals
---
Honestly the adventure mode rewards aren't great, but the mode is fun to play a few matches every now and then, with it's own internal lvl track.
---
This game has a huge console presence. I know they will do the private servers and mods eventually but I can’t see them stoping the content for this or wastelanders for the mods. 
---
After wastelanders I can see it being the next thing
---
A majority of people from my experience (including myself) don't use a mic. It's also a more direct way of pin pointing someones location.
---
I think they just need to put more perks to accompany you, so in the end you can have more ap if you wish and others could have more dmg. would make it balanced imo. (btw I know there are currently perk cards for this I ment more versatile ones) (also have no found every perk card so maybe tehre is already xd)  
---
But yea there should be an advantage and disadvantage to every QOL improvement in br imo  
---
\-advantage run further  
---
\-disadvantage use a perk slot that could have been used for more dmg/defense
---
Can you get any plans or whatever without winning the whole match and becoming the overseer?
---
1st. It would be very hard to have client side mods that alter the game when it runs off of a public server. So I would say Never. Also private servers would only be a thing if you paid for them monthly like an ark server.
---
Pc and I don't release my info on reddit. I've got nutcase stalkers claiming all kinds of crazy things. Like two days ago  I was accused of secretly being an alt-righter and have an alt on the mod team here.
---
Congrats on getting a game for free long after the serious issues have (mostly) been worked out. We complained because we paid $60+ for, at best, a beta at launch. The complaints were valid.
---
Some kind of berserker card would help a great deal. Maybe an expensive AG card that offers 45% less damage while sprinting w a melee weapon
---
This is great. Well done!
---
As far as I've uncovered, Bethesda does not have shareholders and is a private company, they are owned by Zenimax however, yet still don't have shareholders. At least that's what I saw in a recent interview with Todd Howard. But I have to agree, something ain't right with the way they seem to be doing things.
---
The only melee kills I have got have been inside buildings.
---
To be fair the beta was complete fucking garbage. For what it should have been at that point at least. I knew they would at minimum make it enjoyable for a little while and I had already preordered so I gave it about 4 months and then logged in for the first time since release to a decent, playable game with minor bugs. So far it has only gotten better!
---
Yeah juce has had quite the turnaround keeping up with his videoes he went from bashing on the game to giving honest feed back. Now he seems genuinely happy that the game is successful.
---
To bag would love to see you banned for exploitation
---
Exact same issue as me.   Have the quest but nothing starts and the quest disappears.    The daily from Treadly for some reason reappears and becomes doable again even if completed earlier.      This first happened to me a few weeks ago so I doubt the last update is responsible for that behavior. The last update is definitely responsible for Operation Tidy not working.
---
They deserve credit for making and sticking by a game with a terrible launch
---
Okay, thats what I thought, but what does this have to do with NW server, as you said?
---
Can you place your CAMP in Nuclear Winter? I haven't tried it, but I don't think that you can. And why would you do that?
---
And how do you know the whole server crashes and not just your client?
---
I also have this problem on xbox. And need a fix that's not "reset the game"
---
I think it works better as a "persistent" event you can only access from the main menu. I call it such because it gives you exp and caps for adventure mode(although the rewards amounts aren't great).
---
Use the search bar and look at a multiple posts that outline this build. That’s what I did to pick and choose the perks that would be best for me because I would have missed other suggestions had I only checked one post. You’ll see some common similarities but there are some perks that are more flexible. Good luck, it’s hands down my favorite build, you can just about solo anything in seconds
---
You can't change the title
---
If you dont use a mic in battle royal then the lack of communication is due to a decision you are making. In my experience the majority of players that have ranked up and won alot of matches do use a mic. Not all, but the majority.
---
probably, but there is on player that is lv32, he wrote in here earlier today about the exact same thing :)
---
I want text chat  for all consoles
---
I mean when you think about it, bugs are always a part of Bethesda games, sometimes they're even a feature. Putting a dozen people in the same game in real-time isn't going to improve that by any means. Not saying it shouldn't have been better tested, there were definitely some inexcusable bugs, I got so frustrated at one point that I actually laid down the controller for a good month or two - but it was definitely expected.
---
I think we need another round of that dude convincing the new players to go into his maze with a death claw on it and lock them in it lol.
---
Even he doesnt have many rewards to take note of.
---
I got nerd rage lvl 3
---
Worked fine two days ago, so it is up to your definition of "a while back". Though like all mods it needs updates after each larger patch, so sometimes it is down a few hours after a recent patch.
---
It's the lighting.  Whenever there's a light that's blasting directly downward, like at Watoga Station, your character's face looks very strange.  You can see it for yourself in your own CAMP.  Stand directly under a light and you look gaunt.  Back away from the light, and you look normal.
---
There is a bug with mics on xbox at least where it just dosent register the mic some times and requires a reset of the game.
---
The game has made huge improvements, all the negative press is from people who haven't played. I guess the rest of us who do play are a bit at fault for not expressing the progress the game has made. We're  just too busy playing.
---
I am on xbox. I have yet to encounter this problem.
---
true :/
---
I don't complain, even I'm not sometimes the only marked camp on the map :).
---
I have my camp in the Forest. I've built it after being kicked from my original location (before the camp spawn relog was implemented) and I haven't moved it since. I actually like to see the Forest region full of white dots again and I love when a newbie stumbles upon my camp.
---
Endgame was supposed to be nukes, but because nuke codes are online now, they really scaled some of them down. I expect wastelanders will have high level content
---
Rofl they want us to test these things. That is literally the point of betas and as soon as I found this I reported it to Bethesda AND even to aten_ra the guy who does the bug roundups.
---
So I wouldn't get banned anyways, as I've literally been doing what Bethesda wants us to do. Lol
---
You might try disabling DOF. On my laptop (with an nVidia 965M, I think), it took High detail from unplayable janky to pretty smooth.
---
Pretty much that.  Pacifist doesn't save you when in a team, if someone in your team engages a friend that's not in the team, the whole team is then in PvP with them.  Their friend who's not part of the team then will just proceed to shoot and kill you.  Its always jeopardy when teaming up with low levels or other random players, they could be baiting you in for an easy kill.
---
Welcome to the struggle grunt. Now post complaints about it on here often and you’ll be promoted fast!
---
I think you should be able to sprint for longer but the sprinting speed should be reduced as well.
---
Trying to shoot someone while they’re at sprint speed in this game is near impossible, especially on console
---
No pre-made teams on xbox.
---
I got lucky with a decent Agility perk - something like avoid 30% of incoming damage at the cost of AP. I won three games last night!
---
This is why i dont help low levels in a workshop. Also a good team with team work can easily destory a high level team with the right builds
---
I'm not really here for a debate on wether or not a mic is better I know it's better. I'm just suggesting a ping system which makes overall cooperation (mic or no mic) better.
---
It scales to whoever goes through the area first. Soon enough you'll be upset that the white spring  ghouls are spawning a too low a level!
---
You're right. If the team inviting you is holding a workshop and you join them, it flags you for PvP too even if you have pacifist mode on. Then, one of their buddies not on the team can come kill you.
---
Yes you can place camps in NW.
---
A lot of people who are saying it’s good didn’t pay 60$ and play it at launch though
---
critical thinking has been shown to be extremely difficult to teach, some even say its unteachable and just an innate characteristic such as prone to being obese,homosexuality, etc.  We just don't get to choose our base line SPECIAL stats and perks when we're born all we can do is work with what we have and improve a little bit here and there. I work IT help desk and on a daily I help Highly educated people solve really simple problems. often they're not problems I have been exposed to already I literally have to just figure it out using my highly uneducated critical thinking skills. The most ironic incidences are situations where people with MIBs and 6 digit salaries need help replacing mouse batteries and crap. and yeah I run into that more often than you would think.
---
Same here, having a very good time during this free week. I am playing on laptop with 7700hq and 1050ti with no crashes. FPS 45-50 on medium - high(custom)
---
NO NPCS! Fucking morons, NPC - Non Playable Character, where does it state that they have to be of human origin or race ? Nowhere! If we lead by this example, Destiny 2 has only a few NPC's cause they're alien, or in WoW when you play in horde, nobody complained about the lack of humans there. Not to mention I have no knowledge of any game with questgiving NPC's where dialog has significant influence on the game world like singleplayer games sometimes tend to do.
---
Sure, F76 isn't great, I'd say it's not even good especially at the start, but it's nowhere that bad. They didn't deliver on the promises Todd has made, but most of peoples complains are just straight out BS.
---
The help emoji will let your team know you are about to get destroyed
---
to be fair, as some one who fought tooth and nail for this game and defended it for some time to a lot of my friends, the game was rushed out the door and in the beginning it was a cluster! YOu could spend 30+ mins fighting the SB Queen and waste countless stims and untold amounts of ammo and then she'd just simply disappear and not because you ran out of time, no she'd just be gone in the middle of fighting. Or if you did kill her, there was a decent chance you'd get no real loot, again after spending a ton of time and resources to bring her down. A lot of the early criticisms were valid and real. Has the game come a decent way, sure. But not many have re-reviewed it since and that's mostly because other games have come a long. Nevertheless the early outrage was well deserved.   
---
Glad you checked it out and are enjoying it. I will be coming back to it after the next few updates and maybe a few more QoL features =D
---
Higher level players can def be pretty chill, they just usually get jaded at some point after so much play time, and will do just about anything to entertain themselves. On a good note tho, Welcome to Fallout, enjoy the waste my friend!
---
I just want the level 15 PA skin
---
Cm Ms when mk kids go is same we it
---
Because Beth did not foresee that some people will be trying to use every single exploit to crash the server. Block multiple CAMP placements and we're fine.
---
Oh trust me most of us loved it to begin with, I played it everyday for a month with 3 of my friends when it came out. It just got to a point where there was nothing to do, the bugs got annoying and relentless, starting over and doing the “good” quests was a chore, dupers and cheaters were rampant. It’s a great game to play it just doesn’t have longevity.
---
SPECIAL only effects the cards you can equip, nothing else.
---
February
---
All audio? Or just chat audio?
---
I'm curious what people's builds are, are you all investing in agility so you can have a high pool? If your action points are running out fast and you have a low agility that's why. They don't need to buff action points for you, you need to invest in agility points.
---
Glad to hear it! i too love this game, but have gotten pretty bored and gave it up few weeks ago.
---
I played Metro Exodus, and had a few Blues screens on PS4, and the game was sooo linear.  it made me appreciate FO76 even more. The devs are pumping out so much content for everyone to enjoy.  So far no other game since last Nov. has given me so much joy.  Im in about 1200 hrs, but Metro made me jump back in, an I know Ill get reignited again.
---
I too still wave :)
---
Yeah that was the failing my arms part of my post dawg.
---
Are you playing on a console or PC?
---
I'm surprised I haven't found any discussion on the control scheme for PC when it comes to menus and inventory management.  I want to play this on PC, but the menus and item management are atrocious.  I don't want to have to plug in a controller to have an enjoyable experience outside of running around the map.  I'm definitely enjoying the gameplay, but my god every time I have to go into the menus to do anything it's like getting my knuckles slapped with a ruler.
---
Oh. Gotcha
---
Nice tip about taking the fusion cores. And the mines. Though I've not come across any yet.
---
Also the don't loot everything. That's what I was doing. Picking up stuff I couldn't use, overburdening myself and denying my team-mates materials. I'm far more selective now.
---
All rewards I saw are over level progression. I was hoping for some winning rewards but nope.
---
Wait... what? Really?
---
That’s what happens when you mindlessly listen to what people say without taking the time to think about it for yourself.
---
Welcome aboard, better late than never.
---
I couldn't agree more they are highly noticeable wherein paper bags blend in everywhere.
---
Uh huh gdtu
---
Their own fault for releasing a shitty game and waiting too long to make any real fixes
---
How I kind of felt the past two days. Not a BR guy but I'm not going to hate on it because it does look pretty fun from what I've been watching. Just not for me as I suck pretty bad at those games. But normal adventure mode is now all the trial players with the spattering of higher level guys. I have also been getting plagued with disconnects after short periods of time too so that isn't helping me neither. Not sure if the disconnects have to do with the influx of new players but its a pretty huge coincidence. Not going to leave the game because I really want to know what this legendary player stuff is all about and definitely for wastlanders in the fall. I think E3 ruined it for me by showing what wastlanders was going to be because I wanted it right now but have to wait through the summer first. Just going to tough it out until then. Started a new guy just so I can have it leveled up and then can pick a different side on either character when the time comes to see who's the better side.
---
Not really I found this just by accident when I misplaced my camp and replaced it correctly. That is when I noticed it. Wasn't even trying to exploit. Just place my camp properly.
---
on pc.. never been able to hear voice chat.. never bothered me until winter came out...
---
I don't plan on trying solo anytime soon. I didn't think I'd like playing in a team. Turns out I really do.
---
This is also solved by staying on Discord for PC and Parties for console
---
I have a theory that a company could do really well hiring gamers. not the mainstream battle royal type  gamers especially but from games involving more complex puzzles / strategies. those player bases literally solve problems and think outside the box as a hobby.
---
Problem is that if you teach them that they will never be able to launch nukes. The nuke-keycards are inside locked government drone-boxes that says "steal" when you open and loot from them.
---
Not quite anything - its impossible to solo the impostor, I don't see how you can even hold a single conduit as bloodied.  The radiation aura from the SBQ is also pretty hard to deal with.
---
I feel ya, seems like there is a "before NPC  in-game announcement" and "after" era on this sub, and its funny to see how quickly it snowballs and people get on board the hate/love train.
---
Alas, there was always fanboyism around, now that people are happy because they think the NPC expansion will make this a proper FO title everyone is just redeeming the game, which I think is ridiculous after all the corporate/money grabbing tactics bethesda has tried on the last months - completely inexcusable. 
---
We need to pass on the message that you may fix the product but the downfalls are not forgiven and there will always be consequences if you try to BS us with shady money grabbing tactics.
---
Well, actually, you always had the option to “relog” onto a server where your camp exists. The newer prompt to stay or keep searching just makes it a bit simpler.
---
Take over a workshop then blueprint structures there, no need to do it at CAMP. ;)
---
It is a dumpster fire, but I love playing with my friends because it's so fun to play with them
---
Yeah, my main guy looks fine in the creator but then in-game his nose looks too big and he looks derpy-eyed
---
Frame at 28, Enclave power armor paint at level 29, icon at level 30.
---
Most likely, hopefully some stay. Those who really, really like it. Making the community all that better.
---
Just as a side idea.
---
Run the game from the .exe file not the launcher, as administrator, aka right click the .exe and select run as admin. See if the problem is still there.
---
Without the severe backlash they experienced the game would still be horrible and not worth anything. 
---
Seriously I bought a game at launch and all it did was crash and bug out every 5 minutes. Im so glad they dedicated themselves to fixing it because now its almost worth the money and it is rather enjoyable to play.
---
Get to OS rank 10 and leave the minority
---
Yes, some things in life can be challenging. Most often it's still worth it and again, I know many people would still be interested in that.
---
Are you a console user?  If you are, I hope one day your FO76 is blessed with mods.
---
That's happened to me a couple times since 9.5.  
---
Also saw it a Monday night @ Morgantown. 
---
Server hop fixed it.
---
The other kit that isn’t from the atom store is the improved repair kit and you get them from the scorchbeast Queen
---
Sell it to someone
---
Yeah, but some of them painted themselves blue, so it's kind of a wash...
---
They're two distinct weapons, and each weapon skin so far has been specifically for one type of tool. It's kind of like the difference between the .44 revolver and the western revolver
---
Agreed entirely on the content rollout for sure.  Hopefully you're right and it follows up after the current roadmap. 
---
When console users gain the ability to use Mods of their choosing it'll bring a smile to my face.  Mods for everyone!
---
I did your whole process again with GeForce uninstalled and running with admin worked!! Thankyou so much!
---
So you're not wrong here, but you're still coming off as kind of an ass.  Especially if you're purposefully continuing to crash servers in order to scum XP somehow.  But clear whether you're actually doing that or not, but... Please don't?
---
Best leveling Route imo. Start at the ammo factory and walk your way to watoga using the Main road through the mire.
---
Not a bug. I think there might even be a setting to change it to how you want.
---
I'm on PS4, but regularly the setting for audio chat goes bonkers and it turns the volume all the way down. I just have to turn it back up. Not sure if that's in any way applicable, but i know it happens regularly on PS4.
---
There was something in the patch notes about the SBQ trophy but I haven't found that one yet.
---
Arktos pharma is underrated
---
Well it sounds like you don't play survival and just believe the shit people say on here.
---
Survival is just the base fallout experience but with no limits. It doesn't need rebalancing it doesn't need an overhaul. It's just adventure mode with no restrictions. And that's all it needs to be.
---
All audio. The entire system goes mute! No Xbox sounds or anything! It's bizarre, honestly. At first I thought it was the HDMI cable so I used a new one. Then, maybe it's the outlet, so I switch it over to a new one. Well, shit. Maybe it's the TV?! That turns out untrue as my Chromecast produced audio just fine. At this point I'm rebooting the Xbox and that seemed to fix it! Until it didn't. I tried flipping through the audio settings but that just fixed it for a few seconds. Even tried going into my system audio settings to no avail. Why!? 😭😭😭
---
My personal thoughts - Survival mode should be like early game PvP with no Pacifist.  Slap damage should be harsher, resources in the open world much more scarce, and all parts of the map can spawn high level enemies.  Take away the focus from senseless PvP and make it a threat, but the focus should be on a much more hardcore PvE survival world.  Needless to say, new characters should be a must, and I would suggest no item trading...  you have to earn/find your own stuffs (pretty much nullifies duping).
---
I run Bloody PA Heavy Gunner, I without a doubt grab one conduit after popping a med ex, it’s easy to stim pack the damage as you have like 650 ER.  To grab a second one I need a lot of adds and just tank it with a VE 50 cal.  I haven’t been successful grabbing all three as a bloody build yet.
---
No prob. Happy to help. Have fun in the game
---
Scrap and learn plan.
---
No
---
I play console for online games because PC is just hacks on ALL online games. There was a video DAY 1 of a hit using auto aim and xray vision in the new battle royal made. I do have a pretty good PC that I play single player games on with mods. Btw, Fo76 doesnt officially allow mods, yall are just breaking ToS. 
---
Anyway you are missing the point. It wouldn't be worth it for Bethesda.
---
Most likely cause is: you are running an outdated sorting mod.
---
Possible but less likely: your localisation ba2 file is corrupt or outdated.
---
Just FYI, setting the file to read only hasn't been effective for me.  I use it to set the main menu music to off, and set the file to read only.  It only takes a bit before the music is back and the file isn't read only any more.
---
Might not be a problem for setting screen resolution, but it's something to be aware of.
---
A fair few times I encounter this is when I leave party chat. But it does occasionally happen if I plug a charger into my headset or disconnect my controller from my headset.
---
Yup!!
---
I agree...but there should be an option to quick-load to cut that time down to 1 minute for people who know how to place perks and arent interested in punching ppl.
---
When you level below level 51 you pick a SPECIAL point and then pick a perk card.
---
You don't have to pick a perk card in the point where you got the SPECIAL point. So you could level, put a point in Strength, and then pick a perk card in Perception if that's what you wanted.
---
Nothing is permanent, you can choose to move SPECIAL points around when you get past 50 instead of choosing more perk cards.
---
You might be talking about game chat but it definitely doesnt happen in party chat.
---
I hope this suffices :)
---
I don't, I'm just making this as public as possible to force Bethesda to fix it. Because I bug hunt for fun and report them yet when I don't make them public Bethesda doesn't fix them. Which is why I publicized this and dupes they refuse to fix. Such as the server crash rollback dupe that is still in the game that I've been reporting since patch 7.
---
I enjoyed it when it launched, really was a unique experience. But in all honesty the constant barrage of abuse toward the game around launch ended up putting me off, and so I stopped. Might head back in soon
---
i would like to hear your opinion about 1 or 2 months later, when you have fully explored the game and all iy has to offer. i, too, didnt see why all the hate was put in it, until i played enough to be frustrated by the game systems they put into place.
---
Seen one guy with it how do u get it? I'm lvl 21 in br and don't have it yet. Won many games 2.
---
Different bug, sometimes mousing over the other window a couple times helps.  But not 100% of the time, sometimes it takes a few tries before it sticks to being 'normal'.
---
You do you, buddy!  Always do what you enjoy. As you say, it is nice that there is something new cool for those that like it, but the classic adventure mode will always be great for adventure and some exploring.
---
what a collection of lovely art works.
---
Wait you can do all that while waiting?! Damn..  i mean im only lvl 2 or 3 but still. I guess my punching days are over.
---
Level 5 in the bog!? That place is tough!
---
When I leave party chat game chat dosent work.
---
Plenty of people keep trying and they're always the first to go. At least half the matches I've done onr player has spawned away from the group and proved me right.
---
Juicehead is still riding the wave, he has seen a positive uptick in the game's public opinion and has started to slowly move towards that. That's my issue with him. He used to be a huge Fallout creator and now it feels like he is trying to find out what his audience wants him to say rather than what he actually thinks, which could be far better for both him and the series.
---
Happens other times too.  I have had the same camp for weeks, and I randomly list all the listings in my vendors.
---
Haven't set them back up yet either, too much of a pain.
---
saw somebody at 28.
---
I really hope I didn't screw my SPECIAL stats up.  Ugh.  So when I hit triangle after a levelup to goto the perk screen it never takes me to my SPECIAL stats.  I wonder if I never assigned any of the points I've gotten for my first few level ups and have just been selecting cards..do I goto the SPECIAL screen to select the stats?  Also, thank you for the answer.
---
The problem with Survival is that the top guys have completed Adventure and got all the best gear and there is nothing else for the to do except Survival mode.
---
My suggestion would be to overhaul as follows:
---
* Everyone can choose whichever train station to spawn at.
---
* Immune and invisible for first 90seconds
---
* nobody shows on the map unless they fire without a silencer
---
* People all start at level 1 with very limited items (10mm pistol, 100ammo, 3 stim, 3 cans of dog food, 1 radaway, 1 radX)
---
* XP is boosted by 1000% (one-thousand) to help level up during game play
---
* when you die, you only drop your weapon and armor (this prevents campers from hoarding food/water/radaway etc.)
---
That's what I was thinking! But I removed them and repaired and still had the issue :/
---
It´s a bummer since I bought that skin solely for the fact that one can´t lock items in inventory unless it has atom shop paint on it. I have to be super carefull every time when I manage my inventory not to accidentally drop or scrap to scrip my top tier guns and armors.
---
Never judge a book by it's cover amirite? I play since 2-3 weeks afterlaunch and had many issues like bugs, Server instability and the game crashes.. So some of the negativity is.... Was truly deserved. 
---
But they actually added content, fixed a Lot of issues and upped Server stability by a Lot and it's now a decent game. 
---
Not perfect, But absolutely enjoyable.
---
And the Best thing is the community ingame and on the web is really nice ! Had only 3 instances of running into Idiots, and thats with around 350 hours in and lvl 180. 
---
Way less then i experienced in other games. If you ever need help with anything, dont hesitate to ask here for help!
---
"Thank you Nate, but our Shaun is in another Commonwealth..."
---
have a look at the damage o/p compared to single shots. way lower.
---
all the auto's use a rediculious amount of ammo,and most will miss after the 2nd round. swings and roundabouts.
---
Remember that you cant have mods if you want to play nuclear winter. But yea, the lighting is an ongoing issue since beta, most noticably in the swamp region.
---
it had a rough launch, but they aggressively attacked bugs and started adding content, bringing what already was a dope concept to be an awesome game. nobody wants to hear the latter part though. "fuck fallout 76" is the hot phrase rn. it gets you clicks on youtube, clicks on your shitty blog, upvotes on r/Fallout etc. anything positive about the game that isn't here is met with ignorance and shit talking, mainly from people who have either never played, or played for some hours around launch.
---
it's nice that people are finally giving it a real shot though. im sure the trial deal helps. if you ain't know, you get half off of 76 ("from participating retailers") if you participate in the free trial.
---
Survival needs to make a decision:  does it want to be a PvP mode, or a more challenging mode in general that introduces stress and uncertainty to player interactions?
---
Source? Not doubting, just curious.
---
Good to know - my normal armor doesn't have that much ER, maybe like half, so I don't tend to grab conduits.  I feel like I have to give up on bloodied unarmed for the imposter... I'll just jump into a PA suit for queen fights since its just easier, and switch to 2H melee.
---
There is a slight lack of content right now, but that is very quickly changing. A lot of online games go through this phase where players get to the end game and don't have anything to do, but in time Bethesda will be adding new content for end game players to enjoy. 
---
I usually spend my time Scavenging ammo for my automatic build in between killing the scorchbeast queen and doing project Paradise.
---
Fuck Juicehead? He's been making well made and very pro 76 videos for months. It's the main game he plays and covers and nearly always good. He admits faults with the game and will show them but he constantly says how much he likes the game. He is also one of the only 76 YouTubers and refuses to show cheats even just as news as he doesn't want them to be spread (though he did cover some originally)
---
Okay, I can't think of how your CAMP might be useful in V51 mode, given the time and that you got to be mobile.
---
I would imagine this won't be in the final release.
---
ZAX is such a nice guy. I feel that if he and the Arktos biodome-computer were to have child it would become GlaDOS from Portal.
---
Yeah seeing a steady stream of new players from vault 76 to Flatwoods on every server, really cool!
---
Player vending is down for sure, the two servers I was on had 2-3 player vendors and I was one of them.  I think it's a combination of new players and old players really enjoying NW right now.  Excited for the future of this game even more than I was before NW and free trial!!!
---
Yep all programs do that now a days. Before you start not all programs do that but steam/twitch hell Photoshop too
---
Just manual close them.
---
I’ve seen a couple build normally they leave the roof open and I drop grenades in. Honestly I see the build kits used more especially at the end
---
yep, and if you are SOLO, just take the ammo to prevent others from getting good weapons. I.E take the 5mm and .50 to stop the gattling gun and .50cal being used :)
---
It took a lot of patience as a community and a lot of hard work from the devs. But I'm beyond thrilled that  people who avoided it at first are beginning to actually enjoy the game.
---
In 76 or in general? Because in general it’s great..I have a CAT5 cable running to a modem and then Ethernet running to my console, its not really known for dropping connection.
---
I used to like his stuff, I’d always take his opinion with a grain of salt though. He would often exaggerate how bad games were to act more “angry”.  Something changed a few years back though, between the bandwagon opinions and the cringeworthy skits, I had to stop watching.
---
And the account and the email address linked to the account.
---
In fact let's not sugarcoat this, (((They))) know.
---
And now (((They))) know that you know that (((They))) know.
---
And (((They))) are coming for you, right now.
---
RUN!
---
The game needs the text chat, definitely.  
---
I don't understand a MMO game without a text chat.  
---
Even HOTS and LOL have chat system.
---
This needs to be upvoted for the sole purpose of clearing the feeds. I dont mind helping someone out with info, I just dont have the time to do it 15 times.
---
Whats the bonus damage? You can stack adrineal much much faster manualy
---
once you get enough gear..its currently better to hide...they will probably fix this, and give more XP for killing since its much harder than hiding...also, a penalty for not moving perhaps?
---
"500 atoms have been deposited into your account for this post"
---
Haha, exactly, those are literally the only two enemies I couldn’t solo. The other hardest creatures to kill are the alphas in Arktos and I’ve got those downed using a cryolator first, then my unstoppable monster. Sheepsquatch is a 2 hit kill, scorchbeasts go down easily too. And everything below those is a one hit kill.
---
Aimbots and most cheats have nothing to do with official mod support, you are missing that point.  Anyone on a PC can use that without modding game files.
---
It's good to see that you main point is looking out for Bethesda's interests.
---
Uh because they are copying fortenite which has building in it as well. The reason to have blueprints camps is because you can set up a defensive base with turrets(when you find them) and defensive space to use for cover.
---
Taking out building would pretty much cripple a BR.
---
Although you cannot move points until L50, you can freely swap out perks any time, as you need that particular skill
---
For example, you only need luck: superduper when crafting, and only need luck: bloody mess when fighting, so equip /unequip as appropriate.  
---
Many Intelligence perks only benefit crafting, so useful, but dont need to be equipped full time, same with ammosmith, hardbargain, and a few others.
---
&gt;Countless people complained about the fact that it wasn't just Fallout 5
---
this was the main driving force behind the hate. the game has had an uphill battle since reveal because people didn't like what they heard. obviously the bugs and controversy fueled the flame, but the hate train started strong as soon as they said "completely online."
---
i remember how blown away and excited I was after watching the live reveal. I hopped on reddit to bond with like-minded gamers, and all i could find were threads shitting on the game and Bethesda, not even an hour after reveal.
---
You dont have to let go of "w", a side step with a or d also cancels sprint.
---
Way more than needed but thanks
---
I was thinking it could be a constantly expanding list that can be edited by anyone which means one person doesn’t have to do all the work and it can be updated as people reach new high ranks
---
So will I, but I'm not buying anything from them until 6 months after launch day. I didn't start playing '76 until last month.
---
Its pretty fun. I've been wishing for a legendary free server for a while to find out how good i am for a while.  Needless to say i need some work....
---
And i was already trying lean away from vats... but this is making me want to quit it cold turkey
---
Anyone who thinks a game is good is a SHILL!
---
Come on, man.
---
For the BR mode you mean?
---
The free to play argument happened months ago and let’s just say everyone said no except a few throwaway accounts
---
then back to wasteland after a week
---
Well, according to the lore the firestorm is caused by the SeventySixers, which means this most likely takes place further in the future than we might realize. What we see in our NW-matches might be the end of Appalachia weeks, months,  years or even decades from now.
---
As in they are only doing BR, or they stopped altogether?
---
I was not interested in a Battle Royale.
---
I played it.
---
I'm still not interested.
---
But Bethesda decided to lock certain items behind the Battle Royale so they've kinda forced me to play it even though I don't want to.
---
Just because people are playing it, doesn't necessarily mean they're enjoying it. It's still early.
---
I am glad you are enjoying it. To be fair - the no crashes, no major issues part would not have been your experience if you had bought at launch. I am aware the game seems to be stable now but cant get over the hump of the constant issues I had when I did play at startup. Hope you enjoy the game though!
---
These social media divas are all going for drama and views these days.  Been this way ever since they figured out that people click on drama.
---
It's now fake news also.
---
I confirmed it last night, this is absolutely happening to me.
---
Have you only been playing the Nuclear Winter mode? You have to be in one of the regular play modes to assign SPECIAL points through your Pipboy. I'd recommend Adventure to do this. 
---
The first step of level up it has you pick a stat to increase, then pick a perk card - usually it offers you cards for the perk you increased, but you can change to another to pick a card for a different stat. If you have a card pack available, I think it asks if you want to open that before going through the level up steps.
---
Past tense is the key, it did suck. Now it's significantly improved and looking really promising
---
Disease Cure*
---
Found juice heads alt account.
---
There is no solo mode...choosing not to fill teams means you're opting to play alone against other teams
---
I still have a couple disease cure left, I'll be fine.
---
Why would I not care about Betheada"s interest? That's how this whole thing works dude. They make a game in the hopes of making a certain profit. If there isnt enough profit then they it isnt worth it. If they dont make profit they dont make more great games. I dont understand your point of view at all.
---
I think part of it maybe was what I experienced in that I had FO76 on my external HDD instead of the internal one on my PS4.  Ran horribly.  Moved it to the internal drive and I have had very little issues at all.  My camp still takes a second or two to spawn but other than that, it works so well.  The wife and I play together (2 PS4s in the house) and we have such a blast (and she's better at it than I am).  
---
I love FO76.
---
You misunderstand. Mr Matty Plays has sucked the dick of every single Bethesda game in recent years. You can like a game, or games, but no game is perfect. If you're gonna talk about the good, you must also talk about the bad. Be unbiased. Mr Matty Plays (usually) is not unbiased.
---
I think that might be the funniest glitch I've ever seen
---
I believe that’s what the “free trail” is for. They got so much backlash at the b.e.t.a. That they can’t name it that again. This is, in lay mans terms, a beta. 
---
They are testing the servers. They are testing the gameplay balance, all while giving people a taste of the game. They are also testing 52 manned content. They are testing public response from new perk cards, smaller maps, etc. 
---
I think the test is a success and this beta or “free trail” will help the game immensely
---
Lootboxes? No.
---
If you want that kind of sh... EA is that way.
---
To be fair, the reviews were right when this game first launched. I still played it, I still enjoyed it but it was not a good game. Now with the Wild Appalachia stuff and Nuclear Winter/Wastelanders on the horizon, we're headed in the right direction to becoming a great game.
---
Also, you can get help shooting the targets, and you don't have to stay in the "shooting" area. 
---
My hands are in bad shape and the onstacle course was challenging. Dump as much junk into your stash as you can before trying it and take something like a psychobuff and some whiskey before starting. Or something that boosts your action points.
---
Speaking of PC only features - could we PLEASE get the option to enter quantities and price with the keyboard instead of dialing it in?
---
Thanks! I ended up just going online and getting it from the Bethesda site which directed me to the right page on the PS store
---
If anyone could edit the list then it would list be something like "level 100, N-word" over and over because of trolls
---
In my opinion first person gives a better POV to play with, but hats just me.
---
Probably the most accurate description of him I've ever seen.
---
I never had any expectation of you understanding my point after your first comment.
---
If you are on PC, you have disabled all your mods (troubleshooting with mods on just makes things murkier), scanned and repaired your files and still get the error there is a slim change that the vanilla localisation files are messed up.
---
Least likely I would say becuase I haven't seen any other reports of this - not that one can see anything over the endless NW spam - since the patch rolled out.
---
&gt;As a Youtuber
---
Who the fuck talks like this?
---
I'm playing the free trial week and really enjoying it. Although now I'm not going to be able to play for the rest of the week really, so I'll miss out on the trial.
---
Gotta try things for yourself to know these days.  It's nothing new that a few popular critics (mostly on Youtube in modern times) can influence people into forming their opinion ignorantly.  However with the immediate nature of the internet, people are more and more inclined to pile on a popular reviewers' opinion in search of attention and instant gratification.
---
OK I may not have screwed up too bad.  I am doing a gunslinger build and have picked mostly if not all Agility cards which I plan on maxing anyways.  I haven't even tried Nuclear Winter yet as I am more an adventure kind of guy.  I got to the farm bots and did that quest with some guys I ran into last night.  I opened a pack as well.  I need to check when I get home tonight and see where the stat points went.  I was just sucked in last night and didn't stop to look things up online like I normally would.  Such a fun game.  Was amazing running into those guys last night as there was a level 15 legendary to take down which I definitely wouldn't have been able to do alone.
---
And perk cards, specifically the ones that boost damage, those are the biggest disruptors to PVP right now. I think damage boosts should be limited too weapon mods ( which can emphasize crafting more) and instead let perk cards focus on customizing your playstyle. 
---
Basically any damage perk cards in some form are going to be necessary for anybody, and in my opinion, any perks that players consider standard should be incorporated as features in other ways. 
---
However, I'll admit it might just be that melee needs to only be affected by either perk cards or the strength stat, but not both. Other weapons simply do not have that advantage and will always be underpowered as a result.
---
I guess we're getting what I asked for. ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ
---
The ap cost of sprinting could easily be reduced by 50-75% instead. Or if you wanted to make go about it by increasing AP, you could increase the AP cost of perks that use AP like dodge by the same amount that you increased AP by. Say you tripled AP, triple dodge AP cost.
---
You can add gunplay among other things. The gunplay is atrocious for this.
---
Before complaining that something doesn't work as you expect, maybe you should check that it isn't actually working as intended?
---
There is no solo mode, just a LFG/Team Auto-fill option.
---
Nice! I wish I had more time to play to get there faster myself.
---
Also wish I wasn't such a crappy shot
---
Lol. Ok dude. Someone who thinks a company should spend a ton of money making something without getting any profit from it just for thier own personal entertainment is obviously very detached from reality. Have a good one.
---
I see, I hope so. It's only a bummer that if that is the intention that it disturbs the normal gameplay. I'm in the Adventure mode, just trying to do my thing. Wouldn't it be better to have separate servers for this purpose if they haven't already?
---
Well, that sucks. I uinstalled apex because of that
---
I didn't even know there were 3 sprinting perks.
---
Waiting outside the vault may not be the best way to do it. I have made more friends from random encounters doing the same events or quests.
---
Hell yes, we need this. 
---
I had a player take over a powerplant I had just spent an hour on the event setting it up.
---
We got into a pvp fight and he was shouting abuse at me through the Mic.
---
I had to find one, plug it in and go back and talk to him.
---
If we had text chat we could have sorted it out right then. After I talked to him he was fine and let me have the place
---
It's not a toggle though.  If it was a toggle, tapping shift while not walking would mean that the next time you start walking, it would be a sprint.
---
Yes leaving the roof open is a bad idea (and such as easy fix,) just like putting shutters on the bottom floor allows enemies to open them and shoot into the base.
---
How? You can’t look around corners and shit without making yourself shown. 
---
But you do you man, this game is all for the freedom of playing how you want to play and that’s why I love it.
---
I'd love to know that setting!
---
and then stop, collaborate, and listen
---
You can run both...
---
I found a brief case and 1 code a teammate dropped me 3 more codes, I then waited till the circle was small enough and bam wiped everyone and then my team died from radiation. Andddd a dude in power armor won.
---
Those exist in battle royal and it still seems balanced to me. It makes sense. You level up... you get stronger.
---
Naiv answer of someone that, and thats just an assumption, buys EA games on mass. Youre used to pay for Stuff thats bs,  but WE dont. Might be the age....might be that WE care bout our money. Either way ppl like you are the reason the market gets flooded by crappy games that will never be complete and the reason games like FO76 get released in an alpha state
---
if it ends up being engaging and remarkable then its great. if not it all feels pointless for me.
---
Understand. Thank you
---
aah the sociologists are still in debate about all that and I do not have a full belief in that standard. but it is a time worn and studied behavior with merit. and yes you are correct.
---
 " and yes I am an alpha. I am rich, I have mated and created life,I have went to war..and now I am on the declining portion of my lifespan surrounded by a world full of noobs. "
---
that does come off as tweeb douche. but by base standards I do fall into that category and it was written in response to him displaying defined beta characteristics. whether you believe or don't believe or feel sad is no concern of mine.  alphas do not concern themselves with the squawking of triggered betas. hang on checking....yup no concern so I must be alpha.
---
TBF online launches are always rough.  GTA Online, Diablo 3, WoW. 
---
People have held this game to an unrealistic single player standard since it announced at E3 last year.
---
Exactly that's why I posted again. Every time I play with randoms someone always says "I love this game mode but the only complaint I have is that you cant team with friends" and I'm like ok... here we go again lol
---
That may work, and thanks for the info; but letting go of [Shift] should stop the sprint, like it does in every other game.
---
Yes, but they have been changed you can only equip a certain amount
---
Edit: and most people simply don't have any damage perk cards to use in the Battle Royale mode right now.
---
It all depends on your specific experience. I attribute it to the Sonic 2006 syndrome which got beat down for bugs, crashes and all sorts of stuff. I played through the entire game through all characters and never once encountered a single bug, glitch or performance issue. But I do understand that it wasn't a perfect game and that enough people experienced bugs that it gave them a horrible or mediocre experience, but I didn't attribute that in my review because it never happened to me, giving me a better experience than another player who might have had more.
---
Though in this day and age, Bandwagon Bug Groups are pretty popular to the point where it's something like "Well, this glitch/bug/issue happens so much to so many people, I might as well say I have it too even though I never experienced it or mention it as a negative even though it wasn't my experience."
---
Obviously there's a lot to be said with the launch and how they have handled quite a few things, but people jumped HARD on the burn Bethesda at the stake bandwagon and jumped all over it like they committed an atrocious sin worse than some of the worst crimes ever committed in recent-ish history
---
It wasn't AS BAD as a lot of people made it out to be when it first launched. Hyperbole and emotionally charged reviews are also to be expected however when it's something like this and it gets the launch and after-launch that it did.
---
Experience's will always be subjective, if you wanna try it, give it a go, or hell, go to a rental website or if you have a local place and try it on a console or at a friend's house or something. Nowadays far more often than not experience's are becoming a blanketed opinion, and people are grabbing them up and creating their own opinions and formulating "Fake" playtime, even though they have never actually touched the game.
---
tl;dr Popular opinions rule, bandwagons, experience will always be subjective. Play it yourself before you decide that it sucks, especially if you've never even touched the game before.
---
I just started and I am going to go and buy the game tomorrow, loving it so far
---
after a year of bug fixing and content updates yes the game is a lot better. If you were here at the beginning you'd see how much had to be changed to get it in a workable state.
---
Are you sure they were shooting *at* you?  When dropping a paper bag full of goodies, a lot of people will shoot at it in an attempt to draw your attention to the bag.  I prefer to flash my light on and off at the bag to avoid just this type of misinterpretation.
---
This post certainly had a point.
---
Nope. They literally have 9 point damage cards. I have one. Its exactly the same but instead of needing 3 cards to get the damage you only need 1.
---
why because you paid and it wouldn't be fair? o-o I paid 80$ and would still like this to be ftp
---
Well this is the point really, it gives peopke a chance to try the game without hsving to put any money into it, which will undo all the hard wotk the youtubers and r/fallout guys have put in to turn people away from this game
---
We need a map of all terminals and locked containers
---
Let's not and say we didn't.
---
Don't tell them that, I've won so many games from people just running right by me.
---
if someone gave it to you, then it IS in the game. the object and artwork was already on your system.
---
does it protect your head ?.............havent yet found anything else that does apart from p/a
---
There's a similar firebreather  quest that's an obstacle course.  My hint on that would be to clear it of enemies before you run it.
---
Sorry
---
You all 180 you fucking twats, all of you on this cancerous subreddit. You were all shitting on it and look at you now, jumping on the bandwagon.
---
Freeing up that many points might actually just be better oh, that was really the underlying issue was just how many points you had to dedicate to it lol
---
You also can’t wear the helmet if you’re wearing anything else on your head (mysterious veil, glasses, etc)
---
Co Opting another idea and making a brining a fallout game somewhat back to its roots isn't really a turn around. More like they put out the fire, but the smoldering husk is what we have.
---
Have you ever played competitive Halo or COD? 
---
It doesn't matter if I put three shots on someone's face, if my teammate get's that last fourth shot they get the kill. I get an assist. It's a team game it's not important who did what. The only thing that matters is who got the W. That's it. Dude, also this is a sneak peak sort of beta. There's gonna be a lot of adjustments. The best thing to do here is just move on and stop being salty. It's not a race man just have fun. You sound pretty young so I'm trying to be nice.
---
This game, like every video game, like every form of entertainment, is 100% subjective. Fuck what ratings it was given, or what some Youtuber said. It doesnt matter what the graphics are like, how old the game is, or what type of game it is. Play what your interested in. Enjoy yourself. Life is too short to waste time worrying what other people rate a game as.
---
Myself, Im having a blasty blast in fo76. Glad you took the plunge and tried it out OP. Hope to see you in the wasteland!
---
Servers cost money and honestly if they have to build and house new servers for every game mode this game will go no where fast. It’s too costly for a free addition to the game. 
---
They are doing this right. Stressing the servers they have, and finding ways to optimize it them to run all the content. I’ve seen issues too but like I said they are looking for these issues and will fix them hopefully.
---
Yes, please.
---
Gods this made me laugh. 
---
It is so damn true though!
---
Just get all the stealth perks and commando perks whenever you can
---
Did you make this yourself? How in the world do you have this after 2 days?
---
On PS4, a couple months ago if you were in Auto you could hear both area and teammates. Then it was broken to where you had to flip through a bunch of times and mess with settings in order to get it to work. Now if you're an auto, you can only talk to your team but you can hear the people in area. You won't be able to talk to him in area. I wish it would go back to the way it was in the beginning or Auto meant you can talk to everybody
---
Would be nice if you had a tour type of attire for this or given something your efforts by Bethesda.
---
I take it your on pc ?
---
Pretty smart, great job!
---
100% chance to learn the plan when scrapping it. Scrap it, learn the plan, sell them in your vending machine.
---
Shouldn’t be. It’s supposed to be going till the 18th.
---
At lvl 12 ish is when I seen someone have it and  i beleive they were lower lvl then me aswell. I'm lvl 21 abd still don't have it. So no idea how to get it so far.
---
SPECIAL makes no real difference, it only effects some high level perk cards but ingame everyone is balanced.
---
It still requires the same amount of special points. To use a 9 point agility card you need 9 agility. The system is absolutely identical to the old except that you equip less cards overall.
---
I saw a level 4 going to Arktos Pharma, to do the event. It didn't go well
---
Yeah, shit like that is dumb at best and grossly offensive at worst. I think people forget that developers have lives outside of being a developer; imagine being a kid and seeing people sending your dad or mom death threats or other BS like that.
---
Thats.....what im talking about....it IS different
---
Well the adventure mode stats dont carry over. You have to rank up and unlock perks in the BR mode. It just depends on play style.
---
It hasn't even started, all we have is a sneak peek, so that might be the way it turns out at full release.
---
Very Bad idea since ragdolls are clientside. Its pure luck if it works.
---
&gt; Most reviewers completely overreacted to the issues.
---
The issues are still pretty glaring six months on. The game might be good now, but it's still not an 8/10.
---
Collecting junk is a necessity in this game as it’s used to upgrade your weapons, base, armor, etc. don’t sell junk. Sell gear you don’t use and ammo you don’t use.
---
Maybe try and get a legendary lvl 10 10mm smg or pipe rifle. These work well with commando if you don't want a handmade
---
&gt;It's annoying bulking items in the field then scrapping them accidentally because I picked up another item I need to scrap and I reflexively use the "scrap all" button.
---
If I recall correctly the scrap all scraps your bulked items because if it did not then when you needed to use junk that had been bulked it would be unavailable for repair or crafting.
---
The launch sucked. The end-game is getting better, but it's still grindy and boring.  
---
Today, the path to end-game is pretty damn good and getting better each patch.
---
Fans, Typewriters, Toy Cars, Toy Trucks, Giddyup Buttercup, Globes, Handcuffs, Hot Plates, Peppermills.  There's probably more items as well, but that's all I can think of off the top of my head.
---
Also, there is a consistent spawn for screws in the Charleston train station.  Unless someone else has already grabbed them, there is usually a box of loose screws sitting on top of the little table next to the weapons workbench in the back.
---
Not really. You do just as much damage with the 9 point damage card as you would we the 3 cards in the other mode. It is literally the exact same damage. The damage perk cards are equal in battle royal and adventure.
---
I love my Quad Cryolator the Imposter Sheepsquatch does not stand a chance.
---
May as well just scrap it to learn the plans for yourself. Otherwise dump it somewhere in the woods, yeah. Just don't spread it to other people
---
Got it 👌
---
Sheepsquatch?
---
whoa, i didnt even realize we could build houses too, ive only seen kits for turrets, concrete walls, and lookout posts
---
Coming from a Destiny guy, I feel you. Many of those YouTubers do no acknowledge or give the new stuff a chance. Yong and Joe especially when it comes to D1/D2 that while had screw ups, bounced back in a big way. It makes me shake my head
---
Have you played New Vegas? It's my favorite Fallout title, but holy shit is it made of bugs! And this is after Bethesda released 4 major DLCs and various patches for it. When NV was released it was notorious for game-breaking and even character-breaking bugs, some of which were never fixed. 76 was never as bugged out as New Vegas and now it's likely the most stable and bug-free of all the 3D Fallouts.
---
I just leave pacifist mode on and if they want to spend their session walking behind me attacking, let them. I am curious if Overly generous works with pacifist on. Not instigating PVP, but filling them full of rads lol
---
The launch was bad, but bethesda turned it around faster than I thought possible. 
---
Unfortunately the reviews are still garbage and people still say "76 BaD" because of launch. But right now it's as fun as hell, even more so for me because I got new internet
---
If you are in a group, yes, if not then no.
---
The number of new players, not the amount of them.   Players are countable.
---
This needs 3 sizes of no.
---
For me to know and you to find out.
---
The reward boxes are for player icon, no idea or anything about adventure mode “stash boxes” skin or crafting for CAMP
---
Server crashing was my biggest issue at first, the rest didn't bug me as much. Also I blame dupers as much as I blame Bethesda for that though. I got to where I could load into a map. watch the dots a bit spot the dupers and predict the crashes lol. that moonshiner shack man if you seen a couple dots just hanging out there that was 99% chance of server crash in minutes. Granted bethesda could and should have predicted that behavior and prevented it off the jump but the dupers should  not have taken advantage of it.
---
Pick up every piece of junk in sight and scrap it then  make a run for a stash to store it
---
Just got it solved there!
---
I just realized that I hadn't updated the strings folder which was being used to rename junk to what components were in each piece of junk, it clearly states in the mod description to reinstall after each patch.
---
Thanks for all your help!
---
I'm loving my bloodied unarmed melee build too - just really frustrating that I can't last long enough vs. the impostor and SBQ.  Non bosses don't even require all that melee prowess, they go down easily with taps from my handmade.  Its a fun build for sure!
---
They say a lot of things.
---
then please tell me how could winning this mode be rewarding? and tell me how this game can get loads of $$ so we can have laods of awesome content ??
---
Lol wtf is it with you people and your disconnects? I've been playing since the beta came out an I've only ever disconnected a handful of times, and I haven't disconnected since the last 2 updates.
---
I got a perk card yesterday that let's me deal 120+ damage to player made structures. I haven't come across anyone who's built a camp yet but I'm interested to see how it works.
---
They have been pretty active in replying to posts about NW so idk
---
Follow the railway tracks.
---
Any lookout towers you find, take a look at the view from the top.
---
Any railway stations you find, look at maps/posters on the walls.
---
Pick up everything, sell everything
---
Hit enemies and pick up their belongings
---
I understand that, however, you cannot have that perk card, say Commando, and also have fire in the hole and Grenadier equipped at the same time. That, you cannot do. Or like how I would not be able to have  both the 2.5x critical boost and the action boy perk because they are both in agility. That has a big impact on combat.
---
Unsubbed from Jimquisition because of this, Jim Sterling is a poo-poo head.
---
Same thing.  My electricity glitched for some of my lights so I scrapped the wire and it wouldnt let me build another one.  Deleted a few of my bunny plushies and nothing.  Deleted a few more and still nothing.  
---
Now I'm 6 bunny plushies short and half my lighting doesn't work.  Hope this gets fixed soon.
---
What's the story here?
---
We'll probably learn about the next wave of Survival weapon challenges in thursday's Inside the Vault post.
---
When did they kill him? I felt like he was there a couple weeks ago
---
You still have the gift emote!?! I can’t find mine. Not in the “expand” menu either!
---
Go to demos it should be there
---
You can though. Just unequipped perk cards under other trees. For example of I have no cards under luck I can put another card under agility or what ever.
---
Haven't had this happen in party chat. I don't think I have ever used the game chat, so I can't comment on that functionality.
---
Pleasure.
---
Glad that you got it sorted :)
---
Dunno, not sure where the servers are located for each region, so, guess some regions disconnect and some don't, consider yourself lucky.
---
&gt;  Sorry for the format (phone typed)
---
Op already addressed this... but you really felt the need to type it still huh?
---
I found one at the bus shelter by the motel in flatwoods
---
At your level you're not going to be pimping much of anything but at the same time... that means you won't really have a need to spend the caps you don't actually have!
---
Go out and explore Appalachia. Try out the weapons you find and see which ones you like and which you hate.  I'm personally a big fan of the Mole Miner Gauntlet for Melee and the Gauss Rifle for range (Neither of which are an option at your level) but you might like something totally different.
---
Good news is that at later levels you'll have access to Perk Cards that can cater to whatever weapons you like.
---
Best 'useful' advice I could probably give for your level right now is to join Events whenever you can. It's a great source of XP and rewards.  I know at that level I was always running low on basic stuff like Stimpaks or Purified Water.
---
Well isn't that just cheery
---
Strange should be in the trade emotes
---
Action Boy to make my AP Regen faster.  Marathoner to make sprinting cost less.  Another to give me DR while sprinting
---
Your total special carries through
---
So, you're not locked two trees, but you do have a set number and you cannot exceed it regardless of what your points are
---
Your not talking about the marine tactical helmet are you?
---
It would seem Appalachia has more creepy crawlers than I originally thought
---
^
---
I feel AP should be doubled in storm only. 
---
The storms eats you up very quickly and you can barely outrun it.
---
Other than that I could see unlimited ap making gunfights very chasey
---
Haha, yeah freestyle shooting is an art...especially using your thumbs to aim and move.
---
In NW I’ve seen it only assign one card per stat.  
---
I have a 15 STR and can only run 1 of my 2 STR cards I have.    My AGI is 9 and I can only equip  either the marathoner card or te pistol card.   Is there a trick I have discovered ?
---
Gary. Gareeeeeeee.
---
I bought the game the day before E3. I'm impressed so far. I hope that Bethesda will release the numbers for game purchases during this time period.
---
That was a really neat surprise for me. I have been slowly leveling a third character but it has been a bit of a slog since I am doing a pistol/VATs build. The fact that I can use her in NW and STILL level her up is awesome. I want to get her to 50 in NW so I can continue my journey in adventure with a good perk loadout. Really love that they give you caps and XP.
---
Yes. I have to go. Have a good one bro. Get frog legs 9 if you can. Its marsupial but a perk card
---
I would say to try and collapse any structures which are floating, that’s probably where the person is hiding to avoid grenades. Also watch for holes in roofs.
---
With Nuclear Winter listed as "sneak peek", when can we expect it to be fully released? I don't see the point on getting people hooked and then taking it away until September.
---
I'm level 175+ and these days I go to player camps to buy fun things from their vending machines like snacks and 40mm grenades. I also hang out and chat with friends and head off to most events, craft things, build camps, see how many drugs I can take, cultivate my build and tailor my playstyle around that, gear up to take down the scorchbeast queen, or just farm resources to help out lower level players. All this with a group of mates who I love. 
---
For really new players I like to find the wackiest endgame items or the weirdest clothes to show them.
---
Yup! You just put down a camp like you would in adventure mode!
---
In addition to unlocking FPS, disabling V-Sync in Fallout76Prefs.ini will generally increase FPS too. So try that out. Also disabling motion blur might help with FPS or give clearer graphics.  [https://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Fallout\_76](https://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Fallout_76) here's how to do it. It's really simple. These tricks only change default values and don't add any new code.
---
All settings on Medium, except Texture quality on Ultra, gives a good performance-quality ratio.
---
I think it's a random spawn. But I found mine in the battle training area of the military base
---
Noted.
---
you know how the main distinguishing point of pokemon is being able to collect them all and bring them all forward from games literally nearly 2 decades old?
---
well
---
according to game freak's lead manager they're basically planning to do away with that because it's 'too much work' despite the fact that they are literally the biggest media franchise on the planet
---
That would be funny
---
You too, dude
---
Also ugh, I get why people like the jumping, but I just get sick of how ridiculous all that Crouching Tiger Unreal Tournament crap looks in Fallout lol
---
Do you need certain stats for taking or what
---
I found it twice in the isolated cabin at the top of the map
---
There has been a number of posts about this. A few things got new weights assigned. Billboards and lighted signs from what I read. You may have to delete allot of things to get under budget.
---
In about 6 months I only moved my camp 3 times. Two months back I moved it and I freed a ton of budget up.
---
I have no confidence with as buggy as this game is that anything behind the scenes like perk card buffs or budget actually work correctly.  I think they may be close but using my last camp move as an example I didn't delete anything or have any special blueprints.  I move from point a to b and it recalculated allot of budget. My thinking is everytime you make something and then delete it you have a phantom amount of budget that doesn't disappear entirely and it's that budget that creeps into gameplay.
---
If you aren't tied to your location. Store everything.  Don't blueprint. Go somewhere else and rebuild. If my scenario plays out I bet you have more space.
---
The exact same thing happened to me. I think everyone is having the issue. I know they adjust C.A.M.P. limits to help with server stability, so I'm not upset. In the meantime I won't be making any drastic changes to my C.A.M.P. until it is readjusted, or I at least know what my limits truly are.
---
My suggestion to Bethesda: It would help if we knew what percentage each item takes away from our budget, similar to item weight.
---
I would say you want Luck to be the lowest, followed by Agility, then even the rest
---
If you close out the game by going out to the home menu and killing it that way, does your audio come back?  I was having this issue back during the 'beta' and that fixed it for me.
---
I downloaded the game again for the free play week, but Im still getting the same audio glitch myself.
---
[why tf would they do that?](https://youtu.be/JGvBdbNZEsY)
---
I would say it's random spawns as well but they should have a limited set of spawn points. Because no one would ever find it in a shrub in the middle of nowhere.
---
Apparently past Pokemon won't be able to be transferred and everyone is mad about it. They're doing this because of balance reasons. Basically the ultra competitive crowd with their ultra tryhard EV shit or whatever made the games broken going forward
---
Double checking the atom shop right now. Might have deactivated it on accident?
---
I feel you but in battle royale where there is no vats and no legendary weapons jumping around like an idiot is a good way to win a gun fight.
---
Burnt Book and benches, the bane of every power looter.
---
Hmmmmm....guess I misunderstood that part. Wouldn't that give high level players and advantage? I thought it was a flat rate count that spread across perk cards.
---
I mean given what I see in terms of player alive count, it seems the average life in NW is less than 5 minutes...so 5 minutes in game and 5 minutes waiting for next.
---
Yeah, like I said I get it, it just looks silly as fuck LOL
---
They ping when you're close to it.
---
The game breaker for me was the broken friends system - it was literally impossible for me and my mate to play for a full day together with out it popping up and every time it did it needed a 3rd person to help fix.
---
I still don't know what people are taking about with Fallout 76 being a "buggy mess". I've been playing it on Xbox since the Beta, and the worst I've ran acrossed were some minor visual bugs. If anything, I've encountered less bugs in 76 than the other Bethesda Fallout games I've played (3,NV,4).
---
Not surprising tbh, it's already a pain bringing stuff forward. As it stands if I wanted to get something from my soulsilver to the later games, I'd need a subscription to their poke bank AND a wifi network that's detected by their nintendo system, which none of mine ever were. And from what I heard it's a massive pain to do instead of the simple process it used to be. And back in the day I thought the pal park was excessive...
---
Why does everyone play the age card? It just proves you don’t have a valid argument so you have to insult me. I have not played Halo, and that doesn’t matter. This is Fallout, not Halo.
---
Go to billings homestead, grab some razorgrain, build 3 brahmin at a time and store them after milking attempts. Rebuild and reroll
---
I guess I’m just used to first person because that’s how I played in New Vegas.
---
Oh Lord no, not thumbs, I'm on PC.  Putting me on console turns any shooter into a stroke-survivor simulation .
---
Check to see how many turrets or food you have, they both take lots of camp budget and I haven't had any issues really and I have re arranged and replaced new items at my base.
---
Use melee weapons when you can.
---
Pick up ammo every time you see it - it adds up pretty fast. (bandolier perk to reduce weight)  By the time I hit L50, I had well over 1k of every caliber, without crafting.
---
Now I craft most of it because my anti- SB and Assaultron weapons are hungry....
---
New Vegas wasn't made by Bethesda which is why I didn't include it, however yes I do agree it was full of bugs too.
---
76 was insanely buggy at launch let's not pretend otherwise.
---
Do you have a neon billboard like the atom shop mothman billboard?
---
Or when you play the game on launch, in my experience.    I remember Elder Scrolls Online and No Man's Sky sucking some seriously grotesque ass when they launched, both are good now.
---
Yeah I got a missile launcher but I've also seen people getting power drills for a reward, so...
---
No I understand, I played first person for the other fallout games either. I don’t know why I decided to play third person, and it’s hard for me to go back.
---
&gt; The game itself was exactly as advertised, barring the bugs
---
Well the bugs were a pretty big deal. 
---
I think it's fair to say that if you release a game that isn't in beta or in pre-release that most people expect a working product, not perfect, but working for the most part. For a lot of people that played the game the weeks after launch that wasn't the case.
---
The "16 times the detail" claim doesn't exactly hold up either.
---
Regardless of what was promised, a lot of people didn't feel the game was much fun. And no that's not just because they wanted Fallout 5. The core gameplay loop has been heavily criticized as too monotone and repetitive, the interaction with other players too superficial, the quest design boring, and the gunplay unsatisfying especially with the new VATS. You can disagree on all those but to say people only hate it because they wanted Fallout 5 and didn't got it is far from the truth.
---
Ahh, I never really considered action boy/girl a sprint perk card, but I guess here it mostly is due to not using AP for much else. Idk if dodgy is an available perk but if it is, then it really isn't a strictly sprint perk.
---
They're not boxes you open up for prizes, they're just player icons of boxes or new containers you can build in your CAMP. Yeah it's confusing.
---
2nd the motion....
---
They are STASH boxes
---
Deploy your camp a couple times without building and you get a free perk card
---
Yeah, unless I pull it from the main home menu and select QUIT my entire system is on mute, lol. It's so fucking weird and even stranger that Bethesda hasn't fixed it since I've seen posts dating back to LAUNCH about this audio bug!
---
Hope you enjoy the game mate, most of the bad reviews are from people who only played the beta, those of us who actually play the game have been having a great time. There is the odd person who acts like a dick but on the whole people are more than happy to help with missions or bosses (free loot so why not help?) unlike most online games out there. See you in the wastes bud 👍
---
15 points in strength and 4 or 5 pieces of unyielding armor.
---
Enclave Shielded Under Armor gives you +3 strengh.
---
Radicool perk along with nerd rage
---
Twisted Muscles mutation and adrenal reaction
---
Mole Rat chunks give you +1 strength 
---
You can get a 10% melee damage boost from various food.
---
Fury gives you a 30% melee damage boost 
---
Tweak your build to the way you like to play
---
Let people know what platform you’re on
---
Yeah, movement is pretty much the only thing to use AP for in NW, but I still feel like it's worth it.
---
Alternatively new players are not a hobo/stray animal that needs to be treated like they can't find anything/do anything themselves lol
---
Not sure how it is worrying when they made a point to announce wastelanders npcs. The exact thing pve players been crying for
---
Take it slow and enjoy the scenery! Of you die, that's not a big deal at all. Research your perks. Higher level players are almost always super friendly people. If you have a mic things will be easier, but please use headphones. Buying things at robot vendors is always a ripoff. Stay hydrated, eat snacks, do events!
---
And does points u have have impact on battle royale? I mean, if im lvl 2 after coming out, does im at disadvantage over higher lvl players? (im not talking about knowledge they have about hte game itself)
---
I hope we see Charleston, Watoga, or The Mire. Make Tree House Villain a hot spot.
---
Bringing a very critized mess of a game with frequent crashes and bugs and a lacking endgame to a stable running game with creative new additions, an anticipated roadmap and reactions to community requests is.
---
After the first tow or three months would you have thought still spending so much time in the game and being excited by new updates? (Assuming you do still spend time in the game of course, which I can't be sure of.)
---
Try a shovel - you can find one behind the house next to the church in Flatwoods that has a tinkers work bench - there’s normally a shovel and a battery on the ground there
---
You’re probably right, but I’m very attached to my location. I remember reading about the change to billboards and stuff but figured it was a reduction. I’ll try scrapping those and seeing if that changes anything. Thanks for the dialogue!
---
I am not sure, but I have 4 perception cards equipped totaling 15. My character Strength is 2 and i cannot recall if I can equip a level 3 card or not.
---
This is why when it comes to: movies, games, tv shows, and a few other things. If it seems appealing to me I'll try it out. Then after I've made my own opinion I'll let myself read reviews on it. 
---
I hate going into things with a jaded opinion. 
---
On the flip side there's been some things that have slipped past my radar that I will start seeing people praise (like beat saber) and if it looks like something I'd like to try I will. But then other things that get hyped up that doesn't fit into what I like I will pass on anyway. 
---
Fallout 76 was something that I had to try no matter what other people said. It fell short in a few things for me personally (like interesting tapes and stories that I found that seemed to have a dead end) but it also seemed to be a work in progress. While this upset some people I was willing to work with this as more things were added. And the fact that there wasn't a monthly charge for game was a plus (I've paid a subscription fee for a lot less with a lot more bugs and server downtime (Star Wars Galaxies)).
---
Thanks still a newbie. think that edit fixed it
---
Backpacks, muthaflippin backpacks.
---
Yeah sometimes they seem to turn themselves off like the icons used to all the time
---
pick up absolutely every weapon you can off of every single mob. hoard those and sell them all at once.
---
Yeah, I’ll have to scrap it and rebuild due to the changes made with it
---
In Adventure mode I am permanently over-encumbered, so even regular movement drains my AP. By comparison, Nuclear Winter is a dream! More than enough AP for me.
---
And also, 1 of the new perks helps you find it somehow
---
Yeah, it's tough. But on console your playing other ppl on console, and some are pretty damn good, so I can only assume practice makes perfect. A guy sees me from a distance and I move to evade, and bam! I'm dead...I'm like, is that guy for real or AI.
---
All good fixed
---
Doubtful, as in my post my 100 ish friends are not free players
---
I buy 1 EA game ... BF. I'm not sure I'll get any this year. Maybe the new starwars game. I'm probably going to get COD for the first time in 5 years. You made a wildly poor assumption. I probably buy 2-3 $60 games A YEAR. I'm 26 I'm not young or old. I care about my money too. What in the hell is wrong with releasing a broken game too early when you know for a fact the fixes and changes will forever be free? It's just like early access except I don't later have to purchase the full game. I knew the game was going to be buggy, I certainly knew how it was going to release after I played the beta. I knew exactly what I was buying. Why are you pretending like Bethesda illuded to releasing a finished product. They were very clear about what they we're releasing. Anyone that regrets the purchase of this game only has their selves to blame. As far as I'm concerned.
---
:( sigh GOT why you do dis to me. last season felt so rushed. it ended as I sort of expected but the effects and overall cinematography was pretty damn cool. the battle was epic, the dragon was cool, I do feel they could have done a better job with the story but calling it garbage and hating on it is out of line in my opinion. I am only upset that they ended it and didn't just keep on keeping on. I want to see how arya and gendry work out, do they have kids, how well does bran do as ruler. what does arya find west of westoros, I imagine she gets sick on the boat and chalks it up to seasickness, then she gets on land and keeps getting morning sickness till she realizes shes pregnant with gendries offspring, then has a fraught journey home while trying to protect her new baby bump. whats up in the north with jon snow, how does his stuff go on after, can he actually die? what if he is immortal. how about kids. can he have kids? does he end up settling down with the free folk? how does the iron bank respond to losing out on a significant investment in cerci? maybe the hound survived that fall somehow. Not a good ending for me GOT but ty for ten years of mostly awesome.
---
Unfortunately it will be the same when it come to motion movement
---
I saw a new player getting demolished by an enemy, helped them killed it and dropped some supplies to help them
---
That's a fair point. Kinda seems clear to me that they're throwing lore out the window with this game in favor of salvaging it. 
---
It's a shame, but still cool to have that armor available.
---
Oh no, 76 was a bugfest. It just wasn't as bad as everybody's favorite golden child, against which most people like to compare the other Fallout titles. If New Vegas could become so amazing despite its initial problems, I saw no reason 76 couldn't do the same.
---
You can plug any headphones with mic into PS4. Those white Apple ones you got with an iPhone once upon a time work fine. My $15 earbuds with a mic are all I use.  You don’t need fancy company approved, geek-grade ear goggle headsets.
---
Its pretty easy to switch your mods off for some NW time, just rename your Fallout76custom.ini and load into the game again.
---
I see what you did there...
---
I don't know if there's a low level The Fixer available, that's a very solid weapon
---
No you're right. It directly carries over. I was under the impression it was flat across. I haven't messed with perks much and just had time to play a few rounds.
---
I mean it kinda did suck at first. It improved a lot though.
---
You walk up to them and press '*ACTION*' and inside the box are all the things.....all the things you have ever put

# IN YOUR STASH!!
---
I believe it was last Wednesday. Yesterday was really the first day she played since. I was farming west tek and had mutant slayers arms and armor. I never stood a chance against their ranged explosive. 
---
I lost a ton of junk but I would have lost a ton more to not see that look on her face. It was truly heartbreaking. Something in a game has never saddened/angered me so much. 
---
She wrote down there PSNs. I have vowed revenge. I wont put them on blast in a public forum, as I know it's part of the game. But I'm going to go John Rambo on their ass
---
haha...same here, I keep playing to get my aim down...its tough as F%\^K to aim and move with your thumbs, but ppl have mastered it, so i will too...no matter how many times i die (in the first 5 min).
---
It does not give me a code all it says it cannot continue using the application the data for the following application is corrupted
---
Okay, here's a minor Whoosh! for you, as it should have been obvious that my post is not 100% serious. Just pointing out how silly sth looks to an observer. It's not just vending machines, of course: I see people trading with each other with their weapons drawn as well, Mexican stand-off style.
---
Can you check if you can equip a card that has a higher point requirement than what you have
---
All it takes is one quick browse through your Reddit history to see you're putting on an act. Your real life actually must be very sad and pathetic and I'm sorry. Well I would be sorry BUT IM AN ALPHA BIIITTTCHHHH
---
Why are people downvoting me wanting an even better game, o.o
---
It's still free weekend, how about you try it first and judge later? My guess is no, you won't like it, but no harm in trying.
---
Interested as well :)
---
My complaint is if you're just doing a LFG then you have to add them as friends. I added at least 12 people in the last 2 days, some of which I may never see again.  It's either a continuous clean out or you have to scroll through a whole bunch of people trying to find your normal friends
---
Ok, then why did you compare this game to the rest of the BR games? Also I threw that in at the very end at the end of my argument and didn't insult you.
---
I found that place yesterday, along with a level 50 legendary sheepsquash. I wasn’t able to loot a single thing, not even my own lost junk! Luckily I didn’t have much.
---
Console physical versions should be discs, so I doubt the bundle thing will do if you have a Digital only xbox one :/. Only physical editions that give codes instead of an actual disc is PC version.
---
You do you. When a legendary item sells for 7000 caps in your vending machine, you understand that caps are not "a finite resource" that only robots can give you. 
---
The only resource here is time really, so that's why I'm ok with spending X caps to get X resources. Because regardless of their cap price, I save (= profit) time.
---

---
I didn’t think it’s the most popular just because of WOW.. but WOW has been going in a downward trend and so many players have switched over to ESO. All of which has said ESO is better. This is from experience playing with many people on ESO.
---
Just sit in the overseers office. It's normally pretty chill up there and you can look down and judge everyone in the main room acting like crazies
---
Yeah, in the past week we've had mostly good challenges.
---
It wasnt the best in the beginning. It wasn't worth a pre order. But it's worth something more now. It's evolved, like ESO did
---
Also a reason to stop getting yohr news from facebook.
---
Beta
---
I’m in demos says unavailable?!
---
Hi in demos says unavailable?!, I'm dad.
---
Get grenade launcher and fling nades in their general direction.
---
👏👏👏 we need more people like this in the game.
---
cool! have you won a game yet? how your freestyle aim?
---
Yup, and another single press of Square brings it up again immediately, so you don't really waste more than a few hundred milliseconds.
---
I picked up the game for Xbox One on black Friday last year and it's been a good experience over all. 
---
All I heard was that it is bad, glitchy and just plain not playable. I've had some issues with crashes in the past or some lag, but that's to be expected with a MMO. Doing events with random people, giving some excess stuff to lower lvl peeps and see them be thankful, and seeing some of the super awesome Camps in the game have made this a great game to me
---
What, are people supposed to buy every game for themselves lul
---
It runs on the same engine as fallout 4, so whatever was causing you the issue there is probably still here. If you're on PC you can disable motion blur and depth of field, but that's about it.
---
My sides...
---
Now I need to find a porn music soundboard to play over the mic.
---
Wait a little ittle crash soon
---
We're seeing confusion on this so we've passed the feedback along to the dev's. They are player icons and stash box skins.
---
True I have too much faith in the community
---
Kill the squirrel in white springs with the shovel you find, that worked for me.
---
burn him! Burn Him! BURN HIM!
---
I said this in a similar post earlier: Bethesda will never, ever push the main story aside for the BR. People keep comparing it to Fortnite and are worried it'll take over, but Fortnite is free, and people aren't going to pay $30-60 for just a BR mode, when there are other modes to play as well. I feel like there will be a core dev team that sticks with the NW updates, etc, but I think BGS Dallas (or Austin?) will still focus on the game overall, and probably Adventure Mode the most. 
---
Now, unless NW takes off like insane and it does WONDERS in the Atomic Shop, that is the \*only\* way I could see BGS replacing it with Adventure Mode. Even though that's far from reality. 
---
Did you see the interaction they got for announcing NPCs and dialogue options? That's their bread and butter.
---
I love NW, I love Adventure Mode. They balance each other out perfectly. 
---
(Also I'm lowkey loving having near-empty servers on Adventure Mode in the middle of the night because it has been getting me MAJOR farming).
---
This is a list of links to comments made by Bethesda employees in this thread:

I had purchased 1000 atoms from the shop thinking that it was a hidden bonus or such, since I saw the ad on the site I felt assured I would get it - but no of course I was wrong! And Bethesda support basically says too bad so sad about it because I made a bad assumption and the actual deal wasnt live.  
---
Not great customer support, guys.
---
[u/LadyDevann](https://www.reddit.com/u/LadyDevann/) can you help ?
---
loving this update. so much fun.
---
Ran into a bug in nuclear winter last night.  I was downed, and right infront of me, my team mate was downed.   team mate #3 revived me, and as soon as i was up, i revied the teammate infront of me.   but then everything froze, i somehow exited my power armour, and I couldn't emote, couldn't use the favourite wheel, or do anything. I just stood there.  I could still chat with my mic.  
---
I imagine I somehow get stuck between dead and alive due to the sequence of events.
---
Doing the lord's work here, son!
---
Compared to most replies I see here. And I'm not trying to discourage long replies. 
---
I have a lot to say about this mode too, I just don't have the time to say more than; love is a strong word.
---
&amp;
---
Todd: Everyone's nice to each other....now fight each other to the death
---
Lend is a strong word, that makes it sound like you can just give it back lol. What platform? I can help you get one if you're on Xbox.
---
Just the last one that people have reported in this thread.  If anyone has any more, please provide it so we can have the full list!
---
Now you know they lie.
---
Love the idea. Bethesda could change the color (to keep it separate from NW), or just change it to look like a military-inspired duffel/kit bag.
---
Can't number the times I've lost a paper bag in tall grass/bushes...
---
I think you're one of the few people on the planet I've actually seen play the main game and not the BR.
---
It’s strategical. I like it.
---
Can you still get the gift emote?? Once I got it my message of dropping stuff seems to get across much easier. Lol
---
Yes, I've done that, NW is undoubtably a lot of fun.  Although, my preference is still leaning towards official mod support.
---
I would be down with getting the designs from the atom shop.
---
Ya I'm a 220 something, always kinda went all out on building, but just recently built in what I feel to be my forever home. Although I have said that before, just goes to show that you'll probably be finding new cool places for a long time to come.
---
Yeah it's all odd, things such as the Fo4 X-01 loading prompt made confusion about the X-01 being in Fo4, as it called it post-war armour, yet Nuka world had a spanking new Nuka Cola Quantum X-01 in display, (through lore matching n stuff, X-01 is pre-war, still in heavy development, so the loading prompt was incorrect).
---
It isn't the first time these things has occured, weapons such as the Radium rifle, Gamma gun shouldn't exist in 76 as they're Atom of children creations, along with the cryolater which was supposed to be a Vault 111 exclusive weapon, the lore of 76 is great, it just comes down to certain weapons that (and now in this case also PA) that seem out of place.
---
I'm sure Beth will have some funky way to make sense of it being in game, but heh no clue when you can unlock them, supposedly in Nuclear Winter ranking, but hell in no close time will I get to level 105 Overseer XD
---
I too didnt experience hardly any bugs. I had a good time with it even at launch. I suggested to people to buy it only if they knew what they were getting, which was fallout 4 co-op. Its a bethesda game so you might see some weird shit. If you can handle that, then get it. If not and the sight of one t-pose enemy is enough to make you ragequit...well dont buy it.
---
Thanks man.  Do you know how long spawns of items like that usually take to come back if they've already been looted?
---
Not what I mean dumbass I'm not a free to play weekend guy I have been playing so why don't you be helpful you cunt
---
Don't all the large crates ping? Or is it a different ping?
---
Seems like Endurance, Charisma and Perception/Strenght are strong SPECIALs. With Charisma 6 and the perk, you can heal other nearby (30 yards?) teammates 100% of your stimpak healing. At Endurance 9 and Ghoulish perk card, you can heal yourself greatly when taking rad damage, including the Storm. Perception has great rifle perks. And Strength has great heavy gun perks. Heavy gun's are probably the best at close range, but for 100 yards distance they are pretty useless. Good cards tend to have a level-9 restriction, and you can't have two level-9 cards of the same SPECIAL stat. I think it's still too early for meta-builds as no-one has every card.
---
Last 4 level up have been dupe cards for me. So I guess I will get it eventually.
---
You can have as many of each type as you want, but only a total of 7 cards
---
I think xbox has visual settings for color blind.. but I dont know about other systems
---
I feel like they could make the lobby time more useful by adding things to do.  Make the Atom store accessible via terminals.  A shooting range were we can try all the weapons in NW.  An armory to inspect the armor, An explosives range for grenades and GLs.  A medbay to view all the drugs. An open area to blueprint camps.  Things like that would make the lobby wait useful
---
The Handmade is best - you're one level away from being able to use one too.  You can always use an auto combat rifle or assault rifle, but you'll just be gimping yourself unless you have some good legendary variants of those weapons.  SMG eats .45 like crazy and you craft those in lesser quantities than 5.56 so its not generally as viable for your primary IMO.
---
I will upvote this suggestion every time I see it.  My gaming buddy is hard of hearing and can't use a headset.
---
We've resorted to texting each other to communicate, total pain the ass. We need text chat - if people don't want it they can disable it.
---
Your link has Wow with more than twice the players as ESO. How are you even claiming ESO is the largest when wow has 7million players and ESO has 3 million?
---
Weird. I took Billings Homestead and did all the necessary tasks for survival (placed a Fertilizer Resource so I could Milk the Brahmin) used a Sickle to kill said Brahmin and the Challenge Completed for me
---
I had that too, wasn’t happy either. 🤪
---
Seeing the noobies is great. I saw 9 all at flatwoods yesterday.  Funny because it seemed like all were running solo but coincidentally at the same story mission.
---
But why should it be increased now that less things require it? Makes no sense
---
Honestly I’m excited to see what they announce I’ve been stockpiling low level legendary gear since they announced it. But there’s no information as of yet hopefully they give details on the next inside the vault.
---
You are also playing it many months after launch. The nuances I experienced when I first played are probably fixed by now
---
Just my 2cents
---
It happens to myself sometimes when the sever crashes, and it is really aggravating to say the least...!!!
---
I sell a fair bit, but if it keeps happening I'll stop using the feature, and just play the game less I guess.
---
No U stupid
---
No it isn't, Wow has more than twice the players of ESO at 7mil to ESO with 3 mil.
---
on the briefcase issue....I was in game where somebody launched a nuke. I didn't know how big it was until i looked at the map.  I was in the top 5(best so far) and didn't have a hazmat suit or PA so i was running from he fire and trying to stay out of the nuke zone.  nice touch and not easy to launch (getting all codes etc.), but you gotta ask: since players are invisible on the map you should have a sneak peak before you launch of ppl's locations...like 2 seconds...more fun.
---
Maybe you do get to see ppl before launch...anybody confirm?
---
Hahahaha i should fix that!
---
PS4 sadly
---
Ditto, I keep trying to log in and either sit in an eternal loading screen or get crashed out on
---
I'd only be able to link US Amazon, just go to the site and search?
---
This comment.   FO3 and New Vegas was a different engine
---
Thank you.
---
It is probably in the same pile that the original announced bulldozer system ended up in.
---
i've found like 4 briefcases but never enough codes to launch a nuke. i ask my teammates if they have any codes but everyone is always silent...
---
You get them as rewards from Encryptid as well.
---
Good initiative. I've just been dropping tons of ammo, chems, and water in the overseer's stash by 76.
---
It's been 7-8 months since release
---
That's a REALLY good idea! Have you shared this with the mods or anything?
---
Good info, thanks!
---
No problem :)
---
Also, i read your post and i fully agree. Let’s hope bethesda doesn’t only focus on the battle royale from now
---
It bothers me only when I’m running to the circle. I think lower AP when in combat is good. You don’t want people just running halfway across the map when you engage them. My solution is just leave for my destination a little earlier so I’m not gasping for AP.
---
You had better luck than I did.  I tried to drop a 'care package' for a level 2, gave him the 'come over here' sign, and while I was scrolling thru my menu the goof starts punching me.  I'm level 226.  I gave him the 'thumbs down' to no avail.  All this could have been avoided if he just HAD A MIC!  I gave up and went on my way.  Oh well.  ('noob' was in his name which is why I chose him)
---
Let's not forget they reviewed the game when it was objectively a broken piece of shit and I'm saying this as someone who bought it immediately. I'm glad Bethesda stuck to it and made it a better game, but It's taken 6 months to polish it into the product it is now.
---
It's stupid to judge reviews of 6 months ago against what exists now.
---
I'd probably purchase some glasses from the automic shop to fix this🤓
---
It is a solid idea with code already more or less in place to do. Really should happen
---
Same. Dropped a baggie of goodness outside the vault and the new guy just ran off, two more came out and ran away before someone took it.
---
Even if it scraps to zero junk. This would be best so we do not have to drop from misc.  burnt books should not give scrap. The paper wouldn’t hold up for anything.
---
If you're on PC, there's a mod for that on Nexus called Invisible Backpacks.
---
I'd love official mod support too - but the reality is that it will be one of the very last things Bethesda gets to, if they get to it.  Some of these mods though shows us how much better the game can be...  why Bethesda is not implementing them into the game themselves is partly due to them catering for the lowest common denominator ie. consoles, and there's only so many (few) keys on a controller.
---
That is BR for you.
---
ok thx. I was hoping that the disc was just for installing, and that there would be a key like in WoW.
---
well, the description specifically says "nuclear winter" containers
---
you can sell them. 🤷🏾‍♂️
---
I got the standard edition for PC for 17 from Amazon on Monday.
---
Exactly! Can’t believe all the people coming out of the woodwork to defend their laziness!
---
Haha I really want to start grinding again so I can refine my build. But I just don't want to dump more time into leveling this character (already 88) if prestiging is the way to go since a full reset would make the grinding pointless
---
Come to my home in the Mire baby!  Tree house combat for the win!
---
This is what's confusing me. If your stats carry over from adventure mode wouldn't you be able to equip more perks than someone just starting? If everyone is balanced in game does player level from adventure mode really matter then?
---
i've found two in the exact same place...so i think it's random spawns at a few different locations.
---
Not got a decent pc right now sadly
---
Haha! I'll pass this along
---
Just server hop the places where they are at
---
Are you serious? I just lol’d.
---
It’s now my job to do their job for them?
---
What's wrong with orgies?
---
As a matter of fact, I was thinking they should add a [Fisto](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fisto) to vault 51.
---
Don't forget server crashing by dropping a max sized blueprint camp a few times. They really need to fix that since literally a single player can lag out and crash the entire server.
---
Now get on a mic and start yelling for Shaun every where you go
---
Yeah I haven't seen it mentioned at all recently so I wasn't sure if it was still in the works. Personally I don't want to see it happen anymore because I want to grind my character beyond level 50 and if the prestige offered good rewards I know I'd just end up using it and resetting anyways
---
They say keep your friends close and enemies closer
---
This and a full perk card list so I can fully determine which character to use.

---
 &gt; Haha! I'll pass this along
---
Hardly any will stick around though, they’re purely playing the game because it’s free. A week from now some will stay but most will move on. It sucks ad the game deserves more love rather than a sudden flick of players because they added the latest fad mode
---
this comment right here.
---
Weight plates (in nuke silos and ski resort etc), rat poison (lots in the burrows), can chimes (ski resort, spruce knob lake place, Camden park). My favorite to collect is the can chimes cause they give lots of cans
---
Gun fu adds bonus damage to each additional enemy. It goes up too the further you carry the streak. So the first enemy it’s only 10% extra damage per shot but by the 5th it’s 50%
---
I'm glad someone else has come around!  My buddy who played with me fell off just before the Faschnat parade and that's when things started to get better.
---
I play this game daily but I can’t bring myself to make a new character. Slightly jealous of those who manage it.
---
This version is awesome
---
kinda disappeared...thats why i gave up adventure mode.  lvl 404 here, and get no credit for my dedication...lvl 50 can have same power as i do,  If they do reward fairly, I'll stay with the game for quite a while...if not, im out. got my moneys worth tho!
---
What is with the downvotes? Some people are unbelievable!
---
We don't really need key boxes... This game generates plenty of revenue from the Atomic Shop as it is. Loot boxes are already falling under scrutiny for incentivizing gambling behaviors in children and young adults and many countries are forcing companies to either be more transparent with the odds, or moving to disallow them at all. Look at DEstiny 2 it started with loot box eververse and has evolved more towards a warframe model. 
---
I understand the desire to move FO76 to ftp to get more players but I don't think key boxes are the way to go. If anything POE has shown that having good skins (as well as some specific seasonal boxes) pays big dividends. 
---
If a player likes adventure let them do that. I honestly disliked other BR games (tried fortnight, PUPG, APEX) and stopped playing them after only a few games, for some reason this one feels more balanced, faster paced, and seems a lot more team driven. That being said if people have more fun playing BR let them, why force them into a game-mode they don't like as much? 
---
TL/DR
---
No key boxes please...
---
Forest region events
---
The names are confusing. One of them is a stash box you can build, then there’s an “Epic crate”, which is apparently a player icon. Most of the rewards are player icons or photo frames. They really need to publish a list of the rewards with explanations.
---
That's what happens when you listen to people that haven't played it.
---
Do you mean In general? Or just in third person view?
---
I’m on PS4, do you happen to have one?
---
The bulldozer is live in game. It was just an added functionality to the build menu where player-placed items will remove any objects they collide with. It doesnt work on all trees and rock formations, but mostly any free standing item that would otherwise be in your way can now be removed by placing an item down in its place.
---
/u/LoneVaultWanderer any word on this?
---
Just 4 of us on xbox at the SBQ last night... all over 100... did not go well...
---
I’m also on Xbox sadly - I know you can buy it in the enclave bunker if you’ve made it that far into the story
---
Free week is free - the real test comes next week once the free trial ends.  Then we'll really know how many converts/new players the game has.
---
Yeah and when people spam their houses 4 times what do I do ? Spend half of my game destroying houses ?
---
Nuclear Winter is what Survival should have been. If done right it will bring tons of people into Fallout. The massive and diverse environment and also the PVE elements make this a way more interesting PVP game than Battlefield and COD. 
---
Get rid of legendary effects when pvping and VATS, and anything that’s impossible in a post apocalyptic world. Armors and weapons function as they should and equalized for all levels. Level 1 guns and armors have the same power as level 50. You rely on skills and senses just like in NW, not duped ebay crap. 
---
No more slap damage, any shot can hurt and kill. More random spawn locations near a given spot, you get spawned outside players’ line of sights. 
---
Show a random circle of approximate location of the top players if you HAVE to, but honestly it’s just plain bad to give away any player’s location. 
---
Mutations can happen during a session like in NW but won’t get carried over when you respawn. 
---
You drop all the junk and supplies you picked up in the game but not the ones you brought into it. 
---
If caps reward has to come from killed players, then players with insufficient caps in their account can’t play. Otherwise it’s just unfair for others who potentially wasted their time and ammo for nothing.
---
played with a person last night who built this great little one room fort that was instrumental in our win. if i wasnt playing with an alt that has 0 camp plans found i would be spending sometime blueprinting a little defensive box.
---
I found one wedged into a park grill downhill from Arktos Pharma.
---
Ah! Good one! xD
---
Another good one at low level is collision course at the Morgantown airport. First time you do it you’ll also get a decent legendary for lower levels.
---
Pretty much any of the events are good for low levels in the forest.
---
With all of that said, focus on the “horde” events. They guarantee a 3 star legendary enemy that gives a chance to get a good 3 star legendary item.
---
If I’m bored I still go back and hit those events just for the experience and I’m at level 172.
---
Edit: also enlightenment at the lighthouse in the forest. Gives 5% exp bonus in addition to other rewards
---
I LOVE THIS ART SO MUCH!!! These are incredible!! Would you be able to ask the artist if we could share the pioneer scouts art on our social media? We would credit them and link back to their pixiv.
---
Yeah nothing wrong at all with this game,  people just like to cry
---
I had the electrical glitch yesterday.  Turret was destroyed and every time I tried to repair it wouldn't.   Finally scrapped the turret and built a new one and it was built in a destroyed state as well.   Next I tried to attach a wire and it kept telling me there were to many electrical connections when there were no connections to the newly built turret at the time.
---
Logged off then back on and everything worked as it should have the first time around.   I have no idea what was going on.
---
Turret was again destroyed today by Mothman who coincidentally destroyed the turret the day before.   This time it repaired as normal.
---
I would probably agree with you if they gave the game at least 4 more months of development.
---
I played the game in BETA on Xbox, then after release on PS4, the game had way too many bugs to play originally (and the friends i was planning to play with all flaked on me) so i let the game have the time it needed to clean up its bugs. Now im loving playing on PC (I mod all the bethesda games till they crash) just waiting for the next udpate to bring NPC's and hopefully we will start to hear about Mod support soon.
---
I didn’t know that, thanks. Though I seldom see the Encryptid event announced on any discord’s I’m on or on the worlds I join so I guess that’s why I never knew/noticed compared to SBQ fights haha
---
I'll definitely be messing with it Tonite to see

Using a LA rifle with a much slower ROF; it looks like Furious stacks up to 80%, 20% at a whack.
---
Honestly it was still pretty unstable last weekend and the Combat update on Monday makes it feel like a completely new game. Stable, less jittery, and latency issues are drastically improved.
---
You don't, but you could have a terminal before launching to reveal enemies.
---
Honestly I launched one and the radius is so big that by the time you reach the second and third circle you don't even need to know where people are. The blast radius is huge
---
Yeah, I actually stopped playing as much waiting for the prestige system. I made a new character, got them to 50 also. I was hoping for more info with the nuclear winter release but that didn’t seem to happen.
---
All I care is it's gone the next time I 'scrap all' junks on the workbenches...
---
When you see an invisible three star legendary you don’t server hop, you try to hit it with anything you have.
---
haha I want to grind like that too! I want to put some time into the character I have now and push him toward level 100 at least. But if prestige system rewards people with the best stats / perks by prestiging back down to level 1, that definitely sours the experience of grinding beyond 50 which tons of more dedicated players have already done
---
I can craft you one (Modus sells plans for X-01 mods now) free of charge if you'd like.
---
It did.
---
Well we will just have to disagree on that point
---
I got frog legs.
---
Frog Legs: Jump 300% higher(requires 9 agility)
---
What better could they offer? I think it should be a choice because I don’t want to reset because leveling up was kind boring the second time because you know what to do already
---
I feel it absolutely deserved the flak it got at release, and unfortunately the longstanding stigma against it is the price Bethesda is paying for rushing it out the door in the state it was in.
---
That said, having given it a chance, I think they've made it a lot better and I've been having good fun with it. I am hopeful that they can continue making it better with the next big patches and I hope people give it a second appraisal now that it's not making explosive headlines every couple weeks.
---
Additionally - all of the new people have to create a character in Adventure or Survival before they can do Nuclear Winter.  Whose to say that they won't be curious enough to keep exploring?  :)
---
The more the merrier.
---
It actually upsets me that I can't have my .44 Raging Bull.
---
It's made via datamining the possible spawn locations for each type of crate, all those dots weren't manually placed based on scouting things out. That'd be a near-insurmountable task.
---
Wonder if it’s cause the games free for a week?
---
I Would love it if I could get on a team that would be the same everytime. But as a solo player in adventure mode, that is just not going to happen so I will just stick with adventure mode. One thing I wish I was able to do more of in FO76 was make some online friends, just never really happened....
---
ok...explain what you mean then and we can help you....but if you are talking about the blue box 'stash skins' you get then you sir are the C\*NT. 
---
If you are a veteran member to r/FO76 then you should know you should search before posting!!
---
Regards
---
a cunt
---
Interesting and mostly good interview. The last question imo came off rather rude to ask, as it seems like most media outlets still don’t believe the game has a large dedicated player base(which in fact it does, and gladly getting bigger with the free week!)
---
WELL DONE
---
Because you could just go to some random guy on the map lol
---
First time too, the bundle is like you said a fair price.  :)
---
Pretty sure it's just been delayed because it will definitely affect server stability and it's difficult to implement. 
---
How do you do it? Fallout 4 let you drop items, then move them in workshop mode. This wasn't even good enough for Fallout 4, the items can sink through the surface they are on and fall over. Also items can't be dropped in 76 to begin with. That means they have to add it to a completely new system or the workshop menu. Adding that many items makes the menu take so much longer to open, anyone that downloaded a big workshop mod on Xbox is familiar with that.
---
Staunch defender, and avid player of 76 here (Lvl 216 - 650+ hours). . . And even I must say that what little I have played this week so far I've had more disconnected from servers in the past few days, than I had over the last 3-4 months combined. Also has 2-3 blue screens, but that could be on my old launch day PS4. Hopped on for maybe ~45 minutes last night and got 1 disconnect and 1 blue screen. Definitely is showing a weakness in the servers. I mean, it's great that this many are giving the gm a try again or for the 1st time. . . But server side needs to be shored up if they expect many to stick around.
---
LOL! what game is that
---
You can buy it from the enclave medic vendor
---
I totally agree with you. This specifc audio bug is pretty gamebreaking if youre not playing with headphones or something
---
Have you tried the fix of 'going to settings &gt; audio &gt; and changing the voice chat thing from Auto to Team or None'?     I remember finding that fix on here back then and it worked for a bit. Im at work right now so I cant currently attempt it, but if you do let me know how it turns out
---
Even Joseph Anderson (he of the 1 hour critique and 3 hour glitch compilation on youtube) said on twitch during E3 that people on the fence about the game should use the free week to check it out, and that he's planning to do a 'one year later' update video eventually.
---
That is the type of luck I have.
---
I gave up after my 4th server crash trying to finish the final mission.  Is it better now?
---
It is to keep the competitive scene balanced. Lots of very old games had bugs that let you make broken pkemon by EV and IV breeding.
---
I role play a fat bastard that eats 5 boxes of Fancy Lads Snack Cakes a day, so all I do is find the nearest bush and wait because I can't move.
---
sameee, but I have the itch to start playing now honestly and I want to work on my current build without the threat of needing to wipe it out to prestige for better perks. I got curious cause I didn't see it mentioned in the latest patch notes and I was waiting for it to drop before I started playing again. At this point I just want to start grinding again so I'm kind of hoping the prestige thing doesn't happen
---
Been playing NW and at first I was nervous that the amazing community would not be as great it the battle royale format but boy was I wrong. 
---
Everyone in NW has been just as helpful and the communication on the teams I have been on has been great keep it up everyone!!!
---
I wish I knew how to create sound boards. I'd love a bunch of them for differing Fallout characters. I do have one for Vault Tec Sales Guy and for Liberty Prime , want one for Preston and one for Piper
---
I mean, WoW expac launches involve normally a day / week of lag then it goes back to normal because of server instability, I would've been fine with that.
---
76 had loads more issues, which is why so many people stopped playing it. Sure, it's much better now, not disagreeing. 
---
People held this game to a single player standard because that is what people associate with fallout - Todd very much did say it would still be as immersive an experience as a single player fallout game.
---
I've earned a ton of atoms while playing this game but I have never used them. I'm worried that a sweet outfit that catches my taste will release just after I spend them. Guess I'll keep hoarding.

Mmm, I don't know about that. I'd agree if game retailers allowed returns for customer dissatisfaction, but as consumers all we have to go off of is video game reviews. The trick is to find a reviewer that more-or-less agrees with you on most points, and not to go with the most popular review videos on YouTube.

Yeah, right?

Sadly a few weeks ago, it dawned on me from reading everything that we'll all be equal...not fair that a lvl 51 should get the same legendary perks as a lvl 400. I should get 8....anyway, they dont want bullies in game bothering ppl. It killed it for me...all the grinding to upgrade gear etc. And I'm back to lvl 1...they'll lose old timers if the do that...IMHO... BGS listen please.
---
My level 81 is 8,7,8,9,8,8,8 and is designed for more general use of weapons.
---
You're right, I likely would have done the same.  
---
Given the times it happened to me @ WS, I had spawned in and was at the far end of the row; those two are never legendary, so relogged.
---
This. I played Faschnacht nearly 50 times. I enjoyed it the first three. Many people just want the items.
---
stupid question: Your Special stats do carry over???? SO the base game does affect your br character? interesting. Didn't think it did.

I can't even deal with perk cards yet. Still working on getting my heart rate down from this damn mode, my hands shake, my heart rate goes through the roof lol, I can barely barely aim

They know, and will fix it for the next update
---
not sure about the invisible enemies though
---
Same. I’m probably going to grind overseer levels to hit that 99 mark
---
I have some misc data on some stealth buffs from patch 10 for you... 
---
Note I’m still working on compiling accurate base damages for non legendary versions but maybe you’ll find this interesting nonetheless. 
---
Eventually I’m going to make a big spreadsheet of everything so you can make sense of the values for your calculator.
---
(Listing raw base damage and damages with max demo expert and max bloody mess for Two Shot Launchers... The math doesn’t quite make sense but it’s close-ish)
---
**Two Shot Launchers Stealth Buff**
---
• TS Broadsider = 553 (Raw)
---
—&gt; Rank 5 Demo Expert + Rank 3 Bloody Mess = 1,009
---
• TS Missile Launcher = 633 (Raw)
---
—&gt; Rank 5 Demo Expert + Rank 3 Bloody Mess = 1,156
---
(Vanilla level 50 Missile Launcher raw base is now 321, was 160)
---
• TS Fat Man = 1,833 (Raw)
---
—&gt; Rank 5 Demo Expert + Rank 3 Bloody Mess = 3,364
---
• TS Fat Man MIRV = 593 (Raw)
---
—&gt; Rank 5 Demo Expert + Rank 3 Bloody Mess = 1,082
---
(Same damage regardless of weapon level tested on 25 &amp; 45 versions)
---
• TS M79 = 237 (Raw)
---
—&gt; Rank 5 Demo Expert + Rank 3 Bloody Mess = 434
---
• TS Auto Grenade Launcher = 237 (Raw)
---
**Gamma Gun Stealth Buff**
---
• 121 raw base / 125 rad (was 60 / 125)
---
—&gt; Rank 3 Bloody Mess = 139 / 125
---
(signal repeater + deep dish - need to examine other mod combos)
---
I mean at the beginning.  The initial launch not updates.
---
I felt the same. Then I hit end game and the constant farm ammo, fight queen, farm ammo again got old very fast. Love my 50 cal, don't love farming ammo for it. Still cant get a legendary one either. :( 
---
All in all its decent till "end game" which is just farming tin cans. IMO.
---
I love it! Looks awesome.
---
I see no problem with 15 agility and 6 endurance.
---
Often people were bashing an not perfect game for reasons that didn't even exist -- remember trade stealing?
---
Unrelated question, please feel free to downvote. What is the level 5 reward for NW? It says I got a crate or something like that, but I can’t find it. Is it a CAMP item, or some special cosmetic?
---
Sweet! wish i could exp. that win!
---
Honestly nice to see someone just as confused by all the anger here as me. I was having the occasional bit of fun on 76 but after all the negativity thrown at me for daring to post an opinion, not because they even seem to disagree with it but purely for posting, I really don't care about this game enough to hop back in, all my close friends left months ago anyway and if I want a fallout with NPCs I will just pop back in fallout 4.  I have some decent 3* guns and armor that you can have just for not being a huge dick. Message me if you're interested as I would rather they go to someone before I uninstall everything.
---
Cheers!
---
I also am starting today! I’ve been waiting for patches and stuff to come out before starting
---
Thank you for this!
---
You're just a commie SOB who can't stand the sweet freedom in the air of America. If you dont like our beautiful irradiated country then GTFO.
---
I agree, I do the horde events all the time but there has been quite a few times when the horde boss isn’t legendary
---
Plenty of console games have text chat
---
Yes. Take your time exploring the world. listen to the tapes, read the notes. the story told is not a bad one. 
---
I know its difficult when in a group because you (if you are anything like me) don't want other to have to wait for you.
---
Oof, lowest common denominator, haha.  I'm just dreaming of a free world full of superior efficiency through community action.
---
One day!
---
Do I need to finish that quest line to find the vendor?
---
Yeah but how long did that take? You can crash the server and get 100xp inba matter of a couple minutes.
---
The Fixer starts ftom level 20.
---
As others have said, the forest is geared for low levels, however Project Paradise (the event at Arktos Pharma) is an exception.  That one is meant for higher leveled players.
---
Sometimes high level players will run into low level gear, rather than either pass it up or have it take inventory space, we feel it would help you guys starting out
---
I don’t feel like treating people to lap dances and free food.
---
I'm having fun with it as well but it's Fallout 4.5 to me. Everything is the same, knowing every "go meet ___" will end up with a dead body has gotten old in the 1 day I've played the game and the graphics look no better than Fallout 4 - 16x the details! 
---
I do love the fact the ammo is scarce, and the need to eat and drink, finding plans, recipes I like that stuff.
---
No, absolutely no requirements what so ever.
---
[This article](https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/get-help/help-library/games/installing--downloading---updating/general-solutions-to-problems-downloading-content-to-playstation/) has some further info about the padlock with a few potential solutions. Hopefully one of these will work for you. I personally think the restore licenses option seems the more logical choice out of those three though. Good luck!
---
I will never reset my main.  But I built a second character just like her which I leveled to 50.  If the mode comes out I will use the new character for the reset.
---
What ever happened to people not being able to switch between game modes anyways with that? I thought you had to make a different character for survival and advancer. But ya that’s why I don’t even bother with anything PvP anymore. Also given I’m a power armor build I’m just screwed from the start with the huge disadvantage I have. Also my luck is one so that’s not helping with getting good legendary weapons ether.  I’m at the point of asking if we can make your own legendary weapon with the legendary vender but I’m sure someone will find away to break that.
---
My first suspicion isn’t that furious is behaving oddly or was changed. My first suspicion is this brand new feature added to the game isn’t working properly.
---
Im set to go in game mode. I have a level 150 PvE shotgunner I don't use much anymore with Anti Armor and TSE shotguns, full vanguards, and no problems. A level 90 Sneap/Sniper PvPer with the best weapons and full sentinel/assassins powered combat armor with 1 chameleon piece. Both are VATS oriented with lots of luck and agility perks. If I can't use VATS I feel like an idiot who never played before lol.
---
Console or PC?  I started yesterday on PS4 and would some some people to run with.
---
But what if they come at you with a banana?
---
I was about to make a post asking what was the rewards and new perk cards for NW. thanks.
---
What platform you play on?
---
My budget seems to be stuck at max capacity no matter what I do. Try to finish my new manor after a few NW matches and I can't even put a painting up.
---
The tuxedo is black.  I've been rocking NW in formal wear.
---
Use the trade subReddits and trade for your desired gear.  The trading is itself fun.
---
Sometimes that happens, and it’s related to server lag. If you leave the area and come back or wait long enough, it will become legendary. 
---
The key is to not kill the crown.
---
Also, in general if you don’t kill the boss (the event boss) and hang around, more legendaries will spawn, and usually at max level for that mob. At low levels you need to be careful because a 3 start level 68 ghoul might be a problem. Insects, wolves and other creatures have lower max levels though.
---
No worries mate, the thing itself its fine, but in fo76 its overdone, and everything emits this light, its sometimes even blinding... Sky, plants, rocks, lamps, everything.... My eyes really starts hurting after looking at this. Not sure why they still didint add option to toggle it off after so long. I had to fix it by editing ini file as @oson001 mentioned
---
LVL 7 and I have one kill so far... I would love a noob server.
---
That's not the whole quest. You're meant to do the ones associated with the location.

I got to level 12 last night and am way more excited about that bronze pip boy holding the severed head of another bronze pip boy than I probably should be.
---
Has anyone else had issues getting the free trial on PS4?  Every time I try to get it in the playstation store it just offers the game for 50% off.  Am I missing something obvious?  I really wanted to try the game.
---
The only connection problems I'm having it connecting my bullets to other players.
---
Honestly melee builds end up feeling to easy for me due too how powerful they are so I started having fun with bloodied stealth builds it helps make the game a bit more risky
---
Seems like a reasonable MM tweak to me
---
Well, that artist just got an instant 'follow' from me on Pixiv. Love the designs here, especially that inspired "Mister of Mystery" design. If Bethesda has any sense (hint, hint, u/Ladydevann), they'll buy the rights to it off of them and put it in the Atomic Shop!
---
I need to get my caps back up on back at 300 with everyone selling the scrums, I got the once’s I wanted lol

Been doing this since release of the game.. Everyone in my permanent group started out like this. Glad to see others doing the same.

I thought I would be smart and drag them to the Wendigo... You know what it did... the same thing I should have... the wendigo RAN, it ran every time those 2 mirelurk Kings hit it... I played a game of chase and hit for a while and after I played gtfo from the mirelurk kings...
---
are the weapon camos for specific guns?
---
They just go into storage. You'll find them in the 'Stored' section of your CAMP menu - sometimes as blueprints, if they were close or joined together when you moved camp :)
---
I did and it fixed it for maybe 3 seconds then it went mute again!
---
LOL. that is still a problem on my first shot taken, when using VATS.
---
Dumb luck.

The game improved like 200% from what is was on launch. I stopped playing after 200 levels because there was literally nothing else to do, got back into it 4 months later, created a new character and man... this game improved a lot, it still has content issues but the gameplay is much better
---
The inventory system for BR is very clunky, i cant fast replace my weapon slots, it equips randomly what ever you pick up. They need something better... Special pitboy for BR exlusive, without all the options.
---
the only impact your specials have is what perk cards you can use, but it is interesting nonetheless
---
&gt; To me it already feel like not having human NPCs was a big mistake for a fallout game. The quests are missing "gravitas" and is a far reach from the Fallout games that made the series great. 
---
There is a reason for the lack of living human NPCs, the first part of the story is about discovering what that reason is.
---
Many people who don't like the game complain that Appalachia feels "empty".  After a nuclear war, fighting between the survivors, an invasion of hard to kill monsters and a plague that people were unable to prevent in time.  What a surprise.
---
You feel it was a mistake.  I feel it was a stroke of genius.
---
I really really hope they pull off the reintroduction of NPCs, but it's going to be hard, the whole actions have consequences thing without the single protagonist.
---
Is there a single player or it's all online?

It takes practice now that I can’t just rely on vats or swinging with melee. Just take a few rounds to grab whatever gun and trying to hit people. Don’t try to be super fancy unless you have a scoped weapon the rows are quick anyway. I’ve been slowly getting better myself. I can actually hit people.
---
And if all else fails be the explosive guy with grenades and grenade launchers.
---
Also I haven’t tried it yet but it seems you can get a missile launcher when you hack a terminal and request a weapon.
---
For sale...

---
It will build a blue print that you can just plop back down without additional resources, provided you have roughly the same terrain. You can also break down the blueprint and rebuild with your previous items(stored items) without camp space penalty.
---
I had severe motion sickness in FO4, but only when playing in power armor, same thing in FO76...
---
Still love both games, i just never play in power armors
---
It still blows in terms of server stability and bugs.

Amen to that :D

Highest kills i got was 17, its really fun!

yeah, i have 'em all, and about 100 perk picks/swaps if i need them....but ive played quite a bit since launch.

But it's the same engine as Fallout 4, so if that one messed you up a little then 76 will probably mess you up as well.
---
Yes.  You gain XP simply by surviving.  It may take a bit more grinding if you can't get a higher ranking in most matches.  At Level 5, you unlock a NW loot box stash skin.  At Level 10, you get the Overseer Chair with the Vault-Tec logo on it.  I've heard you can unlock the other sizes of loot boxes and the figure in the vault in the Rewards display also holds the sugar loaf/welding helmet, so I assume that might be a reward for higher levels.
---
"UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD THIS BE A FOCUS FOR &lt;COMPANY&gt;" is not an opinion. It's a demand. Thanks for playing, try again.
---
Sorry for my fucked spelling, on mobile and autocorrect really blows.
---
[Im doing 7,12,4,4,5,11,13 on a non auto rifle build with a little melee for backup](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=7c445bd&amp;d=sa0sg2pd2pk2e82c72i11ic2a72a81lb0lr2l11pp1pl2lt2a02e00a31lv1s50si0sj0l71ar0pe0&amp;w=p80p90c52i30ia0ij2i42iq2at1lm2pa0p00ao0&amp;n=&amp;m=8c)
---
I keep telling everyone who comes into stream talking badly about games shown in media.
---
A "bad" game can be an amazing game for you.
---
A "GotY" game can be utterly terrible for you.
---
acknowledging that a game has massive issues should never be viewed as the game not being fun. 
---
*someone who bought the game 2 weeks after launch to play with friends. I hate playing it solo. I love playing it with friends.
---
I mean it’s a chances to restart with out having to start over. I like it and hope they make it soon. Yes it sucks having if the new perks cards are worth it why not.
---
The down votes are because people disagree with your opinion.   When you put ideas out there this happens. I believe few people go searching for threads simply to be toxic.  You had an idea, most disagree with your idea.  I applaud you for taking the risk, but have no desire to play in the structure you suggested.
---
How many points in agility does it cost?
---
It's been a problem with all BR modes. Matchmaking needs to happen based on K:D ratios. Like the guy says here. He is level 7 and has a single kill.
---
Bahaha just heard that exactly in his voice.
---
The one and only caveat to this, is if they are teamed up with higher level player.  All bets are off if they initiate PvP and throw the whole team into PvP.
---
This is one of the ways the "Clown Cult" guys have been trolling folks.
---
The same people complaining about the BR mode are the same people creating new posts about how good it is. People seemed to start complaining about it without giving it a try.
---
6 I think!
---
that will probably be really good in winter
---
I've got roughly about a hundred, I've been selling them in my machines too. Use the perk that gives you audio cues to learn where magazines are, and just check those locations each time you pass through
---
He really doesn't like scorched, or communists
---
Wondering if that power armor skin requires you to win matches
---
I had a lot of fun with a Mistress of Mystery build, inspired by this post:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9z04kj/witness_the_mistress_of_mystery_20_health_build/
---
I started a new character for it because it was faster than respeccing from my old one (rifle build).  I did everything up to and including launching a nuke and killing the SBQ.
---
No crops and no turrets. I’ve had the same place for about two months now and know my budget very well. Wish I wasn’t attached to it or I would just scrap it all and rebuild. But I’ve got a flying carpet from before they patched the confetti physics which is still up and flying, but cannot be replicated today. So I’ll stay no matter what, the budget thing just sucks right now
---
Ignore the fanboy apologists. The game was atrocious for a long time. I play it a lot now but to say this game wasn't a massive flop due to incompetence was an understatement. Nigh unplayable due to game-breaking bugs and accounts being randomly banned or deleted.
---
It's obviously patched and a lot better managed now, but my god to ignore the complete shit-show that was release week is stupid. Pretending that Bethesda didn't release one of the biggest cash grabs of the last 3 years.
---
Shhhhhhhhh.. don't tell them that, I need every advantage I can get in that stupid mode.
---
No, that's not how it works. The point is that both of our experiences are anecdotal; therefore you cannot extrapolate that "normal mode is now a ghost town" from simply your experience alone.  You took the anecdotal point and went well beyond it to make a statement about everyone else playing the game, for which you lack the information to make such an assessment.   
---
Again, I've yet to log into an adventure mode server since the patch and see less than a full or near full server.  There's zero evidence to suggest that "normal mode is now a ghost town."
---
I have Migraines too, but suffer no issues playing the game.  Sucks that playing triggers yours.
---
&gt; There is a reason for the lack of living human NPCs, the first part of the story is about discovering what that reason is.
---
The developers can make up whatever the reason they want to justify their game design decisions. Point is the quests are dull, even for MMO standards which is saying something.
---
Prude! /s
---
Do you mean nuclear winter? Because it actually plays out quite well.
---
I think that because of the outdated SFE-"mod" 
---
Haven't tested it yet, but that one got updated today.
---
12 12 3 3 8 9 9 for me
---
Only thing I'd ask for would be a bit more AGI for stealth perks, but I'm fine with my build as it is
---
I think it's free until the end of the week, so if you can download it then try it out!
---
Edit: Free for the week, so you can try it, you would need to buy it at the end of you want to keep playing
---
That's great, while you're arcing through the air people can shoot you down like a clay pigeon.
---
That's one way to avoid any quest bugs!
---
I recommend you start the quests.. Especially the "Make friends with death claw". Ahh Rosey what would we do without you.. Not as much fun at a high level.. but worth investigating.
---
If you can get in the enclave bunker it is in the medic wing. I dont think you need to be a general to get that recipe.  You should become a general though as the vendor behind that gate has cool stuff.
---
I totally agree, fishing for crazy mutated fish would be amazing, especially with the diverse biomes and water locations we have!
---
I went to bethesda's website and got redirected to the PS4 page for it. If you login on the PS4 site you can add it to your account from there
---
I don't care about kills, but when i tell someone 3times, that we are out of zone and he end up burned? Wtf
---
This ones good because you can keep scrapping weapons inbetween the waves(its right in the building next to where the supply drops) 
---
You can get all the early game mods easily this way
---
My biggest pet peeve wasn't the thrashing it got for all the issues. I could understand that. It had many problems and still has some. What really got under my skin though concerning many of the reviews, was the absolute embargo on recognizing ANYTHING postive about 76. The status quo was that it had zero redeemable qualities and zero potential. Which I think was completely bogus from the start. I'm so happy to see that it's starting to get some love outside of smaller, dedicated communities.
---
Darn it. Well have you tried the reporter? I heard she’s willing to help as long as she can get a story out of it.
---
"Fun" to me is roleplaying builds.
---
My Mad Doc is a blast. Energy weapons only. MUST pick up all medical/science related junk (flaks, beakers, Bunsen burners, scalpels, etc). Lots of chems. Mods and gear that appear "high tech" chosen over others, even if they're worse. Etc. Max INT and CHA. Perks are all about healing buffs, and energy damage/ energy damage resistance.
---
MY "cannibal clown" is a walking stereotype. All melee, brutal looking weapons with the most brutal appearing mods. All about massive damage, and the best protection he can get, while limiting his need to gather food and water.
---
My Ghoul character is an experiment in how much I can reduce my reliance on in-game survival mechanics. Reduced damage/rads etc from food/water, increased yield from food and water, increased benefit from food and water. Basically, everything with this character is about being the most wasteland worthy wanderer ever.
---
I like funky builds. Fun builds. Nerfed builds. Builds that make no sense in a world full of power  gamers. I find it super fun, and the game has a solid base for doing it.
---
Glad you're enjoying it.  I play it on and off since launch, but I've always thought it was great.  The vast majority of bad reviews and gripes I saw online were folk regurgitating OTHER people's reviews and gripes.  I'm pretty sure like 200 people said it sucked, and the rest of the world just started repeating it.  
---
Yeah, there were bugs and stuff, just like almost every game ever.  But good grief, the bad press was out of control for absolutely invalid reasons.
---
And now I did.
---
&gt; there were some game breaking bugs
---
What does "game breaking bugs" mean?
---
Wait til this happens... fight, die, recover loot then server disconnects and rolls you back to right after you died but before loot recovery = JUNK GONE!
---
You did pretty damn good. Honestly it doesn't look exactly like the default Nate character preset, but it looks a hell of a lot better anyways. More realistic.
---
So true, and it’s good for building up your early ammo reserves if you use melee to kill them.
---
Yeah that’s crazy, that should have made a major dent in the budget. Sorry that happened to ya but good to know it’s a widespread issue, hopefully they’ll address it in the next update.
---
Looking forward to getting that perk. :)
---
I tried that once with a level 2. Weirdest thing, he saw the bag and went up to it, hovered for a bit and left without it. It was like trying to give a dog who didn’t trust me a treat and watching him sniff it and back away. Take the fucking stimpacks dude!
---
Just put a sock on your doorknob and they will leave you alone.
---
...and paparazzi obviously lol
---
Im level 9 and won a couple matches. I just realized that I've been winning rewards with each level up in addition to the perk cards. I got a picture frame for level 9 but I have no idea what I got before that. I noticed a vault tech univesity skin in the atom store that I now own. Do I need to go through the atom store and just see what is owned? Is there a better way to see my current rewards?
---
Well it's here now. Might as well enjoy it!
---
In the vault there is a display that shows you what the stash boxes look like (small blue, bigger yellow, and large orange with the better stuff in the larger containers) so look for those once you get outside the vault and you have a chance to get them from the usual containers such as duffle bags tool boxes, etc.  Computer terminals can give you a really good weapon too.
---
You're probably right.
---
But, I can at least vouch for 3 new purchases for a couple of friends and myself. Thanks for the free week Bethesda! The media verdict on 76 seems to be fake news.
---
I could see them adding that in game, give a take less damage from ferals or something.
---
The game had game-breaking bugs, to the point that entire account's progress were randomly lost or replaced with other accounts. Then bans started being rolled out for people with high progress because they were suspected cheaters. Half the quests were impossible to complete due to bugs that broke everything.
---
The game was fucking terrible, and so was Bethesda. There are basically 3 hour documentaries painstakingly explaining how terrible the release day was and showing evidence of Bethesda's lies and incompetence. Never forget.
---
Mutated fish fish for vault dwellers...
---
Storage and plans(that might not work don’t know if they fixed that yet or not)
---
The marathoner perk makes nearly no difference and there is no way to increase AP in NW.
---
That needs to change, do you here me BETHESDA!
---
Yes, I think so. It looks like one blue camo is for a laser rifle and one for a revolver.  Unfortunately the names don't say which is which.
---
They can be viewed in this atom shop datamine post under NW Weapons skins-
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/byzmcm/upcoming\_atom\_shop\_items\_nuclear\_winter\_datamines/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/byzmcm/upcoming_atom_shop_items_nuclear_winter_datamines/)
---
Yeah it's annoying tbh because I was really looking forward to this game to try out. I will say 3rd person is a little better, but I play alot of FPS games and prefer 1st person. Guess well see how this plays out
---
I have played several hours of the new battle royale mode with zero issues.  It's the most stable I've ever seen servers.
---
This is doubly shocking to me because not only is it a new game mode - it's a free week so there's a much heavier server load than normal.
---
Either they fixed some things (I hadn't played in awhile) or they made sure at least NW was rock solid.
---
Any way to turn off anti aliasing as well? The smoothing affect on the environment between running and then stopping is nauseating as well
---
Less than a minute.  My team spawned in a location with about another dozen people.  It was a massacre.
---
Same issue(s) here too.. !!ALL!! of the counters have bugs. There should have been a SQL script to include ALL Prior items in the count unless it's repeatable. I see this as a complete failure on the dev side and it's completely foreseeable that this was going to be/and IS an issue. This is the only item that I fault the dev team on.
---
Welcome to real gaming. Where your rank does not matter and the kills don’t matter ether. I hate the “get good” argument but it goes down to find a method that works for you.
---
As a fanboy apologist I had a perfect launch, no bugs (save the odd disconnect now and then) or game breaking stuff. I know everyone did not have the same experience, but mine was good and fallout 76 has always been a solid game for me.. differs i suppose
---
Well, sucks. But don't throw a fit about it. Some things you can't change.
---
Gamechanger!
---
I'm sure it also includes PB and J
---
Trying to build a list of all the rewards here:   [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bzdotz/nuclear\_winter\_rewards/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bzdotz/nuclear_winter_rewards/)
---
It gives me eye pain, head ache... There is tutorial how to turn all of them, but you will have to edit ini file... It blows my mind, releasing new content without adding such features for long time! [https://www.gosunoob.com/fallout-76/fo76-how-to-disable-blur-depth-of-field-pc/](https://www.gosunoob.com/fallout-76/fo76-how-to-disable-blur-depth-of-field-pc/) follow this article, it worked for me, i just added these in my ini file, now i have no bloom or blurr, which is great. Altho it doesnt remove everything, there might be still some bloom
---
Dang, I'll help out with the making of this list for you! I'm currently level 27, so the level 25 is a hot rod flames paint for the laser rifle, and level 26 is a vault boy camera player icon, 27 is... a perk pack, 28 is a ring of fire photo frame, 29 is a slocum's joe x01 paint, and 30 is a perk pack.
---
How can you unlock the cool PW skin displayed in the waiting lobby?
---
*shrug*
---
IM on PS4.
---
Well it’s called recoil in other games so don’t see a problem. Also no clue(?)
---
Edit wait you mean the god rays?
---
Same here when I informed my housemate and explained it was for a coat he said he understood he also said he once wiped out a whole faction for that coat.
---
I disagree
---
Oh, my.. we are some really ... really... sick puppies!
---
Open the social option in the main menu.
---
thanks for complaining enough to get me a free game :)
---
Oof. Yeah I haven't been instantly killed yet. But I also have not won one yet
---
Create the team in the main menu.
---
Sometimes reviving will lead to everyone on the team dead, not all the time tho.
---
I did this and a guy disconnected, probably thought I was a stalker.
---
Same here, but when I went to make room in my camp for it I ran into a new budget issue. Wish I could place any of the new camp stuff but I’m staying at max budget no matter how much stuff I delete
---
You only know if the game is fun if you play it. I wish that every gaming company would allow people to play a game for free before they make the final choice.
---
Bethesda made a smart move for this week and making it 50% off.
---
Like I said, you're still talking thousands of hours of labor for what would be minimal improvements. We have no idea what the state of the game would be if it had 4 more months of the same set of eyes developing the game, but based off just about every other online game ever released, having millions of players is much faster/resource efficient than having your developers do several more months of QC. 
---
I get that some people have less tolerance for launch day bugs, but those people are probably better off waiting a month or two to get into a game than trying to play at launch with any online game. Plus you might save some money waiting, especially with a fall release. I got Battlefield 5 in December for $30, and Fallout 76 was also heavily discounted on Black Friday.
---
and didn't charge me $60 to play it.
---
Congrats. You are one of the minority who actually enjoy the game and/or haven't run into a slew of killer bugs.   
---
Enjoy.
---
Perfect IV Pokémon aren't 'broken', they're just minmaxed out the arse. That isn't the issue, and trying to balance a game like Pokémon  is an impossible task anyway.
---
&gt; It being laggy and slow is also part of the users internet bandwidth as well,
---
Any time I say that I get jumped on by people crying "my internet is perfect, I play lots of other online games and have no problems".  Well, I play FO76 (and have since beta) and I don't see all those problems.  I wonder why.
---
It was a garbage fire at launch.
---
Does it always happen? Have you tried finding the friend on the map and clicking the player dot to fast travel instead?
---
Uhh, doesn't it take like 4 shots from a rifle to kill them though?
---
Agreed! 
---
Not being able to ping equipment or enemy locations is rough after playing games like Apex and Fortnite, even with team communication. It’s just more precise. Hopefully that’s something they have in their plans to add for the beta/final version, so they can patch it up to modern br standards, because I am really loving the mode! The emote wheel just isn’t too helpful or convenient in the state it is right now.
---
Pls add, BGS +1!
---
Would be nice. My friends don’t play this game anymore and I have been doing a solo play with a Co-op PA build.
---
&gt; Because it's the new norm
---
I mean, consider how games have evolved over the years, how they've progressed from linear level designs, 2D sprite graphics, and cartridges to open worlds, 3D models, and downloadable content.  Models are expected to be increasingly-realistic.  Extra content is expected every quarter instead of every 1-2 years.
---
And yet consumers would probably riot if video game publishers tried to charge a cent over $60 for a game on release.  It's become incredibly prevalent in the video game industry to make this money up in other ways; By providing the opportunity to buy additional content that wasn't included in the base game, by releasing the game before it's finished and continuing to work on it while revenue starts coming in, by underpaying and overworking the developers, etc.
---
Yea I noticed it was a hit with RDR2, players liked the fishing aspect of it and it doesnt seem too crazy to implement
---
Level 83 here... As stated by others, ammo does get easier later in the game (SBQ fights notwithstanding). At low levels, some of the best ways to find ammo are:
---
1. Look for ammo-carrying enemies like scorched (Morgantown Airport, Charleston, New Gad, Kanawha Nuka Cola, etc.) and super mutants (Grafton, Grafton Dam, Summerville, Charleston Capitol, Eastern Regional Penitentiary, etc.)
---
2. Collect lead, steel &amp; gunpowder by tagging the needed junk in your Pipboy component view.  Look for barbells, paint cans (not empty), combination wrenches, pencils, rat poison, makeshift batteries, and children's toys. Super mutants and (dead) Raiders carry gunpowder. Also check this list: [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_junk\_items](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_junk_items)
---
   1. At level 13, get the "Scrapper" INT perk so you net more steel every time you scrap a weapon.
---
   2. Look for lead node. There's one at Lakeside Cabins (also a workshop), Poseidon Energy plant (also workshop) north of Grafton Dam, and north of Grainger Farm. You can grab 3-4 lead from a node without setting up an extractor. Check this Reddit link for maps: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmwpx9/mappalachia\_my\_project\_which\_can\_automatically/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmwpx9/mappalachia_my_project_which_can_automatically/)
---
3. Search for ammo boxes at every lookout tower and fortification you see.
---
Not too sure to be honest, that’s definitely an area they need to improve on. But for sure you do get rewards leveling up is what I’ve learned, the question is what are they. Hopefully they elaborate on this at some point
---
Shhh, don’t spoil the secret.
---
Well the error is on the map, using social or ctrl+tab works fine.
---
You could put one together yourself, maybe?
---
Most people will call a game trash because it's bad at release, once they fix bugs and improved the game, those people have stopped playing, so they have no view of what the actual game is like.
---
It's gonna be a pretty high level, doubt anyone will get it before the sneak peek ends.
---
&gt; the following months of nerfs were worse. now things are finally where they should be.
---
So now they've nerfed stuff (stealthily I suppose) now it's where it should be?
---
Somebody please stop him and hand him a decent weapon.. For some reason... His laser works better in DC than in WV!
---
The bonus damage is not gone. A know issue. They are fixing it.
---
Did you see the Wastelanders trailer? That's what it looks like it's gonna become
---
Harder than you think when someone's firing a 50 cal at you.
---
Competition is what makes the BR games fun, if not its be easy. After a few weeks people will be less nooby and will pick up on how to play better, theres still a lot who are logging in for the first time ever, and it could be the first BR they have even played
---
The game has changed a fair amount since it’s early days. If you have the game ready to go there’s no harm in booting it up and having a look around at what’s new
---
3 eyed fish from Simpsons lol
---
I think you have to do that quest to be able to participate in the breach and clear event. Could be wrong though?
---
Either way, the event is worth doing now and then for massive amount of ore
---
They always say the loudest people are the least intelligent. I still havent tried it myself, but i never played any cod, or any other death match game since quake 2. I really like fallout the way it is keeps me entertained, and basically went Fo4 from release till rdr2 came out, then a bit of that now fo76.
---
And I’m talking at least 30-50 different kind of fish!
---
yes
---
Had the same issue yesterday.
---
Oh yeah I forgot to mention the weapons and equipment! I hate having to fling the follow/gift emote when I drop a barely visible set of scout armour in a paper bag.
---
i just feed them nukashine and randomly toss orbital strikes
---
It doesn't *mean* that, but that was the truth of the matter.
---
I've been a long time fallout fan, and grabbed it right around when it came out. Did it have a couple of bugs? Sure. Literally every fallout game has as well. But it was nothing near as bad as everyone made it out to be. It became a meme that the game was bad, so nobody reviewing it for the internet even bothered to develop their own opinion of it, they heard it was buggy so they played til they hit their first bug and ran with that. Myself, I didn't see a single problem until about 50 hours into the game, where I got stuck on some terrain, which just required a restart, then I kept playing for a good long time until some other game pulled me away.
---
Hating on fo76 became such a meme that nobody bothered to actually review it. Why would they, when they could get more views by reposting the same glitches everyone had found and talking about how awful the game was?
---
I would definitely try out a Mistress of Mysteries build if I were you, you can get the gear by level 25 and level it up with you. Replace the Voice of Set with the Fixer for a more suitable legendary weapon for that build. Make a stealthy character with both melee and ranged sneak attacks. The Blade of Bastet is one of the strongest 1-H weapons you can get, as it's the only weapon (even with perks, mods, and the anti armor legendary effect) with 100% armor piercing in the game. it still won't one-shot but pick up Adrenaline Rush and you won't have any trouble. The Fixer will make your sneak even better than walking and the buffed up suit will make your stealth increase by 50%. The Voice is only good for robots but they'll come up from time to time. Phantom Devices are fun and there's also the veil of Mysteries for a gas mask with no downsides
---
You may want to download a program that optimize games for you.  I don’t play on my PC much(poor) but when I do that program makes all of my games run smooth like butter.(sorry my southern came out)
---
Geez this sub has devolved recently. To answer your question, most of those stash box looking rewards are just player icons you can select in the atomic shop. One is a small stash box for your camp. The rewards aren’t very descriptive but they’re usually just icons, camp items, picture frames, or weapon/armor skins
---
Now that you have access to certain areas of Vault 51 do you have any lore tidbits you can share? maybe make a post similar to this about the lore of the vault or cool holotapes/terminals you've found in the closed off areas?
---
Honestly I couldn't hit the side of a barn even standing right in front of it yet, I've ranked within the top 5 in 90% of the games I've played, why? Because I don't kill, lol I let everyone else kill each other till I'm the last of the few teams. Most of the random people I'm grouped with die within the first 5 mins. I'm lvl 7 and killed 5 people.
---
it's the same wheel since skyrim, it works well enough but there's definitely a learning curve to using it quickly
---
It’s actually every other day. Next one should post today for the T-45 I believe.
---
I'm on PC. But I read previously something about a top demos or trials menu. Then sort by date added.
---
Kill it or them before you get to that point.
---
Some people got stuck in infinite load screen loops that basically made it impossible to play their character
---
The damage bug (enemies become invincible, regenerate any damage you deal to them except with melee until you leave the server) was a huge issue, especially during the scorchbeast queen fight. It's rare but still exists
---
There was an issue a while back that got you stuck inside a broken power armor frame - you couldn't equip power armor pieces and got no benefits from the frame, but you were stuck inside it and could not put on regular armor either. There was thankfully a tedious workaround for it though
---
I would count all of the duplication bugs as game breaking, survival mode is a toxic shitshow when you have half the server running around with the exact same cloned version of a bloodied explosive weightless handmade.
---
A few people got glitched into being completely invincible with 0hp and a full rad bar, and took some nice screenshots inside fissure sites (which is an instakill zone). They couldn't die due to anything. 
---
I'm probably forgetting some more, but these are the biggest ones off the top of my head
---
Damn that's a good bubblegum one lol
---
Yeah but motion blur sliders and antialiasing options are something games have had for how many years? How hard is it for a developer to allow modifications or turning off of these items? Pretty ridiculous if you ask me.
---
Thanks I will go for a handmade and see what happens.
---
Yeah, almost everyone I came across shot me repeatedly and chased after me when I noped outta there, even if we had just finished working on something together. But like I said, it was super early on, people were still figuring out the game just like I was, and none of the voice chat worked in my game all through and well after the beta so I might have been missing something.
---
I’m confused. In what way?
---
Also bugged.  It took them months of knowing about bugged Dailies to finally fix Heart of the Enemy while ignoring Queen of the Hunt and the rest of the mire dailies.  It's frustrating as a mainly PVE guy.
---
Repeatables (vs. Dailies) were introduced probably as a new system to help them avoid whatever was causing bugged dailies.  And now they've managed to bug a Repeatable.  I understand the bug parts one still works but it's ridiculously annoying.  I don't need more repellant, bug grenades, and plans for mounted insect heads.  The chance for the badges isn't worth the time investment.
---
Pompy I did because it was a nice quick little quest...of course it was also bugged prior to this, I always have some amount of mutagenic toxic waste in my inventory and the quest would start at 2/5 or 3/5.

I love all three modes... Right now, N.W. is cool because it's still new \[I suck at it though, sometimes I get lucky, lol\] It's brutal but fun. Adventure mode is the Classic...  Survival is like a shittier version of that \[I say Shittier in the sense that I die more often and lose aid items\] but with +20% exp, it's worth it to me.   :-D     
---
So we have the three modes. Which is cool, in less than a year we've got three...  Imagine how many more modes are coming later on down the road. Will we end up with four? Five? Ten? 76 modes? I can only imagine.
---
Only the pipe rifle has a drum? 
---
The bolt is more like the hunting rifle
---
Everybody loved Piper... at least until you met Cait! then you can steal the world and it's ok! Ya baby.
---
Yea I kinda like it. I was just under the impression that nothing carried over. So there is more incentive to grind the base game for the sake of br.
---
&gt;  it was advertised as AAA title 
---
Where?
---
They update the atom store whenever in the day they want - thats how I lost out on the bonus atoms + coat deal yesterday. I purchased the 1000 atoms after they advertised it but apparently before they updated the store (I purchased about 9 - 10am) and after opening a ticket they denied me basically saying it wasnt live yet, too bad.
---
Thanks man I really appreciate it. Finally someone who understands and isnt just gonna white knight their favorite game lol
---
"Mom he do it again"
---
It would make sense, I’ve seen live fish in the pond at white springs where the Mirelurks spawn. Maybe we can catch that dolphin looking thin that was chewed up on the shore in fallout 4 as well as 76
---
great, so that people are encouraged, great images compilation = D, I was taking it in text with some curious perks.
---
Can I attach it there and give you credit?
---
I did and I had (and I'm still having) fun with the game.
---
I feel ya. For me, it's flashing lights in patterns, or sound layering. (Ie. Bgm, radio, and random people talking)
---
All I can say is, it's probably not for you but there are lots of other options out there to play. Good luck on finding a non migraine game. 😀
---
Most efficient method for gifting to those without mics I've found so far is:
---
1. Get their attention with the gift emote.
---
2. When they're looking at you, quickly drop your gifts.
---
3. Switch to first person, take out a weapon and look down at your gift bag. (They can't see you looking up or down if you stay in 3rd person)
---
4. Strafe in circles around the bag while looking down at it, flashing your pipboy / pa light at the same time.
---
5. Profit
---
I think it adds to the thrill of the match. I was on the other end of that scenario the other day, saw the other team getting attacked and our team rushed them. I can see how it would suck but I wouldn't want it any other way, I personally believe that the creature numbers are at rookie numbers, they need to get those numbers up.
---
I like your take and continued thoughts on this.  I could see that being compelling for many to be able to play as "the other side" of things.  It feels a little odd to think that everyone if vying for overseer ranking when in fact it could be much more nuanced than that especially with differing abilities.   I want the super mutants ability to fire endless amounts of ammo with minimal reloading.
---
i was avidly against it. i hate BR games. however i tried NW and it's really fun. People can change their minds... doesn't mean they were the minority.
---
&gt; Still has some game breaking bugs thst I'm sure you'll come across
---
Like?
---
I deleted my assassin because she wasn’t as good as I hoped, and I’m about to delete my soldier because he’s too generic and not fun anymore. So my list of characters will soon be: Unarmed tanky brawler, Vault-Tex scientist, lucky sniper, cannibal raider, and stealth commando.
---
so people aren't allowed to change their minds?
---
What are you searching for? They have the game "fallout 76" and a separate "fallout 76 trial" available.
---
So search for fallout 76 trial.
---
As someone who also have color related problems. I know Xbox has a colorblind mode somewhere. PC I’m sure you can tweak it. Don’t know about Sony so PS4 users you need to help with that.
---
If you can, you should do pre-recorded “man on the streets” segments with random wastelanders you find out there.
---
When does that happen, around the 7600 hours mark?
---
It happens for me too :/ 
---
You just have to spam your vats button
---
I was walking around in a cultist outfit with my flaming chainsaw, as one does. I must of spooked a level 5 because he opened fire on me, obviously I Texas chainsaw massacred him then dropped him full gear. Then I messaged him and told him first rule of Appalachia is don't swing first. 
---
Then he asked to team up and I showed him how to bring the power plant online
---
Same, it's a bit annoying when you're trying to find player vendors, but I've also liked giving the new level 2-3 players some food, water, guns and ammo. It's the small things that count I guess
---

Reminds me of how back during the early days when that one Western outfit game out there were guys who made Preston Garvey's, Nate's, Nora's, and even Gary's! The Gary's were the most terrifying however, mostly soundboard users, but they would not stop following you if they saw you.
---
Just kind of thought of it while reading you post.
---
Funny, I would say telling someone actively what is going on would be more direct way instead of 'pinging' something.  Just use a fucking mic.
---
Lol what?
---
Heavy weapons Power Armor specialist and stealth sniper as a lot of others have suggested.  Both are quite different than the melee character you currently run.
---
No. You’ll be fine. It’s in the game and last I checked they(Bethesda) made a statement about it when they supposedly fixed the dev room bug.
---
I've played solo since beta, around 490 hours so far.  Still fun for me.
---
YMMV.  (Which is what many of the critics around here forget).
---
How is competive when i get team that split and burn to ashes outside of zone? Like yeah, but actualy no
---
They can spawn right on top of you. I had the op's exact situation happen earlier. They tend to pop up when it's down to the last few fighters and the combat zone is at it's smallest so what you're suggesting isn't always an option.
---
I get it with artificial blur, low frame rates, lights that have piss poor refresh rates like those old tube lights, etc.
---
Usually as long as I can disable motion blur and antialiasing in a game I can play for hours on my high refresh rate monitor, just have to turn off my 60hz secondary monitor. This game triggered it like 10 mins in ugh
---
The other day i was hanging outside the train station beside the top of the world.
---
i just hit level 41 at the time
---
some random level 115  dropped me a power armor chassis
---
in it was level 50  full kit ultracite power armor
---
I love our community 
---
We bash noobs in survival and nuclear winter , but in the open game everyones awesome!
---
Isn't there more then one perk card that helps with sprinting? Maybe it's going to take more then one card to get it where some people might want it to be.
---
Great, so while you're busy interacting with the emote wheel you'll already be dead.  Instead of just saying you need help while still moving and getting cover.
---
I also find that trying to drop a little ammo (say 100) when you have 500 in inventory takes a LONG time and the newbie will get confused by me just standing there motionless!
---
ROCK AND ROLL IS THE DEVILS MUSIC!
---
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
---
I jumped back in yesterday and was having fun in the NW mode but plan on tooling around in the main game again as well.
---
Aren't there over a hundred levels you can get too?  That's a lot of rewards!
---
I believe Fallout 3 said something about what little fish survived the nukes, or moved into the waters were completely unsafe to consume in any way due to massive mutations, radiation, and the like though. Then again, this game already plays SUPER loose with canon.
---
Yeah, but I mean specifically the strategy of not even entering the play area until absolutely unable to avoid doing so. Or like how there was a bug in one of the major games (I believe PUBG) where the world border closing wouldn't affect you until you took your first step, so people started winning - and in some cases winning multiple rounds in a row - by entering the match, putting their controller down, and going to do something else. Extreme case, I know, but there's still something unappealing to me about a genre where giving it your all can invite failure, while doing as little as possible leads to greater success.
---
I won a match yesterday and I don't remember any specific unlocks, ,but I also turned the game off because I didn't think I was going to manage it twice.
---
Okay buddy ♥️
---
The blue camo? It’s pretty nice, both in NW and definitely in Adventure
---
The hive mind hates any criticism of Bethesda, and I have down vote stalkers lol.
---
Dude are you guys serious? Do you really need a specific context to like or dislike a game mode? Please enjoy the free will that categorize a human being and choose by yourself not depending on what developers say.
---
Imagine that today they create a whole background story that says that this is only simulation then you like the game and you are having a blast and the next day they take it back because they dont like it and now you wont enjoy it anymore?
---
Sounds like rich people problems...
---
To be fair, I actually didn’t. The only thing I said was that anecdotal observations are all we have. I extrapolated nothing, not personally. To be brutally honest, I don’t really care much.
---
But - I didn’t personally say that it was a ghost town at all. I just described what I saw and left it to anyone reading to draw their own conclusions. You’ve seen full AM servers; I’ve not seen the same. At all. In the last 30 hours. NW however - that’s absolutely packed with people.
---
My comment wasn’t about whether or not adventure mode is a ghost town: my point was that disregarding an anecdote as invalid simply through virtue of being an anecdote isn’t  really the best way to establish whether or not adventure mode is a ghost town or not. That’s because none of us have access to the actual data we would need. We are only able to surmise what might be going on.
---
I think you might be ascribing the “ghost town” comment to me erroneously because someone else said it. The fact of our differing experiences don’t actually mean anecdotes are irrelevant in any way, shape or form. Otherwise we have an echo chamber on our hands, where any experience outside the personal is disregarded because they don’t match ours, and nobody but Bethesda has access to the actual data point we need, which is the server distribution of concurrent users.
---
Wasn’t starting a fight - was just making the point that anecdotal evidence is all anyone has. If my observation, or that of the OP is invalid simply through virtue of being based on the experience of a single person, then so is yours, I’m afraid, and you cannot assert that the OP is incorrect either - you have no more information to go on than they do, and you are therefore unable to assert the opposite. 
---
Personally, I think it’s rather more likely that a lot of people including new players are playing NW instead of AM and that you have been “lucky” and had servers that are richly populated, and that the OP and myself have been “unlucky” and had underpopulated servers. 
---
All I was trying to say is that you’re right, but not because of the anecdotal nature of the argument. It’s because the assertion itself cannot be substantiated by anyone on Reddit.
---
I was expecting to suck because I was TERRIBLE when I played BFV's. Wound up winning on my second or third match. I don't think power armor is all it's cracked up to be, so to speak.
---
15 5 2 5 13 8 7
---
I am horrified that I didn't even need the game running to know that. Melee (primarily) and heavy guns. I may want a new character for Wastelanders so I can get that Charisma up.
---
Yeah, I dig the look. Have you earned any other skins?
---
On my first day I became stuck on a table. Took me a solid 10 minutes to realize I could just fast travel away, but yeah, this sucked (and a similar glitch happened to me again about a month ago).
---
You need to watch some different porn.
---
Have you closed the launcher mid download once?
---
👿 Well I'm going to play as much as I can as heads roll
---
Check  the Vendors located at a Train station
---
Yeah, I'm an idiot and assumed you were the person I was originally responding to.
---
Many players are selling Nuclear Keycards for cheap, nothing to worry about.
---
Well yeah, being free and all.
---
I’ll add to this, rank 32 is a good pipboy statue.
---
Definitely first-world problems. :)
---
Ah I see, lvl 14 to 20 shouldn't take ages so I can recommend it
---
Nice post, Todd.
---
Because if yes it Shows you the 18 GB you still have to download as downloaded, you then just have to wait and you have no way of checking how far it is had the same problem once
---
Btw I got the reference from Water Boy 👍
---
Played since day one with my dumb helmet. Fallout forever.
---
Haaa
---
I spent last night helping level 4-6 players with new armor, ammo, and weapons. I was up waaaay to late, but it was worth it!
---
I've lost two games to a nuke. It most definitely is a thing.
---
I totally agree with you on perk cards. Duplicates shouldn't even be a thing either.
---
I work IT as well and agree with you 100%. For example: "This report didn't download". This goes from client to service partner to service manager that finally sends me an email. 
---
I have a look and find that the FTP program that downloads everything isn't running... I end up getting a kudos for "quickly resolving the client's production issue". 
---
Sigh.
---
I mean during beta a week or two before launch is was very bad, that was my judgement anyway, optomization was awful and it just wasnt enjoyable because of it.
---
That being said im glad a waiting til now to play again. Having a great time
---
I get you, but if I wanted to beta-test I would have played during the B.E.T.A, not on release.
---
Well who puts goodies in a paper bag.. Right?
---
I certainly DON'T want my dropped loot looking like a glowing/ wrapped gift box though! I'm sure it would not be there when I re spawned.
---
Bethesda, maybe a mini task would to be require an item in a paper bag to be picked up before leaving the vault. This would be a great training exercise so that at least we higher level dudes(etts) would not have issues having to train every first encounter of helping the little guys(gals).
---
Please
---
It's almost like the game was sabotaged from the beginning eh? It's honestly in a much better place than where it was at launch, the game was dicey with connection issues early on, but since they patched it up, it is a pretty solid game. Enjoy!
---
They should just buff AP regen.
---
im sure they will get to it when its really launched..
---
youre not the first one to mention this...
---
It was at borderless, I changed it to fullscreen
---
It is in game but not as advertised initially. It was sold as a feature where you could choose items to delete in your camp zone. What we ended up with was only partially that.
---
Im gonne play it tonight, but https://youtu.be/kjyeCdd-dl8 (fall of 76 ) isnt all made up right? It was reallyyy bad.
---
I’m having the same issue with anglers, Mirelurk hunters and sting wings. I’m so annoyed. Did you ever figure it out? I also didn’t get credit for completing campfire tales.
---
I use the plants as a simple and easily relatable way to explain a much deeper and more complicated concept:  Bugs that have existed from the very start of the game.  Others, not so simple to fix, in fact are game breaking for many as they are stuck on quests that they still cannot complete.  All Bethesda would have to do is write a script to detect some of the conditions that create this situation and reset the quest for these people.   It's not something I want to get drawn into discussing at depth because it is hard enough to have a simple conversation about easily fixed plants without having someone saying, "uh no that could be a really bad problem if they fix that, it could break a lot of other things."   Uhm, no.  The plants can easily be fixed.  There is something making them different from literally all the other plants in the game and that can be easily changed...it doesn't take 7 months.  Period.
---
Your point about resources and income is fair, but my thought is that if the income is coming in from B.R. garbage, then the money will be spent on more B.R. garbage and the game I bought and paid for will suffer because of it.   I could be wrong.  Time will tell.   Bethesda is doing some things better and there is still room for further improvement.  On the other hand they are paying a lot of lip service to things, too, and it's hard to trust that.
---
I've found combat in Adventure to be worse after the update.  I disagree with the tuning benefiting both projects.   I can kill a scorch beast in about 45 seconds on the ground with melee.   If it is in the air, the absolute best guns that I have after 400+ hours of game play time take 6 to 10+ minutes to bring the beast down.  Months ago they "fixed" the flight patterns of the scorch beasts to make them land more often.  That has not worked correctly for a LONG ass time.  There was a brief period of time where scorch beasts would land.   So now, when I have to deal with a scorch beast I have my perk load out setup for guns and I start unloading a ridiculous amount of ammo at the beast only to be hitting it with what feels like a bb gun.   When it lands I bring out either of my 2 melee weapons (and I'm not fully specced for melee, either) and I end the scorch beast in about 45 seconds.   Their whole firearm weapon system needs a complete overhaul.   Melee weapons work like they should, but firearms are pathetic even with the best firearms and the best perks loaded.   There is 1 weapon that I have that can down a flying scorch beast and that is a 3 star gatling gun.... and about 750 to 1000 rounds of ammo for a level 50 beast.   Pathetic.   This is the best they could do for combat mechanic game balance after 7 months?
---
Oh, I missed the part where you said this was happening shortly after launch.  So that makes perfect sense.  LOL
---
Players are a lot more cooperative for the most part now,  This is partly because anyone wanting to cause you grief really has limited options in Adventure mode to do so.  Slap damage has been removed so they can't even do minimal damage.  Your base cannot be destroyed by anyone who you're not hostile toward and as far as workshops are concerned PvP is now only initiated within the boundaries of the workshop, not anywhere within the world.  It's hard to be a griefer when you're doing zero damage and uyou're intended target is just standing there throwing heart emotes to further piss you off.  haha  And those who were truly interested in PvP pretty much play on the Survival server, which is geared toward that.
---
The game has definitely improved but when it released it was indeed a piece of shit. Let’s try to not ignore that aspect. The game still has a little ways to go in my opinion but it’s definitely miles  better than it was on release.
---
Ironman doesn’t wear a cape
---
Maybe they planted a lot of patches and started to fix their game after they charged 60 bucks and more from other players. Its not like that it has been over 6 month of time for fixing stuff and they actually fixed some stuff.
---
Feed the People for sure.  Depending on how many enemies you have to kill you'll get a decent amount of XP, as well as cans of meat stew that give you +5% experience gained for an hour.  The wolf pack events also have three or four legendary wolves per event, so I'd hit those too!
---
Sounds like wannabe trolls are getting inspiration from "clown video" on Youtube.
---
this is the first Im hearing of it..
---
My concern is spawning, I don’t like when there are two teams on opposite sides of the safe zone, and the scorch beast just hangs over one of the teams instead of both.
---
You're the true Overseer of 76, granted, she taught us through holo tapes, you're there for them just like she was for us.
---
Thanks for sharing your thoughts on it.  I certainly am not trying to tell people that enjoy B.R. not to enjoy it...  I'm just pissed that the money I spent on this game is being used to turn the game into something else instead of fixing all the issues that still plague it to this day.
---
Strange, I've never seen anyone else having this specific issue. At least it looks like you can get around it by simply using Ctrl+tab outside of the map.
---
But aren't they literally developing the Pokemon Home service for that very purpose?
---

Probably get some downvotes in this sub, but as someone who picked the game up only a few months ago it isn't that great even without all the bugs at launch. There are some poorly designed features, such as how if a high level player strolls through then you have to reload the server because you could spend your entire supply of ammo killing a ghoul if they don't one-shot you first. I also had to rebuild my base because it wouldn't let me put it down anywhere, the building system sucks and the build limit is very low. There is nothing to do in the game besides do "quests," loot stuff, build, and hunt for overpowered gear. The quests are cheesy with childish voice acting. The pvp is pointless in open world as there's no balancing to the servers, most people are bullet sponges with crazy builds and weapons, and it isn't that balanced even if they're within 5-10 levels of your character. 
---
It's nice they are introducing human NPCs, and the BR mode is okay because it somewhat balances people and is the first pvp experience I've had in the game that wasn't just one player or group stomping the other completely. The way it is looking though, they really want to make money off this game long-term, which is fine because it will introduce a stream of new content, but have we heard a peep about player generated content or servers that could actually fix a lot of these issues? I honestly believe that when (if) modding support comes it won't be full support because it would make the atom market completely and utterly pointless, thus killing the financial incentive to produce more content. This isn't a paradox game where you're buying new features and modding doesn't matter, this would be modders directly competing with the business model of the game in the same way as GTA5 Online. Hopefully I'm wrong, I'd love to play this game with NPCs, player towns, open world content like faction wars, and mods that add a bunch to the game like with FO 3&amp;4.
---
Think of hunting down the piece of crap who keyed your car. That’s motivation.
---
Yes, The Fixer is good, it is unique with its perks, I would recommend it too. The only downside of The Fixer (in my eyes) is the way it looks with a recon scope.
---
I avoided the game like the plague because of the horrible reviews....7 hours last night and I just ordered it on Amazon.  This was a brilliant marketing move by them.
---
Sadly I think they may be gone.
---
I have action girl, it helps, a smidge
---
My guess is only doing BR. That is what is happening with my group right now. We are only playing BR.
---
I don't think so!!! This kind of talk will only lead to some kinda of commie gun grab. 
---
P.s don't be jelly over the size of my gun.
---
I feel that fo76 was always meant to be a "we'll fix it later game" and ended up being a great example of what you can accomplish even after immeasurable backlash.
---
If anything it might have made it worse...
---
Does anyone know if the possible encounters for the same type of encounters sites can differ within a region? I've been server hopping a lot lately trying to find the responder vendor bot so that I can get the last two pieces of clothing I need from him, and I've noticed that within The Forest some travel locations tend to spawn a greater variety of encounters than others. For example, at the site just outside of Flatwoods, west of the 86B marker on the map, I've only seen five or six different things (super mutants, responder eyebot, pied piper eyebot, responder announcer bot, and the vendor bot) in probably 60 or 70 runs. At other sites in more "difficult" areas of The Forest, like Janet's Soft Serve and the Charleston Train Station there seem to be quite a few more possible encounters. I've had much better luck finding the vendor bot near Flatwoods and the Vault than in the areas on the periphery of The Forest. Is this just random chance? Is there any information about this accessible in the data files?
---

Yeah it's kinda disappointing. I really don't want to play adventure mode, but now I'm being forced to

I assumed that meant containers IN nuclear winter. I think a lot of people reading it will do the same.

---
You forgot all the game breaking bugs. The server crashing multiple times everyday and all those issue that they fixed but the game at launch didn't deserved more than 5.
---
Unless you join a PvP server, claim a workshop, or join a team of sketchy strangers, the game basically makes trolling worthless and futile.  The worst you can do is explode cars near people.  You can't deal damage directly and you can't block their path.
---
The problem with a lot of other survival games is that raiding/killing is a great way to steal resources and is essentially encouraged.  Bethesda is one of the first studios to want the player base to work together more than kill each other.
---
Not sure.  I've heard anwhere from 30 minutes to a couple hours, but that's just hearsay and I've never really tested it.  That being said, Charleston can be a really good location for screws, even if the little box of loose screws isn't in the train station.  The Charleston Herald, for example, has a decent amount of typewriters and desk fans in it you can loot (most office buildings will).  And the Charleston Landfall workshop has a few junk nodes within its boundaries (3 if memory serves me correct).  If you claim the workshop, you can drop some junk extractors on the nodes, hook them up to generators, and let them pull your wonderful junk up outta the ground for you.
---
Yeah still calling B.S. on the whole "special weekly challenge". Knowing the completionists in this community I bet one of them would've piped up sooner if it was available that way. Probably suffers from the same fate as the Assault Marine Helmet (Not the Tactical Wetsuit Helmet), that being it was supposed to be in a reward pool, but never appears.
---
The BR mode? I might prefer the soulless grind over that.
---
By gallery, do you mean a location other than the game files?
---
As far as we know, it's still in the works and it's coming with the next round of content. Pretty sure it was still on the road map, I made a post just like this one a few weeks back. 
---
The prestige system most likely will just reset your level, you'll probably still keep all your perk cards but cant use them until you gain your respective levels back. Same with gear. 
---
Or, they have held it off because they are actually redesigning a bunch or all of the perks to have a legendary version that you earn while leveling up the second time. But that would probably make you crazy op and wouldn't fit well for pvp balance. 
---
I imagine they'll stick with the reset levels to gain a passive legendary trait, then gain your levels back to reassign your perk cards plan though
---
Thank you so much for your help!
---
Go back and read the advertisements for Fallout 76 and see very plainly that it is an adventure game with light PvP elements.   Your pivot to talk about a different team (working for the same damn company) has no bearing on this.   The building they work at have no bearing on this.   Do you or do you not have any information about how the team sizes have changed and what resources were devoted to which parts of the game?   No?  Yes?   If not, then you're just sharing what you believe to be true just like anyone else, but you're also shitting all over other people for daring to disagree with you and for holding an opinion you don't like.   Sod off.
---
Thank you! This community is awesome. Everybody has been very helpful :)

Thank you!  That worked.

"You're not playing that Striking Vipers game again, are you?"

I did this in one match, built a house with three rooms side by side so when they walk in they just see three doors. I hide behind one with my gun drawn waiting to shoot. I got two kills this way, just waiting on them to open the door I was hiding in. Then someone shot the floor out from under me and I fell to my death...
---
To sprint.

Well angry Joe and the rest of the community we're getting at a point that has SAILED right over your head.

STOP RELEASING UNFINISHED GAMES FOR FULL PRICE AND STRUTTING AROUND LIKE YOUR SHIT DONT STINK.
---
And the only way to tell them this is with our wallets.
---
It has no major issues, but a ton of minor ones.
---
People seem to forget that they seriously sold this as a full price game. It’s not. It’s cool when you get it for free, but I can understand everyone who says that this game sucks.
---
It still has a long way to go, but it’s getting there.
---
What they were doing was illegal. They released an incomplete product and when many people wanted refunds they decided to stop giving them out half way, illegal.

I wonder what level unlocks the Hellfire armor and supposedly the Anti-Material Rifle
---
I've been told Zealot's doesn't work on SBQ, but haven't tested that myself.
---
I love love love the power armour person looking confused into their empty frog jar... with frog on head. 
---
LOVE it.
---
Endgame is what you make it. Minimal content so far, but more planned on roadmap.
---
I pre-ordered this game fully knowing I would probably have to give it a year to really shine. When it launched, I played about an hour and kept running into griefers. I finally ran into someone who wanted to group and couldn't for the life of me figure out how to accept the invite. He got frustrated and started chasing me down punching me whenever I stopped to do something. That's when I put the game down to wait for improvements.  
---
I just started a new character yesterday and am looking forward to exploring the world. I got to Flatwoods before I had to logoff for bed. If anyone is looking for someone to roam with on PC, I'd be happy for the company. PM me for info.
---
Then try to be happy when the game crashes.
---
Currently, I use the taunt emote to tell others when I see an enemy, but most of the time they don't get the real message.
---
It's all online. You can play on your own though. I find myself not in a team quite often.
---
It never sucked, it was released way too early.
---
There's a blue Vault-Tec backpack on one of the couches you can sit on in Vault 51- anybody seen that in the rewards?
---
Not always. I found one on a Scortcher.
---
That’s fine. I’m sure there’s some fun to be had.
---
I can Sprint
---
Destiny 2 and Halo as well as star wars battlefront 2 are dead according to the internet. I agree with your definition, people throw "dead game" as soon as there is something they don't like.
---
I mean there are giant fish in the rivers next to Chernobyl irl lol
---
Yeah they made a statement a while back that it was supposed to be in the reward pool for one of the quests/events in the mire or something a while back, but because of a coding error was never dropped. It's fine having them and even selling them.
---
Oh for the love of blumpkins are you always this angry about weightless things people say? What's your homelife like. Do you have a lot of stress?
---
I started cause it's free, will be sticking around.
---
I agree with your idea but GOT deserves every bit of hate it's getting if you ask me.
---
Yeah, a big problem with internet reviewers is that so many take on a persona to be more entertaining. Often they exagerate as a part of the character, but people miss that it's not 100% genuine.
---
Gaming Media. Gaming Media never changes.
---
Not much aside from nukes or high level events. But later this summer raids are coming when some vaults open.
---
Tapping shift works for me and my friend for cancelling sprint...it's weird you have the issue.
---
just as an after thought, If your still near flatwoods, then that event will also give you plans/teach you to make disease cures. you want to do that. If you cant find a certain ingredient, then toddle back up the road past the overseer's camp. (minimum spoilers).
---
I always thought it would be awesome to have a Flaming Grognak Axe.
---
Its in the game but it isn't supposed to be in the game.
---
The only PVP that I've done in the game was the Nuclear Winter mode. 
---
Heck, even when I went into survival mode (which is the pure PVP portion of the game) to do a weekly challenge for a weapon I didn't run into any PVP. Now granted, I didn't hang out there long. I did what I needed to do and was in and out in a few hours. But I didn't do any PVP there.
---
Came here to say exactly this. This game's loads of fun!
---
Actually, they always update the shop at 5 PM PST, like clockwork.
---
Not sure if it's still the case, but it used to be that the trick is you have to quit the game and relaunch it in order for the shop to refresh from the server.
---
The exception is the new items that get launched at the start of a new week / update period, and those will start in the morning after the maintenance is over.
---
This would make it a lot easier for when I sell all lootable items from the Whitespring back to the Whitespring
---
It’s a super fun game - I’ve been with it almost daily since BETA. It had ups and downs along the way and at launch it was pretty damn rough. But after all this time it has improved significantly and Bethesda has been awesome at listening to feedback. 
---
Enjoy it!!
---
You’ll need to get to level 15 if you want to place 2 points into each SPECIAL. That may take you a few evenings playing tbh
---
&gt; Just take a few moments and really think, and I mean REALLY THINK, about the sort of person who would become a professional "video games reviewer." 
---
Charlie Booker.
---
FWIW, based on a buttload of pubg, 90% of what people say is irrelevant or bad Intel anyway, even with experienced players
---
Yes, except at this point it's only for Pokémon that already appear in the Galar Dex.
---
You can earn exp for adventure mode in the nuclear winter mode.
---
But it’s already programmed, coded, and had a texture. Hell we can’t obtain it because of a programming bug.  No harm is having it.
---
That is awesome, one time I made 4 decoy houses and watch as an enemy team searched each one while I hid in a bush off in the distance, and then used the grenade launcher on them.
---
My last perk card was Action girl with a 60% buff- NICE.
---
It's not obvious that that is the name of the game, since rain is weather and it rains in video games
---
And this is why gaming journalism needs to fucking die. It kills games that never deserved it.
---
Does a level in NW count as one level up in Adventure? I played a little NW last night, got to level 6 but my character in Adventure didn't advance?
---
You just have to go to adventure mode to put them in.
---
I wouldn't hold my breath for the moment, it's likely to be released around the time Wastelanders is for an increase in sales now that there will be NPCs, if anyone wants to get a head start and doesn't care about steam it's better to just buy it now.
---
Pretty sure the nuclear winter Battle royale is meant to be a beta. Access into vault 51 within adventure will release when the nuclear winter dlc actually drops.
---
Nah. Cait annoys the FUCK out of me more than Piper
---
Learned the lesson about the fire the hard way.  I saw it early, but didn't think I'd have to actually run for it until it was on me.  Cut to two minutes later and I'm desperately running through the Flatwoods clearing, watching my health bar in one glance and seeing the fire outpacing me in front in the other.
---
Do not try to outrun the fire.  Fear the fire.
---
Oh damn. Thanks
---
There are no mags available for the bolt action.  Learn the mags for pipe rifle by scrapping.
---
If you get tired of that pipe (and on PC) I would be interested in buying it.
---
30 is a Skeleton profile pic

31 is a perk pack

Post-apocalpytic world problems :D
---
IS BDSM sick? Then yes. I am sick as hell
---
Yes, feel free!
---
I will try to update it more ASAP.
---
I play on console and I haven’t noticed anything quite like that. I’ll keep my eyes out for it now though.
---
currently scrounging/grinding legendary gear for it
---
Method role playing.
---
Oh right I completely forgot about that. Thanks
---
I've managed to make this post surprisingly controversial...
---
Everything is fun with friends. If your game is relying on that it is a bad game.
---
I have so much respect for the players in the queue who just walk over to a chair and sit the F down while the timer runs down and the idiots in their underwear punch each other.
---
Ok Thanks
---
counter point: they will soon become higher level and they'll need your stuff
---
That doesn't mean it's impossible to make it habitable again. It's all machinery and I can apparently make a fusion generator from a bunch of tin cans, a couple of lamps, a robotic toy pony and some board games.
---
Just make a week-long event where players can repair vault 76's systems and unveil it as a communal/trade hub, preferably on it's own server so you can have more people in it, maybe a mailbox or account-based storage for exchanging items with alts, some mini-games(make pool, darts, board games functional, etc.). Could be nice.
---
My point is that it takes too long between matches. And you need to have quite a few matches before anything new unlocks in the vault. So you're doing nothing for 2+ mins after everyone has already gathered.
---
Yea that's why I mentioned it! ^^
---
Oh.  Lame.
---
*\*launches nuke\**
---
**GIVE ME MY SON! GIVE ME SHAUN** ***NOW***
---
.... Because it's not the full DLC yet. You can access it and get all the lore when it drops. This is a beta.
---
I think you earn XP for your character but unsure how much per game. Haven’t managed to get on the new game mode yet. 
---
You might have jumped a few levels though. So maybe hop into adventure to see if you can level anything up
---
It's really a competition sport. If you've played Call of Duty TDM or FFA, or even Counterstrike, it's the same concept.
---
Pro tip, if on console (Xbox/ps4) use the right and left bumpers on the controllers to adjust the number at a faster rate.
---
The only meme that they are truly referring to is themselves being stupid and circlejerking. It's so disappointing reading comment sections on anything official anymore because no one has respect for the actual humans behind things.
---
if you use mods disable the perkcard manger,ba2
---
No, but you do get adventure XP every match. Look at the bottom of the summary to see the XP and caps. Last night my team won and I got \~1500 XP for that match. After a few matches I popped over to adventure and saw I leveled up.
---
Laymen gaming?? I usually don't mind the channel but the obnoxious bashing of 76 based off of the release is stupid and just makes them look  foolush.
---
It's so that if you plan poorly you can't outrun the fire.
---
Got it, thanks!
---
That’s why going to YouTube for opinions is silly. Watch the actual gameplay and decide for yourself. The comments section on every website is toxic and usually devolves into someone calling someone else Hitler
---
This post is 9 hours and nobody suggested wearing headphones? That way family won't hear and you'd be able to take them off or, depending on the headphones, turn the volume down until the game starts.
---
Do you play on PC? I do, and have rarely ever disconnected as well but see constant complaints of disconnecting. After reading some comments, I find that most often its console players who have the issue.
---
No that does, you have to decide, magic carpet or new decos?!
---
Okay. I hope you have a nice day. :)
---
That's what I've been hearing.
---
Lmao yeah I thought the BOS was the only interesting faction in FO4 but I wiped them off the face of Earth for the coat as well haha
---
Send me a friend request if you want.  We can run around some high level areas and pick off big ticket targets...provided you can work as a team and patient enough to follow basic instructions.  You'll need a mic, mandatory.
---
You or anyone else.  I can get you at least one level up every 30-45 minutes.
---

kay
---
Cheers, people are weird here.
---
A couple? A couple? You played on release don’t bullshit me, I crashed every 1-2 hours, my base would load in destroyed or not at all, other people vanishing or standing still and not taking damage while on their end they’re butchering you. The grind sure was fun too, and very well balanced. All those amazing quests available on release, like the secret society one and the... others. Yeah, you’re right all game reviewers were being hysterical and not critiquing the game fairly at all, it was flawless, perfect, 120 FPS, with amazing multiplayer mechanics and quests on release. The game fucking crashed and burned for a reason, I’m glad it’s coming back up, but you’re the same kinda guy who’s saying that No Man’s Sky was actually super great on release but people panned it because that was a popular opinion. That’s not how this works, that’s not how any of this works, we wanted the game to be great, it flopped, now we gotta figure what’s next.
---
I saw a post yesterday that I cant find now..
---
they guy said even though it doesnt auto switch the damage bonus still applies?
---
I havent seen anyone else mention that though so I dont know if its true.. if so I might prefer it that way.. lol
---
Sorry to hear it isn't for you.
---
Luckily, there are many games out there!
---
SERIOUSLY AGREE. Because they reduced fall damage, they should buff stamina while running. we have to get across wide areas with no cover and we have no armor on let us sprint a few seconds longer please
---
Good bait but unwelcome
---
You can find one, but there are no quest reward weapons that are explosive. I don't think we've had a survival weapon that was explosive either. You might get lucky with a 2* or higher enemy (explosive is a secondary effect), but your best bet would be trading for it
---
also.. I have not encountered invisible mobs yet myself
---
The numbers, Mason, what do they mean?
---
That's accurate!
---
I think highest terminal lock level was 105 that I’ve seen.
---
I think one of us is misunderstanding the other. You said "food stacks" which as far as I know isn't true. For example, you can't eat glowing meat steak and yao guai ribs and have the bonus melee damage from both active at the same time. One will cancel the other out.
---
Claiming a workshop is pretty much always worth it. Costs 25 caps to claim (you get 20 for clearing out the enemies), and as a reward you get a mix of stimpaks, purified water, resources, and plans. The only exception is if some other player already claimed it earlier, it will cost more depending on how much stuff they built
---
Your complaining about the game being bad.....then admit you play anthem! Laters anyway
---
Do you need those materials? Then yes. No? Then no. It's not that hard.
---
Nah, doubting there will be free vault exploration. You'll need ranks anyway to see anything of value.  
---
I don't know why you guys have the expectation to see content without completing quest lines to see it.
---
You easily make back the caps for claiming a workshop after doing the defend event. Claiming it also gives you new camp plans.
---
Weird flex but ok
---
Juicehead seems to have chilled the fuck out though.
---
Check the map... it'll tell you what resources are available (ignore the food one)… do you need any of that stuff? If so, then yes. Claim it.
---
If not, then no. Don't.
---
But, remember, all workshops are PvP ground.
---
True, but you can also buy the game for like $15-20 right now. If you played for a week and liked it, that is about as low of a cost barrier to keep playing as you get
---
Thank you. I was against 3 other people,I got sniped and the beast finished me off. 
---
I'd really prefer to die by a person than mob enemies.
---
I would. The junk extractors can be really helpful. Plus the defense quests generally give out a plan for your camp. 
---
The industrial farm near Flatwoods is good too. There is a junk extractor and you can make rad-free food.
---
Lol Anthem? Really?
---
It’s up to you. I usually claim them for the free plans and then let them go. If pvp is your thing, take it and defend it
---
Edit.... but in the big picture, you really don’t need to claim workshops
---
This person asked for advice. Not a lecture.
---
IGN xXJohnnyMechXx, US Central time evenings.
---
At this point I don't even know exactly what you have or its level so I can't give you a number.  Tell me what you have and a price.  I'll be fair with you.
---
They are always active about topics they like yet they totally ignore others no matter how much community attention it has.
---
Well it looks like there’s raiders and settlers, so hopefully?
---
Added feature, makes death have more consequences.
---
Just kidding, I am also on PC and have not ever had this issue. Maybe try lowering your graphic settings or submitting a ticket with the crash file. You can generate a diagnostic file from the launcher settings.
---
I'd rather play fo76 than that pile of dog shit called anthem
---
You went BACK to Anthem? That is my first thought. That is a trash game, played it and beat the mess out of it. You should really give Fallout 76 more time, you have easily 100+ hours but exploring and doing the main quests. Now that we have a multiplayer that is worth it in Fallout 76, it's the best it has ever been.
---
It's pretty obvious...
---
Good luck with that, I'm already lvl 16 playing casually.
---
I believe it's an icon
---
NW may make more sense for you after wastlanders arrives and you get factions like settlers and raiders moving into the area.
---
Yea that definitely needs to be fixed but for now you can always just clean out your friends list later.
---
Lol I actually have been doing something kinda similar. Since my style of play means I'm consistantly carrying around 500lbs of junk I usually go to every CAMP I can find and repair all their stuffs.
---
Someone else said he gave leniency to the division 2 and ubisoft even though that game was just as fucked as this was at launch. Almost as if he isn't really sincere about his shenanigans
---
Yes, we need basic social tools so bad.
---
Lately what I’ve done is turn the mic on and get some trades.
---
Traded a couple of plans (power armor station and large toolbox) for over 2500 shotgun shells.
---
Much better than waiting for someone to show up and buy them.
---
Same. That stupid sonic attack thing they do is crazy powerful.
---
Press "Y" to join a new lobby in progress. It would be so nice.
---
That was hardly a lecture.
---
As someone who tried hard and put about 40+ hours between the game and the beta, I can tell you it sucked. I knew it was going to have bugs but they made the game literally unplayable (constant crashing). I was willing to overlook the fact that I couldn’t complete missions alone anymore, or that there were glitches that caused deathclaws and the flying bastards to destroy me anywhere I went, but what has caused me to stop playing is that those issues weren’t getting fixed after months of waiting. I’ll jump on again to see what’s new, but my expectations are very low.
---
I have never claimed a workshop and unless its right after I go on a huge crafting spree.. Ive never been low on any materials with the exception of ballistic fiber...
---
Tell him to go to the games page and keep going down. It's under add on as a demo I think.
---
Still waiting for Steam.
---
I meant exactly what I said. IDK what kind of shit you were running, but my PS4 game only had one actual gameplay bug every couple days worth of playing. I will say, I saw a fair amount of graphical glitches- enemies moving with wrong animations or otherwise glitchily, but nothing that bad. Literal 0 "crashes", though I do remember disconnecting from time to time, maybe once every 2-3 sessions, after which I could reconnect just fine. 
---
From your post, I'm wondering if there was a big performance difference between what I had (PS4 version) and what other people were seeing. That would at least explain why people saw it as so shitty, because I legitimately don't understand.
---
S15 P4 E12 C7 I6 A5 L7
---
Dont read them, you will only ruin your day by doing so.... I know 76 has its problems. But a large portion of ppl are just trolling or criticizing the game blindly because it's cool sheeting on a game without any constructive opinion and any sort of contributions. You can already tell that they haven't even played the game and just hates for the sake of hating on 76.
---
S.P.E.C.I.A.L.
---
Random loot pool?
---
Do you know what a lecture is?
---
Well we'll see, I predict they add seasons, more cosmetics that are only obtained through PvP and people keep playing. It only needs 52 people to start across the entire player base.
---
This, it's a bit confusing for sure
---
I could recommend follow the main roads and railways, and do the quests of all the zone before go to another zone (maybe skip one or two because difficulty). The zones are level based:
---
The forest (center-left): 1-15.
---
Toxic valley (up-left): 15-25.
---
Ash heap (down-left): 25-35.
---
Savage Divide (center): 35+
---
The mire (center-right): 40+
---
Cranberry bog (down-right): 45+
---
Quest are enjoyable on slow rhythm. You could have issues trying quest with friends when you are doing it too fast. The lore is enjoyable when you read the notes, listen the audio logs and look the environment stories slowly.
---
Events and workshops could be hard doing solo, but they are doable (and a good source of XP).
---
I'm too on PC!  My username is Jorslato.
---
Precisely my opinion. It's fun with friends, for sure.
---
I saw juice got this wrong in one his latest vids.. 
---
comments blew up so im sure he will correct that.. lol
---
Figure out what the IP for the servers you're connecting to are (you'll have to google that one), then run a tracert to the servers to see if there are any issues between you and the servers.
---
You mention you're wired (good!), wifi can be problematic, but since we've ruled that out, that's the next thing I'd check.  Obviously you can check your drivers (network) and a few other things, but first off rule out things that aren't local.
---
I've been on plenty lately, and haven't had a single DC (on PC, but with regular cable connection).  I don't think the servers have been crashing, which could show up this way, so it's either network (local or remote), or something software related (drivers or the game software).
---
It can reward with Possum Badges so always worth running through.
---
I’ve come across new players who basically try to hit and shoot everyone and everything, they were probably just trying to learn more about the game but didn’t read the operation manual.
---
Yes, completely agreed. The amount of new players we got is huge. So happy to see level 2's outside the vault.
---
With a chance to hook a mirelurk or angler plus fishes.
---
also.. this should be pinned
---
Happened to me once. I loot a box near me when it happened and that made it stop. Lost a ton of ammo tho..
---
He bashed the game for a while and put out misleading shit from the get go. Like the whole thing with the people being banned in 2018.
---
I'm curious about this, too. Can anyone who has changed their PSN ID confirm that it didn't impact your account... specifically your Atom balance in the Atomic Shop?
---
I cried when I read “to the group of clowns wear mole mascot masks” I can’t even right now with that.
---
Yes, now is a particularly good time to take workshops.  Most PVP people are being sated  by the new game mode and it is an easy way to get plans and matetials.
---
FPS is alright in most areas except for white springs, but textures have a habit of switching between hi and low res a lot of the time. Not to mention the lighting lol.
---
Ok thanks.
---
Agreed.. I do feel like my mind is changing when I get to drag my heavy over encumbered butt to a green light camp and the scrap benches are inside of a locked house!
---
Green Camp Icons = Player Vendors.
---
Stop by and browse what's for sale.
---
No, he hasn't. He's been shitting on the game up until very recently.
---
next up should be another 2x exp weekend for the american July 4th holiday..  8D
---
I played the beta and played since launch and have loved every minute. I did take a break from it to wait for more updates and for them to add more content but I recently started playing again and fell in love all over again.
---
Agreed 👍
---
Updated :), more info, more fun.
---
Isn't it funny how the reaction from fallout subs is overwhelmingly positive, yet the public reaction of people who never even played the game is not?
---
Sorry you think so. The rest of us will be enjoying the new mode
---
Salt of the Earth I assume?
---
even if this is just promotion, this guys stuck with the game since day one from his age of his youtube vids, so for that ill sub
---
I sure do.
---
you didnt barge in.. that was his store...
---
You live in a very black and white world.   It is quite possible for two teams in two places to work on the same game mode.  This idea that because they are in different places they can't possibly take care of the game that was promised up front is ridiculous.
---
Fortnite BR has a great 3D-ping system, and I'd love to see something similar implemented for Nuclear Winter.
---
I don’t know if I want to hook a Mirelurks while fishing off my base dock lol
---
I am looking forward to that! Its actually a really cool new system. :D
---
So this is how raiders happen!
---
Thanks for the info, was looking for this so I know when I can stop since I just want stuff from Base Game.
---
It was condescending at the very least.
---
Unless your up there with me. I'm usually trying to get people to hop in the shower with me. No one has turned me down yet. Such a great community.
---
How to get one?
---
it does?   You can only chat with your team,  all people do is run around and punch you.   It's the worst part about nuclear winter lol
---
Sprint is suppose to be tactic not for travel.
---
He's a cool guy too met him in game once and play with him time to time. Just thought his content deserved some recognition.
---
Probably won't come until the full release, it would be a mess to put it as a location in-game and then remove it after a week. Imagine all the issues with people stuck inside or setting up their camps near it
---
might want to reconsider that.
---
A fast 1H weapon can do more damage than a slow 2H weapon in the same time frame.
---
For example, my 1\* vampire switchblade can hit 3x in the same time span it takes a 1\* grognak axe to make 1 hit.  The switchblade does 80-90 damage per hit, the grognak does 180.
---
For the sake of illustration, say the grognak takes 2 seconds to swing, hit, and reset for the next swing.
---
Tte swtchblade gets 3 hits in the same 2 second span.
---
3 x80=240 and 1x180=180.  So the switchblade does 60 more damage than the grognak.
---
I disagree. I think the tactical need of not being able to sprint insane distances in full gear makes the mode interesting. You actually use tactical movements and fast-slow-fat pacing instead of Fortnite-esq jump spamming and zipping around everywhere.
---
It also actually makes paying attention to the storm movement way more important.
---
my damage seems lower but I havent done any serious testing.. just a feeling based on clearing areas like whitesprings
---
Great remake of Old Town Road: https://youtu.be/PfEAtiiYF94
---
Sir, yes sir.
---
In your camp menu under "Vendors"
---
Yeah I’m aware of the bait team invites, but honestly if the clowns have two functioning brain cells they would leave new players alone. What do they get out of killing a level 2.
---
I have a 9 card equipped
---
Yeah it's awesome 🤣🤣🤣
---
i read somewhere to go to store&gt;free&gt;top demos and then sort by release date
---
The game hasn't been bad at any point in time for me. It's exactly what I wanted from Bethesda, a full multiplayer game that plays like all their previous games. Unfortunately I chose to buy it for my Xbox (Had a 60 dollar giftcard) when I'd rather play on PC.
---
Please explain how two studios can't possibly be working on the same part of the game?   We know that Bethesda's versioning system is complete hot garbage considering how they lost a metric fuckton of fixes and updates by pushing old code out to everyone reverting a massive amount of things that had been fixed, but seriously back in the real world there are versioning systems and there are complete different packages / sections of the code that the teams could be working on.  Standing on this point about them being different studios only means something in your mind.
---
I'm keen for a simple yellow diamond atm, don't want them putting too many resources into the Battle Royale after all. Although it is a fun addition to the game.
---
Idk, maybe it’s just the Xbox One, but my game was pretty rough. I stuck with it, and enjoyed it, but it’s buggy. It almost felt like I was game testing for them though. Quest markers being on random objects and not spawning the quest items, render was really REALLY bad, and as far as DC goes I’d usually get dropped anytime I played for more than like an hour and a half and never had a play session go continuously for more than like four hours because of that. There’s a lot to criticize about the game, it definitely needed a lot more polish even for a Bethesda game. I liked it, but am waiting to get back into it in a year or so. Not really holding my breath on it, F4 had it’s issues that kinda hurt my trust with Bethesda already.
---
It was easy at the beginning to focus on the faults (there were a lot) but the game has grown and gotten better and better over the months. I'd love another round of reviews and maybe this free trial period will generate that. 
---
Welcome to Appalachia mate, see you in the wasteland
---
You...can? The different mods change color but provide no resistances
---
Dont like fallout games I take it?
---
its in your camps build menu. stuff in your stash you can mark for sale.
---
Yah you and me are the same. I feel exactly the same way. Doesn't mesh well to hunt down my fellow vault dwellers to kill them and doesn't sit right with me from any kind of lore and background perspective (unless it just a simulation Zax is running or we're playing the vault 51 ppl prior to 76 opening up?) and doesn't feel enjoyable to play (it stresses me out and makes me very anxious).
---
But! That's okay, it is just not for me. I can recognize that and be happy that it exists and that others are enjoying it and having fun.
---
I would imagine the clans and faction tools will be added in with wastelanders.
---
Obvious troll is obvious
---
Nah man, go try it out, I'm not a fan of pvp at all but NW is actually pretty fun.
---
Lots of explody guns around these days. You can find explosive versions of just about any gun type. Check out high level player vendors. 
---
And keep killing those three star legendary enemies.
---
Almost like there are a lot of cheap moochers in the world.
---
I paid over 100 dollars and i still think i've gotten my money's worth.
---
Probably voyeurs. It's easy to respect someone's opinion based on experience, but to spew from an echo chamber seems to be catching on, or they bots. Who knows who cares.
---
Bugged on XBox also 😒
---
There are slides on the graphics menu. Set your settings on low, then test your game with all the slides on the left.
---
Then increase the slides slowly and test you game until you are satisfied.
---
This game is poorly optimized.
---
To each their own, but you might be in a minority with your opinion on Athem.
---
Just a bunch of click-baiters. Mad-sounding vids get more clicks than praises that’s why they do it. $$ is what they’re after.
---
This is what happens when people just absorb public opinion and follow the crowd.
---
No I prefer games where the developers don't straight up lie, cheat, scam and whatever.
---
They're straight up malicious.
---
Hilarious... thank you for this
---
That these are not ramdom....  is very very bad.
---
You have done a great service to this community today
---
More than enough, ive done everything the game has to offer. I guess the only thing left to do is grind for better legendaries, which makes no sense to me motivation wise because I already did everything that there is to do. So yeah.
---
I got a card that refills AP faster.  Seemed to help a little.
---
Shitty games are fun tho 
---
I miss finding the game breaking bugs :(
---
lmafo, This post/thread has made my day.
---
I enjoy killing/hunting/destroying them and everything they own.  I want to be known as the super villain of the Appalachian.
---
I signed off and i cant remember but i think the 3rd star is 15% less ammo weight and its lvl 35 i believe
---
Welcome to the wasteland!
---
Have a Nukashine on me.
---
I do this one and then go round up the harpers ferry enemies. All their guns add up quick
---
I love this game! I know there's a lot of people who are still upset that Bethesda has Fallout so nothing they'll do will be good enough.
---
There's also a lot of people who want this game to be a certain way and it's not COD. Not everything is made for everyone, but if you love the lore of Fallout and love exploring and finding out more this game is awesome.
---
I'm on PC and I rarely have issues.
---
I also have found that it's so much fun playing with somebody than by yourself. I play with my mom and we do quests and run around and talk and we have a blast.
---
Dude I love this! Idk if it was you but some high level player dropped me a brown bag full of stimpaks. All my interactions this far has been amazing. Super friendly people and have had no one griefing. This has been the friendliest online community of any game I've ever played.
---
Alright. I’ll do it then.
---
It seems like it must be fixable, since the game is certainly keeping track of which recipes I know and which locations are available to me for fast travel. They just need to be counted up. 
---
I am guessing this is very low on their priority list, since fixing this bug is equivalent to giving away free money from their point of view.
---
that the people shitting on the game were doing it in an organized fashion.
---
xD Glad to have you. Don't get burned up
---
&gt;  the charm of baking soda.
---
Ooh, that's good.
---
Okay who's letting Todd make accounts again.
---
Also watch for landmines.
---
New copy’s are 17 dollars on amazon now if you haven’t checked that
---
Party finder area for when the raids come
---
He's talking about the graphics effect not the recoil.
---
My bad.
---
If you have any friends bring them with you, it really is a pretty good time and a nice change of pace!
---
I prefer it to switch. If not I'd max out adrenaline only. I'm stacking the two cards. In situations like Whitesprings I'm slaying ghouls like crazy. It's very good in events like Uranium Fever too.
---
Fishing with grenades.
---
you can do that only in adventure mode or survival too?
---
...I keep trying it. I keep hating it. Like, really hating it. 
---
It’s not for me. It is the opposite of what fun should be, as far as I’m concerned.
---
Done with it now, I think. Back to adventure mode!
---
I saw some when walk in by PA to Deathclaw Island
---
Got to join up..
---
PC ign FarPlace
---
Is there a suggested discord I could join?
---
Disease Cures possibly. Deep Pocketed Armour too! Screws. :)
---
This is a pretty cool idea if this is going to make it into to game I'm just going to build a fish shop
---
You can play solo if you want.  
---
or you can walk along and chat with another player without creating a team.
---
or you can wave and keep on going.
---
Joining a team is optional.  There are benefits of teaming, like shared XP and certain perks, but not a mandatory thing.
---
There are a couple scenarios that require another player, but those are either optional (possum revive a friend challenge), or events where a large number of people are going to show up anyway (SBQ fight).
---
That’s probably a newly introduced legendary feature 🤔
---
Back when the grenade trap exploit was a thing you could stand there and crank out 10-15 levels per hour just by clicking "disarm." 
---
If you see someone who's level 300+ it's a safe bet they spent a lot of time clicking the grenades.
---
FYI.. its a joke
---
 Clean Prince is still being a salty douche. Within a couple hours he already had an entire video on how Fallout is ruined forever.
---
I'm not on discord so I can't answer that, I play with some real life friends and friends I met in game.
---
Welcome to the wasteland. 😎

Its 15% something haha. Sorry cant remember what it is
---
I paid and unfortunately it sucked then and I had to wait for a while for them to fix it. Anyways it's good now and I got what I wanted for the money I paid. Some say I lost money but I say those who got it in sale won.
---
EXIT GAME
---
Cool.
---
If you haven’t found them by tonight, I’ll be on and I’m pretty sure I have a full T-60 set in my vending machine for really cheap. Add me PSN: stephancirc1 I should be on around 10pm est or so
---
Try changing from TAA to FXAA.  TAA induces that "smudging" on movement.
---
This is true! The one thing I did really like about NW is having the social lobby hub. I was sitting beside ppl and emoting and the place was busy with activity. It made me really want a large social hub of our own for trade and hanging out and community things.
---
I played to see what it's about.. but ... your right Adventure mode is where it's at.
---
The deployment lobby is as offputting as hell. Make it so we can damn well kill each other in there at least (has anyone been able to? LOL )
---
Ah I see. Like adjusting a small value or balancing?
---
Please please please no. Lol
---
This is an interesting statement because it made me wonder what people value more.  For instance, I feel like time is more valuable than money.  These people playing for “free” are still spending their time, and I guess I couldn’t imagine spending such a valuable commodity like time on something that I didn’t value otherwise.  I personally feel like if they invest a week’s worth of gaming time into something they like, then the transition to purchase will be almost negligible compared to getting that time back.  If they didn’t get to invest much time but like the game, they may also still purchase it based on this principal.  And of course the third option is not investing time and ultimately money—but then they really weren’t a formidable part of the player base for this week anyway.  I guess my whole point is that, of course, you could be right.  But its a hard concept to wrap my mind around where someone invests time into something with which they wouldn’t invest money.
---
Im trying the game for the free trial and im surprised... so far it has been a wonderful ride. i might not stay because its dificult to comunicate with others w microphone only... it should have a text chat. it would be appreciated for the foreign community. I dont know anyone else playing fo76 and it has proven to be difficult alone. im ready to start a more cooperative experience, im level 10. but cant find people to do so. one thing i would like to see is a more organized point of reunion or something. like a comercial area where everyone hangs and chat. it would certainly improve my experience. any advice? 
---
cheers!
---
Unfortunately these new players are only gonna be around till the 17th cause noone wants to buy the game lol
---
I agree with that. To be fair, it was a correct answer.
---
I would also recommend "Tormentor" from the Luck stats as well as "Ground pounder" and possibly "Tank killer" (not sure if it works with auto rifles).
---
Doing the lords work. The #11 blue camo weapon skin, for any weapon or?
---
Yeah i like his content a lot 👍🏻
---
I dont know what you are doing but my game crashes all the time. like about once every houre, bluescreen and gamecrash or just a game freeze in lodingscreens im on ps4 or server kicks. So I never nuke solo cause i only managed once to get my nuke without crashing. So yes fun game but also a buggy hell on normal ps4 for me. Fallout 4 was much more stable
---
LOL that episode resonated a ***little*** too much with me ; )
---
I bought the game a couple days ago for 20$ I'm having a blast I don't know what I'm doing but I'm lvl 17 just wandering around having fun
---
It's definitely underground. Kaleidoscope plants, or whatever they're called are in the second pic, you see those in arktos.
---
Where do they spawn?
---
Oh, I don't know man - I played the Beta, and another 80 hours or so, and crashes were plentiful. I played one night, when my friend finally quit playing, because he crashed 6 times in the span of an hour. Several quests that didn't work or couldn't be finished, weird spawns (through doors, floors, etc.) - it earned it's "buggy  mess" description. I mean, I had a ton of fun playing it, but you'd have to be fairly lucky not to encounter serious bugs.
---
I just go sit in the garden and check my phone but someone always comes and starts punching me
---
I'm not one for br. But I actually kinda enjoy nuclear winter. The matches seem pretty fast paced and the pvp is easier than I thought(my main is a melee build so I dont pvp)
---
The aid and weapons are scattered randomly on it
---
I'm lvl 21, and still have no idea what I'm doing.
---
*queue
---
I think that's actually a pretty common farming area for those. Just be aware of course that because it's a popular farming area and people start server hopping for them it means relatively few people can actually get a chance to do it.
---
I love Bethesda and I love this game... but BGS has shown a surprising lack of understanding of the most basic social needs of an online gamer. I'm not taking anything for granted until I get a post or reply from /u/valseek or /u/ladydevann. Give us some social tools!
---
As long as I don’t get a Mr. Pinchy.
---
I like just fast traveling to Flatwoods and watching them all scatter like roaches. OHDEARGODJESUSITSALEVEL360EVERYBODYRUNOHGODWEREALLGOINGTODIEHELPHELP
---
I've had exactly two explosive drops since I started playing during the BETA. One was a gauss rifle while at the white spring and the other was an assault rifle at the wendigo cave. Explosive weapons don't drop that often. But with the new legendary vendor, I think the chances of getting an explosive weapon are better now. 
---
But it you want a guaranteed explody weapon, best place is through player vending or on here. You'll find some real good deals sometimes through the player vendors.
---
where ? I could use the discount but im in south america 😆
---
Do you ignore reviews on everything you buy?
---
That I do agree with.
---
Dude stray animals are awesome at finding things!
---
Solos will come after betas done anyways
---
It’s important in times such as these to conserve water. This can best be done by showering in groups.
---
u/ladydevann check this out please♥️
---
yeah.. ox is way too shilley for me.. I gave up on him before the whole copyright strike thing went down...
---
I miss thenthapple.. 8(
---
I was expecting it to be terrible and I purchased it after 10 minutes of playing bc it was so freakin amazing. 
---
I was expecting it to follow the standard MMO play style (much like what ESO did, to the point where it almost doesn't feel like an Elderscrolls game at all, IMO) but it feels like a truly authentic Bethesda game with other players just running around. 
---
Super glad Bethesda did this free week on top of the game being 50% off.
---
I legit won a match cause the scorch beast killed the other guy hahaha, was on the first day the new mode released so doubt it was you tho, prob happens a lot. Being on the other side of it is sooooooo awesome if i am being 100% honest haha.
---
You should make a post about it and suggest that. There could be other things too that they could add down the road. Like; maybe dueling or whatever too.
---
I saw that the game is on sale half price now lol
---
Theres already red, black, blue, a tan/yellow one and I forget the last
---
/u/taac52 Here's how to earn some of those Creation Club skins.
---
So in other words you know nothing about the game but sure are mad about it. Meanie development team.
---
&gt;I don't feel the need to get punished for playing for a longer time than newer players.
---
Is this just you saying you don't want to make a new character?
---
And most people who played it at launch hated it.
---
I always hated PVP, I am way to bad in there.
---
But NW, it is realy fun. I am still very bad, but atleast I have a chance and I can do better.
---
I've had it happen on PC. The only option for me was to alt f4.
---
Well well, do tell. Who's your secret NPCILF?
---
Don! Cheers for linking me
---
Melee/Heavy/Shotgunner all benefit from the strengths perks, so I switch among the three from time to time. Building my 2nd as rifleman now, since the rifle perks are all in Perception. After watching some captainooob vids I’m tempted to build a pistol build lol
---
Nuclear Winter is having a pre beta this week. The other modes will get stuff this summer and NPCs and a new main quest this fall.
---
Ahh, well iv only been playing for roughly a month or so.
---
Yeah man, I am in total agreement with you.  I went into this game expecting it to suck because of it's launch issues and it's reputation, but I gave it a shot and it's actually a really cool game.  Too many youtubers getting clicks by moaning and mocking games and it's effing up entry into games from new players.
---
Glad you're enjoying it dude.
---
Nice story :) thumbs up for both of you :)
---
I hate hate hate those stupid wheels...
---
Yes plz! I want that so much. An instanced interior that has been refurbished maybe? Completely separate it from the overland map and make it like NW's social hub. But making it a very large interior zone that can hold up to 50 ppl with pipboy 80s style cabinet arcade games and community social card games and dice games and place to sell our stuff at and all those kinds of community social things.
---
And there is the combat armor paints from the atom shop, you can add those too on your helmet.
---
Yeah I don't know why we can sell them but not junk them. That never made sense to me. Why can't I get one cloth from them?
---
Why not?
---
I have tried 10 times to install the game. It always crashes and I have to reset it. Because when I re-open the bethesda launcher it drops the max download to whatever I have already downloaded and refuses to progress.
---
I can see why this game was considered a failure.
---
well you could do it in survival as well, if you really want to advertise your camp location and possibly someone coming to it to destroy it.
---
Its' because when it comes to communication, there's almost nothing that's going to be as effective for providing quick and details communication as actual speech.  With the exception of people who are mute, everyone else should be able to use a mic if you want proper communication with your team.
---
 If they’re not too badly burnt, some of them you can read.  I guess my main complaint is that they smell.  Really stinks up my inventory. But weighing 1lb maybe it should be moved to weapons?
---
Ah, that makes sense, thanks!  For some reason, I was reading it as a theory that Bethesda deliberately put out a flawed game.  That would be an expensive and time-consuming conspiracy!
---
Start small. survive for 2 min., take 1 person down even if it is your 15th try. Celebrate each tiny victory. That is where the joy is.
---
Yeah the first game was disconnected in NW. My team was good too, it was me and one guy on other team left and it said server not responding mid fire.. I think I had him too. But the team mic was still working and teammates were saying classic bethesda as we waited for the disconnect xD It did feel normal for us regulars oddly.
---
I honestly thought that the new game mode was a waste a development and wasn’t needed. Battle royale as a game mode has gotten stale, and has sort of died out. But if people like the new game mode, that’s all that matters. I’ll just stick to adventure.
---
Yeah and Blackwater mine during Uranium Fever. You can come out of that event with like 500 steel OR just a bunch of great weapons to sell
---
It is a solid game. I have like 300 games and I like it. Lots of people just go with the flock of sheep and don’t even try the game before having an outrageously strong negative opinion (for something they haven’t tried). I personally hate uninformed opinions that are based on popularity.
---
I almost didn’t get the game, but I did, and it’s one of my favorites!
---
Sorry if I came across hard ass, that wasn't my intention.  I only play the game to have fun and laugh.  But getting as many XP as possible in a short time takes structure...I was just trying to be up front about that.  If our play styles don't match its no big deal.
---
Do you have those Neon Letters? I put down around 30 and it's taken up nearly half the budget
---
I’ve always hated that song, it gives me a really weird feeling. Not in a good way.
---
I took this as an opportunity to move stuff at little to no profit to get it out of my stash. 
---
All recipes and CAMP plans for free. 
---
Chems for 1 - 5 caps each. 
---
Ammo 1 cap each or free.
---
Well it looks like my spot in Summerville is blown, lol.
---
&gt;  this bug is equivalent to giving away free money from their point of view
---
I get that..
---
I even outlined how they could fix this, proving they have the means and the counters.. I searched back in history, but the reddit search gave me errors trying to find it..
---
Angry Joe or not, that type of content is always subjective opinions disguised as reviews. They either get paid to make things look better than they really are or they exaggerate the negative aspects of products they dislike.
---
It's all just for the clicks and likes.
---
I was trying to not use vats in adventure last night. Not easy at all, I also need too throw some short scopes up. The hip fire crosshairs are useless.
---
I'm hyped for Wastelanders. I just wasn't able to find any release dates for the other content! Thank you!
---
The strange thing with the  Ultracite Power armor is that on papper it's a small tad weaker, but doing the SBQ it feels like the most powerful of them all, no ider why :/
---
Could it have a "hidden" effect on dmg from SB / SBQ's ?
---
Damn I legit misread that and though you were saying you wished the Crashed Space Station would become a hub.
---
My first match I tried to punch someone to death and got instantly shredded by a gatling gun, next match I shredded someone trying to punch me to death with a gatling gun.
---
So what happens if you apply the skin, will it actually change the mesh?
---
What does it say when you click unavailable?
---
Yes, but I’ve had the same camp for over 2 months now and am very aware of my budget as I make little changes constantly. Even when deleting lights and billboards, the budget doesn’t go down at all. Made a post about it earlier and it seems to be effecting lots of other people in the same way.
---
Criticism doesn't sell. Their audience wants all the drama and all the bullshit that comes with it.
---
Somebody must have looted it before you? Weird because I don't think plants work that way.
---
So I stopped playing around the time they introduced the bulldozer thing for camps, can anyone briefly summarize some of the major changes since then so I don’t have to read dozens of patch notes?
---
Thanks! This is actually helpful in dumping dead weight cards.
---
On Single Player/Offline mode:
---
  Perhaps in long term planning - there will come a time when the player base no longer supports the investment in servers and resources to maintain, etc.  At which point, the servers will shut down.  
---
I do seem to recall some backlash on other companies that promised their on-line game would live forever, people bought in, 1 year later, server shut down, real money spent on DLC didn't work, no standalone mode, game useless (can you say guitar hero live?)...
---
To that end, if there's an offline mode, perhaps with occasional DLC, or the game is converted from open ended to a true endgame, then the game stays alive.  We the players stay happy, and buy into the next iteration of fallout.
---
Yeeess
---
Oh, No.. not at all.. a sane person does know what's not ...well... sane.. :P
---
Im not sure that they are awarding that skin or that welders helmet thats in the lobby. Ive won a couple times now and havent noticed any rewards for it. Maybe after the sneak peek.
---
I believe 4 actually, because there are challenges for taking pictures in nuclear winter and for taking pictures in vault 51
---
No, it's the fact that everyone was dick riding from what the media and "YouTubers" were saying. People were hating on the game without even playing it. Now that the game is getting good "reviews"/coverage, everyone jumps on the bandwagon for the likes.
---
I stuck through it since the beginning and had faith. I still had fun though even during the original Beta. I hope Bethesda can really reap the rewards of their hard effort in year 2 of Fallout 76! NPCs/dialogue choices were the biggest surprise to me! I still need to try out Nuclear Winter mode after hearing all the positive reviews for a change.
---
From the main menu join your team and then go into NW.
---
Tenderizer requires 9 CHA as well. This makes enemy defense weaker over multiple hits.
---
brilliant... I may have to borrow one of those
---
A longer BETA might have helped too.  22 days seems way too short given the end product at the time. In this instance, I think Bethesda's tendency to keep things under wrap and have a narrow reveal-release window really hurt them.
---
you mention juicehead hating on 76 but not jim sterling LUL
---
Dude, that's me.
---
grind mobs.. do events...
---
yeah... and something really anyoing is all this community talking about new players like they are some stupid mob. who are you ? owner of a game...
---
not uncommon.
---
i spent almost an hour at someones camp the other day as they modded me up my weapons, gave me some pointers, and hooked me up with some low rank stuff.
---
love the community in this game.
---
Main menu, Social menu. Everyone needs to also be on the main menu I believe
---
Absolute legend. What’s your platform? If you’re PC my pals and I want to spread the love to you for being so crazy awesome!
---
Ive been trying my whole life.  Easier to complain until the world conforms to my shortcomings.
---
So who is your ride along? I never liked Cait's voice because the accent was too heavy for me.. Just personal opinion. But the game play personality worked for my theft in the game.
---
Ok so i was mistaking its a lvl 40 with +1 perception
---
That's technically cheating in battle royales but oh well. Glad u had fun
---
No I just mean my level 12 was no match for the level 50 legendary sheepsquash patrolling the homestead. I couldn’t get close enough to anything to loot it without him whooping my ass again, and again, and again.
---
Is it... normal for it to be there?
---
Disease cures aren't for mutations...
---
Thank you for this great post, I too hate killing players, personally love to murder NPCs but feel icky when killing some else thats a controlled by a human.
---
adventure mode has lots of ways to prevent ppl from being jerks, and now the jerks have both survival and NW to play, so I'm not so worried about having them in adventure. of course now with the influx of players it might take them a while to get used to being nice, but i think we are setting a nice example
---
3P Master Commando 40%
---
Is this with the Marathoner perk? Or did you switch that out?
---
It d be better if they added a spotting mechanic like in bf
---
I thought the garden might be nice and quiet too but the same happens to me lol

Yes, that's what it is, right on dpad
---
Hah! I salute your sarcastic self-awareness, have an upvote
---
I can stand to watch Jimquisition anymore because at somepoint he is going to trash Bethesda and it just gets fucking annoying
---
I don't know what platform you play on, but my friends and I downloaded the PS4 Messenger app, added all of us to 1 group and we chit-chat through that to set up triple Queens, squatch server hopping, Arktos and other such events.
---
Exactly, or just things they randomly think off but that doesn't belong on the roadmap
---
i've got mixed on that. at un-nuked increase, but against glowing IF I shoot from hidden = less damage and less I would guess because they don't drop as fast???
---
They have a high level dungeon in arktos, but noticed the player base doesn't care for it. We love it. Not much else is challenging end game unless you like pvp. If you're into making a complete character, crafting everything, having all the outfits, acquiring all the rare and normal plans, it's a different game.
---
Thought everyone knew this tbh
---
This has given me a idea thanks!
---
What are we supposed to do with your daily opinion tho

It is honestly great how Fallout 76 has games within a game. Most games just have that one mode. 76 is truly a service!
---
It's a beta. Make suggestions.
---
there shouldn't be any spotting its silly
---
You really should try it if you haven't.
---
It's not going to replace Adventure mode for me in any way, but I was pleasantly surprised, and I just see it as a fun distraction.  Especially if you only have a half-hour to play, it's a nice break from the grind.
---

it just puts weapons going clockwise and aid going counterclockwise in the order you pick them up until the wheel is full, but you can change the position of anything on the wheel with a few inputs

Personally hate BR too since I hate to get competitive because I tend to go overboard so currently just starting up matches and going afk, don't worry I go solo without team but it only gives 100 exp per match typically unless someone finds and kills me.
---
Lol. Yeah, my first game, shot dead 15 seconds after spawning in. Second game, killed a whole squad by sniping a car they were hiding behind and won.

Stand down soldier, your at the whitesprings now :D

Get the perks that reduce sprint consumption and another one that increases AP recovery.
---
Yh well none or a minor manual one but automatic is dumb I agree
---
I've been making people starter armor sets and weapons. It's fun to outfit people for their first foray into WV. I even kited a 3 star legendary about half a mile and right up to a level 5 so they could get the last couple hits on it. It's been fun.

I'm asking for responses on what to do in my position, as the people on this sub generally seem quite helpful to new players.

Yes that is way to Funny, and right, I've not done NW yet because what you said is pretty much standard in a PVP BR mode...

Yep, I rather see the removal of all legendary effects and mutations from survival. Those things are the biggest reason why a higher level player is stronger than the average level 50 - 100.
---
 I don't care about the players that have a low level because level 50 is easy to reach, so they would be on par with the higher level players within a reasonable amount of time.
---
You're always going to encounter cynicism, that's why as a gamer we should always make the decision for ourselves instead of being influenced by others opinions. Maybe the person who wrote up a semi-nasty post had a bad day... Are you going to take their advice on that note? (I personally wouldn't.) Reviews are an indication, but not everything. I enjoy playing this game. I like exploring the world. I really enjoy how they've expanded on this game in the recent months. Now were armed with knowing they will add human NPC's to it in the near future, too.
---
Open and shut case Johnson.  Thank you!
---
Yep, my first ever match I got power armor right away, I got a great gun, I killed another character right away and then I went to revive my teammate and... well, holding X for revive as well as exiting PA doesn’t work so well. I crashed up big time accidentally exiting my armor lol
---
Yep I can totally second this. Just leveled my commando to 65. Accumulated a bunch of legendary rifles from my main so I’ve been trying them all out. The combat rifles are nearly as deadly as the handmade but 556 is a little bit easier to craft. The upside of the combat rifle is that they use the same .45 as tommy gun and lever action, so it’s a lot of fun switching among the three. But if you just want to be simple and deadly, nothing beats the handmade.
---
Grafton Steel has both lead and steel.
---
Or kill them, put the supplies in their baggy. And run away
---
scrap low lvl scorch weapons. That is what I do to get steel unless I'm selling them for caps at the faction vendors.
---
Didn't realize how poppin Arktos Pharma really is
---
Not sure what your budget is like, but you can buy the physical game on Gamefly for $13.   Mine was in great condition.   I think you can find it as low as $10 some places.
---
Do you have a screenshot?
---
The new players putt around and then go back to the main menu to queue for Nuclear Winter. It's completely different servers. Regular servers hold 22 people max.
---
I would suggest trying the Nuclear Winter mode to see how that goes. Mic highly recommended and I've been told sessions last around 20 minutes or so depending on how long you can make it.
---
I've been having the "camp is full" error when I try to stock my vending machines even though the camp budget isn't close to full and neither is stash weight. I got around that by dropping stuff into stash and then assigning it to a machine. Not much help though for your problem but I suspect they're related issues.
---
I just found one too, but mine wasnt on a dead body but a mannequin in a tuxedo and tophat. I wanted that damn tophat but it wasnt lootable.
---
The deathclaw lady running after the lil dude in power armor just made my day :)
---
I would drop a bag full of rotten food and then slaughter them
---
lol I guess I didn't think of it first, was going to pay my baby sister to play it for me.
---
flatwoods.. low level robots @ vault tech.. tons of steel and lead
---
I mostly get my gunpowder from crafting but some from supermutants..
---
kinda disproves the old "demo's hurt games" eh?
---
many would've missed this if not for the free trial.. shows trying a game trumps reviews and streams and are still important.
---
I had this happen earlier today! Simply relogging helped out!
---
... they are random
---
There are events that will get most of the server to turn out but they are for the most part end game content.
---
There is a need for lower level event content that will still draw high tier players.
---
Fasnacht was such an event.
---
I think they are working on it after they realized everybody loved the fun and quirky Fasnacht. 
---
So keep an eye out. They keep making it better every 2 weeks.
---
It’s a lot better. Still get crashes here and there but it’s nothing like it used to be.
---
I like to claim workshops in opposite corners of the map for free fast travel
---
my winter sessions last between five to seven minutes... lol
---
If you end up in a place where higher level creatures have spawned and there are also higher level players, take pot shots at everything, don focus on any particular mob.
---
The experience you get from hitting 4-5 level 40 plus mobs will be like finishing 1-2 low level events, and you only need to hit a mob to get the loot and experience.
---
An actual solo mode will come is what I meant
---
24?
---
Silo's are a great resource. You don't have to launch just go run through it and collect as you go.
---
Honestly if you didn't play Fo4 I can imagine what a mind fuck camp building might be for newbies so thanks for helping out. 
---
Is there a way to join specific servers? This sort of things don't happen in Asia I would think, I'll like to interact with some cool people. One thing I loved reading about during the controversy was about randoms helping people.
---
I have played all of the games, and my window of availability to play for free is fairly short, so my fetus opinion will have to do as a deciding factor.
---
I like what another user said once - actions like sit and drink should require you to *hold* the button.  A simple tap, like you'd use in looting, wouldn't trigger them.
---
For that mater, considering that this was also an issue in Skyrim and Fallout 4, I still don't understand why they don't just speed up the animation by 2x.
---
That would make sense, I just figured new players would play the main adventure mode first to get used to mechanics before playing nuclear winter. I might play a game of it but I've never really been a fan of BR modes sadly (and thank you for the warning :) )
---
I'll keep that in mind.
---
you are adressing my issues now... i thank you because i feel so frustrated. this is keeping me from buying the game of all things. this game has proven me to be difficult alone. i need to make more contact and i won’t be able to speak fluently because i’m not native. also it would be amazing to see a place where everyone gathers and chat, sell, etc. like a comercial zone... where is that ?? every online game has it !!
---
Never knew you could access the social menu from the main menu wow
---
tis a free week FYI. ends the 17th
---
They are randomly generated.   They are not always there.
---
I've enjoyed the game since launch, so anything else added in has been icing on the cake.
---
These rewards, are they only for NW or are they accessible in Adventure once you've unlocked them?
---
I started this:   [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bzdotz/nuclear\_winter\_rewards/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bzdotz/nuclear_winter_rewards/)
---
Cancer is a disease...
---
Give it 2 more weeks, all those new players clogging things up will be starving for whatever you are selling.
---
I normally wait 10 or 20 seconds after leaving a server before logging in again, specifically so I don't end up in the same one.
---
I went there for the challenge to kill a wendigo while wearing a clown outfit. Wasn't sure if power armor would interfere so I went in without it. Took forever to find the wendigo room and died to a king along the way. Eventually got my wendigo kill, only to not recieve credit for the challenge :(
---
Thanks so much man❤️
---
It's also 50% off if you enjoyed the game you should buy it.
---
What do you mean "switch" to first person
---
PC - ValenVaro.
---
I’ve had your problem many times and would often argue that it seemed camp budget does effect how much you can put in your machine. Others argued not having the issue so I tested some things. It seems when you get that message you can log out and log back in and the error shouldn’t pop back up. So try that next time instead of deleting camp items.  
---
For my current issue, logging out and back in doesn’t fix the issue. Seems no matter how much I delete I’m stuck at max. Hope they fix it soon, seems like I’m not alone
---
is there anywhere to give suggestions?
---
Is that you, Agent 13?!
---
\#getsmart
---
the road into flatwoods near the overseers camp has a river parallel to it.. and high traffic...
---
I saw a guy with a gold vault logo suit looking thing. Is that an old atomic shop one or Nuclear Winter?
---
Some of those crates are you in adventure and crates aren’t guaranteed to spawn at every point. I’ve seen crates not be where they’ve been before.
---
Not a lot of flat spots with water but whitesprings is flat with water on the gold course just not a lot of water. To the west of flat wood on the river near the capers is a nice flat area to plant also.
---
I'm sad to say I'm glad you too have had the same bad luck as me. 2 150 plus toons, and got my 1st and 2nd Explosive a few weeks ago, 3rd yesterday on a Gamma Gun... 1 and 3 from vendor, #2 was a drop at WestT
---
Also to mention is that this is free trial week. We will see how many ppl  still like it and how long this mode keeps ppl interested after the free ppl leave and in a few weeks of ppl learning exploits and gaining a lot of perk build know-how and better cards etc.
---
What!! This is the first I've heard of a prestige thing! How is it supposed to work for level 250 or more people?
---
Someone in Hellfire armor killed me the first day. I wonder what level unlocks that
---
Some other things that annoy me (as a ps4 player):
---
- the game literally freezes for multiple seconds when selecting a buildable kit. This can mean death if you select a kit on accident.
---
- not really a valid argument i guess, but there’s tons of bad players. Just doing dumb shit like spawning at the other side of the map or just roaming solo instead of working together.
---
- general lag, i’m assuming this isn’t a problem on pc but on console everything is pretty choppy so shooting with pistols or semi-auto rifles can be really goddamn hard
---
You'll be getting an overseer chair for your camp soon (lvl 9 or 10)
---
There's an arrested development joke just screaming to be unleashed here.
---
Strange, last 12 runs had the box I saw there. Maybe just dumb luck, been spawning in same spot with a small container and its always been there. Might need to test it when I get home more.
---
I had no idea how to see what I've earned so far!! You get all the upvotes from me lol
---
Kill Robots they drop steel scrap which is not a problem to find at all and lead scrap. 
---
I love to hit sugar grove (bonus lots of screws in fans and typewriters) and Watoga. Early locations robot farming areas could be Beckly and the Ash heap in general
---
Yup and the full game came with my xbox so I’ve just been waiting to decide if I want to keep it 😉
---
they may be gone.. I havent checked today.. but amazon had physical copies for $17USD the last couple days too...
---
Just north of the Gilman Lumber Mill, directly south of Vault 76. There is a large pond surrounded by a rock cliff on one side, and lots of lawn space for crops. Easy to defend, easy access to water and food, and as a bonus the friendly protectron workers roaming around will give you free wood scraps.
---
I like pa because I have old woodland paint and it blends so well, but won't rez after reading that!
---
I like it tho, its funny
---
We run a few hours and then take a break in adventure mode. It is really fun how they made it, I don't see it keeping us forever but it's new and different (also we want those exclusive skins!)
---
Yeah I feel a lot of criticisms are being misinterpreted as this "hatred" OP speaks of.
---
Let me OD on some jet and I’ll tell you
---
I would suggest get it for as cheap as you can
---
Disease cures aren't for mutations in Fo76....
---
I haven't had it yet on pc but thanks I'll avoid it again.
---
So I shouldn't find out where you live and blast the song outside your window for days on??? Now what am I going to do with my time....
---
Sounds great! I'll check it out as soon as I find some goddamn aluminium
---
There's are a few spots you can use.
---
As you leave Vault 76, go south and you will find a Lumber Mill, just before the Lumber Mill (headed towards Vault 76) are two large pools you can build on. Other people also build here so your camp might not always load.
---
Another idea is to go to The Overseer's camp. See the bridge there? Follow the stream in both directions (towards and away from Flatwoods) walk along the water and sort ofsurvey the land and pick a spot you like.
---
I've definitely had more explosives than that but those are the only two I've ever had that actually dropped from enemies lol. I even got lucky once on a roll from the purveyor and got an explosive harpoon gun. But that's about it lol
---
They should extends the free to play for an extra few days imo.
---
If you do adventure and find yourself in over your head, never be afraid to ask for help. Even just waving to a higher level and emoting them to follow you to a too tough enemy they will usually lend a hand to help take out that one too-tough enemy.
---
Oh...and avoid Yao Guai - Bears - they're bad....really really bad...worse than deathclaws bad. I'm low-mid level at 77 and I STILL have to plan out how I'm going to fight the big ones before they start using me as batting practice.
---
Good to know, just guess luck was with me since I spawned in same spot 12 times it was there but appears your not alone in saying this so testing more at home after work.
---
To clarify what that person said nuclear winter is only a game mode and the “nuclear winter dlc” will include more than just the game mode. Google the fallout 76 roadmap and it’ll show a few more baseline things but based on the last dlc wave they’ll add plenty more
---
I wouldn't put much effort into assessing a problem on your end.  The disconnects are quite real this week.  There's just a big influx of new players trying it out, and they spin up a lot of server instances as a result.
---
I mean I'm level 261 and I'm entirely fine with level 50s being the same power level, with the addition of powerful prestige bonuses I'll easily regrind to get them as well.
---
Nothing to worry, it feels like standard mode of COD team deathmatch, no one shot kill, no friendly fire, not Free-For-All where everyone fights everyone else. Your opponent even has a red arrow above his head so you know where he is. It’s really quite relaxing.
---
Thank you for making this!
---
That took me back. It's been so long since I've heard those words (or read, rather lol).
---
like most have said, but for me It's dropping your first nuke!!! Then going and finishing the queen.
---
Thanks for the breakdown. No way I’m going to reach the best of these before the trial ends, as I can only do so much BR in a row, but good to know what’s waiting.
---
I don't like it, nor will I defend it. 
---
But I'm a realist, and it's just the way it is.  And whether you accept it or not doesn't really matter. 
---
Though, you think being vocal has worked in the past?  Because why? EA reacted to some outrage over small bits of content? Because BGS continues to make 76 (a game I love) better?
---
EA didn't react to the outrage because they respect gamers.... They did it because it was a cheap way to save face. 
---
BGS hasn't kept working out of respect for gamers..... They continue to do so because if the game is played long term, they farm micro-transactions which Fallout shelter showed them was quite lucrative.
---
These companies react for one reason.... It makes money sense to do so. 
---
None of that will however equate to game companies extending development cycles to release better games at launch.  
---
If being vocal worked.... New releases wouldn't be 79.99 at launch in Canada.
---
Lol. Take my upvote.
---
I was unloading odds and ends from my stash and realized they were all around lvl 10, happened to be a level 10 wandering around my camp at the time. He was like the cats that show up.
---
It's random.
---
I quit watching his videos (JuiceHead) regarding the launch portion, but recently have begun watching again for this reason. I find them entertaining again and like the take and speculation he offers. 
---
I really love the game and am glad we have one that seems to be constantly evolving without costing me a fortune. Keeps me interested and always finding new stuff.
---
They're too poor in the Forest. Maybe in the Ash Heap after they get more money?
---
For some, context can change the way a person feels about a game even when there is no other change.  I personally like the context wherewithin we find ourselves a la nuclear winter, and I do have a hard time imagining how that particular context could make it so difficult for anyone to play, but maybe so.  If you ever played the last of us, it was a compelling story.  If the context of the last of us was that my whole motivation was to return a pen I just saw fall out of a woman’s purse at rite-aid...then there would certainly be something lacking.  So that is in contrast with your sentiment...but to advocate your sentiment, (because things are not black and white), I’m not sure, in particular, that context matters as much in a fast paced, repetitive loop game mode like a battle royale.
---
Yeah I feel ya, I plan on playing pretty much exclusively all week because of the limited time with the format but it won't hold me forever
---
Hahaha remind me not to have in-game chat on if I ever end up playing with you lol, I don’t trust you now
---
I would say not likely but there could be a complicated work around. Google search transferring Xbox data to PC would be your best bet.
---
I bought it for 40$ shortly after launch.. I dont regret it..
---
It was a correct answer sure, but it wasn't a warranted answer lol. I feel like some people feel like every question that seems like it has an obvious answer warrants a condescending or belligerent answer. And it doesn't. Because not all answers that seem obvious to us, are to others.
---
There's no where to hide in there. I did manage to get a nice shower though. I was surprised no one was punching me in there
---
I’ve been playing since the very first BETA session. Ever since those first 4 hours, I was hooked. The game is great.
---
Maybe his nanobots do?
---
If it is so easy to reach then what is your issue with creating a new character?
---
As it stands a bunch of bored level 50+ characters who leveled in adventure can just go duck hunting at Flatwoods and Morgantown.
---
They decided to keep improving the game instead of abandoning it, still needs a lot more work but far better than what it was at start.
---
Waited 15 minutes .. I'm gone
---
Just dont forget where the exit is. Got burnt alive being too greedy and forgetting how to get out.
---
Yeah it's definitely a little different
---
You could use that same argument for everything in the dev room, but we are not meant to have any of it.
---
This is beyond fun.  I mainly play adventure and launch multiple SBQ on a daily basis.  Since the E3 show, I've only jumped in adventure to get caps and scrips.  NW as taken over my entire clan!
---
Cancer is a disease.......................
---
Consumers would be mad briefly if games went over 60 ( they're 79.99 in Canada) .....
---
Then time would pass and it would be the norm.
---
As companions go, I prefer Nick to all others because it seems everyone knows him and likes him and all that, he can get stuff done. But. 
---
For my own personal pleasure it's piper because I am in love with Courtney Ford's voice ; )
---
You get rattled from YT comments??
---
LOL you nailed it honestly. Knowing the map like the back of my hand is a huge help. Being super comfortable with the shooting is also great.
---
I was so sad!!
---
I had the game since launch  and just did the mission that took me there at level 35. It was a pain! But i killed what I needed to and claimed the objective and got the hell out. Never go in solo! Glad I gave the game a second chance a couple weeks ago it’s been my most played game in June
---
felt somewhat similar at the start. We wrongly expect a continuation of fo4, so it feels tame, to the point of ' if sony wants me to subscribe, to play this......hmm ,maybe not'.
---
That was 600 hrs ago...............it heats up.
---
new players have flooded in , in my servers ( uk ).
---
still the odd issues of server disconnects ,stutter, etc,  but much better than of old. My time to play is limited, but even at 11pm, servers can still be fairly full.
---
stick with it.
---
cheers
---
...it’s a video game.
---
Should’ve been done by the man in black himself.
---
I heard, last year, some rumblings that there was talk between Sony and Microsoft about future cross platform play. Haven't heard anything since...and for all I know it could have been BS. But here's hoping
---
Oh, not really. Free Range starts at the Groves Family Cabin nearby, I think it ends on the other side of the farm from where the crops are. If he's there most likely someone started Free Range and bailed. Usually it's just bugs or feral ghouls.
---
I think we all felt that way in those early stages. The game hasn’t fully revealed itself to you just yet. Wait til you have tons of plans and knowledge of the environment and can be that guide for other new players. When you start feeling like you’ve done it all, and start paying it forward to the new low level characters, that when the game really opened up to me and became what it is now. Wasn’t until 700hrs in that I even switched up my build to an unstoppable glass cannon. Now 960+hrs in I’m still loving all the new stuff and helping low levels. Plus vending with the mid to high levels is an adventure all on it’s own. Just saying, just wait, it gets better if you’re not searching for an endgame and just making your own fun
---
How about a 'boxing dummy' room where first timers can learn how to punch, but outside that room we can't punch. It's so annoying, have you BEEN IN THERE??????
---
Yep yep yep. Need text chat asap.
---
Not a good place for someone brand new.
---
Have not found one yet. Seeing the noobs in adventure is kind of nice
---
I've never seen only 4 people on a server before. It's usually the max. To answer your question I doubt crossplay will happen. Many games don't have it.
---
I wish there was something like this that wasn't tied to PVP.
---
WORKING ON IT
---
The start of the game was really bad and it took a long time for things to get fixed.  Then they lost a lot of those fixed with one bad update and basically started over in many respects.  You are coming in after 7 months of development.  I would sure as shit hope that the game would be fun for you after 7 months of continued development work.  (BTW: I'm glad you're enjoying it, I'm simply trying to provide some perspective here.)
---
It is also a good thing that they didn't make the free week the week before... because there were a lot of crashes, freezes, and crap going on that week. 
---
My client still locks up if I drink, eat, or otherwise consume something too fast from the pip boy menu.   Like hitting enter twice in a row too rapidly causes the whole thing to freeze.  That's only been a problem for months.
---
So, welcome.  Glad you are enjoying it.  As someone who has seen it since November it sure has come a long way, but there is still a lot that needs to be taken care of.  The reviews were certainly completely unfair about the game.
---
Very much appreciated
---
It’s called Frog Legs, it’s awesome but it sucks when you’re sneaking up on a group and get stuck on a log, instinctively jump to get over it and turn into a human signal flare.
---
patch 8 helped a lot.  for me it was unplayable before then.  I still kinda sucks in the form of no real reason to play once you finish the main quest and have everything explored.  but thats just my opinion.  I came back a couple weeks ago after the patch to give it another shot,  and while its a lot better, im still dissapointed.  mostly with the perk system.  that said Im still playing at the moment so idk.   overall I give it a 5/10.  i WANT to like it ~ because Fallout.  but it was just a bad concept that they are trying desperately to fix.
---
It was a fun game to begin with, but the combination of the very bad bugs and it not being the type of game that some folks wanted created an outcry. I played it most in those first few months and I experienced some glitches, but nothing as bad as some of the Skyrim bugs I had to go through.
---
Technically speaking Microsoft is working on this so you can seamlessly play between PC and xbox. They had a bit about it in their press conference or something like that because they want to bring gamepass across platforms.
---
Oh no the game is a mess too. Everything involved in this game was a complete and utter mess at best and a straight up joke at worst.
---
https://youtu.be/kjyeCdd-dl8
---
Yes you get new camp stuff for use in adventure. You also get caps and xp based on your performance. I’ve leveled up 5 times since NW released
---
Small XP added to the character playing.
---
Small amount of Caps earned.
---
Yes you do get some items for your CAMP as well as Weapon/Armor skins.  These require significant time investment to earn.
---
You can lose 100% of the time and still earn everything.  Winning of course speeds up the process.
---
Looking forward to whatever additions they bring!
---
Nuclear Winter is pretty fun, give that a shot if you haven't.
---
But from what I have read. We are suppose to have the helmet hints why they are not banning anyone for having it.
---
I think at E3 they did a good job at making sure everyone knows that they are working hard on making the game better and they pretty much hit us over the head that everything so far is FREE!! 
---
Yeah I am super excited to see the world grow and change, it will be interesting once wastelanders comes out.
---
Haven't noticed any difference (PC). Killed several with different weapons and from different distances and watched the damage numbers. Zealot's Prime rocks! Maybe you didn't reequip your perk cards or went in with the wrong character?
---
Haha, same thing happened a couple of times here. They'd crouch down in front of it for a while, and take off. I'd look at the bag and everything was still there. FO6 players are too polite for their own good. XD
---
Likely not. I think this has come up with every popular game and the companies just won’t play nice
---
Is just exploring everything the best strat for finding plans?
---
Is there a Bos one?
---
EXCELLENT IDEA
---
Dude people comment online for fake internet points just as much as people desperate for their opinion to be heard can upload to the largest video hosting platform in the world upon impulse, let alone without proper motive.
---
Have you seen the Internet? Half of its shit doesn’t make sense but was birthed from impulsive or irrational nature
---
Adding to my previous post:
---
Rule 5:  Use your microphone!  Communication is critical, and enemy players can see emotes. Nine times out of ten, the team with mics will beat the team without.  It's hard to coordinate if you can't talk to each other.
---
If you want to play solo, deselect the auto-fill option when you queue up.  Then you can be the strong silent lone-wolf all you like.
---
Head to Flatwoods, scrap cans, the wind chimes on the door to the Flatwoods Church, and I believe some of the crushed metal containers give aluminum. Aluminum is also a possible drop from Mr. Handy (Mr. Farmhands)
---
&gt; Do i get new Adventure CAMP stuff if i win?
---
Yes, and even if you lose. The cosmetics are unlocked on an XP progression. As you level up the stuff is available for you in Adventure mode including extra XP and caps for Adventure mode.
---
For instance get level 1 in NW get a Vault 51 suit to make. etc...
---
All juice does is regurgitate reddit posts into 10+ minute videos so its no surprise to me that he all the sudden sees it as a good game.
---
To me using nukacrypt takes a big part of the game away. Solving the code is tough and that's part of the fun. This gives a great explination of how to do it. Many thanks to u/SaukPuhpet
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9ygyy9/stepbystep_guide_to_decrypting_launch_codes/

gonna be a real grind to get everything
---
im lvl 280.. spend alot of time at west tek farming, with the whitesprings run from time to time. then when i need food some faming in the cranberry bog for hermit crabs, deathclaws, mirelurks, and scorchbeasts.
---
You've got me there...
---
Yeah, I will admit I was wrong to go in thinking it still be very similar to what I was hearing in the beginning. I think a lot of people have. The servers I'm in might be empty due to timing (but I'm in the US so I don't know what's up with that). I'm going to probably jump back in and buy it when the human NPCs get added, I'm very excited about that :)
---
Hoping the game continues to impress me once that time comes. Hope you have a lot of fun in your servers and thank you for sharing your opinion.
---
Nope just a hive mind and downvotes :)
---
So, if I turn down my settings, I'll get more FPS? Mind. Blown.
---
God Bless you!
---
Internet problem from the sound of it. Hardwired or wireless?
---
Have you tried to download it from the demo section in the store?
---
Thanks for your reports, all! We're going to look into this. 
---
Quick question - What platform are you getting this error message on? PC?
---
One of my favorite campaigns of all time. There's also a video about how genius Black Ops was.
---
Everyone else is playing it. Sounds like a personal problem
---
I havnt run into that one, but the Bethesda launcher is a trainwreck.  I have to keep TWO INSTALLS in order to play.  one on a backup drive that the launcher keeps current, and the one I actually play on my game SSD that i have to manually update.  (for some reason 200gb+ of free space is "not enough room" to install...)
---
lol np there’s so many effects it’s hard to remember them all. It’s probably 15% faster reload or firing speed.
---
You can start up the game without mods and switch back and forth, I don't think they are going to block all mods
---
Hmm.... we could try? They could make use of the election voting terminals that are spread all around the map for us to vote from? Make them in game events whenever a poll or "election" is running for ppl to vote on. You know, turn it into a little "it is that time again for all patriotic citizens to do their duty and vote" kind of notification or mini event to get ppl aware a poll is taking place and to get their vote in. One per account not character.
---
Sounds like a PSN issue to me...

---
 &gt; Thanks for your reports, all! We're going to look into this. 
---
 &gt;
---
 &gt;Quick question - What platform are you getting this error message on? PC?
---
I think that's part of the Vault-Tec packs in the Atom store.
---
keep well rested on, make/keep/eat cranberry relish.. run with a friend and share inspirational.. find/buy leader bobbleheads, you can get up to 25-35% or so bonus experience.
---
Also me.  Can we start a Hall of Shame?
---
I have 2 kills, total, in what is now 10+ matches.  Oh look there's someone from a distance and I have a scoped rifle...I shoot 5 times, they shoot 2-3 times with anything... I'm dead.
---
Maybe I should just start yolo'ing in with Last Laugh equipped to see if that helps my kill count.
---
there accessible in adventure when you unlock them
---
Go to the game page then go down below and you'll see under add ons that there's a demo
---
I don't want to have to try and create a party, then invite people, then none or half turn up, only to not have microphones. A simple ping option isn't asking much and should be in any battle Royale.
---
When you start off in a game drop your camp 4 times and you'll get xp or perk cards, then the next game you play do it again and itll count towards another challenge with perk cards 🤙🏻
---
And super mutants. Good source for gunpowder
---
At this point I’m surprised there’s any life inside Whitesprings...
---
That’s on Sony’s end mate. Not Bethesda. Also this is a fan subreddit.
---
Problem is its not counting all the people who quit, we use to hit 30k likes in this sub every so often but lucky to hit 3k now so technically its overwhelming positive but thats since a lot of people who had a taste of this game don't like but you and me Papa we love the taste.
---
I 100% agree, it’s just such a badly made mode. I hate BR as a genre in general but of all the ones I’ve tried this is by far the worst. I saw a full health teammate in full health power armor go down in two shots from a rifle last night. Sorry but no, that’s fucking stupid.
---
Also it’s just no fun to play, waiting 5 minutes to play only to die in a minute to someone that grabbed your weapon before you or punches you to death abusing the fact that gun combat up close is a broken mess?
---
Bethesda NEEDS to reduce the wait times, how long you wait atm is just disgustingly bad and shows how disconnected they really are as a whole, 2 minutes would still be too long. I hate the mode but the wait times really just make it that much worse.
---
Trashy combat, trashy movement, trashy map design, loot system is trash. If someone had a nuke in the final two circles you’re fucked which is hugely unfair. Just a terrible mode all round and I wish Bethesda had just put new story content in rather than this trash.
---
All I see is praise for this mode? Have any of these people played other BR modes in games? As this is just fucking awful.
---
Thank you shall look at this news in case it happens
---
Will check out, could always use more fallout videos and podcasts in my life. Anyone have suggestions for Fallout lore other than Oxhorn
---
Wait, you got an explosive Gamma gun? What are other perks on it?
---
Nuclear Winter is definitely not for the faint of heart tbh
---
I will look in to this
---
I watched Kevduit through the whole thing alongside myself playing the game. There were things happening to him that were happening on my end as well. Sure the game had a lot of issues in the beginning and it made alot of fans of the Fallout series mad when it wasn't "the game they knew and loved".
---
Even with all of the changes, I love this game with everything that it is. They were willing to try something new and sure it didnt start out well, but damn if they didnt finish with something nice.  And theres still so much to come!
---
I'm glad to see you took the time to give this game a chance. I hope you enjoy it to its fullest. Coming from a PS4 player as well, welcome to the  Great Appalachia!
---
God damn this is a nice post. I'm so thankful your not a garbage cancer player who thinks the PvP is perfect and tells me to git gud because I don't like 1 shots in PvP (it takes no skill). I always have tried to help people out like this too but I haven't seen any new players really that recently and I've only been on to play the nuclear winter game mode in the past couple days which is honestly not that bad and is how all PvP in the game should work. Everyone has a fighting chance.
---
Agree with you.  People saying they love this game seem to miss how good it could be.  Even if they keep making it better and eventually it is pretty good, well that is too late.  I have been playing their meh game for a long time, for people just starting, they will have a better experience.
---
And the shop prices.....$18 for a skin, $14 for a sign is just ridiculous.  THIS is their answer to the (free player made) mods that we loved in previous games?
---
Yup haha. I found a noob's foundation and went to drop some mats on the foundation and no one was around but they logged out as I was standing there... also love to run to Flatwoods and watch them scatter like roaches when they see me coming to put stuff in the chest in the church lol
---
thats not really fair. you didnt play it before last month did you?
---
Cannon is how you want to mind it... but Mirelurks are just about the HIGHEST form of mutation from sea-life, that said HECK yeah, nukes wouldn't wipe out all deep sea life so there SHOULD be other mutation of sea-life lol
---
Someone else suggested that spawning in as robots, super mutants, scorched, etc would be a lot more fun.  I think so too.  Something about a bunch of overseers competing against eachother to survive in the wastelands seems very counter productive.   So having the vault dwellers vs the enemies of the wastelands could be cool...especially if there were different buffs/debuffs involved.
---
It's for the .44 revolver
---
Them little buggers gonna have to deal with our generosity.
---
I like it when sleeping ghouls slide around the map to attack me from their peaceful repose. It's hilarious.
---
B.E.T.A.       
---
Well in excess of 200, basically everyone I've traded with (mid sized merchant) and about 1/4th of the people I run into and chat with add me.      
---
Yes PC
---
Plans can be found in fixed locations once a day. Those share a loot pool so you just server hop to find specific ones. I’d say initially just grab any you find. Also, plans can be bought from vendors, from players, or obtained from claiming workshops and completing events. There’s also a traveling super mutant named graham that sells rare plans like the mirror ball. You can learn weapon and armor mods from plans, or by scrapping weapons or armor. There’s a great video I’ll link to this comment in a second that covers this in depth.
---
Edit: here’s that video https://youtu.be/diJLAwFAaUA
---
Stop ruining the experience for new players. This is a survival game and taking away all challenge by giving them stimpacks and legendary guns doesn't leave them much left to do.
---
It is free. There are loads of people who have been able to download it for free and who are playing it. So you may be looking in the wrong place.
---
Spawn in the center of the map, take off your jumpsuit, and then crouch in a big enough bush. Chances are you'll at least make it to the third or so Ring of Fire and you'll get between 300-400xp. I'm currently the old soldier who sits in bushes waiting for his moment to strike. I actually won a match earlier because the only team member to survive made his way to me and it ended up with just me and him versus one other player. I jump from bush to bush at need, and I can die doing it obviously because I usually only give myself time to loot one crate whatever it is, and I'm not being too careful to watch out for people (if I die, after all, I just relaunch). I don't even usually bother to fight, dying 3rd or 4th place is plenty of xp, but if I do choose to fight there are worse tactics in a free-for-all than letting everyone kill eachother and wear eachother out.
---
I would pay real money to have seen the face of the player who tried to charge my team mate only for *a middle-aged naked Vault Dweller to rise up out of a bush* he was passing and assassinate him with a gatling gun. Almost as good was when a team started building an entire fort on the lower level of the bridge and I just sat underneath, in my bush, watching them look around for threats constantly while I pointed my radium rifle up at them. I got spotted eventually, but it took them a good ten minutes.
---
Because Sony was a stick in the mud about it. From what I heard that maybe changed(rumor until proven otherwise). Also don’t see a problem with it anyways.
---
Haha, yeah, that's pretty funny. And creepy.
---
No when you change your mind to what is popular you become part of the majority
---
Really need to try this. Used to love walking around my camp in Fallout 4 and see my Deathclaw just walking around.
---
Yeah I feel like I’ve seem this sub hit the front page a lot recently with some actual positivity and now I really want to try the game out. I’ve been a huge fallout fan since Fallout 3 and never gave this one a chance because of how bad everyone said it was. I suppose I should form my own opinions about things! And maybe go back to buying games from gamestop and returning them after a few days like I used to do in college lol
---
So I claimed a workshop before I logged off f yesterday, would that have given me plans?
---
There are literally dozens of us that prefer 3rd person.
---
Yes, I'll post it here IF I didn't re-vendor it... not sure if I did lol But I don't think it was anything else good...
---
Me too. I’m just not that great at it because I’m a casual player. I don’t have keyboard shortcuts and fancy peripherals.  That’s why I like single player mostly. I’ve played pvp on halo and battlefront and it can be fun, but I don’t like it often and I’m just not never good.
---
You used what you thought was my age to de-value my argument. It may not have been an insult, but you used it to try and lessen my arguement. I brang up other battle royales because Nuclear Winter is a battle royale. Halo is not.
---
Left his video below for anyone who wants to watch it
---
[https://youtu.be/ghdOSTAda1w](https://youtu.be/ghdOSTAda1w)
---
&gt;on papper it's a small tad weaker, but doing the SBQ it feels like the most powerful of them all, no ider why :/
---
You know, that's a good point. I have noticed that myself.  Seems I definitely use less stimpaks when fighting the queen wearing Ultracite.
---
I doubt it but okk
---
Whats YT comments?
---
They gotta do something about that. All the load screens and waiting just to spawn in and instantly die is very lame.
---
Flatwoods. . . Yeah, definitely Flatwoods. Yup.
---
the first 10-20 hours of play is always the best part of a fallout game.  glad you like it, but please dont compare it to a MMO: it isnt.
---
Don’t think so, but could be wrong
---
Nah - never really played any of them - I've always mainly just played fallout..;-)
---
Wired. Don't think its the internet. I just have terrible aim unless i stand completely still. I wven have trouble hitting people in melee
---
Open your emote wheel, set your cursor over the trade emote but don't activate it. You will have a second option appear that will let you press a key to change which emote is in that slot.
---
That’s a thing, it’s under settings, I believe it’s under display. It’s called damage numbers or something.
---
I never saw a gamma gun with explosive effect, that would be very interesting.
---
So.. you paid for it. You paid for the bundle which includes paying for the game 😏
---
Yes. Go into your inventory and under the notes section is where those end up. You have to click on them there to actually learn the plan. Any you’ve already learned show up with a [known] tag in front
---
Yes thank god they finally making Fallout 76 into a Fallout game by adding NPCs and walking back that promise of never adding NPCs to this game.
---
“I was promised” lmaoooooo
---
I agree.  Yesterday was the most I ever saw. I was giving away lots of stuff at my camp in Foxwoods. Fun
---
What’re you using I still one shot them
---
went and claimed a workshop in adventure, and built a little fort with lots of cover and firing positions and saved a blue print.  First match back in NW tried it out, got my first 4 alive win.
---
Okay thank you. That helped!
---
Wow, aren’t you guys super random and unique!
---
I have made most of my levels claiming workshops.
---
You can, as the other user explains.
---
It's pretty nice.  Especially with the Scorchbeast Queen, it's easy for me to tell when *I'm* doing damage when a hundred little blood spurts are showing up constantly. 😋
---
Besthesda previously acknowledged it was a bug and corrected it with a previous patch but it seems it's back.  Last time around freeing up camp budget would fix it for me. I didn't try freeing up more budget this time though because I have about a 1/4 of a bar free already and it's allowing me to build more stuff in camp mode without issue. Relogging didn't help.
---
The patch notes said by default it's on in NW and off in the other two modes, definitely there though.
---
Terminals I think are very good. Being able to scout the area is powerful. Plus, I think it gives your team the ability to see too right? They should make an item like the Stealth Boy only for a short term use radar for other players.
---
Good stuff :-)
---
Why did you guys completely disregard the lore of the hellfire and X0-2 power armor? You do realize people care about the lore right? This is a big mistake.
---
Yup. Default it’s turned off but you can turn it on for adventure and survival separately
---
Ok, that makes more sense
---
....exactly what it says is what he means
---
Go to menu, settings, display, you can toggle damage numbers for all 3 modes on there, and stop you crying LOL....
---
where at?  I was thinking of a second account as a mule/itemtrader but a few days ago (before E3) all the digital copies were back to the $60 price and thats just not worth it for a nonplay acct.
---
Hmm, liberty to say... Liberty... Oh my God, you've got a hard on for Liberty Prime!
---
Nothing wrong with that of course, to each his own.
---
It’s a song about falling into a love that is self destructive, not meant to make you feel cozy and shit lol
---
Do you realize you are a pretentious blowhard? Or has nobody ever told you?
---
Show me where you obtained your data to get 3 weeks and 5-10%
---
If anything, considering it’s a nuked zone with mutations at least it felt plausible...lol
---
Interesting. That's good to know that it's not a issue with all players. I don't like to assume it's on the players end but I feel that not all disconnects are equal. I'm sure that some are legitimately bad servers that crash and plays dc.  But if you're having constant issues with connection, you gotta figure something may also be wrong on your end.
---
This. This right here.
---
On Xbox it’s the select button
---
Yeah, there should be more stuff into water
---
I wish our outfits could be used on our character in NW.  That would be fun. I have seen some crazy people in adventure
---
perhaps you’ll benefit from increased sensitivity of X and Y axis. 
---
also, Patch 10 will greatly diminish the time it takes for scopes to focus. that should help just about everyone.
---
People like you is what makes the wasteland go round.
---
Lot of extra hype because of free week too got to keep that in mind as well. At the same time adventure servers are overrun with new players as well, every server I was on last night only had like 1 or 2 vendors at most and flatwoods was filled with people.
---
*snort* I do keep a soundboard of LP on my phone for special moments in the game so... yeah
---
Definitely not for 76. They can't even work out enough of the bugs to make single platform play enjoyable. Imagine them trying to sync up a ps4 and a pc. Not going to happen.
---
WesTek probably nets 2k+ xp per clear out. But White Springs probably has more enemies, but can be competitive to say the least.
---
I'm happy they decided to add them, it'll add more depth to the game but I wasn't expecting it and people acting like it's the end of the world because they went with a premise designed without NPCs is a bit much.
---
Have fun in the wasteland!
---
How do you get your atom outfits in NW? I'm wearing the Maxon coat on my character in Adventure right now, but that doesn't appear in NW, and I own several of the others and they're in my stash... is there a crafting bench or stash or something in Vault 51?
---
No, saves and atom shop purchases will not carry over.
---
Yeah, it was also one of my favorite ones too
---
Dang I didn't think of that, been spawning near edges of map currently. Thanks for the info!
---
Honestly, as far as I can remember from exploring the logs left at whitesprings, it seemed like honest folk trying to make do with what they could before they got kicked to the curb by the bots.
---
They just haven't loaded yet. Same happens with the door to the tattoo shop. Sometimes it takes a few minutes.
---
These rewards... are pretty awesome so far. Loving that you're getting xp towards your adventure character as well. I can't wait for the Slocum's Joe PA paints. Such a fun game mode.
---
My  guess it that the hellfire will be 50 and the XO2 skin you see in the background of the trailer will be 75. And 100 is what I'm most curious for, with the zax door.
---
Oh. What level is the blue skin for the laser gun?
---
That sounds... suspicious
---
That's ok. I finished yesterday's  daily challenge. Didn't even check what today's was.
---
I mean, it's mostly kids on summer vacation lol. No money but lots of time
---
I had to.relog to.get it
---
If you tell me, I'll give you 10 plastic cups and an aluminium can
---
Yeah he said he just tried that and there's nothing about demo at all
---
Ha, I'm like Sherlock Holmes or something :p
---
If I had to pick someone from the Fallout universe I think I'll have to admit I always had a thing for Marcella, from the FO3 Point Lookout DLC. Don't know why, but I just do. Such a shame you can't save her.
---
Easy to armchair quarterback, and claim you saw it coming, harder to put money on the table, post in advance to prove it...  
---
And some of us are doing it, sure, maybe we are doing part of Bethesda's job, but we want a better game so invest the time.
---
possibly a 1 off then.
---
usually dont even need to sw. in things like b/mess for a lev 65, but these pair tore me to pieces. I wouldnt mind tho, If they REMAINED that way.
---
highest s/b has been a lev 88, thats what these pair felt like.
---
ta for replying.
---
That kind of defeats the whole purpose of everyone being on the same playing field/level. No need or reason to make players who have higher perk characters carry that over to NW. Everyone gets re-spec'd and may the best player win.
---
This helped me out a lot! Thank you for taking your time to reply on my question!  
---
One question; What do you mean with "(super sledge is 8#, a switchblade is 0.4#)"?
---
Lol I guess, if that makes you feel better. The bundle was discounted and I got $250 for a trade in, so I paid about $200 for a brand new one x and 7 games 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I am glad I was not the only one.  Fallout 76 ran much better for me at launch than Skyrim.  Love both games...just sayin’.  I was on ps3 at the time.
---
Yes I have one
---
"but i didn't get my canvas baaaaaaaag"
---
Where's that cabin?
---
Like a royale with cheese?
---
I did 10 and got perk cards... Pics in vault... Is there a list somewhere?
---
Haha no worries :-p
---
WORKING SINKS!
---
WORKING STOVES!
---
WORKING SHOWERS!
---
KITCHEN CABINETS!
---
Where can you find one at
---
The game is also 50% off (PC at least, it's likely less on console), which I think is also what the it's worth.
---
The game that came out 6 months ago for $60-80 is a far cry from what we have now.
---
I personally hope we get an influx of new players.
---
Anything is possible with this game. I have a decent PC build that can run 60FPS+ in 4K steady, but when I play this game, I have to turn down the depth of field all the way or it crashes.
---
I had this issue with FO4 years back on my Xbox and it was a precursor to my internal HDD failing. I got a usb SSD and installed the game to that and lived happily ever.
---
Don’t even get me started on the variety of WALLPAPER IN THAT DAMN VAULT EITHER.
---
I sent you a request but I live in europe, so yeah. We'll see how it goes
---
The Raider Rose and Enclave quests are the only 2 I've complete! :).  
---
Was super fun, really wish there was more, Daily quests from Rose!
---
There *is* a warning. People just choose to ignore it, and that's on them.
---
I see your edit, but yeah, juicehead is great. He still criticizes the game when bugs come in patches, but he’s given several overall good state of the game reviews and tells people the game is worth coming back, and covers all news/speculation for 76.
---
add a post apocalyptic bass pro shop and i'll never stop playing fallout
---
You are rewarded caps and experience when you die. No need to stay and watch unless you want to.
---
Ayyy!
---
Heck, even a shared objective marker would be great.
---
so has the support for mods stopped completely? I have a couple of mods so I had to rename Fallout76Custom.ini to play BR but now I have reset the name but I can't use the mods in adventure mode.
---
Here is to hoping changing the *way* it was said made a difference!
---
Nooooo not the underwear
---
They’re not very bright if they just quit immediately. They’ll just be “oh well this game is shit, what did I expect.” Like wot. lol
---
I've not seen anyone yet say that they got specific rewards for winning a game. Maybe a perk card for your first win or something.
---
Even if they can do things for themselves, it's still a good way to welcome new players and will probably make them feel all happy. There's no harm in doing it, and usually everyone will walk away feeling happier.
---
Could be the top placement people? I will try it out in my next game. If I don't reply it means it didn't work.
---
They were killed by Todd Howard himself before they could complete their mission. It was never the scorched, raiders, or ghouls that killed everyone. It was Todd. He killed them like animals, and not just the wasteland men, but the wasteland women and the wasteland children. They were wastelanders, and he killed them like wastelanders.
---
If I ever let my self get that powerfull, then i'll quit.
---
might as well go play spyro.
---
I recommend trying to vary your weapon selection. Have a weapon that uses each ammo type and a melee weapon for really low level/easy enemies. At the early levels a spear can be very effective.
---
Use the different weapons as much as you can. Hunting rifles for ranged work, pipe weapons up close with shotguns, 10 mm pistols make great autopistols - great at low level, and .44 pistols. By spreading out the weapons you'll find that you tend to start building up some ammo types and as you get higher level you'll start to build up the damage to the point where you aren't using so much ammo anymore.
---
Once you get to higher levels you'll find yourself stockpiling certain types of ammo for the really tough fights...first against scorch beasts and then against the queen...you can use thousands of rounds there.
---
Just try to find the right spread of weapons using different ammo types and try to avoid multiple weapons using the same ammo and you should have enough as you go up.
---
What overseer level are you?
---
Those camo paints really pack a bang for your buck
---
Good point.
---
They just don’t like BR. I don’t either, never been interested in pvp games. I haven’t been playing fallout for years and years because i enjoy pvp games, which is why i encouraged my borderlands friends to get it this week while its free but i have no intention of playing with them. This boring game is on hiatus for me until they do something I’m actually interested in.

Lol you’re probably right there.  What I wouldn’t give to have a “summer vacation!”
---
Lol. . . I kid, I kid. In all seriousness my spot is (and has been my permanent spot for most of my 650+ hours), no secret. Highway that runs alongside Pleasant Valley Train station. Perfectly flat, a nice little pond just off the road, Prime traffic, and lots of action/XP/materials within close proximity. Oh yeah, and juuust enough dirt to accommodate a nice garden by the pond.
---
Edit - Of note though, not knowing how far your are lvl wise, it could be rough at times. Lot of high lvls frequent the area, so spawn points give no f's if you are under levelled lol.  Super Mutants/Gutsies/Mole Men and scorched are the primary spawns I've seen over the months. With a very rare occurrence of a deathclaw and/or scorch beast. Of course you have the nuisance varmints that try and wreck your crib, but I believe that happens everywhere.
---
Yep its in the settings
---
I had the same issue on PC and deleting the ini files in the my documents/fallout76 folder (they'll regenerate) fixed it for me.
---
Its there fault if they join survival. Why shouldnt they get killed?
---
I've not had this problem with NW. I have had this problem after switching between characters though.
---
On the bright side, studies have shown that camouflage doesn't fool us colorblind folks as much as those peasants with regular color vision. Tactical advantage.
---
Apparently you can shut zax down at a certain level.
---
Didn't effect me and I've been in and out the past couple days
---
See, the last sentence? 100% unnecessary self-congratulatory word vomit. No need for that, it's a simple question from someone who is new to the game. Feel free to lord your Fallout superiority over others of your ilk.... y'all enjoy that sort of thing.
---
No. That’d ruin the game for people that are lower level m. Very unbalanced terrible idea. Imagine fight someone with 15 endurance and 15 agility. They’d never have to to stop sprinting+ shit loads of heal h
---
I have the vault 111 backpack irl.
---
This is just a taste. When it comes out maybe there would be different modes. Like duos or low level
---
The game is starting to look a lot better. Even the Battle Royale looks interesting.
---
Me and my friend just had it after playing 2 rounds of it, so just everyone's aware it can happen
---
You know, it would be a cool idea for Bethesda to make us able to drop actual presents with stuff in them, or even just custom paper bag skins that have colours or drawings on them just to make it look more unique. I know I'd pay some atoms for that.
---
Wasn’t sure how that was gonna go over...lol.  Pithy, sarcastic, dry humor is funny to me, but sometimes doesn’t translate over the Internet.  Glad the wait is over.
---
which one?
---
You've made me want to leave Faschnact masks at the overseer's camp
---
My point is it’ll make people stop playing 76, we want more people to play, people with nothing to do just killing new levels? Fun. Survival has been so much more fun because of all the new people. Before it was just seeing the same 20 people over and over. More people, the better.
---
Right
---
I guess not! You only work it out by experimenting really, rather than explicit help messages.
---
Never mind the list is over in adventure mode... Even has daily quests
---
..
---
Played 2 or 3 rounds with a friend and we both had to do it, so it can happen
---
I always go for the sarcastic side when it comes to the Internet, it hurts less that way.
---
Automatic imo might need a tiny nerf one clip of 30 i killed 2 guys in marine armor and yes was running master commando
---
Yup it was off. New I had used it before.
---
Godwin’s law! The longer the discussion, the more likely the Nazis will come up :)
---
Wow the duppers downvote bots are on point today.
---
I havent had the chance to play it uet as im currently away, but the way id seen a BR in fallout was just as something to do when i dont feel like playing adventure mode
---
To me this looks like the underneath of the fissure sites and a heavily shielded power armour. Maybe the story is to find out more about the scorchbeasts (and potentially get rid of them?).
---
Ooohh, here's an idea you'd might like to pitch to Bethesda then, a horde defence mode? Maybe something like a vault is under attack and you and a few other vault dwellers build defences for it and fend off waves starting with wildlife,  maybe ending with scorchbeasts and mirelurk queens. We have a lot of defend missions in adventure mode but a unique game mode for it might be cool if it unlocks specific rewards similar to NW.  I'm thinking a terminal attached to a weapon printer to sink points into,  as well as one for armor and materials for building defences. It'd be a very traditional wave defence game but I think it'd be nice. They could even add unique mechanics that help separate it from other wave defence games.
---
Cab you point to a single official post about it?
---
I like the bonuses too, but say they come every 50 levels...you should get 5 bonuses and not have to grind up again. Wheres the love for the loyal long term peeps?
---
Always check settings every new patch... You never know
---
I could do Piper. She's hawt. Caite's hot. I like Mama Murphy without her stupid outfit, put her in a nice modded outfit and she's my type with the short grey hair (I'm middle aged). Hell I even put Carla in some raider outfit and she's kind of cute. I need to get laid I think
---
It works almost too well. You can get into the last handful of people by reading a book, whether you plan to fight or not.
---
See my screen here. [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bztfw2/i\_am\_the\_forest/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bztfw2/i_am_the_forest/)
---
Position yourself right, in the right size bush (and maybe use brown hair and dirty face just for extra camo), and you are basically playing Metal Gear. You are very welcome. I just hope it doesn't catch on too much or else the end of matches will just be shootouts between bushes.
---
Some are repeatable
---
That's because ultracite is designed to be more effective against scorched and scorchbeasts.
---
Not for me. My items stayed in my vendor.
---
Ok the only thing I’m interested in, I saw a fucking plasma caster in the trailer and I want that
---
And steel. Collect and scrap their rifles. Loads of steel.
---
I still use your post to figure out launch codes. Thanks again for the write up. It makes sense and the game doesn't teach how to do this.
---
But how many of those people who were originally subbed actually got the game, cus i remember seeing a lot of "glad i never brought this shitty blah blah blah..." Early on in this sub
---
Well, you're luck then it seems, doesn't mean it'll stay this way. They definetly messed up on vending a bit
---
You will be somewhat limited with perk cards you can use later on.  A level 50 has 50 special points you'll only have 17.  For instance I got a perk card yesterday that required me to have 9 charisma.  My character only has 6 so I can't use it.
---
Have you stored or scrapped anything while wires were attached, that used to cause the wires to permanently apply towards your budget ( unless you move you camp )
---
The first match I won, it was just one teammate and I left from our original team and 4 others. Two players on the same team and two solos. We were making our way out of the house we were in when the two solos began fighting right in the street in front of us. The one in power armor with a .50 cal machine won and turned around just in time to be blasted by the two of us. 
---
I had previously picked up a grenade launcher, which turned out to be super powerful when used right, killing a 3 member team in one sweep after they downed my teammate earlier in the match. Back to present, my teammate and I have no idea where the last 2 are and are playing it safe behind cover. The scorch beast shows up and totally gives their location away bu attacking the other team. We use this to our advantage and I manage to crit shot one of the others and down him. Knowing this is the best time, I quip my grandeur launcher and charge at the last player who is no doubt reviving his teammate. I arrive just in time to see his friend stand up then promptly blast them with the launcher and win the match. I was super hyped.
---
There are people who play in third person? Only time I voluntarily swap to third is when I get a new outfit. Then I’m right back to first within 30 seconds.
---
Can you send me a screenshot of stats if possible? Also the game is more fun to focus around one weapon type rather than all
---
There is a public base close to the top of the map (you know the ones scattered around that anyone can claim). It’s literally an ammo base that has an ammo producer. 
---
You claim it, Connect it to power and the terminal and just select which type of amp you want. 
---
It pumps 83 an hour and to be honest I’ve gotten lots of ammo from it.
---
I’m away from my console or I would take a pic and show you. 
---
But that’s the easiest way to do it.
---
I think the big-ass red arrows are more annoying. And the fact that you can see someone's name and HP when your crosshair is on them.
---
YouTube comments
---
Throw in a ski pole and you've got yourself a deal!
---
Lead is a simple solution, if you equip the excavator power armor and head into Lucky Hole mine, you can find close to 400 lead ores down there each server hop. The problem after that is acid for smelting the ores. 
---
For gunpowder and steel, I farm super mutant camps/hideouts such as the lumber yard in the NorthWest of the map. Gunpowder on the bodies and scrap their weapons for steel.
---
I told my friends not to get it as a played at launch, the game was really really buggy. I most of my friends are casual fallout fans and I don't believe anyone would have stuck with the game at launch without being fans of series. I ran into a lot of issues where I couldn't complete quests, items were missing, my gun wouldn't, pvp was wildly imbalanced, and a host of other issues. I still paid myself but I think it was fair to turn people away at the beginning, it was not worth $60. Now that the bugs are fixed and you can get it for cheaper I think it's worth a try.
---
Yes, the underwear, and also sometimes a rocket launcher.
---

This is entirely true, but taking on a crazed persona and doing an in-depth review often don't go hand in hand. If you have to pretend to be angry over issues that aren't really as bad as you say they are it does a disservice to the rest of the review. There legitimately plenty to be angry about regarding launch without nitpicking minor details when there was so much legit broken at launch.
---
I would leave pvp for fishing
---
Eh, maybe you're just insatiable.
---
I did like Curie after she got her uhm... upgraded 'chassis'. I think her and MacCready are the only NPC's who's quest line I finished. Always had Dogmeat with me usually.
---
How about we don’t ruin a game for 51 other people and earn XP that proper way and have fun whilst doing so?
---
Ty!
---
I hope you’re right cos I’ve noticed since that last update that when I hit something I have to wait for the slightly “paler” red damage bar to vanish before hitting it again.  If I don’t, I can put loads of rounds into the target and the darker red damage won’t budge.
---
Getting a case of deja vue with this.....wasn’t this a bug that got “fixed” some time ago??
---
I might start using the facepaints and darken his hair from grey, while doing NW, but honestly as you can see there is no real need. He and the forest are one.
---
Trust me, I'm 400 hours in, you will revisit places. Probably even finish one character and start a new one and re experience it all again. I'd suggest reading and listening to it all and trying to absorb information but dont be super worried about missing anything, you can always read it here or watch a YouTube lore series to fill in any gaps.
---
The low level experience can lead to ammo scarcity.  Later on though with ammosmith, super duper, and stats capable of hitting West Tek, Black water Mine, and Lucky Hole mine you should be able to craft a weeks worth of ammo in about an hour.
---
Phew you scared me until i saw 'back to playing Anthem'
---
same man
---
C.A.M.P. vendors. 1 cap each.
---
I'll even give you one of my precious desk fans. Now TELL ME
---
I got it on my next levelup a few minutes ago, weird but i got it thankfully.
---
I already given up on actual PvP and sorta do that. I've become a zero kills overseer a few times just playing solo and pretending to be scenery as everyone else kills and dies around me.
---
But after the first few levels even when you win the leveling crawls along and grinding out token xp is so boring I'll probably just give up and watch a lore rundown on youtube at some point.
---
They are lying liars.
---
I get so annoyed no one pays attention I'll scream into the Mic and no one will answer and just walk away. So now it just goes on a random place on the floor
---
I think that's been in the game since the beginning, you could see one in Vault 76 on your player's bed. I wonder if we can unlock it.
---
Not insatiable, haven't had sex for over 4 years. That's all. It's time I think
---
Its not you it’s the combat system. I don’t care what anyone says, it’s just extremely wonky with aiming and hit detection.
---
The reason VATs becomes most people’s go to is because the free aim combat is pretty trash and has been since Fallout 3
---
OoOoOoh, shiny! I already did, lol. Look for the wall of text with **str8upnobs** next to it lol.
---
It was replied to your " that sounds suspicious" comment.
---
Yeah it does. I had a friend become wanted earlier because she stole from a supply drop.
---
I vote that they build wastelanders next
---
You can still swap cards out, and you will get new cards until you get to level 50. Don't max the lockpicking card or the hacking card - just get one of each: Regular, Expert, and Master.
---
You can google for builds and get an idea of what cards to concentrate on first.
---
Oh I will trust me!!
---
Similar play time as you and I have never seen that. I know a little bit back, someone found clues of an ammo scrapping machine in the game files. I wonder if it is related.
---
The hard copy for PC is a cardboard disc with a number printed on it to DL from Beth
---
“Everyone Disliked That”
---
Steel is everywhere. Collect weapons from enemies and scrap them.
---
Lead can be found in abundance at the hotel in Flatwoods, the Frire Breathers in Charleston, the gym in Vault-tec University in Morgantown, and the yard at the prison. 
---
Cloth and acid make gunpowder.
---
Scorchbeast gonna scorch
---
I got 3rd on my second match and the only thing I killed was a scorched beast
---
Keep in mind this game mode is currently a preview and will be gone on June 17th. I would wait.
---
I quite enjoy them.  I won last Man standing because a scorched beast killed my opponent.
---
You’ll like it as long as you don’t go into it expecting it to be like new Vegas
---
It is insane how Fo76 has games within the game. Not like mini games but like other games *only* have BR whereas Fo76 has both a BR and the core adventure mode all for the price of one game. Then there's survival for more flavor. And then on top of that, the adventure mode isn't sidelined and Wastelanders is expanding the game. All of this is free, too.
---
Are you in Australia by any chance?
---
Just wait. Keep in mind that adventure mode is still the primary game mode. I wouldn't change a whole lot, if anything, up at all. But that's just me.
---
Game is 100% playable without relying or teaming up with other players.
---
You can gets its health down with other weapons and then bash it to death with syringer.
---
I need this but for the lore unlocks (terminals, holos, doors)
---
Good point, I can see how that creates urges. I was gonna say "keep me posted" but that may come across a bit weird I think...
---
Not for everyone,  I think that's kind of his point...for me, it worked mostly all the way, only a few glitches visually that I was able to get past...but i fully expected that from Bethesda! At this point FO76 is more stable than any other Fallout and I have them all installed. Granted, I've also got most of them modded
---
I didn't know that lol, I thought they all were still on a disc.
---
Don't respec. The perks you use in NW are not the same as the ones you use in adventure or survival
---
Not really. For example everyone has the same base carry weight irrespective of STR. SPECIAL stats just define a limit to how many levels in perk cards you can have for each SPECIAL stat. 
---
I suppose it’s to allow players to make a Nuclear Winter build in-line with the build of their character in Adventure.
---
you need to go practice without auto aim (vats).
---
estimate, a good 60% - 70% of seasoned players, fell on their arses because they cant use vats.
---
nb. I'm getting on in years and play with ps4.......if I dont require vats............................
---
Fought a lv50, 65, and 80 all at once yesterday and they were barely moving my hp... So no.
---
Oh, right. Sorry.
---
^I'm ^keepin' ^me ^desk ^fan
---
Or hit the market sub and say your looking to buy. Most of the time you can get 2 to 1 cap if your buying a decent amount. OR take your chances going to the fire station and getting the lead there everyday. Also there is some on top of the monorail elevator.
---
Is the storyline engaging?
---
No  it special points are both connected. Which is why i can't equip anything good.
---
This is entirely true. My main problem was some reviews focused on things that weren't worth getting angry about. Some reviewers were like "The god rays clip through the ground!" and acted like the graphical error was game breaking while, say, not discussing damage bugs where shooting enemies cause them to regain health (pretty much everybody I know has experienced this one).
---
Be angry and frustrated over damage bugs, not a minor graphical clipping issue.
---
There's plenty of stuff that was *worth* being angry over but sometimes it felt like they focused on the little things that didn't matter long term while glossing over the real issues.
---
I think most people don't, so I figured I'd post.
---
edit: the bottom of the PC cover says "disc not included. box contains keycode to download content from [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net). account and persistent broadband connection required."
---
At any trainstation, seek a poster with a black monster drawing.
---
I’m with you on 1. The kills I thought I had were nil upon my end of game
---
You can still use mods for FO76!
---
What lines are you using for your Custom.ini?  Many still have their mods under [sResourceArchiveMisc], which Bethesda has currently blocked from loading resources.  I'd recommend using [sResourceAchive2List] and seeing if that corrects the issue for you.
---
"You can't do that in Power Armor."
---
Thanks, old friend.
---
It's very refreshing
---
Oh, the horror. Whatever will I do? Lol.
---
You on pc?
---
I'd recommend the "Clayton Ward" holotape in the lvl 20 area. It's behind the gym boxing area. It's one of the holotapes in a closed off area that you can actually pick up. Some of the areas contain holotapes that require much higher levels than the level required to get into the area. (I'm afraid to spoil any lore here.)
---
So the imposter sheepsquatch or real sheepsquatch?
---
Train stations have posters which you can interact with. Can't remember if it was on there or not.
---
Not as immersive as New Vegas, but if you are a fallout fan, it is still engaging.
---
You can swap your cards all you want and whenever you want. After level 50 you have the option to switch a point from one SPECIAL stat to another at each subsequent level up. These can be banked as well. You're going to be feeling pretty under powered until closer to level 40, that's just how this game seems to work. I suggest looking for Horde events around the Forest, Ash Heap and Savage Divide, server hop if you have too. They usually have a legendary boss that should drop you a lower level piece that can very useful to you. Other then that it's hard to give advice without knowing exactly what your build currently looks like.
---
Taxidermy shop in Lewisburg I think
---
So u want people to not do what survival is ment for?
---
And some are still riding that bandwagon. 
---
Rage views on YouTube are the easiest views to get.
---
Just a casing?
---
Thought you were saying they wave you down, and then use the throw up emote...
---
I could see it being tweaked but please don't take it away. Not being able to run forever is a nice change compared to other BR games
---
Hmmmmm
---
I bought a PC copy the other day.   Crazy that the box version that requires shipping is $17 while the digital download version was still $59.99.
---
Is the Slocum Joe's the pink with sprinkles or grey?
---
Just the quest in general, haven’t played much recently
---
They (should) only drop code pieces, not the keycard. Maybe a bug.
---
HA! Seriously, I am going through some stuff. I'm doing some 'rebranding' and 'getting to know the real me' and 'finding myself' etc. Hence the no sex or relationship or anything.
---
I'm not even sure I want a relationship at this point. I am looking into maybe finding a couple that just wants a sometimes companion. I'm not even sure I like the actual act of sex, itself. I'm a mess. I have no business getting hooked up with another human being sexually or in any capacity so there's that.
---
In ur underwear? :o
---
Thanks so much, should have guessed tbh aha
---
When I was level 40 which was back in November, I was getting attacked by a level 200. He kept trying to kill me but I ran away every time. We talked a little and it turns out we have a lot in common. We are friends now and I will remember that day because he gave me a Bloodied Multi-purpose Axe.
---
Yup sorted under junk and there was only one. I didn’t even see it I was just picking up junk and saw it add to my inventory.
---
That's not fallout superiority. It's common sense and critical thinking.
---
Special points for NW and Adventure are different? In NW you get 1 perk card for every SPECIAL and can equip and and unequip them. Adventure and NW don’t change stats of eachother
---
Imposter sheepsquatch questline is through reading the "sheepsquatch ate my brother" posters at train stations. 
---
Real sheepsquatch is an event called "Free Range" that has three spawn locations but the most popular is probably at Fred's BBQ just Northeast of white spring. I think you can even get it to activate by walking up on it.
---
Also, does bethesda still ban people for having graphical mods?
---
Excuse me?
---
pity..... ah well, ill' soldier on
---
This didn’t happen to me. Huh
---
&gt; 29 Slocum's Joe x01 Paint
---
Looks like I'm gonna be doing some PvP...
---
Also zoom right in and try and spawn inside a building!
---
If you stay on until your whole team is dead you will get a ranking, otherwise it stays blank. If one person survives you get ranked #1 at the end of the  match even while dead.
---
and gunpowder... and ores...  its a PITA to scroll so far down through all those keys every time you're at stash to see if theres any ore or gp to drop off for a few more grams of carryweight
---
Lol wth
---
 All tin cans have one lead and one steel. A tin can trap has 9 of em'. Grab those cans!
---
Dude I reposted this we’ve been talking lol
---
Yeah the only way around it is as  [ElderLyons10](https://www.reddit.com/user/ElderLyons10/) said -  put your PW and Username in the ini - it went away completely once I did it
---
The closest thing the game has to that right now would be The Whitesprings Golf Resort. Big White/ Green building to the right of the large lake on the map. Find it and check it out :)
---
Fair Warning, though. It is surrounded by high level ghouls, so make a b-line towards the big building!
---
That super slow walk from the mine to the train station though. All my buddies who aren't junkaholics FT travel to the station just to flex on me.
---
Are you in borderless window mode, have seen that that can cause a problem.
---
You forgot all the holotape games too
---
I prefer it going to MISC. I sell them.
---
I like em! That saviour of a beast gave me the last nuke code I needed to drop one of my foes!
---
This! Really can make a huge difference if you spawn right near a loot source and get an early weapon even if it’s melee
---
I have found 12ga shells that couldn't pick up.  We're you able to pick up the casing?  If so where was it located?
---
Yongyea is just "Hate Boner: The Video"
---
Any article written about a video game, he'll find a way to make a 10 minute video on it. Also he's still doing Fallout76 videos.
---
An angry violence orgy?
---
Hahaha so accurate!
---
I'm also on Xbox. Message me if you ever want to play. I usually give starters a lot of free stuff and help them level up.
---
Rest in Piece Mike
---
Confirmed: bugged (on PC)
---
At least folks can get a sense of how (not) on top of things Bugthesda's QA team is during their free week.
---
Spoiler alert: they also broke the Gun Fu perk.  I'm sure there are other previously "working" things that are broken./GolfClap
---
if i were in your shoes I wouldn't respec.. I would grind up a fresh character..
---
I guess it really depends on how much it means to you...
---
Fullscreen
---
Gold Statue, all sorts of stuff.
---
WesTek, Burrows, Whitesprings, Prime Fissure (both event and just killing the 2-3 Scorchbeasts), Defiance,  Encrypted (easily best option, even worth the 2k caps), Arktos, Workshops.
---
Nooo lunchboxes!
---
I thought the same thing, but ordering now for $17 and most people can have it in their hands before the trial ends.
---
Eh...maybe between 2k-5k caps if you find the right buyer. Vampiric isn't terrible if it's full auto but I don't think it's super sought after.
---
In the basement of Garrahan Mining HQ, where Excavator armour can be registered, there's a room filled with steel deposits that can be harvested
---
My bad. I didn't check the username.
---
WOW way better rewards then i thought !!!!
---
It should be 3 lead and 3 concrete
---
Yeah I picked it up. It was in the dry lake just north east of the summersville dam next to a cooler or lunch box. There were some feral dogs around.
---
Dude, everything is clickbait, that's what happens when you make a platform that needs people to drive for clicks, it only becomes garbage if you don't deliver, and I'd say Juiceheads been delivering.
---
Its a demo? Is that how it works? A demo that only runs the BR mode? For just this week? Not the full game? I encouraged some people to download it, it’ll be too bad if they don’t stick around.
---
I keep a shotgun with me and a submachine gun for when I need to spray and pray. Has been working great so far.
---
I've heard that as well, but if that is the case then Primed should also not work, and I did see a significant difference after Modding the LMG &amp; .50 Cal, at least on the scorched mobs and regular SBs. I'm planning to test the .50 Cal on the SBQ in both Hardened and Primed to see if there is a difference, if there isn't then I can quit farming so much Flux.
---
I used a shotgun sitting on top of dolly soda till it had barely and health and the them BAM a few syringes and it went down
---
Handmade by far
---
I play it as a survival game. Have had many great hours so far
---
Scoped levers and auto radiums are my weapons of choice.
---
.50 cal or automatic handmade. Both are very accurate at long range and shred the competition. The tommygun is a nice alternative, it's surprisingly effective. Idk why people ignore it
---
Oh man I hope so!
---
The have the same special stats. BUT, the cards in NW are specially catered for that game mode. It won’t change anything about Adventure/Survival. 
---
As I said before, NW gives you 6 regular perk cards and you get a new one every level almost. You will not change anything in your Adventure mode from playing NW
---
Oh yes. I had to move ten feet from my bush. I wasn't pleased. It isn't easy pulling a rocket launcher out of your dirty underwear.
---
Ah, I forgot to mention I meant as a weapon. I've got no expertise with full autos and mostly use random legendaries till the scorch beast land. I'm trying to find a reliable side arm.
---
Definitely handmade and also laser pistol. And one scoped weapon for when I'm in that last shoot out for overseer status
---
Not avalible outside US.
---
Well, I appreciate your openness about it. Unfortunately I can't really give any advice, except that sometimes it helps to talk about stuff like this :)
---
So if you ever need someone to just talk to, I'm here.
---
I think if they’re gonna spawn it should be earlier on instead of top 5 cause I think the PvE element is amazing with earning loot instead of just grabbing a random supply drop like in other BR games like maybe start to spawn too 25/20
---
I have found 10mm cases..
---
They will likely have some additional locations, digging through some of the files this morning, I see placeholders for Morgan Town (and like 3-4 other locations).
---
The maps aren't complete, pretty much just placeholders, so guessing they are seeing how the one location works before working up placements and tweaks needed.
---
(The files are in the last patch texture ESM, 07 I think)
---
That's so deliciously evil
---
Can't help but notice there are fishing rods in very specific locations around the world
---
My game has "send message" in game, for everyone...
---
Like individual casing? Or cases of ammo?
---
I think we'll get over it.
---
Cool I'm going to do some hunting a find one to pick up to keep for sentimental sake.
---
I did the first 50 levels or so solo, had a great time reading the lore and listening to tapes. After that I started playing with a mic and it was way easy to chat and get a large friends list, especially at large events in game. Now I almost always play with a crew and I can genuinely say I've made good friends. This game is awesome solo but glorious if you want to play with others. Remember, the people playing this game all have at least one thing in common with you, they like Fallout too!
---
Ammosmith is level 34. You're almost there. Things will get easier after that.
---
Thought I was looking into a mirror rn
---
Ohhhhhhh...okay haha. Well it wouldn't be bad. Handmades are fantastic rifles, even as non explosive. And if you mod it to full auto then you basically never die due to the vampiric effect.
---
It got a lot of clicks though.
---
Keep that quarantined, definately
---
My FE Handmade seems to be as effective as ever, but the displayed numbers are telling me that the effect is not functioning when used on a SB for some reason. I need to do further testing to make sure it wasn't just a server issue.
---
I disagree with that. I think about 20 hours is enough to get a good feel for the game, especially if the game had massive issues in that 20 hours.
---
In a single player game, being able to finish the main story and go through a majority of the quests matters for a good, in-depth review. But that same doesn't hold true for an online game as much unless there's specific end-game content which is with reviewing. And Fallout 76 had next to zero endgame content at launch except for the Scorchbeast Queen fight.
---
it is the full game
---
No worries haha isn’t it like 2am in Australia??
---
Thx for posting here.
---
Thanks bro just ordered it lol.  I had a blast last night, 10 bucks is just my thank you to Bethesda even if I quit soon!
---
No p2w mechanics. All the DLC is free.
---
You can level quickly if you do things. Explore, quest, loot, kill, scrap, craft, etc...
---
But it's free to play for the next few days. Give it a whirl.
---
Sorry should have put it was loose rounds that wernt ammo.. it just said 10mm case and it looked like a spent round
---
31 as well.
---
27 instead of 29 though.
---
"underrated and underappreciated" 
---
well there's sadly the problem of many of the positive youtubers, they didn't jump on the hatetrain to fame
---
Melee player here.
---
Vampire weapons come in really handy, especially when dealing with either flying or spitting critters.
---
I like my vampire 50 cal :)
---
Maybe its foreshadowing something
---
The game always had depth, it was just far too buggy at launch. By the time I stopped playing, I was having to rebuild my base every time I logged on, quest triggers were broken right and left, enemies were constantly glitching out and several quests I was invested in had just disappeared from my pip-boy. 
---
I had a similar experience to yours with AC Unity. Got it on sale 6 months after launch in a bargain bin for PS4. All the bugs had been fixed and it ran like a dream, and I loved every second. No Man's Sky and Sea of Thieves are another two examples of games that are miles ahead of where they were at launch. 
---
But it's hard to bring people back after your game got so thoroughly torched all over the internet.
---
Sounds like we've got a "Karen" here...next will be the demands to speak to the manager, or better yet Todd himself for an explanation
---
Unlike skyrim, fallout is actually perfectly fine to play in 3rd person! (aside from the shooting and precision looting). It does help a lot for melee and in NW it gives you a way better view of the battlefield. In 3rd person you can also hold CTRL + middle mouse/scroll button and then pull back the mouse to "zoom out", extending your view even more. If you want to actually hit things with ranged weapons tho, I would suggest switching to 1st person before engaging.
---
Oh thank you I had the mods on  sResourceArchiveMisc so I changed them to sResourceIndexFileList (because I already have one mod there) and now they work
---
Yeah that’s what I got but .308. Weird!
---
It feels disingenuous because it's not that person's experience, it's just a clip show of other people's gameplay and experiences. It could be that somebody ran into an insanely obscure bug that most will never run into. The reviewer never got to experience it personally.
---
I honestly don't know why they're even in the game except to slightly detract from the experience.
---
PSN is very backwards when it comes to being user friendly. They need to release the UI overhaul already.
---
Literally nothing is more annoying than knocking someone, and while turning to the more clear threat (the players still very alive teammate), my teammate kills the player I just downed and steals my EXP.  Even more annoying is when I die to said enemy teammate while my teammate is offing someone on the ground.  
---
I guess it works in my favor sometimes.  For instance, in one game I cleaned up an existing battle.  I killed the last player alive on a team, but got three kill credits (I’m assuming two of his teammates were still down).  Sorry dudes who did all the hard work 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
# Emotes should be free 
---
*(maybe earned via levelling)*. 
---
# The Photomode poses should still be paid - just less obtuse to use. 
---
*but with quick wheel activation outside of camera mode*
---
If there's the fear that people will balk at them going free - toss them a few atoms to bring about a better world.
---
Edit: We also need the ability to activate poses outside of photo mode. 
---
Perhaps a secondary level of the quick-wheel to trigger off of the emote one
---
If you’re going for a sneak-commando, The Fixer is an excellent all around weapon. Eventually you’ll want an automatic handmade as well, but the Fixer buffs your sneak considerably, which yields more damage. 
---
Where you’re at a disadvantage is your level. For some reason, the grind is the absolute worst between 25 and 50 or so. I think leveled weapons play a role here—they do less damage, thus use more bullets, but you don’t have access to the perks needed to really produce a lot of ammo until you get to a point where they’re less vital. 
---
It’s a good idea to keep a melee weapon on you for low level areas. Even if you’re not built for it, it will do adequate damage and not waste ammo. I have a few suggestions to make it easier for now: 
---
1. Excavator Armor in Lucky Hole Mine. That’s still going to be tough at your level, but there’s a hell of a lot of lead ore in there. 
---
2. Kill low level Scorched in places like Point Pleasant and Sutton. Equip Scrapper (INT) and scrap their weapons. This will give you a lot of steel. Super mutants in Grafton are also a good option as they drop caps and gunpowder too. 
---
3. Hemlock Holes workshop produces a lot of acid—which you’ll need to smelt your lead. Be careful though, it’s popular and people will take it from you. Make sure your junk is always stashed before taking it. Jump servers if necessary. 
---
4. Robots are a good source of steel and lead. There’s always a lot at the ag center near Flatwoods. Bash them with something, don’t waste ammo. 
---
5. Find a lead resource and move your CAMP to it.  A Google search for Fallout 76 resource map will show you where they’re at. Again, pick a low level area so you don’t waste lots of ammo defending your CAMP. 
---
6. Buy ammo from player vendors. You can get 1400 caps a day from the train station vendors. They will buy unscrapped junk, bulked junk, more valuable scrap, weapons, aid items...it’s not too hard to max that out every day. Look for CAMPs selling lots of ammo and buy any useful types at no more than 1c each. 
---
If the owner is there, ask for a bundle deal for all of it. Have them sell you X amount for the total price, equaling 1c per round, then give the rest for free. Some will do it, others will ignore you, but it doesn’t hurt to ask.
---
$17 on amazon for physical copy.
---
Whaaaat now glowing hot PA skins?
---
Have more than one gun, then ammo isn't an issue.
---
God bless this man. He will be missed.
---
Hating on Fallout 76 became a meme. They made it one. There was a lot to dislike and hate about the game, sure, but the reviews made it seem far, far worse than the game really was.
---
I don’t know, are you?
---
Why is it then that sometimes I'll go to a workshop, and go to claim it, and it says I need like 40 caps, but there is literally nothing built there?
---
I wholeheartedly agree, many fallout YouTubers constantly shit talked 76 when it game out and shot up in subs while many people who truly loved the game and made great content on it went unnoticed.
---
Yes! The only p2w they experimented with is repair kits but you really don’t need them and if you did you earn enough in game currency (atoms) by completing challenges. Also DLC is free so no season pass or anything and paid for by the cosmetics and such. The game is also in a very good state rn still has little ways to go but Bethesda has made it clear they want to improve the game. It’s free for another few days so give it a shot! And regarding playing solo I played all of my roughly 80+ hours solo still having a great time and BR game mode is a lot of fun too
---
Was there an anti-material rifle? The only rifles I saw were the standard semi-auto sniper with mods on it.
---
Au revoir! Monsieur troll ding dong sucker!
---
Its Vampire's, put 3 points in perception into Commando perks and you have yourself a sidearm to use when not in melee.  You'll need someone to help with mods though if you haven't learned them to make it auto.
---
Might be a bit late now but last week's Survival challenge weapon would fit in nicely for any unarmed build.
---
It gave me a card for +40% shotgun damage and bloody mess for +15%. So I enjoy myself a combat shotgun with +55% damage.
---
There's strong environmental storytelling, but not much else. You will see corpses, objects, etc positioned in interesting ways, holotapes and notes that tell you stories about people and places, but the quests are more MMO styled - go fetch something or go kill something. The overarching story about the scorched is sort of interesting imo, but not great
---
HOW DARE YOU, OL’ MAN MOSE DOESNT DESERVE THE DISRESPECT
---
I've got probably around 1000 hours in NV, around 900 in 3 (estimated due to playing on multiple platforms), 1400 in 4. And 800 in 76. Is it perfect? God no. But if you're like me, and love exploring Bethesda worlds, you'll probably enjoy it. The main story is interesting. The side stuff is interesting. It's not as good as NV, for sure. There are pretty much no options, you just have the story they're putting out. But it's still good. And the world is great, imo. 
---
I am also a mostly solo player. I group with my brother, this dude named Emrey (Some daily challenges want you to take a picture of another player), and the occasional rando if I'm bored and want to help noobs. But mostly, I play alone. Language doesn't need to be a barrier, though. There are emotes, and your english looks well enough in that title. Plus maybe you'll meet players that speak your native language. 
---
The bug issues that people love to go on and on about are mostly gone. Sure, there's still the occasional server drop, but I'm on satellite internet and even I normally have an uninterrupted play session, often lasting hours. 
---
If you're on PC, add me if you feel like it. We can be loners with each other's backs. IGN Sertith. It's free, give it a shot, maybe you'll like it. :)
---
My only real interest is the X-02, do we have anything on that? Is that an armour set coming in the future and thus the cosmetic items shown aren’t available until NW is fully released?
---
I'm not impressed. The game still has lots of issues. The menu is inintuitive for PC players (having to go through two menus just to quit or change settings is stupid), the guns have no weight to them and feel horrible to use, I've already come across texture glitches where the bottom of rocks is invisible. Having Perk Packs is stupid in itself in a game that tries to have some competativeness to it. Advertisements for the cash shop are strewn everywhere, even opening when you launch the game. I found it weird that I couldn't choose my hair before leaving the vault, and hated how it let me choose hair styles I didn't own. Battle Royale mode is alright, and is the only mode that the weird implementations of Fallout mechanics in the game seem to work in. People on this sub are saying how happy they are with combat improvements and bug fixes, but if this is the fixed version the released game must have been garbage.
---
Yes! I was wearing my scrubs and was a huge target. I think people were playing shoot the doctor. I bought the silver shroud and made it to the last four people when I died.
---
Yup been going solo since the begining. You will end up at some point doing events with people but you can just leave after.
---
Yea but I can't use a perception perk card in NW because it costs 6 perception and my special only is 4 perception. 
---
Same with agility. I need more special points to equip a card.
---
I'm level 14. I've got plenty of different perk cards. And I'm aware I can only equip 7 cards at a time.
---
Oh sorry,  I meant it more as a question meaning maybe it's just random and I found it odd. I should have put a question mark at the end of my sentence haha
---
Assaultron blade
---
I am totally realising it isn't now. That's the problem with all the bad online reviews; it's being reviewed as one and it's not even close.
---
upvote for the Clerks reference :)
---
Level doesn't matter much. Once you hit 50, you are effectively done grinding levels and focus on forming your build.
---
Neither seem to be working for me.. on phone
---
"Huh, this seems like a nice place to set camp--... oh, oh no..."
---
That's basically the only reason I enjoy this game over 4. This game just doesn't really care about being a Fallout game, just a cool spinoff.
---
Eh, I've sat through the E3 stream of a favourite youtuber and for the whole 76 bit he and the chat just laughed and ridiculed it, heh just ignore at this point, its 'em that's missing out, not us.
---
3am. Just waited 10 minutes and still couldn't find a match. So I ended up getting off.
---
The m79 is actually pretty damn good, just aim at their feet BOOM their down.
---
Aw thanks I'm good lol
---
No problem, just be careful with it if you have full vendors like we do haha
---
u/Valseek u/LadyDevann sorry for the tag but I filled a ticket like a 2 weeks but is hasn't been resolved so I was wondering if the crew was aware of this. Thanks :)
---
The early days were filled with a lot of little frustrations (and a few big ones), but it's always been fun, and "THEY" were mostly attention (click) seeking morons, half of which never even played the game.
---
I suspect you will be buying the game real soon, it's both fun and addictive.
---
Works for me
---
I started a new character this morning to join all of the new players.   Somebody was gift emoting me over and over but I didn't want or need anything. I don't use a mic and I don't try to communicate through Emotes so I had no way to tell them no thank you.
---
That's what I did, since I farm so much junk and bulk it I hit the 1400 cap limit daily, so I just bought bulk ammo with my caps. My play and weapons are so ammo efficient that I have stockpiles of certain ammo type
---
Never seen that. What does it scrap to?
---
It’s to keep people from camping. I don’t mind the AI enemies.
---
Remember when you could go into negative carry weight and carry unlimited stuff? Or when you’d lose built structures when moving camps? Or when you wouldn’t scrap bulked items when scrapping all? All the floating camps and impenetrable fortresses made entirely out of foundations? The floating confetti piles? Or even the more recent camera launch glitch? I love being a part of all the ups and down with this game!
---
People that hates this game are horrible. If you like it they will constantly hate on you are in Oxhorns case even dig up your PAST to make people hate you even though it happened like 15 years ago
---
Amazon has it for that in the US. It's probaly close to that in whatever your currency is.
---
That's good to hear. I wasn't that concerned that they would just focus on NW. However, I already feel like it took energy away from the "main" game. There might be multiple teams working on different things, but if they all worked on the main issues that people have been having since BETA, before implementing new game modes, I would have been a lot happier.
---
Up is Not Jump's review was the most reasonable Fallout 76 review at the time of launch. He shit on the game, but he did something almost no other reviewer did at the time: *he gave the game praise for some of the things it does right.*
---
That's when I started to notice the trend. Every other YouTube review (and man, did I watch a lot) all bagged on the bugs, problems, flaws, or issues the game had. Almost none of them ever stopped to actually praise the game for the things it did right. The writing was solid, the world building is fantastic, the sense of exploration was rich and alive, and the graphics and landscape were vastly improved.
---
76 can be genuinely gorgeous at times.
---
Yet almost none of the reviews covered positives, only the negatives. They weren't "reviews" as much as they were people just riding the bash Fallout 76 bandwagon.
---
So full auto is usable with bare minimum? I always thought the low dmg plus percentage inctease made it a bad value investment.
---
Wado?
---
I’m not in Australia but a stay at home mom 🤣🤣so mostly play in the day time in est time
---
Click the link to the spreadsheet.  Click the 3 dots in the right hand corner of the screen and select open in browser and open either in Chrome, Firefox or your preferred favorite browser.  The Reddit built in browser doesn't work.
---
It's weird you are so adamant about being wrong.
---
as a level 100 playing a new character, i eat that shit up. i even try to act a little clueless to maybe sweeten the gift a bit lol
---
there's a lot of good info in here, for me personally the choke point has become the gunpowder itself, or the acid to make more.
---
What is nuclear winter plz explain I have t played in a long minute
---
Damn I’m on now but get some sleep brother
---
Hmm, sounds like I might have a winner of a weapon then.
---
Count me among them. I only switch when my heavy gun glitches and won’t hit what I’m aiming at.
---
Juicehead's entire channel is built on shitting on Fallout 76 and reporting rumors as fact.
---
Tenderizer isn't changing the numbers either, and that certainly worked last time I tested. Looks like it's not showing real numbers, just a better approximation than the pip-boy damage values.
---
Handy with shotguns though: You can really see the spread and range effects.
---
I so get this being a Vet, the Brothers have the watch now Mike.  I felt like the only vets in 76 till I read this
---
I’m not in Australia either but do you gotta mic? Also in est time by the way.
---
this isn’t hard to understand. THE two modes are not intertwined. Your stats/perks from Adventure do not carry over to NW. I may be wrong, but all the SPECIAL in NW are at 4 I think. That is because you can equip say 4 P cards and 2 S cards or 3 P Cards 2 E cards and 2 I Cards for example.
---
Glad I could help out!  I always keep dated backups of my (.ini) files and that really helps check my work when something goes sideways.
---
I've had the same issue before. It just kinda fixed itself
---
I re launced the game and now it works for me.
---
It does suck, but for low IQ people things that suck are more tolerable and sometimes even enjoyable.
---
Didn't happen to me either.
---
Ok then don't watch the video.
---
Well if your purposely making yourself weak maybe that’s why You can’t hurt them
---
I like it.
---
Alternatively for the lore purists, broken fourth walleye
---
Can you run any other games at max settings?
---
Yea if I am about to hit max caps I’ll try to buy a shit load of 5.56 to make some space. Generally speaking someone has a shit load of ammo that they don’t use and would rather have caps for. I’ve only had 2 times were I couldn’t buy ammo at 2 to 1 (I refuse to pay a cap a piece). If they do want a cap a piece I just spend 30 minutes farming lead and scrap and make a couple thousand rounds for free.
---
I think 24 is the silver vault not statue holding the head. Someone mentioned lvl 12 is bronze, 24 is silver, and 36 is most likely the gold version
---
I bought the limited fo76 Xbox one x because of this game. Thought it was a good deal and thought I'd enjoy this. I played about 25h be for ei just couldn't anymore. The last nail in the coffin was me losing my entire progress and having to start all over.
---
Even the core gameplay at the time felt monotone and boring. The world felt empty even for launch day when there is supposed to be many people online at the time. Getting kicked constantly, items disappearing, camps not working, Ai enemies stretching... It was bad man.
---
Now I haven't jumped back in but I did see potential and I would probably play again after the expansion. Would be awesome to get a total different experience this time around.
---
If fishing gets in then I'll never sleep again.
---
They're incredibly easy to kill though. I took one out with like 4 shots from a tommygun with the commando and bloody mess perks. Just pop back behind cover for one or two seconds to kill it, and you're also guaranteed some more overseer exp at the end for it
---
I saw who made it. Might as well get the opinion of a dog or angry joe
---
Edit: scratch that. Dogs are useful.
---
I mean its a pretty big deal, it did get blown out of proportion but it's not like it wasn't some small detail. Hell, the only reason I replayed Fo4 so many times is because the NPC's, they keep the world alive and let you have connections to them, Valentine is one of my all time favorite characters in any game. NPC's make a game a lot more memorable and not having them when the series is known for having really good NPC interaction is a wildly different choice
---
Well items and perks cap at lvl 50 so its not hard to equal high lvl players if you plan your build. The game is doable solo. Only thing in main game i havent done solo is launch a nuke but that can be done solo with practice. With the amount of new players or old players starting new characters its a great time to start as theres less chance enemies will be too high level in certain areas. When you get to a train station read the posters on the wall's, those are the new dlc as is encryptied the burrows and arktos events but those are already dead to the community and burrows is only one doable solo IMO.
---
You can actually use vats for PvE but not really worth using most of the time even IF you encounter something because they’re so weak and not too hard to hit
---
Yeah that's all it was.  Combat sniper with a compensator.  People went nuts
---
There will always be somebody who is reading them for the first time. If you’ve read them all, select favorites in the atom shop. Customize perk load outs, talk to your team about how you play( what weapons you like to use, your perk load out, where to drop).
---
# There also should be emotes for nuclear winter specifically.
---
**They really need the baseline item-category ones** ***(affirmative / negative or confused)*****:**
---
* Aid Item Here / Want
---
* Armor Item Here / Want

* Camp Kit Items Here / Want

---
Been playing solo since the start. Love it.
---
That would be so nice. But if they're not going to do that, could they at least organize cards? Why aren't all lock pick cards, shotgun cards, etc, next to each other? (unless there's a way to organize them that I never noticed lul)
---
Kind of annoying that perk card packs stop being reward at each level. Also doesn't make much sense given you can get duplicates. I'm level 16 and have every challenge done for packs and got duplicates over a dozen times.
---
Yeah. It was in wastelanders trailer.
---
HOW DO YOU EVEN LEVEL UP? I played once last night...I didn't do to bad,,,its very FORTniteish.,, the rewards don't carry over into adventure mode....do they?
---
Wow didn't know this, thanks for the info.
---
My biggest problem is running out of ammo, especially at the point where it's your surviving team members versus another team.  More than likely I've only got ammo left for a laser pistol or something equally terrible.  The situation is usually a miniature safe zone, so it's trench warfare where the first person to show their head gets mowed down.
---
What's the wattage on your PSU? Have you ran memtest yet?
---
Only reason your PC would shut down like that is if there was a hardware issue.
---
Edit: If it was a software issue such as drivers it would 99% of the time trip a kernel error in windows. Or even a WHQL fault.
---
Thank you so much , for some reason people keep downvoting my posts so i wouldn't get help
---
Wow didn't know camps give exp. Thanks for the info.
---
I just wish more used headsets, would be so much eaiser and yeah, alot of low levels are paranoid or just plain anti social
---
Wahdew?
---
Is this awarded by your highest finishing score in any given game, or does your rank go up and down based on each individual game's performance?
---
Pause it and restart your pc?
---
Dude, this would be so cool. I loved fishing in rdr2, literally loved it, spent hours just fishing, great idea!
---
Cool. Stay uninformed and claim people are wrong based on information they have and you don't know. Jesus christ.
---
Burnt books are a meta trap - they weigh players down and cause you to search throughout your entire inventory for whatever's slowly draining your carry weight ("Why do I have a library of unreadable books in my Pioneer scout pack?
---
I keep forgetting to use the CAMP function. I wonder if anyone just built a basic house with no doors near the center of the map and hoped no one would find them. If you had it near one of the towns, people might just walk by it.
---
Conan has a mechanic like this and I love it. After so long of playing your meter fills up and an attack on your camp is imminent. Sounds awesome!
---
Its not clear. Are you talking Explosive effect or weapon?
---
PS4. Probably much clunkier than on a computer, but it just feels like everything hit bubble is so damn small. I took a scoped shot at someone yesterday and it went through the space between their legs and hit the ground behind them hahaha
---
QE teslas, BE lasers, AAE lasers for legacy weapons.
---
QE Harpoon Guns, QE Railway Rifles are hard to find (same can be said of legacy weapons but I feel there's been some duping that's been done with all of these more recently).
---
AAE/BE Handmades for high demand.
---
Pipe explosive weapons are rubbish but funny?
---
All those AAE/BE/QE weapons are genuinely good.
---
I have did just that. The size changed, but same result.
---
My problem is well besides me sucking in shooting at someone without  VATS, it’s hard for me to see the players very well. They seem to blend in with the environment! 😂 I don’t know, I might need glasses or able to enlarge the diamond icon of the enemies. 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
should you store your resource collectors before logging out, or does it matter?
---
Ah, that’s what I play on. And I understand what you’re saying
---
removing the placement of an item means that item still takes up budget. You have to actually destroy the item in the menu from the 'stored' tab to free up the budget.
---
Didnt read the Rest since EA stands for early access 
---
Hope that clears it up.
---
Is Nuclear Winter limited time or is it there to stay? I'm looking forward to trying it out but I probably won't jump back into the game until Wastelanders.
---
I have no idea what causes it. I always assume the shop is updating
---
Yesterday I set up a vendor in my house and after 10 Minutes a high level girl came and bought some things from me saying we should support the economy and then proceeded to give everyone around halloween mask and costume, man, I love this game.
---
Is it permanent for that match? I hacked it once but didn't live long enough to really use it.
---
# Make VATS the Ping Button
---
I've been stashing Vintage Nukashines throughout Flatwood and teaching the new folks not to drink strange alcohol :D
---
Usually that is true but glowing meat is the exception. You can stack it with melee bonus from other meat.
---
One lead and one steel
---
Yeah, pretty much everything else. I play Overwatch, Destiny 2, Warframe, Anthem, Fallout 4, Civ VI, Wildlands, PC Building Simulator, BFV with RTX on, Battlefront II, Generals Zero Hour, etc etc. They all run with no problems at max settings. Lowest frames I got was from Wildlands at around 68-72.
---
I agree.  They need to give everyone 50 special points to move around as they see fit for this mode.  I just got a perk card that requires 9 in charisma and am using a character with only 6.  I am not going to go into adventure mode, level 3 times and then change my adventure mode character so I can use this card.  Kind of a bummer.  Hopefully they will change how this works when the real deal releases.
---
Are you on console? I don't have this on PC.
---
Do you mean your own carry weight or stash limit?
---
In the full version, the limit is 800. As to your carry weight, it's affected by Strength, you can store excess in your stash.
---
I normally don't like shooters. I've loved RPGs in the past like Ultima Online and WOW but thats sticky targeting and I guess that's probably why I love Fallout so much is because of VATS. It's never really felt that lazy to me cause I guess I'm used to games where you shoot at the thing you have targeted. I played fortnite for like 5 minutes a few months ago and was getting wasted in that game too though so I just suck I guess haha
---
You can use the outfits bought from atomic shop. You just have to favorite them.
---
Ah thanks I'll delete my thread about it!
---
I just dropped some ammo for three players and they all ignored me
---
bitches need leadership too :) glad to see you made it to the top of your gender.
---
So does this reset every kinda season or something or do you just keep on levelling up?
---
I don't think Bethesda can afford the man in black. The cover artist is a good substitute though.
---
....A group of us should put on black cowboy hats and hunters long coats and set up a stage and band at a camp and call ourselves the Men in Black as a tribute band in the wastes.
---
I think this thread is about NW mode?
---
I've seen a few people mention a ping system, what is that? I don't play BR games ever, so I'm curious. 
---
Everything else I totally agree. I also think how the storm ends in a perfect circle is weird.
---
Nevermind, turns out it's a known issue and Bethesda has disabled this challenge intentionally!
---
Yeah I agree the people make this game awesome! :)
---
I run PA so the backpack and its mods are useless
---
Are these awards for use in adventure mode?
---
Compares nicely with the popular Gundam series from Japan. Power armors and their mobile gundam suits. Definitely not a foreign idea for them :3
---
The game is a lot of inventory management unfortunately, there’s a lot of perks to help reduce weight, and legendary armor to reduce weights, and back pack! But the game have a lot of this!
---
Always worth checking your ammo tab and miscellaneous for any weighty missiles etc but without perks and stuff you’ve just gotta carry the bare min
---
Pipe can be good because they take rifle and pistol perks. Plus .38 ammo is plentiful and junk to most people.
---
A guy at the fascnacht event was wearing it months ago. I assume it was taken from dev room? Hopefully will be released!
---
Depends on your build really - if you're bloodied then Adrenal Reaction will also help improve your damage.  Handmade has the highest damage for an auto rifle.  If you don't have any Tank Killer and just use Commando perks (lv 1 of each of the 3) then go with something like a Stinging magazine (35 rounds + armor pen) for additional armor penetration which will improve damage.  Vampire's is good on automatic/fast hitting weapons since it will help keep your health up, so its not all about damage done.
---
You're not though. You get huge amounts of experience for adventure mode in the BR mode. You could just play a shit ton of BR and eventually be level 50 in adventure mode!
---
(I'm level 155 and have leveled 3x from BR already!)
---
I don't think there are dolphins in WV.
---
That sucks. :(
---
Damn that is great but my headgear is ingame..thanks for the info, is it the same with weapon skins?
---
Yes. This explains so many things I have read on here. When Arktos goes up I message every lv50+ on the map.  I can understand why PC players are having difficulties.
---
You can do it, I'm lvl 98 and have been solo the whole time. you just need to find a good place to farm ammo and mats, Morgantown is pretty good for that.
---
Someone just posted it, but Gamefly has it for 10 bucks right now and free shipping.  I just picked up a copy because that is too cheap to say no to.
---
Wow! That would be awesome!! I won't be home until the 17th though, would you still be able to then??
---
yes, that's what I was thinking too, had a weak PSU once - took friggin' forever to figure out why the PC shut down after some minutes of gaming. Had a no-name PSU of X effect (light weight), by chance changed it out for a branded high quality PSU (same effect) that had triple the weight of the no-name. Suddenly, everything worked. Quality is heavy.
---
Ive found the submachine gun does well as well, but I agree that if its not automatic its kinda pointless. Also what this mode will benefit a lot from is its form of a ping system so that communication can be a bit more seamless
---
It's one aspect of the game to discipline yourself in inventory and hence weight management. The special stat in Strength helps increase your ability to carry more. As you level up, you gain perks that help you to increase your carry capacity and reduce weight of items such as ammo, food/drinks/chems and also weapons. Similarly you'll learn to craft armour that increases your weight limit or has perk that increases your strength thereby increasing your weight limit, or a backpack that increases even more. But you'll need to work for it though.

PSU Wattage is at 750W. I could run my PC before on 5.0GHz and a +120/+500 OC on my GPU and I had no problems except with Anthem.
---
I will try a memtest as well as reseating my RAM later when I get home from work.
---
EDIT: PSU is an EVGA P2 750W 80+ Platinum
---
Whatever you need to tell yourself that makes your little hate chode harden.
---
Any suggestions for lead as well?
---
Haven’t had this happen to me yet, but I can say as a new player, it is always nice to have established players be welcoming. So thanks!
---
I was under the impression only the Overseer survived Vault 51. I haven’t nearly read many of the logs and lore, but it seems to be heavily hinted at.
---
I was told that datamining has revealed there are maps for Charlston, Morgantown and Harper's Ferry not yet activated
---
if you are taking the silo, just die and run back in, thats all I did.
---
If they added this, i might never need to play another game again!
---
I think it would be great how you described with iwth rare fish and only certain ones available to be caught at night or at daytime, and exclusive ones to certain locations
---
&gt; promise

Best I remember, they said there "are no", not "will never be".

Good point about the lack of a pinging system, i'll add this to main post.
---

---
We belive BUCK BUCK BUCKEEEEETTT
---
Awesome thanks !
---
Facts tried giving my own brother stuff last night and it almost disappeared lol
---
Indeed.
---
To what end? No more Nuclear Winter? lol
---
Coward. Would you prefer a 3 hour long video showing each and every bug in the game?
---
Haha, well yeah. You can just scrap stuff without it being in the stored tab though, that’s what I typically do unless I want to switch that one item for another similar item (ex. One poster for another). I’m a little OCD and hyper-aware of my building space, my shop is my pride and joy in 76. I’ve always been able to swap one decoration for another and fully understand building limits. But this issue currently is more of an overall reduction in building capacity it seems. I may test it later by deleting more stuff, but it’s already crazy how much has been scrapped without being able to place even one new item
---
i found a gatling gun my first game with my roomate, and we won 
---
it's my favorite weapon by far in that mode, absolutely destroys
---
That's true for a lot of people, myself included but the game was sold with that being a point. People weren't lied to and told there would be NPCs, they were told there wouldn't be when game-play was announced. I would've been angry if this was Fallout 5, but in the end Fallout 76 is exactly what it's name implies. A spin-off intended to branch off from the main series and take a different approach, and likely create new ways to experience the series that won't have a true single-player sequel until at least 2025. That approach didn't work as planned and now they're going for something different.
---
If you would look at this FBI statistic about Black crime you would see that.......
---
When I go into the social menu, it doesn't give me the option to invite any friends to a team.
---
agreed!
---
They ain't dead until they're dead though.  If you just down them, they could still get revived and come back to end you.
---
You should get credit, but still, I can down someone 15 times and it won't matter in the long run if they keep getting up.  Finishing them may be a lot easier, but it's really what matters.
---
It doesn’t work for me or any of the 10+ friends I’ve played with since the update
---
Right there with you, I do play on an ultra wide monitor, but my fps struggles near camps and whitesprings. I have 64G of ram, i9900k and an RTX 2080.
---
Stop asking this crap and just try it...fuck people.
---
how cool is that ahahhhhaahahha
---
plus whats good in NW might not be whats good in adventure
---
u/zaidbettle

1. All rifles, shotguns, and heavy weapons.
---
2. Harpoon, railway, and flamer
---
3. Harpoon and railway
---
4. See #1 and #5
---
5. All energy weapons. The gatling plasma and laser are actually in demand because they are useful. The rest are novelty/rarity only. 
---
Any explosive weapon is something to sell. There will always be someone who wants it.
---
Is the ranking based on total summarized performance across all games, or is it your highest finishing position out of all your games?

I hope to have a range of guest from just your average player to youtubers, streamers and anything else that fits with the show. Atm with it being brand new things will change and adapt but this is mainly a way to interact with my audience and those that enjoy fallout.
---
Caps, those books are worth caps, one cap each albeit. But I use them to get to the 1400 faster.
---
I agree, I don't think people really bought it expecting NPC's but the announcement had people scratching, no, clawing, at their collective heads.
---
Honestly as far as I'm concerned there is NPC's, they just aren't human. Rose from the top of the world is a good example of this.
---
Unfortunately Music Licensing is incredibly complicated with so many factors.
---
*- You have to rent/buy separately for each platform (video trailer, video full movie, in-game)*
---
*- The duration of the song you want to use (the longer, the more they'll demand)*
---
*- When you buy a song, its usually renting it for an average 5 years before you have to renew it or you can buy it as a lifetime, but thats only to those who allow it.*
---
Ultimately, its much accessible when its a sample of the songs on a video trailer.
---
Like with the Uranium song in the Wild Appalachia Trailer and Ring of Fire in Nuclear Winter Trailer
---
They could if they wanted to, but I think they have their finance prioritized elsewhere
---
Rad storms would be next level!!
---
A lot of this is spot on wait time is a killer and things like melee weapons are kinda pointless compared to a good assault rifle. I really like the perk card system but I’m personally a little worried that there are some really op cards out there that only 20% of players are getting not a lot of people but enough to make a big difference in top 10 but still a lot of fun and more polished than I anticipated when I first heard they were doing a BR
---
Tbh vendors mostly have garbage stuff. Try player shops they usually have better stuff.
---
I think they might actually allow vault access from adventure mode because it’s really hard to hear holotapes over everyone’s grunt punching and 2 minutes in the lobby is not enough time to read terminals and explore everything in the vault. It should still only be accessible by NW levels and it would encourage people to try a new game type.
---
Oh well in that case some of the best games come from EA as the players have a large part in their direction. Minecraft is one of the best games ever, came from EA.
---
It’s a small issue because it’s just ONE of the dailies that doesn’t work. Bethesda is more interested in getting more players into the game via the free trial. More players=more potential atomic shop revenue. Fixing one daily quest really isn’t very high on their list of priorities :(.
---
For real. If I may speculate, I think he put a lot of confidence in 76 being his money maker, maybe made some financial decisions based on future income, and then was scrambling to get up after wards
---
Ya, been posted a few times over the last couple days.
---
It's intermittent.
---
Does not happen every time.
---
It doesn't look like it. Probably just enough so that people won't feel like they're "missing out" by playing NW instead of adventure mode.
---
Just use the emotes.
---
Simple system that conveys the basics and stops people from using slurs in every sentence.
---
I do somewhere lol my one kid uses it when she plays Fortnite so I’m not to sure where it is at the moment lol
---
Already there BB
---
Do you mean you have cranberries growing in your camp?  Did you place it on top of one of the known cranberry bushes or something?
---
Yeah, my friend has a card, I believe it's called Iron Clad, that adds Damage and Energy Resistance when not wearing Power Armour, I feel like so far this is one of the best cards in NW, unfortunately, I can't find one for myself! Haha.
---
Yeah sometimes that happened to me, but this time I was playing for an hour before travelling there :P
---
Anyway, relogging opened them.
---
Nah I've prob encountered half of them. Its par for the course for Bethesda, and rightly or not, they have gotten away with it since 1994 so it's easy to ignore. 
---
The worst thing this game did was release credit card numbers of players, but considering how often that happens everywhere people tend to be numb about it. 
---
People got mad at this one for the same reason I didnt play it until may. No one asked for an always online fallout. Turns out it's pretty damn fun and the vitriol people throw at it is just a tasty spice.
---
They are all the same.
---
What price you get from a vendor (and what they charge you) is based on your Charisma stat. The Higher that stat, the better. Also if you have all three ranks of the Hard Bargain perk, you'll get better prices. I never sell without Hard Bargain active.
---
In addition to this foods, drinks, and chems (Beers, Grape Mentats, Sweet Roll, and others) as well as legendary items with + to Charisma will help.
---
Is there anything worthwhile in the box - say like a map?
---
That's a pretty good profit considering what it takes to make .308

no map eh damn. Just wanted a regular one - time to hit up staples.

Too bad people are not going to read this. Tl;dr
---
I want the lobby to be changed up. I want Vault 51 to be explorable however long you want. You step into the vault, fiddle with your perk cards, your outfit, explore, whatever. Then select a thing that lets you que for a match, could be a workbench or computer or something.
---
Does it weigh anything?
---
Cause this game was built with consoles in mind, not just PCs.
---
*laughs in autogrenade*
---
Who ever 'they' are proba ly played it on release and called it trash from then on without looking at what has been massively improved
---
That, is a perfect Encryptid event weapon. As long as there are mobs spawning, I can actually offset tanking 2 pylons just by continually mowing down bots with my 1☆ V handmade.
---
The healing factor is a set amount per hit, the dmg doesn't factor in. I'm sure it would be just as effective in other events.
---
Yeah, I think saying no NPCs has just kind of equated to no *human* NPCs at this point, and a lack of dialogue options. Which I hope they give more than just humans dialogue responses, I wanna be able to talk to the lonely Mr Handys. 
---
I still wonder if that last icon in the first road map is supposed to allude to Automatron companions, they seem to be fairly early in development on Wastelanders so I doubt they're announcing everything involved but companions are confirmed so I can hope!
---
Okay. First impressions. Totally not what I expected, the lobby is fun, your not twiddling your thumbs waiting for the match to begin.
---
It's utterly stressful in the beginning because you've no idea what's going on but it all slots into place fairly quickly.
---
The team thing threw me, I expected it to be a solo thing, I didn't see a team of players taking me out, thinking about it, you can't stop people playing in teams so you may as well embrace it.
---
The Spector mode is a revelation; you can watch the tactics of the people who took you out, S'mazing.
---
Leveling is odd, but it makes sense after a few goes.
---
I honestly do like it; I'm genuinely shocked!!!
---
Ammo has weight.
---
Watch out for that.
---
.08 and has 0 cap value.
---
I'm new but I'm not stupid. It was easy to see early on Caps are the premium currency and water gets rained on you for doing events. Good for you though, if people are falling for it.
---
It allows you to tag things (be it loot drops or enemies) to alert your teammates of their presence.  It’s particularly useful when teammates don’t have or aren’t using mics.
---
It’s not the fixing that we care about it’s the fact they manage to break something with every update. I’m more sour about gun fu not working but it’s the precedent that a major video game company should be able to release an update without breaking unrelated things in the game.
---
No kidding, thats a really good deal, they really want people to buy it lol
---
Trader bots have garbage prices for selling gear and loot. Scrap weapons to learn mods, the same for armor. Only sell outfits and grenades, which they give out like candy. Set up a shop at your camp and hope for the best. If you keep it in the forest and with reasonable prices, you should make a good chunk of money from new players.
---
They could replace the VATS button with a ping
---
Save yourself the grief and just bring it down to almost dead and then finish it off with 5 or 10 normal darts.  It really is that easy and no one wants to farm rad scorpions.  They're a PITA to find and kill, the stinger drop rate is abysmal, and you will vendor or scrap the syringer the second the quest is over.
---
Wow haven't seen those perk cards yet, that would definitley make melee better.
---
Yes, you saw what I wrote below. I don't think F76 is a particular intensive game for a rig to run, so if you could run all those games you mentioned F76 should be a cake walk - I think. But it do sound strange with RGB lights shutting down and all that, smells like hardware, just strange the other games doesn't kill your PC.
---
I agree whole heartedly. Felt like something was missing when I couldn't find any energy gun perk cards.
---
I'm running action lass and marathoner and this is already so much faster paced than PUBG, so it's not niggling me at all. Maybe if I were a fortnite/apex person I'd be more frustrated with it?
---
YES!

Then, in my opinion, you should get 15 downed player credits, and the one kill credit for when you down him and he eventually dies, no matter who delivers the killing blow.

People are so busy bitching about what games aren't that they fail to appreciate what they are. It's a big fad these days.

Excuse my French, but why the FUCK would console players have text chatting when the mode with a KEYBOARD doesn't? FFS Bethesda. I know PC is only like 20% of your market now but throw us a bone FFS. Not mad at you, but that's just extremely annoying. I'm guessing the chatting function is built into your console social systems and BGS didn't have to build it?
---
Can’t argue with you there. I’d appreciate it they changed the bug fix updates to every Tuesday, but I sincerely doubt that it’s going to happen. This is one of their lower priority games, as far as I can tell. They’ve got more people working on Elder Scrolls and Starfield rather than Fallout.
---
I just started yesterday and already ordered the real game.  Add me! Same name on PS4 as on here!  Definitely looking for some people to explore with!
---
ahh Pivx it must be asian
---
I’m guessing that would be the frogs legs perk as it would be incredible RNG for every member of a squad to all get marsupial during a round 🤔 haven’t unlocked that yet myself so pure speculation
---
I had actually found some good random teammates, we decided to team up again, but for some reason we got random problems with area chat not working, we tried making a party but then got random NAT type errors so we coudlnt hear some people
---
it was all random, one game the area chat worked, the next some people couldnt even be heard
---
so its kinda wonky i guess
---
It is.  You can use VATS in NW to kill adds.  I’m thinking the original guy wanted to replace the vats key with a ping, but the other guy noted vats was active.  I would think Bethesda could map the key to do both.
---
I'm with you, I do much better solo. In a group I tend to think I can rely on them, and so far only a couple people have actually bothered to revive me instead of just keeping going. I even had one team mate wait for me to die, so he could kill the people killing me, using other team mates as bait pretty much. So much for team work. 
---
And since I super duper suck at this kind of thing, partly because of satellite internet ping times, hiding is a way better option for survival for me.

Lmao.

Wrong post but I’m sure I’ll get an answer...what do you get win you win a round. I did today, got really excited and then can’t notice anything new.

They don't give bans for mods that aren't cheating.
---
My biggest problem is that several times I didn't even realize I was being shot, since for whatever reason this mode seems to gently nudge you instead of kick you when you take damage. The same for shooting someone. The damage numbers appearing are fine, but it lacks the visceral feel of adventure mode when taking someone down.
---
im sure someones got some in a vendor.. have you done much shopping
---
Wait, you're me!!!! :)

?

Do you have to place high to get points or can a no skill scrub get to these levels by just playing a lot?
---
I'm specced as a rifleman with high PER, AGI, and LCK, and all I get in NW are STR perks.
---
I seriously considered respeccing into melee, but it's only going to last a week, with no set release date.
---
Glad to see I'm not the only one.
---
How else am I supposed to feel good about myself and free up cache space at the same time?
---
Might have to wait after the week is over, for it to show.
---
There's more to do after level 50 than there used to be. Three moderately-challenging team events rather than one, although the new ones still have server announcement issues so you don't want to start them without a team. You can also grind Possum quests and the vendor stuff is quite fun.
---
What you don't really get is repeatable quests with a consistent challenge level. If you don't mind chilling out, exploring, collecting some stuff and doing events with highly variable difficulty then there's enough to keep you occupied for a while. It's also surprisingly replayable.
---
Nope but they are in 76 on the river to the west
---
It would be hard to fit them into a livestream but it sounds like a good idea for the possible uploads of the show after they are recorded.
---
Me on a server trying to buy cheap ammo: "where the FUCK did all the vendors go??? aRGHHH...ah, I see everyone else here is level 2. Guess I'll give them some low level hazmat suits or something... \*grumble grumble\*"
---
So are these rewards for normal game mode or are all rewards locked to nuclear winter?
---
Man, solving your own question and updating your own thread, need more people like you.
---
The price you get is the same regardless of which vendor you sell to.  To increase prices you need the Hard Bargain perk and to increase your Charisma.
---
My first go i got all the way to 4th. Then when i finally found someone to shoot him and his mates came jumping and careening around like pubescent teens on too much red bull. I hate BR i refuse to jump like a lunatic.

Basic Chameleon armor isn't hard to come by at player vendors, although depending on your level, it might be tricky to find something sub-45.

Yeah that's what my friends and I were talking about on Discord as well last night. Weird as well since I can run Fallout 4 with heavy graphics mods on it and then my PC is struggling to get FO76 to run. 
---
I'm gonna try the reinstall and see what happens. Maybe it was just a bad download. Idk.

Not challenging to implement but time consuming.
---
Its not just the fishing animation and the models for the new fish/food they have to design but a whole new system for resources; similar to Brewing except the brewing system was more of an expansion since alcohol was already in-game. And to make sure its not repetitive with all the other food, drink, chems we already have in game

A bit, so far unsuccessful but I did get my paws on the warehouse building set.😁 That made my evening.

They play too often and aren't as endearing as classics like Praise the Lord and Pass The Ammunition, 16 Tons, Ghost Riders in the Sky, Country Roads, and all the songs by the Ink Spots. Give me more classics like those.  Putting in Ring of Fire and Big Iron to replace them would be awesome.

Everyone-else: If you want one add me on PC and I'll sell it to you for 250 caps.

You really clearly do though. Like this game is no different than 4 or 3 or any elder scrolls. People just flipped their shit about this one. Like how can someone stay mad at a video game for this long? So much so that they seek out other people, it's a crazy person level vitriol to a company that wants money for a game that some people like.

There are just a lot of new players spinning up new worlds and stressing things.  I'm sure things will get back to normal next week.

Id say its good for if you want to get the early game quest legendary rewards at higher lvls but if not youd get more xp from powering thru the quests id think.
---
Yea it’s dead sitting on the bank
---
I’m really enjoying this game but the fact that the first few rewards are “crates” that turn out to just be icons is kinda frustrating. Didn’t they think it’d be a little misleading to see your next unlock is an “epic crate?”

No, you've totally lost me.
---
Yeah mate. Bethesda is a garbage game studio and they rely on mods to make their games playable.
---
This game is a literal asset flip from Fallout 4. But no can't be critical of a garbage game because "haters".
---
I have enjoyed it too, but am terrible at it.  Here are my thoughts.  Load times are really bad.  From the time I die until the time I can get back into the game seems like 5 minutes.  Maybe this is normal, I don't know.  So after the five minutes I am in the game.  I have a choice, do I want to die quick meaning actually try to fight someone and go back to the lobby for another five minutes, or do I hide?  Hide.  If I hide and move toward the middle of the map staying stealthy, then I can make it top tenish most of the time.  Usually I get ballsy around this point and think, "huh I'm top ten maybe I'm good at this.  There is someone over there.  Maybe I can.... nope dead.
---
Let the newbies get addicted before you make their lives hell, is the point
---
Welcome back!
---
Me too. The usual routine for me (lvl 4, never played BR before): spawn in near my team, they all do a better job looting than me, I’m left with a pipe pistol and some bufftats. I follow them around for a while (they probably know what they’re doing, right?), then we hear shooting. I get too excited and go running towards it with minimal consideration for keeping cover. Then I die, bringing shame to my team (and self).
---
For some reason I can’t help but want to keep trying; it’s fun even though I blow goats at it. A couple times I’ve managed to down a newbie and it was pretty damn exciting.
---
I'm Adrios1 on PC. lvl 98, can take you around if on to kill things and do events. my timezone is USA Pacific standard time.

Exactly!
---
You wouldn't leave a pile of caps just laying on the ground, would ya? That's how I view junk, as heavy caps.
---
Where was this said? Got a link?
---
Because Bethesda didn't include it.
---
On #5, lots of people like to have backup armor, so auto-drop wouldn't be appropriate. My biggest complaint about NW is the Idiot Lobby. I'd rather just have a menu where you're with your team and indicate when you're ready.
---
So much #1. I've had random teams that stole 6 kills from me. I get 5xp for each of the players I downed, and they got 10xp for each kill they stole from me.
---
Hardly seemed fair, XP-wise.
---
There also needs to be XP awarded for assists. If I do 99% of the dmg with my radium, and then my teammate gets the last hit in with his wild sprays of .50's, I get nothing for it.
---
Yea, it the free week thing drawing people in and there have been reports on YouTube of newly discovered dupes, so it is more like old days than you realize.
---
shouldn't have to reinstall anything.. will likely just ask if you own the game after the trial is up.. then you'll put in the disc and say, "why yes, yes i do. thank you"

got me thinking; i wonder if i need my disc in during this free week.. always love not swapping discs ;-)

Its a perk card that allows you to jump 300% higher
---
Aside from possible exploit farming (not that I think that will be an issue really), I totally agree.  You should get some kind of credit for knocking someone.
---
Ahhh got it ! Thanks !
---
I was lucky enough to get frog legs in my first perk pack, it's INSANELY op in NW in my opinion, I'm able to jump on to and over roofs, able to get up to insanely high places and just snipe everyone, it's awesome and OP at the same time.
---
yes, ive raised my lvl 108 up 5 levels since starting NW, im now lvl 8 on NW
---
so if you were a low level, youd be raising your level at least double that id imagine
---
I've been dropping Plans that I already know around.
---
The vendors all offer the same amount, and have the same cap pool. There are perks to get better rates, along with charisma. Drink a beer first. You're not going to be swimming in caps early on, though. It's a lot easier now, since before all the vendors had a 200 cap limit per day and you had to visit them all to get each vendors 200 caps. 
---
Easy way for caps, Go to one of the farms, and harvest EVERYTHING. All that stuff sells for 1 cap each, so if you do a few runs (so as to not be overencumbered) you can easily make a few hundred caps in like 10 minutes. Also, sell the drugs you don't use. If you see player camps, check them out. Most have water purifiers that are unlocked, just harvest that water and sell the excess. If something in a camp is locked, DON'T pick the lock. But most people leave at least 1 purifier unlocked. Do all the events in the low level areas that you see. You get decent caps, exp, and gear. 
---
Don't sell your weapons, you want to scrap most of those early weapons, because that is how you learn mods. Same goes for armor.
---
Delete the game and install the disk.
---
Which is why I help out every low level I see and attack every high level like me. \*laughs in chaotic neutral\*
---
really a good question, if not it must be a cheat, i did see this several times last nigh in the lobby (yes i know, i die a lot,lol).
---
Players was jumping around just like in adventure mode when you use serums, very strange...
---
(was on xbox)
---
I have Action Boy + Marathoner in NW. I still run out at the worst times...
---
not that i'm totally complaining. It's a little annoying, but I do like the stragetic aspect here. I 100% *dont* want unlimited sprinting. maybe a small increase would be good, or at least have the perk cards do more so if you wanna focus on running more then you have to use a perk slot.
---
JonTron no
---
I guess my armor has never broken without me also dying.
---
I was joking ;) but i get your point and its ok to think like that. I bought several EA games myself dont get me wrong. Thats not the problem per se. The problem is that FO76 is the best example for the new art of publishing: throw out unfinished games for AAA prices....and i shold be thankfull that they compensate me with free updates? Hell no. I wont thank them nor will this change the fact that releasing unfinished games is a slap in every decent gamers face. "But you could wait until its proper done then buy it" oh yeah? Then tell me how fun it is to get spoilered everywhere. And game companies know that you waited years for this game and they also know how much you were looking forward. They screw you over man...i once thought like you but then i took an arrow in the knee haha. Honeslty i watched studios release unfinished games for years but fallout76 took the cake. And nothing in this world can change that...not even useless BRs in a fallout theme
---
Have you tried using Sign language?
---
SMG shreds, just isn't as versatile as AR and Handmade. Favorite weapon for close quarters
---
Mirelurks are the highest form of mutation of sea life you say?
---
Are anglers, Hermit Crabs and Fog Crawlers a joke to you?
---
Not permanent and only reveals enemies for the player who hacked it. Lasts about a minute
---
This is interesting, cause I hit my vats key in the first few matches I was in and it didn't do anything so I presumed they removed vats from NW. Maybe it's bugged?
---
Yes assists!  I cant believe I forgot to add that!  Good call.
---
Can't relate, I'm at overseer rank 17 and my items have not been reset even once. I've been hopping between nuclear winter and adventure mode all day for the past three days
---
Damn, it's a shame I can't join you (PC player). I'd totally be down for a conversation over voice chat though. Maybe you could do some video editing magic and have my character appear on a TV while I talked to you over voice?
---
For reference, I'm a small youtuber with 15K subs that's done a lot of Fallout 4 let's plays, guides, etc., some New Vegas, and am streaming Nuclear Winter a lot this week. I'm down for chatting about anything Fallout. I've written a few guides for FO76 as well on the fo76guides sub.
---
My channel in case you're interested:  [https://www.youtube.com/c/thewandererplays](https://www.youtube.com/c/thewandererplays) 
---
I'm sure my viewers would be interested in tuning in as well.
---
This exact scenario happened to my team twice.
---
Dang it that’s what I feared that download takes forever.
---
Can't say you are wrong
---
Costs around... 100 caps.
---
I like it, usually hang around flatwood and help with Fertile soil.
---
They really need to add that solos mode in the final release. I've been jumping in on my own and I keep making it to 2nd with like 5+ kills but it never matters because I always have to face little Timmy and his friend Jimmy and their marine/power armor and heavy weapons while all I get at best is a grenade launcher lol
---
Oddly enough a power armor always spawns 90 feet outside the circle.
---
No but close enough - I plopped my camp down on a flat stretch near the cranberry moonshine shack in the SE part of the map. There’s a ton of cranberries in the shack and the big and it’s a few seconds to walk there for me.
---
You need gourds to make the relish though (10% bones) otherwise you can only make cobbler (5%). My farm has corn razerweed and gourds so I can make whiskey and relish. Whiskey is awesome as a melee build with maxed out party boy (+6 str)
---
So turn on the damage numbers.
---
its a battle royale added to 76 on the 10th of June. its ACTUALLY incredibly fun, even tho i havent won a single match
---
Ya. crossing a road means I need to have my AP at full before I get there, and know where i'm gonna duck for cover when I get across it.
---
You can disagree all you want it wont change facts. Sadly many programs these days dont fully close. Always annoyed me so i have the task manager ready at all times lol.
---
I thought it meant "I'm unfortunately suffering and need a kind person to put me out of my misery.  Please, it hurts so much!"
---
Hide and sneak is my strategy too but it caused confusion to a team mate earlier, I was crouched naked apart from my wood armour in a bush on the edge of the fire when a team mate came clunking over to me constantly doing the confused emote, I almost messaged him to say I’d move when the 29 became more like 12 and the storm starts to move. He got the idea in the end and followed me shrub to shrub till the 29 became 4 and we engaged the final 2. I’m more than happy to let everyone else thin each other out before I get involved lol
---
Ah damn, so is the loot a better option?
---
I agree.. wait till after the free week and see if it asks you for a key..
---
worst case scenario youll have to start over..
---
The light is barely visible for other players most of the time
---
Legendary fishing pole: you can wreck a ghoul then catch dinner
---
Oh be critical all you want. It's just weird how long it lasts. Instead of saying fuck that game and not playing it you and many others run around screaming about it. You get so mad at others for liking it, calling people cowards etc. Which I really dont get. Do you know what a coward is?
---
It's an asset flip with a handful of new bits and bobs. New quests and stuff to shoot at in a new locale.
---
Tried to be the high level nice guy , so i dropped a bunch of plans for a low level noob and ended up dropping my high capacity backpack mod ughh. Didn't realize until the next day what happened, oh well lessons learned make sure i check to make sure im not dropping valuable items.  But yeah i agree with the post because the guy keep running away before he understand i wasn't going to try and kill him.
---
You are definitely wrong on the SPECIAL stats.
---
The point distribution carries over from Adventure. PERK cards and equipped cards do not carry over.
---
Darn :\
---
Good luck :-)
---
Kind of. Most of the new players I've encountered just kind of strafe back and forth toward quest objectives.
---
How does teams work? I opted it fill in a team and died in seconds! I'm so confused.
---
Pick perks that do dmg! Not perks so you can carry more junk
---
I got it for 15$ and I thought it was worth every penny. Good luck in the wasteland!
---
Wow you really like that one time you lagged out a game huh
---
I’ll do you one better, hook the ghoul to the line and cast it out as bait
---
And soon it will be better.
---
I only use it for looking around corners.
---
It is, interesting, do you know it's name ? i am only a overseer lv5 so that's probably why i haven't got it yet..
---
Will miss Marsupial though! Love firefights in MT in Survival, sniping off the rooftops then leaping onto another when spotted is the sorta PvP not really offered in other games
---
I would KILL for this. 7 days to die is my favorite game of all time and I wished for a long time that someone would make a fallout mod for it then 76 came out and all I can think is if they implemented a horde mode and a few instanced, longer raids I would never play anything else lol
---
Probably to give people time wi deal with cards, but that should just be available in-game, like Adventure mode. I agree - the lobby time is unnecessarily long and irritating
---
Yeah its true
---
No. You can clear a dungeon in less than 5 minutes.
---
Do we have any idea how long this deal is going on? I downloaded it yesterday for the free week and wanted to test it out this weekend.
---
I found out my iron sights aim is shit with anything other than scoped rifles and a lever action, i seem to miss horribly with gatling guns...
---
i main a lever action rifle on my adventure mode character so that is alot easeir for me, but yeah, i stick to the shadows and play hide n seek as well, Ive gotten the final overseer award twice as a solo guy, both time i never killed anyone, one time the 2 other players kileld each other so i ended up winning by default, and another it was me against a team of 2 as the final players, i hid and the scorchbeast killed the 2 teammates so i won!!!
---
What system
---
Give this video a shot, also when I first got Fallout 76 I noticed the FPS was REALLY bad on it, like 15-20 FPS just standing around, turns out the game for whatever reason defaulted to my integrated GPU
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJzgi3w5KVE
---
Go into your GPU Settings and under the profile for Fallout 76 make sure it's using your actual video card.
---
Yea and we played like 2-3 games and it happened to both of us
---
I like that you can upgrade as you go along, it's not as if your starting from scratch every time.
---
You once again scrap bulk items when scrapping all. Seems that was the trade off for bulk scrap not breaking back up when needed for crafting.
---
I assume on the fly building is a big part of it? If so I might not even bother installing
---
Upvote for not spoiling.
---
Watch out, a little mirelurk hatchling named Olly is gonna stab him soon
---
Keep an eye out for the event "Leader of the Pack" near the Tyler County Fairgrounds in the top left of the map. You get 3 pieces of legendary gear for killing all of the wolf bosses (although it will only be level 5 or 10). Good luck!
---
Not bugged.  Look for one of the diamonds on your compass.  That indicates an add is nearby.  Aim that way and hit the vats key and it should find the creature.
---
Yeah it is, until june 17.
---
Texting depends on platform. You can send a text chat on Xbox and PS4, but not PC (I think). I don't run into many folks using voice chat. On Xbox if I join a team we usually revert to Xbox party channel voice. On the console side you should be heard even if the other player isn't miked. Sorta one sided, but some communication there.
---
its a permanent game mode for 76 as far as i can tell. i cant see Bethesda putting something THIS big into this game and taking it away later. the limited time part is 76 itself, it’ll be free until the 17th as you may or may not know
---
who tf is already 33, ive been grinding and doing pretty well and im only at 17 lmao
---
Another dude mentioned this last night, saying MT, Charlston and Harper's are in there. Very excited, past week has been amazing for 76.
---
You're a coward for not looking at evidence I provide which will prove you wrong. Doesn't exist as long as you ignore it I suppose.
---
I am saying fuck this game and I won't play it. And in order to justify the "fuck this game" I explain the reasons why. Which are explained in the video I linked, the one you're too scared of to go and see.
---
Hell I am terrible and I managed to win a match. Because I got a glitch and couldn't die from the nuke radiation lol
---
Frog legs or something like that, 9 point agility card.
---
That makes that perk card absolutely necessary. They should be optional.
---
It was a bug that allowed you to scrap legendary items if you were scrapping several non legendary weapons of the same type in rapid succession, they patched it like a few days after it happened to him.
---
The could make rounds again. Blackbird paint came back. I think it's weekly changes when its not free week promotion.
---
I've played 180 hours and barely saw Graham for the first time yesterday, lmao.
---
You shouldn’t  lose anything. It’s saved on their side of the servers linked to your account
---
I'm starting to think that my lag is affecting my game play in BR mode. I play on crappy wifi... need to get hard wired.
---
Pretty sure it’s up for 2 days a piece
---
There may be hope yet then!
---
Hate to say it, but those bugs may NEVER be fixed, knowing Bethesda’s history. (Just look at Skyrim. It was other players who ended up creating a mod that fixed a lot of bugs.) 
---
I don’t think Bethesda is being lazy about this, though—just trying to prioritize their resources right now. This game desperately needed an image makeover, and NW and the Free Week is doing that. The community, as a whole, loves NW. Just looking at these posts here lately, all the newcomers are loving the base game too, and are surprised as well. They’ve been told “it sucks,” only for them to realize, it doesn’t. 
---
And that’s good, as much as the community doesn’t think it is. The more new players coming means more are spending money in the Atomic Shop. And that can lead to profits that can be reinvested into the game and that in turn leads to more resources to fix bugs and other problems.
---
It’s a cyclical thing, a lot of players don’t like it, but NW looks like a business decision for the overall health and longevity of the game.
---
Edit: Words
---
They are OP in ALL modes
---
yeah i think the object is floating is a bug introduced in  recent patch, building has been horribkle recently so i have stopped building new stuff  until they address it
---
It's called frog legs really useful...
---
I've made it to the win twice [thought I died w/ the last opposer both times....] but both times were with teams that a) had mics and b) Actually communicated about items. I sucked up a lot of rads early (gauly mine) and couldn't find any radaway but a guy dumped 2 for me. Helped a lot when the fighting started.
---
This is the weirdest community I've ever seen in gaming and I love it.
---
Yeah I should've been more clear. I'm using PC. I had no idea you could text chat on other platforms.
---
Nooooo! My 1400 Atoms, spent in vain!
---
"This causes my screen to turn black, then the monitor loses signal. The GPU will ramp up it's fan speed to 100. GPU RGB lights and RAM RGB lights shut off. Other RGB lights shut off as well. PC will have to be cold shut down and restarted."
---
That right there are your GPU drivers crashing and failing to recover, had the same problem with my old video card, I'd change around video drivers, try the newest and if that doesn't work try a few older ones until you get one that makes fullscreen not crash.
---
Should really play this hardcore to at least 29. Probably regret not having the paint until winter. Haven't played 24 or anything like that few games in a row till I win and done, got to 6 first day and next 11 so maybe today I'll shoot for 16-17. Maybe 32 at the end of the beta if I'm lucky. Thanks for the list- gives some daily goals.
---
Someone else mentioned assists.  Maybe the best way to do things is give kill credit to the person who downs the player and assist credits for either helping to bring him down or offing him.  Then downed credits can be removed completely without risk of exploit.
---
I just want your clan to hit up my shop. Pm me for details. Ill sell you guys speed demon at a discount.
---
thanks, very nice :)
---
Snipers?!?!? You're making them scrounge for early .308 and lead? Not when the OP melee builds exist! (Haha I hand out low level knives and axes)
---
NO COVER.
---
Drop the money, for the real version.
---
Thanks :)
---
whats the in game value?
---
Their E3 presentation just before they announced the last man standing mode. After they spent about 10 minutes apologising for how much they screwed up the launch of fallout 76, and how they are still trying to fix it.
---
https://youtu.be/DN0Co-wrElU
---
7:55
---
Now go get yourself educated before you start spouting off your personal opinion. Bethesda themselves have said that the majority of players don't want a PvP mode
---
25k is the cap cap. Caps are good early to get started, good late for serum recipes, but not much cap spending in middle. In my experience anyway
---
We have several players that make serums. But thank you.  Http://discord.gg/wr6vAa feel free to come hang out
---
There is a challenge to "finish" 5 NW matches, which means staying as a viewer until the end. Don't remember which challenge category it's under, could be WORLD.
---
is the cd copy needed for the installation ? it does not ship to my country but maybe i could send it to a friend in the US. He should be able to send me the key right?
---
Is that with a junk weight reducing armor piece? Either way rip, .08 sounds like a lot. It's more than a fully loaded bullet. So most likely this isn't part of that supposed ammo scrapping system
---
PC here, and nothing else is showing connection issues, yesterday, our two parties, one of two, the other of three, all playing in the same world, all got disconnected together, thrice in a row.
---
Sneaking suspicion that it has to do with regions, perhaps, playing from the EU here, Netherlands.
---
guess the game is still broken.
---
 **RemindMe!** **One Year**
---
He couldnt be scraping the bottom of the barrel any harder. His videos are low effort click baits.
---
I just started a new character yesterday after not playing since around launch. I'd be happy to have some company. PC also. Account is same as name here.
---
Twice killed by my own team mate!
---
Right? Almost everyone I've encountered who has only negative things to say eventually admits they have never played it or only played it for a few minutes at launch and refunded it... They're literally basing their entire opinion of it based on what other people tell them. I actually had someone tell me "I don't have to play it to know it's garbage, I can just watch videos and it will tell me everything"...
---
/eyeroll
---
Then why didn't the other Fallout games get the same amount of hate? Its not a conspiracy, the game was not good at launch, but thats fine, lets look to the future and hope Bethesda can make it the great game people were expecting and have come to expect from Bethesda.
---
Broken things still contribute to the cost
---
XP Farming is more consistent and plentiful in Adventure Mode, also in addition you have many ways to increase XP gather rate in Adventure mode.
---
Nuclear Winter comes with some exclusive\*{?}\* skins/rewards you can use in Adventure mode, so thats what I'd farm N.W. for.
---
Probably not till the humans come around
---
Help an* idiot
---
There ya go.
---
i'm so spoiled by Apex legends ping system
---
Also still having issues with this and I don’t play with mods either
---
I like it. Using ghoul chunks as bait 10/10 would fish again
---
I have a Bloodied Gatling Gun that does the job pretty well.  I'd imagine the Gatling Gun in general would be a good choice.  It does solid damage, sips ammo, and fires at a constant rate.  It's not the most accurate weapon at a distance, but these targets are nice and big. :)
---
Having a cripple perk, like One Gun Army, helps too.  You'll break the Cargobot's engines and force it to slow down and eventually stop.
---
Just wait, he real Sheepsquatch finds you... XD
---
You get Overseer XP + Adventure Mode XP + Adventure Mode Caps.
---
Overseer XP levels you up.
---
You get the rewards shown in my image above (and in other posts where folks have been listing them) when you gain Overseer XP levels.
---
And lastly, you unlock lore holotapes, terminals, and new areas within the Vault 51 staging area as you gain Overseer XP levels. You have to run around the Vault 51 staging area to find them, they're scattered around.
---
yeah, dont trust datamined info to much anymore, well, dataminers a probably correct, but Bethesda dosent always implement it.
---
3 nice skins was datamined for the Handmade almost 3 mounts back, i have waited for them ever since, given up now, lol
---
Edit, found it:   [https://imgur.com/a/8VDV0ai](https://imgur.com/a/8VDV0ai)
---
the lever action gun made it to the Atoms shop, but never the handmade, and i was lying, we are 1 day short of 3 months :)
---
Jet Pack + Sledgehammer
---
Combat sniper rifle.
---
Yeah. I'm with you. I use the same login name for most of my accounts, and I am currently looking for a way to change it now, for the exact same reason you said. It's not that I've met any really weird people yet, but I just don't know who is out there, and I certainly don't want to voice chat with people who can RL-dox me.
---
Oh it's the perk card aye, honestly it was insane me and and my gf were like
---
D:
---
New Vegas certainly did get the same amount of hate.
---
I've been supplying new players with brotherhood recon sniper rifles, since they cost the same as the short hunting rifles but pack a ton more puncb
---
I didn't know him myself, but I feel for you and yours. You can be sure I'll honor him this evening. 
---
Steel be with you. May the water you find in the desert not shine at you in the dark.
---
Run rifleman,not commando. Don't fixate on one ammo/ weapon type too early, or, if you do, never use it. I kept my handmade on the shelf till I built up over 5000 rnds and played around with gauss, railway, combat, and even some black powder stuff. Also a .38 rcvr on a combat rifle is good enough for average mobs while having a pretty easy ammo supply.
---
Holy shit, I figured the donut skin would be in the atom shop as a paid item. Pretty awesome that we can get it for free
---
Thanks, I got pretty lucky and almost didn't know what I had.  I briefly listed it in my CAMP vendor for 8k caps (like an absolute idiot) before looking into it and finding it was actually a pretty desirable combination of effects.  The third effect is 25%less VATS AP cost which, I dunno, is decent?
---
Anyway the new character I started to be able to effectively use the gun is level 44 now, just one more level to start using the ***Death Star***!  Am using [this build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f343cb8&amp;d=sq2s32sr2ic4ip2ir2l71ls2lt2a04ei2eu0sg2s22pe2s72cu2id0a12&amp;w=cr0at1lm2ag2a72i71if2s12im1ik0iq2ie2in1ih2ij2ii0i61p10sa2s01e00sb2pa0p80p90i30ia0i50&amp;n=Bloodied%20Heavy%20Energy&amp;m=2fc3e) based on u/knight_wanderer 's [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bgaoyi/end_game_pve_build_guide_bloodied_heavy_weapons/).
---
I never said the 5 to 10 was a fact. Most new stuff dies off with in the first 3 weeks agree or not I do not care. You can call me names all you like I am not 5 years old so it won't effect me but if you're ego needs it then keep it coming.
---
Note: advice not to be used in real life. Last time someone told me they had a gift for me it was a hobo who told me he had a gift for me in his bag.
---
 I got the clap. 
---
Should have known when I noticed he wasn’t wearing pants..
---
True, we definitely have some bias due to the fact that the people on this sub are the ones who like it most. But considering that there's usually a ton of complaining going on here anyway, and that r/fallout was notorious for hating this game, the fact that both these places are reacting so positively is a good sign
---
Hahaha funny story I saw him my first day near flatwoods. Figured it was normal. Didn’t see him for a long time after that
---
if you’re on xbox add me @ Copy Style looking for any group to play with, if i’m not online message me saying you’re from reddit so i can get back to you
---
Ohhh the video that talks about all the problems you think matter. I'm sorry about whatever made you like this. Upbringing I suspect. 
---
What I am saying I know it's an asset flip, I know it crashes for some people and freezes for others. Some perks are broken and have been forever etc etc. Admittedly I have no idea what the rum thing is. 
---
These are reasons to not play a game. However a lunatic would attempt to convince others who play a game how bad it was when they have never experienced it themselves. Those videos are the best though because it's a compilation video of errors. So one person prob wont run into them.
---
I've been able to do it with my sniper rifle which is a plain Instigating. The key is aiming for the weak spots (Jets or fans/rotors on the sides) either in VATS or with a scope. Might take a few hits, but it's a kill.
---
A Handmade would allow you to do more DPS, suggest Furious Handmade as it will do more damage per shot on the same target, again scope or VATs the weak points.
---
I do have an Instigating Gauss Rifle also, but I do fine with a Handmade.
---
Another thing: If the Cargobots are engaging enemies, say Supermutants...let the Supermutants do most of the work!
---
Thanks, I'll try to remember to do that.  This character is pretty much gonna live in Power Armor, need to get a good set with Emergency Protocols.
---
Lol, this happened to me last night. Wasn’t sure what was happening. Then it took me a few mins to figure out the basic controls. I didn’t have my mic plugged in because I was expecting to use it honestly. Was really nice to see a helpful player as soon as I exited the vault.
---
&gt;the hate train started strong as soon as they said "completely online."
---
Exactly.
---
*THIS ISN'T REAL FALLOUT*
---
*FALLOUT IS A SINGLE PLAYER GAME*
---
No, Fallout is a UNIVERSE and there can be many different types of games from that universe, look at Warcraft: it has 3 RTSs, 1 MMO and a card game, none of them takes away from the other in fact they support each other and help to further the lore.
---
I can't be the only one who gets a bit sick from the limited FOV of first person?? The lack of an FOV slider really bugs me. I play in 3rd person all the time for the wider FOV, which doesn't hurt my eyes the way first person in this game does.
---
Scrap them to unlock mods!
---
I use an explosive lever - one good shot on the motors and it's toast. Used to take me a while to get that good shot in - now I can do it all in about 5 mins depending on how far out it is from me. As for the Vertibots... explosive lever just shreds them.
---
I think it just shuts him up. Please don't get rid of NW
---
Actually, I much prefer combat in third person. The iron sights on some weapons are absolute garbage compared to the single dot it gives you in 3rd. Also, increased spatial awareness if some ghoul is about to hit your back, especially if you zoom out.
---
If the rewards that are items transfer over to Adventure Mode, does that mean that hypothetically someone could just straight up sell them in their CAMP shop for players that are too lazy / intimidated to play Nuclear Winter?
---
I think the heart thing comes from defeating a tough enemy such as the SQB, I see a lot of hearts thrown around once she's dead.
---
GORGEOUS. I loved the photo of the nuclear zone, how it’s just out of range of those houses and former homes. And the image of the dweller in the cave (or forest?), with those lights raining down. All the ones of dwellers playing instruments were great too.
---
Man, your loading screens must be awesome.
---
I still don’t know how to do the exams
---
Chuck Norris got an erection again
---
Yeah, being on the wrong side of spawning into a building with someone else that gets the weapon first really sucks. I found out the hard way that a laser pistol is a lot deadlier than fists...
---
Just 1 cap
---
I'd also add a monorail system. Fishing sounds like a great idea!
---
Without revealing too much - it's a simulation. Find the terminal to shut it off
---
Cool, I needed to reorganize my vending. Guess I'll get to that on the 18th.
---
Its a fucking plague in our time of living.
---
Nope. Not even a real disk. Just disk-shaped cardboard with a code on it.
---
Nice I'll hit you up!
---
I found the game almost unplayable until I put it on ssd drives.  It is extremely resource heavy.  I find on my quad core cpu with 12gb of ram it uses almost 50% cpu and 3gb of ram and if you are paging ram forget about playing unless you do have it on ssd
---
Use throwing knives
---
same, as annoying as I can be pinging all over the place it really does help haha
---
Whado?
---
Certainly works for the NW ! that Ring of fire will get you..
---
They recently added an option on Bethesda's site to set a "Display Name" for your account that can be different from your account name.  You can use that to change your in-game name.  Log in to their web site (bethesda.net) to do this.
---
As far as why they don't use the character names, your guess is as good as mine.  It's long been a mystery.
---
Just watched the Twin Peaks video. So eerie, great work! Wish I could be an extra, but I'm on PS4.
---
Yes, I see way less camps nowdays and a lot of low level players. They yet to have set up their shops.
---
And finaly they started to take my free ammos! Whoo, my stash have space.
---
It's a free trial for a reason, so you have a chance to try it. Try it.
---
probably Bethesda
---
Yeah I meant to hold off until I heard it was fixed but I got impatient and suffered the consequences. The thing is though I can't even get anything to turn green anymore when going to place them on the support beams. I really hope they fix it
---
My vendor makes almost zero caps since there are more new players than old ones on the servers.
---
Perhaps I should move my shop to the forest and sell stimpacks and stuff like that.
---
Alpine River Cabins are supposed to be a haunted place in the game
---
When do you get the power armor skin? Asking for a friend!
---
If your on xbox I could be an extra
---
I don't have an integrated GPU. :/  
---
And VSync won't matter in my case, since it'll go up to 144hz even with it on.
---
Yep or some of us will greet you and help you out with some good stuff too start off with
---
3rd person for peeking around corners in NW.
---
3rd person for firing the Gatling Gun so I get a dot reticle.
---
1st person for everything else
---
Would be good to have a faster way to gift them too. Instead of dropping bags could maybe have a drag and drop to their inventory option.
---
Me too no worries, just let these new players growing, help them if you want.
---
They bring a fresh air to this game which is pretty cool
---
You can use a total of 7 perk cards in NW. You can also only use what your max special stats are for that category.
---
Sorry, didn't notice this. It is the "Explorer Outfit". I found it in one of the scout towers
---
Thank you! I spend much more time than I care to admit on the photo modes. My loading screens are awesome though, I've taken nearly 500 images! Thanks for the awesome comment :)
---
Does dropping a camp in BR move it in adventure? I'd imagine not but still, thought I should ask
---
Talk about having skill, that a humble brag?
---
Yeah I'm just an idiot it's because I'm wanted
---
I will be your man from another place any day!
---
I personally disliked fo4 a lot more than 76. Conspiracy and circle jerk aren't the same thing.
---
Ahh, good to know. Thanks!
---
This happened to me before the gift emote came out. Harleybikerman on PS4. You are a gent sir.
---
the perk cards are for nuclear winter only
---
Yeah those are great ideas!
---
I’m in the low 80s and I’ve been around since the Beta 🤣🤣
---
That's been my thinking from the start the vault should be free to roam without a timer then you should have to select to search for a match, as for only automatic weapons are good totally disagree with that to me the best weapons by far are the scoped weapons like hunting rifle and combat sniper at range anyway if your at range and you've got automatic weapon and someone's got scoped rifle your getting dropped also I think the perk card setup needs a revamp if your level 50+ player you've got massive advantage over new players due to special points determining what cards you can add to your setup I love this game mode haven't been in adventure for 2 days but waiting times between games is frustrating 100% needs addressing hopefully there will be a different match making system when beta launches after all this is pre beta
---
Not all people knew they wanted a Battle Royal.
---
I was recommending that you try, I could never pull that off
---
Keep exploring the area. :)
---
Not a dumb question. Those packs are for Nuclear Winter. They seem to be cards specifically tailored to that mode.
---
Do not play any competition game via WLAN and with wireless input devices!
---
It's all of the people joining the game because it's free, the servers weren't ready.
---
Ya, I wonder how the "Let's pet a Scorched Beast" mission would fair?
---
I mean I get why they would want that...some d-bags promised to hate on it before it even launched because it wasn't FO5 which they were expecting...got many subs and people noticed that and so the train picked up speed
---
Seems exaggerated, the whole fo76 presentation is barely 10 minutes. I re-watched the fallout presentation and nowhere did they say anything along the lines not wanting a battle royale mode.
---
A level 34 guy spent thousands of caps in my camp last night. When I tried to give his a freebie of some shielded under armor but he ran away like I was trying to rip him off. Gift emoji and all the rest!
---
I see that the Slocum joe Pip-Boy skin is a NW reward - hold out faith (and maybe drop a support ticket lol) that for the real one you’ll get those as free rewards like the shark pistol which looks great.
---
Well I'm glad I'm not the only one. I understand the trash mob is there to disrupt camping but god damn it's annoying.
---
Ah, that could also be a big factor. Didnt even consider the different regions. I'm NA, and I guess I'm one of the fortunate ones.
---
&gt; I am in love with Courtney Ford's voice
---
Ya.. and half a million others of us.. Yum!
---
Yes, it's worth it. There are a lot of new players coming in (so you won't be alone) and you have the advantage of being able to be helped by the higher level players. 
---
I play pretty casually and just barely hit lvl 50. And then I started a new character.
---
I really wanted that glow in the dark map to frame and put on my wall in my man cave. But the only version you can get it is in the collectors edition. Funny enough they announced at the e3 reveal it would star the next day. Instead it started i think about an hour and a half after the announcement. Woke up to a sold out situation.
---
Thanks for taking a look! 
---
Can you capture footage on PS4? Would happily share my technique for others to try or discuss scenes, have someone take footage and send to me to work some editing and audio magic!
---
Some people slate the game engine but I think it looks great; you can achieve some fantastic cinematography in the game, particularly in Photomode. Love it!
---
How are the for compared to xbox?
---
I tried but then some random creature appeared out of nowhere, flew away in a black mass, and now combat music is playing ON TOP of screaming
---
Wait, Johnny Cash's Ring of Fire is considered pop/punk??? Wouldn't it more considered country/rock?
---
Please no 😩 I’m well beyond sick of tedious grind gated with fishing
---
You cannot force me to change to your view. As I said agree to differ. And I agree the facts are the facts &amp; we don't agree on them.
---
You stated ALL programs which is factually incorrect then you changed your position to many. Stop looking for a fight Bye
---
Fps*
---
??
---
I'm also a solo player who has been a longtime Fallout franchise fan. I love the game and have been playing since beta. 
---
I love 76. It has its quirks, but you can play 100% solo with no pvp and still have a great time. Especially if you love the RP. 
---
I'm only level 74, most days I spawn in and walk the roads between Morgantown and Charleston with my Ranger hat and .50 cal hunting rifle, pretending to be a ranger and reminding the new players that only they can prevent wildfires.
---
North of the map is great for acid and one of the workshops in toxic valley has 3 acid nodes.  Defense missions are good xp anyway so i almost always get one going when i start.
---
If you dont want to bother with workshops garages have a bunch of canisters that have acid.
---
Mark what your looking for and be surprised at all the good junk you have been passing!
---
10 bucks on Gamefly :O
---
same problem here
---
You don't even have to kill anyone else in NW. The xp progression is faster just staying alive, than actually registering kills. You can sharpen your sneaky skills, you get XP based on how long you survive.
---
Use it in a pistol build???
---
Can’t wait to see it for myself now lol
---
That would be a Mothman. There are different kinds but most like to stalk players.
---
Random event. 
---
Been playing since BETA and still never gotten one.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Mothman
---
Kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill.
---
With the right mods and perks it’s formidable against some more humanoid enemies like scorched or ghouls.
---
I'll be sure to join today 👍👍👍
---
Go in one of the cabins and watch the pictures. You'll figure it out.
---
And we wonder why the country/world is so crazy...  
---
I'd make a terrible "Influencer"...   
---
Seems being frank and honest is boring and unwelcome.
---
My wife took out two people last night.  Game seems like anyone can win.
---
Gamefly has it for 10 in the US
---
He scared the literal shit out of me hahaha
---
best idea
---
Certainly am!
---
If you watch the Psycho thing; I have two xboxes - my old one and my XB1X... that’s me on two accounts, switching channels and controllers 😂😂  Really helped for trying to spawn the travelling vendor bot but tricky for cinema! 😂
---
Ya no chance I could either lmao
---
Thats a bug, nuke codes aren't supposed to be static spawns, which means its unlootable.
---
Yeah. It would be one thing if it was less discriminate but it usually fixates on one team it seems
---
That's because you're not running around singing along at the top of your lungs in area chat 😂
---
Edit: grammar is hard
---
Followup question: Do people ACTUALLY RP in it? xD I can't imagine many doing so, but It'd be funny to run into some BoS or Enclave people who are staying in character.
---
No. ;)
---
You'll have to get the frog legs perk - pretty sure it does exactly that.
---
I've had free trials be a waste of time in the past. Given its going to take a bit to download on my internet, I wanted to get a good feel of feedback before I pretty much put all online gaming on pause for a day and a half.
---
Been some funny videos on YouTube of jump scares because he can charge at you. :)
---
If you want a real hair raising experience, take some time in Lucky Hole Mine.
---
If only we could adjust player height! Some careful editing and that showman suit in the Atomic Shop could work...
---
If you have someone else to help, you can pin the bot on one server, and take turns hopping. The inventory refreshes each time.
---
I pulled 3 long coats (on Xbox, sorry) the last time I found the bot.
---
I found one in a player vending machine a while back for 2k. Bought it right away and loved it. For about two days. Then I accidentally sold it for like 20 caps to a vendor bot. It didn’t appear in the bots inventory after the transaction... Easy come easy go
---
Wtf are you even talking about
---
Griefers like this drive me nuts. I know it’s avoidable, but it sucks when you’re just trying to protect someone else’s workshop or otherwise help out.
---
Ha!     
---
The taming system was brought up and we pushed back on some of the changes.     
---
Makes no sense why a Slothbeast can't be tamed (none), but other more hostile and mutated creatures can be for example....   
---
Though not sure you'd want one... The sonic scream would likely level your camp ;)
---
Yes please!
---
What? Im just saying its a lot of programs these days... Facebook too. I even saw a meme about it on all.
---
No one is trying to fight with you.. It's just a much bigger problem then bethesda launcher. Hence why task manager is always open. So i can cut them down to maximize my aging PC.
---
Todd Howard’s secret reddit account
---
What console are you on, or PC? I would love to swing by after work!
---
Pro tip just message them
---
Ironically some of the bugs are the same as in Skyrim, lol. But yeah. Me wishing they'd do things differently doesn't mean I hate the game or anything. 
---
And I get the NW decision, they need new players, and BR is what is hot now. I'm just hoping as the series progresses, not even just talking about 76, that they stay at least somewhat loyal to the people that love Fallout, and don't just Fallout Skin other games.
---
Shhh don’t tell them this!
---
I haven’t noticed much of a difference at all.  Both platforms are smooth. Granted I have not taken time to use any tools to measure an actual frame rate.
---
Are you on PC? XB seems to be limited to a few dozen pictures...very frustrating. I end up having to screenshot my pictures using the XB system screenshot tool so I can back up older pics and clear them out of FO76 so I can take more.
---
I good when you are high level and need to pick off low levels. Saves your good ammo. 
---
Otherwise, yeah, useless.
---
Oh no that so sad
---
But keep trying !! Hard work is always rewarding
---
Noob here, just like in real life I don’t trust people, but I have a headset on when I play (Xbox) so that communication works.
---
The kids are at 7/ll, eh? tell em to pick me up a cherry icee and a pack of natty light
---
For the last 4-8 perk packs have all been dups, thus getting 50xp which has really sucked.
---
Yea joining feels bad at the moment. There should be an option to go to vault 51.
---
I can't equip a few real nice perk cards because I don't have enough perception and agility. Really sucks.
---
I think I've had about 5 or 6 dupe cards so far and it just feels bad. I don't want to play multiple matches worth hundreds of exp just to get a dupe worth 50 exp.
---
yeah i found it about 3 months ago but didn't want it or know how rare it was so i  sold it to a wihitespring bot for like 30 caps, shoulda kept it
---
*cries in Xbox*
---
I reckon I have space for three new photos lol. I can't bear to delete any of the ones I have saved, and though I know they save on the Xbox I love seeing them when the game loads.
---
We so very much need more album space.
---
It’s fallout 76, they’d turn whatever fishing they would add into some form of overly tedious grind and gate unique stuff behind it. Far too many games do it to pad out playtime ala Warframe.
---
If they were going to add it in it would have to be done right, where it’s just a side activity with fun rewards rather than locking important stuff behind it.
---
I mean we're talking about a game and it's problems aren't we so any problems with said game would be relevant no? The video I so kindly provided neatly details the problems of the game itself and the shady bussiness practices around it that will show you how much of a malicious company we're dealing with here.
---
Not even to mention the banning of people because they did "too well" or the begging people that got in the secret room how they did it because they don't even seem to understand their own game. 
---
If you'd like to know about the rum thing or the canvas bag thing, just watch the video mate.
---
I mean, I know how VATs works. Mobs would be right in front of me and it did nothing.
---
Yep, get a Instigating or a bloodied one and of course use the pistol perks.
---
There are perks to reduce spring cost...
---
WHAT AN ENDING
---
Heavy weapons have terrible AP cost. VATS stuff is useless for them. But in reality there's nothing great in 3rd star for heavy weapons. Faster aim speed... Reduced weight to save a few pounds... You reload a gatling laser once in a blue moon... So don't think about it. B-FFR is the best combination (right after B-E legacy, but that's not available for ultracite gatling lasers, they didn't drop as legendary back then).
---
Be very happy and enjoy your gun! And if you get bored, hit me up - I'll try to give you a good trade or price :)
---
Agree
---
You have to be unarmored, holding your weapon out, and standing.
---
I've gotten this twice, and both times had my highest kill #'s
---
I did, actually, but my fix for it may not work for you depending on your platform. If you're on PC, got nothing for you I'm afraid.
---
Anyway what I found out fixed it is that for some reason the pictures only count IF YOUR PHOTO GALLERY IS FULL. As in all 50 slots are taken up, and no further pictures can be saved. For some reason, once you fill it up and take pictures with a filled gallery, they start counting towards badges. Hope that helps.
---
I tried twice and never was able to kill anyone, but I lasted 10 min. made it to level one so that's something I guess, LOL. I'll keep trying, I did have a good time.
---
There are sprint cost reduction cards
---
I've been using the missile launcher too. Alternatively, any TSE weapon would work great - they are so big that the spread doesn't matter too much. I used a gatling gun earlier before I got the gear I have now. They have tons of armor, so you want to be either dps pounding them or using the highest single hit damage you can
---
To me it sounds likea drunken irish bar fight especially when people start playing instruments. The percussion from the fists has a nice beat.
---
&gt; Seriously, fuck him. Also, fuck Juicehead, fuck Yongyea, and fuck all the other click bait assholes who have been riding the rage train since day 1 without acknowledging the improvements they've made.
---
Jim Sterling shouldn't be a surprise either, but it's funny that he actually put up a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghdOSTAda1w) the day after the Bethesda conference, essentially regurgitating all of the drama that's in the past at this point and blindly pushing forward the idea that this is just a giant scam/cash grab.   Even going so far as to dismiss the actual improvements and efforts Bethesda's been putting into this game because he thinks it's all about the $$$ and nothing else because he _really_ hates the live service model for games.  
---
Then after like 25 minutes of just shitting on the game using all of the old drama and ignoring what Bethesda's been doing (outside of adding repair kits to the atom shop), he finally touches on the Wastelanders announcement arguing that NPCs/dialogue choices/etc. should've been a basic feature at launch.  Again, completely missing the point, but his entire premise is that this game is bad, it's not what he (and by extension everyone else) wanted, and this is all just Bethesda being greedy and wanting to exploit the 'games as a service' model like the other big gaming companies.
---
Will look for you tonight sir.  Same name as on here.
---
I'll have to look into that, never actually tried. I'm sure it's possible. Also, if you're ever looking for original music, I like to program electronic music.
---
There are already places where you can find fish that have been caught hanging on racks.
---
But they are useless cause you can't collect and cook them. It would be cool if the fish gave you a intelligence boost like fish oil (or whatever the crap fish oil does)
---
Hahah thanks, I'll keep you in mind if I'm ever looking for a good home for this bad boy.
---
Same :)
---
I really need to get my internet back on, it's been so long since I've played.
---
It may take some time, but I would imagine you can delete the ones you take in the vault, but the count will persist for tracking the perk (I did not verify). I also agree that we need more album space!
---
I am game!  I also do a mean Officer Andy lol
---
Seriously, don’t disrespect Cash with that pop label.
---
Yeah.
---
Those issues have enough beards for a planet full of ZZ Tops....
---
I fly solo and like it a lot. It's a free week... May as well try it out. Just make sure to focus on exploring and leveling up. Ive never played these types of open world games, before this one and Ark, and got my ass handed to me in the Savage divide for rushing along too quick. From what I hear, towards the very last main quest, you need a group of 3, but i dont know how true that is. If it's true, Ill find a group. My 2 friends play but on a different console lol so I'm SOL on that so far.
---
I’m at level 33 now so I can probably see ahead a bit, but you’ll have to wait a bit.
---
does "h" activate any stimpack variation or just the default one?
---
It was an automated sequence!
---
Close the beth.net launcher. Make sure you check that it is not still running in the background. 
---
Once it is completely closed, restart. If it continues it could be that the game is installing each patch as well as verifying the files. Let it run for a bit and see what happens. 
---
Open a support ticket on beth.net.
---
I hopped all night for a blast zone, I'm thinking I might finally try dropping one of my own near the newbie region to give a little show.
---
Yep, ran into this all night last night.  Navigating via arrows/Z/C and using E or enter to select seems to work just fine, but clicking only works sporadically.  Sometimes I have to leave and re-enter perks to get it to work.
---
Caps and XP and Overseer XP. If you crush it and go off, you’ll get around 200 caps.
---
Haha yes indeed. Glad to see you found it.
---
Same..   Having about 15 cards to choose from, counting the starting ones is pretty lame
---
Lets start suggesting this then  in separate threads also, as it is very feasible to implement a mechanic similar to conan exiles purge system or 7 days to die blood moon one, as we already have the mechanic of small hordes in the workshop defenses, and even horde events where the leader keeps spawning enemies until dead.
---
So I can see them implementing a horde mode of their own if we make them know we would love it!
---
Slurpee**. But yes, they hang out there alot lol
---
There's a gold and silver handmade, almost makes me feel like it will be some kind of tiered reward. Wouldn't be entirely surprised if it was near the end of the nuclear winter pool
---
There is, you can see it in the Wastelanders trailer.
---
Based on what I’ve seen so far, Bethesda takes a lot of our feedback seriously. They’ve given us a ton of content so far that’s all PvE focused and with Wastelanders coming soon, I don’t see that changing. I think Bethesda will continue to give us what we want, while also experimenting with new modes and such.
---
I went to Morgantown and #1and #2 players were there.. They were lvl. 6 and 7!
---
Im not going to hunt ppl on the map but being near by caused me to go over and see what these 2 monsters were doing?? I sniped them both and they came back. I let them get thier bags and droped some more stims for them. We all waved and i headed off.
---
One of them followed me and shot me in the back! They may not be as helpless as thier lvl suggests😒
---
I bet you've built a lot of camps? Procrastination is my watch word 😆
---
Yeah I was unarmored and the animation even played. I suppose the guy must've seen me go in from a distance but didn't decide to act on me right away for whatever reason.
---
Trend of late. Keep it up Bethesda!
---
He's new to the game. You're acting like a dick for the joy of it.
---
Because of this im playing NW till the free week is up. Let them have their fun and not be met by mobs scaled to us.
---
Look up and follow the wires to find the truth behind the haunting
---
I also accidentally clicked lure creatures and suddenly I’m hiding for my life from a horde of feral ghouls
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one. Given how much slower it was to switch perk load-outs, I'm surprised there isn't more discussion about it!
---
Oh you'd have me not play at all huh, no, that's not happening
---
If Confucius where still alive, he say
---
"Give no fucks and just have fun."
---
I'm approaching level 15.  I have 1 successful match under my belt but usually land team 6 or higher.  
---
If you have a higher level teammate, spawn where they go.  Look for the follow me motion.  The mike/voice situation is atrocious but I still call out what I've left behind.
---
AND WATCH OUT FOR THE CIRCLE.  I've watched teammates die bc they're not paying attention.
---
Pip boy statue? You mean the vault boy mascot or is it a concrete pip boy?
---
I’d be more than happy to farm the vendor bot with you, but won’t be on until later this evening pacific time.  Usually can get more than a few rarer outfits to sell.
---
Me too! I’m a sound producer/composer first but have been dabbling in this video editing stuff.
---
I borrow the audio from film and TV but it’s amazing what a great soundtrack can do for the images.
---
Would be pleased to hear your work!
---
I'm going to be honest with everyone, I never actually finished a Bethesda game.  Not FO3, not Oblivion, not Skyrim, not FO4, and I have sunk 100's of hours into FO3, Skyrim, and close to 100 in FO4.  I just get lost in the world and exploring/sidequesting that I forget the main questline and just do my own thing.  It took me until my PS4 re-buy of Skyrim to even climb the big mountain and meet the dragon born people and that's like the first quarter of the game.  I had 100's of hours into my PS3 save before I even did that quest.   
---
I didn't buy this at launch because of bad press, glad they gave a free week out though because I just bought it on Amazon for $17 3 hours after playing.  I can easily see myself sinking all summer gaming hours into this.  Funny, I just bought Metro Exodus on Sunday and I'll probably never play it again now.
---
I haven't played in like a week. Could someone explain to me a bit? It's battle royal so what is the benefit of building your camp? I've seen lots of mentions of perk cards, are there new ones?
---
They're great for noobs
---
Try using medium textures and high-ultra on everything else. 
---
Also, check your draw distances. Lower the Grass draw distance if all else fails.
---
Yeah. I’ve put all rifle perks on and used a furious and used an executioner handmade while aiming. Both did pretty good
---
I don't see why a download key wouldn't work, but I have no idea.
---
Yeah, a gold, silver and a gold with silver, i want them all :D
---

Limit area chat is ok. Server wide? Hell no. I'll bet 200,000 ultracite bullets that global chat will be 24/7 flooded with "people who still play this game are insane. Thanks Todd!"
---
You've lost me here...
---
Maybe I am not being very eloquent, sorry.
---
Let me rephrase:
---
sResourceStartupArchiveList will no longer allow for custom entries.
---
This is very likely due to the fact that they don't want mods in BR.
---
However by doing this they have blocked the ability to load - among other things - custom fonts in *all game modes* not just BR.
---
The most obvious consequence is that is no longer possible to have icon sorting tags period.
---
Investigate it?
---
It's this week. I have only been disconnected during the first week of it being released and this week. 4 times last night 😭 sucks. But it hasn't been a normal thing for me usually
---
Tried. Didnt work lol. Ive ended up unloading all by the vault 76 entrance for whoever may be interested.
---
Thank you for the verification.
---
Hope so, but 3 mounts is a long time, dont thing there was any other NW stuff mined back then ?
---
Well that’s awesome the perk packs slow down... almost half the ones I’ve received (lvl11) have been doubles that just give a whole 50xp.
---
Screenshot of your character or it didn’t happen! 😉😂
---
I don't know, just formatting what's in the original post. Most likely a Vault Boy though.
---
Yeah, a pure solo 52-man free-for-all would be great. 
---
More chaos, more fun.
---
Part of the fun I say.
---
alright thanks ill be on all day, i just found the bot again but of course, the server crashed, fucking Bethesda
---
Note, you will be exposing yourself to PvP. Meaning be prepared to defend and possibly loose whatever you build. Try to build with junk that comes from the workshop. Look in the top right corner of the build screen, green = workshop, white = your personal stash.
---
It’s in general. My gigabits have always has D/C problems. Try updating some of your files that affect that port.
---
I'd love to be an extra :)
---
Two words
---
Fortnight STW global chats

I mentioned I know that but what I ment if you want to sprint longer then place them lol
---
There is nothing tedious in fallout 76 do you even play the game?
---
If on PC post username and help will be on the way
---
BWAHAHAHA nice. I feel ya, I was awful for the first day and then last night it just clicked and my team got a W!!
---
if you're on ps4 add me!  Same username as on here.
---
May he rest in peace!
---
Lol. Sure I’ll do that.
---
The best I can do is look up your issue and find a page that gives help: https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/43413/~/why-is-my-sound-cutting-out-when-playing-fallout-76-on-my-xbox-one%3F
---
Yeah, I tried going with a team a few times, being a reviver and grenadier, but they keep rushing into trouble instead of staying out of it. They must have thought they signed up for Suicide Squad.
---
Funny, I think all you pussies are cunts. :D lol. So, no, you.
---
Have since launch on and off
---
The most XP you get is from how long you survive... Killing is secondary, staying alive is the most important
---
Because they wont implement a system that will only be used on one device. At its heart this is a console game.
---
Viable for what? Finishing the game, or soloing the SBQ? 
---
In place of (or in addition to) VATS crits rifle builds can: 
---
* Use sneak attack damage
---
* Go full auto and burn ammo for damage
---
* Go bloodied or junkies for a boost
---
Nice! Never had that luck as a solo in the end, but it gives me hope!
---
Thanks! Very excited to build my first base
---
O7
---
Hey! I have one for you 😃
---
I like to use those pillars to make turret stands, but like you're saying, they just don't seem to work at all. I can snap them to a foundation, but I can only get another foundation or one of those pre-built stair stand segments to snap to them.
---
Thanks for the silver kind stranger!
---
Did it spawn mear white springs? Iv seen it at the front gate twice now. And with its frenzy ability all the bots went crazy. Lol twice iv ran away right in to the fissure sight.
---
Just viable for any thing pve related, I’m using semi auto rifles
---
Yeah, play to your strenghts. It is the only way.
---
Yeah I'm not sure there is a limit on pc
---
It's because they don't want to bother actually giving the game a chance, they made up their mind and there isn't any other game to hate on or stir up drama about since Anthem was a total dud.
---
The article was posted early, and in the other thread they said support would honor it. (Article was posted on the 9th, deal wasn’t active until the 10th)
---
So basically camp?
---
I've noticed that Murgh or however you spell it, has PA pieces in the display of her shop. I think maybe they just haven't gotten around to it yet.
---
I personally get headaches when in first person so I tend to play in third person view a lot idk if it is a motion thing but I’ve only had that issue in fo76 and fo4
---
Thanks! Here's my bloodied heavy energy build in case you're curious - running in T-51 PA with emergency protocols. It's a bit more squishy (no dodgy and no blocker).
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=e335f5b&amp;d=sq2s32sr2ip2ir2l71ls2lt2a04s22pe2id2s12s01eh2c72cu0ic2lu2&amp;w=at1lm2ag2a72i71if2im1ik0iq2ie2in1ih2ij2ii0i61p10sa2sb2pa0p80p90i30ia0i50&amp;n=Bloodied Heavy Energy&amp;m=2fc3e0159d
---
As bad as I am at regular PVP, NW seems simplified and its just super fun. I'm not great but I have a few wins. Honestly communication is the key to victory. Having a team that gives callouts and can actually hear you when you say "person in this direction behind this thing" not only makes it easier but a lot more fun.
---
If anyone wants to play, on PC and has a microphone. Whether you're good or bad just add me and we can run around in wood armor together. CallmeGimli is the tag.
---
I’ve yet to see more than a single enemy NPC at a time.  If you were seeing mobs and VATS was not working, then yeah I’d say you were bugged.  Maybe it was a rendering error that showed multiple enemies when there was only one that was previously killed?
---
Lol
---
Anything that can cripple limbs is good, even a shotty with the skeet shooter perk will work. Take out the thrusters and it'll stop completely
---
Waiting on games is indeed the best option these days. Only 6 months later you can get them more stable, lots of bugs fixed, lots of new content AND 75% off.
---
Yes noticed this last night as well.  I was able to work around it but it was definitely not working right.
---
Yes, but I’m more in it for the MMO aspects and the PVP.
---
You’ll find them.
---
I can help you farm it if you want. Im on now!
---
Ahh sorry misread...
---
Haha!
---
That would be such a great option.
---
Heh.  I distinctly remember being in a similar scenario when I was low-level, rushing into a Scorched-occupied ski lodge to get away from a pursuing Deathclaw.
---
Some of the game's best moments come from being hopelessly outgunned. X)
---
The one person in my friend group who has it is on Xbone, and I have PC and PS4. I just have no idea which one I'll wanna stick to for the community xD
---
Did a little looking at it this morning. It seems that the only clickable spot is at the bottom of the cards now where the description box is. Its like they removed the rest of the card as an object. I was able to select cards as long as I clicked that section of the card. Which creates that situation described. Not being able to select the cards behind the top one, since that section isn't available.
---
thanks, in on now
---
I didn't feel there was in issue with being able to tell when I was hitting a target but I agree completely on incoming damage. My first death I was using a combat sniper rifle and was in the scope and didn't know at all that a shotgun guy was standing next to me shooting me at point blank range. I was in T51 power armor and so it probably took him about 5 shots to kill me and I stood there the whole time thinking I was simply feeling long range shots plink off the power armor.
---
This game is fun. It's buggy sure, but the amount of moments made is alot, and I always have a blast exploring. Its like other fallout games, huge maps, weird creatures, and a good time
---
I have like 3 or 4 broadsiders (don't ask why) that existed pre-patch and they all received the buff
---
It is really close to the start, like only four caps to FT there from the Overseer's C.A.M.P., probably happens more frequently than players would like.
---
I definitely agree with your points, it's difficult to tell when you get hit and it's difficult to tell when you down someone. Its not the worst thing ever right now but I feel like this will become more of a problem as people get better and battles become more fast-paced and strategic
---
Hi! Thanks for the report, we're aware of this one and actively looking into this issue.
---
Nah I’m on Xbox, I managed to fend them off with the help of a passing responder bot. Appreciate it though mate!
---
Yes. I'm a Stealth Sniper.
---
All Rifle Perks + Bloody Mess is your base must have. Add Things like Glowsight, Ballistic Bock to increase your damage when needed.
---
Instigating is a good one as well as Furious and Executioner's.
---
Oh shit thanks
---
There used to be some roleplayers I knew of, though I'm not sure how that is now. I personally loathed voice RP, so I didn't participate.   
---
But then again back at launch, there was no push to talk or anything like that, so at launch, all you could hear was some person screaming in someone else's mic, them chewing chips, etc. Just muted it, and never bothered with it again. That's apparently changed, since then though!
---
I come in second all the time, by playing solo lol.  The real points are in survival time.  I play smart, hunt Ai monsters, keep off paths, stay in bushes and save stealth boys to the bitter end along with pulse grenades.  I hit 2nd or 3rd every time and even pulled out a win once.  Overseer lv 13 atm
---
alright thanks im on now so u can join my world
---
I've got it resolved with a follow up
---
Is it still viable with no sneak? I personally find stealth builds very boring
---

---
 &gt; Hi! Thanks for the report, we're aware of this one and actively looking into this issue.
---
A few times I will see someone run away from a fight but at the end it will say I killed/downed them. I'm sure it's just lag but it's a fairly substantial issue for a game based solely on quick kills.
---
Ahhh sorry, still out of town so haven't got time with it since the Alpha...   
---
By all reports people can start the game with mods, just not do the BR mode, so that is good to know.   
---
You can partially blame us for that...  
---
We brought up a bunch of "WhatIfs" through some very very simple edits to the models and material files that would give massive advantages...   
---
-Make Vaultsuits glow, and just don't wear one yourself.    
---
-Add a large floating arrow above the head on that model.     
---
Etc etc
---
10 bucks on Gamefly is a pack of smokes.  Easy buy.
---
I think yellow means headshot, or you hit their weak spot and white is everywhere else.
---
Tell him to look again cause everybody else figured it out.
---
Cant say I worry about the rum thing. Canvas bag thing makes me happy because no one should preorder. 
---
The only malicious thing they did that needs to be fixed across the board is crunch time nonsense. That I think will get fixed when the workers start a union so I am less concerned about it. 
---
Also the banning thing was because of mad duping problems but some crybaby convinced people it was them being mean. At least it worked your little chub into a froth so it was worth it.
---
Absolutely. Just spec into dmg perks, and don't worry about CRIT perks in luck.
---
You don't need VATS to get sneak bonus dmg. The only VATS perks I use are 1☆ concentrated fire (cripple limbs/headshots when needed), and 1 ☆ Gun fu (ghoul hordes), which is broken atm.
---
I can swap between auto and rifle perks at will, they're the same base build for me.
---
Glad you made it. Remember to stay hydrated and aim for the legs!
---
For PC users that already have it, the Tricentennial pack is on sale for ~12 too, if anyone wants the patriotic paints/outfits
---
It’s the frog legs perk, and it’s really busted. Get an M79 and Froggo legs and it’s game over for me. Sitting at 50 wins with an average of 10 kills per game.
---
Vat crit tied with jumping makes auto crit build pure aneurysm
---
If paired with bloodied or sneak I would say probably. You just might struggle against the queen a little
---
I have "caps" in my misc. tab. It literally just says "caps" and that's it. If you scroll over it a bunch of caps are floating by in the background of the pipboy screen, and apparently I can sell it for 25 caps. 
---
There are a bunch of anomalies like this in the game, like people getting hit by monsters, and then they find they have that monster's attack move in their inventory as a consumable item.
---
Don’t use the radscorpion syringer. It is horrible. I spent so much time getting the 10 stingers and the damn thing can’t kill a level 6 scorched with a headshot.
---
I was able to sell it so some sucker in my vending machine for 100 caps 😂
---
Go to the Philipi cemetery. There is a low level yau gui that you can weaken then bash to death with the syringer.
---
yep
---
You won't get the extra sneak damage bonus for sure.
---
As to how viable no sneak is,  I can't comment as sneaky is my style.
---
Yes that's what I did
---
All the weapons of mine that didn't receive the buff are legendaries. Were yours as well?
---
I switched from a VATS crit rifleman build to the full nine-perks on rifleman. It's okay, but still a kitten compared to my bloodied meta-build alt. Either can kill level 68 supermutants with ease. The rifleman is better against ghouls since he isn't afraid of rads, but rifles take so much ammo to kill a legendary sheepsquatch. \~150 railway rounds compared to 5-7 swings with a bloodied deathclaw gauntlet.
---
But the real question is ... is it possible to go to Vault 51 in adventure mode? Maybe by reaching a certain level of overseer?
---
Depends how you hit the schedule, the t-45 paint just came today, so it will still be available tomorrow. The next one will be available Friday and Saturday
---
Sure can!
---
Seriously this.  The fun in this is its simplicity.
---
Hmm, might tweak my build to drop 3 from Agility and kill Through Hiker, and sub in 3 to Intelligence for Batteries Included.  Gonna be carrying a ton of Fusion Cores so need to get the weight on those down more than I need to for food.  Fortunately I haven't allocated into Agility yet at level 44 so can switch without having to spend reallocation levels.  Thanks for the build!
---
I can see a little of where you're coming from but they still fit the aesthetic, I'm not big on Country Roads but they did give it a nice filter to 'olden' it up a bit and I don't think Beach Boys really clashes when we have cleaner sounding tunes like Right Behind You Baby and Uranium.
---
That Ring of Fire cover just sounds straight from a 2005 Now That's What I Call Music CD.
---
Fuck, it only took 3 days for the secret to get out... thanks a lot!
---
The triggers will increase/decrease the amount by 25%, and the bumpers will move it 10%. Good for quickly dialing in roughly what you want to drop.
---
Is the only exit through the Flora Research center? Or is there another way out?
---
I see the need to keep a mode where players are competing with each other as 'unpolluted' as possible.
---
I just don't think that making everyone else 'acceptable collateral damage' is actually acceptable.
---
Which is why I originally asked of the devs to actually enable this function differently so it doesn't create casualties where it doesn't need to.
---
BR is in beta, I am pretty sure there is time to look into such things.
---
New perk card released.
---
CAMP Insurance
---
Level 1 - Costs 100 caps each time you place your CAMP and does absolutely nothing.
---
Level 2 - Costs 500 caps each time you place your CAMP and repairs all your concrete slabs only\*
---
Level 3 - Costs 1000 caps each time you place your CAMP, reimburses you for all damages incurred at full repair prices\*\*
---
\*=If concrete slabs take damage, there is an assumed defect in workmanship. Defects in workmanship are not covered by this perk.
---
\*\*=Policy void where prohibited. Not valid in CO, DC, WV.
---
X-03 is confirmed by the trailer, X-02 could also be coming  via the terminal request, it's just so weird having them 100 years before the enclave actually made them.
---
Tho I wonder what that PA in wastelanders was, the big bulky one in that green lit cave, that does not look like a spawn of the enclave at all.
---
If it was the original I wouldn't be laying that disrespect lol I just think the cover is shit
---
Nuclear Winter: Tried to give armor, guns &amp; heals to teammates..match after match. “My invisibility has worn off, I KNOW YOU SEE ME!!”
---
Lol 😂
---
Yellow is crit dmg, white is standard.
---
Even if the photo folder is full you still get credit for taking the pictures. At least that's how it works for the possum challenges and stuff in adventure, so I assume it's the same in NW.
---
I just bought it for $30 a week ago and now all these sales come up. Should have known to wait for E3
---
Grafton.
---
Awesome ❤️
---
Also, unlocked skins would transfer I hope!? Not a bad idea!
---
Saw a guy today overseer level 39. Must have put on a lot of games lol
---
Yeah a friend of mine told my about gun fu either today. 
---
As i always say about beth - two steps (okay NW was 3) forward and always one back.
---
Thx for confirming that it's all platforms!
---
Oh yeah, non-optionally bundling of potentially catastrophic keybinds is just another disappointing desaster - can't tell how often I spammed heavy meelee just to throw a grenade at my feet... The should fix this (resp. make optional separate keybinds) along the way.
---
CallMeKevin would have a seizure.
---
Sounds good. Thanks for the info.
---
I've finished in the top 10 more often than not, but it's only because apparently I don't know how to play this mode and never see any other players until we're into the 3rd circle.  I think I've gotten 2nd  2 times, at least once for sure.  And 3rd once or twice.
---
Fair and we can hope. 
---
 but to be clear you are saying you can't, period, ignoring NW, get custom fonts working in that line?
---
Shit I forgot about that one, RNG hasn't blessed me with it yet
---
Q: these ranks everyone has. Is it a measure of your highest placement in a single game, or is it something where you earn points each time you play and eventually, even a persistent but bad player, can get top ranking?
---
I ask because I have disabilities that wouldn't prevent me from having a blast, but would likely not see me ever be top 5 in any given match.
---
Only thing better is the ones wearing the vault boy uncle sam outfit with the nice oversized head :D
---
They... Yeah they say a lot of things
---
Which is exactly what they are doing though. Most of the bugs are gone. They are adding new modes etc. A whole new story with npc and dialogue trees/consequences. A new battle royale mode which i didnt want but have had a blast playing and it's all free. They are dedicated to fuxing the issues
---
The toxic river beside Grafton Station.
---
Sorry, PC Master Race.
---
I have 160 regular and 100 ultracite cores on me :) that's only 75lb with batteries included perk. For me it's a must have perk... I carry 10 dog cans and 10 purified water on me. I find more than I use usually and end up selling excess when I stop playing anyway... 10 stimpacks, 5 diluted Radaway... You don't need anything else, really. Trust me. I've been hoarding initially like 200 stimpacks, water and food. It was just a giant waste of 6 perk points.
---
How do you close distance though? Or are you just really sneaky and let them close to you before showing yourself?
---
Hey, I’ve been getting this error a ton since the Nuclear Winter update. One workaround I’ve found is to join a friend’s session on the PS4 menu, and not pressing any buttons when loading up the game. After a few seconds it auto joins me to my friend’s server. Once I’m in I can go to the main menu. If I try to sign in by pressing a button the normal way, it crashes 99.9% of the time. So basically if none of my friends are already on, I can’t sign in, and can’t play any of the game modes. It’s horrible, I hope this can be fixed.
---
I did the same thing today!!
---
I'm hoping the game has had some serious improvement since I was last on. I had a great time in the beginning, but the state the game was in left 76 in a place where most of the entertainment I got was from playing with friends. When my friends stopped playing, the game lost a lot of its luster.
---
I can only build Apoca-Forts for so long before I pick something else up.
---
But hey, here's to hoping the game is infused with life, variety, and a second wind.
---
this made my month. Thanks so much man truly means a lot. I try my best to help and credit the community as much as I can with my videos as well, we all love this game and the series through the good and bad. This really motivates me to keep going with content
---
But faster!
---
Thats not what i meant and you know it.
---
If you notice certain legendary items can only come from her, they don’t have the ability to spawn organically in the world as drops.  What if PA only can spawn with one star?  So unless people are gambling one star armors (which I find highly unlikely) no one would ever know the legendary PA exists already?
---
There are some mods on the nexus that greatly alleviate this problem. I recommend SFE, Perk Loadout Manager, Better Inventory and Text Chat as a bare minimum. There used to be a few more but they were put into the game itself so are no longer needed. 
---
Unfortunately you have to disable mods before it lets you into nuclear winter, but they're fine in adventure and survival mode.
---
Will our level carry over when beta is over?
---
I run full sprint and swerve. It’s not super easy to aim on console unless you are a cod god which most people playing fallout aren’t.
---
I stopped using the build because I realized a pump shotgun can almost one hit really far away with the two perks I have.
---
This is cumbersome for console, who have limited storage space
---
furious handmade! pretty lucks. i was thinking something similar, or not melee anyway
---
Yeah I was hoping that when we got down to 5 I could let the other guys take each other out, but like I said, same team :(
---
You know what? That's okay! BR's aren't for everyone, that's why adventure mode is there! My friends and I have been playing NW, but taking breaks to go back to adventure to chill and do whatever else we want. Sad to hear you didn't enjoy the BR, but happy to see you gave it a shot and still love the base game!
---
Question...   
---
Are there any ReShades that would help with this?   
---
3rd party I know, but maybe a work around none the less.
---
There were 2 mutant hounds, could be a rendering error I guess but I killed both of them and got loot from both, so I dunno how else to explain that I know how to use VATs and it did not even pop up.
---
The swimming pool by the golf course is also a good option.
---
Is there no way to transfer them off to the cloud or another storage device?
---
One stop game.. Adventure and NW.
---
If they would kill the leader board and legendary in Survival.. I'd love to see what they get there.. it's obvious ( for now at least) NW is a hit.
---
Send me a DM and I will send a new code if that expires
---
This is with the camera. There is no camera in Vault 51 while waiting for the match
---
Awesome! Great to meet another producer! What program do you use for the bulk of your production. Currently using FL Studio. I have one track online currently. https://m.soundcloud.com/tiatameratahj/paradice-slaves-unfinished
---
...throw in a couple of Gandalfs, too.
---
The have completely blocked it.
---
I am currently in xEdit, where I have been for the last 15 hours, creating a text tag based sorting mod from scratch because of this.
---
We had a fantastic icon based sorting mod with custom rules for weapons and armor without even touching the esm, just working directly with the strings and xtranslator, that someone put no small amount of time, enthusiasm, inspiration and effort into. Stress on the \*had\*.
---
If this doesn't make your blood boil I am going to have to go ahead and check your head for implants.
---
Do you have any loss time from your trip to Dallas? Inexplicable lapses?
---
In the Toxic Valley?
---
I want nothing but those two songs. DOWN WITH THE REST.
---
Won't be in your loading screen then.
---
Gatling gun or the assault rifle
---
Anyone who believes the public shouldn't have the right to bear arms I find difficult to take seriously
---
This. I always see them in this area.
---
last game I ran out of time fixing my perks..
---
1st for scoped snipers and collecting junk. 3rd for spatial awareness in case there are other enemies lurking and for melee.
---
I don't know about this specific deal, but according to the XBL store it's $29.99 through July 8.
---
I likely was one of them lol.  I ran into 5 other guys doing the farm quest last night.  All were solo.  We took that damn level 15 legendary down tho.
---
It only sadly changes the texture ;/
---
Yes. I was able to get my "Kill 20 Players" achievement in NW. I assume it would work for the reviving players as well.
---
Yes! I love fishing in ESO, fishing in 76 would be great fun. Great for taking photos as well
---
Same ! I played a few hours in a team then i realized i could choose to go solo. I had SO much fun.
---
Imagine this : i was sneaking for like 15 minutes without meeting anyone. Just running from the fire. Suddenly, while crouching on a hill, i hear the emote sound but i don't actually see the emote. I turn around and there it was , 3 guys hiding in a bush, i was 10 meters away and we didn't see each other. I started firing and got 2 of them but the 3rd one got me and saved his buddies. It was hilarious.
---
And what about those fossils all over the map for the Possum Archeologist badge.  They're unique environmental features that don't do anything else so far.  Let us excavate fossils and display the remnants of the Pre-War world in our CAMPs.
---
And let us catch small bugs and keep them in terrariums and grow different types of flowers.
---
Honestly, they should just turn CAMPs into Animal Crossing for all the homebody players.
---
Considering thats the only time we have to access perks or the menu, I don't want it to be too short.
---
This is literally me as well.  I've been a Vats &amp; Sniper player since Fallout 3.  I can't hit a moving target with a pistol.  My advice, find a hunting or combat rifle and a gatling gun, a bunch of stimpaks, and stay hidden.  I've gotten a lot of points for 2nd place.  Use the "Risk" strategy, let everyone else kill each other and only deal with easy kills or the few that remain.  Also helps to team up with people who are good at PvP and watch their backs (have a headset).  Be support, stay hidden, stay ahead of the fire.
---
Since they changed the Workshop rules, I think it's at the point now where I don't really have any complaints about how it currently is.
---
I thought there are no rules in war and love... Funny thing - topic cover both somewhat.
---
Lower the lobby timer.  Way too much time.  The kick on sniper rifles is ridiculous.  I understand weapons kick when you fire them but its so exaggerated its funny.  Tone that shit down lol.
---
The Whitesprings golf club in the forest- sorry, should have been more specific, I forgot there was more than one golf course.
---
But how is pinging going to jeopardize your precious mic?
---
Currently loading a custom ESL, ESP or an edited ESM will get you flagged, and previously when loading up it would not allow you to see anything in world but monsters.   
---
Don't mean to be a kill joy..
---
That happened yesterday to me came up on a lvl 2 and dropped a bag of ammo and stimpaks, used the remote and he still stood there like he was thinking I was gonna shoot him lmao
---
Nuclear winter is so easy just won 2 games in a row with randoms
---
Because this isn’t guitar hero.
---
I wish it were longer to give us time to explore. There are a lot of level locked terminals, holotapes, and doors that I’d like to explore without a time limit. Same for choosing perk cards, I wish I had more time to really work on my build.
---
Yeah. If you're pretty social it can be easy to team up on ps4. I've always played solo games so it's kind of weird for me when I tried to play with my cousin. I hear people in communities who don't do everything together... That'd probably be my kind of team if I joined one lol.
---
you're stupid
---
if you get PVPd in current adventure mode.. you likely deserve it or are not educated in how the game works..
---
nobody should get PVPd unless they are a fool or seeking it...
---
I guess I just meant xfer them off for a bit... them put them back on? IDK. The last console I owned was a super nintendo.
---
So I'm guessing you dont get rewards for winning games?
---
Also possible by the lighthouse when the Enlightment Event is up.
---
I think PvP will remain in adventure mode in the limited form it is currently in. I don't see a better way to contest workshop ownership, and it's pretty hard to be griefed or forced into combat currently. I think it's fine as is.
---
...isn't it to make the enemy retreat to not get hit by their gaelic dongs?
---
Just a guess but I wonder if many of these questions will get answered tomorrow on the Inside the Vault article. I was kinda disappointed they didn't talk about any of the upcoming Nuclear Winter dlc besides BR.  Hopefully we hear something.
---
That's the first thing that happened to me when I got out of the Vault, thanks I suppose
---
Maybe try and revisit this with the new show damage numbers option? 😎
---
So, what happened with this? I thought 06/09 was when announcements were gonna be made...
---
The only role PvP plays in adventure mode is to enable trolling and generally selfish player behaviors.  Workshops should be contested through alternative non-PvP means instead - seldom in adventure mode is workshop PvP initiated for workshop ownership, its just a piss poor excuse/exploit used purely to PvP the owner.
---
Thank you so much! That's awesome!
---
gg
---
Can crits happen outside of vats? I don’t recall activating a critical. I think I was just ads.
---
Hi, thank you for your report! I'm going to bring this up with the team for investigation.
---
&gt;  scariest glitch since posting this might end up with my getting banned.
---
Please don't be afraid of getting banned for posting bug reports! We won't take any action against your account for encountering an issue like this. Thanks for bring it to our attention.
---
I have an SSD and its my only drive. What else could be the problem.
---
I got the "crushing blow" grenade launcher that I really like.  I will have to check it out.  Hopefully it's something they can fix.
---
Four or five usually spawn for me at The Freakshow — it borders the savage divide and the cranberry bog. Lots of good loot to be had there! Although I have heard that mirelurk queens spawn there as well.

---
I found them here, thank you.
---
Thanks!!
---
Confirmed, thanks!
---
Grafton is the most reliable. Ft there, and they're outside either edge of town.
---
Some hardware, Ableton, Reason and various plug-ins 👍
---
Will check it out!
---
Totally forgot about those, thanks for the reminder!
---
Any suggestions for a replacement system?
---
That's the only big issue right now for me too. Lobby time should be less than 1/4th average survival time in any BR.
---
Someone said download the demo.
---
I finally figured out how to vats critical hits consistently in adventure. Prior to that I manually aimed and still did just fine.  It is definitely possible.
---
Nah, I am using xEdit because I am more comfortable with the environment. I feel very clunky in xtranslator.
---
I am just working the strings which then I will make into a custom dictionary that I can use with the inevitable updates in xtranslator. Not gonna do this with each and every update. I appreaciate my sanity.
---
No esms were harmed in the making of this. I am working on a copy of the esm. The original remains unsullied.
---
What was added with last update? I am not that impressed with nuclear winter it more of a fortnight knock off i hope that was not it
---
I'm only gonna be able to pick up the xo1 by the looks of it if that comes out tomorrow, not been able to get online for the week so far
---
It's every two days, so you've not missed one yet! ;)
---
It was between Uncanny Caverns and Bastion Park..
---
It works without? OMG I thought it was awkward getting thrown out of stealth mode every time I try to adjust the camera. Gonna try that out next chance I get.
---
Yep no problem 👍
---
It's great for scrapping.
---
signed..
---
this is definitely a thing for me too..
---
Is there anyway to show me your free aim build?
---
Still cant get it work.. thanks though I'm done with this but I was looking for a buddy
---
I've made it to number two twice using tactics like you're talking about. My team experiences have been mediocre in comparison, I feel like you get limited to what gear you can get when you are in a team, team clears out the crates before you get there mostly. It's more fun to play the "naked and afraid" version of NW;)
---
True - pompy was the nice and quick way to maybe earn a badge without much input
---
Headshots are always yellow, and I've gotten yellow dmg numbers on limbs with repeated hits. I'm just assuming, as they're never clear on dmg numbers.
---
It needs balance the perk cards should only help so much. I've been playing alot and it's seems everything is balanced very well so far. Idk what's gonna happen when we start getting lots of high level player. Man I hope there are no game breaking perk cards in there.
---
No clue, but it was a new one they added in Wild Appalachia, so it’s something new and interesting
---
Graham vistied me last night when I just started cleaning out Grafton Steel.  Almost shot him in the face as I didn't expect him to show up and every enemy there is a super mutant.
---
nah /r/Fallout hates the everloving fuck out of FO76, they call anyone that visits this sub sheep
---
servers dont need more entities laying around...
---
I kind of feel like I’ve dropped on. However, I’m not exactly missing NPC’s like I thought I would!
---
Unlike previous fallout games the enemies and loot regenerate constantly (every time you change servers) and some servers are "lucky" servers that have better loot and enemies. It pays to find your favorite places and visit them often. Food and water are all over the place once you know where to look. Also a tip... if you have to eat something raw and get a disease there's a round stone pillar structure with a drinking fountain around it's edges to the right side behind the tennis court when you fast travel to the Whitesprings Golf Club. That water fountain cures diseases when you drink from it (collecting the water doesn't work). I'd recommend staying out the the gardens and club area if you're low on ammo though.
---
I think SBQ is affected by zelot's and ISSq is affected by troubleshooter's. And those are both the endgame bosses.
---
smaller map, way fewer entities..
---
There’s an apparent trend I’m noticing...
---
I agree with you OP and these others,  maybe give us access to our NW cards outside of this lobby and cut the time waiting in half? 
---
   I get it, teamed up with strangers and trying to strategically plan out your routes and get a quick rundown on each other's play style....if you're lucky to be put on a team with people that have mics. But the current waiting time is too long.
---
I'm not saying I don't want it. But I kind of like only occasionally running into people. 
---
That said when settlements become a thing... man it would be cool to have bustling hub areas filled with players trading gear, forming raid parties, etc.
---
Buy it on Amazon, play for the week. Set the shipping to no rush shipping. If you like it you keep the price. If you don't then you have plenty of time to cancel. You can always return it even after it's shipped.
---
If i pick it up i sell it
---
 spoiler tags dude.
---
My character is female. I always go to that bedroom and take off my jumpsuit and lay in the bed. No one tries to punch me, but I do get a lot of strange emotes.
---
This is true. I never got into it, but I remember that Fortnite was once developing a rich single player campaign that people really were into.... and then they realized they could make more money with BR, so they just dropped the single player / co-op campaign stuff completely.
---
The only thing that seems to really have an impact on the FPS is object distance.  
---
If I keep that on the lowest; I get about the same on Ultra as Low.  
---
Which... is barely 50-60 FPS at best. And *very* uneven, sometimes going down to 30.
---
I have a feeling they will shorten it. I think it's long atm so people have the chance to figure out how to equip perks.
---
Milk it while you can mate
---
Did you count all 52 players?
---
I'm assuming that even though the game 'finds' 52 people, not all of them may actually get into the lobby right away.  It may take a little time to get all 52 people to load in, and to find replacements for any that back out or disconnect in the process.
---
Plus, there's a lot to see int he lobby, including some lore items/entries and (believe it not) I actually once found an item to pick up - not sure if it's a one-off, or if there could be more in there that I haven't found.
---
The only trigger conditions I've found are specified in the record for each individual encounter, so it's just too tedious to go through them all, but it's very interesting that the bot spawns more frequently at that location... I'm tempted to start regularly checking all of the travel locations in the forest and making some kind of chart to share.
---
Any chance you'd make one with the nuke briefcase spawn locations? Or, does anyone know if they can be found in containers; world loot only?
---
Gotcha!   
---
Sorry just wanted to give you the warning, a few of us did all sorts of crazy things at launch ;)
---
Oh yeah lol and spent days looking for crafting supplies 🤣
---
Likely never. The only way 52 players is working is because 90% of the load in the server has been removed in nuclear winter. If there were an additional 28 players, that's 28 more stashes, camps, and items. If you thought world hopping to place your camp was bad with 24 players....oof imagine 52.
---
The servers are often on fire as is. Not saying a player count bump isn't possible, I just don't see 52.
---
Now I heard something about them adding like 70 perk cards, are those only in Nuke Winter?
---
There is no demo to be found on the store
---
Punch allowed in the boxing ring but nowhere else. That'd be cool!
---
Though I can already see the glitches now...
---
"I left NW during the lobby and now I can't punch or shoot in Adventure mode halp"
---
If you make a copy to your drive then you can view the answers
---
Like a few people have said, I’d certainly give it a try. I only thought I would give it a try once or twice and I’ve been playing it a lot more than that. It’s fun even tho I suck at shooting. Vats has destroyed my aim. It’s quick fun rounds and if you don’t like it it’s fine. Also I want those new pa paints.
---
Yea that’s what I was thinking
---
There's also not 52 stash boxes filled to the brim with loot, an entire map unlocked to explore, countless enemies...  
---
A lot less stress on the servers.
---
YASSSSSSSS PERFECT
---
You should always have the option. And honestly with Raiders vs Settler coming... I'm sad how limited PvP is in Adventure.
---
simulation is ambiguous! is it chems? is it electronic? is it mothman illusions? is it *aliens*? who knows!
---
and OP found out what the secret was and outlined it below - all is good
---
I bought it just as the insane salt began to calm down a little, I saw it and decided to root for the underdog.
---
Ofcourse you don't worry about the rum or the bag thing, it's not as if it perfectly demonstrates the maliciousness of Bethesda.
---
Watch the video mate. Stop being so ignorant and desperate to defend this morally bankrupt company that lies and manipulates the very people that buy their products.
---
Might wanna invest into a good SSD drive... and also perhaps overclock the 1700 a bit too cuz the single-thread performance is a bit lackluster.
---
Those are just regular froggies.
---
Seems from the answers I got they are only in Nuclear Winter.
---
Survival mode.
---
Open PVP by default.
---
Adventure won't happen like that.
---
Not really any official endgame content, but there's been a slew of new quests, events, and challenges added. There's definitely some time consuming material here.
---
So it goes Monday/Tuesday one paint then Wednesday/Thursday one paint then Friday/Saturday one paint then Sunday/Monday the last paint?
---
They are able to have 52 on a server because of several reasons that are not possible with adventure mode. In adventure mode there are items that need to be loaded in like camp objects and stash box items. As well as player’s inventory items. These are not present in the new BR mode called nuclear winter. Also it is a much smaller map. That is why more people can be on a server at once.
---
I always carry an explosive one. Fires fast and ammo is easy to find. Good for tooling around.
---
I was there.
---
Are you sure they didn't do anything to you in Dallas? You... worry me man.
---
How many has there been so far? I only have one
---
Why did the turret health replenish tho? There wasn’t anyone near the camp but me
---
I was thinking they should add vertibots that drop supply’s if you shoot a flare up.
---
In an era when it's popular or common-place to "follow-leader", I tend to think for myself. As the saying goes, "one man's trash is another man's treasure", so take from that what you will. I pre-ordered the game, played every BETA session that was available and have played everyday since release (no lie) - I have no regrets with the time and money spent. Sure, there were more bugs that I would have liked initially, but my knowing it was just a game and that Bethesda would get around to addressing them as they could, I continued on. Plus, Todd said they were releasing a game that would have issues from the start, so I went into Appalachia with that in mind. I have had countless hours of fun and still find it enjoyable to this day with all the new DLC's Bethesda has added. I've learned quickly not to listen to "some" click-bait YouTubers - but that's my decision. Remember, there are three sides to every story - theirs, yours and the truth - the truth is out there...oh wait, that sounds familiar. LOL :)
---
*crowd boos at you*
---
This happened to me to!!  I posted a comment on the release notes.
---
I thought it was due to weird sequence of me being rezzed, then rezzing my teammate right away.
---
No idea as I don't play Survival.
---
I believe this already exists as a passive feature. If your teammate spots an enemy it should put a diamond above the enemy's head before you even see them. 
---
I could be wrong, but I could swear this is already happening. That all said, an Apex style 'hey look at this bruddah' feature would be a huge plus.
---
Survival mode you're always hostile basically. I think if you holster your weapon you don't appear hostile anymore. 
---
I'm also pretty sure you can't destroy camps anymore, so shooting it won't do anything.
---
I literally couldn’t kill it cuz I pulled out a hunting rifle and shot it twice and it jus went empty and back full again
---
Wait what?!
---
I didn't know this.
---
Now I look at my main's inventory and she's carrying 289 of the fucking things.
---
Pros: Got a lot of carry weight back!
---
Cons: The fuck this is a thing?????
---
I'm in almost the same boat.  I did play the beta for like an hour and wasn't feeling it but that was a long time ago.  However I kinda wanna try it again.  But the DL is big and I don't wanna waste my time (or my data usage) for nothing.
---
My bad, misread the title. Thought we were talking about collecting toads for their respective furnishing.
---
Can confirm Legendary UCG can be obtained legitimately, I got a B/25 from the Purveyor myself and started a new character just to be able to properly use it.  The green lasers are so damn sexy I named mine ***Death Star***.
---
Filled to the brim?
---
I'll have you know my Stash is only 798 thank you very much.
---
If it works then maybe its not a bad strategy, I just stuck to the outside boundaries the entire time.
---
In NW, level doesn't matter.    
---
Everyone starts off with nothing and wearing a vault suit. Everyone gets a starter pack of 7 SPECIAL cards. You get more by leveling up in Overseer levels. You get other rewards but all are cosmetic and don't give an advantage.    
---
You can create a new character, leave the vault and jump right into NW. Once it starts, you have to find gear while a counter goes down like in a BR.
---
I didn’t keep track of the dmg numbers but mine actually feel like they’re not hitting as hard as they were just a few weeks ago.
---
Walmart just moved in?
---
Awesome story, it legit gets scary to get trapped on that bridge! I was in a similar situation last night. The ring was closing in and it was just me and 3 other players remaining. I must have been the only one on the bridge but I was running out of time. I put my camp down and began building rugs extending out from the bridge. The ring advancement ended and the bridge was totally engulfed, but the carpets were fine and floating freely above all the action. I couldn’t even see the players below me. One died as I was riding out this final wave, but as the ring advanced again, I felt like a 9/11 jumper. What choice did I have!? It was a tough decision but I decided to jump and let the two remaining players duke it out. That fear though, that’ll stay with me for a while as one of the most terrifying things I’ve encountered in 76 so far
---
That's an old problem. They were label "misc" in Fallout 4 as well. Not sure why. 
---
Though the issue showing up in 76 would seem to indicate that someone on the team got lazy when migrating assets and values over to 76.
---
Lol I don't know everyone's Reddit handle, are you in the "other" place as well or are you talking about the discord with the other MOD authors? ;)
---
This!  I want to stay on teams, as I like reviving and I suck for when it comes time to shoot people, but I want to hang on the edge of the fire dome and hide in bushes and wait until closer to the end.  But most teams just want to run off into the woods right away like they're heading to grandma's house.  I may have to try doing this solo sometime.
---
Ok that’s the explanation I was looking for. I had a feeling it had to do with camps but the motherfucker killed me for no damn reason I didn’t even have a gun the first time it killed me lol why would they remove destroying camps tho it should at least be allowed in survival
---
They made camps in adventure invulnerable to avoid griefers, but instead of keeping it separate from survival, it's the same there to.
---
Make Nukashine... lots of Nukashine...for the new people.
---
Explains it
---
Yes, usually in Valhalla. And yes, you do know my reddit handle.
---
Or at least you did before your trip... now you have me really worried.
---
Let's see if you are really you.
---
You still have my effing backpack plan!
---
 SBs and SBQ is on the latest list. I imagine the Imposter would not be, being an Assultron.
---
Can’t you just make a new character to get free shit?
---
Need some Fs here folks. I'll start.
---
- F
---
This is an excellent practice.
---
Pretty sure its 0-360 degrees though, full circle and all.
---
What the heck is the Vendor Bot?  Is this like another Grahm (who I'm still yet to find)?
---
Lol isn't that usually the way it works tho?
---
Just own up to it. Be that freak who listens to punching porn. Then when your roommates finally have the guts to walk in, you look at them and say “You’re either in or out, what will it be?”
---
Pretty sure the map was only part of the special edition
---
Add me homie! DwaynesWorld is my IGN I play in the evenings and just got back to the game over the weekend.
---
from what I recall hearing from the devs/Todd/someone before/during the BETA, was that something like 300/400 kbytes/s should be enough
---
I doubt many people have that low a connection.
---
On the other hand their servers are usually laggy... though since the NW update they've been "impressively" smooth for me
---
I think it was an oversight. They did it to prevent griefers in Adventure mode. Not sure why survival was not excluded
---
You can play the entire main game by yourself. IMO, it is best 99% of the time so you won't miss out on lore and info. The later part is harder so a group is best towards that part. I have grouped maybe 5 times.    
---
Gear, personal skill, and Perk Card load-outs are your factors in how 'good' you are. I would not rush it. Take your time and enjoy the game. The map is HUGE.    
---
I have not played Survival mode and only 3 matches in the Nuclear Winter. I'm no fan of pvp either.
---
Murder other players. That is my end game content.
---
I don’t think Survival mode is long for this world. It’s already unpopular, Nuclear Winter delivers fast paced PvP and does it much better, and with Wastelanders adding factions in the fall, I wonder if we won’t see some sort of new PvP mechanic in Adventure Mode. If that happens, Survival really won’t serve much of a purpose.
---
Wow, thanks kinda nerfs the whole “survival pvp” thing for me So I’ll just quietly show myself the exit
---
Can I ask, that one of you leaning against the noticeboard in a train station. Where is that and what is that note pinned to the board?
---
Lol sorry bud, will return it when I'm back...  
---
Exhausted and loopy from the insanity, pulling up to LAX now
---
Sounds good friend!
---
Then alt pack that shit, put bundles of music in the atom shop and add the ability of playing it on your jukebox so others can hear when they visit your camp.
---
I did this, died in the process but I got it done
---
S'all good lol
---
Oh, that's in a raider station I believe, and I think it's an unsolved mystery letter
---
Thanks for the advice, I thought this was the way to go 😂
---
Yeah it's one of the biggest complaints right now. So hopefully Bethesda does something about it soon.
---
I fixed it.. it makes so sense 250 was as high I remembered... thank you
---
No rush, just making sure that this is you and not a doppleganger or a body snatcher.
---
EDIT: For the record, every minute spent doing this absolutely archaic sorting mod my hatred for BR intensifies.
---
If I was an Amazon AWS employee I would be currently urinating on the servers hosting the BR mode.
---
I just wound up bashing it to death
---
That and when I'm sneaking with my invis armor and am using a weapon where the sights go invisible. Then I'll switch to 3rd person to use the reticle.
---
F2P is cheaters paradise... Why would anyone on his right mind suggest such a thing? You think we don't have enough players for games?
---
1k-10k
---
Lol good lord. I dont care about the non game aspects because they have nothing to do with the game I play. 
---
Morally bankrupt? Really? You need to calm down. Dicks? Sure. Greedy? Why not. Morally bankrupt? Not so much, they arent forcing children out of their homes or poisoning a well for profit. They put out a game with flaws and knew it would work out for them. 
---
Go after them for bullshit forced overtime or something. That actually hurts people and is indifferent to humanity. 
---
Buggy game and bad bag are not.
---
Yeah, I agree with this.  
---
They may never say so, but it's pretty clear to me they have almost no plans of splitting off the controls in a significant way from the consoles.  Every console control has exactly 1 pc equivalent, and if that equivalent is "T" in one spot, it's probably going to be like that everywhere.  
---
For them, I get how this makes it simple to build out an interface because both versions are based off a basically identical framework but it's obvious how terrible it feels to control it with mouse and keyboard.  It's been like this since Fallout 4 and I just don't see it changing.  It's disappointing though, I agree.
---
What platform are you on?
---
I hope so cuz I do want to return for the wastelanders update
---
Think we played different games. Thought the game was awful sadly. Glad you could enjoy it tho
---
Also part of the survival guide
---
Just do it.
---
&gt;I knew what I was getting into.
---
This. This right here. As much as I love Bethesda games (Fallout 3 &amp; 4, Elder Scrolls 3, 4 &amp; 5), they have ALWAYS been buggy messes. Granted, there is less tolerance for that these days and Bethesda deserved some of the criticism for the state of this game at release, but they have improved it quite a bit since then (and in an interview a while back Todd admitted they should have put it in front of more people earlier before release to iron out those issues, so hopefully they have learned from the experience). Still, **I always knew what I was getting into**. A buggy engine with known problems that hadn't even been fixed between Fallout 3 &amp; 4 (I'm looking at you PA compass 30 degrees off) that was *also* going to have multiplayer tacked on? Honestly, I was surprised it was as stable as it was. 
---
But the one thing they have always gotten right was worldbuilding through environmental storytelling and I've thought that stuff was spot on from day 1. And honestly even though it is all through holotapes, I thought the dialog, script and voice-acting is the best they've done yet. The way I explained it to my friends was "It's Fallout. If you like Fallout 4, you will like Fallout 76. It's rougher around the edges, and there are other people (whether you want them or not). But it's still Fallout."
---
Sell them. That's 289 caps you're sitting on.
---
I enjoyed the trial for a couple hours and bought it. PS4 player as well. If you’re having fun, I say do it.
---
That would be amazing!!
---
I have both.  Found the HLC from the responder bot, but bought the FCJ from a vendor for 3750.  I think that price was reasonable given the rarity.
---
I've seen the longcoat go for 4k, I don't know about the camo.
---
Does it take rescources from your main game or is it also a seperate thing?
---
Thanks! Yeah cosmetics should be freely swapped around since they don't affect gameplay.
---
Watch the video. Coward.
---
Oh right cool, i wanna get the durvival guild when i get some money to burn, unfortunately because of where i live i have to get it through a different site as bethesda doesnt deliver to my adress
---
Sound strategy.
---
Yeah.  Two Mirelurk Queens is quite common there.  I may have even found three once, with one being Legendary. Not for the faint of heart! XD
---
Yeah I'm right there with you. I got lucky and ended up on a team with someone who knew what they were doing so I just learned from him as I went. Our two teammates bit it early so it was just us two with me mostly being bait lol. Somehow we won. Thanks random dude!
---
I don't think it's bots, I think it's you suggesting people use the what is undeniably the biggest piece of garbage on Reddit, the search bar.
---
You'll get much better results if you go to google and search "site:reddit.com fallout 76 &lt;Your search term here&gt;"
---
here's a preview of a search setup with the term "search bar" and the time frame of the past 24 hours
---
https://www.google.com/search?q=site:reddit.com+fallout+76+search+bar&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=qdr:d&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0ntKMzuTiAhXCMd8KHXl7AqcQpwUIKA&amp;biw=1858&amp;bih=1009
---
Just jump in... the water's fine.
---
So, by your logic, those same mechanics should be good enough for Survival and NW.
---
how rude
---
Hm didnt think I'd win, sort of figure it would just peter out. Thanks chode, glad you realized how hysterical you were being.
---
Seriously? I ordered it a few days ago. That's a damn joke. I expected an actual disk with a code.... well at least it was only $17! I suppose I can't complain much. Though it saying physical, I wish they'd actually make it so. Is the box an actual box at least?
---
I remember when people said that about ARK...
---
XB1
---
I had a blast at launch and am just jumping back in with the new modes and the upcoming fall update. There is plenty of content and fun to be had and I'm sure you find a physical copy for dirt cheap at this point. Probably no more than the cost of going to see a 2 hour movie. The world is huge and I found myself just wondering and exploring because there is always something just off in the distance that you're like alright fine, I'll walk over there too. I mostly played solo. Right now there should be an influx of new/returning players which would be a benefit as well.
---
Yeah I though so I'll need more caps
---
Thank you for this.  I've been so confused on the leveling system and your small paragraph explained everything very nicely.
---
Amazon, $17 right now, can't go wrong, do it, do it, do it, yeah, you should do it, go for it, send it!
---
Never! Never is the time. It is not PVE mode, it never has been.
---
Vault 51 should be where you go when exiting a game. It should be the hub - all the way back to the main menu is daft. But it’s so obvious I’m sure they’ll implement it on the full release.
---
The only thing I would do (and it's completely dependant upon if you want more AP regen or if what you have is good) but instead of ironclad in endurance, use rejuvenated and slow metabolizer. But ironclad is good too if you're happy with your AP regen. Other than that, looks good to me.
---
Can't wait for NPCs
---
In nuclear winter?
---
Some people don't want our gifts at all and prefer to try and survive on their own. If you wanna leave gifts for whomever comes next you can put them in the containers at the overseer camp. They won't despawn there until the servers restart. Paper bags might despawn if you leave the server and there's no other players around in the area you dropped them.
---
Missing Gun Fu :(
---
Also, this may help with Chipotle, because you've been saying it incorrectly

---
One quick question though, do you do any sneaking at all? Stealth is incredibly powerful in FO76
---
Really which vendor bot did you get the FCJ from I know about the hunters long coat bot but I'm too lazy to spend half an hour if not more jumping servers
---
If you enjoy playing the trial and enjoyed FO4, just go for it.
---
I got my copy for 10€ on Amazon last week, PS4 as well.
---
So even if at some point I decide the endgame grind is not for me, I surely got my moneys worth, considering the time it kept me entertained.
---
What time zone you in and what time were you thinking?
---
Honestly it’s a better time than ever. You still have plenty of time to complete the main quest as it stands—before Wastelanders comes and changes the world. There’s also a lot more to do now than there was in the beginning. I’m kind of jealous of players who get to start fresh now.
---
So far the first/earliest unlock lore tidbit I've found is a holotape behind the musical stage area that requires level 6 to pick up and play.
---
You will like it
---
Yeah I'm gonna need more caps
---
I started building a simple foundation with a ladder coming off of it, then i realized the game said neither of them can be deleted as they are dependant on each other!!!! so now im stuck with them like an eyesore in my camp as i cant delete or move or store them
---
there are only 2 pieces! youd think id just delete the ladder as it was the only thing on the foundation, but nope
---
NPCs living at camp? I hope we're able to customize them in some way
---
Read the patch notes..,
---
Love this idea!
---
I’m alright with the trade off honestly. Would his build be viable in endgame?? I’m kinda new to this stuff and I want to make sure I’m able to fight the queen and other endgame stuff.
---
Definitely. Felt that way about CleanPrince yesterday. Most of these youtubers that are complaining about it and Bethesda don't play the game anyways. Its one thing to give honest criticism where its deserved but most of the hate is completely hyperbolic.
---
Spending time on BR..  ignoring dailies.
---
So because you can't destroy a camp there's no other reason to play?
---
Looks nice
---
I was trying to do a silo run solo on my hodge podge 84 level guy.  I was moving a bit slow because I was trying to not waste my heavy gun ammo and I think since my last attempt they actually buffed things in the silo a bit.   Anyhow I was probably 45 minutes into it and died three times but right when I get to the control room a level...like 600 shows up and says "Hey man, saw you in here for a while thought I drop in and check on ya!"   I do not know how to use my mic becuase I do not talk.  At that moment the protect the 5 tech bots completes and he says...
---
Ya!  Go for it!  Get your nuke!  So while I was putting in launch key card, codes, and coords I can hear him fighting what sounded like random bots maybe that wandered in and guarding my back.  I was very greatful he came even though I was literally at the very end.
---
Thank you if you are reading this.  I was the guy in mismatched power armor weilding a stick(Club) LOL
---
So ya I have to agree this community is great.
---
Its okay now. I fixed it by setting the window to full-screen. It was already set to full screen in game settings but in the ini file fallout76.ini it was still set to borderless. When I changed it to fullscreen it fixed it. So weird.
---
No but an unkillable enemy who kills me for no reason is game breaking to the immersion. That on top of a thousand other things gives me no reason to play.
---
These are the kind of things that trip me out, as your rig is obviously capable. Mines a few years older but *shouldn't* have issue either (6700k, 32GB, 1070x2, SSD) but yeah hitches and FPS drops pretty consistently (better than November at least). 
---
I'm kind of hoping with the influx of new players stability becomes priority. Not sure how thats related at all but, one can dream.
---
Pick up that Nukashine and drink it, dammit!
---
I lot of really vocal people who vehemently dislike the game dislike it because other people dislike it. It's the exact same pattern with every single Beth game since the early 2000s. After all the hate Skyrim got it's now considered almost universally as one of the greatest games ever made. People generally seem to like Fallout 4 now, too, which got massive hate. 
---
Look at a game like No Man Sky, which was WAYYY less complete than FO76 at its launch. It was seriously dumped on hard, but now it's this beloved game since the devs have been adding a lot to it in response to criticism. Beth has been fixing a lot of the issues with FO76 and are certainly listening to criticisms. But no it's just this eternaly damned game no matter what. 
---
The gamer outrage culture makes me steer clear of the popular consensus.
---
Doesn't Nuclear winter end on the 17th though because this was a sneak peek?
---
I agree Survival serves no purpose anymore now that there is another PvP element that is doing rather well. 
---
I think with these changes I was hoping to see Fallout 76 have separate modes for differing player interests. Each mode having it's own progression system that comes with its own rewards is, in my opinion a good way for players to at least try out everything the game has to offer and also have each mode have their own specific community behaviors that fit different playstyles
---
Why would ya want that?
---
Literally, THIS
---
I bought it for 60$ new, and easily still feel like I got my moneys worth out of it. There was a really rough period around March where the game was nearly unplayable for me because of freezing, hitching screens, and weight glitches, but that seems to not be a problem anymore and the game is so much better now. Definitely worth 17$ without a doubt. 
---
For 17$ - 1000/10 I would easily buy again.
---
Very much appreciated!
---
Hmm...  small area chat? :) , trading, rol, pvp, questions...
---
No CAMP in NW, there is building but its a stripped down temporary system.
---
It's kind of weird. CAMPS are mainly player homes, not public settlements for most people - unless you would be able to marry your companion similar to Skyrim.
---
I'm always blaming my computer and connection but I know it's mostly their servers because I play all other multiplayer games just fine on wifi
---
Is there a Rock-It Launcher in fo76? If so then it's ammo.
---
It said fall this year. So probably September ish
---
Keep in mind that a player put that camp there, not the game, it really shouldn't have been placed near the vault, but some people suck.
---
Usually how I tell, is someone on my team with a mouth full of Cheetos starts screaming "ur gettin shot dude".
---
YouTube is a dumpster fire.  Same rule as news websites; Just don't read the comments.  There is nothing of any substance there.
---
Fallout New Vegas style crafting is coming with Wastelanders update... going to call it now!! :D
---
/me crosses his fingers!
---
lookup the officially published update info
---
There is a heartbeat sound, but it kicks in when you are practically dead.
---
Red edges would be nice, like the ones in most FPS.
---
Do you use pharma farma?
---
Ok understand the problems now.
---
Yeah, i really hope they'll shorten the time. I'd definitely play more games
---
Can't follow you around?! I get it, but mer....😖
---
What is the strongest build you have?  I have two guys.  One is a 44 stealth sniper who I am giving up on as he is always out of ammo, cant carry a damn thing, and because of that he is always radiated.  My better of the two is 84 and he is a PA heavy gun guy with melee secondary build.  He does better but I feel like I spend hours getting mats for ammo just so I CAN use the big guns regularly...most days I am beating things to death with my bloodied club of death =(
---
No. Your camp will be in the same spot in adventure
---
That’s not the point the point is if something’s going to kill me I should be able to kill it back especially when it killed me for no reason. That’s all. Idc about its placement as anything within reason should be allowed, including killing back AND if I so chose yes destroying ppls camps. It’s fallout not Disney land.
---
I would like this but it would hard to program for Bethesda
---
report it directly to Bethesda, he should get banned then
---
That's a great idea. They absolutely should do that !
---
Thank you! 
---
I want to see Survival Mode succeed, but with Nuclear Winter being recieved so positively it is making Survival feel more and more irrelevant and pointless. With all the great things coming to 76 there is a lot of potential in Survival that just isn't being used there.
---
The old under the map hack strikes again.  Its been a problem in several BR games.
---
Or one of the million other posts asking this exact same question
---
They should either slow the sprint AP rate by half or remove it all together. Ridiculous trying to maneuver with a squad.
---
No real good endgame yet, but I do enjoy trying to make my C.A.M.P. the best it can be, and the new shop feature is pretty cool to mess around with :) Game has definitely gotten exponentially better since launch.
---
There are some new quests, but they are -mostly- in the form of events, however, there are some new quests that you can find off of billboards at the railroad stations. Lying Lowe(I believe that is the name of that quest) was really good and "fallout like".
---
Damn it I'm away for a week and can't get any of them.
---
Hopefully it comes back.
---
That could be it. And perhaps also to explore the vault.
---
Once people stop playing again it should drop back down to the normal 3 or 4  server disconnects a day.
---
They're basically using the same engine they used to make Oblivion back in 2006.
---
where is the inferno/hellfire power armor? will it be a paid atom shop thing?
---
This is brilliant. Studio looks great!
---
Rest I Peace and thank you for your service
---
Ok coz I have an arena that I don’t want to move
---
I bought it from another player for 30 caps
---
In Fallout where lore is important, yes.
---
i tried to be a nice guy and give items to players but most of them just wouldnt look at the ground and i dont have the emote. the follow emote doesnt work as id hoped they follow you to the bag and look around confused of why your shooting the ground in front of them. someone even thought i was trying to bully the other noobs.
---
ha, same here. panicked looking for the exit after spending way too much time inside
---
Hope these answered your question.
---
Yeah supposedly it's why they don't sell Alan Wake on Steam any more.
---
I guess it's just an indication of how many players are expected. Though, at some point we're all done walking around the vault. Maybe they'll shorten it after a while.
---
According the the people where I live, it's pronounced "nur - kur - lur".
---
it a random encounter bot that only spawns across from Charleston station
---
I get that there are limitations, but they could go past that if they made your companion randomly generated - and stays with you even if you log off and on.
---
Nah I dislike sneak builds I find them boring
---
Oh thats what that means? I’ve been playing since November and I didn’t even know that 😭
---
I love that song, it's so cute.
---
Are you on PC? I'll give you 500 rounds.
---
You equip it in the atomic shop display when you are in vault 51 waiting for deployment
---
Would this build be biable for the queen/endgame?
---
I disagree, but I don't think either of us are going to be swayed so... eh.
---
That option should be available outside of the lobby
---
I just reported a dude who was shooting through walls and flying in the air or under the map.
---
Is that the little orange vault boy poster?
---
while you are viewing it in the Atomic shop, press enter for PC and what ever for the other controller's button is.
---
Idk honestly. Id also prefer notbto "mod" or alter the game till it offically supported
---
"Server not responding. Controls disabled."
---
Also having this issue, as of the NW Beta patch.
---
Gamefly has it for 10$ in US
---
Im excited to start meeting characters.
---
Or they could make that option also outside of the lobby.
---
I do not understad what goes on in these peoples heads.  Do they think they will get away with it?  Where is the fun?  Do they really get that much joy out of annoying people?
---
Your honor since I refused to look at all the evidence I win this case.
---
Never knew that's how it worked.
---
I wouldn't mind even if we could use our account across the board. Just started up on PS4 but have been playing since November on PC. Don't mind a new character but its a bit daunting thinking about getting all those plans and whatnot again.
---
Do you mean the number next your name and others names? That is your overseer rank and it goes up based on xp you earn from downing enemies, reviving teammates etc.
---
Its rough in the 20s and 30s on supplies, atleast has been for me in the past. Best advice is try to get some help with the wolves. They are pretty tough and have some lvs on you. What platform are you on?
---
Player vendor.  Not regular vendor.
---
UK and right now
---
It depends on what you want out of the game.  This might help: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning)
---
Try going back another time a high level must have entered b4 u. Cells generate enemies based on the level of the first player to enter
---
Luckly ppl still wear the vault suit or id be doomed
---
Not if you work for Pulowski.
---
Added 6, 7 and 8.
---
Dude...   
---
But have you tried NW?
---
I thought it was a feature.
---
this was me just kidding
---
You can still open up the menu to check challenges, settings, etc. just like in Adventure/Survival.
---
Backpacks.
---
Thanks great what are you on PC or Xbox or ps4?
---
This works for my other atomic shop items, such as the flight helmets. Unfortunately the  battlecoat isn’t showing up like other item purchased from the shop.
---
That sounds pretty reasonable, I can two to three shot with my combat shotty with master shotgunner
---
I hate PvP because I suck at it. I Lose all the time and get very frustrated. different modes for PVE and PVP would be great, to please both types of player. I do not play PVP games because I have poor reflexes and the anxiety/stress is too much for me to cope with. It still stresses me out.
---
Oh ok thanks.. That's good to know
---
Give me one second. I’m at work so it might be very very late in response.
---
Well nobody ever can refer to Fallout 76 as a "full game."
---
At several points in the main progression you will hit walls you can't get past because you are either underleveled or underequipped or both.  So set the main quest aside and spend some time exploring and doing side quests, build up your ammo and chem supplies, gain some levels, then try it again.   There will be times when you go through a lot of stimpaks and run out, and times when you stockpile them so when you have a surplus save them for later.  To replenish you stocks buy them from vendors, go back to areas you already visited and reloot the containers of chems, and make sure you keep upgrading the level and type of your armor, and try to minimize getting hit, think about your tactics. Good luck.
---
Some people just want to watch the world burn.
---
ManyATrueNerd is the best reviewer of all things Fallout. He loves the game but he is also very open about his critiques.
---
I hope so.
---
From what I have read its just like the other helmets so no.
---
There's at least the text chat mod, but that broke with ths update.
---
I respect that, generally Bethesda has been very accepting of ReShades and any mod that doesn't give an "advantage".     
---
If you do find one that works, let me know, I'll pass it to the people who pass the stuff to the Dev's and see if it can't happen (or atleast get an answer) faster
---
If you have something else that takes up its spot you can’t favorite it. Make sure everything else is unselected.
---
I’ve got a hunter’s long coat you can have for 1k. 
---
GT is: Carlo Maratta
---
Those higher level area's will spawn in enemies who ever was there.  Sounds like a high level50+ was there and that is the result.  This will be an issue up to 50 for you..
---
My advice either pull a Dori and go after something shiny nearby, exploring and leveling, until you get a few more levels or you can try to server hop.  Rushing through the main quest is not good...trust me.  I did much better just wandering around and occasionally finding the quest line again.  I was probably 46 when I finished it.  My second guy is rushing past it all and feel like he missed a LOT.
---
Also there are many high levels very willing to help.  If you have a mic...just ask.
---
I was lobbing nades with that thing from like 200 yards away at a team that was fighting a scorchbeast. I couldn't actually see the players - just the scorchbeast attacking them.  We had a 3 story high camp set up, and I had a lot of nades, so I figured, "what the hell? I'll shoot some nades in a stupid high arch and see if I hit anything". Generally aiming and setting my projectile arch way up high, I started lobbing nades... and low and behold, I was getting hits for 80-150. Thinned out their team before they were anywhere near in range of us. Those poor bastards never knew what hit them I bet.
---
you can set the 1st and 3rd person FOV's in the falloutcustom.ini if you're on PC. it makes a HUGE difference in screen real estate by making the gun much smaller. also if you're on PC having the lowered weapons mod helps a ton by lowering the weapon when you arent aiming, similar to how it looks when u sprint. especially for big bulky guns, it finally lets you see wtf is infront of you
---
I agree but I'm not complaining. Anything to make CAMPS more lively is a plus in my book
---
No, even if I was tempted by yet another flavour of BR and the flocks of screechy kids punching each other in lobbies that come with it I am too busy making a sorting mod from scratch because the fantastic sorting mod we had has been sacrificed in the altar of BR.
---
Luckily for everyone - myself included because my current rage would get me either electrocuted or arrested, or both - however my urine cannot get anywhere near those servers.
---
There is really very little legendary gear that low (it exists, down to level 1, but it's *much* rarer to come across legendary bosses until you're closer to 50).
---
One exception is the campfire tales event.  There is (sometimes?) a lower level legendary boss at the end, that drops gear at least as low as level 15.  I've had a few pieces from there in my shop in the past, so I'd be willing to bet that you can pick up what you're looking for either by farming that a bit (long odds though), or checking other player's vendors for lower level gear.
---
Did u just kill them when they were on their knees? Cause finishing em off doesn't count as kills im pretty sure
---
Read inside the vault like everyone else.
---
Ugh more duping...   
---
Server stability based or a less caustic loophole?
---
You don't get that many people in Adventure mode.  Too big a performance drain compared to the stripped down characters/weapons/armor in NW.
---
I must admit I put on my most outrageously painted armor before I did that...
---
Thanks for that info!  
---
When I was grinding the Enclave's vendor for a jet pack I managed to jump back into the same server after a few rounds and find my dropped sack from a previous attempt.  I always wondered if the sacks remained whenever we dropped from a server.  I've experienced this only once, so YMMV.
---
As a Fallout game it absolutely sucks. More concerned with Battle Royale and pointless PvP shit than actually giving us a sandbox world with shit to do in it.
---
Ok so maybe they can finally use that instancing tech on the damn merchants so multiple people can talk to them at once?
---
Sounds like your in Whitesprings. Same thing happened to me the other day. Super obnoxious.
---
I don't like BR's and honestly enjoyed the ever living f^]* out of it
---
Stick around! It gets better still 😉
---
says complete right in the name.. doesnt seem unreasonable to me
---
whats that take.. roughly 2 hours?
---
No.  Workshops should always be pvp zones for obvious reasons.
---
One would hope all these answers will be released tomorrow with the inside the vault edition
---
Marie Kondo came through CAMP and convince you to get rid everything that doesn't bring you joy, I see.
---
i dont know if you've just never given a stray animal a gift but they fucking love that shit. hobos are hit or miss but a stray dog will definitely appreciate a free meal or soft blanket to lay on
---
its basically a mini-game! fallout's version of frogger!
---
All I know is if my team wants to spawn in arktos ONE MORE TIME I’m gonna lose it. Hate that spot.
---
Making your day just made my day.
---
God bless this man. Rest in peace
---
Weapon and perk card balance are the biggest issues.  Unless you spawn in with 5 or more players, melee weapons are useless.  
---
Perk wise, having them tied to the players special stat is annoying.  Just let us equip any 7 perk cards with no more than 3 under amy special stat and  the balance would be better.  Also i feel like every 5 to 10 overseer levels we should be able to pick any perk card we want, to let us at least get some decent ones.  I like the rng of the packs, but it really mukes any balance when someone  has the better perk cards just due to pure luck.
---
The turret kits being placed indoors is horribly bugged.  Most of mine get stuck in the ceiling or floor.
---
The sounds of a lot of things are selayed or coming from the wrong direction and it get annoying  when sound can play a major factor in life ir death.
---
There still is no single player mode without  teams and this makes solo players at a disadvantage to teamed up players.  Just putting me with 3 other random players does not increase my odds of survival when the follow me around like sick puppies.
---
It is possible to spawn under the water in some locations and you can actually drown before  the match loadin happens.
---
Jumping and damage tracking of players is terrible.  I can empty clips into a jumping player and miss half or more of my shots.
---
Thanks I’m here all week👌🏻
---
correct..
---
they are mostly found in containers but sometimes they can be a drop..
---
buy em if you see them in a vendor too..
---
I have done that from the start, level 200+.  Of course you get to play at that level or with the toys you have acquired, but the character will have the same physical appearance.
---
Gonna be honest, I almost never get server disconnects.
---
Wish there was a two button option to sit, drink, etc. or a way to disable it entirely. The animation takes too long. Getting shot like 6-8 times before you can respond.
---
Hahahah this is genius I love it!  It's amazing that even in a mode like this that has a clear design goal and way to be played, that you can discover your own way to play.  I love this about Fallout76, the true end game is figuring out how to play that suits you.  You can build complex murder traps in your CAMP in Adventure, or RP a psycho clown killer that creeps out other players, or play hide and seek while everyone else is Ghost Reconning the play field.  Props on figuring out a viable strat that flies in the face of what the developers may have intended.
---
I'd be ok with that too.
---
This is a thing? I absolutely 100% want (maybe even need) text chat in Fallout 76. It is a huge issue for me. I Cannot use my voice due to anxiety and communicating what I want to other players with the Emotes and behaviour is almost impossible. Will they just add this to the game? Why does it not have it in there already. :/
---
Nuclear Winter is out
---
My end game mostly consists of running about scavving for legendaries and scrapping them for scrip or restocking my shop with them. As for farming ammo, I run the .308 spewing LMG and a Prime Scorched Killing Minigun. Lucky Hole Mine is a godsend for gathering lead ore. Then there's scavving for coolant/antifreeze and pre-war money for cloth. I also collect and bulk/sell less common junk for those who might be shopping around for it.
---
 People kept jumping on the bash wagon because it gets clicks, plain and simple. The game definitely has some issues now and again but the community has a lot of heart and Bethesda is listening. Things are getting measurably better each update.
---
I’m guessing overseer rank 100.
---
I do use a headset but I like to take it off between matches and i don’t want to hear silence during that time but I also don’t wanna hear men grunting into each other.
---
Achievement unlocked: Karma Pharma.
---
.. for the rest of the week...
---
This is a funny story! You should write a book
---
Yes, I just seem to burn through stimpaks, I’m starting to think I’m just under leveled and need to grind.
---
and some just want to start a flame in your heart :D
---
Tried it and it works without CTRL, thx for that!
---
Emotes are somehow useful, but it does not replace chat, I hope it becomes a priority, it sucks not being able to write
---
I have 2/5, I would I assume I got them from a deathclaw.  But honestly don't remember.  Maybe it is something that doesn't always drop.  I know the tadpole and possum challenges aren't supposed to be something you knock out in one day.  They were designed to be achieved over time to keep you playing and giving you an end goal besides grinding for gear.
---
With the New Vegas style stat skill-check in the speech system (from wastelanders trailer) I'm really hoping that's what they're doing!
---
i had someone kill me in a nuke zone when they saw i was super low HP from rads. they took all my junk and put 1 fertilizer and 1 dirty water in the bag for me to find
---
This is my guess too, bc of the spammers selling thins, but you can Block them.
---
What they said... yea, very rare drop
---
what needs to be removed are the propaganda flyers from liberators. i just want to loot the steel and ammo from them i dont want my game to freeze for a second everytime i loot one it really gets annoying when you start getting attacked during it
---
This is probably the best advice I’ve gotten so far lol.
---
Signed..
---
either this or make it a hold button not a press..
---
r/callmekevin
---
I had an encounter where I was trying to give a lvl 3 some purified water and radaway. I found myself frustratingly trying to get in front of him to get his attention and after a few tries I just gave up. Has anyone else tried to give low levels items just for them to entirely ignore you?
---
This seems possible, it just seems strange for that high of enemies to be in a pretty early game mission.
---
Thats weird, my phone doesnt play the format of ur video :( good job still
---
the thumbs down emote has worked for me. i made a mule character to transfer my first characters inventory to my new one and had to turn down a bunch of well wishers outside the vault. one of them didnt understand but the others did
---
I think the fix is that for any sleeping animation it must be a long press. 
---
Be it a picnic table at a mountain stop or a lunch table in Watoga High school when I'm looting plastic forks I sit down like 3 times. 
---
Long press for well rested.......
---
I am glad that you did. I am raging but I am not bitter enough to begrudge people for having fun.
---
I am just having not very much fun at all however I consider a sorting mod kind of fundamental for a Creation Engine game.
---
If I don't have one every time I open the pip-boy I want to pull my eyes off my sockets.
---
So first I need to get this done, then I will go back to the game. I will leave BR for you though. I appreciate the endorsement but I am fairly certain this is not for me.
---
ME TOO. I have the Black Rider Torso &amp; arms with the Pale Rider legs &amp; helmet. I look pretty scary. Level 360, they see me holding the Daisycutter, it's priceless. Then they see me in the church putting stuff in the chest, and when I leave they come out of hiding , it's precious
---
pro tip, PC cant message anyone
---
Hey I got confused and shot my team - I suck.
---
For only this week
---
So you’re on PC and you don’t have the Microsoft store access in the UK? Pretty sure you do since 2  eternal I know literally just bought it in the UK from there...
---
I have. If someone on your team does the final .00001%, you get nothing.
---
As in til sunday or friday?
---
I run around in 1st person but switch to 3rd when I need to keep my wits about me.

Damn dude that is a lot of identifying information, like I'm sorry about your friend but maybe don't be announcing his full name to the world like that. I'm not a shitty person which is why I didn't but you just made it extremely easy for a bad person to harass his family and I got all the information I needed from a single google search.
---
Yeah Juicehead doesn't deserve to be lumped in there. He's reasonably objective and makes the effort to be honest about what's influencing him.
---
I've been playing for a while, almost after launch I can't remember but a couple of months and I've really enjoyed every moment of it honestly. A lot of the people hating on it, where not playing it themselves: Instead they were jumping on the bandwagon so to speak. It was almost "trendy" at one point to hate on Fallout 76.
---
It's a fun game, yes it has its problems but all games do. And honestly it's getting a lot of support and I think has a pretty bright future. I was gifted the game by a friend but I have already spent some money in the Atomic Shop, since I tend to engage in Micro transactions if I really enjoy a game. (please don't hate me D:).
---
Yes yes yes yes yes
---
I doubt they'll reset the levels. If they did then rewards would be subject to 1 of 3 outcomes, the first being that they leave them in, so they get kept, but then when they release the full version, those levels wouldn't reward anything at all besides cards. Second outcome would be that they take all the rewards away when sneak peak is done, making them pointless in the first place. And lastly they could make them sneak peak exclusive rewards.
---
No matter what I dont think a single person would be happy if they did a level rollback
---
Ah, the old d\*ck in the popcorn trick.
---
judging by your spelling i'll assume you havent played either NW or fortnite and are just hating from a distance.
---
18,000+ posts about it would be a positive indicator that it’s out...lol
---
It’s only 5 times. You could win instead 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
The only npcs we ever needed were Rosie and the mothman.
---
I am a fellow PC player.
---
The first one is 5. The next one is 50.
---
I think they could revive it with a better approach.  
---
All imho:
---
* Carrying progression over from adventure mode was a mistake.  Survival should require characters that are exclusive to the mode.
---
* Once the above is implemented, tweak the items in survival for PvP.  They can remove game breaking effects and items without it affecting Adventure mode.  No more one shot kills.
---
* Increase the xp even more, so players can all get up to speed quickly and an even playing field won't take long to achieve.
---
* Increase legendary drop rate.  Balanced PvP is fun PvP so making it easy for players to get the items they need for their build to work makes for a better competitive environment.
---
I am not sure Bethseda plays Fallout 76 in general. 😂😂
---
Rose’s and Mistress of Mystery quests are notoriously hard for low level players. They’re gateways to harder content in rougher areas. If the lack of progress is frustrating, then do other quests. Grind, if you so will.
---
For stimpaks: you need to dilute them. But the cheapest option is the healing salve (you should have the recipe by now). The ingredients to make a shit-ton of them can be found along the river that runs from Flatwoods to Morgantown. If you don’t have a C.A.M.P. up, then just use the cooking station at the Overseer’s Camp.
---
I see that now but i hardly ever on this sub
---
Honestly I prefer the cover, I like the faster pace.
---
I have 2 of 5 as well and my quest to find them even server hopping has been a bust! SQB is easier...lol
---
I get so confused and think NW means Nuka World 😂
---
As told by others report it to Bethesda so he can get banned
---
Yeah, his free week will be ruined......
---
I saw two players on PS4 selling the long coat for 5,500 last night.
---
Not going to echo the others who are talking about how enemies spawn based on the level of players being in there prior, but I will say the MSQ can definitely hold off at times while you do side quests here and there. A lot easier that way.   
---
As far as stimpaks, pharma farma is great and you'll likely not have too many issues after.   
---
Pharma(Luck)+ first aid(Intelligence) and then diluting them down. Never, ever run out of stimpacks. At least that's what I was doing when I was running low on my first playthrough. You'll probably also want to look at traveling pharmacy, to reduce weights at times. But I suspect it's entirely up to you on how you want to build, too.
---
I believe so.  It’s up the stairs.  Give you the option to go into the atomic shop.   Then in that menu you can equip purchased outfits
---
Get in in that sweet fishing rivalry action red dead has a monopoly on
---
Yup, i can't find anything about "will never be npc's" lots of stuff about how right now npc's are not in the game for either technical reasons or plot-related reasons.
---
Also, there was that test npc in the dev room all that time ago so it's hardly a surprise they where going that direction
---
Because it's a a multiplayer game... They are likely working on a true single-player RPG successor to Fallout 4/3/nv/2/1 so don't worry. Fallout 76, is like an off-shoot in my opinion, and attempt to fuse Multiplayer with Fallout open world and you should take it as such.
---
Probably not. The best queen builds are typically heavy gunner or melee. It's tough to make a real difference as a rifleman
---
The 17th
---
It's worth it 100% if you have enjoyed fallout in the past or liked 4. It's a really solid game with a ton of stuff to do and uncover. It let's you play how you want to and gives so many options. If you want a buddy to explore and chill with I am on PC and still not even level 15 after back to the game from last year.
---
Hmmm, it has been working for me.  It seems to still continue the reloading sound but doesn't actually reload the gun.  Check for updates again; I know you already did, but can't hurt to try again.  If not, idk reinstall I suppose.
---
Aight thanks boys
---
&gt;The perk card system should work like Nuclear Winter where you only have one slot for each SPECIAL
---
thats not how it works..
---
you can have 7 cards active at a time.. they can be under any S.P.E.C.I.A.L that has enough points.. 
---
you can run 7 luck cards if you had the cards and points to do so..
---
-edit
---
clarity
---
I did not realize there was a dot when aiming in 3rd person...
---
I've grown way too used to 1st person and VATs, which is partially why I'm failing at NW. Just good old 1st person iron sights and not hitting bupkis.
---
such edge. much wow
---
I agree. At one point, you're making more of a comedy show vs a review. Look at AVGN. He's admitted out of character that Simon's Quest isn't that bad, and that he thinks of it fondly from when he was a kid. A good amount of people (both viewers and new reviewers) have taken the idea in the wrong way, and it's done a bit more harm than intended.
---
Am I able to switch my NW character to my other non level 1 adventure character? If not, will leveling up my NW charactor in adventure mess anything up?
---
Search super mutant meat bags and scorchbeast guano piles.
---
Hahaha I can confirm this and it’s hysterical.
---
It doesn't specify who's laughing last. So there you go. Its not you.
---
Ah, I see. Will definitely buy them if I see them, thank you!
---
Love the intro bit
---
True, true
---
I run a very similar build, and I think your diversions from mine are mostly viable.  
---
Couple things:
---
* I favor Gun Fu over Evasive, but if you need the tankiness, that's what it is.  
---
* Mutations are really, really good.  I'd favor full starched genes and class freak over serendipity and then bloody mess
---
* As for things to have available:  Once you've got your leveling done, it won't be a bad idea to get Max demo expert, in case you get an explosive weapon.  That will increase the damage the explosions from your shots do.  Same thing with grenadier, which increases explosion radius.
---
Honestly it's kind of hard to see those fuckers sometimes.  Needs a glow or something
---
Ahah of course ! Fallout became a great child actually, the ugly baby is gone
---
Or hold down button to initiate said task
---
Preferring a cover to Johnny himself singing it??? 
---
what kind of sacrilege are you trying to spread?? 
---
Were you one of those people who preferred New Coke over Coke Classic??
---
lol
---
The Social Distortion cover is pretty good, TBH
---
I finished 2nd twice as a solo player. The framework under the bridge can be climbed and camp placing is easy to make runways with carpets. 1 loss was because he had more stims as we both burned. The other was me hiding in my camp maze until a team finally got me.
---
I did scan and repair game files, but no working still :( I think I am going to delete the install and re-download it. Not a huge problem I just got 120mbps internet package lol. I will report back if it fixes it. Thx for reply
---
I agree, i cant see how anyone needs 2 full minutes to add/exchange a few perk cards, we can only have 7 total anyway
---
Id like map selection part to start as soon as its been verified we have enough players
---
I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised. When Bethesda tries to innovate on established conventions, they do tend to do some wacky backwards ass shit that makes no sense.
---
There’s an event there that occasionally high levels show up for called uranium fever
---
I need to feel useful! I know even my gauss can't compete with a Deathclaw gauntlet in the right hands! 😭
---
I won a game because the last guy/group left died, I guess either in the fire or someone two groups managed to take each other out st the same time. Needless to say my teammate and I were shocked when the "congratulations overseer" message popped up and we had just been hiding in the forest.
---
I'll never trust a reviewer whose entire schtick is negativity.
---
Walmart has it on pc for this much but it's only $13.99 on consoles there.
---
I’m like that to! However I play on PS4, I noticed lots and lots of people don’t use their mics but they hear me. I do call outs if anyone needs weapons, healing or ammo, and always make sure to call out enemies. I sometimes feel real stupid being the only one talking but I always say in match that if I annoy you please feel free to mute me! I’m always super nice even when teaming up with people who are far younger than me. All in all I’ve been having an absolute blast playing it, inventory management takes a bit of time to get use to along with knowing what ammo you need. Also the TTK seems pretty high cause you can die relatively fast.
---
I think it’s going to be a new set and these are just skins for it. A terminal in vault 51 talks about another prototype PA set.
---
I notched serpenditity down to level one and added starched genes, scaly skin, grounded, and eagle eyes.
---
That list is great. I hope maybe when the game fully releases someone makes a guide with some tactics like this. There’s so many ways to play in this game!
---
I sell the longcoat for 3,000 on xbox. I see many people selling it for 5,000 though. out of line if you ask me, but it can take a lot of time to find them. FCJ, I have no idea.
---
Perfect!
---
10 seconds of scrolling would probably give at least 5 posts..
---
Yup, this is on PC. Thanks for the reply!
---
LOLOL yeah that shit has happened to me a couple times. that and accidentally drinking toxic water while looting its one of the reasons I like power armor hehe. it sucks man better luck next time. working on changing into a shotty build soon I expect I'll do that to myself a few times in the near future as well.
---
Fair points, ironically for me it's not sorting but PLM that is critical, can't imagine playing without it!
---
Paging /u/LadyDevann for visibility because I haven't seen this discussed here yet.
---
&gt;Although, sadly, you can’t romance your new non-playable comrades.
---
start over.
---
I just used a lever action rifle with a short nv scope. Take the rifleman perks and go for headshots!!  Mine is a sneak sniper build.
---
the 17th is when the free trial of the full game is over and also the BR mode pre beta will end..
---
Yeah healthy feedback of things is important and if somebody give good feedback on how to make the game better or exposes issues with the game it's not hate it's an issue that needs to be addressed and taken care of
---
It's incredibly accurate, put dot on baddie and fire. Whereas iron sights its much more of a "I guess I put the tip of the triangle on his head?"
---
I try my best never to rely on VATs, I only use it for very quick spin shots if I hear something behind me or I am running away. Good for plinking deathclaws in a 360 and continue running.
---
I love the SxDx cover version
---
well you can use that time to use the restroom, make a drink, eat some food, watch tv i guess
---
i usually just end a match immediately when i die, so i doubt ill get this challenge completed
---
As someone sitting on the side watching this subreddit since the start. From what I can tell things were utterly horrendous at the start but have slowly improved till now I almost never see posts complaining about bugs. And now reminds me of when I watched the LoZ: BotW subreddit.
---
Besides I know you'll have to play it, there are COBJ's locked behind the wall, things only obtainable through play..    
---
The completionist in you won't let that stand...
---
Is there an eta on full release?
---
Luckily they haven't blocked that one... yet.
---
Both SFE (which I currently don't use, I am OK with the nukesdragons method) and PLM have been updated.
---
I did the same thing at the ski lodge!  I was in my 20's and ran in there and all of these level 60 something scorched come at me, and I think I actually screamed IRL...then died...
---
And sorry for the questions lol too lazy to google it
---
Seriously.
---
lol you got bethesda'd
---
Im sure they will fix it.. but DamN that is funny
---
They mean photomode.  Not the camera you switch to like a weapon.
---
Yeah, noticed that too. Probably a mistake on their part since they that other article is about how they could be romance-able. Both are written by different writers.
---
But the song in the Wild Appalachia trailer was already in the game anyway? I hear it on the radio all the time.
---
Hackers suck, but I get why they do it: wanting to feel good at a game they can't win with skill.
---
But...it's fucking Fallout 76 lmao. Not Apex Legends. Why does someone care that much to tryhard like this on here?
---
Report the guy
---
Idk, the old one's good but I like the energy of the cover.
---
Ill help you out my gt is Talal8812 when are you usually on?
---
Interesting theory. Hard one to test, too, since no one really wants to "throw away" scrip. At least I know I don't lul.
---
To get over my anxiety of being startled in this game, I turned off the radio and music in the settings and just listen to happy reggae music on Spotify while slaughtering Glowing Ones
---
I legit started yesterday and am still very low level, but my PSN is same as name on here.  I'll be playing most week nights and then on weekends.
---
no clue.. right before Wastelanders starts at the latest would be my best guess..
---
Walmart is 13$
---
Rest in Piece, Mike.
---
I wish you could fill the bag ahead of time and have it ready.  People always wander off by the time I've gone through my inventory. 
---
I started just dropping bags by the body to the right of the vault entrance and hoping somebody notices. But the Overseer's cache at her camp is probably the smarter option.
---
Well we'll see when it comes out eh, only a few months to go
---
I see them often near the streams at Helvetia.
---
Consider adding me if you wanna! :)
---
Sweet!
---
To add to that if you’re not paying attention to the circle you are going to die because you cannot out run it, being that I’ve only died once to it, it was still a bad way to learn.
---
On gamefly its 10$ if you wanna get it cheaper
---
Be home in about two hours I'll add ya!
---
VATS rifles is my build, and I’ve recently picked up the automatic rifle perks so tough enemies are no longer a problem(furious auto railway rifle kills scorchbeasts in about 15 shots). I’d love to have a shotgun/heavy/melee character since they are ALL strength perks for some fuckin reason, but I just...can’t. Already went through being bad once.
---
Haha thanks!
---
Nice :)
---
In his defense there are very grindy things depending on your play style.   
---
I was a B.E.T.A. Player who wanted to be a Power Armor specialist, and before they made the plans as common as toilet paper I have a couple hundred hours into grinding the few quests that rewarded plan, server hopping Phenix and treasure maps...     
---
Have another friend who's a "completionist" and must have every recipe and plan unlocked...  
---
These play styles make games grindy
---
Hear you, it's murder for completionists
---
I say nook you lur to annoy the pedants
---
That’s so dope. When I was younger I wanted to be a sniper in the marines or something. I assume there’s a lot of mental math involved to land hits long range depending on conditions, I don’t think I could process all that lol. 
---
I get you though, many people just play for amusement but I think there’s so much potential to play skillfully and tactful, which is a huge part of the fun.
---
Make it an orbital strike.
---
How the hell is this fun
---
Lovely artworks! :)
---
The Deathclaw-tan picture is my favorite.
---
Ha .... I just moved on to games I have been hanging onto for months (RDR2 and Spiderman).  They are fantastic, and it is a revelation playing a game that is smooth, with no perceivable/un-repaired broken bits, relies on ZERO RNG, and has a story that involves no stop start, repetitive BR tedium or annoying PvP.
---
Perhaps I should have offered you my stuff. L.O.L.
---
I think it maybe because I just uploaded it
---
Honestly I wish you allocated special based on your overseer rank. It's frustrating coming into NW using my character who is specced for melee. I never use melee in NW, so all the great perception cards like Commando, I can't use.
---
It is within the realm of possibility.
---
However is not going to happen before the current swarm dissipates.
---
And is probably going to take KK, Cancerous and the rest coming back. Apparently this mode is best enjoyed with friends and we both know what our friends think about the current state of affairs.
---
6. Player drinks Nukashine you gave them
---
7. Profit
---
Except they don't buy items and OP is trying to sell things
---
Understand the fear but they are random, you'll get anything from "nothing" to the highest Tier spawn for each chest, so in effect it is.
---
I used to play sneaky and try hiding and bushes and it worked a while but now a lot of people seem to have removed the bushes from their gamefiles or maybe they are removed on lower settings because now a lot of people see straight through them
---
Can you imagine 52 max-budget CAMPs, full stashes, max inventory characters on one server?
---
Yeah I was wondering what went on when I would occasionally down people and they'd blow up lmao. Easy kills
---
I don’t recall there ever being a cap. Is this a flex post?
---
Buy it! It's great! V enjoyable
---
Confused on the bullet, “NPCs very similar to Fallout 4”, yet every other bullet basically says the opposite. Does it just mean in cosmetic design?
---
Google says "Error CE-34878-0 is an error on the PlayStation 4 that can occur due to corrupt data or system software. Press and hold the [PS] button on your controller. Allow the PlayStation 4 to fully power down and wait for 10 to 20 seconds."
---
someone will eventually win 50 times.. their teammates night watch..
---
nobody else is doing that one.. lol
---
I love democracy
---
Those are the only two, one more will come on Friday and the last one on Sunday
---
Let me guess, PC?
---
I thought this was about flying guys...
---
Along with 6 other fixes on bethesdas site. It's the first search result
---
Probably to decide what type of guns you’ll use before you start.
---
Scoped Lever and any Handmade
---
Report him to Bethesda so they can hone their cheat detection and ban him
---
I think PLM (perk loadout manager) seems to work around this somehow, I didn't notice this last night once I got the mod working. 
---
Could be worth a shot
---
I have other friends ;)    
---
You could join me with them, some are organized raiders, others counter-griefers, a few are pro-PvP'ers and some are random noobs..  
---
Only downside to having 300+ people on your friends list is you freeze for 3 - 15 seconds when you open the social tab :(
---
Plenty of MMO's or other online games build themselves up successfully purely based off PvE content. 
---
This game happens to be a "Fallout" game that also conveniently ignores that principle.
---
This is why I just don't go on r/fallout anymore. It's just turned into a mindless circle jerk and sometimes even veers off into full on conspiracy theories. I've read more level headed and reasonable disscusions on NMA at this point. And ironically enough, they say that THIS is the more toxic Fallout sub.
---
No way you would get banned for it, go ahead and give it a try. I've personally never used it but I've heard good things about it
---
Ouch, I'm on XBox so I hadn't considered that.
---
I would advise you to not do the main quest this quickly. I think you should go back and explore. Black water mine is a high level area. I didn’t start the story in depth till I was level 45. The enemies in some areas were just too high.
---
Drink Nukashine. Lots of it. It gives you rad wings.
---
Works now
---
No. It's not a flex post.
---
I've never been able to have more than 40 into strength before, and that was riding less than 10% HP.
---
Something has broken somewhere, or something was changed.
---
It's not a case it's a crybaby trying to get views on his video and claiming a company is morally bankrupt for a buggy game and wanting money.
---
Why thank you sir
---
There are a lot of fish in the streams and rivers. But when you get closer to them they just disappear. To me, fishing in a survival game would just make sense. Huge fisherman irl. Would love to do it in fallout as well lol
---
Hopefully they'll make some changes for when it gets released for real later.
---
We need orbital strike beacon
---
How do you place a camp? I learned how to place the looted stuff, like guard posts
---
What's BR?
---
I was leaning towards semi auto rifles and melee
---
I was in that match too..
---
Im glad you got video.. that was fucked...
---
They show up as atomic shop items, but I know the bronze trophy at least can indeed be placed in other player's camps. I dunno if it's intentional or what.
---
It's rater clunky in FO76 but making a basic shelter can save your life if you're smart and fast enough.
---
There are also three quick build items you can place nearly everywhere: Machine turret, wall and outpost.
---
Cards in Nuclear Winter are either new or changed card from the main game. There are no ranks on the cards, so they're either maxed or changed somewhat.
---
yep it's killed me far more often than it's intended effect.
---
If You gonna flex on us at least show us your build pls
---
Finally something hints at ammo scrapping. I was hoping for so long they would add the ability to scrap unused ammo and re-craft it to a different caliber. Like i have 5k .45 rounds that i would gladly convert to 5.56 even if its a 2:1 rate
---
Quick question, keep meaning to ask one of the people exporting maps...   
---
It it possible to export a map with the X / Y coordinates on it? (grid style).      
---
I want to do a page dedicated to Worldspace bugs, and getting the exact Coordinates when logging and reporting would expedite the process
---
Youtube comments are the intellectual septic tank of the internet
---
Ok, then save up your perk points until you can get the corresponding perks
---
Same as adventure, pull up pipnoy and hit LB.  On xbox anyway, not sure about the other plats
---
It is a thing but it's everyone connected not per server or area. Still its useful if your looking to team up or found something cool like the tourist!
---
300+ LeL. You do get around :P
---
"Your honor. I have refused to look at the evidence and I judge that any evidence brought against my client is out of spite and monetary gain. I wouldn't know though, I refuse to look at it."
---
we got killed coming down the hill toward flatwoods.. about 5 minutes before your vid starts..
---
I saw the whole thing
---
Record it and send to Bethesda
---
It's totally separate. The only thing that carries over is blueprints you make
---
I got it through amazon (I think) because I got it for Christmas
---
oh I didn't know that
---
Why can we even pick them up? Remove them as loot entirely. I'm not picking up random rocks and trash, either.
---
comic sans
---
I'm a merchant, what can I say?   
---
That and I've got stalkers..
---
I didn't know that. I just saw people jumping over me so I immediately thought it was that
---
Honestly everyone I know who play it really enjoy it, including myself. I felt like many people have a skewed view of the game because it is a departure from what Fallout is. It is though very nice, and I like it much more than FO3, New Vegas or FO4. Its quiet with lots to discover.
---
I found one here, I'm sure it's random but at least it's a known location that can spawn. In the container in the crib, up in Tangara Town, kinda behind everything:  [https://i.imgur.com/g9nhKAK.png](https://i.imgur.com/g9nhKAK.png)
---
are you running mods? my mods broke the game this patch. they would load all the NW perks into my adventure perk lists every time i logged in and it disabled all perk card effects. had to remove most of them to get it all working right again
---
I played for quite a bit last night on free trial and got sold.  Gamefly has it used for ten bucks right now.  So cheap so why not?
---
One of the biggest gripes i have with the mode is the down system.
---
Once downed youre EXTREMELY vulnerable. and theres no respawn mechanic so if you go down youre sol. its no fun to watch your friends play for 25 mins when you die at the start.
---
in other battle royales when down you can move to cover and wait for a revive, or use yourelf as bait for your teammates to kill the other team. youre also a lot more tanky as a downed player in other games. 
---
i use the hunting rifle and once i headshot someone and they go down, i just do an immediate followup shot on their body (which cant move) and immediatelly kill them.
---
i think they need to either make you 2-3x more tanky while downed or impliment a crawl system in order to cut back on this.
---
Hold V on PC. I’ll try that, thanks
---
I've had 41 for months. I have to have all my unyielding armor on and multiple teammates to reach it though. No chems used.
---
Doesn't that count as at least downing them?
---
That's like 2 rifle's worth. These need to just be trash and unable to be picked up.
---
And stick around for a hair longer. In adventure mode, when you attack with VATS I dont even see it.
---
Don't know why you got downvoted. That's exactly what I was gonna ask too. Saw someone post something very similar with vids of it yesterday on PC.
---
I see what you're saying. I honestly do and I felt similar over Fallout 4, in that, i felt a bit not really "fallouty" but I now take these games as, just games. And not some pre-conceived notion of what a "Fallout" game should be, and I like them. I enjoy them, honestly. I have over 1000 hours in Fallout 4 it's a great game in my opinion and I will spend a lot of time in 76, too. So there's that.
---
I actually found two more around the corner outside too.
---
Didn't have any the last few days but, haven't been able to get through a single Nuclear Winter match today, haven't tried the normal game.
---
Rad wings sound fun
---
Yes spottet enemys get a red marker over there head.
---
Yeah ill have a look when im back home in a few weeks
---
Max strength special, with unyielding gear with no additonal strength, radicool and solar powered.
---
15 + 15 + 5 + 3 + 2 does not equal 53.
---
No food bonuses or chems.
---
Something is broken here.
---
Edit, forgot about the shielded brotherhood underroos.
---
That's where you're objectively wrong, kiddo😎👉
---
I would assume actually getting them to that point is downing. I killed 3 ppl yesterday that were on their knees and didnt get anything. Maybe it is broke
---
It’s an entirely separate thing!
---
PS4, so no mods.
---
Personally would love pvp to be removed as I prefer Adventure mode just to be one big coop fun time where we all hold hands and skip like in the trailer short of vault boy. Not joking I honestly like cooperation between people as it gives me a nice warm fuzzy feeling.
---
&gt;They will not be able to follow you around like previous Fallout games.
---
Well, whats the point of calling them a companion then? If it's being OP in a big group that they're worried about why not make it so there can be a max of 4 people NPC or real in a group, player teams with under 4 people can have at least 1 companion. Say there's 2 people on your team, each of you gets one companion.
---
Did you take a picture with them?
---
Haha, good to know. I'll be swapping that back out later. 🤣
---
Winning counts as completing a match
---
yeah having a perk card that you get at random with a .50 cal machine gun and a grenade launcher that you also get at random definitely makes him better than me. you're right, I'm an unaware idiot thanks for helping me out.
---
PS4 or PC is the plan as I don't own an Xbone. I just don't know which I'd enjoy more so :'D
---
thank christ...thats all i wanted for the longest time. npcs and characters i care about to make the wasteland feel less empty.
---
I've heard multiple people say that this isn't the same game that was released in November, and they may be right. At that time, though, this game blew chunks.
---
I've also heard it said that PS4 servers are 'more stable' because, well, just because. No real reasoning, other than 'they are'.
---
The game 2 weeks after release dropped to $30, and has pretty much stayed there the entire time. This isn't the sign of a game that is great, or even good.
---
I can't recall the last time I played, simply because there's no mission, no stability, no real 'feel' to the game. I picked it up for just around $30 in December, and, honestly, have put in maybe an hour to it.
---
When all there is to do is wander around, talk to robots, fight robots, it gets pretty damn boring after a while
---
I assume it's the way he stated his question, also because AFAIK neither Xbox One or PS4 has been cracked to allow custom software at least not in their current firmware which would make hacking in them impossible and as such most people would assume his question to be hostile as in "Lemme guess you're on PC LUL".
---
Though it could just be innocent as "Are you on PC?" just doesn't feel like that with the "Let me guess" part.
---
You probably had to do alot of explaining
---
Platform?
---
Thanks for the tag! We'll take a look at this.
---
I want to roll naked with that voice in satin sheets

 &gt; Thanks for the tag! We'll take a look at this.

Hahaha. I was doing the mystery sword mission where you have to kill 6 different enemies. Fast travelled to Vault 76 area for low level easy kills. Saw a couple of 1-2 levelers and decided to make them some armor at the overseer's camp. I wave and while at the bench he attacks me. I ignore him, finish making/upgrading an armor set and put the bag on the ground along with a nice low level gun. I emoji him, shoot at the ground where the bag was, but he continues to attack. I back away but the attacks continue. Finally I had enough and just decide to one shot him. 
---
Sorry dude I was just trying to help. Why you gotta go and keep attacking me?
---
Of course winning counts lol. Is this some snarky way of saying “git gud”?
---
Indeed. Also would add the solide, large base of veterans/guides who been able to take care of the new arriving dwellers to get them a flawless start in Appalachia
---
Equipa flare gun. Keep spare flares. Use accordingly. 
---
They actually for some strange reason worked for me. Players see it and gravitate towards it.
---
The guy was a cunt, and I don't really plan on playing with him again. But instead of causing trouble I dealt with him the way I know how. I was fucking with him, like he was with me, but mine was more passive. In the end couldn't we say I technically tricked him to stop harassing me and then convinced him to give me items? I mean that's not exactly what happened but it's not like i bent a knee to the guy. I was just having fun, but anyway I appreciate you saying that
---
The time difference is unfair . Stealth boys only work for 30 seconds, berry mentats are 5 mins I think or 3.
---
I gotcha; could be taken as a smart-ass question. I took it ass an innocent question but I see whatcha mean, lol.
---
See! It happens! Lmao
---
Good news, good news.  I need someone to work the fields and scrub the rust off the walls.  Hopefully they can shoot better than turrets!
---
He wears undies... That's the cape of the working class.
---
Yes, meant it as in I also play on PC and I am tired of seeing this while I am playing too.
---
There are perks that let you sprint with a pistol, a perk for sprinting, AP refresh perks, and computer terminals that show players locations.
---
Stalkers... sounds ominous...
---
Why remove it entirely when you have the option to completely opt out of PVP if you choose to?
---
Stealth boys are a rarity in NW, you only get them from locked/orange containers or elite AI. It's not the same situation as survival where stealth boys are a dime a dozen
---
All the good shits for hella high levels so goota grind
---
join in by also screaming.
---
I don't think there is, I've been in some at level 2.
---
im praying to todd that fallout nv style crafting is coming back. with the wastelanders npcs and dialouge, i can really see it turning into that, and that's something i really like.
---
I care about Rose!  Care enough to smelt her down and craft her into a flight of stairs.
---
It will
---
I wonder if it was glitched
---
No, because everything comes level 50. Weapons, armor shit comes all fully upgraded. It's all useable by anyone because we are all equally stripped to nothing.
---
I agree that some weapons completely outclass others on console, but I’d like to add the Gatling gun, both grenade launchers, the Combat Shotgun,and the Tesla rifle to your list. With the heavy gunner perk card, I’m constantly doing 100+ damage body shots with the Gatling gun. With the explosive perk, your grenades and grenade launchers do crazy AOE damage. The Combat Shotgun completely shreds up close, to the point where the enemy can barely react. The Tesla rifle requires you to only hold down the trigger when you’re close and it’s GG.
---
The easiest way I've found to gift noobies is to get their attention with the gift emote, then when they come running over all excited, gift them a full clip of bullets to the face...
---
Could make workshop item generation(minable resources) slower but make each of the container instanced to the players so it can be a community workshop where if its owned it provides a reduced fast travel cost(I prefer free but not going to happen) and free materials for everyone plus the community can work together to defend it from waves.
---
Flying? Those are Vertibots, not the BOS.
---
Although the BOS is involved in the later parts of the main questline.
---
Huh. Must’ve been a glitched piece
---
I bought it yesterday for $14. Only played for about an hour last night but I think I'm going to enjoy it a lot.
---
Don’t be all forgiving yet.The  wastelanders story might not even be good. It’s not bad to be optimistic though. Things are looking up for this game!
---
Had something similar happen except missile launcher instead of grenade launcher and guy had a super sledge and power armor
---
That's not the brotherhood, they're vertibots not vertibirds (they're autonomous).
---
I should sit at 38 maxed out without food/chem bonuses.
---
53 should not be possible.
---
I agree, but this was clearly more than that. Maybe if there was a perk that let you shoot through walls maybe.
---
YouTube comments represents the worst in humanity. Never have I seen humans get so vile in the modern world (I exaggerate  don't slam me with a counter-argument)
---
I love Fallout 4, and I played 76 for like 120 hours on release. I dont hate either of these games. 
---
I'm just disappointed that the lions share of what Bethesda has added to 76 is primarily PvP shit. Its disappointing, and unless they actually add some PvE/Sandbox shit to the game, I'll probably never play 76 again.
---
It had to have glitched because I got into ultricite pa 2 round I played ever
---
No i only got 2 kills per game
---
I like that you can't run very fast. Makes it easier to nuke a bunch of people :)
---
bad things happen on bridges, shoutout to pewds
---
Battle Royale
---
apparently its a perk card called frog legs from what other people are telling me. so I guess really only random if you're lucky enough to get the perk but once you have it then you have it
---
true, rose is dope! she actually has personality...unlike all the faceless holotapes out there xD.
---
side note. i dont care if its human npcs, or just...npc's in general. as long as theyre characters and make the world feel alive im happy.
---
I'm not saying pick them all up. If you have them or you're close to a vendor, it's free caps...
---
The bow in the video was for the Wastelanders update so at worst it'll be sometime between Sept and late December.
---
Also not to be a negative Nancy but if the crossbow is any thing to go by it'll be subpar because of lack of interesting and useful mods. I hope i'm wrong but they really need to upgrade the crossbow and that's coming from someone who only plays Bloodied DCG build.
---
well we have already seen the thingy used to make cool robots in our game, so it's already there :)
---
Could have also been a cargobot that the mold miners started a fight with, I've seen super mutants and protectrons get onto it with them
---
Y’all remember when Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Carl Perkins banded together as ‘The Survivors’?
---
Popped it in my watch later list, looking forward to watching it.
---
Maxed "Animal Friend" and "wasteland whisperer". But I think you only need one of those cards at the very least
---
You know you've made it big when you've got stalkers, right? (Looks around nervously)
---
Yeah and clearly you can be a smartass too. You know exactly what I mean, you are just trying to start an argument.
---
I started this morning and so far so good.  It reminds me a lot of FO4 (not a bad thing) with a strong survival focus.  I can see why people wouldn't like there not being NPCs but I've always enjoyed the "found footage" quests in FO.
---
I haven't decided if I'll buy it (very busy with Elsweyr) but I might.
---
New dweller:
---
*"HA! Saw those rabbit tux guys? What a laugh"*
---
Veteran:
---
*"woah woah woah* **SHHHHHHHH** *...careful there fella!"*
---
I found its easier to farm copper by killing Mr Gutsys, unless you actually need the ore itself.
---
It sounds like a rockabilly cover.
---
Also, the Fallout universe has Tool, Nirvana, Tina Turner and Elton John as musical acts. This isn't out of place.
---
Just dropped him a sub, he keeps his videos short which is dope. Shows he's not chasing that 10 minute ad revenue.
---
I don't think there is a way to mark, AFAIK it's just any time someone shoots and you're in a certain radius of that person.
---
Oh okay. I thought it said something about the Brotherhood but I guess not. Cool that they are part of the story though.
---
And very helpful even by accident. The sheepsquatch is best avoided until you're strong enough. I saw a Mr. Handy herder with a couple Brahman yesterday, so I casually started milking them when WHAM. Legendary Level 50 Sheepsquatch stomped my butt into the ground.
---
Omg Thank you I'm so sorry idk if you're gonna be on later I'm sadly stuck at work for the next three hours I usually post never expecting anyone to offer but of course if you're on later I'll buy it and if it helps I'm willing to pay another 500 to 1000 caps if you save it for me
---
Yh I need the ore itself.
---
Check discord servers. Met a bunch of good people to play with on there.
---
Thank you sadly I'm on xbox
---
Question:
---
Does level go up according to place (e: 1st gets 200 exp, 10th gets 100 exp, 20th gets 25 exp, etc.)?
---
I might play if I don't have to shoot for first every time, but I don't want to be a leech and make teammates do all the work.  I just want to play casually as BR is not my thing.
---
LOL that's cause they are hostile even if you place them down they will shoot you or your teammates eventually 50% chance, cause they are BUGGED at the moment...
---
Makes sense
---

So it’s basically when I shoot at them?
---
Who needs to peek around corners when you can jump *over* them with froglegs?
---
Glad you tried it and found out how great it is. Welcome to the community :)
---
now you're talkin.
---
Thank you I have another seller in line but if it doesn't turn out I'll let you know
---
There is also a terminal with lvl105 requirement!  ZAX's mainframe isn't even the last bit of lore!
---
They showd the bow with the Survival update, specifically the Tadpole content. I think. I know itll probably be pretty weak, especially since it doesnt really fit in any of the current weapon categories. Im also hoping to be suprised though.
---
dunno? Id buy it and wait to see what happens at the end of the week..
---
maybe it will just ask you for a key at the end of the week?
---
worst case scenario youll have to start again?
---
if you do start over youll be able to correct any early mistakes you may have made the first time..
---
Welcome to what we call afternoon in Appalachia, have fun but be careful.
---
Can PC people just hit print screen or do we have to go into photo mode?
---
Yes please. We need some fishing!
---
They could re-review the game, or companies that have been making video games for decades can stop releasing games in such lousy shape.
---
I'm glad you're enjoying the game, but Bethesda brought the heavy criticism on itself.
---
Yeah I asked him why he does it a while ago and he said he just loves the process and the game. The editing and quality really reflects this.
---
I think they said that *some* of them are only usable in Nuclear Winter. But so far I haven't seen any Adventure-compatible cards.
---
Naw. It was still great in the beginning if you could tough it through the bugs.
---
We always play together on ps4.
---
have any mods? turn them off?
---
I don't do any kind of fps pvp. I play some league of legends and some wow pvp, 100% a different game.  
---
I was skeptical going into this. Fallout76 is my relaxed game. I play with two friends, we do all the quests and stuff together. I play a medic type with shotguns, one girl is the tank, other girl is the sniper. Works for us.  
---
But I think I played a dozen games of Nuclear Winter this morning. I suck but it's really fun. Like, run for your lives, see how long you can survive. :D I sat behind a tree with a shotgun trying to hold my breath in as only 3 more players on the map came looking for me. @-@  
---
Do you get anything if you die, but your team places first?
---
Love that I’m not the only person doing this!! I’ve been giving out plans, stimpaks, water, canned dog food, etc. I just stand over the bag and go up and down lol
---
Next thing you know you'll need bodyguards :P
---
ahh, so i can make blueprints in adventure mode and then build them in NW? or ill have to blueprint the ones i make while actually in NW?
---
thank you for your reply btw
---
That stinks, I don't even care about winning I just need to grind this shit for xp so I can use the laser rifle skin
---
Hey look. A year later and Bethesda cleaned up the mess they called Fallout 76 and completed the game. But hey you get to buy it again and we'll call it an expansion.
---
I got some my first ever match so I don't think so?
---
So you are having a shit fit and I watched most of the video. That dude has a grating voice, like I dont believe that is his accent. Anyway, I found the video by clicking on your name and finding it whenever you posted it. 
---
2 things, well 3.
---
1. Every game exploit ever has been met with bans or punishment. That's not new or surprising but gamergaters are entitled pissbabies.
---
2. You commented in /wow, I imagine that means you play wow. And somehow dont have a problem with them doing the same, weird and u surprising. 
---
3. I was not at all surprised about your various comments and general attitude. You really think you are a champion of some sort sticking it to people. Holding a mirror to society right? Get a haircut, shave and take a bath.
---
The code for it came with the special tricentennial editions.
---
I'm not 100% sure. In Adventure, I've bound the '-' key to my diluted stimpaks, and use them almost exclusively, so I don't know. I think 'h' will use whatever stimpaks you have though, if I've heard it right from others.
---
They have to shoot to be marked, as far as I know.
---
Gamer outrage culture is a terrible phenomenon
---
The whole point is to level up and play the holotapes etc and gain access.
---
Yeah I'm just getting thru for the adventure mode stuff. It is fun tho.
---
I've watched a couple incidents with streamers, there is definitely a few people out there doing something unintended ('hacking' is such an overused and inaccurate term).  It's nothing new, though I'd hoped that the lockdown they have on the NW part of the game would have prevented much of that.
---
Great effort on the list
---
I did the exact same thing with division 2
---
&gt; The lack of an FOV slider really bugs me.
---
But there is an FOV slider...
---
Screenshot them and upload them to your onedrive account. Thats what i do.
---
Why should it not be possible?
---
Turning off vsync in the .txt settings and making changes in the Nvidia control panel can help with performance btw. You can find the instructions pretty easy on Google.
---
I believe the perk cards were data mined a patch or two ago, although a full list was not compiled to my knowledge
---
fair enough, I guess everyone has their own idea of what Fallout is
---
I'm not much of an pvp player either but Nuclear Winter is really fun :D And I don't think so, you only get  rewards when you die. And if your teammates survive they will get something better because they survived longer. (depends also how well you played)
---
There's a copper pit across from Hillock Hotdogs in the Forest. Just above the power station.
---
K thanks for the info
---
I suspect that cheaters are going to be a problem for the free trail period. Use cheats and get banned during the free trail? Just make a new account, download it again, and go right back to cheating.
---
Rifleman really lacks good DPS for the Queen. I use rifle perks when I want to save ammo and commando for the Queen. 9 card points isn't too difficult to get. Adrenaline, gun fu and commando makes some crazy damage for the Queen and imposter sheepsquatch fights. That being said it uses a lot of ammo and does about the same damage as melee and less than a lot of heavy gun builds.
---
Solid Writeup, don't agree with it all, but tossing to a community manager to pass to the Dev's.
---
By the time you're over rank 100, I'm sure you'll have 50 under your belt.
---
If you wanna know how Fallout 76 is like , think Fallout 4 with worse graphics , less content , no NPCs , more bugs, but with multiplayer.
---
Because the math doesn't work like that.
---
The stat bonuses don't add up to 53.
---
No, still have mine.  It's also on sale as an add on right now.  All the editions are on sale.
---
I have some, and some Mercenaries
---
Two minutes after re-installing. Got to loot one bunker. https://imgur.com/a/IVh6ESu
---
I'm pretty sure your special stats still count - my level 100+ seems to sprint a lot longer than my level 5, and can take a couple extra hits too
---
does the  Vault 51 Jumpsuit work like the 76 jumpsuit or can it go over armor?
---
I believe so yeah! I got the 2nd paint today.
---
ive found the scoped weapons are extremely op. theres been occasions where ive 1v4'd and won because id peep out get a headshot and go back into cover.
---
if im more than 50 feet away i always snipe. gotten 6+ kills a game that way
---
that being said, im on pc so aiming is a bit easier with snipers.
---
AI, visually, etc,
---
Try dawngaurd style with a crossbow. Pretty fun.
---
Two so far. T-51b &amp; T-45 ;)
---
But I love trying to jump away from something only to stop dead in my tracks to eat a corpse instead
---
/s
---
We should just turn it into minecraft
---
No it is like a minute or so
---
If you enjoy the game then you shouldn’t worry about other people’s opinions. Just play the game and have fun. Most people have already made up their mind about what they think about Fallout 76. You won’t gain anything from trying to change their minds.
---
Unequip everything maybe and add it up slowly. Something is happening somewhere. I'd love 53 strength.
---
Thank you. Is it a deposit or a vein ?
---
ohhhh Nuclear Winter ... then I die.
---
Boom, this right here
---
Can't wait to be a raider...
---
Ofcourse, he fakes his accent because everyone on youtube fakes their accent.
---
I'm not a gamergater, even people that didn't cheat got punished and the cheating never got resolved.
---
I do comment in r/wow and no I don't play WoW anymore and they don't do the same.
---
Nah I just comment about things that are true. Just like I do now.
---
Get a haircut, shave and bath? You don't even know what I look like mate.
---
Yes it's worth it, no one has been banned for it and is unlikely to ever be banned for it. 
---
Most of us have each other on each other's friends lists, that way we can jump between servers easier. 
---
There's a global chat(all of the servers), a trade chat, a local area chat for typing to someone next to you (if they have the mod) 
---
It has about 4k unique downloads and over 11k total downloads and continues to grow as people hear about it. 
---
It's seriously a night and day difference when you can talk to people quickly and across the entire game, it makes coordination for events easy too.
---
Add me if you like, my username is microwavedregret :)
---
He meant that you can take pictures even with the photo album full *only* if you take it with the camera. Since there is no camera in vault 51 you can only take as many pics as you have space left, so it makes it a pain in the ass if you only have a few spots open having to go back and delete every time to take more.
---
Someones about to dig a hole in some muties ass...
---
Keep seeimg this reference in the best of places
---
C.A.M.P.
---
huh, and i thought i was just crazy, seeing the same thing, pc and xbox :/
---
hey! text works on pages now! yay.
---
Not normal at all. 
---
Which platform? Wifi?
---
It happens to me all the time with my 50 cal. I can see my character running but it's like I'm running into an invisible wall. Drives me nuts lmao
---
Yo, Jerseysghost is a stand up guy. His videos are always short and sweet and cover topics in a great way. Yall should check out his live streams from time to time. Glad to say that I've gotten the opportunity to squad up with this dude. He even let's me steal his kills.
---
Thought this was a joke, but then googled it...
---
Violent. I think of it as playing paintball with friends. I like to win, but having fun playing is more important.
---
PS4. WiFi is fast and consistent and I can play other games online with no problems.
---
And Wooby!
---
Wait whats the gift emote? I been trying to get new peoples attention
---
Just don’t die
---
First day I was playing I saw it after I respawned. Shot at it and it disappeared. Scared me for sure
---
I have been picking up a crap ton of legendary items. Huh
---
This is true three back to back nuclear winter wins in a row last night with the squad. Here's to many more brother 🍻
---
I think down on the Dpad should do a ping rather then open the emote wheel
---
You’re a saint. Needed this, very badly.
---
LMAO! The way people talk about Fallout76 would make you think that Todd has personally murdered their families or something.
---
You good sir have made my day.
---
My username is microwavedregret, add me if you like :)
---
I'm having a lot of fun with the free trial. Few bugs, some I recognize from Fallout 4.
---
The menus are a god damn disaster though. What drunken lunatic came up with it?
---
My only other real complaint is the food spoilage system. It's a survival game, let us cook survival food that lasts longer than 5 minutes in my pack, like jerky.
---
Thats what Im working on for my secondary character. Heres hoping that when bows come out they use the rifle perk cards too.
---
Cannot wait to try this.. took a break from 76 the last month or so, and this might be what I needed to get back on it too haha.
---
You can go to the complete opposite side of the vault and the instrument sounds still play like you're standing right next to them for some reason
---
i don't know how to use your spreadsheet... i hit + but it doesn't expand/open up for me to see the test and the answers... i only see the basic categories.
---
Basically... brown bags = goodies.
---
Always. Check. The. Brown. Bag. 
---
Also, suitcases in/outside of train stations, people (myself included) will *transfer* items into suitcases instead of just dropping them. 
---
Some people’s trash is another persons treasure.
---
 Wiped out Helvitia with Explosives but the newbies in the area just ran. Dropped a nice bag anyway. Did the emote but I don't think they trust me.
---
 Was just trying to get the 4 newbies in the area to come over. ;)
---
Which one???
---
CD keys, got my copy for £6.99 on special offer, think they might be charging around £11.99 for it at the moment, haven't checked though :)
---
*Nuke
---
Survivalist is a 2 piece, stalker is a 3 piece.
---
Try it then you'll see
---
Definitely not normal.  How long has it been since you restarted your router?
---
Add me @BaconWarrior
---
yup.. they borked it with the last update to the leaderboard and everyone is playing Winter for likely the rest of the week..
---
but its still in beta yeah..
---
Save the doc to your drive then download it to your device through Google drive and open it in sheets.  And it should work.
---
Wait, combat or technical?
---
Im glad that it’s not only me. Hopefully they fix this soon.
---

Sorry about the rudeish sounding caption.
---
Edit: my strength is now at 55?
---
If you're into PVP just stick to NW. PVP in Survival blows with how horribly unbalanced legendary weapons and armor make things.
---
Mind showing me that statement? I believe you but I can’t find it.
---
Perhaps.
---
Give it a whirl and see how it works.
---
Suggest firing 4-5 shot bursts, not just holding the fire button down. (The muzzle climbs too much, and you'll waste a lot of ammo if you are holding the fire button while trying to adjust aim.)
---
(it'll Also be good for something like faschnacht, where someone usually oneshot the sloth before anyone else can get there.  Almost guarantees you'll get enough hits in to be able to loot.)
---
Yeah you can make blueprints in adventure to use in NW.
---
I just like seeing my assaultron helmet open to expose my face. So I feel ya.
---
Downvoted for pointing out facts. lol
---
XP is rewarded for lots of stuff, including placement, time alive, downs, kills, heals and ai kills. Even if you're crap, survive long enough and heal teammates, and you'll still progress.
---

---
i am trying it out and having a blast. i mean its free to try so u got nothing to really lose
---
I was in Grafton yesterday and there is a random spot near the mayor where my guy will just randomly drop a ton of health and die. Had it happen almost twice (second time I noticed health dropping, took two steps backward and stopped taking damage). 
---
Idk if its a visual bug and there was supposed to be a fire there or something, but it was pretty annoying.
---
why downvote this?
---
Huh. I just installed it this morning got to level 6-7 though I did disconnect once during play this morning. 
---
I've read of people rebuilding the PS4's database, maybe worth a shot. A lot of people are quick to blame Wifi but if you've got a solid connection and others work fine I see no reason to suspect it. If its easy to hard wire it in it may be worth it to fully rule it out.
---
I want to come find you just because of your phishy gamertag.
---
Hot take, but if you want the fluidity of those other BR games.... Go play those games.
---
I like the fact that combat isn't just constant sprinting bunnyhop gunners. Stamina limiting plays into that.
---
Just make it like insanely high then so its basically unlimited
---
Not beyond yonks of XP to progress ranks.
---
Yesterday. I can play other games online without issues. I’m getting 44 Mbps down and 2.5 up, which is normal. I guess I understand now why there’s been so much backlash against this game.
---
That could work
---
Try farming Mr Gutsy robots, they can get you a decent amount if you can handle them, and free.
---
Not normal, but with the free trial I expected servers to take a hit
---
I got a disk with my PS4 copy but there was maybe 250MB on it. Had to download the full game as a patch I believe. This was at launch though.
---
Oh didn’t know that thanks
---
Why even ask the question? No one knows you on here, so we don’t know what you like. Just try it, it’s free.

I like playing the roll of "Wasteland Traveling Doctor"

I usually wait by Vault 76 to give out healing salves, disease cures, and government supply tapes
---
Look out for me and my camp near Cranberry Bog
---
I'm guessing you'll be able to once it's 'officially' out. This is just the 'sneak peek', not the actual launch.
---
It's great, I will consider them employees in my bar. They better be able to man things, like emptying my water purifiers when they get filled up and stuff. Also, man the bar and repair walls and stuff. Get to work, lazy NPCs.
---
They get that big from nobody fishing them. There's a very deep lake here in PA where fishing is forbidden by federal law and I've seen people catch some unnaturally massive fish from there. Fish that would be a state record if they were caught somewhere legal to fish.
---
You deserve it bro. Keep up all the great work.
---
Reminds me of the first time I tried BF3’s rush mode on Metro. Never even played a BF game beforehand and I couldn’t get 50 meters out of the spawn zone. I don’t know why I kept trying...
---
Fast forward an unbelievable number of hours (full of trial and error) later and my top weapon was the crossbow with 10,000+ kills in a game full of tanks and automatic weapons.
---
That. Was. Glorious.
---
Let's do it again tonight.  :)
---
I just saw this ! Awesome.
---
I used [this one.](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/221)
---
Unfortunate. Thanks!
---
Supply and demand!
---
I'm just coming back after a hundred hours at launch. I need to figure out how to get myself one of these newfangled vending machines so I can set up a shop in Flatwoods for these greenhorns!
---
We did it AGAIN too, TWICE.  It’s my favorite!
---
I usually like Jim’s stuff but presenting his opinion on something as fact (I didn’t like the game so it’s bad) is ridiculous. Having issues with VATS because you didn’t spec into it and saying it doesn’t work is ridiculous. Bethesda’s non-game-related mess-ups received well deserved criticism but it doesn’t affect the quality of the game if some cheap bastards mishandled the rum bottles or their website didn’t work right for support tickets and did an oopsie with personal data. Saying he tried it again and only found escort missions is simply incorrect - literally play the main quest, it’ll be in your quest log. Why go for escort events if you don’t like them?
---
Such a weird video. Usually he makes good points with actual evidence but in this case he’s doing it for the memes I think.
---
Glad you like it! Enjoy early game and take your time, it’s the best part!
---
This aged well
---
Would make sense for rifle perks. Also still waiting on a fishing rod that lobs dynomite....
---
Man they should drop a red marker on everyone's map when a flare gets shot.  Put it on cool down, so it cant be spammed.  Make it a temporary fast travel beacon.  Flare guns should be useful.
---
Faceplant into ROKK!
---
Nah nobody heard it but they will if it stays like this lol.
---
I can help you out if you’d like! I’ll be home in about an hour or so, and I’ve got plenty of aid and ammo you could have.  :)  My PSN is radiationdaddy
---
Same here. If I'm doing PvP in Survival I usually setup a VATS kill and move on. The adrenaline dump in NW causes my left hand to shake a lot and I can't even press the control stick to move.
---
I've been grinding NW more to get used to the adrenaline again and the shakes are mostly gone now lol
---
Haha in the golf club where the ghouls are sleeping. The amount of times I've done this and died, only to return to having my bag looted by other players.
---
You could... But does a higher level character really want purified water and diluted radaway?
---
Nah it treats the NW camp as a workshop, so your actual camp doesnt get moved
---
Activision doesnt do the same? Man you are a deluded feller. People who bought duped items got banned. Totally sucks for them but happens a lot. 
---
One time a GM accidentally gave a player Martin Thunder in Wrath. He used it to clear Ulduar right after release and him and a chunk of his guild got banned, because of Blizzard. Later that same expac a guild used engi bombs to rebuild the Lich Kings platform in ICC. Suspended temp and achievements removed. That one is real ugly considering they got a slap on the wrist for attempting to cheat the world first race because they were big and popular. The other guy was a nobody so banned. 
---
My point is companies are motherfuckers and it's all a matter of how much it matters. And how relevant it is. The reason you dont hear about those wow issues is because it now rightfully gets teabagged a lot in general, not specific. But it doesnt stop people from playing. 
---
Although I have really enjoyed watching you try so hard. Made a boring work day fun. As it stands you have about 25 min of relevance left. So ise it wisely
---
Free wood HYPERS
---
Directly left when you spawn in at the golf course over the wall
---
Somebody set us up the bomb.
---
Yes. Stop playing now.
---
Combat overhaul. More pve content coming soon
---
Why I won't bother ever getting it. I already have enough issues with backpacks in division2.
---
There is a swimming pool next to the golf club, it's behind a wall next to the side entrance.
---
\+2INT +2AGL -5CHR
---
Ah ic. Well as long as they dont mark my map bc another settlement needs my help i’ll be fine lol.
---
I can help later this afternoon or anytime on the weekend. I always enjoy helping anyone who needs it. PSN is MoonlightCowboy
---
Thanks! I have been waving back and expecting something to happen, lol
---
Its next to the clubhouse. If you spawn at the clubhouse, turn left and you should see a white wall. It is behind that wall, go through the archway there and that is the pool.
---
Free for the week and if you purchase there is a discount as well. Try it out and see.
---
I too sent you an invite
---
great thank you!
---
What about rewards for winning some games?
---
Yeah, but I think it would make a lot of sense if they had some sort of relationship with you whether they're just your friend, roommate, or love interest. Increases the immersion.
---
Marsupial is disabled in Nw, you can only get: Speed demon, chameleon, twisted muscles, talons, electrically grounded and unstable isotope. Realistically only speed demon and chameleon are good out of those
---
Can't ya jus trade and reduce items to 0 caps?
---
I play melee combat in 3rd person
---
If you're a general Fallout fan, I think you'll like it.  I've put in 500 hours, so it's been a good buy for me.
---
If you shoot you lose the invis from chameleon in this mode
---
Like I've said in every other post asking this question.
---
That's like asking if you will like pizza.
---
Some think it's awesome.
---
Some think it's trash.
---
Ultimately it's up to what you like.
---
Read the other posts asking this same question. Watch recent YouTube vids and make a decision based on what you like or don't like.
---
No one can answer this question for anyone.
---
If it’s still the same way, I needed the disk to start my download, even though there was minimal data on it. I had to download a fairly large patch on the day of launch and still have to have my disk in when playing. It’s kind of annoying but not a huge deal.
---
thank you
---
YouTube is just as much of a vacuum as Reddit is. Cant act like negative views of the game aren't meant with hostility on here, even when supported by evidence.
---
I don't like that some people have all these perks and I don't. They say they want it to be an even playing field but it's not
---
Keep shifting those goalposts man. Blizzard might be owned by Activision but Activision doesn't develop the game.
---
I know about those WoW issues mate don't worry.
---
Don't cut yourself on that edge.
---
I’m on Xbox, do you think it would be worth it to buy in on PC as well to play with a friend who doesn’t have Xbox?
---
Yes!  That would be cool
---
Ah, my old favorite area of the map. I worshipped my gods here. I should return and claim my home.
---
Yeah, this was already the case back on Monday. Complete 180, almost instantly
---
Christ
---
Ich habe auch Kupfer für dich ;)
---
Do you not know how years work?
---
A - we're six months from launch, not a year.   
---
B - The bugs were largely cleaned up by January. Since then there's been bunches of new content.       
---
C - There's no ongoing costs and expansion packs are free, so why are you having to buy it again?
---
I got “frog legs” last night which is a 9 cost card and was so confused because I thought the max point allotment was 7.
---
Now I have to wait till I get home tonight to try this ridiculous card 🤦🏻‍♀️
---
anyone got pics of the skeleton icons?
---
level 4 is only an icon; find it through your icons atomic page

You get an exclusive stash you can use at your Adventure CAMPS at level 5.
---
So true and much needed! I don't wear my favorite jumpsuit anymore, because I can't read, what stands on its back. 
---
On the other hand, this forced me to wear an alternative and my longshore outfit with the backpack plus possum hat looks dope.
---
There's a HELP emote which is about the best option right now unless you use area chat. I keep area chat on PTT so it's just there when I need to say something.
---
If I see a Preston Garvy clone I'm killing him..    
---
Actually that's half the reason I plan to side with raiders, no settlements to defend, just raid
---
Fixed this by going into adventure mode, changing some of my perks around, then going back into NW.
---
Only figured this out because a friend said he lost the ability to move in NW until he changed his perks around in adventure mode.
---
I'm pretty sure it'd be worth it for them to add it, but your right that it's time consuming.
---
Connectivity is not that much about throughput, and more about packet loss and latency (though *really* slow speeds can cause issues).  It's probably hard to test those thins on console, but tracert/ping on PC to the server IP would tell you a lot.  If there's something like that on PS4, check those.
---
I mean it's only $17 for a physical copy(which is a download code) on Amazon. I don't know if you're progress transfers though.
---
If it didn't have the fridge, I wouldn't bother, as well
---
We cant tell u what u like
---
Well my Gun Fu Perk thats active doesn't work at all. Id rather have your bug of it switching automatically than me having to keep VATSing every enemy
---
Some people won’t know how to trade yet either lol, although that would be a good way to learn, there are also rumored exploits involving the trade menu.
---
L10 .... you should probably be in the Forest (green area on the western side of the map.) and toxic valley (north near the alligator picture.
---
If you were seeing Mole Miners, you were in either the ash heap (bottom of the map) or savage divide (center section) ....The divide is an extremely dangerous place for L10s...
---
I wasn't aware it was free. I figured it was being charged for. I stand corrected. So is the game any good?
---
This is why you don't listen to reddit or YouTube.
---
The best thing to do is to mute morons talking and watch uninterupted gameplay
---
Or find a streamer who streams with minimal talking or is completely neutral in commentary.
---
Personally I like Oxhorn, it isn't really good in terms of skill but basically all he cares about is lore. So watching his videos he basically just comments on what he just read or sees in terms of lore. Since you are enjoying the game I wouldn't watch what he has though since it's all spoilery.
---
I've dropped about 9 of them and not 1 fired on me or a team mate. Only enemies.
---
If you see a guy looking for property tell your cult to look the other way, I don't want to be Cthulu's offering
---
Yes you would. Digital and physical are separate clients so you’d need to redownload the entire game.
---
Is it on sale?
---
I've farmed a bit since the patch, and pretty easily get my 150 scrip worth of (mostly) junk without too much trouble.
---
It's *very* random though, 1 run can net you 0 items, and the next one you're encumbered before you get halfway through.  Keep at it.
---
Yeah i think it’s ok, it just kinda unexpected for me, so i was surprised
---
Are you overloaded?
---
What are the goal posts? The games fun. Has a story. You are mad it was broken having never played it.
---
You also seem to think Activision doesnt have a hand in blizzard which is weird considering you dont seem actually stupid just selective.
---
Thanks! I rely on Gun Fu. Without it, VATS can be a bit clunky!
---
~~Define BS?~~  
---
Just read...    
---
Ok, so I'm one of the few traders on Marker76 that won't do bid wars, holds items for people etc, but the majority want the 15 minute fast caps trade.    
---
I'm sorry, it sucks, but 9/10 trades will be like that.
---
Quickest way to get a precise mod or plan is going to a TrainStation Vendor; otherwise, you get them through your typical world spawn, treasure maps, supply crates, or hopping around player vendors
---
I havent had this happen, but I do see people who swear they got some crazy offer by message in order to drive up the price. Once you say no, Minutes later they come with “hey that guy fell through”
---
Im sure everyones not like that on there
---
I mean all someone had to do is run their reticle over you and youre spotted. Which most would do anyways to make sure it isnt alive. Hacking terminals for enemy reveal. Theres so much that can get you caught.
---
The game is great.
---
The bugs are not.
---
I really enjoy the game. The exploration. The quests.
---
What I hate about it is:
---
CAMP:
---
1.cannot build stuff because it says it's floating/overlapping. Which it doesn't because there are walls on all sides. On the other hand I can build acutal floating floors which are connect by one wall.
---
2. Storage Budget is a bit weird if you don't get it that stored items use budget.
---
AMMO: cannot scrap, cannot sell.
---
CTD occasionally when clicking on items in inventory.
---
I can live with all the other rocks Bethesda throws in our way. The world is huge. With all hand placed sites. Superb quests. I can sing along all radio songs.
---
If you go to a river, you can see there are swimming fish. Bonus if you login next to river, fish spawn before water
---
pink with sprinkles
---
I've seen more enemy's under its control than i have the actual monster. By the time I realize it's around, it's gone. Only ever killed 2
---
The fallout 76 review is where I unsubbed.
---
It was insane.
---
They sat there shooting an afk guy for like 5 minutes then went "guess it's real hard to kill people that don't want to fight"  meanwhile they were all worried about being killed by other players.
---
He has gone way downhill since delrith has been in any video since he basically blurts out his overly negative about everything and Joe just rides his dick about it.
---
It's a lot more fun than I expected. I thought I'd get bored "just exploring" but I was wrong. Exploring and digging deep is so rewarding. I'm sitting at level 13 and overwhelmed with stuff to do.
---
I had my bluetooth on my xbox headset, so I was watching a show while playing.  Heard a noise that didn't sync with the show and there it was.  Barely had time to move the reticle to see a name and level.
---
THANK YOU ! ! !
---
I will look into this. As a long time Fallout fan (still replay Fallout 1 a lot) I am stunned! If they re-release any of the games with this update I will drop cash in a second for them.
---
No it isn't i just got to 25. Its the striped one at 29
---
Two?!  What do they drop?
---
I've picked up the trial and will be picking up a copy tomorrow. A lot better than I thought it would be.
---
I think they removed it because they needed the material to make the canvas bags. :)

Old post, so I'm not 100% sure how much has changed, but that's where I go to look for ini file changes.
---
Imagine if they could be your vendor
---
You can report them to the mods...
---
It's been so long that I forgot, I know it wasn't anything good
---
If you have anxiety/stress from a game that you can't cope, then maybe you shouldn't play it.
---
 The game only lacks in end-game content right now. Its an amazing experience to learn and grow. Up until youve killed the final boss 100's of times, grinding for loot that seems impossible to drop and pvp'ing the same people with broken balance. NW has been a saving grace for us end-game players. Something to grind for while we wait for more content. Its honestly a blessing.
---
Man what a turd that guy is. He said 24k and should have stuck to it. Thats just bad business.
---
On the page where you buy the atoms as a package special
---
It was never in the atom shop. It's a bonus for buying the new E3 1500 atom pack for like $10.
---
Known issue, Bethesda has Acknowledged and are working on a fix
---
I don't think that is really true.
---
I think most people did like it but bandwagon hate drowned out those voices.
---
Every thread talking about the game had people talking about enjoying it but they had like -50 downvotes.
---
Well, that is no surprise for PC with this game engine and most propably a non-existent cheat detection.
---
There is even someone streaming right now with activated cheats.
---
This guy:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taa4emXW5aE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taa4emXW5aE)

As his AP point are flickering/resetting all the time this seems to be client based. So he has infinite AP points. And aimbot of course
---
Ah I see, thanks for the info.
---
Easy to get engrossed reading the terminals and notes and listening to the gorgeous background music and even the automated “Appalachia radio”. 
---
Welcome to West Virginia!
---
I work at landscaping company and we have an enormous koi fish pond surrounding the facility. About 8 years ago we put a yellow cat in it. Last time we weighed him he was 113 pounds. 
---
If a fish has room, food, and nothing to kill it, of course they're gonna get big.
---
The worry here is plaers spawn under camp objects, npcs will too
---
You may wanna look for some discords. Or you could start the discord yourself if you don't find anything and you could be the Grand Priest or whatever the high ranking person is lol.
---
I got one a few days before the patch! 😭
---
Yeah mine was at the rusty pick by the ash heap. Think has something to do with scorchbeasts
---
In my opinion, they should of just made survival mode like Warmode in WoW, PVP server with extra rewards for playing with the risk of being ganked
---
The leaderboard and scoring system is really blah, just make it a PVP server.
---
Genius way to get more people to buy the game and play adventure mode and for Bethesda to make more money on the atomic shop.  It is what will save the game and keep them putting money into it.  You can do battle royale with a brand spanking new character, but you only have 7 special points.  The only way to get more is to level up your character up to the max of 50 special points.  A lot of these new customers will choose to do this in adventure mode, which makes for a funner community, but may also choose to do it in battle royale.  Some of the perks cost up to 9, that I've seen so far, special points in one given stat.  Only way to use that card is to develop a character that has at least 9 points in say charisma, int, etc.  whatever the perk card is.  The fact that the only outfits and skins you can use have to have come from the atomic shop is another way they'll make money.  I love the adventure mode, but this new mode has me excited to level up and find all the new perks.  As said by another person, this has no effect whatsoever on adventure or survival mode that i can see.
---
Still it is cool to see and KILL something from one of those strange holotapes.
---
Well we know that already.
---
People hated on the game because it was online going as far as to make shit up.
---
Reviewers and Youtubers are also influenced by perception of the internet in general, you as a YouTuber   could not give the  game a 6 or 7 or higher or you would be called a shill.
---
Oxhorn had a video talking about his opinions of the game around time of beta and his comment section was basically people screaming that he was lying for some unknown reason.
---
That’s unfortunate, I’ve had decent luck but I’ve only done a few trades. Honestly though with the new in game vendors I’ve gotten away from the market a bit. The community is usually pretty good, but I guess those legacy items can bring out the turds. Sorry for your bad experience, hope things get better!
---
Not normal
---
Sasquatch at level 10 lol. You had no chance.
---
lol 24k
---
"WoW does the same" becomes "Activision does it too"
---
I have played it that's the funny part, bought it for 4 euros. Aren't you excited for the incredibly futuristic DLC that adds NPC's!? That's some next gen shit!
---
Oh they have a hand in their affairs, never said they didn't but they have their own dev teams.
---
My cold heart just melts when I see people defend something that is objectively bad. It's adorable.
---
Okay absolutely. Just add me when you get home and I'll add you now so it's already sent and join me when you get in.
---
Wifi is always substandard and results in more disconnects, once your ping gets high enough you start having more issues.   
---
Reboot your router and service provider devices, clear the game cache (I've seen people report this helped).
---
Sometimes the game doesn't load in completely when you fast travel.  The enemies seem to load in first and they hit you before you see them. Next time try crouching for a minute (sneak) and let the area load in.
---
I have shitty internet and I noticed it happens to me quite a bit at whitesprings too.
---
I've looked at every vendor, the all sell the mods for the metal and robot armor but not the actual piece itself
---
Bro red deads fishing is great but has such a narrow scope to it. I'd actually fish alot more in it if I could buy a boat and store large catches on it rather than only being able to carry one at a time.
---
Yep. It's entirely possible to be a character when doing reviews and still be unbiased, but if you have the gall to call yourself a reviewer, you need to adhere to standards. Angry Joe has none.  He does whatever it takes per video to get the most views, and him pretending to be a Fallout superfan while presenting a video that way he did was just underhanded at best.
---
All games have pros and cons. You can't just pretend a game is all cons and then claim to be a reviewer, because you're not legitimately reviewing at that point.
---
To this day when I tell people I play Fallout 76 people still reference Angry Joe or drum up some "How can you play that game?" and then list a bunch of shit wrong with that game that isn't actually a problem, but they heard it somewhere in a "review".
---
Thank you lol. I'll add you.
---
PvP is garbage in comparison to the gameplay and fun factor of Nuclear Winter IMO.
---
Nope that’s in my stash. What’s weird is it weighed .10 when I was carrying it... and I have ammo weight reduction.
---
You make it sound like i am scamming people.. 3 caps for purified water seems ok for people who just got out, have no gear or means to get purified water on their own.
---
Im only lvl 20 myself, its not like im ripping on the newbies, just providing some aid for those that seek it and helping myself get a few extra caps. I could just sell my water to a vendor for 2 caps,.. 1 cap for storage and logistics seems fair + raider taxes coming soon.
---
If you figure out which perk is causing it let us know!
---
I was looking for the option in the wrong ini file, and the wrong location. I feel so dumb. Thanks anyway.
---
You also have unlimited materials in NW.
---
So much this
---
I really feel there should be a rule of conduct.  Not only for the buyer screwing over the seller, but the other way around.  There is no consequences for bad practices.  They should really add -karma to people so we know who to avoid.
---
Bethesda website says it's just here for a sneak peek. W/E that means
---
Just smack em and loot down at your feet.
---
Usually works for the randies
---
I didn't mean it like that. Perhaps I am new AND I AM stupid.
---
Nail - head
---
Just move slower with your squad. I like it, requires actual teamwork
---
Yes I hope this gets traction, I need this. It keeps clipping through my field scribe outfits backpack.
---
In the beta it all carried over so I’d say theyd carry the trial over too
---
Yeah me and team have dropped dozens of them and that has never ever happened to us.
---
Not discounting there might be hackers but there is a challenge to win naked and a perk card to run faster.
---
There is one, but it's loosely enforced and it's mainly about unrelated comments and bait and switch stuff, price gouging is considered "fair"
---
Yeah, but that's not the only reason anyone will replay Fallout 4. Personally, I loved playing it as a survival-base building game. I didn't really do any of the quests, just roaming around, scavenging stuff, and taking it back home. I interacted with NPCs, sure, but mostly as just vendors to sell and buy stuff from. To say that I had a lesser experience because the NPCs were largely irrelevant in my playthroughs is ridiculous. Knowing that, I would say that Fallout 76's experience is just different rather than simply "worse" compared to prior games. It appeals to others in different ways.
---
corvega BP is pretty tight
---
I love the fact I've already gotten some down votes, people don't like the truth
---
Pushed back. No further update yet.
---
I am doing the same. I have God of war, red dead 2 and ac odyssey all stacked up to play byt the kicking factor was starting KH3 up, to me that's a polished game, hard to come back to this.
---
This is very nice advertisement. Very well written. 3/10.
---
Ah ok, I'm new myself but picked up on the bag thing early. The only problem is I tried to drop armour for a friend and it disappeared so we just traded.
---
Generally they don't do anything (in my experience) for something like this..
---
Guy was really ignorant and didn't pick up a level 5 two shot pump i was trying to give him(was hinting him for like 5 minutes). He really missed out and i just gave it to the next low level player.
---
Weeeeell... I think so. But it depends what you want. If you want a big open Bethesda world to explore and always thought their npcs were rubbish, then this game might be for you.     
---
I'm the sort of guy who always thought the npcs in 3/4 were awful. People act like previous fallout games were all about the npcs, but they were certainly no Mass Effect/New Vegas.   
---
(Mind you, now we know npcs are coming to 76 soon it might become more fallouty. Who knows.)
---
76 keeps all the exploration and digging up stories, but without anyone insisting you should give a rats arse about where your dad went or some git in a cowboy hat demanding that you check in on a settlement for the fiftieth time.
---
This was like this at launch? Why would you wait so long?
---
Yup, sucks and generally I won't buy from them
---
How many pictures in NW? Seems counterproductive out there. Don't shoot I'm taking pictures of you killing me! ~~
---
Edit: Nevermind, think it's just 10 pictures
---
Are you running strange in numbers or solar powered? Or is someone sharing them?
---
Edit: I still think it's broken, but they could be adding some.
---
I have it but still doesn’t look right with my sparkles and  high heels.
---
This is not the 1st time.  Here is another i saved.
---

---
lol that is great
---
Dude was being an ass lol
---
Welp thats sad.. hope itll be a feature sometime soon..
---
I had a little difficulty trading at first, until me and a friend tried it out to get the hang of it. I mean, most of the buttons are laid out across the bottom, but it still took some getting used to.
---
Anytime that happens I publically shame them. Bad business practice.
---
Could be the FOV. Idk what it is be default, but I know having an FOV that’s too narrow or too wide can cause nausea.
---
Actually,  I would suggest scrapping weapons at first to learn the mods. Plus, with the Scrapper perk, scrapping guns is a good source of steel which always seems to be in short supply when crafting a lot of ammo.
---
I’d love an “enemy sighted” emote or something. Using the Follow Me or Help emote just kinda causes confusion so far, like what if I just want to let my teammates know there’s an enemy nearby without them rushing to my aid and getting themselves capped?
---
I know mics are better for that but those living with others will know using your headset to chat late at night isn’t always welcomed kindly by housemates, plus not everyone has a mic.
---
Awesome thanks
---
I crafted the 51 Jumpsuit in Adventure mode just to find this out lol, it works like the 76 jumpsuit. It's underarmor and you can mod it the same as the other jumpsuits, I had just enough Colbalt Flux to make a shielded version, I wanted to make more to throw in the vending machines for others who haven't had a crack at NW but realised it has the Atom Shop symbol next to it so it's unable to be given to other players :(
---
Hell yea its a great game I log on once a day usually. That would be amazing if they added some maps from previous games! One can only hope.
---
Atoms are for the Atomic Shop only
---
Caps are for Adventure/Survival Mode
---
What jumpsuit is that?  Caddy from the Whitespring?
---
Events are great at low levels. I second this for sure!
---
Burned books are available to weigh down hapless newbs so they are easier to pick off from the herd.   
---
Kidding. They are annoyingly pointless, so far.
---
Just to buy stuff cosmetics or repair kits
---
Have reloaded and so far seems ok. I don't get how my armour would break so quickly though as i had just repaired it. This wasn't rake damage this was holy shit one hit nearly killed me damage.
---
Agreed on price gouging.  This is business.  This would more likely fall under bait and switch.
---
I agree with you. Sometimes things don’t have to exists in lore for them to exists in the game.
---
Sometimes reminds me of Tim Russ.
---
That isn't normal, but since theres so many people on it for the free trail, the servers are probably stained. I know normally an entirely full server can lag like hell, and sometimes disconnect you
---
I used wow because it's sort of blizzard's biggest example. Diablo 3 at release, diablo immortal, the 3 copies of starcraft 2, overwatch and it providing people with the best way to casino cash in on people. So I guess Activision are jerks but blizzard is morally bankrupt right? 
---
And considering it's a fallout game it delivers that. Exactly that in fact. Your little chode gets perky when you can be an unhappy person though. I get it. I too struggle with my happiness level but usually try not to be such a sad sack about it like you. Persecution complex is a stinky cologne. Like I said, shower, shave haircut. Your friends will thank you. 
---
And if you want a good fallout video watch Jim sterling's. He rips it apart but is actually entertaining about it, added bonus he is actually British. He also has some good ones about blizzard for your next crusade against the immorality of games publishers.
---
Edit: we are out of time though, you have fun, smile more, I like it when you smile.
---
No had just dropped my stuff off
---
Wow, Thanks!
---
I'm with you 100%, but at least we have the bare minimum. It is pretty crappy, since some people can't physically use a mic, and they have no true easy way to communicate in game.
---
Haven't noticed it really.  All my deals have gone pretty smooth except for when I kept jumping instead of entering the trade menu.  I just dropped the fusion cores and said they were free, not the buyer's fault.  Also, the behavior in your thread wouldn't have really bugged me too much.  I already have a maximum price in mind when bidding and the item doesn't belong to me until the trade is made.  So the seller can change his mind, take higher bids or whatever.  Its virtual stuff in a video game, not worth stressing on ;-)
---
So it was my quest step, not sure if you can get quests that are for higher levels. But the area started with an M I think, it was by an abandoned mine. Even in Morgantown I was seeing level 58 blue glowing things that kept chasing me down and killing me.
---
No wonder there is so much trash lying around in the wastelend.
---
Did Uranium Fever on Xbox yesterday and got 3 legendaries, I’ve been getting them as normal.
---
Fishing is amazing in rdr2
---
Ah i had just led a scorchbeast into whitesprings resort so the sentrys could help me while i cowered in the corner and took the last shot haha
---
The emote hot wheel has an expand option. Can't remember which one it's under but if you haven't checked I'd try that. You could've just gotten a case of the Bethesdas though lol.
---
No, I'm sure you're needed in Brain Surgery.
---
If your  single teamed they should be able to build
---
Did you expand the trade tab?
---
I'm lvl 103.. Lvl 68 enemies rape me on a regular basis.
---
Anyone know what the minigun skin looks like?
---
Check the atom shop. You have to have them set active to show in game.
---
We would need to make more large lakes, and I have a good idea of how to do so. Here’s the story:
---
The amount of nuclear fallout in the atmosphere has drastically changed the weather patterns of Earth. As a result, a massive Cat-5 hurricane forms off the coast of Florida and moved all the way up the east coast, dumping a large amount of rain into West Virginia and the Midwest before losing power and disappearing over southern Ontario. This storm floods out Grafton lake and the surrounding area, and a few months later a super mutant accidentally detonates a mini nuke on Grafton Dam, pushing the Grafton Dam to its breaking point and collapsing it, sending a wave of water into Summersville Lake. Over a few decades, the once desolate lake grew into a thriving ecosystem with new exotic (and radioactive) fish species and of course mirelurks.
---
Only if they drop it and you store it yourself.
---
There was info that bethesda was planning to add camp containers that could be accessed by anyone but I don't know if they where rumors
---
This is going to sound terrible, but... uh, I kind of like the cover version better. Johnny Cash is a legend, but this new version has an energy that really resonates with me.
---
Imagine being so bad in br that you resort to hacking
---
All about play  style.   
---
I'm Level 375, and enjoy the game by not min-maxing..  
---
Don't use the sexy meta builds, don't use the massively OP bloodied/Unyielding/Nerd rage combos..    
---
Go for style and flair, honestly it's allot of fun.  
---
Personally run around in Raider PA using fun looking but underwhelming weapons and have a blast, I mean I could one shot everything at level 40, after that it was style points
---
Yeah. Sitting at the main menu, not in any mode, doesn't let me add friends to a team
---
Ok. One question.
---
Can you sum up your build in a word or two?
---
I did WS this morning unnuked 80% had legendarys a few were very decent....PC
---
Nope, just sneak preview. Not even beta yet
---
I had someone in a creepy getup drop a bag of cat meat and a doll for me... Then went around the corner and kept doing the "Follow me" emote.
---
Think I'll go back to being oblivious, that was a nice time in retrospect.
---
Also the chameleon mutation seems to be super common, jump in water or stand near toxic barrels to get it, then sit and watch the world burn.
---
I used this for hours. Interestingly it never triggered for me, not even once. I swapped it out due to it never even happening.
---
I know, this is not the 1st time.  People are becoming a little more bolder since there is no consequences. 
---
Nope, it’s a sneak peek until the 17th, release is this summer.
---
Yeah the one with the moneybag emote i dont seem to have i there and it really bothers me..
---
Should be free all the time ..
---
Don't use the "master race" language, man. I get it's something of a running joke, but the origins of the phrase ties into some dark shit and makes PC games look like elitists. It's bad for everybody.
---
Yep nothing there..
---
Those big mosquitoes can kill you. But deathclaws, no way.
---
Don’t go to YouTube for opinions. Hell, even Instagram is more civil than the cesspool that is YouTube comments.
---
there is a level 101 holotape at the vault door area &gt;.&gt;
---
Too bad I don't have any points to equip them
---
 The Mire is way overcrowded already. Take yer real estate scams elsewhere. ;(
---
Ohhh man... overseer Rank 10 and I did not know this... feel stupid but also glad it’s possible
---
Shit, guess I'm not moving my town any time soon
---
Q on pc.
---
I already have the order in and waiting to ship, thanks for the look out tho!
---
I mean what about a purse skin for the backpack? Some Micheal Kors in the Wastes
---
invest time in making an OP build.
---
complain the game is too easy.
---
or atleast, wiggle the stick and cancel the sitting / animation
---
reneging or renegotiating and accepted deal is supposed to be a bannable offense.  I have really only had a few issues with newer traders.
---
Part of a quest. Scortchbeast towers.
---
That would be sweet. 😍😍😍
---
Yeah winning couts as complete match, best way without winning is just expectating when there is 2-3 teams left if your that far in and you die at the same time get some water or eat something look at your phone while you wait...
---
Take 20 delete. Repeat.
---
Which is why I'd prefer to not be hindered for 2-3 mins between matches just so some people could play the holotapes.
---
'friends play for 25 mins when you die at the start'  I don't think that's even possible. The wall moves too often for any session to last that long.
---
Have to go into photo mode, but you can snap multiple pictures at once - just spam the key to capture.
---
I'm here for you buddy
---
I've done maybe 8 matches, and I'm only at level 3. I realised I don't have too much skill without all my mutations and perks lol so I have to totally refine my play style, I'm normally a meele build which is reeeeally not a good choice for BR :/ The rewards (excluding perk cards) carry over to Adventure mode but I've noticed when I've relogged into Adventure that the XP and Caps earned for Adventure mode in BR aren't carrying over, not sure if that's a bug or whether they've turned that off for the Beta.
---
And diablo 3 got fixed. Pretty fast too. How is Fallout 76 is and will always be a mess.
---
They're called expansion packs.
---
Overwatch had cosmetics in lootboxes. Perfectly fine and can be ignored completely and you get them for free regularly.
---
It doesn't deliver a Fallout game. It delivers Fallout 4 stripped from features and riddled with bugs.
---
Ew Jim Sterling. Explains alot.
---
I love being right all the time.
---
I got like 300+ armor and a 250 dmg or more dont really remember (played too much of nuclear winter to remember lol..) deathclaw gauntlet with an extra claw :) Only melee and defence i guess..
---
Well. Its like ebay it looks like. If he really did get better offers he can reject the agreement with u but it could also be a lie to milk more out of u
---
A mountable fish would be nice addition to my camp
---
There is if you get tricentennial I believe. My friend got in physically while I got in digitally and he says that he got a poster of the Cranberry Bog.
---
When you first get there by fast travel or logging in. Wait for everything to load or the invisible enemies will get you. Been there. Run and jump onto a golf cart roof to escape it.
---
If it makes you feel better, ZAX was lying to the Vault Dwellers to make them fight.
---
&gt;I really appreciate the overall friendly spirit that most of you
---
We're all still friendly, it's just that ZAX is telling me all the bad stuff you've been saying behind my back and I don't appreciate that.
---
Meh, honestly not having NPCs in 76 was great till I started getting later into the game. Rather than being the protagonist, you played witness and I think it made it alot better.
---
It's been full all week with new players... But ya the leader board sucks.. I just jump off of a tall cliff the run back and grab my stuff so ppl are not hunting me.
---
Invest time ? I just pick up everything that is good i dont really go and trade for OP stuff or grind that much..
---
We need a huge radio revamp, and that includes a fohckin DJ!!!!
---
I would argue.. that the 17th is the day to buy it...
---
Ill go check
---
Unless its different for everyone you at level 1 you get the vault suit for vault 51 and at level 2 you get vault 51(whatever the flip that means) at 3 you get a perk pack. Thats as far as ive gotten.
---
Edit:im refering only to Nuclear Winter.
---
Was just curious. 
---
I do "character builds"... as opposed to "game mechanics" builds. I find it adds a great deal of difficulty to the game, and keeps it fun.
---
If books arent worth like 1cloth or 2 wood or some shit then i never made it out of kindergarten
---
Bad week for vending? This is a great time to scam new players of 500 caps for an alien blaster!
---
One one hand I definitely get the feeling - I would love to know it all now - but there needs to be incentives for people to play besides just the fun of each match, or else it would get too boring too quickly. Lore is a creative way to hook people into playing!
---
I'd agree in most cases, but I find it's much harder to use the 10mm SMG in third person. The camera goes weird with the high recoil
---
others are gonna spoil it for you anyways
---
Agree, I play Fortnite with my family and even with mics pinging is still really helpful! Found this gun... here! *noise alert and visual marker*
---
That area is great for farming weapons and stuff to sell to make your 1400 caps daily. There's probably going to be high levels over there most of the time doing that, running Uranium Fever, or just getting together to trade. BM has all the workshop benches and is just busy. The area is not level locked like things in the Forest and Toxic Valley.
---
bruh, im lvl 25 and suck at the game
---
As long as they are on your team they can build and place things. But cannot remove them.
---
Really?   
---
A good chunk of mine have been like that, usually once in game, extra 500 caps here, etc etc
---
u/stealthymoth81
---
"Defend this raider camp from settlers"
---
I have noticed a very strange bug that makes the SMG aim somewhere far to the right with third person.
---
Yea it’s pretty annoying to keep hitting the vats button lol
---
Just wanted to mention that there is one more useful gun, the minigun. Had one drop last night, I'm rank 10 and this is the only time I've seen it drop but it was wrecking anyone I fought with it before I died trying to save my friend and the game bugged out trying to make me exit power armor, freezing, and letting me die in the storm.
---
Nah. I couldn't do that! I'd feel bad.
---
They have overstock of the actual product that they need to get rid of. The digital codes don't really have that problem.
---
that's weird. I come up with yellow bars when something goes wrong with resolution lul
---
Flatwoods vendors are getting a lot of customers.
---
Meanwhile, Mire and Cranberry vendors are on suicide watch.
---
Yeah I was kind of surprised we couldn't save presets like in 4. I had to do it the long way and screenshot all my settings from my main, so my alt could look mostly the same.
---
Somehow I doubt Bethesda would hire somebody with the name "Xanax" to advertise their game.
---
The content is locked behind playing.   
---
A data miner pulled out most the content, you can find it somewhere out there
---
It's still hard for some people. Eventually, everyone's gonna get gud at this game and that's when bethesda's gonna make their move... hopefully
---
Nothing there.
---
Same issue here, did you find any info?
---
I meam the meta of fighting over fighting spots
---
It should be separate for sure. Going into NW should put you into vault 51, explore, mess around, just do whatever you want. Then you hit whatever button to lobby in for a match of NW, once it’s found you’re sent to public vault 51. 
---
This way actually becoming the overseer feels like you became one, not just you running around with 51 other overseers in public vault 51.
---
🤣🤣🤣
---
Yep. I'm TERRIBLE.
---
Yes, after level 100 the game gets easier. But, if you want more difficulty, that's up to you. Try getting rid of perks to make the game harder, or use weaker weapons &amp; armor.
---
Remember how the internet knew Bernie was going to win? Remember how they knew Trump would lose?
---
Sometime, *sometimes*, the internet gets it wrong.
---
Let the hammering commence!
---
Dying is always an option, too. You just drop your junk and if there's no one around it's easy enough to pick up again.
---
Never had the issue before.. Sucks balls but at least i know I'm not alone... You are all... Sucking balls with me..
---
I have like 3. I'm lvl 7 through pure attrition
---
I hope.. this game had that "really scared of everything that moves" to "killing everything that moves" type of feel..
---
This reminds me of when I first played the stress test. I got in the game and immediately heard a grown man yelling obscenities at his wife while I tried to watch the intro cutscene.
---
Awkward...
---
I think it'll continue to be restricted until they get server stability sorted out further. They've been far better as of late in my experience, but still have a way to go.
---
Shit. Well thanks for the reply anyway.
---
I actually laughed out loud at this lol, I'm in the very southern savage divide, it's been really slow, but I don't make much off my vending machine anyway.
---
Slight modification. Once dropped, go stand NEXT TO THEM and shoot at your bag. The "next to them" is important so they dont think you're shooting at them.
---
I've played solo from day one love it gives me plenty of time to do atom challenge's.
---
Is that after the free trial ends?  Then yes that is the day...
---
Complete with fishing tournaments
---
When I post something, I usually put the price/trade and stick to it. First come, first serves. And when buying, I usually check first some posts of the trader. I hate bid wars and traders like the guy trying to scam your caps. 64k..... he want to be a wasteland tycoon... 🤣
---
Yeh been a hell of a lot better.
---
No problem, I can't get on for a couple of hours at least, so if you're still around later then you can have it. Message me on xbox and will see if you're on when I am.
---
I've not had much trouble finding the vendorbot at Charleston station, and have found this coat a few times, so it's no big deal.
---
Reddit can't help you. Only Bethesda can, and they don't seem very interested.
---
I looted *millions* of lbs in crafting materials... and oh surprise, I've never been banned.
---
We shouldn't talk about problems because it involves black people? Huh? Maybe I don't get the point you're making...
---
We should be able to choose color of bag based on what it is.. neon green for garbage, neon orange for gift..  it's really hard to spot brown bags sometimes.
---
Did this exact thing to me a few weeks ago. Put it off for a day or two and regained composure, it let me launch that time. 
---
Its pretty painful to have happen. But on the bright side your more prepared and knowledgeable for the next attempt :)
---
Really wish stability was numero uno on the agenda but I...dunno
---
I use a second account, if your on PC you can find them for $10 atm
---
yeah the fanbase threw a collective shitfit like goddamn children.
---
Third person for everything except looting here. I like seeing my outfits.
---
I like that idea, I don't know how much it would impact performance, but the concept is pretty cool ....
---
Hur dur I’m so witty I made joke about the canvas bags
---
Muffled something or other -its like 50% less damage from creatures (The card has the vault boy with a bunch of pillows strapped to him)
---
Just like in real life 'o'
---
it's always there but it's also easy to kill.
---
They can't make it free since it's still linked to adventure mode. Maybe if they reworked it they could, but I doubt they ever will
---
It’s the same with all of Fallout’s social media. I just hope Bethesda sees that those people DO NOT play the game so their opinion shouldn’t matter too much!! Those who play regularly aren’t so negative!
---
It was justifiable at first but it was honestly in a good spot around January. Once people get a sour taste in their mouth they don't normally like to hang around though
---
Considering their relative rarity (except from high level mobs like SBQ) and the weight of flares, I doubt most people would use them.  Hell, high level dudes would only be using em to share legendaries.
---
What about a purse skin so it **does** go with your dress?  A fetching little clutch you can use to carry 60 lbs of junk in?
---
Whitespring Resort Automated Warning: The robot staff has not been maintaining that body of water for many years and there is no lifeguard on duty. Swimming is not recommended at this time.
---
That's why I walk around in non legendary combat armors and a two shot combat rifle. I got all those fancy uny/sent armors and bloodied weapons but don't use them nowadays. and I find the game more enjoyable. I still wreck enemies tho. sneak rifle build is OP
---
No strange in numbers, solar powered is included in my numbers.
---
I apologize about the caption
---
This needs more upvotes, it took me way too long to find out there was an actual Grognak RPG I could play.
---
So far we haven't found a way to fill the paper bags with wolf crap and set it on fire so it is 100% safe to check.
---
If you do the queen of the hunt quest in the mire it can be one of the creatures you have to kill. When I fought it I wasn't expecting a group of bright purple mirelurks to come out of nowhere under its control, was pretty cool
---
Did you win tho
---
You can always check out Oxhorn’s YT channel. It’s what he does, lore.
---
Nothing I posted isn't already public info but w/e edited it anyway. 😑
---
Can't wait to see that!
---
If you're on ps4 I'm selling them.  Pretty decent price too
---
Many people adds it to the title [PC] etc, following the market format
---
Pretty much what my rl purse does now. 😂😂
---
I could have missed it, but is this technically an "end game" content? Like are they coming after we've nuked the place and killed the beast? It wouldnt make sense for people to come into the area with rumors of a plague literally killing all of the inhabitants. 
---
I mean either way i'm excited, just curious
---
But the sales will be over... Today you can get it for $10 in some places
---
The kind of game where u need to try it to know if its good or not ...
---
I hope we get projectors, making a slide show would be awesome
---
I think it'd be cool to be able to get there in Adventure, but I haven't tried so maybe you can?
---
That Gun is the one I'm talking about
---
good to know! i think ill build decoy houses so enemies will assume someone is in there, but i will be waiting outside nearby to get them when they enter it... or place mines inside it!
---
It took a long time, but I can finally give a digital middle finger to the trolls who attacked me for voicing my concerns about the lack of human NPCs prior to the release of the game.
---
Bite me, computer-boys...
---
Sort them by weight.
---
Wasn’t a fan of No NPCs, and I’m sure most can admit that compared to launch the game is much better now. Not to mention I couldn’t justify buying this over other games because I was worried I wouldn’t be into it. Went and bought AC odyssey and DOOM 2016 instead that Christmas
---
Unfortunately you waited until just after a patch that made the game very unstable again.
---
I'll add you.  I'm on most nights, trying to get myself to bed earlier but usually on till about 12 eastern.  Probably also be firing up nuclear winter to get rewards for it while it's out.  At least for a little bit each night if you are interested. 
---
My gt is wahooooooooooie
---
I think it makes things interesting... Also, helps bring players out in the open the avoid a stalemate.
---
Frog legs agility 9 jump like marsupial
---
Suppressor Charisma 9 just like max in Adventure mode.
---
They need to add a option to drop stuff as a gift box
---
I used to have a mule character, but then they added a hard carry weight limit for that as well. Is there still a limit on how many character you can have at once? Cause I'd need a LOT of them.
---
Ive seen it many times on enemies as i play solo
---
My recommendation is like yours. Stay stealthy. Don’t shoot unless you can guarantee a lot of damage or a kill, like a guy on his pip boy or who is AFK. Burst fire with the autos too, it helps keep your aim on target.
---
Yeah i think I'm going to prep a character specific for NW, so i have points spec'd to what perks I'll be using there.
---
I didn't even think about that
---
Well its pretty OP, you can wipe out a lot of people with a nuke lol
---
Time will tell, but I think the Atom shop is pretty popular. With it being the only way to apply outfits to NW (at least currently) that adds more incentive for people to drop a few bucks on the outfit(s) they want NOW.  See quite a few people running around in outfits/skins in adventure, have to assume some of them were purchased versus earned with in-game atoms. If they keep interesting items coming down the pipe people will likely keep buying (handmade skins are highly requested). 
---
Then there are crazy people like me who have bought 3 copies since launch (2xPC, 1xPS4).
---
Any idea what all the cards are?
---
No, it's the same across all platforms.  However, I 100% agree with both statements of an increased gallery limit (I've had to delete some really cool photos to make room for new ones) &amp; having them hanging in our camps would be awesome  :)
---
Thanks, just used my amazon rewards points and got it for 77 cents. Thank god I didn't buy it yesterday like I was planning to.
---
Suppressor is also a 9 point card, and it is in charisma. Tank killer is a 6 point card, that seems fair.
---
I agree. They've almost become some sort of "community" of haters, but they turn on each other at the drop of a hat. Sadly it's become popular to hit games, because they have no defense. It's kind of turning into a type of online bullying. And if you say anything they'll just tear you down as well.
---
I'm honestly half tempted to post this every day. But then I remember it just annoys me and people can use Google search but not reddit search because it's a click away
---
Fair enough, was just thinking base build with no legendaries if your luck doesn’t roll the right way
---
You underestimate how much micro-transactions bring in lol. It has become an entire business model
---
So having a radsuit in inv might actually be handy
---
That's right, there could be some great ol' vintage nukashine for you in there ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Thank you digital it is then
---
Yeah which is why I can understand 5 maybe 6 but 9 is a lot and excludes a lot of people from using it.
---
just  imagine when the limit was only 200 lbs....
---
Thanks y’all! I’ll just keep at it and hope for the best!
---
Progress does not transfer
---
Not, it's not. Dont listen to this douche who took time out of his day to go to a games subreddit just to shit on it.
---
I just type FO76
---
That’s smart but radsuits are kinda rare
---
well that.... sucks
---
The revenue stream comes from the atom shop. We have $8-18 power armor skins and clothes anywhere from $2-$14. Pretty overpriced for a game that I paid $60 for at launch imo, but we get atoms for free in game at a reasonable rate so I don't complain much. Plenty of people buy atoms just to support the game after a good update.
---
Have you tried the neon letters?
---
You may already know this but some of them start and alert you when you travel to the area. The campfire one starts at night (after 10 pm game time) when someone shows up.
---
Yea excluding people would be the point, so not every single person has that OP ass card lol
---
Im still waiting for the mosaic tile floors to return, ive been playing since late November and check the store every day, still havent seen them return yet
---
they made other fixes as well obviously.
---
I've never seen or heard of anyone finding a hide on an actual dead Deathclaw. They are extremely rare randomly spawned container items at present. As such, a truly spectacular grinding opportunity. There have been reports of rare drops amongst the entrails of dead gulpers though.
---
Ok, thank you.
---
What would you normally set it at to avoid that issues, I set up from 70 to 80 maybe I’ll turn off DoF and go to 90.
---
Well it looks like they're bringing back NPC's which was one of the major reasons I didn't buy the game in the first place. I may give it a shot if it goes on an extreme sale.
---
Any raider pa skins spotted?
---
im not a pvper coz I suck and would rather fuck around.  I dont want to play nw if I cant make any decent contribution even if I try.  Want to learn vault lore too but guess im stuck with videos.
---
Hoping to have the full release in a few weeks
---
Just bought a brand new copy from Walmart for $15!
---
I didn't know you could drop camps.
---
Level 6 in NW, no one I've played with has dropped a camp.... 
---
guess I have something new to try.
---
So you're the one leaving Boiled Water and Canned Dog Food everywhere!
---
Greetings!
---
Thank you for contacting Bethesda Customer Support. My name is **** and I'd be happy to help you today!
---
The game is tied with the entitlements code that is redeemed on the account. For consoles, you'll have the game share option. This can only be done if the Home account on the console has the entitlement. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask. I would be more than happy to assist you.
---
For now, we will go ahead and set this ticket to solved - but don't let that alarm you! A simple reply to this email can immediately reopen your ticket so we may resume our conversation.
---
Warm Regards,

Bethesda Customer Support
---
What’s the bug?
---
I’m sure there are creative traps people will make. Just remember that walls can still be destroyed in NW.
---
It "did" suck, technically parts of it "still" suck, but all the stuff you heard about how bad the game was, it was all 100% true... 7 months ago. Stuff has improved.
---
Ive tried everything.. Ive gone through it all.. 
---
game settings, pc settings, deleting ini files.. you name it nothing works for me...
---
hope you have better luck.. Ill be watching just in case a new suggestion comes up...
---
According to wiki, standard FOV for video games is around 60 for console games and 90-100 for PC.
---
atom store purchases and todd accepts the blood of virgins
---
luckily with the new battle royale mode, there are more virgins in FO than usual
---
The ability to read and change card loadout not in vault 51. Let me tinker on the main menu.
---
You can do it! Earlier today, my team won. I was downed 2 times and I killed no one myself. Thanks to my team for carrying my ass lol
---
yeah. seems it's okay as long as you don't keep it. I myself stole some good amount of junks and aids from dupers and I'm not banned. Only greedy ones got banned
---
I've had this happen in real life with real money for real stuff.  Imagine how much more pissed I was when someone sold something out from under me, after we agreed on a price and time and place to meet. People suck.
---
I think that for some peoples this name is very cool name.
---
Exactly.  Bummer pc has it that way.  One of the few ways consul is better than pc.    I always will get the physical copy because of this
---
Bethesda has no real way to discern if you were cheating or just taking items from cheaters.  If you took items that were from dupers you risked the same fate as the dupers themselves. They have no way to tell if you were a proxy account used by the dupers to shuffle items around, but the average player should know not to touched duped items.
---
I hope you're able to get into contact and explain the situation and they're lenient on you.
---
Cool! I was wondering where people were getting em sunglasses lol
---
hey that scorch beast actually got me my first overseer win solo- there were 3 teams left in the final circle, 2 players on team A, 3 players on team B, and only me on team C
---
The scorchbeat came while the 2 teams were fighting and killed them all, so i won the whole round by default, i was hiding in the woods watching it all happen
---
RF, our of curiosity, do you stream as well? I thought just maybe that had something to do with it. Like the games not picking up my mic because I’m using it on another program? I don’t know just wondering
---
Actually they can get quite a lot of money from just the cosmetic items in the atom shop.  They will also be tying in content related to other titles in the shop as well.  I fully expect the doom related stuff to crop up in the atom shop and I expect prices to be at a level where people pony up some money for atom purchases.
---
Further, I believe that all the servers for this game are virtual machine based so they only need to pay out for the level of playerbase that is active during any stretch of time.  More players coming in?  Spun up some more of those VM's to handle it.  Fewer players?  Decrease the cloud usage by removing VM's from that region of the world.
---
On top of this, the base engine is used across quite a few titles so the cost of upgrading and maintaining is also mitigated to a great degree.  Remember that the reason for using this engine is because they find it easy to add content with it as well so costs for ongoing developments may not be as high as you think.
---
Yo I forgot about the law suit lmbo
---
What about your stash
---
Well since he loses absolutely NOTHING by doing it except a few minutes to make a new account each day or two...
---
I hope they add the Johnny Cash one
---
It's full
---
A few things will happen:
---
1. After the free week, people will chill on the hacking because most of them are using free accounts to play.
---
2. Those who continue to hack will be reported and eventually banned.
---
3. They will try to find a way to patch the hack, which is usually not too difficult.   
---
Whether new hacks pop up or not, we will have to see, but this aimbot is definitely getting me killed often.
---
Lvl 20 and I didn't know lol
---
My game experience hasn't changed much since launch on PS4. I've just gotten more friends on my friends list.
---
Same! Btw it’s $17 at Walmart
---
Alot of online games don't do this due to gambling laws, so this probably won't happen. same reason gta online doesn't have casinos.
---
the neon letters and greek lettering show up ok on it
---
I have read that this is a common bug.
---
Possibly, like those you occasionally see in adventure.
---
Nah well I get payed next week so I will just buy then. The anticipation tho
---
Cap stashes function the same as other containers in the games once you loot it it takes I think 24 hrs before you can loot it again
---
No. Fallout 76 is not for hoarders.
---
Well, the thing is. . in past games you had to have a bottle to fill it with water.
---
Makes sense, right?
---
Why change it?
---
This has nothing to do with deciding on picking them up or not. How does this make me a "dummy"?
---
It’s ingame currency tho, you’d use caps not atoms. 
---
In GTA, you can buy money with real money.
---
My all time favorite experience in 76: I'm stealthed by Site Alpha while I nom some food, and I hear somebody yell "Help me!" over local voice chat. I see a guy running towards me. There's a yao guai chasing him. He runs past me. The bear runs past me. I do nothing. I hear gunshots. Silence. Moments later, the bear casually walks back past me. 
---
Only reason I didn't help the guy was I was having a snack at the time, but it felt like a random encounter from a regular Fallout game and I ended up laughing so hard it hurt.
---
I agree on all points. The worst offender being the lack of feeling on hits.
---
For aim assist, well on pc i was matched with a lv 35 that was jumping (with frogleg) and running constantly(for being seen by ennemies) while destroying everyone with cal50. So aimbots are here... it was obvious anyway that adding a BR type of gamemode will bring those cheating dudes.
---
I normally see at least 4 or 5 people when Free Range pops up, but no one showed last night. So I (lvl 68) tried to solo the lvl 80 sheepsquatch. It did not end well for me either.
---
kind of like fallout shelter where they try to bust in the vault door, and it could go through stages.. that would be pretty fun
---
You can transfer to another character.  People offer transfer services on here if you don’t have a friend to help you
---
Oy! Can you do blood packs and dog food cans? 😁
---
Man my name was just an inside joke from high school.
---
I don't usually talk to people that punch me.
---
Yeah we need this for sure.
---
Actually, I like the Radium rifle in NW a lot- the weapon packs good range and accuracy, and while the radiation damage bonus is close to worthless in the adventure mode, in NW it can seriously irradiate opponents and block off a chunk of their health while also dealing good damage.
---
Also, it is automatic.
---
They are 100% for Nuclear Winter ONLY. The person who did the notes about this patch was a moron that didn't comprehend rudimentary sentence structure.
---
To Clarify: What that person was trying to convey is that of the 70+ perk cards 10 of them were ENTIRELY NEW and unique to nuclear winter. The rest of them are the same perks you find in the main game with some tweaks to balance here and there. Nothing whatsoever carries over perk wise between the modes.
---
Why on Earth would you want to do that John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt?  Your name is my name too!
---
Jesus Christ. Why does this game not have text chat?
---
Go into your Pip-Boy and press L1, if I'm not mistaken.
---
Then to edit the CAMP just hold the central panel until you enter build mode.
---
Is there team chat for this or are they really that stupid?
---
Its fine imo. Makes marathoner and action boy make a real difference imo. GUERRELA WARFARE!
---
It's gotten better and the upcoming update looks really refreshing.
---
5 per account..   
---
I need an intervention, I have 5 accounts..
---
We need to get people to respect the garden
---
Nope, i haven't spent to much time searching either seeing as this is just 1 week preview. I plan to check at end of preview see what lists people have up with by then. Then i can maybe prep a character for when it actually comes out.
---
Were going to Subscribe, realized I was already subbed. Nice. I remember some of these videos now that I see them. Good stuff, good info.
---
What happens when you go out?
---
F Juicehead.
---
I have this issue too. Mic works everywhere but Fallout.
---
I posted up asking for help yesterday but it got downvoted for some reason :/
---
True! Run the scrapper perk too
---
Disagree. Theres cover almost everywhere and it's annoying as hell when the meta in a BR is to just sprint away whenever you get hit. Healing is also very fast in this game so if AP was increased you better believe the only viable strategy would be to run away ASAP and heal the second you take damage. Games would be boring if that was the meta.
---
I wonder how companions will be it’ll be kinda weird if everybody was just running around with the same companion, unless they do something different like make every companion have randomly generated faces
---
It sounds like pubg so there's that
---
Bethesda is trolling me finally reloaded finally killed all the higher level supermutants. Then it disconnected again so four times now... Like i happy eveyone is getting to have a go but it didnt crash before the free week play..
---
Some people can get to weapons before you. Have you never played battle royale before?
---
Or you could try the old fashioned trade with players lol
---
I waited because there wasn't a graphic but there is now. (:
---
Pretty sure theres up to 100 tiers for rewards
---
i'm still getting a lot of frame drops and pauses. the game play is pretty good, but the performance on my ps4 is awful
---
Yea true pubg is always the same thing. At least in blackout there’s guns everywhere so you just hear gunshots and taunts and dances emotes lol
---
When is that wavy Willard’s crocodile plush coming??:(( I’m tired of seeing his smug little face in previews for other items.
---
Power Armor in inventory. . . it just doesn't make any sense. There's no sense of risk/reward. 
---
In FO4, you had to do a bit of planning to take it out. Makes sense for such a powerful piece of gear. Realism.
---
Yes, I know you can turn them off. It was just annoying they didn't condense if I wanted to have a few quests open.
---
You can see your teammates names through walls.
---
In FO4 you needed bottles to fill with water. Makes sense. Realism.
---
It just takes away that small and interesting bit of gameplay.
---
So yes, it is an issue. Dumbing down. 
---
I'd rather stockpile bottles than take on a bit of radiation. . .
---
The game is always online. These things should be accounted for. Disconnecting upon respawn after a death and losing all that time invested is a terrible feeling. No system is in place to help with that, and that's pretty pathetic.
---
You have Stockholm Syndrome?
---
Let me see if I can find the manager for you...
---
Yup.  No slap damage and they cant damage my camp?  Go nuts shooting me while I'm at the vendor lol
---
I have all sorts taken over time that I do like to see as loading screens. This is also venting not searching for solutions.
---
Upvote for the lulz.
---
Lock your shit if you don't want it stolen.
---
...the people always shout....
---
I thought the same thing but i had a 200gb ssd lying around and tried it. When my friend say let's go there, i get there first and wait a good 30 seconds,before i see him moving.
---
It's totally affecting my loading times,even in other games.
---
The stutter and lag tho,are still there.i think the current version is asking a little too much to the ps4
---
It’s supposed to be exclusive that’s why it’s hard to get
---
This is what I meant. When I was in High School my name was CoolKidOfDeath420. High school kids like this kind of stuff.
---
I hope the NPC's tell jokes when they're at your camp. Like the classic one about a neutron buying a drink.
---
Oy? ...
---
Blood Packs will already be mapped on the uncommon chems map, and dog food on the prewar food map. Enjoy.
---
Link to pictures of the issue: [https://imgur.com/a/xTGeAMF](https://imgur.com/a/xTGeAMF)
---
Yeah that would be great. First shot of weapon on any enemy
---
Oh damn I've never seen stuff under its control.  Only one I ever saw was by one of those weird pink groves in the Bog.
---
Sweet! Thanks mate
---
We see through your plan, sir. We WILL keep playing with our wireless inernet and devices and we WILL keep letting everyone kill us.
---
Wtf? No shit?
---
Correct. You can’t stack the same effect of food
---
But unlike chems and booze, you can stack *different* effects of food
---
Can you use them in adventure mode?
---
Bummed out that they won't follow you but they do stay at your camp so at least I always have someone to hold down the fort
---
I mean that one would be pretty funny to use. It would be a bit of a dick move but I've had plenty of SBQ fights where people we doing nothing useful and little damage. I might have to try that some time lol.
---
Sounds like the slot machines from fo4.  Haven't seen them yet, maybe I need higher overseer.
---
Go to where you join the scouts - face the bot, the cabin to your right (if you’re standing by the cooking station while facing the bot) has 2 terminals - use them to access exams
---
Sounds like a plan.
---
Yes, other weapons. I know we have no vats, but it kinda feels like there is an opening for something. Not full vats like we have in adventure, but something. 
---
At least one with a silencer. 
---
I'd like more AI creatures. One thing fun is that I'm killing those with melee to stay quiet ;)
---
you dont know at all what build OP is using...
---
Noooooo don’t tell them we need food for our food builds!
---
Nah repick your perk cards instead of asking for a handicap
---
I'm sure they're working just like tamed creatures
---
Yeah, it allows me to equip them
---
I love and prefer third person. Combat tends to be better in first person, but I like being able to see my character and everything around him.
---
&gt;Some human NPCs will be romance-able based on dialogue.
---
 Finally!!! My mom won’t stop asking me about my girlfriend Piper even though I keep telling her she goes to another school.
---
Bummer, thanks for the info. Looking for that fallout 1/2 look of wastelander in a blue jumpsuit and nothing else.
---
Our edge Lord and Savior has arrived all is well!
---
This too
---
Do you honestly think the community managers who are on Reddit or their forums are the same people who fix the bugs? Also, maybe calling them cowards, snowflakes and saying you're "coming to trigger their safe space" is why they avoid you, I sure know I would be.
---
I am an old guy and business is business.  Once a price has been set and agreed upon, its binding.   This new generation is doomed.
---
All the people asking for buffs to AP just want a handicap so they can use their builds without any penalty while nerfing people who actually spec to bee more mobile. Gtfo!
---
Haha that's the only time I've ever felt like the bad guy in this game when i'm taking shit from other peoples extractors.
---
Level 100.
---
Collectors Edition was just a cardboard "Disk" as well. They even included a Steelbook for it. And then Best Buy gave a Steelbook for pre-ordering so i have two steelbooks for a cardboard disk.
---
Go with me to a nukewin
---
Try looking online harder. Took me 30 seconds each. The burrows are underneath harpers ferry, 2 manhole cover entrances. The camera is a random spawn, a search on here or Google will tell you all the locations. Backpack is through the pioneer scouts, poster at train station. Legendary vender is at Berkley springs. None of the info around your questions is vague except maybe the camera. Could have found the answers in less time than it took me to type all this for you
---
A scored PvE workshop defense event.  Score is based on damage done and you only get points using a special weapon that appears for the event that does a flat damage, no abilities/VATS/etc.  Victor has the most points at the end of the contest.
---
There should be a cooldown timer for workshop contests - 30 minutes so the owner/victor has some peaceful time if they're successful.  Max of 3 workshops per player to prevent someone from hoarding all the workshops on a server too.
---
Very nice advertisement. The information about your PC is very helpful. Give this kind of feeling that you are a real person. Very nice ad indeed. 4/10.
---
by store/scrap objects i mean like if i place a wall is there a way that a team member can store it when im busy doing something else?
---
I think when you get duplicates, you get overseer xp **And** you get another perk card.
---
I also think that everyone on the team should get credit for launching the Nuke.  I found a briefcase and my teammates had four keycodes.  We gave everything to one guy on the team to launch and only he got credit for it.
---
Random death glitch still alive and deadly. Since the most recent update as of 2 days ago I keep randomly dying every login. Not sure wtf to do. Start a new character but that's gonna piss me off since I'm a lvl 120.
---
Completely removes the balance...
---
Which is the point
---
Oh come on. It can be exclusive with a lower point cost. You have to drop a lot of very useful cards to use it.
---
ive held my GF's purse while she shops and tries on clothes, sometimes it does feel like it weights 60 pounds
---
Um yeah ok thank you
---
Wipe clean every legacy laser weapon from the game and I might agree with you on adding the perk there.
---
Half your points are "realism" but you're playing fucking fallout, you immediately lost me.
---
My favorite part of NW is that it spits in the face of every one who told bethesda what Fallout is supposed to be and proved them wrong and Im lovin every second of it
---
That would negate the whole point of that legendary effect. Instigating isn't meant to be a group use weapon as it usually either kills the target or almost kills it.
---
Stray animals and hobos usually are more capabke in their enviroment than many of the players I come across.
---
The empathy is not strong with this one.
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/vAfzk9f
---
"Art is not a democracy"
---
perhaps the person who kills the most enemies in the defend the workshop event could win ownership.  Where there's a will there's a way ;)
---
Can you point out the issue? I can't notice it.
---
http://imgur.com/a/gc28afB
---
Exact same issue.
---
Mic works fine in every other game, discord, mumble, everywhere but Fallout.
---
With or without push to talk, area or team chat, there's no mic icon next to my name and I can hear others fine but can't be heard.
---
Two words...cave crickets
---
The hellfire looking power armor is a skin. All the nuclear winter rewards is pretty much cosmetic skins or camp furniture. With some new emblems and picture frames thrown in there too.
---
I found that accuracy decrease with my two shot handmade really shows when I’m not using iron sights or aka my dot sight. I noticed I can actually see the two bullets separate where as in first person they usually look like they hit one spot only. Not sure why it’s like this but it is for this certain weapon for me.
---
Not quite zero effect.
---
It is not uncommon to find enemies that are not at full health.
---
Remeber that non-aligned, hostile NPCs will engage in combat.
---
One would argue that having some form coordinated strategy in place where the rest of the team does not engage until the member of the party with the instigating weapon has landed the first shot is cooperative gameplay.
---
However on the subject of useless weapons I am all up for the Stalker's prefix to be removed from the legendary effect pool of Melee weapons for instance.
---
Now those are truly useless weapons.
---
There is a no level requirement holotape in bar, on bar, across from slot machines
---
Seems fine to me?
---
I mean adventure loot also not the battle royal in the trailer yes it was for the new mode but there is gonna be a big update called nuclear winter
---
Oh no......down vote guy is going to get you on this one.
---
For what tho?
---
Highest is 2nd as a solo, couple wins on teams.
---
Do wish there was a full solo drop option.
---
The bottom half of the torso is distorted when wearing the outfit.
---
Maybe it mean just regular stimpacks not the new kinds
---
Need some frog legs.
---
I had a lvl 9 block me for following him and trying to give him a lvl 15 legendary weapon.
---
Gotta agree. Love my BOS jumpsuit. Can't see that logo with the backpack.
---
Changed it up and put on my mole rat outfit. Looks awesome.
---
It's the game mode I never knew I wanted.
---
*" Fallout needs to have its scary feeling not the "oh im lvl 100+ nothing can kill me.." :*
---
Do whatever quests or dailies you need to do but do it in survival mode. Trust me, you'll will get that 'Scary Feeling' If you wind up on the leaderboard during this process
---
Play survival mode as though is PvE, you don't have to hunt other players down, let them come to you and put your build to the test.
---
I just imagine running it with a Threadripper, 32 gigs at DDR4 3200 and an RTX2080. Then I need new monitors.....
---
Funny you mention that, I didn't even realize I was relying on the numbers to see how much damage I was doing
---
No lol, my team mate died and a mutant hound snuck up on me while I was in a fire fight with the remaining player 😂
---
I would absolutely love this. I spend hours in Sea of Thieves fishing
---
Being at your camp would be enough for me
---
Yo that’s exactly how I beat my first scorch beast. I had my camp set up on the golf course and it attacked, the turrets and guards got him to about half, then I kept respawning until it died. My entire camp was rubble but it died
---
Still a cap in my pocket though.
---
What weapon is the Shark paint for? (Level 13 reward)
---
STOP WALKING IN THE FUCKUNG ROAD YOU PRICK!
---
Hmmmmmm.. interesting.. cant wait to get home and find out
---
They have stated that a reconnect feature is coming.
---
Ooo I didn’t know that, chameleon would be really handy thinking about it 🤔
---
Would it stack with marsupial?
---
Yes, the clock is moving forward so we will be in year two of Fallout 76. They have not said how they will handle the current main quest. You have to go through the main quest to get the ability to launch nukes. They could separate that out into it's own quest line though.
---
If you shoot it breaks chameleon though so from my experience (lv27) its not rly worth it most of the time
---
Lol in fallout 3 I made a goal to collect every time can and bent Tin can I could, and stash them in where the bathtub was in a huge pile. I don't know why I did it, to begin with. Cause it was horrible to pick them all up one by one. But Jesus did I sell every single one, and wait for the caps to refresh each day.
---
Its an amazing mode, when battle royal became a thing i hated it but fallout 76 has made me love that game mode and the game itself alot more
---
So it's "just a game" for you then, right? Not something that gets you so worked up that you need some sort of medication?
---
Thank you for the quick reply! When (/if) you initially heard the rumours and speculation of a Battle Royale, where you excited or dubious as to it?
---
Dam mom, didn't know you were online now.
---
There was a post earlier on the Bethesda forums that the Daily NW challenges have been disabled while they fix some issues (potential exploits, I believe). Character NW challenges are still enabled though. I'll try to find a link to that post.
---
Edit: [Here's a link to said post.](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/348305/nuclear-winter-daily-challenges-temporarily-disabled-june-12-2019?language%5B%5D=en)
---
They just added poker to Red Dead Online
---
They have the ability to generate an infinite number of faces, your face uses the same tool the editor has to make faces.
---
Instigating isn't meant to be a main use weapon. It's a switch weapon for initiating combat on a beefy enemy, or for when an enemy heals to full. Best use is a hard hitting one shot weapon such as the dragon. I use it on the sheepsquatch in free range to make it evolve before it even leaves its burrow, then switch to tse gatling to mow it down while allowing others to get their hits in.
---
Instigating is very much a team play weapon because it requires actual teamwork to be used effectively.
---
I've been playing just as long and I'm 53. It blows my mind thinking how much time others have put in to level up
---
I wouldnt complain if it happened
---
Brilliant! I'm glad you're enjoying it and it's changed your opinion! - Was Battle Royale a genre/mode you always avoided until now?
---
Yeah it's on sale for the week only.
---
Hahaha that is a great story.
---
I have had a couple of similar encounters with the Vengeful mothman. When I was level 25-30 I first encountered him in the mountains leading to the top of the world, he made very quick work of me. I played a little longer and ended up at whitesprings, Mr mothman appeared again and killed me.
---
He must have thought we were both beneath him because I never seen him again until I was a level 85.
---
This time a few shots with my shotgun and I was chasing his head down a hill to loot. I fast travelled to someone’s camp to check their vending stock and straightaway another vengeful mothman appeared looking for revenge, couple of shots and he was down too.
---
Side note: I did manage to sell a mothman wing for 1500 caps, I was pretty happy with that
---
I want faction combat
---
Be home.soon dinners in the oven
---
Welcome to the game then!  Been here since beta but love seeing new people join the servers.
---
What about our boy Graham! And Chally the Moo Moo?
---
Thats not cool but funny
---
Dubious because I hate battle royale games. Going to be honest though, I've steered clear of 76 because of the bad press, but I've had a great time on the game for the free trial and I will definitely be picking it up after.
---
Is there an issue where we arent actually get the perk pack rewards from the level up? Or are those only for use in NW?
---
Nope, vault is closed in adventure mode.
---
It wasn't organized, but it was definitely band wagon where a vast majority of people never even played it. People were butt hurt it wasn't what they wanted Bethesda to announce. I bet a lot of people are going to be shitting on Starfield once it gets near release too because it isn't Fallout 5 or ES6.
---
Okay, good... I'm not the only vain one....
---
Ok, I will check the next time I'm on. being in europe I might only be able to help on the weekends due to time zones. Had the same issue with players on Ark. XD
---
Hehehe started my own drinking game with your guys posts.  Every time you used "anecdotal" i took a drink.
---
Oh? They've been buffing the heavy weapons have they?
---
This is why people in IT get paid big bucks to use Google.
---
I will check when I get on.  :)
---
Creation Club and Atom Shop.
---
The BR stuff transfer over to adventure mode. Besides that possible loot from the vaults and etc, but the rewards like the PA seem to be from the BR so far
---
I've been nice about this for eight months and they ignored me. So now I'm done pretending they deserve my goodwill.
---
Wait they're worth that much?! I think I got a torn one and wound up scrapping it not knowing any better. What do you make with it?
---
Your all fairys. Seriously negitive karma. Your not even on my level thats why you added negitive karma if you where then you would of gave me plus karma because you understand. And if you where in this game I'd kill you and steal your junk bag and troll your camp. Your the reason why this game sucks now is because of personalities like this. Someone tells the truth and how it is and crybabies don't like it. You want be a loser and sit on a extractor all day and do some events and help each other that's fine. I want true die hard fallout fans here and back in this game that where removed. I want slap damage returned. I want camp destruction back. I want all out chaos again. I want the beach boys shooting my junk mule and others at spawn points again. I want YouTubers, Twitch streamers, MLG griefed out of the game. It needs to be given back to the ones that run it.
---
I don't have the gift emoji. Downloaded it but doesn't come up as an option
---
Besides, farming ore, especially lead, is easy once you have the Excavator armour.  You just hop down to the Lucky Hole mine.  
---
I took a player that I was helping to the mine and we both got about 300+ ore, which translates to 750+ lead scrap (ignoring Super Duper).  You just need a lot of acid to smelt it.
---
And the meat gives awesome bonuses the better the rarity
---
Damn lots of bugs/gltches. I have been playing since beta and u have had more issues than i have had ever
---
Could be. Though I was seeing posts last night about people exploiting a challenge about placing your camp over and over, so I figured they're fixing that.  I'm not really sure. But I did update my reply with [this link to Valseek's post about it if you wanna check it out.](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/348305/nuclear-winter-daily-challenges-temporarily-disabled-june-12-2019?language%5B%5D=en)
---
Two shot weapons generally don't have great accuracy unless your close to what you're shooting
---
That would be why your level 27 and I’m just level 10 lol, I spend too much time sneaking in bushes,searching for armour, and not getting into gun fights till half the player count is dead  lol 😂
---
Bloody mess is 9 in luck
---
I'll have to give it a download later then. Wish Bethesda would have implemented their own text chat. I'm not fond of voice chat.
---
and the guy were not in the front ,he was behind far away between house.....
---
Totally thinking the same def need a tactical bag better than the shovel one.
---
Ngl i spend 80% of my time in bushes, i just start at the same place every time and almost always have marine armour and a 50cal, handmade, or scoped lever in about 1 minute, then hide till top 10 or so
---
&gt;Dubious because I hate battle royale games. Going to be honest though, I've steered clear of 76 because of the bad press, but I've had a great time on the game for the free trial and I will definitely be picking it up after.
---
Wow, so even after the lackluster feedback, you joined from the free trial and will now be buying it! That's great, I hope to see you in Appalachia!
---
Sound like a lot of work. Lol
---
I tried to loot some water and picked a lock. Someone chased me all over the map for 10 caps. Ok.
---
It is, Just don't know if Bethesda will ban you for it. Can't see why, it wouldn't affect the game play, or give an advantage in my opinion.
---
After level 50, every perk point you get from a level-up can be used to either pick a new perk card, or swap a point from one SPECIAL to another.
---
In this video, this guy checks out a location where Robot Armor plans and Marine Armor plans spawn. The spawns refresh after 24hours, so it'll take some time and server hopping to get the plans you need (took me about a week to get all the robot plans from here.)
---
 I have yet to see vendors sell Robot Plans but I'm sure Ive seen them sell Metal Armor plans before
---
EDIT: Sorry, this is the correct video link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PzGT5BEBGg
---
I don’t know if they are worth that but that’s what a level 153 paid for it lol.
---
I think there is one of the tadpole challenges that you need the mothman wing for, I seen that and thought someone might be desperate enough they will pay for it and they did.
---
I don’t even know if there is anything craftable from it
---
I get motion sickness from fallout 76 and doom. I've heard it's fov and motion blur. Fallout 4 never gave me any problems though.
---
I hope people treat new players better. Dont want them to hate the game cause of a encounter
---
Never thought to do that, I think I'm going to have to give 3rd person a shot. Will hopefully give me better awareness in NW as well.
---
**KNOW YOUR PLACE, TRASH!**
---
This is the wrong place to ask. While almost everyone here likes it, many, many people I've seen on other subs seem to hate it. I've seen places (Livestreamfails for example) where anyone that said that Fallout 76/BR is not bad got downvoted into hell.
---
New players on survival. This is how I get free stuff. Please run away. People are your enemies.
---
It happens. You'll get used to the wasteland in time.
---
I know that for sure, but what I’m saying is that the bullets are like obviously horribly inaccurate in third person where as I could hit every time if I Ads in first person from my camp to where as far as the mob can render every time. and there’s no sign of bullets being inaccurate as we all know at least with guns like the handmade and lever action two shots explosive like I have as long as I’m in first person with a dot sight.
---
Are u using perk loadout manager?  If yes get the new version
---
Err... other players can't see the name you put on your weapons...
---
Ah yes, documentary # 3,376 about "What went wrong with Fallout 76", a timeless classic.
---
Ah makes sense, with how few I've seen in the 100+ hours playing I can see someone buying it for a challenge like that.
---
Dick
---
More like Bore Ragnarock.
---
Haha ok well my gt is HomerSimpson428 but I won’t be on all week bc I’m going on a trip!
---
I agree 100%. I have no issue with reward items being locked behind it, or maybe even all the lore being locked behind like level 10–but there are terminals you can’t look at til you’re over 100! 
---
Without VATS, I’m struggling big time. I really only play Fallout games, so I’m just trained for it at this point. I think NW is fun, way better than I ever expected, but it’s disappointing that I’ll never be able to get to some of the story content.
---
Editable would mean we can edit the food to give whatever stats we want it to give.
---
I think you meant edible, lol.
---
I was using it last night before the new one was up. Just downloaded the update. Thanks!
---
The character creator is pretty in-depth, and I don't think Bethesda would have given us such an in-depth character creator if they didn't want it to be used. If that's your way of deflecting legitimate problems with the game that's fine tho.
---
Surely its a buff to perception which is otherwise pretty useless to most builds
---
Yup, back when Wild Appalachia first came out back in March. You can read about the changes here https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4rzMQ3PdnK5hOjt1fc9VAV/fallout-76-wild-appalachia-patch-notes-march-13-2019
---
Thanks, I just had to vent is all.
---
It's the only way I can reliably use my instigating black powder pistol while sneaking.
---
Stuff under its control? It showed up at my camp and brain washed my brahmin!? IM GONNA DROP FERTILIZER ON ITS FACE
---
Yes. I think it's been a really smart move from Bethesda to do this free trial at this point after they've worked on the game because I'd imagine there will be alot of people like me who have avoided it but it will give a good first impression now. Maybe I'll see you round, good luck with the video!
---
Theres definitely hackers I've encountered one and have seen video of others. Hope they all get banned soon. Try to record video to send to Bethseda.
---
You can customize your character outside the vault?
---
My group killed multiple dupers back then (on stream), looted tons of all kinds of mats, and never had any issues.  We obviously "denied" the dupers their stuff by taking it and then dropping it on the ground once they left.  No one else in my group got suspended.  All I've been trying to get Bethesda to do for FIVE months is simply hop onto my account, check my items, and realize I never kept any stolen loot so that my suspension can be lifted.
---
Thank you for the feedback on this idea! - I have also asked r/Fallout and the first reaction I got was bad but the only feedback so far on here was good, maybe that's something to look into as well. If you can suggest Subs to ask, I will gladly post there and hopefully get a wider range of opinions!
---
Does anyone else notice that the XP grind is getting much harder as you level? I understand that’s usually a mechanic in games but I’m at 22 and winning a match doesn’t seem to get me a full level anymore. I couldn’t imagine what it would be like up at 80s of the 105 you need to access vault stuff
---
Having a backpack, particularly with the High Capacity mod, is absolutely worth the one pound it weights even if you normally use PA.  Particularly since I have maxed strength so PA makes me weaker.  When encumbered, jumping out of PA and getting that sudden huge boost in carryweight is liberating.
---
Likewise, having the refrigerator mod really takes the stress out of a lot of challenges and quests where I used to worry about things spoiling if I allowed myself to get distracted before returning to the quest giver or completing the brewing/cooking.  Worth not traveling in PA for a bit just to have a very relaxed bit of play.
---
Even if you're not looking for the badges, this was a daily which reset every day at the same time regardless of server.  It was fast and easy, which helps hit those level-up challenges, and occurs in an area with monsters that have useful resources.
---
On the plus side, we don't meed everyone having NPC(s) following them around and clogging up doorways/framerates.
---
Yes, this is true, except I tried out a new weapon type and like it better than my current build... and bringing 10's of special points over to accommodate the playstyle switch requires levelling up a ton! For the unsure or multi-talented player it would be extremely useful if you could pay a set number of caps to expedite the process... not suggesting pay to win, just suggesting that we accumulate so many caps while out in Appalachia I wanna be able to switch builds quicker and don't mind paying... it'll also help me from reaching cap limit all the time. LOL
---
Upvote for blow goats.
---
Wow. Yeah you're getting all the bugs. I've been steadily playing since beta and haven't encountered that many bugs in such a short timeframe. Also if you're on PS4 I can build you some regular armor and weapons and donate some meds to help you on your way.
---
Id pay to respec honestly i stopped playing my first character because I realized how many levels id need to get to respec what I wanted, and then unlock perks i wanted. Nope! New character.
---
Stop hoarding so much shit.
---
No, there has to be a way to reward players who spec really hard into a given special trait.
---
I do have a hi-cap bacpack and yeah. My friend let my touch the plans when there was that bug for it
---
Do you honestly think you're important enough for them to "ignore"? I'm seriously just baffled by all of this, you should get off the computer and go for a walk or something, it'll be ok I promise.
---
&gt;I think the fix is that for any sleeping animation it must be a long press.
---
This right here. Anything we interact with (other than work benches I guess) should function exactly like the trade request button  where you have to hold it down for 3 seconds or so.
---
That skills! Thx!
---
What are you referring to "change the name" only you can see that. Did you literally make a post acting like you're a clever comedian because you thought of doing something, but actually didn't?
---
Lol looks like they knew they messed up, “npcs weren’t supposed to be in the game originally”!
---
Glad I’m not the only one lol
---
Just as an FYI the same applies to Deathclaw hides, there are 5 needed for a possum challenge and they are super rare.
---
The wife sold one for 2000 caps.
---
I have found 1 so far and accidentally scrapped it :(
---
Didn't give me anything
---
Nah, it was just you being a dick.
---
Oh well isn't that nice. I might have to dust off my vault suit and bring my .50s back out
---
An unscrappable flight of stairs. One that ruins your foundations and glitches up your camp. Such a Rose thing to do.
---
a better question is how do i get MY stuff super shiny?
---
I play in 3rd person most of the time, when I'm not looking for stuff to loot, because I get a lot of first person sickness if my camera sensitivity isn't turned way down..  and even then it's still a struggle.
---
Bethesda needs to step up here. Rare that screenshots backing the claims are available, yet help on the other end isn't there.
---
It's only 20 years after the bombs not 200+ things are going to be less damaged.
---
We killed a lot of dupers back then and no one else in my group had this happen to them.  We always took the duped loot in order to "deny" the dupers of their ill-gotten gains.  Once we made the dupers leave, we always dropped the duped loot on the ground in a bush so on one else would get to it.  
---

The last email I got from Bethesda Support clearly stated that they would go on my account, remove any duped items from my account, and then give me my account back.  Three months later they still haven't done anything.  The problem is, like I said repeatedly in my post, at no point did I ever keep any duped items so I think someone from Bethesda Support accessed my account, didn't find any duped items, and then for whatever reason moved on to the next support ticket without unfreezing my account.
---
Trust me it's terrible
---
I'll pm you pictures
---
Most satisfying note on the top screen for a looter.
---
"Easy livin', this ain't!"
---
Damned raiders, helping themselves to the contents of my unlocked containers!
---
*shakes fist to the air* damn you all to hell!
---
Underground? You mean the dungeon? Thats at harpers ferry.
---
The camera you have to find a corpse with it on it. Look up spawn locations for it.
---
The backpack you gotta go to a train station and look at the pioneer scouts poster. Do that story and youll get it rather soon.
---
The legendary vendor is at berkley springs l. You need legendary script which is earned from scrapping legendaries at train station machines
---
Nvm lmao
---
And under that paper bag?  Mines.
---
A lil hostile but yes. If it name change didn't work that's fine I still made 100 caps of some signs I consider that a win
---
Ps4
---
I would give up support for mods. They have a section on the website that explicitly says fallout 76 does not officially support modding, but, there are mods out there on the Nexus.
---
They don't need to go into your account. They have it all on their server's data.
---
Any power armor. It works like the 4 horsemen power armor skins. It just changes the appearance of any power armor. I've read here an there on both this and Bethesda forums that there's a base skin that's all black or dark Grey and theres the one shown in the trailer that's all orange.
---
*smiles in retro*
---
You are right but I can't change the past. I take responsibility for my actions.
---
I agree that not having character names visible makes them entirely pointless. Might as well just call our character slots "slot 1", "slot 2", etc because the names mean nothing anyway. We don't see them anywhere in the game except for character select. 
---
I don't even care if the names are stupid; I'd rather see "Jim-Bob McTruck" than "lmwb777". 
---
If it's a matter of needing account names visible, just do it like ESO, a property *Bethesda also owns*, where they *already* display character names with the account name beneath it.
---
Maybe some something a little different. Something with the feel of comic books
---
What platform? I could use a good gun to start out with, after getting to 50 on PS4 and just getting too tired of the extreme lag.
---
Whoever kills the most enemies in "defend the workshop" gets control makes sense to me.
---
The plans sell and trade for a decent amount. It's a pretty easy way to make a nice amount of profit with minimal daily effort.
---
First.
---
Darn I should read those patch notes better
---
Maybe I just don't pay attention in VATS, but I haven't noticed it either.
---
I would appreciate, not being stuck in an infinite „joining team“ loading screen after every single game. This happens without exeption. I have to completely close the game, which is more than annoying.
---
Ive noticed some enemies get a red arrow over there head some times I think thats from my team mate but im not sure how that functions at all or if its a perk?
---
For sure, criticism needs to at least be objective. I saw a bunch of people going off at angry Joe though, and he wasn't wrong in his review lol.
---
There's been a lot of things Bethesda has handled very poorly as well, but you're right. If you castigate them for unimportant shit then you're wasting everyone's time.
---
No Bethesda, thank you!
---
Would they rather you take the ore that was there when they will get more or have someone take the workshop all together for the ore? I don't lock my purifiers or copper extractor at my camp because it will always make more.
---
Glad to be a part of it. Good work, Bethesda. I have been a long time fan of your work, and have enjoyed many games put out by your amazing team. I have faith in you, and in FO76.  It was a rocky start, but you made an amazing game that my friends and I enjoy playing at least a couple times a week. Thank you!
---
Keep up the good work! You are doing great.
---
Yes I am also an asshole but I like your insult more
---
😍
---
Why aren't you using a shotgun? Or a hunting rifle? I know those are both drops for your level. Either one and you wouldn't be having so much trouble with the mutants. I'd say, get yourself a shotgun for the tougher enemies.
---
I'm not sure where you are at when you say Gray town, but if you are outside of the Forest or Toxic Valley, you shouldn't be at your level. Other areas aren't level locked and will wreck you. If you mean Grafton (it just occurred to me) you're fine. Get a shotgun and some shells off a scorched first though. 
---
And Morgantown Airport is good for stimpaks and chems.
---
I won't romance any of them for sure.
---
I don't won't to share my wasteland love with 5.000 others. That's not my type of style lol
---
What's your gaming platform? I'm only on for weekend mornings but these requests are frustrating. I'd gladly help any new players on PC (ign raskol), but my play time is limited.
---
Thanks dude
---
Go and suck a soy latte you weeb
---
can confirm as i looked on amazon and it is 17.00
---
Have you played h1z1? It's like that. Pretty janky, and for the moment quite easy to win matches if you're even slightly experienced in brs. Some things seem quite off though. Like your special stats carrying over from adventure mode which gives you a clear advantage over others. No unlimited sprint feels really bad, but the map is really small so I suppose it's balanced that way because of it.
---
Unless he/she’s randomly generated and yours truly.
---
Same issue here. On Xbox and this is day 2 of not being able to do the repeatable quest. Annoying, but glad I'm not alone. If it's widespread it will almost certainly be fixed... hopefully.
---
Did any of your previously collected codes expire and self destruct on that play through?
---
“It ain’t so bad being a dick...”
---
-Team America world police
---
You do realize there’s people who aren’t able to physically speak right? Like a person who’s mute.
---
Or perhaps deaf as well.
---
Do you run in PA or use VATS a lot?
---
Thank you BGS, I know things have been rough, but you're getting there! I have played through the duping the adrenal reaction bug, the stimpak weight bug, and I know I will play through more!
---
Please, for the love of atom and all that is nuclear, give me a patriotic super sledge paint, I want to name it the Star Spangled Slammer!

These are common cheats in Fallout 76 and will be even more common now when BR was released. You need to live with these cheats, because Bethesda won't fix these problems and they even can't fix those. Thanks to their 10+ year old game engine.
---
This isn’t nearly as bad as those doing the trading glitch back in the day. Where you could steal other players stuff
---
I shouldnt be able to sit down or sleep when enemies are nearby
---
Well I'd hope they washed the suits.. that might explain it a little bit?
---
I'm surprised they've been so slow to offer backpack options in general.  Maybe it's just too tedious to acquire, so they don't sell as well as other things.  Who knows.
---
As far as I know, they've put out the Nuka-Cola pack, the "Hands Off" pack, the shovel pack, and the silver Corvega pack.
---
Aw hell apparently I already have it installed.....
---
Ah ok I see lol. Never tested it in third myself I've only noticed accuracy difference in vats and sometimes while ads
---
I was lucky enough to get Frog Legs and Commando before level 9. I have such a huge advantage. lv32 overseer rank now, I'm having a blast.
---
I was using VATS a lot because of bugs yes, is that it?
---
do you play on pc or console? i have some extra weapons that may be of use to you? not sure your more than welcome to look if your on pc
---
My husband always says..”what do u keep bricks in there?” 😂
---
Technically the X-01 and the advanced power armour mk 1 (seen in Fallout 2) are different armours, although are similar the X-01 is the base design that inspired the advanced power armour. Oxhorn made a video about it [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwnZo-mMjIo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwnZo-mMjIo) The same is also true of the X-02 and the advanced power armour mk 2 (from Fallout 3) although it was seen in Fallout 2 but had a very similiar model to the other power armour, but back in those games many things used similar models like the hardened power amour. As for the Hellfire when Fallout 3 came out we were certainly under the impression that it was made at Adam's air force, although its possible that the design was simply improved there or mearly that's were they were manufacturing it on a large scale. Lots of the lore is undefined
---
I use the bright light on all of my armors and have never noticed a difference.
---
Boi that sounds like a lie
---
I bet you also steal from neighbors’ kids’ piggy banks yes?
---
Yes, any AP usage is a direct drain of your power cores.
---
If you poke around vault 51 you’ll find a vault backpack, I hope that skin is a ranking up reward.
---
Social experiment? New players dont know any better or anything of the game.. Prick
---
I wanna see too!
---
Ah that does suck! I personally don't like the loading times between games. In comparison to Apex, etc, it does feel incredibly dragged out with 5 or so minutes (total) waiting for each game.
---
Have many friends, etc, had the same issue? I on Xbox One haven't as of yet!  (Assuming you're on PC?)
---
Which is the reason why I have my camp on an acid node. Praise the lord and pass the ammunition indeed. Btw wth is coal for i have like 200 pcs
---
Lucky for you. Just went against someone jumping around and shooting grenades at us. Not so fun for us lol
---
Might be that, fuck.
---
Are they regular stimpacks? Because those were the only ones that counted for me
---
Soy latte's aren't even that good tho, I'm more of a caramel frap kinda guy.
---
hmm I don't think so but I might of taken a Pokemon card in 3 rd grade
---
Well if you had decided to change builds after like level 100 then ud have plenty of points. I know this is useless info but I just wanted to say it
---
One thing I didn't see mentioned was you need to level up your weapons.  Make sure you aren't rocking that level 1 machete or hunting rifle. The damage difference from low to high level stuff is noticeable.
---
No, just no
---
Thanks for input friend, according to other Redditors might be related to VATS use.
---
Just curious, how big is the free download file.  I swear my total DL for this game since beta is pushing 100gb.
---
Definitely. I at least don't feel like I'm neglecting my main chars leveling
---
Perfect, then it should be that much easier for them to clear my account.
---
Three months ago they said they'd remove any duped items from my account and then give me the account back.  Three months later and nothing has happened.  The problem is I never kept any duped items on my account so there's nothing for them to remove and instead of just unfreezing my account, they've decided to just ignore my problem completely.  Hoping that by posting my situation on Reddit, someone from Bethesda will see this and will be kind enough to look into it and get my account unfrozen.
---
To be honest I'd consider anyone under the Lv50 softcap a newbie... although at 25 I'd offer you armour and weapons rather than stimpacks.
---
(There's no real point giving lv2 players weapons - they replace weapons and level up so fast. Lv20+ you might get some use out of them before they need to be replaced.)
---
I've gotten heavy gunner, commando, and bloody mess in my first few levels. At rank 17 now, and the only other useful perk I got since then is briefcase detector. There are supposedly 73 cards, and yet I only have about 20 and 60-80% of what I find is duplicates
---
Damn, I guess I got lucky getting frog legs only being around lvl 15.  Good info thanks.
---
Wasn't that just a rumor?
---
I have had almost no bugs since the beta,other than server wide ones, but two of my friends had so many bugs/glitches they ended up quitting forever a few months back. It's weird how that works.
---
*"Capitalist Pig"*
---
**Liberty Prime would be proud.**
---
Vats and sprinting use cores, jetpack eats cores for dinner.
---
expired and extras, i was damagin myself with falls too
---
Oh man, that grenade launcher pairs with frog legs is OP. 100 damage per shot and huge blast radius. It's fun.
---
I did for a brief stint! I too think that's probably the closest comparison for it!  Although I was terrible at that and it does seem to have carried over! - I understand your concern with SPECIAL stats, but you're totally right, the map sizes are perfect for the current formula!
---
What would you personally change if you could?
---
I watched a guy moving so quickly that he seemed to be skipping around the map
---
Always a good idea to report.  Help Bethesda solve this he problem and make it not happen in the future.
---
If you read some of the terminals while waiting for NW to start they talk about another PA the X02, can’t remember what the entire entry says but they talk about that armor. So there could be a new PA coming into the game and not just a skin
---
For sure, I learned this in a bad way early on during a SBQ fight and had to slowly drag my ass back to Watoga getting spammed by SB the entire way. Lol
---
As far as stimpacks go, just capture and do the defend events at workshops. You get caps, meds, exp, plans, and occasionaly decent weapons and armor.
---
One of the standing signs inside V51 is interactable, it brings you to the atom shop where to can "NW Favorite" certain apparels, which will then start equipped on the NW game.  Not sure if you can do it in normal atom store.
---
Imagine being so braindead that you think this post is an ad.
---
Oooooh interesting
---
Jetpack I know, but since I’m a very moderate user of VATS I was surprised by the drain!
---
Why does YouTube prioritize the most incendiary and controversial videos?  Because it keeps people angry and engaged, which means more ad revenue for Google's bottom line.
---
People like to criticize the proliferation of "fake news" on Facebook and Twitter, but Google has really flown under the radar despite pulling the exact same nonsense, partly because those who know better are too afraid to go after the juggernaut.
---
I can't post, the subreddit only allows text. I'll post it to the fallout subreddit
---
Don't underestimate the pipe rifle dude - saved my butt early on. *Get crafting!*
---
As far as I know the only use of coal is making water filters to purify water when you don't have water purifiers.   I never did much of that myself.  I used boiled water until I realized that boiled water is heavier than purified water.  I then built 6x water purifiers in my camp.
---
That seems like a lot of work for 100 Caps.
---
So that worse then not getting the unique stuff added ever ?
---
Ok, enough of a victory lap, back to work on Wastelanders! You're on a roll, stay on target!
---
I never really used vats until recently, but I always kept such a steady supply of cores it never bothered me anyway.
---
Line in the sand event is great for xp and cores.
---
Man all I’m getting is shitty melee cards and duplicates. I haven’t got a single card of use for NW and I’m level 17
---
Nvm
---
It was 50gb I believe
---
Scrap every weapon you find for mods, stick to the Forest. the pipe revolver benefits from both Gunslinger(pistol) and Rifleman(long rifles), so it's a solid weapon to use for a long time. If you stick it out, almost always a higher level player will find you and help, but Im sure most are reticent to drop alot of gear on players who might not come back after the free trial ends.
---
I just have 8 glitter bomb slots
---
MODUS too
---
I honestly thought people were finding the camp device in containers hahaha
---
I’m usually pretty free when I own workshops. It’s when you see my raider there actively patrolling that I’m not trying to share my stuff.
---
Troof. I always run by the power plants when I see they're occupied, just to see if the generator is unlocked. I don't camp and farm the genny or anything, but yeah, if you leave it unlocked I just assume you're being a cool dude.
---
It wasn't but in the end it didn't matter my idea was dumb from the get go
---
Bloody mess 100%
---
There are 3 in a single server
---
Bloody mess ... always have it equipped
---
lmao that’s hilarious indeed. Hope mama murmghr treated you well so you’re not scripping everything!
---
I guess I'm gonna be a bad santa and hand out coal to the little newbies this week. With nukashine ofc.
---
Bring sex back to fallout!!!!
---
Well guard posts, walls and machine gun turrets are found it containers in the form of quick kits.
---
Ummm, no.. my issue is backpacks ruin fashion end game for me. You're forced to use a backpack in division which most would agree makes the fashion end game less viable.
---
 A backpack here would also make the fashion end game difficult for me since a lot of outfits don't fit with a backpack. At least for me. Would love that extra carry weight, but fashion&gt;utility for me anyway.
---
Man there was too many stories I feel like for it to be a rumor. Maybe the fear spread quick and it really was.  Never happened to me personally. But I do remember there was a patch where everyone said it was fixed.  Could be just some conspiracy.
---
The scorchbeast is stupidly easy to kill its more to spot out people camping at the edge at the last circle imo
---
Oh, wow. Sorry, dude.
---
Well this takes place after the Vault 76 dwellers began their conquest against the scorched plague, so presumably the wastelanders heard that the situation in Appalachia was improving
---
Why would I not play it? I haven't had a single PvP engagement in Fallout 76 since I started playing. It might as well not be in Adventure mode. I Just consider it a co-op Fallout game.
---
Yeah, the guy that I was helping had the same idea.  He asked me to make Nukashine for him because his camp couldn't spawn in the world that we were in.  I think that they are sitting in my fermenter...
---
Theoretically, it comes from the Atomic Shop.  The costs in real world money are inflated because you can earn Atoms playing the game, but you're looking at something like $15 for a Power Armor skin or $2-$5 for a random CAMP goody.
---
I feel like the timer is probably longer on cap stashes. I've hit the same one sometimes two days later and it's empty. Didn't notice before I started rolling with fortune finder.
---
I first played few matches before going reading comments on Bethesda Twitter account... that was awful, people keep saying:”nobody is gonna play this” while server was full of people lol... the game I had was actually funny and gameplay very accurate even if it’s still a beta.
---
Bloody mess is good for any character and a heavy weapons is not going to be great with vats.
---
Minigun lmg or the .50 cal will crush the vats meter in no time. I did have a stalkers harpoon that might be a good sniper weapon... But on the whole i dont think going a vats build is a great idea with heavy.
---
Oh I remember, that was not a good time for me.
---
I know it was terrifying in the beginning
---
You realize that you are not S.P.E.C.I.A.L right?
---
They did the same with *every* ~~duper~~ banned account.
---
If they wanted to unban you, they would. Thing is, they probably have seen something that simply doesn't give them the confidence to let you have your account back. And like I said, Reddit isn't going to help.
---
So I updated it, put it in the SArchiveStartUpList in my custom ini and my perks still aren't working. Ah well.
---
They are either icons or stash skins. Not actual boxes that you open/redeem
---
I feel like survival is useless when I know there are guys running around with a sentinel set and literally unkillable. I fell like legendary weapon/armour effects should be buffed/negated in Survival is your character carries over. 
---
I'm a level 125 and I still haven't played Survival because I hear the horror stories and It's only reserved for people who have the very best of the best stuff.
---
I also think it's bullshit you can have a team of four people running around massacring people.
---
Yes please to fishing.
---
Had to check the User History to confirm not a shitpost...
---
But seriously, nice to see the company appreciating it's fans, not just it's shareholders.
---
A little hostile? Dude, this is like star wars kid levels of cringe.
---
I understand, 60-80% is consistent with the numbers I’m getting as well, seems a bit high don’t you think? 
---
And damn i’ve forgotten about bloody mess. Missing out on that as well.
---
I don't know, you tell me. I don't have those issues.
---
Do you still need the disc in it to play?
---
1) you're bragging about something you can't do. Can't trick people with names because only you can see it .
---
2) you didn't scam anyone. You helped them. That low a level they probably haven't seen a protest sign and wanted one. I have a toon designed after stinky Joe from teen Titans. He carries a protest sign, raggedy clothes and full beard. Only weapon he carries. He's a mule with no other job.
---
3) you look foolish. Not a dick or asshole cause you gave them a weapon they wanted. They see the stats in the trade and that it's weak and knew before purchasing. So, in reality, you helped a couple low levels and got paid for it.
---
4) I can make 100 caps walking out my base door and nothing else. You wasted your time for nothing.
---
Oh the downvotes. You god they’re coming.
---
Yes. Respec the garden, people
---
No this is the "don't fuck with me, I have the power of God and anime on my side." Kid
---
Can’t speak for anybody else than the people I play with but whoever is teamleader, has to close and restart the game due to this. Always. Adds a couple mins extra on the already long waiting time to start a game. I‘m on PS4.
---
It’s like that. sometimes it’ll refresh and some times it won’t I think it might have to do with being in the area before the timer expires.  My base is close to a spot o farm regularly and if I take something from there it usually takes a couple days to reset sometimes
---
Good ol' Appalachia fish!       https://imgur.com/dA3YLqF
---
Tyvm, sometimes hard to notice things amidst the kids running around and punching everything.
---
So start a new character.
---
Thank you for not giving up after the backlash
---
Unfortunately, yes. Even though 99.99% of the game is on my hard drive
---
You bloodied? It happens when the well fed buff wears off, keep the bar around half full.
---
So in the end am I the good guy without knowing it? Or am I a dumbass it did something better for the new guy?
---
Thanks alot for participating in the community, reading our feedback and updating the game with new features and content - that’s the key to making this game enjoyable and a success for a long time!
---
 Please *assume the position*.
---
Cheat engine works for fallout 76. So it’s not at all surprising.
---
Because it’s loading enemies before you can see them

But to be fair, they are small and fade out pretty quickly at a distance.
---
Jeez that’s annoying! Was hoping I’d be able to pick it up cheap physically and always have it on my PS4. It’s just me being lazy I guess haha but it makes no sense. Digital is so expensive for these bigger games.
---
I looked earlier for posts asking the same thing. Theres a few PA and weapon skins, and 3 colors of the trophy from the lobby. Idk how to link in mobile but u might be able to find it, they're updating the list as they go aswell
---
The goal is to fund everything through the Atomic Shop
---
But what about DOGMEAT?!
---
What's your level?
---
Literally 76
---
Okay thank u
---
Could be a stealth boy mod that also makes the bag invisible lol
---
So far only a handful of atom shop items can be placed
---
I approve this message
---
Same on XB1, yup. I end up using XB1’s screenshot system to screenshot the saved images and then nuking old ones within the game. Really dumb.
---
If I'm on a team, yeah more or less... if I'm solo, IDGAF I know I'm dead, as long as I get 1 or 2 other people - it's a win in my book.
---
Ah I would, but my character has been messing up so I had to make a new one and I'm only level 11
---
THANK YOU!! I thought I had lost my mind..I am on PC  so I thought the bugs wouldn't be as bad.. Boy did I miss a few tutorials. Thank you!!
---
Same, my best and favorite is bombadier as I love grenades.  I only know about bloody mess from seeing it on another players loadout.  I do have ironclad though which helps a little, 50/50 more defenses for 5 endurance.
---
workshops are lost when changing servers
---
I noticed the same thing when I went to the map and saw so many low level players.
---
Yes, from what I know
---
Awesome. Congrats!
---
Hopefully they can help out around the place by auto-harvesting water/crops or at least helping defend the CAMP.   If you can place them in specific spots then I could also see folks using them for RP flavor in a variety of ways.
---
i didn't finish rdr2 yet, i don't even play anymore but damn i got 10 of 13 iirc of those legendary fish lol
---
Definitely my favorite one so far.  Pairs well with Metal Armor too.
---
To play devil's advocate, please don't add fishing because then I will spend all my time fishing...
---
*Vengeful Mothman teleports begins you*
---
Nothing personal, kid
---
If you find someone offering a intervention, do send them my way as well, cause I'd likely need a lot more than 5 accounts.
---
Only for that session. It's a public resource that swaps owners.
---
Even if I only have one card equipped it still takes like 5 clicks to register. For example I only have 3 charisma and swap between lone wanderer and hard bargain, and after the patch I have to click the card around 5 times to get it to unequip.
---
I am on PC as well . My ign is Ivan. I gotta say.. that moment where you step out onto the world was just heavenly. I really did blurt out WOW... This has been by first online game I have ever played.... and its a whole new world.
---
Try alt-tab and select fo76, some app is taking focus away. Maybe a virus or something you installed. It also happens when you are in one app, close the app and it goes back to 76 (instead of the desktop). See if alt-tab fixes it first.
---
And hookers!
---
&gt;And really? Using Capitalist Pig" as an insult? 
---
Sounds like some Commies have infiltrated Vault 76.  Good on you for taking America's resources back from the Red scum.
---
I wouldn’t know. Have yet to successfully be able to connect since the update....
---
I’d probably prefer to not have a disk for this game and just a code instead to go along with the case honestly. It’s but a minor nuisance but a nuisance nonetheless. It’s still a really fun game imo, hope you enjoy as well
---
I've never had problems with any other online game I ever played on my PC. 
---
This game is substantially less stable than the Stalker series, which had a broken engine.
---
There's a way to swap out emojis, but I have to do this too...  dropped a bag, guy ignored it, then I got disconnected.  Offs...
---
It’s only yours during the session. If you are on a team at the time you Leave the server, it goes to your teammate
---
Yes, but, did you win?
---
Really enjoying the game and the communication but could you please look into the infinite loading screen bug („joining team“) in NW? I have to close the complete game after every single round of NW due to this. As soon as the teamleader starts the next round, he’s stuck in the „joining team“ loading screen. I‘m on PS4.
---
Besides that, looking forward to the next updates, really sounds exciting!
---
used 3 regular ones and they didnt count and the server disconnected. best battle royale ever
---
I had a 26 minute game if I recall correctly. It ended with a small circle that was in a nuked zone. I could not see the other guy anywhere so I just used my 1 radaway and that was enough to JUST stall out a win when the rads killed the enemy. 
---
My only other victory was a 24 minute game with another nuked final circle. The last guy had power armor and was having no issues with the rads while had used a rad-x, a radaway and 3 stimpaks to stay alive. Luckily I picked up and hand-made rifle from a SB someone else killed so I just ran in Rambo-style into the middle of the circle, saw him and shot him down. The Handmade is ridiculous.
---
Well.... I’ve just found it on eBay on AOs store for £10. I really can’t say no! Considering it’s £29.99 in the psn store!
---
.....Capitalist, not Communist.
---
I don’t see him doing hours upon hours of NW for lore.
---
Then again...
---
no I dont stream.. so thats another whole can of worms for you then...
---
I didn’t unfortunately, although did get a couple of new friends. May meet up when I’m a higher level for a graduation shot.
---
Me too!  Dropped a bag for a noob in the grass and it took both of us a while to find it.  Yea yea... I'm the real noob hwre...
---
Super cool lol
---
because people are sick of hearing it since it works for most players...
---
If any1 want to play br together add me. PS4 MaarifaPL
---
I think it's purposeful.  They want you to have to play either from the ground up in NW or level a character to 50 in adventure mode.  My issue is I have a level 50 character built for adventure mode, that can't use perks in nuclear winter because my character wasn't built with Charisma in mind and for instance Suppressor requires 9 in charisma to use.  If everyone starts at level 50, then you also need to allow for everyone that is already level 50 to change their special to fit this mode without it changing the status of the adventure mode character.  Which seems reasonable to me.  Because xp and caps are earned for your character in adventure mode, it makes it a bit tricky.
---
Ah ok, understand. Thank you mate
---
Epic win
---
10mm pistol
---
I'm too dumb to even know how to lock my extractors, but I wouldn't even if I knew how.
---
Never kills anyone to share after all.
---
That's simply not true. I run a commando build and always have some kinds of damage boosting drugs, takes at least 6 shots from a .45 SMG to take down a power armored person at close range. Something like an automatic laser rifle takes closer to 10. The only way you can possibly be dying that quickly is running some kind of glass cannon build
---
I wish I could hear other people.. thats all I want for NW...
---
If it was a big issue it would be a big red bullet on their page of stuff to fix or change. Tbh everyone is stuck in the mindset that laser and plasma guns are bad. So something simple as this wouldn’t matter. 
---
I play devils advocate with them. I love them and use them all the time and in a odd way love the lower damage they output. It fits what we know about them as weapons in the lore and the likes. 
---
The only thing I would change on them is the ammo counting. So instead of one cell/cartridge per shot. Make it one for X number of shots. Like a battery would.
---
I'll ignore the snark and keep this simple.  I killed dupers on stream.  I took their loot (specifically 31k flux and 21k ultracite) and threw away said loot once the dupers left.  Again, all on stream.  I was then suspended and it took Bethesda Support 2.5 months to even mention the fact that I was suspended due to that 31k flux and 21k ultracite, which again I did not keep.  Bethesda Support told me they would remove those items and then would unfreeze my account.  Again, I do not have those items on my account so there was nothing for them to remove.  My account has now been stuck in limbo for 5 months over 31k flux and 21k ultracite that for the last time, I did not keep and is not on my account.  I have included video clips and screenshots backing up my claims so I'd appreciate it if you took the attitude elsewhere.  Have a good one.
---
My adventure with the Mothman started early on.  
---
I was wandering through the forest South of Huntersville, where I made my first home.  It was a nice home.  My Super Mutant neighbors to the North never bothered me unless I came by asking for a cup of sugar (PSA:  Never ask a Super Mutant for a cup of sugar.  They just go berserk...) and it was near Top of the World where I met this friendly robot named Rose.
---
I was just outside of a campground in the forest and ran into a Wise Mothman.  By this point I had enough experience and encounters to have learned to always strike first.  But...  while I was killing him, he just seemed to sit  and stare at me with a "Why?  Just...  Why?" sad expression on his face.  I finished up and felt bad about killing such a harmless creature.
---
Flash for a couple of weeks and I see the same glowing eyes, just a different color, just down the street from where I lived.  Here was my chance to apologize, to try to make up with killing the Wise One.   As I approached with an apology on my lips, he attacked...  he was everywhere, and nowhere, at the same time with an angry buzzing that sent chills down my veins...  it was the Vengeful Mothman out for blood...  
---
Needless to say, I didn't fare well.  When I was given another life I realized that, like it or not, the Mothman feud had begun.  There wasn't anything that I could do to restore peace so I did what I had to.  I broke out my best weapons and took down the Vengeful Mothman...  it was the only thing that I could do...
---
There have been many skirmishes since.  I have put many Mothman family members into the group and it was weighing on me with every step I took.  I could feel the hardness growing in me and something had to be done about it...
---
Recently, I had an opportunity to commune with the Wise Mothman at the lighthouse.  I apologized for having started the feud and for killing his brothers.  I informed him that I too was now wise and that I would no longer hunt down his kind...  but....   if any of them attacked me unprovoked, I would finish it.   While not happy with the compromise, he seemed to accept it and we went our separate ways....
---
For me in beta it was battlebot. My level 38 ass was not prepared for sentry bots lol
---
I got frog legs around like 6 but I didn't have enough agility points lol
---
lmao 😂
---
Mad cause bad
---
Yep.  And grinding 1400 credits is hard on day 1.  Just take it and sell it, or even give it to someone else.
---
Manner people, manners ;-)
---
I'm the opposite, if my team is alive I'll charge in because even if I die, I expose where they are. If I'm solo I'll camp it out with any stealth boys I found
---
Flame jets!
---
It’s ok if you don’t like it. Don’t play it. Problem solved.
---
I spend so much time in shrubs I feel I am at one with nature lol 😂😂😂
---
The real danger of the wasteland.  Too many damned gifts.
---
Why is that a reason not to help the people it doesn't work for? Common bugs get posted all the time, no one downvotes them.
---
I really don't understand bethesdas decisions about what is hidden and what overrides what.
---
I haven't bought any costumes because they hide armour, and having modular armour parts over the top of your clothes is one of my favourite features, but at the same time costume hats take the same slot as hats with actual armour or stats for some reason.
---
And we can't hide backpacks?
---
I just don't get it at all
---
And I said that I took millions of weight in crafting materials and I still have my account - so I have to call BS on your story.
---
Best of luck.
---
The Gatling Plasma’s accuracy increases tenfold in third person compared to first person. Wtf is that big circle of a reticle anyways?! Sheesh.
---
Judging from PC player’s responses it seems like PC players’s accuracy with the Gatling plasma must be the accuracy of a storm trooper.
---
I know you said not searching for solutions but for others that are reading here, you can take pictures after you are full and they still count towards quests/achievements even though the pic is not saved.
---
Edit: It appears I'm wrong on this.
---
My recommendation is this: have three ranks of traveling pharmacy (str) and three ranks of pharma pharm (luck) and always search every medical bag, mirror, doctor bag, and chem container to stock up on stims and medical stuff. This will mitigate your rad and healing issues. 
---
As far as damage goes, invest in anything with armor penetration, and get glow sighted leveled up ( perception) armor penetration will hurt hard to damage enemies a lot more than you'd think. I don't want to spoil it for you and give more away, but this is a good start at least.
---
just a typo
---
Well i have played both fortnite and nuclear winter and i have a nephew that's sitting here playing it now fortnite that is and i seeing a dome that closes in on you just like on nuclear winter but the difference is it's a ring of fire not a dome and where do you find out your guns at and your armor in a box almost just like fortnite
---
It requires 9 luck. But it seems like it's really making an impact
---
Just a quick FYI  for this, this game uses your captured images for loading screens so if you spam the screenshot button be prepared to only have one boring loading screen forever.
---
How are u doing it? The quick swap and favorites wheel have always seemed like they were more than enough
---
I honestly only take workshops for the xp these days. 
---
Occasionally I take a power plant for fusion cores, but otherwise I don't care about the resources anymore.  Usually I don't even bother to build anything, and if I do I leave it unlocked for randos.
---
Awesome, enjoy the wasteland fellow vault dweller!
---
Man, I loved Stalker. Such good memories.
---
Speak for yourself... I'm sick of teammates dropping all around the map instead of together, waiting for you to die to loot you, suddenly solo vs full 4 deathswuad full power armor + gatling and more time on waiting room than actual game...
---
Wish I would encounter someone like you. I currently don’t even know how to repair my gun lol
---
Maybe its 5? I read something about it here last night and it worked twice for me
---
I 'doff' my cap to you - awesome :)
---
It does not work. Photo mode with a full album even if it doesn't save, does not trigger. I tested on my lunch break earlier. This only works with the prosnap deluxe.
---
You can of course reject the offer but you can’t just say without providing proof. I agree with OP.. you come to an agreement on a deal you stick to it, I’ve lost out on caps because of getting late offers but you don’t pull out when you agreed with another person and you don’t try to make them pay more either. On the market it’s a rule you can be banned for
---
alt-tab doesn't fix the issue, I've had this issue for awhile and can normally fix it by just putting the game in windowed mode, unplugging mouse, plugging it back in, and then full screen again but that doesn't work in this game
---
Probably just the Super Duper perk card 
---
I believe I have the plan. I can build it for u. PM me your gamertag. I'll be on shortly
---
Asking the real questions. Would be stoked to have my doggo back.
---
It's always difficult hearing different opinions from your own.
---
Shoot me a friend request. Like I said, I'm only on weekend mornings EST, but I'm willing to help where I can. It can be a grind early on, so I get that. A mic really helps in communicating your needs.
---
Out of all the suggestions I've ever seen in this sub this is the one I want the most!
---
Don’t sweat it bro I agree with you
---
Only a commie would use capitalist as an insult, no?
---
Reminds me of a song called “Superfly’s Johnson” by The Laziest Men On Mars
---
Ive found a workaround for that. It doesnt always work but try muting them, leave game, rejoin and unmute.
---
You have to leave your team for it to end.
---
What's the Bad Hair Female Icon look like?
---
I think it's pretty obvious that he meant he was a fan of Bethesda, not somebody who literally got paid by Bethesda to say good things about Bethesda. 
---
Or maybe you're right. Maybe he literally meant shill.
---
For sure.
---
Same way, it feels extremely clunky, and the response seems slow.
---
Bro, I am so sorry. I’ve never launched a nuke cause I keep rolling new characters so I can only imagine the disappointment. I don’t have too many issues myself with the game but I feel like that one would be a massive kick in the teeth.
---
Are we going to be getting a Summer Roadmap anytime soon?
---
nice one bud
---
Look awesome to me
---
I read about that too. It's probably just a skin just like the hellfire armor.
---
All the rewards will be revealed soon enough by people getting to the highest rank or datamining it. So far every reward is just a skin or cosmetic item. Also why would Bethesda put a new power armor in the game that could possibly be better than the ones we have now in a extremely grindy game mode? All the power armors that's useful is given to us by doing quests and the quests aren't even long. Bethesda likes to hand out good stuff for little to no grind involved so it wouldn't be fair to put a new power armor unlock in a game mode. It would make balancing issues in adventure mode. So that's probably why everything is just a skin or cosmetic piece to show off your rank from nuclear winter in adventure mode.
---
cheers chap
---
Ive done that before how many rifles and heavy leather armor ive made for others when i started a new player and was making my way down to flatwoods a dude waved me down i love it when your rewarded back puts a smile on my face
---
sound buddy
---
It uses workshop resources to build (mostly - they are green, yours are white). You take them for the resource extractors on site and the plans and experience they give. They all go back to the server and are unclaimed when you leave so someone else can farm those resources.
---
I don't know what you're building there, but it should just be the resource extractors, maybe some defense, maybe some crafting stations, definitely a stash box.
---
Or it's a hunting rifle with a long scope...  I think that it's the only two shot that's fairly accurate...  I lucked out on that drop and with the recent .50 cal buff it's a lot of fun for sniping.
---
Kinda defeats the purpose of showing how awesome I look in the dress 😏
---
Ok. That was really cool
---
Rant every day about it. Play the game every day the same way. Cry about it every day. We’ll keep enjoying it and it won’t impact us at all. Die mad about it.
---
Same. I was so close to buying it when it first came out but held off so I didn’t get disappointed. I’m glad I did because it seems to have turned around now, just a shame it had such bad press to begin with. I’ve now purchased it (£10 on eBay mind you do not a tonne!) and look forward to getting to grips with it more!
---
Disguting but good meme
---
I've had the one code for two days and it's still there.
---
My friend is level 6 I think now, he’s gotten bloody mess, nerd rage (I forget how many points he said that was to use) and another pretty good card.
---
Thanks for the tip! You mean after the previous round? Will try. But this is just a workaround, they have to fix this, since accepting or sending an invite sometimes also doesn’t work.
---
I’m mad at mama murmghr. 100 scrip and she gave me a vampire crossbow. Does she think I’m daryl Dixon?  I’ll give it 24 hrs gameplay before I scrip it too.
---
Trolls gotta troll I guess
---
Thanks!!!
---
I also would like to know if you won lol
---
Can you catch a disease in NW mode??? I ain't had a disease in that mode yet if you do.
---
Agreed. Furthermore, if people don't like this game, then don't play it. The real snowflake is the person who expects the devs to fix specific issues that curtail to their specific demands, rather than appreciating all of the work that has been put into fixing so many other issues in the game, meanwhile rolling out a stream of free content to us regularly. Trade in the game for something that fits your needs better. Or design one yourself.
---
I'll say it. Reddit is just as bad as Youtube, it's just that subreddits become circle jerks based on popular opinion because of the voting system. This sub is very positive about 76 while /r/fallout thinks the game is a joke.
---
Are these unlockable items available once you unlock them or is it just available for preview?
---
Are you sure they're your friends?
---
cant to that in NW
---
One cent off from being perfect
---
Unless u mean only the bag 😂😂
---
Haha glad I'm not the only one who thinks dishonor before death.
---
Probably not
---
Prizes* lol r/boneappletea?
---
Are you actually on a team with buddies or joining NW solo?
---
i doubt it, the disease is for adventure since i love foraging in the ash heap
---
me: ey bobby im home what happ..
---
*watch as the house is lit in flames and a behemoth is whirling bobby everywhere left &amp; right
---
Get the new custom.ini file from Nexus.
---
You might have to remove all your perks and get naked logout/login
---
Just guessing, I've not installed the update yet.
---
i still never have stimpacks or ammo
---
Got a pic of it by chance?
---
They havent made a thread with pics of the rewards.
---
Let me think about it...
---
You can’t.
---
How else are they supposed to make power armor even in nw? 
---
I made the same kind of post a few days ago and someone told me to think of it as a shield.
---
Darn.. try just mute and unmute them?
---
On my cap mue account lvl 3. some nice lvl 200 dropped me 20 dog food so I give the thumbs down and walk off he kept following me trying to give it to me lol
---
You know OP is talking about nuclear winter right ?
---
Additionally there's an entire story aspect that involves eagle scout type activities. Fishing absolutely belongs in this game
---
You can rejoin server by joining recent players
---
...yeah that would work for me.
---
I'm in. We're i have to sign?!
---
You aren’t supposed to gain scrip, maybe it was a bug?
---
This is awesome
---
Sorry to see you are having these problems 
---
It’s probably your system.  I have 2 PC’s.  Have no problems on the newer one (even on long 4+ hour sessions).  On my older notebook, the game does crash (approx. every hour) but it’s a 6-year old notebook.
---
Try changing the graphic settings - may help
---
Great game indeed.
---
Sadly the unstable engine limited its potential.
---
my elder BoS coat is clipping with my hair
---
Yes, allow us to flair our system and add our gamer tag if we want.
---
Yeah I wish there was a way I could just walk out with my hands up at the end and face my inevitable fate.
---
Your character looks like she'd steal my girl, and that is totally okay with me. Do you have any lore around her or anything? I didn't with mine at first, but now I'm kinda in love with my character (now that I figured out how to properly spec into the SPECIAL).
---
Sending you an invite. My name is the same as here.
---
Same. No complaints. Pvp is so rare in adventure mode that it’s almost not worth talking about.
---
It’s brilliant, I’m so excited for the next couple updates .
---
 Between this and nms I’m set.
---
You haven't been everywhere in the game apparently.
---
I’ve seen that mod before, but I know that the backpack will still be visible for everyone else, so...the western duster is good enough for now.
---
Are you using left on the dpad to switch back to your last weapon?
---
The Tanagra Town buried statue could be regarded as somewhat connected
---
Maybe this sub just doesn’t like assholes. Good job crafting armor though
---
that outfit makes you chubbier an without defined sex it's great xd
---
Oh??? Where do I need to go??
---
Imagine having to unlock lore by playing another battle royal mode when you have. ZERO interest in pvp
---
Of course it would be fair to make it only unlockable in a certain game mode.. how’s it different than the weekly weapons in survival? You should play to get things, you shouldn’t be given everything in the game for free or little to no effort. Where is the sense of pride once you get something when every other person you pass is going to have it, nothing special about it so who would want it. 
---
I’m not saying anything either way honestly. Skin, new armor set doesn’t matter to me I don’t like using PA so I wouldn’t be interested anyway. Just saw that in the terminal and thought I’d mention it :)
---
It's been a crazy/awesome ride from beta until now!  Really excited to see what you have in store for us and the future of this game!
---
Thanks to you and the whole team for working through the challenging start and seeing your hard work paying off this week!
---
Hey You. I like you. You are braindead too.
---
Power armor is junk no matter which mode you play. The only big perk for power armor is heavy guns and radiation resist. Any other situation, regular armor benefits weapons and resist better.
---
For those still hung up on insisting to use power armor, I have no argument and urge you to keep using power armor. Some people love easy kills. Lol.
---
I was sure it worked according to others I have spoken with. I edited my other comment to say I'm incorrect though. Perhaps it was changed in an update recently? Thanks for the information/clarity.
---
Delve the depths of Lucky Hole Mine
---
That’s the exact look I want to go for. Does any have a recommendation on outfits that fit with that? I’m thinking of getting a gas mask too. Is there a cool looking headpiece that also protects against airborne stuff?
---
Plague doc mask prevents disease now
---
Reading about people complaining about people giving their opinions and being pissed off about it just pisses me off.
---
They should scrap to charcoal.
---
87 levels and I've only seen the red eyed version. I'm glad to know this game still has lots more for me to find and explore!
---
Dont miss. Communicate with your team to focus fire enemies. Play stealthy. Usually if someone shoots you before you even know they're there, you should lose. If winning was as simple as just finding a power armor suit this game would be trash.
---
Fertilizer and cloth left on your pillow.
---
Yep. Seemingly nobody had power armor, hazmats or radaway to combat the nuke zone cause the remaining people were dropping like flies. I killed 2 stragglers running around and I was halfway dying from the rads when the last guy died from  either the storm or the rads.
---
My traveling leather coat with its own backpack shows the front of my marine armor over the front of the coat. 🙈
---
Why didn’t someone go into build mode and edit a door out?
---
Or just ‘move camp’ would have packed you right up
---
Stealth Boys are actually so op, especially with explosives. Atleast that's my experience, it could be that my enemies just suck
---
This. It seems this game has players that think new players need help, which granted isn't a bad thing. But so far I've found the game very easy, not saying it won't get harder, thanks for being kind, but some rather earn then get charity that's how we're raised, right? Plus that's part of the game. It's not like this is a massive pvp slaughterfest for new players where they desperately need something to survive, that said if it was  that then people wouldn't be so willing to handout, they'd probably be dicks. Maybe the game gives out too much. 
---
How is Survival vs Adventure?
---
If you get kills
---
The server doesn't crash for me every five minutes.  I play on XBox as well as PC.
---
I've also never seen an enemy disappear.  But then again, if they disappear, I wouldn't see it.  So...
---
How do I emote?!
---
We were fortified in a pre-existing structure with no other exits.
---
i like all my text fonts super small, size slider would be great
---
Still better than offering a wasteland credit card lol
---
I will try my best to do restore my integrity
---
Or getting called a moron straight after the purchase
---
bloodied all the way, you can use basically any weapon you want if it’s bloodied and it’ll still be even somewhat viable so switching around doesnt need a dozen points to respec. even non-bloodied weapons can be really good because of adrenal reaction and nerd rage.
---
and if there’s something that i feel like i dont want to waste time on, i’ll just take my bloodied deathclaw gauntlet and take it out in usually just one hit.
---
Not sure how I feel about this. Play with my missus and going to get a bit weird if we both have romance-able companions.
---
Truth, but you're not allowed to have a negative opinion of the game in this sub.
---
I wouldn't take these guys seriously, the wasteland has no rules lol
---
Wow what an idiot. Be glad the free trial ends on the 17th. Let's hope they fix this fast.
---
Hahaha!
---
No I don’t have any lore for my character but I definitely want to, never even thought about it! I’ll start thinking about a background for her. Now that I think about it that’s probably why it’s called a RPG lol
---
I would love to hear your characters lore if you don’t mind telling me! If you don’t want to I will totally understand
---
Then don’t try anything with them, it’s up to you. ;)
---
Thank you for being understanding you made my day
---
....help with what?
---
Isn’t that not connected? Or do we not know yet?
---
Full customizable combat text would be amazing. Size, color, font, duration.
---
If you're gonna drop a nuke, you atleast need some form of protection. No point in dropping one if you end up dieing from the rads.
---
Thank you! Been really enjoying the improvements. I always look forward to the 'Inside the Vault' posts so please keep doing those! Can't wait to see what's next.
---
Also can you send a thank you to the people who made it so you can see where other players have spawned at the start of Nuclear Winter. It's so hype. I laugh with excitement every time I see eleven other players chose the same spot. Edit: That might sound sarcastic but it's not. It's awesome.
---
*truth is, the game was rigged from the start*
---
Woah dude, I just commented on the other post. The Brotherhood of Steel tag you have fits both posts so perfectly lolol
---
Has anyone helped yet?
---
Hi there! I live in Brazil, and I would like to buy a copy so my daughter may play the game too. Someone knows where to find the best price for a digital version?
---
Each to their own. I played Fortnite and couldn't stand it. This is, on paper, the same experience but for whatever reason it's a fun diversion.
---
What do the crates give you

Yea I guess it does one part dick one part honor. I guess I'm elder maxson
---
Ive been trying to do the emote i cant find it
---
Heh. I filled up the chest in the Flatwoods church. Looked at the map a few minutes later and saw 5 noobs at the church standing around, went back and filled it up again
---
How
---
I‘m on a team.
---
Everyone deserves a second chance and glad to see your helping the new folk joining, if they have a good 1st experience they will be playing along side us for years to come and keep the game alive and healthy, they may even pass the kindness on 👍
---
Newbie here, no problem with ammo, but thanks for being kind. What's in my future to be kind with others? Are there many things in the game you have to friendly up with?
---
Stimpak hotkey prioritizes the worst one, just dedicate a normal favorite bar to extra or normals
---
You're my favorite person
---
It's the wasteland, man. Just do whatever you want, not everything is black or white. I have destroyed many CAMPS and killed many players, but I have also helped them.
---
So yeah, play how you like. Just don't be toxic over the mic or anything like that, of course.
---
Hahahaha! That sounds hilarious! I would've loved to see that myself!
---
Or even just a messenger bag, if they don't want to figure out purses.
---
TSE is always a solid choice. The current meta is using bloodied weapons and sitting at 20% health or less for nerd rage and adrenal reaction and a full set of unyielding armor. Damage numbers get stupid high. But if you dont like dying whenever an enemy sneezes in your direction the best prefixes are Two shot and antiarmor, with explosive or faster fire rate. Executioners is great for enemies like SBQ and Sheepsquatch. I personally like to always keep an instigating or bloodied dragon in my back pocket for initiating fights. Troubleshooter gear is good for silo runs. Ghoul slayer/zealots for farming nuke zones.
---
No, like it activates when you crouch. But makes the bag invisible when equipped as a mod
---
I can understate if I actually looted it and there wouldn't be any the next time.  I hadn't played in like 2 days prior so the timing thing would of worn off from previous run at them putting something in them I'd think.  I'll try and do some investigation in a completely different spot.  I think I may have another bobblehead in my stash
---
Gulpers....   all they need are different species of Gulpers with different skins, different sizes, and different types of fins and ridges.  
---
Land one and it stands up and attacks.....
---
The acoustics on the vault are pretty good :»)
---
Its not worth the 5 min to post. So far the sloth is by far the best
---
You know that I am as well? The .45 smg is fucking garbage in survival mode, it would take at least 15 shots to kill anybody in PA
---
refund xd
---
Thanks! Is it ok to put that link up top and credit you for it?
---
So you're only giving us the cheap stuff. I'm not a beggar, just a chooser. :)
---
Ah never had that happen before. Run through all your processes and shut down one at a time until you narrow it down. Sorry couldn't help more, I thought Alt-tab would fix it.
---
I don’t think it’s an emote, it’s a pose in photo mode.
---
My new pilgrimage.
---
The only time I'm toxic is during nuclear winter because fuck I die a lot
---
Thoughts as a fallout 76 player who has been playing since launch - I agree with most of what you have said, with some notable exceptions. 
---
I do not want it to be free to play, first and foremost. If you like the game, it is worth the purchase price, and making it a game that needs to be purchased keeps the number of griefers/exploiters etc down. If it were free people who got accounts banned would just make new accounts.
---
Second, I love the lobby. If you're just there for the battle royal aspect, I could see why you wouldn't, but as a player who likes adventure mode who has been playing since launch, the lobby is fun and full of lore. I want to play music with the band, I want to go up into the overseer's office and taunt the lowbies who can't get in, I want to take a shower while I swap perk cards and banter with my team over strategy before the match starts.
---
Also, there are other great guns, but that's a matter of personal preference and I play on PC so I don't have to worry about crutches for a controller user.
---
You're an ATTEMPTED scammer who ended up helping the people. So... Take it how you will but the general consensus about scammer/griefers is well known. It just didn't work out in your favor this time.
---
You're factually hilarious to read because of your misinformation. 
---
You want to be a bullet sponge?  Go play Apex and cod. This is a survival RPG game. You let your guard down or someone gets the jump on you: you're dead. Nothing wrong with different styles and mechanics. 
---
Hilarious you call it a copy but you're literally asking it to be like other BRs 😂😂😂
---
Different styles bro. Dont have to like it. But also dont have to make yourself sound like an idiot. Although it was entertaining to read.
---
I wish u could upvote multiple times..
---
I found one in the green lockers at wavy Willard’s.
---
10/10 didn’t happen shitpost.
---
Anyone know what level you get the Large NW Stash at?
---
Lol, this is how it feels to be a Battlefront 2 fan, and now I’m part of both community’s hahaha
---
I found one in a green storage box, the wooden one not ammo. At the top of a tower lookout near watoga.
---
RIP Biv-no-friends.

Replace bobby with Bobby B and watch him rule the camp as a true king.

That would be legit, I want a full brotherhood squad

---
In what game mode? And have you sat there and looked it it for awhile? Perhaps it just does that periodically, or maybe it does that when you reach a marked quest location
---
Yes!! NW makes it so you can completely ignore the start game drag of leveling up. Im playing NW on my new account and have already gone up 5 levels without touching adventure mod. Havent even stepped foot in Flatwoods yet.
---
Nothing I said could be considered a handicap.
---
You guys are great. I appreciate all of the hard work you and your team have put in. You have taken the "High Road" wherever there has been criticism, but more importantly, you have been receptive to feedback. I really can't ask for much more than that. Thank you for the world of Fallout.
---
You're in a location you need to search
---
Crap, someone did that the other day, I had no clue what he was doing.
---
It’s so bad I just turned it off and played Destiny 2
---
Oh thought you said you did it. Lol. Ok, so hover over your wave and (on xbox) hit RB and you see more options. 
---
Look on bottom of your wheel and you'll see that option on some emotes to select more in that category if you have them. 
---
😁😁❤❤
---
why someone put -1 karma on this comment loll?
---
Yes thanks anyway
---
Like when there’s an area the map wants you to go to (heart of the enemy for example) when you enter the area your compass will glow, indicating you’re in the are the quest wants you to be in
---
Hey Bethesda! Can you get this message to Todd? I love him
---
Anybody say yes yet? Because yes.
---
Cool, just making sure. Have a great game.
---
They have the perk cards now, and chems
---
Do a point in slugger, and a point in master slugger to get 30% instead of 20%.
---
Good points, but I think the real problem is all the legendary effects that fubar any kind of balance in the game.  Full Sentinel armor and explosive weapons all bought from dupers off of discord and Reddit are the real problem.  Everything else you mention is equal for everyone, meaning I have access to it too.  If the only thing they did to battle Royale mode was get rid of everyone's equipment and let them start out with no equipment, it still would have worked and quite honestly would have made battle royale even better and still balanced.  As it is, in Nuclear winter, because the OP perc cards are now random lottery RNG and not just something you get when you reach a certain level, they have become the new OP factor in that mode, like the TSE was.  At least the Perks can't be duped and sold, at least not yet.
---
You are correct I am a scammer I take full responsibility for it. my actions have been stained and they will remain a part of my character. I wish I could go back to those new players and give them their money back
---
Yep. Seen it. They're after the scorpion or the wendigo, whichever spawns. I can only imagine they've already farmed all the possum badges.
---
That doesn't exactly work well when in the heat of battle and spamming the D-Pad.
---
You too!
---
Not a bug. A balance thing they decided on. Shotguns are POWERFUL so maybe they figured you focus on shotguns you're strong but limited?
---
Sadly this did happen and I've received negative consequences because of it. I'm here taking accountability for my actions.
---
It's not gate unique items to fishing or never put them in the game, those are not the only two options here.
---
The only insult I ever seem to receive is him walking past me to insult the guy behind me. 😢
---
What about a satchel or a small tactical pouch on your jacket or pants
---
This is a fan forum, the mods don't work for Bethesda. You can open a ticket at https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10, but they'll tell you they don't have the tools to restore items.
---
The community managers include /u/ladydevann, /u/valseek, /u/jessbethesda (among others), probably the best they can do is gather some info and have the devs check into why it happened.
---
This sucks, but you're probably SOL.
---
I'm sorry I pre-ordered so soon. And it's the same core game engine since FO3.
---
ah, well that explains why i cant hit anyone lol
---
YEAHHH GO BGS!! Seriously, love what you guys are doing. I play 76 consistently; one of the only games I've bee. Playing since release. 
---
I've never been attracted to Battle Royale games, but of course I had to try this one, and I'm loving it! Small note, I love that I can still enjoy this mode without being good at it, and just have competitive and cooperative fun. You've really innovated with this mode; it's not like any other Fallout experience I've had, but I don't feel like I'm playing something other than Fallout. Brilliant.
---
This whole game has the potential to be a living classic, something special about Fallout games in particular. Keep up the good work!!
---
Totally.
---
Damn, that’s the worst kind
---
What consequences?
---
My team always sucks. Almost every single time. And the one time I had a really good team 3 of us were like 5 seconds from winning when the server crashed.
---
You trying to pick this here bloodleaf I see.....no you’re not, you’re gonna drink some of this toxic parasite infested water, nice, and, slow!
---
To be honest negative karma and a lot of hate
---
Both glad and sad to see others experiencing the same issue as I am.
---
#Bethesda please fix!
---
Can we kill them?
---
I'm more worried about the hate than the karma though
---
Hi all worried about the hate than the karma though, I'm dad.
---
Some people have said they have to completely restart the game every time after playing NW.
---
That’s consequences for posting something; not consequences for doing it. Still a shitpost.
---
There's a bug related to Atom skins and losing stars. I've seen it enough that I'm removing all skins from my items until it's resolved.
---
Ofc its Free for a week.
---
Im just gonna play NW till it settles.
---
I only have 2 tanks of pharmacy, these perks don’t affect your stash so I don’t really bother.
---
Ammo is hard - no arguments there. In early game, try to use multiple weapons (so you can use many weapon types) and keep a melee weapon for anything under your level.
---
But at lv20ish you should dilute all your stimpacks (double your stash) and know how to make healing salve. Also, never use stimpacks outside of combat. Set up multiple water purifiers at your camp and grab water regularly - then use those to heal while not in combat.
---
How can you possibly spot every little stimpak and various small things hidden in the game while in 3rd person?
---
My best guess is NPCs related to quests are essential, while randomly generated NPCs are not essential.
---
Where have you been I haven't seen you since you left 15 years to the gas station
---
Downloading the new update now, I’ll look for ya
---
how do you play together intentionally?  I still haven't figured that out.
---
Then just look on the wiki 🤷‍♂️
---
You are correct take my post how you will
---
Theyre icons, not loot boxes.
---
It's funny giving new players Nukashine and not telling them the about the black out part. They see the increase unarmed damage and get excited.
---
I like NW but I like adventure mode much more. Wish it wasn't so compromised right now but hey, if it gets new folks in, I'll deal with it
---
Edited my comment.
---
ATTEMPTED scammer. You didn't.
---
Fully unlocked for both modes
---
You're right, I haven't played Survival much, because it sucks and is unbalanced and unfair to people who want a more challenging PVE experience, but that's just me.
---
It really shouldn't be called "Survival", that name really evokes a more challenging PVE experience to me, not a mode where I have to deal with assholes killing me every 5 seconds because they have overpowered equipment because they have all the free time in the world to grind for that stuff, and again, that's just my opinion.
---
You are of course entitled to your own opinion, and I respect it, but don't call people out just because they have a different opinion than you, it's not very constructive.
---
Right on, thanks for sticking with the game and listening to player feedback.
---
Your first auto rifle will likely be a 38 pipe rifle.  You may also find a L10  308 sniper rifle on a rooftop.
---
The sniper is good for taking out supermutants from a safe distance, then you can get a 38 pipe (or better) from one of them.
---
Meantime, fireaxe or machete are your best friends.
---
I've played the hell out of 3, NV, and 4, but i never picked this one up just because it was said to be bad, and i didn't want to waste my money. I will definitely buy it now. I'm having fun.
---
I stand corrected, I’ve never seen that before but it looked cool!
---
This this this this this this this this this this this this
---
I'm level 221 and have been surrounded by single and low double figure players since Nuclear Winter went live, but I've seen a few high level players too occasionally, saw a 500+ earlier @ Watoga.
---
So I think it's just most of, or at least a large number of older players have now moved on to Survival and NW.
---
Thanks! I appreciate your answering! 
---
I was full at one point, however, and it didn’t work (the 50 picture cap is super dumb too). 
---
I haven’t tried this solution, yet but with digging around this sub, someone said they scrapped and rebuilt their camera and it started working again.  Will try it later today.
---
Thought the same its just for a week then it will settle a little. Its just good plyerbase is expanding and in a month or two they wont be noobs anymore and can then start buying our stuff.
---
Or you could delete 76. Download fo4 or less. And be happy with the choices u made.
---
It would be nice bit i think that xp boosts would be better. Only 20 xp for a kill and 10 for a down? Kinda ridiculous.
---
The only issue I had were the Charisma cards, all the other SPECIAL stacked cards selected just fine. I thought it was my mouse button having issues at first lol
---
Lmao exactly. I want x01 mods but no one is buying anything!
---
I'm having weight problems because I'm finding more plans than I'm selling at this point. Not even bothering putting legendary heavy guns in my machine, nobody a high enough level to use them will come to my camp this week
---
I have no performance issues at all. It may have something to do with the  time of day. I've played it after two hours and it runs a bit better. Thanks for a constructive comment.
---
The Amazon version doesn't come with a CD at all, it's just a download code. You should be able to do that just fine, from an 'entering the code' perspective if you're on PC.
---
Hell yes add fishing! I have my own dock on a lake and would love just to pop a chair and have a mini game of fishing. Want to spice it up add a chance encounter to spawn a Mirelurk king, add a couple stars.. who gonna eat who now btch!  Boom upvote op thread love it.
---
This is ridiculous. I literally just woke up and bought elder masons coat and 1500 atoms for $9.99. I really wanted to support Bethesda but now I don't even want to play!
---
I don't want to get murdered in survival, so I'll prob just try to stick it out in adventure.
---
It's a known issue. No fix. No prevention. Best to not put skins on at the moment.
---
Wood armor from purveyor is also losing a star when logging out. (Edit- this was apparently fixed this past Monday.)
---
Highly probable
---
Fair enough
---
V true
---
You got two?  Teach me, Master.
---
tbh Power Armor helps with being a Heavy Gunner, because you only get the 45% armor penetration when you are in a power armor. Also, they have really cool atom shop skins haha, that's why I use 'em in PvE
---
Using the Power Armor in NW is actually suicide though
---
Yep. Happened to me the other day. A level 300+ player just camped out on the roof. So I didn’t feed the fire and tanked the event.
---
You could always head over to Deathclaw Island. That's what I do.
---
Deathclaws dont drop them afaik
---
The comeback and effort that you guys have put in since launch truly defines who y'all are as a company! THANK YOU. Thank you to all of those who put effort into making this what it is. Sometimes the roughest starts end with the best story.
---
I can relate to having a tough time with mobs early on.
---
My solution was:
---
- long range: hunting rifle from crouched position to get the 2x sneak damage bonus;
---
- change to melee (Fire Axe or Sledge Hammer) for close combat.  Don’t forget to put some points into Strength 
---
- Born Survivor perk (in Agility). 1 level is best.
---
so there is no way a team member can store/scrap a wall or furniture in my camp?
---
I have, I’ve played in totally different sessions, hours apart.
---
Can I get a $53 refund? Lol
---
Stupid question, but how do I do this on the PS4?
---
The wood armor, at least, was fixed monday.
---
Agree with everything, accept for mutations.  Mutations are as much of my build as my special and I and you have the choice to have them or not, and I think you come into the game just like you did as a level one out of the vault and have to scrounge for what you get, and when you die to a player or a mob you lose everything on you, like you lose all your junk now.

oh wait, hides, sorry, I thought this was like deathclaw hands/paws/claws. I'm sorry. 😅
---
I seen a level 146 in the flatwoods town with like 15 level 2-6 scattered around him. Gave me the feeling of a Shepard and his sheep.
---
I think it's the same in adventure mode. Bethesda really needs to fix this.
---
No, they can do it if you are in a workshop and are in the same group. but not on the camp
---
Love you guys
---
I dont watch any of the people youre talking about but the reason people railed the game was because it was objectovely bad. I found some fun in it but at the end of the day it was a shit product. 
---
People need to destroy these games because it affects the companys dollar. Its the only way you can keep them accountable. 
---
The bottom line is bethesda released a broken, buggy, bland, unoptimised, rehashed mess of code and assets for 60 dollars. It was the very definition of minimal viable product.  
---
Yeah sure theyre improving the game but thats not the point. Bethesda doesnt get cookie points for fixing thier mistake. The game as it is now probably still needs another 3-6 solid months of work before i even consider it a full game. 
---
Bethesdas practice lately of releasing garbage for the community to fix should be railed against. It should not have released in that state and we as gamers develop Stockholm because they "improve the game over time". 
---
Its a bad precedent and its becoming normal for consumers to be their paid focus groups for their shit work.
---
Have you tried to spawn in lower populated areas?
---
I mean you would think hides would drop from deathclaws....
---
How much does bloody mess give? I'm making a list and I don't have that one.
---
You could try *not using it* that might solve the issue
---
this is the perfect time to do the X0-1 qauntum paint unmarked quest
---
I started yesterday. I wish I'd done so sooner, but I came in on the trial. This game is not bad at all, and I hate the internet for what it did to its image at this point. I'll be getting the full game once I get my next paycheck.
---
They seem to run from the tattered mascot outfit too, maybe it's my extra flame mod or that I just stand there and watch. But it freaks some out
---
You need to invest in weight reduction armor.
---
I would love to be able to catch Hellbenders and  Gar in a Fallout game
---
With the latest patch they added a dot for first person on a lot of the heavy guns, including the gatling plasma and .50 cal. For me its helped a lot
---
I have yet to see this damn bot. 
---
I WANT TO BE INSULTED, TOO!!! 😖😩😥😢😭
---
Death is the most permanent cure.
---
Or a fanny pack? 😂😂
---
Might be good for some outfits but not sure how that would go with my dress.
---
sure
---
As far as I know, the one who finishes off a downed player gets the kill.
---
Every weapon seems to be well balanced in NW, except Handmade. It's questionably strong.
---
That's pretty clever, thanks I'll do that for my next two level ups
---
Yes, they need to be nerfed. I can't count how many enemies I've killed so far while using a Stealth Boy + Grenade Launcher this far, it's impossible to beat.
---
Honestly, if they just disable legendaries in Survival I think itd be fine.
---
In case someone else is looking at this and doesn't run any mods, I had tweaked my .ini long ago and fixed it by removing my Fallout76.ini and Fallout76Prefs.ini file from c:\users\%username\Documents\My Games\Fallout 76 folder. I then started the game to recreate them and it fixed my problem. I just had to remap my key bindings and it was all good.
---
I’ve actually been enjoying it.
---
All the low levels are making it so that the odds of me doing uranium fever either alone or with just my team are sky high. I also get to farm legendary mobs in the bog if I’m lucky enough for a horde of ghouls to spawn.
---
The ones that stay will level up soon enough, and having some lower level players on the servers should make the SBQ interesting again!
---
I also can’t wait for them to start the imposter event, like without 1900 caps going out the window 😎
---
Thats on my to-do list. I'm trying to get the plans for it too though. Me, being a filthy casual, did not realize I could get the plans when I was doing I Am Become Death. So I don't have them, and I don't really think now is a great time to attempt a nuke lol.
---
I've never seen someone use a stealth boy
---
if you do an emote and you are walking or are not standing still in any way you will do a little salute wave instead it works for any emote
---
So I’ve been tinkering with the character creator since this post and just realized If you have Fallout 4, start a new game and look through Face 1 for the preselected face/blemishes/markings for default Nate. Or visit a surgeon. A lot of the character creator was carried over (with new stuff obvi) but you can essentially end up with the same thing if that’s something you want.
---
Ahahahha sorry bud, my fault
---
It's not difficult to swap to those when you need them. 
---
Unless you like being a crazy clepto who hits people. You definitely don't need to have them on all the time. I swap perk cards constantly depending on what I am doing.
---
You could max all those. Take the combat ones out after you are done looting and with Max carry and no combat, fast travel back to your base and unload. Then reequip those combat cards and go nuts.
---
It's normal that PvP in general (not just BR) is a bit frustrating at first. If you keep playing, you will surely improve fast.
---
I salute them for that. Instead of abandoning their game, they have listened to their players' feedback and improved Fallout 76 significantly. I can't wait to witness the emergence of human NPCs and to truly resettle Appalachia!
---
I would just say keep a keen eye. It doesnt seem to be too OP but it is nice. Its rare enough to not be a usual nonsense death but it provides a tactical advantage. Its not necessarily a guarenteed god equipment as you can run for cover to escape from an invisible enemy. I can see it having a reduced timer but doing what you propose literally goes against what the aid does.
---
It's all good, i'll give it a try later, I'm grateful you even tried to help :)
---
Thats the point.
---
eh, the bug only happens if you apply a atom shop weapon skin on a weapon, so it has to be an other bug,
---
Stealth plus anything really.
---
Game rocks!!
---
You rock. Thanks.
---
I was about to make a post asking since I didn't know either.
---
Heigh-Ho! Thanks for the Silver, stranger!
---
Yeah 7 months later.
---
Yeah because those skins have been applied for months. In fact,  only 1 of 2 items have a skin .
---
Yeah I just wanted to make sure. I encountered this exact same thing last night. Just leave your team and ‘joining’ will be replaced with ‘play.’
---
Whoa. You glitched the emote wheel and picked an emote from your favorites wheel. Haven't seen that glitch before.
---
I've never seen that emote either. I haven't seen them all but that one's new to me.
---
Go back to emotes. Hover over the heart again and hit the EXPAND button. (Xbox is rb, not sure on PC or ps4). Is the emote in that expanded list?
---
I kill him every time I see him.
---
No one makes fun of my mom and gets away with it!!!!
---
I really just do it cause my friend hasn’t been insulted yet and I want to prolong that injustice.
---

Your username made me think of the Cake song, "Friend is a four letter word"
---
Being able to quickly switch between locking/hacking cards, or my camp cards the mean I restore hp, building camp items costs less and I don't get as hungry/thirsty in my camp really makes the game so much easier. 
---
I don't understand why people are against it's a mod as it's the same as changing the cards myself, just less time consuming and means I have more time to play the game more, instead of spending a few minutes changing cards when I want to do something different like build in my camp, sell some items with hard bargain, or lockpock a safe.
---
It is a bit clunky but you get used to it. Honestly not sure how to improve it really.  You'll get used to planning your swap guns when running around. Tou can do it in pipboy. Equip main, equip another you want as backup, equip main again.
---
No problem!
---
Yeah felt the same way, keep trying, it gets better
---
Yea got the grafton tracksuit for the same purpose. Opened a ticket that I wanted to use it in NW and then it wasnt usable there I asked for a refund. As it was my first time asking for a refund I got it.
---
But yes I agree should be able to use other underarmor’s in nuclear winter. Maybe even add the base ones in game to the owned menu just for variety.
---
In fallout 76. Its on PC, Xbox and PS4. 🤪
---
Thank you guys for sticking with it, and Ad Victoriam
---
Use your Mic and let them know they need to contribute. I've given others an earful for not helping
---
I've never had any issues getting ammo. Only ammo I craft is .50cal as I use a lot fighting the Queen. Other than that everything is found off dead enemies.
---
You are welcome, it is a pleasure to help build this awesome game with you, Bethesda is and will always be the best gaming company, thank you for all the hard work you put on fixing the bugs and dealing with all the issues.
---
Earlier today I played with my friend who said he wouldn't buy the game because of all the backlash, I'm waiting to hear his final conclusion but we had an absolute blast roleplaying.
---
Thank YOU for everything, you are all breathtaking!
---
Honestly would have a Mr. Handy do that. Human NPCs should be someone significant to you like I stated earlier. He/she could be your spouse, slave, adopted slave child, etc.
---
Yes pls, I don't have a Mike and when I want to leave something for the lower lvl players)(stims, rad-away, ammo ect) and do the gift emote they just take off sometimes.
---
Damn I ran into every bug shown in vids besides 2.
---
I cant expand it
---
The aid should be used as a means of flanking your enemies by running out into the open without being seen, and then moving behind them for a surprise attack.
---
Rushing someone and just spraying them while remaining invisibile is disgustingly strong.
---
Keep track of how many expired ones you have, and spam the d-pad that many times.
---
Works for me.
---
For a rifleman build, it is one of the best guns in the game especially with the right legendary affixes. You can buy plans from vendor bot. Uses .45 caliber rounds.
---
You can do it by using the wave emote while running, try it yourself. I think when you went through the hotkey/emote wheels quickly it may have bugged out and let you do it while you were standing still.
---
me too. Same reasons.
---
That, and locked extractors invite PVP.
---
I'm sure the Brotherhood of Steel will be making a return in the next year or so to "try" to take control of Appalachia. Would be cool to see them flying around in Vertibirds or patrol with Fort Defiance as their base again.
---
*\*grabs fatman\**
---
This happened to my boyfriend and I while playing today! We were hesitatant at first cause we play red dead, but it was such a nice surprise :)
---
No I'm serious in every match I've played no one has even used a stealth boy, of course you cant see them, but the stealth boys are not showing up in the loot pools
---
don’t die
---
ok i see thanks!
---
Interesting, I died several times just walking around my camp...
---
Call it responder radio and boom
---
Is there proximity chat?
---
They use .45 ammo. You can modify a fair bit on them to suit your uses. Worthwhile if you get an explosive shot version. Have a couple myself, quad capacity, 15% faster fire rate, and a TSE  as well. My 'thin out that mob' gun.
---
You can buy the plans about 1500 caps  at one of the robot vendors at Whitesprings.
---
It helps anyways
---
Hahaha
---
Not sure if it makes a difference, but anyojne with a technical background would probably ask which system you're on.
---
Wait what
---
Only thing this is really missing to make it feel like fallout.
---
Even if he is invisible to other players and doesn't do anything to the game world...I miss my best boy.
---
1. In your "DATA" in your Pipboy you can choose which quests are currently shown.
---
2. Level 50.  You can choose to move 1 point every level beytond that or take a card.
---
3. They level with the highest player in the area, outside of the forest.  
---
4. Nope.
---
+15% damage with all weapons. It also gives you the explodey effect on enemies, but I doubt that changes anything. People still get downed as usual
---
 Is there proximity chat on PS4 version? Like can you talk to random people near you
---
You must be fun at parties
---
Elder Battlecoat, Western Duster(Preston Outfit), Miner Outfit works with the shovel backpack, the enclave gas mask, raider mask with hoses/straps and air flight helmets provide the protection.
---
I also think the upcoming Cage Armor is going to be a separate Outfit and Helmet too incase you fancy that later on.
---
I use either gladiator or slugger. These take 9 pts. Then i use martial artist which is another 3. I had to preplan a majority of my build.
---
 I have s14 p5 e4 c9 i5 a11 L8. I need intell at 5 for the repair and mod perks. Charisma at 9 to share perks. Luck atleast t for starched and bloody mess. Agility for ap cost reduction.  Endurance and strength are lacking. 
---
I wish they make it so max level for a special is 15. I think unlocking that would be much more healthy.
---
Deadly
---
I think
---
Thanks for sticking with fallout 76 even after the immense backlash. i'm very happy the game is getting better and better. once the BR is out of beta and we have Human NPC's with dialogue tree's, choice and consequence etc. the game will be even better. keep it up Bethesda.
---
Yeah I thought the same but you get used to it. R is reload and also drop in the pipboy. Then T is perk cards from pipboy. When first started I'd go tab-T and swap cards fast. I did tab-R (accidentally) and dropped whatever was highlighted at the time xD
---
I don't do it anymore, finally have the muscle memory down but the ui is counter intuitive.
---
Also feel free to add me on Xbox GT: AtypicalWave89
---
Completely reinstalled the game, deleted all config files and it's still not working. What am I doing wrong, the changes are in Adventure mode, right? Am I being dumb?
---
Love it guys!!
---
It's free for the next couple of days, why not just try it yourself?
---
How do I do the heart hands emote here in Reddit?
---
Just... imagine I'm doing the heart hands emote, BGS.  You friggin' rock.
---
I've been playing survival for a few hundred hours. My main gun is a one star AA handmade. It's not TSE Lase Rifle Sparkle Gun. But I can kill with it.
---
It's called survival cause it's hard to survive. I'm not calling you out on your opinion cause it's not your opinion. It's the same dogma that's constantly reposted here for karma. Survival should be base FO76 with no restrictions. That's like a basic need to some people.
---
I get killed often but it's not like what you read on here. I don't die at spawn points. I don't die at train station. And I believe the endgame of survival will be the best way to play Fallout. It's a real wasteland. I have definitely had interactions with hostile players that don't end with one of us dying.
---
The new NW mode is what many people wanted for survival. And now they have it. And it's super fun. But sometimes I want to use my highly crafted killing machine instead of a basic NW character.
---
On ps4 ive gotten 1 atleast every 5 matches. Do i get to use them? Not always. Its not common so i think the rarity coincides its power.
---
1. In your pip-boy you can toggle what quests you want to appear in your UI. This is under the quest tab. 
---
2. you can choose to either pick a perk or move special points when you level up, I think maybe only after lvl 50.
---
3. Enemies level by whoever was there recently, so some areas may have higher lvl enemies and others have really low level. 
---
4. There’s only a recent players and friends tab.
---
You sound like a tool
---
I tried with a teammate, but we got found and destroyed
---
Think it is used for one of the mutation serums, maybe scaly skin?
---
So you want the same xp as those that...didnt die?
---
Yea, that seems fair.
---
I'm sad there's not more ominous/ culty things to build in the camp. There's a few good things but they're more for radiers, and I never got all the fashnact things.
---
On PS4 I had my health go to zero and I didn't die, no enemies attacked me
---
Me and my husband have been playing together and I could down the person and he’ll come in and finish the job if I end up getting surrounded but I still end up getting both the down and the kill while he’ll get nothing.
---
Also getting infinite loading screen today.
---
I second this, far too many times have I got to the end with a team, only to be killed a minute before the end of the match, how much XP do I lose out on, btw? I've never actually been able to survive a match, yet.
---
A battle between them and enclave(all dead but whatevs) would be epic
---
Guess I'm gonna have to grind for that pink power armor
---
I leave mine unlocked now, unless I am needing the specific item.  Especially since there are so many newbies.
---
Coal is used in a mutation serum recipe.
---
There are some areas of the map that are definitely better geared toward your level than others. Following the overseer quests will generally keep you on track. 
---
I wouldn't worry much about specs. At level 40+ (I think) you can start changing stats. On the meantime, it's not going to matter much if you have allocated a few things differently than the norm.
---
Well I don't know then, if there super rare then it shouldn't be to bad of a issue, but if I make it to end game, there hasn't been any stealth boy users
---
I want that Ronin helmet please
---
*High Five Emote*
---
I wish for those of us at level 50 in Adventure we could rearrange our special in NW and not have it change in adventure mode.  My 15 strength mele character is useless in this mode, but is the character I chose to level up before I knew better.
---
😂 This is awesome.
---
I think its timer should be nerfed. Being able to gain a small advantage at the start has the same effect as a flank. Lets say its timer right now is 30 seconds, i think reducing that to 10 is where it needs to be. Youll maybe be able to down someone then initiate the next, itll give an advatage but not a full guarenteed wipe. If there dumb and group ontop of each other then a 50 cal or a granade launcher is perfectly legit and they asked to die
---
Interesting.
---
:sad face
---
Yes. At first, no. I went where the team went. Playing solo,  I do go out of the way. Playing solo has its pros and cons. Like going alone against a team.
---
I've been getting no crashing since the last update on ps4
---
I’ve been doing pretty well just struggling with how inaccurate the weapons are. Is their recoil or a certain way I should be trying to shoot?
---
I've killed it like 3 times and it never has anything cool on it
---
*Liberty Prime cries tears of joy
---
It's been one of the most-requested features since BETA.  Bethesda has never, to my knowledge, shown any indication that they're working on adding such a thing.
---
It's a shame, because I do think it would be an improvement.
---
Sweet. Didn't know that.
---
I generally use mine if my group is hurting or if we need an advantage. Most endgames are my full squad vs a 2v1. So theres no need to use it.
---
Fuuuuck Outcast Power Armor paints?? Dammit that’s got me interested.
---
That'll be 70 hours of your life, thank you very much.
---
There's been a few fallout mods off and on throughout the game's life cycle so far.
---
Not to mention the base game is very influenced by fallout. Prior to 76 I used to say 7D2D was in fact the closest thing we'd get to an online fallout lol.
---
can't wait for wastelanders (and starfield and TES6)! keep at it!
---
Probably more than that, I'm almost 14 atm
---
Well good for you I guess
---
One of the upsides as a player sticking with something after a rough launch/release/creation or whatever is that you kind of take ownership of it as a community. 
---
You want to see it grow and get better and expand. You want it to become a game everyone was wrong about at the beginning. 
---
It's kind of a badge of honour.
---
Sure you can... if you offer up a reasonable solution. Nobody is claiming the game is perfect. Bitching because it’s not the way YOU want it (emphasis to the general, not you specifically) is a great way to annoy people. Complaining just to complain or to crap all over something other people like because it’s not what you want pisses people off. 
---
There are ways to offer constructive feedback without getting downvoted to oblivion. Plenty of people have said they want the lobby wait in NW reduced or they’d like some different maps and nobody is killing them. 
---
Tl:dr it’s not what you say, it’s how you say it
---
You get adventure xp for playing nw so even if it's like 30 xp, that shit stacks up
---
I’m commenting just so I can come back and find the answer.
---
Bloody mess
---
Clown Daddy rules.
---
I don't like this either and had to get used to it.
---
Sentinel is for pvp use it gives you 15% damage resistance per piece while standing still;generally ranged builds whole unyielding is used for bloodied builds giving +3 to all perks except endurance when low health
---
This is a good idea..because the paper bag can also be a bit tough to see
---
I don't disagree, it probably is easier. But Bethesda did state that they weren't going to support mods for a while on fo76. Perhaps try the maker of the mod for support?
---
Edit: Plus these issues are usually fixed by the mod makers fairly quickly. It just might not be their top priority.
---
Seems to be happening a lot for some peeps, others rarely.   Weird. Almost like a timer is not being reset and it thinks you are not there sometimes and just pops you off.  
---
I had it happen once last night, played several hours.  PC eastern US
---
I experience this a lot but it’s probably cause I can’t  hit the broadside of a barn with a grenade launcher.
---
Are you not allowed to use your levelled dudes?
---
Or a "do you want to sit" second ask
---
Unless they added it in the last patch, it's not in the game yet.
---
so toxic is made someone salty enough to waste the bandwidth here at reddit
---
$17, yikes
---
Wow that's sick. Explosive effect means it has a small aoe damage too, right? That's how it is in adventure mode. Is the explosive effect mentioned on the card?
---
I heard something that you get it from doing Biv. E. Ridge quests, but I’ve never gotten them from him.
---
shhhh, he's fishing for a gold
---
Its a real bummer tbh i keep getting to the end of killing a group then it restart i lose the loot and resources/ammo fighting them. I was in the middle of a daily which was sending me to 4 places each one i had to fast travel to save time and lost the caps from that too. Least it loads you in your last place tho
---
Yeah i know i’d love to, but this week i do not have any chance to try it cause i’m pretty far away from home 😅 (work stuff), and the game is free only until june 17. That’s why  i asked if any of you guys have noticed performance improvements compared to launch
---
I'm not asking Bethesda for help though, I'm asking this community for help.
---
Bethesda have never support mods, but have always said QoL Mods like this are fine.
---
Edit to your edit: the update was to do a fresh install and it should work, but it's not for me but is for others. I was looking for advice on why that would be.
---
enter the map, press triangle
---
I do Biv everyday. So does my team. It's not a drop yet.
---
Everyone can access Nuclear Winter this week. It currently has one map. We don't know when the full version will come out.
---
Yes, you and your girlfriend can play in a team at all times.
---
This game has a controversial launch history.
---
Long story first: 76 borrows many visual assets from Fallout 4. The games launch was embarrassing, very buggy and unstable. 
---
Don’t get me started on the embarrassing and borderline fraudulent merchandising surrounding Fallout 76.
---
Many people are put off by not hanging human NPCs at launch. Many more are peeved at this game for being always online. Many more are peeeved by the lack of stat checks or dialogue trees. 
---
Others don’t like the main story. I think it’s a better main story than Fllout 4 but many prominent people did not.
---
All I can say is the game has stabilized and I like what it offers. Welcome to the party friend.
---
You're breathtaking BGS!
---
Yep but I won’t have access until later tomorrow you can PM me your PSN name
---
You are!! It gives them XP too.
---
Keep in mind you get no advantage what so ever, apart from the points you have in special for the perks that are Nuclear Winter only
---
Shoot first.
---
What happens if I recruit an NPC as a companion and bring them to live as a camp and another player recruits them? Do they leave with the other player, essentially allowing players to ‘kidnap’ NPCs while I’m not home? Or will there be a million of Boone inhabiting everyone’s camp?
---
I belueve lire wise it is a simulation, hiw else xould an AI chajge put normal items for better items. It's probably akin to that vr we saw in Fallout 3
---
I died like 60 seconds before the end of a match once and only got half the XP I do from an actual win.
---
yikes!
---
Only if you die near the end of the game.
---
I havent played after the first 3 months.  Tbh, I dont play many games past a month.  Enjoyed the game for a very long time.. despite minor glitches like bases not staying.
---
What's changed?  I highly doubt they've added something that makes the game so different that people can come in and say it's better now.  Tried brewing but it was extremely minor.
---
These reviewers are going to play the game and be like, okay maybe its decent.. all because they got hit by the meme wave months ago and were convinced the game was absolutely shit.
---
Outside of the marketing fuck ups, the game was always decent.  The hate for this game made me question public opinion in everything now.
---
Not currently. But I imagine you'll be able to when the game mode is fully released.
---
Never came out yet, maybe soon.
---
Can you use your weapons? I'm kinda not super in to battle Royale games so I'm weighing the option.
---
Hello, so from the response you mean we can only play this week and then it will be unavailable for a period of time while it is "fine tuned"? (We both already own FO76 just FYI.)
---
The player to player interactions, even without mics, have been some of the best I've had in any game. 
---
They're almost micro stories and I wish I had a better way to record things like your experience.
---
Or the first time I did fauscnacht or however you spell that God damn word. Players actually marching along with the parade. A crazy dress wearing, axe wielding lady leading the procession. People posing in the photo stands , the awesome post apocalyptic Village people ensembles playing instruments...
---
Love it.
---
Thank you all for not giving up on this game. 
---
We all really appreciate the work you've been putting in. 
---
My friend gave this game a shot this week. He ended up deciding it wasn't for him since he was never really fond of Fallout, but the one thing he said after playing is "This game has a lot of heart." and it's easy to see that hes right when you poke around Appalachia for a short while.
---
No. Maybe once it’s fully launched. It’s still in Pre-Beta.
---
No you cant. Not to be a jerk but why ask and not just try?
---
Edit: didnt consider the "didnt know location" arguement. But even still you can look up the location and go for yourself. Sooner than you get a. Answer on here moat of the time.
---
Huh. Perhaps it's based on the player who does more damage to the enemy? I don't know now.
---
Or trying to connect a wire but jumping instead...
---
Possibly. Noone knows yet. It may go away for a certain amount of time or we may just get to play around with the 'sneak peek' until the full version is released.
---
glad they caved anyway
---
You need to update your Fallout76Custom.ini
---
Look at the comments in the mod page, the author mentions what you have to change.
---
I’ve used them when there’s just 1-3 caps left in a vendor bot. Better that than lock picks.
---
I found a player bar and got all my 15 alcoholic drinks for the weekly challenge.
---
okay yeah, just saw that
---
Yes, but you can’t enter it and it’s not marked on the map. But the vault entrance can be found in the north western part of the map.
---
lvl 100 is the Hellfire Power Armor? Aw man.
---
I think if it was restricted to people who made it to the final 9, then I would be for this! I just wouldn’t want a random  guy who chose to spawn by himself and died in 30 seconds to profit off his teammates’ win lol.
---
Well brush that ol' vault suit off and check out all the new content! The game has improved massively content and performance wise. And if it's not for you check back when wastelanders is out. Wastelanders will get back more to fallouts' "roots". I hope to see you in Appalachia!
---
Ok excellent. I’ll look into where to get those! Thank you!
---
No you cannot currently go in adventure mode. Hopefully they add it later.
---
SUPER MUTANTS FLUXXEN! ON AN OPEN FIELD!
---
There is also one in a boat as a jaws reference
---
LOVE how there is a thread on how to give items!! People may feed us shit for loving this game, but we are a great community!!
---
Oh no, I don't mean that. I meant they blow up into meat chunks when they die
---
Oh dang, that makes more sense, lol
---
As someone who creates new characters too much, I try to avoid if possible. You guus are too nice.
---
*Cough* Anthem *cough*
---
A tool dismantling the grave threat Communism ?
---
Lol! Nice. I forgot that was an effect.
---
I enjoy this game quite a lot, but if you think it's perfect, you're delusional.
---
The last time I had multiple disconnects  while back, I rebooted everything including my cable modem and router/wap.   That seemed to stabilize it.
---
I didn’t want to play this till I saw this list! 😳
---
It's because all us seasoned wastelanders are making the most of having something different to do. Normality will resume next week. Just think of this as a good week to farm lead/cores.
---
Stick with your squad and try to get good weapons. All you can do after that is not die.
---
Pitchfork...shovel I think...hatchet...all purpose ax.
---
Sentinel is not just for PVP. I will give you most people use it for PVP but the benefits work for any incoming damage. 
---
For example, you run 1 piece with weapon weight reduction, one piece with with fdc reduction, one with junk reduction, and 2 with sentinel means you get all the weight reductions to 20% (besides ammo because most run the perk card to get 90%) and then you get a 75% chance of 30% damage reduction.
---
Army bases have balistic fibre too
---
Check out camp McClintlock in the forest or any of the other Forward Points in the bog
---
If they plan on gold panning in the future, they really need to implement fishing. Also, were are all the birds? I really want to see a two-headed RadTurkey!
---
I think its just a gameplay thing.. I have 400 weight in just junk. Its morre then enough to always make repairs or craft around 1000 ammo. 200 for guns my char might use. That leaves me with 200 for store and or quick stash space in survival.
---
Each char has this much space so i dont know why you would ever need more. I do wish i could mail things to myself so i could swap quad gauss to my rifleguy and AA E shotty to right char tho.
---
Source?
---
No I do not cause in the moment when I seen it I just thought it might not been hard to get so I didn't think much of it. Srry 8 (
---
Can you cite your reference for that number?
---
Shovel or pitchfork work
---
Will that prevent the legendary spawn?
---
That would make the most sense. Hopefully someone from Bethesda will see this and be able to give an answer.
---
No, the odds are absolutely even. You can only bring it cosmetics and skill.
---
I feel as though it's also a superb opportunity to try out every gun and get a feel for vats-less combat
---
Technically it has no map location, so they probs don’t know where it is
---
You shouldn't get the same XP as those that didnt die. I mean you died. You didnt finish the "race". Didnt pass "GO". Dont collect $200.
---
Did you contribute the win, I would hope so. For that you should be rewarded, I agree.
---
The same XP, absolutely not. A fraction of the winning XP, sure
---
It’s the cycle of life. I prefer to enjoy stuff and not rain on others parades.
---
I was about to, then I got disconnected. Maybe it’s better that I didn’t get to say what was on my mind at that moment.
---
it doesnt. Unless you're the last one alive on your team usually. I've tested it and if you die and spectate until the last person dies, your XP doesnt update. Maybe its another "visual bug" or maybe they messed up, who knows
---
Game files.
---
I've been replaying classic WoW on private servers, and forgot how much I enjoyed just mindlessly fishing. They've gotta add some rare loot too, treasure, prewar outfits, etc
---
My only hope is that if Nuclear Winter gets popular to not abandon Adventure Mode. Fortnite Save the World was good and could’ve been great if the devs didn’t totally abandon STW for battle royale. Please dont let this happen.
---
With a ghoul vendor who ends every line of dialogue with "mmmhmm" ala sling blade
---
Just remain relaxed. If you start panicking jumping and firing you won't hit anything. Plus don't use single shot weapons, use automatics
---
Maybe op didn't know where it was ...or wanted to save a long walk...
---
Do you have the Herbivore mutation? That mutation only let's you benefit from fruit and veggies.
---
You have any mutations? Check effects in pipboy. Herbivore mutation would mean only vegetables.  Meat would grant 0 hunger like you say.
---
Sarcasm done right.
---
That's what I am always thinking. Talking with people about the game they always say the same things glitches bugs texture. Then they praise some game with cartoony graphics (the game that shall not be named). All these have been fixed
---
I've been playing through the free trial and having a great time! So I went ahead and bought it off Amazon for $17.
---
I met some really helpful people early on who helped me get started with some starting weapons and ammo, also explained how it's a good idea to friend people you encounter so you can take advantage of the quick travel options.
---
I'm glad I decided to give it a shot. I also felt the same way about Fallout 4, despite a lot of people saying it wasn't that good of a game. Love getting lost just exploring the world at the moment.
---
Always have the ring behind you. So you know you won't get shot in the back.
---
Crashes, bugs and dc's are way less frequent than during launch months. I haven't dc'd or crashed even once in NW, and I've played that like 20 hrs.
---
In Survival mode, you need a good legendary rifle to compete. There is still one-shotting, even after the huge Explosive/Two-Shot nerf. Maybe some new players from this free trial and NW week will move onto Survival next week, then you wouldn't need the best weapons, I guess.
---
I bet 60% of newcomers on PC will abandon the game just because they don't know how to turn off V-sync, motion blur and mouse acceleration. Some might be interested in the game enough to google stuff, but still the situation is pretty sad.
---
Overall things have improved **a lot**. They have made PvP and weapon balance changes based on community's feedback, which gives high hopes for the future. Chances are they might add V-sync, motion blur and mouse acceleration into the settings later. Obviously this game is not an e-sport game, but things are improving patch after another.
---
The sheer amount of time it will take me to unlock all these just confirms to me that I should encourage my 10 year old son to play NW while I'm at work. He'll have me to level 100 by the end of summer.
---
They’re not bugs. They’re features.
---
Me too.  I just assumed it’s because I’m terrible.
---
Check to see if you have both herb and carnivore. Both people who responded are right but there’s also an issue if you have both.
---
Could you of accidentally acquired the herbivore mutation? I can’t think of any other reason 🤔
---
wait... what?. stimpacks expire now?. since when?
---
Dude I’m so pissed...
---
You are totally right. I have carnivore on my main and didn’t even think to check the little DNA symbol at the bottom...
---
I have no idea where it came from! Im not even level 10 yet!
---
Regardless, thanks boys, much appreciated
---
I really like this idea but only if you add an aquarium with it with a set limit of the fish and size so you can have a 8ft fish in a 2ft little aquarium
---
i have a full set of food chem drink weight reduction armor. makes a huge difference,it is a must have for me. and dont carry junk, scrap n stash, scrap n stash. lol
---
This was it. Thanks so much!
---
The 60 million number is for all Bethesda games in 2018-2019 not Fallout 76
---
Ok so what your saying is by mixing all these types of armor pieces, you can take advantage of what each one offers at the same time?
---
N’awh shucks, you’ve given me the warm’n’fuzzies. 
---
You guys should make some kinda documentary on how to handle an angry fan base and send it to BioWa—-other game developers. Knocked it out of the park. Perfectly timed free play week, too. 
---
Gotta say I was skeptical about a fallout battle royale, but after giving it a shot, I absolutely love it. Thanks for sticking with us.
---
*Sighs*
---
Yeeep lmao thanks i feel like an idiot
---
Precisely
---
This happened to me the last 2 times i did the SBQ. No exp, no loot. Nada. just a bunch of wasted ammo... why does this keep happening...
---
What
---
It's a bug. Just relog! Hope that helps :)
---
He was pretty adamant to get one kill in his last stream.
---
same here, all the negative press is weird, me and some buddies have been having a blast playing, I gotta say I was against "Fallout with Friends" but its so goddamn fun playing with friends
---
The good thing is that you level up a lot faster if you make it to the top 5. It's nice to see that doing well is rewarded.
---
Someone did this for me and my game crashed. They probably thought I was an idiot
---
if you go unarmed and use mutations you dont need perks to increase damage for most enemies except the big guys.
---
Oh my god...
---
I disagree. Please do not change it. It makes running a tactical decision. 
---
If this is added, then we might as well add super jumps that allow you to jump across the map, because why not.
---
Considering it functions like the punchbowl, I doubt they'll add it until they work out the kinks (like filling it with nukashine🤣)
---
It seems random in vats, sometimes I'll see it (usually happens with a shotgun for some reason) and sometimes I wont, it's odd
---
Fishing lvl?
---
Thanks, I realised it was because I had a weapon equipped. I guess that makes sense although it's not that obvious.
---
Yeah you can drop blueprints with most camp stuff. Not turrets or anything with power, though.
---
We still can't change HUD color so I wouldn't hold my breath
---
Those aren't loot boxes! They're player icons and stash boxes for your camp!
---
Character icons or camp items, just check the challenge if it has a tent icon it's a camp item vault boy icon is character icons
---
Needs to have a 1x1 base to work
---
You get it.  Lose legendary effects completely, specifically sentinal/cav armor and any type of secondary explosive weapons.  Do away with the penalty of dying, but keep track on a leaderboard for those that need to brag, and there you go.
---
Stealth boy and GG
---
Oh okay, thank you!
---
I created a new character for this mode but after leveling to five last night I did not get any more special points for my character so do I have to level him up in adventure mode making a new character kind of pointless for NW?
---
Re respecting, it is level 50 where one can choose to move special points.  It actually took me 6 or so levels to understand the game.  I restarted after that.  Respecting at level 20 could be tough.
---
Re leveling, certain parts of the maps are geared for certain levels.  Following the main quest will keep on track.....until it gets to hard lol.  There will be a point where you'll need to do side quests, kill kill kill, or events to get strong enough to continie.
---
Are you leaving the vault?
---
Idiocy like that makes sociologists want to punch this whole idiotic country in the face.
---
Never heard of this. I am a PS4 player as well. Perhaps try reinstalling it
---
I'm really sorry but I'm struggling to find what parts need editing. The custom.ini file has been updated and I downloaded the new one, and deleted the old one. 
---
The only edit it says to make in the comments is already made in the new custom.ini file. 
---
Could you maybe copy/paste what your file looks like here if you use the mod?
---
mine shows:
---
"[Archive]
---
sResourceIndexFileList = SeventySix - Textures01.ba2, SeventySix - Textures02.ba2, SeventySix - Textures03.ba2, SeventySix - Textures04.ba2, SeventySix - Textures05.ba2, SeventySix - Textures06.ba2, 124.ba2"
---
I don't want to change the HUD color honestly. I like the current theme
---
Its bugged
---
I'm really interested to see what "Centurion Helmet" is, please keep updating.
---
He said "ANYONE SELLING DEATHCLAW HIDES? LOL"
---
Have to leave the vault for it to save.
---
If you want, I could play with you. I'm level 21 or something like that. I have 7 wins I think, maybe 8. Dm me your psn if you're interested. Btw, I'm 15, just letting you know in case I'm too young for that.
---
Hey u/TehFook,
---
Would you please provide me with your platform an your [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) username so we can look into it? Also if you're on PC, can you let me know if you happen to be using any mods? Feel free to reach out by DM if you're not comfortable posting that info here.
---
Thanks for the tip
---
I killed someone tonight!!! Obviously got killed immediately but as someone who has never played vs before it was exciting
---
Oh, I didn't realize that that's where they came from. Sorry, I'm a dumbass

---
yea I really hate the launcher too.  I only use it to update and get f1/2/tactics for free, otherwise I use steam to launch 76.
---
Vertibot I can help you with, as for the others not so much... 
---
Go to Poseidon plant and repair the vertibot pad and take a pic somewhat close up. It registers there for myself and friends. 
---
Stimpak diffuser... if you did the op quest for Arktos, one of the drops was the plan for stimpak diffusers so maybe someone who got it could make a few and sell them?
---
Thank you good sir or madam.
---
You can do the bug and toxic waste dailies for a shot at Possum badges, too. I've gotten lots of badges that way.
---
I have a friend that plays BR a lot and a nice piece of advice he told me was: hide. I mean, not for the whole game but pick some spots and have players come to you. It’s easier to see movement so if you’re running around all the time someone is going to spot you and your going to have a bad time. 
---
Take it slow, spawn away from those populated areas, and remember you don’t have to kill the other 48 players to win... you just need to survive.
---
Well that is kind of dumb.
---
I have not used one in a while but I pictured it as a slower start that got faster over time.
---
Knowing that I lose a bunch of my stuff when I die has kept me from playing.  I suck at PVP, so die a lot, but would play if I didn't get penalized when I died.  And yes, wouldn't even touch it as long as all the duped equipment is still around.  Too unbalanced.
---
You probably haven't started the BoS questline. Where are you in the main questline?  Recruitment blues isn't where it starts. As part of main questline you Head to Abby's Bunker, one of the terminals will kick off Defiance Has Fallen questline. Which eventually kicks off Recruitment Blues. And then you can access the building.
---
Yes you can go to it but you can’t go in it... it’s north of Aaronholt Farm in the mountains.
---
Box takes retail space.  Digital is 100% free to store.    It demonstrates company greed.  They will not lower price unless something forces them to.
---
Yes.  You must gain more special points in adventure mode.  You can still gain player xp in NW, but you have to go into adventure mode and allocate those points.
---
Difficult to find any due to the influx of new players. But thanks for reminding me. I saw that Clancy Manor also has 3 Military grade tape.
---
A fishing competition event, aquariums, more naturally generated fish in the waters you can see and possibly legendary fish that either grant certain bonuses or can trade in for gear sort of like the purveyor but better.
---
I got the special edition sealed from Amazon Warehouse Deals for 10.75. It was marketed in "like new" condition, but it was new. So keep that in mind as well
---
Whitesprings jumpsuit
---
Sounds like a solid plan. I'll have to try that.
---
I just want to be able to sit down and use my pip boy 😞
---
I'm on PS4 too and I haven't dc'd this week yet. *shrug*
---
It's the Battle Royale equivalent of a really bad Diluted.
---
Same, I really like it, blends well. I was just saying that Bethesda doesn't seem to be so keen on customization of UI elements for some reason. Never know though
---
When I do that, it tells me I can't heal.
---
The second code wasn't for the bonus items that come with it?
---
Look there is a huge influx due to all the free trail people. How about you just be patient. I have also had to deal with it, but it should be solved next week.
---
Just let us have the option to play the pipboy games during all the loading screens that would be fantastic and then when the pipboy game ends the world would be COMPLETELY LOADED IN?!? What?? Wow but seriously it would be tightttttttt
---
Anyone who thinks you need a legendary wepon to "compete" does not play survival. Period.
---
Sneaky shot is 2x a headshot is 2x so if you can get a hunting rifle aeound 100 damage by lvl 20 then you have a 400 damage weapon.
---
One shot is NOT a thing tho commando builds it can be one spray.
---
Berry mentats let you find the stealth players. 
---
AA is great aginst unyielding and will ez let you 2 or 3 shot that full build once they are in that territory.
---
I am lvl 40ish and a lvl7 got the drop on me today. Lol
---
No you're not, literally everyone thought they were actual lootboxes, or atleast anything but not icons
---
once its released you can, but I think youll have ti play nw to unlock more rooms to learn all the lore, which kinda sucks for me since im not a pvper and battle royale hasnt interested me at all. :(
---
Basically it’s just kinda expensive
---
It's not crazy at all. Skyrim has plenty of fishing mods.
---
When I launched my second nuke the game froze as I was putting in the key code and that was the end of that.
---
The game will still crash or lock up at the most inconvenient moment ( sometimes ).
---
So the game is still not perfect and probably never will be.  Regarding the failed nuke - the best thing to do is to try again.  Not all launches will be successful but most will be.
---
Well at least other people will know now
---
I highly doubt they do this. not enough incentive
---
You could holster the weapon and wave emote??? lol.
---
Because the one who downed the enemy did all the work, not the one who’s cleaning up.
---
I generally ignore everyone at all times, I got shit to do!
---
Yea I don’t really do the pacifist life so didn’t know that sentinel was really used in pve. If anything I thought it would be cav lol
---
I'm gonna jump from over the vault and snatch that bag before they got a chance to pick it up. Muhahaha muhahahhah. Jk
---
DONT DO IT!! HE COULD BE THE STALKER!!
---
Wow
---
*tips fedora* no thanks you
---
Heavy combat with bos material is better than marine, for whatever reason they didnt add all the marine armor mods into 76
---
I didn't know about the free trial or the sales! I was just going through games and have been wanting to try FO76 for a while, (after being obsessed with FO4), and saw it was on sale. So now I'm super excited to try it out!
---
But wow the download time is killing me. Lol It's been downloading for 2 hours now and it just reached 50%.
---
Double thumbs up pose in photo mode maybe :D
---
Changing graphics fixes disconnects and entire server crashes? Wow. Thought maybe it had something to do with a large influx of players on inadequate servers.
---
If I had to guess I would assume its [this](https://i.imgur.com/ZPwXtxw.png) helmet. Here are some [screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/d84b3W3) of the datamined helmets that were added to the game with the NW patch
---
Waka Waka
---
you know what i mean. its bad game mechanics to have extremely limited tools for survival after youre downed. every other battle royale has a mechanic to avoid this.
---
its simply not fun to have someone go down and have their body killed within 3 seconds and make them watch the team for the remainder of the match.
---
\#LetWoobyFree
---
The game works fine. You, however, don't seem to know what the hell you're doing. FIX it.
---
I just wish I had explosive weapons
---
You have to finish the tutorial and leave the vault..
---
It was pretty much my luck back when I played too. When I roll a new character here shortly, I'm suspecting my luck will be the same, but I hope not. Lol
---
It's on for a while (early July), and is on the 'buy atoms' page, not directly in the store.
---
*cough* mass effect andromeda before that too *cough* *cough*
---
😂🙌🏼
---
Hellfire pa paint set? Is that the one with superheated rebar?
---
Survival needs a total tare down and restart. No transferable characters no more weekly weapon. Survival should be its own thing not trying to lure adventure to play it for a lam legendary. Those people don't want to pvp they want the weapon.
---
I’ve gotten a few from the Leg vendor.. what are you looking for?
---
What do you mean?
---
*You're* breathtaking!
---
What do you mean? Provide more details and examples please.
---
Sure seems fine to me as is. I can play all week without having to repair my weapon or armor. You just need the right perks and they last forever.
---
I get that. But at the end when they bring up stats it has -players downed and -players killed. So wouldn’t I have just the downed and he would have the killed?
---
The *PC port* is really bad by default. It's lacking basic V-sync toggle and other important settings.
---
The menu navigation and keybinds are just weird. Using Tab to exit menus is hard to learn. Only some keybinds can be changed. There's actually no way to navigate stats-item-radio menu with your keyboard. Building mode navigation with Z and C is again really odd.
---
You gotta learn so much when you try this game out. Someone with $10,000 PC won't be able to run the game at 60 fps in Borderless Window on Low settings, without changing .ini files.
---
Other than that Fallout 76 is a great game. 10/10 as you said.
---
Thank you I’ll try that, I haven’t done that quest yet, been waiting even though my camp is right next to the garage by the cliff.
---
I would live in survival if the levels were separate from adventure mode, no legendaries, and the perks were more balanced
---
If you can kill tons of people.  Time spent in NW mode vs xp earned is not a lot really.  You'd be better off just doing some quests/events in adventure mode to level faster.
---
If you're on xbox I can craft 3 for you
---
But I saw it on YouTube. Or is it only PC?
---
Problem exists between console and sofa.
---
It's the red one from the trailer.
---
Nuke winter
---
Have seen many posts abour using the ammunition factory workshop to call the vertbot and having to be very close to it for the picture to register for the quest
---
Ahhh. What about the other two Hellfire skins?
---
they are Wintering
---
Im lvl 71 and Ive barely scratched the surface of the main story...
---
Great impression for those newbies.
---
Higher level as I am level 102 but I will still check it out. That’s the vendor in whitesprings right?
---
I have a stoner garage with couches, music, lights, and a fish lamp 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️ is that lively for you?
---
Love. Is a burnin thing,
---
And it makes, a firery ring.
---
If putting in more work meant that, then they should give XP for damage given instead of how many you down and kill.
---
I had a similar problem doing the line in the sand quest the other night. After we downed the sb I went to loot it and dropped dead. Went back to collect my junk it happened again. 3rd time I managed to get my stuff but burned a couple of stims in the process. I wasn't the only one it happened to as well.
---
I had fun in Fort Deviance once, 'Maxson' being the safe word seemed a bit odd though...
---
that is the point I think..
---
I'm at Defiance has fallen, but it only tells me to get inside the BoS HQ. It didn't trigger Recruitment Blues for me after I got the the elevator.
---
At least we can all exchange these crappy legendaries now
---
Oh yeah and unpopular opinion i think we should drop all items on death in survival
---
I got a TS black powder and AA E double barrel today! Thanks for cleaning out the junk so i could get 2 good rolls ☺
---
You mean to say that it's supposed to make you rage as you frantically hit the H button? Bahumbug
---
Why not set up a whore house???
---
Earn them caps!!!!!     🤠
---
You know it’s better than it was since launch on that front this week being the exception. Again just be patient and the new players hopefully will as well.
---
Weapons stop at level 50. Im 100+ and haven't done all the quests or events yet. So always something to do besides the grind for that perfect legendary weapon.
---
Also past 50 you stop getting special points and get option for additional perk cards or swapping a point between stats. So leveling past 50 could be you refining your build by getting those perk cards your'e still missing or correcting some mistakes you did assigning points.
---
Right. Could do a small ante of caps to play and the winners get the pool.
---
That's every game anymore, it can read faster off the hard drive than your disk, so the entire game gets saved to your hard drive. Battlefield 5 is a 50gb download and takes up 73gb on my disk, same story with every other game. The physical disk is basically DRM.
---
When Xbox 1 came out they tried making it so you just had to put the disk in once and install but made them one time use to prevent people from buying a game and giving it to all heir friends for free, but that wasn't exactly popular.
---
Wondering what they mean by fleshed out interactions? Like shaking hands or the option to kill them? Lol
---
Deadmeat
---
Fair point.
---
They've added so much content since the beginning! And the missions aren't repetative. And its challenging. I love it!
---
This toon is lvl75 and haven't done any quests outside of the forest. I've explored a good chunk of the map, but mostly just aimlessly wander.
---
Pimpin ain’t easy
---
As someone who just jumped into this this week, thanks guys. Despite the bad press I'm having fun, and it absolutely helps when experienced people are kind and patient with new players.
---
I feel like this is the last game with open mics on Xbox and I love it.
---
It would seem, at least for me.  
---
If I change weapons (I havn't tried just putting it away) with 98 charges left in a core, every core afterwards will have 98 charges.  
---
It's a real kick in the face when you change weapons with 10 charges left, and you had 12 cores left.   
---
I guess the only saving grace is that I figured out how it was happening. So now I just use up all my other ammo then use that exclusively.
---
Lol had this happen to me (noon) yesterday I was like WHERES THE GIFT for. like five mins till.i saw the basically camoflouged bag on the floor
---
I agree with the others a lot of players have been in engaging in the new mode. I'm on ps4 if you wanna check out my wares my psn: Valley707Villain
---
" Companion NPCs will be able to live in your C.A.M.P., while also offering you quests. "
---
I SWEAR TO GOD.... PRESTON GARVEY HAD BETTER \*NOT\* BE WAITING FOR ME IN MY CAMP...
---
"I've heard of a settlement that needs your help....."
---
AAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!
---
So do all SPECIALS stop at 15? I tried to level up my strength again and it said it was ‘maxed’
---
You can’t build together in CAMPs only in workshops I think you should be able to.
---
Sound like a win xD
---
Sounds like Daniel is our new Preston Garvey, kind of looks like him too.
---
Wait.
---
They're all trying out the new mode, they'll be back one the beta ends. Until then escape to survival and reap the extra xp while the servers are more empty.
---
That's what I was thinking, Heavy Guns are not the best with vats, thanks
---
And workshops are temp right?

I've been grinding levels by turning off autofill group and starting in a barren area.  Don't bother with loot, just run from everyone hide and survive as long as you can.  I'm only overseer level 8 so far, but I often end up in the top 10 and have been leveling up every 2 games.

For the record, I think this is a completely awful way to play when considering other people's game experience, but that's what you get when you have PVP only rewards in a game with PVE appeal.  :|

Also add a Tri-Force, thanks.

Is that how other BR games work? I honestly never played one but getting winning xp when your dead doesn't seem right.

Like the guy who doesn't stay with the team and gets killed in 2 min... He gets to win the match? That sounds not fun.

Depends on build. You could even run 1 cav and 1 sentinel. Just depends on when you think you need the damage reduction.

I agree, hopefully, since NW is still kind of in a Beta state this is a feature they add later.

You might want to articulate what you find lacking in the current system.

I mean, it's not anything gamebreaking. I think it's fine that this is the only way to get 'em.

This is true, but just because I'm level 50+ doesn't mean I have my points in the right place.  My character has 6 Charisma, but needs 9 to use the suppressor card.  I'm a mele build so have 2 in perception, but need 3 to use the rifleman perk you speak of.  I would love to see everyone get 50 points to play with and move them however they want and not have it affect their character in adventure mode.   I'd be all for a new character to be used for this mode, but then you can't have xp and caps earned for your character in adventure mode as it is now.
