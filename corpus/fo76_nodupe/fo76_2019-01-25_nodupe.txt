They actually had Holiday events planned however they weren’t allowed to go forward , iirc it was the shareholders or something that decided against them being released.

---
---
At the very least, make it a "hard core" toggle when creating a new character that only matches you with other "hard core" characters and servers.
---

---
Once the "hard core" character is created, it cannot be changed. This effectively creates this 2nd database that clean slate folks (like me) are looking for, while letting current characters keep playing adventure and survival without being impacted. 
---
Best of both worlds! 
---
&gt;*I* have a finished character though and *I* don't want to start over.
---
I see.
---
So... Let's pretend for a moment that most of the people here don't feel the same way.
---
*Assuming that is true,* you think Bethesda should cater to your wants and needs even though it would be at the detriment of a majority of the playerbase?
---
I have seen videos of one of the unopened vaults so I know there is content coming. I just hope that's before survival mode, end of March is still awhile away. I wouldn't mind a team deathmatch mode or something like that so we'll see I guess.
---
It doesnt
---
As long as you're hoarding 5.56... (kidding).... I'll send you an add
---
No we don't, I killed those ghouls and when I went to get loot there was nothing there when I went to collect.
---
Who gives a shit honestly?
---
Beginners want to cry? Should have supported and bought the game when it came out then.
---
I want more character weight and more stash weight. I take more baseline reduced weight of heavy weapons so having them dont require power armor
---
Its also why we let everyone tag legendary mobs first before blowing it away.
---
Everyone keeps saying TSE, but it seemed that Two Shot and Explosive prefixes are being nerfed.  So my two shot minigun that only does 31 dmg will now be moderately more powerful than a non legendary?
---
Legendaries should be significantly more powerful, which is what their name alludes to, right? Personally I’ve put in a lot of time to get the weapons I have and apply the mods/perks to play the gamw how I like it. So because of rampant duping, even TS or E weapons become nerfed as well, which is ridiculous.
---
Where can I see the mode details?
---
Sometimes the only way to reason with the mentally Ill is namely calling. 
---
Zero people have to make a new character. If someone wants to play with someone else it's highly likely they'll play a pve server first. Once they like it then they jump to a pvp. Anyone jumping to pvp now does not want all those explosive 2 shots ruining their gameplay.
---
Wouldn't it be fun to just instant die over and over to a bunch of cheaters with 10,000 pounds over weight making all those servers just as unstable! ;D
---
The survival mode should be for FO76, what seasons are for Diablo 3. Create a new character, play with new rules and get rewards.
---
If they turn around and make this mode new characters only, then I am excited! Id love to start anew.
---
If this was true why wasn't there any loot?...Bro. I killed them.
---
This Bethesda, stop what your doing and implement this first.
---
You ca still have current mode servers, survival servers and many more options. We could play solo, privately with friends or on public servers with official tags and rule sets. With mods and without.
---
Why you didn't do this is madness, if you were a proper MMO i'd get it to a certain extent. But your not, 24 players per server doesn't make it an MMO. This is a Fallout game with a multiplayer options (think borderlands style co-op), and this is fine, this is great tbh! It would help with server stability as well which lets be honest, are you ever going to get it up to a standard you want it at as it is?
---
Check out server selection on games like Ark, Conan, 7 days to die, (not the games yes i know there crap - server selection though). Choices are good! Choices are great!
---
Please explain to us your vision for the game where it involves the server and server options we have now as it doesn't make much sense to limit us the way you have / are.
---
You keep saying your listening to us, that you've got tons of news and ideas your going to share with us soon...soon never comes though, if your waiting for that one great patch then you going t come out and start talking and communicating again its never going to happen the way it is because your never going to make every one happy.
---
Server selections and different rule sets might though and it might make your live easier when it comes to exploits etc as the servers wont always have 24 players from all 20 different countries on them.
---
Please don't just pass the info on to the dev team, grab which ever one is ignoring every body because they are a precious artist and have a vision and give them a slap and make them spend a few days on this sub, facebook and twitter. Get them to explain why they think there vision is the way to go and why that doesn't include separate servers for with as many different rule sets as you want to make?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Stay off the grass.
---
 No. I like you're idea. Was just adding a caveat to the point the poster above was making. Lol
---
*Stashes TSE Dragon and Demolition Expert 5 to shoot eyes out across the wasteland.*
---
That would be my wife. She loves that thing hahaha
---
How on Earth could Bethesda not realize the absurdity of letting existing characters into Survival mode? This has to prove just how incompetent they are. A thousand people immediately give a million reasons why it's a bad idea.
---
I understand that. Too bad Bethesda doesn't have any plans for the Factions.
---
Sometimes your legendary can jump to a nearby corpse. Check all corpses and meat piles. Also you seem to (from experience) have to do a certain amount of damage to one to mark that you deserve something. Altho I have no idea the percentage. Just what's happened to me. 
---
I ain’t judging.  Love rockin the Wardrum myself.
---
...... i don't know if to laugh or to sad for you lol.
---
You ither did not get a hit on the mob or it did not have loot or it did not load right away (meaning check back on it or your lying to us...
---
Maybe it is a glitch but three times I have done this over about 2 weeks after I go to the ghouls I kill after someone else searches, there is nothing there.
---
Bethesda, please listen to this person. 
---
You have no way to say that the majority of the players want to start over.  ~2k upvotes is not all the players.  You have incomplete data.  
---
See I like how I get 12 downvotes. I don’t have the game yet I was contemplating but if the community is this toxic I know what falling industry I’m not supporting. 
---
No need, I will take your word for it. Just trying to get a better understanding of the other side 
---
Sometimes they don't drop loot.
---
Cry some more, this is the internet. 
---
I think people might be able to take stuff like Hardened Mass etc. but not Legendaries as they are all individual to each person. Maybe your Legendary item was on a a pile of goo, or maybe it just didn't drop anything. That happens sometimes. I could be wrong about the Hardened Mass etc. but I think that stuff can be taken right from under your nose by another player.
---
Would you up for creating me some and we can trade?!?
---
I mean, I get the dislike for the idea of allowing existing characters, but down the line, how would it be any different than people who have played in the mode for just as long as people have played adventure already? You end up with literally the same issue you are against now, but it just delays it.
---
According to Playstation trophies 10% is way too high. Only 3,6% of players have killed 20 or more players.
---
That's unlucky for you. I did trading similar to you, I'd assume with a duper, but haven't had any of those issues. I'm on ps4. 
---
Hm. Just crappy RNG I hope...
---
Ive posted ways that they could have had handled this duping problem from an IT standpoint and I do not understand why things have gone the way they have. 
---
Tarkov, no thanks. 
---
For sure. And I certainly don't want to alienate people that want to bounce between the modes, so a toggle for new characters being "hard core" and in a separate player pool together that is just survival would be a best of both worlds! 
---
Within this community, I havent seen a “Bethesda Replied” to any of the posts on either bobblehead duping or TSE nerfing... Not saying they havent responded, just saying I havent seen it.
---
Nope. Prefer to grind over buying dupes 
---
I agree here. My stash is less than 75 pounds of guns and outfits. The remaining 525 is scrapped bulk Jim I'm waiting to sell. God forbid I go explore, I come back with even more. It's perpetually full. 
---
Thank you, that makes more sense then what I was thinking. I hope at least hunger and thirst have more impact, that way my crafting character has something to do.
---
The economy was fucked the second Bethesda came up with the idea for an online game 
---
Try seeing if you can friend someone who has the same mission and complete it with them to see if that fixes it. I searched and a lot of people were still having the same issues. 
---
Unfortunately, you are right.
---
I know right, it even says recommended 8 players (it did haven't seen it since the first time actually) but they don't even put in a way to group with more than 3 friends :(
---
Did they really think every single Fallout player is some sort of nerd with no social skills or friends? Its just so shoddy the way it is. little things like this make me want to bang my head against a brick wall....why Bethesda, why!?!
---
Ideally, that's why you wipe after a beta, why you fix known exploits before the beta ends, and why you log everything. It's kinda late for that now.
---
They can keep searching for and deleting the stockpiles, and nerf some of the strongest legendary combinations to make the undetected items a bit less legendary.
---
I do like the idea of segregated servers, but wonder how many more times they'd have to do this as more exploits are found.
---
out of curiosity does the scorchbeast stew add to other perks other than intelligence?
---
An that's a huge problem. The fact they have to have threads on a unofficial forum with 1000s of upvotes just to get the right things to happen.
---
I mean I just bought the game recently for like 10 bucks and I'm enjoying it just fine. It's a very relaxing game for me and I enjoy it for that. I didn't encounter any of the game breaking glitches yet and also only had like, 1 server crash in 2 weeks and I was able to get back on right away and play for a few hours just fine.
---
I can understand being really angry after this game if you bought it at release and at full price. But as is right now, for the price I paid for it, I'm happy with my purchase.
---
Hello Valseek, do you also manage Bethesda's page on Facebook? I have tended to give feedback as posts on the Bethesda page there. Is posting feedback here preferable?
---
I'm pretty sure it adds strength too
---
***!$ERROR$!*** Be advised, you are being watched. 
---
Literally Stockholm syndrome 
---
Ooouuu remove effects! Good idea!
---
Also I just want to say my phone tried to correct effects to erect. That is all.
---
I’m in this camp, this is what I’m waiting for. I’m hoping I at least get the option for a one way transfer 
---
And I love to see Battle Royale mod in F76.
---
3,6% of Playstation players have the trophy for killing 20 or more players. 
---
Fuck starting over again, there needs to be another solution.
---
thx it just seems it may need about 5 ingredients to craft..so i was just wondering about its boost..i do a ton of cooking..but i do not really mess with the demonbats LOLOL
---
I mean in fairness, no one uses them bc missiles weigh 100 pounds a piece lol
---
I am interested in PVP. Just the way it works right now makes it uninteresting. If they made the new mode new characters only, it would become a great thing to me! There would be so many new possibilities to play! I am actually excited. I just hope they dont let those thousands of TSE weapons that already exist into the mode. Adventure loot would kill survival before it had a chance.
---
+1
---
I hate being one shotted and my armor blown off due to bobblehead stacking.  But with fireproof, the upcoming 2se nerf...balancing is going to be a lot better and fights won't be over before they begin.
---
If the game is unfair right now, how fair do you think it will be when &lt;1% have God rolled weapons and armor.  PvP should be like a game of chess with the use of perk loadouts and various stat modifiers.  At the moment the game is unbalanced but balancing will fix it.
---
If you have a chance of rolling a weapon that would give an unfair advantage then no matter how many fresh starts, someone will always have it.  Give us balancing and ways to counter.  The PvP mode will generate a lot more data for Bethesda to use to do this.  Heck, even weapons/stat data from the PvP mode can be moved to adventure mode.
---
nah as long as hes not duping. Dupers literally have 60-70k of each item in the videos of them you see.
---
Few people buying up more than one copy of the game for an extra 600 stash weight is not a problem, if they remove the dupers and items those guys are hording
---
/u/3mb3r89 
---
Read the whole comment from Valseek 🗿
---
They’re going to have to implement a safe zone or do the level 1-5 disabled PvP thing. But even then, could easily camp a building of any particular mission and grief. They did say it’s not for the faint heart.
---
&gt; Legendaries should be significantly more powerful 
---
Just going to focus in on this. 
---
25% is still a significant increase over a base weapon. 
---
When one effect is a clear victor in the damage Olympic's, in all situations, there's an issue. The nerf brings TS in line with the other primary effects available. 
---
I find a melee build (every possible increase to single handed melee damage) works well for PvE. But for PvP sometimes my attacks just don't register so it's not very effective. 
---
They should model a pvp mode like rust'. Where it restarts regularly, you start at the vault and work your way up to top tier gear. You can raid other's bases for their loot (more than just stupid scrap). PVP always on. When you kill someone, you can loot all of their belongings. And more importantly, GET RID OF LEGENDARIES. Or, make them extremely rare. This wouldn't work with the level difference pvp system (get rid of it already)
---
Pros: a dedicated pvp server where killing others is worth it. You can have fun with your friend controlling workshops, building bases to keep out raiders, raiding bases.
---
Cons: The game is way too big for this. Decreasing entities in this server may help, but at the end of the day only a nice PC could run this smoothly. 
---
I quit this game around 2 months ago because of how insanely easy it is. I have 3 level 50+ characters that can solo scorch beast queen. Make. The. Game. Hard. Like it was when i first started. And I didn't one shot everything i ran into. Make the game hard = make the game fun
---
Think this shows where Bethesda is at in terms of a timeline. The lack of PVP was one of the loudest complaints during the initial onslaught at launch, along with bugs, no NPC’s etc. No one was worried about endgame or post endgame yet. So basically Bethesda is just now catching up and is still a few months behind players more current concerns.
---
Thing is he isn’t a duper... hadn’t had any kinds of unreasonable amounts of some items in his stash. And with my main char I didn’t even get to trading part. Something else got trashed here and Iam left with no words... what could I do? 
---
Whitesprings and whitesprings bunker I have over 300 screws and keep at least 100 of the other harder to find resources.  Just one run easily nets 30 screws and other junk.  The only junk I have a hard time holding onto is copper everything else is easy.
---
Now this is just a personal opinion man but i don't think the devs are to blame for this one let me explain.
---
I truly believe alot of 76 before release was set up to knock into the fortnite market. So its most likely the reason to the add choices of the atom store current items that they would find appealing over more wasteland esk themes. As well as the massive push for pvp stuff and modes.
---
I would guess it came from above and i am sure once they see the survival mode player count against the adventure mode count it will change alot. We do have vaults we know are comming.  But hopefully after most of the work will be focused on bring more pve content and end game activities pve side and more co-op. 
---
Doesn't always work, especially if you get wedged in a crevasse. 
---
Believe me, I've tried. :(
---
ahhhhh i had to walk from ..whitesprings to sutton..to flatwoods..to harpers ferry..and to watoga..the worst
---
Yeah i was being dramatic. By useless i just meant of no greater value then others. I personally hate Two Shot because that 25% extra damage comes with a huge clunkyness drawback to your accuracy so i do find it now more usess then others. I friking love explosive bullets on the other hand. Only 20% dmg seems low but at least it's AOE. It will still be my favorite thing to grind for.
---
Still got to make you think, PC the game only costs about £12 now with a key and can pick it up for £30 on psn etc.
---
They giving it away free with control pads in some stores in Germany at the moment! Bethesda really need to look at prices and be more realistic i think
---
You couldnt free up 10 pounds?
---
Right on man glad you’re enjoying it. If I got it for ten bucks I’d be excited too
---
Which is a shame, because there’s so much potential. 
---
I don’t even think something like this could be implemented seamlessly without 10 more things breaking.
---
We call the local tip the Swap Shop. Same principal. :)
---
I don't know if you are stupid or can not read...I was the one that killed the legendary ghouls I killed all but one of the ghouls. I have zero reason to lie about a game.
---
Which is fun to experience.  But these interactions get old fast and without constant fresh content the game can get stale.
---
Glad that we can make this conversation take a good turn. I play on PC but thanks for the invite.
---
&gt; I really think it's more buffs; most multiplayer games receive balance adjustments. 
---
I agree, lots of legendaries prefixes and weapons need buffs. But I also think that some combo are too strong to stay as they currently are and that these combo prevent any attempt to make the game balance for high level players (both PvE and PvP). I especially think about Lone Wanderer + Blocker + Dodgy which grant 95% reduction from melee damage (and 50% from ranged damage) on top of armor. Or Bloodied + Adrenal Reaction which massively increase damage when low health. I understand that not every players try to get the very best combos but the fact is that when a player do, the game become boring because nothing is a real threat. Players can try to not stick to these combos but in my opinion, it shows that Bethesda didn't really try to balance the game, maybe because they didn't try to get the best combos of perks/mutations/prefixes when they tested the game. I personally want to be able to optimize every aspects of my character without losing the little bit of difficulty there is when you are a fresh naked vault dweller.
---
How much were you buying the serums for? I personally bought 2 for 1400 and he said he was a duper so it made sense why they were so low in price. Unless it was over 4000 caps in price, I don't see how it's worth the other players time. What platform are you on? 
---
So that's a no.
---
Where’s the PvP content?
---
Kinda happy that PVP players are getting their own servers, I think it's what they need.  Not much for them to do right now, the game is just too PVE-focused and it's attempt at PVEVP is pretty meh.
---
Surprised at the current plan to allow existing players to switch over.  That seems like a super bad idea.  Also not sure what they're going to do to balance out low and high level players, since even with brand new characters the low levels will lack the SPECIAL stats and perks to compete.  Maybe should boost everyone who creates a PVP character to 50 so they all get an equal start.
---
Very disappointed that PVE servers weren't announced at the same time.  PVE players are being left with the failed PVEVP experiment.  If PVP players flock to the PVP servers it might get better, but it still leaves PVE players open to griefing.  They need the same treatment, their own servers with rules shifted in the opposite direction, and workshops and nukes tweaked for PVE gameplay.
---
I'm not anti-PVP, but even if it were perfectly balanced it doesn't seem particularly appealing in FO76.  Fighting over workshops is pretty limited, and for what?  Junk you can get everywhere else, at a consistent but slow rate?  I can't use up the junk I already have fast enough, I'm not going to fight over something that slowly pulls it out of the ground.
---
Would really like to see a knock-off of Division's Survival mode instead of a simple free-for-all.  It'd work nicely in this setting, just do something with radiation instead of an infection, bring nukes into the mix, I dunno.  Maybe it'll satisfy the current PVP crowd, which is what matters.  Just not something I see myself getting drawn into.
---
Not really , I’ve seen some threads with like 15 upvotes get Bethesda replies.
---
You do know why your getting downvoted here right?. The community is trying to correct your silliness and you keep refusing to listen lol.
---
Enjoy
---
I do have quite a bit of 5.56! I like claiming the munition factory.
---
But it [IS](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/316411/so-my-account-was-banned-no-support-response/3?language%5B%5D=en&amp;page=1) happening.
---
My *naivety* is a result of *your* ignorance.
---
I agree. When Fallout 76 was announced the first thing I thought was all the cool possibilities with the different factions. 
---
Huge disappointment is the only thing that comes to mind. And a wasted opportunity too.
---
This is a really neat idea. Maybe to balance it a bit, make it so those particular stashes are only accessible at your CAMP.
---
So the same general STASH we have now, with 600 weight limit. Then, back at CAMP you can craft individual STASH boxes specific to different item types that have separate, weight limits, say 150-300?
---
That way you can really start to hoard materials and power armor, but you can't readily access it all the time like you can things in your main stash, so you still need to consider what you keep in or out of your main STASH vs. on your character.
---
The regular ones yes, but not legendary..they wil at least have ammo, aid, something but not nothing. All of the ghouls had zero loot. 
---
I would say that the end game content is not pathetic. It's great * If you haven't done it over and over again.*
---
It's really not, playing with friends and helping others out is what makes the game fun and it seems you haven't really played the game otherwise you would know that
---
Interesting as I just came across a youtube video describing the origin and difference between various types of machine guns. One big factor for LMGs, was that they would typically use the same caliber rifle round that troops were already carrying (7.62 nato, 30-06, etc) for convenience. Even some belt-fed weapons could take a regular rifle mag in a pinch.
---
So .308 is reasonably accurate, though I fully agree though that it's BS That the same .308 round only does 20% as much damage from an LMG. I guess it's "game balance" because automatic weapons might otherwise be OP. But really, given the number of rounds they chew through you already have to conserve their use, or constantly farm mats to print ammo. I feel like that's really enough balance right there.
---
Mostly it sucks to finally progress enough in the game to get what you expect to be reasonably powerful weapons, only to find out their effective use is extremely limited or requires a lot of additional grinding. Meanwhile you probably have to throw away or ignore half the ammo you actually find in the world because you can't do anything with it if you don't have a weapon that uses that.
---
I actaully managed to unlock nuka tapper. You need to remove your copy( the one you get in vault 76) before picking up a new copy of nuka tapper.
---
Dropping and picking up your own holotape didn't work. 
---
No, I believe they could change the ammo weight and thirst/hunger, I just don't think they should. And yes, your suggestion is as simple as changing a variable to 0, probably one of the easiest to implement suggestions I've seen. 
---
Now if they made a 3rd mode - Casual - I'd be all for your ideas. Make it exactly like FO4 normal mode.
---
The 10mm smg could definitely need some love from the developers. It doesn't have any sights/scopes, the magazines are all the same capacity, and like you said, it doesn't have a suppressor. 
---
On the plus side, I like how the recoil works, and how relatively common 10mm ammo is to find in the wild. 
---
I agree. I said from the very beginning that they should have launched FO76 as an "early access" title, considering how many bugs were present at launch.
---
&gt; but wonder how many more times they'd have to do this as more exploits are found.
---
This is also one of my concerns. They need to make it clear that anyone who uses a duping exploit will be perma banned. I think a warning like this would drastically reduce the number of people who participate in duping, even if a new exploit is found
---
Does anyone else think that fast travel should be disabled for Survival difficulty? I could see people fast traveling away or even worse camping spawn points to instantly kill players moving across the map. If they implemented no player markers on the map this would further the randomness of encounters even more with people needing to actually travel around on foot. I don't fast travel in the current game and it is completely doable to travel across the map on foot.
---
This method was the wrong idea.
---
\-swoons and fans herself-
---
I’m not a duper, these are found in my normal travels. I’ve got about 20 total cores and 20 total bobbleheads that I’ve accumulated playing the game. I’m just unlikely to use them for my character and would like to trade them to someone who could.
---
Hard to tell what you hit in a mob.  If there wasn’t any loot you probably didn’t kill them.
---
&gt;It’s common sense to seek out a ticket system in a game’s forums when you’re experiencing issues. This shouldn’t be something new or confusing. 
---
Bullshit. I'm not going to seek out and sign up for the forums for every fucking game I play just in case I need to file a complaint or highlight an issue. 
---
You know what *is* common sense? Having fucking server logs that track dropped connections and other issues like this so they can analyze the trends and fix the problem without relying on us sending tickets to their CS reps. 
---
he will delete this thread since it is inundated with downvotes..amazing job OP
---
Likely YouTube heat is a factor here. Also, it could be that coding wise it was easier to duplicate the production instance and toggle off the PVP safety protocols and make some minor tweaks. Maybe when they address more of the balancing issues we’ll see a hard core PVE option.
---
Holy shit, actual proof (If true)
---
I actually didn't think there's any way anyone could even begin to prove that
---
Iam on ps4 and bought 4 serums for about 1,2 k.. but again, nothing unusual and I bought 4 different ones. I bought off a duper in the past, nothing like this happened before. 
---
I did not say that that was the case.
---
I simply asked you to answer a hypothetical question.
---
But you completely ignored my last post and responded with "But *I* don't want to", and now you're backtracking, so you obviously aren't interested in having a conversation in good faith.
---
That's sorta how i'm starting to view it. Was hoping other players would change my mind but the few comments on here aren't doing that lol.
---
Anthem is pre-ordered now though so I wont be playing for much longer. 
---
 My new char has found all the Heavy Leather plans and is now level 42. ;)
---
Well if if makes ya feel better SBQ despawns 25% of the time before my loot loads.
---
&gt;Am I having a stroke, or is Bethesda actively ignoring all the ways in which players will abuse and grief Survival Mode? 
---
Just in case, 
---
https://www.cdc.gov/stroke/signs_symptoms.htm
---
That's the answer I like
---
Totally agree, and why I think the LMG is basically useless. Heavy-weapons is turning out to really not be that great of a build, except for niche applications where you need a ton of firepower for a short time. Miniguns are fun but I can't even pretend to keep enough ammo for them. 
---
While we're at it can we have the option to just disable PvP entirely? 
---
It's broke AF and just not fun and I'd rather just play with friends than worry about some asshat one shotting me out of nowhere
---
Well I don't care about down votes or up votes. The community obviously hasn't run into this issue. I have seen people post issues that I never ran into. Just because it hasn't happened to you doesn't mean it doesn't happen. I am not refusing anything, you just think you are all wise about the game.
---
The ammo is gone. If you pull the head out and it says more than 1 is in the magazine you’re just wasting it all. To get around it if you like the head... store or give your buddy all but 1 cell and draw the head. Get all cells back. Head works as normal. Have to watch it though. Sometimes it glitches back on me or will load a random number of cells when drawn. Never had it glitch while out and using it though. Just after a weapon swap
---
Main questions i have raised.
---
Problems with the server setup that i think will kill it within months.
---
How do they balance solo and group play?. Will 4 man groups just wipe out solo players?. Will solo ques and group ques differ?.
---
Dropping more than just junk and doubling the caps wouldn't that scare off pvpers in 76 if they are not in teams?. Team mates could pick up your stuff for you again not sure thats gonna do well.
---
What about all the items and crap we could bring over, wouldn't it deter new players to the setup?. This i am not 100% on could be ok just needs alot balance between scaling of levels. Go to normal servers and farm everything in peace then take it all over to pvp server????.
---
Then what about gear in general how will that even be balanced?. Its not balanced at the moment and that wrecks alot of the game already. Its also why 76 pvp is so shite at the moment. Its not a skill based setup. Throw on sents with player damage reduction and a nice AAE and TSE...
---
I think the best way to do this is to have it as an option at character creation. Level playing field to start.
---
I think the creative team would benefit from looking at what works in the games that are successful and popular in the styles they're looking to emulate. 
---
As I type it, it seems harsh. I just really would like for this game to succeed, despite the issues it has faced.
---
Venders
---
It's because your questions are nonsensical.  
---
Ah DayZ.  Fond memories of adrenaline fueled fights in berizino 😁
---
Take your circle jerking hate somewhere else, man. Get off of this sub
---
I think you're just unlucky in this situation. That guy was totally a duper though. No way they were selling that price legitimately. It's always good to restart the game though when dealing with server mishaps. If I ever deal with those types of problems, I try again later and it works fine. 
---
Damn good post.
---
The double caps and more loot thing is cool in my opinion. Raising the stakes is a nice way to make this mode more exciting. Its not just punishing, it can also be rewarding. 
---
I agree with all other points though. They have to adress them if they want to make this mode work.
---
Ive read all the other comments you have made on other posts. You seem like a pretty hateful person in real life. From what ive read you definitely don't care about fallout76 the players or the economy. Your delusional. Very delusional. Any further comments out of you is not even worth my response. 
---
There are tier of legendaries, just as their are for non-legendary weapons. No one has discussed nerfing the sentinal armor prefix, which is a top tier and OP like TSE.
---
Seriously, how can a weapon shoot two projectiles but only do moderately more damage? As someone said before, the prefix should be renamed 1.25 shot. 😜
---
Slightly non sequitor, but if we are going to talk balance, non-ballistic weapons are hilariously underpowered and with weak durability.
---
World hopping legendaries and vendors
---
Thanks.  Although I already had every mutation for my build already by doing that.  And it makes gameplay stale.  Also they turn fallout into a COD action shooter.  And that would be stupid more stupid in all PVP gameplay.  More so than it already is. 
---
Hey! Who turned out the lights!?
---
That's what that level 10 was doing the other day, lmao. Man I forget people are douches. 
---
I was like was does this level 10 keep jumping in front of me while I'm trying to kill shit, what's the game... now I see, Probably hyped up on Bobbleheads. After a minute or two he realised I was pacifist and left.
---
Yea the old "we've got news for you soon then going quite for a week is getting old". 
---
The last into the vault was vague, and whilst this one seemed longer it took 5 paragraphs to say PVP servers and a few bug fixes coming at the end of the month. 
---
Starting to become a bit of a joke now Bethesda, one of the biggest franchises in gaming going and the devs can't be straight with there customers because they've got no clue what there doing.
---
So we all know that survival mode wont be the only content coming, the problem is thats not coming till March right, middle or end i guess cos when did a game company ever say a month and launch on the first of that month. So that's 5 months from launch. 5 months of buggy exploited broken mechanics. How long till we hear about this PVE content, will it be coming in March as well or we looking at another 5 months after that. 
---
Sure but the fact is, they haven't handled it, and I can't understand how anyone would want to play in an open pvp world loaded with duped god guns. On top of that, it's the only reason I can see why anyone would reroll, since any build can become any other build with enough levels to swap specials and perks.  
---
I am unwilling to operate under the assumption that the game will be balanced by the time this server launches.
---
Even if it *is* fixed by then, a fresh server would still be a completely different experience, one far more deserving of the name "Survival" versus something like "Bloodbath."
---
That first 20 seconds is nerve-wracking for me trying to figuure out what's shooting at me or standing right behind me...scorched, super mutants or ghouls?! And I can't shoot or dive into my non-existent house!
---
How did you get your sniper nodded up to 170dmg please?
---
Stim healing on a timer?  Amazing idea!!
---
I won't delete anything. I don't care about the votes it gets. I was stating something that has happened to me 3 seperate times over 2 weeks. Just because others hasn't had this issue doesn't mean it is not true. I have seen multiple posts on here about an issue that never has happened to me.
---
I wasnt replying to your comment genius, read the thread
---
Griefing is about deliberately fucking with people who don't want to be fucked with, why would a troll want to even the playing field at all?
---
Support replied today with a canned response, if you submitted a support ticket before, you've probably seen this message before.  In short, they'll pass my ticket along to the development team for review... well, hope the dev team will do something to fix it then...    8\^(
---
Is this a rare thing on PS4?
---
On PC, the highest I've seen is 200. Most people I've seen are sub 100, quite often just 10.
---
So then why are you still on the subreddit, and why did you make a post on the subreddit? Any person with half a brain would understand that this is blatant attention whoring 
---
Link won't load for me, I will assume it is to the TwoShot and Explosive changes.
---
Yes, that's a nice first step, but took *months* of complaining, and we don't have *months* for more changes before this mode happens.
---
2500 for me south of The Whitespring Station.
---
This has been 3 separate occasions over 2 weeks.
---
Friend request sent.
---
Same, I love PvP.  
---
I'm assuming it's not all they've been doing. Another dev team are probably working on another drop in a couple of months.
---
What I'd love is some sort of team PVE event. I go to vault ## and I load into a random (or friends) 4 person team. We then have to 1) fight to the overseers office and hack a console while holding back hordes of scorched - which at one point needs 2 people hacking at once - to unlock the armoury.  or 2) split up and navigate a set of maintenance tunnel while fighting things to find a randomly placed body in a time limit to unlock a cave system under the fissures and blow them up (same end result as nuke and we go out to nuke zone).  or 3) Find pre war tech for the brotherhood in the vault. It's hugely heavy and makes 1 person slow to move and unable to fight. Rest of the team must protect that player to the end.  Or  4) something else that makes us team up and help each other out in a PVE environment.
---
Same here. Last time I waited for several minutes for the 18 pounds of loot noted in her inventory to actually load for me, then she just despawned. Wasted my ammo, time and Orbital Strike beacons.
---
5k person we came to remove them found them naked near overseer camp near a C.A.M.P and a stash box.
---
Person gave 37 caps on kill so they should have a long debuff of minus 50% damage to players since its increased per 100 caps.
---
They did not fight back i believe they wanted us to.
---
sometimes the RNG gods are not on your side..there were a couple of times (at whitesprings) where i would take out a legendary and they would either drop nothing..or i would get something like a hairbrush or something..but as other people have said..no one steals your loot at all
---
I think so since people killed will drop more than just junk.  Looks like they’ll drop caps and “aid” stuff.  That seems like water, food, and drugs.  I’m looking forward to this.
---
They are vastly different as a species.  Griefers are really just childish d*cks without any sense of purpose.  
---
But, as  mentioned, giving the PVP side a place where they are free to RP factions, play lone snipers, or just have a good time also means Beth can eliminate many things that allow griefers to be jerks on the pve co-op side...without screwing the real PvP players.
---
Not sure about that. I want open PvP badly.
---
Ummmmmmm.....
---
I don't have a two shot and I've spent countless hours leveling up and picking perk cards that work with the random drop weapons that I've received.
---
Absolutely no f'ing way do I went a reset.
---
How is that relevant if you aren't even using it? .308 is expensive to craft relative to other types, that's not wrong. And from running a rifle/sniper build for most of the game I can say that even on a bolt action it's easy to go through more than you find in the wild.
---
Fair enough, understandable. If I came off a little snarky i apologize not my intent
---
As long as the 20% explosive damage still scales with the INT perk for explosives it still should be good though, I don't think they said anything about that changing unless it will be a stealth nerf.
---
I found the accuracy penalty isn't **too** bad, at least, as long as you're not trying to do long distance sniping. Seems it mostly is effected by hip firing and VATS. So I could see how it would be rough for people using it with Sniper Rifles or VATS builds, but it was manageable for me on my Heavy Weapons build as long as I was engaging in close to medium range.
---
Either way, I can see melee becoming a lot more popular now.
---
I dont want a refund.
---
Even with the bugs Ive had many hours of enjoyment.
---
So I guess your childish rant doesnt hold water...REEEEEEEEEEEE!
---
Like I wrote I already waited 3 hours and it keeps crashing after I fast travel. It seems that is has sth to do with the power armor, bc when Iam not in it it doesn’t crash. But I have to put it on bc I’m overpacked... some other guy recommended to reinstall the game. 
---
So we can look forward to hundreds of posts complaining that no one can trade safely? No marks on the map when you are at the trade stations maybe but you are gonna need to be findable somehow. 
---
While I look forward to a proper "no-rules" survival experience...  
---
  
---
This will not be it, PvE does not work properly, PvP less so...  
---
Making a no-rules PvP mode at this time is misguided at best, and may end up destroying any potential for a proper survival mode in the future at worst...  
---
Adding things on top of a broken foundation will never end well...
---
Come find me 💕
---
I don't recall disagreeing with much you said there if anything. The problem they face is nerfing stuff is going to make people super unhappy. But at the same time it will probably be good for pvp. So it's one of those damned if you do and damned if you don't situations.
---
Super rough, but I dont disagree.
---
Workshops and vendors
---
Yes and no. There should be some sort of limiter. For example. Level 50 killing a level 5 should not get all their stuff or junk. Make the killing not worth more than bragging rights. Perhaps even make the level 5 invisible on radar to the 50 after the first death.  Then as a lowbie I know that I was pwn’d but it didn’t destroy the game for me. 
---
However two level 30 fighting and one dying should result in some sort of downside for the loser. 
---
You could even scale it further.  A level 100 killing a level 10 could result in a payment of 90 caps to the level 10 from the level 100.   (one cap per level difference assuming the level 100 initiated the fight)
---
Don't think anyone would ever play on the server. Or imagine a group of 4 just popping everyone at the vault.
---
Same here. I maxed out an assault rifle, used it for a couple hours and then randomly found a decent handmade. Now the assault rifle is a joke by comparison.
---
He was probably playing the new PvP beta.
---
I cant put the armor pieces on a frame yet. They are higher level than me. Have to store the pieces individually. I know it seems stupid to hold onto them but I would like a decent looking set of power armor when I get to the right level. The stash weight limit still needs to be increased.
---
Ok next step, why don’t you agree?  What’s your insight? 
---
Personally I think that for anyone who paid full price or pre-payed before release there should be some serious perks given for enduring Bethesda's Beta Testing that IMO is still in progress.  The game wasn't ready when released and still isn't close to what anyone realistically could call a Final Product and that is pretty Crappy on Bethesda's part.  They pushed the game for a Christmas release when it wasn't ready for $$$ at everyone who purchased it's expense.    
---
Don't get me wrong, I do like the game, and I hope they keep fixing it and making it more playable (especially on the end game side), but Bethesda if you read this know that even as a serious Fallout Fan I will never again buy into any Bethesda "Early Release" ... From here on out I will wait till it's out for a while and when it's a finished product with good reviews I "Might" decided to purchase.  You severely hurt your credibility as a quality game developer by the way you released F76, and anyone that games more than just casually will not forget this anytime soon!
---
Not when I shot and killed all of the ghouls. This time I killed all but one and the one I didn't kill I didn't even search. I killed both legendaries before the other player even showed up I only had a few left that were attacking me while I was switched to my melee. So yeah I know I killed them or got a shot in.
---
Does seem to be rare, most bounties i see are usually under 100 but this guy was griefing the hell out of afk players. He was racking up caps by the minute.
---
I don't know why I'm bothering with this, a major point of your argument is "but I don't like it."
---
I hope we both can find enjoyment in whatever they decide to do.
---
The con of having death be such a high risk means people won't play it at all. Why bother going for stuff when every bit of it can be taken even when you're not around your base?
---
I think some of their pricing is outta whack, but tbh a lot of it seems fine compared to other in-game economies (not just f2p ones either).
---
Hairstyles I think are priced okay-ish even if I don't like the current ones on offer, home goods are alright mostly....some of these costumes are not! Considering I can't customize them at all (even color-wise) costumes feel super over-priced which is too bad! :(
---
my thoughts? corporate being incredibly disconnected from their consumer base again.
---
I dont mind pvp, but leaderboards and shit are for a different crowd....
---
I'll probably still try it though.
---
So no "New" content until March? Really?
---
Its survival mode, nothing us guaranteed. You can trade with others at your own risk. Players might set up a trade just to lure you into a trap. It's the post apocalypse, all rules are out the window. Follow your own code but dont expect people to follow it with you. If you are trading with someone then odds are you already know their name, message them and coordinate a trade location. It's easy, no idea how that is so confusing 
---
This argument makes no sense.
---
If this new mode requires new characters to be made then after less than a month you'll have a mode FULL of geared, max level characters that can just stomp anyone new. You'll be exactly where we are now only there'd be no way to level a character before entering survival. 
---
Alternatively, the proposed system, people could hop in and out of this mode at will. Leveling up and gearing low level characters until they're prepared and Then hop into survival. 
---
I don't see many vegan options. /s
---
I really appreciate you taking the time to write out such a detailed paper on the PvP system. I can tell how passionate you are about this game and we really want to say thank you! I’ve included ideas from this in my report to send to the developers. Thanks again for taking the time to write this! 
---
My wife and I play together too. We absolutely love it despite its flaws. I love power armor, she just wants to kill everyone and everything. 
---
&gt; Seriously, how can a weapon shoot two projectiles but only do moderately more damage? 
---
The same way we can find guns with magical effects. 
---
&gt; No one has discussed nerfing the sentinal armor prefix, which is a top tier and OP like TSE. 
---
They 100% deserve a nerf. Personally I think both Sentinel and Cavalier shouldn't even apply to PvP. Rumor has been that effects stacking on armour is going away with the next patch, which would mean bye-bye to their OP'ness.
---
There is no wide discussion of a nerf for multiple reasons:
---
1) They're not as widely known, or obvious when being used, except when used against you
---
2) They're not as widely distributed among the playerbase
---
3) They still have the downside of being situational, and unusable in nuke zones.
---
&gt; non-ballistic weapons are hilariously underpowered and with weak durability. 
---
Again, other things also needing to be fixed is not relevant to this thing needing to be fixed. It just means they need to be fixed. That said, with the right perk set up, melee can put out insane damage.
---
What gear you run?

There's a few spots I check when wandering, Pylon V-13 had Light Boxes for me yesterday and there's often a weapon or armor plan behind the L3 lock gate at Camp Venture. Events drop me one now and again, the 'Powering Up...' ones are guaranteed to provide a generator plan.

You cannot remove the hood or craft the helmet separately. Really unfortunate
---
I don't understand why this is such a big deal. Two weeks after the mode launches this conversation won't even matter, actually wait, now that I think about it, wouldn't character transfers be beneficial to everyone who doesn't start in the first two weeks it launches? Giving them a chance to catch up in nonpvp to have a chance in this mode? Over the lifetime of the game, having character transfers would be beneficial to more people than not having them to just appease the people who play the mode as soon as it comes out.
---
So perhaps to maybe make everyone happy, no character transfers for the first month? Then allow them afterwards.
---
 Obligatory, "That’s now how it works. That’s not how any of this works.” 
---
At harpers ferry straight ahead in that building with the huge round hole in the wall, enter and look in the glass cases for recipes and plans. This place also has a shortcut which safely leads to the vendor.
---
How do you know that the gear you traded for wasn't duped?
---
TSE wasn't the only thing being duped. If in game trading were not a thing duping wouldn't exist. 
---
Ah, I see, so the dev room had every legendary combination on pretty much every piece of armor and weapons. And obviously if you only took one or two sets of really powerful gear, there's not really any way for Bethesda to track that and get rid of it since it would be identical to one that could be potentially legitimate.
---
[removed]
---
It is in fantastic condition for a pre alpha
---
Dupers are being banned, and PvP balance being broken is an entirely separate issue.
---
A PvP mode will be dumb no matter what kind of barrier to entry you impose so long as you'll eventually have people running around who can utterly stomp anyone else with impunity. 
---
We’re on Xbox also but I don’t think that was us. Awesome story though!
---
Survival mode and adventure mode??? What did i miss??????
---
Bear in mind, by high level zones I mean either Whitespring, West Tek or Fissure Prime. The place where people go to farm for either leggendaries or flux, essentially 
---
That's an interesting theory, I would love to go back to the older Fallout games and try to pick up easter eggs that we may have not realised were there at first!
---
 Mutated is kinda a stretch, but I agree on other two
---
Dont listen to these sissies, surviving is based off of a game of survival of the fittest, 
---
Also,when doin this,remember to attach the hair to the head.some hairstyles are just wigs and you can see your bald head underneath when you jump.
---
2 shot explosive weapons are getting a huge nerf before survival so I dont see how this is an issue
---
Loot in containers (anything that isn’t just laying on the ground) are different for everyone looting it. If you didn’t get anything there’s only a few things I can think of that would explain: you didn’t hit them, the loot didn’t load in by the time you stopped trying to loot, or it didn’t drop any loot. 
---
But no way in hell attacking the queen would be a good idea..... I think that's why they wanted fluidity between the modes.
---
That takes actual work and man hours, aka money. With survival they just flip some switches to turn off PvP restrictions and call it a day. I bet you their execs are telling them to wait so they can gauge if it's even worth producing large scale DLC.
---
The vaults will probably just be short dungeons full of even spongier enemies. After the announcement today I don't have much faith in the future of PvE in this game. We're not getting anything for months. The game will be a ghost town by then and people aren't going to be fired up to come back. 
---
Totally agree about the ammo cost. The bear arms perk makes the weight much less of a pain. It's a little absurd actually, because of how much heavier rifles are in comparison.
---
Give 1 hour _invincible and can't do any damage to players_ passive to every new started characters. Fixed.
---
I personally like it at 600 forces me to not be a Horder. You should see some of my Skyrim builds... *Hangs head in shame* 
---
&gt;How do you know that the gear you traded for wasn't duped?
---
That's part of my point. Nobody knows what was duped and what was not. The only solution is a total item reset.
---
I know it hurts to lose rightfully-acquired items, but the sooner the devs do this, the less painful it will be for the player base. Like pulling a bandaid.
---
all sorts of different things but mostly melee with my bloodied swing speed power fist - I can spec into shotguns or heavy guns at a moment's notice and I like to play with a two shot harpoon flechette gun as well
---
So far my favorite armor loadout has been unyielding because I like having a lot of risk and playing the game a bit harder, the bonus strength is nice though.
---
Primarily I dislike the handshake PvP system because from my experience it's super easy to abuse if you're the second person to attack (that is, confirm combat / PvP) and win. So that's why I'd rather play here, even if it means I can get cheesed as well - my shots should count if I don't want to PvP you I should be careful not to shoot you, etc. But that's all because I'm a sucker for difficulty. 
---
That should be a feature of any 'survival' server, it was standard in FO4 on that difficulty setting and made the world seem much larger and more 'real'.
---
Wait. Are they adding a new mode where you’d start over? Or are they just wiping every account?
---
On the plus side, this means that the old excuse about not showing any server selection being the reason there's no PVE servers is now proven to be complete and utter bullshit.
---
They're showing separate servers... so make one of them a PVE one.  Like we've been fucking asking for from day one.
---
YOU MUST CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL PYLONS
---
After my 300+ hours of legit play buying only from vendor bota..... that's it done!...... would be correct.
---
 Hardcore
---
Don’t know any guaranteed but I’ve generally found they near Sugar Grove or northeast (more north than east) from Watoga
---
It's not how it is supposed to work, but 3 times it happened.
---
I have no idea, bud. I think no one outside of Bethesda can answer that.
---
You can freely switch with their proposed system. What OP wants is for people to be locked into one or the other. 
---
I've tried a few. The plasma sniper is surprisingly effective, and I had an automatic laser that was pretty decent too. Of course they still all broke after a few reloads but I actually did enjoy using them.
---
No in the latest inside the vault post, they showed in the future they are adding a new PvP game mode called survival mode and you can carry your character over and have fun. It will start off as a beta 
---
Their are now many post on the front page by people arguing that everyone should start over and you should not be able to carry your character over.
---
I've got 300+ hours in the game and never bought anything from anyone other than a vendor bot.
---
They can reset the accounts of people who were trading.....not me!
---
Depends what sort of plans we are talking about.
---
Building plans you get from doing workshop defense missions which is an easy/cheap way to get a bunch.
---
More specific building/weapons/armor plans are from the better vendors like the BOS Watoga and Harpers Ferry vendor.
---
Grafton vendors have some good combat armor plans.
---
Weapon plans you can get by doing the prison missions.
---
Other than that I get a lot of plans from trading with other people or hitting up spots that they may spawn.
---
Ctrl+F npcs 
---
Rip 
---
I disagree. 
---
It doesn't matter if they force a hard reset for PvP.  Within days there would be players that already have a min/max character and othera that have real lives and responsibilities that hinder their progression.
---
Treehouse village has a high rate of spawning fog crawlers, just server hop there.
---
You really need bear arms and ordinance express for missile launchers to become viable to even carry around. Before that I'd just pick up the ones I'd find on Molemen or whatever, use up the missiles and then just toss them.
---
yup!
---
Amazing isnt it, if they had listened to there customers we would be looking at a proper DLC perhaps.
---
Private servers as well might have caught dupers quicker n all. If there was only 2 people per server that both had 29836452729 weight on them its pretty obvious whats going on lol
---
No, the Inside the Vault that came out today says you can use the same account on both modes, but warns that anything that happens in either affects the other. Some of the community today has voiced concerns because of the common availability of TSE weapons and Bobblehead stacking and have called for making these PvP servers new accounts only to combat this
---
600 is fine. What I want is more camp budget, like I know it scales with level but, I'm level 54 and it still feels too small
---
Nah, the dude got banned for duping. His thread is actually about not getting an initial notice but after a followup he pasted the response. So bans are happening.
---
Yeah, i havent played any pre fo3 fallouts but would love for them to be remade in the newest engine
---
Yeah those are really the only two worth using in my opinion.
---
I mean, even just crafting moderate amounts of stuff all by yourself can lag or outright crash the game if you click too fast. It's much more stable now than it was before, but it's not like every issue is fixed and certain things we do don't increase the chance for lags and crashes. It doesn't always have to be intentional duping.  
---
You don't have to interrogate everyone. Some people probably just don't want to start again. It's a long grind for some of us, especially people who get swamped by work or school (bought the game launch day and am barely LVL 43).
---
Wait what's going on can I get a tl:dr or a refresher?
---
Rolling with a *1 star two-shot lever, a furious lever (In case the two-shot breaks), two-shot black powder and a plan Jane fully modded up Hunting Rifle (Farming Robots and other things I can one shot with sneak to save .45 ammo).
---
I cant believe how on point this post is. I wish I could upvote it 10 times. 
---
Just reduce the pace of PvP by reducing player-to player damage by 50%. Calculate all the insane damage and armor pen everyone does and then just cut it in half when applying it to another player. It's not a nerf really if it affects everyone across the board. Headshot sneak crits would still one-shot everyone but the most durable character builds. All the playstyles would still be useful for killing players, there'd just be real combat between attacking a player and killing a player.
---
There are some people who put their CAMP right next to the golf clubhouse so they can chew through the horde as soon as they respawn and take all the drops for themselves which is what everyone here will assume you are doing if you mention you have turrets and a CAMP at Whitesprings.
---
Sorry, I completely disagree. RNG is a bitch, agreed. But it shouldn't start off with level 150 TSE shotgunners all over the place. Absolute hard pass. 
---
Back when I worked for BlockBuster we would getting weekly destroy/RTV "return to vendor" lists weekly. I DO NOT HAVE ANY CONCRETE INFORMATION purely speculation. But I believe either the standard edition is getting pulled for a premium edition OR they will be sending new standard edition games with the patchs already included.
---
Same here. Sounds neat. But not bnb if currentvgesr Carries over.
---
I think that's very true... So part of the problem this person is experiencing is that if he has a low end weapon that does very little damage and the mob is quickly waxed by someone who is OP he might not be getting any legendaries because of it, which might be hard to fix when fighting the SBQ because everyone is using the best that they have.  
---
I know that normally I try to switch weapons for the mobs and legendaries to give everyone a chance, or tag and run etc. But there are a lot of players who don't know how this works (like the poster not knowing that everyone gets separate loot) that can make it difficult for everyone to have a rewarding experience.
---
I do blame Bethesda for a lot of this because when you purchase the game they should have a wealth of information right up front to explain how the game works, what all the perk cards are and do and how to effectively use them and the same for crafting etc. and all this information should be easy to access with a tab right on the game menu, or via tutorials to familiarize new players with the game.  Instead everyone has to rely on places like this for information and weed through all the misinformation that's here as well.

Claim workshop -&gt; quest rewards -&gt; defend said workshop -&gt; another quest rewards -&gt; server hope -&gt; rinse and repeat

Somebody got nearly 1000 trashing my CAMP. I was overencumbered and couldn't get to them. It sucked so bad. I was throwing stuff in a paper bag seeing what I could do but it was pointless, the friend took the bounty and they disappeared. I would have loved to fast travel there and mess them up, but it wasn't meant to be. I come accross a camp and I shot the mobs that spawn with me, repair the fence, repair the generator, etc. It feels good. I wonder how anyone can feel good trashing someones CAMP. But I like that it's a part of the game. It means I can be the good Raider who if I can get my inventory under control maybe I can do something about those jerks.
---
Most likely, like some else mentioned it either glitched and gave no loot, hadn’t completely loaded and you need to check back,  or you got hit with an endless loot load and it timed out. I have run across this myself.  
---
M'kay.  Not going to quibble then. Regarding bobble heads,  I usually just sell mine to vendors.  I never had a use for them since they aren't the draw for me that they are in 3 and 4. 
---
I think they should allow the characters, just not the items from adventure so people don't have to regrind levels, plans, and recipes.
---
That's adventure mode, lol
---
Why should I have to start over at all considering I have put hundreds of hours optimizing the perfect PVP build through trial and error, hoping for some kind of pvp mode to use it in.
---
The people complaining are the ones that spent the last 3 months running around in passive mode hoarding duct tape and perking for weight reduction.
---
Look, don't get me wrong, I'm not downing the way other people play. Its a game, play the way that is fun for you. 
---
But, if I suddenly decided I wanted to focus on base building, or a strictly PVE build, I would have to put some hours into doing so.
---
First I would need to get some perks I still dont have by lveling up. Then Id have to move a bunch of S.P.E.C.I.A.L points around by leveling some more. Lastly I would need to (once again) somehow find a set of  impossible to get 3* legendaries. It would Probably take me another 15-20 lvls to get the build the way I wanted it. Maybe more.
---
It feels perfectly fair to me that hoarders and passive PVE heroes should have to do the same thing respectively if they were to decide they wanted to change up their playstyle and PVP. 
---
Either that or maybe Bethesda needs to scrap them for the plastic to bulk wrap some junk... Just a thought.
---
For sure.
---
Oh, I thought it was just a disingenuous community manager who just keeps repeating things like "we hear your concerns" or "I'll let the dev team know".
---
I didn't know she used to be somebody.
---
 Yes I played F4 to death on survival. AP means so much more. ;)
---
I have about 20 I can give? Various fills and will be on in about 20 mins? 
---
I've seen them at the Bootleggers shack and Creekside Sundew Grove in the cranberry bog.  Scared the hell outta me the first time.
---
Or you know, this is just stupid.
---
Forcing people to start new characters for a PvP mode means that only people who start playing it right now will ever be able to do it. I give it less than a month before you have people running around with min-maxed overpowered crap, even without duping.
---
Anyone who doesn't start immediately and dump ridiculous amounts of time in won't be able to compete. 
---
I absolutly love and support the idea of pvp servers but what i don't like is losing hard earned caps for every death. Think about it your always going to get those people who absoluty dominate every server with thier team and annihilate everyone and drain them capless i dont want to lose all 5,6 or even 15 thousand caps in just a few short deaths because of some assholes with a grudge only targeting me. Already people do not want to pvp because they dont want to lose caps theyve spent ages getting to use on valuable recourses in game. I think pvp kills should be  XP based.
---
2nd we are all used to dropping junk upon a death but now its being mixed up by dropping aid items too. This is all good in its sence but how much aid are we talking about? 1of each item we have, half or even all of our aid. Again i think dropping too much is just an incentive for god tier players to farm players and take them for everything they have. This ripple effect will also steer people away from pvp.
---
Lastly the inside the vault says aswel as double caps and dropping aid you will also drop other things.!! What other things!? NOW IM WORRIED... weapons? armour? I hope not this is a bad bad bad idea bethesda, i dont want to work my ass off getting a legendary weapon or peice of armour ive been waiting so long to get and then get killed and lose them instantly.. what if my legendary weapon is the only weapon i have to defend myself in the wasteland and i drop it upon death then im screwed and defenceless and open to being killed time and time again.. why on earth would i want to participate in that why would anyone want to lose their hard earned and loved items???
---
If you really want to make a success of pvp servers why not do game modes like BATTLE ROYAL or TEAM DEATHMATCH. evryone gets a small reward for participating but the winner recieves a greater reward like more caps or legendary items. Just imagine playing battle royal on a map of this size with the amount of people a server can hold and the radioactive storm closing in.. just a concept in my head but makes more sence and gets people playing and entertained for months if not years!!!
---
It's more than fixing up the train stations too, you'll have to clear tracks, rebuild bridges, and build the trains themselves.  Seems like there's a lot of room for content, events, etc.
---
I'd recognize that grass anywhere ... you build in Whitesprings, too!
---
yea im still on for around 30 mins just to explore and check vendors but other than that im just waiting for real solid content
---
Imo let us transfer characters, but not items. 
---
And to only release it AFTER duping and the developer rooms are shown to be fully patched out. When we know that a week later someone else isn't just going to find a way.
---
&gt; Exactly how I've seen it. A challenge. I've currently found a way to keep 4 different sets of full PA alongside ~20 full FC's and thousands of rounds of ammo and various legendary items
---
Double Calibrated Shocks, Bandolier, Batteries Included (now you can up that chump change 20 FCs to 200 FCs), Pack Rat, etc. It's not a challenge it's just boring af and unsatisfying.
---
try tongue but hole?
---
That is what my entire suggestion is haha, a game mode that doesn’t have the thirst, hunger, ammo weight. I don’t want to remove the original game mode I would like an additional one. 
---
'Allow wanted players to shoot first' (?) No. Most of the wanted players who have the most caps to lose are the ones of a higher level who go around killing honest players of a lower level with higher level weapons just to get their kicks by griefing. I'm sick of having to log off when I'm in the middle of doing something because I can see grubs on the map who are obviously getting their jollies by shooting as many other players as possible ( I can tell because the bounty keeps going up as they're moving) and I can see that they're headed for me. It sucks. The wanted flags are there for a reason - to warn the rest of us about the shit-bags and to tell people that there is a bounty available. This is working well. It takes the d'bags out of the game and provides an extra hobby for bounty hunters.  The bounty system can't function without the wanted flags or people wouldn't be able to find the decent bounties because the map is so large and there are so few players. 
---
I don't even own any normal armor.  But after they fixed the Fusion Core refill I may have to find some 
---
I'd also love if it were seasonal.  Like, every few months it gets wiped similar to D3 seasonal characters or something. 
---
Hey valseek as always thanks for the post buddy. Can we please, please have the option to turn all pvp off in game. Pacifist is terrible man and i don't like having my base wrecked. Its expensive and annoying every time.
---
I truly dislike 76 pvp i have no idea what the devs are thinking. But the game is not balanced at all for pvp like at all.... how they allowed sent armor to stack with reduced player damage is beyond me. 
---
If i want to pvp i will play a game built from the ground up for pvp. But Fallout has always been pve focused and i expected to be able to do that with mates in 76. We need an option to completely opt oit of pvp as soon as possible.
---
It's really hard to enjoy the game at the moment with the lack of end game content. I spend my time helping others i don't want to have to deal with people thinking its funny to get in the way of that and then level my camp....
---
Unless you are over-encumbered as most of us are, even with very little in our inventory. 
---
It's punishing other players for duping and it's a terrible idea. You just assume you'll be running into other players in a MASSIVE world too. That's hilarious. Why do I have vanguard armor in your fantasy? 
---
Honestly, I don't know shit about armor. I have a bunch of different kinds on and no real grasp of how most of the perks work either. I will die in pvp because I've never played a pvp before. It's not going to be easy for me no matter what level I'm at. That's why I spent so much time getting my character where it is. I DO have a tse black powder pistol I got off killing the queen. I rarely use it because I am melee build and it takes forever to reload. Everyone doesn't stay at scratch by the way. You will be to uneven in less than 48 hours when you have to work or pass out and others will nolife on, work meticulously in teams, or just plain get luckier drops than you. We should get separated by level. The ones that made pvp characters this whole time should get to play with each other and you guys that screwed your first build can go run through the forest again in your party hats. 
---
My entire friend group of about 8 people have wanted nothing but PvP servers since day one. Games like this are better when the danger exists of being wiped off the map by a rival clan of players. 
---
Great ideas!!!
---
You can also find Wise ones wandering the world. I saw one a couple weeks ago when I was fighting a Mirelurk Queen somewhere on the east edge of the bog, and another one just yesterday when I was scouting for a new camp site north of Watoga.
---
You make a good point, the game will eventually feel old to many players....
---
My questions to these players then:
---
What level are you currently?
---
How fast had you completed Overseer's quest? Or Free States? Enclave? BoS?
---
How many locations discovered on your map, via exploration only?
---
If you're rushing the game to be l33t or whatever, you're doing yourself a disservice. The world is beautiful, and the places have stories, funny situations, sad endings and overall a very strong feeling of effort put into almost all of them. Slow down a bit, read the terminals, and soak it up. 
---
You're playing games to escape reality, might as well do it right!
---
They need to fix it where someone can't use 50 duplicate bobbleheads that keep their hit points at 9000 and make them a GOD! 
---
That'll happen in less than a month even with forced new characters, but if your character is locked to this mode you won't have the option of leveling and gearing them outside of perpetual PvP.
---
That’s where I was going win this. Hey we’ve already got verdant seasons, right? :)
---
You’re still under the assumption that things will work as intended by then (no duping). But, if the last 3 months are any indication, that’s a fucking pipe dream lol.
---
Unblock? Thats not the issue... Or explain
---
Your missing the point ... you earned all these things in a non stressful “adventure” environment. Things might be a little different this go around with everyone on even playing field. How is this a “survival mode” if we can bring all the fancy toys from our safe game mode over?
---
I said "if you dont mind my asking", id hardly call that an interrogation. If you mind, dont answer....
---
No defo not!
---
Some guy got a ban / suspension for bulking 300 steel to quickly. His thread is still active here somewhere from today. Hes going to keep updating it as his appeal is active etc. 
---
So no it doesn't have to be duping, it can be the server duping by itself because we spam a function in game to quickly for the server to handle!
---
He seems genuine and hes never lief to me, where as Bethesda have so it will be interesting to see if he gets un banned or not!
---
Ditto. Dogs. Dogmeat.  My best friend. He was good at killing mole rats etc. I miss him, even if he did block door-ways.  German Shepherds make the bestest hero companions. I'm never without one IRL.
---
I’d like to see the teleportation fast travel ability removed, but I’d still like the ability to speed up travel to exist outside the realm of teleports. 
---
Something like making those cars or motorbikes we see around the wasteland  become salvageable would be great. Maybe have a fixed spawn limit of them on server so they are rare over common so it motivates players to engage and steal, destroy the mobility device. Make it a thing where the player is required to go loot wheels, oil, fuel, spark plugs etc to get the item operational and then make them noisy as hell so players know when one is put together and in use. 
---
&gt;Bizarrely he was only level one (!) and had only mothman eggs or something like that and junk.
---
that was one of the non-hostile "Wise" mothmen with purple eyes. It's the Vengeful and Stalking versions you need to watch out for.
---
I’m not the person you asked, but I would like to try out the new PvP mode and just don’t have the time to sink dozens of hours into a side character in order to stand a fighting chance. I also understand the concern about OP characters ruining the new mode. I’m not sure there is an easy solution. 
---
It's also the ONLY one that you can play co-op with your friends. 
---
I don't understand why, since they're doing a separate PVP server anyway, they didn't just bite the bullet and do what everyone else wanted: a PVE-only server. 
---
It's ridiculous.
---
Stash them away and only carry around 20 at a time
---
100% 
---
Agree
---
Yea that’s my last resort, don’t seem to get fair value from vendors.
---
145 and still too small of a budget 
---
I posted this in another thread but I will repeat it here... Bethesda- Please put a tab on the main menu for game information and tutorials and in it have clear information on perk cards, crafting trees, and game etiquette for new (and experienced players).. Just looking at the forums there is no reason that everyone should have to learn by trial and error and rely on communities like this (complete with a fair amount of misinformation) to learn how to play the game.  This would really help out both new players and those that are new to multiplayer, and make the game much more enjoyable for all. 
---
Agreed. I am there. Fun friends keep me logging in but i do nothing but farm ammo, kill queen, farm ammo, kill,queen. Not seen an upgrade in like forever, not that i need it but would be fun with some alternatives at least. Trading works since caps are easy but boring.
---
Get the occational serum receipt or new plan but thats about it. I might take a break, i play less already. But the again I might not 😂.
---
See you later the mate!
---
Maybe you want the option of using a launcher sometimes. Maybe you want to keep that extra special one 5hat 2as a reward. What's the point of special rewards that you turn I to 200 caps? Just make it caps then. 
---
Maybe you dont want to have to specialize to such a hardcore degree where you are literally forced to throw away all other options. 
---
What's the point of a favorites wheel when you can only carry 1 or 2 weapons? 
---
You know what? The limit might be fine if your shit didnt break all the time. If you didnt have to horde materials or backups then it could work. This is hot garbage as it stands now.  
---
Ugh
---
I've gotten frustrated with the post-apocalyptic survival hoarding simulator. It has its fun points, but i am tired of playing weight management shuffle between player inventory and stash, as well as asswipes shooting up a camp for basically no reason.
---
I've met some cool people but I'm seeing where ESO is releasing an Elsweyr dlc and honestly, my main on ESO has very very healthy bank and char inventory space.
---
Seriously, its not that i think fo76 is bad, its just that it feels like I'm playing fo4 again, in a slightly different setting, with people that are 75% cool and 25% assholes. And when none of your friends or family are playing it, well... the 25% stick with you.
---
See you all online, but probably not for much longer.
---
Eso was 3 or 4 years old when i finally tried it for first time, maybe fallout76 will be a great deal better in a few years. 
---
I tend to switch games anyway every year or two unless there's something terribly compelling about the gameplay.
---
No offense but someone's gotta say it. Between the bugs and dumb design choices I can't believe a studio as big as Bethesda puts out games like this.
---
They're not real good in a fight but it would be nice to have a CAMP kitty.
---
thanks for posting the vid! im gonna hunt get to hunting the eggs
---
That big tree tht pulled the town building and bolder up into the sky allways has multiple ones. (Cant remember its name)
---
Don't think so. I tried. 
---
It reminds me of this one location in fallout 4 where a robot has you sit down and when it starts listing the options it says something like the course is you or whatever and starts attacking you
---
Whoa... you're stepping into NPC storyline choces matter territory. This is the last thing Fallout fans want in a Fallout game. 
---
More pvp modes, please.
---
Yes
---
Lieutenant Dan you ain't got no legs
---
There should be dedicated characters for this mode. Everyone starts at 1 and no switching back and forth.
---
Stealing someone's caps when you kill them is fine. It should scale with how many you have though so you can't just farm lowbies. 
---
Camping vault 76 won't be an issue if you can also spawn at your camp. As long as we don't see other players on the map so they can see where our camps are.
---
Nuke zones will be nightmares if we do full damage to each other too. 
---
As long as everyone starts fresh and on an even playing field it could be fun.
---
I already did. Logged in last night and bulked over 300 items in about 30 seconds. I'm fine.
---
They said they did remove any new tse match drops.
---
The engines holding them back but overall I like the design direction they're taking... They really need to update their software though... Phase out the code and remnants of the retro rpg junk and expand and refine on the modern rpg elements like base building and challenging, well crafted rng encounters and stuff that adds replay value. 
---
Scripted rambling npcs are terrible for replay value.. Good riddance to those dorky garbage piles imo. 
---
I don't. I really feel like I should have to go around and rediscover all my plans and acquire my weapon/armor set (and its not even that great) cause of some others behavior. Makes no bloody sense. 
---
That and you don't need a TSE to one shot/hit the ghouls at Whitesprings. I run a puny stealth rifle and can easily one shot them with a non-legendary Lever Action or a single swipe with my ski sword. If I see more than 2-3 people at Whitesprings I go some where else. 
---
Lol ok
---
Just use high strength, barbarian, and ironclad
---
You do realize this is a joke, right?
---
No one needs to say it. You don't like the game go somewhere else. Pretty simple concept
---
Yup. Wolves want to eat sheep, not fight other wolves.
---
This actually would work I think 
---
With games like these which are meant to kill time i have some games i call cooldown games, basically they keep me from burning out on whatever game im interested in. they arent too long but not too short so it works at least for me
---
He said yes? :D Can't wait to see what your kids will be like.
---
2 months after release of the mode it'll be the same problem. New players are going to get destroyed. There needs to be a better permanent solution. 
---
Well I killed 9 of the 10 ghouls, so I know I hit them. It happened 3 times in 2 weeks. I have never seen 9 ghouls or any creature not drop at least a weapon, aid, ammo, ect. I seem to only have this issue in nuke zones.
---
Are you finding the mags in the world? Buying them won't work you have to pick them up.
---
Lol ok indeed
---
If you see someone with a bounty that high, it's almost guaranteed they have no caps on them, and have a bunch of friends nearby who are waiting for people to attack so they can kill them. 
---
^This point exactly. All the playtime so far since launch being thrown away? Progression is better than regression. Some stuff needs done for sure, like duping needs fixed, PvP needs balanced, and duped weapons need wiped to stable levels.
---
I understand all the progress since launch is not 100% thrown away, it's more of a metaphor. It's hard to restart a new character after heavy playtime, and in a few months time the PvP servers will be overly saturated with OP players and duped items. Now, a suggestion for servers and fairness: level 1-50 servers, level 51-100, and level 101-infinite. Even throw in skill based server joining. Just an idea so noobs aren't harassed, and high levels get the bloodshed they want.
---
5k
---
Even regular serious character builds are far too strong damage-wise and far too squishy to that end, anyone not using an automatic firearm or semi-auto pistol is likely to one-shot whatever they hit, and everyone has a half-decent aimbot to boot, nevermind VATS builds.
---
PvP in 76 needs the biggest facelift of any PvP gameplay in any game I've ever seen. I've been saying it for a while: my suggested fix to PvP combat itself is to calculate everyone's damage normally when fighting PvE, but when against another player reduce damage done by 50% after calculating everything else. Really it's anybody's guess what would fix it tbh, such a mess.
---
So, basically Bethesda screwed the pooch AGAIN? Why is anyone surprised?🤦‍♂️
---
Cryolators are actually incredibly useful for fighting cancer bats. Put a clip or two into them and they'll literally freeze in mid air so you can line up a few shots without dealing with the bullshit screeching attacks.
---
Lmao
---
workshops and vendors are a safe bet to get them but i get the majority of mine off of workshops and events i stumble upon
---
F.
---
Exactly, OP. I was thinking of at the very minimum being able to craft your own vendor bot with a Charisma perk card pre requisite. And any sales your bot makes, goes back to your stash to be collected next time you're at camp. That way it can be saved and you won't have to worry about losing out on your sales.
---
OK, so now that they're admitting that they're going to let people pick a server... where the fuck is the PVE/RP server? 
---
Ahhahahah +1 Mohammed.
---
Survival mode? Isn't the whole game basically survival already?
---
&gt;The very fact that anyone here thinks a start from scratch server is going to be a level playing field *in just a matter of hours*...
---
Now THAT is some grade A ridiculous hyperbole if I've ever seen it.
---
A few days? Getting there.
---
A couple weeks? I'm with you now.
---
A few hours? Lol.
---
Yea, I see your point and it changed my mind.   I’ll be someone that doesn’t venture into Survival PVP.  But, as a counter point, if Survival exists for PVP why not decrease or remove it for folks that want more of a PVE experience?  If I’m flagged pacifist let me take no splash damage and no camp griefing.   If I turn it on for some fun, then game on.  
---
I 100% agree that fast travel will ruin PvP for this. The number of times I have made a clean getaway, only to have someone teleport on top of me, get away again, have them teleport again... 
---
Nope,  they're the digital equivalent of game stop.  
---
That's fair enough.  They have said level scaling will still be there to give lower levels a fighting chance.  When I leveled an alt from 20-30 I was coming out on top is lvl 150 at times.
---
The fireproof perk and upcoming two shot explosive nerf will stop one shotting/ exploa7 spam.
---
What needs to be fixed is bobblehead stacking and duped stim spamming.  One guy had a genius idea of a cool down timer when using a stimpack.  Would certainly get people to play more tactically.
---
something really cool that they can do is that you keep all your learned plans and such but not any items 
---
Dupers is THE reason.   People like you would just be unfortunate collateral damage. 
---
See the thing is, I'd be totally fine starting fresh had this mode been a revamp in difficulty along with new features.
---
It's not.
---
It's basically the normal game mode geared more towards PvP. I already built my normal game mode character around PvP and if the new mode isn't doing anything too different in terms of rebalancing, I'd very much like to carry over my character I've already worked on.
---
Although, I do see the problem with possibility of duped items coming over. Despite this, I've been doing nothing but PvP and I'm actually surprised how few players were abusing the bobblehead exploit(I've actually run into none). TSE is already inconsequential with a good build.
---
Make some Cranberry Relish for the low levels. Give away some low level legendaries and PA. Mod some heavy armor with 200% durability and mod and craft or repair a weapon with Weapon Artisan for them. Give them some mutation serum. It's cool just doing something nice for the low levels.
---
Rename it to hard-core and the stated functionality is fine 
---
Explore around Mt. Blair. There’s always squillions around there
---
Survival mode should mean legendary effects on all items do not apply in PVP. The ability to 1 shot another player makes PVP dead on arrival. If I wanted true survival PVP I would just go back to Rust! 
---
What Rust does great that could carry over into fallout:
---
Actual benefits to destroying another player’s base
---
Real base durability so you can’t just 1-shot structures with a shotgun
---
Balanced PVP 
---
SEASONS! This keeps the PVP interesting for all players, new and old.
---
Porting over already established characters and allowing players to play in both modes is a HUGE MISTAKE! You should have to pick upon creation and that decision should be final.
---
I like the prospect of PVP, but to roll out a crap product will only hurt the game more, not help it. I’d rather see Fallout’s resources used to fix the BETA of a game you already released. 
---
Thanks
---
I am disappointed that the clothes aren't the same. /s
---
It needs a suppressor badly.
---
Does it seem like it takes up a lot of AP per shot? Maybe it's just the high firerate making it seem that way.
---
I didn't see any mention of permadeath, though that would be a ballsy move LOL :)  
---
As an aside it's neither here nor there but TSE will be old news soon with the upcoming nerfs I suspect bloodied/instigating/executioners/anti armor and possibly a few other effects to be the new meta.  TSE will still be a decent combo but it won't be uncontested god tier with no rival.
---
At the very least, maybe even a craftable vendor bot to have at your camp. Selling what you tell it to for the prices you say, and having all caps from sales deposited into your stash for retrieval at next stash visit.
---
Yes, the upcoming TSE nerf will help. If anything, it'll give people an opportunity to at least get to some cover. I had forgotten about bobblehead, stacking/duping. Was in an infinite stack of bobbleheads? 
---
how much healing items do you drop on death? I have hundreds of stimpacks on me and don't want to lose that
---
Helping others is my current content until we get some end game content. Can't get much stronger and prepped several specs for vault dungeons. Our clan group is decked to the nines to overcome their challenges.
---
I do reccomend people consider doing this if your bored. It is really fun and you make alot of mates in game.
---
But also no harm in taking breaks from online service type games as well. Content will build up over long periods of time. So i have a few games that i am waiting for the content drip to finish up abit more. While i have filler games as well these ones are good to replay as well.
---
Just noticed, Why the hell does this post get downvoted? this sub is so toxic. 
---
I agree with everything that you said here, at least the parts that I have encountered myself, which is most of what you have already talked about. I, too, am trying to run a Stealth character. It's the way I've played many of the Fallout games, even one before Bethesda took over. The fact of the matter is, in 76, sometimes stealth is broken, sometimes it's not. It shouldn't be broken ever! FIX YOUR GAME, BETHESDA! 
---
It's bad enough to hear people bad mouth this game for silly reasons, like a lack of NPCs, or missing dialog options (both are not the end of the world, game ruiners as some have suggested), but to have put out such sloppiness, and to have still not fixed it, is inexcusable. Funny, I don't hear anything going wrong ever with the Atom Shop.... Have you made enough money to fix this game yet? 
---
I like the game, but the amount of bugs and poor design choices and lack of transparency really highlight just how far this company has fallen.
---
Not if you’re strong 
---
 That is a legit concern.  
---
I found probably 100 before they patched the drop rate, I'm burning through the ones with less than 70 percent, and still have probably 50 over 70 percent. 
---
How do you foresee modding working for more complex server based mods (assuming Bethesda releases a creation kit)? 
---
Do you think it will work like minecraft modding, where both the server AND client have to be running the same mod? 
---
I can't recall any other online games I've played with complex (custom scripting, models, texture)  server and client side modding, so I'm interested in how it might work. LMK if you have any ideas.
---
The gun play sure is dated and clunky.  Would be great to have other elements factor in when PvPing.  Like battles using tactical positioning, perk swapping, chem taking as a focal point.  Basically both parties being alive long enough to counter eachothers play.  
---
Yeah, Bethesda. Please listen to this guy! :)

Okay, so your job is as a coder, designer, developer, system administrator, and network architectural engineer?  Have you coded a game designed to have a large pesistant world with hundreds of AI algorithms going at the same time, ontop of connecting with upto 24 clients via the internet at the same time with one central server location?
---
The glitches with 'clicking so fast' only work due to server lag.  If you actually worked in the industry you'd know that server lag does happen, and unlike Blizzard who's had 15 years to get their server situations going and oodles of money constantly pumped into the development/security teams for their mmo....
---
tl:dr; If your going to make that 'teach me my job' bit, maybe actually know something or provide proof of it, and if your going to claim it's similar don't give vague 'my users devices' and mention a UI without an example of the UI.  Additionally; do your users actively look/try to break your software?  Do they try to use it as a way to make money by breaking it and actually causing instability in your servers as the means of breaking it?
---
But we would have to re level and the duper’s will still dupe as Beth can’t get a handle on it.
---
I apologize, I worded my comment poorly, if you read my previous comment I acknowledge that it does in fact apply to those two, but what I meant was that the AGL was coded to be a normal heavy weapon and not an explosive heavy weapon. To fix the damage perks they just removed it as a heavy weapon altogether. Now nothing but demolitions applies to it.
---
I use games like fallout as distractions while watching movies or shows I'm interested in but not fully vested in.  So maybe if i log in I will do this and find some random lowbies and see if they need anything I have so many mats and all the crafting perks so I could deck them out pretty good.  Plus would eventually give me a reason to go farm again.
---
Watoga train station and shopping center mostly. Also workshops are good as well as the random events.
---
Look dude all I'm saying is that not all of us want to port our characters over to survival mode just to grief with our TSE shotguns and duped 1000s of bobbleheads. There's legitimate reasons to not want to start a new character that'll take months to get back to where you are now in adventure mode. Chill
---
This happened to me too. My friend and I looked at the map someone had posted here that said what levels the different regions are. We were both 25 so we thought we'd be safe. We also ran into 40+ level on the ghouls. I couldnt run, I had recently picked up a missle launcher so i used all the missles and dropped the launcher and ran.
---
Weapons &amp; armour should occupy 1 spot of the stash instead of its weight. Problem solved. You can store a lot of junk/aid items but actually have some weapons and armour in there. Currently have no weapons and armour in my stash. Before everyone starts saying I'm storing too much junk, I don't want to spend hours searching for shit when I need to repair stuff or build. Just makes my life easier to store more of it. I don't find searching for hours "fun".
---
Do they not?  I thought Hunter's and Zealot's did.
---
Not just no fast travel but there needs to be something done with regards to exploiting similar mechanics, most notably fast travel to a team mate and disconnecting from a server to avoid combat.
---
In both instances, I think there should be a fast travel delay so you can't just cheese your way out of an encounter. Similar to the recall timer in League of Legends where it takes a number of second to fast travel and within that time you're exposed to fire that can break your ability to fast travel.
---
I like this idea I will start doing this during times that I do log in and there isnt an active quest or nuke zone worth hitting.
---
I do hope they intend to go that way but i could also see them going the select way aka FO4 creation club.
---
I hope they go the proper way minecraft style over the creation club way.
---
Their secret plan is to release new content once every 76 months.
---
Last night my lvl 39 spent 2 careful hours going to launch my first nuke solo. I had just finished repairing all the servers when a 14x walks in behind me, one shots every enemy in the final room while I went to repair the 4 weapons I brought in with me, 3 of which were completely broken. By the time I got there he had 5/5 robots up and launched yet another nuke on whitesprings. Anticlimactic af.
---
Get a dense chest mod for armor, like combat armor. That helps a lot with their sonic attack, which is explosive damage, so Fireproof will also reduce it. Basically 0 damage. I've seen some videos of someone with a VATS build killing them very fast when they land. I use a 2h and can kill them pretty fast when they land also. But while they are flying even my most powerful weapons take ages to kill them.
---
There aren’t any legendaries that effect it outside of say two shot or explosive or something that effects everything. 
---
because you did not earn it in survival mode, which is the entire point of survival mode in a multiplayer game.
---
Being watched until I use said BB gun. 
---
I get that but just because I like PVP doesn't make me dumb.  The mechanics aren't as polished as other games but I'm hoping over time more player PvP data will help refine the combat system.
---
I loved the PvE in the previous games, obviously.  What most fans wanted was coop fallout 4.  That's not what we got.  This is multiplayer fallout 4.  
---
It's more fun than most consider and it just such a good thing to do. Something that always sticks with me is we grew up in the vault together for 20 years. We are suppose to be rebuilding America as a team. So it makes sense we would share our wealth and help one another.
---
Problem with cars and other faster modes of transport is cell rendering needs to be as fast as you can travel through it.
---
I like the idea. I just don't know if it's technically feasible.
---
Downvoted but I completely agree, start again wit duper’s fucking shit up two days later, no thanks.
---
I played F4 survival too and loved it.  To me the key there was to set up settlements to use as way points to sleep (save) and rearm/change gear ect.  Using settlements I would then figure out what I needed to get to where I wanted to go and travel from settlements to settlement towards my objective.  
---
With the larger map it would be nice to use the train stations for the only fast travel.  This could be done by looking at the map at the train stations and using the pins to select another station.  Having the interior being “safe” would stop camping.  I’m not sure if fast traveling to your base from anywhere should be included.  If it does it would still mean hiking to the local train station if you wanted to get across the map faster.  
---
Added bonus, heading to the train station would increase the likelihood of running into someone and sitting there thinking how fast can I sprint across the open knowing the guy I killed is probably looking for me.   Also would make a safe place to trade. 
---
So I should use a melee to kill them?
---
Its possible.  Expect to be constantly bombarded with a sonic shriek attack that screws up your vision and renders cover pointless.  Unless youre packing 2shot or explosive ballistic guns, be prepared to go through a lot of ammo in the fight.  If you can, start the fight near an anti-air turret.
---
&gt;  Including the option doesn't hurt anyone!
---
Except for Bethesdas wallets and server resources.
---
Wait, but, if this is what you’re asking for, then according to your argument it’s not what you need... is this post a paradox?
---
Oh I see what you're saying.  They have some odd choices in their menus.  Like you start the game and then have to hit a button to go to the menu.  Why not just go there?  Does anyone start the game and then not want to play?  And to get to the menu in game you have to hit the map button and then another button.  Strange.
---
 No.  PVP is pretty avoidable so them being stronger than me has not ben an issue  I would uninstall and not come back for a long while.  I am not anywhere near ready to want to redo the early grind.
---
I keep "oh would you look at that" into my plans
---
I do this in games like Warframe and Monster Hunter although in those games its more mentoring than giving items but those games the knowledges is more valuable.
---
This.  If i could sell everything i get during a play session it would make a huge difference.
---
Yea, I care not for pvp. Looks like it's back to red dead single player again.
---
I dont read  Inside the Vault  because i dont like being condescended to. They need to fire whoever does their PR/social media stuff.
---
Soon
---
&gt;bone duders
---
Totally though that said *boner dudes*
---
Id say 50 caps for the cores.  Ammo prices vary.  I wouldnt sell 5mm and mini-nukes for the same price.
---
Personally, I'm waiting for private servers so that I can make exactly the world you're describing. I would propose that I'm okay with legendary weapons existing - on the condition that when the person dies, they drop them. I want legendary weapons to be something that exists, but that people don't use because they're afraid of risking the good guns in a fight. Ultima Online was full loot, and had a lot of this - the most popular weapons weren't the best weapons - they were the best weapons that could be efficiently collected or crafted. And if you happened to find someone parading around their super fancy bardiche, maybe they're going to have a bad day and you're going to have something shiny to sell the next morning.
---
Right! Go play rdr2 where every weapon is a one shot kill if you headshot.
---
The reason why is I want to see why they are prioritizing it over the social features that I've seen requested here on the subredit for the game, like better player vending, a trade hub, improvements to the social systems in the game, etc.  Sure a shiny thing to bring in new players is nice, but building a healthy community within the game it's self is much, much more vital to a game of this nature.
---
That's why WoW has been so successful for 15 years now.  Not constant new content, but the sense of community in the game.
---
Someone who got this game at Christmas and is hundreds of hours behind clearly hasn't put in the same amount of time lol. Starting late is a different story of course because the time allowed to be put in is different, but eventually a point is reached where putting in more time doesn't have as much of an effect and those behind will catch up. Rocket League is a good example of this. Those who played the original game had a huge advantage and were the first "pro" players of the game but not even 8 months later those who started with the newer game were getting just as good as the original pros. It's the basic laws of "whatever you want to call it" that nothing can be gained without time and/or effort. Skill is gained through time and effort, knowledge is gained through time and effort, hell even lunch is gained through time and effort lol. Since everything takes time and effort, everything can be obtained through time and effort. Saying otherwise is just an excuse for someones lack of putting in the time and effort because it can't possibly be there fault. In League of Legends terms, thats blame the jungler syndrome.
---
I find it funny they spent the effort to even put half the weapons in the game when so many just aren't effective or viable.
---
youre right im really flying off the handle lol. Why do you think im asking? Im trying to understand the other view point, what is your issue with that. I think I asked in a pretty nice way, and if you read where someone did reply, we had a civil back and forth about it. He shared his reasons, I shared mine. I think you may need to take your own advice and not jump down peoples throat for no reason. 
---
Yes people were stacking explosive bobbleheads which can turn up a weapons dmg into the thousands if not millions.
---
Combine with 2SE, being hit will instantly destroy a power armor piece.  Making it a costly battle.  I'm too hoping the nerf will prolong battles when in PvP.  At the moment whoever shoots first loses or who has the 2SE with 10k damage.  
---
I like this idea. I would like to try the new mode, but just don’t have the time to put into a new character to re-level. Being able to hop and only have to scrounge for fear would be awesome. 
---
What is your discord doe
---
In this new survival mode will the rare Jumpsuit event rewards have an increased drop rate to compensate the harder efforts of the player ? 
---
Yeah, something something, banal bullshit, blah blah blah.  
---
It depends on how you build your character. What kind of weapons you want to specialize in etc. Also you might need to have some pretty good defense perks to go toe to  toe with them in melee. I don't know I'm pretty high level now and they were a pain in the butt for me for a while also until I got a little stronger, better defenses, better items etc. The VATS video I saw the guy didn't even have a legendary weapon and killed them in like 4 shots. It seemed even easier than me with my 2h.
---
Ok that's cool.
---
There's my view point. 
---
Well maybe you should stop drilling your point across, you have made yourself clear(after 600 posts on the subject)...give it a rest, not everyone is going to agree.
---
True Survival Mode = Everything drops on death, you stash box can also be looted if somebody finds it, and if you die, you lose levels. What's proposed sounds like another half-measure compromise to try and please multiple playstyles.
---
But I agree characters should have to start over, because there are too many god-mode dupers with TSE to make PvP worth the risk. The new Survival Mode world should have no legendaries at all.
---
You're talking about 2 or 3 out of all the heavy ballistic guns being decent. And all energy weapons are still pretty much useless.
---
Honestly, I'm still looking for early and mid game content, nm endgame. 
---
Not interested in the new mode if they don’t wipe all chars and their duped explosive weapons. Besides, what good is a new mode when pvp is still unbalanced as shit. 
---
Thank you for the info. I ended up buying them for 50 caps :) I gave him 1000 5mm ammo though. I had 3k and rarely use it
---
TL;DR - Bethesda, you're doing it all wrong. Don't listen to us and give us what we ask for. Understand what we really want/need. Here is a list of where you've gotten it wrong (apparently).
---
Honestly, they're always replying to things
---
First one I scrapped unlocked Drum mag, I almost fell out my couch.
---
Except this panic is for the love of pvp- people want authentic hardcore servers, not people transfering back and forth between the two servers.
---
As a solo player, totally excited to get killed while I'm at a vendor and didn't see the other guy at all.
---
Or halfway through working on a quest in the Mire and get killed and have to respawn at my camp or 76, and travel all the way back.
---
Shit sorry, just saw this. 
---
Doesn’t matter either way, I’m on Xbox.
---
100% because they can't because most would!   
---
LMAO!!!
---
I can't bring my self to make another character. I just wish more end game content existed. (150+ atm) 
---
I played ESO Beta and it was barely even a game at that point.  Then I came back to it last year - WOW.  It's really cool, but, you have to either pay $15 a month to play it, or, suffer EVEN WORSE inventory tedium than you do in FO76.  I don't want to play $15 per month, maybe $10 would have been OK?
---
But, I totally agree there needs to be some way to avoid assholes just randomly shooting up your base and fights with Min/Max Douchebags that one shot kill basically anybody if they hit first.
---
The need to take away the insane damage multipliers that result in max damages in the THOUSANDS.  The ONLY hits that should be one shot kills should be 1) Nuke, 2) Sniper Headshot (require it to be stealthed also, if u think it should be) and 3) Melee ***SNEAK*** attack - like, if you attack from behind, you can just cut the enemy's throat, or, stab through the heart...
---
Basically ***ALL*** the other one hit kills are ***BULLSHIT***
---
I just want pvp without duped items. My experience has been that I see a TSE every time I play and that's just what I've notices. People duped much more than just TSE, such as armor, chems, and bobbles. Lots of people know about the duping seeing that there are how-to videos with 100k+ views. 
---
WTAF - is that true?
---
Here we go again.
---
I've had SBQ not leave me loot 3 times in one day. Shit happens.  
---
Lmao survival mode is gonna be fucked for the first few weeks
---
I suppose just only a month away now.  Feb is a short month anyways.  Better though they have some time to outline the details.  The community is very wobbly about certain aspects atm.  
---
im at 466 hours and have had 2 TSE drop, one being a shotgun and had another explosive shotgun drop. you can pretend that they dont drop naturally but they had to drop for people to be able to be duped
---
you do have to catch up, not in terms of levels but getting legendary weapons and armor. even if you are level 50, it takes time to try to grind for unyielding armor+bloody weapons etc
---
and you cant level up running your own race in the survival server because other people can kill you on sight, which is why you should be able to do that on the adventure server and then transfer
---
PC. 
---
PC.
---
If you are at a vender train station and in a trade window?  Only place people will need to go is to venders. Sounds like the only way pvp is going to be any fun is on a team. 
---
It's just a disaster of an idea, the whole thing. 
---
 I should get to use my current character and play with others of my level. No one said this was sandbox mode and that we'd have to make new characters in the months leading up to it so I am confident the transfers will happen regardless of the subs current hissy fit.  Doing anything else is just hurting good players because of dupers or the fear of everyone having a duped weapon. There's going to be people with better weapons than you. If rules are really out the window, I keep my character. 
---
That was something to read but I can agree with a lot of it. Nerfing Two-Shot is my current bitching point (bite me if you disagree) when it doesn’t actually solve any issue but makes my actually decent weapon vastly inferior. They don’t fix issues but create new ones
---
There are many reasons why they can’t or wouldn’t do PvE only.  But a real simple example of how complicated that could be is ask “how would Workshops work?”
---
Don't try to go back to the right, once you've gone left far enough that it pops to 25,000 pull the left trigger to go left. It'll go in like quarters after for pools it will be at zero.
---
Roses are red
---
Violets are blue 
---
More stash space would help me and you!
---
You think there's enough room for a fusion genny down there?
---
Where at the pylon do plans usually spawn?
---
There are trophies for the game? That does actually seem like an at least somewhat consistent way to verify it. How many people have the simplest trophy though? Building a CAMP, leaving vault 76, whatever it might be
---
... Versing? 
---
Good idea. Time to send some messages
---
They need to make "min/max" tweaking *********FAR********** less effective than it is.  
---
It's broken bullshit currently.
---
&gt;How is this any different to people spending a bunch of time bringing across their items, duped, bought duped or otherwise?
---
because you can level up in the safety of adventure mode where you wont be killed on sight at any grinding areas, effectively locking you out of whitesprings, wes-tek, watoga etc until you are strong enough
---
&gt;The only difference is if it's new characters only, then everyone theoretically starting on equal footing as they won't come in with the advantage of past duping methods.
---
did you read my post at all? everyone is on equal footing if they all start the same day, anyone starting late is going to have to try to catch up while getting murdered by stronger people
---
I’ve been doing stealth sniping mostly. Not sure how that would hold up
---
"and they'll PAY US to be part of the experiment! Muhahahhaaha"
---
Yeah all 7 of them 
---
I'm not sure either. The only head armor is power armor.
---
It's a discussion of the under lying Dynamics of the problem. 
---
We don't need more opportunities for pvp, we need PVP to be engaging.
---
We don't need more and different events, we need them to work and feel rewarding first.
---
We don't need a way to craft legendaries, we need less useless weapons. I've dumped a dozen God roll weapons from the useless weapon list because no amount of legendary effects will make them useful.
---
And yes, I know you're being cheeky.
---
That’s wild
---
Yea lol.
---
This isnt so much an issue of God tier weapons, but bobbleheads stacking. I seen a dude rolling around killing everything in one hit after consuming 100+ bobbleheads
---
Yeah, basically. Pvp ends way too quick. It would be a lot more fun to have a strategy, using the environment around you, combined with loadouts. 
---
There are other absurdly bullshit attacks doing ***THOUSANDS*** of damage - no way should somebody hitting you with a hammer (rocket powered or not) do even a fraction of the damage of a Mini Nuke.
---
They need to majorly clamp down on the damage multipliers and at the same time increase the BASE damage of something like a Sniper Rifle.
---
It really depends on your gear, whether your perks synergise well with your weapon and you're prepared with ammo and chems. Well I've found it's more that than your specific level. Power armour helps too.
---
I almost took down a SB at around level 40 solo but it flew away and reset its health before I could follow up and finish it off. That's the closest I've gotten with just ok gear. Hard hitting legendaries would help speed things up. 
---
Because we’re the best and the brightest and obviously don’t need to protect our heads? But seriously, lack of head protection is bonkers.
---
I edited my post.
---
You sound like a griefer who isn't happy about not being able to pick on low level players and wreck their camp.
---
I'm hopeful that they will have harsh penalties for griefers on the PvE servers.
---
I’m not saying I don’t know where your coming from, but that decision your making where just because YOU don’t want to play in a server that might have duped items (yes 100k views compared to the 100,0000 or so actual playerbase and just cause they saw the vid doesn’t mean they have TSE) but back to my main point just because YOU don’t want to play with people who have duped TSE and thus want everyone to start over isn’t just penalizing the dupers. It’s peanalizing people like us. Who have not duped but actually put in blood and sweat to make the best PvP raider for PvP but now have to start all over because YOU want everyone to?
---
I hope you see where I’m coming from. My main point I’m pretty sure their are people who casually play this game and thus want survival for everyone to start over because they don’t want to deal with TSE and they haven’t invested much so it doesn’t matter, but for those who have invested hours in end and have done nothing wrong and looking forward to this game mode are getting fucked over.
---
That’s why I’m saying in the beta see what happens and if it does seem TSE are everywhere of course make changes but at least give everyone a chance.
---
Ok I want a gun dam game now
---
I killed two level 50s together, tonight, at level 48. Was wearing PA and used a 50 cal MG. 
---
Complicated only if you're approaching the question from a competitive angle instead of a cooperative angle.  In co-op, the solution is very, very simple: everyone gets a share.  Their own, instanced share. 
---
It's not a new problem.  Take World of Warcraft:  Mining nodes, for example, are limited (but respawning) resources.  The first one to get it, gets it.  Then it's gone.  That led to competition over the resource, and a decent amount of friction. 
---
Along comes Guild Wars 2, and now every resource node is instanced to each individual player.  Everyone can see the same nodes, but when someone else mines it, you still get to see yours, and mine yours separately.   WoW actually ended up adopting this solution, and it works great. 
---
It's not hard to see Workshops as communal resource-collectors.  Some kind of upkeep to keep it running, perhaps, so that it's not 'cap once and done', but after that point, if you rock up, you can claim your personally-instanced share.   Just like the solution in WoW/GW2. 
---
Clearing inventory space for kingdom hearts 3, and resident evil 2 remake. 
---
Let me get this straight. You bought a game that has always been just single player PvE, for the PvP? Am I getting that right? 
---
If so, Mmmmmmk
---
It will *years* before there is any kind of pvp balance, assuming it happens at all.
---
It's answering the cries instead of changing the diaper for sure.
---
PC

s0m3th1ngw3ntwr0ng  
---
Not telling me what addictions I have isn't helping me, it's just enabling me. Is that what you want? If you really loved me you'd confront me about my addictions. Instead, you don't say anything. This is why I don't get better....it's all your fault.
---
It's rare though
---
Chemistry bench, best offer. 
---
One thing for sure if they're gonna make "Survival Mode" - they need to expand the map, like 4x bigger.  And no "fast travel".
---
Also, if you kill another player or enemy, you should be able to find on them whatever you saw them using, not just some random junk/"scrap" or completely unrelated and usless pieces of Wooden Armor, +15 vs Bugs....
---
There are bugs that need to be fixed first, than they need to improve on everything that does not work as intended, than they can add new features, quest and stuff and only than can they focus on anything new. People will only play the new mod when they get really bored by the vanilla game and have everything maxed anyway.

&gt; more
---
What is it? Some grass? Why am I looking at this?
---
   
---
Bethesda, you should try to get the good details of the games and not put the bad details of your own game. 
---
Idk, have them working like they did in NV would be fine. A small section in the pippy that said 
---
#Challenges:
---
**Imperialist** - Build items in your camp (42/76)
---
You must have a bad memory, conan exiles was a hot piece of shit on release and it took them years to get it in any working condition to have a steady player base. Rust had to literally be rebuilt from the ground up.
---
That’s true for some. I think 75% of the time I go to Watoga high, monster mash starts within 5 min. 
---
Pretty much. If someone has a rash, then anti-itch cream isn't gonna make it go away.
---
I guess it seems like someone is taking it, It only happens in nuked zones after someone is over the bodies. Oh well, it is just annoying 
---
Yesssss. That was a great system! 
---
Only issue I had with D3s seasons is that they'd mail you your stuff at the end of season. So if you went on a long hiatus mid-season, it can expire on you.    If they just skipped that, and moved the character over to normal mode once the season is done, that'd work great.
---
I wish the players would go out and become professional game developers, so they could just realize how much work changing one little thing can be.
---
Nah just sounds like a jaded PVEer letting all the posts of ppl optisically assuming greifers will go to the new mode get him down
---
Because the economy will be fresh and untainted unlike the regular game
---
Hi
---
I'd like to see more real world guns. I believe there was a desert eagle in Fallout 1? Stuff like that.
---
I totally agree too. I've noticed that other players are defensive when you walk up to them because of this. I have to wave at them to stop them running away if they have no mic on. This is making an isolating game more isolating. 
---
Yea like nobody going to nuke your town the moment they see it on the map
---
That was a lot of unnecessary words around the point of
---
&gt;Starting late is a different story of course...
---
Which can be alleviated by doing what is suggested here.
---
I think it's up in the space station area, north-middle part of map...
---
Exactly.  Also they have to be careful on what they reply to as requests could be brigaded and people would start demanding unrealistic features.
---
At least they aren't as inept as some gaming companies who do not listen to feedback.  Plus they have to sift through a lot of crap to pass the right details on to the development team.
---
Not even a Commando build. I use one as a backup weapon and to kill low level enemies. It’s unusually durable in this role, I don’t think I’ve repaired it once. Same mods you suggest except I go with the armor piercing just cause I like maximizing damage, and the default reload is good enough. Though, I am tempted now to give Quick mags a try.
---
Listen this mode is perfect. Why are you bitching? Its not being forced on you. You dont have to play it. Its for players like me that are competitive and want more challange and higher risk reward ratios. This is for players that want that extra sense of is someone that can actually kill me watching me. Cause this game is to easy. This is the mode I've been begging Bethesda sinse release. Just cause you dont like it and arnt cool with change doesnt mean it wont be good. The leaderboard is for more competativeness and to give some players the desire to kill kill and kill more. I personally asked Bethesda to make us loose more upon death cause im not afraid to die if when I do cause all i loose is shity junk that i have no room for in my stash anyways. Let me tell you something. You can bitch all you want but no one cares but those who suck pacifiers as yourself. And Bethesda doesnt care about all the babies that keep crying cause they dont get there way. Listen stay on adventure servers and quit bitching. Nothing is being forced on you. Im so sick of hearing people bitch at this game and Bethesda. Like seriously why bitch if you arnt going to play PvP.
---
Not sure how to add you on discord to chat. 
---
I dont understand why people have such a problem with this. 
---
Even if they disallow using chars from 'adventure', what happens during week 2 when folks have a lvl 70 survival char that they started from 0? Are you going to insist that they wipe chars each week or month or similar? 
---
Thw whole point is that the wasteland is fucking deadly!! 
---
You still need to have enough crap to sell for on our alts. As you can log only character at the time, you can't give the crap from your main to your alts, unless you have a friend to help you...
---
for more precise location: East Toxic Valley, past the water park, massive space station crash 
---
talk about the wrong stuff...
---
Thank you for the response. We appreciate your time. The only thing I will add:
---
If this mode is to be competitive enough to have a leaderboard, it is also competitive enough not to allow cross character play. Everyone should start from the exact same position and progress on the leaderboard organically. 
---
So me and my crew show up, complete the takeover, defeat the waves.  Others just sit back wait for us to finish and check in when the ticks give free supplies to whoever shows up.
---
Conversely there is chance at something good when you take over the Workshop.  Go through the capture and defend Components.  So I hop on with team, capture all the Workshops like many have.  Now nobody gets the takeover rewards.
---
How long can you hold a Workshop?  It stops when you log off sure, but I got no life so I can put 8hrs in or just get a bot to do circles in a basement for days.
---
Yes these can be circumvented or bypassed but only by completely retooling how the Workshops work.  I personally think they need a full overhaul but that’s more complicated then what they are doing with this PvP stuff.
---
I'm 100% with you there, with the introduction of survival there really is no point to the pvp at all in adventure mode. Just make it pve mode Bethesda.
---
Who’s idea was it to have the first new content announcement be a PvP mode? Even if you release actual content before this mode drops, who thought announcing this FIRST was remotely positive for the image of the game..? We were finally hearing less about dupers and shit PvP, even less bullshit about how “bad the game is in general” .. people were finally starting to lose their hate boners for the game .. and then you guys drop this log filled with gasoline on the embers of that dying fire. 
---
A competent manager would have put the breaks on this weeks ago, maybe months. This content’s position on the roadmap should have been altered long before the plans were official for your dev team. The fact it was the FIRST new content announcement is baffling. I love fallout and I really enjoy this game, I’ll keep playing it and letting others know I enjoy it because I honestly do, and this announcement doesn’t change anything for me yet and won’t unless I go into the mode, but I can’t rationally defend this being the first new content announcement. Your fans who are still playing regularly are NOT still playing regularly because of the PvP. We want real new content and it’s almost glaringly obvious that announcing a half baked PvP mode as the “new content” would be taken very very poorly. I can’t wrap my head around it at all. 
---
The people that program game logic and the people that create content are not the same people and are not working on the same tasks at the same speed. New content is added almost weekly to the ATOM store- it may not be meaningful, useful, or wanted- but it is new and it is content.
---
I know, I was just making a joke :) You make a valid argument... sometimes, rather than just addressing player complaints on the surface level, it's important to look for a root cause and try to fix that instead. That being said, I'm also sure they've been in damage control for a while now, just trying to improve public opinion of the game and show that they're listening to the community. They've done a lot to convey that exact "we're listening" message, and I think that's a really good thing, especially since this game got a lot of bad rap as the game "nobody wanted" or existing because "Bethesda didn't listen". I would hope they do understand that the root causes need to be fixed here, but I also give them a lot of credit for trying to listen to what their players are saying and doing their best to patch those comments in quick, even if it is surface-level changes. 
---
Read the Manual dingus.
---
**Survival mode**\*\*:\*\* We don't need this mode. 
---
THANK YOU.

Found the video in my YouTube history.

---
No. Bob only greifs when his wife is mad. So it is really 6.5.
---
I stopped for a while on my first character because he was so op and could one shot kill anything but i took a break and now im enjoying a new character
---
I understand that not letting players with duped loot bring those characters over to survival, but just spare a thought for all the people who grinded for months to get where they are now, and who just can't play as much as others.
---
I'm only LVL 43 and I've played since launch. I want to play the new survival mode (the whole reason I got 76 was to PvP) cause I love those games (played the hell out of DayZ and 7 days to die), but if I have to start all over again I'll probably just stop playing.
---
There's a chunk of us who only have one character and just can't start again, due to school, or work, or whatever.
---
Oh I hear ya. They're gonna have to make Survival only characters among other changes for it to work.
---
To stop hair clipping out of it.
---
That's awesome!
---
Lol haha ignorant response as expected from a troll like yourself. Have a good one buddy.
---
Normally, the automatic receivers for any weapon actually cut down AP cost in VATS by 50% since VATS is now in real time, and each "shot" used by VATS only shoots a single round, compared to a 3-round burst in F04. 
---
The problem is the 10mm SMG is automatic from the get-go, but is categorized in-game as a rifle. Bethesda for whatever reason gave it the base high AP Cost of a non-auto rifle, but without an automatic receiver to cut down the cost. 
---
A good number of people likes to show their head. Therefore, Bethesda went this way not to have those players forced to wear something or be unoptimized.
---
Mssg cyco A
---
Gotta remember these companies don't work on 1 thing at a time. There are people working on a variety of things, and sometimes the things that are ready first, weren't necessarily the highest priority because some things are harder to get done than others.
---
&gt; No way they were selling that price legitimately.
---
You don't spend much time around the trading subs, clearly. Serum prices are dirt cheap now because lots of people have plans to craft them and they're no longer rare, and they're not hard to craft at all. 
---
Question 1:  Do you have adaptive sync (Freesync or Gsync)
---
Question 2:  What FPS are you getting on average
---
I want my sentry bot helmet to not only look sexy but to serve a purpose 
---
I really hate that everyone equates PvPing with "griefing" and "cancerous Rust players". Like Bethesda has given EVERY disadvantage to players who attack other players. Slap damage until other player fires back. Map blindness to wanted players. The inability to do anything but slap damage to bounty hunters coming to kill you until they fire first. It's as "carebear" as a survival game can get without completely disabling PvP. 
---
I can't wait for a survival mode so that there is even a *chance* that people cry even a percentage point less about "raider" roleplayers and griefers. You don't like someone attacking you? Great, Bethesda has given you about an infinite number of options, advantages and conditions so that people can do minimal damage "griefing". Jesus Christ. 
---
How do you get the plans to craft them? 
---
I hope the player-blocking doesn't hide the blocker, or else ppl would block most of the people in the server.
---
They spoke about losing Aid item, but losing Legendaries would be a bit too much, imo.
---
It's most likely gonna be that whoever has the biggest team wins. If all use Empath, it's just game over.
---
We might get Lone Wolf Survival, where you cannot form teams. I think that's really needed.
---
It's gonna be awesome, though. I can't wait to play Fo76 without PvP restrictions and have that tension of someone sniping you any moment. 
---
I use gsync and capped it @ 100fps. Playing on 1440p
---
As long as a mod doesn't need to change communication between client and server and doesn't display new graphics, it will most likely to only require a server side installation.
---
Oh, a hardcore mode would be AWESOME.  
---
Love this gun so hard , I will gladly join the cult of 10mm Smg 
---
Why should I have to make a new character and lose all my progress just because you deem it so? 
---
I agree they need to restrict fast travel. Maybe give it a cool down on top of restricting the distance you can fast travel
---
&gt;MOPP gear does not protect against initial nuclear radiation or the hazards of residual radiological contamination from induced gamma and fallout.
---
It offers some protection against radiation, if you bothered to read the rest of the FM. Hazmat suits work in a similar fashion. If you want to be critical, the current suit in game wouldn't work either. 
---
&gt;90% or more of players bought this game for the PvE
---
I stopped reading here.
---
That's false.
---
Simple as.
---
Another tip too to get them to land: a mob of scorched humans will spawn when in combat with the scorchbeast. Kill them all and it will land, making the battle generally easier especially if you choose to melee
---
maybe they are already implementing a fix then . idk 
---
Crazy
---
Yeah. I apologize for what I said.. Not going to lie I creeped on your profile and you seem like a decent person. There's so many toxic people here that would say "oh I don't have the game" then they would reply with "it's trash" this sub honestly had so many people just trash everyone in it when the game first came out so you have to be understanding of why they would be weary of people seeming like they are about to troll for liking the game. Stick around. The community really isn't toxic and these future updates are really going to determine everything. I'll edit the original comment. 
---
The bank of desks in the military wing of The Whitespring is a good place to get 3-5 regularly. 
---
I'm not in agreeance with this. I've put lots of hard earned time in with my current character without exploiting anything in the game. I would like to be able to play the new pvp mode without having to restart and make a new character. Bethesda please....
---
My friends and i experienced this as well
---
Same here. I want a completely PVE mode with an emphasis on cooperation. 
---
Their servers would do well to split into Easy (PvE), Normal (Current), and Hard (Survival).
---
No? It is a **PVP** server. If you are playing this mode and you do not initiate fights with other players regularly why even?
---
You dont loose progress. You get to keep your character. Just on adventure servers. PvP is new servers so new characters. Its not an old idea for for PvP games to have different game modes with seperate character progression
---
This is really, really well done! I love your ideas for PVP!
---
That makes sense. Although, I am reminded of other games that had a "show helm" checkbox so you could wear head armor and still show your face. 
---
When they first announced a pvp only mode I was hoping that it would be new characters only. 
---
Another option to draw people in is have seasons that run 3-4months with unique events that reward unique gear/items. 
---
Then when the season is over you can transfer to adventure servers. 
---
Once again the mark is barely hit...at least IMO. 
---
Definitely. It definitely needs to make player killers red on the map, and you don't go chaotic for killing a chaotic character. And you get a lot of negative karma for player killing, and you have to do something really tedious to get rid of negative karma. Lineage 2 had a great system. You drop items if you're chaotic. It's punishing if you decide to be a player killer. There should be a deterrent. But being a chaotic character is a viable choice of play style. It just means you're public enemy number 1.
---
Or a separate resource stash..... Or just give us player venders already
---
When I saw the headline I was thinking PvP mode will be like battleground , fortnite style once you die you lose all progression 
---
They're wasting resources making a survival hardcore mode, with a...... A fucking leader board? What coked up yes man decided on that? It's certainly going to delay more meaningful improvements. I feel like this is made evident by the anemic patch notes delivered today.
---
Why is the Power Armour so badly nerfed? I have noticed that the damage done to me by Liberators (little blue bastards) is exactly the same whether I'm wearing no armour or T-60 power armour. It's ridiculous that a couple of these can kill you in T-60 with a few strikes.  
---
Uh, idk, probably the same reason we can't ride bikes or cook with purified water.
---
&lt;Update&gt;
---
I reset the statistics on the iPhone, ran Fallout for 13 minutes and it took a measely 12mb. So roughly 60mb/hr which is totally cool.
---
I believe I must have missed resetting the statistics on cell use, but damn I clicked and all. Sorry for the false alarm.
---
I hope this takes care of the grieving problem. I just wish that there was an option to make it so that you can’t take damage from or do damage to other players or each other’s camps. A private server would be an ideal scenario, but something along those lines would be nice. I get tired of gathering all the materials to rebuild my camp because people love destroying it. Crossing my fingers that the new mode will at least partially alleviate this.
---
Awesome! Thanks 
---
Why not do both?
---
One survival server for all characters and another server for strictly survival characters?
---
That way both sides will get what they want.
---
You're nuts if you think the griefers are gonna be on that server. It's not going to be fun for them to fuck with people who are expecting it. 
---
Yes even this would be great
---
Well, firstly an economy cant exist in fo76, mass bartering of individuals is not an economy, we need shops, we have things to sell and to buy. An auction house that covered all servers simmilar to an mmo would be a good start for an economy. 24 people cant have a proper economy, hundreds can.
---
Griefers are going to grief on pve as long as they're able. 
---
Just image the twitch chat in every stream. "Fallout 76 is bad/dead/dumpster fire" "Can't wait for Outer World lol xD" 
---
Fuckin' Hubologists.
---
How can they even carry them.  I have to sell some in order to fast travel as they weigh one each. Hey, Bethesda - why don't you please remove the weight for bobble-heads?
---
Nope. If your game crashes or you DC you have to restart from the beginning, so if you leave the base at any point you have to start from the beginning. 
---
I would love for them to do what Waframe does 100%. Such an amazing lot and they really have set the bar very high for it.
---
Do the quests?
---
You get for free...
---
Oh wow a real life journalist thank you for your service that is so brave we really need more people like you to tell us what we shouldn't be allowed to talk about on the internet. 
---
god now Ill have to see everybody and their mother in a clown mask acting all tough n shit.
---
This is interesting to hear, especially for an explosive build... 
---
That is what I am expecting, unfortunately.
---
I bet you feel special calling someone you don't know a "dingus". If it didn't happen I wouldn't of posted it. If it only happened once, like the 1st time it happened or the second time it happened..it still happened if you believe me or not...I don't care.
---
Because the griefers and trolls, who are bored with the game, bitch and moan on reddit and insult those of us who are PVE. It sucks. 
---
Can we also please add how much longer the event has left until the end?  Nothing worse then jumping to an event with under a minute left and no chance to complete it.
---
lol
---
If modders can do this for free in fo4 why cant a paid team manage at least simmilar?
---
Everyone will tell you to hit up offices for the desk fans, globes and typewriters for screws. And while that's true I feel you're better off hitting up places with kids and families: amusement parks, bowling alleys, houses, cabins and motels and anywhere else where there's kids (or used to be anyway) like Bolton Greens. They are generally lousy with toys and the car and truck toys both have lead and screws and many of the other toys like jangles, buttercup, the alien, the rocketship and the alphabet blocks all have useful components like lead and plastic. Oh and while you're ransacking houses and hotels, look for the kitchen: Pepper mills and hot plates both have screws.
---
If they did that it would only allow 4 players max like 7 Days to Die
---
Agreed. Anthem and division 2 are what I'm looking forward to now.
---
Fo76 is my "revisit in 6 months game" it seems
---
I have the plans I’m just too lazy to find the materials to make it so I came to reddit
---
I wouldn't. Then again I don't nuke any thing I'm only LV 24
---
My apology got caught in the debate lol
---
Wandering Vendor Bot is easily triggerable &gt;1 per hour. I get him several times a day just doing quests near poseidon energy. Just walk over to the train station and check by the red barn. If someone has a camp there, he can't spawn there (can't say whether it blocks the other spawn): If he's not there, run NNE across the train bridge and check at the far end (I use vats as there is a pretty large area he can spawn in here). Then server hop. It's like a 10% chance at each spot.
---
I’m just salty your still having some fun with it. Haven’t touched 76 since release week. I got other bandwagons to ride 😘
---
Oh OK, did not know a new mode was implemented yet or about to be. 
---
You will start from the beginning. I'm surprised it was so difficult for you, it's not that hard. Did you forget your armor or something?
---
Great ideas. Although I'd be fine with just +100 physical/ele resist.
---
It’s fine. I was joking. I have the game but not much time to play. And when I do play games it’s usually paladin but only a game or two
---
Thats why its (Beta) boom Drops Mic
---
Except though how hard can it be to make a new mode? All they're doing is disabling some rules and adding a new button in the main menu. I can't imagine it would take that long to do.
---
"You guys are doing a great job" oh my god.. Hahhahahaha
---
Most likely this as long as they can grief those in pve mode they will. 
---
What we need is an option or server choice or have adventure rules tweaks to provide us a complete out when it comes to 76 wierd style of pvp.
---
I want the most ridiculous thing ever. I would like it if my bf and I only got kicked with the blue screen once every week instead of the 5 to 7 times a night we get now....oh and a puppy. I want a puppy. I miss Dogmeat and naming my cow moomeat just doesn't fill that vacumm.
---
Honestly, it's going to be a clusterfuck. I'm going to try to kill every player I run across and I'll be far from the only one. 
---
I really feel like no one who's working on design for 76 actually plays PvP games.
---
I also really feel like no one who's working on design for 76 actually plays the game or reads either reddit or their own forum, because they design things that any fool who's spent an hour in the game would know are utterly stupid.
---
Sooo glad I've gone back to FO4.
---
The only thing I worry about without fast travel is workshop defense.
---
Not against other players, that makes sense to me. But the random NPC attacks? That would be extremely frustrating without being able to fast travel back there.
---
That is exactly what I need.
---
Maybe in a couple months they'll say they've heard the feedback and promise to communicate 'more'. Again.
---
Could not agree more, 100% needs to  be a clean slate at least until people get leveled.  Only way to keep the dupes out of teh game as well
---
lol AN absolute end to something that NO company has ever defeated.  Keep dreaming.
---
they need neft the mele combat 
---
Never heard of survival mode, what is it exactly?
---
This. I fucking love this idea.
---
Yes you still need hit her atleast once to gain the loot. She will then scale up further as its based on how many are fighting her.
---
I can't say I'm proud of it
---
There's no person called "Bethesda". There's a company called Bethesda, but a legal organization doesn't listen or have feelings.
---
Now, clearly there are some people who are in a decision making role at Bethesda that are making some decisions you and I strongly disagree with (e.g. whoever made the decision to release the game in it's current state clearly screwed up). If anyone is 'not listening and not giving a fuck' it's those people. But getting annoyed at the people manning the social media accounts for decisions made by management is like giving a waiter a hard time for a chef screwing up a meal - it's not their fault, and the people you really ought to be angry with aren't anywhere to be seen. (Notice that Pete Hines on Twitter has stuck to re-tweeting stuff since launch?)
---
This is a pretty general pattern for any organization with more than a few people: the real decision makers have probably hired some meat shields so they don't have to actually interact with any angry customers.
---
And what do you expect the meat shields to do? Post a 1000 word "the truth behind Bethesda!" rant and quit before they get themselves fired? Not only would that mean losing their current job, they would also burn any chances of working in anything video game related in the future. Yeah, their replies are a little bit empty, and if we're still getting that sort of response 6 months after launch it might be time to start replying "Bethesda's thoughts and prayers are with us!" whenever we get that sort of generic response. But frustration at Bethesda is no reason to be rude to the meat shields.
---
Yep. There'll be people who are super good and have the time to put in thirty+ hours a week and be twenty levels ahead of everyone else. There'll be the people who farm Legendaries like crazy. This will never change. I will agree with what others say is they might wanna make people make a new character to level the playing field just a little bit. That or allow one character transfer in each direction, meaning you can move your level 150 from Adventure to Survival once and vice versa once. 
---
That being said...
---
The whole idea of Survival is HARDCORE. It is NOT FOR people who DO NOT like PvP. If you don't wanna be in a world where you risk being griefed to the point you're poor and lost your three-star legendary whatever and all your stimmies, DON'T play that mode. 
---
Hardcore means it SHOULD be possible you get that three-star bloodied/unyielding whatever and all your stimpacks stolen. 
---
I'll say again, if you don't want to risk losing the stims, caps, and weapons you love and worked so hard for, do not play Survival. It is that easy. It is not for the faint of heart. If you do play it, don't whine about it. You knew the risks.
---
I realize this may sound harsh, and I'm not trying to be harsh. Blunt, yes. Harsh, no. I know what it's like to lose a beloved weapon. I accidentally dropped my All Rise one day and it poofed into nothing. I was devastated.

You get a full chassis with the armor attached to it for finishing Belly of the Beast
---
I agree with 99% of this, but don't you care suggest getting rid of the Mr handy blade. With the right perks and/or mods that thing fucking shreds and it's one of my favorite weapons. 
---
Not to mention people could host with better servers if Bethesda is saving money with cheap servers.
---
Luck shines brightly on you my friend as that is the same thing I do and I've seen the bot four times over 600 hops. I have seen the Pied Piper about 100 times though, so there's that. 
---
They're not adding a new PvP system. It's literally the same one we already have just without the 'slap damage/initiation' mechanic.
---
Going into 4 months? The game came out just 2 months ago.
---
It’s called Pacifist Mode. We have it. You can NOT be randomly killed with it engaged.
---
Don’t let them get close then
---
You watch this game will be one of the greatest games out. If they keep fixing everything and listening to the community thisngame bro will be like no other. Have hope and encourage them. We want this game to be great. And if you don't like I said why the fuck are you even here?
---
I completely disagree, this mode was created for PVPers. I spend hundreds of hours honing my build and getting equipment to do PVP and that will all be put to waste if I don't get to bring my character with me. If you can't handle the worst the wasteland has to offer don't enter the worst part of the wasteland (survival mode). This is the exact same complaining that players have when they complain about capturing workshops and then being one shotted. If you don't want to be one shotted or aren't tanky enough to survive a TSE to the face DO NO CAPTURE WORKSHOPS or at the very least don't be surprised when it happens. Not only that but your suggestion DOES NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM AT ALL, because the players who are good at this game will get good gear again will be OP AGAIN much faster than you can because they've already done it one twice three times. And then the problem will still remain... The only difference is you'll have a 1 week buffer AT MOST but then you'll just be one shotted all the time.
---
We also need like and dislike button on players.
---
Now just get home defense 3 and you can build a missile launcher 
---
Part of a character build is the legendary effects that synergize with eachother or compliment what you're teying to do. This would limit builds alot. Everyone would just go melee or suck
---
Completely agree 👏🏼 
---
I see what you mean. Yeah, it’s a pipe dream but I thought I’d throw it out there. 
---
Personally, even before traveling is addressed I hope they consider removing player location dots from map as well as removing the hovering nameplates and the audio speaker symbol that pops up when talking. The immersion on those elements are terrible in my opinion and it really distracts from the game for me.
---
Well you had a bug that stopped loot spawning or somthing, you cant blindly blame others for stealing if they only took their own stuff, we all get our own separate loot from dead things. If you read the manual (metaphoricly) you would know this. You my freind are indeed a dingus. Dont feel bad, it happens to us all once in a while, it's just your turn today.
---
Right here. Only mode im goimg to play when it comes out. Adventure mode is to easy and there is no fear of death because there is no punishment for dying to make me fight for my life.
---
It isn’t possible

Off topic question. Why is it that when I was exploring the cranberry bog at ~lvl15 the lvl50 scortchbeasts just ignored me? Are they not worried about me just like I'm not worried about a lvl 1 Opossum?
---
Wait, you expect a new raid boss more frequently than 3-4 times a year?   
---
Have you ever played a video game? 
---
You can wear cosmetic clothing on top of your body armor pieces. There's no reason the same system can't be applied to head armor. 
---
Easy to say when you've got a decent rifle, try using a pea shooter though like OP wants everyone to do.
---
/u/lonevaultwanderer
---
Train stations should be safe zones then.
---
So should vault 76 area.
---
Of course then I’ll just sit outside a train station and kill anyone who comes to trade with the vendor but you get that
---
Because it’s Survival server that has non slap damage pvp. I personally don’t want it to devolve into kill everyone on sight. I’d actually like it to work like a wasteland where you don’t know if the person approaching can be trusted. I want them to incentivize being ruthless and killing others on sight and, I want it to incentivize helping each other and stopping the “raider” players. Player interaction currently is boring because usually nothing happens good or bad. If the “PVP” server becomes what you suggest it’s just boring in the opposite direction. I don’t want to have to choose servers based on whether every player interaction is violent or peaceful. I want both to coexist. 
---
Spot fucking on.
---
Hey /u/lonewanderer, THIS is what Bethesda needs to see AND respond to.
---
Prior to release I was thinking a decent motivation for PvP that would also slot right into the world of Fallout would be the ability to skin the player you defeat. Just the face. Imagine you could display the faces of your victims on a mannequin in you CAMP. The idea came from assuming we could possibly craft ghoul masks...
---
I can’t speak for the other dude, but I wanted this game to be good. I defended it until it released and for like a week after, but there’s nothing to defend. It’s a complete scam, crammed with exploits, bugs, server crashes and terrible, terrible micro transactions, all of which gets worse and worse with every update. Name any positive changes they have made since release that aren’t nerfs or basic QoL (such as Stash limit increase, which hasn’t gone up still!)? In the same year, Red Dead 2 came out and that’s a better RPG than a Fallout game?! The real question is, why would you feel the need to defend a game from a company who has repeatedly spit in your face since it released and claim those critical of it have worthless lives?

Bethesdas Inside the vault. January 24, 2019

Survival mode.
---
Bethesda im so happy to read more about your pvp mode it sounds absolutely fantastic. Did you read my mind? Feels like your giving me pretty much everything i want😊😊😊.  A perfect solution for those of us that want real risk and reward. Although i am a bit disappointed we wont all be forced to make new characters, regardless it still will be great fun. Maybe consider giving all players new and old a 1 time choice to permanently move there  character from one mode to the other.  I believe keeping the characters separate between modes will give everyone a better experience. This way a pve player can play out his character to end game and decide to make that switch when he or she feels bored of that normal mode experience or that wants to unlock all the perk cards for their build in a pve environment before stepping into a full time pvp role. The fact that we can jump to pve to farm items and switch to pvp mode just to pvp at anytime as much as we like almost feels like it takes away from the risk aspect.  I know for a fact once survival mode is released that will be the only mode for me i wont be stepping foot back into the normal mode no matter how hard it is to farm.  I will live with whatever is decided.
---
Vendors: Will players be able to kill each other in vendor locations? I feel vendor locations should be safe zones. Otherwise players will camp these locations waiting for some sucker to attempt to sell there loots. Im perfectly ok with getting ganked when im out and about looting on the map but not so much when ive successful survived a loot run and im trying to sell bulked items to the vendors.
---
. 
---
  The nurfs on the 2 shot ballistic weapons is also a great compromise to balance fair play.  I am also very pleased to hear about the leaderboards.
---
The Bethesda team is doing somthing really great here. Keep up the great  work 👏 👏 👏
---
The game isn't ready, period.
---
I mean...
---
Your whole point has just been invalidated. If melee can only use “pea-shooters” then melee will only be able to use sticks
---
Neither would be doing much damage with no perks.......
---
I hope everyone that wants to play survival mode has to start fresh and all the weapons are nerfed.  It's the only way I would play that mode.
---
Are people still complaining? Just move on. This was pathetic after the first few weeks. Fishing for upvotes used to be frowned upon around these parts. What happened reddit?
---
I found myself in the same shoes, hit my breaking point when my build just stopped working, the mechanics in this game are just so fucking broken (more so in the latest patch) it's beyond a joke.
---
Myself and the couple of people I was playing the game with have stopped playing, we're hoping Bethesda pull their heads out and actually **fix** their fucking game, but by the looks of this latest Inside The Vault, it doesn't look like that's going to be any time soon.
---
Pardon my French, but why in the actual fuck would I bother leveling up all over again on a PvP server, especially when so much of the game appears to be "work in progress"?  
---
It'll only be a repeat of the PvE servers, dupers will figure out a way to do their thing and flood the market with TSE weapons or whatever the meta ends up being, and the PvP worlds will end up being exactly what all these whining crybabies are afraid of, a 1 shot fest.  
---
Here's a better idea. Make the game's PvP balancing less shit. Fix the weapon balancing in general. The weapon balance at present is absolutely atrocious and the "fix" that's being called for here will merely be a bandaid.  
---
All of you calling for a PvE reroll, you know in you're hearts you're only delaying the inevitable. And much more likely, if they disable player markers on the map, you'll learn what a real ghost town the game is at the moment.
---
I don't have a full foot in this race as i would never ever touch the server choice. But i think its important that this mode succeeds by what ever means for pvp players to move them away from us.
---
I do wish they would consider and answer a few things i believe will effect pvpers enjoyment of the mode and end up sending them right back to us.
---
 
---
Questions i believe they need to consider for pvpers.
---
How do they balance solo and group play?. Will 4 man groups just wipe out solo players?. Will solo ques and group ques differ?. Will people have to rely on group play?.
---
What about all the items and stuff that could come over, wouldn't it deter new players to the setup?. Go to normal servers and farm everything in peace then take it all over to pvp server is that the intent?.
---
Then what about gear in general how will that even be balanced?. Its not balanced at the moment and that wrecks alot of the game already. Its also why 76 pvp is so meh at the moment. Its not a skill based setup. Throw on sents with player damage reduction and a nice AAE and TSE while fun for the person its very broken. So how will balancing be setup for pvp focused servers and will it differ and should it differ from pve balancing?.
---
During March? So we won't have any PvE content until that month? My god...
---
That's all well and good on PC, but for us poor console bastards, the cost of a new Xbox and a second TV is prohibitive, however much I like the game. 
---
I wish I could refund this game. 
---
This worked for me too.  I mean, how did someone think to try this for a fix?
---
This is the truth for certain types of griefers, the absolute truth. They won’t be too keen on fucking with people who could rips them to pieces either, adventure mode players will be stuck with those losers. 
---
Is that fucking why my base keeps getting destroyed? I just like the closeness to the bunker since im doijg enclave quests and of course the beautiful environment and then assaultrons and sentrys protecting me.
---
Other good camp locstion suggestions?
---
Right, that's gonna be the fun of it. Just let the world burn 🔥🔥🔥
---
It's already fixed? Has been for quite some time. New content being added next week and consistent patches since release to address any unforseen issues and exploits.
---
I don't own this game and all I've heard is terrible things. Is this game just dogshit or what?
---
So there has been talk of separate pve and pvp servers, but is this "survival" idea going to be the new pvp server? If so does that mean they're just going to leave the adventure servers the way they are or are they going to completely disable the pvp features in them? 
---
Lol more like the vault boy mask
---
They are fixing it just don’t expect every issue to be gone in one patch.
---
God you’re ignorant, you can’t even muster a full sentence response. Boy I wonder what the next bargain bin insult will be?
---
I don't need to read the FM, CBRN was one of my MOS's. For the purposes of the game, MOPP would be absolutely useless. 
---
I would have stayed in it and kept fighting but I ran out of stimpaks. I'm not a COD style player,I rely on strategy when I play and this run just doesn't leave time for that. I might hold it off till I get and explosive shot weapon. And congratulations if anyone doesn't understand how I didn't do it. Your a better player than me obviously. For me it was exceedingly difficult. 
---
I'm saying it needs to be consistent with other weapons. The over repair declining damage mechanic makes it garbage, compared to other weapons. I love the idea of the buzz blade, but it just needs to be reliable. No other weapons become trash when half their durability is used up.
---
From SBQ
---
Hopefully they'll have a beta event they're testing on the beta server so we can go even deeper.
---
"The workshops in the game are not required for you to even go near."  What a stupid statement. If they are not there for the players of the game to use, who are they there for? If they are not functional and compliment the game, they are a FAIL and need to be modified to improve the game. How other people choose to express themselves is none of your business. You just typed all that to have a whinge. It's an issues and feed-back thread - get it? Maybe you should demand that only compliments and grovelling to Bethesda, are allowed. You sound like a cranky loser. It's simple. If you do not like the reddit comments, don't read them.  
---
I agree that new characters are needed on a separate mode for pvp.
---
You know that is not how this works right?
---
Yes like real guns!! Isn't that a shock!
---
Pretty sure a better shot at getting Fusion Core Generator and Windmill Generator plans is it. 
---
Hmm, I can't figure out why you're being downvoted, unless the BGS reps are the ones doing it.
---
i agree. im just glad i never got a fallout tattoo tbh, cuz 76 and 4 make me hate a game that i loved for 20 years :(
---
Good info, thanks!
---
My Man!
---
OP, it looks like you were going to point out that this is the Prima Guide, rather than your own work, but your original post seems to be missing that information.
---
TBH, you might want to check in with the moderators to make sure you are allowed to post this, since I presume it is copyrighted material?
---
I understand completely, I played this game for probably over 150+ hours and with work here lately haven't touched it but maybe twice since the last patch. And that was for an hour or two. Good stuff. 
---
Im here because I can, just like you. Sure yeah this game will be a masterpiece. In 5 years maybe. Good luck holding onto f76 for a few years while ill be enjoying many other titles that are not released in a complete thrash state or do other things in life that will be more fun and productive than holding onto this piece of shit for few years licking Bethesda buttholes until this game becomes a "greatest masterpiece".
---
This poems for you
---
Violets are violet, theyre not fucking blue 👍👍
---
Shit..
---
Fallout is fun
---
Until i cant run
---
If they dont fix this STASH weight, i think ill be done?  Yea, that one works 👍
---
What if I told you this isn’t one of those games. How are you ever going to wipe anyone off a map when all they have to lose is junk aid and caps. If you want a real pvp game, there’s dozens out there, where the stakes are actually real. You and your friends have set yourselves up for disappoint with this one.
---
Nope. Not weekly. When it's appropriate, sure!
---
I'd like to see Overwatch or League of Legends style dev updates dealing with upcoming content, patches, community issues.
---
Text is better than nothing but in our current era, video is king.
---
Seriously needs to be just a separate mode with new character creation. Should also be able to loot weapons as well as whatever else they are carrying.
---
Nothing to be fixed about people destroying other ppl's CAMPs. Revenging or being notorious bad guy isn't griefing.
---
But PvE mode would get support. Quite many people are not happy with any sort of PvP.
---
I don't get the empty feel from my CAMP. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruedpOCKxLQ&amp;t=4s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruedpOCKxLQ&amp;t=4s)
---
Dude, I understand.  I’m not equating pvp folks with griefers, but it’s the primary aspect of griefing.  Against real PvP players they won’t stand a chance.  They will run like the bitches they are.  But it gives Beth an opportunity to cancel out their outlets for those of us that want nothing to do with it.  
---
I’m tired of PvP.  I’m old and want to coop.  
---
We can have both and hopefully chase the jerks back to RUST.
---
Ditto. It's almost unplayable at times. 
---
Bethesda saw PUBG success. Bethesda saw Fortnite raking in BILLIONS in a year. Bethesda got a full chubby. So here comes multiplayer Fallout with PvP mode, choo choo! And that's why we're having the PvP mode.
---
That’s how they did it in raids in Destiny. The loot would show up on the right side of your screen when the boss was killed. It didn’t ever cause crashes as far as I know. Now, that being said, we know how prone to crashing FO76 is..
---
This guy is on the money although I think 6 months is way to slow ppl will be op in a week or two since they already know how it works.If your character is not strong enough to participate in the PVP mode don't do it. Look at is this way all the people you hate will leave the normal adventure mode and go into survival mode so you will be free to do whatever you want with none griefing you in adventure mode.
---
But...what if...we *don't* need more stash space?
---
Hear me out. I fit like 300 of every resource (except nuked mats) in my stash, and then some. Way more than that really. The game enforces a hoarding mentality, so no matter how big they make the stash space it'll *never* be enough. Your kit shouldn't be taking up your whole inventory and your stash shouldn't have multiple entire gear sets in it. Maybe an extra piece of equipment or two you use for certain activities or approaches. Everyone will just need *one* more suit of power armor, just *another* cool Legendary they found but will probably never use, maybe a *handful* more of these aid items I'll use that one time in the future, let's stuff *these* mini nukes I'm storing just in case back here...
---
All we need is a player hub or market system of some kind and we're golden on having things we don't really need. Well I guess you can make big caps selling your unused power armors, that Legendary that'd see more use by someone else, those aid items someone could use for a silo raid, these mini nukes someone's going to take to help down the Queen faster.
---
It's all about being disciplinarian enough to stop hoarding once your resources are stable and then just manage them while you play. Hoarding is something you should do when you fucked yourself on a resource or took a big loss on a resource, not every day constantly. I play war machine and suck down steel and lead constantly to keep my .50 MG pumping death out and still manage my stash space between 70-50 extra pounds to screw around with. That's space that I know I don't need for anything, I'm sitting on all the resources I'll need at a given time and then some, as well as decent amounts of extra gear pieces I'm holding for alts. I can trash some cork or asbestos or whatever if I need to make room for a crazy Legendary or something.
---
Live Buddhist, stop hoarding what isn't useful.
---
Why would I want to stress myself with PvP when my real life is already full of stress? I just wanna sit around in my C.A.M.P. and let the time go by, live peacefully in Appalachia...
---
Its neither true or false until one of us provides evidence. Science at its best
---
I read somewhere that it doesn’t affect the power generator plan you get, but it does affect the experience you gain and the scrap items you get.
---
3.07% on XB1. 3% of gamers on either system are dictating content....not a smart business move by Bethesda. 
---
It's a work in progress. Depends entirely on you at what level of "fixedness" is considered acceptable.
---
Easy fix. No legendary items. That will keep things level and fair no matter what level you are.
---
I’ve have a decent amount of hours in too, I haven’t seen most of the southern map and none southeast. I like that I still have more to see. I’ve found my niche going to the same areas. Can’t wait to explore more honestly, and found my first two shot weapon. So now I’m excited for loot drops:)
---
Yup, been playing mmo’s for two decades, and over time, perhaps you can’t remember, they have steadily provided less and less endgame content.
---
Only if it's payable in atoms.
---
Point taken, it could, but server resources these days all scale dynamically, and this wouldn't need an increase in overall server capacity. 
---
It does require setting up an additional server configuration but if implemented simply as a routing flag for players it should be relatively easy. All configurations of servers would still provision and use the same pool of server resource on demand as needed. 
---
You’re complaining about people complaining, hmmmmmmmmm
---
There's no tension then. The not knowing I imagine is half the fun for some PvP players.
---
I don't get it. 
---
They'll never punish people for wrecking camps beyond the current system. You could hope they'll remove the ability to do so from the game, but that creates a bunch of other problems.
---
Same thing here. I'd love to relax up there with a view.
---
Armor in F76 is summed up and applied to your whole body, with your head only having a damage modifier (x2 or something) if somebody shoots you there. 
---
This way, all hats/headgear can be cosmetic and we don't need an underlay/overlay for them. The exception is power armour, for some reason or other. 
---
So rest assured that your combat armour helmet may not be providing you with DR, but the DR it would have applied to you has already been added to the rest of your armour pieces to make up for it!
---
That and the horrible drop rates for anything even decent. 
---
From what they’ve stated thus far, adventure will stay the same, obviously this is subject to change. So who knows
---
Dunno, I love the Fallout franchise and open world gunning with friends but the PVP and PVE system looked in the reviews so drastically broken that I shied away from buying it. For example. 
---
What happens if a fresh slate does some "XP glitches" and fucks over everyone in the server?
---
i had a 7.5k bounty at one point
---
Atomic shop is awful, I get the whole challenge reward system for the atom points but everything is so expensive unless you have the money to spend on buying the points. 
---
I would care if the cultlist dagger and knife was axed from the game! As well as the Bowie knife I have 3* of all 3 of those and love them! 
---
The role play is rubbish like you say. I also want to see more from real play vendors, seen some awesome ones and would be a cool thing to promote in the game. 
---
You clearly have a lot of hours and knowledge of the game. I appreciate you taking the time to put forward fellow vault dwellers grumbles, as will some quite simple tweaks it could be a fun game to grind with all our friends 😊👏🏼
---
Survival mode for me is exactly what it is....survival. one shot to the face...dead. what's the problem? Besides, this is a new gameplay style being implemented, it's going to need tweeking like all other pvp games. Anyone remember Ultima online? I shat myself everytime a PK entered my view but without PKs the game would have gotten old real quick. I think the devs are on the right path. Fallout 76 survival may may turn out to be great  once all the details are addressed. 
---
I butcher the corpse and throw it into the river chunk by bloody chunk. 
---
Honestly the more I think about it the more this seems like the reason.
---
I just log in, collect stuff to get my 1200 caps, then log back out.
---
Sure I can do the challenges to get Atoms but they're a bit boring.
---
Rather spend my time playing with myself.
---
Why even bring up survival mode?  I really hope BGS is working on some end game content...maybe open up those vaults that are sealed?  Make them like raid events. That would be nice. I really don't care about PVP.
---
They keep saying, "and much more!", so either they already know a lot more than they're saying and they don't want us to know what it is, or they're lying about there being much more and they don't want us to know there isn't much more. Either way, it's garbage PR.
---
I’ve been there multiple times and never saw an alien once
---
I get that it’s hard to increase space with server limits, and no matter how much they increase it there will always be people screaming “increase the stash limit!”
---
I think what would help is if they changed the perks for weight reduction overall rather then weight reduction when carrying. A super sledge weighs 12lbs right now for me(not fully maxed out perk) but when I store it the super sledge goes back to 20lbs. 
---
I don’t need a massive storage space overhaul, but if weight reduction was consistent with storage weight then I think that would be a big improvement.
---
Then again, when I say it out loud I see no difference then if they kept it the same and increased storage space 
---
I think they're adding the PVP mode now simply because it's fairly easy, relatively speaking. It doesn't really require any new assets or similar production, just a few minor script changes, followed by balance testing. It's a relatively lower effort way to add new gameplay quickly, to try and satiate some players.
---
I do hope they work on added improved end-game stuff, though, like you said.
---
Yeah they dont even need ro nerf TSE. Not sure if Bethesda even knows you can make yourself immune to explosive damage. If they do why nerf it. 
---
OK. I checked that out a while back and didn’t find anything, I just assumed it was part of future content. I’ll check that out.
---
Thanks!
---
Or they’re still working on it and don’t know what will be done in time
---
F
---
Its going to be no different then the mode I have already put 500 hours into..
---
I still say players shouldn’t show up on the map at all in this mode. You shouldn’t be able to tell what kind of player they are until you are in proximity and have to decide to fight or flight. 
---
pc only
---
Not allowing transfers will just move that point down the road a few weeks. 
---
Or do you feel they also should wipe all survival mode chars every few weeks or something? 
---
Definitely, not the way I want this game to go. Fallout 76 has its greatness and should go after those games. I understand they have to do it for money, though.
---
I have multiple TSE weapons and don’t have much problems in PvP outside of marsupials moon jumping out of my FOV and I just don’t support this new update plan, it’s stupid. Really fucking stupid.
---
Or for a version I can actually read and customize, I can go to fo76map.com. 
---
This is bullshit. Adventure mode should be thee only mode. Pvp server does nothing to solve the problem of pvp being shit. This pvp addition is going to ruin everything. 
---
I'm not saying to remove weapons from the game. I want them to be as good as other weapons. There's so many weapons that just aren't as good, for no reason.
---
Great response. Easy cop out
---
You mean you aren't psychic? /s
---
Awarding double the caps is going to be exploited hard if it doesn’t all drop from the killed player. 
---
It looks like they are doing anti cheat checks on each load 
---
Beggars get nothing.
---
Grass that is trespassing the structure. 
---
It's kinda lame if you ask me, I like the game a lot but this is just lazy. 
---
Well that's just downright pointless. That hardly seems like what the community has been asking for. 
---
Did you not read the part where it says damage will be scaled ? 
---
Agreed.
---
Yes I am attached to my character and honestly the thought of doing it again is just exhausting haha. I like the bracket idea, sort of like wow, every ten levels is new bracket haha. You would def have guys decked out and not ever leaving "29" lol
---
Oh sorry one last thing lol
---
Completely agree on the atom / money pricing being way out of whack. As much as I'm not buying atoms, I think an armour / weapon skin  should be a maximum £3 / £4 item (UK here). Even if that means reducing our in-game atom rewards too, to maintain the ratio of time / atoms. 
---
Anyway peace out, mate!
---
This is a pretty great idea my man
---
go read beths blog 
---
I thought you only got the plans
---
?
---
Thank you. You have your ducks in a row in that head of yours.
---
Same, good riddance I say. I’d be happy if I could play 76 offline if I’m being honest
---
TES Legends and ESO have regular stream and it's awesome. It shouldn't be as need arises imo cause it'll just be treated as more damage control/promotion. Weekly official content would increase a sense of community between players and devs. Also u/LadyDevann. We legit have the best CMs. 
---
Yeah I agree with that. A lot of the weapon damage ratio is completely fucked though as we know, it would be nice if they fixed it as a melee build a lot of the weapons are lower damage than they should be. Would give us a greater selection in weapons to choose from considering how many there are and how many are actually worth using. 
---
For what it's worth, I like the idea. Thanks for taking the time to write it up.
---
Your too quick to say this now but you wait till pvp servers come out and YOU lose you 3 star one if a kind legenday weapon and have to pvp with a stock weapon. Then your gona be the one crying. This will bother you and you know it will. Sure i have the option not to join survival but what if i want to pvp without having to worry about losing wrapons and armour. And i know for 100% im not the only one and a part of you doesbt want this either
---
Yeah man, I wanted to rebuild the wasteland with friends... that sounded fun.
---
This **is** the commando category we are talking about. All guns in it will burn ammo fast. 
---
What lots of people following the TSE fad do, is use TSE’s (or TS-anything really) for very short bursts, simply because TSE makes recoil so bad that the mods and perks just cant reign it in. The second if you’re lucky, third if not round onwards are basically coming out somewhere sideways, and don’t hit anything unless you’re literally inside the SBQ’s bellybutton. So people use TSE’s as glorified bolt action single shot weapons (I had an argument with someone on the internet about this yesterday. Bleh.)
---
The point is, commando eats ammo, but gives something back. A slow single shot rifle will do once and a half, maybe twice the damage per hit. An assault rifle with a semi auto receiver will even be able to deliver some shots rapidly. 
---
But what you get from **disciplined** recoil commando is the ability to turn your entire magazine into a single, 4-5 second strike, or whatever subset of it you wish. 
---
At the cost of a ammo. 
---
If for weapon, mod, recoil, mutation or TS legendary reasons you don’t get they value, your point is good - why sacrifice the ammo? 
---
If you are setting up to get that value our, it becomes a category of weapons what exceeds melee DPS (once you get honest about how needing to run to your targets, or divide your slow sledge swings between 30 whitesprings ghouls, affects the overall time you took you, and how the overall number of ghoul points you took divides by that many seconds).
---
Legit
---
I'm not sure how Warframe does things but I'm all for a greater sense of community. 
---
So basically everyone's 100+ levels is shit now because there's a new server? That's stupid and there's no way they are going to make all the players that stuck it out start over. 
---
True, but I know from personal experience that you can kill a passive player in a few seconds with the right setup (hint: one way involves rad damage).
---
It turns out there are more places than just those two locations to nuke, nothing like SBQ but spawns on the level of WS and other things around.
---
Creating a PVP centered environment intended for these kind of people just encourages those people to NOT play that mode and continue with their steamrolling of camps and players. Psychology 101 dawg 
---
I think the biggest problem with Fallout 76 PvP is there's is no Balancing. Games that strive to be PvP games spend so so so much time balancing and making sure things have counters and counter-play.
---
Look at games like Fortnite, League of Legends, Overwatch, World of Warcraft. All of the companies that run these games have super regular balancing patches, some have opt-in servers used to test balancing, and all have huge teams that play-test and make sure changes are affecting the meta in a positive way.
---
76 is incredibly fun! But that's because you're slow building your character to become stronger and stronger. For instance, currently what's the counter to someone that in full X-01 power armor? Get your own X-01 power armor. What's the counter to a TSE combat shotgun? Your own TSE weapon (preferably longer range).
---
I think PvP could be really fun in the future! With mutations, some legendary weapons, legendary armor, interesting perks, etc! There's a ton of fun aspects that could make PvP enjoyable! But we're a long way away from that. Fix big issues that are hindering PvP and regular play, add some form of balancing (and balancing feedback), and if you can't fix all the exploits implement a way to quickly detect and punish people who do exploit!
---
I love FO76, almost have 300 hours. I'm not really a fan of PvP in most games, but I definitely would give it a try if done correctly!
---
Nope. If I join Survival, have like a 3* Grognak and someone kills me for it, I knew the risks. I might be mad at the player but I won't be mad at Bethesda. Hardcore means hardcore. 
---
This one was just sitting on one of the benches in plain sight up in the monorail car, near one of the skeletons wearing lab coats.
---
Liberty Prime copy pasta
---
My current character would put everyone on farm. Looking forward to testing. 
---
I played the current game. I don't want a new pvp only server. This really sucks. 
---
&gt;They are fixing it just don’t expect every issue to be gone in one ~~patch~~ lifetime.
---
They seem to be very rare. I'm level 74 and still haven't seen 'Patrol Duty' pop up.
---
Can you fast travel to my location? I already joined your instance
---
I have a funny feeling the ones demanding this new character do not really pvp, and are the same ones that screamed nerf tse to ts, to they are tired of people burning down their camps.
---
Didnt they say before there woild be new content at the end of january. Now they say march. Wtf. How do they think qaiting 5 months for a dlc on a hrindy game us a good idea. I love this game. But i dont have 2 more months of this in me. Especially with anthem and division 2 coming. 
---
I don't see it going the distance if that's what your after. Enjoy it for what it is, but don't expect a long run.
---
I’m unsure what you mean, are you looking for role players already or asking if anyone would like to start? 
---
Let's just say they are the best when it comes to chatting with the community and involving them alot.
---
They do their own personal streams, chat on the forums and with fans all the time.
---
They then do dev streams.
---
https://youtu.be/sf9QpXSGryg
---
Then they also do prime times.
---
https://youtu.be/Tco9nJHqY5E
---
I just don’t think this game’s engine is suited for PVP.
---
"When someone physically attacked him for having differing political opinions, he spun it to make himself the victim".   
---
You're a fucking psychopath. 
---
My game was working fine at beta. Wasn't til the first patch that it started freezing me out of 1/10th of the map. Stupid people making a new pvp mode instead of making the game playable and fun. 
---
Definitely not pointless, love the game and play every night, only thing I play. I have two characters and just created two more. As long as you patient while they working on fixing it. Get it on sale, but well worth the experience if you a fallout fan. Personally I love it and spend countless hours on it.
---
I haven't really felt like touching the game since I finished all the quests and achievements. If they do put out some more content for PVE, I'll probably check it out. 
---
I will tell you this though. Their overall handling of this game, botched launch, canvas bag debacle, the support ticket system doxxing everybody, money grabs with the atom shop, nerfs no one calls for, all of it, I'm not buying Starfield, the next Fallout, or ES6. I know Bethesda puts out buggy games, I still bought their games day 1.
---
Ever since the whole paid mod thing with Skyrim, and a whole bunch of things since, I no longer recognize Bethesda.

I dropped my first one solo today and despite having a melee build and only around 15 stimpacks I made it all the way through. I carried my exploding Gatling gun and a fat man for good measure and once I ran out of stimpacks just devoured whatever aid I had stocked that I never got rid of. While fixing the reactor room I kind of ignored the robots and ran around fixing the pipes. Bring Med x with you as well, as rough as it is you’ll get there.

Welcome to Darktide.

"This percentage point I invented wholecloth isn't false until someone proves me wrong"
---
Yeah, not how sourcing works, hon 
---
...err Google sheets
---
I think a PVP mode is just what a lot of people want, but don't realize it. Like perhaps it will entertain those who are bored enough to where they leave for this mode instead of griefing casual players. Maybe it's their way of attempting to address the situation in a round about way.
---
This is actually a pretty awesome idea. 
---
I just was wondering if someone ( i dont know if I will) would like to do that. 
---
Gotta get those twitch views, and that means lots of bros running around ganking and having 'hilarious hijinks'
---
atom store stuff has already been made for the year. they are just releasing it piecemeal. 
---
ah! when i first started out i used to be a “responder.” helping out and all that jazz. now that i’m already over 200 i kinda do my own thing. but i’d be interested again.  
---
I lost a FULL set of X0-1 PA with jet pack yesterday 😩 and many more items from this stupid Houdini glitch were stuff disappears. Probably a known thing but I always drop a piece of ammo on the floor before I drop something so if the bag isn’t there I know the floor is buggy ( I then find that’s when I tend to loose things so server hop) feel your pain man 😩 
---
Pacifist mode has been in the game since the E3 announcement...
---
It will click one day. This is 2019 and services such as google exist. I am not holding your hand and spoon feeding this to you. 
---
I keep 100 each of each junk material. That adds up fast. Plus some power armor chassis and fusion cores (&gt;90% charged), and some sentimental pieces like blade of bastet and alien blaster. I don't stash aid, except spoiled food waiting to become fertilizer. No ammo. And one of each and every outfit piece I've found.
---
Selling/discarding the excess puts me around 380 in stash (probably 240 junk) and 110 on character, but a couple hours play brings me back to 600+260, and I feel like I need to stop until the next vendor reset.
---
I was thinking at the movie "the purge" where inside the mess there is always someone willing to help. Do you know this movie?
---
In the Setting menu there should be a Public/Private toggle for CAMPs. If public the CAMP show up on everyone's map and you can name your CAMP.
---
If private it is the current model, nothing shows up.
---
heard of, never seen honestly. they seemed a little...cheesy 
---
With how kind and giving the fallout community has shown itself to be, the pvp servers will be empty af. Fallout people want to work together or as a group. This mode is going to be a disaster. 
---
thats why PAssive mode needs to include your CAMP. 
---
Pacifist mode is next to useless to prevent griefing and getting ganked. Literally the only people who would object to players being able to turn off PvP entirely are sweaty try-hards.
---
If the PvP in this game wasn't a complete garbage fire I'd be all for it. However it IS hot garbage and as such I want absolutely nothing to do with it. 
---
I don't want my base destroyed randomly, I don't want to be doing my own shit and randomly have someone gank me, I don't want my VATs to target other players.
---
If I want PvP I've got a ton of other games that I play that scratch that itch and they actually balance their shit.
---
Fallout? I just want to listen to the radio and shoot the shit with friends while doing random PvE crap.
---
A few things you should take into account,
---
1. Explosive does less damage to flying SBs. So for those who want to be well rounded, they should take this into account.
---
2. Explosive Shotgun does a lot more explosive damage. Each pellet does more than it says and people have calculated the ACTUAL damage to be far greater than listed damage. I sadly can not find the thread were the calculations were posted.
---
The problem is most people didn't put in the time and effort ...they duped 
---
I'd go as far as a bit of a tutorial in the vault. Maybe have you trade with Mr. Handy and walk them through offering, requesting, pricing and offers only stuff. 
---
+karma
---
Its xause you throw out the old ones each time, so you have to craft a new iron sight
---
I would be down for that! Sounds fun, take my upvote!!!
---
It’s loss
---
Thanks, I’ve been thinking about that for the past hour
---
As a veteran F76 player, I like this idea... A lot. But, the goal of introducing a new PvP mode is not only to satisfy players such as ourselves, but to bring in a new fan base as well.  Let's face it, sales haven't been excellent. Games are a business &amp; Bethesda really needs to make some coin on this game. 
---
Flatwood monsters also count as Aliens.
---
Because the suits and heads decided that was a good idea, assuming they'll pull in a new group of pvp fans who will buy the game and make Bethesda money. 
---
I would bet that the community managers, artists, and programmers all know this is a terrible idea, but they don't have any say in this. 
---
Corporate gets to make these awful choices and blame everyone else when it tanks and brings the rest of the game with it
---
I will be one of the ones that kills you if I see you, or even smell you.
---
I'm down but i play on the Xbox. What are you on?
---
No, we are Cartman.... we always have been.....
---
Thanks man!
---
So is everyone in PA and in the chain CTDing? Not sure I understand but am fascinated nevertheless....
---
There is. Somebody who isn't red can still be a player killer.  You still don't know. But then those who want to be known. Those who love to be chaotic. To be red. To be the scary outlaw on the map. Then they can have fun with that too. The ones who want to be white and friendly and then kill you and steal your junk etc. They can be the unknown part. And then there are the vigilantes or the law. They hunt the reds. Protect the weak if they see a low level being harassed. They can swoop in and help them.
---
I will give you that; that I can imagine it sucks having your camp destroyed. I’ve never had any negative encounters at all and I’ve played A LOT. The targeting I agree with as well, but I’m sure that can be tackled in the future.
---
However, have you ever randomly gotten killed with Pacifist Mode on? That was actually my point.  
---
We do, though.
---
Uhh yes we do lol.
---
I'm on Pc but I'm not looking for someone to play with. Just wanted to hear opinions
---
People forget that 50 is essentially finished in terms of power level. It doesnt take long at all to get to level 50. Seeing a lvl 300 something doesnt mean anything. You're just as strong as he is. He may have more variability in his build but if you build right you can at least be great at one thing. 
---
Not quite sure what your point is..
---
Who is "we"?
---
Why would you be killing yourself?
---
You can say ass and fuck, you know. Kind of odd you'd only censor one letter out of those words
---
People like is very important too :D
---
Like country roads on repeat?
---
Wrong. I do want to kill myself. 
---
There is a crouch mechanic if you want to hide yourself from the map. Without knowing where people are on the map people will hardly ever see each other. I think it's very important feature for finding friends and foes.
---
On what platform 
---
I agree, they need to focus on the coop aspect, pvp always leads to a bad place.
---
Buy cause you probably getting it so cheap it’s worth it 
---
It's only happened twice but I've definitely went from full health to nothing before I could even comprehend what was going on.
---
Hacks or exploits? I dunno, eitherway two times is enough to make me rather just disable PvP on my character on the server-side so it can't even potentially happen again.
---
Mostly, but the pvp servers would be separate instances. Ultimately you're creating more sessions on the server due to the split up game modes, regardless of the actual playing population not changing. As such you end up using more server resources, even if it's just marginal.
---
In your opinion.
---
Agree with you on caps but the punishment is super-50% damage to other players is crazy when you think of a pvp mode...
---
Sentinel/cavalier and Assassin's armor combined with the explosive resistance perk.
---
I've been saying for weeks once that games is out, so am I ✌🏽
---
It didn’t even show them taking any damage whatsoever.
---
Ok. Well then don’t. But that’s usually the way to do it. Do you actually think they don’t track disconnects and such??? I’m sure they do. It might shock you to know that someone just disconnecting isn’t a lot of information. This is *super* basic stuff. When you put in a ticket it helps them get more information, and allows them to, if needed, follow up for more info like the specs of your system and connection. The entitlement. Jeebus. 
---
Yeah...you mean all the high level characters that glitched the fuck out of this broken ass game...this game is a fucking joke and it will never be good. Took a month to realize it and I’ll never play it again. Enjoy your pile of PvP garbage.
---
 Dupers have unfortunantly flooded the game with stupid powerful weapons and armor. But honestly that would have happened eventually over time without any help from exploiters.
---
Since  Inevitably everyone who plays the game long enough would have TSE weapon to equip. No dupers just means everyone is using them way way later on. A year from now we would all have them.
---
Spoiling the natural progression of the end game for the community sucks.  But duping didnt do anything to "unbalance" pvp. With my current set up TSE weapons are not even remoteley a problem. Meaning that there are mechanics in place to balance the opness of these weapons. They dont even need to be nerfed.
---
Problem is people would rather complain than go in game and try stuff out. 
---
That's why they are planning it. They want to launch it at the same time to draw player count and not lose to D2
---
You think some people are going to require a few days to power level and start farming? 
---
Or that playing a solid 10 hours on launch wouldn't give you a head start over most of the player base, who is not likely able to give 10 consecutive hours?
---
U wanna buy some plans come c me in 5 mins Bigdaddy011090 is my gt
---
the marcostyle report was pretty good too, im intrigued if it will launch better than divi 1 
---
You know that obviously it isn't working right or I wouldn't of posted it.
---
Agreed
---
Hey, lets make another post on this exact same topic! 
---
Wtf
---
I just got rid of my three turrets and it cleared up half of my budget
---
PvP bringing out the best? HA!
---
In Watoga, vendor phoenix. He sells the plans for about 1000 caps.
---
I find it whatever and people should go find better things to do than complain.
---
RE2 remake demo: complaints
---
IRacing: complaints
---
Overwatch: complaints
---
Red Dead redemption: complaints
---
AC Odyssey: complaints
---
Fallout 76 has issues. Oh well. Don't like it, express it calmly, or go somewhere else. 
---
This^^ I run a full assassins sentinel set and my buddy had to reload his TSE combat shotty to finish me off while standing still. I take no real damage if I have AP. 
---
It’s amazing to me how many people want to see it shut down. It’s like throwing your toys away because you don’t like them but you don’t want other kids to enjoy them either. Such a childish mentality. 
---
Facts. Lots of things to consider here.
---
that is the boldest of moves cotton, Best to beat it because a new release has much more pull than a new mode
---
This is truth. These guys probably just got done faster
---
People pay that much because there's nothing else to spend them on. The game has absolutely no cap sinks, and any potential opportunities for them were wasted. Rare and valuable mods like jet packs, calibrated shocks, etc are locked behind rng rather than a high price. The few paint jobs available outside of the atom shop are either free or also given out purely based on rng. There is no way to craft "unique" items like enclave plasma rifles or x-01 mods with a rare resource that you can only buy from certain NPCs for caps. I just hit the 25k cap limit for the third time this month already, and have absolutely nothing to spend it on. I just gave away a spare small letters set to somebody else for free because I couldn't even charge him anything in the trade menu. If you have 25000 caps and tens of thousands' worth of legendaries on you, you will pay far more than 1850 caps for something you want. That's just how economies work
---
It didn’t even show them taking damage. 
---
Survival mode should definitely include a requirement for a fresh character (gear) or for that matter there should be gear wipes across the board.  Getting tired of jerks and their cloned explosive gear wrecking my camp and workshops because you can't defend against that.  It's basically guaranteed at this point if another player comes at you looking for pvp they've got some two-shot explosive crap they bought or duped in.  Re-gearing isn't that hard and not game ending. Having to put up with ass-hats who take advantage of exploits and game bugs is game ending.
---
Two shots take accuracy penalty. Dense chest mod and Fireproof perk negate explosive damage. And then other legendary armor effects.
---
I’ve noticed crashes get worse for me 5 minutes after some motherfucker one shots the SB queen.
---
That couldnt work, the server couldnt manage a bunch of peiple with 170000 lbs of junk spread across thirty stashes
---
If 99% damage is mitigated you aren't going to see any change in health. The armor stacking is pretty broke at the moment
---
They don't need to beat it, just show share holders they are retaining numbers. As long as they see people logging in they are good
---
I have never seen an online game that didn’t have a support ticketing system. Most support ticketing systems are just a place that you go to put in a ticket. Yes it is absolutely, positively commonly done through tickets lmao. 
---
Yup exactly. They won't take any damage if they maintain ap. I smash two nuka quantums if I'm in a crazy fight with newb tubes.  
---
Oh okay I've server hopped there alot but haven't found it. Does it have a level limit do you know? My alt I want it for is level 22
---
Yeah that's honestly why I'm consider ti again. Wouldn't be the first multiplayer game with a horrible start whicih got patched alright, okay thanks guys, think I'm gonna buy it. 
---
I don’t think you’re losing the extra carry weight, you are however losing the extra extra carry weight. That’s a known bug. When you log out/log in wearing excavator you gain +200 instead of the +100. Unless you have both legs with calibrated shocks, then you’ll gain +300 instead of +200 
---
Perhaps after the TSE explosive nerf it'll be meaningful, but currently even with it players one shot galore.
---
bullets make red,
---
and lasers make white, 
---
when im staring at your corpse,
---
ill know i was right.
---
^(looks like we got a bleeder!)
---
This is gold, I highly encourage you to submit a ticket to Bethesda to make sure they read this :)
---
Even without the duped weapons most players can still be one shot easy with mid tier legendary weapons. While I agree less effort was put in to get these godly weapons, since the chance to get a certain TSE is 2,000,000 to 1 (not my maths pulled it from a reddit post that simulated the weapon drop rate). That doesn't mean there was no effort put in, I don't know how many of my weapons are duped, the only ones I can be sure about are the ones I found. But i still payed over 10k caps (over a week of collecting and selling to vendors) for each one or farmed for many hours to get to trade multiple items for one TSE. Its not like you could hop onto the market and pay 1k caps for one, despite the price being dropped due to duping.
---
We need more recipes, not ways to craft and gather mats.
---
I’ve seen reports like this before and there were people testing if you could get killed with Pacifist Mode on while the other person was fully stacked on Explosive Bobbleheads (exploit) and it still barely did any damage. So, there might’ve been a case of you being wanted or it might’ve involved a workshop.
---
Don’t get me wrong, I wouldn’t mind an even better pacifist mode; especially for the camp-issue and the targeting, but I’ve had zero issues with being randomly killed with it enabled and it shouldn’t be possible. If you keep experiencing this, I would suggest keeping track of what happened and submit a ticket to support.
---
&gt;If you have the nuclear keycard but don’t wanna get all those codes let me know.  
---
Pretty much nobody grabs the code pieces anyways. They just go to nukacrypt to look up the weeks launch code. 
---
Should have been PVP/PVE on launch. It's good that their adding PVP servers but bad that they've neglected the game as a whole. It''s not the fault of people who want PVP or the PVP servers themselves, it's the problem that Bethesda put out an incomplete game that was obviously rushed as a holiday cash grab
---
I mean beat it as in beat the release date, so people are already invested in the survival characters and less likely to jump ship
---
Because they know they can bend brand-loyal dicksuckers over the table and get away with it.
---
Yeah id agree... If they reworked the game to add this then i think having two different prices displayed - one your asking price and the other the price the customer offers or item part exchange deal might not be too complex to implement,,, then we can haggle better especially with users who do not share the same RL speaking language its hard to haggle on the mic then...
---
I have a funny feeling most demanding this do not pvp, and are the same ones who always complain their camps are getting burned to the ground by a meanie with a TSE.
---
I’ll take the Deathclaw egg omelette with firecracker berry juice, please 
---
Dude, are you ok? Are you dyslexic or is English not your primary language? Is there any way we can help you write better?
---
It does the opposite of bringing inflation down lol. Caps are becoming more and more worthless every day because most traders are already at 25k and refusing to even trade for caps. Even if dupers never existed, this would have happened, just a few months later. All of the good stuff like jet pack plans, god-tier weapons, etc usually have "non-cap offers only" listed next to them. This method is essentially as good as executing everybody in your town and saying "see? no crime! because nobody's left to do the crime!" What we need is not an arbitrary limit that kills market activity, but a cap sink in the game to actually give them value. 
---
Playing with friends is a great time exploring and picking up trash together
---
Maybe a day or two. To much more an people will already be loosing interest 
---
Can I ask why you expected more? They have zero pvp expericne and the only multiplayer game they have made is a disaster.
---
I feel you bro I wish it was more like fortnite to. Good thing we let youtube reviews form our opionions for us, who knows what kind of shenanigans we would get into otherwise.
---
I think I was around level 25-30 when I first seen it. I know that the lowest level of gattling gun is 20, so you might be too low level.
---
Never played the division or even heard of it. Just looked it up so its a wasteland type game but based on our timeline made by Ubisoft?.
---
Sounds intresting but i am personally only here for the Fallout brand. Had this game released without the Fallout bit i would never have touched it myself.
---
I do hope once they finish up this pvp stuff the main focus is all on pve content, dungeons , raids , quests etc.
---
Unless they are stacking there is no way
---
88% left the vault
---
33% completed into the fire (firebreathers) 
---
6.8% completed scorched earth.
---
2.2% reached level 100.
---
1.8% revived 20 ppl
---
3.4% killed 20 ppl
---
When [Google Lively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Lively) was around in 2008 (which also used the Gamebryo engine, but I doubt that's relevant), I made a haunting discovery as to why older characters took so much longer to load into rooms than new ones. I had captured some of the http responses while entering a room, and one of them was my character's inventory, somewhere around 30mb (though gzipped to a tiny fraction of that). For every quantity of every item, they duplicated the full item record, description and all. Nothing was stacked at all, though the user interface gave the illusion that it was.
---
Will pay you for those, on Xbox
---
Ok I'll try checking back after I level some more thanks!
---
&gt;Ok. Well then don’t. But that’s usually the way to do it. Do you actually think they don’t track disconnects and such??? I’m sure they do. It might shock you to know that someone just disconnecting isn’t a lot of information.
---
They can and should track a lot more than just "disconnects", like where you were, what you were wearing, what you were carrying, enemy's you were in, etc.
---
Fuck off with your apolgism. 
---
It's because they never put any incentive in there. DayZ has the incentive of taking other people's stuff and having rare loot and Rust has actual competition on servers. Fo76 gets nothing from being online.
---
Please go be toxic somewhere else you aren't wanted here
---
Not every is CTD, but allot of people who use the targetting hud do.
---
Bummed.
---
I got 2 trophies to complete then I'll be back after something changes
---
Ya...so do I. But you still need the 8 code pieces to set the nuke off. I have those 8 keycards but I do not have the main nuclear keycard you get from the cargo bit.
---
Tyvm for the speedy response!
---
They exist. Had a vampire one before the game ate it.
---
&gt; But you still need the 8 code pieces to set the nuke off
---
No you don't.  
---
PC, my apologies.
---
Even if the new characters didn’t add depth to the story, it would be more immersive to run across 1 or 2 at a campsite out in the wastes. Could even add them so you could recruit them to your settlement for the price of defending it and “tending” to crops like they did in FO4. Just make them un-killable once they’re claimed where they can be downed and can’t fight back anymore but their health regens mic enemies are dealt with 
---
Same here. Picked up and read well over 20 and I still haven’t gotten it. Pretty sure I’ve also hacked over 50 terminals too
---
I would rather them iron out and the links and fully flesh out the additions they bring to the game, instead of rushing them to beat other games releases.
---
Lest we forget the state the game launched in...
---
We've enjoyed the absolute hell out of 76 so your assumption is funny, the game is fun as is, but open pvp worlds will just make it that much more fun for those that want it, I promise we are out there.
---
I think it’s broken, I hope this issue gets addressed 
---
New chars only for survival mode, i can literally hear the duping merchants cackling in glee at the announcement that they can further profit off of the glitch.
---
No developer should ever consider putting players on uneven playing fields its just dumb.
---
Hmm, not even sure what to think of that. Only 6.8% completed scorched earth .-. Looks like there's a massive skew in here somewhere, but I guess I must have been wrong since even accounting for the people who played a few days and stopped, it can't be more than 5-10% who like PvP with stats like that
---
Don't listen to these nay sayers, I've been building my character this entire time, since launch, for PVP. These people just want nobody to be ahead of them, I've earned my gear. I should be able to use it. Please don't make all of my progress mean nothing. You're already punishing the whole player base with the upcoming nerfs, because of the actions of exploiters. Don't punish the legitimate players that just wanted this mode from the start!
---
Hm, you learn something new every day!
---
Huh. I guess I found out about it when they patched it for workshops. You can be as pedantic as you want but the fact that PvP exists is proof in itself that it’s part of the game. Fact: You purchased this game knowing that PvP was part of it. If you somehow didn’t know, despite it being very clear in the advertisements, then that’s on you. Whining about it after the fact is just silly. 
---
I can’t find shit right now unfortunately because every article is crapping itself over the new “survival” PvP mode and I honestly don’t care enough to try harder. If you wanna take that as a victory go for it. I have better things to do than listen to someone complaining because the game has PvP as clearly advertised. 
---
Yes its asked here alot and i will always agree 100%. We should be able to almost have our circles touching. So we can make little towns in our clans and be close to mates. 
---
That... that's not how anything actually works. The burden of proof is on you for the original claim.
---
Pve players wont touch it.
---
Pvp players will get bored and go off to better PVP games in a month.
---
Wasted fucking dev time. For a game that's already a shit show.
---
Yeah, I turned on Shadowplay after the second time. If it happens again you can bet your ass I'm going to have proof of it.
---
No problem at all 
---
Used excavator today and didn't crash once...
---
My T60 had the hud and I crash a fucking ton in it
---
This seems like a solid compromise. It would probably be smart to allow the quests to be done again so new gear/caps could be acquired. 
---
Every time i see cream i feel like its wasted potential ,,, one could have an Ice Cream parlour Camp or a Bakery Shop Camp , like Slocum Joe...
---
The variety in the type of Camps / trader players we would see would be a nice added bonus too
---
I'll say they are making it easier on me that's for sure.
---
I didn't get fo76 to pvp so a couple months of dev time and beta for something with zero appeal is solid push away from the game.
---
Guys if you complain then Bethesda won't want to make another game like this, remember?! 
---
I'd agree but I just hit 100 and I'm pretty much out of shit to do.  Last 15 SBQ runs have gotten me explosive vents 15 times.  Not really feeling the grind at all because of the loot tables 
---
Would be nice to run power between camps.. but don't think that will happen. 
---
hows about mods support!?
---
Maybe just don't play the pvp mode if you don't have the gear. Simple. Why should others be handicapped to your level? I earned my gear, I built my character FOR pvp. This is how I wanted the servers to be from the beginning. Now the whiners who hate pvp because they can't hang, are trying to shape the PVP mode. Makes me sick. Just stay in standard mode if you're afraid of being overpowered by any other players.
---
Where does that come from? That wasn't a problem even back in the days of *Ultima Online*.
---
What is this survival mode? Can someone tell me?
---
1h melee is viable and has its place. The cultist dagger is the fastest weapon in the game and a 3 star machete becomes a 4 star machete when you add the sacrificial blade mod. Min/max is cancer. 
---
Fireproof 3 reduces explosive damage. 45%.
---
Dense chest mod further reduces explosive damage.
---
There's also cavalier/assassins layered on top
---
A very very good comprise OP this has the potential to make all happy but those that bought gear for the sole intent to kill others.
---
A true pvper should love this idea and luckily for is pve players this means the servers have a good chance of surviving long term for pvp players.
---
Maybe with luck it can. :)
---
It's harder if you're alone.  If all you have is a hunting rifle and a pipe revolver, don't try it unless you have another player backing you up.
---
Their attacks have high splash damage and can penetrate cover, but thick enough cover can still protect you.  Sometimes they'll just  rapidly attack with no  end.  Wearing any sort of power  armor will  increase your survivability a lot.
---
Even if you don't have good shooting  weapons,  if you  have  like  6 or so plasma grenades, you can very  easily kill a scorchbeast  if it lands.  Literally throw  every  explosive you have at it, and even a low level can come out on top  if they've saved enough strong grenades and  wait  long enough until one decides to land.
---
Disable the explosive and sentinel effects. problem solved.
---
if i ever see someone with a bounty like this look out cause im coming for those there caps buddy.
---
Griefers don’t want an even playing field. Griefers can only have fun when they are forcing someone into PvP who doesn’t want to PvP. 
---
The single-best item on this diary, definitely. \o/
---
I was contemplating just getting the mod; glad to see it'll soon become unnecessary either way!
---
And people who don't appreciate PVP for what it is, and complain about their camp destruction etc... Have NO place deciding ANYTHING for this mode.
---
If what OP said really happens, that’s the end of this game for me. 😢 
---
Launched my last nuke for awhile today. It’s been great fun, but time to move on until the new stuff comes out. I hear there’s other games out there!
---
The only thing I have worth trading is what I need the ammo for. Looking for cash?
---
The enemies are programmed to only shoot you in the torso or limbs.
---
That’s kinda funny and spooky at the same time lol. 
---
Survival mode ?
---
They absolutely need to change Adventure to have a total PvP opt-out except in Workshops once Survival comes out.  If PvPers get what they want why can’t non-PvPers also.
---
Time will tell.
---
Anthem and division 2 just got alot more appealing for alot of ppl.
---
Pve content seems to be at a full stop for this game and many ppl ran out of stuff to do before xmas.
---
Pvp is needed for longevity. Any game with pvp, or some type of competitive mode, lasts alot longer than without.
---
Hm. Interesting. I'll have to test some things tonight. Thanks for the info!
---
What did they lose? 
---
How much you looking for and spending?
---
They'd have to get rid of incisor too in that case. Or, god forbid, balance the weapons properly
---
lol hilarious why would you think that its first come first serve with regards to loot.
---
Everyone gets there own loot pool as long as you do some form of damage to the enemy.
---
No one can just come and take your guns/armour/meds all people can take is junk if and when you die :).
---
I rush the leveling and gear obtaining, then I go back through and enjoy the game, also since enemies tend to scale, it isn't any less difficult. Well maybe because I have a TSE lever and a full sentinel assassin set :D
---
“Cheese making thingie”
---
😂😂😂
---
I think they took the feedback of "PvP has too many restrictions" from Day 1 and that's why they're making this.
---
Can we do that tomorrow night at 9 eastern time. Or 2:30
---
Pete Hines said before launch that the private servers would still be on Bethesda's servers
---
We'll have to see if that's still the plan or if they're going to change their minds
---
He's wearing a wedding ring, too. Never underestimate the power of a snazzy hat.
---
Nice, I'm so happy to hear that I was onto something with this. I wasn't sure if everyone would be taken back by the idea.
---
We need the pvp server to be a sucess to keep them happy. While we focus on the co-op side of the game.  They can roleplay that the vault was full of serial killers while we focus on the roleplay of rebuilding America and stopping the plague.
---
Same here, I had a bathtub full of them too.
---
They are dragonborn
---
The event is called Patrol Duty which give you a weapon plan as a reward which can include the Handmade Rifle Plan regardless what your level is.
---
It happens at the Eastern Regional Penitentiary:
---
https://m.au.ign.com/wikis/fallout-76/Eastern_Regional_Penitentiary
---
Do the event, if you don't like the plan you got or want more just server hop and do it again. I didn't know about the event before, I was just doing some events with a random guy who was after the handmade plans. He got it on the 3rd time he did the event (we just did one straight after another).
---
I'd say they are all on the low side but not by much due to bugs.
---
One of the lowest is hack 50 terminals at 2.1% but that is tracked per character.
---
Then again 6% did i am become death.
---
To put it simply shit tonnes of ppl abandoned the game a long time ago 
---
Movement speed -100%
---
Omg I used to have a base at the Junk Resource spawn right next to you before I moved to the mountains. I left a paper bag full of random ammo I didn’t need in your garage once. Lovely home though! 
---
Well, I've been building my Character for pvp. I KNEW they were eventually adding something like this, and now I hope all my grinding and hard work aren't undermined because of people, who don't want anything to do with pvp in the first place, complaining that people are going to be stronger than them. STAY IN STANDARD MODE IF YOU CAN'T HANG WITH THE BIG BOYS.
---
its not free to play...
---
stores take stock off shelves all the time when said item isnt selling well.
---
All stock will be held and re stocked when the game is more popular. common tactic in games shops.
---
Also will re stock on big days like public holidays easter so on and so forth :).
---
First Bethesda giveth...
---
As a console player, I was fucked.
---
Literally made a spreadsheet this morning with every item on that imgur post of all camp items and ran through my CAMP to see what I had unlocked and what I hadn't.
---
Then they publish the Inside the Vault hahah 
---
I thought I was experiencing something similar. I've had issues where their loot would take forever to load. It would just be stuck on the loading icon, then once the server caught up it would eventually be loaded in. Sometimes minutes later after I went to a different part of the zone and came back. Could be that?
---
I have some plans I'll sell it for the 350 caps and some shotgun shells at 3 PM eastern time
---
Hey... that's not true, there's also the tattered mole head which gives a whopping +1 DR
---
No, they didn't say they're opening the vaults soon.
---
Weapon balance is a shit show and now pvp is being pushed.
---
Imo this is the last straw for alot of ppl.
---
Anthem and division 2 are getting free advertising 
---
Perfect👌. See you tomorrow. What’s your gamer tag 
---
nice little camp!
---
Couldn't agree more.
---
OP 
---
It’s a lot of fun.  The game is extremely complex so honestly, I don’t mind some crashes.  It’s annoying, but honestly I’ve seen so much worse.  
---
In my view, Bethesda had no choice but to release when they did.  That’s because they sold their promotions to so many other players they would get their asses sued to the Stone Age.  At some point they were committed to the release date- do or die.  
---
I love this FO universe and this is the first I’ve ever played an online game. 
---
Looney toons style 
---
Zetsubou Pro
---
Agree, I’m all pve and will never touch it. I imagine that is a large part of the Fallout player base as well. 
---
I am confused by your position. You say they are wasting time doing Survival, but you end by saying make PvE and PvP servers...that's what Survival mode is...
---
is it a plasma gun mod? that's not for the gatling
---
*May the ~~most loaded duper~~ best player win*
---
The going rate for regular ammo is .50 per 100, so 1 each hundred? Not really sure what would be appropriate
---
I looted the ring and its hat fell off. I felt bad for stealing from Sir Roachington. 
---
Oooh... maybe it's a bait n switch?
---
These dupers ALL go onto the servers, Beth has a quick looksie into their inventory...
---
Nek minnit, ban hammer?
---
" I'm not a programmer "
---
Neither are the Beth devs. 
---
The levelled lists for vendors (plans, weapons, etc.) are still broken.
---
The UI is still an insult.
---
Mods in your inventory will still be scrapped.
---
The legendary RNG is still a joke.
---
Scorchbeasts are still an annoying waste of ammo with no rewards.
---
Some events are still not firing correctly.
---
The PVP system is incredibly dumb.
---
How is it even possible to not fucking patch most of these things within a week? The game is out since 3 month and all we get all the time is either "we want to improve communications" or "we'll release a patch the may or may not fix something."
---
You people need to stop cutting Bethesda any kind of slack and hold them responsible for the poor state of the game. 
---
I agree 
---
I can see the benefits in both. I’d probably make a new character just because I would make it different. But being able to switch could mean that adventure is like the staging ground for being in survival 
---
100% on the ball.  I give the new mode five months of lifespan before it tanks.  The time and money invested should have been channeled into PVE.
---
It's not a game mode made for PvE people, that's pretty obvious. It's a method of getting the pvp players to stop harassing others and to mess with each other. This in NO WAY AT ALL is suited for fortnite or PUBG fans, not even close. That is a terrible comparison and its embarrassing that you would even attempt it. You have no idea why they are doing this do you? To give you entitled littles babies the break you whine for so much. To get the pvp harassers off your back yet look at you, you're complaining about it already. You want an immersive pve experience and this mode is an aid to help you do that by removing the troll pvp players that keep preying on you weak little children. Grow up or play another game
---
[For those confused.](https://knowyourmeme.com/news/heres-to-loss-the-internets-greatest-meme) 
---
My repost: 
---
I would guess it came from above and i am sure once they see the survival mode player count against the adventure mode count it will change alot. We do have vaults we know are comming.  But hopefully after most of the work will be focused on bringing more pve content and end game activities pve side and more co-op. Its not like the lore of 76 really supports the idea of pvp anyway it is more of a addon. The best and brighest chosen to rebuild America. Not serial killers that were able to hold off aggression against one another for 20 years and now murder one another.
---
I didn't mean you. I was agreeing with you. Sorry if that came off wrong.
---
I don't see why people who won't play Survival are complaining about it. It's easy, don't play it and wait for Vaults to open up and more content. 
---
Why can I track down nuka cola paint for T51b and BoS paint for T60 if I’m not supposed to be able to flaunt it!
---
In all seriousness, the loot drops are *terrible* and it’s very difficult to find specific pieces you’re looking for even when you’re frequenting the trading subs. 
---
Player vending and a trading hub would help, but the way the game is designed lends itself to this behavior. 
---
....No offence OP buy that is a really stupid argument. Of course Fallout had always been a PvE expierence. *Up until now it hasn't had multiplayer.*
---
 I wish we had a truly modular weapon system.  The current one is weird.
---
Nice! 
---
I can’t decide where to move my camp to. It’s in a bad spot at the moment and rather spartan lol
---
I’ve got a lot to learn.  I’m unsure if the pink casket bed is wonderfully cheesy or beyond dumb lol 
---
Yes yes taking the brown paper bags is important
---
I really dislike the female hairstyles, and I'm so tired of using "The Nora" for all of my characters.  Why do all of the hairstyles have to look like they were done with hedge trimmers in a windstorm or someone's blind great grandmother?  There are hair brushes all over the place, so it's not like I can't find one to use now and then.
---
It might be the post apocalypse, but I'm still high maintenance and vain about my appearance!  Can't catch a handsome BoS's eye when I look like my hair dresser is a drunken Mr. Gutsy on the fritz.
---
A simple, sleek ponytail or braid... timeless looks.
---
Yeah i sae the same , very cool
---
Exactly 
---
So don't play survival mode. It's optional.
---
No legendary. It's SURVIVAL. The entire idea is that this mode is a soul sucker, something that makes you pull your hair out at how tedious and crazy it is!
---
The ones who WANT to play in a good survival simulator will understand and hopefully appreciate this mechanic.
---
Lol.  Never seen that rate scale below.  Regular is 2 per cap and 1 per 2 caps for ultracite.   However,  buy me a power station plan and they are yours.
---
Oh I know it came from above. I get that. 
---
Still a waste of time.
---
"Reap what you sow" is a perfect quote fot what the dupers have done to the game economy and play through.
---
I have my passive mode on and anyone that attacks me (rarely happens) is blocked for the session immediately. Since that, it rarely allows anyone to kill me. I dislike pvp. I am a sole PvE player in all my games. I literally got this to co op FO76 with friends
---
Wow, thanks for the random ammo and the compliment!
---
I chuckle every time I kill a bee swarm with a hunting rifle. 
---
Fyi, you've been reported.
---
Thanks for proving that our desire not to share our free time with you was 100% justified.
---
Very nice.
---
Deal. Be on tomorrow evening?
---
Hoping that once they see that most of the player base is more on the pve side they will focus almost entirely on it.
---
You're equating PvP with griefing. I hate that anyone who engages in PvP in this game is called a "griefer". If Bethesda didn't want any PvP going on, they would put everyone on passive mode. People who abuse the Wanted mechanic by teaming up with friends to spot with them, and/or people who chase lowbies around the map, killing the same players over and over again, and just aiming to wreck their enjoyment are griefers. Google even defines it that way. Not everyone who engages in PvP aims to just troll people. They are playing the game how they want to.
---
The survive servers will eventually be on oar with adventure, do requiring new characters only delays that by a few days or weeks at best. I don't understand the logic here to require a new character.
---
Exactly! If people that want to PvP start playing Survival mode, guess who you will see more of? PvE players! 
---
One is a mode requiring lots of time.
---
The other is a couple of toggles.
---
I don't know why people are acting as if that's the only new content coming up when Bethesda said about a billion times "No, there's other stuff coming soon. Trademark."
---
This is where i build my camp
---
Thibbledorf Pwent? Now that's tickling me in a way only Salvatore can. Holy goddamn shit
---
This game is dead
---
No, fuck Bethesda. If they needed money they wouldn't have chanced it with the pre-order bags or draw us in with Todd Howard's beautiful speech about graphics and never knowing you were on a server.
---
Cheese thingy 😂😂😂
---
Oh I'm so scared. I'm not one of the pvp players if that's what you mean by "share our free time with you". I'm a pve player that knows how to defend themselves and avoid conflict. Too bad you cant say the same
---
Im lvl 210 and im still able to see it sometimes on watoga vendors 
---
If all they did was simply make it constantly PvP with no incentive, the PvP players would get bored faster and go back to harassing people on PvE servers.  
---
Lol.  Maybe.  Get with me when you get on.  I should be.
---
Disagree. I've worked hard for my shit, the entire time since launch, with PVP in mind. My hard work and farming shouldn't be undermined because the people, who aren't even into pvp, (complaining about their camps destroyed, getting one shotted, etc.) are trying to shape the new pvp mode. Makes me fucking sick. If you don't trust Bethesda is doing a well enough job removing the exploiters, then your opinion is justified. If you think Bethesda knows what is going on better than complainers on here, then Survival mode should be how they want it.
---
My character is built for pvp, and I've awaited this mode. I wish the entire game was like this from the start.
---
Well now what would be the fun in that?
---
As far as I know, it does not. I have tested using both the Awareness perk and field tests against totally willing test subjects using a Flamer and Gatling Plasma, with and without Stabilized. Awareness showed only physical resistance was reduced, and damage field tests found the same number of shots to kill.
---
I should note that Awareness itself is not 100% reliable: guns with armor piercing effects from mods like Perforating Mags did not see a reduction in resistances, yet damage tests against my wonderful and totally insured and salaried victims- assistants, showed a difference where the guns with armor piercing mods really were dealing more damage.
---
It’s yet another piece of the “Energy weapons are bad” situation.
---
Cool. Account is the same as this.
---
Pole hook for me 
---
Good idea on a discussion. 
---
I am against a new character mostly because of my experience in another game (The Division) where I am a late to the game player and I have a lot of grinding to do to get my PvP build working against other players that have been looting and shooting for way longer than me.
---
Even though I am starting behind I enjoy every minute in PvP because I know the stakes are really high at the moment. I run and hide more than shoot at this point but one day soon my looting will pay off and I will run less. It is part of the experience. There will always be players better equipped than you with more free time to grind more loot. It is the PvP world.
---
I can go on about Titanfall or Titanfall 2, again late comer so I am killed often, but it is part of the PvP experience.
---
There is that.
---
But then, the harassers wont be content with fairer, riskier fights anyway.
---
&gt;more PVE content, and while I can’t spoil any details just yet, I will say that Survival mode won't be the only new content coming to Fallout 76 in March  
---
*offers love*
---
Already ruined? You dont even know all the details yet. They have said that people will drop more than just junk in this mode, if they make it so you have a chance to loot a weapon from them or armor piece from them, that could be a big deal when looking at what weapons and armor people are using, and tse is getting nerfed so it not like the tse weapons are going to be super op here, and when you think about what armor is gonna be used, a gamma gun is gonna be good here
---
I love the Mire.  Nobody is out there and its beautiful.   Do have a level 91 mob spawn near me, but other than that,  I haven't seen a soul.
---
How many tokens do you get per event
---
Exactly. People are just self entitled crybabies. Just because you don't like a certain mode doesn't mean they shouldn't have it at all. I am looking forward to it to mess with 1 or 2 days a week for a different challenge! 
---
Many
---
Put everything in your stash, then go back and craft it
---
You know if you didn't word this like a little twat, Bethesda might have listened. 
---
Ok thanks
---
People that want to bully others don't go after people they think can fight back.
---
Yeah... you're wrong!
---
Dude, tse is getting nerfed, its not gonna be ridiculously op anymore, and if your using assasin’s gear, the doggy perk, and the fireproof perk, you are gonna reduce damage a lot
---
" and while I can’t spoil any details just yet "
---
This is the problem right here. Whenever the CMs post anything or the new "Inside the Vault" comes out it's always "We'll release something that fixes something at some point in time."  
---
This game has huge issues that need to be adressed asap, not at some point in the near future. The communication from Beth down to the playerbase is ,despite promises to be improved, hot garbage and the sooner people realize this, the better. 
---
I mean it's their game and their choice but I think they're crazy for opening that can of worms... They are literally decades behind the competition in terms of a polished pvp experience. 
---
It just seems like a very odd choice considering the game is poised to be a very good addition to the pve genre which is critically under populated... All those games are either mmos or single player and they had a real chance to dominate that genre... 
---
But yeah picking a hopeless fight with fortnite is an option too... Good luck with that lol
---
I wouldn't even mind characters bringing levels and perks over, but the gear advantage is significant. You simply can't get top tier equipment in a reasonable enough time frame to start over in pvp and be relevant compared to someone who simply moves their fully kitted char over who can't be killed and has a lethal radius of the render range.
---
Unless Bethesda starts every new character created in pvp mode with full sentinel assassin armor and a top tier legendary brotherhood recon rifle then there is no real way for a level 1 to make their way out into the world without some serious matchmaking to ensure only new pvp characters are put into a server, or some other restriction that stops the power difference between haves and have nots killing the pvp aspect on arrival. 
---
"it just works" 
---
Probavly because they aren't ready to go to deep into them yet. The survival mode is a really simple and easu change so it makes sense for them to talk about it fairly soon after announcing it. Player Vending and Faction PvP require much more thought on how to implement and balance and they probably won't talk about them till yhey have more concrete ideas on them
---
I support a survival mode for people who want. I also support more PVE-tilted servers w/ more focus on rebuilding.
---
It is crazy to me.  Is there not a producer or designer who just has to be sick with how badly the game launched and all the shit storm around it? Wouldn't that person just be going NUTS to make things right? 
---
So much amazing effort was put into the game (art, creature design, location design, music, and more) but its being sunk by bugs, rushed ideas, and poor decisions. Where is the PASSION from the producer or main designer who is in charge of this game? Maybe they don't exist, but its hard to fathom they've done all of this work without one. 
---
The CORE of the game is really great, and a co-op or multiplayer experience is all I've ever wanted in a Fallout game, but they are just dropping the ball on what I would consider to be the "easy" stuff to fix or design well. Get 10 people who love Fallout games for all different reasons together and you can hammer out these systems in a week that everyone can enjoy. 
---
And my proof is in my experience, of over 700 hours of gameplay and hundreds of player encounters. Can you provide a more substantial sample size? I doubt it
---
Where have they said that?
---
Honestly, they mentioned the pvp mode before xmas. I've heard nothing about new pve content. 
---
There are only 6 "Journal" entries from the Overseer. Like Ulgroth said, if you pull up the Challenges menu it lists how many are out there. We have 17 different "Logs" to find, but those are Main Quest related. The "Journals" are just her own, personal thoughts but once she finds Evan and asks us to kill him, that's the end of those entries. From that point forward, she's lost her home, family, and fiance, and just wants to find the Nukes and wipe out the Scorched.
---
Let us decide that then? If someone's hair clips I'm sure they'll either change the hair style or put on the hood. It isn't game breaking.
---
One reason: appease influencers
---
Ouch. Bad design decisions 
---
Nice, thank you! Actually been needing the handmade plan, being level 104 I have apparently missed my chance with the vendors. 
---
you need both gunsmith and a energy weapon perks
---
Grasping at straws. My entire group of friends has wanted an open pvp mode for this game since BETA. Just because you don't want it doesn't mean others don't. 
---
It also happens if you have perks that reduce crafting costs.
---
3.7% of ps4 players have killed 20 ppl.
---
I'm in disbelief at who they think plays there game.
---
THank you! That solved it.
---
I searched through the whole building. Couldn't find it. Might be a random spawn.
---
I’m not at all complaining about pvp and I do frequently PvP when I find the need such as destroying lifeless griefers. My complaint is the prioritization of adding PvP content, content that seems a bit loftier in size compared to the new PvE content that has been hinted. 
---
Or, alternatively, do open your Pip-boy right after logging in for the novelty of seeing the date listed as January.
---
https://i.imgur.com/AnmwlVn.png
---
Whitesprings?
---
Agreed. I have zero interest in this ruleset, the current setup is enough pvp for me in a Fallout game. 
---
Sauce?
---
I think they want to tell us but are told from higher up not to
---
I’m not that high of a level but I could try
---
Ok so I completed the whole silo without the keycard but can’t progress so please tell me how I can get pass without the nuke keycard so I can put in the 8 digit code. 
---
No worries mate
---
The next game to get everyone complaining.
---
Exactly, so why would PvP be of any focus for new content this soon after release, when other more important changes need to take place such as improving stability and adding more endgame PvE content. Like you said, it’s never been multiplayer until now, so why such immediate emphasis on PvP?
---
That's what I was thinking on the Int thanks 
---
This is fascinating. In a horrifying, horrifying way. Why does it even need to spread?
---
Pwent is best dorf!
---
Thats what people will say. Have a high level friend and piggy back them
---
You need the keycard. You don't need the 8 code pieces.  
---
Huh, this could be. I recently installed it and have been crashing a TON.
---
Any chance VATS overlay does as well?
---
They are in the barrels. Aka the toxic waste was actually just the FEV victims from westek
---
Yes I have already acknowledged that I made a mistake. 
---
You’re the one reply to my comments, dumbass. 
---
The fact you are blaming it on other players is what shows you are ignorant. There are a few reasons, bad RNG, you didnt hit R to manually check (sometimes it doesnt show up unless you do this), you didnt hit it, servers lagging so its loading in and if you wait 5-10 mins itll load in (happens to me often in whitesprings) or it switched to another nearby corpse.
---
Why would you think other players are taking it lmfao.
---
I’m the highest level of my friends and I’m only level 25
---
I play on ps4 and the duping fix patch went live last Tuesday, a little behind PC but surely in place.  Just fyi. 
---
I'm going to have to check it out! I didn't start division 1 until last Aug so I was def a newb to the DZ 
---
They should just do what diablo 2 and 3 already do have survival as a season and when the season ends move them to adventure. And have a 3rd hardcore mode for one and dones. Other than seasons ending no transfer of characters.
---
Ok well what I’m asking for is the keycard. I completed the silo i’m at the end and need the keycard so I can set the nuke off.
---
Yeah, when the SBQ is killed on a server you're currently on, go take a look in the stash at Charlie.
---
They said they were adding leaderboards for PvP mode. That's probably the most telling thing.
---
Oh. Do events. Was good for me
---
K thanks
---
Only charlie?
---
Big gloves
---
I believe so.
---
Honestly, I enjoy it. Some people just take things way too seriously. Were there some bugs in the start yes, I didn't find anything game breaking or that prevented me from playing. I am enjoying exploring the huge landscape. Killing and hoarding everything I can find. If I see an area I can help someone with I do, if not I move on. Most of the time I am solo and treat it like other fallout games. Personally, I say if you are on the fence go for it, going in with low expectations is sometimes the best way to be pleasantly surprised. 
---
Finally, after scrapping some random piece of combat armor I found, a message popped up in the left corner of the screen that just said "BOS", and nothing else. Then when I looked at my helmet under the "Paint" category, there was the Brotherhood of Steel option. Well, I guess scrapping random combat armor is how you unlock the various helmet paints, as odd and counter-intuitive as it sounds. My quest is at an end. :)
---
Gotta love complete speculation about a mode which has only been teased and no one knows anything about yet.
---
Damn. What should be there and do i have to take part in queen? 
---
In another post about survival mode the community manager from Bethesda stated that the pvp addition is not the only thing in the works for the march patch. 
---
Definitely ambiguous but seemed like a hint hint wink wink pve addition is coming too.  Only time will tell
---
The damage gap eliminates variety late game. No crazy junkie with a tire iron. Why? The tire iron is an inferior weapon.
---
Am I? Or are you just too proud to admit that I'm right? Do you work for Bethesda? No? Then your guess is as good as mine, the only difference is I choose to see the big picture because I dont let tears cloud my vision. 
---
Nope, I didn't have to join in on the queen and I finished it.
---
I have put over 200 hours in and I have enjoyed it. I’ve had a good time with some friends. It used to be a nightly thing for us but now there’s no point. Especially with no content coming out for us to enjoy and the bugs not being fixed. 
---
I agree with you, sadly. I’ve had some great times with Bethesda but nothing they make moving forward will be a day one purchase again. Or even purchased for that matter. 
---
It's sad that those of us who enjoy modding the engine find issues that the creators couldn't...
---
Have you considered making a plugin for a fix in FO4, then forwarding it to Bethesda? (and releasing for users in FO4) 
---
Its not fixed...crashes often on every platform. 
---
You can craft them at the chem bench, it cost one of each stable flux 
---
That's hilarious if true. Source? 
---
Who says the fights will be fair? I would be willing to bet there will be griefers hanging out near Vault 76 waiting for people to come out wanting to try a new character for this new content. The ground around Vault 76 will be a bloody mess
---
I agree with the title of this post.
---
I've felt your pain. I did that the first time too. I just owned it and left. Came back a couple of weeks later to do it again. 
---
You are really saying this after the bag fiasco and the nuka rum bottle?
---
Surprised it took this long 
---
Two words.  Fort Night
---
Exactly, and not even months. Some people have more time to grind than others. It could be days even. Resetting will only work for current players. New players joining a few weeks later will still have the same problem.
---
Better they take it into account from the start and allow existing characters in. Other online games do it and it works but will require balancing over a long period.
---
Can’t the duper’s still have second alts etc and move the shotties to their low level alt?
---
Sentinel/Assassins + Fireproof + Dense mod + Dodgy. 
---
Beat ya some of that is also just mates clearing mates bounties. Too often when someone defends my camp from spawns they get tagged with a bounty lol.
---
Fortnight

Oh. Already have it. I have all 17 and all her personal tapes but still have quest 
---
For the non D3 players, there’s a Season mode where you make a fresh character and level up from scratch to earn potential Seasonal rewards. The character gets wiped when the Season ends. 
---
Agree with all of this. 
---
$$$ Fortnight $$$
---
Or make it work like The Division. You choose to go rogue based on the risk and reward and people start hunting you (Manhunters). You don't go rogue by accident.
---
It has been done and done well before.
---
Pvp players will enjoy it.  Griefers only enjoy screwing with people who don't want pvp.  They won't be playing a mode where anyone fights back.
---
Exactly. I have never played a Fallout until this one. And I've put a good bit of time into it. I just started playing part 4 this week. And I put about maybe 12 hours into it. And I feel myself gravitating back to 76 every time.
---
Nope. It's so bad that I'm literally giving away a tse minigun with reload speed. 
---
Id personally just like private servers to play the game solo. Im not into this whole online thing for fallout. I just want to build a huge town on some of the landscape.
---
Hm. It completed for me when I played the last one.
---

Wait, you can move that thing? \*suddenly tempted to reload 4\*
---
I'm sure people with three or four mule characters skews it some.
---
I got the atoms but quest didnt :(
---
I have an executioner’s explosive BP Pistol and it does 796 per shot and it’s not even a two shot. It’s bonkers
---
I'm too proud to admit you're right even though "your guess is as good as mine?"
---
That makes a lot of sense!
---
How tf is this supposed to be like fortnite and pubg? You do know other games exist that also have pvp on large maps? This is not a battle royale, they even said you can respawn at your camp and vault 76 on the survival mode. The only thing this server and fortnite will have in common are $15 skins. 
---
With that misguiding aside, I do wholeheartedly think this is a waste of time focusing on a secondary mode while the primary one that most people bought the game for is still unfinished and lacking content. The PvP in this game is purely there for the novelty experience, I don't think anybody actually bought the game ONLY for the PvP. 
---
Do you have a source on the shareholder thing? I've never seen that anywhere. 
---
Perhaps due to the connection to the creatures that are immune to the scorched plague being the fev it has a viral effect in passing on immunity 
---
Just farm super mutants like west tech if your on ps4 and me psn  darkdestory23 im level 98 and we can grind
---
Well, the character doesn’t get wiped. You can only player that character in the standard (non season modes) after the season you made the character in ends. At first I thought the idea was terrible but after giving it a shot it’s a very refreshing way to play the game. But, small steps. Hopefully Bethesda can understand the importance of fresh characters only in the new mode.
---
I played the game to level 59...it was enjoyable, but it doesn’t hide the fact that horrible and has no replay value at all...the end game is a joke. It’s not called being toxic, it’s called having an opinion. Don’t get so butthurt about the game you’re trying to hard to defend.
---
Not unless they bought the game on another account just to have mules
---
Its crazy.
---
I got 2 trophies left, revives and kills, and i have zero drive to even focus on them.
---
I'm in pacifist mode always, i haven't captured a workshop in close to 100 hours or more.
---
The last time i killed somebody was to help out a low level because they went wanted accidently.
---
When I get on in a couple hours I'll throw you a couple key cards
---
You're right, poor choice of wording. I was just trying to fluff it up for you so I didn't hurt your fragile little feelings
---
Strange, we run it on 4 xbox 1's at two different households without issues. And we live in the boonies using 4GLTE hotspots...never had an issue since full release with it "crashing". Well excluding scorched beast fights with 20 people all using TSE weapons they somehow "found" at level 30.
---
I still use a level 35 powerful auto handmade. It does 67 damage per shot compared to a level 50 powerful auto assault rifle that does 55. Someone figure that one out :O
---
I'm for wasting time in this.
---
I can deal with the in game glitches and crashes that will probably disappear with the PvP dupers.
---
I can't deal with awesome legendary weapons, that people spend countless hours grinding for, being nerfed because of the cry baby PvP players. It's been known since the the introduction if Call Of Duty that PvP players are toxic. PvP should never have been included in an RPG.
---
I think each time should have a unique "boss" that spawns in the event of a nuke dropping.
---
Similar to the various zone monsters that randomly spawn. 
---
I agree. Do I have a PvP build?no. Will I be killed often in the beginning?yes.
---
A reset will only benefit the players in the game today. New players a month later will still be at a disadvantage. That is how PvP works.
---
You guys must have scripts or something with how predictably you parrot each other.
---
I don't personally expect many are in it for the pvp, but according to those stats, 50% of everyone who have killed the SBQ have enough player kills to say they've given it a solid shot.
---
Then again, 12% of all players never even left vault 76?
---
&gt; I just realized this, what the hell are they thinking? They need to get it out ASAP 
---
That was the problem the last time. I don't think following that path is going to all that good for them.
---
&gt; sales haven't been excellent
---
Source?
---
Hey if u are still interested i would be so happy if u could make on for me... my gt is zacharlen871229
---
I think the real problem is not that we have to equip power armor for nuke zones, but that we don't have adequate space in our Stash to store the power armor we need to save up for nuke zones. Also, we don't have adequate SPECIAL and Perk card slots available to be able to switch to a build focused on power armor effectiveness just when we want to do a nuke zone.
---
If we had a different leveling system, and more stash space, we could easily save a suit or two of power armor for nuke zones only - and have the necessary skills to use it effectively.
---
Wow. You make such a compelling argument! 
---
Hold on. Let me rethink my position!
---
/S
---
YES. No PvP mode. No PvP servers. We want PvP ZONES with good rewards and loot!
---
Imo they'll be in trouble if they force rolling new characters.
---
Ppl have a hard time abandoning all their gear and playing the game again.
---
I don't suppose you've actually documented any of this? Or is this just word of mouth and assumptions? 
---
I have 1 apparent bug and 2 suggestions for improvement.
---
Bug: Gatling Plasma seems to need reloaded quite often after pulling it back out, even if it had 100+ shots ready to go when you last put it away. (Also, not a bug, but its durability is ridiculously low, especially for a heavy weapon that takes up precious weight.)
---
Suggestion 1: Beating a dead horse I'm sure, but the stash limit is really killing the experience for me. I spend on average 45 to 60 minutes on heavy play days painstakingly going through my stash and inventory trying to find things to get rid of. On top of this, it can be difficult to find vendors with enough caps to at least get something out of the items you choose to let go. If it's an issue of having huge stashes effecting stability, I would recommend reducing weight on most items by 10 to 25%. 
---
Suggestion 2: Power armor should completely eliminate the possibility of disease. Or at least reduce it to say, 5 or 10% chance. It really breaks immersion when I'm going through the forest in a mobile tank suit and tic gives me parasites by biting me in the leg... huh? Also, I understand that power armor, especially in an online game, cant be 100% lore accurate. That would be ridiculous lol. But certain projectile sound effects don't even sound like they are hitting armor, it's like the bullets pass right through. (Talking about the sounds, not DR. As stated above we obviously cant have accurate power armor.)
---
I, uh, just don't think you know what a game's engine is.
---
Roses are red, Excavator is yellow.
---
Log off and back for 100 extra carry fellow.
---
90% of the time it would be me firing at something too close, and the TSE shotgun causing the death. 
---
Trying to do any group pve will be a shit show. Imagine trying to take on the Queen if everyone can damage everyone else. Even if you were all working together it would be hard to not blow each other up.
---
Same here.
---
I just assumed more tapes would be added later on.
---
Like in DLC.
---
I said it before. It feels like the people responsible for game design in the Fo76 team DO NOT play games at all. So many little things that are clearly bad ideas that it isn't even funny.
---
It has been like this ever since the game shipped out. Stuff like no push to talk, no fov sliders, bad monster spawn system, seeing other players on the map...
---
Just a bunch of little details that they shouldn't need feedback for at this day and age. Just common sense.
---
The second I was able to drop a CAMP way back in BETA I was devastated by the fact that my brother couldn’t plop his down next to mine so we could create a Wasteland rest stop.  
---
I understand the limitations but Man was that a let down.
---
Starting to get Seuss-ian here.
---
Buying them from vendors, treasure maps and workshops. 
---
Mostly buying them, I tend to get a lot of duplicates from random drops. 
---
Scorchbeast queen revives?
---
That's what i think
---
The max is still 25k caps. Within a month of playing I got close to hitting it. Eventually you’ll have bought everything you want and then hit the limit and then not know what to do other than just dropping everything 
---
Find a friend that will let you shoot them in the face many times.
---
Oh, it counts accounts and not characters then. I see.
---

---
I have a crazy idea... what if we made it so that VATS doesn't work against players in PVP servers.
---
This would make PVP fights much more skill-based, rather than just "who can lock onto a headshot and fire first with their overpowered legendary weapon" fight.
---
Feedback: scorchbeasts should never ever ever ever etc, spawn away from rifts. It's just terrible design that they do. I shouldn't spawn with one on top of me and instantly die. It makes me want to quit playing, and I'm one of the people who actually really like the game. 
---
As dumb as it sounds I don’t care about money. I am on disability and even with those checks I average $1k a month. Well over half of that goes to bills and some to food and whatever little is left is fun times. That said I’m extremely content with what I have. I don’t want a super car but I wouldn’t say no if someone gave me one. I won’t go out of my way to get something I don’t need but I’d gladly try to save something that means a lot to me. Sure there are people who like the game as is. Most people on this reddit probably are in that group so probably will disagree with me. But I’d rather give it to someone who won’t be so greedy with it like Bethesda has been. They released it unfinished and threw merch and microtransactions left and right to try and make money off this game. I’d like to see this franchise end on a high note instead of being killed of like ea has a tendency of doing. And don’t say Bethesda doesn’t do that. This game LITERALLY beat out No Mans Sky for worst launch
---
The fact you assume others are ignorant prove that you are ignorant. If you actually read you would know why I am blaming other players. Because the only time I do not get loot from creatures I kill, is when other players trot along after I killed the creatures and there is no loot, but when no other player is around, the loot shows up. 
---
I am caught between being upset at the loss of immersion and understanding that Bethesda made a Fallout MMORPG (kind of) so certain things were sacrificed in the interest of FO76 being what it is. Also they couldn't take our hard earned caps for new hair styles then have them covered up by helmets so we could have a bit more DR, how else could they micro-transact us ;)
---
That's what Prime receivers are supposedly for. 
---
One time I was kind of idling at the golf club and a bunch of times low levels would come the mobs would be higher level and they would get wrecked. So maybe hang out around there.
---
Have a friend jump off a cliff ...repeatedly 
---
I love fallout and hate ea but honestly I am so looking forward to anthem because of the content and server crashes
---
Downsides? Tell me exactly what is the downside when you have Class freak maxed?
---
\^ What they said.
---
Get a friend to jump off a cliff and then revive him and repeat.
---
I didn’t know that thinks for letting me know. I’ll try that
---
Factions are a pre-planned DLC release. Honestly just think it's meant to coincide with that. It's not perfect yet so it's introduced separately as a BETA. Should go hand in hand though.
---
A better argument than you and the OP are making. Go back your bridge, or are you afraid a pvp player will find you there? You're upset that you dont have a safe zone arent you? Sowwy cupcake
---
Get some friends that suck at this game.
---
You can get one shot by a weapon that isn't even legendary without any bobbleheads. Crazy right? Almost as if they are just making stuff really complicated to one shot with 5 million damage when a few hundred sneak headshot will do the trick.
---
can the 3rd server also be full of spiders, like, nothing but spiders and dupes?
---
Pretty sure theyre just gping to stick in the mod. Thats what their lazy asses did for widescreen and its still wonky.
---
Got T-51 plans from a Mire treasure map today.  The one under the bridge south of the dam.  But, I don't think that matters.
---
That's not a very accurate statistic to base your argument off of. They could have 1000 people with that trophy but that doesnt account for the tens of thousands that have less than 20 kills
---
I wear a 3X glove for riding, trust me I know.

---
I'd trade 10 pvp betas for one player vending machine.
---
I live within a short walk to Whitespring, and run up and down from the mire to Watoga after snagging a workshop in that area. I am level 140ish. I participate in every nuke zone and have been playing since beta. I routinely drop hundreds to thousands of rounds of .308. I use 10mm, 5.56 and .44 like no tomorrow and still usually have a stock of 2500+ of each. 
---
The reason I have so much .308 is because I have a steel and lead collection routine. I am parked on a lead node (sometimes steel nearby instead) and take Lakeside Cabins a lot for its access to Whitespring and convenience of 4 nearby vendors with different cap pools plus Grahm often passes by. I go to several key places with Super Mutants that make it rain .308 and caps while the extractors build their first payload of materials. It takes all of 15 minutes to clear the three locations and pick up absurd amounts of .308. The caps more than cover the fast travel costs and I come out ahead there, plus picking up all of the canisters, cans, wrenches, etc at the locations (and weapons from the enemies) nets me several hundred steel in a short time. It’s a daily routine to farm caps and materials before I head out to do whatever else. Taking Grafton and Munitions Factory are useless and slow to generate the amounts of materials I can grab in 15 minutes or so of clearing these three spots. 
---
I think the problem is people not actively trying to generate materials and ammo the most efficient way they can, and relying too heavily on one type of weapon/ammo. Of course if you never go hunt for .308 you’re going to run out. The same can be said for just about every ammo type. Earlier on I used a shotgun and hunting rifle; when I needed ammo I’d farm those locations and make a run through a couple of scorched or mole miner areas. If I didn’t do my daily routine yes I’d run out of ammo. Waiting on extractors and/or a factory to do the work for you is the long way. I recommend developing a daily routine to generate the materials and/or ammo you need as part of your farming technique. It’s the best piece of advice I took during beta and has proven to never let me down on supplies. I hunt the ammo and caps with a .44 that will one shot most enemies in these areas, so I don’t burn the ammo for my ‘main’ weapons doing so. Sometimes I just use All Rise, a weapon available to every high level player and use zero ammo.
---
I’m sure heavy weapons need a buff; that’s why I don’t really use them. That is not ‘the reason’ why people don’t have enough ammo though. It’s a combination of depending on one weapon, not efficiently generating resources in a game that revolves around the constant need to generate resources, and yes, *partially* unreasonably high consumption rates. 
---
It seems to be different on different servers.  Same session, if I "join" a friend on different server, it'll be better or worse.  So, even though it might crash locally, I have a suspicion that the issue is (at least partly) server side.
---
I know what you mean, I have seen it doing the loading thing. This is different, I have seen no drops, ect. The problem is when no other player is around there is loot, it is after I kill the ghoul or whatever other creature, get swarmed by a few more creatures/ghouls someone shows up while I am battling off the last few and when I go to the legendary or any other dead creature there is nothing but if there isn't a player around I always get loot. 
---
Of course not.
---
The only reason my stash is so full is because I can't actually get rid of stuff I don't need. I have thousands of ammo for guns I'll never use. If I could sell or scrap them: problem solved. Ditto legendary weapons and armor that don't fit my play style. If vendors actually had caps, or I could scrap things, my stash would be manageable. 
---
I think with the hitscan nature of the game, it would be very hard to alter it to allow collateral’s, it’s been the same for ballistic weapons since they started using this engine 700 years ago
---
There is armor piercing ammo. Not sure what caliber though. 
---
Because that's what people often want out of a multiplayer game. What I want to know is... why does it matter?  
---
It was probably the thing that some of the devs got done really fast. So they released it. Rather they just sit on it and not release it to give the perception that it was never finished?  
---
Like I feel like 3 devs could probably get this done faster than 12 devs working on story content could get their project done, just saying.
---
Seriously, if ever, I'm thinking it'll be around summer.
---
If they had something like that upcoming that might keep people playing through February, I'm pretty sure they would be talking it up by now (I know a lot of people get angry or dismissive about this, but if you look at trophies on console you get some sense of the huge share of players that have abandoned 76, and that matters a lot for this kind of game).
---
Players ran into the gaping pit of nothing to do way before they expected when they started playing, and so they (somewhat reasonably) think that "soon!" must mean the next patch, always the next patch, because the game clearly needs something, anything. But that's just fantasizing. I've said before, get used to this pace of things and scale of releases, good and bad, because there's no reason to expect a huge investment allowing BGS to do things faster.
---
I agree entirely with what you said except:
---
&gt;  if you think this game has no story go play Just Cause 4
---
That's a really terrible counter-point.    You might as well be comparing Fo76 to Chess.  The Just Cause series is built around ludicrous freeform destruction, gunplay and vehicles in an open world.  The story is all but irrelevant to the game's ability to entertain, which is hardly the case for Fallout.
---
Negative ghost rider. I had pacifist mode enabled and a dude one shotted me with a TSE shotgun. Don’t know how he did but it is possible.
---
Then make a new toon and level up.
---
Dupers will F you in the butt.  Unless you are a duper too.
---
I enjoy the PvP for what it is but by I'm pretty sure that I'll be done with the game by March.  That's a pretty great 5 month run on it, happy with my purchase.
---
I am in the not start over camp and for me it is because of my experience in The Division where they have a similar PvE and PvP approach and it works well.
---
Similar in the sense I grind with my Character in PvE and once I feel I have good enough gear I take that same character into PvP.
---
Also the PvP mechanism in The Division is good, won't say perfect but good. I never feel cheated when killed by other OP players and some days you get wrecked and other days you do the wrecking.
---
The Rogue vs Manhunter mechanic also works really well and yes you are invisible on the map so running and hiding is an option.
---
It could have some kind of intelligent design. Like if you're at a supply drop console, why not put the supply drop holotapes at the top of the list. Or a quest holotape, yeah top of the list. Makes sense.
---
It's clearly at this point that buggedthesda is run by idiots.The game is already a "survival mode" but i dont think they play their own game.
---
A mode to the mode.
---
I haven't bought anything from the Atomic Shop in quite a while... **Today that changes!** ... because I accidentally bought this with my fat finger slipped when I tabbed back into the game after making this. Can I get an F in the comments 😭
---
Anyways, I *am* American but I'm really not the most patriotic person in the game. I'm bummed that my 900 Atoms are gone but I'm really not *too* upset at the price this time. It's a simple design but it's a nice design.  I'm always a huge fan of new assets that aren't just simple recolors. 
---
I really hope that Bethesda doesn’t disappoint anyone, particularly the players who had stuck with 76 since release. Not a PvPer myself but respect anyone else’s gaming choices 😊
---
Same here!
---
Thanks. Now I know, and kinda wish I hadn’t. 
---
I did it in one go.
---
I assumed you need the Glassed Caverns part.
---
I can help if Xbox.
---
Yes! Do it, i bet its going to be chaos there, especially after the sbq goes down if she does.
---
You too can look like Evel Knievel!
---
As someone who can't play often, a few days into the beta will be the same for me. I'll still have my character at lvl 6 or whatever and everyone else will have theirs at 100. I mean, I agree with this post completely, but either way I'm going to be way behind everyone else. 
---
It was a joke I just beat the game 2 nights ago and was shocked when it was over because there was zero story driving my actions it was strictly the thrill of destruction.  And Just Cause 3 had a story multiple cut scenes and character interactions 4 was devoid of all of that.  It is actually a pretty fair comparison.  
---
I was alone, killing ghouls, no one else was there. I killed 2 legendary ghouls and as I was going to the bodies 4 charred ghouls came after me, I killed 3 of them someone else killed the 4th one and before I finished killing the last one that player ran over and obviously looted all ghouls. I went over and there was nothing. If it only happened once I would of figured it was a glitch. It happened 2 sessions. So that is why I hilariously think others are taking my loot from the dead ghouls. 
---
That's why they are separate servers grinding will be on reg server pvp will be on survival
---
How about just make holotapes that are quest related but haven't been utilized for a quest at the top?  
---
That's normal because new games are coming out and the stores need the space.
---
Not if their current plan of "respawn at 76 or camp when pvp'ed" remains. Can you imagine spending 10 minutes to go back to your goal, only to be killed 9 minutes in by a random yahoo? You have to leave some sort of escape mechanism, or you start getting into "I'm gonna screw with this guy for three hours and post it to my channel gimmie a like and here's my patreon" as a normal part of the gameplay experience, which is probably not a good idea to encourage at this time.
---
Limited to rail stations might work, or something similar.
---
Actually that's not a bad idea, having a "level cap" for entering PVP. Would definitely be a step in the right direction if they're doing this stupid character sharing thing between the modes. Say, you'd need to be level 50 before you could shift over. Tough enough and worldly enough that you're less likely to get instantly clobbered and with a full deck to play with. 
---
The irony.
---
It's a magazine.
---
The craftable kind on the weapon.
---
It resets when you stop or die almost to the very end, took me a few tries when I ran it. 
---
Treasure maps are also good for getting plans
---
I don't think there is and you won't always have the same OP characters on the map.
---
They could also match PvP players based on skill and level and gear.
---
The Division has something called Gear Score and that seems to work well enough. Legendary items have a better gear score than standard items etc.
---
They could match players in PvP based on something similar to gear score so all one shot players get paired up.
---
I will say something someone said before. I don't know if it;'s 100% accurate but it seemed like he had tested it some. There is some kind of hidden list of items you have collected. New things will spawn in if you collect a bunch of items. Can't remember the number maybe 40 or 8- somewhere around there maybe. But if you keep looking for just one item and not picking up a bunch of other items, then the list doesn't progress to respawn that item. Hope that makes some sense. So basically pick up a lot more stuff and then check back and see if what you're looking for is there.
---
Unfortunately I'm on PS4 or I would take you up on that.  I like the game and have been playing when I have time since the BETA.  still only level 27.  I will play a few hours but maybe every other week unfortunately. 
---
Never knew that.
---
Hmm you might just be right.
---
I don't know that this is the cause of most folks issues...but this is clearly an issue that needs addressing.  Solid work!
---
If I recall correctly, other combat armor paints used to work kinda bad with material mods, like the paint job just was beneath "shadowed" or "bos". I wonder if it's the same here?
---
&gt; Dear Bethesda, what we really need is not what we're asking for.
---
&lt;inserts list of stuff people are asking for&gt;
---
My advice.
---
Stay out of Cranberry till 35+, honestly 40.
---
The DMV quest suffers from the same bug. 
---
I agree with most of what you've said, especially your analysis of the rewards, the weapons, and the events.  It's clear that you've put a lot of thought into this and that you care about the game.  Even if I agreed with nothing, I would respect that.  
---
It's pretty cool but 900 caps for a limited time item is still insane. You should have the opportunity to grind for whatever. It shouldn't be buy it with cash or miss out.b
---
Hi, if you DC or die, all you need to do is go the second last beacon (on top of the bunker)
---
Hit the relay, then run through the cave to the end
---
**You do not have to do it all again if you die/dc/come back later**
---
Vats criticals always penetrate objects to hit the target
---
I like watoga myself
---
Because they don't understand their own game?
---
Unfortunately I'm on PC and still haven't gotten those myself :(
---
I like it, but BoS Combat for life!
---
They asked a lazy programmer to come up with a solution and got a lazy ass solution.
---
No ones talking about because it’s not a big deal. You guys just get over analytical about everything
---
I could have sworn they said it would likely be in the end of Jan update s but I guess Im remembering wrong or they spoke way too soon 
---
: ( tho ti would had been a good idea but guess not since every 1 has a duped wep any way
---
The town by Lakeside Cabins is good for caps, .308, and steel. Kill the super mutants there which are only level 5.
---
Then pop up to the lumberyard way northwest and kill all those super mutants, also level 5s. Tons of steel and other materials between the locations junk and their guns. Also lots of ammo and caps. 
---
Grafton has higher level mutants and may not be a net profit on ammo for you, but has tons of steel and caps in their weapons, junk, and cap drops. 
---
I hit these three locations daily. I net a good amount of caps even fast traveling to them, hundreds of steel, and wind up dropping hundreds of rounds of .308 between them. After you’ve done it a few times it takes all of 15 minutes (maybe 20)to blast through all of the locations in a speed run. 
---
So now I'm going to hold off on it!  Maybe I'll get there at this pace by the second DLC.
---
100% agree they should use a bunch of UO ideas as the basis for server. 
---
Please read what I wrote before providing lectures on information which is already obvious. The wasteland getting a 'little dangerous' comment, is ridiculous. The game provides that. We didn't pay for the game to have random strangers make up ways to harass us, otherwise we would have paid you or Bethesda would be paying you to harass other players and they wouldn't have created legitimate pvp within the game, along with a bounty system for unprovoked killing of other players.  If you don't like that, play another game, son.  
---
Lol I’ve only killed one person and that’s because he asked me to, to clear his bounty. I’ll never pvp in Fallout, they’re way behind the ball and lost on it, it awful. Wish they’d stick with what they’re good at and why most of us are here. 
---
Add me on PS4, I'll help you out. zombiemann77 
---
Protip: You don't HAVE to kill the big bastard at the end. You can sneak past it and loot what you need. 
---
I’m genuinely starting to believe that
---
Chance??
---
Is it not 100%?
---
I get it, the bottles correspond to the  lines that correspond to the characters in the meme. 
---
(Rant)This is why memes culture is fucking stupid, asinine inside jokey neckbeard shit evolves from it. " Loss" was not terrible but of course the internet especially the gaming community is full of sociopaths sooooo, laughter ensued.
---
Hey Devan first howdy my man!.
---
Something i have wondered about since starting the game and running into my first few bugs. Is why has Bethesda not given us an in game reporting system?. 
---
Most games do this and you would have a stream of feedback and bug reports are your finger tips every hour of every day.
---
Rather not have to go to the Bethesda website, log in and file a ticket every single time. Take for wow if i encounter a bug i simply open up the report system and click bug report. Give the name , location and bug details then click send.
---
Also good way to gain feedback as well. In wow i would come across something and go hmm that seems wrong or could use x instead. So i would click the report system and click feedback. Give what feedback i wanted then click send.
---
See what i mean.
---
I dont know why but when i first entered the mire i had a sort of feeling about the place, like as if i was constantly in danger or something. Fast forward like 20 or so levels and i have a camp with a bt extractor near harpers ferry. I love the mire's atmosphere by far my favorite map aesthetic 
---
I did read, but that doesnt change the fact you connected two unrelated things, which is not even possible to happen. You just have/had it in your mind other players are stealing loot from things you tagged, which is not possible. You also did = research on why this might be or would have come across what I mentioned as reasons which are mostly well known. That also means i did not ASSUME you are ignorant, I came to that conclusion by your choice of actions and thought process.
---
I bet nukes never get launched on the PvP servers.
---
PvP players have been leaning on PvE players so they could get legendary gear to dupe.
---
Dupers can only dupe. They still need access to the things that make duping worthwhile. I have these things. I have not duped ever. I have yet to be killed in pvp since I completed my BiS gear mongering.
---
You may finish later compared to those before you but judging a scale based on someone elses starting point when you didn't do anything during that time doesn't apply. Starting later has a lot of advantages, mainly learning from the mistakes of others. Not screwing up special points (or as badly) and getting your perk cards quicker because of that is just one of the many examples. You are basically saying It took you 15 hours to cook mac n cheese for dinner because I woke up at 5am, you woke up at 10am, then you started cooking at 7:30pm and finished at 8pm lol.
---
The amount of time and effort you need to put in to obtain the same level as those who started before you is a hell of a lot less. In my book that "difference" isn't a bad thing, its just an excuse for you to suck later.
---
I've never played the modern Fallouts.  To me, the real Fallout games were Fallout and Fallout 2.
---
If "Follow the Overseers Journey" isn't in your active side quest list, please post a picture of your pipboy.  
---
It's an old game engine which needs updating. This was a big problem on Fallout 4 too. All of your floors had twigs growing through them. 
---
There's a second reason VATS isn't very good on the 10mm SMG.   
---
I discovered this when adventuring with a Tommygun. 
---
VATS % is \*\*heavily\*\* influenced by your sights. The better the scope, the better the accuracy. In VATS, it doesn't matter where the gun actually points.   
---
What I do with combat and handmade rifles is strap a long range scope on top (for excellent VATS hit rate) and use barrel and stock to either both boost hip-fire, or one hip-fire and one recoil.   
---
That way for short range engagements I get pretty awesome accuracy (sub-1-square-centimeter reticle, around half a centimeter or the screen with the hip-fire perk) with zero zoom-in time, superb for twitch kills, while getting a near 100% hit rate in VATS, which effectively rips scorchbeasts in mid-air.  
---
Since the SMG's don't have scopes, their VATS hit rate, even if the AP cost was halved, would still be abysmal at any but point blank range.   
---
So... it's not a VATS weapon. It's a realtime FPS weapon.
---
Far as I have heard.
---
I got it, before I knew anything about it.
---
I probably wont get it since i usually wear pa and the enclave officer outfit outside of it
---
I bought the game to play PVE with my friends.  My friends stopped paying it due to the bugs and general shortcomings, and the PVE events are 90% empty every single time.
---
This won't bring me back.
---
World full, but thanks.
---
Bethesda responded to this, they said to fix it you need to put all junk inside your stash box
---
Well I have bod full heavy ledg set and I dislike the dark blue on it I wish it was black like shadowed but I just switched it over to the Patriot and still have my tankyness do need to work out a proper set of armor instead of random pieces but still looks nice need a combat helm though I had one then got rid of it before this and I regret it and hard to find one lol
---
I'll let you know when I find out. Accidentally bought this 😭
---
yes the mire is fantastic imo. before this game i never thought a swamp area could be so interesting but this game proved me wrong
---
I didn't know. Thank you so much for the info
---
When i am farming i server hop. The mobs are there on relog.(its annoying but best option atm)
---
OMFG.
---
Not the reference, I get that. Not even the reference being placed, nerds gotta fill the world somehow. But how the hell did you spot it?
---
Can you please stop whining on stupid legendary effects and focus on core improvements
---
"Survival" mode with carry over characters is the complete opposite spirit of Survival. 
---
How is it balanced if you can pad all your perks and inventory in Adventure, then go on a killing spree in Survival?
---
Ages ago equals a whole three months. 😂
---
I think it's pretty fucking clear that you aren't going to be able to see other people on the map who are tagged as hostile.
---
Yeah, me too. Today I spent 70% of my playing time trying to figure out ways to dump weight and still make stuff. It was a frickin' bore. 
---
Making a new server type when server stability is at a low is a pretty bad idea. 
---
Why nerf TSE when there are stronger things? Nerf those too then. Otherwise everyone is going to be using these shitty meme builds and the game is already trashy enough.
---
Was running from a scorchbeast. Took cover behind a trailer. Peeled out to pop a cap in its ass and it ran to kill someone else. Went on scavenging and found it
---
It’s going to be the same nerf in both modes.
---
This. This right here.
---
There's always a percentage of players that don't have the most basic requirements. It depends on how the platform tracks players. Maybe they bought/downloaded the game and never played it. Maybe they launched it but decided to not actually play it for whatever reason. Maybe they launched it and had technical problems, and refunded the game before ever leaving the vault. Stuff like that always adds up, I just wanted to know what the percentage of that was. In call of duty WW2 on steam, 75.9% of people beat the first campaign mission, 73.5% killed 10 players online, 24.4% built the tesla gun in zombies (it's a very easy step, most people get it done before round 10, so within maybe 15-20 minutes of playing, and the steps are literally written out on the screen for you). 
---
Yeah, Bethesda. I don't buy atoms because I can't build new stuff in my small CAMP because of the budget. 
---
That would make too much sense. They'd have to force new characters likely. Grind for gear on easy server then swap to the hardcore one 
---
We are aware of an issue where you may see the message "You lack the requirements to repair this item" or "You lack the requirements to create this item," despite having all of the required items, if the junk is split between your character's inventory and your stash.
---
 
---
In order to repair or craft the item, place all of your junk in your stash or retrieve the required items from your stash so that you have them in your inventor
---
 THIS IS BETHESDAS DIRECT RESPONSE COPIED FROM THEIR FORUMS
---
keep  trying kid i won this argument because you responded by being a  troll  hold your L i'll take my ez win. Its obvious youre projecting to   everyone reading because you suck at live you keep doing that salty kid   it fuels me that youre so mad that you cant respond to my post because   you'll look even more salty if you do and your peers will laugh at you   failing to troll and just projecting, kid
---
now since i dont  need your shit trolling enjoy the BLOCK
---
I just wish my hard work wasn't being taken in vain, they are already nerfing the shit out of the duper's weapons of choice, so what are people afraid of? You can be immune to all explosive damage right now, without any legendary effects on you. People who are complaining about the pvp, not saying you, and trying to shape this new game mode, it seems, need to actually do some research and counter these things. There are ways to nullify anything really, you just need the equipment and perks.
---
Im jelly
---
Lol it's also hard to haggle on the mic when nobody uses one.
---
I just built a massive house in the savage divide near Fort Defiance and I can barely furnish it :( I looks so cool too.
---
I really need to get some but havent gotten any fron farming 
---
I'll add but I want to hold off until 50 now
---
He's still whining
---
I went to my social tab and left team fixed it. 
---
I know, but that nerf doesn’t even fix the issue. There isn’t anyone that can one shot a player through the pacifist shield or one shot a Queen without using glitches or hacks at this point in time. So nerfing the weapons themselves doesn’t even remotely change the fact that if you consume a few extra bobbleheads you can get the exact same damage output as before
---
Question. How does this differ from later on when survival has been out a while and a new player wants to join? How would you even it out for them? Except for when an mp game is new there is always going to be much higher level characters with much better stuff wondering around. 
---
It's stunning that nobody at Bethesda realized that they could never balance a Fallout title for PvP.
---
It's Fallout.......you start out weak and grind until you get insanely OP weapons and then you go grind stronger mobs and hope to get even more OP weapons.
---
The whole excitement of finding and killing a 3* is the excitement if checking your inventory to see if you got something insanely OP. 
---
WTF were they thinking?
---
If you haven’t done miner miracles yet, do it and make some excavator power armor. That really helps you survive the attacks. I was able to kill my first with a modded up 308. Took a while, used a few stims but the damage is manageable.
---
Oof, people who want this game to stay bad.
---
Anywhere else.
---
If people can carry over the saves no one will play it. Or they’ll play it in a very novel way for a brief moment. Force people to grind out their characters and gear in survival mode and it’ll be a success.
---
Yeah. It's stupid and really complicates things when you are storing and moving things back and forth. 
---
Can't you just go directly to Glassed Caverns? That's what I did, at least
---
YES! Something that's hell to play, but has a  certain charm that makes you return. I feel like base raiding / open stashes should be implemented too. 
---
That makes way too much sense. 
---
How would you know it's not a big deal? Seems naive to me to just assume that no exploits will come of this.
---
Other than people on your team/friends I think there should be no icons for players on the map just like when you are wanted or there will be A LOT of greifing other players.
---
Too much sense if you ask me. 
---
Yep, we should be able to scrap legendary items. We often can't sell them due to the trader cap limits.
---
I get your style, and I did it that way on my 2nd &amp; 3rd run of FO4.
---
I personally find the slow approach works in favour of my play time. I only get a few hours a week, so immersing myself properly, reading stuff, sneaking about, exploring randomly, it's all made THIS game all the more enjoyable for me. That, and I do enjoy a good, difficult fight with a strong mob of super mutants occasionally too.
---
so more people pvp than reached level 100  
---
kinda takes a dump on the idea that only 1% play for pvp
---
I often think "people mad about losing a bag of junk probably can't imagine playing a game where they would lose their fully persistent house and everything inside if a thief managed to pickpocket both of their keys."
---
It's kinda screwed for PVE too. The few handful of decent builds this patch get cut in half next patch. 
---
My god, how's your vagina?
---
Shut the fuck up with calling to nerf everything already.
---
Try other builds. There a MORE THEN JUST TSE AND MELEE that can do great damage.
---
Learn to play the dam game and stop bitching about everything. 
---
Crafting gives you XP and you need stuff to craft. Also, when you know you're going to need something to build and repair armour or something, you have to save up.
---
Yes the game is shit especially since all the duping it's terrible but Bethesda isn't going to fix anything until all bugs are fixed at this rate the game will be dead before the dlc even comes out
---
This might be a good idea for later on, but no way for the testing phase.  
---
Let's do a permadeath hardcore mode!
---
It’s never been bad. There were problems. Who’s denying it?  Bethesda fixes a ton a are fixing more. 
---
If you want to talk about a bad game, let’s talk about red dead redemption zombie edition
---
I don't mind it and find the turrets help if you manage to tag all of them 
---
We need to be able to scrap ammo or at least sell it. Dumping it is a waste. 
---
Why are you replying to me like a 12 year old instead of posting counter data?
---
I will trade you six pvp betas , the data mined Presidential election pvp race event , TWO atom shops.
---
In return i want player vending machines , vault dungeon, more quests, clans and clan bases, extended faction events!.
---
Bullet penetration isn't a thing? I've seen a couple of times where I've hit someone with vats and then the car behind explodes soon after. 
---
Can't rule out some other reason for this happening but it seems odd that this would happen at all if that's the case.
---
Pvp mode shouldn't have legendarys that's would fix it it would rely on skill not OP builds for explosive 
---
Fixing a buggy game is cool but if by then the fun has been sapped out of the game it's all a big waste. Especially if they take long enough for the player base to shrink.
---
Balancing is a perfectly reasonable thing to debate. Plus any comments about crashes etc will just be complaining considering there's little to debate about there 
---
Source? Pretty sure it’s indica. 
---
Or the why virtually every single piece of abandoned crap laying around is literally FULL of screws...they are the one thing we can’t seem to get enough of.....
---
If they make it work like it does in The Division I will be fine.
---
I mean at least RDR had a good base game.
---
Sorry can’t I’m on Xbox
---
Just let high level players join it
---
Sounds fishy to me. 
---
I honestly dont care what they nerf, what they buff, what they do is what they do. All my powerful weapons are TSE's and I will be losing a lot in damage output...Im not crying about it.
---
No worries. I just ticked 50 today myself. If you get ready to roll and don't see me online, send me a PM here on reddit. There is about a 50/50 shot of me seeing it and hopping on :)
---
Yeah I haven't really found a good reason *not* to be in PA. Dumb finger, making me buy things I won't use. 
---
PvP is a top seller for PS4 games. They want to tap into that market. 
---
Most of the PvP mechanics on fo76 I see similar to other top grossing games. 
---
God I hope it's another drill *crosses fingers*
---
In reality without PvP TSE would never have been nerfed.
---
I don't PvP and I could care less if 1 million people have TSE. The queen fight has been legit and fun every time I've done it.
---
Always? Certainly not. But when 97% (contrary to what you think, that is absolutely not an exaggeration, as long as you don't count any other buggy Bethesda games *cough*Fallout 4*cough*) of my crashes to the dashboard are from just Fallout 76, I'd say without a doubt there is nothing on my end that could change that would make Fallout 76 crash less.
---
The fact that experiences vary so wildly in this game should be a huge indication at how poorly they've programed this game. I've never seen a multiplayer game with such widely different experiences between players. Including occurrences that were complete opposites of my experiences. Unless they were lying, which seems to be a theme on this sub. Wildly different experiences in a multiplayer game should NOT be a thing. I apparently just got the "lucky" experience of crashing all the time. Case in point, I searched for "unable to move" which is a new bug Bethesda introuduced with their latest attempt at patching bugs out. I've been unable to move multiple times after loading in, after waiting MINUTES. Happened multiple times to me. Just once to my girlfriend who had to quit before Super Mutants killed her. I only found two topics talking about it. So only a few people seem to be experiencing it. Did it occur to you that only a few people have to deal with crashing all the time?
---
If you actually read my words, the non exact 27-50 number would make perfect sense. I didn't start counting until I realized I was getting shit on by Bethesda's shitty programming. So I THEN started counting. I counted 27. I'm guessing it could have been around 50, including the previous ones that I hadn't begun counting. Do my words make sense now?
---
Crashing every 4.4 minutes would mean it took me that long to log in. Sometimes it takes longer, because Bethesda apparently couldn't program for the Xbox One X properly. I say that because my girlfriend plays on an S, which in case you aren't aware is the less capable model. Yet 99 times out of 100, she loads into Fallout 76 faster than I do, or gets to her destination faster than I do, even when I fast travel first. Just in Fallout 76 though! My more powerful X loads every other game we play together faster. But no, must be my console, but JUST for Fallout 76.
---
Once, I spent over an hour doing nothing but crashing. Within two seconds of getting in to the server, I crash back to the dashboard. Try again, two seconds on the server I crash again. And again. and again. and again. and again. I never once moved my character, because the buggy game crashed before I could, for over an hour. Since I wasn't expecting to be crashing nonstop, I didn't check the time, so I can't be exact, but it lasted for at least an hour. Hard resetting my console didn't change anything either, which is every customer supports go to answer besides uninstalling and reinstalling. I just kept trying until it finally decided to not crash after two seconds on the server. A few (I believe two) other times, I just gave up after a handful of crashes right after logging in, because I did NOT want to waste another hour or more of my life crashing. I just played another game that not surprisingly didn't crash once. But please, blame my hardware. Or whatever else fanboys love to blame other than Bethesda. Couldn't be the hardware, because all 200+ games on my hard drive combined haven't crashed as much as Fallout 76 has. That's even including Fallout 4 that crashed it's own share too, without any mods (probably ~100 crashes in over 14 DAYS of playtime, which is less than 76 has crashed on me in less play time). In fact, I haven't had another game crash since October. Just Fallout 76. I'm going to be binging Overwatch during the Lunar event, and I'd bet money it doesn't crash once. Why? Because in the year I've owned it, it hasn't crashed one single time. Before you call me a Blizzard fanboy, I've certainly been disconnected from their servers on occasion, but in over a year (thousands of hours) I've been disconnected about 30 times. Most of those were when Blizzard was dealing with a recurring DDoS attack. What is Bethesda's excuse? But no, must be all on my end. The key difference between the two is Overwatch was designed and built specifically for multiplayer, while Fallout 76 was a poor copy paste from a single player game that needed another year or two to fix all the bugs. You know, the bugs that have been in the game since the very first Beta that they're still to this day ignoring? Is it really surprising it crashes so frequently? Really?
---
Oh, I figure there might be the argument that Overwatch and Fallout 76 are too different to compare. Ok, how about an open world RPG? One made by a company with considerably less money, power, and crazy fanboys? I'm talking about Elix by Piranha Games. From what I can tell, they've already stopped patching the game, even though it still has bugs. (Same could be said about Fallout 4 and its bugs however) I put about 60 hours into it before I had to put it on the back burner due to other games. It was October last year, I wanted to play as much of the Overwatch Halloween Event as possible (2-8 hours a day with 0 crashes the entire month) and I got to play the Stress Test as well as every single minute of Beta for Fallout 76 (minus crashes and bullshit error messages that Bethesda themselves ended up being clueless about). So about Elix. Like I said, they aren't anything like Bethesda, but they still made a huge amazing game.  Like I said, it still has bugs, and from what I can tell hasn't been patch since middle of last year IIRC. So, in about 60 hours of play in a huge open world RPG, how many times did it crash on me? Less than five. But again, single player game versus a multiplayer game that got most of its assets including the horribly outdated and buggy engine from a single player game. There really is no comparison, unless some other company was really dumb or just too cheap like Bethesda was to fund development of a multiplayer game.
---
I spent way too much time on this post, but I'm really sick and tired of fanboys saying it's all me and everything is fine and Bethesda can do no wrong and whatever else they say to blame me for my bugs. Or worse, blame me for "not figuring out" how to get around a bug that Bethesda lied about fixing, because they STILL defend Bethesda when they lie. It's a buggy game that they keep making buggier with their patches.
---
Can i get a Batman suit? Like just me and no one else. I would also like to take no damage from players and dish out one shot kills to just players, but just me no one else. 
---
Hell yeah. If Mass Effect can have that option, it's about time Fallout did. 
---
Some solutions- no player icons on the map at all, unless in group. New characters only, no cross-play.
---
I'm not crying about TSE nerf. I'm asking them to nerf more stuff that is more powerful.
---
Not every high level has a tse. I’m level 85 and the best thing I have is a two shot minigun.
---
Judging by the bruise on her face, it's too late.
---
I agree with you. I guess we'll always have the atom shop for some "new" content lol
---
I did not get it so it is not 100%.
---
It's not bro something happened with the last patch alot of reports have been seen here regarding it. I have had this issue myself alot in the Mire in a spot i chose because few come to this area.
---
Everytime i check around for miles and can't see any sign of a C.A.M.P unit or buildings.
---
* Weeps for Feed the People *
---
I got rid of a few helmets before I realized how hard they are to find,  haven't seen one in like a month 😂
---
I'm pretty pissed off they're nerfing my TSE, guns that people actually fight over and are willing to pay for.
---
So did you move your camp or are you waiting for them to fix it?
---
Being able to target heads and limbs is the only reason I use it. But I feel like vats bugging out in general makes me feel like it doesn't make a noticable difference
---
And Im saying, I dont care. I dont care if I get one shot gun by someone with a more powerful weapon/build, the game gives us that option. People take advantage of it. If you get killed by a more powerful build, it was your fault for shooting them in the first place.
---
I will sheepishly admit I copied and pasted my comment between the various posts here. :/
---
At what point would you be satisfied? Have them nerf the whole goddamned game until everyone does the same amount of damage no matter the build or weapons? Would that be fun? 
---
Nothing in this game is over powered, not even TSEs. With the right build you can just stand there letting the enemy TSE you in the face until they get bored or run out of ammo. Same for melee. Melee builds, the really strong ones, are glass builds.
---
All Bethesda needs to do is get rid of the people who duped the hell out of the game and are now one shotting everyone because of bobblehead stacking. That's the issue here. Not TSE. Not Melee. Not whatever kind of armor is that current soup de jour. It's the exploits that this age old engine allows that's at fault here.
---
I've still yet to see stage 2 of Swarm of Suitors. I'm standing on this island in the middle of a lake of toxic sludge and the freaking mirelurks never show up. 
---
\+karma
---
Very good post.
---
I don't play the quickly slapped on pre-alpha pvp. This is a pve post.  
---
LOL
---
SBQ is the worst. Today I got a 2* leg piece and a 1* arm piece along with all of the ultracite armor plans I already have but still no helmet.
---
3 broken guns and 1,000 rounds of ammo.
---
If you log out and enough it eventually will place it back down. If it does not you will have to do what i have done 3 times so far. 
---
Place your C.A.M.P unit in another location then move it back to its old spot then replace your blueprint back down.
---
I am hoping it will be fixed next patch.
---
For fun!
---
This is all just speculation regardless. I get that you guys want to complain because it makes you feel good I guess idk but how about you wait for survival mode to actually drop before you start pissing and moaning. People like you are the reason why this sub is so toxic 
---
Stay away.  He clearly has RAIDS.
---
After lv 50?
---
guild wars 2 has great pvp, and its for one simple reason.
---
ITS NOT IN THE PVE! plain and simple. look at ark, look at rust, look at conan exiles, what do these all have in common? NOT MIXING PVE AND PVP.
---
"Have them nerf the whole goddamned game until everyone does the same amount of damage no matter the build or weapons? ? "
---
This is how RPGs are supposed to work.  You pick the weapon style or build due to your game play difference. Not because one does 400x more damage than the other
---
I just wanted a re-skin of ARK or Rust... Sad thing is, I'm not even being sarcastic.
---
So silly of me.  Bethesda was right, scrolling down a list of hundreds of unsorted holotapes was the perfect game mechanic.
---
Too bad they didn't make it so if you have too many the game breaks.  That would be Immersion Perk ***
---
Good for you. This conversation doesnt interest me anymore. Have a good night.
---
Yup. Neither did 2 of my buddies.
---
I’ll trade you for one paper bag. HMU! ;)
---
Yeah I honestly like that we get it often it's just not very realistic making 1 day sales seeing as it's impossible to grind for 900 atoms in 24 hrs. 
---
To liven things up I feel like they'd just have to tweak some spawns add new enemy types and let nuke zones vary more with their outcomes would keep me interested for quite a while . Ideally while they make "actual dlc" 
---
Great video, great accent, great easter eggs.  
---
Alternate suggestion:
---
Keep your character level and perks in both modes (a copy would be made at the time of creation, much like a new game +).  All new characters start out fresh at the vault with no plans learned and only starter gear.
---
Hard won levels are retained and no duped items are permitted.  Win/Win, no?
---
(This would be my 'best as I can see it' solution)
---
I'm a solo player, and I love the idea. This is how it should have been from the start. It's realistic that you could kill another player at anytime, even by accident. It adds a whole new dimension to the realism of the game.
---
 My buddy runs in before me? I never play with a "buddy" but if I did, I would watch my grenades and explosions and such, hell it might even be fun to "accidentally" kill my "buddy" because Ill be taking his brown paper bag.
---
 I am not afraid of dupers or explosive this or two shot that, because unlike the majority of people here, I actually took perks and mods to counter these things, WOW! WHAT DID YOU SAY? YOU CAN COUNTER THINGS IN THIS GAME? Yes. That is what I said. There are perks, mods, legendary affixes, etc. to counter almost any damage type in the game. You can even become immune to ANY explosive damage with a dense mod on your chest and rank 2 fireproof. IT'S ALMOST LIKE THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE GETTING ONE SHOTTED, CAMPS DESTROYED, ETC. ARE NOT DOING ANY PREPARATION FOR PVP OR THE WEAPON TYPES MOST COMMON! Holy shit, you might be onto something there Clark, theres definitely a positive correlation between the two. 
---
Seriously people, if you aren't willing to research, spec into, and do the dirty work of, than you shouldn't have a say in what should be in PVP or not. Christ.
---
Drop your useless ammo please!
---
It looks like a halfway prefurnished new york apartment. Its pretty bare. You have no shelving, no kitchen, no bathroom, a connected bedroom/livingroom with no tv, your "porch" looks like someone made a floor and said "fuck it, I'm to tired to finish" and worst of all your floors don't line up in almost every room &gt;\_&gt; that looks awful. And if you want a little more realism, no one in there right mind would use a wooden floor in a workshop lol. But that is just me being picky.
---
OH joy, the marketing boys have been watching Fortnite's numbers and decided that Fallout needed to be ruined... good job guys!
---
Bye. Hopefully they announce bloody nerf soon.
---
I haven’t played since Friday. Shits annoying 
---
This vault doc is probably going to suck anyways so I'm not getting my hopes up
---
Oh yeah. So much ammo for so many worthless guns. Pretty sure I've got 5k at least of 6
---
556 and 44 Cal. 
---
For as much as shitty armor drops you'd think some of their more rare effects like reduced weapon/junk weights
---
Thank God for bandolier.
---
But the people who are standing there eating TSE shots to the face in not one but 5 pieces of extremely rare armor got their gear legit?
---
I don't really know computers, but even to me that sounds bad.
---
I mean, how could I pass that deal up?
---
I don’t know what I am missing, but at max level, my crafted baseball bats and sledgehammers (non-legendary) with the mods i have unlocked are much better then a capped super sledge with the paltry mod you can unlock.
---
It was in Skyrim irrc,, you could make Cheese wheels with it :)
---
Even with fresh characters people who played the beta will have an advantage, and then there is only 1 true way to lvl fast so you just can camp your way near roads and have a feast dunno why people complain all of you gonna get fucked either way by hardore players
---
Feel you. I just can't imagine them being all that fun for very long. Hopefully there are some repeatable task/events there is at least some farmable junk 
---
Or a balanced weight system where rifles don't weigh more then a giant ass minigun or a rocket launcher and a quad barrel flintlock rifle doesn't weigh less then a pistol.
---
Hey if you need help my psn is darkdestory23 would love to do that again best mine in game
---
Of course they are  underleveld. You are fighting underleveled monsters, what did you expect?
---
Well damn. That sucks. Thanks for the info!
---
Did You get rid of enough, or did you end up picking up even more on the way?
---
I hope so too. I’m gonna try finding 20 more and see if it’ll eventually pop
---
Too relatable 😂.
---
Oh definitely hopefully a few new weapons and some armour and hopefully they'll add the recon Marine helmet that I've wanted since beta
---
I'm more concerned about people who have duped weapons in pvp.
---
Starting clean slate means (presumably) a fair fight.
---
Honestly I think I'm just trying to justify my mistake 😂😭
---
Yeah actually,  definitely not worth 900. 
---
and then the whiners will wine about that... rinse and repeat
---
Everyone will just camp outside the vault and just spawn kill over and over and over again.
---
"it just works"
---
Ridiculous ... as requested by competitive PvP players. I am saddened that a Fallout game could take this game direction.
---
Can I suggest that PvP be kept VERY separate from PvE. Different servers please and no way should a toon be able to switch ... and fresh toon is required for the new mode. 
---
Also, that PvP should not be rewarded with extras not obtainable in other realms.
---
Do not lose sight of your loyal casual group who will log in after a hard day at work and/or with family looking for a relaxing outlet. 
---
There should be two environments.  PVE-only and the new PVP version.   That way everyone gets to play as they’d like. 
---
They need to fix weight count on some stuff too. When a sniper rifle weighs more then a freakin minigun or rocket launcher you know somethings off lol. They could add weapon stands and armor/pa stands too that can store items as well as display them. Really surprised it didn't come with the game release. Seems like an obvious thing to me.
---
The issues with pvp are always the same in every game. Cant please every one. Its a PVP mode you dont have to join in on it. I do agree that this is added to late and with the duppers that has effected items. maybe an item wipe. 
---
I dont know. but..
---
Only thing they i would like to see is a hard core mode that you only get one life, if you die its dead. I would play the shit out of that mode.
---
I would love to see groups of people roplaying as responders, trying to defend the roads of the forest from raider scum...
---
Since I play solo most of the time, I kinda want to roleplay as a wandering ranger, patrolling the Appalachia mountains and stuff, I suppose that count as a good character??
---
I have a fusion core gen but what i do to save building space is place my camp at a sub station of the main plant, then power up the main plant. when you do this it powers the substations power box as well. worth 100 elec. :)
---
This. It isn't that there aren't going to be viable builds. It's that were going to need to confine ourselves to specific builds that restrict play styles and methods of gameplay that should be as useful as anything else.
---
If to make guns useful I need perks and legendary effects that force me into low hp builds then why can melee Yers pick up nearly any weapon and have no problems.
---
It's the hoops you gotta jump through to play how you want 
---
Most likely. If you know your way around the game and its mechanics, a nerf to whatever is at best a nuisance because you might need to grind, at max, 10-15 levels to swap some points around and get the right perk cards. 
---
&gt; Rule #1 is don't fragment the player base.
---
You can't "fragment" a playerbase when each server only holds 24 random people.
---
There is nothing to fragment.
---
Refer to the other comment
---
I don't plan on ever playing survival, it's not for me but I am happy it's finally happening for people that wanted PvP.
---
I also agree that letting existing characters to join will ruin the experience. I think the modes should always be separated and not allowed to bring existing characters into them. 
---
This "game" is a huge mistake -- FTFY
---
100% agree.   I mean stuff can get hairy pretty quickly out there but the environment is worth it!
---
The cynic in me sees this as the ultimate cop-out.  "You'll be so busy murdering each other, we won't have to add new content at all!  Great plan!"
---
Damn I dont really wanna make a new character tho I'm only level 30
---
All mine I picked up 
---
people want clean slate characters because of rampant duping of legendary weapons and buff items, not because they are concerned about level differences.
---
Most people on Reddit think everyone has a TSE. Many think that the TSE gear they were trading for is legit. 
---
Reality is that after 300+ hours of gameplay I've never seen a TSE drop. They are extremely rare if you didn't buy a dupe.
---
Kindof thought the same like no new nuke zones. No new bosses and they stoppes patching the SBQ awfull loot table. I mean come on! In my opinion PVP can wait and would be improved by patching the bobblehead stacking and the upcoming TSE nerf. We already got fireproof + Dense Mod im good.
---
It's pretty cool honestly. Wish you could put it on more armors but still it's pretty slick.
---
If the nuka cola quantum sign had been 1 day only you can believe heads woulda rolled. Had to get hunting rifle skin and that brought me back down to 0 atoms : /
---
Thanks that helps alot
---
Not glitches or hacks just horribly broken Mechanics involving duplication of bobbleheads. Yes obtaining those bobbleheads was with glitches or hacks but the mechanic in which they work is just horrible conceptual gaming. They need to fix what’s already broke before releasing more broken bullshit.
---
I would be fine with that
---
One main stash at camp is what we need
---
Would a player risk a TSE on a survival server?
---
&gt;  Making a new character will only "level the playing field" for a few days. 
---
not if duping is fixed first.  
---
I definitely feel where you're coming from, mainly for me its about achieving my "build" asap, then finding BiS weapons and armor through farming/exploration and in this game, trading with others. I just have to have the best stuff, or I feel incomplete, I like to have my character fully fleshed out before starting any story quests, only because I feel my character would have these skills to start. He had a past that involved using a sniper rifle to deadly efficiency. That, and I like to one shot everything, especially with a sniper build.
---
Yeah. I think that is also a good place! I wonder if the can clear the mess and make it a centre. I would be nice
---
The use of the bobbleheads is the problem. You do realize that bobbleheads stack through rejoining a server right? I forget the method but if you leave and come back the timer resets and the effect doubles. Now try using the effect of 100 explosive bobbleheads
---
I'm never coming back to the game until there is some sort of wipe. 
---
I don’t have the trophy for leaving the vault, and I assume I’m not alone, because I started with the Beta and haven’t started a new character. 
---
yes, people have duped buff items like bobbleheads, which stupidly stack.  add that to duped legendary weapons .... and you have a hot mess.
---
that is why people want clean slate pvp - not because they are worried about higher level characters.  they want people to start with clean *inventories*.
---
Sorry for the confusion.
---
I was referring to all of the duped sets of Unyielding Sentinel armor that are floating around.
---
Everyone always talks about TSE but there is so much more OP gear floating around.
---
Whitesprings 
---
At the rate we are going with all the nerfing we are gonna be limited to pillow fights. Until actually someone gets killed and starts crying on reddit for a nerf on that too. Im afraid we won’t even be able to play the game bc there’s not enough bullets in this game that can handle the sponge fest the monsters are in game. PvP well that’s a different ball game but I’m sure there are better ways to balance than just passing everything weapon under the chopping  block of nerf. New perk cards to counter explosive effects perhaps. Or higher resistances in pvp. Or pvp gear exclusive to pvp servers and same for pve.  Or perhaps make some legendary effects only effective on NPCs 
---
At least there's always dozens of wall textures and structure stuff they don't let us use. Endless potential for camp objects (which I'm a sucker for) 
---
You know, content they don't have to design? Lazy shit lol 
---
I personally use the mod that removes name plates from players. It also removes the emote icons above thier heads. It's much more immersive and greatly increases my enjoyment of the game. Plus you then focus on the action of the emote the character is doing rather than the dumb icon.
---
In that case, it's the easiest online  "survival" game I've ever played.
---
If you ask me if they make it a f2p game they give me my 150 dollars back or make me my own private server for just me and my friends to play around with.
---
Also cannot pick it up it won’t allow me is this future content paint that became a bug because I am so confused.
---
Sounds badass
---
ive encountered scorchbeats, mirelurk queens, anglers (so many of them -\_-), and so many more hostile creatures. that was all when i was lvl 15 or so i think when i was going through the main story.
---
You're either hilarious or ridiculous
---
Sbq Loot and vendor mods/ plans are going to make me quit by the end of January, it's just not fun 
---
Out of all of those, I think the map one is the only I've seen people say that Bethesda said they were ok with it.
---
The rest are clear cheats though. Might still be ok but I'd personally err on the side of caution.
---
Definitely had to buy all of mine here 😂. My rng is terrible. 
---
Buddy, I literally just said that. Bobbleheads are the issue. I am in agreement with you. But yes basically log out before timer ends and it will reset.
---
Clans been using for them ages and if you ask the lads on text chat mod most of all the popular mods on.
---
Only things they have taken issue with is Cheat Engine and Reshade.
---
Sounds like a scorched duper.
---
I don't really feel like beating a dead horse with this, but there are numerous comments explaining why allowing existing characters is an awful idea.
---
You should probably go read those.
---
Except it's not going to be fair to legitimate players whom have put hundreds of hours into a character, and were hoping for a PVP mode all along. Starting fresh isn't an appealing thing to everybody. And like it or not there are legitimate TSE weapons out there. My rifle is one of them. And those are the least of anybody's worries. In fact, they are even nerfing those prefixes into the ground as well as banning dupers/exploiters, so in theory, since the most common duped weapons are TSE, and those are nerfed, dupers are banned, wouldn't everyone be starting on even ground anyway? Last I checked, people are scrambling to get rid of TSE weapons for Bloodied, anti armor, and furious weapons. 
---
Oooh 
---
People are clamoring for survival just like the Atom Shop has ‘limited time only sales.’ It’s a false narrative likely created  to usher in their micro-transaction monetization plans in some fashion
---
find a low level exploring the mire and tag along. Most likely will be dying left and right. Stimpak or alcohol revive everytime the poor dude falls.
---
I've built my character exclusively for pvp, I knew this was coming. I was pouring hours into my character, and now all these PVP noobs, sorry but that's what you are (not meant to be insulting), are trying to shape the new PVP mode, like their uneducated opinion matters on such things. EDUCATE YOURSELVES and do better.
---
Wait what we can add terminals to our camps???
---
BRB
---
What’s you PSN name?
---
Starting a beta.  When there was already a beta before launch.
---
Jesus how was this game allowed to launch 
---
It takes very little time to level up characters.  
---
It took seconds to dupe weapons and bobbleheads, and the game is full of them.
---
You are awesome, Dense + Fireproof + upcoming TSE nerfs = USELESS TSE weapons.
---
Gotta add that blue lamb skin jacket to the game so cosplayers have a reason to buy it. 
---
Feeeeeeeels soo good uugh getting so clean! Uuugh.
---
No doubt 
---
I initially took it to complement Enforcer in dealing with Scorchbeasts.
---
In practice, I think I have more luck just firing in the general direction of what I want than exhausting precious AP points on VATS.  Half the time, the Scorchbeast continues to fly with crippled wings anyway.  That said, it is useful to see what the different limb strengths are at, because the reactions the enemies provide are all over the place.
---
Stop spreading rumors. The only bobble head that stacks is the explosive one, it's been well tested. 
---
As I like my irradiated filth, I find the shower painful. 
---
Yeah, I agree with you on this. They can then go full pacifist and tell PvP players to go full PvP.
---
My other current lover affair is The Division and the way they did Light Zone vs Dark Zone works really well. I am hoping for a similar experience in FO76. That will be the perfect combo for me personally.
---
Also FO76 Dark Zone (Survival) should have better loot drops than Light Zone (Adventure) mode. The loot should then be de-contaminated from Dark Zone to be used in Light Zone (Scorched infected or something).
---
That will be my perfect PvP FO76 experience :)   
---
Players are expecting so much from this game, a bit too much imo.
---
I've played many of the previous games, long time fan of both fallout and elder scrolls. Pretty much every one of there titles have similiar core mechanics. 
---
One feature is min/max lvls of enemies in any given area. Players explore outwards and as they gain in lvls, outgrow  the max lvl of enemies in previous areas moving on to greener pastures elsewhere. This mechanic means the game has finite playability. At a certain point, you outgrow the game. When you find yourself there, you start again or move on to another game. Such is the cycle of a gamer. Get over it
---
At least you can keep leveling in this title, no mass complaints about raising the lvl cap.
---
no that,, thats exactly what im talking about. it doesnt give a (working) option for folks on xbox
---
Right, Have you ever noticed how shitty the graphics are for FO76, I was playing Halo MCC and I played the first Halo which somehow had better graphics and trees than Fallout like wtf
---
It is a legitimate rare item.  
---
Pretty useless mods but no they wont get you banned 
---
HOOOOOLD UP, as much as I would love more storage space and CAMP Budget, they first need to make the servers more stable. They would suffer greatly if we were handed more storage and budget right now
---
Not 100% sure about this but when i go near some places it triggers events. I swear every dang time i have gone to Grafton it triggers that event message.
---
Lolz 
---
Yes, griefers suck. I hope Bethesda uses the mode as an out to change Adventure mode into full on pacifist mode and send PvP players to Survival mode. Best of both worlds essentially. 
---
Clean bad! muNGO LIKE HIMS DIRT
---
I hear you but maybe they could do both at once. 
---
This is abother reason why they shouldn't have rushed out the game so god damn quickly. Survival mode should have been in the game from the beginning with tuning fixes in later patches. I can't believe they think throwing survival in the game and allowing characters to transfer over characters at their current progress was a good idea. They are really showing that thwy truly have no thought process behind some of their ideas.
---
LMAO 
---
Maybe someone needs to be at the area for the event to spawn? 
---
Dang ... but in every game I play is the PvP content always developed and maintained ahead and usually at the expense of PVE!?
---
Not sure worth a test.
---
In a perfect world yes, but with how much they're barely holding this already broken game, I'd be real impressed if they managed to pull that one off
---
We do.  Need it.  Stash space.
---
Yeah those queens are no joke! Anglers are pretty fast.   When it gets foggy and dark, it's quite creepy.
---
In this case, why play PvP mode? 
---
and the most duped weapon is the two shot explosive.
---
so the explosive bobble is all that is needed.
---
Like from flint or a different vendor because the one at the train station only sells cane mods from my experience.
---
omg awesome thank you so much!!
---
Fully agree. Factions and then manhunts on raiders.
---
Not sure why there is such a big outrage on this though. There are examples of this PvE vs PvP environments working great so if Bethesda plan it right and copy ideas from the other games it has the potential to be great.
---
Its killed a lot of games off as the usually fickle competitive PvP ride the boat until the next shiny comes along.
---
Next patch they’re nerfing two shot explosives.
---
Ya’ll pc players will have to watch out for my stealth/bloody build. 
---
Fragment the player base? This isn't eve online where we all play on one single server, there are hundreds of 24 person servers and having different options is a model many successful mmos use, notably world of warcraft with pve, pvp, and role-playing variants of their servers. 
---
Been using all of the. The glowing one really trained me to know what has the components I need. Just removed the glowing ones except bobbles. Which I'll probably get rid of .I could see them disallowing them tho.
---
The map one is as bad as having a a Nintendo power that gives you tips. Lock pick is a godsend took forever to get it to work in 21x9. 
---
I'm gonna use mods tho cause fuck dealing with Bethesdas shortcomings
---
Gives... hurt so good a new meaning... I get it...lol
---
Play a different game until more content drops, or start again 
---
Whitesprings, Watoga, WestTek, Sugar Grove, General's Steakhouse, Wendigo Cave, Horde events, Monster Mash, and Uranium Fever event anytime it is available.
---
Nope I don’t think so as it is in the machines guns section of the crafting menu. Otherwise it would show under pipe weapons 
---
No 
---
Would you believe I have a mental disability? Funny I know. It’s not a joke though. Sorry?
---
OP isnt saying it will fix everything, hes saying its one aspect that should be included in this mode, which mostly everyone agrees with. This isnt a single player game where you should be allowed to switch difficulties whenever you feel like it.
---
roachy,,
---
And here I am just asking for power armor labels so I can collect more 
---
Thank you
---
I'm pretty sure that's the case.  As I understand it, you should receive the three different generator plans in three plays.  The only thing that changes, then, must be the other token rewards.
---
I would say that the servers should be "Co-Op"(PvP Disabled), Normal(needs a better name), and "Survival".
---
I’m about to do a nuke run if you’re still interested? PSN danprao 
---
Lol no.
---
I really suspect Bethesda will go all out PvE only mode and PvP only mode since the mixed mode is a good idea on paper but doesn't work in real world.
---
Again just look at the The Division memes on the internet. In PvE mode everyone is working together and friendly. In PvP mode those same people become teabaggers but everyone is happy because that is expected behaviour and players are prepared
---
Yeah it's wild. I got all the DLCs for FO4 recently and it's insane how much better that game runs. I don't get how it can be so terrible on my rig. I got battlefield about the same time and gave been putting it off. Once I do coming back to 76 will feel like stepping back 10 years
---
I'ma still play though lol
---
The reward plan does seem to be RNG, I have received two large generators before a fusion on one character.
---
thanks my dude!
---
Haven’t been there yet. Perhaps tomorrow. Looking forward to it!
---
It’s a developer room only item so you can’t obtain it legitimately 
---
My husband gave me a two star shishkabob that I can’t let go, despite better options.
---
My lever action dropped for me. Only one I've seen but still, I've had dozens of Two shot weapons and around 5-6 explosive weapons. All it takes is time, patience, and a little bit of luck on your side.
---
How do you know which events have legendary mobs?
---
Oh yeah same here I've been playing some Bo4 lately
---
Taking a higher level character into Survival with all their Adventure weapons will only get you so far, because Survival's rewards will be better (if what is written is to be believed) and damage scaling will also be in effect to ensure that while the world will be harsh, it won't be unfair.  Bring all your duped TSE combat shotguns and minions and whatever. I would hope that whatever can be found in Survival will top that.
---
I'll concede that I'm trusting what Bethesda is saying about it. I'm just trying to have hope. I've enjoyed the game (despite it crashing literally every time I enter the gym at the Charleston fire department).
---
Sent you s friend request
---
Alot of us have been in a similar spot for abit now. We are currently waiting on the next lot of content. Our clan has dedicated ourselfs to helping others in the mean time.
---
Its alot of fun and i highly reccomend it. Hopefully we should see the first vault open within the next few weeks or month.
---
You don't decide anything.
---
bring a hazmat suit or something for waterborn diseases just incase you tread water. I spent most of my time in the mire when i went there the first time stealthing because everything had like 20 or so levels on me lol
---
If it's too difficult then why not have survival mode for everyone (Old and New) have a passive mode for those that just want the harder game without psychos. The murder leader board should have tournaments held at the dirt track where you can either join or watch the slaughter. Top prize gets a random legendary.
---
I wanted to find his bride! I felt like he just got married!
---
First thing I did when I finished all the quests was go back to the areas that I went through at a low level and take my time and explore them. you'll probably find there's a lot of stuff you missed when you were just hurrying to get through and complete the quests.
---
then I started making it my mission to get all of the harder to obtain stuff in the game like the Nuka Cola armor paint and various plans and mods for my power armor and weapons.
---
Recently I still wander the Wasteland still picking up random plans and mods but I try to check out my map and go join up with lower-level players and help them out and give them stuff. 
---
They better remove players from being seen on the map if this is the case.  Otherwise it's going to just lead to folks who want to dominate the server instance just hunting down everyone else.  
---
You can’t protect being one shot in passive mode by someone with 100 explosive bobbleheads stacked even with tier 3 fireproof, you can’t defend against 20000 damage one hitting you...lol. Nice concept but doesn’t solve the problems.
---
Idk maybe it'll let them develop both simultaneously and content releases will he more steady. With us using the same characters they're gonna have to think about balance for both so....
---
*Crosses fingers*
---
Even then it’s still undeniable that tse weapons are better. Luck shouldn’t be a factor in pvp.
---
You can’t down a person and revive them anymore. Best was is get a buddy and jump off a ranger tower. 
---
my first encounter with a hermit crab scared me lol. i saw its shell but didnt vats to make sure it was safe and i ran like the wind when it woke
---
If you had to cheat to drag your way to the top, you aren't fittest.
---
Well if we are lucky we will have that. Log in as Adventure (PvE) and chill with no threats from players or log in as Survival (PvP) and have an adrenaline rush for the duration of the session.
---
Fallout 4 had good displays for weapons, armor, animal heads, etc... I thought those were great. 
---
Have you tried leveling up in "very little time" from lv 1 since the last two exp nerfs? Not very fast in my opinion, and I'm worried about my gear, not my level anyway, eventhough I earned both, and should get to use both.
---
The only real long term solution is a powerful curve to balance damage between high and low level players. But if that curve is too strong, it will feel like getting better gear and weapons is pointless. 
---
That sounds terrible.  It's already a bit of work to level up as it is, especially with the glowing ones being nerfed.  Lose your elegant camp, have to recollect plans, have to recollect unicorn weapons etc. every season? no thanks! 
---
I was looking forward to taking in my existing character to go PVP and all that jazz so I do hope they keep it was first described, I really don't care about trying to keep things level, until they totally nerf TSE's it's going to still be a slaughter for the few that do manage to get them and then go troll everybody. 
---
That makes the entire patch worth it 🙂
---
You’re at a horrible disadvantage when everyone you come across has duped TSE weapons. A clean slate is the only possible way this will work. It’s not a matter or like/dislike. 
---
Uhhh... Why would "Beth" need this trap to have a "quick looksie" into anyone's inventory? I don't pretend to know all the behind-the-scenes stuff but I'm *pretty sure* they could easily automate what you're suggesting if a "quick looksie" was all it took to justify a ban for duping.  
---
Also: "Nek minnit"...? I'll go ahead and assume that means "next minute" while simultaneously being completely unsure why you would write it that way. I am willing to chalk "Nek" up to a possible typo but, "minnit?" Naw, dawg.
---
Mods? Really?    Smh...
---
Yep, and I think Bethesda is realizing that hence the change.
---
Got it. I’m online now 
---
Fireproof + Dense Mod + TSE nerfs = Total immunity 
---
People hoped (maybe not really expected, but hoped) this would be like some other games that you could make something of a part-time life in, with in-game communities making long-term friends and enemies and the like. I actually think there are a fair number of people that still thing it's going to become that with time. Was that a realistic hope? No, but it is the source of a lot of disappointment.
---
What does having a mental disability have to do with this? I’m sorry if I offended you though, I was just agreeing.
---
You know. Totally agree. I have done the same spec’d my character to counter TSE.
---
Best way to counter it is to get in close and personal and watch them blow themselves up lol. 
---
I get your point but "forced to" seems a bit hyperbolic.
---
It means I have trouble reading intent in statements. Things like sarcasm and whatnot can often go past me despite the fact you weren’t being sarcastic. I can also just be an idiot
---
I was going to say with Ljisen did, but... That's a very good point, actually.
---
I’ve been fast traveling to events and when I load in the event is gone.
---
i'm level 142 and haven't touched anything other then with the stock of my guns...and only use my PA in nuke zones or for vener hoping to sell stuff. it really depens on the perk build you have, I have a sneak/rifle/pistol thing going on. I can build you a nice set of armor and upgrade your under armor if you are on PC. mattola69

You obviously haven't tried it. 100% explosive reduction is the same whether its 100 damage or 10000000 damage. Exploding bobblehead stacking works in pve, not in passive mode pvp. This was proven on video. Do some research and educate yourself before spitting stupidity.
---
Have you been to every location? What about completed in game challenges? The daily/weekly challenges give me something to do, as do the account wide challenges 
---
Holy fuck mate stop spamming this message everywhere... you have said this about 20 times the exact same message.
---
I understand you want to get your point across. But my lord stop spamning it man. Your thread will speak for itself in the community.
---
I can see the idea of playing with different rulesets since the eventual plan will be to allow folks to host their own servers with their own rulesets + mods.   
---
Still though, this early?  Also the modifications sound very basic, shortsighted, and like this mode will be a shitshow at best, dead on arrival at worst.  
---
&gt;Right now, we're looking to start beta in March
---
So we'll know what the finished product is like in March? Neat. 
---
What did you expect?  They have no way to fix the real issues with game ie: stability/exploits. so all they can do is try and get all the dupers on there own servers lmfao " It just works" 
---
Work filters are weird, but we can appeal at mine. I got a few coding and other engineering technical sites off the block list that way. I think they use a third party list. The IT guys were baffled at the ones I pointed out as well.
---
I can’t wait to Stealth One Shot these level 200s
---
Yes I’ll probably log In to do the challenges from now on to buy stuff from the shop 
---
There’s a background sound in Cranberry Bog that’s supposed to be an animal or bug or something. Instead, it really sounds like someone in a decontamination shower. Have a listen next time you’re in the area.
---
Your platform?
---
I need to be heard, and everyone else is saying the opposite.
---
I’ve found a few, mostly down near prime.
---
Xbox
---
Maybe they're hoping that PvP will carry the game's population and attract Twitch streamers similar to what games like Sea of Thieves have managed to do.  
---
Will do
---
The vendor computer closest to the crafting stations has the plans for the power armor station. 
---
They don’t sell them from the computer vendor near the generals room. 
---
Been collecting bobbles and magazines. Hoarding legendaries. Hoping I can stock a player vending machine soon. Would like to be able to sell game holos
---
I know, its like theres people are complaining about drowning, and there's a boat full of life preservers two feet from them.
---
Your obviously dissatisfied with the game quit. Bye, we don’t need you, cause here’s the thing your assuming a lot of things as fact when they are just your opinion and maybe that of your play group. 
---
Fallout 76 isn’t an mmo they don’t owe you anything. Quit
---
I use it, I mean you gotta keep weapons and Power Armor repaired.
---

---
Gives the plans for free instead of spending 900+ caps...
---
I've had a few TS and 2 explosive drop but the combination is extremely rare.
---
First and foremost 2* and up weapons are pretty rare in their own. Once you do get a 2* roll you have  4% chance to roll TS and a 14% chance to roll explosive. The probability of rolling both together is .05%. that's less than 1 for 200 every 2*/3* legendary that you kill..... assuming an equal distribution of the legendary perks.
---
Also means folks can wear eyewear/etc. without feeling gimped.  
---
Though then again eyewear usually gave bonus stats.  
---
I understand wanting to be heard mate. But let your thread speak for itself. If the majority agrees it will be upvoted. I don't even have a foot in the new server stuff because i have no intention of touching it. But super annoying trying to read peoples thread and seeing the same message spammed everywhere.
---
It won't do your message well like that.
---
It’s all good man don’t beat yourself up we all make mistakes. Crawlout to the fallout and relieve some stress!
---
What about all the achievements/trophies? That took a bit of extra work for me. 
---
Super Duper Mart robot has them every so often
---
Man this game really is making records 
---
Girl, you did great work.  Thanks!!
---
Honestly.....just disable to use of legendaries on survival servers.....or disable the Legendary effects while the Individual is on that server.  That way everyone is on equal ground only separated by their builds and their skill level.  This would actually create fun and compelling pvp. 
---
(Reaches out hand) Nooooooooooo! 😦
---
Honestly bro, I wasnt really serious i dont know why i made that response, I completely see where every is coming from
---
Oh good idea! I’ll go for the platinum!
---
I have tier 3 fireproof, I’ve been killed multiple times in one shot while being in passive mode. Be me and die to it before calling someone stupid?
---
That never moved lol but who needed those when you had Skooma!
---
I think it might be me. I have never been wanted on FO76 since I don't want to be a Raider but I do enjoy PvP. So I want to log into my session and decide today I will chill in my camp (Adventure) and not kill or be killed or today I want some PvP action (Survival) and just run around either getting killed or doing the killing. It depends on who is logged into PvP at that exact moment. That is the catch with PvP, some days the OP players are doing something else so you are the OP player that day. Other days you are the prey.
---
Bethesda is basically giving everyone what they wanted, PvE players can still PvE, PvP players can now PvP and griefers can go away since they can't harm PvE players anymore and PvP players will just kill them off (I am assuming Bethesda will change the current mode to full on PvE which to me makes sense).
---
If you power up a main plant then it will also power up the sub power stations connected to it. they will usually have the same name type...anyways, once this is done you can build a camp at one of the sub stations and use the power box that now has 100 power
---
Also suggest using sentinel and chameleon combined for concealed snipers.
---
Assassins legendary mod for melee players.
---
It will be interesting to see what they come up with for the new survival mode.
---
The idea of actually risking dropping one of your prized weapons or armor makes me cringe.
---
Massive gamble in you want to play with very rare gear.   
---
I’m looking to farm plastic that’s laying out in the world, I’ve served hopped 4 times and it’s all still gone.    Feels like it’s on a timer but the comment by the other dude suggests I need to pick up a ton of other shit so it’ll respawn.   
---
I was trying to sound pompous, I need to make my point clear, and I'm angry about it. 
---
I feel luck should always be a factor, in pvp and out of. Otherwise, it only comes down to hard numbers. Period. There needs to be a factor of luck, do you think pvp should just be high noon showdown style?
---
Would you mind explaining more? I searched all over the northeast part of the airport with no luck
---
You can kill ppl at level 5....
---
I found first TSE on 40+ level. So I agree
---
I cant craft one.  Just curious about upgrading for perks.  
---
And you'll get banned for having it in your inventory. 
---
I understand, I'm trying to be seen by Bethesda themselves more than anything, I know the majority of people here disagree with me, I am fighting a fight I feel is worth my effort, but it may be in vein. I'm so sorry.
---
I think that some guns should be better than others but should still be possible to get without farming.
---
Rifleman if you go semiautomatic / commando if you gonna go automatic receiver 
---
Did they not drop for you in the Miner Miracles Quest?
---
I can only speak for myself and yes, I only play PvE at the moment but the reasons for that are
---
1. Engaging in PvP is annoying to PvE players with no interest in PvP and you can't tell beforehand who is interested or not. The 'slap' mechanic sounds good on paper but sucks in real world
---
2. Griefers are active at present and all PvP players are grouped with the griefers and I am no griefer
---
3. The loot drops currently are a little unbalanced for PvP
---
Do I want dedicated PvP? yes. Do I play PvP today? No. Will I play PvP when this drops? Hell yes!
---
That doesn't make the point any different.....
---
Then that should tell you something
---
I totally skipped over the fact I had to scan my power armor in when I made it, and then proceeded to scrap it all in favor of a new set that was higher level
---
Sounds like Enclave propaganda to me
---
Some people want pvp
---
DMV building across from the Capital building has a lot of typewriters and a couple cameras.
---
I can sell you a plan for 750c. Gamertag?
---
Should be able to craft new one.
---
But you do you.
---
Rent a meme
---
My character is geared for PvP as well and I still hold this opinion. It is fine to have a different opinion but assuming others haven't "researched" or aren't "educating themselves" because you don't agree with an idea is small-minded.
---
From my understanding, less than 5% of players across ALL platforms have earned the achievement for killing 20 players. As a majority, your players DO NOT CARE ABOUT PVP. 
---
Why Bethesda is catering to 5% of their player base is absolutely beyond me. 
---
I understand the numbers are abysmal, and I am one of the lucky ones. But when farming, and most people were and still are doing Whitespring runs, I would average around 10-20 legendary weapons per hour, assuming some people have alot more time than I, a 24 hour farm would net about 240-480 legendary weapons, do this over the span of a few weeks and you will likely find at least one.
---
https://imgur.com/a/49CTAWd
---
There are a few snaptails at the Whitespring, near the clubhouse, around the source of the spring that flows down the golf course.
---
Brush up your pvp skills.
---
That's what this game is about apparantly.
---
Absolutely. Should the development team be making a survival mode, or making PVP usable though? I don't PVP because the incentives suck and the mechanics are awful. It's not because I can't shoot people. And a leader board? Fortnite 76 will be the next expansion at this rate.
---
People will complain about clipping and it looks bad on vids and screenshots 
---
I mean, that really is the answer isn't it. I'm just not going to play it. I don't feel like being a beta tester for this anyway.
---
Lol yeah it’s one shot or nothing in PVP now. Will be staying far away from that meta.
---
We were meant to be a control vault, not an experimental vault
---
We get the good shit
---
I needed to go see every vendor
---
Second life: Fallout edition 
---
Some PvE content that doesn't require power armor would be neato in my book.  The little bit of end-game there is in this game I just don't do because I hate PA, and using just a hazmat suit is out of the question.
---
I needed to see every vendor
---
Well if most players are like me then it is misleading to be honest. I have killed no-one in FO76. Looking at my stats will give you the idea that I hate PvP. I don't, I am really excited about this change. It means I can decide upfront to PvP and log into a session where everyone else consented to PvP upfront. I don't have to worry about pissing off PvE players that just want to have a fun adventure.
---
If they can introduce factions as part of this it would be brilliant, that why I can decide who to fight and who to leave alone even in PvP e.g. Raiders vs Responders. Maybe make the various faction controlled train stations safe havens for each faction.
---
Also make it so you can only belong to one main faction at a time in PvP.
---
Our shit was meant to be highly ceremonial. Look at all the PR work that went into it. I bet there wasn't a dedication ceremony for every vault!
---
I have a friend that had a 50 and swore by it. I traded for a Legendary Gatling. I loaned it to him and his primary for SBQ is a Gatling. It’s the best DPS heavy gun. All you need to check it is a show health mod and you can see which is getting more health in the same period of time
---
I'm sorry I came off that way, I meant what you were saying was stupid, not you, and that may be a bit harsh. Do you also have a dense armor mod on your chest? If you don't then that's why, but I've not been killed by any explosive weapon since these precautions were taken, the likely explanation is that you had a workshop under your control, or you might have been wanted without knowing it? There are also numerous bugs present of course, but it is intended to work the way it does. I don't know a link to the Bobblehead testing in passive mode, but I promise you it was proven to do little damage through slap.
---
Vault 76 may have been designed by Vault Tec, but oof was built by you, the good people of America. 
---
Not the Marine Tactical Helmet (the wetsuit mask). That's a legit item with a plan that can be found all over Cranberry Bog. The Marine Armor Helmet is the questionable one.
---
I'm running two and I wish I was running one. The damage increase doesn't seem that significant tbh. 
---
Just the same as 100% fall damage reduction doesn’t completely negate damage from falling. 100% values don’t negate shit, so how about you do the research?
---
Was one shotted today after a group of two snuck up on me. His buddy smacked one of my workshops to initiate pvp while his friend scopes me from a roof with a TSE. I didn’t even know I was in combat. Apparently it is “fun” to do this and take everyone’s junk. 
---
Look me up and I'll make one for you. PC IGN: jchamlin
---
Interesting. But not built? What's it matter. Not like they provide a bunch of cover.
---
DonBergas2001
---
Took me quite a while to realize what was happening when they would explode when I walked across them... i always thought I was being attacked or it was a glitch Haha 
---
No you didn't or you wouldn't of commented what you did. I am in no way connecting two unrelated things. Obviously you are truly the ignorant one  because you can not comprehend what I am saying. 
---
Yes but how often do 2* drop?
---
I would say 10% at best. So basically you would expect to get 1 TSE for every 2,000 3* legendaries that you kill. That doesn't factor in the shit TSE pipe rifle probability either.
---
I'm not saying that you didn't get your drop legit......sweet drop by the way. I'm just saying that the amount of people on these forums who say that they have several of these guns is bullshit, they have duped guns.
---
yep same for me, it's happened 3 times in the past week...
---
That’s what happens when players get bored, a lot of them inevitably turn to griefing.
---
Stay off the grass. 
---
But that goes against any MMO's typical loot formula, it would take away the fabled "god tier" rare items that keep the real hardcore players going.
---
My hope is they change Adventure mode to full on PvE, maybe leave workshops as PvP for some good reasons mentioned by others.
---
That way with each play session you can decide PvE or PvP today.
---
Did they really tho? I run a i7-4790 with a titan X (pre-pascal) and 32gb ram (not fast either) and I run everything on Ultra with some additional ini tweaks for more detail and dont have any performance issues, so im guessing its something at your end.
---
Just because nobody else agrees with your opinion, does not make it false.
---
None of the guys shown in that no clip documentary struck me as the type that play any games.
---
I just reinstalled windows and have the latest drivers installed.
---
Oh, I thought it was called marine wetsuit helmet, must go reevaluate my stash now 
---
I'm talking to the players that are complaining about certain things happening to them, that can be easily countered or mitigated. Especially explosive damage.
---
Some vaults weren't meant to open. 76 was supposed to be a big show. Like an advertisement. Seems silly it would need a parking lot except during construction tho. 
---
Do t know what type of weapon it was, but some dude one shotted the scorch beast queen I. The server I was in. That was nuts.
---
Well i have no suggestions personally,  just that if my seemingly worse setup can run the game at ultra, then that would indicate that something at your end must be the issue, or the game has some issues with some part of your setup.
---
It seems like it was in an area not so effected by the bombs as well, the others are near the savage divide and cranberry so they really took a hit to say the least. 
---
I'll reinstall, see if that helps
---
I did leave out that I also have dodgy. The 30% ap reduction to avoid damage closes the gap to 100%.
---
This perfect example of the Brilliant minds at Beth working hard to come up with a PVP system everyone hates. 
---
There was nothing fancy about that CAMP likely her first one and took her hours to get the materials and make. 
---
You guys are laughing at her even as she cries you keep on destroying her base. wow. now you have the nerve to brag post about this for Karma while pretending you are sorry.
---
I will leave it at that...you know what you are and the rules require I be civil.
---
I came across them twice in the white spring bunker today 
---
Turn off mic and use chat mod.
---
That is indeed true.  
---
I worry about the split attention from the dev team as they ‘beta’ the new pvp servers and spend time evaluating, planning, and considering feedback, which will naturally diverge from the base version.  This will cause a significant diversion of resources before they even have the fundamental game working cleanly....
---
I don't need any mod, I can do math. Let's ignore mods and legendary affixes. My base .50 cal with only perks enhancing the damage does 66 damage per bullet. My stock gatling does 132. So in order for the .50 cal to do more damage it has to shoot more than twice as fast... which it **more** than does.
---
Now if you take into consideration mods, the gatling gun can overtake the .50 if you have the prime receiver but for all intents and purposes the .50 cal has the higher dps potential. 
---
When you block everyone on the map
---
I'd be a bit suspicious if I saw the big ceremony on TV and then they shuffled me into some cave when it came to my vault
---
That would be almost indefinitely unhelpful. The other user's point was that the subreddit is an echo chamber of biased ideas. You are essentially telling them to walk into an NRA rally and express why guns are bad and how they should be banned.  
---
By making a post that's pro-transfer all they would achieve is getting massive downvotes from the biased echo chamber this subreddit is and making it appear to the outside observer that your stance is more favorable. In reality, the bulk of the player base may be totally okay with the transfer, so they feel no need to come to the subreddit and complain unlike those who are opposed to the idea. The people who are upset about this are more likely to be vocal and complain versus those who are okay with it.  
---
Your suggestion is disingenuous and won't actually add anything beneficial to the conversation. It will only further your agenda. The only honest way Bethesda could collect feedback on this topic without the groupthink and peer pressure of the community on others, would be implementing an in-game vote upon login for all players. This way every active player could have their opinion without the influence of a mob mentality and fear for acceptance of their peers in the community.
---
It reeks of a quick cash grab asset flip. There was some care put into the art but it seems like not a fuck was given about the game play itself.
---
Just take out legendaries altogether, for a true survival experience. Nerf mobs if necessary.
---
They could make it faction based. If you belong to the same faction you can't harm other players in the same faction except if you go Rogue and that should be and explicit menu choice and not something done by accident with shooting damage.
---
Also it will make a Queen fight way more interesting if 2 factions show up for the same Queen and resources, so you kill one another (Faction vs Faction) while killing the Queen. That will be my kind of fun for sure. Plus faction members can't harm one another and work together in that moment.
---
You need to add actual group content. Right now multiplayer is just a gimmick because all the content can be done solo. We need a reason to play with a group that's actually rewarding.
---
Pardon me old chap, but the wall holding the toilet paper seems to have been obliterated. Have you any to spare?
---
Master race people take it too far. The Xbox community is nice as well, I've only had less than a handful of greifers and people just being jerks. (outside of legendary farming then people get a little crazy) I'm not sure if there's anything that you can do about it. People on Xbox usually send shitty messages so you can report those for foul language and what not but the best you can hope for (as far as I know) is just banning them from session and just letting them have their moment or something. Those people will soon be in the pvp only servers I'm sure and you can enjoy the game in a nice coop setting. Hopefully. 
---
Perhaps they met at Roachella.
---
True, but it does mean the large majority of people playing this game disagree with you. In order for a game to survive it will need to cater to its playerbase. FO76s player base doesn't want this.
---
Hey thanks, sent friend request! IGN tarazaaku
---
You’re right. It’s actually 97 percent.
---
Bethesda.net has no way to view achievements, so we can only guess for PC. However, 3.6% of PlayStation players and 3.07% of Xbox players have the achievement for killing 20 other players. That’s a provable claim.
---
I think typically limited time events are called as such to create a fear of missing out, then they jack the price up just enough where they hope you’ll spend $5 real cash as you won’t have the time to grind out the atoms. F2P model games do this all the time to keep the money rolling in.
---
You’re ignoring DR, and that’s probably the most important thing when it comes to the SBQ. Because of that, it’s easiest to look at the damage numbers per 10 shots, then math out your fire rates. When you do it that way, the Gatling gun is higher DPS. 
---
And if you add into it the decondition rate per unit of time, the Gatling gun comes out on top again
---
A lot of you are so pissed off about this new mode... just don’t play it??  I understand the criticisms about dupers &amp; legendaries being In this mode, but if you don’t like pvp just stay in adventure mode
---
Remember about four months ago when we thought that was what the game would be? Happier times.
---
There were no experimental vaults ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I’m not calling you stupid but I do think you are misinformed. The “I’ve been one shot by slap damage” line you used is a disproven myth, just like the trade steal exploit. There is an actual cap on slap damage done. There’s videos of people with weapons that do 120k damage and they could never do more than 5hp per shot on an unflagged player.
---
This might seem contrary to what everyone believes, because it is. Everyone and their mom is convinced that they’ve been one shot with pacifist on, but the truth is most people don’t understand the flagging mechanics of this game. Workshop flagging, for example, will flag the owner *no matter where they are* on the map, allowing one person to activate a player’s workshop and then the second player easily headshots the owner. It’s happened to me, and one time the pair even explained it later.
---
Anyone on your team that doesn’t have pacifist will flag the whole team if a stray bullet hits someone at the SBW or Whitesprings. Go look at how many of the “I was one shot in pacifist” reports happen in those two places.
---
This Reddit should be someone’s social science thesis. There is an insane amount of misinformation being spread as the confirmed truth despite proof. It turns out, just as is the case in every human endeavor, that people will believe a lot that’s simply said without actually relying on their own reasoning and evidence. 
---
If they did private servers the game would die, there is zero chance 
---
It's free real estate 
---
If that blows your mind, you’d be amazed at the other things they haven’t fixed yet. 
---
it was aslo a very public vault kinda one the people could see and think "all" vaults must be like this one
---
How'd you get the blue lights? 
---
Love the build btw!
---
Didn’t know this until a couple hundred hours into 4
---
Sucks that you've had this experience but I've never come across this kind of thing ever. A few griefers but they were kind of adorable and very easy to avoid.
---
Might be that you've just had some back luck dude.
---
I appreciate that all headgear is only cosmetic.
---
Anyone played Skyrim?
---
“I just spent 30 minutes making my character look awesome! (Finds helmet) Guess I have to wear this now”
---
No one is missing out by not having stats on helmets. Everyone’s potential stats are the same and no one is weaker because they wanted to look a certain way. I definitely prefer this.
---
Imagine if you couldn’t wear your outfit over your armor (like Fallout 4). People would complain that they have to sacrifice stats just to look the way they want.
---
Bethesda just can’t win with some people. But this decision was a good one, so props to Beth.
---
I can see Vault Tech Appalachia automated their marketing department
---
To be fair, rolling in a team vs playing solo has always been advantageous in survival games.
---
Take Rust or 7 days to die. It's pretty much mandatory to roll together with other players.
---
Still, I agree with the points on getting murdered during quests or while at a vendor. If you're gonna have PvP you pretty much have to either eliminate quests and vendors altogether or create safe zones where PvP can't happen (like around train stations). You can't have both in survival games
---
Eh. I wouldn't say it's bad on PC. Sure, you get an ocassional griefer but it's nothing I've seen too much in my 400 hours.
---
Don't you have a.phone? ;)
---
Hahaha, never been so sad!
---
"one of the most iconic imageries in internet meme history" 
---
uh....
---
There's mad tips and their easily searchable.. so what were you hoping to find
---
Alrighty, I think Esrange#2441 should work then.
---
lol. I may wait awhile. I’m only lvl 22. Today a deathclaw was stalking me all around the area between Morgantown and Grafton. I think it may have been glitched. Wouldn’t take damage the first half a dozen times I shotmot or melee. Then took damage just before it killed me. Same lvl. 
---
1*Lead Pipes and 1*Rolling Pins, today I got two completely empty and two just had ammo. Not to mention i’ve got a flare gun once and several drills. and if its armor its a 1* wood piece. 
---
I know where everyone is coming from because I have seen it, everyone has, I've seen it on the market sub. And I know why it is hard to believe ANYONE in regards to their gear. The weapons have been duped into oblivion, there, I said it.  And not just those weapons, god tier armor as well. These are peoples concerns and I understand. I just, once again am feeling cheated because of the exploiters. The nerf to TSE is the first blow, and now people are trying to say I shouldn't even be able to use it when this game "evolves." I say that because many players like myself want a more pvp experience integrated into Fallout from the start. I want players to always be dangerous and killable. Unpredictable. So we will make this mode our new home. It will suck having to play adventure mode if we want our characters we've built up.
---
I am ignoring DR, because I did several tests and armor piercing (on the deathclaws and mirelurks I tested on) did 0 extra damage. Tested with two lvl 5 .44 pistols and also tested with armor pen perks. Now it's entirely possible that I was bugged at the time, but currently until I see evidence of DR changing anything I don't believe its working.
---
Just add her drop table to the event rewards. 
---
" 6.8% completed scorched earth " really????? its a shame..
---
The reddit subs are a small sample of the playerbase though.
---
350hours played, thats not definetly even partly questing lol.
---
Compare it to a 200 DR SBQ. 
---
I honestly fail to see how survival mode will alleviate any of the lack of content for end game players. After the two or three first player you've killed, you will end up in the exact same position, being that survival is essentially just the same as normal mode without the slap mechanism.
---
Add to that this game is completely unbalanced for pvp, and surely this new mode will be as much bugged as the main mode. It will be a one-shot kill fest that will fail to retain any interest after a very short time. 
---
Links?  Everything I was coming up with was not very helpful
---
You can easily one shot players with non legendary gear just gotta know what your doing so unless pvp balance is changed level 20 or level 200 it doesn't matter
---
Don't rush the game and power level/grind. You're only sprinting towards a late game crawl.
---
Take your time, soak in all that an area has to offer and especially early game lean more on melee than ranged to save on rounds.
---
Past the level cap and still finding myself using melee at times and my build is mostly a ranged one.
---
It's just another v. Fast weapon that doesn't do enough alpha damage to penetrate armor effectively because of the way damage is calculated. 
---
If you can get it for $30 or so, pick it up. It's worth it at that point.
---
If tse is nerfed, considering new players would always enter PvP servers against higher levels, isn't it a Hobson's choice?
---
Yeah lets loose even more shit, i am level 180. Thats good amound of caps to lose. This was waste of time, but ppl requested shit like this, congratz idiots.
---
Massive did a pretty good job with survival in the division. Probably the best activity in the game from my perspective. No idea how it works in 76, I'm just subscribed to this sub for the sweet sweet schadenfreude, but it doesn't sound like anything like the example of survival that nailed it.
---
I understand. It wasn't my intention to be disingenuous at all, I do want to know everyone's stance on this, that's why I made the suggestion, not to be a dick just to see what the other side thought. I'm still rather new to Reddit so the echo chamber aspect of it was something new to me as well. I would love a in game voting option. 
---
Way to give support!
---
If TSE was nerfed and duping had either never happened or something was gone about it, I likely wouldn't complain. 
---
A lot of these things are the reason I'm still staying away from 76 since launch. Being a big energy weapon fan, seeing what they did to them is a disgrace.
---
Are you playing borderless window? There were issues in the past with it vs fullscreen mode.
---
The true husband 
---
Just searching for fallout 76 tips will bring you to a bunch of articles with basic information. I don't have the time to do that for you. If you have specific questions I'm sure someone here could answer them. 
---
There's just a lot in the game and a lots been written about it 
---
While part of me agrees with this, I fully plan on abandoning the normal servers when this is enabled and would like to keep my current character, I've put a lot of time and effort into it. A 1-time, 1-way transfer would be nice. At the end of the day the gear characters currently have is going to be obtainable anyway.
---
Dense chest mod plus fireproof rank 2 has eliminated explosive damage entirely for me *even while I am flagged for PvP*. I’m able to close the distance while being hit and shotgun their faces to oblivion. I have tested this personally. Have you?
---
Not exactly contributing to the conversation, but yeah, the game needs some work.
---
No, Bethesda wrote the rules of the game to allow people to play how they want.  However, you can block players, including their audio, through the social menu.
---
Typically I would have bought it for the PC but I was anticipating my brother-in-law and I to be playing together so I got it for the PS4.  He decided to play Just Cause 4 instead.  
---
I'd be willing to hazard a guess that the PS4 player is more mature, overall, than players on the Xbox or PC.  It used to be that the mature game players were on the PC but that's changed as gaming laptops have become more common.  From my limited experience, a lot of the grade school kids are playing on the Xbox and college kids are playing on gaming laptops. 
---
So far, I've had a good experience on the PS4, similar to you.   Having a welcoming environment draws in more players of different ages, genders, etc. who have different styles which makes the game more fun to play. 
---
&gt; Most of the PvP mechanics on fo76 I see similar to other top grossing games.
---
Yes, like the horribly balanced weaponry combined with lopsided RNG loot drops. And player death either meaning nothing or losing hours upon hours of time gathering reaources. Just like all the other top grossing games like... none of them because that makes for shit PvP gameplay.
---
Duping exploits aren't going away for a while, so best we can hope for is stopping bobbleheads stacking and weapon nerfs
---
Only 21.95% of players on Xbox have reached level 25.
---
32.14% have killed another player.
---
Only 5% have launched a nuke.
---
I don't think your argument is valid, *at all.*
---
Nice try though. You spin those numbers.
---
I’m happy with what I’ve got out of the game. I’m dissatisfied with the direction of the game. And if they want to keep me and other players and get us to buy atoms, then they better release quality content to keep us here.
---
It’s not a mmo, everyone just treats it like one, and perception is reality after all.
---
I got a glitched Flatwoods Monster once, it was stuck in T-pose after it died, so I got a real good look at it; it's definitely a Zetan. Specifically, a Zetan wearing goggles under its helmet, and in some sort of hover suit. You can even blow off its "belly" armor and see its legs in the suit. 
---
Short version, I would think it would count as an alien kill.
---
Take a hint dude. Your perspective isn't popular in the community. Saying over and over isn't going to change that fact. 
---
If it's popular enough and enough people want it, it'll make traction. You know. much like the posts where people DON'T want characters to carry over.
---
Sorry, meant done*, not gone. Just want something done, ya know? 
---
General tips tho are to pay attention to scrap needed to craft ie repair things. Keep an eye out for these things. Playing blocks = lead etc
---
Get perks that reduce scrap needed to craft. Get blocker level 3 if you want survive melee mobs. 
---
Weight reduction perks are amazing but learning to not rely on them opens you.up to more play styles
---
I definitely agree with this, my regular armor bonuses greatly outweigh what my power armor has to offer.
---
I would go a bit further. 
---
1.  Your character moves over only if you are unencumbered and have ALL PERKS unequipped. The move will not be allowed otherwise. This is a set number say 300. Think wisely as nothing in your STASH comes with you and no wt reduction perks apply
---
2.  All legendary weapons/armor in your inventory are recreated exactly as they now are but with all Legendary effects nullified.  The weapons have the effects listed but crossed out, so that when moving back to an Adventure server they return to normal.  The over-encumbered rule is to prevent people from moved 10000000 lbs of stuff with them.
---
People keep their character and build. Dupers will be greatly limited to what they can take with them and no OP God weapons to be seen unless you find them on the PVP server.
---
* Otherwise have all equipment, inventories and STASH separate. You keep your character but you log into the PVP server at V&amp;^ with only Starter character equipment.  
---
either will work if duping is finally stopped somehow.
---
The way they've structured it seems like they want us to level up and gear our characters in Adventure and then hop to a survival server when we want to pvp.
---
Sounds nice on paper, but falls flat as soon as you think about it for 30 seconds. It's sad that I see this happening after every Bethesda update. "Here's our idea." "This is what you need to fix with it."
---
I am starting to doubt whether they even have "devs" there. It's like it's just a bunch of programmers spitballing and then fixing the errors that the real devs, us, find in them. And before even having to touch the build, no less. Took me all of 30 seconds after reading the article to come to these conclusions and I'm sure OP and I aren't nearly alone in that. 
---
I'm in your camp I have a quad explosive radium rifle that I have based my entire build around......I don't want my gun or yours to be nerfed. That's what Fallout is. I didn't spend all that time grinding for a pipe rifle.
---
I actually do have a TSE that minigun but believe it or not I bought it from a vendor bot at the Sutton station. Deep down I know it's gotta be a dupe. Who would sell a TSE minigun w/15% faster reload to a vendor for 200 caps?....... anyhow I popped some grape mentats and loaded my bargain perk card and got it for 561 caps. It's fun to play without and I do bring it to SBQ fights but I'm a solo player and don't PvP nor is my character built for heavy guns so I never use it.
---
well goodluck when you get there :) have fun!
---
Come for the schadenfreude, stay for the "it's really not that bad, it's actually pretty damn fun"
---
So you want to be able to trade easily crafted ammo directly for xp in a game where manhours have been spent to block people from grinding xp by building things with workshop resources? 
---
but the worst thing is: they ruin my two shot (non explosive) gaus gun in the name of the pvp. what nobody want...
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRty1VULeJ8&amp;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRty1VULeJ8&amp;)
---
so true.  I remind myself daily that I keep playing this game for what it will one day become, not for what it is now.
---
My artillery haven't worked for a little while but I figured maybe it was just where my camp is. Everytime I throw a flare down it says "No Artillery Available". It is powered and is range but it doenst work.
---
Have used them before plenty of times in other places but hasn't worked for a while.
---
and the worst part is F76 still looks like  a game from 2010 on PC
---
THIS
---
Screw you dude, the water is freezing, I'll grunt if I want.
---
I never discovered it in 4.  LOL
---
If you are talking about your turrets, makes sure that they aren't broken.  To do that, click on your C.A.M.P. (or each turret individually) and see if the repair option becomes highlighted.  If you click on your C.A.M.P., you should be able to repair all.
---
Also, if you don't have enough power they won't work.  Do they have a red lightning bolt (not enough power) or a green lightning bolt?  If they are red, your power level is too low.  Add up all of the power requirements and check the total power output of your generators.
---
Finally, you might just have to go into build mode, store them all, and then place and reconnect them.
---
Charleston I would assume since it's so fucked.  but I guess it's hard time tell. 
---
Tens of thousands of people with less than 20 kills isn't exactly a good argument for focusing on PvP. Just saying. I'm fine with the mode because I doubt it's going to take a lot of resources to implement, and they're gonna have to figure out servers having different rules eventually anyway. Even if the PvPers are a vast minority I don't see any harm in giving them what's essentially slightly modified servers. 
---
He's also been copy pasting the same screed in half of the posts in the subreddit, whether it actually applies or not
---
It could give the same buffs as bubblegum but weigh .01
---
Nice enough concept, but not everyone that plays the game can play every day of the week. So one day for trade wouldn't be fair to the people that couldn't get on that day for whatever reason. 
---
The Survival PvP mode makes carrying too much aid a liability. 
---
Mine doesn't say anything at all. Camp is in white springs tho
---
Did they hire this guy yet?
---
You will get 50 to 150h of gameplay (which is fine) before it gets old (no endgame content). After that, looking at the pace they're updating the game, I fear you will have to wait several months/year before seeing anything of real interest. It's fun for the low price you can get the game if you like to explore and follow a background story. The overall feeling of the game is subpar for the quality expected of an AAA title, the aged engine struggles to handle multiplayer and it feels, and many quality of life features that should be in the game from the start are yet to be added.
---
Dang. I took me ages to find the Power armor station plans as well but I now have some spare to give to people that need it but I am on PC. Sorry.
---
I’d just settle for not losing my workshop every hour when I get booted from the server
---
That was the best one yet...... nice work. Stay frosty....lol
---
You have any other samples to go off of? If not, this is the best we have. I think a few thousand players is a good enough sample size to get a general estimate of what the player base wants.
---
People are complaining because the "big boys"will get to go back and forth between servers and basically eliminate the whole idea of risk involved in the first place.
---
No reality is reality, if you happy why are damming something before you’ve even tried it. The other thing is you can choose not to play it. You can choose to play the current mode of the game. If you were saying they should focus more on several stability and killin Bugs I could of gotten behind you. 
---
But no your telling them where they should put there resources. Anyone who makes content could tell you the easy way to create content is to let the fan base do it themselves( ex.pvp) 
---
Thanks everyone, I have the plans now
---
Wow!  Well done.  Please flag this for our Bethesda residents so they can pass it directly to the devs.
---
Well - I'd love to be the former... but clearly this isn't as obviously sarcastic as I thought it was. So I guess I'm stuck with the latter.  ;\^)
---
The first exploding sandbag in FO 4 scared the sh*t out of me back then. And I'm still having a brief moment of 'What the...' when they do that in 76... 
---
I doubt they're focusing on it mainly because I highly doubt that it takes much to implement. Let them throw the PvPers a (hopefully) easy to do bone. If/when the PvP servers are abandoned they'll hopefully take the hint. 
---
Your statement is patently and demonstrably false. Went and dug up the baseball bat plan, searing puncturing rocket modded it, and the damage is 163, vs all rise at 207. I can't calculate the armor piercing, flaming, limb damage, chance to cripple personally, but if you can, please feel free to show the class. I know for a fact the armor piercing doesn't add over 20% damage against a  high armor target, let alone a low armor target. I compared a sledge hammer to all rise at one point and it was strictly inferior for lack of the impressive searing puncturing rocket mod, which I had never looked closely at.
---
You know, you could always just not play survival mode.
---
This is what I thought on looks but by the red zone it’s pretty nuked and there higher enemies. Got me thinking that it isn’t clear 
---
I'd take that job honestly.
---
Idk man, from what I’ve seen in film, which as we know is always 100% accurate, those decontamination scrub downs are kinda brutal.
---
Nowhere. That's the joke of the game. The countryside was safe, but we killed ourselves. 
---
Closest thing to a nuke was David Thorpe, the leader of the Cutthroat Raiders using a mini nuke to crack the dam &amp; flood Charleston to punish the Responders in the mistaken belief they had killed his girlfriend Rose. Otherwise it was the scorched. 
---
Maybe, maybe not. I've seen loads of players that would like the mode.
---
But I like my fire ax for my firebeather character :(
---
You should spawn at a random place near a fast travel point so that it's harder to fast travel camp. The camper could find that someone spawns right behind them
---
Life is full of twists and turns.
---
You have contracted rad worms.
---
I'd be down for that. 
---
If they did no legendaries, I'd be fine with full loot PVP.
---
Texas Red is an amazing idea for this game, but I personally think it could reach it's full potential as an event for everyone to participate in.
---
And I want it to be as good as my all rise, or my friends deathclaw gauntlet! It should be. It deserves to be.
---
I ought to do some of these story missions hahaha 
---
Your issue reminds me of a bug in FO4.  Trashcan Carla’s brahman was dead in my Sanctuary settlement.  Each time I fast traveled there, the carcass would move a few inches. With 1400hrs of gameplay, I watched it go from my workstation to the cul-de-sac...  Your camp might be getting moved just enough to clip the border.
---
I love it. I use pipe rifles, and the damage isn't huge, so I'm happy to waste the first couple of shots bringing the accuracy up to 95% and I just pop into they drop. 
---
It's for the sake of cosmetics, I suppose. Many players (like me) don't like wearing headgear and are fashion conscious when they do.
---
&gt; This is also just the beginning of the conversation.
---
Lol do y'all want to finish up one of these conversations at any point with some kind of, I don't know, satisfactory resolution? Fuckin' aye.
---
theres a spot you can get lead and acid north of the bear in the south, placing the camp on the side of a mountain, but 2 scorch beasts every 5 minutes make it a rough spot. pretty much have to build everything in the cave or it will get destroyed.
---
It would have to be a reoccurring weekly trade day. I do get what you’re saying though. It could honestly be a permanent 24/7 thing, at least with vending machines. The player trade concept would need to have a designated day though for those who choose to trade in person. 
---
Read the responses 
---
And then those players try that new mode for a brief moment and stop playing because pvp isnt their thing anyway. While we, who heavily invested in pvp gear wont play because we dont want to spend so much time gearing/leveling again for pvp. Result; no one plays survival mode. Dont listen to those casuals pls. Its the endgame players that need this survival endgame mode. Or you will lose players to other games. Just because people were too lazy to invest in pvp gear they want to drag down everyone with them.
---
Woah, you're like the architect from the matrix. I played through and tried to pay attention to but from one day to the next I would often think 'why am I doing this again'.
---
Sure, why not?! I can go out and shoot a ghoul with a bullet and get 30xp, so why not cut out the middleman and just trade the bullet for 30xp directly?
---
Although you DO have a point... since ammo is so easily crafted why not just give us the XP for the ammo that we *would* have crafted?
---
(Seriously tho' - just joke - or, as it turns out apparently, a pretty damn terrible joke.)
---
Well if I was wrong I’m sure I would’ve received more downvotes than upvotes right? I mean it is the player population that reads this sub. You’ve yet to mention anything that supports the opposite.
---
Clearly dupers have not tried.
---
I have been 1 shot from "slap dmg" because of how many bobbleheads and drinks and drugs some dupers have been on.
---
So I dont buy it that you have 'never been killed' -- but whatever you gotta say.
---
Nah. I'm good. I just want private servers and mods.
---
but weapons r ruined in pve mode too to provide pvp experience...
---
Bet you your 'Follow the Overseers Journey' missions is still active ;)
---
95% Accuracy with Melee in VATS, Nose to nose with opponent, swing viciously and not one hit registers then proceeds to a huge lag spike that once restored to the correct frame shows i have been shot over 1000x times and have been ragdolled 2km's into the air, Spent over 100hrs on this Melee build to find out the game cant even register melee properly... Sweet, still fun once the hit actually registers and the true potential of the build is recognised but yeah cool....
---
Like sheep to the slaughter.. 
---
At least no one will claim griefing in this mode.
---
They have been warned. =/
---
Again, I’ve literally been one shot, no bounty or PvP initiated with passive mode on. I stream everything and I’m not gonna go back and watch something I’ve already experienced but you’re more than welcome to scroll through and see. No slap damage. No PvP. No bounty. Just someone who is doing something better than all of you have “disproven” walking up to me and shooting me and killing me in one hit. 
---
Oh yeah, they took their good will and just lit that shit on fire.
---
yes I don't like this idea. make em separate and tweak loot tables so legendaries are scarcer. 
---
You don't think that level 5 with a pipe pistol a 150lb carry weight and a pick lock perk card has a chance against Sentinel armor and a TSE?
---
had nothing but positive experiences on PC since beta. shrug.
---
complain just like every other end game for an online game 
---
It's common practice to not publicly acknowledge exploits until After they've been fixed. 
---
I think I’ll skip that
---
True. Better than nothing. I see it as the more they work at it, the better it could potentially be.
---
**I'm not making a new character for every "flavor" of server that comes out.**  None of my friends will either.
---
If you insist on the most "hardcore" server possible........they will eventually be empty and Bethesda will shut it down.  H1Z1 had super hardcore servers, that were empty, until Daybreak shut them down completely.  DayZ Vanilla (the most hardcore mod) had the LEAST number of players of any mod in the entire DayZ community.  So by all means, keep pushing for purist hardcore ideas.  Your PVP servers will be dead and gone in 6-12 months.
---
Or you could chill.  Let them implement.  Give meaningful feedback on how to make the PVP better and more enjoyable for everyone.........not just the hardcore.
---
PVP needs a rebalance, right now it's severely in favor of LOWER levels.  Having a fully decked out character that's 100 levels above your opponent is a DISADVANTAGE.
---
Ok
---
No Charleston is fucked because the damn broke, that's why we have the lake bed exposed
---
I agree.
---
this gave me a headache
---
I never said I dislike the idea of it, I dislike that we are getting this before we are getting other more important changes. Changes that it seems, with what I’ve read on this sub, are wanted more than a PvP mode at the time.
---
Modt of you people complaining are the ones that spent the last 3 months running around in passive mode hoarding duct tape and perking for weight reduction.
---
Discount Captain America
---
It's not 100%, seems to effect some more than others, all I know for sure is the "LifeSigns" effect is not supposed to effect everyone, just the wearer of the mod.
---
????...
---
Do you even English bro?
---
because it's an area effect "spell" without a condition check!
---
VATS does a different effect, does not appear to be an area effect spell that triggers / repeats.
---
Hmmm, I seem to remember 11/14/18....
---
if they put in a scoreboard then someone is going to care about it
---
The .22 is the best gun for PvP in RDO
---
The thing is it only has happened in the nuke zone. I found it strange honestly. After the third time I don't know what to believe. 
---
nobody figth fir workshop just hop server if ocupied. and simple no point to have worksop when u get the needed plans.
---
That was your choice, cool armor is cool and I'm glad you like what you got.
---
That being said, game mechanics should not be based on issues like this. It's about what's good for the entire player base and new players in the future, not what's good for the subset of the players who grind hundreds of hours.
---
No idea how to finish that
---
I have a pvp dedicated character that is min maxed as well, but that means I'd immediately have a huge advantage to a lot of people. I feel you on not wanting to redo the whole thing but I feel like it's necessary for balance. 
---
The queen was killable well before TSE became so widespread. TSE is not that effective against her because she has obscenely high explosive resistance.
---
I've provided Bethesda with the exact formID's of a few dozen bugs / broken items / issues, generally radio silence.  
---
There is not a way to upload a plugin to them...  
---
Hoping the detailed notes are enough and maybe a community manager will notice and respond.
---
Raiders, raiders never change!
---
I'm fine with separate stashes for both game modes.
---
Heck I'd even be fine with full loot PVP if they had separate stashes :)
---
Not crying but only sharing an opinion. You are correct this is the internet and people like you reply thinking they are clever.
---
Not suggesting it's the cause of all the instability since the most recent update, but I think it's the cause of the Instability specifically linked to the Targeting mod.
---
I’m not trying to invalidate your experience.
---
I’m really trying to say this: there’s proof of this not happening for unflagged players with TSEs or bobble head/magazine stacking to damage levels above 200k per shot.
---
Its totally possible that there’s an unknown exploit and/or error behind it however. But everyone is blaming TSEs and most recently bobble head stacking. I personally hate the “one god roll” combo being the end all for every build and hate dupers too, but all the blame for these one shot kills on these things might actually be diverting attention to the real exploit behind these one shot claims.
---
Also the pve comments seem to be a strawman? I didn't see any of that in what I wrote or what anyone else said. 
---
I also thought up north by the space station. I can't think of many other big craters. Plus that area (whatever it's called) seems the most visually effected.
---
Ash heap is fucked but seems like capitalism did that before the war. 
---
This is actually a great question. Maybe they were thev were the nukes we got to use. Since they're obviously weaker maybe the Chinese never dropped a bomb on Appalachia
---
I’ve been disconnected 3 times in the past 5 minutes.  
---
I'm fine with no legendaries in PVP mode :)
---
NP.  
---
Example, I use Berry Mentats all the time without issues, however lastnight I had them running while I ran into a Nuked WhiteSprings, with a dozen players and all the hostile NPC's it could daisy chain off of...
---
how exactly do I flag it?
---
Yup
---
Damn shame you were all unable to find the hunted radio station that’s been in the game since BETA huh.
---
PS. You’re allowed to have an opinion, but typically voicing an unpopular opinion will net you some backlash, that’s how Circlejerk works.
---
I agree with pretty much everything, except saying the Ripper and Buzzblade are useless.
---
I've gotten my Buzzblade up to 60 damage per hit and I'm not even spec's for it. It can shred.
---
ok thank you
---
Probably not for the same reasons at all actually. 
---
NEIN! But i do gass. You want sum?
---
No, obviously the most advantageous order is in order of acquiring, with the most recent being at the bottom, that way you know exactly where it’s gonna be...
---
I'm impressed and **amazed** that you figured this out. I've been using X-01 with a Targeting HUD basically 24/7 and I noticed a MAJOR increase in crashes while playing in Watoga or Whitesprings, both locations that are filled with NPCs and usually players. This would definitely explain why I seem to crash every 15 minutes or less, sometimes as soon as I finish loading into the server.  
---
I noticed it was more common in Watoga as I was moving across the city, no doubt when it was loading in new Protectrons it was transferring the effect to them and causing me to crash. My friends in my team seemed to crash more just playing with me as well.  
---
Thank you so much for figuring this out! I'm going to wear a different set of Power Armor until this gets fixed.
---
Only place in the game I've found a wedding ring so far. :)
---
Well I can’t tell you how or what they did to kill me. I just know it was a two shot explosive and that’s recorded on my stream, it’s really clear when you hear one shot being fired with two bullet exploding on your face and dying instantly, not even with a chance to revive. I’m just quick to assume bobbleheads stacking because of duping it just makes the most sense.
---
Ill buy 2 X01 calibrated shocks on xbox 1 for 1000 caps and a jetpack, or 2250 caps flat. Let me know if you wanna trade.
---
I saw a suggestion that you can swap between modes with your character, but your inventory is separate for each mode. I think that’s a reasonable idea, especially if duping has been stopped. If not, it’s all a moot point. 
---
Why does the PC breed more negative players in your opinion?
---
Carebear
---
Of that, I am aware. 
---
However, she also seemed to be (from my memory), easier to kill overall. I think she received a damage resistance buff shortly after the second mass influx of duping.
---
Regression to the mean.
---
Fallout will regress back to its roots and the PvP players will regress back to shooting each other in a Red Dead Redemption.
---
I like the idea that there is some fiction involved with swapping out cards. Maybe not as annoying as it currently is but making a choice between going all out combat vs crafting vs survival SHOULD be a choice you make.
---
I'm for having perk loadouts available in-game but not to make non-combat perks always active or cost 0.
---
Bethesda is my real target here, they need to see everyone is not ok with them rolling over on the masses whim.
---
The Grafton area was confirmed to be pollution of some kind from large companies and farms.
---
“Knows how to defend themselves and avoid conflict”
---
So a puss, basically then.
---
if you look outside of this reddit into other communities, there are a lot of people who like pvp. you just cant talk about it here or your post gets hidden from downvoting within minutes
---
God PLZ!! This is the thing I have wanted most. Just straight private servers with customizable settings (loot scaling, level scaling/difficulty, health and AP regen settings, thirst and hunger settings, food and perishable decay rate settings and all that).  Also to jump start with modders delivering content to inject into our servers to play with and do more things with while waiting between content patches or events that are off in the horizon.
---
The scorched killed everyone, not the nukes.. how did anyone miss that during the story?
---
I disagree there is plenty of time for people to adjust their builds before survival comes out. No excuse for joining it with a lvl one or un optimized buid.
---
A couple large craters near Monorail elevator. Could be something to do with nukes and also gives radiation. 
---
Hopefully one of the community managers sees this, maybe through the pings? Either way, keep posting this! They need to see it. Once the stuff about the half baked "survival mode" calms down, it should be easier to get attention 
---
I gotta do these story missions... They for sure paint the corporate greed picture pretty well.
---
 Hornwright this hornwright that!
---
Tin can man, u made it bad, its war \*pulling out gun\* that never change.
---
That’s all I really want.
---
Guarantee y'all asking for a clean slate will not actually play this mode.   Guarantee gold sellers will be there selling weapons again. Guarantee TSE weapons are already getting nerfed. Guarantee y'all are dumb as fuck on this sub lol
---
Rdr did it
---
only 2.2% reached level 100. These numbers are skewed because many people tried it and quit outright
---
It’s to the point where I’m scared to claim anything that doesn’t respawn after disconnect. I want to grind and put the time in but it’s impossible with the current state Bethesda has the game. 
---
Changes that this mode should have for a serious pvp experience
---
1: players cannot see each other on the map unless teammates
---
2: No fast travel period
---
3: legendaries should just be removed altogether
---
4: small area around vault 76 is a no pvp area so people cant spawn camp.
---
5: separate save files so everyone has a equal start
---
6: enemy level be based on area, not by highest level player
---
Fair enough, I apologize I think I may have come across a bit more accusatory and aggressive than needed. I personally understand your stance and generally agree with you. But I myself also am a part of the echo chamber and in an attempt to try to be unbiased feel I overcompensated a bit.   
---
Just a side note for you, every single reddit I have ever been a part of for any community game, media, or otherwise tends to be an echo chamber of people screaming the same opinions then high fiving each other about how great their same opinions are. It feels wonderful when you scream the opinion or agree with it, but those who disagree are chastised and attacked until they leave or become silent and simply lurk. This is not the type of environment that encourages civil discourse, but only breeds a circle-jerk mentality that only gets stronger.  
---
Have your opinions, post them, stick to them but hear others out. Don't allow others like me or individuals that disagree with you to silence you! But also consider everyone else's thoughts too :)
---
I see where you're coming from and agree people would have plenty of time, but I still think making everyone start fresh would at least give some balance to the pvp servers. 
---
I just wanted another re-skin of Fallout.
---
Yes it's a great idea that should have been in the game from the start. 
---
Why give me a nukae cola machine that u can't use?
---
Yes. I got a vampire's tesla rifle that dropped with an auto barrel.  Holy crap is it good for a whitesprings nuke.
---
Lazy customer asked a programmer to do a project, got exactly what they asked for
---
Now when you respawn you will drop in from the sky with a parachute. Next up dance emoji's.
---
Equip rank three enforcer perk, grab a level 1-10 shotgun and shoot a scorchbeast with it 4 or 5 times.    Watch it land and be amazed.   ;). It's a 30% chance to cripple even if it only does 1 damage.  That's the whole point. Lol
---
I hope you have many fun hours ahead of you!
---
It will be a sniper simulator.
---
Similar to the Minecraft set up, having a dedicated private server that you run and you and the others connect to it and play together.... ARK maybe? That's another survival crafting game with a heavy and healthy PvE and modding new content, creatures, building items, scripting, new maps, and all sorts of things.  
---
Indeed. If they force you to reroll im out. More than enough games in  feb/march. Just because casuals arent good enough to get level/gear for pvp they want to drag us down with them. Drag down us, who invested  so much time to get levels and pvp gear. I know I wont be playing if I  need to level, find gear/mods/plans AGAIN. Wont nuke whitespring and  farm 100x again just to pvp.  
---
Maybe if you have too much time or a hardcore Fallout player. But Ill  just play other games that comes out in feb/march. I wont waste my time  doing all those shit again just to pvp. 
---
I don't like the idea of losing caps when u die... 
---
The game is not using your GPU, common issue for a lot of people. No idea on AMD, google a fix. 
---

---
I believe is the official account?
---
There are a couple of community reps who sometimes chime in.  (I can’t find their names atm.)
---
I saw a post by an experienced redditor saying that citing a usr in a response would flag the post to their attention.  I am not sure of the protocol.
---
Have my updoot, this needs to be done.
---
I think you’re saying that people are still being one shot by TSE’s after dense and fireproof, is that right?
---
If so, let me make sure that we both know you can still be killed by a bullet to the head. A well placed shotgun blast or vats crit with the right build still one shots people, and the explosive portion does not need to contribute any damage to do this. 
---
I one shot people with my double barrel shot gun all the time via headshots with all the shotgun perks. Many builds can do this.
---
The point is, and you can test this, that the indirect explosion damage, or hell, even a fucking car blowing up next to you no longer does damage.
---
I agree.  I had to look it up on three different web sites before I finally understood it, and I immediately felt my brain melt on one childish, inane meme...  I can't believe that I actually wasted brain cells on this thing...
---
Absolutely.  Allowing characters to swap between modes is stupidity.  I'm all for this pvp mode, I said all along they should simply have pvp and pve servers but allowing characters to swap between the two is a really poor decision.
---
I second this, great ideas keep them up! :D
---
Just like Fallout 4 survival was in beta when the main game was a finished product. What's your point? 
---
More like lazy developer. From what I read before launch most of the historical Fallout customers just wanted another lore based RPG Fallout title. It was Bethesda who wanted to abandon their base for a piece of the 'battle royale' pie.
---
This is a good idea, to be able to log back into the same server you came from within some sort of short window, but you don't have to be a dick about it.
---
Cool story, bro.
---
[The poor, innocent fluffy creatures. What have I done?](https://imgur.com/a/ZyRMGJL)

Lol you can't  accuse me of circle jerking when the popular thing to do right now is hate on PvP servers without even letting them respond to the reaction,  and just because you vocal few are crying about PvP servers doesn't make it the popular opinion to hate it. If anything that sounds like the circle jerk. Me liking PVP doesn't and shouldn't entitle me to being down voted because I think it would be super fun and you shouldn't be hateful because of that.
---
Another “beta” LOL
---
I believe its been sorted in Patch 5 that they intend to try and get out before the end of Jan. If your on pc (i know this does not help you now) we have a mod that helps this issue.
---
Because i lost half my X-01 mods i had put away to repairing my camp. I did not know it would prioritise steel&gt;mods&gt;Bulk as i had all my steel bulked. This mod has saved my ass a few times.
---
I know I hate it. 
---
Until the durability drips to normal. You get a good weapon by using a tier 3 perk to repair an awful one.
---
Known bug for about two patches now, I scrapped mine weeks ago. Nothing in the latest news about a fix, but maybe “soon”...
---
I think the majority of PvPers are on the PC site
---
Might be interesting
---
Pardon my ignorance, but does your adding it ping them?
---
How do you know that?
---
Anything specific?
---
Show me proof that slap damage isn’t already working as intended. I’m 99% sure everyone complaining about slap damage wasn’t getting hit with slap damage- they either had PVP enabled from workshops/PvP events, or there is some other bug that can randomly put people in PVP mode. Every test I’ve conducted with my main account and my alt account caps slap damage at 5 per hit, with it going down to 1 if your armor is that much better than their damage. 
---
Thanks!  
---
Just switch Helmet mods and you should see an improvement!
---
The only thing I can say is.
---
WHen you claim a workshop.
---
Just sit there and change the channel.
---
Do something else while you collect crap.
---
Less going on for the game to short-out.
---
I can just see the posts already saying "this guy I teamed up with for hours, and did multiple quests, then he killed me for my loot. Shot me in the back. Never playing this unfair mode again" or "some guy was just running around the scorchbeast queen killing other players so we failed"
---
It isn’t finished, it’s just fully released. It shouldn’t be but it is.
---
Would like a Soda machine with one soda a day
---
The first beta never ended, you silly goose.
---
76 is a special vault, built to commemorate America's tricentenial. It was a PR stunt by Vault-Tec. 
---
It's funny how the Overseer pleaded with us to help each other and rebuild civilisation yet all we can do is build tin sheds kind of near each other and then the new game mode is PvP. 
---
Giggity 
---
Delete all explosive weapons, then after a cool down period and fixing the possibility of duplicating, reintroduce them with the new limitation.
---
Modus production wing i believe can sell it.

That's fair, honestly, if they did a system where other items dropped and left caps alone I'd be fine with that. I'm simply brainstorming ideas and felt something low like 50 caps per death wouldn't be terribly detrimental without the ability to spawn right back. Which would hopefully prevent camping of peoples caps.  
---
The caps for death system as it stands, in my opinion, is ignorant anyway, but I don't feel they intend to remove it.  
---
Just on the off chance, you were not aware even in the current game if you die you lose caps based on your level already. I wouldn't be opposed to a complete removal of the system either, I just don't think Bethesda would do it.
---
I'm telling you the bobblehead stacking and killing through slap damage was disproven. With video evidence. On this very sub. 
---
thanks, I dont remember which terminal is which but I'll check each one.
---
Chill cuz, it’s all good. You shouldn’t play with the big guns. They’re dangerous 👌🏻
---
We have little ones for you, they make red and green lights. But no noise so you’ll have to go all ‘Pew’ ‘Pew’ when you pull the trigger... 😭
---
While I agree with OP.
---
What you said.
---
Is also true.
---
Probably that the game isn’t finished lol. It’s still in its beta stage. Not officially of course.
---
The production one is the red area as you come in go straight to your right. It can spawn in that inventory i believe.
---
I am ignorant too :)
---
I believe it is supposed to link the post into their personal feed.
---
I just read about this reddit mechanic this week on this sub.
---
They said they play this in the office. I wonder how bethesda employees  are equipped. Do they play with a server full of legendary min maxed players? 
---
This.
---
And stop giving me picklock and hacker cards in my 5 packs.
---
Starts reading post.
---
Reads "polished juggernaut." Referring to fortnite.
---
Stops reading.
---
Goes to comments.
---
Leaves this comment.
---
Immediately commits suicide after.
---
Lol, yeah. That sounds cool but I'm just not the read every single terminal entry listen to every holo tape type.
---
Second loadouts.
---
Also once you've unlocked all 3 of picklock/hacking they should be able to combine into one card.
---
thanks!
---
Idk what you're talking about. I assumed all this Griefing talk was mostly on consoles. Over 300 hours and nobody has messed with me on PC. 
---
Nearly everyone has been great. Some dumb etiquette mistakes and some people taking my junk but that's about it.
---
Some dude thought I was stealing his nuke zone kills cause he dropped the bomb but he fucked off fairly quick. 
---
No problem man i really hope i am right but i have seen them there alot when farming for my X-01 mods in the army wing.
---
Just make lockpick and hacker 3 star cards, and I'll be happy.
---
Sometimes I forget to swap back Lone Wanderer after vending
---
If I could save like three perk loadouts to swap between, that would make in-game life much easier.  An all purpose general homebuilding/repair/hacking/lockpicking loadout where I need to swap in minimal stuff to make esoteric items, an everyday carry loadout with some weight saving perks, and a DANGER/nuke loadout with all damage/defense would be ideal.  Kinda like CAMP blueprints.
---
I feel bad for being a dick. I’ve been playing since the beta and not much has changed. They’ve promised so much and have delivered so little. I was excited for a multiplayer Fallout, but what they’ve delivered has disappointed me to a different level. Seriously no hard feelings to Bethesda, it’s just sad. 
---
My Holo tapes were bugged for months so that probably has a big part to do with it but yeah reading terminal entries requires a special mood from me. 
---
Exactly, the armor and weapons, levels, plans, my hunter longcoat ffs and after all of the nerfs to exp? If anything, it will encourage me to play the adventure mode, just to grief anybody I see. How else will I ever enjoy my fully speced pvp build that is locked into adventure mode? 
---
Fair enough. I was getting greedy with claiming stuff 
---
If you own your own billion dollar company you can do what you want, in the mean time keep melting little snowflake 
---
please let me know when you get them. Really want to roleplay as psycho nurse for reasons...
---
Power armour gives you a helmet so that you can go underwater, into hazardous environments, etc.  It's kinda like scuba gear and gas mask all in one.
---
While i agree it's not an mmo but more like a shared world coop, people who saying endgame is almost non existent are right.
---
I also welcome any form of pvp, but for the current game, or the fallout genre overall, a new pvp based game mode was the least thing i expected to be the first major addition to the game.
---
I already got bored because of the pointless farming of plans, like various underarmor linings, not to mention that i have done all quests more then a month ago.
---
Anyway, as you and other have suggested, i already stopped playing, maybe there will be more pve content by the time i got bored of anthem or the division 2.
---
Crazy idea right? Haha really want player vending soon cause I wanna be a soda jerk. 
---
Anyone know where to get Steel Walls from?
---
It's sucks. I know.
---
But I am also constantly DCed.
---
And this pretty much is the only way I know I can make capturing a workshop.
---
ACTUALLY be useful.
---
It would be an amazing idea. Even if they want to do groups of the bears or whatever to save on the amount of stuff in our camps, it’d still work. 
---
you were correct thanks again!
---
Becuase there is no end to it :P
---
Good to know have a good day KingDededeYT. :)
---
This is a great idea! Would love to combine various food packages and hot key them 
---
you too!
---
Slap damage is definitely not capped at 5. I've myself accidentally shot people and seen their hp go down by around 10% of the bar. Surely they couldn't have had 50 hp.
---
Prior to level 75 I too was running out of screws all the time.  Once I got to about level 75 I started running out of springs.  I now have a ton of screws.  When I open my shop, I'm going to specialize in screws and lead....
---
You mean like no one plays PoE Hardcore? If it is done right and the grind to be somewhat viable is much less it could make a great mode.
---
PvP is only fun in a state of constantly changing enviroment. If you run into the same geared people with the same 2 builds it will get stale really quickly. I dont see what fo76 brings to the table to make it a superior pvp game either. The gunplay is bad and clunky, ttk is probably too short even after the nerfs, there are like 2 or 3 viable weapons for pvp.. the map is too big or has not enough players; v76 will be spawncamped because camps still disappear.. i just dont see it.
---
As a long time fan, I agree with that. PvP seemed to be an after thought, an essential piece of a multiplayer post apocalypse puzzle that they left to players to decide. The problem being that rpg players are not a homogeneous bunch
---
Yup there’s something that definitely looks like a very large bomb hit there. However, there’s nothing in that area. Why nuke it?
---
If you want the shielded plan its currently believed to even use it you need all the plans leading up to it. Some people have even said learning it before the others glitches the plan out.
---
On that note, if you goto the white springs bunker and goto the terminal that is for manufacturing I believe it will spawn whichever plan you don't already have when you login. So to get the shielded operative lining all you need to do is go to the terminal, but whatever plan they have, learn it, and repeat until you get the shielded. Doing this will cost you roughly 4k caps if you have to buy them all varying some on what perks and charisma you have. Don't waste your 3\* armor on it. Just server hop 4 or 5 times and get it normally. It's the easiest shielded armor to obtain.  
---
If you need more info just DM me and I can explain in more detail.
---
When i first played fo76 during beta, i thought each Stachbox you craft would have it's own weight limit. Until i created a second stashbox because my 'first' was full  and noticed the 'second' was full and the same items where there. Bugger. :/
---
I added healing factor on top of my other mutations and it's glitched. I don't heal at all and now stimpaks and radaway hardly work.
---
Indeed. Casuals should just stay in adventure mode. Leave the survival mode to the big boys. They are so fragile they would cry if you slap dmg them. Dont let casuals shape up the hardcore pvp mode pls.
---
Creation engine says no.
---
Don't hold your breath.
---
I like civilized discussion, ty. 
---
I've played around in build planner, and most of important perks I'll get and max out somewhere at 69-75 levels (including QoL). 
---
When I hit 50, my armor and weapon would be the same assorted crap unless I'll craft some better assorted crap right away. Many of my perks that I'd max wouldn't be maxed in leveling process, some of perks is 50 lvl by themselves, and the whole loadout built for survival, QoL and having fun.
---
The guy of lvl 88 had **thirty eight** levels of grinding ahead of me, probably lives in nuked zone, has all kinds of good mutations, sleeps in X-01 hugging his TSE Gauss Rifle, counting the innocent souls of underleveled he put down cuz "justice is served", and eats Scorched Queen Filet on breakfast. Ofc everything in his perks is focused for one-shot those terrible 10-caps wanted.
---
Yeah, I'm exaggerating but you get the idea - no matter what, 38 levels ahead is a handicap anyway, just far less important the higher levels we're talking about. At 100+ it's probably more of RNGezus' worship success dependencies and being effective with your time after 60-75+, no questions here.
---
But hunting the underleveled is still a cheap-ass move.
---
Did you craft it? Find it? 
---
Loadouts would definitely be a good solution. If I had 3-5 loadout allocations, that would solve a lot of this tedious card shifting.
---
I hate this... Why can't everyone just play battlegrounds ( the revolutionary war hl2 mod)
---
God I hate battle royale 
---
Well this is a FALLOUT game.  It started as FO4 and things were added but mostly stripped away to make it an online FALLOUT game.
---
ESO was a generic ONLINE game.  That’s why it had/has all things you’d expect from a standard MMO.  That was an ONLINE game with some Elder Scrolls added in.
---
Cheeks are spread.
---
The hole is tight.
---
Any other way.
---
Just ain't right.
---
I'm pretty sure that the less damage on flying Scorch Beasts just is a range thing because I get the same issue with other non-explosive weapons and after countless Scorch Beasts and Queen I am almost 100% sure that I do full damage when I jump up to them when they are hovering low.
---
I dont knew about the shotgun thing but I am intressted in this calculations that you were talking about
---
Making everyone start over would do nothing for balance. Within a couple of months everyone will just be kitted out like they are now, there will still be low levels wandering into survival at a disadvantage. I kind of like the idea of level brackets, every ten levels you move to a new. Then at 100 you join the ranked brackets. As it stands now survival seems to be intended as an endgame mode, Which I personally love. But i get thats not for everyone.
---
In my experience I would say the opposite. PC most players have been friendly and helpful, only a handful of douches. 
---
On PS4 I would say most of my player interaction was being a low level and being killed by high level players. Stopped playing on PS4. 
---
I'll never get that lucky :(
---
Forehead dripping.
---
Teeth are clenched.
---
A loaf from my asshole.
---
I've just pinched.
---
RPG players - generally a little nerdy, introverted, deep thinkers.
---
PvP players- ADHD, anger management issues, known to bully introverted RPG types.
---
Yeah let's combine the two....... that's a great idea.
---
Me too. I’m jumping in with two friends tomorrow on PS4. Just three more weeks til full release! I’m probably making a mistake by putting so much hope into that game. If it’s a shit show I may just give up on gaming for a while. The multiplayer VG industry is a mess. 
---
And how will this account for the dupers who have stacked multiple strength bobbleheads and are able to one shot the Queen? I do agree with what you said about specing into a pvp build but most will not. Maybe they will now as there is a stronger motivation. 
---
Got it off a charred ghoul at whitespring
---
If you died when you got it, it's likely there but won't show as a mutation in the list. If so you got to cure it and recontract if 
---
Goes to show the game isn't keeping people in the servers.   What's causing people to quit before they get to that point?  
---
Appreciate the info, my concern was just in a few months iis "we're shutting the servers down and have for months not one patch released" but that seems to be absolutely not the case. So yeah, it'll be worth it for me :). 
---
You had to detail that in the post. 
---
It definitely is a glitch or as others said the loot does float to other dead enemy's so not sure but thanks for informing me further 😀
---
I really really want to see camp budget sized increased and split into three categories. The stash size i do want to see it increased as well. The less reliance on bank or mule alts the better in my books its such a pain to do that every time to keep the main cleared up.
---
You get them when you complete the Miner Miracles quest at Garrahan Mining HQ. You also make your set of Excavator Armour. 
---
Jam it on in.
---
You know it's loose.
---
Screaming from pleasure.
---
You've just juiced.
---
I just want to get rid of it now but I like my other mutations.
---
It's the last one that I got. Will that one go away first or is it random?
---
100% true.
---
But they're a different mechanic than generic melee weapon number 15 and I think some people would miss them.
---
Or for ammo....  
---
T-60 Recon Sensors...
---
Stash that can be looted by all ppl, that Will help with raiding and u always can hide It :)
---
It’s random. Check out my guide, my /u is always open 
---
Exactly. People will stay in adventure mode and grief looking for some thrill. Think im gonna do that with my fully spec pvp gears if they force me to create a new char in survival. I mean I have to make use of my pvp gear one way of another right.
---
Will do. Thanks.
---
I understand your point about it not being fun..I think a lot of people are saying that, at some point they've said exactly what you've said. It's just that this subreddit likes to move onto the next karma whoring bandwagon so everyone can have their chance to recycle the same post 40 times.
---
I appreciate this post. It brings up things that seem forgotten because of the recent "muh pvp" and "muh tse" .
---
I think the problem is nothing in the game IS fun anymore.
---
I took some time off work to play it with my mate at launch  (he bought it for me, might as well). Once the "honeymoon period" of the game wears off, you're left with disappointment once you begin to realise how little point there is to doing anything. I cant bring myself to come back online now. I cant last 10 minutes without being bored out of my mind and leaving. Honestly probably worth uninstalling until better things /if/ that ever happens.
---
I have noticed thst Rad-X suspends the mutation effects for as long as radx is working.   Rad x diluted or radaway no problem.  I love the healing mutation.   When i use rsd away my heath restores along with the rads being removed.  Sorry to hear about this issue for you.  Removing a mutation with rad away seems random so be careful 
---
It's a huge bummer.thag hug is why I stopped killing myself with rad water to get mutations

And honestly, this isn't so much PvE'ers whining about PvP game modes as it is Fallout players being upset about the game series they loved go through an identity crisis in order to cater to a niche group who more then likely started Fallout with 76 and will be gone by the time the next flavor of the month PvP game comes out.
---
 If you want your PvP fix theres Destiny, Overwatch, Rainbow Six, Battlefield, Call of Duty, The Division, PUBG, GTA, whatever. 
---
Reminds of the time I created my 2nd character, got to level 5 and went toward white springs showing a new player how to find power armor, got hit by charred ghouls we ran into, mutate rolled eagle eyes, my one planned mutation for the explosives / long range vats build. 
---
No for real
---
I wish we could ride the bikes. The exercise bikes in the vault school work.. soooooo, we can peddle. 
---
There's two bears that spawn below the yellow house in the bottom right mountain area of the map.  You can get 5-8 springs each.  You can also got to sugar grove and get around 30 springs for all the clipboards.
---
Me, a Reddit: 
---
*downvotes you because you're correct*
---
Also the creation engine has been used since Daggerfall with literally no reworking, todd howard should kill himself.
---
lmao this has literally nothing to do with the engine but okay
---
Sugar Grove for springs always go there for springs. :)
---
I disagree. i think the new PVP mode will be a great boon both to the game and to players who want that from the game. I don't do PVP, but a lot of players want to ONLY do PVP, and they need to be heard.
---
I don't see why making a new character needs to be mandatory. Ridiculous to force people to reset thier progress.
---
I'll check that tomorrow.
---
I've got a 3* marine Unyielding chest piece which has me thinking maybe auto healing is not so good.

 [/u/Valseek](https://www.reddit.com/u/Valseek)  I don't want to be rude or anything, but I suggest you take your time, players will wait if it is worth our time. There were so many problems already, so don't repeat old mistakes.
---
What are the enemies like there?
---
I never said to remove them. They should be fixed not deleted.
---
Nice!
---
They need to get rid of bobblehead stacking all together. It should give you one of the effect and refresh when another is used. These are new to this game, they never worked that way before and I think Bethesda has every right and reason to change it without worrying about any negative feedback from it.
---
I’m in stitches laughing atm 😭
---
In the comic that sparked the meme: a baby. 
---
Absolutely.
---
The evil is spreading
---
Late to the show here. I haven't seen one myself, but I think it does exist. But anyway, I like to rock a grey beanie, wrap around goggles, and beard with my marine armor (welded/ultralight atm). Looks operator af.

Great job!

I'm guessing it never gives you the +perk when this happens..... LOL

Nothing you can't handle as long as someone has not scaled them up for ya. Mainly just robots easy to pull apart.

You're welcome

Not at all, but I was wandering around Harper's Ferry during an Enclave event and it was the first time I accidentally shot a sandbag and saw it crumble away, revealing the turret behind it.  I've put in 100's of hours in Fo4 and probably a couple hundred into 76 and this was the first time I noticed it.
---
I have a one star +30 mutant damage 10mm silenced automatic pistol.  Not as good as the others listed here, but I love it for trolling around areas of the map with low level (10 or below) enemies (I'm at level 83).  Enemies higher than that soak up too many bullets to be worth it.
---
Add me nealixxthenomad I'm about to run a solo
---
We have too keep our characters, or that’s 200+ hours grinding down the shitter for anyone that’s been working towards the release of a pvp mode, pve is too easy and boring and having to grind through it again on a new character would be ridiculous , Just fix the bobbleheads problem, let us carry on with the characters we have invested so much time into and the mode will be successful 
---
Fair enough
---
Server hop for plans you want from vendors. Unlock vendor locations on the map. Scrap weapons for mod unlocks. Turrets stuck for base defense and take up lots of budget, so just ignore them. Do excavator quest line for free power station plan.
---
Get all the weight management perks that you can that fit your build.  Dont worry about crafting perks as much since you will be able to unlock them all beyond level 50. Get Pharma pharma perk right away and also chemist perk to make dilute stimpacks and first aid perk max. Scrap low level weapons. Dont get attached.  Look up videos on how to build camps on a single foundation,  if you plan to play more mobile, otherwise multiple foundations are fine for long term camps. 
---
Wow, I respect you playing the game how you want to play... But put simply you're an asshole. Don't care if it woulda been an adult male, female, or a child you're just a jerk. Hope I don't ever encounter you in game.
---
Found them sitting in the office at Sunshine Meadows Industrial Farm

This idea is one of the most common suggestions as basically the Drop Bag design is buggy and plain and everyone really wants to build camp containers, world caches, supply drops, dispensers, vending machines, displays / hybrid function displaying organizational containers, and utility ones like a fridge or a junk chest (i live in a dumpster so naturally my stash is the dumpster but I hope someday a junk only dumpster can happen with cool features). This is one of the central ideas I presented in my response to the Jan 1 inside the vault feedback call. 
---
Wait...if they do that then what will everyone bitch about?
---
You should be able to upgrade that with thirty or forty mole teeth. That'd be absolutely terrifying.
---
Super duper.

This is gold

No. I am agaist this.  On the few occasions I have engaged in pvp, people have not been interested in firing back. I go in with my perk cards equiped to be able to counter damage i.e have fireproof maxed out and take very little explosive damage. But this does not help when there are players who have enough exploits to be able to one shot the SBQ. 
---
Also what is to stop players from dumping almost evrything into their stash like junk, before heading out in survival and just having enough for the fight? I allways store all junk before heading into a heavily populated arena. So they might take my TSE. Who cares when dupers sell them/ give them away all the time? 
---
This is also lore breaking. The overseer wanted us to rebuild and collaberate. Not kill the last of humanity. Fix the exploits Bethesda please before any attempts at re-creating Call of Duty. 
---
I do agree with this idea but it won’t solve the issue you’ve presented. What happens 6 months from now when we’ve all leveled our survival characters up and decked them out in the best gear and someone new buys the game? The high level players are gonna do exactly this whether we let them use their current character or make a new one. I don’t have any ideas right now to contribute but griefing is a common thing in games. Hopefully the level balancing will allow low levels to still compete with high levels but the way they worded the update it seems like as long as you have good gear you’ll have an advantage over new players which is how it should be so I don’t see any way for them to implement this without griefers ruining it for newbies. Regardless I’m excited for more content and hopeful for the future of this game.

That and the S.P.E.C.I.A.L shorts, just for variety
---
Joining, thank you
---
Maybe the lesson is to manage your expectations better?  I've been having a good time with the time I've played, but I wasn't looking for something to subsume my entire life, which people always seem to expect from a video game....
---
Can't join your game. Must be your xbox settings not allowing me, send inviteto KMooreLod and I'll pop along 
---
Odd post, why would you antagonize the community?. I mean its one thing to express your opinion and give feedback you feel you can for the game. But why make this post, your just attacking the community it serves no purpose outside of 100s of downvotes?.
---
You know the developers are not children. Any feedback will be considered as they see fit and they have acess to mountains of data to work off.
---
People should express their feedback here as much as possible.
---
How do you trade caps, for less or more caps... 🤨
---
Im expressing my feedback.
---
Not sure i would consider this feedback...
---
That's fine and all, but, I am kind of curious; What are you doing here? 
---
Ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh
---
working televisions, broadcasts, and movie holotapes actually exist in fallout lore, and im not sure how bad it would be on a multiplayer game, but fallout 4 has a mod called "videos of the wasteland" which displays videos pretty much perfectly with no lag, so i bet it'd be possible
---
Clipboards seem to be the easiest way to get springs. Camp McClintock has over a dozen scattered on desks and the floor in the main lobby. No enemies to worry about either. 
---
Well its here, i expressed it, expressed feedback.
---
You can still get them as rewards to events
---
I’ve definitely changed how I viewed the game since launch. But games like these are meant to be played for long periods of time without interruption. I keep lowering my expectations. How low can I keep going until I give up is the question. 
---
Hey everyone, I heard a rumour that Fallout 76 is going to start charging a monthly fee to play. The overwhelming evidence for this because a GameStop in Liechtenstein didn't have physical copies. At least that's what I heard a person say. If this happens it'll be a slap in the face and I won't buy the next Skyrim! 
---
Well then you better not fucking bother me in adventure mode you pretentious piece of shit
---
You realize that the time and effort it would take to implement this mode probably costs less time and resources than they lose to programmers taking shit breaks. They're not building the game over again from fucking scratch, they're just retuning shit that already exists and tossing it into a new menu option.
---
Stop trying to pretend that they had to decide between fixing the real game and focusing all of their effort on a pvp mode and decided to go with pvp just to fuck everyone over. 
---
Good job, essential thoughts for this to be made right. 
---
I just feel like this mode should be months away after functionality fixes like action Bar customizing / inventory ui for combat, things that will be essential for me to actually enjoy playing a higher stakes survival mode. The vanilla wanted system it came with is fine while the systems get finished for playability and overall fairness. I hope that the beta for it helps them realize how much the other responsiveness and ui fixes are needed for player satisfaction in either the pvp or regular end gamers player bases. 
---
Omg you saw the same youtube video i did, notification squad.
---
Question: is there a website I can go to and look at these sorts of numbers?
---
I'm sad dark souls and fallout 76 share the same title
---
Bethesda got there own real life 'The Responders' programming team set up. Survival mode is the answer, and it's the proof they got one now. The team needs probably a better master plan on the front to take the right decision here to put out the fires instead of creating new fires.
---
Though gunsmith may seem
---
a bit much to spend.
---
You got the perk anyway.
---
It's the same in the end.
---
I need some shelf to put a full collection of teddy bears and Mr Fuzzys...
---
Hmm, looks like someone needs to be put on the perma target list. And your buddy there will be too.
---
Are you guys launching another?
---
someone launched while we were in launch prep 
---
Would you be willing to trade it? Lol
---
Love the PSA and i friggen love Chat Mod.
---
I found just making sure Perk Manager loaded before it allowed me to use both at the same time.
---
Is it the video with a man with a majestic beard that spends more time defending himself than providing news?? If so that man is a genius!
---
Why did you spell dog weird in the same sentence where you are acting like you can’t understand someone spelling a word fancifully?
---
Sad to say you fail to see the point. Its a big bad waste land someone has to take the lead actor as the raiders lol
---
Yeah, I had that one for a while but it glitched on me and even reinstalling it doesn't help. TV always plays black screen. Pretty awesome mod though, hadn't thought about it. That's why I said it'd look like shit because I was thinking of the Fo4 intro where you watch the news on TV.
---
You can keep your health low with radiation damage if you want to benefit from unyielding armor, nerd rage and adrenal reaction.  Keep in mind that you'll be a bit of a glass cannon.  Works great for a stealth rifleman until you get mobbed by ghouls.
---
I got really lucky losing only Herbivore mutation when I took off Starched Genes to eat an Adrenal Reaction serum.
---
FYI: keep Starched Genes on when eating a serum.  Early on in the game you had to remove Starched Genes to gain the new mutation, but apparently they fixed that.  The new serum can cause you to lose an existing mutation without Starched Genes active.
---
Less than 5% of players across ALL platforms have the achievement for killing 20 players. 
---
Bethesda catering to less than 5% of their player base is absolutely mind blowing. 
---
I believe so once everything is more stable and they feel they can.
---
No, the way they work is fine and awesome now let’s have some fixes to the ui to respect the players time and grant customization so we can backburner the cards that have no use ever, and we need to own the earlier ranks of cards so upgrading them should keep the 1 while also adding the 2 to our pool. I understand the convenience of a saved loadout and I have no problem with that existing, I might use it but I’ll be happy just to have this ui streamlined and let me use muscle memory for the satisfying gameplay of equipping the thing I want to use when I want to use it. Thanks Bethesda !
---
You expect people to actually pay attention to the game instead of just criticizing it?
---
This is the best thing to read after getting off work😂Well done my friend your a certified savage😂
---
That's very sad as well and i am sure some of that is mates having to clear other mates bounties from defending their camps for them. 
---
I’m timed out of the silos rn, hoping others can launch haha
---
I'm personally not a fan of PVP only cosmetics. Though I would be glad if they were distributed as plans so players had the option to sell them.
---
As soon as I got my TSE Handmade and it doing 561 damage, my first thought was "Damn, this needs to be nerfed" but on the same token, they're increasing damage resistance and health for other enemies, making other weapons unviable. I want to use a 10mm SMG but I don't think it would take 2, maybe 3 clips to kill a supermutant. I totally agree with the need, but they also need to adjust enemy health and damage resistance. Also buff laser rifles or make enemy energy resistance drastically lower
---
know anyone else that can join? 
---
Sadly it seems as if they are focusing on the wrong parts of the game. As you stated this type of thing should be a far thought in the future, it almost seems like they are trying to make a "drastic" change to target a different demographic to make it more palatable to run and gun players since they didn't do as well as they assumed they would. I don't understand personally why instead of fixing all the other problems as you listed briefly or adding more actual content like more raids or stuff to do they chose to do this. The games just not a full product yet, so starting a beta like they are simply seems like a naive or ignorant choice.
---
Nukes didn't directly hit but they did get heavy radioactive fallout. It was actually the scorch plague that wiped everyone out.
---
Why do you say that? I have played sporadically in 45 minute or hour chunks of time with a few longer sessions here and there, and also play other games concurrently.
---
I am waiting for Fallout 76 GO beta. Gotta Nuke 'Em All.
---
Oh you’re just telling us? Why not provide the evidence? Since the burden of proof *is* on you. 
---
In my opinion I would implement for pve player a hard survival mode. For me as primary pve player is "vanilla" FO76 too easy, I personally hate pvp because in many games u must play to grind better gear pvp and that idea is stupid. 
---
My two shot took an entire clip. So two is about right. And that fact shouldn’t be right
---
 Tses needed a nerf into the ground and then some. 
---
I could never stand anything in WoW
---
Grind all day for consumables and armor you’re going to trash immediately for a chance at spending 8 hours doing one menial task.
---
What is being proposed is not the answer to rampant duping of legendary items. That is an entirely different issue Bethesda needs to work on, but altering a game mode because of a symptom that still plagues a game is laughably useless.
---
In a hypothetical universe where instead of TSE’s, there were double-damage double-swing-speed super sledges, I bet some of those players would be upset when the god-weapons were nerfed.
---
I am a TSE owner and I’m delighted about the nerf, because TSE’s ARE STUPID BROKEN OP.
---
Everyone in my group is offline :(
---
i built there &amp; loved that spot until the scorchbeast neighbors made it untenable
---
\+20% Food, -40% Water, cos you KNOW that it's gonna be a salty batch, everytime!!
---
I did. Came back to see if it was still a shit show and somehow it's gotten even worse.
---
We could probably run a hell of a lot smoother if all the dupers and ppl holding duped items dropped their over stock and let the game run as intended verses rendering their millions of items
---
Don't lie to us...  
---
I know you're actually a game dev that just wants us to think you are a janitor at Walmart... You are a sneaky one, a sneaky one indeed..
---
They do already have a quest reward system that works that way.
---
What happens when my military RP levels past the dirty army helmet? I could get a new helmet, but then ditch my army helmet. Or I could find a cosmetic hat, and given the lack of themed cosmetic hats, give up on my character story and play this game like another grinder.
---
Yellow flight helmet?
---
Confession: To be honest I kind of wish more people playing 76 were more similar to the Dark Souls playerbase.
---
In a game almost built with 'griefing' in mind, there was surpringly few people actually complaining about griefing.
---
Compared to Invader shenanigans over there, raider shenanigans in this game are pretty tame.
---
And no, I'm not talking about exploits. In Dark Souls someone invading you was just playing the game. Over here, you're a 'griefer'. And yes, this game definitely does have designs in place for that very playstyle.
---
I still don’t see how they can say this is a big thing with a straight face. Like they added servers where there’s no pvp protection and made you able to choose.
---
Who wouldnt have preferred a new raid boss or quest chain to this.
---
I get that its not easy to implement but who the hell decided this should be a priority.
---
I feel like the over all stash could be higher as well and the C.A.M.P budget could be increased also. And I personally feel like they should have kept the option to clear your camp too like fallout 4. Like it’s annoying that I need to have two sets of stairs because of an upward slope. 
---
FO3 Nexus Mod 'Underground Hideout' by danthegeek
---
Based on posts PC players can't feel joy unless the game runs at perfect 4k at 200 frames per second and looks so realistic you would think you were looking outside. 
---
An over exaggerated joke obviously. 
---
I think you can’t hurt ppl during an event like the SBQ but any other place you would
---
This. Can confirm. Farm one place out, go to your next 2-3 spots first spot will be fresh.
---
Thanks.
---
I've considered that as an option.
---
I've gotta see if the mutation will work or not. It's weird because it worked once. It also doesn't list the healing only -55 drugs.
---
I'm also now wondering about my speed demon that U got via serum. I only lists the speed perks but no negative effect. If that's glitched I would obviously like to keep that mutation.... LOL
---
I’ve got lvl2. It’s great for body shots (95%) at a pretty long range. But limb &amp; head shots are a struggle. It takes time to select the right body part. And I don’t think it takes into account any scopes on your weapon. When I FT to Toxic Larry’s, there are snallygasters 50 ft in front of me. I’ve got a long scope, and rarely get more than 70% on a headshot...
---
I've been finding (PS4) that people are hoovering up cores like candy since the last bug fix, which stopped cores from going to 100% when you log off and back on, making them more in demand.  So, don't be too angry when people grab free cores...  
---
I do get where you are coming from, but I also understand the other side.  I'm a level 83 and I have two cores left.  The next couple of Nuke events that I join will be to purely farm irradiated isotopes to build and stock up on cores.
---
no thanks. 
---
Just a thought, if you genuinely want to apologize. How about instead of posting on reddit to raise your e-peen you go take the name of the player from the video you recorded ( Sunskyn, I listed it in case that's to much work for you) and add her, apologize like a man, and then give her the materials?  
---
That feels like a much simpler solution than posting on reddit...  
---
Assuming you are genuinely sorry of course :/
---
I have my own method. As soon as shes almost dead i run up to her, grab everything asap, run away and then check what i got in peace. 
---
It really doesn't even have to be a massive increase either. You're already capable of building some pretty big and elaborate stuff as is.
---
Hell I'd be happy with even a modest extra 5% budget.
---
That or simply lower the budget costs for lights and turrets. Either would be fine.
---
What part of bethesda is new to online therefore their turnover speed will be shit when phased by new issues theyve nvr encountered do no one understand? 
---
Pvp mode addition is a lot faster of a fix then adding more content its so they can buy time to get their stuff done. Programming new bosses and events will take alot longer then flipping some switchs to turn all players hostile
---
I honestly get the feeling this is the easiest thing for them to implement to buy time. They know the hardcore fan base is getting bored of the game already and just need a quick stall. 
---
Maybe they are just super out of touch with their fan base...
---
I don't believe it's currently available to players, but I believe I've seen in pics on the Atom Shop showcasing other stuff.
---
As I missed the two-shot train, was only awarded w/weird legendaries (like meathooks), and only have a dozen decent right-side armor pieces, imagine my surprise when I accidentally triggered that fsmous pie claw - and actually witnsssss the whole animation unfurl. 
---
No I haven’t eaten it yet, but I’d part with it for a decent legendary-sub-45lvl-hunting rifle 😀
---
https://i.imgur.com/y9qA0cj.jpg
---
Bethesda doesn't care. That is why they released this game. As a slap in the face to the gullible.
---
Maybe, they figured the Sort function would crash the servers ... 
---
Oh, i didnt know it was still possible to reciece them in anyway anymore, thabks for the heads up.
---
You're with the goddamn c.i.a arent you
---
YESSSSSSSSSSS
---
ah darn, i’m waiting for my friend then i am going to launch 
---
I tottaly agree with what your saying! The PVP in FO76 is crap! The few trammels that build cool camps and grow crops are going to be bummed when PVP shit kids destroy their bases and troll them because their not hardcore PVP bros! Yeah these are sad times for this game and the idiots like myslef that used to enjoy playing it. I will move on, I am sure others will as well and I say this because my friend list gets smaller everyday. This is going to kill off even more players.
---
Yes add better loot so people have a reason to play this new mode. A reason to do quest/event again for endgame players!!!
---
If you still can, id tell the teams to change direction, unless this is the excuse to build multiple server support, the pvp mode is a terrible waste of resources right now.
---
Most people need more content, not a removal of slap damage that will take 2 months to happen 
---
Just go play Fallout 4.
---
Ahh so this is the target market for survival mode. Noted.
---
i got one but it was a long time ago &amp; i forgot where it was
---
Try getting some air borne diseases and water born and food born diseases too. 
---
Cool, I might hang out for a little bit. I think my timeout might be over
---
Been there, done that. But I want it in 76. 
---
alright. i’m trying to find some more people, this server is a bit empty but i need some good loot
---
This is really interesting, you might actually be on to something.
---
1000 Base Stash + Another 1000 earnable through ingame activities.
---
"survival mode" as PVP mode is fucking stupid idea and a waste of a good game mode.
---
No paid study groups required.
---
You know I'd probably be laughing, if it wasn't for the fact that
---
&gt;make shotguns shoot confetti
---
This wasn't an actual suggestion I've seen as an atom shop request.
---
It sounds more and more like a late 2015 DayZ /Rust inspired cash grab. 
---
Every 40 teeth adds another point of DR, up to 25.  Once you've made The Thousand Tooth Crown, a gate to hell opens up and you get your Flaming Molerat Steed
---
Would you believe me if I said, the first time I ever used it, I got one.
---
I spent hundred of hours in fallout 4, never got one. Not even a luck build in 76. Literally the first time I saw one I used it and got the pie. What in God's name.
---
I gata be honest, this things pretty friggin dope. Well done.
---
Right but building also crashes the game! Crafting and cooking! Awhile back someone on here was saying they crashed servers every time they cooked food for their crew LOL so doing the most legit stuff still crashes this super unstable game! 
---
One shotting players outside of PvP through slap damage has been debunked.
---
There are people though that use it through PvP.
---
As someone that PvPs a lot, I don't feel the problem is as prevalent as everyone's making it out to be however. I've yet to personally encounter anyone I can say for sure is abusing bobbleheads during my time PvPing.
---
I've had a few instances where I'd get one shot, but I merely tested it out by fighting them again. I usually won't be one shot every single time meaning they're not so much stacking bobbleheads but probably playing legit. The player for example could one shot with a VATs Crit headshot. There also exists perks that let them frequently immediately get another crit stored up to do it again.
---
TLDR; Oneshotting people/Getting oneshot in PvP can really just be the effects of a strong build and you shouldn't immediately assume they're abusing bobbleheads.
---
That said, I do hope the exploit gets fixed.
---
Ive also seen it, sadly.
---
If I control Bethesda, I’d want F o r t n i t e and Mark Ass Brown Lee 
---
[if you don’t get the joke](https://youtu.be/YbJOTdZBX1g) 
---
Yeah same, you looking to hit whitespring or sticking with sbq?
---
Loot whitespring hotel from head to toe pretty sure u get everything (regular junk)
---
Better question, where the fuck did all these people live? There's maybe, what 100 or so beds in the whole game? Was everyone sleeping in shifts?
---
In all seriousness tho I’m fine with pvp as long as they change it to new accs. Tse will ruin it 
---
i could hit whitesprings, prob better off for my team mates weapons 😂
---
It's easy to tell if Healing Factor is working as intended.  If you're not in danger or caution state (quickly crouch to see) you'll regen your health in small chunks.
---
Purchasing a serum will give you a 1 hour buff where that mutation's negative effects are suppressed.  I know I'm in the small minority, but for how amazing speed demon is, I feel like I was constantly stopping to refill my thirst bar.  If you have tons of purified water and salisbury steak and hotkey both so you can refuel on the go, by all means this is great.  I found myself running out of water and food all the time, swapping in dromedary and good doggy to get more benefit from my stuff, and it just got too annoying to maintain.  For my playstyle, I really don't need to scoot around the wasteland like I'm trying to win a marathon.  I can respect the desire to do so, however.  I don't usually wear power armor, and I definitely notice the slower movement speed when I dust off my x-01.  I recently got a vampire's auto tesla rifle for whitesprings club nuke farming, and a faster reload would be quite nice.
---
Go back.
---
It seems to me that the strengths of the game are nukes and C.A.M.P.s and the weakest is pvp.  It just seems that focusing so much on the weakest aspect is just wasting resources.  If you want to make pvp better okay...there are smarter ways to do that.  Heck make a zone that flags anyone entering for pvp....ya know like workshops.  Just dont make the focus screwing people over....but give me an incentive to release my inner raider.
---
Your ideas are good.
---
I expect the main reason that you can't wear a Hazmat suit in addition to normal armor is that if you could, everyone who cares about the mechanical side of things would do that all of the time, and that would result in a very different aesthetic to the game than Bethesda wants. They want there to be a variety of different looking characters walking around, not a bunch of indistinguishable orange suits.
---
So I think the solution has to be something along the lines of making the hazmat suit your underarmor, or having a show/hide setting like they do with the helmets in some games.
---
So how about if a Hazmat suit counts as underarmor but has some fairly major negative to offset the radiation protection, so that it only makes sense to wear it in high radiation environments. Also, when you're wearing it it shows the big orange helmet but not the rest of the suit.
---
Like I see a bunch of people complaining about them hoping on the fortnite train or trying to then go asking for shit like that?
---
Like dafuq? Do you or do you not want fortnite type shit?
---
I know I don't
---
Right! I made an open camo right in the front of Hapers Ferry and people would stop by and play music, craft gear and hangout while wating for stuff to spawn or just taking a break. I had a full on jam band going the other day. Then my base started makibg my computer freeze so I had to relocate and it's just not the same. Now I am going to be forced to PVP with people ehh I will block everyone until I have my own fucking Appalachia! Theirs your essay Bethesda, go fuck yourself!
---
If that was the case then how come the new mode comes out in March, starting in beta form? If it just took a few shit breaks then wouldn’t we have the 1.0 in the next update?
---
This exactly. Not that I don't like the game in its current state but the survival mode sounds like the dangerous wasteland Todd talked about at announcement 
---
I wouldn’t be surprised if the reported one shot kills are from people who didn’t realise they were wanted as they assumed that only happens when you murder another player.
---
Then they are one shot sniped and call foul, have to come up with some justification for how it happened and claim it’s bottlestacking.
---
Or maybe explosive damage is treated differently to ballistic and or energy weapon damage with slap damage.
---
Explosive damage sort of makes sense as I’ve been killed by people shooting vehicles I was standing next to to steal my junk...
---
tl;dr 
---
The answer to your problems with Fallout 76 is to go play some other game.
---
I mean they said you should start a new character. So if you dont maybe you will drop weapons or a weapon. So you might be mad anyways if your high level charachter dies and you loose some valuable gear
---
Some of the emotes ive seen requested are directly from fortnite.
---
Hell no, i do NOT want that.
---
That's a hell of a find.
---
Haha sounds good, I’m going to check if Charlie is open for me
---
Even us pve players only want to make sure this mode is good for the pvpers. So overtime adventure mode with tweaks to its pacifist mode can have us be left alone.
---
But as OP did point out and i did say before it does feel they would even consider leaderboards for it. That does feel very very Fortnite like and they are definitely not the Fallout fans. If the trophies and achievements on the PS4 and Xbox are correct. Less than 5% of players have even killed 20 players in the game. 
---
Some of that is likely to clear bounties of mates who got it defending your camp ( happens alot.). So i just hope that their focus is still PVE minded and not trying to chase the pvp flag. 
---
Also devann could you if possible pass along that before they release this server setup to the pvpers. They need to fully correct the duped item stocks still around. Also the weapon and armors need alot of rebalancing first. Very few items i would call balanced currently. That is very important for pvp man otherwise everyone will flock to the same thing like currently.
---
I waited to 50 to get Perfect Storm, it's competitive with my explosive assault rifle.
---
Me either but the community certainly seems divided. 
---
alright, do u mind commenting on my recent repost for the SBQ so i can delete it? i accidentally hid it..always so that 
---
hopping servers should do the job
---
Well you say holding onto fallout 76 is like holding a peice of shit... Yet here you are "Waisting your time and holding shit" as you would say.
---
Ehh if you get a rush out if getting trolled by people in groups your going to have a blast!
---
&gt; Ive got a clan of 30 who are just dam bored of this game because we have virtually done everything and we have nothing better to do then to literally hunt for peoples bases and level them and see if we can get a fight going 
---
I mean make your own fun if you want but couldn't you just, you know, move on and play another game? It's not like we're exactly in short supply nowadays.
---
Make sure all the components are in one area. Either your stash or on your person.  It doesn't like to pull from both as of late.
---
They really don't. 
---
Thanks for the post/invite.
---
Pvp’ers are still very much the minority. I read every inside the vault, did I miss something? The PvP mode so far is set to release in beta sometime in March, and if I’m not mistaken they didn’t mention specifically about including anything else with the PvP patch in March.
---
know anyone else who will join in? things r kinda slow rn,,,,,,
---
*hurk* can I get a burnt and blood stained version that looks like I'm surviving a hostile wasteland full of monsters?
---
Sup.
---
Incoming build nerfs...
---
Translation: wahhhh they nerfed my overpowered duped guns I probably spent 15 bucks or 15,000 caps for wahhh game bad now 
---
B-But it's only reasonable to think about the situation in terms of my own personal likes and dislikes! 
---
/s
---
But seriously, the irony of people saying there's only very few people that want PvP, yet apparently it's suuuch a big problem where people are getting attacked by other players.
---
You can't have both. You're telling me everyone playing is getting attacked by the same 5 people?
---
Sadly all my ppl are offline right now, less and less of my friends seem to be logging on anymore :c
---
Yessir that worked! Thanks.
---
Tse won't be a problem next patch. It's becoming quite mediocre, and several other builds are already drastically stronger than any tse.
---
Not the -ed word id use to describe the community, but close.
---
I'll add ya tomorrow, my psn name is: Xavier5249 
---
ah darn ! and same here tbh. well was worth a shot. i’m going to launch when my friend gets back then we r golden
---
Ayyy
---
Right? Although mentioning mark ass brownlee in the same sentence as fortnite seems a bit harsh.
---
You are the ones that are actively choosing to grind and server hop.
---
You've been doing it wrong the whole time.
---
Fucking sheeple.
---
Hey just asking what are these 4 good melee weapons?
---
For all we know someone in their crew was holding a million items and keeping it a secret while the whole server kept crashing over the dumbest shit.
---
Nobody's going to PVP in this game! They couldn't pay me to PVP in this game! It's total crap! The only thing fun to do is meet up with other people and explore or do competitive events or trade. PVP in FO76 rightttt!!!! 
---
thank u my son 
---
I keep hearing this op explosive stuff but with fireproof and the chest mod explodes don't do damage. 
---
What’s a better combo of legendary effects to look out for? I’m running a gatling plasma atm. 
---
Didn't some people on here pickup random stuff in bags or suitcases lol its like finding a bag of money! NOT LOL
---
Haha is that your launch?
---
The real problem is ppl with no real skills buying duper legendary that they didn’t even earned themselves and bragging around picking newbie or undergeared player. They need to gear synced and readjust legendary effects in pvp like any other mmo
---
yeah. change of plans cause someone joined in before i could delete the post so....:( if u can launch launch on WS? i can after if u can’t tho 
---
Well, since you asked, I've been on this planet for many, many years and I have never, ever seen nor heard of [Levi Hawken or "nek minnit"](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/nek-minnit) so I didn't realize it was a meme (thanks, google!); I'll admit to being out of the loop on that one. I'd heartily disagree that "dawg" is anywhere near as obscure as "nek minnit" (which is absolutely *not* "fancifully" spelled, but I digress...) but I hereby retract my objection to it.  
---
Oh! And before I forget: *get off my lawn!*
---
So just like in real life?  
---
Are you seriously saying that every weapon should be effectively identical except for the animations?  
---
That is fucking ridiculous. You are fucking ridiculous.
---
I would be open to the idea of making customized sets that are automatically interchangeable. Such as making a “crafting” preset with the cards you would equip if you were crafting and maybe a “combat” preset to automatically equip when you are done crafting. Just a simple click will change all your cards at once. Of course your preset would need to fit into the points you have in your special stats but would be much more convenient and time saving. 
---
I tried that prior to my post and didn't work. Found the fix thanks
---
I'm not saying we should have no griefing
---
 prevention, what I'm saying is we need then option for two willing players to fight on an even footing. Stats need to be scaled between fighting players, too. 
---
Is that the eventual plan? Servers aren't permanent. Whole game is set up around non permanent servers. Need server permanence and characters locked to servers to add private servers. That doesn't seem to be the direction for this game...
---
You just described OP's "clan."
---
Oh, so you are all just crying manbabies!!!!!111
---
How entitled are you that you're telling us what the game is?
---
And that's over of that most popular additions to vanilla armour in Fallout 4 mods,  invisible texture modification at a workbench,  I'm sure it could be made as an option. 
---
Except I picked up the holotape 20 quests ago lolol
---
I think I found the cause and fix:  
---
[Bug Fix] Pretty sure I just figured out the cause of the PowerArmor Targeting HUD CTD's AND THE FIX. http://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajk3tq/bug_fix_pretty_sure_i_just_figured_out_the_cause/
---
Everyone has a tiny chance at winning the lottery if they choose to play.
---
I feel like the pie should give a pseudo x-cell (chem) bonus to all stats with +5% xp for an hour (like a bobblehead or magazine) if you can land one from a machine.  That would be something special to save for an SBQ or other nuke event.
---
Ehh, I mean there's roughly major thing's I want.
---
1. A smarter Pip-boy
---
First things that come to mind there are the four "well" effects not all being one category.
---
And the fact I spend most of my time with my mods and notes tabs empty but I still have to scroll through them to reach ammo, could we maybe have empty tabs not show till something is in them?
---
2. A combat axe that's medium swing speed and one handed.
---
3. Map work, lots and lots of map work to the point of hitbox porn.
---
Give us our own server because we're bored.
---
Yup.
---
That was posted.
---
Yeah but had they not advertised it, just imagine the flood of 'Bethesda pulled a fast one' and 'False advertising' threads.
---
Ehhhh I've yet to be griefed on ps4.
---
Its a pc phenomenon. 
---
Id like full customization of it. Because like you said theres tabs i dont even look in or use anymore. 
---
Okay well some of us disagree with you.  
---
So you want a basic feature in 2019? Your standards are high!
---
Well, I’d join pvp only they disable level advantages or at least to some degree like divide pvp section according to player gear/level strength rating. Cuz a six years old can ‘pvp’ with full set meta max level pvp build it has nothing to do with skills
---
I was thinking about this but like in a lot of games we can just assume there's something in all the border up buildings. I'll be in a smaller town or in a map location like the airport or something . The locations seem small just cause so much is boarded off. 
---
If you slowly walk through a fallout game you get a really good sense of scale and things feel like they're actually used. At least the roadways do. Like oh, cool this is the arrivals area and I could see how it would work if it weren't all boarded up. 
---
Imo its line the trade hoax.
---
Ppl without a workshop, not in a party, with pacifist mode on, can't be one shot.
---
You have some good ideas but I dont agree with most of it. Character should be transferable to survival. Peopoe worked hard for it to level. And I care about the leaderboard. Any modern pvp game has it to hkeep players playing. Its common. 
---
That'd be fine by me, anyways I'm off to ponder the great mystery of modding
---
Bigger building budget, a bobblehead stand, 900 player stash and 100 account/ shared stash. 
---
Nah, full permadeath. Delete the whole save.
---
That wasn't really the point of the analogy. More like "you're sitting in this shit, have a snack so you feel better about it".
---
Ok going back to Charlie to check 
---
If you want to save on stimpacks. Invest in the quack surgeon perk. 
---
I’d love to see this but if they can’t even fix the duping issue, these conditions won’t see the light of day.
---
"everybody and their mom", is that a Freudian slip revealing that you live in your mom's basement ?
---
How about automatic game uninstall.. because why not
---
The problem is that you are all insane people who think that a two shot explosive shotgun is "average"
---
When you send a Bethesda a support Ticket because you see someone using the Copier.
---
I think the bigger mistake is not having a select few survivors scattered about to find. While you are 100% correct that it spoiled the ending of a lot of missions (Leading to it being the butt of the joke quite often), I think everyone would catch on pretty quickly anyway that we are just chasing ghosts without one or two people actually sprinkled in.
---
Should I walk around and read the notes again? Make a new character again? I want to be a master crafter and medic. That's my end game. I just get an increment further down that road so slowly it's not fun. And with duplicate plans, it'll be less fun the further I get.
---
Who's the sheeple? The person with no goal, or the person who wants theirs to be achievable with wasting all their time for the next year?
---
Uhm I'm not sure tbh. I just view it on my profile via the app.
---
Unless you are farming this game for a job, nobody is forcing you to play the video game.
---
Futurama reference. Very nice and pleasantly vague!
---
were you the one doing mad damage to the queen????
---
and i was be sarcastic *lolol*
---
Did you tried fullscreen?
---
Dcg, power fist, super sledge (all rise), and grognaks axe. It's literally 2 sentences after the one where I say 4 weapons are viable end game.
---
Nope, 300+ hours hasn't happened once. Feels like it's honestly super rare. It's a shitty thing to do. It's crazy often people complain about it and how I've never seen it happen. 
---
The only thing I'm picturing is the cat going insane and attacking someone, as soon as the TSE claws sink into its victim, boom there goes kitty. The fate of all TSE weapon welders. 
---
   you drop slap damage entirely and make zones on the map that are hostile specific, maybe include the factions in a story driven way.  pvp is full inside these zones and outside there is no damage dealt to other players.  players are drawn into these zones are better resources, increased drop chances, better bosses and team based events like capture points or something.
---
   you have a nice big map with a lot of empty places.  why not just add content to areas on the map and/or make zones on the map hostile areas.  you could add in new areas (hello south of the map?) with content that promotes pvp without changing any kind of modes.  
---
Well yeah.
---
Leaving the vault is only 88% so 12% of the playerbase either got a refund or instantly quit.
---
16% for key to the past is crazy too.
---
84% of the playerbase never finished roses questline aka 2/3 themain story
---
Anti armor for scorch beasts. Instigating for high damage weapons against generic enemies. Bloodied for low health builds. Furious for fast weapons, etc. Vats stealth crits are the highest damage, weapon barely matters.
---
Ever heard of a opinion?
---
Having the same problem,'I rebuilt my camp, and again every time I log in I get the error
---
Naturally
---
Yeah I have but what I also hear is throughout this entire thread you're telling people they're wrong when they have a different opinion.  
---
Where have I done that?
---
Nope, but it's not atomic shop thing along with red and brown flight helmets.
---
Tbh i think they're scrambling.
---
More than the majority quit the game already and what's left is just bored ppl.
---
What blows my mind is not actually adding anything new is somehow the solution.
---
Survival will have the same ol story. I will say ppl that haven't made an alt might be surprised at the pacing. Its slow now.
---
My office is full of dupers...
---
No there really isn't a way to finish it and it will forever haunt you in your active quests.
---
The endgame of being a master crafter and medic is helping other people in the game, not writing ridiculous screeds on reddit.
---
Survival mode is a trash idea anyway.  The best part about it is it may reduce the frequency of griefer in regular mode.  But probably not because griefer don't like getting griefed back.
---
I do applaud the marking of known plans.  That was the best part of the whole announcement.
---
I noticed. I don’t think the downvoted did though
---
I found one in the tents by the Poseidon plant. If you ft there, the tents are about 100yds in front of you.  I have no idea if it was a random spawn...
---
This game isn't about realism. Let's not get confused here. It's a game. I can run around with a sledgehammer with rockets bolted on. I'm saying weapons should have various classes, with different weapons in the class being similarly capable. If not, all the lesser weapons are worthless, and dilute the experience. 
---
Take it down a notch huh? Let's contribute before we go telling people dumb shit because we can't think before we speak.
---
That's a simple summary of this subreddit tbh.
---
Read about stuff that never happens
---
To grief a decent sized base randomly, meaning the person in the base isn't wanted costs like 800-1200 caps of a wanted level on you (if solo.) That, combined with most people not pvping because they're carrying junk on them they cant store in the stash safely, is why you wont see alot of pvp or griefing.
---
You need the caps for the wanted and for dying in pvp and the stash tp aagrly secure your junk.
---
Except that no one wants Fallout Battle Royale or Fallout CSGO.
---
Ah yes, but I love it, and want a reason to keep playing. 
---
Its insane if they make old chars convert over.
---
I agree new mode new characters
---
Not only sandbags but some of the road signs and gravestones too
---
Hey OP how does Get Fucked sound. Why the fuck should I put up with dickheads like you because you have done all there is to do in the game and now your bored, so you go around destroying bases. Grieve too many PvEers and they'll leave the game and you'll have no one left. There's nothing worse than people like you who think there king shit yet in reality are just wannabes and never will be.
---
As of right now, I think what you said is correct. I recently thought I had been “one shot in pacifist” but discovered that if you own a workshop and one player in a team claims it, you are flagged in PvP to anyone else in that team *no matter where you are on the map.* I think that those mechanics suck but also explain some of the strange reports.
---
And no one (AFAIK) has video evidence of killing someone who isn’t flagged red for PvP.
---
There are a lot of really weird witch-hunts going on...
---
Or they could just disable legendarys in Survival ? Would be most fair IMO.
---
I would love that i could definitely figure out some mote intresting camp builds with them. Also getting tired of seeing these posts and the main response is go play Fallout 4 and bugger off 76.
---
Like that's gotta be one of the dumbest responses on here...
---
Holy crap, you are just on a tear about being unhelpful, hostile, and argumentative. 
---
I often use "lesser weapons" that I loot because they are disposable and I don't need to constantly use my best stuff against mole rats and lower level ghouls.  
---
I am telling you. You are doing it wrong.
---
Exactly. There's a wanted player on my server maybe once in every 50 servers. 
---
Just saying, if they don't allow characters from the normal mode, duping problems will be greatly reduced. Because all the people who sell duped weapons for money won't be able to give them.
---
Build your camp, craftinf tables, etc.
---
Use them.
---
Store everything.
---
Leave only the c.a.m.p itself.
---
Youre welcome.
---
Yes, I am hostile and unhelpful to people who post terrible ideas presented as tedious screeds.
---
I seriously f'ing hope that only reason THE ONLY REASON they haven't upped stash space yet is because they want to make sure they've ended duping first.
---
Teach me in wise one. I'm kidding. You're condescending, unhelpful, and blithely ignorant.
---
Hi kidding, I'm dad!
---
Also...condoms cost more? ("Ewwwww...he said the C-word") People....Fallout 76 is rated M. You shouldnt be on this forum if you aint 18!!
---
I'd be happy if I didn't have a chunk of my camp budget flagged as 'stored' even though I have nothing stored.
---
Couple bank character alts. Dupe a few 3k weapons.
---
Boom. Anyone can be an asshole.
---
I am not the one who is trying to project every bad MMO trope ever conceived onto a game that is not an MMO.
---
Biggest issue i have with this pvp thing is that the pve side Will suffer. They are going to nerf weapons more and balance the game around pvp and it Will ruin pve. And i dont understand why the focus on pvp? Fallout as always been a pve game. Strange decisons all around 
---
Who hurt you
---
The saddest part is it was proven a couple of weeks ago yet it gets swept under the rug in mere hours.
---
Unless it's proven over and over again ppl don't believe it which is absolute insanity.
---
That copier looks awfully suspicious.
---
Details like this go under appreciated. The whole chatter about Red Dead II was about its small unique details but I think FO does just as good and always has
---
It legit doesn't exist in game files
---
My weapon names in Fallout 4 always were designed to self-sort, always beginning with a special character — like a caret \^ or embedded blank \_ or %-sign — as the first character, depending on whether I wanted my gear at the top or the bottom of any list.
---
So yes, this would be a great feature for Fallout 76, if it's practicable.
---
My mum have me a small box with soap in for Xmas. Every time I see it I think 'ooh, Bobby pins'.
---
How about if you die in game you die IRL
---
Answer: Survival Mode is a new beta test to prepare for an eventual launch of a derivative battle royale type bullshit mode. 
---
I don't understand why people who clearly don't want to play survival are so eager to tell everyone how it should work.
---
I'm not saying the mode, as stated, is perfect (though people should keep in mind that it's still WIP) just that the discussion should mainly be between people who actually want to play in a PvP server.
---
There are actually a number of people that actually do have fun with more punishing pvp or game modes such as the Diablo hardcore modes and games like Ark and whatnot. I think the main thing is that with higher risk their needs to be higher reward, so playing on these servers will need to have an incentive such as like 10x better drops or something (if characters remain shared between servers). Otherwise if characters end up not being shared they should add some kind of special equipment unlocks that people can get after getting a certain number of pvp points or faction points or whatever.
---
It is, but I do like the scenery.  I had quit too for a while, too many frustrations.  I play now for the chill out time and the lore. It is slow now.  But putting a broken game on top of another won't fix a broken game!
---
There is a bug in the game where if you purchase a mod and try to attach it, it will simply disappear if you don’t have the required perk cards normally needed to craft it. 
---
Here you go. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aw4xomXVwpQ
---
It seems to me they are listed in the order you picked them up.  So if you're doing a mission the one you want is probably at or near the bottom.  I know that's not what you're asking for.  But I also know the before I pick up a holotape or note I better make a note of its name or it's just going to get lost in the shuffle.
---
I would say allow weapons and armor to be transferred in but not out sometime after the new mode is activated, like you can transfer a two shot weapon like 5 months after mode is activated but you cant transfer it back to pve side, could be contaminated like the division dark zone, then if a player dies they drop it. forever changing hands, if a player leaves a word is stored into there stash in a special section they cant remove it from
---
Can you please tell me how you get this event to start and where? I’ve never seen this event and I’m lvl 89.
---
Fuck em. They can stay in their little personal hoarder hells where they can't even deal with leaving behind fictional garbage. 
---
"They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety."
---
Spoil the fucking details.  Being told essentially that survival mode isn’t all there is to be released in the entire future history of the game means nothing.
---
Everyone is going to quit for better pve and better PvP games.  
---
It’s a near certainty I will be quitting as soon as something like Anthem comes out.
---
86 queens. Still haven't got calibrated shocks.
---
I think you're going to need to find a butcher knife or a rolling pin for your weapon for sure.
---
I can give you a perfectly preserved pie :). Or you can climb up on top of west tek and grab one from the plate next to a chair on the roof.....I got that one then took a ss in front of a machine to troll my friends and told them I got it out of the machine
---
Suuuuuuuuuuure?
---
Sounds like a huge pain in the ass for little reward. If you're already one of those dupin fuckers then sure but your average Joe would probably decide against it. 
---
I find it ironic you don't even mention pistols as they simply don't exist on any comparison charts.
---
Outside of cosplay builds (who does those) they are inferior to everything else.  Heaven forbid you try energy pistols.
---
But hey, you can run faster with them.....NOT SPRINT.....but run....
---
That's what i was hinting at. The only real ones who can afford to do that shit are dupers.
---
It's a multiplayer game set in a post apocalyptic wasteland. PVP is definitely fitting. Unless were all just freinds, frolicking through nuclear waste completing quests and singing songs.
---
Looks like you guys took off but I’m going to launch in a second. Doing whitespring 
---
It's not difficult to clean out a stash as long as they aren't hoarding.
---
Add the_Dirtyhippy and join !
---
I just want more content not a daft new pvp mode ffs. What are they thinking??
---
Just two shot mirv the OP. Niiiice.
---
I haven't touched this game in almost 2 months. I'm not about to start playing it again for PvP SMH. It's like Bethesda forgot why people played their games in the first place. 76 is a disappointment. 
---
I generally agree, but man it'd be funny as hell for survival to come out and then immediately you've got a bunch of new characters pouring out of the vault and just getting into a massive fist-fight hehe.  
---
Spawning in survival is going to be an absolute mess anyway with only 2 potential spawnpoints and only one of those reliably being available in every session.  I get that BGS hasn't done a multiplayer game before but ya figure they might at least look to similar titles for ideas about how to avoid obvious massive problems - DayZ is hot garbage but at least they've got a whole coastline to spawn on.
---
It’s weird, today I had a session without any problems. Can it be a hardware problem when it’s appearing really random and in some sessions it doesn’t bug at all? 
---
What platform are ya? I’m always down to having more friends to play with.
---
You need the junk to pretty much do anything. I ain't trying to stop what I'm doing, go find the appropriate junk to repair a weapon or whatever then drop it official my stash with it.
---
I don't because it's terrible willing engaging in PVP means I'm gonna lose junk and caps. Losing caps is a terrible mechanic. There's just no incentive to pvp like ever. 
---
I have one in my inventory, got it from someone before I knew it was contraband.  
---
I'm not banned.
---
Your experience matches mine. I can one shot with a double barrel shot gun if it hits a lower defense player in the face or most players if it crits. Getting killed in one shot was common for me until I had a dozen defensive perk cards and specific armor and mods. 
---
Now things are a lot different and fights are actually fun when another player has done the same, but it seems like the assumption that exploits dominate PvP encounters has led to an unwillingness of players to actually *learn* the PvP mechanics.
---
I know that is how it was for me. I believed all the rumors until I started to actually put my whole gaming effort into being able to survive past the first shot and it’s changed everything about how I see the PvP in this game. I’m actually having fun.
---
If you need stash space quick perhaps just give it someone on your server, that’s what I do. Makes it a nice surprise for someone!
---
Nah those are the gear queers
---
I built my Harpers ferry camp under the bridge by the spelling point. But when I would fast travel to my camp I would end up underwater by the other bridge.  Working as intended?
---
Yep.
---
"It's against the lore because people keep griefing me."
---
Getting attacked by a bunch of asshats in a lawless post apocalyptic world is about as immersive as it gets 
---
But, if they actually learned how to play with the stash limitation (400, member that number?) Then they wpuldnr have anything to bitch about daily (member those posts.)
---
You had a good point, then you added that cringey ass quote.
---
Edgy.
---
And power armor frames please.
---
All i have to say is who still plays this awful game?
---
yeah, it was lagging real bad
---
Gotcha yeah the ones who like to ruin it for everyone anyway are in the best position to ruin people's time even further 
---
This guy fucking gets it.
---
I tried to make a 2nd alt and got to level 5 and realized my 1st alt got to end game and fizzled like my main.
---
Now I'm reading about anthem and div2 as this game is a come back in 6 months if at all game.
---
This week's inside the vault was the nail for me. No info outside of beta pvp mode. 
---
If new pve was in the foreseeable future they would have mentioned it by now.
---
I love it.  Thank you for your input. That's exactly what the Carebear say and the truth of what they should know.
---
It takes like a dozen caps to drop a camp somewhere to grab or unload some junk.
---
Most of the time, I am carrying NO JUNK, because I store all of it in my stash.  
---
What are you hoarding in your stash where you don't have enough space to store junk there?
---
Gonna give this a try, i ll update if i found someone to give it to
---
Cool opinion, man. Go fuck yourself.
---
I don’t think they’re indicative of points of interest, if the noises you’re hearing are the ones I’m thinking about, you can also hear them near pylons and things like that. I think it’s just atmospheric sound. Really simple but effective. They’ve been doing that since fallout 3 I think, and when I notice it, it always adds to my immersion. 
---
I've been running sbq again and again, 5 explosive vents, 3 right legs, still missing other armor plans. after that I asked to trade my 3 right legs and some guy simply gifted me two plans I didn't have.
---
What's the point of running sbq now
---
Admittedly, 400 was a little tight, but I can stay between 500 and 600 with some regular purges, but I don't horde legendaries.
---
I wonder if at least a few of these deaths are cars exploding underneath them. Now that I have fireproof 2 and a dense modded chest I am loving  garbing ghouls and bringing them to the white spring parking lot...
---
I grunt in any shower. Alone or with company.
---
Love being.....
---
Moist..... 
---
Lucky. I have only ever seen a recipe spawn up there for me. 
---
In my thoughts, not only Whitespring, but each nuke zone should spawn several times several mini bosses (like Death Claw, Grafton monster, Snallygaster) and horde of usual enemies. Difficulty is quality AND quantity  of enemies.
---
That's PR
---
Telling people they could drive up to the vault, wait out the radiation, and hop back in their cars and drive off after it clears world be good advertising
---
I've actually seen it happen a handful of times so yes it can. Not sure if it works if you're on Pacifist tho.
---
People are SUPPOSED to attack others based! 
---
Hi. Just here for my daily moan about stash limits. So we get all these weight reduction perks. Excavator with Calibrated Shocks and Motion-Assist Servos getting up to an additional 310 carry (100 bug, nice for emergency). Anyway, Black Diamond +5, Party Girl and Whisky +30, Radicool +25, Solar powered +15, Grilled Ragstag +20, and maybe +15 from some chems, +20 from Marsupial, did I forget anything? Probably. Anyway, they get us used to being able to carry a lot of stuff, but then when we do we can't do anything else. I spend about half an hour running from one side of the map to the other. I know I need to sort it out but yeah... some more stash space would be nice.
---
Raider - chases you wildy firing a tse .50 cal at you no matter where you spawn, if you spawn at your base it's wiped, we come in teams vs you solo and wait.
---
Dcg?
---
The first time you go through the decon shower at the Enclave you're told by Modus that it might sting. Gonna assume that's why you grunt, because it hurts. 
---
Hoarders get out.
---
I'd like to see Player built town's BUT I forsee a problem.
---
What if house turrets fire and hit another person's house and you're not in a party with that person?
---
Rockets, bullets and lasers everywhere. C.A.M.Ps destroyed.
---
They'd have to add some kind of field generator to protect the area from that. 
---
Pretty much. I did look at all 6 or 7 of them, and just couldn't be bothered.
---
Lol.
---
Make her loot pool like a mission completion. 
---
A whole mess of Legendaries I'm hoping to sell one day.... Damn player vending can't come soon enough. Guns I obviously don't need. I'd get rid of a bunch but a lot are just good enough to keep 
---
Perks reducing junk weight make me never drop it. They should effect stash doesn't have to give the 90% reduction but I'd probably change my play style if they made so.e changes. If bulking actually saved weight
---
Btw. It takes 40 caps us for some Reas doing it again always charges me 160 caps even though my pip boy says 40 still. 
---
You’re talking out of your ass
---
I wouldn't boast about that on a forum with not one, but two official Bethesda accounts if I were you. 
---
Lmfao.
---
adding my support to this: new char, no carryover, Character is LOCKED to the mode it was created in. 
---
The only way is to take note of who was in your game and try to join through them, it's annoying but having a rejoin feature is one of the most requested features that Bethesda need to add.
---
Because all of the mods and armor parts are in her loot pool, as well as all the serum plans. Good luck collecting them though.
---
it happens to the best of us
---
I'm guessing that was you who did the second launch, thank you :D
---
PvP'ers are the most accurate raiders out there. Now they will kill you for supplies in the new server. Exactly what should happen in a post apocalyptic survival world.
---
Death claw gauntlet
---
So you are hoarding legendaries that you farmed. You are doing it to yourself.
---
I've heard the opposite actually. I'm on PC, the worst I've had was someone who tried going for Revenge one too many times.
---
Don't be too happy for long.
---
The game will fix itself shortly.
---
I had the same thing happen to me a while back.
---
Lay down a couple of land mines near your crops. Takes care of the little critters and doesn’t eat your budget 👍🏻
---
Yep! Glad to help. We should all do it again sometime. Signing off 
---
It sounds like a fuck fest. If it was me I would be making my base entirely out of mob turrets and rockets to counter them
---
Yeah vault tech doesn't seem worried about selling a false bill of goods. It's a dinky ass lot haha. There were a little of assistants helping when you went into the fallout 4 vault maybe it was for administrators
---
you cant, that’s the problem.. people have been begging for an option to return to the previous server for a long time now and bethesda doesnt seem to be doing anything about it :(
---
You just got bethesda'ad.  Its like punk'd but shitter.
---
Unless someone of your friendlist is still on that particulary server it's impossible. I'd say it's one of the most requested feature over the past 3 month.
---
Beta for the new mode.
---
I agree with the turrets budget thing. They really only work with non-player entities. They should also make the restricted camp area around whitesprings bigger.
---
Pacifist prevents Unstable Isotope, Electrically Charged, and Tesla Coils (PA mod) from returning the PvP slap if Pacifist mode is on. Beware though, it doesn't prevent it from hitting Watoga Bots or The Whitesprings bots, so can cause a hoard of robots to dislike you even with Pacifist Mode on.
---
Server hopping is an exploit and it should be bannable. It's almost as bad as duping.
---
&gt; finished product 
---
Based on FO4's AI, they (counted as intelligent enemies) should run away if they can't deal damage to you.
---
Agreeeeeeeeed.
---
Honestly I don't know, the whole thing was laggy but at times it was showing me doing 1/6 of the entire hp bar in gray damage.
---
I don't know why I would be though all I run is Commando 1,2,3 Explosive expert, bloody mess, and use a 2 two explosive prime 50 cal and a 2 shot explosive handmade.
---
It sure seemed like it was me but to be honest I was assuming one of the guys was using the bobble head exploit. Regardless I think so, but with the lag and my setup I honestly can't be sure.
---
I pieces of my excavtor power armor and a couple of guns i can not repair. What i am seeing is two bars showing the condition. One that moves and one one that does not. Anybody else have this happen on xbox?
---
Oh yeah I mean I could be playing different but PVP offers little in exchange for my junk and caps. The few times I engaged I was a lot more mad about my caps being taken. 
---
I'm flush with quads. You want quads I got quads. 
---
PC. And lol, someone already downvoted my post. 76 is an online game, people need to let it be what it is. 
---
I thought it only affected enemies that aggrod you
---
I don't even know how to feel anymore.
---
God I hope there are devs with your high iq god bless you
---
Thanks for the suggestion. I will still have micro manage and make the mines though.
---
Me - imagining as if scenarios like that are a prevalent issue when it's really a minority but the issue is so feared everyone likes to act like it happens to everyone, everyday, in every play session.
---
What platform are you on, bud?
---
nope omg, it said i was doing a lot of damage to her with my cryolator but that never makes a dent, it’s just to freeze her. well at least it was fast, last one took us 25 mins
---
They honestly need to rework almost every aspect of the game to make it work in survival.
---
I'd much prefer if they make it hardcore survival over this soft stuff.
---
Pretty sure this will flop just as hard if they don't rework everything
---
The gpxd needs an overhaul.
---
They need to fine tune the continuity transduction on the over drive software.
---
They also need to put more blue intonthe colorfier 45000.
---
I know games. See above posts.
---
Walked by pile of wood and thought about picking it up. 
---
That sounds exactly as it should be.
---
Glad to hear it's still possible to enjoy that event even if the ideal scenario sounds rare
---
Ive done ot dozens of times
---
Maybe unpopular but I prefer it to be just cosmetic. If it were functional, everyone would have the same two or three top-def hats.
---
I mean seen it
---
Well, I have fought her before for the full 30 with like 15 people all with TSEs and such and we failed the 30 minute. It's near impossible to really tell whos doing the dmg and whats going on with the way these servers work.
---
In season you usually have bonus xp and loot on everything. that make the leveling easier and you should drop more/better weapon every legendary.
---
Console Data Wipe
---
Because I spent four hours on my face and IT MUST BE SEEN.
---
You need to get damage into the millions with stacked bobbleheads to one-shot through pacifist mode. 240k (which was used in the debunking video) is not enough.
---
Instigating or Bloodied Super Sledge or Grognak Axe with Swing Speed or Power Attack.
---
Oh man I know. Didn’t realize how spoiled I was by every other major *online* game 
---
I've had pancakes every fucking monday for the last 5 years, I shit you not. I recently started adding just a tiny bit of sugar on top of the bluberry jam. Need some variations in my diet, you know. 
---
I can't look at fans IRL the same anymore because of Bethesda.
---
Was taking a break from fo76 and playing some black ops 4, when i caught myself continually trying to pick up desk fans in blackout mode. 
---
I'd take the middle road; disable fast travel if that fast travel would've costed caps.
---
Therefore fast-travelling to Vault 76 or your camp would be unaffected, while you can fast travel to nearby places you would go faster by walking unless you got stuck.
---
How the hell is PvP lore breaking? Maybe the guy you killed stole your favorite Grognak comic 14 years ago, or slept with your wife. Maybe you're a psychopath, and vault security's the only thing that's been stopping you from killing everything you see for the last 25 years. Maybe you just took one look at the Wasteland and thought "You know, steeling shit's going to be *a lot* easier than building and maintaining my own farm." If you can't come up with a justification for your character to kill, you have no business playing an RPG. Go play Call of Duty or something. 
---
no, lvl 2 starched genes lets you keep your mutations no matter what you do
---
yeah, i heard she’s easier of a lower level starts the event but i’m not entirely sure. i just know that was a good run, 
---
I'm not sure which of the three effects I listed is AoE, but at least one of them is: I think it is Unstable Isotope. But that AoE hits everything in range.
---
Wall off your garden. Build a big beautiful wall around them then punji boards. 
---
It was I'd love to do it again sometime :P
---
I’m a solo player, and it’s important to remember that 76 is Beth’s first look at multiplayer gaming, so it makes sense for them to be exploring that aspect at the moment. As much as it doesn’t interest me, I understand it. 
---
Dogs attacking corn: if you go to your c.a.m.p it gives you the option to push repair all. It will repair everything you have the resources to repair, including crops. No time, back to playing.
---
Turrets: turrets have programming, and moving parts. This is a server based game, a resource shared by all players inhabiting the world. If everyone has 30 turrets, that’s approx a potential 900 turrets in a world. Okay, so perhaps they’re all static and not draining resources too quickly, but wait, 6 caps are under attack from mobs! Thats 180 turrets tracking enemies and firing ballistic calculations at mobs. Bye bye server.
---
Stash size: de prioritised until other more pressing matters are resolved I’d wager. 
---
I agree there could be optimisations, and the tech pales in comparison to other open world multiplayer games, but it’s literally a single player developer fudging what they’re good at into a multiplayer environment, this wasn’t going to be a perfect experience. I think they’re doing great work with it though personally. Really nice to feel a part of their growth into new realms of game design!
---
They will if you don't have it equipped
---
So your point is a joke we've heard a thousand times since the beta? Hah. 
---
maybe tmrw? 
---
I built a fence last night. Dunno if that will work. I had my crops indoors before, but it looks silly :-)
---
My only problem is when the "Raiders" then get pissy about me attacking them back and steeling *their* shit. Live by the sword, die by the sword, I say.
---
I’m saying it because they’ve designed this game for the long run. Why would they make it so expensive and risky to claim a work bench? To be disconnected 2 minutes after spending 35 caps and whatever resources it took to completely claim that spot? I don’t have a problem with the disconnects. The problem is not being able to restore all the progress due to Bethesda not having stable servers. 
---
Not really... The only thing I wield right now where I could use a larger mag is an automatic pipe pistol.  
---
That and my desktop is down, which is why I am posting instead of playing.
---
You obviously haven't met Woobie.
---
I absolutley agree with you on the helmet need to have dr/er. As far as the my first pick good body armor is my choice personally. A gut shot and you die slow, being shot in the head... at least its fast.
---
If you got room you could make a greenhouse of sorts maybe. Im thinking about ditching carnivore so I can get down on those beautifuly bland soups 
---
I was contently unaware of this videos existence, until now.
---
I have been both illuminated and damned at the same time.
---
People at work asked me why I got excited about this tray of junk in a spare office a few weeks ago
---
https://imgur.com/a/F9nwYkC
---
Not to mention the PvP specific magazines I've been hoarding in readiness - Covert Ops 3 (-10% damage from other players) and Covert Ops 7 (-50% Enemy Player VATS Accuracy) amongst others...
---
When you switch cards you’re gathering and organizing the tools and materials it’ll take to do what you’ve sought to. 
---
Two shot exploding All Rise of course. Just kidding. 
---
I use an instigating hook, level 50 with extra hooks mod. It packs a great punch on the first strike, which is great for tagging enemies in a group like at White Springs. Plus I don’t have to listen to that annoying rocket constantly.
---
Mutant slayer Grognak axe is a favorite for those stubborn super mutes. 
---
I sure wish I could use my one handed armor penetrating mole miner gauntlet with extra blade in power armor. 
---
I also craft a variety of food and drinks and take chems for extra bonus damage and strength. 
---
Glad you had a good time. I was Punchy. Headset is broke. Prime shotgun was broke. The other shotgun was out of ammo. I probably should have looked at that before I launched the nuke. It was fun though trying something new fighting her without any power armor and low life with a bloodied power fist. I appreciate the adds cleanup.
---
That is for the upcoming **faction pvp system** they were talking about. Not this mode. Also if you think random people going to team up with other random people to fight an another group of random dudes, I would say you're dreaming.
---
Well, if I have to use my corn to repair my corn that kind of defeats the pupose of growing corn? 
---
What you say about turrets makes sense. 
---
Just making critters not attack camps would probably give the game a breather then? Less stuff to track?
---
\- Add function to eat and drink directly in-game without first picking it up and then eat/drink it via intentory. Also same function for chems.
---
\- Add way to replay all previous story missions after story missions are completed without starting again from scratch.
---
FOBG? I bet it will be e-sports ready by year end!
---
Basically what I’m trying to say is players should be able to play a survival based game for more than two hours without losing all they’re progress 
---
Ty
---
Almost no one plays this game period compared to other besthedia games. Whatever they are doing now isn’t working so it makes sense they plan to change focus
---
I’m stoked for it. I fully expect to get killed a lot, but I’m gonna fuck shit up too. 
---
Stop the screeching and just breathe. Put down the jet and enjoy the game 
---
Ah ok thanks I'll bear that in mind. Loving the mutations atm
---
I agree with you that getting disconnected after claiming workbenches is a problem and there should be some kind of persistence with workbench claims between sessions. I don't even try to claim workbenches right now, and honestly most of them aren't really worth much to me. They seem like a good source of fusion cores at some point, but I have more than enough fusion cores, almost too many. I may need to give some away soon.
---
nice dude! enjoy that bad lad
---
It may be the fastest, it still isn't as efficient as a super sledge with the same affixes because of how the damage works. 
---
Same for guns, which is why heavy weapons sucks in front of shotguns: you spend a thousand rounds to do the same damage as a single shot. Too bad.
---
Lol. What a shame. Should be a good weapon but it just can’t get through armour. 
---
And how do you get rid of them if needed?
---
Not a bad idea. I will look into that. The dogs will probably start chewing at the greenhouse, though :)
---
As an avid modder for fallout 4 and Skyrim, I cannot WAIT for a creation kit. The amount of fun stuff they have added that I will be able to play with makes me so excited.
---
I am in the same exact boat. Never a pie in Fallout 4. First try in 76.
---
Tried a few machines since and nothing. My headcannon is that this Survivor found the last working machine and that's why none work in 4, either.
---
Yeah I’ve realized I have to play a short game. The game is still incredible. Even with the problems
---
Shhhh don’t worry baby, I’ll upvote you. Don’t let these bad cats bring down your mellow maaaan
---
My post was actually the first to bring up the topic.
---
You unequip the starched genes card and take some good old radaway 
---
Duping is not an entirely different issue when those duped items are going to be brought into pvp. 
---
You played 700 hours of a game in three months? That is terrifying and frankly sad. That is like nearly 8 hours a day playing this
---
Fo76 hate-train lurkers who probably already put the game down. Community is asking for content , we get thrown a bone and this is how we act. It's like we're playing a completely different game sometimes. 
---
wow you're boring
---
I was mostly kidding hehe. That sucks I'm at work and they've taken my work from me so here I am. If come across one I can try and hit you up
---
I love the novelty of quads
---
Like a quad revolver... How'd you fit all 24 rounds into that cylinder? 
---
Crossbow is neat. Allows for a 4 round magazine but reloads pretty slow.
---
WHY ARENT THE FUCKING VAULT RAIDS NUMBER 1 PRIORITY? 
---
And you're a fucktard.
---
F U
---
The fuck is a fortnight? That some kind of a Minecraft? I don’t know what this is, but it makes me thing of Gen Z kids, YouTube, Tide Pods, and shitty battle royal PvP. 
---
This isn’t destiny. Chill
---
I got stuck inside a players camp when they left, and I had to pick the lock to get out which gave me a wanted 10 caps tag. Does that immediately put me in player versus player mode? Because I got one shot killed, and I did not know why. I always play in pacifist mode and never play PVP.
---
They'll be sure to stash all their Chems and loot before they switch too
---
Ty!
---
Yeah I use the spiked floor traps and defence barrier in front of my fusion generator. I don't expect it to kill all the creatures but it will tip me off if I'm around. Couple that with a turret and your probably good. Depending on your build location you might get able to place the plants where melee attackers physically can't reach. Like on cliffs that technically count as ground
---
Just a thought
---
Do you have any proof of this?
---
I can’t find any conclusive evidence that slap damage scales as a percentage of weapon damage. There’s no video of anyone doing more damage than the small hits in the video and my own slap damage is almost identical to what he’s seeing. 
---
From what I’m seeing, there is no noticeable difference between an attack at 260 damage and 240k damage. People can say what you said and state that slap damage does some unknown percent of weapon damage, but no one here actually knows exactly how this works do they?
---
I think it’s something that the community has accepted as truth but I actually think slap does not scale and these reports are the result of confusion over PvP mechanics and/or some other exploit. 
---
They did, their called Bethesda... 
---
No, this is not fair to anyone who built for pvp from day one. 
---
Plenty of better ways to handle it, like having the server matchmake survival only characters separate from safe space mode.
---
Just watch and it will happen. They already nerfed twoshot etc because of pvp. Would not happen if this was pve game only 
---
But if its a choice. Then you can... I don't see what the issue here is 
---
I'm currently in the process of playing through a second time whilst journalling my adventures as a role play. If you're interested I could share some pages and keep you posted. 
---
The Wikipedia plot outline of replete with inaccuracies, and it's time consuming to write ex nihilo, but if you have any questions you'd like cleared up, I'll give it my best*
---
*Because I'm a giant nerd
---
I'm suggesting this because I enjoy pvp not the contrary. This has nothing to do with not wanting to go against people that grinded out gear legit, its about not allowing exploiters to bring their duped god tier legendaries and infinite supplies over to survival and tainting it from the start. Every post I've seen complaining about this suggestion has the user mentioning how much time they spent grinding their gear and are just salty they wont have their god rolled weapons to run around with. I spent a long time on my character as well but I'll 100% give that up for an untainted server. 
---
I was halfway done with that achievement on my first day of the beta. 
---
I'm not boasting, just telling it how it is.  I don't even use it or like it.  It's too easy to accept it as a random item from a random player and not know where it came from. 
---
To make things worse, you learn the plan for it from scrapping it only once so it can spread far too easily.
---
I 100% agree with you. 
---
I'd simply add that C.A.M.P. building should probably add something in game. Why the fuck should I care about building a superb house when a plank floor with crafting stations and 18 turrets is more efficient? 
---
I WANT to build houses. The game tells me to do so by putting many plans everywhere. But the game also tells me to not bother because it doesn't bring or mean anything to have a house. No bonus for a nice deco, not even a real way to decorate (fuckin empty shelves).
---
The game was thought as a solo game with other players, which means anyone can do anything, so you can't be a crafter or a medic because people are autonomous. That's sad, because there's thus no reason for interaction, aside from PvP.
---
But how do you want to PvP when people on day1 were up to level 8x thanks to the beta?
---
How do you PvP when your opponent has bought a weapon on the web that is so broken it required a patch because it's damage were out the game's range?
---
How do you PvP when people are able to one shot the motherfuckin SCORCHBEAST QUEEN?
---
Around level 20 I think you’ll start running in to combat/assault rifles. They won’t do the raw damage of a shotgun or a sniper, but their high RoF and range can make them pretty powerful.
---
But it’s a good idea to pick one type of weapon and focus on perks enhancing it, until late game where you start getting spare perks to try other builds. Auto rifles, semi-auto rifles, shotguns, heavy weapons, various melee types..
---
 Decide on what you want to use and focus on perks enhancing that. (I wouldn’t recommend maining Pistols for now. They’re sub-par compared to the other guns, and their damage perks can chew up valuable Agility combat perk slots)
---
Losing any of your gear whatsoever is a total deal breaker for 95%+ of the player base. Spending days and weeks on end to get a decent legendary or a nice piece of armor, just to lose any of that effort in seconds is not high risk vs high reward, it's only high as fuck risk with next to no pay off depending on who you kill. You could keep a ton of trash lightweight weapons on you to severely reduce the chances of ever losing your good weapons as well. If legendaries didn't exist, then this penalty wouldn't be terrible. If they could make it so legendary assets couldn't be equipped and not drop via player death in Survival mode, then I wouldn't have issues with it.
---
This game isn't like Rust where you can just craft another piece of armor or another weapon as they aren't anything special and don't have unique attributes like legendary effects. Not having a legendary weapons (that's at least decent), will put you at a severe disadvantage. Legendary weapons are just powerful enough to give you a significant advantage. Losing a piece or 2 of Assassins's armor will put you at a disadvantage, and it'll be a while before you can get them back, especially the exact piece you need. Having penalties this harsh is a exploiters wet dream. There are far too many balancing issues and exploits currently available that are way too broken to have harsh penalties like this.
---
Either you have this harsh penalty system without legendary equipment, or you offer other rewards and penalties instead, like having a daily challenge for 50 atoms to kill 10 players, and people will be out for blood.
---
Lmao, Bethesda’s game design is so last century, like, who the fuck still design their game this way? Dropping items when dead is a design from the 90s and it sucked so bad. 
---
Everything about this game, technology, animation, system, gunplay, realism, physics and graphics are all so last generation, it’s so insane, 
---
still no auto/manual vaulting over obstacles in 2019, 
---
character facial animations are lifeless or nonexistent, 
---
no native wide screen support, 
---
physics tied to framerate, 
---
bullets don’t have trajectory, 
---
layed audio sounds awful, cannot figure out direction especially vertical footsteps,
---
texture quality is the worst I have ever seen,
---
Enemy AI and pathing is trash, they have no animation to get over obstacles, a simple dead tree log is enough to block huge monsters, they cannot attack but staring at you mindlessly when you stand on top of a car and watch you shoot them all dead.
---
This game, Bethesda need to hire better system designers and better programmers. It’s so baffling to see how outdated this game is.
---
Sorry, rant over.
---
No worries. Who knows when my Chinese motherboard is actually going to show up! :)
---
I agree with some points wholeheartedly but some not at all. Leaderboards are practically a necessity for an MMOs longevity. It doesn’t matter whether it’s Fallout or not, this is an online game and they’ve attracted an online gaming audience.
---
You can’t survive my wasteland 
---
Thanks very much, appreciated!
---
I think the perks i have chosen are Lone Wanderer (2) because it was a no brainer, as well as first aid, pharma farma and slugger (2). Sadly all the perks i got in my packs were beyond useless to my build.
---
Going to get another point for slugger i think, and then the perk that allows me to make higher tier melee weapons.
---
As for levelling, i am currently travelling to Summersville, as ive heard that that is a good place to train. 
---
Hoping to find a sledgehammer soon, currently running around with a fire axe.
---
Yes, any wanted amount means you are flagged for PvP and would take full damage from any player attacker. I honestly think confusion over these things is the root of the “griefers and exploiters are everywhere” phase we are in.
---
But... but Excavator PA was built by Garrahan and West Tek. Hornwright was the “machine” (robot-mining) in the man vs machine contest. 
---
Nice. I'll try and keep this in mind. Knowing myself as I do I'll probably just forget to ha. I like YouTube lore videos for places I've explored but don't want to bother back tracking to. 
---
Going back gives a little of context to some places tho 
---
One thing they'd need to do is just speed up the levelling a bit after the nerfs. For seasonal people would get bored with the current grind
---
I agree 100%. This mode should expand the game, not restrict it. Our invested time should be valorated and not trowed to the trash because of exploiters. 
---
They can just increase the experience for survival mode, or give lots of exp for killing other players
---
Does a serum count as a chem?  If I take a chem would it negate the serum?  (Which I’m only learning now is temporary)
---
I think everyone needs to chill the fuck out. I for one am excited for it. I’m gonna make a new character and try to do a chameleon/sniper build. 
---
I’m not gonna “grief” but I am gonna hunt people and eat them. Stop complaining and let me enjoy my dirty wastelander...and I’m not talking about the drink. 
---
I don’t get the hate for a leaderboard. This is an ONLINE game. I know that Fallout players are traditionally single player RPG enthusiasts but damn. Same was true for ESO at launch and presently the leaderboards are one of the few things that keep endgame players subscribed.
---
And Excavator PA was built upon T-45, nothing really ground breaking and lost that contest to boot. 
---
First just want to say i tip my hat to you modder. I think the main thing i love about Bethesda games is modders. They can tell some really amazing stories and give really fun content long after the game should of died.
---
I cannot wait to see what you lads do when you can get your hands on the 76 actual game content for us. I know Bethesda has plans for future content. But i honestly wish they would make private servers and modding top priorities. As i have no current content to do outside of helping others. While that has brought me alot of joy. 
---
I can only do that for so long without new content. Also because i really really dislike 76 pvp. With the current note we will get our first vault opening soon. I am just not sure how long they will sate our content needs until the next vault opening.
---
So i would love to see them share the content drought load with modders.
---
TLDR : love the work you lads do and wish they would prioritise private servers and modding over all else.
---
A genius will be downvoted by peasant minds. Mind them not stallion
---
How are you "SUPPOSED" to attacks someones else's base when there's literally zero ingame incentive or reward for doing it? When neither of those things are present, it's either griefing or trying to provoke someone into pvp. If there was an actual reward or chance of it, then it's a mechanic of the game, but since there isn't... it's just being a dick. There is a reward for pvp, but not destroying someones camp.
---
Great post sir! Constructive and covers what any gamer should see. And overall they need to stop nerfing a broken game. I agree TSE need some attention but apart from that the main issue is that most of the items in the game are total crap apart from a few top tier melee and non explosive ballistic weapons. 
---
I whish they would buff and create more fun diversity rather than nerfing what is good atm. 
---
And Beth needs to get rid of the dupers. Still people spamming trade forums with millions of top tier items...
---
There are perks to increase your damage to bases ydb 
---
No guns do all that much damage ha. I've got a two shot if most of the guns I use and it's still a pain. I think the health is bugged, super high, or scales like the queen cause damnit can take a while. 
---
I'd say crit savy maybe plus tenderizer. I always kill the vertibirds cause it takes me literally one shot and they explode into a ball of fire. I heard killing them slows it the hell down maybe see if you can get someobe else interested and they can help cause once it's down everyone gets a card
---
&gt; Still acting as if TSEs are even going to be a problem anymore
---
Shell shock is a disease
---
Concentrated fire is a must have for every automatic gun. 
---
I think Beth thinks that what worked in Team Fortress 2 should work there, but not for me.
---
&gt; Why you didn't do this is madness 
---
No it's not.
---
If they have private servers that support mods then they won't earn anything from the atom shop.
---
They did say they were still taking suggestions. I’ll wait till we’re closer to launch of the mode to make a decision.
---
BuT WhAt AbErT DuH BeBbLe Hed StAcKiN???
---
But seriously, I get that it’s possible, but I’ve never encountered someone doing it and I’m level 100. I think it’s a small percentage. Only on the F76 reddit can EVERYONE complain that EVERYONE has a TSE weapon because of trading with duper’s. 
---
How does the majority complain the the majority has something that the majority lacks?
---
This reads like a bad copypasta.   
---
Also just because you grinded out gear doesn't mean you are good at pvp it just means you have a lot of time on your hands. Skilled PVP isnt even a thing in this game considering how unbalanced it is, 99% of fights are decided by who can activate vats the fastest. I'm sorry you're salty you wasted a thousand hours minmaxing and you dont wanna give up your gear but no matter what way you look at it survival will be fucked from the start if they let transfers make it to live.
---
Those perks also apply to workshops. Workshops technically have an incentive to take them from other players (even though they're really not worth the effort). Camps still don't reward you in any way by destroying them. Destroying a camp is just being a dick.
---
Dirty cultist 
---
Zenimax probably made sure the producers were onboard with their vision and went from there. The truth is that with Starfield and TES6 on the horizon it will probably be the year 2025 before we even hear whispers of the next single player FO game. There is no way in hell Zenimax is willing to go ~8 years without reaping potential profits from Fallout players. So, this is what we get. A flipped online version of FO4 designed to milk cash from FO diehards and MMO gamers in the meantime.

Thank you for letting me know about this. Sucks that I'll have to get to level 100 a 3rd time just for one trophy, but I honestly don't think we will see this patched either. I've already complained several times to Bethesda support about it... Since then, 2 patches have came out and neither fixed the issue.
---
Get out of my wasteland 
---
It’s a lot of questing to randomly stumble upon the enclave, and even if you know where to go you still have to do a lot of work and then go try to find legendaries or farm the cancer bats. On top of that it was glitched till this month to where she could stop taking damage. 
---
It doesn't matter, people can just buy all weapons, items and armour of any type
---
Sugar grove best for springs
---
The Star Spangled Man with a Plan.
---
And apparently also a TSE Shotgun.
---
There also need to be option to join 50+lvl servers (both modes) only so all quest/event rewards are scaled to maximum and we can enjoy whole map not only few locations
---
I feel like Bethesda went half in with every system rather than dedicating to one. 
---
They did say it would be survival light, but that's turned out to mostly be meter baby sitting with no actual fear of survival. 
---
Rabble rabble. Glad to see you run white knight. I applaud this man and would love to run through her base myself! 
---
Nope, PVP, whatever the game, is the cheapest way to keep players busy with adding only the minimal content to the game.
---
Hell yeah! 
---
&gt; Unfortunately, with stacking bobbleheads and perks, this damage can still be big enough to take out players in one shot.
---
This is 100% false.
---
Gotta draw in those Fortnite players for their money.
---
And so the dupers will own the pvp servers
---
As the post says this isnt about player progression its about keeping the characters that have used exploits out of the new server. Without all of the duped items in the economy we wont have every player using god tier legendaries they bought off of a duper, it will be a fresh economy. You also wont have level 100 players two days in due to the xp exploits it will be a much more balanced progression this time around. Plus the first week or so of everyone grinding to 50 will probably have legitimately balanced pvp encounters since everyone will be underpowered. I just cant see how transfers are a good idea other than no lifers being salty about losing their gear.

4) I (and several others) are not getting the Fallout Forever trophy. We have determined that the cause is related to the Monster Mash event, as another redditor made a new character, got it to level 100, and the only thing they did differently was not go anywhere near Watoga.

Fountain?
---
I've noticed around found around foundation pieces that there's an invisible ramp basically that I can walk up. It's really weird happens a few times every build doesn't effect my aniliyto build or anything. 
---
Oh for fucks sake, if they’d said “You will HAVE to make a new character for survival” you’d see everyone screaming about Bethesda “Forcing me to play the game over again just to experience the full content” 
---
Downvote me if you all want but i for one am looking forward to killing and eating unwary vault dwellers. Will I get sniped, one shotted, hammer smashed, exploded, etc. by other players? 
---
You bet your ass. 
---
But I’ve played Ark so I have no fear of “losing some aid items and extra caps”
---
Still excited I can be a cannibal raider. 
---
Will I be a dick...maybe if I think it’s justified... but otherwise, nah. I’m just gonna have fun with it. You know...like a game. 
---
Now quit your complaining and let me enjoy this dirty wastelander (and I’m not talking about the drink)
---
I actually ran over to a stack of firewood in ESO the other night trying to harvest it. 
---
By forcing players to reset entirely you’re giving the game back to the people with limitless video game time while simultaneously alienating entire groups of players that will either create characters “too late” or never bring a character to life due to the ridiculous KILL fest that comes with a PvP map. This shit is for you and your buds to say, “hey, do you want to party up and hop into the...MUTHA-FUCKIN THUNDERDOME!!!!” Here’s the deal, though, you’re right about duped weapons. They’ve got to go...like three weeks ago.
---
Yes. I still won't ever attack if I know there's still no incentive other than "get away from me" 
---
It's not the loot it's the opportunity for emergent gameplay. Finding another player goes from an uninteresting encounter to a life or death situation and it allows for more player agency. Imagine walking through a building interior and suddenly seeing another player, do you kill him before he sees you? do you try to talk? do you just run away? its much more interesting than spamming emotes at someone or just slapping them hoping they want to fight back. It will be even more exciting if noone shows up on the map.
---
This is probably the best idea I've read about survival this morning.
---
I’m lvl 45 now and don’t even know what the Scorched earth event is. 
---
Serving the needs and desires of the majority of people sounds a lot like communism to me.
---
Not sure thats correct as it cannot be placed in containers, when it dropped you see it like in the high school a big mask on the ground.
---
Says the dumbass who immediately starts insulting people who are having a civil discussion. The game isn't an MMO, but you can't deny it's trying to be MMO-esque, or have MMO-like elements. Borderlands and Destiny both have MMO elements, especially with their raid content that can take quite a while. Eventually, it's pretty damn likely that Falllout 76 will have raid content too. It would be stupid not too.
---
Haha its 3:30 am for me, I meant foundation and I said foundation again later on. I fixed my mistake :p
---
I was thinking more of the post that referenced a video because you did say that it was proved right here on this very sub. This YouTube link is not coming from a post that was on this sub as far as I know. I’m sure I could YouTube search it too but it doesn’t mean a post exists disproving the theory on this very sub. 
---
I guess it is kind of dumb that I was on the inside of the camp and had to pick the lock to get out though. However, being in power armor and level 97 it seemed a little strange to be picked off with one shot from a level 36 player
---
Don't let the vault door pinch your ass on the way out!
---
The weapon.
---
This deserves a bethesda reply and a massive thumbs up. They need you on their team 
---
Maybe they can remove PvP from adventure mode entirely.
---
There is one in the voting station in Berkeley Springs, found it yesterday (on a table I guess).
---
I’ll come back to the game if something like this happens 
---
Though it as much. Does it stop you from building.i feel like people don't notice
---
I imagine you wont get a bounty for killing players in this game mode. Bounties will most likely be fore destroying camps or stealing from workshops.
---
apparently what we have now is “adventure” and survival is just adventure but with more killing. murder adventures
---
Just looking around... thanks for checking in, though.
---
So maybe they shouldn't be focusing their efforts on adding more content for the tiny percentage of players who rushed their way to the "endgame" and then rushed to the forums to whine for more more more.
---
Learn to prioritize what you need. Ditch extra weapons, armour ammo you are not using. Keep the minimum of junk you barely use &amp; prioritize junk you need for crafting or repairs.
---
Some games are meant to be enjoyed over time, not rushed.
---
Being late in the game and still frequently fighting low level mole rats at all is also bad game design
---
Very much doubt cheaters are going to head off to pvp servers, there going to stay on the pvep servers to continue to grief the non pvpers. 
---
So 100% there's no duping now...?
---
You mean that Bethesda should cater to the minority of angry forums posters who want to create the impression of a widespread consensus where none actually exists.
---
tbh they should keep the level 5 pvp restriction in survival, it will give new players a chance to fan out a bit before the pvp fest starts.
---
I think they wanted to try different things and until they settled into a stable critical mass to populate two separate game modes, this was the best solution.
---
Depends on how I'm trying to build. One of my character's camps is on a hill so I have a flat area then add the foundation ramp to go a little higher and a small walkway of foundation then another ramp leading to another large flat area. The ramps make a sort of S shape in my layout where the turns are ramps rest is foundation and the invisible wall ramp thing cuts into my walkway, which is only one foundation wide, so I float through there and it just annoys me
---
Kinda says something doesn't it....gaming companies should start having a higher standard and there marketing departments should be reined in before the games go live making bold comments and statement's that just turn out to be lies to drive sales
---
Why invest in new content when you can just recycle the old content and turn it into an e-sport?
---
You realize that was because of the xp exploit right? Forcing new characters in hardcore will prevent the exactly thing you are complaining about. 
---
Yeah that will be just before the next cash grab....erm quality product is ready for public consumption
---
Yeah because then people would shriek in rage and threaten people with death every time they decided to change something after in house testing and the release plans change.
---
the only "endgame" content
---
I don’t mind pvp. If anything it’ll encourage players to group up. The problem with it is that it’s poorly balanced since Fallout is a PVE game.  Melee builds can 3-4 shot you in X-01 and Ultracite Power Armor with the right perks. 2 Shot, Explosive legendaries are brokenly op and are determined by RNG. Not to mention most players into pvp mainly pick on lower levels with legendary explosives or some op weapon. 
---
IMO, if they’re gonna do pvp servers, have no legendary weapons drop, balance melee a bit and  make power armor feel like power armor against players. 
---
okay bye
---
Level difference isnt the issue its keeping exploit tainted characters and items out of the server. Level scaling will keep new players safe enough plus there is little incentive for higher level players to kill newer players. Even if little timmy does find an asshat thats killing lowbies for fun he can just server hop real quick and be on his happy little way. We all want whats best for little Timmy.
---
I'm not pretending they don't drop normally....i said they were rare. Like you just confirmed 466 hours 2 drops that's rare.
---
Of course you can level up on PVP servers running your own race, have you ever played any other game on PVP severs? people don't just sit around waiting to die at the starter areas ya know, there never as bad as people like you make out. It's not death after death after death after death you get that right?
---
I can help you but it would have to be some time Friday add me if you still need help brandyalexander1 
---
Ha! What are the odds one of you would manage to see this post.  I was also low on all ammo going in and managed to break a gun, though luckily that occurred about the time I started lobbing grenades.  I was actually about to log before I saw the second nuke drop.  Figured what the hell, another day, another CTD.  Glad it worked out.  
---
I assumed you were straight melee build with how effectively you were exploding things.  Good fun, whatever the case, and it was nice to finally go ham on an SBQ and not waste bullets.  And thanks as well.  I'm pretty sure you punched several things that were about to kill me.
---
Hardcore path of exile is fine and has a healthy community. DayZ and H1Z1 arent good examples considering the base game failed too lmao.
---
Not sure if there’s a way to fix it. But you aren’t alone. I have the same issue with mine. 
---
Yes it tkaes time to get your gear, thats the whole point. Every one on the server will have to put in the same amount of time to get there gear. Whether they start playing now or in 1 years time theyve still got to put in the same amount of time.
---
By your reckoning, they should open a server one day and it should never take new players after that as they be "behind"....
---
Aw damn so it is actually a thing and it's not just me aha
---
But they could still server hop :/
---
Roses are red, rad storm is weather.
---
I'm just holding on for Skyrim Together.
---
I've been trying every machine I see and no pie. Then I stumble on the broken machine and got one for free.
---
Now I'm still trying every machine because I feel annoyed I didn't get one from a working machine...
---
Think I've got post traumatic pie disorder.
---
Preach it, brother 
---
The more i think about it the more i regret fallout 4 system. It was not perfect but by keeping the SPECIAL point cap at level 50, and thinking long and hard about what should be perk, that should be mutations, and what could be pipboy/vats upgrades BGS could propose something that makes sense.
---
Then don’t. It’s not like you HAVE to play survival mode. You can stick with the general population that’s littered with the effects of dupers, and those that would rather play the game on a level playing field can start a new character in survival. 
---
Considering the majority are in favor of separation it leads me to believe more people would be playing in this game mode than adventure. The only argument against it is boohoo my gear is gone.
---
LoL You are so up your own ass you think you're seeing the sunrise.
---
Loadouts are just a stopgap system. The whole thing needs to be reworked.
---
The level 5 pvp restriction will keep you from killing people right out of the vault. Will be interesting to see what happens at whitesprings though.
---
Gotcha
---
Yeah it would be probably the best if it repaired properly like every other melee weapon. Hope they fix it. 
---
I love the idea of killing someone for their gear. High risk high reward is what pvp should be. If you want to be safe all the time stay in adventure mode buddy. Its a better move for the sake of endgame and stimilulating the in game economy to make it possible to loot other players gear. Runescape was largely successful as an mmo BECAUSE OF THE HIGH RISK HIGH REWARD CONCEPT.  There is a reason why that game lost 80k daily users when they took pvp out for a time.
---
Real shit. On the xbox I compare my stats with friends anyway, stuff like levels reached or quests completed. If I can to that *while* playing the game in question, more power to me then.
---
This will probably come out if they bring in faction based PvP, but I want more faction camp items. 
---
I don't want to build a log cabin, I want to build a BoS/Enclave themed military outpost. They have some military looking items, but not a lot. 
---
How is presenting a wide array of challenges that require varied levels of force responses bad game design?
---
Nah garbage PR is garbage PR.
---
No one is asking for tie scales, they just want to know after almost 3 months now wtf is Bethesda doing, because servers are still un-stable, duping is still thriving and people are still selling items on ebay, that along with all the bugs and other exploits going on Bethesda coming out with empty vague statements is just an insult to customers.
---
r/iamverybadass
---
I noticed it as well. I guess it's there to eliminate any issues with getting onto a foundation without stairs - especially when the foundations are close to the ground. 
---
But it actually limits your building freedom if you put foundations on different levels right next to one another (by utilizing the ramps so they don't snap unintentionally). The invisible walls on the sides of the foundations them prevent you from activating any furniture behind it. 
---
Anyway a "serious" PVP mode is DOA with a 2-3 tick per second netcode.
---
Which was 2 months and a bit ago...
---
To be fair i only use melee. I reject tse weapons and the use of duped ones
---
None of us care about high level players we care about exploiters. How will you feel when Dupemaster69 pops 50 bobbleheads to become invincible then bulldozes you with no counterplay. A new economy is the best thing that could ever happen to this game and people are gonna ruin it because they dont wanna lose their precious legendaries.
---
the best way to balance a powerful round is through the handling of the guns. I guess for the best example would be hip fire in Killzone 2 where the first few rounds would be on point from an automatic but shot grouping decays exponentially.
---
I am excited for survival mode. I just hope we cant take adventure progress into survival. I want a fresh start. But then the mode will be fun.
---
We usually only go for high lvl ppl able to rebuild tbh
---
Some hauls are just not worth the caps friend.
---
haha is it even e-sport if its not a fair battlefield? 
---
Servers this unstable, duping and ebaying still going on and bobblehead stacking along with other exploits.
---
I'd say there going for bigger clusterfuck than e-sport but hey there's PVE content coming soon(tm)
---
Bethesda are a joke at this point
---
Fallout has always been offline game too. Because Fallout has been offline game, doesn't mean they can't take up new genre and build new game. If they can make Online game, they can also make PVP game and actually the current playerbase is minority, because majority of the player already left, because they decided to cater this minority playerbase and make this boring, easy, shallow, challengeless game.
---
What's the issue? It's not like they would have taken time away from working on content just to add this - wouldn't have taken much work. Just making a few servers use a different pvp ruleset (ie removed slap system, changed spawn location after death). Gives the many players interested in pvp somewhere to look for fights without annoying other players. Basically the hunter/hunted system but the whole server has opted in.
---
Literally a win/win. 
---
Its not about op players its about exploiters. The exploits were fixed and a fresh server means none of the negative economy effects will be present. Did you read the post?
---
break it early test application, perhaps
---
A middle ground would be to keep your character but stripped of all inventory.
---
Some part of adventure progress would transfer (perks, known crafts) but it would somewhat level the playfield.
---
Then this "survival mode" should exclude legendary drops, power armors and mutations entirely.
---
Hadn't thought about that
---
Just trying to keep them entertained until there is a better game or more contentin this one. Keeping them engaged so far is actually failing. Even with RP layered on top. We've frankly started to slot in Anthem as a replacement possibly....
---
I like pvp. And if they give us a fresh start and dont let adventure loot pour into survival, I will play the heck out of survival. 
---
I can and do deny that it is trying to be an MMO. It is not massively multiplayer by any stretch of the imagination and the influx of MMO culture into this game is a cancer that is causing it and the rest of us trying to play the game great suffering.
---
The closest thing 76 has to raid content is the Events, which they are actively working on right now. Workshops could also fit that role, which they will probably be focusing on after working on Events for the next dev cycle.
---
I love you post, but PLEASE DONT TAKE AWAY MY POWER SAWS / TOOLS
---
This game isn’t selling so well you can stand by the start spawn and see a constant stream of new players walking out or anything. 
---
That’s a great build, I’ve only just finished the first camp I’m “proud” of, but looking at yours makes me think I’ve gotta up my game lol, beautiful job OP 
---
Well...now we know that this year we won't see much new content for FO76. If they are mainly focusing to create PvP-only mode with same content as we have already it is just waste of developing time. We can almost say now that game will be dead very soon. Even if rewards are better it doesn't make PvP mode any more interesting. Most of the people already have all best weapons and gears because dupers.
---
I've had some issues with retrieving stuff that I accidentally put next to foundations. Had to remove the foundation first. 
---
What? Class Freak o my suppressed the negative effects for one hour?
---
That means people would get banned for disconnects.
---
The only way to "download" it would be to print it page by page.  There are other ways, but this is easiest.
---
As long as I can buy it on the duping sites, I'll take one
---
It's just PR garbage.
---
The dev's had nothing, 3 months in and still nothing so are trying to rush this shit out. 
---
Community managers only comments have been "yay no more lists" and "were listening, don't worry were listening and there stuff coming soon". 
---
Soon never comes with Bethesda or they literally have no clue what it means, and they are clearly not listening other wise this wouldn't have been there first big content drop.
---
This is how they wanted the game originally without slap damage that was added at the last minute to appease the PVE people that said they weren't going to pre order - so pretty much a version of the game that they intended to launch, but now here it is being banded around as new content.
---
Bethesda = Greed &gt; Customers
---
The reason everyone has been farming up tse's like mad is because they are the viable weapon.  My melee character has a decent 10mm smg as his backup ranged weapon.  When he gets circled by sorchbeasts, I will spray 2-3 clips into one and if it's not going to land, I simply server hop.  It's not worth my time to kill one without either a rocking weapon or all of the maxed out perks for guns.  It takes about 15 minutes and 2000 rounds of ammo, and it's stupid boring.  If they land, then he will kill them in about 5 hits.  I would actually prefer they were just not there.  There's no real reason to want to kill one and I feel like I will end up with a seizure for just looking at my screen intermittently.
---
I also have a sniper character with a tse lever action that will down the bats in about 8 shots.  As overpowered as that seems, that character dies a lot more than the melee guy.
---
Or that the players are whiny and always need something to bitch about. 
---
Given that matches current politics and society as a whole, I'm more likely to believe this line of thinking.
---
Just never ever use pack rat and STASH only junk, which is the only thing you can loose on death.
---
Perks can't apply to STASH because there is no system to manage what would happen if you remove the perk and your STASH get "overencumbered"
---
Well, it's not really a joke.
---
I don't want to start all over just because you guys have too much freetime.  
---
Fallout is never fair. It's all luck based. You can be a very good player and still end up without TSE and enough dmg, just because you're never lucky. 
---
Which further proves the point that the vast majority of players RO NOT WANT pvp content. 
---
With 23 other players per servern it is 100% possible to get that achievement on your first day. 
---
These statistics show that players are ACTIVELY AVOIDING pvp. 
---
Maybe after the beta period, (Survival hardcore with permadeath would be rad.) but during the beta they will get better data if the whole range of players can try Survival.
---
There are PLENTY of viable builds, what you re looking for is plenty of OP builds
---
I know that one duping method is still in the game. I wont go into detail, but it doesnt crash servers, cant be done in camps, and is probably not used to exponentially copy items like the other methods. I am just saying this because there is this weird paranoia towards people in camps and server crashes always being dupe related.
---
If people are getting disconnected enough that it triggers a ban for server hopping, they should be on the horn with tech support to track down the issue anyway.
---
W00by*
---
Why Doesnt this post have more likes lol?
---
Damn right, QA is for losers.
---
Then you could put on pack rat, store a bunch of stuff, and then swap your perks and have a thousand pounds in your stash.
---
How did a newborn make this post? 
---
You must not know of the disconnection issues this game has on a regular basis for most people.
---
&gt;	Get 10 people who love Fallout games for all different reasons together and you can hammer out these systems in a week that everyone can enjoy.
---
Actually, you’re more likely to get at least two murders and any number of broken noses. 
---
Same people that said “wait to play the game before being critical”, I should know, cause I said that haha this survival mode is the WORST thing they could’ve cooked up. Way to kill a game, hope nobody’s buying stuff in the Atom Shop, won’t matter soon...
---
I know that people lie on reddit about a lot of "bugs" this game supposedly has.
---
Read the post. WE WANT TO SEPERATE OUR SELVES SO YOU HONEST PVERS CAN PLAY IN PEACE!! 
---
Then us pvpers can fight with other pvpers only.
---
The problem is we cant when we are stuck in with the only pve world. We have to find a way to enable pvp and sadly raiding people is the most universal trigger to do so. Please dont blame us for a poorly thought out design by bethesda's baby gating pvp and only having a pve mode at launch.
---
Tbh if anyone asks us im sure we could pay for your repairs. There isnt any real malicious intent in our clan just trying to play in our playstyle. The game just wasnt designed at launch to address it at all. This is due to bethesda's deep roots in single player offline games. We hope by them making this mode we can all enjoy the game in our own ways to the fullest.
---
Agree with you wholeheartedly, though, if you activate the TV doesnt it display a static picture of some landscape?
---
hmmm nah I'm going to go with customers over corporations on this one i think.
---
Current politics and society has nothing to do with it, greed is greed.
---
No its a give us our own server to kill other pvpers instead of peaceful pvers.
---
Its so everyone can enjoy the game in 2 different play styles to the fullest
---
Because Atom store crap...erm content and survival mode is more important to Bethesda apparently.
---
I'm not saying I want anything removed. I want more weapons to be relevant. Mr handy shouldn't need to be over repaired to be useful. A small buff? Sure. An order of magnitude is moronic. If it's 65 over repaired, it should be 55 for it's entire normal durability. Not 6. 
---
Is that a bone cutter? Gears!
---
To be fair, they were very upfront that they were working on a new PVP mode. If your expectations weren't in line with that, that's on you and not them. 
---
The Atomic Shop is a slap in the face to anybody who’s stuck around at this point. Beth just keeps adding to it, fixing 2 bugs, creating 14 more bugs and calling it a day. They should be giving out Atom Shop shit for free at this point, but nah, we’re just $ to them, they don’t care about our feedback or if we enjoy this game, survival mode is proof of that.
---
Agree with everything except that launching the nuke was not cool. I think it is a cool function that can be adapted to more content and I think it was a nice ”end” or new beginning to the main quest.
---
But overall I ageee.
---
Comparing fallout 76 to wow has to be the dumbest thing ive read in a while.
---
A community manager said this earlier:
---
"Hi everyone,
---
Thank you for all of the feedback so far on the details we posted about Survival mode earlier today! We'll make sure your thoughts about the mode here and in the future are shared with the dev team. The article mentions this already, but I wanted to restate that we're still iterating and actively working on Survival mode, so things aren't necessarily set in stone, and your continued feedback will be very important to us as we move toward beta, and eventually release.
---
This is also just the beginning of the conversation. We'll be looking to share more about the new mode with you in Inside the Vault, streams, and other means, and also talk more with you about what you'd like to see in Survival mode as we move forward.
---
Thanks and please keep the feedback coming!
---
**EDIT:** We’re also seeing the thoughts being shared by those of you who’d like to see more PVE content, and while I can’t spoil any details just yet, I will say that Survival mode won't be the only new content coming to Fallout 76, so stay tuned!"
---
you can't make PVE and PVP balanced without completely separate the systems. You can't make e-sport with 1 tick per second servers. 
---
I'll keep my cowardly casual ass in PVE fo76 and hope they add a popcorn crafting recipe.
---
I completely agree, like (forgive me for sullying the world of FO:76) No Mans Sky. 
---
Your character cannot move between game modes.
---
PVE content is coming around the same time as PVP content from what one of the community manager has said. They just announced the latter first for some reason. Probably should have done both at the same time.
---
I disagree about making PVP punishing makes it not fun. The entire thrill of PVP in games like rust and DayZ is the risk of losing everything and the reward of gaining everything.
---
I agree with all your other points. 
---
Could you name it? I know the one for workshops, but don't recall ones for camps.
---
Nah. I was talking about the similar nature of the general public to bitch about every little thing. 
---
Gamers do much the same. Get a feature you wanted, well "who asked for that". Granted I wouldn't put fo76 exactly square in the right of that, but saying that you'd always take the customer over the developer is as silly as saying you'd take the developers over the customer. I didn't say that either. 
---
Overall, you might think you're fighting some "good fight" but ultimately, over a game, you're fighting a small fight. Game developers might try to hype up their games ridiculously, but honestly I'd say they're probably just pretty hyped themselves. 
---
Now, ISPs, food companies, oil, etc, that's where you'll find more of your issues that you should be throwing up arms about. But... Wait .. no, no one really does. We just bitch about a video game "taking all our money". 
---
So yes, I do blame the players. They don't fight for their wages, they don't fight for proper rights, nor do they seem to properly care about having decent internet to play or download these games. 
---
Instead, blame the servers rather than the networks in between. Easy to do since a player wouldn't know the difference. 
---
So, yes, politics and society has every bit to do with it.
---
And yet here we are, playing a game that as a series satirizes the very thing you ignore and fall into. Odd, really. 
---
If you started and maintained a character from the beta you didn’t get the leaving the vault unlock
---
I'm presuming you don't even pvp at all from some of those comments... or even build camps...
---
Why not just call it what it is. Duper supremacy. 
---
Tbh there is a few pvp clans for fo76. I know there is a group literally called The Gunners. Name clearly inspired by fo4s Gunners. Im not sure if they
---
RP at all. They used a variety of stuff so they just use whatever. 
---
They want to compete with Fortnite in some manner and this is how they’re trying. May even take “Survival Mode” F2P and actually get some Atom sales for once, cause I don’t think anyone actually buys those. I never see anybody with a bunch of shit from the shop, it’s always like a one time purchase they made with free Atoms lol
---
Yeah I second this.  With the Dragon and a crit or sneak shot against someone that's stolen my workshop or tagged as wanted, I can one shot right through power armor.  
---
Ha ha the EZ 3k upvotes.
---
So dumb dumb dumb that they would even consider this. No way I'll be playing it. "encourage you to start a new..." Yeah by allowing others with level 100 1-shot melee builds in there from the off...
---
housing, roleplay, wander around. lots of thing happens on the periphery of that ironsight.
---
Totally agree. Put everyone at fresh start, no TSE or god-tier Assassins gear.
---
People won't play with their main accounts if you risk losing aid items you have farmed for long.
---
&gt; On second thought just do whatever the sub cries about, because this sub knows what's good for f76 
---
I'm not gonna lie, I'm a bethesda fanboi at heart and I support this game but I'm seriously wondering if even beth do know what is good for Fo76 lately. I'm no whiny paragraphs enthusiast but unfortunately there are several points on the posts you're talking about that raises real concerns for the future of the game. 
---
I wish at some point the game settles for good and bethesda take the right decisions so we can go back to memes, guides and camp screenshots on this sub instead of QQ monologues.
---
and armor!
---
/pathead
---
i agree...i played fallout 4 for years without finishing it and it was still fun..so.many.quests..awesome..iv played 76 since the launch..done every single quest and  now its boring..all i seem to do is farm for plastic to bulk all my junk to sell it for caps..that or farm legendaries to try and get a tse..which after 290hrs of playing still havent found one. dont know how much longer i can keep playing this unless they give us more quests.
---
NO ONE will play the beta if you start it like this. Or if they do they'll insta-quit pretty soon after when that level 100 wrecks their new character. How can you not see it???
---
Unless season is a year, this game is hardly compatible with that idea.
---
Well, the criticism is well deserved. 
---
If there is no legendary item. make the kill and death be scary and rewarding. At your death, drop your actual weapon, part of your aids (10-20% ?) and part of your ammos (10-20% ?)
---
And people can loot it from your dead body.
---
You'll be able to recraft them if you stocked some junk.
---
Make the game a survival hardcore one. It would add tension over every encounter, player and monsters.
---
The death isn't punishing at all actually. So the pvp.
---
Bilbo: "i am going on a adventure!!" 
---
Completely agree with you.
---
So you don't? You waste 3 points having them equipped all the time? Wonder what other useless cards you carry about, just so you're not trying hard?
---
*whispers* you know its one of the highest dps weapons for 2H now? as there is no swing time and dose damage per server tick. 
---
mine dose about 70 damage and 46 elec per tick, faster than my super sledge with 40% faster swing time. 
---
Explosive shotguns won’t even be much of a problem after the tse nerf, dense armour, fireproof perk, sorted both things anyone can obtain easily 
---
Tbh if you hit lvl 50 there is zero lvl advantage once you hit that point. Thats the standard plateau. You have to fit a limited build within it. Just because we have a higher lvl then that doesnt mean we can fit more beyond a lvl 50 can.
---
Can someone make the FO76 esports meme already! PVPing while flying on jetpack is the selling point!
---
I never said it wasn't.
---
You know, I needed that. I'm scared tbh. I can't worry about a game. I might have to leave my home. Lol. 
---
So again, this is a small thing in the grand scheme of things. Yes, I always expect games to do better. But I've seen time and again that even when they do, people don't care. In fact, they can still get upset when a feature works as advertised.
---
I care, but I also feel the customers can be too harsh. A prime example: ask any retail worker. It doesn't feel any different than that.
---
Especially with the character transfer. They're so short-sighted. I bet that idea to remove two shot from the loot pool wasn't a mistaken communication they actually thought it was a good idea then back-peddled. Clueless.
---
You clearly never played ark. Fallout 76 is like ark for children. This game is extremely easy compared to it and ark is not “twitch reflex” at all. Heck if fo76 had better  better pvp i would play it more. 
---
Ark is pretty pvp focused and it plays a little like ark. Fo76 should of created servers like ark has to split up pvp with pve. More people will gravitate to pvp if you make factions and allow open world pvp where you can loot player gear because it will end up as a source of income.  If you think pvp is a waste you are delusional. There is a reason why single player rpgs are falling off. 
---
No, we don't like the proposed mode as desribed because it won't be worth playing and we want something worth playin.
---
Survival isn't necessarily only for deathmatch style PvP.  I played Everquest on Rallos Zek for about a year back in the day and only ever fought a handful of people.  
---
I am very interested in Survival mode as a mostly Solo player who occasionally groups up for Events.
---
Fuck new content, fix the damn servers and balance the content that already exists.
---
Great idea
---
I agree with your logic and I also do not believe PvP is lore breaking. Unfortunately a large part of the player base does believe it is. Hell you summed up perfectly what I was trying to say about backstories and what it is that makes up fallout.
---
PS4. Had my camp stripped bare once early on, annoyed the shit out of me. Second time someone tried I logged out. It's not exclusive to pc.
---
I always keep a few bottles of liquor and Quack Surgeon, just in case.
---
Read the post again this months patch will include pve elements
---
Hello, last night i noticed i wasn't losing anymore any radiations after my deaths. Maybe was i glitched temporarly, or something changed in the latest patch ? (PS4)
---
I'll stay in adventure mode anyways
---
This conveys my sentiment since the announcement of f76. 
---
BETA
---
When it comes out with tons of bugs "It Just Works" dang it does work if you want to buy and game to repair pipes and have it crash about 6 times a day.......
---
Add me PSN Grendalzzz I'll be on in an hour or two
---
Well you know, making online Fallout changes things. I think fair PvP has a place in this game.
---
I dont believe we need new servers. Separating PvPers and Carebears is wrong. If they need safe zones like little towns then so be it but too completely alienate a entire player base because we like a certain part of the game more than other parts? That's the equivalent of saying if you want to roleplay you need to be on your server, if you think super mutants are people too and shouldn't be harmed you need your own server with no hostile super mutants. Its flawed logic to separate us because people want their own little utopia in the post apocalypse. 
---
It's probably Bethesda, apparently they banning all dupers....how are they selling items if they are banned?
---
I bet Bethesda would make more on ebay selling TSE weapons than they do trying to charge £6 for single hair styles on the Atom Store.
---
&gt;  This makes absolutely zero sense, and I'm so disheartened.  
---
'
---
Then don't play it. 
---
This is needed, maybe not for you. But for those who want a challenge it is. 
---
It’s not a beta for the game. It’s a beta for new content they are adding. Better to test it and get feedback than add a broken mode.
---
Its been a few years since I've seen a game that utilized helmets as armor and didn't offer a option to not cosmetically show the helmet.
---
Try slap damage with TSE shotgun on the ground with each of 8-9 pellets doing slap damage to each of 5-6 hit zones. Then report back.
---
I'm having the same thing, never had this before. And my ps4 plus subscription is still valid. 
---
Along Bethesda to do something right os like praying to God for a unicorn to appear and suck your dick.
---
Why not a Game+ mode like the Witcher 3 tried. Where all enemies are much harder. Gear is higher level and you start the grind again.
---
Can bring none legendary items with you only in your stash and only able to wear your under armor suit when you transfer into the survival server.
---
That way no duped gear comes with. Players aren’t immediately defenseless and killed repeatedly when they start.  
---
So what you bring with you is pretty much made redundant after a few levels by higher level gear.
---
Which should make a somewhat even playing field. 
---
I'm so try hard I'm using Green Thumb and Pannapictagraphist while running around, gonna add Fortune Finder to the 3 points I have in Perception. Sometimes Concentrated Fire for combat situations, or Glow Sight rank 3 for nuke zones.
---
So soon (tm)
---
Stash increased to 750 in 2020?
---
So people can miss label guns as two shot and rip off noobs. Seems like a great idea.....
---
Fallout had always been a single-player game before this title. So what's the difference, really?
---
SUBSCRIBE 
---
Turd Ferguson.  Funny name. 
---
It's coming don't you worry!
---
Well have perk packs and lunch box's on the store to go with it!
---
idk man maybe. Do you come to reddit to whine to the developers to give you more power because you don't feel powerful enough in your video game fantasy?
---
Well, people are SUPPOSED to make shitty excuses for their agressive, predatory ways of venting their real life frustration.
---
No disagree. For anyone who actually legit get their own legendary gear instead of buying from duper its impossible to compare someone has been farming endgame content and newly hit lv50 FYI a lot of mmo that has fair pvp endgame meta gear are unique untradeable . Let alone duplication 
---
Is that where you get the plan to build one? I’ve seen 1 person have a shower built but no idea how he got it
---
It's all completely meaningless if any kind of legendary weapons are allowed at all.   Long term, it will make absolutely no difference that everyone is required to start a new character.  Those who find favor with the RNG gods will be one- shit killing everyone else within weeks. And don't assume that Bethesda will have stopped all duping by then.  That's highly unlikely. So being required to start a new character isn't enough.   Zero legendary weapons of any kind, no bobbleheads or any of the usual stuff that dupers can stack to make themselves OP. Otherwise,  the mode is completely broken from day one.
---
Take a power plant workshop. Build a fusion reactor to power the core extractor. Hang aroung for 1hr collecting. Boom 8 cores!
---
There is so much truth in this. It should be so easy to fix the game and give users what they want. Just looking at the top posts on this subreddit on a daily basis is a damn cheat sheet to what people want changed or added.
---
The answers to the test are here! 
---
Sweet thanks!
---
Tbh I hope next tier if they ever planning on release 4,5 star legendary. I’d like to see it being untraceable cuz buying and duping u didn’t earn it that why the end game grinding feels boring
---
To add to what Kingoftown said Psychotats and Calmex aren't rare you just need to farm the locations where there are lots of meds not in containers (containers are on personal timers). The new character I just leveled up to 47th in a location with one has so many meds I sell most of them as easily carryable high value sellables. They've looted so many that that I spread the rest out for all my other characters. I've found a few locations like that while exploring so they're easy to find.
---
Heard that before...
---
Power up power plants, then you can power the fusion core processors at their whorkshops. 
---
Yeah having stash space will give me the ultimate power to fast travel and sprint.
---
Very much this - any regular player can level and equip very quickly.
---
The enclave sells the recipes. ;)
---
So in essence, your point is that you are harrassing PVE players so that they put pressure on BSG to satisfy your demands ?
---
That isnt level advantage thats gear advantage. Different concept. Bethesda has to find all the bugs first then honestly a mass server wipe of everything
---
You can also sell, trade, or even just drop stuff you don't need.
---
They bought a studio with PvP experience
---
Where do you get the mods?
---
Your description of the issues makes me think you used to be a griefer in GTAO in this "past life".
---
well, because the world in FO4 is not even half as interesting as the world in FO76 IMO
---
No we are just trying to play the game how we like. Sadly we cant filter who gets caught in so we arent trying to filter. Just going playing the game in the way we enjoy to. Sadly what we find fun and what others find fun clash
---
Lmao first fix crashing lol the server stability is shit atm especially during event like SBQ
---
I couldn't agree more. Problem is that this community is composed of 90% singleplayer fans who just came here because they were expecting a singleplayer co-op fallout 5 story driven game. It is literally impossible to please them unless they fully remake the game into fallout 5. It is easier to cater to the 10% multiplayer fans because i think this is what Bethesda had in mind from the start, to take the Fallout 4 engine and give multiplayers fans something to enjoy too until they give singleplayer fans Fallout 5. But singleplayers fans are greedy wanting everything to cater just for them. Even though the pvp has separate servers i'm still glad we get atleast that. It's hard to voice your opinion when 90% of the audience can never be pleased and will try their best to ruin the game for the rest of us just to teach Bethesda a lesson to never cater to us again.
---
The ultra weak guns are what kills the game for me.
---
When hooting a dozen shotgun shells at point blank directly into the head of my enemy doesn't kill him, I just get bored. The lethality of all guns needs to go way up. When I hear someone firing at me, I should feel the urge to dodge for cover, not just sit still waiting for them to hit me so I can see the on screen indicator of where its coming from (because it deals so little damage it's easier just to get shot and locate the enemy).
---
It's fine that gun damage scales with level and that low level guns are weaker, but the damage still needs to be improved by a huge amount. Anything without strong armor should still be able to be taken down in just a few shots. Make enemies' guns stronger to compensate as well, but please just make these feel like actual guns and not nerf darts.
---
[I can't help that I need it all.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gj5L9SYhoSE)
---
It's gonna be very funny when everyone wants to farm armor, weapons and dont get the chance to do it because the good farm spots are going to be controlled by groups or other people who already found a good weapon. :D 
---
I'm of this mindset too. Otherwise it could take weeks to get to a point where the devs get to see what kind of havoc end game players can reap.
---
&gt; Why the hell is Bethesda currently devoting a large amount resources to create and then beta test and refine a new PvP mode this early in the games creation,  
---
I'll say it again: if legendary weapons of any kind are allowed in this PVP mode, then the mode is broken from day one. 
---
I don't  care how much they patch duping exploits, the dupers will always new  ways to fuck up the game but proliferating 20 times more OP weapons that Beth intended to have in the game. 
---
This has already broken the normal mode, but it's a far more serious problem in the upcoming PVP mode and will render it virtually unplayable within weeks.
---
Thanks a lot!
---
PvE requires content, PvP needs nothing. Of course they will go with pvp options
---
Don't really agree at all that players don't want survival mode. From the getgo there were many confused and complaining as to why there weren't separate PVE and PVP servers. Survival Mode is basically that PVP server so it is something they should do. They should just at the same time also make changes so PVP is balanced and more rewarding as you said.
---
Don't really agree with your comments on melee weapon balance. It might just be the examples bothering me, but in no way, shape, or form should the sledgehammer and a golf club be doing the same or even similar damage outside of legendary effect.
---
Balancing for energy weapons has been mentioned many times.
---
I don't agree at with your heavy weapons/weight comments. The weight for the biggest stuff is already heavy, and people should be allowed some leeway in their weapons/play style. That said, I can agree to an extent about the need for some re-balancing of the automatic heavy guns. They do tend to either fire to slow or do too little damage.
---
Also not all weapons are supposed to be endgame viable. This has been the case for all Fallout games (at least under Bethesda) from what I can tell. The pool shouldn't be too limited, but not everything needs to be equal either.
---
Alternatively there are bunch PA lying around at fixed location their core usually 50-95% also some place has fusion generator u can loot the core
---
Wrecking ball
---
I've taken to the habit of fixing rare PA mods to spare PA parts to avoid scraping. 
---
Umm... ok?
---
I noticed that you didnt include the Order of Mysteries in the Faction-Based PvP, im curious as to why?
---
So instead of organising or limiting yourself, you make other people's game miserable. Nice way of thinking.
---
So let's see, about the exploits and bugs:
---
Nobody denies that there are exploits and bugs, but Bethesda is actively working on fixing them and especially the last Patch mid-January had some good Bug fixes in it. Sure there is still a bunch of Bugs etc left that needs to be fixed, but this needs time. The whole Exploit using thing only got so huge because of some YouTubers making a Quick Buck on it. The same was it with GTAV for example when this got released and the same kind of Youtubers made the Exploits big, so its nothing new. World of Warcraft, one of the most popular MMORPGs, has the same Bugs (Loot Bug, Mount Bug etc) for Years and the developers don't really fix them (or simply cant). You can Criticise Bethesda for releasing F76 in this State, yes. But you can't criticize that fact that they try to fix it now, which they do and "all of which gets worse and worse with every update" is simply spoken not true at all.
---
On the Topic about server crashes, they are a thing of the past at this Point at least on PC and I don't really hear about this Problem anymore from Console Players as well. Sure sometimes I lose the Connection to the Lobby (happened like once in the past 15 Hours of playing over the last Month), but that's not really all that much.
---
About the " terrible, terrible microtransactions", its Cosmetic Stuff, get over it. If you don't want to spend money on it, then don't do it. This is the same Dumb and Dull Conversation you can have about the "Creation Club", WoW Mounts and Pets that you can Buy, Overwatch Lootboxes and many other Cosmetic Micro Transactions.
---
You are not enforced to Buy the Cosmetic Items, you are not enforced to get them to progress in the Game. The Game does not change for you if you have them, its the same Power Armor just with another Color Code.
---
On the "Name any positive changes they have made since release that isn't nerfed or basic Qo", let's take a look in the Patch Notes ok?:
---
"Lighting: Exposure values have been adjusted for exterior environments, allowing them to appear brighter in dark conditions", makes the Game overall looks nicer and better Viewable when you have a Display with low Brightness. "Depth of Field Setting", makes the Graphics a bit better, AFK Timer: The timer that disconnects players after a period of inactivity in-game has been increased from 10 to 30 minutes, so I don't get Disconnected when I quickly get to the Door or help my Neighbor something really quick. SPECIAL Re-speccing, then you have to think way less about it than before and so on.
---
There were positive changes and implementations, but People who don't like something usually don't look for positive things, they tend to look for negative things :)
---
Exactly, survival of the fittest, or best cooking. 
---
I think with regards to dropping more than just junk when you get killed was something alot of the early comments were. People were complaining that death wasnt risky enough and what was the point of it. 
---
Make inspirational count for each party member, so a party of 4 gets 4x, 3 for 3x, and lots of seasonal goals for XP, like in robot armor season, defeat a nuke silo in under 7 minutes and launch a nuke at Whitesprings and instead of ghouls, make it enraged whitespring robots with a giant Sentry bot with nukes as a raid boss. Make the raid boss drop 10x fusion cores and make these the only way to get fusion cores for the season and now only peeps who defeated the giant sentry can use power armor in Vault 63. Which is full of robots. 
---
Another update well thought through. Good job Bethesda.
---
I’m done hahaha
---
Not getting triggered at all. What I am talking about is "vehicles" not cars perse, in real life we would atleast use a bike when not in PA for some places. encumbered wouldn't be a problem because we would use a shopping cart. It just looks weird that I can't pick up more stuff, when I can make a skateboard with a plank on it to carry it for me, or a Brahmin as a mule, which was what most people thought that would happen before release anyway. I mean everybody was going to be a vendor. And why not use that Brahmin to ride on it for example. They did the same with horses in Skyrim so why not something like that here? 
---
There are many things done in fallout 76 that were not in previous fallouts so they can add other stuff also. I do not want to race around on a motorcycle 200mph, they should change way to much I agree.  
---
But lore wise it makes no sense that I can create a motorized generator to light up my house and pump clean water, but I am incapable of fixing a mopet. 
---
Sadly the post is a lie and I suggest not to post things like that if you haven't done it by yourself. I had an old X-01 set crafted at 50lvl with ~15Int. I'm level 200 now, I have seen plenty posts like that, decided to upgrade my PA. Just a waste od junk. Did it with 35 Int, some parts were actually worse (durability wise, not dmg resistance wise) than these crafted at ~15Int. Its random, but still, the bar itself do not represent dmg resistance at all. Just think about adding a jetpack - durability is reduced then by like 20% but resistance remains the same.
---
If they do this, then adventure mode should be PVE only
---
What's the point in keeping a restricted pvp setting when you can logon with a currentc har to a full pvp environment ...
---
I believe the OP means don't worry about adding fluff to your camp, just the basics. That way it doesn't cost a lot of caps to move early on. It seems like the more stuff that is built, the more it costs to move it. 
---
 rj/ REEEEEEEEE but what about muh immersion and muh camp stash, I don’t want any PvP because I tend to avoid any social interaction REEEE.
---
uj/ In actuality I’m excited about a pvp mode, I think that more pvp events and things like this can make playing with friends even better.
---
I would second that motion. I feel like those should be untradeable. Specially with the state of duping. That way they can lift the time gated bs on them now.
---
Its something like only one 4 star can drop in all the servers within 1 week. And 5 stars 1 i every month across all servers. Thats virtually no one in game can get. Thats morbidly low and kills the point of them existing if you literally can earn it with hard work and dedication. Just dumb luck 
---
When you crawl into dumpsters looking for Caps
---
... I guess you don't realize that MMO means more than the words it's abbreviating. MMO is a style and genre, and has introduced game mechanics and elements into the gaming industry. No one is saying it's literally an massively multiplayer online game, only that it borrows elements from that genre of games.
---
"MMO culture into this game is a cancer that is causing it and the rest of us trying to play the game great suffering". The only way that sentence is true is in regards to farming legendaries, which is extraordinarily grindy. Otherwise, it doesn't apply to anything else whatsoever and the only person making the experience miserable is you.
---
Also, I said that eventually Fallout 76 will likely have raid-like content as it suits this type of game. Events don't come remotely close to raid-like content, except for the Scorchbeast Queen event. Workshops would never be anything remotely close to raid-like content. They would have to drastically change workshops, to the point where they wouldn't look at all similar to what we currently have. In reality, the events for power up the nuclear power plants is fairly raid-like with the large areas, multiple rooms, and the time it takes to complete them. The only thing they lack is additional polish, bosses, and actually worthwhile rewards.
---
I want the flaming laser sword ... I already use an electric one so that one seems quite reasonable. ;)
---
Yeah, I only found out like 2 weeks ago. I had ammo, chem, and food ones and couldn't figure out why I was getting crap for extra stuff. 
---
wow..3 of you killed the sbq..iv been there with about 10 other peeps and we havent even gotten her to half health.. be a lot easier if ultracite ammo was easier to make
---
What we need is first a proper bug fixing on the current content. Then a balacing of weapons / enemies and then and only afterwards - more content. 
---
Otherwise I do agree. Most people (myself included) don't to care at all about PvP. At least not at its current broken state. 
---
I agree on most things but you don't get my point or it is my wrong explanation either way I don't want to drive 200mph on a motorcycle. I just want a bit more realism. 
---
Morrowind had silk striders just to explain how fast travel worked. Fallout has nothing
---
Skyrim had horses and that worked. Why not use a Brahmin to travel or a shoppingkart to carry more weight. 
---
I see stuff lying around but I can't create anything with it. Meanwhile I made a generator that lights up my house and pumps out clean water via my homemade waterfilter. 
---
Afcourse the Stig you mention is more important bit some things just don't add up realism wise. And you can say whatever you want about realism but fallout is aiming for realism. 
---
If pvp'ers are bored in a pve world they should play a real PVP game lol. 
---
It’s crazy to me that the general consensus is that it’s all unbalanced when in fact with the right perk loadout and armor it’s completely flipped. TSE are often quite unable to kill me. With the exception of explosive bobble head stackers, BUT they’d have to use hundreds. 
---
I tested it once, and I withstood 27,000 damage, and that’s solo. With a team and the right shared perks you can outlive TSE, and laugh in their face. 
---
That's why you people are cancer. You are tedious tryhards in everything you do, even discussions.
---
Cool, thanks! 
---
They could have just implemented an option to not show head gear on a player though and still give protection
---
I had 16 as well. Ended up with 2 left when empath was finally gone. Luckily I didnt need another purge after that to get the mutations I wanted
---
I was in my kitchen this morning. I heard a distant train horn and expected the announcement that a nuke was coming in 😂
---
What do you think a lot of players are currently doing?
---
When you reach a certain level &gt;100 there is not much to do anymore. Especially since the endgame weapons will be grinded into dust. 
---
As long as you don't pick up any more teddy bears it keeps its size.
---
Nope they didn't moved but they atleast gave a plausible way for fast traveling. In fallout we just "floomp" are at our destination without any explanation of how we got there. 
---
I hope they add a more hardcore and challenging pve mode.. Maybe make death permanent and crank everything up to the point where partying and auto revive gear are actually valuable. 
---
They wanna pvp in a pve world.  Its like you wanna play  basketball on a tennis court LOL
---
Pretty much this. I imagine it'd be something like how the artillery stash exploit worked. You could overfill your stash box and just leave it stuffed. Then remove your weight reducing perk cards and continue about your way
---
I was laughing at some dude in PA and a pink bat beat me to death, I kept using stimpacks because it was funny. The best part, he finally killed me and got 1 can for his troubles. I came back and sniped him with my explosive dragon. I love all of the rifleman perks and demolition on top of it. There is more, but my build is totally jacked atm. Oh, I took my can back too. 
---
I think Bethesda loves dupers. I will be fun to see the wreckfest. 
---
I did a gunslinger character, but she was 100% dependant on her TSE western revolver, after patch she'll probably be unplayable. Pistols are garbo
---
They could come up something like fusing multiple lower rank legendary weapons to create higher star/rank legendary with little rng on perks so it wouldn’t just be dumb luck and ppl can be motivated through hard work and also won’t be as broken as duplication 
---
Not if the named gun will be bound to your character/account! 
---
tedious try hards? If you have perk load out manager it's a quick profile change.
---
I think its called survival because you have to survive all the dupers. In aventure mode you only have to "survive" so steady server crashes :D
---
Most people go look for materials to craft ammunition though, it's just that crafting .308 isn't really worth it as far as resources required per bullet goes (.50 and 5mm are the definite best in that regard when you use Super Duper and Ammosmith, followed by 5.56).
---
Also, the weapons that use it aren't really that good anyway (And the one that's somewhat decent of the two, the Hunting Rifle, can be converted to .50, which also makes it exponentially cooler due to the BOOM sound it makes, other than being more practical as well). 
---
Also, Super Mutants usually drop 5.56 and Assault Rifles for me (Expecially in West Tek, I have a ratio of like 10 ARs to 1 Hunting Rifle), it's weird that you get so much of it compared to other ammo types. 
---
I never played far cry... I thought it was a pvp or single player game or something... Are you saying it's got a pve focus and tough content? Cuz if that's the case I might need to try that out.... 
---
So you had some other tedious tryhard to the tedious tryhard work for you and use a borderline cheat program to tediously try even harder. Woohoo!
---
The success of nuking solo is related to how you are able to handle close combat situations... therefore your weapons dmg and your build will influence on how difficult it will be. I'm guessing melee builds will get through easier than ranged builds if your weapon dmg is medium... 
---
I've nuked solo as a melee build, somewhat around lvl 110 with a bloodied gronax axe with a base dmg of 4-500... used 20-25 stimpaks due to the fact I got a bit lost in the bunker and struggled with finding parts for the reparing and enemies continued to spawn... Now I know the layout of the bunker and location of needed items it will be smooth sailing for the next time...
---
And honestly you are just making things unreasonable. We arent the only ones of the pvp community who do the exact same thing. We could gather up pvpers and attempt to do "organized pvp" but with the size of clans and the usual occupancy of servers is the issue. Plus it removes the ability to ambush ppl because they would always be ready.
---
If you are unable to think from our point of view please dont bother me with your personal grievances toward how we spend our free time. There is a element of thrill of having unknown factors in fights. So fighting our own clan mates yields nothing. Specially caps or thrill. Our builds are all designed to work together
---
Not a definitive solution but if you store them all in your cash and retake them,the list will be in order when loadin one.
---
One day a patch will change it so that it does and it will be completely unannounced and we'll all lose our mutations by mistake xD
---
Bite me.
---
irony ON
---
Hey come on I mean its not like we dont have a gazillion online games that Bethesda could have learned from. Or by reading this sub btw.
---
irony OFF
---
Its really sad to see that Bethesda is just moving forward without first fixing the tremendous issues first. There are so many topics to address and from what I can see my good ideas that came from this community and none are picked up. Instead another trainwreck called "survival" is created. 
---
Thats because all the duped stuff in ppls stash and on their person. Like heavy gun users likely are filled with duped ammo since they cant drop it and several of those ammo types can weigh virtually if not 0 weight.
---
In fo4 survival required a new character. If you then changed difficulty to a lower level, you cant go back to survival.
---
Plant some blackberries as a suicide crop, in front of your corn and fence, most creatures will try and maul your blackberries before anything else. Works for me 😊
---
I played with it yesterday for about 5 hours. The only issue i found was when there is alot of smoke and also wheb there is alot of mobs, I can feel it slowing down.
---
No. The grind to 50 will be over in a day. You will not have even ground for long and then you'll be back here complaining about the next thing needing nerfed or buffed.  Keeping people out of the game that have played this whole time the right way is just punishing player for dupers. Dupers basically got all the gear and guns taken away is what you're doing. No lifers will not stop playing because theres a new mode and they know you want to be on even footing. You are gamers aren't you? how is this not a known thing that you're all crying for everyone to start over. 
---
Oh sweet a beta, I'm sure they'll act appropriately on the feedback provided. Oh wait wrong company... 
---
In order to prevent fraud, the weapons you name should be bound to you, i.e. be no longer tradable. Personally, I'd be okay with that. 
---
Bethesda would have needed to consult an expert for gamedesign in multiplayer games a year ago. I am afraid, that everything Bethesda could change or redesign now is simply too late or not costefficient for the remaining playerbase.
---
PVP is a mistake and the game will die. Anyone advocating for separate pvp servers doesn't really want to play Fallout. 
---
Haha what workshop?
---
#ItJustWorks
---
Happend to all of us already. I would love the choice to reconnect to the same server or to another one. Since you have to hop servers anyway sooner or later.
---
Definitely fresh start needs to happen. No transfers between modes also!

To be honest, I don't have stuff to trade and people often want to trade. I'm not sure what to do, I only have a few hours of game time so I just give plans and stuff away to low levels for free. And sell everything else. So yes I have no idea how to trade I've never done it.
---
Platform? I have a friend who dies a lot.
---
I list of available servers would be nice.  
---
Are you serious? It's easy as pie to have a toggle between invisible and visible. 
---
It's beta *feature*. It seems to be a recent thing. But then again agile development and iterations and bla bla bla
---
Plan for me dropped from my first Queen, still building up materials to craft it.
---
Who knew to clear radiation ye had to use highly irradiated materials? 
---
Yes - This would at least decrease the game mechanic called "server hopping". 
---
Confetti... oh confetti! I read spaghetti the first time 🤭
---
Those idiots don't see when i shoot, jump, light on fucking paper bag on floor. What do you expect from them?
---
Ya, that's the workshop perk.
---
Thats not how that works. This game was advertised as pvp friendly at the git go from the pvp portions of the gameplay trailers.
---
Instead what we got at launch was a Baby gated version which wasnt what we wanted. Remember the portion of the gameplay trailer where the player was fighting a guy in combat armor and then blows his arm off? We were hoping for open pvp which it looked like it had. We were goated into buying because of that just to find limitations. Its not our fault tbh we were mislead
---
To be fair it is pretty annoying to trade with some random who isn't making any attempt to SAY what they're trying to trade. It's like a retail employee walking up to someone IRL and shoving some shoes or whatever in their face and asking them if they want em. 
---
You don't understand how mods work, do you?
---
Maybe the water is really cold
---
Not just you. Confirmed it does that with all 4 legendary grognax I've found
---
This is shitty. Why do people feel the need to grief others who have paid money to enjoy a game?
---
Modding an online game that doesn't offer official mod support is considered cheating in every online game ever.
---
They already said we could transfer our adventure mode characters on social when they announced survival. Hence a lot of ppl not being pleased. 
---
Adventure = Mario
---
Survival = Super smash bros.
---
That sounds like a stupid personal opinion, not official policy from Bethesda. 
---
I once was a naysayer, downright upset when they announced it was going to be a fulltime mmo. Grudgingly I bought the game. Keep in mind my favorite Fallout to this day is New Vegas and FO4 was far from interesting but it was unique.  OFC I want a FO5 that had the immersion of New Vegas coupled with the sims like quality of FO4, but I digress. I want to thank you for your insight and this entire post will continue to be downvoted by the very people who claim to love Fallout. Right now there is a post with over 2.6k likes that wants separate pvp servers, new character requirements and a host of other things that will cause more damage than good. All the pro pvp players are aggressively downvoted on that thread. I want our voice heard because from my experience we are not the minority. Whether we are hardcore, casual, or bored pvpers; I have seen more of us then I have seen the 100 percent PvE only player. 
---
Well, maybe they didn’t want to sell/ take for free. I been their when ppl trying to buy something I don’t want to sell or give me free legendary when I already have a better version .-. Blame Bethesda gives us no ig text option
---
And after 76 months of waiting you get: probably more pvp "content"
---
Even then, you must reclaim it. Or steal it from your teammate, if you were in team, it goes on new leader.
---
Either way. I know melee rips apart standard homes of cement and metal with ease without it
---
Because pvp is part of the game you paid for to enjoy. You knew that entering into it.
---
yeh iv collected every single overseers mission holotape..and its still active quest..is this a bug?
---
I have to say I paused. Lets wait and see if new content will be really added. 
---
I'm a pacifist....so no PvP for me. Keep it separate please. As to more PvE content....YAY!!
---
I would quit. Having the 15 mutations you want isn't a quick thing 
---
Ah i missed that Statement. After Reading it, do they mean that only for the "Beta" State of the Survivale Mode for for the Full release too?.
---
I mean if they keep existing charakters, it would be the same like in WoW where you can Transfer your Charakter from PVE Servers to PVP Servers
---
Fusion cores deplete so slowly I would recommend just scavenging them rather than waiting around to farm them. I only keep 3 on me at all times. 
---
Rather than what players want, people are asking for what they personally want and then saying that's what everybody wants. How do developers know what players want? By seeing what they do in other games.
---
Just because other games have wank stories doesn't mean fallouts should get a pass.
---
I'd also counter that the boredom comes more from the gameplay systems and how they're designed. Plus with no real context or motivation to drive us, exploring the world feels shallow and less engaging.
---
Final point is people who are bored with the game will have likely moved on but fallout keeps its core players because its essentially the newest experience in a IP people are passionate about,  i stick with it because I want to be in the world they've created. It just happens everything they put in it is kinda shit... 
---
Yea, you shouldn't be able to swap willy nilly. All the dupers with their plethora of items will just move across and spread their wares there too. Should also make the TS/E or TSE affixes a much much rarer drop. This ensures everyone starts on a level playing field and there isn't a single super OP weapon.
---
Cool man. Keep on trying hard with cheatey Fallout 76 mods then! Is sure seems to make you a happy and fulfilled individual who is totally not ridiculously insecure!

Not really seeing this on PC.  Have had maybe 3 bad encounters, 2 camp destructions, but against several hundred neutral encounters and a few dozen good encounters I find the balance is considerably better than real life human behavior on the train.  At Whitesprings I stay out of the way and get up on the wall around the pool near the clubhouse entrance and get 1 shot into everything being pulled out of the clubhouse and stay clear of the higher lvls until the fight is over, then I loot the meat piles and have had no issues and even a thumbs up from a 200+ or 2 for not getting in the way of their shots
---
&gt; If you are unable to think from our point of view please dont bother me with your personal grievances
---
pot, meet kettle.
---
And we were supposed to be able to avoid PvP with pacifist mode. There is no reason to run around using TSEs on people who are in pacifist and minding their own business. This is why it's getting nerfed. Not because people are killing the queen to easy, but because everyone keeps griefing. 
---
This is what fallout needs. It will live on. If it was going to die it would of done it already
---
Scorched killer receiver works on them.
---
I have no idea whether it's for beta or not. I feel after people raising the issue that they'll probably scrap the idea all together. I hope they will. People will already out grind each other but day one lvl 200s is a bit silly!
---
I'm very confused, the new PvP mode is a Battle Royale mode? How did you get that from the post on their site?
---
I admit that the pvp is pointless atm.  All players i encountered don't even care to fight. I got maybe killed 3 times in Total and my camp never got destroyed. I dont feel like losing caps anyways What bethesda could have done was adding loads of pvp events on locations where u have to join a team and each team has an objective. If a team wins they earn caps.
---
 People that want to PVP are bored now and i dont think its fair for those that dont care for pvp to be  killed for no reason but boredom.  If you are rly bored in the game.. Go play another game then.. 
---
The longer time goes on the more I am starting to subscribe to the haters who said that this is a minimum effort asset flip / netcode test to bring in some quick funds.    
---
What is going on with the promised vault raids? where are the new events?  They have all the tools necessary to pump out new and interesting content/missions on a weekly basis. This game must only have 1 very junior dev supporting it.... 
---
     
---
Fallout 4 modders have been producing spectacular and engaging content in relatively tiny time frames - and they are amateurs working around their actual jobs/studies.  
---
No where in that official statement does it say mods aren’t allowed or considered cheating. You’re entitled to your opinion, but your opinions are dumb
---
yeh i have all 18 holotapes...and the quest is still active
---
What? I have mule only for legendary items i dont use right now. Throwing all junk i have over 150pcs away. Why would it make pvp pointless? lol
---
They need to Search stacks of legis, bobbles, serums etc and just ban. Ban them all. Just check the trading forums. It is a no brainer if someone has rediculus amounts of certain objects.
---
If Beth can not search for stacks of item X then maybe they should get it working asap before nerfing or creating new pvp content in a fucked system. Their explanation for nor giving higher stash limit gets a bit sad when a small group of players have more than the rest combined. Kind of like real life so maybe it is intentional by Beth 😂. Difference is that in real life most Rich guys has not their own 3D printer to copy anything at zero cost.
---
Love the potential of this game but Beth needs to get their priorities straight.
---
Yeah, I guess we going on 2 and a half months now. Which is still less than 4.
---
If they spoil the details and they are not exactly what they say you'll complain that they are not exactly as they said.
---
Pretty sure it’s also to do with people abusing bobble head glitches to make TSE do over 50k per shot
---
**A Problem with Character splitting:** I understand why people want the character separation, but man will this hurts players that have been farming rare non gameplay altering items.
---
The event rare cosmetics have a sub 1% chance of dropping, in some cases sub &lt;0.0% chance. The split will make people who've been working away at other aspects of the game feel like their efforts have been for nothing. 
---
Image: [https://i.imgur.com/AZT9HBs.png](https://i.imgur.com/AZT9HBs.png)
---
**Possible Solution:** I can think of a possible middle ground solution in this scenario, One possible solution would be to allow players to potentially craft non tradeable versions of cosmetic items they've found and make them function similarly to bought atom shop cosmetics, you can craft them on any character, but they're none tradeable.
---
(This would keep the survival economy clean, while allowing rare cosmetics farmers to feel like their efforts weren't totally for nothing)
---
ikr..i ended up dropping all my holotapes..just kept the nesecary ones
---
Now be super careful when you scrap weapons...
---
I love using 3. 1 is necessary and 3 is useful if you use other vats perks. Personally I use 4 leaf clover 3, crit savy 1. I just hold the crit button and trigger at the same time until it dies
---
Just more sloppy game design from Bethesda :/
---
The list gets bigger and bigger, I guess they will look at it Soon (tm)
---
Okay buddy. Go on being even more tedious and tryhardy than ever.
---
They stated clearly in one of their official CM comments here, that PVP-Survival mode is not the only new piece of content that's planned for march. We'll wait and see, it's only a month (and maybe a half) away.
---
I'm sorry but it is not the weapons themselves, it is the use of 100 explosive bobbleheads that stack. 
---
There is also a new perk card to reduce explosive damage. There is mods for armour to reduce explosive damage already. 
---
If you find yourself dying to these apparent "evil" weapons, learn how to play the game to survive. Again, everyone knew it was an online game with interactions so to expect everyone in the world to leave you alone is absurd. 
---
There is a block function for a reason. You can server hop aswell, simple as that.
---
Survival will be great but they need to nerf TSE first otherwise it will be a nightmare. 
---
This seems to be the best compromise imo. 
---
i used to love hearing about my exploits on the radio in fo4
---
Another bug 
---
Will be fixed Soon (tm)
---
Drops from Queen
---
Yes because at level 16 I can get armor and perk cards to save me from griefers.
---
3 extra unyielding pieces for my low hp, high rads, sneak build? Ability to wield 1 more bloodied super sledge? Yes please
---
People should get a mic. Not that hard. Solves a lot 
---
Massive emphasis on the IIRC , literally saw someone say it in a youtube video so it doesn’t have complete validity , however wether or not it was the shareholders idea not to release it doesn’t matter because there were some kind of a holiday event presents type ting in the fallout 76 files. 
---
I downvoted you immediately, read a few words further, and then changed my vote. Thank you for the well crafted lampoon of the mewling rabble of insufferable douchebags that infest this dump, brother.
---
Well that wasnt mentioned in original post was it so how could I know? Jump server, simple. Block player, simple. If they one hit kill when you are in pacifist and not contesting a workshop or in a pop environment then report to bethesda. Won't help/stop them by complaining on here.
---
I have faith this game will at some point get to where it needs to be. 
---
Every fallout game ever has been made better with mods. They seemingly have help drive the company to make fixes to obvious bugs and issues. For example, having "Known" shown up next to a known plan is a great game addition. We've had a mod that does that for the past couple weeks or so. 
---
But the fact that you don't seem to understand the game is intended to be played with you constantly switching out your perk cards for given situations shows you understand even less of the game. It's convenient, but you sure are holding back on your character's effectiveness.
---
I guess if that's how you like to play the game, knock yourself out. But to presume everyone that doesn't play the game exactly like you do is doing it wrong is just stupid. 
---
Jet lab*
---
Technically only 1 extra unyielding piece (4 arms, 2 legs, 6 total, instead of 2 arms, 2 legs, and a chest piece, 5total). 
---
Still, it would be fun and strong! 
---
I thought this game mode would have worked better if it was just an extended part of the current map - kind of like the Dark Zone from the Division. 
---
Not everyone can play with a mic. I play on a night time, so can't be chatting away as someone sleeps next to me.
---
Text chat would be awesome. 
---
Unpopular opinion: 
---
The fallout mechanics on fps are nowhere near the place they should be compared to other fps games. 
---
Having a pvp without a good fps mechanics, where you can actually measure skill, is not present in the current state and that makes pvp useless. I think they should remove the whole pvp aspect for now. 
---
It's a video game.
---
I think it was a comment response to a thread that was explaining how it supposedly worked.
---
I honestly think they rightfully nerfed TSE because "two-shot" is a broken affix. You need 12 in perception to get +60% rifle damage and a bit of armor-piercing. TS gives you +100% for free. That was broken and deserved a change. 
---
I have no problems with people getting the favor from the rng gods killing me in pvp. I just want an equal shot at the items, not duped items that I have purchased to make me godly. Legendaries are an intended part of the game, duping and such was not intended, or shouldn't have been. 
---
The trade interface is a bolted-on mess anyway. For exemple the mapping of L1-R1 instead of L2-R2 to switch tabs, compared to the pipboy, is significative of this rushed frankeinstein of a UI.
---
&gt; private servers would still be on Bethesda's servers 
---
Aka amazon's servers
---
There's also the dev room marine helmet
---
This post doesn’t have enough upvotes. 
---
Some people not having enough time to level another character is 100% irrelevant, games should reward players for playing more than others. Existing characters moving into survival would only hurt what they're trying to do with this mode. The griefing would be absolutely insane because the whole purpose of this mode would be to KILL MORE PEOPLE since a level 100+ will have done most missions and be able to Solo anything outside blast zones. 
---
However IF Survival also changed the game's overall difficulty (like enemies doing more damage and fusion cores being very rare) AND removes the "tag for PvP" THEN the mode becomes interesting. Because you'd have to consider stuff like:
---
"I could kill this rando for some caps, water and food but if he comes back Ill have to fight enemies that deal a good chunk of damage AND have to watch my back. So it might actually be more beneficial to send him a group invite and we can do this shit together plus have a better chance if we run into a group of players"
---
If everyone had to start at level 1 you'd run into people doing missions far more often than you'd run into people just waiting to ambush other players in popular areas. I also assume players won't be visible on the map since it'd make questing impossible. So it wouldn't take long for the community to pick a PVP Arena which would most likely be somewhere around Whitesprings. 
---
It's pretty easy to argue a PVE focus when the majority of the content is PVE.  The quests, the events, the exploration.  PVP can interrupt all of that, but that doesn't mean they're PVP activities.  The only dedicated PVP activities are a few events and a radio frequency.  Workshops haven't become the PVP hotspots they were intended to be.  Actual PVP content makes up a very small fraction of what the game offers.
---
PVP was kinda just slapped on top of it, with PVE and PVP players forced to coexist on the same servers to the detriment of both of their experiences.  At the very least, they should've seen this coming and had separate PVE and PVP servers from the start.  Win-win for both types of players.  Hopefully that's the route they'll take, with these "survival" servers being the first step.
---
Aaaah, well, the more you know. 
---
This is everything i think i want from this game!!!
---
&gt; Agree, I’m all pve and will never touch it. I imagine that is a large part of the Fallout player base as well. 
---
I'm all PVE too but I might take a peek, out of curiosity. I'm interested to see what kind of defensive behaviors are put in place by larger groups. Maybe it will feel like the Fallout world is actually a dangerous place where each encounter is tense. I have the movie "The Road" in mind while writing.
---
To be honest I say that from the point of view of the social experiment, I don't mean I'll enjoy playing while being threatened all the time. 
---
And bobblehead stacking. And shotguns should not do all pallets do a separate full dmg explosion.
---
I'm playing the game as it's designed, not using unsupported third party tools to change the game to be easier for me, but if you need such crutches to feel powerful enough in your video game fantasy, knock yourself out.
---
Its always been a pve game because there was no PvP, before 76 there has literally never been a PvP fallout and the only reason it hasnt been big in 76 is because the PvP system up to now has been shite.
---
Sorry I ment level 45my bad 
---
No offense, but I really disagree. As someone that predominantly PvPs and both hates and doesn't use TSEs, as well as someone who's been on the receiving end of countless TSE weapons, I can tell you that no, they don't really need anymore nerfing.
---
In fact, they've ALREADY been dealt a killing blow in terms of PvP with the inclusion of the change to Fireproof 3 mitigating explosive damage. Fireproof and Dense and even padded chest mods do well enough to reduce nearly all explosive damage.
---
The ability to massively render them ineffective ALREADY exists.
---
You don't want to deal with TSEs? Everyone is already capable of doing this. We already have the tools, and they don't take that much investment at all. Calling for another Nerf is simply asking Beth to do your own job for you. 
---
They have said that there is more then just Survival mode coming up. i assume this means some PvE content. wether or not it is end or mid game isnt known yet though
---
some people want it , don’t play it if you don’t want it 🗿
---
Yeah perhaps. Where your camp is located also affects mob spawns. My camp grows corn, and I haven’t been attacked once. My camp is fairly remote, but convenient, and I won’t share it’s location because I don’t like logging in and it not being there. But 2 spots ago, I had huge problems with mongrels ghouls and mole rats chewing up all my veggies. Every time I came back I had to repair my corn and I did have the same thought about what’s the point in growing it? But this new location is great for growing crops. 
---
This is about as childish as the people you're trying to make fun of.
---
Idk about auto revive gear but the game shouldve always been about partying up. The game should be damn near impossible do "complete" in its entirety solo. I get that it's a Fallout game but it's online for a reason ffs. 
---
Armor works slightly differently in that DR when hit in any part is determined by total DR rather than individual.
---
- I still 100% agree with you though, no reason my combat helmet should have 0 DR
---
It saves me the 30 seconds it takes to move all the perk points over. That part isn't difficult and doesn't make the game easier, it just saves time. How you choose to play the game is not the only way the game was meant to be played. There is not game play advantage to playing with mods other than just making it less *tedious*. But if you want to expend the effort in your *try-hard* ways, knock yourself out
---
your pace is slow
---
You should have read
---
Marie Kondo
---
Far Cry has always been single player pve focused. But recently it introduced coop.
---
Wouldn't mind to have some kind of queue so we could join and wait for more players to join a given event.
---
But that defeats the purpose of building where you want to. It's not hard to log in exactly where you logged off - it's a set of x,y,z coords and hundreds of other game developers can manage it. 
---
15 charisma, unyielding +1 charisma, herd mentality, alchohol with that booze perk, sexy mentats, that charisma card at level 2 that gives you 2 charisma for each team mate. All these together gets you 51  charisma

See, I don't have a problem with bobblehead stacking tbh. If you actually took the time to collect up a few bobbleheads (they're not ridiculously easy to get, I've tried hording a bunch of Leader Bobbleheads and haven't had too much success) then you totally deserve the hour of boosts you put time into acquiring.
---
The real issues are:
---
1) Obviously Dupers. Like I said, if you took the time to collect these things, you deserve to use them. If you get them illegimatately, that's another thing entirely and unlike the legit method of putting in time for a modest use, it's game breaking.
---
2) Some apparent BS where the timer for the Bobbleheads resets when you log out and back in.
---
That said, if there really is no way to clear up these Dupers, I'll sadly have to agree that bobblehead stacking does need to go. As much as I like the idea of a payoff for your efforts, other people went and spoiled the fun so it ought to be done for the greater good.
---
The fact that this discussion is being had only furthers the notion that this is an Early Access game being billed as a full release.
---
The biggest thing is the people that currently have duped items and have tons and tons of mutations, bobbleheads, magazines, etc waiting for a better pvp system. On top of that, there are several factors that have to be fixed prior to starting the survival mode. The number 1 is the duping has to be 100% stopped. After that, the stacked bobblehead thing has to be fixed. Also, imo the rifleman perk needs to just be 3 cards, not rifleman with 2 upgrades, expert rifleman with 2 upgrades, then master rifleman with 2 upgrades. That would free up 6 points to move around in special. I haven't even looked at the melee perks to see if there is something comparable as far as required 9 points. I would love to put 3 points in endurance and 3 into strength so that I can carry more than a few rounds and a couple of stimpacks and my armor when I go out. 
---
cool...story..bro..

Sad. In FO4 a vanilla maxed assault rifle was a DPS animal. 80 rounds and almost zero recoil made it a sniper's dream. The only down side was it was heavy and ugly.

Pick one, choose wisely:

**Keep all legendaries in PvP &amp; survival :** 
---
Let only a small part of the playerbase whom have good RNG dominate the leaderboard with overpowered weapons &amp; armors that make them impervious to bullets, nerf each update said legendaries until they become pointless, start balancing perks, core weapons &amp; armors, after months/year(s) achieve an enjoyable skill based and fair PvP.
---
**Remove all legendaries in PvP &amp; survival :** 
---
Start balancing perks, core weapons &amp; armors, after months achieve an enjoyable skill based and fair PvP.
---
Oh no, Gonna take my level 1million and hunt you dawn boyah

Even without duping you should use 1 bobblehead at a time not sall at once. It makes pvp unfair.
---
Don't know why so many people are cool with screwing over the player base that can't grind to level 200 and would be damaged by being forced to make new characters to play a game mode they might actually enjoy
---
They'll still have stacked bobbleheads or is that finally going away?
---
And there's still a ton of duped 3 star armor tailored for PVP.
---
Yea, well a few Suggested that the "Survival" Mode could be either like Diablo 3 Season where you have a "new" Game every few Months with f.e different "Themes" or it could be "more" Hardcore
---
Damage has been done to this game with all the hackers supers and cheaters right now the only thing they could do to fix it is wipe the servers and make everyone start again!
---
Division pvp player here - - teaming is super important and they need to fix social menu issues before this mode 
---
But they're not even all that abundant or reliable to get large amount of at a time and the effects aren't that unfair. 
---
Meanwhile you've got things like Psychobuff that can be crafted and are pretty easy to find that give you like 95 extra HP and a big damage buff.
---
Hell yeah, I can get more stimpacks or fury, etc. Replacing a non duped legendary that I got lucky af to find, I would probably quit the game at that point. Especially if I knew dupers were still duping their weapons on the pvp server. 
---
People don't trade, I stopped seeing traders after the rumour about stealing things out of the trade menu. No idea if that's actually true or not but I guess people don't want to risk it. Which combined with 200 caps a day NPC trader limits leads to a really dull and over encumbered game. 
---
I would love to share Deloris though. Can't you check the weapon attributes in the trade menu with x?
---
Are you going to fix the servers? Cause I'd be ok with just that at this point. I'm tired of the game crashing EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I. PLAY. EVER. 3. MINUTES.
---
Thank you 
---
Outside of removing duped weapons you and the person you're responding to are absolutely right.  If they required a new character for survival mode within a week there would be lvl 100+ people running around those servers and everything being said about the difficulties of starting from lvl 1 would still apply.
---
Herd's problem was that when not in group the penalty was a decimal and barbarian and evasive would both glitch out and not apply themselves. Egghead would be the same but only with barbarian. I managed to get rid of both so I can't test em out anymore to see if they are still glitching.
---
Doesn't matter how rare they are. Let's say you bought 100 small arms bobbleheads from a dupper. They give +20% weapon damage a piece. You consume them all and you get +2000% extra damage for 1 hour. How is that fair?
---
I disagree with what you’re saying about caps rewards. I don’t think it’s even a big change from what we have now. Survival is supposed to be difficult you know? Seems like an overreaction to me. I do agree however with the progress carrying over thing.
---
Sorry but these are literally all horrible ideas. 
---
It was stated that this was how it was going to work if you joined the beta
---
It is a soft survival, the new one would be no holds barred pvp. Basically survival of the fittest. It isn't just about the food and drink, but that at any moment someone potentially with hundreds of bobbleheads stacked will keeeel you. You would potentially be dead before you even knew you was attacked. A true sniper's wet dream of course. 
---
I'm not talking about duped bobbleheads. I already addressed that.
---
To be fair, why does the trade window start with full inventory instead of offer/request? It's super counter intuitive
---
Best thing to do is regularly store your junk in your stash and to block the player and switch servers. I dont want to sound harsh but at lvl16 your character isnt set up and by the time you reach level 60ish you should stand more of a chance (providing that you have the correct perks). Do some research, a quick google search should help on what to aim for. 
---
Speak for yourself..I’m looking forward to it.
---
That's a lot of words to say, "no u"
---
Not everyone is like you my man I’m actually excited this is the first thing they are announcing because PvP was non existent and this gives the people that have been missing out on the PvP experience to finally live it just wait your turn man I’m sure they have PvE things in store 
---
But the market is stained. They cannot repair that.  It is flooded with duped items. It doesn't matter if Bethesda banned all dupers, they already sold bobbleheads to legit players. So its kind of late to trust someone that kills you in 1 hit for how long it took him to aquire those bobbleheads.
---
Fallout 5....maybe if its a free DLC for 76 other than that they need to fix this one before trying to get more cash.
---
Please don't encourage them ;)
---
I regularly use chems. At vendors I sell them for some good good caps. 
---
Again, addressed that. Direct your attention to very last part of my first post.
---
The main game isn't even fixed yet and Bethesda want to introduce another game mode that no doubt will be untested just like 76 and introduce more bugs. 
---
PVP games only work when everyone is at the same level and everyone knows that isn't the case at all in 76. If the legendary weapons weren't enough and diference in levels and who has what perk cards, if they didn't think the cheating was bad now just wait until an actual PVP mode is introduced.
---
Bethesda need to clean up their game first and hire some people who know about PVP games. Bethesda have already shown their lack of skill and knowledge in this area.
---
Their time would be better placed fixing their game first rather than delivering what most people are thinking which is another lacking experience.
---
I'm a little confused, what splitting up of characters are you referring too?
---
Gladly.  Send me a message tonight
---
Alright, thx
---
Blackwater mine...or top of the world.. 
---
They certainly are a good source of caps as well. Aside from legendaries, my second favorite type of ghoul to run into at Whitesprings are those drug addled ones loaded with x2 of a bunch of chems.
---
The bobbleheads stacking should definitely be patched by the release of the survival beta, or it will be unplayable, as for armour a easily obtainable set of 1 star assassins armour with dense mod would quickly close the gap vs people with sentinel or cavalier sets I honestly feel starting over would be a massive slap in the face for a lot of end game players who have only been grinding to be pvp ready 
---
Blackwater mine
---
Welch is a great place to farm them and it's close to a train station
---
Why do rare cosmetic farmers feel their efforts were worthless?
---
There will always be players at a disadvantage, that's no reason to make people throw away their hard earned characters just to participate in the new mode. Allowing survival-only characters is going to be more of a headache programming-wise than I think this team wants to deal with. As it stands now, progress you make today will effect you in the new mode- so there's a reason to play and not just log out until March. I'll say, I do like the idea of fresh starting, but it's a pretty cheap game-extender, and people like me who can afford to spend 18 hours per day playing, knowing many secrets already, and still being able to buy whatever weapons you're crying about if we can't just find them in-game, doesn't justify the extra work and alienation of what you're proposing. You've got three months to prepare for this, hop to it.
---
It wouldnt be unfair without dupers, you have equal opportunity to get them yourself and stack defensive ones? 
---
The Red Rocket station near Hornwright and Blackwater Mine among others....
---
ah, okay, thanks!
---
Yes those are the best.  Give me all your bufftats mmm. 
---
Honestly though it’s not a aspect of the game I have explored. Never had to rely on chems so why bother. 
---
You will only need 5 legendary lion statues to craft it.
---
In regards to these posts. [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajftuz/do\_not\_allow\_current\_characters\_into\_survival/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajftuz/do_not_allow_current_characters_into_survival/)
---
Why stack? Why not just 1? I don't get the infinite damage balance.
---
From what I have seen most of these report can be pinned down to people who have a workshop claimed or a teammate without pacifist on.
---
I think people are making the mistake to think that the new PVP mode is going to be some sort of battle royale wanna be. But I think we gotta remember that it’s still gonna be just 25 players per server. Other than a bit more potential for griefers, it’s still going to be mostly the same game. Running into other players will still be somewhat uncommon. I agree it’s kinda half baked as a whole, like the rest of this game, but I think some people are jumping to hysterical conclusions.
---
Blacwater mine near whitesprings also there is an event there called uranium fever where you can get some 3* legendarys
---
Something that probably got over looked because of how rare they were intended to be, theres only a few per world and everyone has the same spawns. But its obviously been abused, and i agree they would implement a way to stop the stacking, but the biggest issue is the duping and the server hopping that resets the timer. If they reduced the time and lets say you lost it upon leaving the server it wouldnt be as useful. 
---
You can't craft legendaries
---
Developing actual content = expensive and time consuming.
---
Changing PvP restrictions = cheap and quick.
---
I'll try Blackwater Mine.  Tried to get near Top of The World last weekend and died miserably.
---
I was able to get 3 core 2 from farming and 1 from a chassis in Poseidon. Planning to go around finding chassis and farm some more so thanks for the tips!👍
---
I don't mind pvp, when I want to pvp. I did not buy this game because it was pvp, I bought it to play fallout with a chance to do multiplayer for harder quests (still trying to find one). However, when I do not want to pvp, I do not want to take slap damage from some ass hat that thinks its funny for me to have to use food or chem to heal up from his/her damage that I didn't want to deal with. If the option to go passive meant that I would not take, nor cause damage to others, except maybe explosive aoe type damage that was accidental. Maybe even make it so that only grenades can cause aoe to passive players. Then if I feel like going 'hardcore' I can choose to do so. This should then cause me to disappear from the map, and would allow my camp to be attacked and destroyed. Since that seems to be too much for you ass hats that only want to pvp, go get your own server and kill each other to your hearts own desire. Oh, but if you leave then you start over, or at very least you should make the move with nothing but your reclamation day suit on. 
---
So my two main characters knew uses vats overlay and doesn't crash much.  One uses targeting HUD.... and all the time it crashes.  Ps4. 
---
It feels like Bethesda has been taken over by a bunch of synths lol. On the subject of PVP, I would have loved to see a map extension catered to what they've described. Keep players who want to PVP in a secured area on the map where they can just shoot each other relentlessly until they get bored.
---
I may try the Red Rocket, I've seen it marked on my compass but haven't discovered it yet.  I can get between there and Welch pretty easily.
---
Yeah and even if they are rare i think you can still serverhop to get them. Haven't tested.
---
I like to walk around without pa. As such I have done chems favorited for certain situations. In PA I never use boosting chems.
---
That is really interesting. My main char (a 24/7 power armor heavy weapons guy) crashes alot. I startet a new char (a non PA rifle user) and in 20 levels i can count the crashes on one hand. All crashes where near harpers ferry (camped there for the handmade plans. lol) and watoga. These places are commonly filled with players. Gotta look out if they are PA users when my game crashes. 
---
You're right.
---
Or X key on pc
---
I'd say they just lessen how fast the fuel burns actually. Like one per second? I've tried the flamers out and that already sounds like a 4x improvement over the madness we currently have.
---
At the very least, let us sort them in the pip boy then put that sortment into the terminal. 
---
This. You'll have the black titanium and awesome chanse at getting some legendaries suitable for your level. Just dont expect the other guys to let you tag the bosses, so be vigilant and land a hit before the douche with an explosive shotgun.
---
Yeah, its a guarenteed spawn point for them, also PA spawn and cap stash...
---
Especially if you are getting attacked by someone wanting to engage in pvp. 
---
It might sound silly, but please do NOT repeat the error of the first beta.
---
A beta with players instead of real beta testers NEEDS to be wiped when it ends. The people doing the beta must do it by curiosity OR by will to get a better product, NOT to have a head start on everyone else.
---
Take longer if needed, but your community wants a good product, not a rushed one. Please.
---
Yeah I hat when people kill the enemy’s before I can tag them
---
I use psycho in "oh shit" scenarios which is regularly. I don't usually go around pvping but I do consider some dumbass trying to kill me an "oh shit" scenario. My level is pretty high so it's pretty rare to run into someone who wants to pick a fight. 
---
It never amazes me how often fans of this game beg to get kicked in the teeth. The point of this new mode is to provide something different to do, not make you start from zero again. I see your point and I think it could work, but that's not what they're going for. You realize that after a few moths, these people you complain about are going to be just as powerful as they are now, and then what? You're going to beg for another reset "so you can compete?" Every time there is a popular suggestion on this sub, we get a Faustian deal, just let them do their thing and focus on playing the game they've made.
---
I agree with this. A slower burn rate would be easier to implement, and serve the purpose of balancing the crafting materials. Good idea!
---
You say worthless, but it would still provide a big outlet for all the people that are getting bored with endgame and just wanna fight each other, and all the people who dislike the current PvP engagement system involving slap damage.  Which would be a great relief valve for the main game, in which a lot of people don't want to engage in PvP at all and wish those PvPers had somewhere else to go.
---
Sounds like you just have bad luck with running into assholes.  Most people don't have any trouble. I have never once had someone randomly come kill me 
---
I took a week off after burning myself out after the holidays, now i jump on for two hours max a day. Launch a nuke, run some events, etc and honestly I enjoy it way more. The game feels much more geared to the casual experience in it's current state
---
i'd settle for everything we've built there gets stored in that workshop after a logoff or disconnect. After logging in and claiming the workshop we are given the option to redeploy everything to where we had it.
---
Yeah, but what if I picked up 75 holotapes from when I started the mission to when I decided to go back to it. Oh and I already had like 35 holotapes before I got the one for the mission I am on. 
---
Yeah cowards can't 1v1. But with the nerf coming on explosive weapons many of the trolls are going to quit the game. The rest will flock to pvp servers until they keep getting stomped by people like me then they will rage quit cause they aren't good at the game and good riddance to them is all I can say. Trashy players need to stick to Fortnite if all they care about is pvp.
---
I don't want to go to my stash every time I decide I might need a holotape. 
---
It's Battle Royale without winners.
---
I can give you enough black titanium to make your power armor if that helps... Then you can access these places a little easier also 
---
If I still have to deal with this when I get back on in a few weeks, you'll deal with me. No reason to spend all my time getting my stuff ganked when I can profit from ganking others, so screw it.
---
exactly where is this spring? I read about it, but could not find it. 
---
I mean, that is not the worst mechanic in the world.  If they up around the Good damage duration a bit it would be a solid variation I think.
---
&gt;a bandwagon jump by Suits to try (in vain) to get in on the Fortnite/PUBG crowd.
---
If only survival mode WAS battle royale, that would be a new experience and maybe worth a try: you start with 32 players on a server, no respawns, and your reward for being the last char standing is that you have the server to yourself until you log out, with level-scaled enemies and legendaries everywhere.
---
That would make even me (a PvE zealot) consider survival mode. In short: you go through an intense phase of PvP to make your game fully PvE. And as nobody likes to wait in a lobby for twenty minutes before a server is filled, the devs could do a 'hot' phase during which players can freely join and prepare (and also leave or respawn), which is followed by the 'showdown' phase (no respawns, upon death you will leave the server, and you lose something precious from your inventory which will be lootable from your dead body in game) and then by the 'last man in Appalachia' phase with optimum server performance (no other players slowing it down, server only has to provide your own surroundings and could even manage unlimited carry weight...).
---
Of course, all of this would be moot and provoke lots of anger if you still get random DCs (or a client crash) after you put in all that work.
---
Miss calling my shotgun “Kurt cobain’s microphone”.
---
I'll definitely give this a go.  Hopefully I can get something good out of it, can't pass up the chance for some legendaries.
---
What did fallout people want than? It was a open world multiplayer game with building feature. 
---
I just want Baby Shark. 
---
Interesting testing... doing anything different while in power armour? Eg nuke zones while you wouldn't enter nuke zones not in power armor? Or did you still do nukes in hazmat suits while not using power armor for that time?
---
I try over 10x times and I finally get same server, but i have to reclaim my site :P
---
I just want BABY SHARK. 
---
What do you mean your efforts have been for nothing? You can still play adventure mode with all your cosmetics as always. Your adventure progress wont get deleted. 
---
Its important for survival to have a fresh start. What you do with it is your choice. But adventure mode wont disappear. Possibly most players will stay there.
---
I mean, sure, it would be fun if I could use my favourite rare cosmetics in survival. But I see that it is important to not allow that. A fresh start will be more fun for everyone.
---
If they allow character transfers, I will most definitely not be playing survival mode which really disappoints me as I'd like the full survival experience.  I feel the amount of high level griefers I'd encounter right out of the vault would make the mode unplayable and a waste of my time. 
---
Even though 80% of the players I encounter have been amazingly nice and generous. I thank all who play nice and give me laughs every time I log in. Yall make this game fun
---
How do melee builds kill scorch beasts solo? I can almost never get them to land anymore to throw my baseballs and nuka grenades at them. 
---
That is, unfortunately, not an argument but a feeling. 
---
You not wanting to start the levelling over has nothing to do with the balance of the game. The game cannot be balanced in any way if we take the currently unbalanced version.
---
As balance is the key in PVP games, it's unfortunately either "new fresh character", or a game that will be killed a few weeks after its launch because no one will want to play it.
---
I used chems at a lower level in bad situations. Now just at the sbq to boost damage output. 
---
In the gazebo
---
Yeah. I figured that out. :-)
---
Listen for the voiced message about "detecting (something) managment personell. Please eliminate etc". This means the legendary enemy has spawned and you need to spot him. Land a hit. Then be a gentleman and make the "come here" emote for the other players. If more peolpe do this the others will eventualle learn. Possibly. Probably not, but do it in any case. 
---
That would be to easy. 
---
Just played. Some whitesprings without power armor in hazmat suits. Didnt crash. Walked into 1 with power arnor crashed instantly. Was farming mostly and doing events for plans.
---
The crashes are random. My friends crashed when i didnt and vice versa. No rhyme ir reason as dar as i can see. 
---
Power armor = cant play game
---
No power armor means we can play
---
Sucks. 
---
Ohhh okay thank you!
---
I also agree that splitting characters up permanently is really dumb. Beth just wants to add a heavier PvP server set and everyone seems to think it should be way more hardcore and not allow you to flip back to normal mode for getting gear and supplies, or even just hang out with your non-Survival playing friends. Whereas I think Beth wants a place for people to go when and if they wanna PvP, for however long they want, not necessarily a gametype that you have to get 100% into to be able to play it (which is what would happen with start-from-scratch-only characters).
---
I also think a lot of the people that are worried about balance between survival characters (the ones afraid of everyone bringing their lvl 200 with TSEs over and being OP) aren't thinking about the fact that the exact same balance issues will creep into Survival naturally after like a month anyways 🤣
---
I could do with non fighting companions that we can have running around with us. They can't carry anything or do anything but look cute though. 
---
I agree with you. 
---
I don't think there's a way to make PvP "fair" in online games. Someone will always find thinhs to exploit. 
---
&gt; I’m quite tired of having to constantly have weight reduction perk cards taking up special points just to be able to manage my carry weight
---
&gt; 
---
&gt;     Agreed, a high level perk card that lets you fast travel while encumbered for an increased cost would be a life saver.
---
THIS. I hate being the  stealth sniper with 11 strength, every pocket known to man, etc, etc, etc... just so I can carry two or three obscenely heavy rifles, bullets, and crafting mats to repair/craft same. It's a stealth sniper that wanders around with 
---
240 lbs of crap on a good day.
---
I logged out a few days ago after a SB queen kill and monster harvest fest with over 400lbs of inventory - in the middle of a field. I just didn't want to deal with the slow sneak back followed by the anguish of "that's kinda/sorta nice - one of my friends will want it" or "damn, I've got another metric tonne of X stable flux when I need two units of Y stable flux. Should I ditch X? Last time ditched excess stable flux, I had a tonne of Y, and look where that got me.
---
Personally, I just want multiple large-ish separate inventory storage devices. Something for weapons, something for armor, something for food, something for crafting mats, and something for something I haven't thought of yet. 
---
Nelson: "Haha".
---
I've never run into griefers on ps4. But I guess it's mostly due to the fact that I've always been among the highest levels in any server. 
---
The only bad experience I've had is some really some really high level player just walking into my house and stealing a bunch of crap a friend of mine was dropping me to craft him some power armor. In hindsight I should've locked or removed the door while we did the trade. 
---
All I want is BABY SHARK. 
---
You're right. However this is not a solution to prevent people from getting fucked because they're new, it's to make the PVP option even remotely viable.
---
If this isn't made, the only people in PVP will be dupers with online-bought stuff. Not a single legit player will try to get his ass raped, his caps stolen and his stimpaks lost all day long by unkillable monsters.
---
As per the solution, the article says it plans to "level cap" the damages so that level difference shouldnt' matter much. I understand that it doesn't help with the stuff equipped, but at least if people have to find their TSE, instead of just buying it, you should be free of perma-griefers harassing you.
---
There's one suggestion to trump them all.
---
More server stability, that way we don't get kicked off before an hour has past since claiming.
---
After claiming the same workshop 3 times tonight I was disconnected. Very disheartening.
---
They need to get rid of cheating, duping, TSE's and anything other OP item in the game. They then need to make sure all new characters have access to all perk cards to ensure people have the same chances - RNG on perk cards ensures 10% of the population are OP as they get the best cards, 10% have the worst cards and 80% are in the middle. This goes for armour and weapons as well - hands up who wants to go up against players with the best gear when you're a hobo with a mix-match of everything?
---
And anyone thinking that duping won't be a thing? Your mate just found a really good item and won't dupe it for you? It doesn't matter if everyone starts at level 1 because in a week's time the field won't be level at all.
---
Unless the mass of bugs get fixed first, there's no point to playing PVP. 
---
Unless there's a level playing field, there's no point playing PVP.
---
An example would be playing BF1 and you have a musket and you go up against the guy with the power armour and the minigun. Nobody wants to play that,
---
It'll still be dead, because high level characters can create alt characters and load them with good stuff. 
---
Sorry, lost me about halfway through. Not bc it was too long, but when you start jumbling stats together that don't make sense (Looking at your Rewards section and weapon damage section. I get the gist, but you went too in the weeds and like a long run-on sentence). Also, to suggest removal of items bc *that's not the way I play it* really hinders your valid points.
---
Beating something to death with a protest sign or scaring other people with a chainsaw is just fun roleplaying.
---
Sorry to not keep reading, but also not sorry. Started out strong and I commend you for that, but your message devolved into incoherence and pigeonholing.
---
It's a common reaction lol the break will do me good 
---
Ikr. Every time I see a fishing pole, I want to go fishing. Especially now that the water is all frozen and I can't fish for a couple of months. 
---
But you wouldnt be able to make arms... so it would be normal human arms.. youd look like a T Rex
---
My base duplicated its blueprint like 6 times this morning. I closed my base cause some trolls were trying to smash everything and when I went to reset it I had 6 blueprints of my base. If bethesda bans me for it well I will be demanding a refund for their broken ass game. I saw a post yesterday saying the monster mask from the monster mash event is also flagged to ban players cause it came from the dev room and I have one cause a player killed me in monster mash when I picked up the mask. So yeah let them ban me. I have made videos about these bugs that I am hanging on to just for that occasion.
---
I’m not saying totally it will alleviate that lack of end game content there still needs to be more pve bosses etc. But it will give high level players something more to do especially the leaderboards. The reason multiplayer games have a much longer lifespan is because interacting with other players infinitely generates more content and the more emotionally stimulating the multiplayer the better. Competition is extremely simulating and is one way or expanding the lifespan of the game, if you are constantly trying to keep on top of a leaderboard that is an ongoing goal, right now players have been creating their own goals. Or aimlessly playing.
---
I completely disagree with pvp being unplayable like so many people say it is. For one most of these people dont even play it, they just got one shot by someone 100 levels above them at a workshop then complain about it. For some reason shocked that that happened...
---
I will concede it needs some balancing but far from unplayable, there are counters to the most infamous TSE weapons simply put on the new flame perk and a dense mod that does a lot for you and you can survive multiple shots from some tse, but no one wants to do a little research theyd rather cry to bethesda... saying they get one shot all the time. As far as I can tell there is counters to most ways to approach pvp. People are just lazy. And I say that as someone who’s done a fair amount of it.
---
Agreed. Voice and text chat for all. And a ”no mic” emote would be great
---
The no clip documentary was the first mention of the "Slap Damage." This was way before we knew Fallout 76 was even a thing so I don't think they held back PvP because of our reactions
---
Lol yes I feel ya
---
Purified water would be wasted on anything else as it would still have to cause radiation damage when eating or drinking anything. However if made with purified water instead of boiled water, maybe make the amount of radiation poisoning go down by a half. 
---
If it isn't sorted soon ill  be after a refund. So anoying 
---
If you decide to come back, stop whining on reddit. Otherwise, just stay gone.
---
Gorge Junkyard in the Forest has a black titanium extractor. Just make sure u have acid to smelt the ore down to usable scraps. 
---
Weird. As a junk hoarder, I'll usually run power armor, and I'm on PS4. Maybe, at most, one crash a play session.
---
The one beyond the tennis qourt? Where the honey beast / deathclaws etc spawn? I must be fucking blind because thats the only gazebo I could find and I still could not find any sulphu water to cure the endless radworms.
---
Lol, delete Reddit if you don't wanna hear bitching.
---
I always keep them on hand for when I'm overweight and need to fast travel. Stack with some alcohol and fly awayyy
---
I get a lot of blue screens random crashing and crazy long load times. I'm gonna try movong the game off my external HD and see if that helps I've tried everything else
---
Since vault 76 was a control vault instead of experimental might have something to do with it. Vault 101 was also a control vault but the outside did not look quite as nice so the theory is iffy.  However, it seems like it would become a huge bullseye for raiders or anyone outside having a long ass walkway to the dramatic entrance. It's way extra than what it needs to be or should in my opinion.
---
The pie is a lie. No, seriously, I've already gotten it three times in my 300 hours with the game. My rule is: the machine gets exactly one click from me. No pie? No big deal.
---
I also got a few of them in Fallout 4, but it's a shame they don't provide anything special, or aren't worth 200 vendor caps, no questions asked.
---
Yup it's a regular drinking fountain 
---
Okay. Thanks mate. I'll have another look.
---
So you're telling me a group of thirty guys thirsty for PvP has nothing better to do than grief lowbies? Did you ever consider that with a group that large you can PvP each other? 
---
I understand your point.
---
However, you must understand that even without the cheaters, there's no point trying to PvP if we start level 1 vs people level 400. 
---
Also, I do believe Bethesda will fix duping in a distant future, but I do not believe they will have done it by march, nor that they will have removed all duped items, nor that they will have corrected the level of the players who cheated on XP (there were a lot of infinite-xp glitch)
---
So if YOU want a good pvp, fair fight and deserved victories, my opinion is that you'd have a better time on a fresh start version of it. I understand finding AGAIN the good stuff you have is boring, but everyone would have to...
---
So my question is, what about all the people who had the base duplication bug after the second patch? I know in the patch that fixed it, Bethesda referred to it in the patch notes as an "exploit", yet it was due to a bug Bethesda introduced in the previous patch. Are they going to ban all those people as well?
---
The only one of those that sounds like an unfair advantage to me is the lockpick one since it negates a game function. The others just sound like QoL items and the map one seems like nothing you wouldn't get from a quick internet search anyways.
---
Then again I am not a BGS mod so my opinion doesn't matter lol.
---
&gt;  but I'm really sick and tired of fanboys saying it's all me and everything is fine and Bethesda can do no wrong and whatever else they say to blame me for my bugs.
---
See, here's your problem. 
---
No one is saying anything close to that. You have problems that have nothing to do with your game crashing and you lying about how much.
---
I'd say go take care of those first. Later.
---
Theres that
---
I would be happy is the .50 cal rifle would just do more damage than the hardened .308. 
---
Bethesda should just straight up remove TSE from the game. Easiest solution. A broken weapon type.
---
Craft it? Now that would be something, someone finding the mega-rare *Plan: Two Shot Explosive Handmade* in game after all this time!
---
There won't be slap damage in PvP servers, so there's that I guess ? I saw a video of someone one shotting the SBQ, how do you plan to have more life/res than the last boss of the game ? ._.
---
now we realy need shields!
---
It's not fair and I only hope they thought I was trying to dupe and will see my Base duped. Two different things but can I prove it 
---
I just want to be able to move within the first 45 seconds of phasing into the server. Anymore it seems like it takes longer and longer for everything to populate so I can move. 
---
Well don’t talk for the majority of people then, I’m pretty excited to play this new mode with my friends. The tension between squads is going to be real!
---
It's clear this is a studio with no experience making multiplayer games, whose suits forced them to do so anyway. And now they're reinventing the wheel as opposed to learning from existing titles, probably do to time constraints from those same suits.
---
As long as I can one shot the vehicle with my tse sniper rifle killing all of the occupants as the vehicle explodes into Great Balls of Fire. 
---
&gt; wreaking havoc on everyone. 
---
Isn't that the point of this mode? You can still play adventure mode if you're not comfortable competing with people who play on survival, you have options. Instead, you're asking to take away the options of people who have put in hundreds of hours building their character legit by making them start over because of "dupers and exploiters." 
---
What do you think it's going to be like on day one when everyone is forced to start this new mode crammed together into the forest and it's early quests? It's going to be a nightmare not based on skill, not based on gear, it's going to be based on luck just like Fortnite or PUBG, and it's probably not going to be fun for anyone. I don't think that's what Bethesda is going for here. This is supposed to be something new you can hop in or out of at leisure, not forcing you to abandon your old characters and live like a fearful prey animal for the rest of the game, because that's what this mode is going to feel like most of the time. Don't believe me, just go rack up a thousand cap bounty and see how fun it is knowing someone could snipe you from any direction at any moment, it's stressful, more stressful than I think the majority of players in this game want. Only the truly elite will be playing this mode at all times.
---
I also have a lot of hours in.  There is a lot of fun to be had but it does seem that things are a little half-baked and design decisions seem to be... unfocused.
---
I would be happy with a bicycle. 
---
If one buys a TSE for 250 caps, it's duped.
---
If you bought a mazeratti for 250$, it's stolen. No question.
---
There is zero tutorial for the game, so it's likely people dont know how to trade....
---
I don't think it's going to affect the drop rates for rares, and I'm not afraid that I'll drop apparel on death, although they haven't stated what other items are going to drop, it seems reasonable to assume armour type items wouldn't be on that list.
---
It just seems a shame that there's items which are clearly non gameplay altering, that can take hundreds of hours for one of them to drop via targeted farming to then be locked behind the original version of the game. I personally wouldn't of bothered going out of my way collecting (currently around 98 to 99%) of the games unique items if I knew that 2 months after release half the player base + may transfer to a different mode of the game. 
---
Maybe the reasoning I used isn't the most fair and I'll definitely edit it too be less dramatic, but it seems reasonable to allow players who have spent a **TON** of time acquiring these type of items to still have some use in them when the player base shifts. I can definitely be labeled with a bit of greed here, because I personally just don't want to spend another 200 hours to start my uncompleted collection of cosmetics all over again on a gamemode I would of been more interested to play if it were available from the start. 
---
(They're cosmetic items after all, I personally don't see any problem with the solution I posted in the original post) - Open to discussion on it and maybe there's a better one available -
---
Maybe you should have posted all this in that particular thread so this would make more sense in context.  Cause i think most of us are a bit confused where your issue makes the farming efforts "for nothing"
---
In march. according to this comment:
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajftuz/do\_not\_allow\_current\_characters\_into\_survival/eevqt3i/?context=1000](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajftuz/do_not_allow_current_characters_into_survival/eevqt3i/?context=1000)
---
Exactly my point
---
Only the vehicle version, not the lion version. 
---
Multi shot without extra ammo was added to warframe and it destroyed game balance. It was a huge mistake that snowballed into gross power creep.
---
We dont want that.
---
I'm pretty sure their lawyers are Kyle.
---
Oh yes, it will
---
Theres a reason you have to look beyond FO76 to find those people. This isnt going to change that.
---
So, hear me out on this, but I think they should let you take an existing character into survival. Whether it's level 2 or 200.
---
#(BUT!!! )
---
And this is a J.Lo sized but, IT SHOULD LOCK THE CHARACTER THERE. People that only want to do pvp can take over their hard work and effort, a lot of thought will have to be put into moving your character, and it would potentially free up the pve world from hideous griefers. Sure, they could always make a new character and grieve the Adventure/pve worlds, but they'll have to start from the ground up, and it'll keep them from coming back. Maybe even make it limited time to carry an existing character over. 
---
On top of that, I keep seeing complaints about tse weapons destroying the competition. They're about to nerf those, and with the way the ITV posts read, it's before or at the same time as survival, and they've already buffed fireproof to help cover existing tse problems, only AAE will be super effective/worrisome.
---
I am honestly all for this if it will keep the griefiest griefers away. 
---
B.E.T.A. players probably the majority of that.  Those achievements didn't trip.
---
Nope, says Gatling plasma
---
Ahhhh, I should have known that
---
Name ITEMS, not just weapons.
---
Currently, the game is rigged. I don't mind people playing more than me and getting better. I mind people spending more money and buying better gear online. 
---
I don't care much, because I play "solo" or in small teams with friends. I would care if I had to face those other players. Because whatever my skills at the game are, a player that buys a TSE, 500 explosive bobbleheads and a X-01 armor will have an advantage, especially if he has it as soon as he's level 50. Not only because it will bring a PVP advantage, but because the PVE advantage it will bring that player will allow him to bring further disbalance.
---
If you play 200hours, find a TSE and kill low level players, that's the game. You're sort of an asshole and a coward for getting on smaller preys, but that's your right.
---
If you buy stuff outside the game, it's cheating.
---
I feel like this may explain my thought process slightly better.
---
&gt;I don't think it's going to affect the drop rates for rares, and I'm not afraid that I'll drop apparel on death, although they haven't stated what other items are going to drop, it seems reasonable to assume armour type items wouldn't be on that list.

Maybe I'm alone on it, but I'm happy to discuss it further.
---
Capturing the glitch is about all you can do to prove it wasn’t intentional. 
---
I’ve had a couple tickets with them, and they seem to want to see video/screenshots. Had one where I submitted the video through their website and they requested it through email. I guess the ticket system is bugged too. 
---
How dare you speak such blasphemous things. 
---
Not a game developer, but I developed other software for years, no thank you, I did that, got the carpal tunnel syndrome and couldn't burn it away. 
---
Permadeath and it bricks your consol and also it shocks your balls and tells you you were adopted.
---
And no fast-travel. I know it sounds harsh, but MAN that would make a game.
---
I think this is that thread now. 
---
Strange coincidence, we have a hybrid-routing solution as well. 4g LTE unlimited and in addition the 1,6mb/s which come outta the cupper line.Had never problems with that, rather the opposite. 
---
Anyways, I've seen it for under 10$, will buy it for me and a friend and then look how it suits me
---
Or just wander around the ash heap. They’re all over the place down there. 
---
Lolz, popo? 
---
There’s welcome mat plans available. I didn’t buy them, assumed they’re like FO4 
---
Neither was the case here.
---
Yeah, I think I'm finished with FO76. And its absolutely my last Bethesda game. Fuck this.
---
Luckily I've got the video on you tube showing the  size of the Base and a random players reaction to it. Suppose I just have to wait it out and keep my fingers crossed 
---
I’m on PC, and I txt a lot for work IRL. no interest ingame txting
---
They dont care. They've got stars in their eyes thinking of chasing the Fortnite crowd and are too stupid to recognize it for the pipe dream it is.
---
The mine is good. So is welch 
---
Yeah. It’s hard to start back up after even two days of not playing because you get so lost on what you were originally doing which is one thing I don’t like. Also it always seems to be night time and it is the darkest night times I have ever seen. It’s like moon doesn’t exist after the war. They blew that up too
---
Two more data points to Rng:

* [3\* Hunter's Lever Action Rifle](https://imgur.com/jSejc1i) with Explosive &amp; 15% faster critical @ 502 hours, from the Mire north of Thunder Mountain on the highway, lvl 68 Scorched

* [3\* Ghoul Slayer's Pump Action Shotgun](https://imgur.com/DR4YBIj) with Explosive &amp; 15 faster critical @ 509 hours, from Huntersville north gate, lvl 68 Super Mutant.
---
Hell yeah, I want a clan 75 ton mech capable of running up to 86.4 km/hr and the ability to jump up to 150 meters. For the armament, I want 4 medium pulse lasers in each arm with a single extended range small laser in the head but facing to the rear. Also, I want hand actuators so that I can just grab a tree and use it as a club until it breaks. I will name said mech Vanir Prime. There are other possible mods, but I just haven't found the plans yet. 
---
Ive farmed hours and days for some cosmetics, too. But to me its not an issue if I cant use them in a new game mode. They dont disappear. And tgey arent that important to begin with. 
---
Id possibly use different clothes anyway.
---
most ppl forget because it does not say it requires both.
---
The Vault 76 Massacre. Hundreds of bodies, everywhere. Launch day of the PvP mode.
---
Can you telephone Bethesda or is it ticket only?
---
One of the things i like about Fallout 76 is the fact that it's PvP only when you agree to it by shooting back. Just also started hitting a bit of Red Dead online, and was looking forward to it. First time spawning in Free Roam-Im standing there like the novice i am,getting the feel of the controls, 30 seconds in, I'm shot in the head. Respawn, and get shot immediately again. Respawn, and this time get lasso'd and hogtied,tried getting free and shot in the head just as i was. Give game up that night. 
---
Second time-manage to spawn successfully, and get on a horse hunted 2 rabbits, went to town for supplies. Pass one dude without my gun out,obviously not causing grief. He decided to run after and shoot me. Respawn, get to town, go to store, shot as i get to door. Respawn, get supplies, wandering into saloon for a look. Tackled randomly from behind and stabbed/strangled killed. Quit fukn game, put back on shelf, grab the 76 again. Sorry if long, needed to vent and really put my case. 
---
That is just too much to ask. 
---
I'm mostly peaceful IV tried PvP a few times only with consent may I add no griefing from me, but I am going to be starting a new character and giving it a try so their should still be peaceful players.
---
Hopefully you're willing to let me off on the dramatized phrasing I've used. 
---
The overall message I'm hoping to convey is that I'd prefer that the rare cosmetics which are non gameplay altering, which took some serious time and effort to collect them, to still carry some meaning to them. 
---
For me personally who'll also be moving to the new gamemode, the collection of items which at their high point a 0.25% chance of dropping and at their low point 0.01% chance are figuratively deleted. 
---
I just feel that it's reasonable that the none gameplay altering items, which hold meaning in their rarity and collectability only shouldn't be thrown on the sword.
---
I'm pretty sure this was a case of bobblehead stacking. It's the 'you can still be murdered' in the description of pacifist mode, that's seems inconsistent to me.
---
It has to shit nukes. Oh and I would ask for jdam capabilities. 
---
Where was it promised that PVE servers would be added. Pvp is an intended feature. It isn't going away.
---
I would like a dab emote though, it would be lit, or the little finger O below your waiste should initiate PvP
---
The weekly challenge to pick flowers is bugged
---
Well I think in PvP anti armour will out class. 
---
What system you on?
---
100% agree with you. 
---
Removing items because their garbage is a dumb idea. Something only a lazy person would think of. Just re-balance them.
---
Game is boring enough as it is with weapon variety in terms of decent usuage. I’m tired of seeing a EVERYONE use the same fucking weapon.
---
This shouldn’t be CoD or BF where only a handful of items are useful.
---
That's why I don't trade unless we are friends. I didn't want my stuff stolen. End up giving stuff for free mostly. 
---
Anyone know how we can guarantee Bethesda sees this because it's so spot on like for the future of the game I feel it's important they see this
---
No, cause you will go around saying "I'm Batman". When Adam West played Batman, he didn't have to tell people who he was, they knew. Oh and he didn't have all those fancy suits with their fake abs, he just had his tights and his mask. So no Batman suit for you. Oh and the Kilmer Batman was the best, Clooney suck big balls. 
---
Peaceful player here and jumping straight into the survival. I want the Wasteland to feel dangerous and that you can't trust no one.
---
Ah okay thanks :) think I have a while to go before I get one, still pretty low level
---
Yours is the best feedback post I’ve seen bar none. Thanks for taking the time to articulate it. 
---
I consider myself pretty peaceful character in games like Red Dead and Eve Online. I'm a Care Bear. But if somebody shoots at me, kills me, etc. That changes pretty fast to kind of psychopath. 
---
Thanks for the offer.  I'll give you a shout if I get stuck, but I'm happy just farming for XP and levelling at the mo.
---
I also have xp foods stims ammo ect happy to help you out 
---
Haha, what is the build material for it? 
---
What mods do you use on your power armor.
---
Specifically, do you use the targeting HUD that highlights enemies / living creatures? 
---
Welch station. They respswn like every five minutes.
---
They should wipe all of our items, but not the levels, when using old char in the survival.
---
Well, after reading a bunch of the comments on that other thread, I'm in total agreement with you that the characters should NOT be segregated permanently based on gametype, despite what a lotta people seem to want. And feel that way for like two dozen different reasons, but this makes a solid 25th addition to my list 🤣
---
Speaking of bot helmets. Have been searching FOREVER for the material for the Eyebot Helmet but they NEVER seem to drop it.
---
For the assaultron or sentry helmets this isnt an issue.
---
As folks have said, Black Water mine. But also if you go to Emmet Mountain Disposal Site right beside it there is a chance (it fluctuates between ghoul, scorched, and mole men) it will be filled with Mole Miners as well.  Lastly Welsh at the southern end of the Ash Heap is guaranteed Mole Miners as well.
---
Welch has been pretty good, but as it's really been the first place I've discovered with Mole Miners, I wondered if there was anywhere better.
---
Throw your melee weapon.
---
😂😂😂😂😂 paying attention sounds like a lot of hard work 
---
Yeah my trading is: bag on the floor, flashing my torch and jumping up and down in front of a confused low level player. Or as you say trading with actual friends. 
---
Pretty sure almost everyone in Survival will be wearing Tattered Dresses since they're the only Apparel with a Stat bonus 🤣
---
I think the end game for Fallout 76 is to turn it into a battleroyale so they can sell you cosmetics every month around that gamemode.
---
That's awful... I love it
---
I AGREE
---
it requires a few different flux
---
I take take the like a grain of salt :-p
---
Ive tried that. Its not the hud. I crafted a new helmet without one. Still crashes. Im going to try removing the jetpack tonight. Im starting to lean toward the jetpack being an issue. My brother told me he isnt crashing in his ultracite armor and the only difference is he doesnt have a jetpack on it .
---
Be sure to dislike it, it’s the most disliked video ever.
---
Delete scorchbeasts- no one thinks they’re fun to fight, no one likes fighting them, worst enemy design copied straight from Skyrim dragons ever. Delete. Scorch. Beasts.
---
Good thing I've been stacking the 1 star assassins :). Only 3 so far but it's a start. I always run Dense after my hours in FO4.
---
Ideally BGS would provide a fresh server for those that want an even playing field/fresh start and a server for already maxed players. 
---
Yeah i'm just satisfied with a little bit of sense.
---
If you dont mind me asking please stop copy pasting it makes it irrelevant the more you post it and annoying.
---
You can also get it easily by farming the Deathclaw on Deathclaw Island. 
---
Ye since fireproof gives 45% less dmg from explosions now... true.
---
I probably didn't explain properly.   With this you order them forever. Obviously ,if you get a lot of new holotapes,you'll need to redo the method.But for end game players,it should be  close to definitive.
---
Yeah more hardcore I'm guessing. We'll see haha
---
now try launching a nuke and see what happens.
---
U know Bethesda reads this shit right?   Now they gonna fix it :( lol
---
No but that seems very exploitable
---
I've taken the Gorge workshop a couple of times, but I never manage to get a lot out of it.  A few chunks which is a help tho.
---
Great points OP. I’m having fun exploring and crafting in this game, the underlying story is actually quite good and I want to find out what happened to all the factions.
---
The fallout series has never been known for its gunplay, it’s actually the weakest area of the game by far. Yet they chose to emphasize this area the most despite the fact that most weapons are trash. Not sure where there head is at on this decision.
---
I just wondered as in Fo4 you had the actual nuke zones. Seems strange they didn’t bring that aspect to 76 
---
I think it was a legit hope its kind of what inwas expecting.  I put 100s of hours into Ark because the server I join is always the same.  I can make friends and enemies we establish area controls and then build our base.  76 is desperately missing this with its random server system.  I have a few people I have met along my play time but nothing to the level Ark provided.
---
A faction system with alternate starts/automatic allies. Strongholds that are only assailable during certain events. Fight over control of different regions for control of workshops, which should actually create something valuable. 
---
How is this not what’s happening?!
---
You probably have pocketed armor and you lose the bonus when you enter the pa.
---
I agree completely
---
If your on xbox you can use the recent players tab in the Xbox UI to get back to your server. Otherwise, you're SOL
---
Bro no one even uses the PVP radio station I doubt many people will even use this server to begin with. 
---
Don’t you mean “duped and tucked away on an alternate character”?
---
I don't think 100% certain I'm sure people are still looking for ways to do any exploits. That's what people always do with these games. I just don't feel like I've heard any info about any exploits so far since the patch 
---
You are constantly insulting people, and yet you think that others are the issue with this game? I think, as i guarantee everyone else here thinks, that you are in fact whats wrong with the community. Feel free to leave the discussion, and forum in general, as you are contributing absolutely nothing.
---
I am also assuming, from your very casual and callus use of the word, that nobody you know has ever been unlucky enough to suffer from the condition? Using this to descibe elements of a video game, and even peoples personalities, is the lowest of the low. 
---
So, little boy, feel free to go back to school and educate yourself instead of sitting at your little keyboard bashing anyone and anything that has an opinion different to yours. and try thinking about what you are saying before you say it.
---
I only know that the +25 Rads effect is not working for like 1/3 of the items.
---
If it isnt added to the items description on the bottom left corner when inspecting the item, you know its bugged/broken. 
---
That's the funny (or sad?) part of all of this. They want a piece of that pie, but they don't have the first clue about what it takes to make something like this, what makes it work, and what attracts players to it. Currently this game has NONE of the features, and virtually all the mechanics they revealed so far are mistakes (like lack of revenge and forced spawns at specific locations, and aid drops). So they haven't the foggiest idea what needs to be done, very likely don't have the chops to do it (based on the state of the game months after release and quality of patches so far), and now they are pushing an ill-conceived full-on PvP mode on top of it. And for whom? If you look at achievements for the game, how many people have 20-player-kills achievement (Good Grief)? 10%, if that? So they're making an entire new mode, which will be months of effort (current beta expected in March), for the 10%. Completely and utterly clueless. 
---
Was it night time?
---
That's great that you're more happy to throw away your collection, but I'd be happier if there was a possible middle ground to it.
---
Extent of losses: [https://i.imgur.com/f9qpXKN.gif](https://i.imgur.com/f9qpXKN.gif)
---
It just waste time damn it! Thank you for making this post we need people to see it. I can't give gold RN but will soon.
---
Jesus Christ this game is a shot show.
---
This shit happens to me without PA. 
---
Yeah, but why would they bother with PvP FIRST when the majority of players will leave and won't bother with PvP if they don't add more PvE content first?
---
Not sure why you have been downvoted here. The reality is they are designing a game that caters to Level 1-150. It is far from perfect, sure, and the logic of amending root causes rather than nerfing things blindly because they’ve been requested is sound. 
---
But experiences at “end game” are substantially different to mine at L28 and 40ish hours. I’m also firmly in the casual camp, I’m not doing a “build” I don’t have alts and the best legendary I’ve got is a two shot 44. Magnum. 
---
I don’t put that much thought in to it and my motivation to do event, missions or exploring is around levelling and unlocking stuff. For example I’m currently gathering resources to build the excavator armour and wishing I could craft screws and springs!!
---
Have you ever been in one? Those things suck. Best analogy I have is getting blasted with a fire hose. 
---
Why would you do that?  Oh like maybe you wanted to power level before doing the main mission?   In which case you'd probably need to Google the name of the tape.  I suppose there are 3 or 4 missions where you pick up a holotape that you will need later.  Plus the supply drops, that are usually easy to pick out while fast scrolling.  Whatever your reason I do agree that being able to change the sort criterion would be nice.
---
Yeah exactly! 👏🏼
---
&gt; Turn up the fire rate on the minigun by double
---
Fuck no. It already shoots so fast that there's no feasible way to keep yourself supplied with ammo outside of farming for 45 minutes per 5 minutes of use. Just up the damage on heavy weapons two fold and we'll be solid. The gatling is quite nice and if you want to live the BRRRRRRRT fantasy, use the .50 cal. The rest of the heavy weapons are pure garbage. Some have potential but are held back in some way or another (plasma gun durability for instance.)
---
Nah, that's capitalism. Communism says it caters to the majority of people when actually it makes the ones with power rich as fuck and others equally poor. 
---
Adventure mode is what they will be calling the servers you have now, and it doesn't sound like they are making any changes to that at this time.
---
Survival Mode will be the option to join a server that has different PvP coding. No slap damage or needing to return fire to enter into PvP.
---
It's beta for now. So lots of things can change. 
---
Yea more Hardcore is weak I know. I thought about that maybe when a Limb gets too much DMG (turns Black, you know what I mean) you have the same Issue you had in Fallout 3 that you cant f.e don't fire two hand Guns with only one Arm etc and that you can "Heal" a blacked out Arm only by Visiting a Surgeon Bot or perform Self Surgery at urself which you need Items for (like f.e a Scalpel, some Buse and a Bandade) etc. Nothing too Crazy like SCUM or other Games since it would hurt the Game more then it would benefit it, but at least some Kind of Challenge
---
The last queen I killed despawned before her loot loaded in. Fortunately I found the needle in a haystack that was her meat pile and did finally get my hard fought loot.
---
I mean, I think most of us though multiplayer in the fallout universe would be cool. It’s just that the game needed another year of development.
---
The improvements to C.A.M.P you suggested was the minimum i expected from this game from the off, they had a good (ish) system in FO4. If they did any research at all into what the top mods were for building, they would see that extending area restrictions and additional decorating items were some of the most popular, so why not give the people what they want?
---
Instead they go complete the other way, and make everything 10x worse. I can only feel like the people who are making the decisions have never actually played the game, and are extremely ill informed.

As bad maybe, but give it a month and Survival will be in the exact same place as Adventure, so a clean slate isn't going to do much at all except make it so that the bored high-level players in Adventure won't have a place to use their toys except against other Players in Adventure. I'm pretty sure Beth wants to partially use Survival as an outlet for all those bored PvPers who wanna fight each other like gods, or use their godlike weapons against anyone they find. And Beth would rather that not take place on the normal servers because a lotta people hate it and just wanna be friendly lol
---
Thank you, I'm sort of in the middle ground. I understand why it would be beneficial, but there is people who'll end up suffering as a result.. I was hoping to try and find a reasonable solution for a middle ground where everyone would be happy. :)
---
I got frustrated after losing my shit from griefers and deleted this game. If there's no pve servers when I come back my goal is to kill players until the demand for pve goes up.
---
It's probably significantly easier to get this mode made than more pve content.
---
With TSE nerf the main problem won't probably be the weapons, but the bobbleheads. Beth should either make it so that only one BH can be used at the time, or wipe all the items we have, but not the levels. 
---
I would prefer the one BH at the time option.
---
Spot on mate!!!! 
---
Honestly, I hate it when random people try to trade. 
---
I want Plans of a King Crab Assault Mech...... but you find him broken and need to fix it with Titan and Uran☺️
---
It's almost like they don't know anything about any other game ever and ate just parroting buzz words without knowing the meaning.
---
ROFL, such a great community this game has. 
---
I wasn't giving 76 a pass it was a joke that I was surprised by the fact that I played Just Cause and it didn't even trigger till the final cut scene that I had no story pushing my motivation to play.
---
I am not bored with the game play I just have nothing left to achieve short of a few statistical changes that wont really matter.
---
If you look at the amount of threads on here clamouring for something more to do such as different nuke areas or new bosses people havent moved on.  I have a small amount of trust that Beth intends to fix this but its not just flipping a switch and their current production time frame has be slow.  So take a break they will feel a decline in players and want to push harder to bring them back.  Plus maybe if the people at higher levels take a break the lowbies have a better shot at going to a new area that wont murder them because it scaled to the level 400 who was just passing by.
---
I don’t completely agree with your comment.
---
I think for folks who want PvP, they  should get their on environment, but not at the lowbies and pve cost.
---
I agree you and everyone who want pvp should get an environment where there are NO rules and NO restrictions.  
---
You want to test your gear and skills against others.? Fine, but stop mugging lowbies and pve pacifists just trying to level up, and play.   unless of course you enjoy bullying weaker folks.
---
Yep, if a new item is added to the store and doesn't require the game to be updated then it's been in the game since the start.
---
Always gonna be the duper fault... Bethesda are experts at passing blame..for a game that wasn't ready in the first place 👍 I'm a massive Bethesda fan.. And i play daily but not to play the game anymore i spend 80% of my time helping low levels and people who can't work round the state of this game 
---
Same, if I have something I dont want, its either at a vendor or in the blue suitcase
---
Possibly. Id say rn tho their focus is purely more engaging pvp and trying to get that right! Be cool to see less resources and more dangers and injuries as you mentioned. For me I'll be sticking with adventure mode for now anyways - havent reached end game lol
---
Yup. Fallout 76 thunderdome DLC
---
Cue Rose with a wild wig and chainmail dress 
---
Thanks OP. The PDFs are great!
---
I’ve heard that pa caps strength to 11
---
I knew this was coming. They aren't investing any more developing resources to FO76. They are focusing already to the new games. There is only really small team maintaining FO76 who create some minor new content time to time. Just to keep game barely alive so they don't need to admit publicly that game was really big fail.
---
Its not thrown away. You keep your stuff in adventure mode. If you want to switch to survival and never play adventure again, then it is your thing. But you dont lose anything. 
---
Seriously, people who have jobs don't have time to level two characters. 
---
It does, currently. Everything about the second round acts as the first. After the update, it's supposed to only be 25% as effective, and with explosive effects, it should only get 20% of the damage of the first round. 
---
Well, yea,
---
but it has to be more resource intelligent too. Why the Fu** do I need Adhesive to repair my Hammer? and why is repairing my Hammer as expensive as repairing my Laser Rife XD
---
100% in the same boat. They sacrificed so much content to make it multiplayer instead and it's brutally short because of that.
---
Bring us real content, not the same content repackaged in a more PvP-oriented format. Everyone who has followed the franchise and bought it because of that is expecting a *lot* more that we can do without having to fight each other.
---
So anti-debate tone policing is what you have for me? \*yawn\*
---
That means you don't actually have anything to say.
---
Yeah same here. I'll still go back and play fo4 sometimes. The only game I actually enjoy farming stuff in is ark for some reason. The closest thing ove found to a tse so far is an instigating assault rifle and it's meh haha
---
Try this. It worked for me. 
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/42916/kw
---
Yeah, but that'd require effort.
---
Exactly! It'll wind up with the same imbalance in a month or two, and Bethesda is looking more long-term, because they really only make money from selling *new* copies of the game and attracting more players. That and the Atom shop lol.
---
I’ve got a lot of pie in 76 once I heard it was possible. I always thought it was a troll machine in other games. I can’t tell you how disappointed I was to learn there was nothing special about it at all. Not even an xp buff? Come on now. 
---
Because there is a horde of morons circlejerking about turning Fallout 76 into a clone of every other shooter "MMO" on the market. They are working hard to browbeat Bethesda into making this another milquetoast piece of shit game.
---
But I do want to play it!
---
and I do love collecting items!
---
But it just sucks to have them be split apart and or start all over again and I'm hoping that there's a possible meaningful middle ground where everyone is happy, including the minority of collectors like myself.
---
*None gameplay altering cosmetics being available on both servers, even if left untradeable seems like a fair solution.*
---
Much more picky about trading? You mean able to buy or sell at an equilibrium price determined by supply and demand, like how economies work? Not sure I follow. Certainly you're not suggesting that people who have an aptitude for trading are to blame for you lacking that aptitude? Or are you trying to say that because you don't like to trade, those who do should be disadvantaged with the addition of new game systems?
---
Im not the person you were arguing with originally, and have no opinion to add to yours and his debate on the content, just wanted to try and make you a little more self-aware.
---
I hope for your sake that nobody you love does get cancer, but if they do, you will finally understand quite how toxic and nasty you have been to other people.
---
/u/lonewanderer
---
Franklin is rolling in his grave over that shoehorned qoute.
---
Well pacifist mode is exactly what it says it is, you are a pacifist. It means you won't attack other players. So in true to life you are peaceful it doesn't mean some evil person is not going to come cause you harm you have just given up the ability to fight back. 
---
To be one shotted though does suck and Bethesda needs to do something about the cheaters, as another guy said figure out a way to ban people who have tons bobble heads on them .
---
By how much though? Like instead of a 1-2 shot death is it now like a 5-10 shot death?
---
Yeah trade window is way too off to actually use, especially since it takes weeks for trading partner to realize you're in a trading window even. Dropping a paper bag and shooting at it is just so much faster and better
---
I'm entirely aware. I've just been dealing with the same moronic bullshit in this forum for months and I'm not going to waste my energy trying to play patty cake with a bunch of douchebags who are trying their hardest to ruin this game.
---
Hard /= fun for everyone lol
---
We run in groups of 4. We'd lose money between each other. Also we dont hunt low lvls as a target. We usually go for high lvl ppl
---
Dude. You need the code, which you can find on the internet, and a nuclear key card. For the keycard you have to start a quest at whitesprings bunker. It will lead you to a drone which you have to shoot down and loot. The code pieces are basically useless. 
---
I have them, they’re just cosmetic unfortunately 
---
Your pockets disappear as do any weight reduction perks from your normal armour as it unequips in PA :-)
---
Pistols are awesome,
---
But not right now,
---
I want to dual wield,
---
Just pow pow pow!
---
And the blood is red or whatever.
---
You can't scrap legendaries.
---
I have one pie and 1 two shot minigun, and an explosive dragon.
---
Huh. Interesting. I’ll have to give that a try!
---
Yeah it is really terrible, but this thread didn't deserve nice things.
---
Thank you! I bought the game this week, because it was a PvE adventure I wanted to enjoy with my buddy. 
---
you can have the materials on both your persona and in the stash, but do a quick check of the stash inventory before going to the pa station :)
---
always fixed it for me..
---
having to spend points on class freak, and even then 25% downside is still a downside. The only mutations with "no downside" are chameleon and plague walker, and they aren't necessarily no downside perks when considering the gameplay sacrifice you need to optimize them.
---
There is literally no justification for how toxic you are being. Have you ever stopped to consider that, perhaps, you are the moronic douchebag? Food for thought.
---
The face that you are entirely aware and still continue, shows what a small minded little boy you are. Im sure that your wonderful personality will hold you in good stead when you get older.
---
I don't think it is so much 'hate', as it is 'who cares'. Everyone who knows anything about this game's pvp will immediately conclude that a leaderboard is going to be filled with the biggest griefers. You basically will have a list of players in a group of six  whose daily gameplay is to sit at vault 76 killing newbs as they walk out of the vault and other players that have died only to respawn there. How does that measure accomplishment? You expect people to be proud of that?
---
I pop overdrive repeatedly when fighting the queen. Fury for all you hammer swinging Neanderthals 😝
---
Let one.of each bobble head be used together but don't let multiple of the same stack let it just increase the time remaining. I agree TSE is not the problem it's the guy running around with 400 pounds of explosive bobbleheads.
---
"They've admitted that they won't go 'free to play', so that means that they'll be charging us a monthly fee...'fee to play'"
---
FTFY
---
I want something to come from the factions, like there's a way to actually belong to the Responders or the Brotherhood and get some kind of benefit.  The quests don't really give you anything other than a nice new piece of armour/clothes to wear, but you're still not a member unless you pretend to be.  Want to be a Responder? Mark yourself officially, and you get a 30% bonus to reviving other players.  Order of Mysteries? Sneak Bonus. Brotherhood?  Bonus to heavy weapons.  And so on.  This way you get a much better sense of being in a faction, and getting something out of that faction, but also a tangible benefit that doesn't have to come from your perk card setup.    You can make each faction follow a loose class structure that may be more appealing.
---
Then you can create faction specific events that will only show if you're in that faction.  A Responder Quest could be to take a hospital from Scorched and then repair the machines to distribute Stimpacks across the map (using the same mechanic as the broken Feed The People event that used to give everyone on the map food, and not just your team).  You could be tasked with building a Mothman Shrine if you join the Cult.  There are some real possibilities in there I reckon.
---
I would like a no mic symbol by their name and maybe a different symbol if they have turned off voice chat.
---
I have to say that, I am excited about the survival, but if I have to make a fourth character, I think I will pass. I'm OK, if they would strip us from our items, but I can't level a fourth character for a long time. 
---
Sort by options...alphabetical, new, quest related
---
Fucking exactly this! I can't believe people think a clean slate would help. All it does is create a barrier for entry for new players months down the line, and because this isn't a subscription game Bethesda only gets more money from selling new copies over the next year or more (plus the Atom shop, but new players helps those sales too).
---
Idk if it's a good thing or not but keeping the same loot and same character means they need to think of the other servers when they make balance changes.
---
Will that make them more cautious or could it lead to favoritism and being blind to the problems the adventure servers are having while making pvp balance changes. I get pve is in the PVP servers and vice versa but pve players complaints aren't gonna be the same and I could see changes happening In one that really frustrates the other. 
---
Actually vault 101 was never meant to be open so vault 101 was a experiment vault like the rest.
---
If I’m trying to farm it then I’ll server hop at Welch station, check the map to the south and I’d say 1/5 times it will be there.
---
Also if you server hop at Welch station, you can both a. Kill all the mole men and b. Sell their weapons to the vendor. It’s a really easy source of 200 caps.
---
Considering less than 5% of all players across all platforms have the a achievement for killing 20 people, less than 5% of players seem to want it. 
---
As it currently stands, for the majority of what workshops offer, there are far faster ways that produce far more material far, far more quickly than they ever will in their current state. I can get 500+ steel and lead within 10 minutes, if I already have all the acid I need. No combination of workshops will produce anything remotely near that. They need a serious buff. Your suggestions are reasonable. Workshops certainly don't need to be stupidly strong as they still do provide material passively, but they're stupidly weak at the moment. The amount of material you get is so horribly lackluster for the effort and time required. Getting 30~ of an ore an hour is the definition of "Am I a joke to you?". 
---
The one biggest thing they have to work on though is providing an incentive to taking a workshop from another player. As it currently stands, and even after they may make changes, it's just simple enough to change servers rather than fighting someone for it. Your suggestion works very well for that. I'd much rather bother fighting someone for their 2 and a half hours of progress for a much higher yield in material than what I could earn from starting from scratch from a non-progressed workshop. Starting at 60 ore and hour, and with the 20% increase per half hour, you have to calculate how much ore is being produce per half hour. 
---
60 / 60 = 1 minute per unit
---
72 / 60 = 1.2 minutes per unit
---
84 / 60 = 1.4 minutes per unit
---
96 / 60 = 1.6 minutes per unit
---
108 / 60 = 1.8 minutes per unit
---
120 / 60 = 2 minute per unit
---
Production over time with each 30 minute increment accounted for and the resulting yield:
---
30 x 1 = 30 units per 30 minutes
---
30 x 1.2 = 36 units per 30 minutes
---
30 x 1.4 = 42 units per 30 minutes
---
30 x 1.6 = 48 units per 30 minutes
---
30 x 1.8 = 54 units per 30 minutes
---
30 x 2 = 60 units per 30 minutes
---
Total units = 270
---
Obtaining a workshop that's already been progressed by another player at full capacity and the total yield over the same amount of time it would take to build it up:
---
60 x 6 = 360
---
A 130 ore difference. The difference should be higher, but not by too much. Near 200 would be good. You could decrease the time required per interval change, but I think you'd have to increase the buff it provides per interval too. Make it like 15-20 minutes per buff, and increase the buff percentage, and maybe reduce the total number of intervals from your proposed 5. There are several ways you could do it. For me, I'll increase the buff to 290% from 100%, which divided by 4 is 72.5% per interval, and reducing the intervals from 5 to 4, and I'm changing the base to 50.
---
50 / 60 = 0.83 unit per minute
---
86.25 / 60 = 1.4375 units per minute
---
122.5 / 60 = 2.04 units per minute
---
158.75 / 60 = 2.64 units per minute
---
195 / 60 = 3.25 units per minute
---
30 x 0.83 = 24.9 units per 30 minute
---
30 x 1.4375 = 43.125 units per 30 minutes
---
30 x 2.04 = 61.2 units per 30 minutes
---
30 x 2.64 = 79.2 units per 30 minutes
---
30 x 3.25 = 97.5 units per 30 minutes
---
Total = 305.92~ units
---
Total with full buff the entire way:
---
97.5 x 5 = 487.5
---
487.5 - 305.92 = 181.58 unit difference
---
487.5 / 305.92 = 1.58~, or a 58%~ difference
---
I think the difference should be more than 60%. Most at 75% more.
---
Reduce base unit to 45. Go back to 5 intervals. Go with 290%, divide it by 5 for 58% per interval.
---
45 / 60 = 0.75 units per minute
---
71.1 / 60 = 1.185 units per minute
---
97.2 / 60 = 1.62 units per minute
---
123.3 / 60 = 2.05 units per minute
---
149.4 / 60 = 2.49 units per minute
---
175.5 / 60 = 2.925 units per minute
---
30 x 0.75 = 22.5 units per 30 minutes
---
30 x 1.185 = 35.55 units per 30 minutes
---
30 x 1.62 = 48.6 units per 30 minutes
---
30 x 2.05 = 61.5 units per 30 minutes
---
30 x 2.49 = 74.7 units per 30 minutes
---
30 x 2.925 = 87.75 units per 30 minutes
---
Total from scratch:
---
330.6
---
Total from full buff from capturing it:
---
87.75 x 6 = 526.5
---
526.5 / 300.6 = 1.75~ difference
---
526.5 - 300.6 = 225.9 units difference
---
So I accidentally managed to get an almost perfectly exact 75% difference.
---
Also, we just straight up need a "reconnect to last server" option in the main menu.
---
Anti Armour and Explo    
---
or     
---
Bloodied and Explo      
---
I Want It Because In Many Games I Have Done (To Give Myself A Challenge) I’ll Make A Brand New Character And Go To The Hardest Area And Start There So In Conclusion I’m Sorry To Say But I Can’t Wait For Survival Mode 
---
The duping will happen there too though, and those guns will be even more lucrative for dupers to sell, so how will that help?
---
Thanks :)
---
You don't think people would just trade their TSE stuff to their new character? ... Requiring new characters would only delay it till people start to hit lv 40-50. So maybe half a day...
---
Yeah, the whole using your same character thing seems weird to me. The whole idea was to give bored op players something else to do. I don't see how this is going to satisfy them for long.
---
when a event is on, can you see if there are players in it ? when i check the map the events always looks like no players are there ?
---
just wondering since it's best to be 2 doing the powering up events, if not it's a bit stressfull, lol
---
&gt; Expectations are so low
---
And yet the potential is so high ;P 
---
At first I wanted the same, just some DR/ER would be enough, but came up with a more expanding idea :)
---
Griefers will just spend all their caps or trade them to their alt account and get on survival mode to make caps off people not holding TSE explosives lvl 125 like them.
---
Reality: it will be ass halfassed as possible and all they will really do is remove the slap damage stuff so full damage is always on. People are giving them far to much credit, they ain't going to balance shit.
---
Make your own quests. One of the most fun thing I've done in this game so far was stealthily following a guy around Whitesprings, messing with him. Could tell he was exploring for the first time and noticed he was very thorough so had some fun with it.
---
If he went in a room with only one door I closed the door behind him. At one point he twigged to this and immediately re-opened it. I just stared at him for a second, then slowly reached over and closed it again in his face. I also closed the door behind him after he left a room and did the "annoyed face" emote like I was actually that fastidious. 
---
I just always tried to stay behind him and out of his sight, except when popping out would be most comical. Best example was he went to search some toilets, so whilst he checked the 'mens', I snuck into a stall in the 'ladies'. Closed the door behind me and waited some 30 seconds for him to come check them too. He opens the stall door and there's me, squatting on the toilet. I do the annoyed face again and shut the door in his face.
---
Hopefully first vault opening
---
It is possible. I made a massive Base (resulting in a ban) 
---
it didn't affect anything and for a day me and my friends use it fine. 
---
https://youtu.be/z6PCunF3wYk
---
You know, this sounds fair. Keep your levels, keep your perks. Your first time in you start "naked" and go from there.
---
In a mine.
---
You also have to remember that they have multiple games in development right now.
---
If I were a betting man, I would bet that they pulled a majority of the developers off of fallout76 once it was released to go work on the space game and the next Elder Scrolls game.
---
There have been updates since release but nowhere near the amount that there should have been so far. I'm guessing they have a very small skeleton crew working on the game.
---
It's not a happy little way if you've already been killed once or twice, in a game mode where you drop even more stuff lol. And the dupers are gonna hit the new servers too so how will a clean slate have done anything after a month has passed?
---
Griefers will just spend all their caps or trade them to their alt account and get on survival mode to make caps off people not holding TSE explosives lvl 125 like them. There needs to be a minimum required amounts of caps to join survival. 1000 caps would be perfectly reasonable in my opinion.
---
damn this game really is a massive failure huh? why does anyone bother trying to continue playing or defend this game? seems like they did nothing right for fo76
---
What fraud? Just inspect the item before you buy it. 
---
People would get up to that lvl anyway. So what's your point? Your restriction would only affect what? The first week of the game mode?
---
I wish I could upvote this twice.
---
So much yes! I cannot be arsed to do loads of time-consuming experimenting to get the figures on these. It's like the Junkies effect "does more damage the more your withdrawal effects"... Like wtf? Is it a linear relationship withdrawals to bonus damage? How does it stack with other effects? Additively or multiplicatively? Is there a cap?
---
Same applies for literally every perk and legendary. There's even more confusion about "heavy weapons weigh 90% less" What, exactly constitutes a heavy weapon? All these classifications need looking at too.
---
Further, perk chances are required too. Super Duper explicitly states chances, that's great. But how can I decide if I need another rank in Scrounger based on "find more ammo" VS "find even more ammo"?
---
Low yield gambling, lol
---
Yeah, like how the explosives legendary mod is affected by different perks and what amount of damage does it really do?
---
They hate them, it's against their tos and people on ebay or gameflip are making bank and Bethesda gets none of that cash
---
By far the main reason I see PVP as pointless. There's little incentive. It's hard to role-play if nothing ever changes. Make bombs do lasting damage. Let us attack and defend things. ITS STILL OCTOBER 23rd
---
There is a new method guarantee it
---
Sure! It seems like I put northeastern by mistake, as it's actually in the northwestern corner of the airport - I'll edit the original post to correct this now.
---

i did it on my pc char. last night, lv27, no problem at all, just run and sneak, tok me 15-20 min's to do it from start to Finnish (all 5 beacons including the last on in the cave, then back to defiant and register) , and i did get my weightless power armor in my inventory, it will be a full ultracite if you place it on the ground :)
---
But, i have done it before on the xbox, i am a lv126 there...
---
You can see them by checking out the trophies for the game through the system. 
---
Ah a good point actually. I didn't use FT on my first toon until i explored every location on the map and the amount of resoureces you save just by teleporting around is hudge. Especially early in the game when you don't have OP toys.
---
Hopefully newbies will still be unable to participate in pvp until level 5 so that they dont get insta killed 
---
I just leave random people small paper bags of stuff, it's easier. Also put things in containers for others to pick up for nothing. I've never taken any caps from someone else. I don't trust the trading system.
---
Well if there is i haven't seen or heard about it.
---
I'm not really sure that's true.  I know I manage to keep room in both my stay and personal inventory.  Maybe I'm the lucky 5% but I don't think I'm really that special haha
---
You already spent your money, they want new people's money, and fresh start is a bigger barrier for new players down the line. So maybe you don't understand profit models, but new sales are gonna trump you being on their servers all the time 🤣
---
Lol. 
---
Biggest comparisons are CoD and Fortnite. 
---
In CoD majority of tactics are speed kills, headshots, one hit melees, you see this in the current state of fo76 PvP. 
---
In fortnite when you die all your gear drops and get picked up by the other players. Not very different than fo76 and not very different than what they're proposing with the new survival mode. 
---
cave will have lv68 enemies if somone high lv has just been trough there, bring your best gun and some stimpacks for those you can't out run :)
---
I think your right. Most of the people complaining are lowbies
---
I especially like the no nuke indicators, and I would also appreciate having no player tag above my head.
---
I would PvP if it wasn't so difficult to start a fight. I have to slap... then the opposition gets a full hit off. Now I'm at disadvantage in the fight. There's no incentive to PvP currently.
---
I was sold on the "survival game" aspect, but it hasn't really been delivered...
---
Ahh fix those cracks in the handle. Maybe it's wood glue haha!
---
Just from doing them. Any of the ones where you have to hunt down the alpha after searching for a horde spawns one. Uranium Fever spawns 2-3. There are probably one or two more, but I'll always do those if they pop up.
---
I'm going to assume yes. I think that's part of the allure of the survival mode... is that person over there friendly or not? Take the gamble to find out.
---
wait what survival mode
---
I approve your breakfast choices. 
---
If I use a mic, then I can't use my 5.1 sound system. Rather not.
---
Somebody screen shot it cause I'm in the same boat - tried every fountain I could find last night with no effect
---
If you completed any of it during B.E.T.A. it didn't track.
---
This is awesome.  
---
you can, but you want get your ultracite pa...
---
I'd assume it wouldn't be possible to trade between adventure characters and survival characters, as they'll be in entirely different servers.
---
But this one is refreshing due to offer and supply law. I feel moistened. 
---
You have to see the whole picture.
---
Of course its only that few people, because you actually CAN'T kill them at all! (in most cases)  
---
They would have to agree, or have a bounty on them, or the other guy must be at 1% hp already, or people would need to exploit in order to actually kill other people.
---
That sums it up.
---
If the game had this survival mode from the beginning, numbers would look totally different, more like 96,3% of player would have killed at least 20 others. Be it out of fear, in self defense or by actively hunting others.
---
There's already new dupe methods, and old ones that never got patched lol. Clean slate is pointless and will be spoiled the same way in a month, if not weeks lol
---
I have the same problem. I start trading to see if people have the magazines i miss,but they never seem to understand. Some people also lack the most basic logic,when doing anything ;a guy once didn't know how to set a price on his items...really dude?
---
I've always had good luck with this workshop for titanium.
---
Almost like PVP wasn't thought through very thoroughly. new characters and different rules means they'd be able to balance them separately which is my biggest reason that might be a good idea.
---
Cause in PVE there's less to worry about. You've only got to convince one person that it was a pair and fun experience
---
Course that could for sure lead to a split and potentially a focus on whichever community makes them the most money 
---
I've been saving all my bobble heads and magazines and not used one. Tried to use a magazine to see how they work and I was awarded the trophy for reading 20.
---
I'd say it might be a bit buggy....
---
*Skims too fast through the text and misunderstands* Walmart is the target market? 
---
Didn’t find it funny because they are announcing a new mode and already literally about to fuck it up. If there weren’t thousands of people upvoting posts about letting dupers bring their god gear into survival mode then that’s exactly what would happen. At least now we have a chance at having them implement it in a way that isn’t fucked from the start.  Developers have responded to those posts already so I know they are aware. 
---
I understand the joke you’re trying to make but it would be a lot funnier if Bethesda wasn’t so fucking inept. They do need help and that help needs to come from people that have many hours in the game and actually know what the fuck they are talking about. 
---
it is, and that's whats worse. Wasted potential is never a good thing!
---
Maybe just go play a better game instead...?
---
I still got the suit at the end of the mission.
---
The Ultracite PA is a quest reward so it wouldn't matter how you did the quest.
---
This seems like the best option, have like 3-4 pre-set options to the left of the perk cards. Although I do think they need to rethink their hacker and lockpick skills, I mean master hacker is the top but you still need all 3 active to hack a level 3 computer...it still took 3 levels to get that but instead of stacking cards we have to have 3  cluttering up
---
That’s why I’d love to see persistent servers and the workshop system expanded/made the crux of faction base development. 
---
That’d make nukes incredibly interesting too. Give each server its own codes so it’s up to each faction to decipher before the week is up. 
---
Make silo runs actually challenging so there is some risk involved in launching the nuke. Maybe alert other factions when a silo has been breached? 
---
Make nukes affect workshops until the weekly nuke code reset or scorched earth a subregion. 
---
There’s so much that could be done. 
---
Sadly the game only tracks a few of your mines at a time, as far as I can tell. When I try to lay too many the oldest ones just disappear or detonate. Maybe worth more testing though 🤷
---
In PvE, TSE will still be at the top IMO but just marginally. TSE weapons right now outshine everything out there, now you can look for a gun that fits your build more.
---
Yes in Pvp with the fireproof perk other Legendary effects will likely do better damage.
---
This same problem would exist after a week so what's your point exactly? 
---
Go to Watoga, there are 4 in pa's and one in a generator that I know of so far.
---
I had a successful trade recently. Had zero rad away after an unpleasant incident and needed it fast. A guy came upon my camp and I manged to get him to sell me some. Didn't realise right away that he wanted a revolver I had too. There should be a big notification when they tag something they're interested in. Also I couldn't sell the gun and wished there was a decline offer button that's easier to use than just leaving the trade window.
---
The trade system was obviously not thought out well. I just don’t participate. If I get the trade emote I give thumbs down and just drop a bag. 
---
I wonder if Bethesda had half of 76 done, fired a mojority of staff or moved them to different projects, then hired a bunch of temps who “ya I’ve played fallout once” to finish the game. 
---
I agree, but you shouldn't be able to transfer characters between the main game and private servers.
---
This made my belly chuckle whilst sat at my desk in work.
---
I got a quest to kill a fox at some diner. That was heart breaking. They weren't even that shy.
---
Farming items is differant than monsters. Go to white springs. Walk of the back entrance turn left. Follow the path around the building. There is a putting green up there with about 30 golf balls. If you look around on the greens rhere is around 100 golf balls. Golf clubs also give you plastic when you break them
---
 There a weapon so it wont show up as a needed material
---
No legendaries is actually a really interesting idea for a new gametype, regardless of character segregation 🤔 would level the playing field even between existing high-level characters and would be really cool once in a while
---
Walk the wall it blends with the environment very easy to miss looks just like a school drinking fountain. I'm at work but when I get home I can add a pic if no one else does
---
Almost as irrelevant as your comment.
---
PvP is ONLY for assholes. They should just get rid of it.
---
This is actually a sensible idea that Bethesda will never implement because they don't care.
---
Your crazy if you.think you can remove my fire axe! Fuck the super sledge, Fire a axe with spikes mod is comparable damage at 2 pounds of weight. With durability so shitty I can carry 2-3 of these suckers around for killing trash, and keep my bloodied fire axe and All Rise for the real shit.  Super sledge weight too much to be worth it, which is a point you made.
---
Well once they saw the state of things after leaving the vault they could have lost hope, seeing that no one survived. And now there's mutant bat dragons.
---
They could do a level scaling type thing like in world of warcraft in pvp. In wow in pvp everyone is given the same item level so its mostly skill that  decides who wins. Doubt Bethesda will ever do that but it's worth trying. 
---
God forbid someone care about a game. Jesus.
---
Also, you'd call anyone who remotely tries to put even the slightest amount of effort into a game a tryhard. You'd call anyone who wants a slight challenge a tryhard.
---
God forbid people have different ideas of fun and satisfaction!
---
You want to call us cancerous, meanwhile you're the perfect example of one toxic human being... may I recommend chilling the fuck out...?
---
Mid 90s word for cops. 
---
Not that hard to implement a chat text.
---
I don't want to hear your voice when I'm playing my game I don't want to hear anybody's voice when I'm playing my game.
---
You do realize that if you make a statement its you who have to prove its true. Its not the other's job to prove its false
---
"yeet"
---
that is really strange, if you skip the fist 4 bit's of a quest you haven't done the quest in my mind :/
---
not trying to be an ass, but sounds like a bug ...
---
legendary explosive mod is affected by:
---
a) Damage bonus from current weapon type that it's rolled on (so say shotgunner if on shotgun, rifleman if on single-shot rifles, commando on automatic rifles/smgs etc)
---
b) Damage bonus from Demolition Expert (INT tree)
---
c) any multiplicative bonuses, that affect all damage (there are lots, like adrenaline or bloody mess perks, chems etc), or additional legendary bonuses, whether it's against certain type or mutatant's if mutated etc
---
how it does damage in reality:
---
let's take a Explosive Combat Shotgun. Not Two Shot, the regular. How it works.
---
On paper ie character sheet (current version, I've tested that combat shotgun shoots 7 pellets)
---
let's say your level 50 combat shotgun does vanilla (without any perks or buffs) 16 damage per pellet (112 damage non-explosive).
---
Explosive adds this 100% weapon damage as AoE explosions, so same 16 damage per pellet.
---
so, short, vanilla damage= 7\*16 + 7\*16 = 224. fair enough
---
say you have a regular setup with 45% into shotgunner and 100% into Demolition Expert (about average), some may run 60% shotty, but i see no reason to waste so many useful STR points. You also run 15% bloody mess and you use chems (psychobuff lets say) for 25% bonus. Let's omit tenderizer or Adrenaline stacking.
---
so, sheetwise, it'll be
---
16\*1,45\*1,15\*1,25=\~33 ballistic damage
---
16\*1,45\*2\*1,15\*1,25=\~66 explosive damage  
---
Add them up and multiply by total pellets and you get
---
(33+66)\*7=\~698 sheet damage. Seems about right. I have about the sam number (slightly over 700 i think). this is all before any armor calculation
---
that's on paper.
---
Reality.
---
a Monster has typically 4 limbs, chest and a head, making it 6 hit zones, each with own damage calculation (each separeta resistances). Some monster may have more, some less, but typically it's 6. A single projectile (bullet or pellet aka no AOE) will hit one part once. Explosives (rocket launcher missiles too) has AoE, where each hit can hit multiple zones. That is dependant on zone spread (physically how far they are from the hit) and perks like grenadier (boosts AoE radius by 100%).
---
Let's take a dude (a supermutant for example) with 6 hit zones. you hit a chest with all pellets and every other zone will be hit as well
---
* For ballistic damage it's sill going to be 33 damage per pellet or approx 231 ballistic damage for all pellets (before armor calculation, depends on the zone)
---
* For Explosive damage it's 66 damage times 6 zones per pellet aka single pellet does 396 damage. A single pellet. For all pellets, thats 2772 damage. Yep. a single explosive shotgun, if it hits all enemy zones, will hit on average build nearly 3K damage a pop.
---
And then you ca factor 2-shot, although for shotgun, afaik, Two Shot is actually a bad prefix, as it adds just a one pellet, so it's just maybe 15% increase.
---
That's just like, your opinion man.
---
Just because people aren't advertising the new dupes on this sub doesn't mean they don't exist.
---
If duping is fixed and the ban hammer has banned dupers (like Bethesda have said) then how are there still new listings going up on ebay for items that look suspiciously duped (i.e. 30-40 listings for TSE shotguns from one source etc).
---
Why the downvote? He's right. I even try to drop the bag on bright concrete to make it visible,but they just come right up to my face like i 'll drop a gun from my nostrills!
---
My psn is Savio0rtega —second o is a zero. I play fairly regularly but probably not as much this weekend (mom is visiting). I can help you with low level quests and materials and what not. 
---
I’m happy to help with quests or takedowns if you need it. HMU PSN Lewwwd. 
---
I've been downvoted anyway so apparently it's just me that wants coop events.
---
The bonus to having a nice house is having a nice house. Building it doesn't need to have some stat bonus attached, you.build a cool house because you want to.
---
I understand what your saying not saying they banned everyone that ever duped. Or that there isn't duping 
---
I follow more then just this sub and the videos are usually all over youtube/internet 
---
Items are disappearing and I don't know which conditions set it off. It happened on 3 occasions. 
---
1. Dropped a lvl 45 fully modded recon gauss rifle and it vanished, no paper bag even spawned.
---
2. Dropped 400 45. caliber rounds for somebody and same thing as above.
---
3. Somebody built me a PA Station on my alts base. I moved it around a bit and didn't find a place I was happy with. Logged in today to move it and upon pressing E or Space to move it to a good spot it just vanished.
---
Besides that sometimes PA pieces unequip upon loading in or fast traveling. Sometimes it seems to be a UI bug only and you keep your carry weight. But other times the PA's weight is added to your inventory and you lose the PA bonus of your set (like Excavator power armor, it always takes my right arm and sometimes my helmet).
---
Yep, fucking babies around this sub god they are so up their fucking ass. Chill the fuck out for a bit, be patient and let the motherfucking developers do their work for once.
---
Hi, Steelkatanas!
---
I wish you peace and prosperity in the new year! Take care!
---
-HappyFriendlyBot
---
Ooh I really like this compromise! Let people play on both as they please, but disable *all* legendary effects in the PvP servers. Pure build &amp; strategy competition instead of just getting your hands on good 3*s. Very clever 👍
---
I also miss the ability to pick up objects and throw them
---
Once again , less than 5% of people are still *some people.
---
Nope, I run around with 22-27str in power armor.
---
Honestly, it should be rare that this happens and you should plan accordingly. Don’t ever carry that much junk that it matters. And if you’re specifically gathering a particular supply, Stash often. 
---
lol 
---
at $276 for a very poor quality jacket I'd like to think cos players will just buy a blue jacket and get there own 76 logo printed on if for 10-20 bucks.
---
After the canvas bag and nuka cola rum head aches though surely Bethesda should have learnt there lesson with snide merchandising i'd have thought.
---
Nah, I'm just gonna kill players until pve servers are a thing, fuck it.
---
Oh my god, the pip boy thing is driving me crazy. I rely on eating food a lot to heal (I mean, most people probably do??) and I keep freezing out pulling up the pip boy.
---
You do you, man. 
---
Award given. Can't wait for the confeti shotguns.
---
Looks guys, from a business perspective... the game is lacking sales and it’s lacking a good reputation. If the devs at Bethesda are adding new modes and new content to the game we should be thankful that their at least making an attempt to satisfy the customers. 
---
I toss holotapes in my stash after I listen to them, the only ones I keep in my inventory are quest items that can't be dropped. (Which is almost exclusively overseer logs)
---
&gt;The gold means people care
---
Dude... That's like $5... Slow your role. 
---
I'm fine with the carry weight and stash weight being different. I just wish the game displayed both when transferring items. I know I could do the math out, but it seems like a reasonable request vs. Whipping my calculator out everytime.
---
&gt; *I was worried that Bethesda would serve up some half-cocked, lazy PvP mode, and sure enough, here we are.* 
---
I don't know about anyone else but this was 100% expected. A company that is clueless about online MP gaming and somehow this is a thing? I suppose this proves that the devs don't play MP online and literally nobody in Bethesda does or has done - what? Nobody???
---
Nobody at Bethesda has *ever* played an online MP pvp? And this is a "Triple A company"?
---
This is beyond mental.
---
Scrap an assaultron blade. That will give you the circuits.
---
&gt; It seems like ***Bethesda***....... At this point I just hope some ***other*** company buys the Fallout IP...
---
Read. Can you do it?
---
Survival mode is already DOA. The dupers are going to own the servers right from the start. This was the worst possible way to begin a new mode. It shows very little effort or care. Why would anyone make a new character just to get shit on by any and every asshole who has duped and exploited there way to God status? Essentially the “new” survival mode just flips a switch on PVP restrictions and adjusts consequences. That it? Unbelievable 
---
Can’t wait to name everything penis
---
They haven't had thousands of players to grind the perfect legendaries and then sell them across the playerbase. Legendary finds would be much more interesting and rare in a small community like their office, instead of only god-rolls being worthwhile. Could be they aren't really used to  how heavily equipped the actual community is.
---
Yeah, it probably is a bug. 
---
But if I d/c while in Glassed Caverns I'll just run back because I don't want to have to go across the bog again.
---
Move the camp bench around. It controls where you spawn.  I played with mine a bit so I now spawn just inside my front door.
---
Nah, Beth fanboys will downvote you if you say anything that an be construed as criticism toward Beth. Keep your head up though, your suggestion sounds awesome.
---
The only problem I have with this is the fact that people still put their damn camps right next to the golf course building at white springs. I lost two legendary 3* ghouls last night to a camp with nothing but a platform and six missile launchers. The only thing I find strange about this though is that my MIRV fat man did nothing to the camp (Pacifist off) and the missiles started targeting me even though I wasn’t wanted yet... maybe I just use orbital strikes from now on. 
---
true, that might works, and should work :) never tested it myself..
---
I felt this way too until I played an MMO where there were no PVP rules and no safe zones. You lost items/weapons/armor on death which made if feel real. After I got over my initial shock of being murdered by higher level players it was an amazing experience. Seriously. It made everyone clan up for safety and there were real politics and alliances involved in holding resource areas on the map. Players in groups would definitely have an advantage over solo players but aren't we supposed to be working together to rebuild America?
---
HOWEVER... 
---
As awesome as that concept sounds to me... it won't work after rampant duping. It also wouldn't likely work with this player base. In my experience about 5% want to grief, 10% want to group up and 85% want to be left alone because they're trying to play the single player Fallout they're used to. If this gets implemented Beth would also need to create pacifist mode servers where no one can damage anyone else unless it was a consensual dual. You would also need character resets for both care bear and survival with no way to bring characters or gear between the two.
---
And this is why we can’t name weapons
---
Got to think though now its being monetized through ebay, the people that learn these new dupes aren't going t be as quick to share them with the world.
---
There's discord groups though where the duping is still rife. Bethesda know this as well.
---
Power armor frames definitely I have a bunch and can never get the right one
---
I wish they'd add the greenhouse walls and planters from 4. That would pretty much eliminate a lot of the need for defenses for me. I'd plant some rooftop gardens and delete my few turrets. 
---
Turrets aren't going to stop players who want to trash my base. But a rooftop garden would stop/severely slow trash mobs. 
---
On spawn points: train stations and/or red rocket stations would make fine spawn points. There are too many to spawn camp them. They are all over the map, so you can be quute close to wherever you want to go. But they are generally not close enough to make revenge spawns possible. The killer has time to escape.
---
I would rather they implement a buyout system for Workshops in the event of a pvp-disabled server. For example, player activates owned Workshop. Gives you the option to set a price to buy the Workshop from the owner. After three price rejections, you can no longer request, to prevent spam. 
---
They've already stated, specifically, characters will be able swap back and forth between modes. I doubt they'd create some kind of flag system for pre-survival release. 
---
Oh. It's been a while for me.
---
Can I give this post a gold down, like a shit gold or something
---
omg... None of that was true and it's been proven so. I can't believe all the people under this thread still worried about trade steal exploit. IT DOESN'T EXIST. Resume trading please. 
---
Which chem helps reduce weight? I need this info for my friend. Dude is always overemcumbered when he needs to fast travel.
---
Yeah sure. But then you could put whatever in the game and just say we play because we want to, and we don't have to complain about bugs, balance, emptiness...
---
why though?
---
I agree,
---
People that can't handle a PVP mode with has higher leveled and/or more experienced players should't play in the PVE world. It's really sad that the anti PVP whiners also want to decide how the PVP mode is going to work. 
---
 It's a post-apocalyptic wasteland , so it's kill or be killed without restrictions that cater the weak. 
---
um... becasue how are your going to offer or request from a blank screen... You have to choose what to offer/request first....
---
Let them fill up your Misc section?
---
This, so much this. I miss calling my guns Shooty McShootface, Snipey Pipey, and Pew Pew Pewpers. 
---
THIS.  Anything that AoE proc will hit friendly NPC and aggro them.
---
I had the Electrally Charged mutation and later played with having All mutations and I lost track of how many WS run I had ruined cause some mob wacks me while I am near a Robot and bam I now have 20 hostile robots.
---
IMO just not worth it.
---
I am not sure if PVP slap damage can set it of. would be a funny thing to see. You slap someone at WS while they are near a robot and see them run as the whole sever attacks them.

I've always wanted to kill someone in survival mode and pick up "420 l33t 69er gaess rifl". Joking aside... it's a solid idea a long as it includes PA frames.
---
Like the fallouts (and elder scrolls) before it; it’s very very easy to get wrapped up wandering or doing really anything that isn’t quest related. I’m 120 hours in, and still have quite a ways to go quest wise. Still quite content to walk around and help out newcomers.
---
Agreed! So many of these sets were in 4. Asking them to bring them to 76 is not unreasonable.
---
I thought you were offering the tips, ha. All I know how to do is find resource nodes and fit all of the crafting stations into a tent. I also know how to move your fast travel spawn point. That's about it
---
Pretty sure it isn't, because I tested this bug and posted the result before. Spoiler, at 240k damage I still couldnt 'one shot' people - 
---
https://youtu.be/aw4xomXVwpQ

uh, you know you can have a mic and 5.1 surround right?
---
Then maybe tbat should be announced by some sort of community spokesperson . . .
---
Fast travel. 
---
Good get out of here. This is the 4th identical post of this nature that's currently on the top page and it adds nothing of value since the entire conversation is dominated by dipshits that think everyone but them has a TSE ignoring all the other ways to get killed with a single shot. Duping caused problems but killing pvp wasn't one of them regardless of how this sub acts.
---
You know.... actually using the trade window might help with that...
---
That sounds cool, like a hardcore survival mode.
---
Yep, the anti-PVP whiners have lost their minds. Just stay in the PVE-worlds if you can't handle getting killed. I don't want to start a new character for this mode with the stupid reset per periode idea that some people on this sub have. 
---
I wan't to play as a raider without any restrictions. It's kill or be killed in a **post-apocalyptic wasteland.**
---
So don't play the pvp servers it's really an amazing solution
---
I think PvP need a better balance, but other than that I. Very happy with how its turned out. Obviously the bugs need worked out....but the game is pretty solid.
---
Pretty sure explosive weapons such as shotguns/rifles/handmades/pistols and other guns with that legendary modifier....don’t deal as much dmg any more after the update. Besides that, your calculations are great, but I’m fairly certain that the explosive dmg on top of ballistic doesn’t deal 100% dmg of a normal bullet. They were nerfed so that they don’t essentially deal double whatever the ballistic amount is through the explosive pellets/bullets. (Still great though)
---
Example: My explosive pipe rifle does 5 dmg. I shoot it at a radstag and the bullets explode. (Zooms in on irradiated deer) My pipe rifle is dealing 5 dmg of ballistic and some number less than 5 explosive in an area of effect. Not sure what the percentage has become that they decreased explosive by, but they did it in the last update I believe. Obviously the point of this was so it wouldn’t create destroyer of world status guns that dealt essentially double damage over an area and were made even more powerful through Demolition Expert. As a result, farming Whitesprings is not more difficult when all those ghouls rush out of the downstairs of that one building.
---
I use max Chem Fiend and Chem Resistant with BioComm armor mods. Psycho, psychobuff, overdrive, etc. lasts about 18 minutes, bufftats around 20, grape mentats for vendor hopping close to 30. It's rare to see me not using chems for one thing or another. The luck boost from Daytripper helps with Cap Collector activating, the high intelligence boost from berry mentats helps me craft better power armor and repairs, fusion cores I've made with 20+ intelligence have been over charged, reading 118 over 100. I could go on all day about chems. Ever since I made a chem popping cannibal in FO4, I refuse to make a character that didn't use chems.
---
Better light budgeting would make sense. I could be wrong, but annectdotally it seems like all lights take up the same value in my camp. A simple, static bulb takes up as much budget as the blinking xmas lights, animated stop sign or fish lamp, etc. That seems wrong. I understand why animated lights take up more budget, but plainer lights should take up less.
---
Honestly best advice is just loot everything and I mean everything and do that for a few hours and scrap and repeat and you will have plenty of resources to build what you need
---
I used to be in the the Navy, we had a decon shower and used to make the new guys run through it as an 'initiation'
---
It def isn't comfortable
---
That 5% is still larger then the &gt;1% of forum users that demand they be catered to... Oh wait here we are anyways in a forum...
---
Half the time watoga is full of lvl 14-34 mobs not counting the mobs that are always lvl 1 and 8 lol.
---
We need a legit high level area, with nothing spawning under lvl 100.
---
Not really. The changes they announced would make the new mode dead on arrival. Look at the 3 treads at the top of the sub all calling for them to make it a “clean slate” type server. All make extreme amounts of sense. They would’ve fucked it up much like they’ve fucked things up early on. 
---
Because what do they want of me? I havent said they can have something I am using so why trade? Its nothing more than obnoxious nagging to me
---
This is listed in the BethesdayPlz Wiki - https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/bethesdaplz

Along with the power armor rename.

Yes please. Have the name be only visible to you and it gets wiped when someone else picks the item up.

Bring it on lol. You better be prepared 😎
---
Ok thanks

Still playing that Server Hop fest? 
---
I'm done of playing that Hamster Wheel with no rewards. Was fun while it lastet.

I did not even powerplay this, but finished in about 2 months.
---
Why should i farm mats to craft Ammo to shoot weak enemies which give no reward. And their loot can only be dropped, since you visited the 7 Vendors already aka pointless loot.
---
Got perks for 2 Builds, got Camp with Legendary 3\* Spawn, water and vegetables. I did my rebuild Appalachia part.
---
And don't come up with that new PVP Mode, we lived 25years in the Vault together to instantly kill us when the Door opens? Leave me alone with that. 
---
Make this a new post, we need more people to see this!
---
Thanks, wasn't sure what to search under with Reddit.
---
This sounds awesome and non-grindy, so it won't be implemented.
---
One could argue all these self proclaimed "pvpers" who are against this don't want fair pvp but rather to just shit on people that are lower leveled with even less restrictions nthen adventure mode. In my opinion there should be resets and seasons just like literally every other pvp game in existence. It keeps it fresh and makes it even more competitive too race to the top rather the the same few dominating day 1 untouched for the rest of the games life span. Yes, people will always be ahead who play more but not everyone started the game on launch and just because they didn't they should have a fair shot each season if they want to go all in and commit to the grind.
---
&gt; I hope for your sake that nobody you love does get cancer, but if they do, you will finally understand quite how toxic and nasty you have been to other people.

Jesus Christ dude, no decent human being even mentions something like that. You may as well say "I hope your sister never gets raped, but if she does, I hope you'll be a better person because of it". You can't make that sound NOT ROYALLY FUCKED UP. You're not directly saying it, but you're basically insinuating that you wish the people we love dead, all because a few people disagree with you and don't appreciate your immediate, hostile, and insulting responses to our comments. That's the kind of comment that can get you fired from your job. That's the kind of shit you hear from an abusive spouse.
---
I don't give a shit that you're even insulting people, but you're doing it while it's completely unwarranted, and now you're wishing death to random people... get some fucking help.

May the people you know and love live long and happy lives, and may you grow into a decent human being as well.

Get some help.

I quit trading with anyone higher level than me. People were checking my weapons to make sure theyre tougher than me and then killing me. And I must not be the only one because I can't even get lower levels to trade me now. They always just run away. So I've resorted to dumping a bag at thier camps but even that doesn't always work. Sometimes the bag falls through the world or they'll fast travel away or leave the world. We REALLY need a better way to do this. Todd wanted us all to work together, here we are trying..... 
---
Like I'm not gonna grief the lowest levels I can to increase the salt I owe back this game?
---
Brilliant write up, thanks for taking the time to clearly express your opinion on how to improve this game. I agree with all of this feedback. I have since stopped playing this game but if these changes were made I would 100% return. This game has so much potential but its so plagued by the problems mentioned above that it just isn't worth my time. 
---
I'm gonna keep watching this game because I know it's one I could get lost in but until some serious improvements are made (the ones you stated would be enough) I'd return in a heartbeat. 
---
Strongly agree with this, so many bad things can happen with current characters in the new mode
---
So you're saying I don't get DR protection for my head because care bears want people to see their haircut... and I might add; in a game about rebuilding America after the apocalypse with flying, explosion vomiting bats. ;)

If you search " I made a visual catalog of C.A.M.P." you will find the original post by the "God" who created the list.  It's on this subreddit.  The imgur link is:

She is definetely worth every invite she gets.
---
I am amazed at what people carry. 
---
I agree this game brings out the OCD collector in people and without any real means to store 1000s of lbs of collected and legitimately obtained weapons, armors and "stuff" people in fact walk around always over encumbered.
---
Do they NEED all that stuff, off course not! But why have so many great collectibles and then punish people who collect...it is a bit of a kick in the shin.
---
I thought the game was already on survival mode?
---
Its a common phrase down in the south, so no. You must have a pretty nice life yourself to be difg2ing that hard for a way to troll strangers on the internet. 
---
I remember my first mmorpg, Asheron's Call. I started on the pvp server about a year after the game launched. Every time I died, I dropped my armor, I don't remember if I dropped my weapon, but I don't think so. There was one 2 piece set of armor that did not drop upon death. By the time I started, you couldn't get it anymore. Talk about total unfairness. I still played to max level 126. I lost some gear, but I kept my best gear locked up in my apartment. I only wore what I had duplicates of, and not by duplicating, by trading or mainly just grinding and grinding. 
---
When I swapped to WoW, I played a pve server, and played a lot of battlegrounds. I made it to knight-lieutenant before they cut off the battleground ranking titles. I loved pvp, and I sucked at it. The main reason was that I didn't care about having pvp gearing, I only cared about being ready for raids. If there was a setup similar to that, I would be all over it. 
---
Sorry for the novel, was just kind of reminiscent of the glory days of mmorpgs. 
---
It also seems to me that every time I log in my character is thirsty despite filling up before logging off prior. As a force of habit you hit that Pipboy just to have it freeze.
---
I just timed it this morning. Roughly around 2 minutes from when you hit PLAY to when you can actually move properly in the game. This is without a bomb and during low traffic on the servers.
---
When the vanilla game says no, modders say yes.

I'm sure the actual game devs could come up with something similar for 76.
---
Man that’s fucking screwed up, it will get me sprunged if Bethesda does not implement this.
---
It worked for me 
---
I hope they do follow our suggestions because this is most likely to be the game mode to save fallout 76 and keep the game going.
---
I love this comment, it’s not even sad it’s so true.
---
I don't care what you all do over there. Just quit nerfing weapons and armor for non PvP players.
---
And it was in this moment he realized he was old.
---
Yes, the lack of PER/CHR on glasses really threw me for a loop at first.  I thought I must be missing something.
---
Where on the stair?
---
Super rare indeed. I have server hopped and check that store religiously and in the 300-500 times I have looked never seen it. Had to trade Calibrated shocks to get mine.
---
I would be pissed mate.
---
Friend, I'm not a duper- however I'll happily admit that I got the bobbleheads to test this from a duper. Also, there is a bug with the workshop PvP mechanic.  I made a post but it didn't gain any momentum - 
---
https://youtu.be/RIZwk-_FfuA
---
Explosive should be a Primary effect.
---
Invite?
---
The leaderboard's a great way to see who the top cheaters and dupers are!
---
Please do not implement exactly what they are saying here, it is a horrible 1 track minded way of balancing it. Make it so that we can import character level, perk cards, and quest progress but NOT items. Totally disallowing transferring characters in any way has no compromise for people that want to at least bring over their character level,etc. The reddit community is small but vocal and the other millions of players that don't complain on reddit every day will actually want progress to carry over in some form.
---
That actually sounds fun. Makes crafting worthwhile too.
---
I wouldn't say it is just this game, toxicity seems to be more of a problem with PC gaming in general.
---
&gt; She is definetely worth every invite she gets.
---
What do you mean by this.
---
Wait. How to you give things to your alts? 
---
You are correct and coming from a programmer, this would take less then a week of dev time. I'm not a game programmer but I learned about it school and know roughly what would need to be done and it's something a student could've worked on lol.
---
One sec I’ll reply
---
This exactly... and anytime I have looked at the trade interface, I just get confused...   This is with my wife and we are in the same room both going... well fuk just put it in that container and we will swap.
---
They are for me
---
&gt; We'd lose money between each other.
---
You lose money either way. Whether you get the bounty for griefing a PvEer or killing each other, you're still going to lose caps. You're acquiring bounties that are hundreds of caps for leveling base, right? How are you getting around that...unless you're just bullshitting us here about your PvP and clan of 30 players...
---
I say +5% for each mutation you have up to a max +25%. this would be in line with a TS post nerf.
---
There are no defensive ones, just fyi
---
Ah must have been a spell check change i didn't notice as i was rushing.  Thanks for pointing it out.  Should have been up vote 
---
I assume it is just changing some 1s to 0s or enabled to disabled? The only thing I assume takes any significant work is adding a button in the main menu. 
---
I don't believe this, since the slap damage for me was the same at 240k as it was at 20k. 
---
Whether you're talking about duped ones or not, they exist, and thus MUST be addressed and not ignored.
---
200+ hours, the same. No idea how this trade interface is supposed to work. I tired it once in the beginning and was utterly confused. How am I supposed to see whats offered, where is a cap balance of trades agreed upon, and so on. That whole thing is a mess.
---
And thrust issues. I've read people telling me you get robbed in the trade interface, I've read that is not true and blown out of proposrtions. After that I read "yes it is true and I can proove it".  
---
Absolutely no trust in trading with anyone, unless I get an interface where only items I marked for trade show up and nothing more and I have an overview over how much caps are offered.
---
Problem is it forces people to get every mutation but a lot of them has negative effects that negate strength or lower the potential of your build.
---
I agree with this guy until this contention as well...my myself and especially my buddy(as I run empath for him) are neigh unkillable with Max explosive resist, he has full sentinel/assassin I have almost full cav/assassin. Plus all relevant perks of course. Against non bobble head users I power through multiple people shooting me with their TSEs but then other times I will get one shot not downed but instakilled by a bobblehead boosted explosive. Very frustrating. When my buddy gets killed usually it's always a bobblehead glitcher. We ran LFGs on his 4500 cap bounty last night no one could kill him
---
The point is what sport is there to just hunting down noobs?
---
Ahh, k was confused for a moment.
---
My bad, in that case i full agree that they beed to either limit the stacking or to reduce the timer and deffo patch the timer resetting 
---
Dropped unwanted junk on the ground and later found my Ski Sword 40% higher swing was gone, this does seem to happen if you drop junk immediately after fighting, the equipped weapon gets dropped also. 
---
It's not that simple. This is time and money that could go to pve development. 
---
Fragmentation Grenade MIRV no longer spreads its bomblets over a wide area anymore. They all just explode in the initial location. 
---
I think I have killed 2 people since launch and 200 hours played and they were all to get rid of someone's bounty
---
Uranium fever event will be a nice one that keeps the coming. It is at the mine by Whitesprings
---
I may be wrong but I believe they will be adding in a scaling system so hopefully that works and enables a level 10 to take out a lvl100 
---
Ditto... it's sitting in my stash to pretty to eat.
---
"If I don't get my account back for being banned I'm gonna demand a refund"
---
Lol good luck with that,You aren't going to get a refund when you've been banned for supposed cheating.What are you gonna do? Pay a lawyer $20,000 to fight them in court to get your $60 back? Lol.
---
At least another year.
---
And a new engine.
---
Now it’s time to lead the capsule if you da-a-a-are
---
Right there. A little mouse with clogs on.
---
\+karma for moist
---
Quit yer bitchin. I dont have tse and im wrecking kids in pvp. I think your problem may just be a lack of gooders
---
Don't forget Gorge Junkyard workshop. It has a BT deposit that you can put a extractor on. It is between Vault 76 and Morgantown
---
Yea sorry I was when I read it after you pointed it out.  I was keen to get the original post noticed and rushing to much.  Thanks again👍
---
Gun handling and shooting in this game lag behind even FO4 somehow...not sure why that is, but it is pretty bad. And they want to play that up with a pvp focus?
---
Clearly Bethesda suits think more highly of their engine and tech than most gamers do.
---
Woah. Hostile much?
---
Game just needs direction. It's trying to do several things at a time, but does none of it well so it's an overall bad experience.
---
We are looking at anthem maybe
---
That's because it's environmental damage not them shooting you directly 
---
With an online store charging Gucci prices but delivering Primark/Walmart quality...
---
The same people are crying and complaining when their workshop is taken by someone else and they get killed. Plus the TSE issue is overblown, it's a complete lie those weapons are still rare and most player don't even bother to trade to get those.
---
I watched her body hit the ground and just disappear, spent almost and hour trying to find her body. Never did.
---
That would be great!
---
You know what, you might really be on to something with this one.
---
It happened to me too.  I spent caps to fast travel and no event. I stayed and figured out how to use those SAMs and killed two scorchbeasts though.
---
That can't really be it, can it? I see plenty of people playing with i5s, and lower-end video cards, and they're not seeing this behavior. 
---
I'll admit I might be in a little bit of denial, because I see how much it'll cost for me to upgrade to a 9th-gen i7 :-/
---
what are u on, if youre on xbox I can make you one and give it to you if I have the parts
---
This is solid information brother, thanks for sharing with the community!
---
You do know they said there will be more Single player fallout games, right?
---
I want a sortable list. It's easier for me to have them listed in the order I got them. Many times I'll grab one and plan to go back to listen and have no idea which one I just picked up.
---
This right here 👆
---
No, thank you, and I agree they do deserve all the up votes they can get. Now I know before I buy. No more wasted caps.
---
my contract is with playstation as I purchased via the store. So if I can't use it then playstation should refund and take it up with Bethesda. And you're wrong btw, never mentions suspected cheating. All I've used to play this game is my ps4 pad
---
If you're not a gamer, how on earth do you expect to make games?
---
nonono.
---
let's take my 10mm SMG:
---
[https://imgur.com/a/sqToVNe](https://imgur.com/a/sqToVNe)
---
no perks, no buffs. same 1:1 modifications. Vanilla level 50 hardened 10mm SMG does 42 damage. Explosive variant does 84. Nicely 100% added
---
Now, lets add 3\* 1 level commando (10 per card aka 30% damage bonus
---
[https://imgur.com/a/u6XP7d5](https://imgur.com/a/u6XP7d5)
---
now, non-explo damage rose to 55 dmg (42\*1,3=54,6 aka 55 rounded) and Explo is nicely 100 dmg
---
Now, lets add 1\* level 5 Demo Expert
---
[https://imgur.com/a/aErXKMF](https://imgur.com/a/aErXKMF)
---
non-explo is still 55 ofc, but explosive one has risen to 165 damage. aka 55+55\*2=162
---
here you go. sheet damage
---
This was before the patch, even before the workshop patch where they decreased FC production to some trivial amount. 
---
These “Bethesda, [dipshit complaint]”  posts need to stop. You’re an intelligent person, scroll through the list you don’t need alphabetical order 
---
Ya literally all of this could have been avoided had explosive just been made a primary perk but I mean did the devs not play the game? Even unmodded TSEs have the highest overall damage output. How did they not know people would complain considering they complain about everything in this game 
---
Nah when we get someone who wishes to fight and we win enough it can be more profitable then we lose as an individual player. So its a balancing act to break even or profit. Once you get the hang of it it can turn a decent profit.  
---
I did the same, it made life so much easier. I had a 2 character sorting method, first character was designated to a specific loadout, second character was where I wanted that weapon in the loadout order. Then I'd name it something stupid, like my Shishkebab named Fuckbringer.
---
I like this idea.  Seems like a great middle ground, win win!
---
Thank you! I struggled for ammo until this was shared to me, so I wanted to pass it forward
---
I'm one of those care bears that you speak of, and I want my brain pan protected. Hell even if we could get a 1 dr minimum out of any head cover found in game that would be better than nothing. They can easily make it so that certain types of head covers are cosmetic as to go over the armor, especially anything from the atom store. Helmets and other obvious protective headgear can actually maybe stop that tse round so that you don't die. 
---
Why would you want to do that though? My buddies and I set ours apart across the map for free travel to most advantageous parts of the map.
---
Dinner buddy. Dinner. Full of oats and eggs! Perfect for hauling insane amounts of tin cans and garden gnomes across the wasteland. 
---
Bigly if true
---
Right but I’m asking why even be area of effect?
---
A: That's now how upvotes/downvotes work. They're not a marker of truth, they're a marker of agreement, and at the time of me writing this you're at a 74% Upvoted ratio. Additionally, that's only for people who browse the sub and decided to vote. Even if we decide that this sub is representative of the overall Fallout 76 Population, that's still not 90%. 
---
B: I'm not actually arguing against your overall point, it's silly to bring up at all. Before 76, you could also say "Fallout has always been a single player game". Things change. If they didn't, we'd still be playing an isometric wasteland RPG.
---
C: This one's just in general, but you can't must make some wild claim and then be like "I'm right until you disprove me". You need to provide supporting evidence, preferably beyond just "well, I've spent tons of time with it and everyone I've met agrees." I could just as easily claim I've spent 800 hours in Fallout 76 and hundreds +1 player encounters and found the exact opposite of you. It's meaningless without real evidence. Hell, if you'd even made a [straw poll](https://www.strawpoll.me/), posted it to this sub and used results form that, it'd be better than this. 
---
At this point, the only way to make it fair is for the new PvP server to be a fresh start.  Make success based on who actually can survive from Day 1, not those who stocked up on everything they needed in carebear land before jumping over.  
---
If you're really into this, leveling a new character on the survival server should be a fun and amazing experience, a reward all its own. But if on Day 1, people are logging in only to be one shot VATS critted by high level players who already have impressive gear...the game mode will whither and die pretty quickly.
---
It's like they specifically made perks descriptions so vague to enable ninja fixes.
---
Yup! In fact, New Reno has it's own miniature porn industry and in Fallout 2 you can actually become a porn star by featuring in one of their productions.
---
It is that simple. If it upsets you so much quit bitching about something you probably would've avoided and do literally anything else with your time. You what I do when I don't like something I vote with my time and dollars and save everyone the bleeding ears
---
I don't hate it as much as I feel bad for outright ignoring them.  It feels like I am being rude.
---
From what I’ve heard, there is constant pvp, you drop things aside from junk on death, and a leaderboard.
---
It's to stop you from accidentally shooting / hitting / attacking someone by accident and flagging for PVP. 
---
Its the worst sort of solution to a problem that didn't really exist. People were up in arms just before launch that there was no PVE servers so Bethesda wanted to paint over the cracks to try and bolster sales.
---
The new Survival mode that's coming will probably be more like the actual vision Bethesda had for the game pre launch. By giving us all this though they allowed themselves to still benefit from launch monies whilst hopefully working on and making the actual survival mode bug free for a good solid launch!
---
Defs patch the timer reset and they fact they stack, both of which are silly and seem more like bugs to me.
---
But I personally like the long timer on them, just because they weigh so much and it's rare to find one useful to a build out in nature (instead of buying them). Because of those I want to get a nice long bonus from them, enough to go play through a quest or explore an area without totally rushing to get the most from the timer.
---
Maybe they could scale back the dmg ones to +10% instead of +20%? But gaining +1 AGI or INT is pretty minor so having it for a while feels fair to me. And that's what bobbleheads feel like they're supposed to be now, a small but long term bonus that's harder to find. Whereas chems are bigger buffs, with very short timers, and are easily found/made. So having the two be so different feels like a nice balance.
---
And it hurt my brain. There's nothing easier than create flags for each character, and certain milestones flip those flags up. Then, whenever achievements are changed or introduced, the character would get polled, these flags can be examined, and achivements can be applied retroactively. So when they said that certain things won't be unlocked retroactively, that was them figuratively jumping on the table, ripping their clothes off and yelling "I AM BAD AT MY JOB!" Because a nutless monkey could do this properly. 
---
It will still work, the only thing that changes is the name will change to Action Boy
---
Its totally irrelevant as it all goes into a pool rather than protecting the location its on? ;)
---
Armour is just divided between one less location on non-pa but instead receives massive bonuses. Really nothing to cry about as pa is really weak compared to the legendary armour you transition to later. The only place I ever use PA nowadays is when levelling a new character or in a nuke zone.
---
I really doubt that...or it's a gross exaggeration. 
---
Perfect explanation, thanks for the info! 
---
It's good that we're on the same page... ballistic protection for our noggins is a must. Lets face facts... if FO76 we're real it would be a bad hair Olympics. Also, power armor would smell like hockey equipment and give you a rash.
---
yes technically its fine to have full loot games if the gear isn't such a big deal. for example if fallout had 0 legendaries, they could potentially make it a full loot game on the pvp servers if they really wanted to and it wouldn't be "broken"
---
Yes, it’ll still work. Perk name will change to Action Boy. 
---
I agree 100% Holo tapes should be either their own sliders or put with the radio or voice slider. Also most holo tapes for me at least seem to be quiet even with max.volumr
---
The name of the perk card will change to action boy, and the picture on the card will turn to the vault boy, but as far as perks go they're the same
---
Hey if only you had a gas mask easily available for non pa users? ;)
---
i think trading should be in a stationary hub
---
like you and the guy how u want to trade with should go train-station for example and there will be a 2 panels you both stands on each one and see what the other have or offering to sell, that will be much convenient and easy to do instead of random location while everything is trying to kill everything.
---
Remembering the mid-90s does not make one "old".
---
That's why you go under the ground Giuseppe
---
If it was removed but you could still use the train stations to fast travel that would be cool
---
No, and the FortNite comparisons are really confusing. The new PVP mode is just the same game as always with PVP turned on permanently, and some more rewards/consequences for engaging in PVP. There's nothing Battle Royale about it.
---
If there was a rule against reposting basic elements that should've been in the game at launch this sub would be dead.
---
I still feel the game is worth it if you're a Fallout Fan. My friend and I usually team up and have run across more good people than asshats. The odds of coming across a griefer is low, and you can always use Block For Session to keep them from seeing you on the map then fast travel away to lose them, or server hop.
---
This isn't bad for Bethesda's first attempt at a multiplayer FO. But I do agree the PVP is bad. I chuckle at people saying a Bethesda game is buggy *remembers all the Skyrim bugs but people still say it's a great game*
---
There is no need to reinvent the wheel/overcomplicate a system (cough pvp cough) and break the gameplay further. Just have the points be reallocated all at once and have it cost caps. Easy, can't go wrong and it's a proven concept with other games. 
---
If you are some old school rper who doesn't want to respec, don't use the respec. If you messed up with your build, you can pay caps and redo it without of having to waste time and grind at white springs to reallocate one point at a time.
---
too bad adblock could die on chrome soon
---
There certainly are a lot of thought pieces proclaiming to be representative without any specific references to how that conclusion was reached. 
---
A sub on Reddit is a niche representation of the player base and should not be considered undeniable fact. The nature of being on this sub biases you almost unavoidably before you even start. More people play this game casually and they, like me, may well enjoy how daft the shish kebab is, or the ski sword, ripper etc. 
---
Are they apex weapons for delivering damage? No. But they are very “Fallout” and useful for boshing lower level things. 
---
What does RS or R3 even mean?
---
Meh.  If they pull it off, cool.  I have no urge to rush into it.  All the griefers and trolls can port there.  Leaderboards, meh.  Theres not much urge for me to rush into it.  Survival, battle royale, meh.
---
Craft like 10 at an armor bench and scrap them to learn mods
---
Build one, scrap it. Repeat. 
---
Oh, I thought that you didn’t learn mods from your own crafted stuff. Cool.
---
Generally there seems to be more call for PVE than PVP in most games of this ilk. They should just let us host ouyr own servers, no limits on basebuilding or stash sizes.
---
They're all over PVP right now because it's cheap to make. FO76 has been nothing but a cash grab - just look at their ripoff online store and their ripoff christmas sale - what kind of an asshole tries to rip you off, let alone at Christmas.
---
Only way to get mods is to scrap them. Sometimes the vendors will have mod plans but those are for a couple of them only. I'd recommend getting Super Duper rank 3 then go on a farming spree. You'll get lucky and get 2 Lever Actions for one craft. Profit! 
---
As for where to find materials, wood can be found at the Gilman Lumber Mill south from Vault 76.
---
Concrete can be found sitting near the front of the Summerville Docks.
---
The only places I've found copper, gold, and crystal is at workshops. You have to claim it to make Extractors to get more from it. 
---
There's a huge iron deposit at Garrahan Mining Headquarters at the bottom where you go to register your Excavator PA. (With the Excavator PA you can get up to 250 steel.
---
Acid is found at the Hemlock Holes Maintenance workshop. You have to claim it to make Extractors to get more from it. (Acid is important to smelt ores)
---
Adhesive can be found on Anglers found mostly at Gnarled Shallows. 
---
Ceramic can be found in all of the vases inside of The Whitesprings Resort.
---
If you need anything else I can probably help find an answer, I've learned a lot from this community and I've also asked a lot of questions on where to find materials that always seem to run low.
---
I'm making them and scrapping them.  But now I'm out of screws so it's time to go farming.
---
Gottcha, dmg will be decreased but will still benefit from perks
---
Just a note: Ultracite Jet Pack does NOT exist.
---
Or have us go back to Modus or whoever cares and hand the quest in to claim rewards! Hell have a vendor and give us a currency from SQB kills to choose what we want!
---
Its not rocket science, its just needs a few good dev's to step and grab 76 by the horns and get it fixed
---
Fanboys. 
---
Fanboys never change. 
---
Well guess i'll have to get the boys together and get a recording made. 
---
The key is finding people of high lvl because usually they have caps. If you can keep winning the engagements you get caps. Pretty simple. 
---
Yup, AND please put Survival mode on different servers totally seperate and apart from Adventure mode servers with no connection so that when the dupers do their thing they'll only crash Survival mode servers, until we're certain that bug has been squashed, many thanks.
---
Blood for the blood god!, skulls for khornes throne!
---
Yes I get your reference, I prefere tzeentch myself

I have an AMD Ryzen 5 2600X. Amazon says it has 6 cores and 12 threads, would this help me with anything?
---
i remember when i played fallout 2 for the first time, and i thought being a fluffer was the funniest shit XD by far the best game in the series 
---
If survival mode is *only* for brand new characters, then that doesn't matter.
---
use line breaks
---
I want to rebuild the railway elevator, that's all
---
I have like 2 players with 15 perception. And I really don't use vats that much. i'd kinda like the investment to pay off beyond sniping power.
---
YOU ARE A PROPHET OF ATOM!
---
It's better. I used to wait for 5or 6 seconds while scrapping all junk since they "fixe" duping I can move immediately.
---
First time it was so smooth I was taken aback.  
---
But don't caps come from the person's personal inventory?  How would they farm caps if they are just splitting existing caps between each other?
---
Cool thanks. I was just under the assumption that you didn’t get mods from scrapping your own crafted stuff. I had tried it earlier with my radium rifle and I got nothing after scrapping like 6. 
---
$9 virtual skin btw.
---
I think it was FONV you could chili your nuka colas and get a better effects out of them. I would like that function back, it was great.
---
Sadly, you're lying, if you go to the stats tab, then go to special and hover over intelligence, it will say "it also affects the durability of items you craft" and also, I wasn't talking about resistance 
---
I hate that too! I wasted time and materials to make a sentry bot helmet under the assumption that it would actually function only for it to be completely useless. 
---
Ah. That's a bit of an issue, as I am actually a PC player.
---
Okay this game took a lot of flak. Seems not everyone hatez it. 
---
I always laugh at these types of threads, as if we can just go to a weapons shop and buy these OP items, RNG says it ain't possible, it's luck only luck or duping.
---
Its pretty, but sadly even though its the highest teir of walls they arent super strong. Take maybe 3 swings and id be in
---
Everyone else here is correct: craft them and scrap them, and Super Duper helps. 
---
Important to note: you can craft the lowest level version to cut down on the material costs.
---
I'm just going to wait until after the patch drops and everyone's complaining about how OP bloodied + explosive/50% VATs Crit damage, bloodied + less VATs AP cost, or bloodied + 40% swing speed is. It's not like nerfing this balances the game whatsoever. The game is incredibly unbalanced and I'm just going to re-spec wherever the scales are tipped. 
---
Even post-TSE nerf, you can take a scorchbeast out of the air in less than a second, kill the queen in less than 5 minutes, or whatever. The issue isn't TSE, it's that TSE is an easily viable build with few drawbacks and other builds aren't as optimized or suffer from drawbacks (IE: a VATs crit rifleman has to deal with weapon weight, etc).
---
While I kinda see everyone's point if view of forcing you to start fresh, in the end it would make it worse. After a few weeks, the Survival servers would be filled up with OP high lvls anyways and anyone late to the game would get owned. 
---
Why would they keep fighting a group of 4 long enough to make it profitable? At 10 caps a kill, that's peanuts...But yeah, go make a video. I'd love to see it.
---
Unless you're building a giant fortress, building a CAMP doesn't really tax one's resources too much. Follow the overseers quest through the airport stuff and you'll have plenty of plans for workbenches and basic needs. Claiming a workshop is also an easy source of CAMP-related plans. Take one, set up turrets, and you can basically just hide in the area and let the turrets defend it. Once you get the rewards, you can simply log out and log back in if you don't want to get caught up in possible PvP. 
---
Also, go down to the homestead across the river south of flatwoods, and grab a bunch of corn, tatos, whatever. You'll need fertilizer, but if you plant a bunch of corn, you can craft corn soup, which really is an easy, endless source of food and water.
---
That would ruin chameleon builds
---
Anti armor Western revolver. I switched from gunslinger to unarmed, but pistols are still my backup. With no pistol perks at all, I can still kill most things in one or two hits, and even a scorchbeast goes down without too much trouble.
---
Also have a bloodied prime .44 that melts scoechbeasts, when I can get the ammo for it.
---
Personally I have my camp on a lead deposit instead of acid, because Steel &amp; Gunpowder are usually easier for me to find. Although hitting gyms for lead runs can be a great substitute (Green Country Lodge, Charleston FD, etc.)
---
Another good tip for getting both lead and steel, Tin Can traps. The Penitentiary, the Ski Resort at Top of the World, and several other places have loads of these traps hung and you can get decent amount of steel/lead from the cans 👍
---
Ok check that other reply.
---
I do a fair amount of distant thunder. I don’t use the HUD but on my other char, I do use a recon scope. Same thing maybe?
---
You are correct, sorry someone downvoted you for saying that. 
---
“Training”
---
I have almost 400 hours in game, I have no idea how to trade. 
---
Makes sense, I was just asking cause I had tried this earlier building a 5-6 radium rifles to try to learn mods for that, and got Nothing. So I was just assuming you couldn’t learn mods from scrapping your own crafted stuff. I must have just gotten unlucky 
---
Ain’t that a kick in the head?
---
That's the method I used for the handmade gun. You may end up needing to scrap more to unlock all the mods. Oddly, once I got the handmade plan I started having them drop from scortched in the game but that could be because I was venturing into new parts of the map.
---
Although i am not in charge of it in my current position it is not blocked..... IT guys all share the same sensibility lol
---
This isn't cashing in on Fortnite or PUBG at all, if it did it would've been a Battle Royale.This is just something for the people itching for fights, while they're a minority at the moment it's not out of the question more people will want to try the PVP out when these new servers come available. So long as they don't let us port over characters it'll be great
---
How is it any different? You would just delay how it is with current characters. It doesnt take that long to get to lv 40-50 and have some legendaries. It would be the exact same with "new character required" as it is with current characters in a matter of days. 
---
I'm upset that we haven't even gotten an acknowledgement from Bethesda on here about this. This thread has been posted several times and I never get tired of seeing it. 
---
I want my weapon names to not be a mile long. 
---
Not every mutation just 5. If you take marsupial, speed demon, Carnivore/herbivore, grounded and either eagle eyes or twisted muscles you are done and get max benefit.
---
I believe metal walls are the highest tier actually. Also I'm aware lol. Most workshop objects don't take much time to break with any good melee weapon.
---
Either way, I'm the real defense for my CAMP anywho :P. 
---
Your still gonna have the problem of players having better equipment than others.  Wiping just gives some of you a false sense of fairness.  It’s not like they would get rid of legendaries. It’s not like everyone will spend equal time playing survival.
---
Why not try the beta before you come up with terrible ideas to improve a game mode you obviously won’t play.
---
thumbs down emote, then move on...
---
Not sure why you are getting downvotes.  This is actually pretty Swass.  :)
---
Agreed. I'm ready for new content. Nukes are fun, but I can launch one I'm about 25 minutes of game play faster with friends. I need more areas to see and things to do. If they took out PvP all together I wouldn't give to shits. To me fallout 76 is exploring, looting, and having a good time with friends.
---
Thats a greatly explained mechanic, Thanks you so much for this detailed info! Great work!
---
You're still right though on the crafting part, look at the cost of say 5mm to fuel, with ammo Smith you get I think 180 rounds per batch and it's cheap in comparison and far easier to get the materials. Between mama doclhes(spelt that all sorts of wrong) and the little China bots outside of 76 I never have steel and lead worries.
---
There’s a leaderboard 
---
I just ignore and wander off
---
we have emotes you know...
---
Nah when they have enough money and everyone is seeking revenge and you kill them multiple times it takes a portion of their money and hands it off to the team that kills them.
---
Some times a good kill will give 100 to 200 caps to each person. That just shows how little you've pvped. 
---
Your earnings scale to an extent
---
Survival Mode is just hardcore mode in Diablo... There is already a system for how this should work... just copy that.
---
Try logging off and back on. I initially couldn't use some of the flooring I got off the shop. Quick log off fixed it.
---
Lemme FTFY: **Hey Bethesda, why don't you disable Survival mode?**
---
They should add a timer to everything they say soon to so we know when. simple timer for events in game already shouldn't be something to announce in the into the vaults it should just be done. 
---
This is fallout and Bethesda, not some small indie title. Stuff like this basic QoL change shouldn't be considered upcoming dlc / content.
---
I literally know none of the above. Please spill the beans!
---
I meant I have caps to trade for what’s listed above 
---
I miss you, Nick Valentine. 
---
And not have leaderboards. A R E u kidding me or are u SERIOUS me??
---
"correct" 😂⚓
---
I know this is going to be a rubbish comparison but is there a way I can create a chest to store all of the scrapped loot?
---
Thanks for the replys my dude. I had tried this earlier with my radium rifle plans, and after scrapping 6 of them I didn’t learn any mods at all. So I was just assuming that it didn’t work that way. I guess I just got unlucky. 
---
I was pretty heated when I initially wrote the post and kind of hammered it out without proofing it at all.  
---
I do want pvp, just not in the games current state.  I've had a few fights with other players but it mostly turns into a can i get to melee and hit you before you hit me.   I'd love to have a discussion on how to make it a more thought out pvp experience, but right now there are only 2 streams of thought that are valid in my mind.  
---
1. Completely separate pvp and non pvp players, re-rolling a new character for the pvp mode
---
2. give players an incentive other than pvp to go to the survival world.  If I'm farming for legendaries, even as someone who wants to pvp, I'd rather do so in the non-pvp realm then flip to pvp realm when I just want to hunt people down, the problem I see with that is there will be too many hunters and not enough prey.  While being preyed upon might not sound fun, when the rewards for being in a pvp realm are higher people will naturally lean towards pvp realm to "min-max" their efforts which leads to all kinds of crazy stuff happening.  Being ambushed by someone only to call in your buddy and make a great story about how you fought off the hunter.  Bad beats will happen too, but it's all in creating stories which will cause people to talk about the game outside of the game.
---
Liberty Prime: Don't move
---
The Core issue with this game is Respect, and the lack of it for the player from the developers. They dont respect your time, your money or your intelligence. 
---
Until whomever is running this shitshow can get that through the rest of their depts skulls, we're gonna be having a bad time. I've got money i want to spend, but I'm not going to do it here, not for this disrespectful market. 
---
Grass shouldn't clip through your floors, and you shouldn't need to raise the foundation 6 feet off the ground to prevent that. That's my biggest pet peeve when building.
---
I used to have mine on Lead Deposits too, but I still needed the acid to smelt it so I switched to Acid Deposit. One run through Lucky Hole Mine gives me all the lead I need and mining is therapeutic for me since it doesn't require much thinking to mine ore lol.
---
I'm glad you mentioned the Tin Cans, those are great for those who can't or don't want to mine, or those who want to add to your supply to reduce the amount you need to mine, thanks!
---
People just assume mate. All will turn out well 
---
It does have an element of randomness to it. It took me forever to get the spikes for the fire axe.
---
Yeah pretty much. Its mostly how Fortnite rolls. The biggest issue with it IMO is that this is a very popular f2p tactic being used in a game you have to buy. Some paid $80, some paid $30, I paid $60. It is possible to adapt this system to work,  but not with these crazy prices. 
---
Bethesda, see the fantastic work done by u/Aten_Ra \- please get the fix applied!
---
When you level up, you pick the stat first, then the perk cards.
---
What most likely happened was you picked a stat by accident then scrolled over to the Agility section for the perk
---
Pros:
---
* Not getting your face caved in by a All Rise as soon as you exit the vault.
---
Id love to see your sources for the manufacturing cost of these items. Also Bethesda has officially commented there is no truth to the f2p rumors.
---
Awww thanks. You're awesome. 
---
Why?  You only need one piece anyway.
---
Yes I agree with that but it will be full of legit OP high level players instead of dupe/bobble head exploiters that is IF Bethesda closes off all current exploits if a fresh start is done.
---
Whilst anyone being late into starting survival they'd survive more with legit OP players than dealing with those exploiters
---
you're fucking stupid, this market is clearly set up to try to pull recurring payments from players who invest large amounts of time in this world. Not just make a simple one time purchase! 
---
this is an online only game and if there are no people you've got no content. You're an idiot.
---
Yes please
---
Dude, thank you so much!
---
That literally helps me out so fucking much its unreal. I normally hate asking for help from people online, normally like finding things out by myself. But this game is a lot to take in!
---
This isn’t Fallout 5 and was never intended to be. 
---
It was brought up before in another post, that with current greifing of people with stacked bobble head TSE and the assassin/sentinel armor there would be even more greifing in nuke zones like.
---
....or it will have no significant barriers to entry, so Players will still be able to hop in and out of it months down the line without having to start fresh, thus keeping it alive much easier...
---
I mean, I would be ok with that but it would break at least a few builds.  
---
It'd be a different story if this is how the game was off the hop, everyone would be fine with it.  But since there's the slap mechanic and pacifist mode they kind of killed the whole premise of it being a wild west.  I think the whole same character for both modes is rough as there's no incentive to stay in the pvp world when you're not pvping
---
2 players in a team  one gets wanted  and lets the other kill him and then they switch? 
---
I don't think you understand that means nothing... EVERYONE get to bring there current character over. Not just the OP people. The Leaderboard would reflect the best players right now. And If new character we're required, it would probably show those same people in the leaderboard. They're OP for a reeason. Maybe they're.... better at the game or spend more time on it than you. If they're better because they're cheating, well, they won't be in the leader board very long because it's a lot more likely they'll be found cheating if they're skyrocketing to the top of the leaderboards...
---
So why aren't they fixing the dupes? And I don't just mean the ones we know of. There were tons of dupe exploits reported in the BETA and they just fixed the most obvious ones, hoping the others won't be as widespread.... It's ridiculous.
---
*since BETA, but yeah, I agree.
---
No. Survival mode is zero dev time. That's why it was released as some sort of 'big deal'. They tried to placate people asking for new content and new stuff to do by setting PvP to default-yes and telling them to go and play the same game again.
---
OMG... wall of text.
---
Do luck and intelligence stats play a roll maybe? I'm max Intel and 5 luck. You may also need to rank up gunsmith to build the mods once you learn them.
---
Reminds me of a scene in Training Day.  "Oh what, so just let the animals wipe themselves out, right?"   Response?  "God willing"  
---
That's my take on the survival mode option.   I'm currently a 77 level player, with a fair amount of mods and weaponry but still no legit challenge to the 100 to 150++ that can dump me with one or two kill shots.   I can inflict a fair amount of damage myself, but personally if those gravitated to the "new" version it would even the playing field for a lot of the people in the current environment.   
---
Well I can tell you right now. This is going to be a icon that never gets touched on my console. I don't give fuck all for PvP in this game. In fact I can count on 1 hand how many players I have killed, and that's only because they started shit with me. 
---
I picked up fallout 76 because it's fallout. I want to build, explore and loot. This is going to be a huge waste of time and money on Betheada's part. But hey maybe this is what needs to happen in order for them to see what we really want to do in this game.
---
Thanks man,
---
I think I have only ever taken control of one workshop and then that went sour. A few players turned up all at once and at the time I was level 6 with next to nothing weapons to defend myself so ended up getting fed up of it in the end!
---
No, the chameleon mutation
---
Because you can’t use any other armor than the 90%rw legandary effect
---
Yeah thi would be a good QOL update My stash is packed with holotapes I've dumped in there just to remedy the scrolling issue just glad tapes don't weigh anything.
---
Did you even read the article or are you just riding the bandwagon? If it's the latter please redirect yourself to r/Fallout. If it's the former, I guess you didn't see them tease more PVE related content coming soon
---
or even worse was when people realized if you tamed a nightmare, told it to stay in front of their house, walked behind the house and said "follow me" it'd open the door because A) pathing was bad, and B) nightmares didn't give a F about locks.
---
Oh yeah... I forgot about that.
---
Im out of the loop, what is survival mode?
---
This is a game, it’s nt work
---
They don't take acid the smelt the lead inside extractor, it's already ready-to-use scrap 👍 just a tip
---
Not enough to convey:  "I appreciate it, but I am not in a position to trade right now."
---
The "No" emote looks more like:  "Are you kidding?!  Fuck no."
---
Yup look in your building menu and look for stash box and build that you can store all your stuff safely in it and no one can never steal it 
---
It hasn't and I doubt it will. They'd rather nerf uniyelding imo
---
Yes concentrated fire only works in VATS. 
---
And if you want to trade it again, you need to remove the custom name
---
I don't really know enough about the game to be too specific.  Just some new player advice would be nice.  I'm low level with 0 idea of what I'm doing
---
Nothing about not having fast travel is survival its an annoyance.
---
Any other game that doesn't allow fast travelling on a map this size has mounts that increase travel speed.
---
Die mid SQB fight and end up having to walk back from V76 because you don't use the camp, yeah sounds like great fun!
---
What's been confirmed sofar is that the new 'Survival' mode will remove any and all restrictions currently on the PvP system in place.  
---
This means that anyone at any time can start shooting at you will full damage enabled. They also intend to increase the risk on death, making it more rewarding for people to engage in PvP and also give incentive to defend yourself at all costs to avoid losing your stuff.  
---
Everything else pretty much stays the same from what I'm reading sofar.

You're not griefing, you're RPing as a Raider

Wishful thinking. 
---
Bethesda's handling of requests and issues reminds me of like a teenager in high school with a book report do the next day. They skim through the book and write a report that while is technically correct, misses the actual point of what the book was about.
---
Whoops I'm sorry, it actually costs 5 dollars to make not 10 dollars.  
---
The glow in the dark map costs about 10 cents to make, not 50 cents.
---
The 20 army men figures are actually about 1 cent per 5 figures so in total it costs 4 cents to make not 40 cents.
---
The Nylon bag didn't cost 90 cents to make, it cost 55 cents to make.
---
The Steel booklet is really a plastic case so it costs about 1 cent to make, not 10 cents.
---
Fallout 76 game disk comes with a cardboard disk so it practically has no value so we'll say it costs 1 cent. 
---
 The Fallout 76 game itself is going to end up free to play anyways  considering how fast the price fluctuates like a bitcoin so we cannot  put a price on the game itself. But it's gonna be f2p anyways.
---
 The T-51B helmet costs about 5 dollars to make, not 10 dollars. It is  made out of cheap injected plastic  that was mass manufactured with a  voice changer that has worse quality than shit you'd find at a dollar  store.
---
shitty triple AAA batteries - 5 cents.
---
Manufacturing cost: $5.21
---
Retail value: $199.99
---
OK I did that logged off and on again and still the same. I can do a hunters rifle but no other weapons. Please don't tell I have wasted 800 atoms on a skin that only does 1 item???
---
Nothing makes your palms sweatier than extracting with classified gear and seeing 2 people roll up on the point.
---
Just  a rumor i read. was trying to find out if there is any validity to it
---
It’s in whitespring behind the tennis courts at the golf club.   There’s a gazebo there and it’s on the wall of the gazebo.  The gazebo is easy to find but the fountain itself is very small and can easily be missed if you’re not paying  close attention.    
---
Smart.  So It defaults to alphabetical if you take all the holotapes out of your stash at the same time?
---
I always let my friends kill me if I'm wanted.  I'd rather them take my caps and they will let me have my junk if I'm even carrying any.
---
Caps aren't created for PVP rewards with Wanted and Revenge bounties.  They are taken from the dead player.
---
All trading Wanted / PVP kill trading does is waste condition or ammo (if shooting).
---
[Paladin Danse hated that]
---
I literally said "I hope for your sake that nobody..." 
---
Clearly that is saying i hope it doesn't happen. How you've then jumped from that to me wishing it upon other people, i have no idea, if your mind squirrels its way down to these conclusions then i think you are the one that needs help.
---
Speaking from a perspective where two of my currently family are actually suffering from it, i took personal offence from where the other guy called you cancer. If you are fine with this then whatever, but i'm not fine with it being used as an insult. To then move that to say that i wish it upon other people, is absolutely fucking disgusting, because that is not at all what i said. 
---
If you and the other guy want to throw insults at each other, carry on. I just wanted to make it clear that using the term 'cancer' to describe someone is fucking vile. However, you seem quite keen to say that i'm in the wrong for telling him not to say it, so clearly you get some kind of sick satisfaction from being called it.
---
Eh, was a blanket statement while I was still irritated with the post from Bethesda.  I feel like they should've thought out a fuller concept before giving us what they gave us.
---
Yes please! I want to name my TS Fat-Man "Big Boy" (damn you Bethesda for not putting the Big Boy here and giving us a Two-Shot Big Boy for maximum carnage)
---
What makes you think that server is still up? It probably crashed and that's why you got disconnected. I've never been in a disconnect where it didn't drop both me and my friend at the same time.
---
There are a couple methods that still work, same ones that have been here since beta.  For the most part they are not being used much.  One reason is just that there is a not a reason to do it anymore, Bobbleheads, Legendary hunting rifles, and some Rare 3\* armor have market demand but no one needs the caps anymore.  The Pvp mode will still be dominated by dupers, because they can do so much more damage than anyone else, and have the coins needed to get the full armor sets that can reduce damage by 75%.  
---
copypasta.
---
I'm an idiot because I understand that 90% of the players are never going to spend a dime after their initial purchase? Okay. Wow.
---
I guess the current model you mention involves us paying monthly subscriptions to Bethes...oh wait we don't. That's right. It's not WoW.
---
When I got to an endgame level in Ark I started breeding Dinos with insanely high base stats and power leveling them.  I would then set them on Agressive Wander and call out to the server that a loot dino was on the loose.  It was always fun seeing guild logs of how my random T-Rex named Fluffy7 killed 4 players before being taken out.  They wre always stuffed with high level armor weapons and plans so it was worth the investment for anyone willing to take on the challenge.  Sometimes i would get requests for me to breed a copy of that rex because its colors were so cool or just how strong it was.  Usually I would set them up sometimes I would give them a more difficult challenge to prove they were worthy of such a creature.  I miss the earlier days of Ark things are a little too crazy now.
---
So many people still blame tse... Forgetting you can stack 1k explosive bobble heads at once...that's always been the issue that still hasnt been adressed... Nerfing guns.. Making new servers all uneccesary destruction of an already contentless game... Also they plan to limit nukes more than they already have... What is left for people to do really except come vent their frustration on reddit like so... For it to be completely ignored by suits.
---
I’ve been tolerant of the notion that dupers have not been “game breaking” in the current state of the game because PvP is the way it is now. It is most certainly game breaking in a survival type setting and you’re a fucking moron if that doesn’t easily make sense to you. 
---
Hmm, I thought it was changed to give ore instead of scrap, or am I thinking of something else?
---
Agree... Nothing else to say
---
Tease...is that all it takes for you?
---
They've been teasing that the duping would be fixed soon since November :/
---
Yowch. Should've taken another few seconds to read over it because I'm pretty sure that paint was specifically for just that gun.
---
Sure it does, it shows how much you exaggerate.
---
Haha that's great...I called mine birthday suprise. 
---
Agreed man, this sub helps a lot with finding out where to go and how to get certain things.
---
Also if you want the generators you can get them for free by powering up any of the Power Plants. It gives you one after the other every time you complete the event. The best is the fusion generator.
---
For resource nodes you can look up a FO76 map site, I use one that I found from Google. They also had a phone app version. You can disable everything but resources and it will show you all the nodes that have been added. The map isn't complete. I use a place near Watoga with both a gold and copper node.
---
 To fit all of the stations in a tent just grab the large tent plan from a vendor, build a 4x4 slab and place that on there. I was able to fit a cooking station, bed roll, weapons table, armor station, chem table and tinker workbench. The power armor station goes at the entrance so you walk through it. You even have space for a music chair and decontamination shower on the outside
---
To fix your fast travel spot just try to move the actual c.a.m.p around your build zone, it will work

I expect it to have deminishing returns, like after the 3rd piece.
---
A competent UI would simply display what stat change when a perk card is in focus.
---
you have spent atoms on a skin that only works on one weapon. The chrome one only works on Mini guns I believe.
---
It's a bad price for such a single use thing. 
---
What do you play on, I'd love to see that base if I could, it sounds awesome
---
Enter in rear
---
A bunch of them make ores, like crystal and aluminum iirc, but my Lead extractor at home pumps out usable scrap, I know that much for sure 👍
---
I think itll be more interesting if each mutation added a unique buff.
---
Eagle eyes adds more crit damage like 5%
---
Carnivore adds 5% damage versus animals and scorchbeast 
---
Herd mentality adds damage when in a group.
---
There couod be a prefix anf suffix so you would have to roll a mutant's mutating gun of whatever to get all the bonuses for the mutations
---
I actually just saw my first hermit crab last week at level 68. I was like why is that car moving haha
---
Yessir have gotten a quad the dragon,but npced that trash 
---
So in regards to nodes - what do they do?
---
I realize I must sound like a right noob right now..
---
I do have lowish INT, but it’s max gunsmith. And my luck is 8. I’ll try building as much as I can and scrapping them when I get home from work. Thanks to Luck of the Draw I have a ton of mats to build with.
---
no, I anticipate costs for managing servers needs to be recouped and that has to be coming from somewhere and that's sure as FUCK not coming from NEW SALES. You're right that 90% of the current userbase is not going to spend a dime on this fucking game anymore, and that's BSG's problem for putting out a shit-tier product with shit-tier "DLC". 
---
You can look at it anyway you want, it's still a shit-sandwich. 
---
And they fixed the most commonly known method of doing it, and confirmed the next patch is going to remove the more unknown and game breaking methods, too.
---
Idk for sure but I alsondont see why not. In white springs I  ought a two shot black powder pistol from the vendor
---
I really don't think this has anything to do with Bethesda, as you're kind of implying that it may have something to do with them. Sounds like somwthing fucky went on with your personal setup. Doesn't sound like a normal issue.
---
Cant agree more. There is a lack of endgame content most online games have. I have explored most the map. Killed everything that moves. Now finding a good spot for legend drops and grinding its all thats left. My last 4 times fighting the Queen I dc half way through so it was just wasted stimpacks and ammo.
---
In regards to stash boxes, I have found a few dotted around the map and they say they are mine, even though I know I haven't placed them. Whats the crack with this?
---
Did you talk to the bot? Was it even there?
---
Yes... my friend just got a TSE The Dragon. Level 50. They're out there. Can't wait to see him tear up the SBQ
---
Oh sweet
---
Its the yellow bulb under lights (I forgot the actual name).  You have to wire them together and get a computer to control all of them at once or you can change the lightbulbs separately. It's actually pretty awesome you can set it on assorted colors or about eight or nine different colors. 
---
You can send in a ticket and explain why you are unhappy with the spent atoms. You should be able to get it refunded.
---
But I thought that Fallout 76 has the nicest community! Why would you be worried about griefing?

Thank you ... finally someone who understands me.  
---
No, I'm not talking about 2 shot, I meant double and quad referring to the increased magazine size
---
Because the game designers needed our voice to understand that the main two groups of players here are RP/casuals and meta endgamers. They didn’t really know that when they thought up the game. Hopefully they are learning by listening and even extracting data from player choices in the live game. 
---
As in the generators to power your camp? 
---
I literally know NOTHING about this game.. as it probably shows!
---
Power Plants? Where can I find these bad boys?
---
If i need lead i go to the fire departement near charlesston, there is a gymroom and those weights give you alot of lead.  Also the motel near flatwoods, theres a small gymroom aswell with weights you can pick up..  Then if you go to the silobunkers.  The residents section where u need to make some sort pass with your DNA on..  In that residents section theres a gym room aswell with weights you can pick up. And theres a dumbell at whitesprings in the small  firedepartment. There is a dumbell u can pick up near a bed.  Then at the mire in  camp venture, in the bedrooms you can find dumbells aswell.. 
---
I went there (of course I'd been there, and it's just a brisk jog from my camp anyway) last night and the event was on. I finished with TWO seconds left, like in some movie ;) The servers went unresponsive early in the event, which didn't help. I got frogs with three and four fluids within the last minute to be able to complete. It didn't help that I could find those damn bugs in the tall grass half the time. Eventually, I got a couple of decent pics with the wise one.
---
This!
---
You can build extractors like at workshops. Essentially your camp IS a workshop
---
It’s just general stash boxes around the map they are safe to use and you should use them often
---
So from the current trend I’d say Bethesda is going to not do this completely reasonable and intelligent thing.
---
Their intentions are clearly to improve a sour spot on the game, it just feels like they're trying to appease too many people by separating pvp crowds and non pvp crowds.  The main issue I see is non pvpers are getting irritated by griefers, so they figure they'll give griefers and pvpers an area just for them, but griefers would rather play in reg mode slowly destroying pacifist camps and being obnoxious in other areas.
---
There also seem to be random terrain that will not allow you to snap foundations onto it. But if you place foundations manually, it allows it.  Ive spent most of my play time trying to snap foundations in place for my camps than I have doing anything else in game.  Its very frustrating.
---
Because we don’t need a new game mode when the game mode they already released is absurdly broken, focus should be spent on one project not spread to other unnecessary elements that aren’t actually making the game better...
---
now why would they do that? at most unyielding gives you +15, even if they nerfed it to +1 per piece (instead of +3), bloodied melee builds routinely run around with 50 strength.
---
Exactly. It's gonna happen at some point. Some type of level/damage scaling would seem a better option. But what do I know... I'm a lowly level 22.
---
You can get diseases from any spoiled
---
Do you need to get a flat tire during a blizzard to know you won't like it? We know that having av relatively large handful of people with 100,000 explosive bobbleheads who simply one-shot kill everyone they come across, all day will be a bad experience and a terrible rollout of this new mode.
---
Duping hasn't affected *your* game, yet. It baffles my mind that people still think this way from such a selfish perspective. "I hAvEn'T sEeN iT, So iT dOeSn'T ExIsT!"
---
Luckily, what you can an exercise in futility, the overwhelming majority of players call useful feedback which has already caught the attention of Bethesda multiple times. I don't think that means what you think it means. Your post, for instance, is a much better example.
---
Seems like they should be able to make it so the custom name only shows up for you. For anyone else it would just display the effect/armor/weapon name.
---
Carnivore, even though I have crops... but its too risky to try to remove so I embrace it. Apex predator!
---
Get this guy a fucking puppers.
---
I mean, it's coming either way at this point.  At least they've acknowledged people weren't thrilled with their initial half-baked concept, and can hopefully come up with something people will actually enjoy.
---
I have little to no hope considering they've already pulled the plug on additional content but the atom shop updates every other day. This game needs to die so they can realize what not to do in fo5.
---
Someone asks for sources on the pricing and you respond with lower numbers and still without a source
---
And what is it the extractors do please?
---
So you were that bored, you took to pestering some noob and stalking him...surely just putting the TV on or going out side with the other half or playing something else is better no?
---
You want to play but there's that little to do you resort to griefing (he may have thought it was even if you didn't, its all a point of view!)
---
I just have to remember where I have put stuff in them then!
---
Rumor going around in other fourms that Bethesda is already moving ahead with future content now for fo76 to get the game over with and now devoting their resources to their future IP's.
---
Don’t know why you’d be surprised, Bethesda doesn’t understand what they want from the beginning 
---
That's some nice ~~bait~~ numbers you're throwing out there. Got some proof or citation that you'd like to add to all those fancy numbers? Even if it were true (which you have no proof of unless you're about to drop some documents on me showing what Bethesda paid, in which case you must be a insider and please for the love of god tell Todd that he needs to start taking his pills again), consumerism isn't exactly new, so it's not like you're blowing anyone away with this.   
---
It's like saying "Gee, Apple sure makes a profit on their massively overpriced phones that cost very little to make". Everyone knows, nobody cares, people still buy it.
---
The only thing that you're throwing out there amongst it that had some merit would be Fallout 76 going F2P, were it not for the fact that Bethesda has publicly denied F76 ever going F2P.
---
Thank you for your input, though.
---
I can promise you, your method does not compete with lucky hole. 
---
If almost nobody buys Atoms, then how many, Players would it take for them to get $50 in Atom purchases? A few hundred maybe? Compared to selling a single new copy...🤔
---
This is the game that taught me to never preorder. I thank you guys for teaching me this lesson
---
What do you mean why? So that bloodied builds don't routinely run around with 50 strength.
---
Totally true, weakest weapons in the game atm is all missile launchers, auto nade launcher(this is the saddest one) and all nuke launchers. All these have the projectile moving really slowly on top of ridiculously low dmg.
---
Never tested and havnt played fo76 in a while , but im confused to what you mean by stacking,regular buzz saw doesnt have the stacking mod.
---
YES! Right now my only hopes is that 76 will carry me to TES 6, and then that carries me to Starfield...but knowing a ballpark on content for this game will have me switching between games less and focusing on 76 more.
---
I'm having a bit more fun now that I've found Watoga is good for legendaries, but it will get old fast.
---
I hate this sub. So many people golding their own post and going full " My opinion represent the entire community" and so many pvp whiners. You don't want to play pvp ? Fine don't play pvp but don't insert your opinion on people who wants it.
---
I don't think pvp mode would be "wasted dev time".
---
Two thing I agree on would be : new character only or no legendary weapons.
---
And possibly no stacked effect.
---
If you think I'm wrong that's because you severely underestimate how much it costs to mass produce plastic goods in china.  
---
But yeah sure, let me fucking fly over to china and look up those invoice reports on the factory floor.   
---
BRB.
---
Oh sorry, I'm role-playing as an asshole instead of being an asshole.
---
Much better.
---
I have 2 characters (85, 140) I have come to the conclusion that I am better off building around whatever random decent legendary drops as everything else is a step back. It just so happens that both characters have looted explosive pump action shotguns. One is a level 15, the other is a level 45. The fact that both of these are far superior than anything else I have found, no matter the level, is sad. As much as I want to use different weapons, I just can't bring myself to use things that are inferior and I have yet to loot anything on par. 
---
It's worse for melee. Why shouldn't I use the level 45 Black Diamond until I get lucky enough for a +1 str 3\*? So far, across both characters, I have looted one single other +1 str weapon and it's a meathook. (so no PA)
---
PA is in much the same boat. I have been trying to get a fully modded set other than Excavator to use, but that's also turning out to be a waste. I never really feel like I need more armor or protection and sacrificing all that carry weight makes it a tough choice. It would be much different if I thought the extra stats would make any kind of noticeable difference. I have been waiting for another stash increase to make choices like this more viable. 
---
No they are all linked so you place in one you can go to another one and it will have all your stuff in it 
---
Or hit level 50 and are gaining no additional stats
---
That's only true if they are wanted, is it not?
---
🤔 another conspiracy theory
---
Well I guess I have been Bethesdered!!!
---
I'd trade more if there was a two step authorization in trading. You initially accept the trade, everyone lines up what they want to trade (Caps, 0 cap items for straight this for that trading, etc) and then both side OK the trade again. The ability to just grab an item and go without a secondary OK, yeah I don't trust people that much, unless it's a straight caps for item trades.
---
Frankly real PvPers want an even playing field to show they have better skills imo and are the ones wanting no legendaries so everyone is even based on basic craftable guns and armor only.  
---
I think you’re right, if you’re going to have legendaries around it’s moot carry over or start fresh.  The only real way to get as close to a “fix” as possible is no legendaries.
---
That might help too but they've already stated they're working on a leaderboard so that's unlikely to go away.
---
Carnivore imo, it's very easy to run into meat especially in The Mire and Cranberry Bog but also, corn soup is really good so pick whatever you like, it doesnt matter much. 
---
What it doesn’t do (or at least didn’t do in FO4, and I *believe* that’s true here) is benefit from receiver mods. So if you have a Hardened receiver, first bullet gets extra damage, second is just a regular receiver’s worth. Not nearly as large a difference in FO76 as in FO4 (receiver mods in FO4 could give you like 50% more damage... in 76 it’s like 10%)
---
yup, then the patch after that and then the one after that. 6-8 months after launch is no good.
---
The economy is already borked because of it, people are already selling this crap on ebay. 
---
At first i thought its just a coincidence, but Bethesda brining PVP servers and not removing the items the people are selling on ebay seems a bit suspicious to me...cant but TSE shotguns on the Atom store can they, ebay's fair game though!
---
This is some of the best news I have ever received! Is there a limit to how much you can put it there?
---
Yes! This is probably my most wanted quick fix right now, it would be so easy to implement too
---
Never said I didn't like the game. I have over 80 hours of gameplay (and I'd have more if I didn't always give my kids first dibs on the tv) so I obviously like this game. I'm looking for a new way to replay a game I like.
---
That might be a winning strategy IF THE GAME WAS WORTH $50. Which everyone and their dog knows, it is NOT in this state. It's not even FUCKING STABLE. GTFO outta here. 
---
Pretty sure this is the first because it’ll be easier to make then a new quest line or new area
---
Seriously? 
---
Yea I had cannibal but had to drop it because I’m a power armor user and it gets tiring getting in and out to feed
---
do the math. if they nerfed it to +1, that's just a 10 reduction. bloodied builds would still be running around with 40 strength.
---
nerfing unyielding would negatively impact everyone *except* bloodied melee builds.
---
Nope, if you die to a person you lose your caps
---
Well the whole point is to farm and make as much net profit as possible. Therefore you want to farm low level super mutants, and those drop .308. That was almost half of my reply, was explaining how to quickly farm not just .308 but materials to craft it as well as caps. I’m just farming caps and steel and it doesn’t take long to do it once you know your route for a speed run. This is a game that heavily emphasizes survival and material gathering; to me it seems like players just aren’t doing that or are doing it wrong, and then complaining. 
---
For example, I don’t understand why you’re fixated on West Tek. That’s probably a bad place to farm as the enemies are going to take more ammo to kill and clearly don’t drop what you need. Why are we even talking about it then? That’s kind of like trying to farm Watoga bots for .308. You’re in the wrong place. And why are we also counting on enemy ammo drops? I don’t think they were intended to be a major source of ammunition. I only did that early on, probably prior to level 20-25.

Two Shot Explosive Penetrating Penis

I'm on Xbox playing right now, and they're still not registering. I've pick rhododendron, soot and carrot. 
---
The challenge is  
---
Pick Flowers (0/8)
---
then you can pick any of these  
---
Ash Roses (0/10)  
---
Bloodleaf (0/10)  
---
Carrot Flowers (0/10)  
---
Fever Blossoms (0/10)  
---
Fern Flowers (0/10)  
---
Gourd Flowers (0/10)  
---
Rhododendron Flowers (0/10)  
---
Strangler Blooms (0/10)  
---
Soot Flowers (0/10)  
---
Tato Flowers (0/10)
---
So, (0/8) AND (0/10) are both correct. You need 8 types of flowers and 10 of each type.
---
They extract resources at timely intervals. You can then use those resources to craft with. There's all sorts of resource nodes. I like junk the most, but I like the idea of having access to two
---
The trading UI is almost unusable. It needs to be made like fallout classic barter with a field that is permanently visible where items are proposed and a cap value tallied. This is addressed as one of the central ideas in the response I posted for the inside the vault call for feedback they put out on Jan 1
---
Same here ! 
---
Under chairs? Like the musical instruments?
---
Some are bugged too. Did Swarm of Suitors. First the Mirelurks glitched and spawned far away / got stuck. Then I got fuck all for rewards when I completed it. 
---
No black powder weapons can't be double or quad, not sure what that guy is on about :) My source is that i'm level 209 and frequent the market subreddits and haven't seen any across all platforms since game release. They would be too broken. 
---
nah, i use carebear land as a generic term where nobody can hurt anybody unless explicitly accepted.  It's not about getting lowbies over to kill, it's about bringing people to the survival land when they're farming.  I mean, different game/different community, but when you had to grind up gold in UO as a PVPer, you'd never consider doing it in fel(danger area), because you're going to be watching tv, listening to the radio, doing other things. Without an incentive to be in pvp mode, people default to non pvp mode, which starves an area.  If you incentivize me to farm in a pvp area, I will, and because of that I'll probably have some insane runins with random people where it's either super tense, or we spark an uneasy truce while the farming is good.  if the farming gets not so good who knows, maybe one person thinks the area is too small for 2 people. 
---
Camo is for  hunting rifle only, chrome is for mini-gun only.
---
Damnit. Thanks for the response
---
that's the best solution. stop nerfing pve servers and disable legendaries in the pvp ones.
---
Amen to that!!!
---
Ah fair enough, joke went over my head. I really want them to develop 76 and stick to thier statement of ongoing support. 
---
If player numbers continue to dip through fatigue and wherever else I'd be concerned they'd just bin the project. I mean it's got to be a resource sink, it's a commercial flop and has massively damaged the brand and consumer trust. Makes me wonder if there's anyone doing a risk/ reward analysis for that very scenario.
---
I don't have any faith in thier ability to develop and support the game, especially with monetisation. Thier history speaks volumes, skyrim in particular. How you can release the same game 10 times and still have it a glitchy mess. Boggles the mind. 
---
Well if it's such garbage then how is improving it for existing players gonna bring in new money?
---
Whereas fighting the bad press by publicly announcing changes and improvements *will* sucker in new buyers. Pull your head outta your ass, they already have your money and aren't going to prioritize you over the possiblity of selling new copies.
---
Fallout 76 is a spin-off with pvp. It's as stupid as crying about "huuur duuur fallout 76 isn't a real fallout because fallout games used to be offline. Reeeeee"
---
You don't talk for the entire community and it doesn't matter that you don't want to see it but they are people who wants pvp.
---
With the state of the game at launch they should have released this basic info then!
---
Customers shouldn't be having to ask and ask for it 3 months on when the game is still a broken mess.
---
I guess if people had seen the PVP / survival mode as the first thing to be released though at launch it would have reduced sales even more :/
---
I'm sure I'll never see it for the excavator set. Haha
---
Thanks mate!
---
When the bag works. We need buildable containers that replace the idea of mailing / shipping (as we are doing this personally , period, in the post nuclear waste) and a variety of utility containers for both field supply / gifting and things in the camp for organization / display and storage utility. 
---
I got my plan from the Harper's ferry vendor bot, but I believe it can pop up in the Brotherhood vendor in Watoga also.
---
If you max demo expert for double damage, and take the perception perk for double radius and ordnance express for ammo weight it can be a really fun uncommon build and is defiantly capable of being effective at endgame. 
---
Creative?
---
Great post. Glad bethesda replied too, and honestly wouldn't mind to let the mode bake a little longer because of these obvious issues. In house testing for this type of stuff might not translate well in the actual game. Hopefully thesse issues will be ironed out.
---
It happens constantly on almost every server I join.
---
How is it "griefing"?!? I was just having some silly fun, wasn't trying to kill him or get him killed or anything! You talk of points of view whilst having an incredibly cynical skewed one that sounds more like you're projecting than anything... 
---
Haha glad I could help. Happy CAMPing!
---
Never said I wanted Fallout 5 just want a new way to enjoy a game I love to play (even if I have to pay $60 for it) and give Bethesda an easy way to drive more sales. I may be in the minority but it wouldn't take much tweaking to re-release this in classic mode and people who were on the fence who don't play mmo's might actually purchase a copy heck I almost didn't purchase FO76 because of that but I'm glad I did.
---
existing players are leaving the game, taking their wallets with them. The 'improvements' are getting shellacked for over 4.1k upvotes that show clearly that BGS has NO CLUE what the user base wants. 
---
keep standing up for them, You're the kind of sucker they need.
---
That's what I was thinking, but for the life of me, I couldn't find it in there last night.  I poked around for several minutes.
---
Was going to surprise a teammate by building one in their camp w/o telling them.  :)
---
Also disarm the can traps at raider camps and you'll have tons of cans to scrap
---
Are you the same J_Tayta I took round Watoga on PS4 a while back?
---
The only people in favor of importing their PVE character in Survival are people who want to grief Nothing else, if you like the game you Don't mind starting over. 
---
These people do not want to PVP they want to destoy everyone they encounter effortlessly. And until the game encourages to not necessarily shoot at everyone you'll meet this mentality sadly will not change.
---
Glitches aside Survival is going to be what i feared. IE a hellhole ala GTAO.
---
No restrictions is fine but there needs to be some sort of self control coming from the player themselves. We all know this is gonna populated with people with theCOD/GTAO mindset of shooting everything that moves (especially if you are twice the level of your target) thus completely eliminating the potentiality of making friends.
---
 And Don't tell me you can make friends after working together in an event, have ever done a heist in GTAO? The second it ends and you're back in the open, they'll kill you. 
---
The people duping and wanting to grief are not here to play fallout they are to satisfy some ego issues by steamrolling through everything and everyone.
---
Forcing these people to play legit and on the same equal ground as everyone else is mandatory and will only be insuring half of the mode success. 
---
I can tell you one thing though, after 2 days of being bested fair and square keep an eye on reddit they will come crying about how this mode suck due to their inabilty to fulfill their god fantasies.
---
(Also as a side note Nuked zones are gonna be impossible to play… ) 
---
Well, I gotta just believe you since I'm not sure how would they get to the 40 str if unyielding is nerfed.
---
The incompetence is strong with this game 
---
So first new content is a BETA for pretty much the same game we have now that could have used a few extra months in BETA itself.....and you find this acceptable?
---
What about the other factions? BoS and the enclave, why leave them out?
---
Also, what is this game even? The quests aren't much more difficult or fun with a group and exploring with others is just a race to grab clipboards and fans. Trying to explore the story with a group around is impossible, you're just distracted by your party or get separated. The most I've gotten out of multiplayer is guiding people new to this game, and it gets real old trying to introduce all the crappy limitations and bugs in a way they don't sound so bad, or are getting fixed. But we're like six updates into the game and I still don't know what plans I've learned and buying from dupers is really the only way to get endgame loot or a decent legendary.
---
If you're trying to say Bethesda's putting TSEs for sale on eBay like that post is implying then good lord what kind of rock did you squirm out of and what conspiracy theorist train did you climb onto?
---
I kept saying that to my mates when we were playing "Why is this!??", "Why is that!??" After a while I'd start to say why and then just answered my own question;
---
Because Bethesda launched an unfinished, buggy, POS game that somehow still manages to be fun enough to play through. They took Fallout 4 - stripped it down, sold it at full price and then charged for "cosmetics" that were free in FO4 whilst at the same time looking ugly as fuck and not worth a tenth of the asking price.
---
What I hate about replying to some posts recently is that some words I write I say in my head in Jim Sterling's voice...
---
Yeah the generators power things like lights, turrets, traps, buttons, and purifiers (purifiers and turrets are most important) Purifiers give purified water which gives no rads, is more beneficialallows you to craft chems if you have the plans for them. 
---
Powerplants show up on the map even without icons it shows a drawing of a power plant but Poseidon can be found very far south of Vault 76 above the ash heap zone west of the Charleston Station. 
---
I think at this point they are in a do or die situation where they have to recover the game to something redeemable or they risk future games no longer getting the bethesda pass.  They can survive on their other investments sure but it would be bad for them to abandon the games that got them where they are now.  Realistically they would be better off paying some of the modding community for their contributions and making them fully implemented it works for Ark.  
---
It absolutely is the reason 
---
First, this is a game, not a life and death situation. So your analogy fails right there. Second I don't have to go to the PvP servers if I don't want to. So I'm not being forced to. 
---
Can you prove the numbers you just quoted? Do you know for a fact they haven't or have been banned? No. Neither can I. I said I hoped that Bethesda has taken steps to get rid of those accounts. Also, you don't know if they are going to fix those bobbleheads stacking. Just because they don't mention something doesn't mean it's not happening. They gave us a very tiny look at some of the things they are planning for the patch. 
---
I never said I didn't see it that it hasn't had an impact on other peoples games. No one has ever one shotted me in the game. No one has ever raised my camp to the ground. And I've got over 450 hours playing the game. But I also don't consider the game to have a real economy since it all happens outside of the game. And I won't consider there to be a game economy until there are tools for it in the game. That allow us to set up shops, advertise or let others know. Until then, it's all happening outside of the game. And again, I hope most of that duped stuff is gone before they put it in. 
---
So saying "I hAvEn'T sEeN iT, So iT dOeSn'T ExIsT!" is the lamest response that means nothing. I clearly think it exists, because I said I hope Bethesda got rid of as many as they can before they release this. Which means I also think that dupers are bad. 
---
Players aren't giving back useful feedback, because feedback is only useful if you actually had something to feedback. All they are giving is their feedback on a post about some details about something they are planning. 
---
They are literally freaking out, like you are, over something you don't really know about. And then taking it out on other people. And then you want to be viewed as the rational one. HarDly DudDe!
---
It's not absurdly broken. Saying such a thing is absurd. 
---
radicool, strange in numbers, alcohol, drugs.
---
The ultracite jetpack does not exist (yet)
---
It's always going to be a matter of catch, which is why they included the additional comments about balancing between high and low. But if you start now, you immediately turn it into a shitshow thanks to all the high level duped armor and weapons.  That'll create a cancer that will stay with the server mode for it's entire lifespan.
---
Quoting your upvotes, that's cute considering its dropped from 5K in the last little while lol, so maybe it's more controversial than accurate.
---
And I'm not what they want, because I don't spend on Atoms either. Nor am I defending them, I'm in fact saying they don't care about catering to you or most of the player base in general.
---
I will try to remember to! 
---
Im out of the loop, what is survival mode. I haven’t played since mid December after I completed the main quest line
---
I never did the main questline. I don't play survival games for their story :P
---
If the dupers have been banned, how can they access the items to complete these transactions?
---
Bethesda stated they were on it and have banned / solved the duping so either they have or they haven't but someone is still creating new listings on ebay for these items.
---
As a TS Gatling main I cringe when I read about the coming nerf. I could run a TSE as there are untold amounts of them duped but I earned this gun via playing the game. Just like in FO4, the explosive legendary weapons make the game boring IMO.
---
Real money to buy a TSE? No need, they give them out on XB1 sometimes or you can find them at vendors or buy for caps from the trading forums.
---
10mm penis 😪
---
Blind Beth fanboys will downvote anything criticizing Bethesda and their shitty ass game. Have my upvote though sir, this is pure bullshit.
---
Some guy started following me around in game like that once, and it was just annoying more than anything else. That's all.
---
Great. Well, I'm looking forward to seeing your video on it. Make sure I get a shout out!
---
The "needs support" requirement should go away entirely
---
Well, SiN requires a team, chems don't last forever and you need to keep them up. Those buffs are conditional, so yep, it definitely makes sense to nerf Unyielding now:)
---
I was in watoga, last night, 3 times in a row I walked between two busses jumped in the air and froze in midair. Multiple times since last patch in watoga (since I live there) my game crashes with a sound like grinding gears locking up. And points were it overloads my Xbox and completely shuts my console off. No other game I own has ever done this.
---
 So yes the game is horribly fucking broken. Still have almost 300 hours 2 high level characters and play daily. But that doesn’t mean the game isn’t fucking broken. 
---
There is a perk card called, Starched Genes, that when used will protect and maintain your mutation permanently, as long as the perk card remains active.  The perk card also prevents any further mutations, however, if you want to take another serum just remove the card and replace it once you have taken the serum.  * Using Rad Away while Starched Genes is active is no problem, however,  Rad-X will totally supress the mutations effects, both positive and negative, while it runs it course.
---
On a side note, there is another perk card called, Class Freak, that will supress the negative effects of mutations.
---
Not even going to touch Survival, the only good PvP update is one that completely removes PvP.
---
This is not a PvP game, stop wasting time and resources trying to make it one, when you could be focusing on adding more content, such as these Vaults everyone is waiting for.
---
SBs have been dropping hand mades and lever actions for me since the last patch. You may want to carry a black powder as you can hit a SB in the air via vats with one. The low AP on the black powder works well in vats. 
---
Sending a notice to everyone now

I think it'll actually do the opposite, because yes people can jump right to the extreme now, but they'll get to the extreme in a month anyway. What segregation would do is actually make it harder for casuals to play the other game mode because they don't have as much time to play catch up. But if they can do most of their catch up in Adventure mode then there's no real barrier to entry. BGS just plain isn't going to make the game harder for new players to join, that's not good design for future sales and casual gamers, who tend to be more lucrative overall due to sheer numbers.
---
I would create a ticket with Bethesda support on their website. I've never gotten a errors like that on my xbox with this game, or ANY game for that matter. Try a couple of troubleshooting things first.
---
Try to reset your router (pull power cord for a minute or so). You may want to try to hard reset your Xbox (won't lose data). Turn the Xbox on, then when it's started up, hold the power button until the Xbox shuts off (15-20 seconds). Try the game again. If it's not working, try to log out of your xbox gamertag, and log back in.. last but not least, uninstall the game, and re-install it. This could take a while. 
---
I had a kid try to request 100 of my stimpacks, all of the aluminum ore and ultracite I had on me, my TSE lever action rifle, and all of the fusion cores I had on me. This is why I don't accept trade requests.
---
There isn't per-limb DR in this game so maybe your damage resistance is already balanced around the assumption that you have five pieces of armor, not six.
---
The radium rifle specifically has a problem where the chance of learning mods from scrapping it is at like 2.5%. I believe scrapping lever actions works normally.
---
There’s no cool down on the scorched earth event.
---
The artilery cannons are powered and not broken. 
---
yes, because chems are *so* hard to come by, right? there are other mechanics as well, I don't play bloodied melee so I don't know what they are, exactly.
---
but my point still stands: nerfing everything to the ground won't stop people from ruining your session.
---

I’ve extensively covered what it is during the part 1 of my feedback letter response to the Jan 1 inside the vault. You can read it via my /u cross post. Door is always open. Feel free to post any commentary and rebuttal. It’s very lengthy but I’ll just try and quote you a few short ideas right here. It’s a modernized take on the classic aesthetic of treasure adventures, player choice driven character and house building, vast wandering titles with a zen feel about being there, and ultra violence / death as the central theme. Every great game I’ve loved has been some combo of these. I’m in love with the game because it feels hand crafted for pc gamers that started with doom, fallout 1, diablo, myst, the sims. Somehow it honors these traditions while also being modern in a way that’s still trying to find its way out of an array of flaws, almost charming imperfections. 
---
If you are looking for Black Titanium take the Gorge Junk Yard. There is a resource node for Black Titanium there. Or buy the mine maps from a U Mine It vending machine. There is one at the Nuka Cola factory. 
---
I agree with a ton of what was said in this post. Rewards are definitely not a match to many of those events,  and nv season balancing is something they need to work on. 
---
I have a random question though,  how do you get t60 pa plans? I have mods but I have never seen a power armor plan for the t60 pa. 
---
When the game freezes, force closes, or shuts your console down...that’s called being broken. Fix that shit first then work on a PVP mode.
---
The fixed the main one that was being abused. Did you even read the inside the vault. They said they're working on it. 
---
Does each one have different outcomes?
---
This is the best analysis I have seen on this sub. These are the reasons why I put the game down. It’s too grindy, and the game balancing mechanics and rpg system are all off
---
This is the wackiest thing I've ever heard.
---
Raiders are dead
---
I'm level 26
---
Seriously please go away, you aren't helping, you're causing everything to spawn at five times my level.
---
Yes. It should have been. 
---
Yes!
---
erm is this when you run upto people and try to trade without speaking to them first or messaging them? 
---
That gun is probably still in its loading animation, though
---
Hey man,
---
The discussion is not just beginning, it’s done. It’s no secret that you guys have had a rough time with this game. This person took their own time and effort to try and throw you guys a bone. Anybody who still plays the game is probably hanging on by a thread, right now you should all be in player retention mode.
---
Do what the players want. End of discussion. If you don’t, players will leave.
---
Two years ago I wrote a passionate email to support about how much I loved your company. I spent more of my life in cyrodil, Skyrim and the capital wasteland than I did with my family. I was heartbroken by how unplayable fallout 4 was, and how little it resembled my favorite Bethesda game. 
---
I am only one of the players that fallout 76 cost you. In the last month I have spent over $200 on smite gems and indie games. You could have had all of that. I bought every dlc for oblivion (including your stupid horse armor), fallout 3 and Skyrim. I bought almost every port of skyrim. 
---
I will not buy another bethesda game until I see you go back to the company I loved, and many of us feel this way.
---
Don’t lose what few players are still hanging on. From buggy gameplay, item duping for sale online, the nuka dark rum fiasco, the nylon bags and the 50% price cut at Christmas you don’t have a lot of players left. For the love of god just do what this guy said. 
---
No. It’s because 95% of players fucking hate it. Occam’s razor
---
Yes there is a two or three hour cool down period for each silo. You won’t be able to launch another nuke from a silo until the time has passed. Switching servers doesn’t help.
---
Carnivore because glowy mobs from nuked whitesprings drop Ionized Meat. It is a meat that never spoils, gives 40 food and only weighs 0.05lbs. You can get hundreds and keep them in your stash. The meat drops from corpses after they transform into a meatpile do you can loot corpses you havdn't even killed.
---
Or you could just make the name only visible to you, and it shows as the unmodified name to anyone else?
---
I recently realized that now when I’m walking or driving I find myself looking left and right, over and over, looking for enemies and loot.   
---
WTH lol
---
Thing is, you shouldn't need a perk to make it not useless. In Fallout 3 and New Vegas, even without perks explosives were viable. 
---
Would it better if we moaned instead?
---
I thought the same, but it doesn't work as a Recon scope would, even though that's what the game suggests.
---
Instead of the little pips hovering above the sighted enemy's head you just get a dot on the compass wheel, basically complete white...but it works as it supposed to in that respect...
---
Oh brilliant, I know I have made a generator before, it was one of the quests close to the airport.
---
Not really. I am a simple person to play with cause I game by one rule. What you put into it is what you get I return. If people want to play bitch tactics with me I will kill them repeatedly until they rage quit the server. 
---
Sounds like you just have good luck 
---
Cheers. Appreciate that as I'm a little pissed off at min. Currently posting this to all the you tubers 
---
1)Playing on Xbox One
---
2) Gamertag: ChrisB OMG
---
3) [Video Evidence of it eating my Chest Piece](https://clips.twitch.tv/CloudyPhilanthropicGazelleSmoocherZ) 
---
4) The Machine that takes the ingredients in the quest Feed The People ate my Armor for some reason. I have included a video on it above it was my Level 50 2 Star Legendary Chameleon Chest Piece with +1 INT. It feels really bad to lose such a quality item to a glitch, and as you can see in the video My 2 Star Legendary Power Fist was next on the ol' chopping block.
---
5) I haven't opened a ticket with bethesda, is that something they could do something about? I know usually inventory stuff like that isn't something they can usually address. Is this something that I could possibly get back  [u/lonevaultwanderer](https://www.reddit.com/u/lonevaultwanderer) ? Honestly losing that last night has really killed my drive to play anymore.
---
Someone's a Moorcock fan. ;)
---
They've been saying that since fucking BETA though...
---
You guys don't give a fuck about feedback. You work for a corporate overlord. If you fucking cared you wouldn't have released this shit show of a game before it was actually ready. Get bent assholes. You've hit the last nail in the coffin.
---
I won't regrind another character just to play this mode that will be shit either way. 
---
Do you really think even with a fresh characters that this won't be a shitshow from day one? Maybe maybe the first week isn't that bad but then the power users will always get ahead. This game is so damn unbalanced people will be one shotted regardless. 
---
Finally an actual suggestion for pvp that makes sense! Sick of all the no cross characters between game modes and the people saying cancel survival. This can be good to stop griefing if everything else is kept the same. Either do that or nerf legendary effects for survival or the like.
---
I do this, but Nuke somewhere at the end for that extra 100 caps. 
---
That and I feel like I'm doing a service to the lower levels :)
---
I think Bethesda thought what could be the cheapest, easiest new “content” they could make
---
You’re welcome.  Sometimes I have to run along the wall inside the gazebo to find it.  It’s so small if you blink you’ll miss it:)
---
choosy beggars lol
---
LOL troll!?!?
---
sounds about right!
---
The double radius perk you are reffering to from perception doesn't work on missle launchers. It is called grenadier and it only works on trowable grenades. Doesn't work with explossive bullets, missle launchers, fatmans not even with grenade launchers. People including me tested them.
---
See here's the thing on this. They're SUPPOSED to be devestatingly potent weapons of nastyness. and yet...
---
600 lbs of stuff and you can carry 249 so a total of 849 
---
I believe it’s their first step regarding separation of PVP vs PVE.  The griefing is getting on PVE-ers nerves, Bethesda’s bread and butter.  
---
They have new content in the works (have to to keep PVE going); let’s see what happens.  
---
And yet this isn’t supposed to take until March just to be in Beta?
---
Best post on Reddit, thank you.
---
Yeah there's different types of nodes
---
Fallout 3 and New Vegas didn't have PvP concerns. If you bump the power of these weapons, there will be PvP implications.
---
Not saying they don't need a bump, but doing so can have other impacts.
---
Survival Mode is a massive misfire. FO76 launched on thin ice and Bethesda has been stomping around on it for months now.
---
Also disable PvP or have a true opt out EXCEPT when in workshop radius on Adventure.
---
Exactly! 
---
OK well I hope you sent *him* the above message instead of projecting it onto me. I'm guessing you didn't though... 
---
I have no idea why would they design slap damage as scaling. It's just plain stupid. Why not make it a flat number that cannot be scaled, so all this one-shotting could be avoided? It's a solution so fucking easy I just can't even fathom why aren't they doing it. 
---
I believe Starfield is coming first and then ES6. 
---
November 2018 to November 2019 will be filled with FO76 bug fixes, new content, private servers, mod support, etc.  It may run longer due to the release issues.
---
Assuming they get dug in on Starfield in November or so 2019, it should be ready for release, baring incidents, in 4th quarter 2022, plus or minus a year or so.
---
Allowing for another year or so of bug fixes, DLC, new content, etc. for Starfield sees them starting serious development of ES6 in 4th quarter 2023 to 2-24.
---
Allowing another 3 years (plus or minus a year or so) of development before release and we should be seeing ES6 in 3rd to 4th quarter 2026 to 2028.
---
Basically a decade (or 2-3 console generations) from now.
---
Everyone is an enemy. Why would there be a wanted system?
---
If Bethesda manages to close off all current exploit ways before implementing survival there will be no way any dupers/exploiters would be in that mode if a fresh start is mandatory.
---
Yes in a months time after implementing survival it will be full of high level players but it will be legit high level people, not ones who have the edge by having duped items but people who have earned those items legitimately by finding them in the game. There would be alot less sentinel or tse's around because the only reason there are tons of them at the moment is because of the dupers.
---
Any new player starting even with these high levels would stand more chance of surviving with legit highers than they ever would if they just allowed the dupers to transfer their player from adventure mode 
---
I get that it's a looter shooter, my gripe is it's more of a quicky cashgrab than a modernized take on a classic genre that has no guidance except push the atom shop and buy our crappy overpriced merch.
---
I just look for cans. It doesn't allow me to craft ridiculous amounts of ammo like this but I don't really see the need to have 7 K rounds around. I just hit up the prison, ski resorts, random other assorted dungeons for the tin-can alarms. One small trip provides enough base ingredients to create bullets to last a few adventures.
---
Tedium
---
it duped due to open doors, that "glitch" has been around for a long time.  
---
I think we should just give Bethesda a bit of a break they are doing their best trying to please us and take our thoughts into consideration and all we do is get angry at them. We all just need to wait until the beta or whenever it comes out to judge it. And I know Bethesda does want out feedback but we don’t have to be mean to them, their trying to give us stuff we might like and we just get upset. You are right on all of those things, 120% right but I think they are trying their best and I appreciate every single bit of it I absolutely love this game, issues and all. 
---
My dragon glitched out on me couple weeks ago. 
---
It turned into a semi auto dragon.  To bad i didnt notice it sooner.  Lol. 
---
https://youtu.be/IfcXRxLMnOw.  Starts about 1min in.  
---
Switch from my handmade to dragon locked 10 rounds in my dragon and was semi auto
---
20-30% CPU utilization doesn't actually tell us much on a processor that has 8 threads.  One thread could be pegged, while the other 7 are basically idle.  You need to look at the utilization of each thread and each core.  Open hardware monitor can help you see what each thread and core is doing.
---
Regardless, if your GPU is pegged at 99-100%, your not likely to get more FPS without lowering resolution or quality.  There maybe some 3d settings that could help.
---
Also, since your on a laptop, look at your power settings.  Your system could be trying to conserve power, and that could be slowing things down.
---
This reply might be cute if it weren't for the fact the thread i'm referring to is also the #1 upvoted thread in this community. Don't be silly and play a "oh it dropped this many numbers" game with me. 
---
if BSG or whomever is running F76 don't understand what the playerbase wants, or doesn't want to give it to us, why the fuck would anyone *else* want to spend the money on this game? So they could be disrespected too? No, it's clear they do not know a thing about their market, or just don't care about my money, which is fine-- i can spend my cash somewhere else. 
---
Sure, should work. If I got the bin/hex conversion right, you parameter should be 'FC0' instead of 'FC'. This would set FA76 to the last 6 logic processors. If you could check with the task manager and let me know if that was the correct value.
---
Yeah someone destroyed my base, after I repaired all I had 4x large purifiers stored. I could place em down, but couldn't connect wires to em because I guess they take up space... 
---
Better yet make it so you can combine them into a bigger base
---
That's a lot of stuff then!
---
Most of which would be used up when I craft.
---
I stopped reading after level scaling... Fucking carebear mode.  What's the point.  
---
Lol rekt
---
Doesn't mean they wont
---
How can I identify which is which?
---
Or do I have to wait until it drops?
---
That's the point of PvP mode, pve players won't touch it at all.  Good.  I don't want pve players deciding on how PvP mode works.
---
I love both pve and PvP. Having a choice of play style on how im feeling is only a bonus.  
---
Oh god plz no this game is already too easy
---
Doesn't mean they will either...
---
So can I get it to do it again on a friends account? I'll live stream the glitch in action until I'm unbanned if that's what it will take. 
---
&gt; there will be PvP implications.
---
Well, with the current meta only being two shot explosive weapons, would adding a new category of weaponry really be that big of a deal?
---
It's not like buffed missile launchers will ever do more damage than a TSE shotgun. Maybe after they nerf TSE, but still, a missile launcher *should* do more damage than a shotgun... more damage than most if not all guns to be honest, its a freaking missile launcher with 1lb ammo.
---
Its not projecting anything onto you, i was simply responding to your comment but ok nps :)
---
And no i waited to see where his camp was attacked it and killed him and took his screws when he was silly enough to attack me :)
---
amen.
---
Sorry, didn't know still lots of fun though as i use throwables as well as the launchers.
---
Carnivore is way better because of Cannibal and Ionized Meat
---
As much as I would want this. I also see how doing so would create more PR problems for Bethesda then it would solve.
---
To many irrational people. 
---
ou just enter build mode in other peoples camps, and it comes from your own mats? 
---
Wowser, can feel a new way to freak people while also being nice coming on....
---
You get about 80 scrap lead from hitting the Charleston Fire Dept, which seems to be one of the better ones.  Hitting Lucky Hole with an excavator is closer to 800 after processing with Super Duper I think.
---
You're right, it's night and day.
---
Awesome!  BUT ... I won't be deleting my spreadsheet until I'm sure this new feature is accurate and not 'bugged'.
---
Yes, use steel doors, leave them open, move camp and it will duplicate you camp as many times and doors you left open.  There is a YouTube video on it.
---
You are an idiot rofl. Everyone who's not playing like you is a tedious tryhard? Having quality of life mods that SHOULD be in the game is cheating? GTFO
---
And how many perk points does that total? Also, don’t forget bear arms if you ever plan to loot anything.
---
Hello. I attempted to make this post on this subject a while back. But i was new to reddit and auto mod took it away. Forgot til now. So speed modding perks all are broken. The only things that work are speed demon and pairing it with stacked stranger in numbers. Thats all. Nothing else is increasing speed atm ad they are definately bugged. I ran a control with clan mates over the red bridge east of watoga station
---
Interesting how you would mention OG Ultima Online, then fail to mention two important things:.if you die, everything could be looted from your corpse and there was absolutely no killing in town - it was autocratic to the attacker.
---
Seriously, this.  One pass through Lucky Hole + the above-mentioned perks yielded enough lead for a little over 5000 rounds of 5.56.
---
OGM hilarious. 
---
Underthat logic, no application would ever get improvements. LOL. 
---
Having never played hockey, I will have to take your word for it. I did play baseball and was a catcher. I know my skull cap stunk to high heaven. I liked my old school setup being able to pull my mask but keeping my skull cap on. It started in practice after getting beaned by a ball when 4 people decided to throw in at the same time. 
---
Thanks dude 
---
Yeah I remember doing that at like level 40, that was a waste of 40 caps to complete that mission. The small generator makes 3 power, the medium generator makes 5, the large makes 10, the windmill makes 20, and the fusion generator make 100 power. It gets pretty useful because I have around 6 purifiers making 60 water an hour each for me because I give some away and the purifiers somehow got duplicated. My psn is Blackdog2774 if you want me to give you some of the excess material I dont want or if you need help on any missions. 
---
Got my first one in my entire Fallout playing life a few weeks ago. My cousin, who didn't realize how rare they were, was not impressed as much as I was.
---
I feel like a couple missles should drop a cargobot. 
---
Large part of this subreddit.  I'm on Xbox and PC.  About 80% of people I've teamed with want more PvP and to remove the slap system.  
---
This isn't traditional fallout.  This isn't coop fallout.  This is multiplayer fallout.  Almost every gamer expects PvP in a multiplayer game.
---
+Karma
---
I use an Instigating Grognak's Axe and a 2 star Hatchet that does +40% damage on power swing and ignores 50% of targets armor, but still use All Rise as well. 
---
Also the "Line in the Sand" event at the Asylum gives you a few.. be warned of higher level enemies and some scorchbeasts.
---
Yeah, you're projecting your annoyance at this other dude at me and assuming I was doing it to annoy him. When I wasn't, and anyone who read the whole thing could tell that. 
---
That 2nd paragraph speaks volumes about you though.
---
r/Iamverybadass 
---
So what you're saying is...there's a way? I'd like to explore this more.
---
So you believe the best part of the game is the inventory management?
---
I just hate having to constantly deal with the inventory.  I wouldn't mind mob encounters being harder(somehow, just not bullet sponge). But dealing with the inventory is what has made me loathe to log into the game regularly.
---
Also, you wouldn't have to play Pansy mode, just as you wouldn't have to play Survival.  This would be to give people more options.  I just assume they want more people to play the game, and I think reducing the headache of inventory would get them there a lot faster.
---
I don’t know, I thought it couldn’t either but OP said it can. 
---
Oh yeah, she's watched me play both, haha. I've tried to get her into them and she enjoys the story aspect of the games, but the thing we both love about fo76 is that we get to play together, in the same world.
---
If there is ever a fo4 mod or dlc that allowed multiplayer, that would be heaven.
---
If you're on PC and want someone to hang out with, add me - ign: stonekraken. I'm lvl 94, have a camp I'm pretty happy with, and I'm happy to answer any questions as they come up
---
Yep. The Elder Scrolls Online actually does, funnily enough.
---
Brain holder
---
Vault 76 is *the* vault. It's the one they advertised to shareholders and people, so it's built up to look like the best vault-tec could possibly offer. I believe this gets mentioned in Fallout 3.
---
Don't worry - if they had the resources to fix minor bugs like this in a timely fashion, this game would be *much* better currently.
---
We're still getting 3 month old simple fix bugs and like three to five minor fixes per patch. You won't have to worry that your exploit will be taken care of until months down the road.
---
**IF** they close off all the exploits. That's a big damn if, considering they've barely touched the existing ones. No game ever properly eliminates exploits because people *always* find a new way to cheat. You're goal is nice but ultimately moot.
---
And they wouldn't have to survive those early levels every time if they could do the main quests in Adventure Mode and then join a Survival server, which seems to be the intended goal, since most Players won't want to grind a new character all the way back up just so they can do some PvP.
---
No clean slate means literally everyone can check  out and play the new mode without being immediately overpowered by anyone that got a head start on them because they're forced back to level 1 and naked.
---
I’m on a strict canned dog food diet 
---
I pretty much had exactly this build as my first one. Thought the AGL will erase everything but the next to me is some asshat with a tse doing 1k dmg without any perks. Or better yet 500dmg and 80round drum mag shooting rapid rife projectiles that are instant. The original explo weapons are just nowhere near the output that some other weapons have. Should the 40mm be more endgame than the .45? :D it's ridiculous.
---
Or R1 + L1 on ps4.
---
They could just keep the inventory and camp of adventure and survival mode separate. It's the easiest solution. Legendary effects could also be null on survival mode. Fights should last more that 2 hits. 
---
That's how you know it's working
---
Yea no. I’ve known that for awhile. 
---
Yeah that's me!  I've been on Xbox for a few weeks ...long story. Good to hear from you Enigma!! 😛👍✌️
---
I like taking my time with the game and not going heavy into XP farming, but this is the one area where it annoys me. I'm level 25 so 9 more levels for ammosmith and a whopping 25 for Super Duper. And it's not just ammo. Need a suppressor for my handmade rifle? Time to scavenge like crazy for the junk to make them. I really don't mind that much but it feels like it can take forever to get the resources for 200 rounds.
---
I don't even spend much time on inventory management I float around 450/500. Sounds like your tryna keep all useless stuff you'll never use. 
---
Go play FO4 if you wanna keep everything little thing you come across.
---
I never said the best part is inventory management as I never manage it consciously.
---
if they nerfed unyielding to +1, that's +5 in total. add +1 strength to each piece, that's another +5. +5 from radicool and +6 from whiskey + party boy/girl. +2 from X-cell. 38 strength in total. 2 shy off 40 like I said originally, and I'm sure I'm missing stuff. not to mention bobbleheads and SiN.
---
so yeah, you're pretty much hurting every other bloodied build (since the idea is trading surviveability for damage) while melee stays relatively unscathed.
---
absolutely genius.
---
You literally said "weapons that could be removed from the game and no one would be bothered".....
---
I'm disagreeing. Even in their current state, people would be bothered missing those.
---
Yes..  yes you can.  :)
---
Also - sirens.
---
You can actually mine the resources yourself without an extractor, it's just that the extractors can mine it while you're gone
---
90s kids whaddup
---
For some reason you BGS guys are thinking of transforming this game into a Battle Royale or Fortnite type of quasi-hybrid PVE game but it can never work, it's like trying to create an electric car with onboard diesel generators to charge up the batteries, just doesn't mesh or even makes sense.
---
Just....stop.  Do the right smart current thing and FAIL FAST instead of a slllllloowwwww lingering death, and fix PVE.  Once you fix PVE just totally split the game into 2 seperate unconnected entities as you've already suggested, PVE/Adventure (PVE only, remove all existing PVP) &amp; PVP/Survival (PVE w/ no rules PVP), their own logon, their own systems etc
---
Net effect....win!
---
Dude you dont even know that the chems are not stacking talking bout I'm lying. You even play the game or you just thinking bout it? I told you about my experience of crafting TWO different sets having 15 and 35 INT. And it's how I said it is. 
---
Free states as well
---
Ah, thats why Ive never noticed iy, only team up to trade fast travel...
---
That's no bug...
---
That was a gift from the gods...
---
Crazy stuff 
---
No, most of us did not. Most of us predicted it would suck. I hate multiplayer and hate PvP more.
---
You're spot on. I spend 75% of my gaming time playing competitive games. Mostly Overwatch and used to play Fortnite. I have 0 desire to play Fallout 76 as a competitive game. The game mechanics are terrible for it. And it's not even what makes this game attractive. This game is literally the publisher developing by the numbers. It's pretty sad. I haven't touched the game in a month, hoping patches and updates will fix things. But instead they are making PvP mode? So stupid. 
---
This is a good idea.
---
How is that hilarious? This is what the sold people? You’re saying the game isn’t broken when there are hundreds of examples of it clearly being broken. What logic are you stating that would keep things from being fixed?
---
Theres that, too. Which is...concerning.
---
And trees. Some can be moved and some cant
---
Play another game then.
---
Oh goteeeeem
---
You’ve wasted a lot of your time trying to argue if my estimation was wrong you know that right? And you can clearly tell by how I state it, with the “or more” right after, implying it is an estimation, because factual information doesn’t have a or to it, it just is what it is. But like most people you like to nitpick to think you’re something or somebody or just to sound like you know something.
---
You clearly had nothing to contribute to this post so why bother, just another person that disagrees but does so by trying to make me look bad or inferior or disapprove what I’m saying when it literally is all, A OPINION.
---
I got stuck with herbivore, but honestly I dont mind it. It's really convenient, especially because you can grow crops. Free fast travel to camp, harvest some crops, pick up some purified water. Rinse and repeat.
---
No he is right i actually ran an experiment. My 15 agility fully lvled and perked pistol medic build doesnt run faster then a lvl 2 with no specials added.
---
Mind you i have Gun Runner while wielding a pistol (+20% movement speed while holding pistol). Zero effect vs the lvl 2. When we run across the same span of land in controlled tests i am unable to gain ground vs him when we run. Therefore my perk wasnt working. If i was to repeat this test with speed demon i can. So spd demon works.
---
Hopefully they fix this. Another thing is philanthropist doesnt register with cannibal which kinda half shoots down my medic pistol build. However i can use normal food too 
---
Oh oops, goes to show how many I've found...
---
We are playing in TEST MODE, that Survival mode is the SURVIVAL MODE
---
I am probably bugged, as I have 2 rifles, 3 melee (two are less than 3 pounds each), my armor, aid, and ammo.
---
I've reduced my ammo to less than 500 of the stuff I use, and have dropped everything else.  I don't pick up junk anymore, rarely pick up weapons or armor, and only pick them up if there's a workstation nearby. I do have 30 pounds of power armor, as I decided to carry the rare sets instead of putting them in storage.
---
I don't carry useless stuff.
---
Truth, and when bear arms applied to the auto grenade launcher, it was my default whitespring nuke loadout.  Turn on pacifist mode, spam every fhoul spawn with grenades, reap legendaries.  With a little luck, you can even get low flying scorchbeasts that way.
---
I wouldn't turn the station immediately...
---
I’m on PC too! Add me: philipoos, or discord: Pochi#6483
---
That doesnt change that he has access too the same tier of stuff potentially. Yes he likely has better stuff and perk set up at a higher level. But anyone at level 50 has the same potential of someone at 289.... yes. The 289 almost guaranteed has better gear then you, has better perk loadout then you and what not... but the level 50 isn't at a disadvantage as to what he has available. At level 50 you can use all of the strongest possible weapons and armor, have the same number of special points, and I do believe all perk cards are available at 50.
---
Mofo you are correct.  They needed a game to tap into the live service market.  Fallout was the most logical choice of IP they could transfer. 
---
It has the blueprints of a fortnite model.  Atim shop is very close to the shop in fortnite.  They are time limiting some items to create artificial rarity.  I'm willing to bet the blackbird skin will be seen as og, just like the black knight in fortnite.  
---
The atom challenges have dailies and weeklies to unlock the currency although most live service games have this.  I'd argue they should have separated quests/story from the online version.  I have coop 4 man teams for the quests.  Once completed an online multiplayer mode.  Like gta or rdr2.  
---
But now the choice of adventure and survival mode parallels to fortnites save the world and battle Royale. PvP mode will trounce pve as it always has in every other game I can think of.  Players here are worried about that and I get it.  
---
Whatever though, it's going to be interesting.
---
THIS! SO MUCH THIS! My house is kinda perfect, EXCEPT theres grass in my first floor hallway! Its fucking annoying! When they announced the bulldozer thing, I thought this would have got addressed!
---
It turns out I am, as I don't like dealing with the inventory.
---
If the inventory mess was solved, I'd almost certainly play again.
---
&gt;WE NEED more endgame PvE content.
---
This. They will lose their playerbase on a whole b/c of lack of content. Whatever is still left, might consider a survival mode but I doubt it, since servers will eventually be pretty barren. 
---
They need to wait for at least a year to introduce a new game mode, we need new content before playerbase starts hemorrhaging. 
---
I have no idea what this means.
---
I guess you didn't read inside the vault.  Unless I misunderstood it, you will be able to take current characters into the game.  So me and my lvl 217 character will have free reign to shit all over 90% of those in it.  Wow, that sounds like sooooo much fun, esp for that 90%.  No...not at all.  This new survival should be a clean slate, start from scratch type of deal.  It will be a complete disaster in it's current model.  
---
So you only put in 2 or so hours into the game? No? You have over 100?
---
Good luck proving that you didn't get your money's worth, lol.
---
In another note, I'd bet a kidney (not both) that your post is bullshit and you have a convenient scapegoat for the fact that you have or had *actual* duped items. In other words, yes you have proof that your base duplicated itself. Great. That doesn't prove that you *didn't* duplicate otherwise. But you do, admittedly, have proof that you used the duplicated base instead of simply storing/scraping/reporting it. That is also against the TOS.
---
If you're telling the whole truth, good luck with your case. If not, good riddance, douche!
---
I have almost the same exact specs, I have an Acer nitro 5 and the game runs just fine in high, also never play without plugging in your laptop, as it runs on low power if you're on battery.
---
One thing that garantees 60fps consistently is lowering the shadow settings, lighting is the most heavy thing I've seen my laptop take.
---
On a final note, consider checking your Nvidia drivers, they've launched a few updates, and the GeForce experience app could be setting your game on ultra high. Overall, don't expect too much performance since it is an entry level gfx card.
---
Right, but TSE's are being nerfed for that very reason (well, and because they make PvE challenge impossible to balance for both the have and have-nots).
---
Agreed that these weapons should be the most powerful in the game (particularly, as you point out, given the weight of the ammo), but it doesn't mean we should have another overpowered weapon just because we already have them in the form of TSEs.
---
Do you use any weight reduction perks? Do you bulk junk and sell excess? (Anything over 10 bulk is too much imo unless your stockpiling to make loads of ammo or something)
---
see ya
---
Daily events and taking over workshops is decent XP, you also get a few plans in the process.
---
All of the perk points, especially if you want to be immune to your own explosions. Still a lot of fun and I do recomend trying it if you have the time.
---
What endgame? 
---
The queen? 
---
Nah, TSE rifles/shotguns/gatling/miniguns are still a better option for the Queen. 
---
Yeah, I know. It can suck but hop back on that horse and work on laying low (crouched) somewhere nearby but out of sight. Just make sure to store all your junk first. The dirt track over by the big ferris wheel in the forest is a good one for this. I've lost a few caps to someone who clearly just wanted to PvP and wasn't at all interested in the workshop, but not before I got some great plans I was looking for. Again, relog after you get them so that you give up the workshop.
---
Only time I used a missle was against a scorchbeast. Then I realized it was awful (I know they are explosive resistant) and just dropped it afterwards. Missle launchers are good scrap material though. 
---
Best tip I can offer is make sure your camps us some we're south west of vault 76. Seeing as you can fast travel for free to your camp and vault 76 is really helps reduce fast travel costs. 
---
Yeah that’s what I’ve been doing with the one near deathclaw island. Think I’m gona stick with that for a bit.
---
Yup, I can do math. And nope, didn’t ask or care for your random redditor opinion. I spent a lot of time afk’ing workshops. But if you’d like we can go ahead and start comparing lives so I can show you how likely pathetic yours is?
---
This I can get behind. 
---
This happens on every platform and sounds to be uncommon
---
The only solution I seem to have is to restart your gamer or maybe to wait about ~20 secs before pressing anything
---
Hell yeah, I want a gold plated AK. They should also add a DE 50 cal so I can gold plate that.
---
Dog food and purified water. With 2 perks I pop one of each and I'm good to go. 
---
Ah that’s true I agree then 
---
Anti armor with no other armor reduction effects is about 28.6% more damage. If two-shot goes down to 25%, but maintains the accuracy debuff, anti-armor outclasses it baseline both in damage and in accuracy. But if you’ve got armor reduction perks, and especially also if you have perks AND weapon mag armor piercing, it gets less useful. The math will depend on how much other armor piercing you already have
---
I could not agree more. Everyone is scared of lvl 200's going into survival with newbies, but what happens when the more dedicated players become lvl 200 on their own? Level balancing is of course great, but I think the best gaming experience for everyone would be to have different servers based on levels.  
---
For example, once you reach level  20, you have to go to a new server for players that are level 20-40. Unless you are extremely lucky, you're not going to have a crazy arsenal of legendary weapons with which one might murder newbies until well after level 20. Level 40, same thing.   
---
The level brackets are debatable, but that would be the only way to separate higher-level characters from lower-level ones.
---
I carry no junk on me, as i've got enough of everything in storage.  I don't pick up junk at all, not even to sell.
---
Exactly, Frontier Development did this for Elite Dangerous and it increased transparency and helped them understand better the players' needs.
---
This was a post I made earlier this morning (before anyone was awake I think): 
---
Please do not build a new PvP mode around the current campaign. 
---
The map is beautiful. The regions are inspired and feel unique. There are already workshops set up that ostensibly should be valuable. 
---
We should have a faction system with alternate start locations depending on your choice. Want to be a raider? Top of the World. Want to be a member of the BoS? Defiance. (These could be moved slightly as long as they loosely follow the story.) 
---
You could even add a “Lone Wanderer” option for people who truly want a lone wolf experience. Everyone is flagged hostile and they get a hermits cabin in the woods or something. 
---
Each stronghold should only be assailable during certain events so that new players have a hub full of allies who can party with them/help them get started. 
---
Make players of the same faction visible on the map. Hide everyone else. Show region control. (Split regions into subregions along workshop lines.)
---
Incentivize workshops so the different factions actually have a reason to do battle with one another. 
---
Increase the server population (by a lot) so that players of different factions actually run into one-another. 
---
I WANT A SERVER LIST. Sure, make it its own button underneath so the user-experience of clicking “Play” and being dropped into the world is preserved, but many people who have been playing for a while want to... rebuild the wasteland. No ability to create/join specific servers makes it really hard to form a community. 
---
This is especially important for the health of faction-based PvP. The tryhards can all group up. The role players can role play. It’s worked very well for other games and it should work here. 
---
Players should be able to invest in their stronghold on their chosen server with the resources they’ve gained from workshops to improve the stronghold and craft valuable items. 
---
I’m on mobile. That’s all I’m typing for now! I very much agree with the post on the front page right now about the loot table being uninspired and weapons poorly balanced. That’s a prerequisite for any compelling PvP mode.
---
Come on People, surely you must all love the thrill of trying to power Possidon only for it to disconnect... I love it when you start to do it on your own and it and it gives you 18Minutes to complete it... Then if you fail it restarts the mission almost immediately and gives you an hour... Then just as you near the end you get (controls disabled servers not responding)... Then it reconnects then disables again and reconnects and you notice chunks of time disappear!! It just sets you up beautifully for the final bork and that God awful din in your ears as you reset to console homepage ❤️🤪❤️🤪❤️🤪❤️🤪❤️🤪
---
All aboard the murder train.
---
Ya fast travel should be disabled for sure. Would prevent the stupidity of someone getting beat in an engagement then porting to your base after from some where near by and ghosting you at your base. 
---
On top of that need to disable seeing other players on map aside from team/clan mates
---
I don't believe you will, but OK.
---
Psn aiky1313
---
Nice, should have plenty of time to complete your set before the beta
---
yeah that would work, but the way I see it is, survival mode is a end game server, adventure is where you complete quests, level up, and gear grind until your ready to take the step up into a competitive environment, 
---
The Dragon is a quad barrel musket which only uses one round
---
Because griefers have never touched a real live female. 
---
Okay but not every potential new player is on this Sub, because why the hell would 99% of non-players be here to see this? Hell I doubt most Players are on Reddit to voice their opinion at all. So why should they take this sub to be the entire voice for Players?
---
Non-players aren't going to know the exact ways the game currently sucks, so announced changes are gonna be a bigger away for them. They aren't here to see BGS "not listening" to people at any given moment. Just because some people are here and very vocal, doesn't mean that they represent the majority of sales, potential or real.
---
I feel like people here forget that most video game sales are to casual gamers. People who have disposable income to drop on whatever titles catch their eye, and that they might only play the game for a few hours a week, and stop playing regularly after a few months. They don't have to do shit to keep those Players happy because they never get that mad in the first place. And they're much more lucrative because they just buy a copy and require no additional work on the part of BGS except to try to find more people like them to sell to.
---
My character can be logged in to and viewed. Nothing to see my friend. I'm a war pensioner who use this game as a pss time and mainly do Base building. So keep you insults to yourself.  
---
100% this. Bethesda need to seize the narrative from shit-talking YouTubers and give the people who have stuck by the game a reason to be excited and hyped for the future. Right now we have nothing apart from Survival, which had gone down like a lead balloon and some hints at vault dungeons coming at some point in the next year. Hardly the living world Beth was hinting at in pre-release.  
---
I am about 150 hours in and basically done everything, end game is dropping nukes and hoping not to be booted from the server before you can get any reward from the nuke. With a road map there will be reason to get hyped and we need hype if the games going to survive. It's a good game but can Bethesda seem intent in killing it off before it can even get going. 
---
You just said what sold the game was because it was promised that it would never freeze, force close or shut down your console. I missed all of those promises when researching all I could about the game before it came out, so I could decide if I wanted to play it or not.
---
Sorry, my conclusion is that the loudest people making the biggest claims about the game crashing are either exaggerating or flat out lying. Yup. And I've even had people admit, they were exaggerating about the amount of crashes.
---
Are all people exaggerating or lying. Nope. But when someone wants you to believe they crashed 47 times in one day. You have to wonder if that person really sat there for hours and hours and hours trying to play a game that kept crashing over and over. They refused to say how many hours they played. But if it was in one day, that would mean they were crashing around every half hour. So they spent a whole day doing that? Sounds unlikely. 
---
So yes. I call bullshit on those kind of claims. 
---
Of course, let's also ignore all the people saying the game is running much smoother now. Nope those all must be fanbois right? 
---
I've been saying this since duping started.
---
They also should watch and ban people duping in YT videos. Hell EPIC games started suing people for posting YT videos of cheats.
---
The least they could do is ban people spreading these exploits.
---
Other then tagging high level stuff...quests seem to give best exp combined with crafting your face off and killing everything along the way.
---
If solo...
---
Supermutants can be tough for low level non max/min builds to grind since they can be bullet sponges.
---
I meant like aid reduction. I kit around like 230 stims on me instead of using storage for them as maxed out weight reduction makes them 0.10 saves up  a lot of stash
---
I wouldn't say I'm done, but it definitely curtails my motivation to keep playing, suspecting that nothing will really change until March.  I don't regret the 150+ hours I spent with it, I had a good time, but it is disappointing to see a mode that I suspect only a small minority of players actually care about getting all this attention while pretty much everyone agrees that the game, especially the endgame, needs more content.
---
You can easily kill them in either 1 or 2 shots/hits with the right weaponry (So killing a Super Mutant with one single 5.56 and receiving 5 or 6 of them back is a good way to farm ammo) and perk and it's a really good place to farm legendaries, steel (Scrap their weapons), potential weapons to sell (Assault Rifles go for a lot at vendors), caps, exp and ammo. And since they don't drop .308 much (And neither do the ghouls at Whitespring) you kind of get why people are saying it's a rare-ish farm that's also hard to craft compared to others. 
---
Where/when did they say they're increasing damage resistance for enemies? I have apparently missed that.
---
Bloodied Penis....
---
This post and the replies and approval rating are proof that a majority of the players are PvE and agree with me. Nice try though 
---
Like what ? I might have missed some.
---
"Bounty tokens buy cool gun skins? " - the guy high fives his buddy who has let him kill him 50 times for some tokens.
---
"These weapons are mechanically inferior. There are 4 melee weapons that are useful in the endgame. Deathclaw gauntlet, power fist, grognaks axe (legendary only), and super sledge. " - as a pure melee char you are talking bollocks there. Mole Miner gauntlet is close to the same damage as deathclaw gauntlet and power fist. There are also plenty of weapons in that list that can be viable and useful even at high level, whether weapon artisaned or with the right mods from a dps point of view.
---
Totally agree with this. AND the note that players not teamed up with you aren't shown on the map is a seriously good point. How in the hell would you know where someone you don't know is in a "real life" situation? Are you psychic? Are you a wizard, Harry? No? Then you only know where people are who would feasibly have a walkie talkie programed to your frequency.   
---
I guess you didnt read my post. Quote:"My biggest wish for this mode is though, that we have to create new  characters and cant take our adventure characters with us to survival  mode. "
---
Bethesda has reacted fairly well to feedback so far. Many changes we wished for were made, and I hope that if we are vocal enough we get the clean slate. 
---
Someone is forgetting the sneak multiplier, melee gods, assassin/sentinel sets, etc.
---
I wish I did.  I have two lowbie alts I want to level for different builds, but basically I just log in, kill a few nothings and clear a workshop to get 20 caps then change chars.
---
You are now bashing people because Bethesda wanted to implement a new feature and let people use their characters in said feature.
---
Im neither for or against separating the toons. I reached godhood in my main and I'd love to put him in action. I'm also completely fine with making a new toon specially for PvP, which would be kind of bummer as my current level 200 toon has been designed with PvP in mind back in beta. It took me lots of work, a considerable amount of luck, lots of wits and lots of trading to reach where I am, I am fine with letting people who did not put so much heart into the game play on a more leveled field, and to have outputs of my work taken away from me. I just wont accept the way you shit over it.
---
 I am completely against this rethoric that you have used here, and I consider this extremely selfish and entitled approach.
---
Run around do events. Kill everything and dont die
---
we don't care if you come back or not. bye.
---
Everyone will be immediately overpowered though? How is it fair for anyone playing the new mode if these exploiters or people who have bought duped sets of sentinel have joined right from the get go? It would be as bad as if starting new or worse 
---
I seriously don't understand people's reluctance to start fresh, I understand many have grinded to get to the level they are now but alot of others have used exp exploits to get that high and used cap exploits to buy OP gear off dupers.
---
I can understand finding all the plans again would be a serious pain in the arse, maybe if Bethesda allowed all learnt plans be transferable to any new character created just like the atom shop items do
---
I played fo4 400hours only melee and didnt even know about explosive or 2 shot effects lol. That's all new to me, all of the balistic weapon effects
---
Welch also always has a decent number (10 or so?) scattered around in it. Good spot because you can also check the vendor for rare plans and mods. (Very rare excavator mods can be found there sometime. Keep an eye out for a mod that doesn’t say what it goes on, and scraps for black titanium- that’s an excavator PA mod
---
To be fair, when I looked, they all said ‘7h’. My bad, and I am sorry your post was stolen and the other posts were upvoted more. 
---
But you sir specifically stated that more PvE elements were to be including with the PvP patch. Changing your tune now?
---
Just be vague and give ideas and not dates. I get what you mean tho, I have seen communities flip their lid big time when a dev promise ended up being a day or two late!
---
Thought I'd missed one out but couldn't remember which one lol 
---
Dense chest mod and Fireproof should stop this, at least if they are not stacking bobbleheads.
---
tents in the world can also be destroyed. I was at some campground one time, and a glowing yao guai came charging after me out of nowhere. I hid behind the closest thing I could find, which happened to be a tent.. Two swipes from that darn bear, made that tent explode, and scared the crap out of me. it didn't end well
---
Yes then I could start stocking up on chems and become a wastelord druglord.
---
So I don't play FO76. It's been too fun watching the... fallout, from how bad of a job they did on it.
---
But I will speak up about this issue... devs hate telling players what's planned. Shit changes. You might be working on one thing for 3 months and then it gets scrapped for some reason but you use assets and features from what you worked on in another aspect that seems way more interesting and fun (or just doable).
---
So I would be totally understanding if Todd and his team just ignored this request of yours. Because it's an awful thing for everyone.
---
That is greeeeat
---
I don't know man, launchers should be OP, and I feel like them weighing a fuck ton with the same going for the ammo offsets it's destructive capabilities.
---
I don't have any stims in storage, and believe I have 20 or less on me. Also have 15 or fewer of rad-away, rad-x and diluted rad-x.
---
I dont' have any weight reduction perks.  But not carrying any junk, and only having modest amounts of aid on me, it's not going to get me under my weight threshold.
---
Yes exactly that :) Changed some settings in their config file and database to enable and disable some stuff, added some flags to the database to track the mode things are coming from, reused the code they have to drop the aid, check the mode to hide the pacifist setting, added to the click event in the main menu to pick the mode which is the only thing that will be new but even that is a simple task. The only thing I'm unsure of is the server stuff but I don't see that being complicated either.
---
Carno is waaay better. You just find an animal with meat. Kill it and tada if it drops 2 pieces ur food is 100% practically
---
Morgantown. Three regular events and one nearby workshop. Can't miss.
---
You fucking casual, you are not real gamer, real gamers dont have time for reddit, they are to busy recting noobs in games 
---
P.s. This message was written by my normie friend, who I recently pwned. I cut it on his chest with my golden limited edition MLG pro gaming Razer knife so he can post it on reddit, because I dont have time for casuals like you, pretending they are real hardcore gamers. 
---
I’m convinced this dude is just a troll 
---
That makes sense, I did notice the marks on the compass. Unfortunately, that would be even less useful than intended since the power armor compass is still bugged for me. Time to find a new helmet mod. Thank you
---
YES PLEASE DONT DO THIS BETHESDA. 
---
The day it launches, all the lvl 180+ people will just go straight to survival and camp outside of Vault 76 with mini guns and everything else. I know that there is supposed to be a handicap for lower level players, but nothing will help them there. Nobody is going to want to bring their adventure mode into survival except for those high-leveled people, so hundreds of newcomers who are excited to try the new mode are just going to get slaughtered day 1 and thrown into a deadly circle of greifers. Just make everyone start off fresh. Hell, why don’t you make it so that if you create a character in survival mode and get really attached, you can transfer your character to adventure mode permanently, but not the other way around? Please Bethesda, PLEASE just listen to the community. 
---
You sure showed me, I'm crying right now.  So sad, a stranger doesn't want me around.
---
skyrim dragons but 100x more agressive and dangerous
---
Great find! Turning up the brightness in photomode would have made it easier to see
---
Oranges have always been oranges, until they’re orange juice, what’s the difference really?
---
It took them 2 months to get rid of a game breaking dupe, you really think they will fix something before it even hits the servers?  I love this game but your dreaming.  The code required to do what your asking isn't easy like fixing an event or allowing you to put your camp on top of trees and rocks.  I applaud your idea but it's a "wish", good luck with that.   
---
Inonized meat in nuke zones......
---
You could probably justify a vault-tek faction as well
---
Yup,  I can handle low damage but high rate of fire or high damage and low rate of fire but low damage and low rate of fire is just clownshoes.
---
You’re a jackass.
---
No

76/10 would read.
---
Carnivore!!
---
And toundonget diseases from spoilt meat but you can eat any uncooked meat fine.
---
See, that's the thing. No matter how they word it. There will be people that take it as a promise. There will be things that people will look forward to, that for any number of reasons get canned. And they will be upset.
---
To much information really leads to a lot of Bad PR. Plus, if they put out a roadmap, people are going to expect them to follow it. What if they come up with a better idea for content then what they roadmapped out? There's only so much time to do things. I'd rather let them have some creative room for ideas that happen along the way, then try and stick to a roadmap because they put it out there.
---
Yes to this and include all the factions:
---
* Brotherhood of Steel
---
* Enclave
---
* Free States
---
* Mistress of Mystery
---
* Raiders
---
* Responders
---
Other ideas to make this work:
---
* Give them all an HQ to meet at (like the Enclave).
---
* By default be pacifist to all other members of your faction.
---
* Ability to see other faction members and possibly their bases on the map.
---
* You could add strengths and weaknesses to each. Something like BoS can't use mutations but get some kind of tech, fusion core or PA perk.
---
What machine is everyone talking about??  I like pie 
---
I had a shotty called Kurt CoBang
---
I agree with everything you said but the leaderboards. Leaderboards are a great way to compare yourself against others. 
---
How you gonna sell skins like counter strike if you don't get that PvP server going? 
---
How many Hz is your monitor?
---
Gas mask doesn’t work underwater...  grin
---
At least you got disconnected. Last two times I went there, there was no loot for some reason and I did tag the SBQ multiple times. Not an infinite loading loot, a real empty loot. 
---
Haha that sir is very wrong. PvP requires an immense amount of balancing, testing, balancing, testing. It’s literally a constant thing that is done is any PvP game. And currently the balancing for PvP is terrible.
---
I think my favorite on PC so far were the Bird People. Just jumping around yelling "Cacaw we're Bird People!" The unexpected laughs that people bring to this game seriously over joy me.
---
haha, nah.   
---
i only have 3 points in strenght.  i run with minimal stuffs.
---
I'm sorry if you've taken any of this personally, as it was not my intent. That being said, I believe you're barking up the wrong tree. My original post took issue with your first statement in this chain:
---
&gt;Its neither true or false until one of us provides evidence. Science at its best
---
And I took issue with it because you have not provided evidence, but you're behaving as if your statement is true. Beyond that, you are not presenting the information as an opinion, you're stating definitives. 
---
Honestly? I believe most people did buy this game for PVE. That, or all those who bought it for PVP found it really lackluster and left. But your original evidence for this is really flimsy (your own stated experience), and you should be more aware of what you're saying and how you're saying it when you make claims like this and encounter those who criticize those claims. 
---
If nothing else, then please at least give [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(philosophy)) a read so you can be better prepared in the future. 
---
Equipping Hooded Rags causes all of my armor to be unequipped instead of going on over the armor.
---
So disappointed in JC4. The attempted to ‘fix’ things that were not broken, implemented new systems over ones that were perfect. It was just bland. Rather disappointed. 
---
I got the revives trophy a couple of days ago.   Still have to get the kills.
---
May just do a round robin with friends and have us all get the trophies.

Lol.  True

So first it's a complaint about travel time and having to pay for fast travel now it's a weight issue? Build up your strength then. And wear excavator PA. You can get your carry weight up to 300 or more easily. And if you don't build a lot in your camp you can move it for cheap. Or stay near red rockets.
---
fix duping first before releasing survival mode.
---
I see your point but keeping people in the dark leads to rubbish like a week of "is F76 going free to play?" posts . It's a tough job being the community spokesperson but it needs doing otherwise the uninformed and outright malicious fill the void. 
---
Tse Is Better yes, these however are still effective and i personally have more fun with explosive launchers/brownies than I do with tse

Agree 100%....that’s why it can be vague.  Just tell us....Planned PvP content.  Planned PVE content.   New DLC.   Just an idea.  This is the first game that may be able to pull me away from MLB The Show in 3 years.  
---
I actually think this is on Bethesda's to-do list. Weapon skins are loved by fps players, especially if gotten randomly inside some sort of box purchased with real money.
---
&gt;intelligent design

&gt;Bethesda

Pick one.

I saw this and immediately thought about the gold plated AKs we found in one of  [***saddam***](https://www.google.com/search?q=saddam&amp;spell=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjHzoX5l4ngAhXrnuAKHQiHBkAQkeECCCsoAA)***s***  palaces back in 05, they didn't work though, all cosmetic.    
---
Yes the PA compass is off by about 15 - 20 degrees to the right of true :-)
---
I agree with both of you... it would be a fantastic new mode but I have no confidence in the bug ridden mess we're playing now.
---
We don't wanna start fresh because if we did, we already could. Instead we want to be able to drop into real PvP whenever we want, which is what the new servers seem like they'll be. The ability to skip the engagement system by being on a PvP server.
---
It's not a hard reset for the game, just a new way for bored players to indulge in PvP without griefing everyone they find who just wants to do quests etc. Everyone demanding it be a hard reset are just trying to avoid the fact that so many people already have good gear and they don't wanna fight it. Whereas BGS just wants a way for bored players to go let off steam in a real PvP server instead of hunting for players to fight on the normal servers.
---
Doing a clean slate would literally only help for the first month of the new servers, and by then it'll reach the same place. But it will forever force Players to grind up whole new characters, and stop them from joining their friends who prefer a different gametype because you'll *need* one on both types of server, even if you want them to be exactly the same.
---
I doubt that considering we won’t have survival until March, and then only in beta form meaning there is much more work to be done on it.
---
Who touched Sasha?
---
As someone who uses explosives a lot, I think the best change they could do for explosive weapons is to give them bonus damage against large targets (scorchbeasts/deathclaws/sentry bots/mirelurk queens/etc).  This would give them a useful niche without making them all powerful.  It feels good to hit these big bastards in the face with explosives until you see how little their HP bar has moved =(
---
To prevent the cess pool of duped items from polluting the new game mode. 
---
Your crys fall on deaf ears
---
Stop playing this damn terrible game you lemming
---
I did...thanks for bringing that up. There were blessed items that would stay in your inventory but magic was a big part of the game to give that sense. I wonder if those rules would work in fallout...surgically attached weapons or armor that you keep after death?  Adds a little realism to be completely looted.
---
I love it
---
Dude starfield is not coming out in 2022. It will be here by 2021 at the very very latest. 2020 is my guess, and with a 5% chance 2019.
---
&gt;One a few get those *SUPER RARE* drops
---
..exactly. They're super rare. Which means you won't be seeing many people with them.
---
&gt;and don't say sentinel assassin's, you've got a better chance of blah blah blah
---
Yeah. That's exactly the entire point. Tons of people have full sets of that already, because dupers. On a fresh server it would take months for dueprs to even find new sentinel/assassin's pieces to dupe.
---
.............
---
But they shouldn't be comparable. 
---
For the negatives (such as weight of ammo), launchers should be the clear winner. But they are not. 
---
Lazer weapons and heavy weapons need buffs, badly. 
---
I’m at like 8 max.   All bounties.
---
VATS one is equally rubbish, didn't seem to make any difference to me...
---
You said your new. Wait till the new car smell wears off. Keep playing. You’ll start to see. 
---
You could just try sharing your opinion about my opinion like the rest of the civilized redditors here, tough task for you I’m assuming?
---
They can give xp for player kills, too.  
---
Found the COD player
---
I agree especially with all the duped sentinel's assassin armor. 
---
Oh snap... Me too. D: 
---
I was disappointed as well some of the new toys had a decent idea but implementation was lack luster at best.  I loved 3 and everything they put in worked really well 4 just feels clumsy by comparison.  The lack of story was just jarring when I finally noticed it.  Fortunately I didnt have to pay for the game my father in-law and i have system sharing set up so when he buys a digital game I get it for free and vice-versa.
---
I completely disagree with you. I think Bethesda knows the difference between Fallout 76 ( an online multiplayer) and Fallout 3, Fallout NV, Fallout 4 (all single player RPGs).  Fallout 4 sold a record amount of copies in 2015. More than any other Bethesda game in history. Fallout 76 comes out just 3 years later and sells worse than any other Fallout game. I think Bethesda is smart enough to realize what the problem is here. People want their Fallout games to be single player. That’s the formula Bethesda has always used with the Fallout franchise and it has always worked.  It will work again with Fallout 5 or any other Fallout spinoff as long as it’s single player.
---
Maybe because PVE content aint ready anytime soon and they roll PVP out so that players wouldn't feel like game hasn't been abandoned.
---
They havent even told us when the mide will come. All they say is that there will be a beta and that they are working on it. If it will be like the "Beta" we got before release, then yes, I agree. I am far too optimistic. But if they are actually working on it, then I feel like we can be confident enough to suggest important changes.
---
This thing is going to end up being a gank-fest no matter what. A no-lifer player who exploits, cheats, and plays 24/7 is always going to be able to own regular players with a life. 
---
But some people seem to enjoy that kind of abuse I guess. At least, that's the only reason I can think that anyone would play games like Eve Online and Rust.
---
Didnt need to he stopped and I had some fun with it as i said.
---
Not projecting at all, was just showing you the other side to your comment was all.
---

Mr Handy's at Vault 75 will call you by your name
---
Less weight reduction and more STR improvement which gives you more carry weight. The charisma perk for alcohol combined with Whiskey is best though; 6 str is 30 weight 
---
I kind of like the idea of increasing productivity and capacity, but I'd rather tie it to building specific improvements or doing repairs on items already in the workshop.  The workshops already have a large capacity of free materials that aren't used for much other than maybe a generator and turrets usually.  
---
I want a reason to stay in a workshop for more than the time it takes to capture it or defend it.
---
We aren't being kept in the dark. They came out and said there was no truth to the rumor about going f2p. The problem is this. Players are all over the place where they post, read and interact about the game.
---
Even with dedicated people doing PR, they have to have a central official place to post. If they go to much to outside sources, then they get accused of favoritism, and people start claiming they have a deal with that site to squash bad posts about the game. 
---
We are learning about things that are coming down the line, not just what's next. We heard the other vaults would be opening. We've heard player vending is coming. We all assumed that it would be next patch. 
---
But they never said that. See what I mean. I honestly felt the mid January patch would introduced player vending. But when I went back and read the Inside the Vault, they didn't say that. I just assumed that whatever they talk about, that's the next thing we would get. 
---
I'll admit, when we didn't get it, I was a little disappointed. Because I had built expectations based on what I wanted, over what I was told. 
---
Just thank you that’s all that needs to be said
---
If you can afford it, giving gold to a post is a good way to show you really agree with it.
---
Fair point. :)
---
But players who want PvE content will feel that way anyway and judging from posts here they are the majority. Not to mention that this survival mode doesn't really sound that enticing for people wanting real, competitive PvP either. 
---
Furious 40% increased swing speed Penis
---
I think this game may have been ready for launch door next Christmas.....
---
Devs need to just quite with this game
---
Super muties up in the top left hand corner, big saw mill. Plus there a PA there too and all the work benches. They drop hunting rifles for scraping and lots of caps.
---
I have more to post in future. Worry not
---
It never, not once claimed it was definitive or factual. You were the one taking my opinion which is it obviously a opinion with the wording around it, for fact. Like I said you’ve spent a lot of time arguing about whether my opinion is wrong or right, which it’s neither, because it’s a fucking opinion genius.
---
She's hot :-)
---
Could care less of this survival.  Will not load that version.  PVP in this game is utter garbage.  I didnt do it before, i wont do it now.  
---
the lumbermill in the far northwest corner (i forget the name right now)
---
plenty of xp, caps, .308, weapons to breakdown.
---
server hop, rinse repeat
---
Part of a multiplayer game is PvP and Fallout 76 had a very limited patchworked version of it. This is putting at least some sort of system in place for it to build off of in the future. 
---
People don't realize they have different teams per game there at Bethesda. There's a new features like team there that's paid specifically to think of new features for the game, and the devs implement it. There is no "shifting energy"
---
Except every dupe they manage to patch, people find more. No game ever properly eliminates exploits, and if they can't show they can do it already what makes anyone think they'll fix em all before the new mode launches? And then also manage to stop every single exploit that pops up, as they happen. That's a pipe dream buddy.
---
Are you confusing the Gatling Laser and Ultracite Gatling Laser?
---
They are two different weapons.
---
Could I ask you exactly what rhetoric he used that makes you feel like he's "bashing people?"
---
Unless you mean he's smashing Bethesda.
---
No, I have adhd, and I get side tracked so I find that I pick up tons of holotapes, I almost never listen to them as I play mainly at night and with no sound. I still haven't done the main quest of following the overseer. I am at like 79, I do not power level, have played since that joke of a beta. I just like exploring and will do a quest here and there. So if I go to use a holotape, I have no idea where it is on my list, and most of the time I do have to Google the name of it. 
---
Maybe you shouldn't just assume everyone is a power gamer. I play to play my way. When I see another player, I will wave most of the time. I don't run anymore, but I try to keep my head on a swivel. 
---
Another thing I would like to see is a wider field of view. The lack of peripheral vision drives me insane, it also causes a problem with my game time. Even in 3rd person, I can only play for about 20-45 minutes at a time before I get nauseated and have to stop. I have had this problem with every fps I have played since wolfenstein 3d and doom in the early 90s. I did not have these problems with fo3, nv, or 4. Every now and then in 4 I would have an issue, but swap to 3rd person and I was fine. Most of the time I ran in 3rd person then swapped to fps to fight. Tps in 76 is still too close in. There isn't enough separation in the view to allow my eyes to relax. 
---
It sucks bawls. 
---
I was super excited when they said that there would be brand new content by the end of January as I'd completed all the content in the game within the first week of release and was really getting bored. Only to be told that it would just be bug fixes is slightly annoying but I know bug fixes and stopping dupers really is a priority so I was just happy to wait until the next update. Only to be told that the new content is a PVP mode really fucking sucks. I hate PVP, I hate it. I love playing co-op and roleplaying with other players. I don't want to kill other people, for me it ruins the game. It kinda just feels like another warm cup of sick that bethesda are making us all swallow 
---
Your armor gets removed in power armor so you lose either +1 strength or pocketed perks you may have had on them
---
Drop grinding for xp just play the game and enjoy it
---
I swear, it doesn't work for Nuka Quantum grenades or something. I feel like the blast radius for those is ridiculiously tiny. I basically don't use them because I can never hit ANYTHING unless the grenade goes directly under them! And we all know how often that happens.
---
F#ck those people. I mean its an online game, it's should focus on players who play online game, not offline games. If you are going to want cater those players, then why even build an online game that is supposed to be service. You don't see ESO player being like they want Skyrim.
---
Where can I get the BOS and Prototype paint?
---
I do this with my technical just not connected to aTV
---
Yup but clearly based on what you see in this post and the approval rating of it, you can clearly see that the community has spoken and a majority of those are PvE’ers wanting more PvE content.
---
Another thing, clearly there are people who want pvp, do you even have a point? I mentioned them as being the minority so clearly, yes, there are people who want pvp, thanks for stating the obvious.
---
I try hard to keep up with the game and know next to nothing about upcoming content apart from the unpopular survival mode changes. We are months into what was described as an evolving world space and we have zero new content, no new end game content and still riddled with a lot of fairly unforgivable bugs. There is literally nothing on the horizon to be excited about and I find that disappointing and worrying. 
---
I did my first trade yesterday, and it wasn't as bad as I thought. TBH it was easy
---
Events are good, the defence of workshops can be good. Take 3 or 4 and hop between the attacks that happen on them. Anything that has you killing Ghouls or Super mutants can be good, and ofc Whitespring Golf Course, yes the xp was fixed but you still get a lot of xp farming there.
---
Generally I would just say pick a place, go clear it out and then move on to the next place.
---
If you want to optimise your speed though I would suggest drawing a line between looting everything around you and killing and moving on. If you want fast xp forget the suitcases, bins, drawers etc just keep killing an moving.
---
You can go for specific loot runs when your happy with your level or had enough of xp farming etc. Few mates I've spoke to about this, have asked for help grinding then add 20-30 minutes onto something that can take 5 minutes because well its fallout, I'm sure you know that hoarding / looting monkey everyone gets on there back every once in a while in the wasteland :D
---
As soon as the game hit, these subs were full of "this sucks! RP as a Raider doesn't work" and all sorts of criticism of the pacifist mode.
---
Well now they have what they want. Lets see how many people play it because they've said they'll 'double down' on the stuff people play. If this new mode flops they'll do something else.
---
You think this game is grindy?  I guess you never played anything int he Diablo series.  
---
trading is confusing and most people just ignore players who want to trade. atleast i managed to sell a 100% fusion core for 100 caps 
---
BoS, can be given from the Technical Data missions, if your on PC I can make it for you. Prototype is the paint that is automatically put on your X-01 Power Armor.
---
Well there we go. I didn't know they were different, I thought it was just an additional prefix. Thanks!
---
It's not suicide, you can kill the lvl 62 ghouls at any level. Blow up the cars. I started at lvl 2 and grinded to 16 doing that. Everything broke or was out of ammo so I was just standing on cars and in the buses hitting them with my fist. It counted as killing them myself because a vast majority of them I didn't damage
---
I suggested some ideas for team PVE but also got downvoted.
---
Tbh though all posts get downvoted here because some salty people don't want you having fun on this game.
---
Ha, this actually happened to me last night! A random guy teamed with me, and I thought it was because he wanted a free ride to Watoga Station. I didn't see him for a bit, and then finally, he shows up to help me out as I'm fighting a Scorchbeast. He tells me to fast travel with him after, and we're back at my base - He fixed the shitty roof on my structure, and made it into a proper house with a light and bunk bed. I was quite happy and impressed, but couldn't really offer him anything else, since he was around level 180. 
---
yup
---
Its a slippy slope :(
---
Yeah speak for yourself. PvP is the end game on any multiplayer game. Never gets old. If it does then you just suck. GIT GUD.
---
This! the roadmap is probably the only thing Bungie did right with Destiny 2. I think this would be a great idea for FO76 as opposed to the vague weekly blog posts
---
XB, but thanks.
---
So Prototype is technically standard because its applied to the XO1 set everyone gets from finishing Enclave?
---
I know this is a crazy speculation, but couldn’t that team be working on PvE content instead? Crazy thought I know but couldn’t it at least be plausible
---
I've had very few problems, even in beta. Sounds like I'm one of the lucky ones 
---
gg
---
Yep
---
Well, back in December, at the begining, they said that in January, they are going to start focusing on new content. Which would include things like the other vaults opening. Player vending and a new mode of PvP. 
---
Sorry, but months into a game this big, and expecting the world to evolve is a bit much. Simply because these games are huge, and take so much to make them. Sorry, it's just a very slow process. 
---
You will always play a game faster than they can make them or update them or whatever. 
---
If the damage done by these weapons is not a viable alternative to the damage done by weapons used by other builds then they will never be viable as an endgame weapon (unless they have some rare combination of legendary attributes which would make them unicorns).  either up the damage or add some additional supporting perks / mutations if they are intended to be viable for end game content.  And fix the problem with firing at targets at a lower altitude if you have not already.  
---
Pressing Right Stick/R3 on console controllers
---
Its the yellow and black paint
---
Kinda sad, you typed out all of this just to make it all irrelevant by insulting Anthem. A game which based on your comments you obviously have no idea whats going to be going on in it. 
---
You know, given that "Bethesda" isn't a real person, you're kind of having a conversation with youtself. And it doesn't make sense without context.  Best i can gather is you heard some rumors and are unhappy about them?
---
Yes I was going to name my weapons but didn't let me 
---
Go to whitespring group everything up and Molotov it. If you have a high level friend it’s even easier when nuked. Get level 50 in 10 minutes abusing force respawn.
---
I think there is a decline offer option. I can't remember what it looks like or how to access it but there's several built in communication options one can select - like, "I'm not looking for this sort of thing" "like this but different" "that's too expensive" etc.
---
Unless that was a really vivid dream. Which is possible. I can't check ATM sadly.
---
PvP is end game in a lot of multiplayer games. It's an easy solution to keep people busy while the contents being pumped out. Can't say it doesn't make sense.
---
I'm going to have to get my set back out and look, because I didn't think it was yellow/black.
---
something weird going on then...
---
i’m lvl 97 and had 2x lvl 17 ppl with me last night and we were all sprinting and i definitely gained ground on them. i took notice and it was not simply due to their AP having drained.
---
i feel like you’re missing a detail but i dont know what
---
go to the westek roof for free perfectly preserved pie. it wont feel as good but you'll own it either way
---
"Bethesda, Fallout has always been a top down isometric game. Wtf are you doing wasting resources on a first person mode right now?" - OP, 2008
---
Companies should never change their products and every game in a series should be exactly the same for decades!
---
Neither. Canned dog food for life.
---
Apparently there is some sort of PVE stuff, but they don't want to spoil us and so are keeping it a secret.
---
Which probably means its not ready for launch or wont be ready for this new BETA phase.
---
How they can add a BETA into a premium game they have already launched is beyond me, I just hope this isn't another industry low that will become the norm.
---
Pre order a game for launch day, then download the launch day BETA dlc...
---
When you craft the X-01 Power Armor it will be automatically applied to the power armor, you might've taken the paint off
---
You can come watch my stream and you can come see it be broken. Or you can get your head out of your ass. Every claim I have made has been recorded LIVE STREAMING the game 
---
The community asked for this and wanted a game mode with stark consequences.
---
For those of us that do not wish to partake, like me, I will stay play adventure mode.
---
It's not like the new mode is mandatory. You get to choose how you will play.
---
I'm looking forward to anthem as well. Sadly quit fo76 very shortly after playing. 
---
yes, you are right. When a developer actually cares about it, they will do all those thing. But we are talking about bethesda. They will just give the players the pvp option and that's it. They won1t waste resources and manpower on a dying game. They just don't give a shit
---
This is a *huge* pain in the ass when you're getting towards the end of the main story. Good suggestion.
---
Can't happen to me, I'm at max CAMP budget :-(
---
https://m.imgur.com/a/Lx0zNoA
---
Word.  Finally ditched my fully tricked-out Bunker Buster, and I'm a maxed Explosives build!  Just not worth the bulk and weight.  Ditto grenade launchers.
---
Weapon balance is totally frakked in this game.
---
This is true
---
I have two primary characters ... one shotgun spec and one pistols / explosives. The first gates verti/cargo and has to wait for a sb to land before killing it. The second does shoot them out of the sky. I'm just using bunker booster and perks.
---
The trade glitch was real. I think they patched it. Someone stole my orgional Vault suit and a 2 shot western revolver from me during a trade. We made the trade and he took off and left the server before I realized what happened. 
---
"Aiming" is defined as when you are holding your gun, not aiming down sights - verified by the legendary effect "+50 DR while aiming". In theory if you had a pistol with "faster movement while aiming" it would stack with gun runner 
---
Weapons &amp; Power armor frames ( so you can know which is which)
---
I've contracted Herbivore but I can't heal because I would lose other mutations.   
---
I prefer Carnivore, Appalachia is full of meat and now I only can eat some tatos and flowers. What a life  
---
yeah i was really hoping there would be more to the factions. i was disappointed PvE-wise that the Enclave was the only faction to have specific world events, and even more disappointed that they seem to have lessened after wrapping up the Enclave questline. Factions could have been so much more for PvP AND PvE...
---
Unmodded *and* without perks, they're still top-tier. Such a design flaw 🤦
---
There is a lvl 3 locked door shortcut you can use to bypass a couple of the mainframe sections. The last one where you gotta fix the cores I dont think can be bypassed.
---
JC 3 was great. There was steady improvement in each game. 
---
I bought it, and like 76 I’ll keep it. More as a reminder that just because I like a franchise doesn’t mean they get it right every installment. 
---
The new “survival mode” isn’t much more than switch being flipped and values being adjusted on a slider. It’s shocking how tone deaf this is. All they had to do was force a new character creation in survival servers and this would have been great news. They have completely squandered a golden opportunity to reset all the duplication and exploitation problems. 
---
I'm sorry that you don't seem to understand the point I'm trying to get at. I'll leave you with this- if you want to avoid having a lot of people arguing with you over the numbers you posted, please take more care to qualify them. Your language may not be as clear as you think it is. Be aware of how you present yourself, and have a nice day.
---
I would just like the ability to see which power armor I’m about to put on .. all these modes and content can wait until the other stuff is fixed. Like quests being bugged.. servers disconnecting.. you know the small stuff.
---
Couldn't agree more....
---
To make a town 
---
Here's why I don't trade with random people: they see your entire inventory. If I could select which items they see, and everything else was hidden, it wouldn't be a problem. But I don't want someone pretending that they want to trade just so they can check my armor and weapons to know whether or not they're strong enough to kill me.  
---
It really isn't a big game though. It's a big (and beautiful) map, with some very hollow quests and a few repeatables and 1 type of endgame content. I shouldn't be done with a big game in 150 hours!
---
haha
---
PVPERS will be on the new servers, the grievers will stay where they are with there duped items and bobble head's so they can continue to Grief everyone as they don't generally like a fair fight imo.
---
Whitesprings is fine lower levers just stash all your junk first lol
---
Holy shit you’re actually thinking like a game developer. 
---
I am a god player. I have zero bobbleheads and around 30 stimpacks right now. I do feel that I do stand a chance against anyone, irrespective their build and amount of duped stuff they have. I have reached my godhood after dropping my first cavalier armor and bloodied explosive gattling and marketing the shit out of it. I do believe, on the other hand, that within month of creating new character, I'd recreate the godhood with the knowledge I now have. I am not angry when I see those posts that say my character, made from level 1 with PvP in mind, is something other players don't want in PvP. I am here mostly to bring up bad news: if you cannot compete right now, you will not be able to compete in a new environment. There are no unkillable builds in this game, and if what you are doing to some player has absolutely no effects, then you are using wrong tool for the job.
---
Cavalier? Enforcer + shotgun to lock them in place and decimate their AP.
---
Sentinel? Something that shoots fast and can move enemies, when you push an enemy by a centimeter, their sentinel ceases to work.
---
Full bloodbuild? I have never managed to kill such guy without a VATS crit to the face, but at the same time, the amount of weapons that can crit a bloodbuild into oblivion is much broader than range of weapons who can do the trick for other god builds.
---
Good weapons but bad armor, oneshotting enemies but being oneshotted to? Calling that unplayable? I do believe that then the game becomes a game of map control, positioning, and stealth movement. Before godhood I had a 1v3 fight where each team oneshot the enemy team members. And it was absolute blast for me, the lone wanderer, because while they had numbers advantage, I was simply moving better.
---
Separating character base to adventure and survival will not solve your issues in PvP if the issues are not external.
---
This game was promoted as an Online PVP/PVE Game, it is a fallout, but not like the older ones, The fact that you want the game to only cater to your side of the Coin is Selfish, I bought this game to experience a fallout from a pvp standpoint not to kill ghouls in whitesprings 24/7
---
Everything in your stash is alphabetized. When you take them out, you take them out in alphabetical order. So, it's still showing you the holotapes in the order you picked them up, you just happened to pick them up in alphabetical order this time.
---
Would combat the fact that some jerks use it to harass other people, love your idea!
---
Alright dude, you're not projecting. I literally called it out, you subsequently told your story about this other dude but no, you're not projecting at all! Or in denial! Bless.
---
Snowflake? Hahahaha good one. 
---
Adding a PVP mode seems to be the best and easiest solution to our problem though. Some people want meaningful PVP, while others want to opt out of all PVP. The compromise we have right now makes no one really happy. The PVP players have no PVP, the PVE players complain about every bit of player confrontation.
---
Dividing the game into two modes will most likely not solve the problem completely, but you get as close to a solution as possible. PVP events wont satisfy anyone.
---
No idea at this point, but I guess I need to farm the tech data quest.
---
Why would Bethesda release a PVP mode, with linked accounts when they know duping is a huge problem? It just doesnt make sense, it seems like they know the playerbase is getting bored and they're just trying to keep players interested by releasing a half assed new game mode. 
---
You can find a perfectly preserved pie on top of West Tek
---
Omg op is so spot on in a lot of things

Yeah it sucks to watch something you think will be an improvement because how could it not be.  Halo 5 was a similar disappointement I beat it on the first night and haven't touched it since.  There are many others but then there are gems like Doom which was an amazing game I am psyched for Eternal hope it doesnt drop the ball.
---
Well, maybe from main to private, but not the other way around of course.
---
Said hi to a really familiar vegan girl today.
---
Could have sworn I met herbivore.
---
Ah the old “no true fallout player” fallacy. I can’t wait to kill some people while doing the pve stuff. 
---
Okay, but they haven't added anything to the main game since launch except for LIMITED TIME ATOM shop items LOL. People are getting bored and the majority never asked for survival but more PvE content.
---
You described wanting the next iteration of single player fallout.  So Fallout 5.
---
Where did you grind out those early levels?
---
I literally just traded a legit max level vampiric 1+ strength 40% attack speed for a t60 jet pack.  Im a rifle build.  But I have serious thoughts into respecing my character 
---
Dammit....
---
PVP players will be on there on server. Also Guns will be nerfed to hell. So it’s a perfect Place for all those OP Melee builds to rule the wasteland.
---
So accept and bend the knee to Melee Users...the true Kings and Queens of the WasteLand and have been since beta.
---
Side not who has YouTube link to the 10,000k Damage Melee builds? Asking for a friend..
---
How do you know that the patch notes when released won't say they are locking characters that have been obviously duping and/or just remove the stacks and stacks of items off of characters server side while the maintenance is going?
---
He said he is looking forward to Anthem and degraded EA. Please learn to read for the love of God. Not ANTHEM, EA!!!!
---
Don't show people on the map, we want a true random encounter with players not people hunting people.
---
Speak for yourself. PvP is end game stuff. I'm excited to see it.
---
&gt;Somewhere in the development of this game, a planned content release roadmap was created.
---
What gave you that impression? 
---
Yeah I’m excited to just play in survival to do the same one stuff I’ve been doing but also have the added danger of pvp
---
Weight is pretty hard hit, but you do need less. Hm, I may do this 
---
I understand from a fan perspective why this is such a big deal, but in my experience these things evolve over time and a solid, public list would make a lot of people *more* upset.
---
While I have no doubt they have a few set-in-stone objectives like DLC-esque content (which I think they'll announce when they're ready to), a lot of day-to-day improvements are going to be really flexible/changing in priority *all* the time (in terms of player-demand and implementation ability). The nature of this game and how it has to respond to a live playerbase so much more than a single-player release, makes it hard to have a solid public roadmap that won't just make people mad.
---
People are already complaining that they haven't followed up on xyz tiny half-mentioned feature from the a/b/c date *Inside the Vault* entry. I think *some* transparency is necessary, but *Inside the Vault* has provided about as much as is needed I think...let the developers iterate and feel things out. A long laundry-list of features, some of which may not be overly relevant to the meta of the game 6 months from now when they're finally implemented means they can't be quite as nimble in responding to more recent developments and nearly guarantees they'll be letting someone down who has been speculating that a certain feature will change their life only for it to take forever for release and work differently than they imagined. :/
---
Weapons from quests can scale to your level. 
---
Ignore that guy.  He is obviously a gigantic asshole.
---
Big brain energy goin on 
---
the one person I have killed was because he politely asked me to after being accidentally flagged helping me defend a workshop.
---
Queen and brotherhood missions.  Its so cheap to repair and has close to if not the best rad resist.  I have been slowly upgrading it.  It's my daily driver and actually now my go to. 
---
I didn't actually know that! So thank you very much.
---
I shall find somewhere decent to camp. Any recommendations?
---
Same.  It used to work about 2 patches ago.
---
Well the Holiday events are here.  They told that on new year we are going to get events and I told that chances are that these events are going to be pointless events and here we are with "Events"- each toy in inventory gives 1 rad resist. Better question is what happend with Factions PVP? and Vaults? 
---
If I need to get 10 to 15 heavy weapons to mash together to get a decent heavy weapon a stash size of 1000 would be too low.
---
I didn't say to remove them. I said to bring them up to the level of other weapons so we aren't forced into using 1-2 items for real fights. You make a fair point though.
---
That's the basis of trade though. I want that nice stuff. You get to accept my request or not, in the case of stimpacks you could offer 10.
---
Thanks for the advice man!
---
Need to get on the grind and craft myself plenty of ammo and what not so if needs be I actually have a chance of fighting back.
---
I know exactly what happens..folks come a running with their TSEs..lolz
---
I feel like we are going to see explosive weapons being used a bit more after the TSE nerf. That being said, they do need to make the weights more viable. Fuck realism if you're making an entire class of weapons into paper weights. 
---
So to put things in perspective I'll compare 76 to ESO, which launched with months and months worth of questing and story (all interesting voice acted). It launched in April and in may they announced Craglorn, a whole zone of end game content. I have been playing since 2014 and still have tons to do. I feel like I am being harsh on 76, and I don't want to be as I enjoyed those 150 hours. I just want  reason to do another 150 and at the moment it just isn't there.
---
Thank you for your service
---
I am going to go ahead and assume I need a pickaxe for this?
---
What platform are you on? I would love to come check this out.
---
It would be like Forknife and eventually no one would play pve. It's especially important not to go f2p, since that wasn't in initial plans and they also denied that rumor. Can't walk that one back. I think it's important to simply treat the mode like a raider mode
---
You know you can still play adventure mode. Its not like they force you to play survival.
---
I just hope they turn around and force survival players to create new characters. Current adventure characters shouldnt be able to play survival, this will kill the mode from launch on. 
---
But if they do this, then I am really excited. A fresh start in a new mode with more dangers will be fun. And if its not fun, well then I can go back to adventure mode. No harm done.
---
Good to know they’re $240 caps?
---
Hi man,
---
Thanks for the offer. Sadly I'm on PS4 otherwise I would have snapped it up.
---
If they add battle royal I'm done with this game and possibly Bethesda. 
---
If you hover above discovered workshops it will tell you what resources you can get from that work shop. A few do have aluminum extractors 
---
RNG is not fair.  Limiting trading won’t fix that.  It will then just be my RNG vs someone else’s RNG.
---
there is but it produces aluminum ore isntead of scrap
---
But is that the best use of scarce resources?  I'm not in a position to give an answer, but that should be a consideration.
---
No slap damage and a leader board of some sort. 
---
Bethesda have some strange ideas tbh but it could be good!
---
A 249 carry limit is nothing once you discover Excavator power armour and/or calibrated shocks 🤣 oh boy you're in for a treat when you find em
---
I just wanna be able to sell ammo tbh
---
I think red rocket mega stop has 3 extractors 
---
Us, Vault 76 dwellers. At the beginning of the game, vault dwellers were sent out from Vault 76 to rebuild America but I was afraid we'd go instinct killing each other in PvP before we even get to start rebuiding. Jokes aside, I'm not really a PvPer and was looking for new PvE stuff first of all.
---
I think its easy enough for them to implement and PvP is a pretty common end-game grind feature for online games...its not really my thing (sometimes for a change of pace), but when they're just tweaking a few systems that they already have toggles for....why not?
---
PC
---
Check your "Misc" stuff.  Gunpowder likes to add up really quickly.
---
On perks that may help you:
---
- Traveling Pharmacy makes chems (including stims) weigh much less.
---
- Bandolier makes ammo weigh a lot less
---
- Through Hiker makes food and drink way a whole lot less
---
IMHO, those help more than anything else.  
---
So bethesda couldn't give us private servers or pve servers... instead we get pvp and pvp extra servers... ok
---
Yeah, to be fair.. It was a pretty pointless mission. At first, I was grinding away with all the missions with the attempt at leveling up as much as I could but that was that. Should have really paid more attention to the tutorial tips if I'm honest!
---
My PSN is MrBellyElliot so what I will do is add you up now!
---
How?  On Xbox the "inspect" button becomes a "request" button for PvP trades.  If there's a way to actually inspect, I'd love to know that.
---
Yeah, you might wanna work on your own reading comprehension. He clearly says right before he begins the insults, " Anthem a *EA Game*
---
True.
---
Was actually quite fun. Did lots of dailies and events. First 25 or so levels just explored and wandered all over the map (got to Harper’s at level 15 and bought handmade plans). Didn’t put CAMP down till mid 30s. Last 5-7 levels in the 40s seemed to take the longest/most work so I built myself a level 45 50 cal MG and found a PA and farmed XP (and about 2 dozen legendaries, both weapons and armour) at Whitesprings. Went through about 4500 rounds of 50 cal, server hopping. Don’t normally XP farm but enjoyed it. 
---
the production terminal, you need to buy one in each server, learn it in the same server, log out and back in, the next upgrade is there, the Last one is called shielded, it's around 2000 caps for all of them
---
If they do, it better force player characters to be separated from public servers. It's f#ck bullsh#t if I am going to play with player who gear up in private server alone, while I have to gear up in public server with idiots around me stealing loot.
---
Biggest issue you'll actually find is the limit on size of your Camp, not necessarily the resources. Budget starts very small, and you'll have to grind a lotta levels to get it big enough for a serious Camp.
---
Well, like I said. I would hope they don't release this till they have dealt with those accounts. See, I agree, that if those accounts aren't deleted or removed, or something is done before this, that's bad.
---
I also know that companies really won't give you full information about what they are doing, for all kinds of reasons that most people won't accept. Because what they really want is to hear stories about how these people met what they think is justice. 
---
So whatever.
---
Nah, this is Reddit. I don't care about fake digital points.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yza6w/i_made_a_map_of_resource_deposits/?utm_source=reddit-android

(XBO)Yes, here is a map with most of the mineral deposits that was made quite a while ago but I still use it with great success, hope it helps!
---
I know Sunday Brother's Cabin has a decent amount of ham and seafood in the basement. You have to pick a lock tho, but I think it only requires level 1 pick lock 
---
I remember they did it for super mutants a while ago and something else, Radscorpion I think?
---
Get carnivore and collect ionized meat. Boom. 
---
Can you post a shot of the location on the map? I may have found my new camp location...
---
bot is never there. i have only run into another player who seemed to be equally confused
---
I agree. You can solo everything except the SBQ, and with the right legendaries and buffs even that fight is possible solo. I want fights where the team needs to communicate, and dps focus/cc specific enemies. I'd love  to run through a mine full of super mutants where our enforcer build cripples tough enemies, while the rifle and heavy melee guys shred the limping green bastards. Meanwhile the heavy build is mowing down the horde of mutant hounds boiling out of holes in the tunnel walls, and our demo guy is lobbing grenades while covering our rear with as mine or two. 
---
There’s a workshop at a good processing plant on the western edge of the map south of the  Mothman town a bit that makes processes food. You can choose between about five types to make (Salisbury steak is my favorite) and to make it even better they have no rads. 
---
Makes them fairly quick too!
---
Happy exploring!
---
Shrouded wood armor increases sneak speed and it definitely works - and stacks. I’m wearing three pieces and I sneak faster than walking. 
---
Agree, I'm also dying for more PvE stuff, though.
---
Could be, to illuminate the point. Not should be, not should be. That would be dumb.
---
That’s what I also thought.  I guess I was reading it incorrectly because of the limited time of the negative effect suppression. 
---
Or maybe only you can see the custom name.  If you pull up a trade with some else, it just shows the regular name for the item.
---
Eh my two shot fat man I have no complaints with whether I am wrecking scorch beast or player bases it gets the job done. People just got spoiked with their two shot explosive pump action shotguns which never should have existed in the first place. I saw a video on youtube earlier a guy has a two shot explosive tesla rifle which also shouldnt exist imo cause the damn gun already does AOE damage why tf does it need explosive attachment as well? People keep bitching oh their nerfing my shotgun the damage is going to suck I wont be able to one shot the scorch beast queen 😭😭😭 like oh freaking well it is a end game boss **NO ONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO 1-2 SHOT A DAMN BOSS GET OVER IT OR GO PLAY SOMETHING ELSE.**
---
There is no FAIR in fallout.  It’s a freaking RNG grind game.  You want FAIR, go play battlefield.
---
Does other guy have fireproof/dense on? Or sentinel/assassin? (Not sure if you said it in the video, I looked without audio)
---
Yeah, they're all friggin' heavy.  21 pounds for a RIFLE?
---
If you want to be told how to have fun and a feature shoved down your throat, you should be playing EA games.
---
There's no fun in that! It's in the very northeastern corner of the map, follow the cliff's edge north of the ammo factory and the fissure site. If you come across a truck with a safe you've gone too far!
---
You can get them with the perk  Can Do!  which can be picked up at level 7 under Luck
---
Maybe they should add a form of elemental weaknesses for certain weapons. I know we have "armor piercing weapons" that work well against super mutants and such, but if certain types of rounds generally worked better against ghouls, animals, beasts, etc that might be interesting. 
---
I camp along the river north of the dried up lake but that's about as far east as I recommend. South of the top of the world is better cost wise. I've got enough caps now that it's not much of an issue.
---
It is not a complaint att all. It is a shared conversation starter for people with the same love and interest  for the game. So that when we can't play we can talk about the possibilities and such.
---
As you can see many people accept it as so and joined the fun, just read the comments :)
---
Unfortunately there are some (2 to be exact) butthurt fanboys who can't just enjoy this and take every single negative sounding word about fallout 76 as a personall attack. 
---
I am sorry if it came across like that. Yes the title implies it but you need a "interesting title". 
---
The comments show it's all a bit more light-hearted. 
---
Excellent solution! 30% would be too high, just because those 30s are only against very specific enemy types, so it has to be less that 30. But 5% per mutation, capped at 25% sounds like a really solid formula/balance.
---
We definitely are planning on doing weekly streams for you guys! Especially with my streaming background (Prior to working at Bethesda I was a "Variety Bethesda Streamer") I'm very eager to do them. I hope to get these streams up and running soon! In the meantime let us know what kind of content you'd like to see on streams!
---
This is awesome! I wish there were more caves around the map that you could make camp in.

---
I think that is going to be my biggest problem.. finding it hard to level up at the moment.
---
I'm good at putting in the effort.
---
So????? He then proceeds to degrade EA, not Anthem. How is that the same as degrading Anthem? He said that it's quite sad that he is looking forward to a game from a shit company like EA instead of having fun in FO 76. There a TL;DR for you, that is not hard to read lol.
---
This will happen in a week.  It won’t take long for players to level up and get All Rise.  Then it’s a problem for anyone who didn’t start day 1.
---
Ok then what about mods? We can't get any real mods unless it's single player or risk getting banned. The fallout modding community does great work. So go ahead and call ot Fallout 5 but we're getting the short end of the stick if you like running mods.
---
Lovely, thanks!
---
Off a 3star charred? Or a regular 
---
I literally wouldn't know where to find any of that!
---
I will certainly give it a look, thank you!
---
Also, most late game Players have a bunch of different mutations, especially with how easy they are to buy on the market subs.
---
Every weapon type has 3 damage cards exactly like rifleman except for Unarmed/Explosives.  It's not required, and you get pretty efficient damage if you just get one of each instead of three in all of them.
---
But I wanna pvp
---
I will come back to the game if this mode is released
---
You should make a small video tour. 
---
I completely agree and that's something we've brought up to them. I am unsure of the status on that but I will definitely bring it back up again.
---
Based on what, lol? Their amazing track record? 
---
Uhh.. they increased the stash once already.
---
Thanks!!
---
You cant degrade a company and not degrade the game theyre about to release. Especially not in the same paragraph. 
---
I love the game, I just hate getting disconnected after using most of my good ammo and/or stimpacks clearing an area(like west tek yikes).  It's very frustrating and it still happens, not as regularly as it used to, but enough that it's irritating.
---
no problem, sorry for late reply I was asleep
---
You will soon buddy, welcome to the game!
---
So if there was a currency and structure to getting power armor plans and learning mods, would you work on that? I know I sure would.
---
As for the weapons, what if you really wanna use black diamond, but find a flatly better weapon. Happened to me. I really liked black diamond, it just wasn't as good as the vampires war drum I came across, which wasn't better than all rise.
---
Starting fresh is the only appealing option to me. I have 40+ hours in game. It’ll be great starting the game again on an equal footing with the other players, in an environment that isn’t as exploited as the current game. I would also support something like a bi-monthly character wipe to keep the game fresh 
---
No worries, I fell asleep right after I asked that haha
---
Does this perk work when collecting in-world items? If I collect something from a shelf, could it become (2) in quantity? Or should I just stick to collecting from trash cans?
---
The quantum grenades just suck sadly
---
Weapons arent the main issue. Its the sentinal and cavalier assassin sets of armor which makes it to where those players take no dmg. With the right perks of course. 
---
If you're on PC, google the console command to change your FOV.
---
Finally got Marsupial, (bought it off a player after farming for it forever with zero success because RNG sucks), and just built a L50 X-01. Now I want to find this Jetpack, because Marsupial has been life changing. 
---
But my question is, how does it work in combo with marsupial? does it just give you a higher single jump? a double jump? Is it going to make navigation a pain in the ass in tight spots (like when I only need to jump up a 2-foot ledge, for example)? Just really curious to know if the added benefit is going to be worth the pain in the ass I know it's going to be to try and find it :-D 
---
At least it sounds like the cost is reasonable, unlike what they charge for those serums.
---
This is good and they won't read nor listen
---
Where did you find the plan? 
---
Give me a bigger budget and I'll try it out. 
---
Hi mate. You’ll want a Hardened Receiver to maximise damage, and a suppressor obviously. Stinging magazine is good. I go for capacity and armor penetration over speed. 
---
With Perks - don’t waste any on Sniper, go for max Sneak, max Covert Operative, max Mister Sandman, max Bloody Chunks I think it’s called. Also put at least 6 into Rifleman. 
---
I can one-shot a hell of a lot of things and I don’t even have a legendary weapon. If you’re PC, add me and I’ll build you a good sniper rifle. lenksd
---
probably was to good, so they nerfe'd it :)
---
If they can improve server stability and fix duping and other game breaking exploits then free 2 play could work eventually.
---
They can't go Free 2 play within the first year though after asking everyone to pay full price and launching a broke product, well they could but I doubt that would help any other game Bethesda ever launch.
---
The bit about no story or raids makes no sense though, any free 2 play players should still have the choice between pvp and pve  and if there's no story for them to enjoy what would make them upgrade to paid version? The few quests we have now aren't worth what they would have to charge for it to be wort it.
---
If Bethesda really wanted a free 2 play model, they need to release content with some substance for there existing paying customers or refund everyone and go free 2 play and hope people are willing to spend £6 every few days on new hair styles and other fluff.
---
Well that's good to know.
---
Don't think I can fit it in my build unfortunately.
---
Or...your custom names only show up for you; anyone else that's looking at them would see the original name.
---
Wow that's my dream... i have a two shot one and it's a beast!
---
Are you fucking kidding me? The game is not the same as the company. But whatever, this discussion is not worth any time put into it, people will deduct whatever they want to without any regards to facts/intent. Have fun doing that.
---
Well it won't take forever, the XP doesn't really slow down much as you level so the grind is steady instead of exponential. My recommendation for XP, craft a ton. Like, cool every piece of meat, brew every tea, and just grind out scrap you don't need into items you don't need. There's XP to be had in all of it 👍
---
If you hit the tail end of the event, the robot seems to despawn before the event hexagon on the HUD goes away. Its happened a few times to me, or the odd time you find the bot and he just gives you a canned statement because the event timer is done but the markers still show.
---
At piller v10? South of the abandoned bog town, the bot sometimes spawns/teleports up into the monorail at the top of the tower.
---
Also I learned that if you fast travel to an event using the map icon, and the event ends while your in the load screen, you get an infinite load screen, so now I fast travel close and run the last 100 ft, way less issues.
---
It’s a mutation 
---
I could swear that her loot isn't instanced. When I am in melee range when she dies, I will see all the loot, try to grab what I can, but as I am it looks like other items disappear from the list. Whenever I am am at a further range where it takes me a little bit to get to her it's always empty &amp; never pops before she despawns.
---
Do you know how hard a full set is to get tho? I’ve been trying lol 
---
Just because someone has a certain vision of a game doesn't make them a fanboy. Just like you have ideas so do others.
---
Damn that sucks I’m PS4, that looks so good though I’m hoping to make something unique like that soon
---
WHY I CLICKED!
---
I do trade, but it’s under sufferance because of the system. You need to be able to set prices and mark things as ‘for sale/not for sale’ *outside* of the trading menu. That way, when you do trade, it would do away with the waste of time of someone requesting something you’d never sell or vice versa. It feels like something that was cobbled together at the last minute, like so much else in this game. 
---
I read this morning somewhere that they said you can bring a character over without needing to make a new one but that they hope people will make new characters for it
---
Are you on PC? Willing to build a marine chest if I bring mats?
---
I use an auto grenade launcher sometimes and it does pretty well for itself, don't think it's that bad a weapon. The rate of fire is pretty decent and the damage is in the high 200's range. It's good against big things at least
---
Thank you,  I really appreciate it
---
Every leader board in every online game becomes cheaters and such at the top and you at number 703929 out of it

Although you may want lead belly unless you have a decontamination shower

Jetpack plan only comes from BOS vendor according to data mining. I've only ever seen the t-51 jetpack plan from the same, and I've got ~450 hours in.
---
Mod, I don't know for sure, but I'm guessing the same.
---
Oh right. Don't think I can fit in 'Starched Genes' either, but I'll read into it nonetheless, thanks!
---
Great post, thanks
---
I've been saying this for a bit now. No Legendaries (bobbleheads and magazines can go too) just perks and plans. 
---
One point endurance perk "good doogy"  Triples the effect of dog food, including hunger satisfaction and healing.  The cans are everywhere.
---
Dont be dumb,  you can still make op build with stealth and then we are at the same place. Getting one shot. 
---
Then request 10? 
---
Holy fuck I need that gun now.
---
Also you're psychopath for taking on a scorchbeast with ~90% rads
---
This would wonderful. 
---
Real solutions from a real thinker.  I like it.  It's refreshing to not hear people complain about TSE on the PvP server and completely ignore the massive TSE nerf that's already been announced lol.  
---
thing is cannot fast travel to the event. but that makes sense that makes sense to me that the event timer ended. i also wonder if other players had started the event and failed earlier on but it still shows as active on map. (i know what the event is by watching yt videos)
---
I don't doubt that this happens and have experienced it on other baddies.  I think also sometimes you see a different inventory (the enemies battle inventory maybe?) before the actual loot inventory shows up.

Problems with crafting some level 40 weapons and ammo. 
---
I'm level 41 but am unable to craft a basic level 40 pipe pistol.
---
I am also unable to craft the right arm of level 40 combat armour though I managed to create the left arm. No problems creating other level 40 armour and guns. 
---
In both cases erroneous message about insufficient materials. Checked and they are more than adequate. Have tried obtaining more materials but still those items are blocked.
---
Nope not 5, a 4.5 to fill the gap
---
First question: where did you get the tin foil hat. 
---
It'll cause, and is likely causing, more problems by releasing half-assed statements regarding future plans for content every time they release another inside the vault. Roadmaps go a long way to instill faith in a community, it's why so many developers who run a games as a service produce one. Some people will be shitty and upset no matter what Bethesda does, whether that be promise a feature that shows up late or delivers something that didn't meet their expectations resulting from a roadmap. But rather than piss off a few unreasonable people, they're pissing off pretty much everyone with their inability to promote the future of their own game. 
---
Ahh okay, I shall have to get out and have a look round.
---
When you say better cost wise. What do ya mean?
---
How do you have so many? I pick up every stimpak I see and I still feel like I'm always scrounging for them.
---
No the shooting mechanics don't suck? What are you saying no too?
---
I am exactly this. 
---
Context is king.  Did you have a workshop?
---
Scrapping resources for the scrap isn't very time efficient. If you take the approach of focusing on scrounging Acid and Gunpowder, and mining the Lead and Acid it will help sustain your ammo count. If you're on PC PM me, I'll hook you up with some ammo.
---
Dupers don't just copy tse weapons, they dupe everything useful.
---
Complete sets of sentinel armor, assassin weapons and gear, every grenade/mine possible and bobbleheads.
---
Any of these items can make anyone a literal god in game with required perks with no way to really kill them
---
How is any of that going to be fair for anyone joining  survival mode? As soon as they see you they will stand still becoming invincible nearly and one shot you to oblivion regardless of what armor you have 
---
I remember that. I also remember that most of the player base had given up by that point. ESO’s launch was at least as miserable and had a number of unforced errors in the first year. 
---
It was a far, far better game two years out but it had severe growing pains too. The end game content was poorly balanced in addition to being more quests that felt like the ones you’d already done. Craglorn didn’t help much because all the new content was group only and early ESO had primarily solo players wanting a bigger Skyrim. Sound familiar?
---
Like they actually know... let’s laugh together 
---
For the love of Bob THIS!
---
Just for reference, the PS4 stats are:
---
Level 25: 32%
---
SBQ: 11%
---
Nuke: 10%
---
I keep telling people here the same thing, but it doesn't seem to help.
---
That makes a lot of sense. Wouldn't the smart move be to nerf those effects then?
---
In b4 "HeReS AnOtHeR iDiOt CoMpArInG AtOmS tO cUrRenCy" or "YoU cAn EaRn AtOmS".
---
Fort Defiance 
---
God I hope so...
---
Welcome! Take pics!
---
Right. Forgot about starched jeans. I just run carnivore and maxed out thru hiker. Ionized meat doesn’t rot and it weighs 0.05 with thru hiker. 
---
It's not finished?
---
I’ll need to go back there and look again. Thanks!
---
So, by your logic. A companys habits and patterns cant be used in correlation with the products theyre releasing. So we can expect the next Bethesda game to be relatively bug free then Right? and of course the next CoD wont have map packs and a season pass like theyve always done?
---
I kind of keep an auto grenade launcher in my stash for the situation that one day I may decide to assault and blow up someone's camp who has really annoyed me. But that one day has never come and I'm thinking as nice as the mods on the launcher appear to be, it's too situational, the ammo is scarce and it's taking up room in my stash. So maybe I'll get rid of it, what do you reckon?
---
Let's be honest, Bethesda can ban dupers but the fact is the game is flooded with duped weapons, and armor already. You can argue not everyone has a TSE weapon or Sentinel's assassin armor, but the majority of the people of who will play PVP will have them. So to me, it makes no sense why Bethesda would even tell their playerbase about a new game mode in which you can use your original character.
---
As a fatman/missle user who uses all the bells and whistles... its not that underpowered. 
---
Remeber its AoE. 
---
My twoshot fatman tooltips for 2000 damage with Demo Ex and Adrenaline Reaction mutation. 
---
They serve a purpose for either wiping an entire building or pack of ghouls. 
---
I think they are fine because after the two shot and explosive nerf, they will still retain that damage and then be stronger then most things. 
---
Weight reduction is mandatory though. 
---
Lol, c'mon Bethesda work harder
---
Store all non-quest related holotapes in the stash. There really isnt a reason to keep them in your character. Then you only have to sort through ten at the terminal instead of two hundred.
---
I deleted the game already from my ps4 cause I needed space for other games and felt like I won't play this game for a long time....
---
I’ve had lead belly from the get go. Does ionized meat give you rads without it?
---
The atom shop needs fallout based shit.
---
Give me deathclaw skins for my power armour, or let me wear the skin of a scorch beast if it has to be 76 based. Give me something that looks cool and is fallout. You guys made fallout (well from 3 onwards), you probably know more about the lore than me. I wanna see cool fallout shit in the atom shop not fucking blue power armour.
---
I recently had an issue where I was unable to loot SBQ until the event completed and the event took like 6 minutes after the fact to complete so it was a bit odd for sure 
---
It's often stacked bobbleheads lately.
---
For what's it's worth, I'd like to add my voice to begging for this as well. No adventure mode characters allowed in survival, please.
---
If you think it's anywhere near a complete game you are fucking brain dead 
---
When you exit to menu and switch to your alt doesn't it connect you to a different server, meaning that the loot you dropped will be gone?
---
It gives quite a bit lol, it's nuclear meat
---
Dude you need to check out my place. I live in the Cole dispenser by the observatory. It's a bitch and a half to build a base in side of a four story empty building. Handeler:ugiron
---
the spawn points at Sunshine Meadows drive me nuts. especially when molerats fixate on a nearby camp and end up under the floor... then i run the risk of becoming wanted while trying to kill a single molerat. this also happens when ppl place camps near the workshops at one of the airports.
---
So if I understand you correctly you want
---
1) an enhanced dedicated PVP gameplay experience 
---
2) where you kill or be killed.
---
You can’t have it both ways pve and pvp experience, when it’s convenient for you.
---
The name is survival mode. This isn’t role playing. Go big or stay home.
---
Too many bored pukes out here with no one to screw with.
---
A dedicated environment where you trust no one, is what the bored folks in this game, need.
---
Youre never gonna learn how to swim with water wings.
---
Take your beatings,  or dole them out.
---
Well , the mode is in development and is bound to change towards what the players want , I guess it will attract people who want a more realistic survival game , given that a bunch of people thought fallout 76 traditional game mode is a bit easy and forgiving.
---
My prediction is by the time survival mode comes about it won’t only be focused on pvp but also be a hardcore alternative to fallout 76 traditional gamemode 💁🏼‍♂️
---
It isnt about levels, a level 200 isnt that much stronger than a level 50. Its about gear. The last 4 times ive played ive been killed at my workshop by either a TSE Shotgun (most often) or an instigating gauss rifle in 1 shot, 2 tops. I wouldnt mind being killed at workshops, or anywhere, if it felt like I stood any chance at all of defending myself. Lvl 120 btw. The commenters below are, in my experience, dead wrong. The TSE issue is not overblown, they are not rare, go to any farmed event (uranium fever, white spring ghouls, Scorch Beast Queen) and 9 times out of 10 you will see a TSE shotgun, probably more than one.
---
Agreed, it had as rocky release as F76, but zenimaxs seized the initiative and was hyping new content within a month. 76 has much, much less content and apart from paid atom store stuff has received nothing. The fixes have been very welcome but we need more. Until then I have absolutely no reason to play as I have done everything. 
---
gives a chance for extra cans from whatever contains have a chance to contain food.
---
Never actually played it, so I wouldn't know. 
---
As a day 1 player of Diablo one I can say with certainty that it wasn't this grind. I played that game in and off for  the better part of a decade. The whole game was much less complicated, and far more direct. There was no extensive loading screen to go maybe get one item. In the time it takes to run an event I could pull 3-4 magic items. As an offline game, it didn't matter how ridiculous the gear got though. There could be tons of great gear, and there pretty much always was.
---
whole heartedly agree with this. they could leave the game as-is currently and i would still have fun as long as they fix the server stability.
---
Not at all,  there are still loads of bugs, a lot of good features are not in the game because they wanted it to be an early released game. 
---
Stairs are a bitch, and so are upper floors. 
---
If you want to build a basement below your first floor build that foundation first and then stairs up connect upper floors.
---
If you build the 1st floor first, connect stairs down to 1 basement floor (concrete or standard floor base). Now you can to back and replace 1st floor with upper floors 
---
So if they fixed things about stacking bobbleheads and these extreme armor sets would you be alright with it?
---
Ok but why do Quad or double Harpoon Gun, boards der and Crossbow exist? It pretty the same 
---
It are 2 people lol. 
---
Never found it without lead belly. Didn’t know lol. Technically the atoms have been stripped of some of their electrons but no bueno either way lol. 
---
Who hurt you?
---
Just brown bag and move on. Do you listen to old holotapes? If so, you should ask for a chronological sort while you're at it.
---
don't. If you do wait a couple months
---
I'm bored of you.
---
Upvote for use of frak 🤣
---
Man I disagree. I am stoked for survival mode bc this game desperately needs some tension and some challenge, although what breaks it for me is that they don't have the character locked to the mode. If everyone had to start a new char for survival that would be amazing. That's what this game really needs, and many many people hold this same opinion. I am hoping Bethesda heeds this. 
---
Maybe I’m naive. But just make it so you can only use one bobble head at a time. Seems simple.
---
The fact that missiles are harder to pop off while "firing from the hip" and hit anything besides the broad side of a barn is something to take into factor. Same with the nukes, so slow, you can get away from them, and while I have not taken a hit by one in pa, I am willing to bet it is survivable. They need to be bumped somewhat, lets see how the explosive bullet nerf goes to tryband determine the amount. Also, I am willing to bet they will have to adjust the damage up again. 
---
I didnt get to reas all of this but I will just wanted to say that Bethesda needs to stop saying they are passing along our ideas and start actually understanding the reason we are providing these criticisms.  We want a better game and a game we believe can be delivered within reason.  We dont need this game to suddenly be something it isn't.  We just want it to be the best version of an onlone fallout game it can be.  Most of the suggestions have been reasonable we arent asking for the world just for the world we are in to be better.
---
Who's been tanking TSE?
---
I'm lvl 130+ and I've been farming Whitesprings with everyone else. Never had an explosive legendary at all.
---
I have a 1\* two shot Gauss that'll get nerfed soon. I've never had any chance in PvP since my only chance is sneaking in massive damage at long range and I don't like attacking the few players actully using workshops. They're so few as it is.
---
What legendary effect you get makes a world of difference but some weapons is just rubbish whatever effect you get, like many pistols and energy weapons.
---
I know what you are referring to, I see it mostly with super mutants where it will show like 10 grenades, then change to a board and some gunpowder.
---
These are her loot drops, I have gotten ultracite PA plans and legendaries when looting at melee when she dies, so I don't think it's that. I don't have anyone I play with though to confirm it, just a suspicion. 
---
Or they could allow private servers and mods.
---
You don't know me so...
---
It's a low effort game mode to make a few people happy for a month before they get bored of pvp cancer and quit.
---
It took them 5 seconds to make, it's just a couple of tweaked settings.
---
(If you don't like it, then just stay on the normal servers)
---
Hehe. Love it 
---
man, if you're level 53, and bored already, then maybe new content isn't your answer. That seems like a very short amount of time to give up on the game already, but to each his/her own. The existing content should easily push you towards level 80-100, if you like to explore and not rush through the missions. 
---
There will be the new PVP mode, which you can either bring your existing character over (you'll be in the same position you are now) or create a new one. New vaults will open ,which may or may not help your boredom, due to unknown added content/playtime. 
---
What do you want there to be? What is making you bored?
---
Starfield comes out first
---
I was shocked by how useless they were! I wasted so many tasty Quantum's on those shite grenades. Not sure what they intended for them, because they have the smallest blast radius I've seen for a throwable. 
---
Bethesda doesn't deserve this level of quality feedback.
---
Now all I can think of is Ralfi (Udo Kier) in Johnny Mnemonic, yelling, “NOT IN ZE HEAD!”
---
I just hit lvl 47, and only have 1/2 the map explored.
---
I've only completed the first couple main and side quests so far, and figure at this point I'll wait u til I hit 50 to start. 
---
I think it's because I'm obsessive about seeing everything, and exploring every nook/cranny of the map. Brings me lots of joy.
---
I don't find the ammo that scarce. If you've got full explosive perks its a pretty decent weapon for big creature and crowds that you have a bit of distance on, in my experience anyway
---
I got mine from a trailer near Berkeley Springs :-)
---
The worst thing about hockey gear is you have a couple different gear storage camps.
---
1) Hang &amp; dry after every practice, game, etc.  Wash at the end of the season.
---
2) Play game, throw gear in bag, bag goes in car trunk until the next game.  Usually smells worse than if someone rolled in fresh pig poop.
---
So they kill you and take all your junk.... Woah, lost a whole 2-3 caps...
---
Scaling damage, it "helps" level out pvp. In reality either way if you gotta bounty, you gonna get 1 shot
---
Nah its easy to do at 20.
---
You'll be fine unless your build is really really bad and you only have 1 thumb!
---
Well, you can only find it from creatures at ground zero of a nuke blast is all I meant :P I am familiar with ionization 
---
You got any proof?
---
You experienced a glitch but then actively made use of that glitch which puts you into exploit territory which is probably why you were banned.  
---
Honestly, i rarely use it. User interface is not very intuitive.
---
You people just want Fallout 5
---
Not sure, I'll look at the ESM and test in game to see if it get shared as well.
---
VATs the grenade on top of your target. I picked up a cheap explosive pipe pistol and even a close enough miss will set it off. Grenades became so much more useful when enemies don't have time to run from them.
---
Exactly. 
---
The reason the launcher and ammo all weigh such an incredible amount is because it is supposed to devastate whatever it hits! As it stands now it's useless
---
&gt;new PvP mode
---
2 months away.
---
&gt;New vaults will open
---
Feels like it’s gonna be after PvP now so no PvE content for ages.
---
&gt;What do you want there to be?
---
Story, NPCs, group content outside of events (think raids), endgame.
---
I'm just to see I'm not the only one who stopped bothering with locks &amp; hacks just because perk swapping is tedious and the loot is worthless lol
---
you don't like hearing Mr. 5x5 13 times every hour?   why do you hate the game??????
---
I got mine from the lewisburg station vendor a few hours ago
---
Ya you can't wart the pa till 25. Part of the quest wants you to register it. So you have to wear it to finish it. But you can craft it easy.
---
PvE players apparently didn’t want Fallout 76.  They want a post apocalyptic Sims.
---
Train station cap balances aren't a server issue (hopping won't refresh a vendor with no caps). Those are instanced to each player and refresh 24 hours after initially trading with a vendor from that faction and each faction has it's own pool of caps (raider vendors, responder vendors, watoga, brotherhood, enclave, free states, etc). There's a map somewhere online showing the faction of each trader but most are obvious.
---
The only bug I'm aware of with vendors that's fixed by server hopping is that sometimes they show zero caps and really they have 200. BUT if you try selling something to them anyway it will suddenly show the correct amount of caps (minus the cost of whatever you just sold them) so you actually don't have to server hop to fix that. If their caps are really zero it'll tell you they don't have enough caps.
---
Which duping exploits are from Fo4? As far as I know, they all involve some kind of server disconnect manipulation.
---
Pumping more and more Legendary item's into the game devalue's them though doesn't it?
---
Best way to get people onto the new BETA servers are to fix duping and make people start new characters. That way there would be no duped items on the new servers whats so ever. 
---
Best incentive to play on the new servers right there imho.
---
Its a great post, but don't you dare insult my Machete. I love my machete. Ive got a whole build for chopping up ghouls into steak.
---
I've been seeing this trio of nuke launches more frequently lately, and similarly, people who likely stack Bobbleheads killing her before I can even fast travel there.  I've gotten to the point where I don't really care to participate unless it seems to go on for a minute or two.  I write off the instant kills as either dupers at work, and/or some kind of organized group grinding for Legendaries to sell.
---
Thanks for all of you help!
---
I shall bare that in mind, thanks.
---
And static objects inside of homes and on the streets like boxes and untouchable broken lamps. I need to be able to replace these broken things with a working replica. You have no idea how many times I've found an empty suburban home to build in but can't remove any of the static furniture and junk. 
---
I really like the faction currencies thing, but if it's done, it would need to be done in line with what the faction stands for. For instance:  
---
\- BoS: gathering technology and hoarding it to protect people from themselves  
---
\- The Responders: Aid those in need all around Appalachia  
---
\- Raiders: Take care of yourself first, bring chaos to others  
---
\- Free States: they're essentially preppers, so hoarding resources like food, water, and ammo  
---
\- The Enclave: Maintain superiority of the region through nukes. Possibly turn in those nuke codes to some terminal. Or just keep up with the "accomodations" that we did where we get a point for each scorchbeast
---
It took me like 3-4 mini nukes to kill the grafton monster XD fairly certain if this were real life I'd be dead considering how close it was.
---
I want a survival pvp mode. 
---
All these bored folks who want blood and carnage. I say give them an environment that rewards that.
---
Make them pay extra to fund the resources to do so.
---
There’s all the folks whose inner asshole needs feeding. They need the opportunity to screw folks over.
---
Well, I say have at.
---
If anything a survival mode will weed out the nonhackers and determine through a reiterative culling process, WHO the top assholes are.
---
I sincerely believe establishing a kill or be killed pvp experience will quickly tell folks where they align.
---
Lolz
---
1. Open Trade Menu
---
1. Use buttons indicated by the screen to scroll through categories looking at items
---
1. Select items you'd like to sell on your set, set quantity and price.
---
1. Use buttons indicated on screen to swap to their inventory
---
1. Select the items you want. If it already has a price then just buy it. If it doesn't it will show as requested once you select it.
---
1. Use the button indicated that sorts your inventory to only show offers/requests.
---
1. Finish up by selling requested items (or not) and buying the things they're selling (or not)
---
He was probably duping with the other 23 people. Come to PS4, Xbox is for gayboys. 
---
If I could upvote this more than once I would
---
I installed last night to play to see what changed since the first week of launch. I wish still horribly disappointed.
---
Got off after an hour or two wishing I didn't even give it another chance. 
---
These suggestions make sense, so they won't be introduced.
---
I know what I'm going to be doing this weekend now. Thanks man!
---
No, we just believe in the Fallout universe. We love it like we love our friends and family.
---
Pretty sick. Love the sound they make, very satisfying.
---
I love soothing aussie voices too
---
**You can set things to zero caps to make them free**
---
Rose already has raider radio. I was so disappointed.. And there's the Grafton and watoga ai mayors... Grafton has a different radio but ya...
---
This game is going to die soon. I'll be playing Anthem, The Division 2, Rage 2, and Wargroove soon. Plus Smash Bros on my Switch. I'm sure other people will be doing the same. 
---
Im level 80 on FO76. I turn the game on, farm for legendary weapons for about 45 mins. Encounter numerous bugs and crashes. I say to myself, "why the fuck do I still play this game" and turn it off. I do that almost every day, but recently I've just been skipping Fallout altogether and play something else. 
---
Is there some way to change the volume on individual people or is it strictly "mute, or whatever volume the game wants to do it at"
---
I found the plans at grafton train station vendor with a lot of server hopping. Was around 1200 caps for me. 
---
Lol add me in game bro, If you’re on Pc Same name as reddit
---
what does it take to craft the excavator?
---
There was buildings in both craters. Even a vertibird in one. Maybe a test site, or a military target.
---
Honestly, the thing that will make survival mode fun for me is if you could select a server and have server locked characters, that way you can have dedicated bases, and organise "factions", that way the 2-3 main factions can fight over workshops, set up ambushes etc. and if the leaders of the factions would be in contact, you could organise things like "safe zones" with anyone found killing in there going up on a KoS list with members of each faction being able to kill those players at will. 
---
I have no interest in PVP. Games in the past give rewards for playing the game with more risk, fallout 4, play on survival see more legendarys, metal gear and many others give rewards for playing games at harder levels. My point is maybe you would care about it if there was a reason, and if you still do not care then don't play that mode, many others will.
---
Yea I spent 1000's of caps buying the same things twice.  That work let me see exactly what I had and narrow down the vendors to get the missing plans.  My friends benefited from all those extras😂.   Good luck finding what you want/need to build a fab C.A.M.P.
---
That sounds so confusing. I am now lost.
---
I'm sure I will make sense of it somehow.
---
I learned the plan “display cases” but I can’t find it anywhere 
---
Emergent Gameplay btw 
---
I would love this. Starting out on destiny 2 I was kinda expecting weekly updates to the community. However they don’t even seam biweekly. I think if they find a way to copy bungies community engagement that would feel great and fans would know what they would be expecting.
---
I LOVE THE LOOK OF THIS!
---
Black titanium. Some screws springs and steel and aluminum I think. Litereally everything for it is obtainable from the mole miners. 
---
Yes, reputation grinding and special faction items fit just right in the game. Even for the PvP team deathmatch you can have BoS vs E or Responders vs idk
---
Your not a griefer at all griefers are horrible people.
---
You my sir are an entertainer and i love your type lol.
---
good to know, will do today and let you know how it goes
---
Fried meat. Stringy meat. Meaty Meat!
---
O ya pulled an all nighter forgot it. I knew one was missing
---
You know it! 
---
There isn't a perk that influences the likelihood of learning a mod, is there?  I haven't found one, if it exists.
---
Logical and thought out. This is the type of feedback that Bethesda needs to hear. 
---
I'll have to agree with you there, the replay on this is lacking right now because of lack of new content. Hopefully they'll drop a DLC real quick.
---
The biggest replyability for me was to experience the story solo, then roll with a friend. Try a few different builds with each having their own different fighting style: Sneaky Sniper (not party friendly due to how Stealth works currently), Melee, Shotgunner, until I settled on Heavy Weapons.
---
Try doing something out of your comfort zone too: Normally my Heavy is a PA user, so I'm doing a non-pa Rad Melee Build on the side
---
You can't requests a number, just the stimpacks in general.
---
It would be a start getting rid of stacking bobbleheads, the armor and weapons aren't the problem what is a problem though is the dupers making them less rare to acquire for players to get.
---
Legitimately these weapons/armor are rare as f to find in the wild, even more so 2-3 star variants.
---
The dupers are cloning these items by the bucket load and players are buying them with caps or in most cases real world money just so they can have the edge or compete with others who have them.
---
If survival had no duped items there would be less people walking around with these items as they would've had to legitimately find them in game. Lowers would stand far much more of a chance of living with these odds than having survival with all these players with duped items constantly walking around 
---
Yeah sorry it's hard to explain and can become complicated in practive. If you have questions lmk because I love building basements in this game.
---
I guess think if it as you always build the 1st floor and then the 2nd. Except now, it's your basement and 1st floor. 
---
I built my camp with a giant tree growing up through the middle of it. I found out by accident that I could wire and light it.
---
As a side note, lazy coding doesn't add collision to the trees above the third "floor", so I was able to roof through the tree top to secure my house.
---
BSG forever
---
No I want a fallout online game that is a fallout game not some shell of a fallout game online
---
If only it had Quad ammo as well, that would make it even more OP
---
Outer Worlds are coming first my man, and after that we'll see if you will ever want to play a Bethesda game again.
---
This can't possibly go wrong, I mean it's not like there's a whole market full of duplicated items out there players will cheat with...right?
---
Bioware release anthem next month just saying..
---
I'd also add to the "no gear" bit and also as no mutations they make a big difference.
---
Here's the material requirements broken down by part...  
---
[https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Excavator\_power\_armor](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Excavator_power_armor)  
---
...and you'll want to start holding on to all of your gears, screws, and springs.
---
Air Force here. I can confirm they are also used to say "goodbye" (as in -chain you under it and leave it on while everyone points and laughs)
---
What good is legendary TSE If it’s sitting on a shelf?
---
If you have one, it’s demanding to be used. It needs to be seen and experienced
---
You need to be able to appreciate the hard work you went to get it.
---
Whether you got legitimately via drop. Or an eBay duped.
---
All I’m saying is if you want pvp, you can’t dip your toes in to see if the water is too hot or cold.
---
You go ALL IN.
---
It’s called survival mode, not kiddie pool pvp.
---
Go Big, Or stay home.
---
The fusion core created here are always 100%, too!
---
You have to think about it as ressources management. In a perfect world where working on a features wouldn't mean ignoring another one, I'd agree with you. Sadly, they have limited ressources, and maybe that making this mode will make 10 people not working on bugs, adding weapons, balance, etc.
---
I'm just hesitant to see this turning into old-school Quake with everyone firing missile launchers at eachother.
---
You only need about 2 pieces to fill bar
---
I use a instigating fat man to cheap shot bounty’s but apart from that it’s useless and I’ll probably ditch it once I have my trophy 
---
Spot stays occupied as far as I know
---
I don't know about you but the only reason I bought this game was because it was a multiplayer PvP/ PvE game 
---
Can you explain what I watched in your video?
---
&gt; *Dies*
---
&gt; *Pipboy drops*
---
I'm really not sure what this has to do with our conversation about level 40 vs level 50 weapons..
---
Umm, no - I mean gathered over 247 hours of gameplay and stored in my stash for a time when I want them.
---
Herein lies one of the real problems with Fallout 76 - players who encounter other players with higher levels, better gear, rarer items etc automatically assume they have somehow cheated their way to it, when the reality is that they have played their way through the game. Players are unable to differentiate between cheaters and legit gamers because they are unable to suspend envy through disbelief that others have played in a way that you don't think they should.
---
If you spend your time building settlements, sitting round a camp fire playing the banjo, 'exploring' or just casually chumming around you will be geared and specc'd worse than a player who logs in and spends every single minute earning XP by killing legendary enemies. What you have in an RNG based game is based on how efficiently you spend your time whilst playing it, but because this is Fallout too many people think it will just reward you in the same way a single player game does and it doesn't.
---
The root and soul purpose of a video game is to let go of stress, challenge the brain, and have fun. You are doing the exact opposite.
---
Yeah took Daisycutter made it into a two shot and mirv launcher only 1600 damage all said and done. Y is the explosive mini 800 dam and it's a 5mm round and full spin nothing can survive but screen completely filled with mini nukes and a mole rat still nibbles at your feet???? Weird...
---
Enhance the dozing features in camp building so I can move big rocks and trees out of the way.
---
I’m ashamed to admit that I laughed at this...
---
Hes a rare spawn traveling vendor 
---
I wouldn't.

I have a mic but sometimes it's not feasible to use it. I don't want randos to *know* I have a mic by default because then they'll spam at me to turn it on or harass for not using it. I'd rather just no mic/muted mic be the same symbol.
---
I haven't the slightest clue what you're talking about. Sounds like an insult though, so good job at the internet.
---
This combined with Can Do, I rarely need to cook unless I want buffs. Wavy Willard's has a ton of trash cans that can be searched with Can Do. Dog food and purified water for days.
---
Poseidon Energy - near Charleston - has aluminum, lead, fusion cores and uranium (nuclear material). If you do go for that one thought, make sure you repair and clear out the plant before taking over the workshop, otherwise, you'll have to deal with both events at once. 
---
Its not even worth it with ordnance? 
---
Anyone have a map of his path? I see varied results when I search.
---
Everywhere. He moves
---
Except no one is going to go to the PvP mode unless they want to kill others.
---
Literally 100% of people in survival will be there to kill others. You won't see people doing quests because why would you. No one will want to fight the sbq in survival. There is no incentive to pve in the PvP mode.  It's not a horrible idea but it's also not going to solve anything. Pvpers will flock to the PvP mode and kill each other then quit from all the other issues in the game.
---
You have made my day, when I get round to building my camp.. I now know where my lights are going!
---
Actually bgs said back in December they were going to open a vault before the end of January.. Guess that's not happeneing now.
---
There is a map of his path. I found him at NAR Repair yard near Watoga fighting scorched. 
---
The thing is, I don't think this will take a few assholes elsewhere. Griefers will stick around on the PvE server because there isn't any "fun" in attacking and tormenting people who are expecting it. 
---
You and me both! Well, a stable game actually. I rarely get bumped from the server, I just crash to desktop every. time. I. play!
---
Have you guys played DayZ? LOL
---
OK thx
---
Everything in your inventory is alphabetized by default too. Your holotapes in your inventory are in alphabetical order, but they’re not alphabetized in the menu to load them into a terminal. Not only that, but it’s completely random as to what order they end up on that screen.
---
That would solve so many issues. You get my upvote!

---
 &gt; It is clear from this post how much you love and care for this game and I thank you for taking the time to write out such a clear and cohesive post. T...
---
Would be very practical indeed.
---
Than use it on the queen or a behemoth or something or at least use it on adventure mode, with survival mode the incentive is to great for dupers they get aid items more caps and don’t have to wait for other players to accept pvp.
---
Seriously? That’s some bunk. Took max rank thinking it’d boost my fat man, broadsider, missile launcher, etc
---
Guess I can swap that out now 
---
My mini nukes barely broke 900 damage with max explosive damage, big guns are a joke :(
---
If your camp is there, you own that spot regardless if anything is built.
---
Guy sounds like a jerk, I wouldn't have moved it.
---
Just take an empty frame you own, place it, transfer the higher level armor to it, then wait for the frame to automatically be recalled.
---
Thats not a perk though. I mentioned perks im pretty sure
---
Reddit echochamber =/= majority.
---
Nice try tho
---
Well if your at your camp and you need to go north travel to 76 free then to where you need to go either by foot or fast travel because you are closer to say Grafton from 76 than your camp the price will be less for fast travel.
---
Not really. I'm lvl 130+ and using a TS gaussrifle with all rifle perks (something like 15 cards) and stealth perks I still need three shots to kill a hermit crab if I'm in hidden/caution the whole time.
---
With a non-legendary? at least 5 - 10 shots.
---
Thanks, but I like my way better. I found a random brown bag about a month ago that had 10k 10mm and well over 5k of all ballistic ammo save the .50 ball and .38. It also had 998 2mm rounds. Since then, I got the ammosmith or whatever perk so I stay ahead of my usage. Thanks for advising of the duper perk, i didn't even notice it. 
---
By the way, If i needed the ammo, I would try yours out. 
---
Do it! I'll tell you now it will be frustrating because of how difficult it is to build bunkers, basements and into caves neatly, but so rewarding! And post the results in a new thread here and at r/fallout76settlements
---
For most sets if your scrap an arm you get an arm mod. But there are a few sets like trapper and combat armor and possibly robot/marine, where scrapping an arm can give you a leg mod and vice versa because the plans seems to state limbs/chest vs arm+leg+chest.
---
Every time I vendor junk in Flatwoods, I try the pie machine across the street.  A few weekends ago I lackadaisically pressed it like always and...the plate stayed upright. Literally screamed.
---
My boyfriend asked me what happened assuming the worst and when I yelled "PIE!! PIIIIE!!!!" he just shook his head lmao.
---
Never was able to get one in FO4 and figured it'd be a few months before I got one in FO76, but diligence pays off! :) I do still wish they had some kind of unique effect or allowed you to place in CAMP...I can't part with it, but it is useless in my stash.

Since you played since beta you will REALLY notice the slow level progression (compared to launch)
---
No 900 xp bear kills, no 500-800 xp/ghoul etc. Having said that ghouls are still probably your best bed
---
see post below
---
Does any game get this? I mean DLC comes out for games with little to no warning. Updates for hugely successful games like Counter Strike: Global Offensive drop seemingly out of nowhere. I think you should expect to hear about major updates with 2 weeks notice and maybe hints about new play modes and DLC's but I don't think a full "road map" is ever going to happen.
---
Never with anything addictive, although I turn a healthy profit off them using Pharma Farma/Hard Bargain.
---
IIRC, you can use the recent players list to rejoin the same world as long as anyone else is still in it..
---
This is kind of his point.  For dupers they can be obtained easy.  For someone benefiting from duping they can be obtained (around 50k).  For someone playing the game legit they are out of touch.  PvP mode as it stands dupers have a huge advantage.
---
 Bad idea to use TSE as your example. "You need to be able to appreciate the hard work you went to get it."  
---
If there was any hard work into getting these weapons maybe. But a large majority are duped weapons. I do feel for the legit players that got them, but those people are rare, and duping has ruined that particular gun.
---
No.  Gold plated luchadore undies or gtfo. I have spoken. 
---
Does it matter how you die in pacifist mode?
---
If anything the only delta is, how quickly.
---
Until pvp survival mode is enabled continue to see bored assholes w/TSE.
---
Until then I server hop.
---
Can you vats a grenade throw? 🤔
---
The incentive for PVE is xp and loot. Just like in adventure mode. The blog post also mentions that people in events cant kill each other. So you can still come together and do the scorch queen event without killing each other.
---
Well this explains why I have found myself glowing purple or red on occasion for no apparent reason (not using chems or in any power armor) followed by a CTD.
---
Nahh capped at 300 
---
Generators are almost always empty these days (On PC anyway) and Frames are often empty. The fix to core regen on login and nerf to core respawn rates has made them rarer AND in more demand. I may start taking power plants soon.
---
I'm lvl 72 and still not bored!
---
Man i was hoping for some kind of a guild system. Make your own factions. Creat rules or a code they go by for a role play aspect. Make different ranks and titles. The goal was for the players to make a community of their own right? Maybe even form allied or rival factions. Make straight out war with some. Could see making a capture the flag game. Trying to claim workshops across the map. Build a base and defend it. It would definatly change up game play and give more players a reason to work in group's.
---
If so (and orbital scan beacons) then some places like Whitespring with plenty of mobs and plenty of people could be DC / CTD hell.
---
There is also a frame inside the transportation building but you might have to pic a lvl3 door
---
Just like everyone else says, I kept checking Vendors. I’m pretty sure it was at Grafton. Every time I played I was checking the vendors and I got lucky. It’s kind of annoying it’s the only way but it is what it is.
---
Hrrm. I can't stand the Grafton mayors voice. I usually mute when the Grafton events spawn. 
---
Cripes, sounds like the average player dropped the game before reaching level 50 or play really freaking slowly.
---
Start hitting offices for deskfans, typewriters, etc. (and be sure to grab the clipboards for springs too). The rest should be pretty easy, but if you're still short capture a Workshop that has Junk extractors and you'll be set in no time 👍
---
Gorge Junkyard has extractors for Junk and Black Titanium and should really help you with your Excavator suit.
---
I disagree and feel this is coming not from the heart but a hurt pride. First off the trolling is no where near as bad as people make it out. Heck I've been in it since the beta and have been attacked twice. Once by accident and once because I punched a wall and became wanted. While the evidence is of course anecdotal like all, it can't be that bad if it isn't widely accruing. So really forcing people to start new would not help, but hinder a new mode. You may want to go in as a dweller, but PVP is about glory and not many people would want to bring a pipe pistol instead of their glorious legendary into battle. Who would want to spend months on a combat character to never use it or show it off? No, sorry but this idea not only seems unnecessary, but cowardly. 
---
One thing to consider about a missile launcher buff is that it might have to extend to enemies too, so if it gets a buff, expect mole miners to make you eat shit too.
---
If anything, I could see a 20%, or 30% damage boost being good enough, and then a reduction  of ammo weight from 3 to 1.5.
---
I don't want the other to see all the things I have. I don't trust this system and it takes forever. I select the goods I want to sell and those are the things my trading parnter gets access to. In the trade window I see only a tab at the others inventory with the things that are selected for trade.
---
If you go to a shop to buy a pack of gum, do you pour the entire contents of your backpack on the table and let the shopkeeper rummage through your things while you search for your coins to pay the gum?
---
This is true. Super weak and weigh way too much. It's a fun thing to mess with when you pick it up for the first time. Launch a few. But it's just not worth the weight.
---
&gt;Cry
---
I don't think i'm at all clever. Its just that you think whining on reddit will make people turn the other cheek.
---
Keep crying. No one gives a shit.
---
I’ve been attacked and attack people with slap damage with a TSE shotty and it does a few hp of damage. The multiple pellets mechanic didn’t seem to play any role in how much damage i or the other players took. I actually had a lvl 15 explosive double barrel that I ended up dropping because I constantly killed my self and it made the game difficult trivial other than managing my accidental suicides.
---
And if it was that simple - that any TSE shotgun could one shot a person in pacifist - every post would be about this and there’s be proof everywhere. Or at least one piece of video proof. 
---
Instead we have a lot of people with varied claims and no actual evidence that TSE or buff stacking have any effect on slap damage numbers.
---
In appalachia
---
So when you’re “wanted” the damage is boosted and you can’t defend yourself?
---
Yeah I just don't want it in another server.  Have you ever tuned into hunter vs hunted? Lol
---
I hope when they port your character it only means level and perk cards. Not your stash and inventory
---
You lose armor perks and deep pockets, also sometimes it’s bugged...
---
thanks! where’s Gorge?
---
I would love to see stats on the Shop. Even on the forums, some people are "pink princess bed? WTF is Bethesda thinking?" and others are like "pink princess bed is the most outrageously stupid thing I have ever seen! I must have one!" So it would be interesting to see what kind of stuff is selling or whether the Atom Shop hate is deserved because of their poor item selections or whether it isn't because crazy stuff sells and you are salty because you personally didn't find anything interesting. 
---
If you want to play the new pvp mode, allowing current characters forces everyone to become part of the dupe crowd, if you want to be competitive. Jumping in with any less than meta gear, you will just become food. 
---
What about increase workshop speed by x3?
---
I'm in the same boat brother. I spent ~10 hours grinding for legendary drops and have just picked up another game. It felt like a complete waste of time at the current drop rate for useful items. I got a decent Grognaks and Shotgun with the bloodied perk but that was over the course of 80 hours playing through the content. I sure as hell can't do another 80 hours to get two decent legendary items if none of the content is fresh. I loved my time with the game, but I can't help shake the feeling that I could spend another 80 hours in-game, if there was just something worth my time doing. PVP, that ain't it chief.
---
This explains my crashes, for the love of god can Bethesda pay attention to this thread?!?!??
---
I cannot wait for the challenge!
---
Id rather have a co-op game that way we get a full fallout experience with friends
---
If they were going to add player hubs, it definitely wouldn't be in the pvp kiddy game mode
---
You've defenitely come to the right sub then. Full of fanboys and cringey armchair developers with "grea ideas" everyday.
---
I don't even think this map is accurate. I've seen him at camden park and south of the pumpkin house, neither of which are on the map.
---
So basically the whole map :-)
---
I get what you mean now.. Sorry, I'm a little slow.
---
Brilliant :)
---
I only disagree with the point you try to make about players losing chems and other shite on death. The whole core aspect of surviving is to do whatever you can to survive. If you don't want to lose your shit, go to PvE, casul. Have you even though of this? Your whole choice? Tge mere *fact* you have a choice to play this or not?
---
Surviving shouldn't be made easy for you people. Thats what pve mode is for. It should punosh you, because that also means you can punish others for your own gain, after youve lost so much. 
---
I'm no casual, so if you suggest they turn PvP into some pink clusterfluff bullshit experience, where timmy gets a participation trophy for wanting to sit the game out because its "too hard", or rather for this scenario, "too punishing", then there may as well be slap damage added to survival and removed completely from regular. 
---
For anything core PVP, you do *NOT* speak for all of us. We live and play for the thrill of losing it all, or taking what we want with a glorious feeling, called triumph. 
---
Tried and people complain of the echo from the speakers. 
---
I just wish I could sell the ammo.  I don't care about selling bullets, honestly.  Just selling a missile or mini nuke would be great. 
---
With the chameleon armor, more than 1 piece makes you *more* invisible.
---
Happens with my murica painted t-60 and excavator armors as well
---
True, I didn't express my idea correctly.  What I meant to say is that if hearting a weapon makes it safe from dropping in pvp that they should limit it to a smaller number of possible hearts. Like allow a person to favorite 3 weapons tops so they have to be very selective about what they carry and risk losing. 
---
This isn't a moving story by any means, you traded a thing for the single most duped weapon on xbox
---
*Very* close to the Vault. From there head East, sorta towards Morgantown.
---
Not so PC master race I guess lol
---
Legitimately trying to find any of the set is hard let alone a full set as the odds of legendary drops are random.
---
What isn't rare though are players buying the pieces off dupers, the scarcity of these items is less so because of this reason and why most highers have these items in the first place because they've bought them off dupers
---
I like this but would add factions into the mix. People can still solo if they want to but if they get into trouble can call for faction assistance.
---
Other power armors are made for combat protection/effectiveness, Excavator was designe to let miners work much, much more efficiently, that means being able to move/cary more ore, meaning they spend less time on return trips and more time actually mining (less trips needed as they cary more, means they get the same amount of work done in less time).  So they are actually built for different reasons.
---
Excavator, for this reason, provides notably less protection than the other power armors and doesn't have the option for things like jetpacks or targeting computers as it's not designed for combat.  If it's 'I'm for moving alot of heavy stuff efficiently' bonus was made on all PA, what point would there be to using Excavator as that is it's primary role.
---
If I want lawn flamingos, why can't I just take the flamingos from this bombed-out home and put them at mine?  Why do I have to learn how to physically manufacture lawn flamingos? 😂
---
I believe this is a good change because it will draw more aggressive players into survival lowering casual players chance of finding a griefers
---
We may speak for a much smaller portion but we speak with more knowledge of the game don't you think?  I think my 450hrs speaks for something yes?
---
yep, fixed a while ago with Weapon Artisan as well
---
Yeah, my camp is on top of a lead deposit which has a big tree on either side. They're just about 4 foundation blocks apart so I can fit my camp in between just fine, but then when I get up to the second or third floor, the branches and leaves are clipping through the walls into my bedroom.
---
Considering the explosive perks give a lot more for their cost it's pretty reasonable to need the perks.
---
The damage buff is 20% per perk instead of 10/5%
---
The weight reduction makes a much larger difference due to the higher weight.
---
The AoE perk is more optional.
---
Based on what I have seen you will find that teams of level 150+ players with chameleon armor/mutations/stealthboys and vats rifle sniper builds with 3 star legendary weapons hunting individual players and other groups and dominating the leaderboards.  If you are a solo player you are a caps stash waiting to happen for these teams and forget about camps, they are too easy to take out.  I think they are underestimating the number of people that will be attracted to this kind of play given their product history, but time will tell, I could be wrong on all counts.
---
I appreciate the detailed response.
---
So, no way to set prices while not in the trade menu right?  Does it remember your pricing for the next trade window (another person or even the same)?
---
Thanks again.
---
Oh so painfully aware
---
There should be a downside though, I vote that legendary gear breaks when you die
---
There have been a million requests, but these are better ways to improve the game dynamic and longevity. I agree with the OP.
---
I had mine set up with the homing sight.  I would unload four shots at a Scorchbeast and see maybe one hit, with disappointing results.  Predictably worse with the Queen...
---
GLs are a special kind of crap, I can't even target reliably!
---
I'm just starting to get a feel for the Daisy Cutter, used it on a Yau Guai the other day...
---
I'm telling this in a more journalistic way to expose how people get these weapons. I can't even use it at the moment because it's a Level 45 and I'm still only level 33.
---
Can't throw a grenade in VATS but you can target a grenade in VATS.
---
Ya np 👍 if you're good on Titanium though you're better off taking the Junkyard south of Poseidon, it has 3 Junk extractors instead of 1 iirc
---
I can't wait! I'd personally love for other players to be invited to play with you. 
---
Well, I was lagging so bad yesterday in a sbq fight I apparently dropped my tse bp pistol....so 🤷‍♂️ fuck me right. Not sure how it happened and we didn’t even kill her because “lol pistol build” maybe I’ll find another some day. Time to start dropping nukes again I guess. On whitesprings not rift prime...
---
Just like how Rust does it
---
Screenshot that message and send to Bethesda.
---
We are infighting like the responders, brotherhood, and free states fought over Appalachia. No one wins
---
First, Excavator has a set bonus of +100 weight and double ore from mining.
---
Second, none of the other PA have this set bonus, but you can add calibrated shocks to the legs.
---
Third, you are seeing a +200 bonus due to a bug.  If you exit and reenter the set without leaving game, you should see your weight bonus drop by 100.
---
nowhere near good on titanium... i need almost everything. are you on PS4? you could help me with some high level mole miners
---
You're saying "remember this story" like it's a major event though, those shotguns sell for 100-200 caps on the lfg and are literally everywhere 
---
You know ABSOLUTELY NONE of that was true, right? No one could ever steal anything. It was made up and pushed by a community of FO76 haters. 
---
You misspelled horse armor.
---
I do this with my Rad shower.
---
This is my problem, exactly.    
---
I got to 115, and have completed the map.   There is very little incentive to play at this point, unless I choose to join the server hopping crowd to farm legendaries.   
---
My wife has played with me since launch; she's still holding on as an avid Fallout fan, but even she is starting to feel the 'fatigue'.    
---
The fixes are too slow, and the additions are non-existent so far.  The first major content we can expect will be a broken PvP mode, (I'm all for PvP, but permitting current characters and duped inventory into the mode is the worse idea they've had so far), which is still 2 months away.
---
I was doing some reading, and I saw a few folks talking about some of the plans they bought off of Grahm not being correct.  You would read the plan, and learn something completely unrelated.
---
It sounds like that may be what happened with us.
---
Then 1* explosive weapons would be stronger than many 3* non explosive weapons. IF ANYTHING 2shot should have moved to the second star, not the other way around 
---
Don't I use bumpers?  Not sure why I think I use bumpers.  But it goes both ways, higher to lower and back down depending.  I just did it last night.  Basically I'm no help, just wondering.
---
Eh..
---
IT roadmaps are what I see in terms of specific operational  solutions based on strategic business decisions.
---
You all know this is a game? Lolz
---
Our professional careers don’t depend if a project milestone isn’t met, or if patch management didn’t align, or a key portion of program didn’t switch to agile from waterfall..
---
It’s just a game..
---
I did not. Thanks. 
---
Your tse isnt gonna do a damn thing vs players with full sentinal/cavalier assassin armor sets. A fresh start is desperately needed for the survival mode to work. If people cant see this they're down right delusional. 
---
2 months late - but google doesn't show many people talking about earthquakes. 
---
I was at Camden Park and felt/heard multiple earthquakes. Never happened before.
---
Look on the map, and there is an event "Lode Bearing". So I go there, and the event is "loot the mine before it collapses". Earthquakes were causing rocks to fall, and the timer counted down. Then I got trapped inside and died.
---
After that event was over, I didn't notice any more earthquakes.
---
Great post but sadly it's probably going to fall on deaf ears. From all the evidence we've seen thus as well as a bad critical reception and poor sales, fo76 most likely has a skeleton team behind it now that can barely keep up with bugs let alone do an entire rehaul like you've described, despite the fact that it's desperately needed. It sucks because I had high hopes with fo76 and I still enjoy my time with it, but Bethesda's greed and laziness for lack of a better term absolutely ruined their chances of making this game succeed, which is good in a way; I want their shitty behavior punished. I just wish it wasn't a game in my favorite franchise.
---
I mean calling the people who created this wonderful (albeit buggy as hell) game basically out of touch lunatics that know shit about making games.
---
Bethesda is made up from people too.
---
Dev changes a lot from what’s talked about and what’s delivered, especially in agile.
---
It's funny how people have differing views of this. I see PVP as the serious mode and adventure as the care bear mode and player hubs are useful for both. In the former they server as a place to group up especially if they were faction based. In the latter people and group up for PVE and trading... and maybe fashion shows. ;)
---
Yup. This game mode took less time than fixing a bug to make, and it will keep some people happy for a month before they get bored
---
Yeah
---
I use just cause i have them but not regular so there is no addiction. 
---
Well it doesn't take too much Titanium thankfully, Gorge should be able to set you up quickly 😃 I recommend making a blueprint of your setup so you can pop your extractors &amp; defenses up quickly if you get disconnected or crash or just are doing it repeatedly in different play sessions.
---
Have been playing for over a month with this issue, logging in/out, server hopping occasionally.  Has always added 200 to capacity.  Did not know about the calibrated shocks mod though, thanks.
---
I guess? Weird dig. As I understand it PS4 is blue screening a lot as well.
---
Everything in fallout 76 feels like a side quests and what should be a main quest ( following the overseer to some kinda ending) is an unfinished side quest.
---
Agreed, at lvl 217 I always try to grab some lower level guys while at WS.  I think I was about lvl40 when I had a "white knight" do the same.  It's one of the things that still gives me joy in the game.  
---
Spot on, do you usually play solo or grouped?
---
Let's be real here.
---
You knew the offers seemed shady.
---
It's essentially the same thing as buying merchandise that you know was stolen. 
---
Well you don't have that and won't have that so either find another game or get over it.
---
Must be a bug, have had +200 ever since I built it.  Thanks for info.
---
I know that I personally know more of the latter than the former in the pink princess bed situation lol
---
Im on Xbox.... Couldn't say for ps4
---
Allow me.
---
Not my experience at all. Granted I don’t play console, but I’ve had VERY few griefers with about 350 hours played. I had one guy wipe out my alt’s camp, I *think* for being in his spot (although it’s also at the Charleston pond, so maybe he didn’t like me interfering with the vendor spawn... I should move). Other than that, basically nothing negative. 
---
Welp nothing like taking the time and resources to take a workshop only to have it stolen and can't do anything about it because the game crashes when I try to respawn. Every. Damn. Time.
---
I can't say if it's accurate or not. I've seen him elsewhere too.
---
I cannot confirm or deny. Shady? Sure. But still, I don't like assuming things.
---
But they often are, think about the number of people posting about crashing as they start the Queen, or fast travel to WhiteSprings after launching a Nuke and getting disconnected.... 
---
You realize they can only grab your junk, right?!? And that’s IF they kill you. And that’s only after IF you hit them back to enter PVP. Who fucking cares if they see your weapons / armor? They can literally do NOTHING about it. Y’all are insane. 
---
This is sick!! :D
---
I have been toying with the idea of incorporating a "working" [courtyard/atrium](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/88/94/9b/88949b81ebd7a7688189fd33a55959e7.jpg) some day to grow plants, but like you said finding a plot with good natural terrain is...difficult. This is *so* lovely and more spacious than I was thinking haha. Love the statuary and the variegated roofline!
---
So the siren...when triggered it gives you a little message in the top left of the screen? Or you can just hear it in the area? I haven't messed with it yet and don't quite understand their purpose.
---
I know man that's why zathrus' comment confused me 
---
It makes it so that you have a chance of finding canned food and purified water in coolers fridges, and in my opinion most importantly, trashcans. Just do a run of the whitesprings with this perk active and you'll have plenty of food. I also noticed it sometimes gives you two pieces of food.
---
really? They are that weak?
---
In one way, yes.
---
In another, it puts you impressively out of touch with what a majority of the playerbase is experiencing.
---
No worries buddy. Cool thing is if you are on a team, your teammates camps work the same way. 
---
Yes. I'm looking for competitive builds that don't screw people over on SBQ. Next patch there will only be a handful (Melee/Unarmed,  VatsRifle, and Shotgun unless pellets are fixed). In this patch Heavy is also amazing, and Pistol can be okay - but that changes next week.
---
As of now, the pvp servers are just going to be where the griefers get their kicks, and having a player hub will just give them a place to camp and kill players.
---
(Also they said that vault 76 is one of the only respawn points which is a joke, since people will camp there as well. They'll also kill and spawn kill every single lvl 1 who comes out of the vault until they quit)
---
I don't think there will be wanted players.  Sounds to me like Survival will be anything goes, which means there wouldn't be a need to put a bounty on anyone's head.
---
Try switching the Targeting HUD on your helmet for another mod and see if it helps.
---
Bullshit. Post a video. It’s already been well documented with video proof that even stacking bobble heads can’t one shot you in pacifist.  Stop spreading lies 
---
I was doing the same for a while because I wanted to capacity but I eventually got shocks on my T60.  The bug does not effect other PA because they don't have the set bonus to begin with.  Also, if you change servers while outside of Excavator, you won't get the +200 when reequipping... at least I never did.
---
Pharma perk, search every health box.  90% chance to find more goodies, and it's more likely to be stims and radaway or radx.
---
I prefer the word, friends
---
We have a [discord](https://discord.gg/ZrbGXu) that you can join and find people to play with :)
---
I disagree, I also have 2 alts at level 12 and 29.
---
Nah. There’s video proof even the bobble heads won’t let you oneshot someone in pacifist 
---
Junk pile in your camp
---
&gt;hundreds of newcomers who are excited to try the new mode are just going to get slaughtered day 1 and thrown into a deadly circle of greifers.
---
Have to remember this because this is likely exactly what is going to happen.
---
Could you imagine how long it would take to load if it was legit?  I had a quad revolver, took 33 seconds to reload.  So lame
---
Tbh our current Adventure mode is really the alpha release of fo76, survival will be the actual gameplay beta now that they have kinda addressed some of the major crashes. Which is all insanely insulting considering how long Fo4 has been out, and that we have all paid for this thing to happen.
---
I appreciate that, and I am on PC. I'll probably be okay though, as I have no problem with gaining enough gunpowder, and I've taken to hitting up a few iron nodes in the wild near my CAMP (they're not in a setting where one could set up an extractor on them, . . . I think). I know about the places one can mine for lead, but I'm hoping to build the excavator pa first to make that more efficient and to help with defensive stats in those areas. Just wish more enemies dropped 5.56, and that super duper came at a lower level.
---
This.  I have been a stalwart propronent of the game verging on "white knighting".  I haven't had disconnect problems as bad, I have a generally enjoyable time in the game, I've done hte main questline several times, discovered most locations, haven't seen everything yet. I've laughed, crie,d been amazed, and truly think Bethesda made a great world.  But... I'm done.
---
When the big feature they announce is a PvP mode that makes no sense to me, I don't feel a need to play anymore. I've gotten my $60 bucks out of the game. 
---
Waiting for KH3, and had FFXV royal edition already installed and haven't touched that game in a year, so time for something different while we wait.
---
Were you ever actually 1 shot in pacifist mode? And if so were you near a workshop?
---
Fair point, but while people organically spread out and acquire items there will not be as extreme a divide of:
---
* People just starting
---
* People decked out and ready to splat
---
And the people getting items/starting out will not be as concentrated in one area as a group of pre-equipped people would be. On day 1 there will be two things to do, wander around looking for someone else with a TSE or smash kids at the vault. If on day 1 there was one thing to do, play from scratch, then by the time people are ready to smash kids then there will be plenty of them around and about.
---
It won't take ALL the griefers. But it will take some of them. Some will decide the rewards are worth the risk.
---
I dont think they will. Because as it stands now. You can move freely between the two of em.
---
Notice the Mr. Handys in and around the vault. Unlike other experiment vaults, this one had the preservation of the vault dweller's humanity in mind. 
---
Keeping a safe and clean environment is more import on this case. The subjects in the experimental vaults only needed to be locked, controlled, and observed for data collection. 
---
Make sure to thank the Mr. Handys outside the vault for being programmed to keep the outside of the vault presentable for your return to the world.
---
Dupers have unfortunantly flooded the game with stupid powerful weapons and armor. But honestly that would have happened eventually over time without any help from exploiters.
---
Since  Inevitably everyone who plays the game long enough would have TSE weapon to equip. No dupers just means everyone is using them way way later on. A year from now we would all have them.
---
Spoiling the natural progression of the end game for the community sucks.  But duping didnt do anything to "unbalance" pvp. With my current set up TSE weapons are not even remoteley a problem. Meaning that there are mechanics in place to balance the opness of these weapons. They dont even need to be nerfed.
---
i am tired of finding new spots for my CAMP - Lately it seems I am placing where others are or they come upon my CAMP and think "Ya this is a great location" and build theirs on a different server. Dedicated servers or locations would be great.
---
You don't have to assume.
---
You don't need to be a mathematician to figure out that someone with a dozen extremely rare items for sale at bargain prices is shady.
---
You have better odds of winning the powerball than you do getting a dozen TSE drops in game.
---
I think they should do away with the perk card system in Survival mode and everyone creates a new character. Everything on Survival is separate from Adventure. Every time you level up you get one point to put in your SPECIAL except in this case S adds melee damage, P adds gun damage, E add HP, C adds barter, I adds energy weapons damage, A for stealth and L for critical. And there's no limit to SPECIAL. So someone could have 100 in Strength and be a melee killing machine etc. But when you die you lose everything. You leave a paper bag and anyone can take your stuff and leave what they don't want. Just my opinion. I don't have time to read through a zillion posts to see if someone already said this. Don't need your hate. Upvote, downvote: I don't care. It's reddit.
---
You can't PVP until level 5. You can respond at your camp and likely other people's camp. Also having them hang out at the vaults puts all the griefers in an easy place to ambush. :)
---
Really? Never realized how weak they were.. course, now that I think of it.. That explains why a Scorched took a missile to the face the other day.. I usually hit them with a Shotgun and one shot them
---
It's more about the things you've learned in those hours than what you're currently doing now.
---
Ahh I can’t remember, but I didn’t have any night time healing related perk cards equipped too if that’s what you were referring to? =o
---
I thought the weapons we're getting a big nerf.  What you on about?
---
PVP at its core, is player vs player.
---
I see to many folks who piggy back off the teams street cred.
---
Individual achievement vs part of a team..
---
That's all well and good man. 
---
Not trying to convince you to do it, just helping you be able to say that you don't want to rather than you don't know.
---
Exactly. A 'no, thank you' emote would be nice.
---
They were duped, so you're not wrong. 
---
Yeah this suggestion is just shortsighted.
---
Makes sense, just thought there was at least some increase in carry capacity with all PA, just more so with excavator because of the reasons you mentioned.  Appreciate the input.  Also I do have HUD targeting on my excavator PA, and was weirdly able to craft it despite not having any of the raw violet flux required while inside at whitespring hotel.  More bugs, I guess. Thanks again.
---
The new servers seemed like a no rules thing, I would have figured they'd remove the pvp before level 5 but maybe not. Either way, I'm sure they're going to allow different respawn points in the end
---
The cheaters and dupers wont feel god like if they're fighting people with the same weapons and armor. They would literally just be slap damaging each other like the current game is in pascifist mode. They get their joy from standing still and watching multiple people unload on them while taking no damage and then proceed to one shot everyone. 
---
Haha true! Challenge accepted, I'll be hunting for it when I can tonight
---
I’ve gotten 13 fusion Cores from doing this so thanks 
---
Not at all, you have to do it every time and it's awful lol
---
I wish it would auto flag things you're looking for as requested, no one ever notices me wanting their blood packs 
---
I think you are wrong. If you take the Reddit users out, I suspect  most regular gamers are probably still exploring and questing with what is already released. Not all of the players are grinding out over 100 levels and blew through the main quest already. 
---
The new mode will be great for the small percentage of players who busted their jut early or just like the pvp aspect of the game without the limiting factors built into the pvp system already. 
---
This is a best of both worlds move. 
---
Or a quest to make a tracker.
---
No fast travel is insane.
---
Limit it to the train stations or something but the map is far to big for no mounts and no fast travel imo.
---
Survial mode is a great idea. I think everyone in this sub has agreed that importing all the dupe tse weapons into survival is dumb, and the answer was to prevent character relocation. I think its would be beneficial to both servers if there were two choices when starting survival mode.  
---
1: start a new character.    
---
2 : Import character level and perk cards only. Items from adventure mode will be destroyed.
---
This would depopulated current servers of TSE weapons somewhat, and allows a slight head start for those willing to give up all worldly belongings to atom. 
---
Tldr.  Do not import stash or inventory. Delete stash and inventory from adventure when switching server. Depopulate TSE guns. 
---
You're different than alot of people than. I don't want to lose progress in an RPG that is counter intuitive
---
What makes you think they've got any idea on what they're doing over there at bethesda. If anything they probably have a roadmap for the atom shop.
---
I do. Diablo is a different game. I’ve never played it and just because that could be more grindy doesn’t mean that this isn’t grindy 
---
They can have the weight with real world damage
---
&gt; That seems like a very short amount of time to give up on the game already
---
Level 53 is a short amount of time?
---
&gt;The existing content should easily push you towards level 80-100, if you like to explore and not rush through the missions. 
---
What is this? 'Finish the content before you decide it is boring'?
---
But, see that's the thing, mole miner missiles already do 80% of my health in one hit.  So missile launchers DO work a they're supposed to.
---
Until they fall into the players hand.
---
That's shitty game balance.
---
Server hopping for train stations when 1 has 0 caps.
---
But yeah it’s seems more stable based on the reduced amount of players or better player segmentation.
---
They are about to nerf TSE dmg so the big trouble will be the OP melee players.  But if you are fast enough, you can kite them around
---
I keep saying Bethesda needs to tap the people in charge of these things over at Frontier. The public relations, patch notes, and road maps they release for Elite Dangerous is a marvel. 
---
Almost every time I take a workshop if I stay there long enough Grahm shows up.  Now it might take 20-30 minutes but he has shown up at most of them.  He even got stuck one night on a rock for almost 2 hours and was in the same spot talking to me the entire night about meat😀
---
Yes please! There is a roadmap on the Star Citizen subreddit that gets released every update to the roadmap, and it’s really easy to read and understand. If a Fallout roadmap was anything like the Star Citizen one this community would really benefit from it 
---
I agree your gear should break or break way faster in survival on death makes resources more necessary 
---
Only thing about making a new character I don’t like is having to find missions to level up. I don’t want to redo the story in order to level back up to where I’m at (175 currently) just to fight with people.   I know duped weapons scares ppl but I’m at a point in the game where I literally don’t have to do any farming for any kind of material or anything so I want to keep my character. He is perfect imo
---
I did notice within the first hour of gameplay. Sort of feels like a chore leveling up compared to before. 
---
BURN THE WITCH 
---
Funny how my post that said the same thing got shredded to negative karma -\_-
---
Ahhh. Gotcha. 
---
Hey the fake upvotes were removed :)
---
Calling that a new mode even is being kind of generous. I didn't read anything that indicates its anything more then an instance with auto-PvP. So still literally no incentive to actually PvP, or enter into the mode at all.
---
Also the names misleading. Just call it Vs, Free-for-all, Raider Roundabout, or whatever. It doesn't add a single feature that is commonly associated with Survival modes.
---
Griefers don't want to PvP someone of their own skill and level. It's in the name. They want to cause grief, not have a perfectly 50-50% chance of winning a fight.
---
When Survival goes in, serious PvPers will go it and will enjoy it. PvE players who don't have the reflexes or drive to fight players will stick around on Adventure and still be killed by players who don't want a fair fight.
---
Survival mode just reduces the chances of asshats getting punished for being asshats to the wrong person.
---
Because no one has ever abused a PVP rewards system before. And no company has ever managed to minimize or prevent abuse of a PVP rewards system before. Your take away from the idea is unfortunately as well thought out as the current PVP rewards.
---
Also, mole miner gauntlet is numerically inferior in every way. Less damage, and 50% more weight than even a death claw gauntlet. 15 and 10 pounds respectively. Good luck out there.
---
You picked a lock. You got wanted. It’s right there on your HUD
---
Cannibal or Good Doggy is good eatin's
---
If this is not an intended effect, I’m fine with them fixing it. 
---
With my weight reduction pieces, I can carry an entire arsenal.   Thats fun.
---
This specific spawn is a triggered event that has a random spawn by walking over the bridge.  I've seen this as well when a camp is in the area it won't allow the the trigger to spawn the event.
---
This is not the same spawn mechanic you refer to.  Regular spawns occur when a player fast travels to or enters an area.  The spawn OP is referring to has a specific trigger that camps in the area prevent from spawning.
---
I'd agree if they actually added anything to their game since launch.
---
First content update for this game is pvp.......that might have far reaching implications.
---
Cafe in Watoga behind the Super Duper Mart always spawns 4-7 Canned Dog Food
---
Ah I see, then it must have been bugging out then. 
---
&gt; And then you ca factor 2-shot, although for shotgun, afaik, Two Shot is actually a bad prefix, as it adds just a one pellet, so it's just maybe 15% increase.
---
Guess thats why I'm not impressed with my TS pump shotgun.
---
Why would you want to pay more for this giant mess. I still want half my money back
---
It's because it works in pve, you can pop a bunch of bobbles and one shot her
---
The point is to try and get people with similar interests together. Even if you buff workshops and hunter/hunted, if 90% of the people on the server don't want to PvP, they are pointless. 
---
I’d say that how quickly you die from slap damage matters *a lot*. It’s basically the difference between giving you a chance to react and choose whether you want to engage in PvP or disengage and avoid. That’s the choice at the core of the upcoming Survival mode.
---
And I think that is why the “I was one shot in pacifist” cry is so emotional: the system that was supposed to protect them from griefers supposedly failed them. It’s been used to make the game look worse, increase support for TSE nerfs, and make it sound like bobble head duper’s are everywhere.
---
I want meaningful improvements to this game but I’m starting to see the alarmism and groupthink in the community here as something that is holding that back.
---
First I would need to get some perks I still dont have by lveling up. Then Id have to move a bunch of S.P.E.C.I.A.L points around by leveling some more. Lastly I would need to (once again) somehow find a set of  impossible to get 3* legendaries. It would Probably take me another 15-20 lvls to get the build the way I wanted it. Maybe more.
---
When you’re wanted you’re flagged for PvP. Anyone can come attack you and do full damage
---
What exactly is the nerf everyone is talking about? I haven't seen anything official, just a load of people mentioning it on here.
---
The place you have to go to get the plans is fairly straightforward and relatively easy to clean out. Mostly level 14 Scorched if I'm remembering correctly and not in mobs. Get the plans and leave. You don't have to build the power armor at that location, so you don't have to carry all your materials down there. You'll just need to go back to register the power armor and get the plans for the stand.
---
If you have proof of this you'll be the first to provide it. Chances are you misclicked or accidentally dropped the items elsewhere and just thought it was from the trade. Doesn't really make sense that someone would steal a vault suit either.
---
It will give you extra carry weight through the form of strength points if your strength is less than 10 ( I think). At a certain point when your strength gets to high, PA won’t give strength additions
---
Also there is calibrated shocks for their armors
---
Also excavator armor provides almost no protection compared to better PA.  So there is a carry weight/damage protection trade off without calibrated shocks mod. 
---
If it’s a bug I hope they fix it soon then. 
---
You don’t know for sure that everyone w/TSE duped, much less how it was obtained.
---
My comment was to support the idea of an all out pvp survival server.
---
Darwin’s law of survival. Not for a overly micromanaged overburdened restrained pvp instance.
---
Have you had a chance to use the skeleton catapult at Johnsohns something (south edge of the map, middle of said edge)?
---
Because not only its so ridiculously fun, there is also a trick that you might learn if you were experimenting with recreating the technology they used. I'm not giving out any details, because you seem to be wanting to discover stuff yourself.
---
I'll just say that once I return home from my delegation, I intend to use this knowledge to break the current world record in F76 Jetpack flight length, and I do believe that its within my reach.
---
If you find the trick yourself before I get home please do not take my world record away ;)
---
I always try to hope for the best.
---
Yes please.
---
I need to know if i should keep putting time into this game or not.
---
See, but after i put away my x-01, i pulled out my BoS t-60, and had no issues. I just don't get it.. Maybe mods that are on our power armor are making it crash? What platform are you on? I'm on ps4.
---
Why do you guys only consider the weapons and perk builds an issue? Even if they nerf weapon legendary effects, the main issue is full sentinal/cavalier assassin armor which makes it to where players take no dmg. How do you fight an unkillable player? Good luck farming for those pieces or trying to buy some from tbe market when those same players hog them all. 
---
Oh they’ve done well with the past couple wolfensteins. And the last doom was pretty good too. 
---
Just please please please I hope it doesn’t end up like Duke Nukem Forever. Total disrespect of one of the 3 godfathers of FPS games. 
---
ah yes where do you get the plans for the power armor stand though? 
---
144hz, 165hz oc nur never tried that 
---
Right.   But one shot from a level 36 seems far fetched.  I have once 300 damage resist in power armor.   What could they be using without some sort of exploit?  
---
I just hope fog crawlers aren't as beastly as the eneraged fog crawler in fallout 4 lol. 
---
On one side. I can understand why they’re weak. They’ll be super OP, and it’s pretty easy to craft mini nukes. On the other side. It’s ridiculous how insanely weak they are. Should take 10 rockets to kill a super mutant.
---
I'm sure they'd retcon the lore to fit
---
It's not a bad game besides if we had mods the modders would've already fixed every QOL suggestion and added new interesting events.
---
This might be better to post in r/fo76filthycasuals
---
A TSE is worth 25000 caps. Ridiculously you say. Nope. After nearly 450 hours gameplay I got only one. And that's the same experience for all friends playing this game. So no one who gotten a TSE legit would so easily let it go for a few caps. Dupers just destroyed the economy of this game along with any excitement of pvp encounter.
---
Battleblock Theater had a better trade system! lol
---
I think this is such a good idea that it will never happen. Cant have nice things.
---
Also, remember to keep in mind that although *can* get the Armor before level 25, you can't actually **use** it till then. So don't be in too much of a rush to get it built asap, instead just try to stockpile everything you need so as soon as you're closer in level you'll be ready to go.
---
I had several characters around lvl 30 for the longest time. I have alt-itis and my character plans change as I find out new things, or discover different play styles. It was only on my fifth character did I exceed lvl 50 and continue to use the most now.
---
It doesn't match any existing frames or walls (that I've seen). Add to that that most doors don't even align correctly inside existing door frames and I'm even less interested in more doors (and who knows if this will ever be fixed?). To make matters worse it's severely limited time. This is not how you earn my hard earned money (speaking only towards this particular item of course). I am well aware that I may not even be the target demographic for this particular item. Nonetheless, that's my honest opinion.
---
It only said aid items. It’s. It ark. Chill
---
Lol okay I will but why
---
Lv 150 yet and still so many things to do.... love this game!!
---
As someone who's completed all of the quests, done every event, has the SBQ on farm lockdown, and visited every location on the map.  You find things to do...  Some days it's scavving for resources (repairs and ammo), some days it's helping a friend build up his bar.  Some days, it's just legendary farming via nukes.
---
I will say I log less hours than I used to... but I still find things to do. 
---
I recommend getting social with others... plug that mic in, start talking.  I stumbled upon a guy when I was level 30ish who was singing along to the radio in the insane asylum.  It was hilarious, and next thing you know, him and I are tearing up the wasteland.  We've met several other people along the way and now have a great group of 8+ depending upon the day.
---
Yeah maybe an option to reset them even. Good idea.
---
I've played a no rules and no safe zones MMO and it was fantastic. There's some initial shock after being ganked by a high level and losing loot but it forced people to group up into player-created factions. We held territories, called for help, ran to help others, raided bases, etc. It was a blast but is definitely not for everyone.
---
That said... this won't work unless they reset characters/items, fix bugs/exploits and give people pacifist only servers. It would also help to keep the cap on level 5 before you can PVP.
---
Most TSE users are not dupers. Most dupers have little fun using TSE. I got my first TSE from a non duper and at the time TSE pumps/handmades sold for 4-5k. Recently the prices of explosive weapons dropped to a couple hundred caps, so anyone can get one.
---
So I really need (at least for now) Demo perk on my stealth rifle char, since they have an explosive pipe rifle.
---
I like my 2 shot fat man too. I kill myself 99% of the time using it.
---
Wouldn’t his station only play butcher Pete? Lol. 
---
Sidequests, dropping excess items at 76, events, when i feel a spark of creativity i work on my camp. i pretty much do everything
---
Nope. Its gone. you probably ate bits of it in the canned food you got.
---
Oh my god this. I have the perfect spot. It’s ruined by the fact some grass is sticking up, and in 1 spot. Part of a branch is going through a wall.
---
No, but latency is a thing.  Wait a few seconds between swapping cards to make sure the effect is on if you're removing 2 star Starched Genes.
---
Why should folks w/TSE or legendary gear only be allowed to use it in specific instances?
---
Or use it when appropriate?
---
In PvP survival mode, when everyone is packing crazy guns and damage, only the ones who know what they’re doing will win lolz
---
I mean OP made it pretty clear “no visitors”
---
Three factions fighting it out on a large map with multiple resources to control? You just described ESO's PvP. Which is alright because that's the best part in that game ha
---
Cross your fingers and hope friend. Cross your fingers and hope. I'd happily spend hours every week talking with people about this if it produced results.
---
Disabled for pvp attacks only, not the pve content you will still have to do.
---
The Blackwater mine quest where you have to kill 'not Evan' I assume is what your on. This can be a tricky one while playing solo.
---
 Just take your time and find the way. It's down the main tunnel, first left, then a right. Keep distance from the mole miners using something heavy duty like a shotgun and plenty explosives. They will be coming in a tunnel so frags should work great.
---
 Once you're through the tunnel it's up the staircase to the back room where you'll see a scorched. He may dead already and if so, then all that work was in vain as someone got to him first.
---
 Best thing is to have a bit of back up. If you're on xbox I'm happy to assist.
---
 Hope this helps.
---
I'm getting 15 fps with lowest settings possible though
---
Yep. I picked up a scorched receiver for my sniper rifle and even with the additional 50% damage against scorched, it's still lower than the base damage of a hardened receiver.
---
Agreed 
---
There’s no battling them, there’s certain things I can’t be forgiven or. Namely leaving the hospice before my mom died because I just ....I guess I thought if I left it wasn’t happening.
---
And Yass queen is sonething I saw on a coffee mug, jeesh 
---
I agree TSE should be worth 20k minimum and it sucks dupers ruined it.
---
See I do all of these things. I guess it just doesn’t feel like a grind as much as I want it to be. Like sometimes I would like to hit event after event but then I’ll only see like 1 event on the map
---
Nope. It already got turned into stew.
---
Just make sure to eat slow, and savor that stew a little bit more.
---
As much as I hate server hopping, you can do it to refresh the whitesprings vendor to get x-01 calibrated shocked.  Put one of those in each leg and you'll get +100 carry weight in your X-01.
---
The same thing can be done with watoga vendors for the other armor sets.  Just check both plans and mods, as sometimes you can find the plans to craft them.
---
Also, power armor will increase your STR to 10 if it is lower, giving you more carry weight.  I have 4 STR and I get +6 for any power armor.
---
Any roadmap is subject to a return on their investment: see GTA:O vs Mass Effect: Andromeda.
---
Oh yeah I deff agree, although I wouldn’t expect this post to bring in hate which is why I didn’t post it on there. It’s really just a honest question
---
Its possible without perks.
---
My riflemen only runs travelling pharmacy with 3 str. 
---
Ppl just like to pack around 3-4x what they need just in case when that scenario never arises.
---
Yeah, but I don't have $$$
---
I accepted. One of the best ways to level up is to kill everything you can. I use a melee weapon to conserve ammo but it also caused me to have a surplus of bullets as well.
---
It's just another forum but it is for casual players rather than the intensive, xp hoarding, pvp players. Only real difference.
---
 Og and filthy casuals dont tolerate any whining, they play for fun. 
---
We're going to Nerf the entire game if that's our only solution to dupers.....
---
Submitted a ticket, will/can Beth do anything about this?
---
It’s inconvenient for us, but if everyone has a stash of dat mans andbnisske launches , How long do you think any player made structure is gonna stay up 
---
Happens all the time in the nuke zone to me. I always keep it on cause I just wanna play for fun not VS. But I run into the problem that if a team member starts shit I'm stuck getting slaughtered endlessly even after the team mate is killed and PvP is over. I'm 111 in maxed X-01 getting one shotted, doesn't make much sense if the DMG is that messed up. How's that make PvP any fun?
---
I do think weapon balance is garbage but you're a liar about being one shot in pacifist mode.
---
Server hop! Hit all the events on one server. Hop to the next. Rinse and repeat! 
---
You also have to understand that yes this is a Fallout game, but it is meant to be different from the others, alot of people are disappointed, but it's fact, they intend for us to interact with other players, whether aggressively or friendly. I just want people to stop taking their perfect pve standards and applying it to something that is obviously supposed to be pvp all the time (survival mode). Pvp servers and pve servers seperate would have prevented all of this dispute amongst the community.
---
This gives me an idea. I should put on the clown suit and faschnacht mask, equip a chameleon armor piece, and crouch in front of the Overseer's chest in the first campsite. I hope somebody has their mic on.
---
Well, I appreciate the effort to comment, but that's literally what I describe above. The symptom is that many weapons are never seen or used in any tangible way other than "another f***in poll cue". This follows a discussion of weapons need to be more in line with each other for usefulness, because a crazed survivor with a tire iron can be more fun to play than one with a super sledge in a crowd of guys with a super sledge.
---
If you're gonna call someone lazy, make sure you read the whole thing next time. Sincerely, have a nice day 😁
---
Also the BoS did not name him liberty prime, that is what Mr. House named him after his company Robco. built him to fight the Chinese military in Anchorage Alaska. A side note is that he never got the chance to fight them because the Americans drove the Chinese out before he was fully operational. 
---
A teammate starting something is completely unrelated to bobblehead stacking, team pvp is wonky.
---
That or they are rewarding them by driving up demand for their ebay auctions
---
You're being willfully dense and missing the point. We don't need to split hairs. The proof was presented to you so accept it.
---
You get it as a reward for registering the Excavator power armor. You can use the stands that are all over the map. There's several in the Arkos plant. You just need to have the supplies in your Stash, and any plant/station will use materials in your stash I believe (someone correct me if I'm wrong; I haven't started building my excavator set yet). 
---
I remember when diablo 3 for the xbox 360 allowed your game save to move to the xbox one.... it ruined it forever. It feels that if they allow normal mode characters to transfer over most high level people will have a super high advantage in the first few months because of the gear they already found (or bought)
---
As for dropping stuff on death. In my opinion you should only drop stuff that is not currently equipped.  So you will have to be wary of what you bring. So you plan on going on an adventure into a nuke zone so you better leave all your armor at your camp and only bring your power armor and a single weapon incase someone shoots you and takes all your non equiped gear. If they up the rates which legendarys are found (by a lot) I could understand losing all your gear because you wouldnt have to spend months finding more. I would hate for a level 20 person to 1 shot me with a sniper and take all my hard earned weapons and just leave the game so I couldnt get them back.
---
Base raiding sounds like a good idea. I had a thought earlyer. The bounty feature needs a bit of a rework. So killing players wouldnt get anyone a bounty but breaking items or lockpicking a camp would still bet you a bounty. Because as soon as you have a bounty no matter how small people will come kill you. And considering that they will be normalizing the damage for weapons and equipment it would be better off than a level 5 killing a level 100 and gaining a lot of caps whereas the level 100 gets pocket change for killing the level 5. 
---
Maybe a percent health damage based on the size?
---
Weapons in general in this game should be heavily rebalanced. 
---
Agree with this. It's an adventure and everyday will be different but people make the game. Interact, help and share. Build relationships and communities.  That's the main goal in the story anyway, to rebuild from the ashes(of nuked SBQs)
---
It wasn’t intentional. You can still level houses within seconds with plenty of weapons. That’s not the reason they made them weigh 40 pounds. They’re the ones that made houses easily destroyable in the first place remember.
---
Liberty Prime is the Fallout Spruce Goose. "IT'S CALLED LIBERTY PRIME! AND IT WILL FLY, GODDAMN IT"
---
It might be shocking but some people just want to be settlers/explorers in the apocalypse and have no interest in killing off their fellow vault dwellers. 
---
Is it all bobbleheads or just DMG output you can stack? There were 3 of us over 100 and couldn't put a scratch on this person
---
Try going to the GeForce Experience app and check if your drivers are up to date, recent drivers have caused some issues with some games. Also a recent windows update had some issues with .NET framework. These could all be candidates to the problem.
---
If you want your laptop to dedicate more resources to the game, open the task manager, go to "Details" and find "Fallout 76.exe", right click it and go to "set priority" and give it a higher priority. Don't go over high though, as it tends to cause problems with the system.
---
Welcome to the club.
---
I have had the game since November, when a friend got it for me knowing i like the previous games. I didnt play it straight away as i had recently purchased Battlefield &amp; Fifa. Started playing more recently, and am hooked. However, i am only level 16 :P So it is possible to have not got all the way to high level yet :)
---
I cant imagine it happening but the world is a crazy place lately so who knows.
---
This is why I always bring extra key cards between me or my party someone sometimes fat fingers the key entry.
---
Both, I think. As I said I tried once in the BETA, but it didn't work, the other guy had no clue either. Same session, a second time after a minute or so the interface was just gone, but the other guy was still standing there. So either we did something wrong or he left the trade.
---
Haven't tried since and don't really want to. Have no friends in the game, so O don't just walk up to anyone and ask him to be patient until I have figured it out.
---
But if I don't know or want or both, my point is: OP's problem won't change unless Bethesda makes an interface for it, or creates a hub or whatever. This feels like the old trade system from Fallout 1 and 2.
---
Its always the same:
---
PVE shooter. Then push players to PVP late game, so we dont have to make content.
---
And it always fails. Or mostly fails.
---
Warframe tried it, with embarrassingly but predictably awful results.
---
Both Destiny games tried it. Very low population pvo there, too.
---
Firefall tried it and that game died years ago.
---
Rage tried it, and no one cared.
---
Doom tried it, and it bombed.
---
PVP players are (justifiably) demanding and discerning conasieurs of quality, skill based play. Bethesda and their antiquated tech are years, if not decades, behind the quality curve for PVP shooters in 2019. They shouldn't even bother trying.
---
That was due to assassin/sentinel armor with fireproof and dense
---
No they won’t do anything. its been an issue since release, they made a comment about being careful when depositing the ingredients  
---
Nope and nope.
---
&gt;\- How does armor even work?!?
---
Magnets
---
All perk cards stack as long as the title of it is different, you can’t stack 3 Slugger rank 1 cards, but you can stack Slugger, Expert Slugger, and Master Slugger rank 1 cards. 
---
Awesome! I am totally going to steal this!
---
I knew there would be a duping accusation before I even scrolled down lmao. It's sad really.
---
Ammo isn’t that scare, I had 50 rounds at one point while working through cranberry bog, scorch we’re dropping like 5-10 rounds at a time if it popped.
---
It's not about the junk or even the caps. If it was just straight PvP that would be cool. Or if they shot me and I didn't shoot back and they simply wandered off to find someone who was interested in PvP that would be cool as well. But that's not what fuckin' happens.  They either follow you around like an annoying little gnat trying to goad you into PvP or they run off and start kiting in strings of enemies to attack you.  Or what if the encounter happens when you're at your camp?  You don't fire back and everything get trashed anyway. Griefers prey upon the weak or easy targets, plain and simple. Since I've stopped accepting random trades, my level of grief has practically become non-existent.  Yes, I know how easy it is to block someone or change servers. yes I know how easy it is to rebuild my camp if it gets trashed.  But why bother with all that if simply not accepting random trades stopped the problem for me?
---
I don’t know if you guys are from the era where some FPS games where you can pick all players just use missile launchers or explosive weapons only set ups but after a while it gets boring as hell if nukes and missiles where devestatingly strong pvp would be boring pvm would be boring and in general the game would just be boring everyone would be looking for the mini nuke 2 shot explosive round instigating weapon and everyone would probably only have that everyone would have the same character build and it would just out right suck 
---
Yup. Only way it should be.
---
The games not bad but I would never fucking repurchase and don’t put that in their fucking head.
---
There's far too much there to be coherent without a table of contents and 15 pages. However, you didn't read it as far as you said you did. I discussed how many weapons we're strictly inferior, and made a list of weapons that "could" be removed from the game, with no effect. Late game, they're a novelty. Which is exactly what you described. 3/4 or more of the games weapons are novelty.
---
It took me a while to get a routine that works but you'll have more ammo than you can use, even without ammosmith and super duper, if you tag steel/lead/gp/cloth/acid.
---
Why you being downvoted the fuck? Ive thrown away 5k stacks of ammo before cause its just weighing me down.
---
You can't just demand someone leave a server - it is for all players, not just one.
---
Alot of sidequests it seems to me has a very low trigger radius but yeah server hopping is most effective for events
---
Weird I'm on Xbox.....
---
You made your points, and I refuted them. You think you're right, and I don't. You deleted your original post, and I didn't.
---
I'm not terribly worried about who comes off as more rational and likely to affect the outcome of this new mode. Enjoy your new character or not playing survival.
---
Players providing feedback on a planned game mode is just as valid as feedback after it comes out. If something is explained well enough, anyone with any degree of reasoning will be able to infer things about it.
---
I believe you're either simply a contrarian, too far removed, or a cheater yourself if you think not requiring character wipe for PvP in this game is wise. They'll lever fully purge the duped and glitched items and characters.
---
Just seems like it bugged out then. Sometimes happens. They are usually ok for me but not always. 
---
I was! Done that one a few times, but this time I was being attacked while depositing, and got nudged to the right, which is what seems to have triggered it..
---
Diablo 3 style. Every death it breaks 10%
---
You could bump that up to 30% and it would fit in well with this gamemode.
---
I agree entirely. The filthy casuals are much more likely to type up a novel about some amazing experience they stumbled upon by exploring a random area.
---
As an answer to your question, when I'm lost as far as what to do, I'll often times following a river or stream to see where it leads. Or go upstream to see where it begins. And often times along those walks an icon will appear on my compass and I'll detour to that and I've found plenty of neat little things and random enemies.
---
Found this destroyed house with a guitar sword next to a chair. The house was boarded up but you could get in through the crawlspace and there were skeletons and a sickle and shot written on the walls and upstairs there were skulls in a hot tub lmao. Got some funny and cool pics to see on my load screen out of it :)
---
I explore while trying to complete Challenges for Atoms
---
Many noobs and lowbies cry pacifist thinking it’s a shield instead of a hindrance.
---
I want the idea of a dedicated PvP survival mode to happen because
---
1) it establishes a safe environment for pve pacifists and noobs for safe gameplay
---
2) I bet all these flybynight fancy pants folks with TSE will quickly get Skooled by folks who know what they’re doing, and how their toon interacts.
---
I see these anti griefer gangs quickly going pvp, and quitting to go back lolz
---
Curious though how Bethesda will manage survival mode if Bobbleheads stacking and TSE gets fully optimized.
---
I was playing last weekend and fast traveled to one of the events. I didn't realize it at first, but it was one of those "defend the workshop events" but the workshop was claimed by another player. I just wanted to play the event and get some XP/loot.
---
Anyhow, with the gun I had at the time I start shooting wildly at the scortched that are approaching the area. I missed a few shots and must have hit one of the workshop structures and became wanted. At first I didn't realize it at all, I was like I am wanted for shooting the scortched? WTF?. But then I realized the workshop was owned and that's I must have damaged it somehow.
---
I really think the whole "wanted" system, although not broken, is really just too simplistic. I get the pacifist mode, but the game should just work. It should know I am defending the workshop from the event. It shouldn't punish me for effectively helping another player.
---
This game doesn't really feel like a mmo, but they are selling it that way? It's more like a Fallout multiplayer-story with deathmatch being optional. It's like Fallout 76 doesn't know what it wants to be, and the things it tries to be it does poorly to mediocre.
---
If BGS is adding BR to FO76 instead of addressing the core issues, I think I am just not going to play anymore. #notmyfallout
---
Ok that explains why there are basically gods running around
---
And show me what discerning pvp player is going to take a break from games like Overwatch or Fortnite to pvp on this outdated, stuttering tech.
---
Bethesda is fast becoming a has-been, and design by numbers on this antique engine isnt going to help them.
---
My frag grenades do more damage than my bunker buster.
---
Though my Instigating Fatman is pretty nice.
---
We'll see.
---
RemindMe! One Year
---
Definitely something, if the guy with the God roll gun keeps it forever even though he clears your inv out when he kills you, there's gotta be some downside when he dies
---
Nothing same old dog shit
---
I didn't say all, I said a majority. I stand by that statement 100%, if you don't agree, you aren't paying attention.
---
Its not Darwin's law of survival. Its not survival of the fittest. Its survival of whomever payed the most to win. You are suggesting that Pay to Win is fine if you choose to ignore the extreme duping that was done and how it will effect full PVP.
---
If you have a group of 30 and want to pvp- why are you not  participating hunter vs hunters events?
---

---
I’m just throwing ideas out there as to why objects are needlessly heavy and storage minuscule. There’s not a lot of logic to begin with and hence not much of a foundation for me to build some solid theories on 
---
Because fortnight sales. It's why we have that slapped on pvp mess in the first place.
---
What do you mean by reset? 
---
**-Dont complain about the damage unless you got Demo Exp, Stabilized, Adrenaline Reaction, Chems and a good legendary roll.**
---
So...to be clear, you're a drugged-out, well-trained mutant with a magic gun .. And you're only doing OKAY damage.
---
And you think that's not something worth complaining about?
---
That's actually the major point of contention I have with the balance in this game.  From damage out-put to survivability to inventory management, you start out woefully incapable and have to specialize to be OKAY at ONE of those things.  
---
If I want to play a total loser who is terrified of a hostile world that he is totally incapable of handling, I have real life for that, thanks.
---
Early on in this game I’d hunt for bounties and find thousands of pounds of junk in people’s bags. It was annoying as hell to be honest.
---
These days people are getting better and it’s only hundreds ;)
---
Thank you for the tutorial, but the UI is so terrible that until it's changed, I'm most likely to just paper bag some ammo and transfer what I want to give to someone. 
---
6lbs to be precise. I picked one up last night (Daisycutter) and decided to try it out on a level 91 glowing deathclaw. I figured it’d be a slam dunk, but the only thing getting slammed was me by the nearly impervious GDC. What a waste of carry space. 
---
Any guy who post the new limited time stuff from the atomic shop you know
---
That’s exactly it, there’s no logic to it, it’s just something they never through tall the way through 
---
I know how to trade and hate how it works so anytime I get a trade request I ask if they're on a mic. 
---
If they say yes, I ask what they're looking for. If it's weapons or armor, I always have to say no because everything I have is level 45 or 50 and the players who initiate the trade are always much lower. If they ask for anything healing I give it away by the fistfuls by dropping it for them in a paper bag and telling them it's a gift. 
---
If they don't respond because they're not on a mic, I ignore the request and just keep doing my thing.
---
The current trade system is too annoying to deal with.
---
I've found 20 Two shot, 15 explosive, and 9 TSE weapons, just farming white springs.  I gave away or brown bagged most of them.
---
Granted, when you see everyone with an identical gun, you know it's probably been duped.  I crafted and scrapped a bunch of levers to get all the mods while leveling up, so a lot of friends bring me their guns to mod out.  I've seen the exact same gun 12 times now... TSE lever, +1 per, long barrel and the stock with the bullets on the side, with a base receiver (I put hardened on for them).  They traded for them, so I'm assuming they all came from duped items.
---
Comes out to -40% damage from players, -75% damage when standing still, -99% ish damage taken from explosives (not counting perks, DR, or mutations)
---
I want to see everything except equiped weapons and armor dropped. So all ammo, food, drinks, cems and everytignelse just dropped. It would make you consider what to leave at your camp and what to bring.
---
Just make things cheaper to make (like 3 times as much ammo crafted) and repair.
---
Also make equiped items get damaged a fair bit on death similar to diablo 3.
---
You sound weak. Fast travel away. Block him. Go to a different server. Seriously. Wow. You’re exaggerating the level of vitriol that people have if you turn down a trade request. 
---
so hypotheticly you could do +90% two haded melee damage?
---
Economies work using a common currency. 
---
This is true, I will give the BoS credit for getting Liberty Prime working two hundred years after he was first built. It shows that some people became a lot smarter than the original creators of the robot. 
---
I see that you only read two sentences out of my entire original post, and ignored the fact that I said new content may not help the OP's decision. His/her mind is already made up. 
---
Lol, try the whitesprings sometime.  Every can throughout the resort can be searched.  I have so much coffee and cajun beans.....
---
Herbivore.
---
Soup and Melons restore Hunger AND Thirst. I have a huge Melon farm and i collect like 20-30 when logging in and bind it to 1 hotkey and thirst/hunger is a non issue.
---
Yes - all extractable resource "pits" have associated extractors BUT they will only appear in your build menu if you're current build area contains the resource pit. In other words you'll only see the Aluminum extractor available *when you can actually use it*.
---
It's simply another little system that the game expects you to know about without it being told, described or making any sense.  ;\^)
---
Cool idea but I think it should reversed. I feel like being hit straight on is gonna hurt that Mr gutsy more than that scorchbeast. But I see your point
---
  I personally love the spear, I've named mine "Doug". He and I have had a great time adventuring across the wasteland. In retrospect, my character may not be all that stable.....
---
This was a great post, some good observations and suggestions.
---
see answer below
---
That's fair, but at least now you know!
---
Around Charleston for me, at the power plant and red bridge near the station!
---
oh cool! good to know, thanks a ton man
---
i am level 15 (mostly due to not having enough time to play as much i want).  but i really appreciate the feedback and perspective this forum gives.  you guys/girls are providing a useful service that will (i think) ultimately make the game better.  so thank you.
---
Can't wait to read the full patch notes. The aid perk not reducing all aid is also a welcoming change.
---
He wants to redue his build without creating a new character which I don’t think will ever happen
---
No offense to you guys but its not the duped weapons. I know this isn't going to be a popular opinion on this subbreddit, but if you think that making everyone start fresh will close the gap between players who play this more serious and casual players you have to be living in a fantasy world. Sure it will close the gap a tiny bit for a small period, but you don't even need duped boneheads to kill fast and its a fast minority of players that have that in fact its really only used to troll kill the queen and by dickheads who get hard griefing people at whitesprings (even then you can't kill thru the grief shield), I have many 100 level friends and they don't have any... as for TSE you don't even need those to kill people fast, most are just overkill. The players who put in more hours are just better than you, its a simple fact... when you practice at something more you get better at it than people practice less. Even then what happens in a couple months when someone gets the game, they are gonna be out matched by all the players already playing? It does not solve the issue at all, its the same problem still there, the players who are better can prey on the less competent players. Demonise me all you want for stating facts, its literally like you expect a bunch of 12 year olds to show up to a professional sports match and beat the team. Call it elitist, but its true.
---
Literally all you are going to accomplish is this: a buffer of maybe a week or two where everyone is on even footing but then the players that put in more hours will surge ahead have better builds better gear, even if its not godlike gear for the first month or two. Not only that but it shows so little consideration for players who've farmed whitesprings and the other main hotspots for hundreds of hours, because we are sick of farming we put in our work to get our weapons the last thing we want to do is do that again. You say that if you like the game we won't mind doing it all again? People have different views on what is enjoyable, for us we like becoming super powerful collecting the best gear, how do you do that most effectively in this game? Farm hotsopts over and over again that's the only way you have any reasonable chance of getting a good drop in this system. There is a reason you guys don't do that its boring... but we do it because we see the end goal and want it.You guys act like it takes no effort to get TSE weapons if its so easy why don't all you guys have them? I paid AT LEAST 10k caps for each of my TSE selling off goods to vendors everyday for my 1400caps for each of my TSE weapons, even found one myself which I traded for a weapon that suited my playstyle more. Honestly if you don't want to deal with us ,stay on your PVE server , don't take workshops stay in pacifist, its so easy... 
---
Not only that but TSE weapons have many counters, such as the new flame proof perk, dense mods but instead of doing some research and learning about the game taking some accountability for your situation you complain to bethesda : its too hard!!! People are one shotting me. Yeah that's because you didn't do anything about it... None of you will believe me but its entirely possible to survive multiple shots from TSE quite comfortably with the counters.
---
Don't get me wrong its not perfectly balanced by any means, but everything in this game as a counter that I've seen. Not only that but these godly weapons you are complaing about are being nerfed and you are still complaining about them and you are still going to be one shotted... just by other methods, literally all you are doing is annoying the non casual player base. If you don't care fine - but I'd like to make you aware. 
---
Bethesda literally made this PVP server mode, to separate the casual players from the non casual (competitive VS non competitive) and you are trying to ruin that... it blows my mind!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Amen 
---
This. Haven't played in weeks. Popped on last night, only to find......literally nothing has changed. And the worst part is, I knew that would be the case! And I got on anyway! And was still disappointed!
---
What's wrong with me?
---
He is everywhere, yet nowhere..... at the same time.
---
So its be fine if someone grinded for hundreds of hours and got these items to be invincible? Would that be fair because they put in the time?
---
You obvioisly wouldn't be the ideal customer. This would appeal more to those of us who enjoyed mods and having multiple camps I personally have spent hours customizing multiple camps and enjoyed having my work saved and being able to revisit it instead of having to rebuild everytime I want to make something new. We wouldn't have such limited build space. And no more 600 pound stash boxes. BTW Look for my character on next weeks eposode of hoarders.
---
&gt; **(UPDATED) Changes to the Two-Shot and Explosive Legendary Mods**:  The Two-Shot and Explosive Legendary Mods will be undergoing a few  balance changes in this next patch. We know that there has been some  frustration over how powerful these mods are, particularly when combined  and used in player vs. player combat. With Patch 5, the damage bonus  for Two Shot Legendary modded weapons has been reduced from +100% to  +25% damage ~~and the Two Shot legendary mod can no longer be looted in the world~~.  The Explosive Legendary mod has a reduced damage bonus, now adding +20%  of the base weapon damage with explosive radius damage instead of  +100%. **Note:** This was a misunderstanding in what was being addressed with these mods. **They will still be available in the world but are just undergoing some balance changes.** Thank you for your feedback, and we look forward to hearing your thoughts on the changes.

I spent about 20 minutes in the Galleria yesterday scavenging and I wanted to cut my ears off.  There should be a quest to turn that music off permanently.
---
No 60%
---
I admit I'm a real griefer. I saw a level 18 and knifed him, then he knifed me back, then i one shotted him and then ate his body. burp
---
No that’s good steel for the endgame is super important and aluminum is easy to scavenge 
---
I agree. This isn't the type of game where you can just grab everything you want and lug it around *just in case you need it*. You need to know what you plan on doing and carry only what you will require to accomplish that task. Everything else can either be left alone, traded, or broken down. The weight reduction perks are only there for those who feel a need to spec into being able to carry a large amount of whatever they want. 
---
Plastic, always in short supply of it for my double barrel and pump shotgun. Seems like the only scrap items missing on my list are plastic and springs. 
---
What is TSE?
---
I also want holotape1s (also notes too) to have some kind of indicator which is new, so I can find them without trial and error.
---
All the rank 1 of increase damage cards are 10%, ranks above 1 are only 5%, with a max of rank 3. So 60% increase would be the max obtainable via perk card ranks. 
---
Prototypes are a thing, as well as corporate espionage. Perhaps the enclave wanted a personal Liberty Prime?
---
Not sure if thats English
---
Well thought out and even better said.
---
This guy gets it. Bethesda, please listen to level headed folks like this rather than the reactionaries. We want to love this game, but you're making it really tough.
---
You can use most of the environment within your camp radius in some way. 
---
Power Connectors can attach to trees and rocks, and you can even place your camp box/objects in trees, provided it turns green. 
---
My Fusion Generator was suspended above my camp by a giant branch for a while. 
---
There's also a minimum and maximum elevation for building within your camp radius. I place my camp box as high as I can without placing dirt "outside the build area" so that I can build very tall structures. 
---
I'm level 54, I've already dropped the nuke twice. There is not much else to do except keep dropping the nuke over and over kind of boring.
---
Basically the only way to pvp is to get fire proof and a set of Cavaliers/sentinel Assassins armor 
---
There's a patriotic combat armor set

I would never do this if I were them.  If their plans change, people will get pissed off.
---
Actually, let's back up a second.  No matter what these people do, people are going to get upset over it.
---
The problem isn't Bethesda or Blizzard or even fucking EA.  It's unrealistic expectations by the communities punctuated by tantrums by grown ass people because they have a small problem with their toys.
---
Video games are supposed to be fun.  Nobody is going to default on a mortgage or cause massive layoffs due to X feature not being implemented in Fallout76.  It's not an investment.  It's how you choose to spend your leisure time.
---
It becomes moot later on because you can just buy the lower level duplicates you need. Levels become sorta pointless late-game because your build is already finished and refined. So basically, they probably won't implement that because people hit their perfect build too early already. Instead them being permanently fused actually makes it a tougher choice to fuse them in the first place. Gotta think about whether you really want it upgraded or if you're just doing so to fill out your unfinished Build.
---
Why are people downvoting this comment? Seems like a reasonable roadmap. Maybe a little exaggerated, but sheesh, you don't deserve this!
---
Doubly agreed. I have gotten to really enjoy killing people who think their TSE weapon is all they need to win in PvP. That goal honestly took over my character for weeks now but is changing into practicing PvP in general now that the TS and E nerfs are coming along with Survival Mode.
---
I think it may just be time for a break from this sub.
---
This would be great for tents too. It's kinda odd you have to place a foundation to use a tent
---
If they dont import inventory and gear would you still bring your perk cards and level to PVP server?
---
Break them apart from the individual stacks.
---
That's the saddest Protectron. 
---
You can pick up a Flight Helmet in cranberry bog at the ranger station. The room with the cages, it can spawn on the top shelf.
---
What is caps? You dumb?
---
Outer worlds, metro, tropico 6, battle fleet gothic 2 and still have to pick up x4 foundation.....yup 76 in its current state really cant justify play time now or in the forseable future

Basic Rule: **When in doubt, boil it out!**  
---
Baskaa's Corollary: **When in shit, get rid of it!**
---
I got to level 86 and sadly thats when I began to experience the same thing. 
---
I'm not at end-game yet, but part of why I am trying to deliberately take it slow is I know the current payout mechanic of RNG or bust is not great.
---
I have played other MMOs and while it is still a grind, collecting alternative/specialized currency for special reward payout *feels* much more manageable. I'll play the PvP capture-the-flag game 8,000 times for that shoulder pad I need, I'll collect 2,500 ears to turn in for the ability to buy that factional mount I've been eyeing, and I'm willing to go to the same boring dungeon 150 times to get the set I want while my friends pick up pieces of their set in 75% of those....but non-transparent, unending, RNG *is* frustrating and I 100% agree that something should be done about it.
---
Faction- or gameplay-specific currency and meaningful in-game achievements (that reward titles, unique items, etc., not exclusively atoms) would be great!
---
Also yes @ melee weapons. :C I like running around with my Revolutionary sword at level 27 and I likely won't be focused on min/maxing at 50+, but it would be nice if there was more balance across them so they could be more viable since the aesthetics are so fun.
---
I do think a bit more perks/mods should be put into the game to really allow for some specialization in roles....this game is never going to be a typical/classic MMO-type with a true tank and true healer, but a mod or two and some additional perk cards could make those specializations more viable. While maybe not required, they could enhance/make the hardest fights in game a little easier. Would encourage people to try more things. :)
---
Roadmap leads to the toilet.  Their release was Gawd Aweful.  Their updates, in typical Bethesda fashion, lead to more problems then fixes, everything they do to try and raise revenue blows up in their face (canvas bag, Nuka Dark) and when they do announce additional content everyone loses their shyt cuz it’s not what they wanted or isn’t detailed enough.
---
I have been playing this game since BETA, just reached lvl 100 and have throughly enjoyed almost every minute of it.  But the press, the devs decisions and the fanbase have destroyed any hope of it becoming anything more then what it already is.
---
Oh god, right? I actively avoid even looking at these piles because I imagine my character is having to dig through them just to pull up the menu showing items within it. 
---
I just want to fight more hard stuff besides the queen. So I’d be down 
---
I want your machete to be as mechanically compelling as it is thematically. Super cool weapon!
---
True - the RNG is not fair.  But limiting trading prevents people from putting together a combined lucky roll of multiple people's RNGs by buying items off them.  Limited trading leads to a fairer playing field, but the RNG is still not fair.
---
i havent found any tse myself but i was given a tse combat shotgun from my friend..600 damage with some shotgun perks..only trouble is i keep killing myself with it..si dont use it too much. i might give ark a try..never played that
---
I've definitely seen it with other mobs. I try to pick up at least the glowing blood from glowing ferals at Whitesprings, but sometimes people beat me to it. I've seen it disappear from the list. Also, it's not uncommon to find piles from glowing radroaches with glowing meat still there that I'm able to take, even thought I certainly did not kill it.
---
Thanks for the info. Don't know how i feel on this, as i have a few TSE weapons that i traded in game for 1000's of caps. I suppose it will stop all the griefers... if they sort out the bobblehead bs that is happening.
---
Not true.   The game just chased away the pvo crowd by making PvP difficult to engage in.  I'm not saying most don't prefer pve but saying that the current base cares only about pve is a result of the PvP being hard to even do (as a level 6 can just walk away after you mini nuke him for example)
---
I guess what I'm saying is this isn't evidence of people not wanting to PvP, but evidence of the people that do having left.  Only exploiters can kill you without your consent in this game.  It does not let us legitimately PvP and finding that one guy who does consent ends up making him your friend and defeats the whole purpose lol
---
No they didn't.
---
They announced the pvp mode in dec.
---
Youtubers announced glitching into the vaults.
---
Bethesda hasn't said a peep about them
---
They seem to have made it a policy that they don't or can't restore lost items.
---
I've avoided that event like the plague, not even once. People post almost daily about losing their stuff.
---
i have an auto nade launcher and 100% from demo exp - meanwhile rocking level 1 gladiator/exp/master lvl3 incisor and my ski sword can almost one shot charred ghouls, but take 4 shots from the nade launcher. I mean come on guys this is idiotic.  +30% damage to melee and i am doing 300-400 damage, but nades do like 1/3 of that.... WITH 5 in demo exp!?!
---
Go to the Fallout Twitter account they posted a link to it it's in the latest edition of the inside the Vault newsletter.
---
This would've been relevant at launch 
---
When I got mine I was lucky enough that a SB was attacking it already.  Still took a while even with that.  Aim for the engines.
---
THANK YOU!! I thought I was just missing something! I stumbled on a workshop and made blueprints for the junk extractor because I couldn’t find plan. This makes sense now lol thanks!! 
---
Last time I looked yesterday the limited 1 day item was a f@#king door
---
Seriously when are they going to put anything remotely interesting or useful, y know things people will actually want to spend their atoms on 
---
Inside the vault, Google it
---
Sadly, this is what I predict as well. Just got in for the first time in a couple weeks. Realized there's literally nothing to do that I haven't done already. Still!
---
Then, realized my two-shot Tesla Rifle literally disappeared since I logged off last time, for literally no reason. 
---
"Why the fuck do I still play this game?!?!"
---
I would love to know because there is nothing left for me to do. I'm not grinding the same crap over and over again to get gear that will let me kill things I can already kill. I would like to get my 96GB of disk space back if they aren't planning on adding anything.
---
&gt; “We’re also building an incredible list of future updates that we can’t wait to share,” says the studio; “including new quests, weekly in-game events, new Vaults opening, a new PvP mode, Player Vending and much more”.
---
That's all so vague. It could be hour and hours of fun or totally not worth the effort. Let's get some specifics. They don't even need to be promises, just give us a better idea of what is to come.
---
I need to be able to name or flag my items.  When i've cleared an area and got like 20 rifles and am salvaging, my little radium rifle (no star, crafted) blends in, and i always get cold sweats when i start to salvage. i'm waiting for the night that i end up salvaging my RR or tactical gauss.
---
No and it's very frustrating. I lost 2k 10mm rounds to that damn hopper once. Bricks were angrily shat.
---
Only thing that bothers me about crafting all that ammo is what am I using it for? Another run through whitespring or downing the scorchbeast queen for the 1000th time? 
---
I use corn soup, easy to grow lots of corn. Satisfies food and hunger, plus AP Regen.......
---
Probably just used to clear mobs or spawns of queen, while single target weapons do more damage to queen.  Makes sense since queen is radioactive ☢️.  
---
Nope 
---
Which is funny imo because the terminal entry's say how it has to be more durable that's why the design was made with black titanium and an ultracite reactor.
---
Sorry, you know of any guy who post atomic sho items all the times Bethesda updated the Atomic shop, my mr.
---
Wasn't anything blessed when I played, just white robed scoudrels in the Britannia graveyard, and teleports to death islands where you were murdered and looted.  I 'spose the crossroads deserve a shoutout as the murde forest.
---
If we had a chat window you could teach them and communicate without a mic , crazy idea I know 
---
We also need a bigger boat ;D 
---
Actually bigger budget for C.A.M.P would be nice. I wont like much to build my C.A.M.P, but when I get inspider. I hit wall called budget.
---
I actually think Rose's station is adorable with the silly elevator music being interrupted every now and then by a drug-fueled rant. 
---
That said, it would be nice to have some kinda smooth-talking Protectron or even a grumpy Gutsy or sassy Assaultron hosting some other stations. 
---
You don't know what we will have. This game is ever evolving. Who knows in a years time the game could have way more pve content.
---
Yes they did. Ill see if I can find a link one min..
---
Shit of stuff!!!!
---
Or at least sort the tapes pertinent to my active quests to the top!
---
I want to be able to scrap duplicates to learn mods.
---
Thats true there will be some left in adventure mode, but do you think there will be less at all when youre adding another server called survival with increased rewards for pvp. As I recall pvp has to be initiated by both parties in adventure mode. Just dont shoot random people? Unless its a bobblehead chugging grief king then theres really nothing you can do. 
---
It's also good for larger groups and it likes taking out limbs.
---
It's an interesting and fun mechanic, but the damage changes by an order of magnitude if I remember correctly. It could drop from top tier by about 20% and it'd be cool. But as it stands right now, you can't even tell that your weapon dropped into useless number until a yao gui is eating your face.
---
Hell probably going to grab the switch re-re release of phonix wright and play it over 76 at this point.
---
Except for baseball bats... i love mine.
---
3pounds... does almost 150 damage with zero stars, just got to slap on a puncturing Searing rocket mod.
---
Sorry, I've never heard of that before so I couldn't have googled it 
---
Thanks, you on Xbox ps4 or pc? When it's done I can do a camp warming party lol
---
Thank you! 
---
My stash went to 640 the other night.  I was confused how looking for inert flux or something but nope.  
---
No idea.  So I dropped all my 2-3 star legendary armor sets I've been collecting to sell as there is no point.  Sad to see them go but last thing I want is to be banned for something I didn't do.
---
My base duplicated 6 times which was annoying have nearly 600% above budget.  I had such a nice base but kept spawning NY friends and I inside every fast travel.  Moving the camp module about didn't help either.
---
Sorry to hear your story.  Send a support ticket and I'm sure they will unban you if what you say is correct.
---
Based off what’s being put in the Atom store it may show up there.
---
I heard you can reduce weight of explosives by 90%.
---
I have the most issues with repairing the mainframe. Clicking the cores but never picking them up, or it auto-scrapping the damaged ones to repair others. 
---
This was amazingly well written and brought up amazing points...I dont have anything useful to add but i wanted to express my awe 
---
suprised people still play this game, with so many better mp games out and coming out in the following months i dont see how this game will survive. Instead of adding content they had spend the last couple of months fixing the game....
---
Modus does have that evil feel to him. But he also has the best stuff for sale so let's not make him evil
---
Ore is also easier to find as junk, and although aluminum isn't rare by any stretch, it is still less common than steel. So maybe it was to balance that.
---
I don’t agree. People won’t grief as much as you think. 
---
I didn’t spend my limited hours into a character and thousands of caps into plans and trading to have to redo it again. 
---
PVP is always going to be broken. They can’t fix it even if they removed TSE I can one shot anyone with my bloodied sledge and at around 30hp the reductions I get on dmg are good enough to be competitive with current weapons. 
---
So let’s stop pretending melee isn’t just as over powered and after the TSE nerf I think it’s equal
---
I would much rather them fix duping and other bugs since now I’ve seen Hunting rifle explosives floating around. 
---
I agree. There are a lot of other things that deserve higher priority than Survival Mode. 
---
Even for PVP, the planned **Player Faction System** would be a lot more exciting and interesting than a chaotic deathmatch mode.
---
Such sass 😂
---
Try to ensure that you aren't too tied into the terrain.  It makes moving the camp difficult.
---
Whatever ... My point still stands. Not allowing transfers just simply pushes whatever problems ( either real or imagined ) down the line. 
---
I run a “blow shit up heavy weapons guy build”.  It can be done, here’s how I set it up.
---
Need max demo expert, max bear arms, max ordnance express at the minimum. Bloody mess rank 3 is a must too. Gunsmith 5 helps a ton to slow durability degradation. 
---
With bear arms my heaviest “heavy gun” is a 4 lb minigun. Missile launchers weigh around 2-4. Broadsider is less than 2 with mods. You get the idea. Auto grenade launcher isn’t effected though for some dumb reason. Mini nukes weigh 0.6 and missiles are 0.2 with ordnance express. I basically keep all this shit on me at all times.
---
Luck of the draw can be a nice bonus but it’s inconsistent when it procs. I have rank 3 but I’ve heard 1 procs more but repairs less. Also don’t be afraid to pop psycho for bonus damage. 
---
Take ammosmith to craft your ammo. Horde springs like your life depends on it. Farm fertilizer for making grenades. Brahim pen helps. I also save all my spoiled food because you can turn 10 pieces into fertilizer.
---
Lock and load 3 is a nice luxury if you can afford it.  I highly suggest taking stabilized 3 to ignore 45% DR with heavies in power armor. 
---
I have 15 STR because I keep 1 tier of heavy gunner each for non-explosive big guns. 13 INT for gunsmith, stabilized, and demo expert.  I swap out weapon artisan 3 to repair to 200%. 
---
Fire in the hole rank 1 is nice for the arc when throwing nades. I haven’t taken ranks 2 or 3 as they don’t seem necessary. Grenadier gives bigger booms for said nades. MIRV’s are my favorite. 
---
My tools of destruction include:
---
- Instigating fat man
---
- Daisycutter (0.6 lbs!)
---
- Bunker Buster w/ quad barrel and lock on computer
---
- anti armor broadsider w/ multi shot canister
---
- anti armor M79 Grenade Launcher (auto GL is too heavy and spammy and I waste a lot of shots) 
---
- 10+ nades (frags, MIRVs, plasma, etc)
---
- executioners explosive black powder pistol (796 damage!)
---
- explosive cryolator with crystallizing barrel
---
Support weapons (non explosive):
---
- .50 cal 
---
- anti armor flechettes harpoon gun 
---
- 2x high speed miniguns with shredding barrels for melee
---
Not a fan of the flames or Gatling gun as I prefer to run minigun with no ammo as a melee weapon. 
---
Wow that was long. Got carried away. Maybe this will help your build though! Hope it was a fun read
---
I don't agree with everything in this post but I agree with the sentiment.
---
For me the world just feels empty now with little to do that has any reward. 
---
Not in the post op only said they had a no visitors sign. If we would’ve been the same platform they may have let me come take a look.
---
How did you learn two shot?
---
Wait what? Scrap duplicate perk cards to learn equipment mods? Wth are you talking about? 😕
---
Yep ! Best addition ! 
---
Maybe the radio station could open up a quest to find that "thing" Grahm is looking for? Some type of quest reward that when traded with Grahm opens up some additional locked inventory items that you normally wouldn't be able to see or purchase. 
---
H: Rosebud Sled, W: Chally the MooMoo statue plans
---
Those are insane stats in PvP! I don't blame them for exploiting it. 
---
Don’t really care about pay to win,  since  I don’t pvp. I’m all for an environment that lumps them all together.
---
&gt; you’re exaggerating the level of vitriol that people have if you turn down a trade request.
---
It's not turning down the trade request that was the problem. It was the people using the trade mechanism as a means to make sure they could one-shot you with a TSE and you couldn't one-shot them back.  As I said in my last reply, I realize I can fast travel, block, change servers etc. But, as I said, since I've stopped accepting random trades I don't have to do that.
---
And it's not a matter of being weak.  it is a matter of playing the game without being harassed and annoyed by people with nothing better to do.
---
I don’t think you realize this game was a side project not meant to be developed this fully...
---
Assuming your British it's a metal sink fountain.  It took me ages to find as I was looking for a proper water fountain lol.
---
Best efficiency of special points is 1 in each for a total of 30% damage for 3 special points, compared to 60% damage for 9 special points. If you just want max damage then dump all 9, but if you want a really strong build that is versatile then spread your points around
---

---
Never mind aluminum isn’t found in deposits... That bugs me every time I see these nodes.
---
Oh I see. Then I would say the inspection button is the source of the annoyance and *that* should be fixed, instead of making named items untradable. 
---
I don't need specifics or promises. I want to know if the weekly events are just some dumb quests with things that are already in the game or if there will actually be new content. I haven't had anything to do in the game in weeks. Can I uninstall or just wait? It would be nice to know.
---
He doesn't even have to start over, he can just grind more levels and buy the single versions of those perks again. That's how everyone else refines a build when they've upgraded things too far by mistake.
---
My 2 shot fatman is doing just fine... /shrug
---
I agree with the weight nonetheless.
---
No worries.
---
They release one every week. 
---
When I was getting my nuke key card, all I had with me was my lever action .45 and my .308 sniper rifle. I don't keep "big guns" because I'm a sniper build. It took freaking forever to bring that stupid thing down. 
---
The whole time I was thinking "I bet if I had a missile launcher this would be easier" Was I wrong in that assessment? 
---
Aaaand you actually convinced me! I'll have a pint outside instead of trying survival :-) 
---
I don't think you understand what OP was saying.
---
Only things on the map should be players with bounties.
---
Great for anyone trying to roleplay Captain America or Wonder Woman, lol.
---
It's not an exploit, it's just things in the game. No bobbleheads or anything needed
---
Yeah, carry a melee weapon as back up in case you run out of ammo or a couple of diff ammo type weapons. 
---
You might even find one or two upgrades in there whilst your doing it :D
---
I feel this way as well. The games comes so close to being an MMO that it raises expectations that it will behave like one. I don't have faith that they intend to meet expectations.  I have had a great time in-game, and honestly haven't played anything more immersive (when it's not crashing) in my long gamer experience. I will be sad when boredom sends me on my way.
---
Wife and I found this cave last week, very cool location. Congrats on the CAMP! Very Cool!

The auto is amazing for my demo build
---
Not like it would matter they would just find another way to dupe all their stuff again
---
I’ve been using a spiked Black Diamond (legendary ski sword you get from Rose that does +1 strength) as a backup
---
I'm doing that since day 1
---
Hey good, I just made a similar post but my demeanor is more agressive and will protect get downvoted lol
---
I'd say furious. AA doesn't effect everything and a minigun reaches max furious damage quickly
---
I lost armor to that hopper as well. Let’s have a moment of silence for all the lost gear. Also side note that can food must have a high degree of batch differential.
---
130+ hours on PC and 1 kill - a minor disagreement over a Workshop .... and HE started it!!
---
yep...
---
He already wiped out the enclave once, perhaps a rouge proprietary ai tricks you into getting it the resources it needs to wipe out the newly emerged Vault dwellers. Modus does have that one burned out section in his core and he could still help you take down 'Enclave Prime'.
---
Higher level Super Mutants have assault rifles and drop ammo for it more often. Based on my observations, I'd say the level 42 Super Mutants have a chance to have them
---
If they make any form of roadmap then all their good and bad ideas will mediately be available to be put on blast. I doubt they will do such a thing. The core gameplay is still not where it should be. And this new "survival mode" is not new content, it's just different servers that force you into PvP. 
---
Nice.
---
Then I challenge you to hunt down folks murder noobs and lowbies and champion for their behalf. Lolz
---
My main needs work he’s all over with perks, as a tank. Mostly SB magnet. When I figure out how I want to play it, tank gunner or tank melee he will come out of retirement.
---
My alt is coming along well. Ranged stealth. 
---
What is caps?  Yeah okay we are done here lol.
---
It's a mode for the missile launcher has a three shot one and the mini nuke has a two shot chamber mode...I can't recall where to find them but they're out there...
---
I wouldn't call it punishing. Its only punishing if you are on the losing side. Its rewarding if you are winning PVP. There needs to be some incentive to PVP because at the moment there is absolutely no upside. Its so easy to earn caps and junk that PVP is basically pointless at the moment. I'd be happy with RNG drops of any weapon/armor in your inventory as well (only in survival). Don't bring anything you dont want to risk. 
---
Agree with everything else tho
---
Oddly, I was thinking something like that yesterday...having a Liberty Prime raid or something similar. I forsee plenty of people getting melted by his eyebeams, or grabbed by the head (like the deathclaw in FO4) and tossed like a ragdoll.
---
Pretty sure armor pen of 100% isn't possible because different modifiers aren't straight additive with each other.
---
I have my personal experience and my word. I'm 56 years old and I've never made a habit of lying to people. Believe me, or not. It's no skin off my back. However I know that this glitch/bug/cheat was real because I had it happen to me. I have no clue as to why they would steal either piece. Neither has little or no game value, so why? I'll tell ya why. People as a group are ignorant and greedy. There are good individuals, but the human race sucks ass.
---
Dumb
---
Also if you are keeping highly radiated then Radicool will give you up to 5 STR based on your radiation. 
---
Well generally, in the real world and most fiction, high explosives are used to kill tanks/big creatures so I feel like it would fit better if the game gave some kind of bonus against large enemies for explosives.  Explosives already have a 'bonus' against small enemies given that they can hit multiple of them at once but this AOE isn't really helpful against a target larger than the explosive radius.
---
Sit, dear.
---
And it looks so cool! I want it to be just a little better so it doesn't get ignored by 99% of players!
---

Just put these efforts in making the current game more stable and keep more QOL inprovements. I came back after from launch at the last patch. The game def seems more stable but the last 2 days the loading times have been unreal. I enjoy the game but I just want whats there to work!!! 
---
There is Patriot skin for combat armor. That's newest I've seen
---
Honestly, what is up with the current holotape setup? I don't see any sense to it. I mean I understand my character isn't lugging them around in an organized binder, but either present them in an organized fashion or give us a minigame where we have to rummage through a bag of mixed holotapes to find the one we need. 
---
The rank progression for each card is 10%, 15%, 20%, a diminishing return after the first card each. So you can get 30% with 3 cards, or 60% with 9 cards.
---
Incisor (75% armor penetration) and Martial Artist (+30% speed) are also pretty useful for melee damage. But by then you're using up all 15 strength points. And then blocker is very useful too, reducing incoming melee by 45% for another 3 points, so there's some tradeoff to think about.
---
I also aim for 3 points in Bloody Mess (another 15%), and a point each in Tenderizer and Adrenaline.
---
Do not have a central known location to respawn like vault 76 or people will just camp to kill respawns and yes cant show players on map
---
Thanks for reading. If be happy to discuss the game more with anyone who'd care to listen!
---
Are you sure about that? I like to throw grenades next to patches of enemies and trigger them with an explosive weapon before the pack moves away. It always felt like it doesn't work without Grenadier ★★.
---
The only reason all of these overpowered things are readily available was some guy finding them and mass duping them. With new characters, good luck ever finding more than one piece of sentinel or cavalier, let alone high rolled explosive weapons.
---
As long as the duping gets addressed soon, new characters on those servers would make it a much healthier economy
---
Aluminum is considered a "rare" scrap material.

I mean all they have to do is say your gear from adventure mode does not follow you to survival mode. You retain all your perks and levels, but gear is bound to server. Problem solved. Veterans get their advantage, gear is neutral. You start with basic gear or materials to craft what you want, then get playing.
---
If Bethesda stands up a dedicated PvP server, I think you’ll get your wish.

I’ve already seen a big improvement on stability at night while playing.

Weapons: this is where weight issues happen most.  I carry two super sledges, a TSE pump, TSE handmade, TSE 10 mm. This makes up most of my carry weight, but if your lucky or have that caps 90% weight reduction is a perk on TSE guns.
---
I'd like to see a video of that
---
Doesn't shoot two at once just two in chamber and with the speed reload card you can shoot the nukes as quick as you can click the mode make it 2 instead of one.
---
Oh, the launch week announcement......
---
That's coming in this games shelf life, not January.
---
Well said
---
I had no idea how to trade for the first month of the game and since no one had mics it was confusing as hell. 
---
It's dumb in hindsight because the instructions are clearly written. But I guess I was too distracted by the presence of another player to catch it. 
---
To be fair, it was a pretty nifty door 🤣
---
That had never occurred to me!  I'm going to have to test this when I get home this evening.
---
Or just have names be character only. So if you name a weapon, you're the only one who sees that name.
---
6 shots with the rocket launcher and one rifle shot &gt;.&lt;
---
They're doing it for fun, they all have duped bulk junk (the pvp server should hold them for a while)
---
No.  That will not end well.
---
I've always wanted this, even back in Fallout 4.  Someone finally made a mod for 4 that does it.  
---
In case anyone is interested, here's a link: [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/29340](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/29340)
---
Flatwoods counts as both for some reason - when I killed one, both were checked off for me.
---
I would more prefer him just firing off a flare every half hour or so.
---
Oh. I’m from Norway, but this does help! Thanks!
---
Wow they fixed something that should have been obvious before they released it. /slowclap
---
Diablo's loot system is designed well to keep the player going. Especially with little things to work toward like combining runes, or the gems. Fo76 and 4's legendary system has way too much garbage compared to the good stuff.
---
How do you go through life being THAT scared of people?
---
Furious and use the Stabilized perk (Int) that gives 45% ignore armor at max.
---
Yeee, that was the last problem I experienced before quitting. 
---
I store all the holotapes except for the quest-related, the supply requisitions, and obviously any holotape I might have just picked up.  That way I can easily locate whatever tape is needed which for some areas I just picked up.  
---
But, yeah, your point is still valid especially when people carry aground a lot of those holotapes.  
---
If I ever see duplicates in my stash I just drop the extra.  
---
I've only seen posts asking for time left on events, never time until next event. Would reduce the need to server hop to find events if you have an inkling of how long you might need to wait until the one you want will be up on the server you're on. 
---
There are some items that are not instanced, why, not sure. But the components for flux: Hardened mass, glowing mass as well as the glowing meat and blood are one per body globally. 
---
Oh okay so it's not a two shot it's just an extended chamber clip. 
---
I suspect if they make it new characters griefers will stay put anyways.
---
Why fish in an ocean when you can fish in a barrel
---
I want to know - are TSE still ridic overpowered compared to everything?  I am level 78 and have no TSEs but my melee is up to 300-400 damage but i am LEGIT scared to even TOUCH another player, even though I have all legendary armor and run psychobuff
---
In March? Homie if you guys don’t like add new stuff soon the player base will drop off entirely in the next month. Not me. But most. 
---
New Game releases will split off the player base. We need updates and fixes ASAP. 
---
Just about to say Clownshoes is a fantastic saying.
---
If you want a build change and you need 20 more perk cards and need to change some to different specials it’s kind of hard and leveling up at lower levels is easier 
---
Oh wow, this is nice. I had a base near here but I never found this cave.
---
Agree, this is great
---
Your fucking right I’m not the ideal customer to keep buying one game over and over. You want fallout 5, not 76.
---
Hahaha, 
---
youre right, just want to make sure you know there are literally dozens of us that would hate to see it removed.
---
great post op... I usually get annoyed with armchair game developers... but EVERYTHING here is gold.
---
Unstead of an upvote and nice comment... Bethesda should offer you a jobber.
---
Ah yes, the old "Works on my machine you guys are just stupid" defense.
---
Which can be melted at a chemistry bench with some acid 😀
---
In other words, you wanted a single player game and now you're mad. Good talk.
---
I'm personally excited to test out the new PvP mode... 
---
Most duoers don’t have the balls to pvp they would rather pick on the non pvpers makes them feel good somehow
---
That's the issue with this right there.
---
Bethesda have backed themselves into a corner on this one. 
---
They can't allow the duped economy to transfer to new servers though can they? They have to Fix it, remove duped items then ok it wouldn't matter so much. But if someone can carry over a stack of 85k explosive bobblehead's and 500 TSE shotguns that they exploited for its not right is it?
---
Yes a few builds will negate TSE's but then everyone has to change there build due to duped items. Its not a problem being TSE'D to death every once in a while by some one that got lucky and looted that god roll weapon but every single person rocking them? No. 
---
I've got about 350-375 hours in game so far done about 50 whitesprings nukes and never looted a TSE shotgun, lever action or handmade. I know RNG hates me lol I'm ok with that, i can wait till i do loot one, it will be all the more sweeter, or I could go to Bazaar and buy one (duped more than likely) but i prefer to loot my loot myself as that's my content, that's the purpose of all the killing at whitespring. If i bought weapons of ebay id stop playing after a day or two as it would get boring fast and i'd feel  all other loot is useless now if ya get me.
---
Amen, been complaining about the travel pharma glitch for so long and they're finally dealing with it.
---
Hmm thought this was confirmed already but maybe I'm misremembering
---
I think it has less to do with us and more to do with the fact that reviewers bashed pvp pretty hard.
---
😀
---
If it gives us the option of removing players who tag and hide then I'm all for it haha.
---
I really do love the core of this game, and want it to be better. It's why I'm trying to be constructive.
---
It's a conditional insult that only applies if you're full of it and actually duped. If you didn't, then I'm out a kidney, and the insult doesn't apply! =p
---
If it's really due to a glitch, then I feel for you and hope it gets resolved soon. I just see these kinds of posts often and believe fully that they're [almost] all lies to try to convince... someone (the community? themselves? a delusional attempt to catch the eye of a Bethesda rep "oh, gosh! We did that? Unban him now! Give him free things to make up for what we did to this poor soul!" a la Ralphie's soap poisoning in A Christmas Story)
---
If drop a bag for a other player to pick up, i take a 10mm pistol and shoot at it. Mostly, they get it and look at it.
---
Get full demolitions and rock bear arms + ordnance express, seriously.
---
They're not weak at all, you probably are just expecting the things to be noob tubes. My heavy gunner one shots pretty much anything that isn't a scorchbeast with his missile launcher.
---
Learn to play, explosive weapons are deadly AF if you get perks for them. Just like any other weapon class, you gotta get the perks.
---
Don’t forget a lot of scrap you might not expect has lead in it too.  Every tin can has lead and steel (don’t forget ammo recipes need a ton of scrap steel as well) but my absolute favorite is paint cans, which have 5 lead and 2 steel each. More with the scrapper perk as well!  This includes every paint can except ones marked as empty, meaning “paint cant”, “blue paint can”, “red paint” can etc.
---
Often you will find 3-4 in a single area as well. I always grab the 3 cans next to the Harper’s Ferry vendor every time I visit. Yes, they are very heavy but there are scrapping benches almost everywhere.
---
Plus clearing the plant mission auto makes the power supply 100 for the fusion core generator outside, makes things so much simpler
---
And yet, no fertilizer
---
Idk I played today (Xbox) and got dropped multiple times on my alt....
---
Anyone else reminded of Chuck Palahniuk's book Rant? 🤣
---
Works same pretty much though click fast enough and it's pretty much 2 shot with mirv makes it ouch throw a car in the mix it's Oblivion...
---
They are mostly just good for a small stat boost, though there is the one that sort of outlines enemies in red
---
Thats not a fair assessment. I'd like PVP and enjoyed the initial PVP I engaged in during the beta, but there are no rewards for PVP so I don't bother with it. In the time I can play I can either find someone to fight for a few scraps of junk and a few caps, or go raid some junk locations. Raiding the junk locations nets me 1400 caps by wiping out all the vendors and keeps my stash full of scrap. Why would I bother with PVP? If people dropped something useful I would PVP far more often.
---
Nope not that I'm aware of, though the perks for extra junk from scrapping and super duper can help your resource efficiency when making and scrapping weapons over and over again
---
&gt;people hit their perfect build too early already
---
What level is that, in your opinion?  I'm 88 and put 3 points in Strong Back and have been kicking myself for not leaving it at 2.  I still have about another 12-15 levels to go to reset things for the auto rifle build I want.  So let's say I get to level 105ish and they nerf TSE rifles (I don't have one) and beef up something else so I have to change skills around again to shoot for the weapon flavor of the month and it takes me another 10-20 levels to adjust for that.
---
Is 150 or 175 a good point to have the perfect build?
---
How long does the perfect build last?
---
Fireworks. He likes the pretty lights.
---
Pretty much. As long as they aren't 100% invincible and cant 1 hit KO everything. There are levels of balancing that need to be done. But if 300 hours in the game were spent legitimately playing and not exploiting, they earned that. But when someone played 30hours exploited xp to level 200, payed $25 on ebay for a TSE shotgun....... get rid of how they did it and the product of the exploiting.
---
Anyone else think there should be a Pinned Thread that lists things people shouldn't post about because they're so common?
---
Pretty much why I left. Launched a nuke, finished the main quest. Did the few interesting side-quest chains I found... that's pretty much it. I've done pretty much all of it, and I sadly don't have a reason to log in. I'm hoping that something new comes out soon to bring me back
---
TSE will not kill you in one shot in pacifist mode. Please don't spread false information.  Clearly you were attacked by an exploiters or you had 1 hp or you were wanted/flagged for PvP and unaware.  I will friend you and shoot you with explosive weapons just to prove it if you want.  Please stop spreading the lies about TSE weapons and also acknowledged that they already announced a nerf to two shot and explosive.
---
I can one shot anything that isn't a scorched beast/queen murloc queen/king with my FAT MAN.... so i wouldn't class that as "Okay damage".   
---
Its just most of the community is basing their damage comparisons on something that is blatantly overpowered (being melee mutations, two shot and explosive legendary perks.).   
---
Not to mention that explosive weapons are more so geared for AoE altercations and base raiding. They serve their purpose.   
---
If people are having trouble playing a 100% explosive build with only missiles/fatmans/grenades then i can defiantly tell you that will be a challenge. The game hardly even starts until you hit level 50 when you can actually hold items with perks.   
---
**Just want to reiterate that the OP is complaining about AMMO weight which isn't an issue with Ordnance Express.**   
---
**If players want buffs to explosive weapons "BASE DAMAGE" then go for it..... but there will need to be corresponding nerfs to damage buffs to compensate. As someone whos level 180 and plays an explosive heavy weapons user, they are by far not under-powered for what they offer.** 
---
Sounds good, now gogogo get that Power Armour!
---
Thank you for giving Chally the recognition she deserves. 
---
And players your teamed up with but only for the team not everyone lol
---
Whitesprings is ridiculous for legendaries. First time I went there at level 40 the legend/normal ratio on enemies was probably 1/7, when I'd seen about 10 legendary enemies in the whole game before that. One queen _maybe_ giving a library could never beat the odds in Whitesprings
---
That's not even considering that the PVP rewards are garbage. Theres almost no point in wasting time with it.
---
I can't believe it is still bugged. I've been avoiding it since release for this reason. At least the fixed it giving food to the whole server though, right :D
---
This. 
---
It should have been like this from the start. 
---
This happened to me once when I spawned at the train station nearest the palace of the winding path.
---
I kid you not when I say that not 1, not 2 but 6 OF THEM were immediately on top of me upon joining. I was only level 20 at the time so I noped the **** outta there.
---
What’s worse was they started hostile.
---
Yeah, if you finagle the height of your camp when you initially place it you can get some impressive height going. There's a cliff I managed to make a staircase from top to bottom. It was 7-8 stories. 
---
Its possible with Melee to obtain 100% pen. 95% with heavy  weapons and 86% with rifles weapons when combined with the anti-armor legendary perk.  
---
Damn dude...someone asked a simple question and I responded with an honest answer. Why are you being such a condescending asshole? I'm done with this conversation.
---
haha 
---
Good catch!
---
Well maybe your problem is you wanna re-spec every month.
---
Most players hit their build around 100, including most of the crafting Perks. Sooner if they plan thoroughly, later if they re-spec halfway through (like I did).
---
"look chally moomoo, skyfire!"
---
Lol, God forbid they address the real problems. Can you imagine if other online PVE (primarily) games' endgame content consisted of a single relatively-easy and straightforward enemy you just have to kill over and over?
---
Since I'm too lazy to mine ore, I'm just doing Breach and Clear events. They do not yield as much, but I think it's about 50-something lead ore per event. 
---
I learn!!
---
It's probably the same bug from fallout 4. I used to have stealth field on my power armor, but then switched to a jetpack. It would still turn me invisible when I would crouch, even though it clearly had a jetpack.
---
That's a pretty good thought, haha. And if they clear up duping issues then they'll REALLY have no reason to go over there!
---
I see your point. I'd be happy with just seeing my own contribution. There is already a message box popping up when the queen spawns, so there is room to place such messages.
---
I've seen another post about this in the past few hours but never before. Is this newly broken?
---
It is bitter sweat isn't it. It is a relief to have it but it really should have been there since the beginning. I have a hard time passing out high fives for this kinda thing. Still though, better than nothing.
---
I had no head all the time I was on yesterday I'm using chameleon armour 
---
Does this mean campaign is finally being introduced?????
---
&gt;This is needed, maybe not for you. But for those who want a challenge it is.
---
I'm sure some people want it, but they're a tiny fraction of the user base. The reason many people are pissed about this is because a) the way it's described now is lazy and stupid, and b) they're dumping god knows how much time and money into a new mode when there are still glaring fucking issues with the base game.
---
fairly certain second bullet isn't affected by accuracy or range mods either (at least in fallout 4)  first bullet on point, second bullet way off target or doesn't even make it there if at extreme range.
---
I think the issue is that most fallout players dont play fallout to PvP. I spent an hour or so tonight being involved in my first community gear sharing event using the text chat mod on PC. It was amazing. All of us just chatting and dropping surplus gear or trading in someones camp. THAT is the ONLINE experience we want in Fallout.
---
I love how so many people use their stash as a trash can for holotapes lol 
---
Not sure why you felt it necessary to try and gatekeep having an opinion behind finishing the game or getting to an arbitrary level.
---
Shh keep it to urself lol I wish they don’t fix it
---
Give em a break, there are only a few interns working on the game. Sometimes I think we expect too much from those two kids.
---
For me (level 88) some days are "gather mats for ammo" days.  Some days are "make money to buy another serum" days.  Some days are "do nuke sites every time they pop up" days.  Some days are "do xxx location to gather rare xxx material" (although those don't take a lot of time).  Some days are "level as much as I can" days.
---
I always have an idea of what I'm going to do each day.
---
I did as well. I figured I would get into the game and there would be this great expanded building system as Bethesda pushed the notion of "Rebuilding America" for the release of the game. We would be amongst those who would build places like Megaton City, New Vegas, or Diamond City. 
---
I agree that even the vanilla system in FO4 was decent. I spent quite a bit of time building and while it had an order or operations you needed to follow to build something, it was leaps beyond the system in FO76. You make an excellent point about researching the most popular mods for FO4 and working to implement the ideas into the building system. 
---
If those responsible for the building system in FO76 actually played either game or did their research, they would have been able to create a more flexible system. The tight restrictions on budget, area, items (decoration), *needs support, part of the base will be inaccessible, object intersects, object is floating,* etc, are a hindrance to building. I understand the idea was to keep people from making floating building, but none of this has stopped them. They have only restricted those who want to make something more interesting than a box.
---
There are still outlets for interesting builds, but not as much as there could be. These restrictions also just make it more frustrating to build. It drags on the building experience longer than it needs to and instead of progressing through your design, you're fighting a system that won't allow you to do something They recently noted they were going to make a bulldoze tool for CAMPs, but I've yet to see it. They instead sold it off as placing objects will make some objects disappear, yet still no option to take a way the grasses that clip through floors or take away a tree/rock/stump that you may want to get rid of, but not build something on top of. 
---
I will say that I like the UI and interface of the new building system with the tabs at the top of the screen, but the restrictions only took the system in FO4 and degraded it. We could use half high stairs, vertical half walls to work with the half floors, stairs that can be tucked against a wall instead of in the middle of a wide floor, ability to place junk items as mentioned, and more to improve on the system. I realize I may sound entitled to ask for MORE, but in all honesty, you'd think that a new game would improve on the previous system, not degrade it. Bethesda really dropped the ball here. 
---
I haven't experienced it myself, but other post indicate the shed-dwellers are prime candidates right now anyway. Yes, there are some who are there to share their cards but they are in team so a team indicator could resolve that in the board.
---
I would accept that as a compromise. 
---
Although I wonder if they can do that with databases ect.
---
So.... whats the point of even commenting if you don't PVP. That's pretty much the entire point.  
---
And Pay to Win is the worst thing to ever happen to gaming. It completely defeats the purpose of PVP in a game.
---
No, I would love to be able to modify perks...but have to scrap cards to learn it. Would give a real reason to keep playing after I reach high levels.
---
I am on my fifth character because endgame just isn't all that fun.
---
Take the upvote, would love to see where this game is headed.
---
I just picked up the western revolver plan (named Plan: Revolver) at Pleasant Valley Train Station.  This was on my level 80 something character.  I've not seen it yet on my level 15 pistol build so it may be level 20+ since I THINK that is the minimum level you can build.  I could be wrong about this last part though.
---
Honestly communication is still terrible.  We just get a few vague comments and teasers each week and some "thanks for the feedback" comments in threads.  Its nothing meaningful.  We still don't know much of anything until the day a patch comes out.  There hasn't been a single developer/leadership comment on the state of the game, why the launch was so rough and what the plan is going forward in a broader sense.
---
That's true..eh I'm not mad at them either way. Maybe a little jealous of them and their duped shit but I am loving this glitched out game regardless 
---
They bashed everything in the game though and Bethesda are tunnel visioning on PVP ...a feature no one ever played any other fallout game for :(
---
How people can still defend and white knight for them is madness.
---
It was ok for the PVP to be not the best bit about the game, as no one expected it would be the best PVP game made etc.
---
I just hope Todd and some crappy dev that's got his ear aren't looking at the fortnite monies and thinking if they can do it we can do it. Clearly they could, with a different game engine and franchise. Stick to your strengths Bethesda, work on your own thing and don't worry about what others are doing :/
---
Jealousy and Greed &gt; Quality and Loyalty to your fan's
---
There's too many servers and no way of knowing how close to a reset one is for that to work. There's thousands of servers. (Or "instances"/"worlds", whatever. Same thing in this case)
---
Dupers sell stuff for real money. Resets and ladders only increase their profits due to reselling nonsense.  Bots will always exist.  I'm sure someone has a bot farming westek 24/7.   Wipes and resets will not fix this issue.   Sorry :( just stating reality lol
---
Why are people downvoting this, you're right
---
🤷 ya, it can take a little longer, I myself didn't finish my build till after 130. But I haven't found the leveling to slow down all that much post-50.
---
Major re-specs *should* take some time. Otherwise ya, everyone would just make new characters, or at least have to weigh the time it'll take against the plans &amp; gear they have and don't wanna give up. RPGs are all about choices right?
---
Yeah, but also the cosmetics are never anything cool. It's silly hats and outfits all the way down.
---
Just take some ore and acid to the chemistry workbench to melt them down 
---
Not true. Some helmets give a negative to perception. That makes you weaker.
---
I don't understand the way Bethesda seems to be prioritizing things either.
---
The Player Faction System they announced sounded exciting and interesting. A simple PVP Deathmatch mode does not.
---
Keeping be a douche, I personally do not care if you or others give a shit or not. I posted my opinion, that is it. It is obviously you that has a poor perspective thinking this is whinging.  I also can care less if people "turn the other cheek". Obviously you are wrong or no one including you would of replied. 
---
Such a poor game design as it is at the moment :(
---
Almost like no one at Bethesda played an event during Beta / Alpha 
---
&gt; would of
---
You probably meant **"would've"**! It's a contraction of "would have".

Cool. Where can I find melons in the waste?
---
PC here. I have no idea how to trade.
---
Oh, sorry, weird turn for the thread to take 🤣 just didn't expect that
---
Survival is going to be kill on sight.
---
There will be no decisions to be made when you see ppl.
---
The reward of caps to shit on ppl will stop the already non existent communications before engagement.
---
Bear Grylls would have no problem straining water-drenched SB shit through a dirty T-shirt to drink it.
---
I would go as far as to say not showing either of these. 
---
If they want a real PvP survival experience they should go all in. Make people have to communicate and coordinate. 
---
Also enable friendly damage. 
---
I just make new characters when I get bored and want something new have lvl 91,80 and currency working on level 32 for a demolition expert with rocket launchers
---
Agreed. I'm glad its finally here.
---
Forget about tickrate when every weapon worth a shit is essentially instakill vs players and all armor is pointless except for very specific legendary sets that are ridiculously effective against players.
---
It's not a custom jacket, they sell those in the Bethesda store. I have one and the thing is pretty darn comfortable.
---
They go to five for me...
---
Well, maybe they should have made a game that focuses on what appeals to those 90% in the first place. It sounds crazy, I know...
---
Ugh. Level 42, . . . 
---
I know that's doable at my level, but I'd probably expend the same amount ammo killing them as they actually drop, if I'm lucky. Again, not really complaining, but I just don't have that many free hours to play and so much of that time now is gathering/crafting. It's all good, as I have no desire to rush things, but it wears on me sometimes. Doubling crafting amounts just seems so far out of reach.
---
I wasted caps buying plans for that stupid mat and only afterward do i find out that it's just a stupid mat! WASTE!
---
This.  We don't pvp because outside of workshops, both parties have to consent.  But at the current rate, defending a workshop from a player costs far more resources than you can earn lol.  The ammo generation St the munitions facility for instance I'd abysmal compared to how much you have to spend on defense missions lol, let alone players assaulting xD
---
I think PvP damage in general should scale differently. 
---
I cackled 
---
Do you find them OTP or ITP?
---
All i want is a scrap-protection.
---
Whitesprings is fun wait till someone pops up a camp to grief people blast it and watch as they wonder wtf just happened....or if they keep blasting car near you to try and steal your junk wait till they go into the golf course then blast the bus when they come out can't escape sends all vehicles into a frenzy if they go left the truck gets them the repercussions from the other cars lower the health enough so the ghouls finish the work it's good if you don't mind the 100 cap bounty because your going to hurt a lot of peeps....
---
How many millions of people have purchased this game?
---
If they make it where everyone starts from scratch and only allow transfers from Survival to Adventure as some are calling for, then it might actually be fun, at least for a while, even for solo players.  I don't doubt there will be solo players that will play Survival, some will like the challenge and have the skills to pull it off, but those people who can be successful in an environment like that are rare.  Keep in mind this is just talk now, and things may work out differently once the Survival beta launches.  I would rather see BGS give players incenstives to align into factions and have pop-up pvp events pitting faction members against one another (in addition to the existing pvp mechanisms) with faction based rewards.  that would be something you could participate in if you wanted to join the event, or stay clear of if you do not and they need to be clearly defined as pvp events.  Sort of like workshops for factions in a sense.  Anyways just my own 2 caps on the topic.  I am sure we will see posts from folks with better ideas that BGS will hopefully consider.
---
Love the base and the area, but what I'm more curious about is your attire.  I love the whole set up you're wearing and want to know what it is if you don't mind!  
---
(Also really love your base and how it's set up!)
---
in my indie game i just made it where you could toggle helmet visibility lol.
---
I do because I hate having to scroll through a huge list because the tape I need is randomly located somewhere.  Then add on the fact that my TV is many feet away and the on-screen text is horrible to read...
---
Yup...holotapes get stashed. 
---
Like I said...I agree that something needed to be done to make it easier to find the needed holotape.  
---
I'd like to see damage numbers period.  But, showing everyone the damage done by the top hitters leads to elitism.  I had enough of that in WoW.  I was one who benefited from that system in WoW and it leads to jealousy and good people leaving your circle of friends.
---
Lol I have like 30c left after having a lotttt
---
Now I'm as poor in game as real life 😂😭
---
Considering they talked about the pvp mode before xmas new pve content is very far out.
---
I think March is being optimistic.
---
so this is how i get a reasonable amount of turrets, with a reasonably sized base.
---
Acknowledging that someone at Bethesda is aware of this isn't good enough.   This OP above is a VERY serious post that the dev team at all levels needs to fully understand and come to grips with.   There are things being done that are great and there are areas where the development of this game is falling on its face after spitting in the eye of a super mutant.

I can't stress to you enough how vital and important that the OP above be taken to heart and acted upon.   The world of Fallout 76 is rich with possibility and potential.   It is also stinking with the failures of a terribly flawed weapon system (50cal does less damage than 308?  That's stupid.  The whole caliber system needs to be reworked.  It doesn't have to be 1:1 real world, but it needs to be MUCH more realistic and varied than it is.   It is not fun to go on a run with only 2 or 3 weapons and have them all break.  Perks addresses that a little bit, but it is not enough.  The weapons weigh too damn much especially for the damage that they do.   Missiles and Fat Man Nukes barely do any damage.  They should be harder to find, weigh less, and do much more damage. The mechanics of all the weapons needs to be re-woven into a cohesive tapestry where there is more rhyme and reason.   Entire categories of weapons are useless at this point.  
---
The OP's point about Skins and using Fortnite as an example is most excellent.  You really need to understand the playfulness of skins (skins can tell jokes, add to stories, let the wearer "play as something" and so much more, you need to understand how to get people addicted to skins (give them some skins for free throughout the game, but don't just unlock it in some hidden menu, but show it to them... offer to let them put it on right then and there when they unlock it. People love unlocking stuff.   The Atom bucks is a step in the right direction, but there are about 10 other steps that need to be done as soon as possible to make skins a REAL part of the world that then also earns you money!)    Seriously:   The "clean" version of all the gear is kind of an obvious one.  Right off the top of my head there should be a "Moonshiner's" series of gear that features copper, steel, rivets, welds, and other visual features.  There should be a "BaD" series (Bailing-wire and Duct-tape) series where all of the equipment looks like it is barely holding together.  I mean some of this stuff survived (or didn't survive) a nuclear blast and much of it had to be repaired and "made to work" even if it isn't pretty.  There should be generators that look like they are about to fall apart at any time.    The skins should run a wide WIDE range of humor, satire, puns, role-play.  You really need to challenge yourselves to ask:   Fortnite has skins for holidays. How do you have a post-nuclear fallout version of Valentine's day?   You don't have very long to figure that out!   You damn well better come up with something for Fourth of July... the themes of Appalachia, Patriotism, etc... that is a ripe ground for coming up with something cool.   I'd really like to see it take on two forms:   The stars and stripes, fireworks, apple pie... but then maybe there is room for a more artistic form.... a little more subtle.   The challenge every couple of weeks should be to come up with something new that makes someone laugh, makes someone smile, makes someone cheer or say, "hell yeah!" because they see something of themselves in the skin.   Your job is harder than Fortnite's because they can make just about anything fit into a cartoon sci-fi fantasy world.  Your world is darker, grittier, but there should be carryovers from a happier time (that may not have come through unscathed, but they are still there).  You nailed it with the clown skin in terms of making the pants ratty and the whole thing dirty.... but that is just one set of clothes and not even really a skin for camp items.   Not everyone is cool with clowns anyway, so how do you take that same inspiration and bring something new?    
---
Each topic the OP brought up is a HUGE subject on its own that would take a lot of analysis to "do it right" and Bethesda really needs to tackle these issues.  The playground is too big to waste it on unrealized potential!  
---
Until you mod those 90% weight reduction guns. Then they weigh a ton! 
---
I farm low level hordes and give the legendary gear to new players I also just wander around for the hell of it you find some weird stuff 
---
That's not really out of the usual. Looking at achievements and trophies the overwhelming majority don't get very far in any game.
---
So edgy
---
I've been blessed on PC it seems as I've only crashed maybe 2 times and disconnected less than 5 times over 100+ hours, but 4 of those 5 have been after the last update :(
---
Quad exist, they are rare since they were seen as junk for so long most people would bag them at whitesprings or vendor them. Now they are a unicorn.   
---
Next week we will see a "new" what was very common but everyone trashed weapon as the flavor.  Or it could be drifter outfits...
---
Yeah it's one disappointment after another. I have 400 hours. Bout done with this game.
---
5 here
---
How are they rare? Grafton station had them the last 12 times I went. 
---
Ppl want this but they assume bethesda is capable of doing it.
---
Currently survival is just adjusting some sliders. Its not robust at all.
---
I love how disarming them is exactly as loud as triggering them.
---
I have well over 50 hours. At like 90 at this point, and i am not aware of these problems.
---
my 40mm does more damage than my missile launch
---
My impression from the last Into the Vault was like they failed to come up with decent description for new content (real content, not some numbers tinkering) in time and simply made a sloppy PvP mode announce that took them probably half an hour to come up with, and another hour to draw the mode picture. 
---
And the patch features were, like, opposite of exciting. A minor fix to some long-forgotten quest was deemed cool enough to make it into the highlight list? Does that mean other changes are even more useless?
---
What is your character wearing in this?
---
it bet not...
---
Yes, the targeting HUD. I used it quite a bit in FO4 but haven't seen it in 76. 
---
Oh demo experts are fun, enjoy that 👍 
---
And ya, new characters are a viable option too, it just sounds like this person wants to make a small refinement to their build (ie. using a lower level version of a Perk they upgraded) and not start fresh at all lol
---
Is this based on trophy stats? Just wondering because I am level 120 but my “reach level 100” trophy never popped. 
---
Better yet don't play it. Not worth taking the chance
---
The rare Traveling Leather Coat and the Assault Gas Mask.
---
Except dont listen to them about those weapon removals.  I use those weapons a lot actually. I dont care for nor will I engage in PvP and as such look to collect every weapon. 
---
Yes however, I don't think it stores wire so no electricity.
---
Traveling Leather Coat/Assault Gas Mask
---
"Dude, just create thousands of flags for every character and event you can think of, just in case we want them for the future."
---
"Or, we just don't bother with it, because it's not a big fucking deal.  I don't care what /u/Sabbathius says."
---
yeah my explosive revolver shouldnt do higher dps than a god damn literal missle launcher
---
You can look at any game's trophies and achievements and the stats will look very similar. The fact is that the vast majority of people never get far in games, let alone finish them.
---
NEVER do that event. I literally steer clear of it during game play
---
Great, random "It's just broken" bug.....
---
What vender would sells those?
---
That’s great! But for most people it’s not that easy. Haven’t you seen the plethora of posts? Granted, it’s less rare than the handmade but I can tell you than it took over a dozen stops at Grafton for me to see it.
---
Yes, I tried to shoot down a cargobot with a missile launcher and it was pretty pitiful damage. The two plus sides I could see to having one were the explosive AOE damage to hit all parts, and the tracking scope you get that seeking missiles. I think your better off with something higher damage wise that you can focus fire on the engines to slow it down. 
---
U need aluminium ? It’s easy just find a place like a convenience store/ gas station/ abandon house anyplace that has wind chime then server hop.... 
---
You answered your own question “I want to see if this is a game I want to continue to grind for” 
---
That’s why they aren’t releasing it, so people don’t read it and say oh that’s not what I want and stop playing, this way they can string you along for as long as possible
---
Fantastic Mod! Bethesda should make this part of the game. :)
---
I'd be way more likely to play it if duped weapons and level-200s could be kept out at launch. In fact, I'd probably lean towards playing it exclusively.
---
I would suggest the five level "no kill" window be retained, however, to avoid the no fun, rampant pinkie killing of certain other games. Let people filter out a bit and do basic acquisition before murder party starts. As long as you force them to cash in those levels (no banking 5 levelups at a time) that could really spread people out nicely. 
---
Been playing since Christmas and I'm level 27 lmao
---
And I have way more free time than many of my friends. Some people have jobs/families/other commitments man!
---
March is what, five weeks away?  I didn't expect anything major in the next five weeks, since nothing had been announced.
---
There's nothing wrong with putting the game down for a while and coming back in a couple months.  It's not like you're paying a monthly fee.
---
It's a very rare drop in the mire events, I got it from irrational fear or whatever one has the bees with a level 20 character.
---
Well said.
---
I especially like the point you made about the lack of human npc's highlighting the need for humans. I've felt that the choice to do so has made Appalachia eery, quiet and tragic.
---
I repurchased the lower ranks on the cards I took to far. It did set me back a few levels but it's over now, until I want to respec again.
---
This is straight up the most logical and thorough "rant" I have read on here. 
---
You're whole point is that Bethesda needs to look at the root of the problem and not just try and patch it with a shitty solution. 
---
There is just simply too much useless stuff in the game that clutter the loot pool which is a shitty lottery system to begin with. 
---
INCENTIVE is what we need. Things to look forward to. 
---
Not hoping that after 300 hours of play you might get a good weapon with 3 good effects out of all the useless combos that can drop. 
---
Except i like to use mine close up, which explosive makes more complicated.
---
Naw I haven't I got buddy that does all my trades, I hunt down what he asks me to. I guess I should start picking them up and reselling for what double the price?   
---
Normally I just hand out extras of X plan for free when I get them. 
---
Yes, and as far as I can tell, the universe isn't ending tomorrow, so they still have some time left to do it.  They never said they'd do it by January or anything.
---
That last point is especially important. If you don't have specific perks to a faction, I guarantee most people will join just BoS and Enclave.
---
Meh, why not just play day z or something xD that's game is too easily exploited and too unstable for this level of hardcore.  It's like playing hardcore diablo 2 on dial up.  Your enemy will be your connection. Sorry but I think they realize this degree of "hardcore" isn't feasible here.  Wish it was for you to get your rocks off but let's be realistic with what we are suggesting lol
---
Oh I thought they wanted a build change lol
---
Someone data mined a bunch of triggered messages, and there were a bunch for Christmas and New Year's messages about free gifts. 
---
We obviously never got them, so SOMEONE pulled the plug. 
---
I bought it for 20,000 caps from a kind gentleman I met at whitesprings.
---
TSE is getting a big nerf.  Where you been?  Why y'all still saying this lol
---
As the other post said, it's in the hotel proper. It's a bar behind a wall, facing a side gallery that is easy to go past if you don't walk around the nooks and crannies. The tender does hawk the special nukas in voice lines however, so you can listen for her. 
---
I want this game to succeed so badly though. I'm hoping that Bethesda is ready to take it on the chin and make this game really great, and make their money back later. I know it's a long shot, but I'm being hopeful.
---
🤣 no they just wanna be able to split their existing ranked up Perk cards back down into singles for flexibility
---
Thanks ;)
---
They did say there will be PvE content in March aswell
---
Calibrated shocks should be enough.  What else u want? Lol
---
I loved a spear once myself. Unfortunately he just couldn't keep me safe after a while. He had to be retired.
---
Nice! I really could’ve someone one night when I forgot to stock up on fusion cores.  I just exited my power armor and instantly died and left all my junk in a pile in a bush somewhere. I’m still learning and the experience of a higher level really makes a difference in a pinch. One day, when I’m all grown up, I hope to make a difference in the lives of many noobs.
---
My guy, they literally said PvE content will release in the same month
---
Agreed. I want to turn up Effects/environment without turning up gunfire/explosions. At least footsteps are available to adjust, now let’s take it a “step” further and give us more audio sliders
---
Nope, never,  and it's not going f2p, so these threads are pointless
---
And it does also deal bonus damage efen if you don't target limbs, right? The wording in spanish is kinda confusing, but after my obvervation I'd say yes
---
Road maps sound like a good idea but then lead to people being very angry because they think they have been lied to.
---
They're not doing this. Already confirmed.
---
Upvoted! With all the pvp talk to extend the end game content, I’d like to point out that there’s a lot of FO4 players who are settlement builders long after the end game. Why not let each of us join a faction that can build a town by pooling out budgets. We can have a trader town like the Bunker Hill people, military check points by BoS, farms/settlements by the Responders and intel groups under the Enclave banner that seek and provide the nuke launching codes. Players can experience one faction and then try another one. Each faction provides their expertise and take on some challenges that are too hard on their own but doable when working together. 
---
Many Fallout players aren’t pvp types or playing Fallout to pvp. Expanding on RPG can be the signature of FO76.
---
Having no public roadmap makes it seem like anything is possible/fixable but that is not the case at all. I've thought about this many times and have a pieced together a rough idea. I think there is a roadmap but only for internal development and it goes as far as the last planned DLC and EoL of the servers hosting the game. I mean this is a multi-million dollar publicly traded company releasing a product on one of their most well known IPs, a lot of people are going to want to know where their money is going and if it will provide a return.
---
This whole "we're listening and we respond" statement I think is mostly hollow was given to have players feel more engaged in the game. They probably do read many of the responses here and in other public areas but only implement changes that were already planned or very easy to do between patches/DLCs.
---
 We will get whats given and maybe they will squeeze some QOL changes in to keep people happy and the feedback coming in because that is valuable.  The game was released in and is not in complete or even a working state as-is so making sure people are still talking about it and looking for and reporting bugs is just another cost-saving measure. For me this whole game just seems like they cut a lot of corners to rush it out the door and let the public QA the game for them as long as the game launches on most configurations.
---
Didn't play in BETA, but did it provide the same function as the jukebox?
---
Nice to go to my home and have music playing in thebbackground while I'm making soup.
---
They also said they have other new content coming around the same time.  And March is five weeks away.
---
Fo4 took what, 8 months for them to introduce that survival mode?  People need to understand that FO76 has always been presented as experimental and a game that is going to be worked on for years.  Take the long view on it, you are not going to get the immediate satisfaction that you seem to expect.
---
Can these posts just be auto deleted? Out of hand 
---
One of the community peeps commenting on a post saying that PvP mode isnt the only new content for march :)
---
Instead of a whole new mode they should have made pacifist mode like GTA V's passive mode, where if you have it on you can't harm players and can't be harmed by players, and anyone with it off can kill players and be killed.
---
There is no need for a whole new mode which will just segregate players, Bethesda really has no fucking clue.
---
Don't always take the easy route my friend.
---
You'd grunt too if you got blasted in the junk with that one nozzle pointed just right... ouch
---
They already confirmed private servers/modded servers for console/PC at launch. Deadass you should probably look before you start crying online
---
Yeah, there was an interview after E3 that they more or less confirmed you suspicions. Starfield is "playable" but still needs work. My guess is 2020 but wouldn't be surprised if it was announced this summer for a fall 2019 release. The teaser for ES6 is pretty much all that was done for the game in July.
---
"Do you know if anyone has a post documenting new atom shop releases as they emerge?" Is what that means I think.
---
Still interested? I need this trophy too
---
Now, yes I am fully aware that this is supposed to be an ‘Online game’ but, I think Private servers may not be enough. I think it may be wise to implement an ‘Offline’ mode for the game with characters that CANNOT be taken online to prevent people taking advantage of bugs to take online.
---
The reasons why are this:
---
1: it would eliminate any kind of lag or delay for players.
---
2: If someone’s internet goes out or someone’s online service ends depending on their platform, they don’t have a ‘dead game’ on their system that they cannot play.
---
3: As with most ‘Online Only’ games, there’s always that point where servers may shut down and this would preserve the work that the world builders, writers, etc put into the game.
---
i mean. with our normal gear we have cosmetics. it would be the same functionality.
---
Not sure what delusion you were operating under to think you would get a warm reception in a thread full of women, “Biggest Milf Nipples”, but I guess I shouldn’t be surprised.
---
I counter your “toxic community” claim with “sexist asshole”. How’s that?
---
I think that’s kinda the point though. If Bethesda takes out all the ways to abuse, grief, and cheat, the mode won’t attract all the abusers, griefers, and cheaters. I’m happy if this new mode empties those folks from the adventure servers  :)
---
I think that is conjectural.  I have read strong opinions on both sides.  And either way, Beth will do what Beth will do.  :)
---
I don't necessarily disagree, but can you give some reasoning behind this?
---
I got this the day I posted this. But thank you !
---
My apologies I just looking for answer  (((OK )))!
---
Makes me feel a bit kroovis.. with a bit of a fron-ache.
---
Yeah, I’m really worried what “Biggest Milf Nipples” thinks.
---
I would love that! Certainly more interesting and exciting than a chaotic deathmatch mode!
---
False information. 
---
Base explosive damage is abysmal yes but once spec'd correctly they are 100% not under-powered. 
---
Do players assume you can just use Explosive weapons without the following perks?:
---
\-Bear Arms
---
\-Ordnance Express
---
\-Demolition Expert
---
\-Stabilized (only if you run power armor) 
---
\-One Man Army
---
\-Gunsmith (not required but assist durability if you dont have multiple launchers with bear arms) 
---
\-Weapon ARTISAN (to repair to full durability before use) 
---
Do players not have legendary explosive weapons? 
---
Do players not use Chem damge buffs? 
---
Do players not have mutations such as Adrenaline Reaction? 
---
Do players not use the free stealth 2x multiplier for just crouching before you initial engage? 
---
Do players forget Vat Crit builds work wonders for explosives? 
---
Do people not know how to play the game? 
---
I'm just saying, im lvl180, 500 hours played, been an advid explosive user, i dont think they need changes. People just gotta stop comparing explosive weapons to unbalanced gear (TSE and Melee Mutations). TSE will be nerfed soon and people will finally realize how valuable explosives can be. 
---
I just got a Limb damage, Executioners auto grenade launcher and its a monster. I got a bloodied fat man and a furious rocket launcher. They all have very good damage. I dont see the problem. 
---
**The only problem i see are people who are complaining they cant use something without being built for it.** 
---
If you want to change your build so drastically that it'll take 20+ levels to shuffle everything around or unlock perks you might as well just start a new character.
---
Oh ya I get it now I usually have a lot of duplicates from packs right after I finished ranking up a card. 
---
I mean, just check for yourself with 2 pieces it's easy to see. 
---
Yeah with the right perks you can kill almost everything whit a one shot
---
And the fleechete mod is also awesome
---
With that mod you have unlimited harpoons
---
I agree its worth 20k plus. I disagree that its was solely the dupers who ruined economy. Bethesda made a easy game to dupe in. Every game online game seems to have loopholes to exploit Fallout 76 has more and easier to do than  most.
---
stash and budget should increase along with level with no cap. This is how they should have originally did it.
---
At level 105 only found the legs, I just can't stomach the sever hoping needed to find things, I've done a fair share it detracts so much from the game (so boring). I'll find the rest I'm sure, I suppose it proves that Fallout 76 is really a random number generator influenced game. 
---
Couldn't agree more. Managed to snag an experimental MIRV the other day and made a shitload of mini-nukes to take to the scorchbeast queen. Literally did fuck all  
---
How exactly did you do it?
---
I'm gonna venture a guess they don't have a planned roadmap, I'd imagine if they had planned this game properly half the stuff that's happened over the last few months wouldn't have occurred to be frank.
---
Ya same, tons of random duplicate cards from packs. I'd have even more if they didn't cap you on duplicates for card sets that are already finished.
---
Gah I'm so lost
---
So people would die of nukes all of a sudden. So I can nuke Vault 76 where people respawn, or someone's camp.  I thought my intentions were obvious :)
---
Watoga high school roof with a buddy
---
not gonna lie when the new system comes out I will be going back to ps.  I got suckered into the xbox because of other people I knew and then the main deciding factor was my wife preferred the xbox so I compromised.  Worse part is the wife lied about how much she would use it so it was pretty much for nothing. 
---
I have that much and have never gotten TSE drop at all of any gun.
---
Biggest regret soo far in the game is moving it.
---
&gt; If BGS is adding BR to FO76 instead of addressing the core issues
---
That's not happening.  Not sure why everyone keeps getting worked up and claiming the sky is falling.  They are not adding BR (there's literally no BR components being added) and they are continuing to work on other content and the core game.
---
Rumor or not, this approach would be in line with Beth’s trend to make all benefits very marginal.
---
I can't buy that argument when we've already got cosmetic outfits that replace your armor visuals.
---
I want the heavy weapons to be absolute destruction, but impractical to carry on your back for blasting rad roaches. It's a balance between what you can commit to carrying all the time. Mini nukes are the right weight, but they SUCK at their job, and it needs to change. Hope that helps clarify things a bit.
---
I'm sick of seeing the same 3 weapons in every nuke zone all the time. You can spot the people who aren't strong enough to kill a queen by their weapons unfortunately. Why do weapons have a level 45/50 variant if they're not useful at that level? A golf club certainly isn't as good to be weaponized as a sledgehammer, but it's a game. Every apocalypse story I've ever seen has a group of people armed with a variety of weapons to suit their capabilities. I want variety and fun more than I want realism. I'm not playing Arma or whatever it's called.
---
Thanks for the constructive feedback either way.
---
So you let the creatures up there kill you?
---
You can demand whatever you want as long as you play by the rules.  
---
It reduces your max health but that is your full health until you remove the rads, pretty sure instigating weapons do fine 
---
So you know what it is, but are pretending not to?  That's far lamer than just knowing what it is.
---
There's very little hard information, but it was the 4th best selling game in November solely talking physical copies, and it sold 1.4 million digital copies that month as well. In the past physical purchases outnumbered digital but that gap is likely closing, so let's say 2.5-3 million sold in November.
---
It's been two months since then, price has gone down. I wouldn't even pretend to hazard a real guess, but I'd say we're definitely over 5 million copies sold, likely more in the realm of 10.
---
I really like the with Bungie gives the road map on Destiny.
---
Can't nuke 76 anyway, and you shouldn't be able to for this reason, ha
---
They should just turn the pvp off then and make is separate. Cause i hate getting flagged because somehow i mistakenly hit a workshop turret during an event.
---
There actually is a giant mascot head helmet that gives all of 1 DR.
---
I play legit and they would lose future revenue from my Atomic shop purchases and future content as I would scrap the game an never look back.  
---
Incredible. A modder was able to create something Bethesda says they couldn't because of limitations.
---
Holy shit, this game has some passionate followers.
---
im not sure if we are talking in circles
---
my point is they can put that time in the adventure server where it does not matter if they are behind, since people cant kill them on sight at grinding spots. then when they feel they are not too far behind they can transfer to the survival server
---
OMG this is so cool.  
---
I don’t care what level you are look me up on Xbox I always have spares of chems and cores and ammo in case someone needs it, same user name
---
Do folks accidentally put things into it themselves, or do things inadvertently get sucked into it when you bring the window open?
---
I'd like to do this event, but I might do it completely naked.
---
Those aren't answers, they're symptoms of what's wrong. To alleviate the symptoms you have to cure the underlying illness. That's the whole point of this post.
---
That's exactly what I started doing. It seems like a great way to fully take advantage of the Unyielding armor. 
---
Does the auto stim perk in adjust to 20% of my current health after rads or is it only 20% of total health?
---
Lol these posts are still getting made
---
It's not like the trading UI is actually well-designed and not a half-assed POS. Can't sell ammo and other large quantity items for &lt;1 cap per since you can only set the price per item as a whole number and have to just trust that they'll just honor the agreement and give you the remainder for free after selling them for 1 cap per until getting to the agreed upon price. Also item-item trades *still* aren't a thing yet and again have to trust that they'll hand over their item to honor the agreement...
---
Lazily implemented all around 
---
Agreed. I can carry what I want.
---
Well, I've been playing about 3 weeks nonstop. I'm only level 60, but I've cleared the whole "main story" and I feel like I got my money's worth a while ago.
---
I'd like to see certain perks that can be converted to innate character abilities as a rewards for game / character / level progression.   For that matter a remort system where you can level up to a certain point, and if you choose to start all over again, you get to pick one perk card that you can convert to an innate character ability that no longer uses up that perk slot / stars.    Every time you remort, you get to add a new ability.  
---
I wouldn't mind if there were only certain categories of cards you could pick from to do this.  Your character could be pretty OP if you were allowed to get some perks as innate abilities.  However, weight reduction just makes the game more playable and fun!   Plus I feel like with the weight reductions getting converted to innate abilities over time it's like you are paying your dues... you're playing the game and earning your ability to carry more over time.  Being able to free up some of those perk slots to experiment with other perks would add a lot of replayability for me.   
---
Back when i didn't have TSE weapons I mostly engaged pvp with explosive weapons... an anti armor, four shots, rocket launcher with guided missiles is pretty effective from afar, even against jumpy marsupial guys. With the right perks explosive weapons become very useful
---
Check out Monster Factory’s Fallout 4 videos. Go back to visit this location. You will feel pleasantly fulfilled.
---
I built in the exact same location but more of a mansion. Both beautiful and secure thiugh not completely ready yet. Still missing some plans
---
Use an smg or similar fire rate weapon. That allows you to hit enemies quickly, flamers work good too, especially the explosive ones. The party should share experience, but it doesn't unless it's an event/quest. Also, use the charisma perk for 15% more experience. That helps.
---
Thank you. You've expanded very well on what I'm trying to say.
---
I can definitely understand!! It is frustrating for sure, but it hasn't been enough to taint me, but I can definitely respect why you feel that way!
---
Problem is probably drivers, thanks for helping
---
I love the 'Thanks for viewing and STAY THE FUCK OUT OF MY CAVE'.
---
No where in there does it say January is when we are opening new Vaults.  Its on the list of items coming sooner rather than later.  That along with new quest, new events and the PVP stuff. 
---
It was similar, except it was tuned to the Appalachian Radio.

Exactly.  Dude there people are just trying to get ahead themselves.  They see this as an opportunity to "catch up".  I don't think they legitimately believe this will "fix" anything g other than putting themselves ahead a bit for a week. The long term problems will not be fixed or affected either way.  Basically, I think they are saying this opinion for selfish reasons, like a jobless socialist looking for handouts lol
---
&gt;At this point any players that will be staying on the game into the future need to know why.
---
I don't. Please don't try to speak for anyone else but yourself.
---
&gt;The promise of private worlds and mods cannot sustain a community large enough to keep the player counts high and the money flowing.
---
These two things don't factor into my decision to keep playing the game.
---
&gt;There needs to be a livestream with the devs or some sort of direct communication in which the community and the devs can develop a plan together.
---
I'm fine without this, honestly.
---
&gt;Everyone on here has great ideas as to what should be implemented in the game, but the ideas are conflicting and show different visions for 76.
---
I seriously doubt **everyone** here has great ideas.
---
&gt;Telling your players that you are working on something is great, but if we don’t want to play the thing you release, then why bother coding it.
---
Just because you don't want to play something doesn't mean everyone doesn't want to play it.
---
&gt;I think some type of way where the community could vote on things to get implemented into the game could work.
---
You seem to be under the mistaken impression that game development is some sort of democracy. Sure, people can make suggestions, and wise developers take those suggestions into consideration, but it's ultimately Bethesda's decision on what gets implemented and what doesn't.
---
This is one of those rare RPGs where XP isnt shared and i dont see much buzz about it eaither. Warframe has it, Portal Nights as well, even if its in a specific radious, it needs to be implemented.
---
your getting a 160% damage to that revolver once TSE nerf patch happens. your comparing apples to bananas. 
---
You missed a whole bunch of iron nodes at Test Site #3. i posted a video a couple of days ago showing them all. Did not know about the ones up the top of the hill. But there are 7-8 more nodes going down the hillside by the red truck.
---
They do so freely enough as it is 🤣
---
I would love to believe that, but in the pipboy display, when you have rads, your hp is listed as X/Y.  
---
For example my char has a max hp of 310, when i take 20 rads it shows in pipboy as 290/310 when I am "fully healed".  
---
They certainly invested enough resources and money to say otherwise. Quests span the whole map, almost every location has some interesting or noteworthy feature. The amount of holotapes and notes is pretty out there as well.
---
I too have a job, family, and a gym hobby 6d a week. I am level 140 lol. How you play is also important. I ran nuked whitesprings a lot before xp nerfs, with xp perks and items.
---
this guy gets it. 
---
Sounds like a release candidate for Bethesda standards.
---
When I get in the contaminstion shower, I grunt because I dropped the soap...
---
There is a claw machine with a ppiece of preserved pie. Legend has it that each time you try and get it, you have a very slim chance the machine will grab the plate.
---
Hmm that shouldn’t be right...maybe get a friend to test this out with for clarity
---
&gt; while I can’t spoil any details just yet, I will say that Survival mode won't be the only new content coming to Fallout 76 in March, so stay tuned! 
---
This strongly reminds me how Diablo Immortal was announced
---
Not sure what you’re talking about. I have a quad western revolver and it reloads in the exact same amount of time as a normal revolver.
---
Which is especially hilarious, as the player clearly puts 6 rounds into a gun that then has 24 to shoot
---
Even so, you have to have the guy needing the exp to go up front in the mob even if the character is squishy. Where as others are meant to be front line more so than others. Like for instance, if you have a stealth sniper, their fire rate is typically really low and they arent meant for front lines.
---
We need a way to display our preserved pie.
---
If they would put a dog as a companion on the atomshop my guess is it would be the top selling item by far but still I love my pink princess bed with my fish lamp right beside it
---
o wow the weapon you haven't spec'd into did no damage against a high armor lvl 91 death claw?... WHO WOULD OF THOUGHT?! 
---
I am not sure l can see a difference.  And my experience with other elements of the game seem to indicate that the effects on enemies are not affected by what I see or hear.  All the stealth mechanics are complex, so I am hesitant to make an interpretation without objective data on mob behavior.  Or perhaps data mining.  I have not seen anyone present those yet.
---
I love this game enough to take it, or at least do some consulting.
---
If you are transparent about all of the mechanics it creates a situation where if things aren't well balanced, you find everyone doing the same thing and the game feels very one dimensional.  
---
By not revealing the numbers, many more options become "viable" because you don't realize what you're doing is not as effective as other options.  You have people valuing all sorts of weapons, armor and legendary affixes.
---
alas, all my friends have given up on this game. No one to help me test, hence the reddit inquiry.  All our debate is over discord now.
---
Its a major change for me who also carries a bunch of the specific aid that aren't currently being reduced.
---
"Simple" solution...
---
I'll be glad when pacifist mode stops camp defense from damaging players and players no longer able to damage camp.  That day will be GLORIOUS!
---
This might be one of the most amazing things I have ever seen on Reddit. I used to lead orientation training at my work with one of my best friends and out of nowhere he once said something like, "Forgetting your badge and getting locked out of the building is clownshoes. Don't do it."
---
I asked him later where he heard that expression and he said he didn't it just was the first thing that came to his head and we laughed about how he was just making up expressions in-front of impressionable kids fresh out of college.
---
Then I see this here. I am overcome with happiness and joy to see it out in the wild. Thank you kind person.
---
No, you lie.  Add me today on PC, DestaZalinto, and I will force your ass to grind legendary items with me at Wes Tek for 3 hours.   Tired of y'all's bullshit lol.  You ain't even trying if you've never seen the weapons drop.  Come.
---
What is the max Furious and how do you get there?
---
The only problem I see with this is that dupers won't want to part with their stuff and will just stay in Adventure griefing.
---
I pick a direction and walk until I find an undiscovered place and will usually bounce around to other undiscovered places from there. Don’t think this will hold up much longer, but it gets me to see parts of the map that aren’t connected to the main quest lines.
---
Thanks for the old info I'm aware Bethesda said @E3 they would do mod supported private servers and that may take up to a year. (They also made other claims which have yet to materialize) now Why would I want to pay a monthly premium for a private server just for mods when I could pay $60 once and run mods indefinitely. Sorry I had to pull you away from your glass table porn livestream long enough to write that garbage. I think I hear your mom calling you better hide that browser tab.
---
I swear, Grahm and Chally are my favorite things in the game as a whole. It's the only time I've actually busted out laughing at something that was not a glitch. More Grahm! More Chally! He is a feature that makes the world seem alive more than any other single element does. When I find him, I travel with them a ways, and I know others do too--at one point we had five people basically roaming together with him.
---
This, Bethesda, is emergent gameplay. It's one of those things you wanted to achieve, so I hope you'll build on it. 
---
yes
---
Are you sure you havnt got the chameleon mutation?
---
It does get a bit ranty, but this was all written in one take over about an hour. Thanks for the feedback and contribution.
---
I don't think private servers are too practical, or dedicated servers either. Your server may have low population all the time too. I dont think it would be a worthwhile feature. The game should instead have a function to search for a server your camp will spawn in 100% of the time.
---
I disagree - it allows you to customize your play style.  I have three tanks of thru hiker but no traveling Pharmacy.  I get a lot of bonuses from food but have to run from combat sometimes because I can’t carry many Stimpaks. 
---
I like that combat isn’t the only element of play style - it makes sense that you should have to spend some of your development on mon combat abilities to be effective.
---
You, thinking that is a finished house. I'm simply pointing out that your CAMP lacks many of the "essentials" of a house and throwing up a few pictures in a room that only has a couple tables and chairs doesn't count as decorating. Sorry if I offended you. But those floors offended me lol.
---
Yeah I definitely don't get it especially because I'm sure there will still be easily exploitable things in game once this comes out so there's no way that fresh start stays fresh very long
---
Fallout has been part of my life for over 20 years. One of my first video game loves to be honest. I really do love the world they've created, and I want it to be fun to spend even more time there.
---
(Shhh!)  ;)
---
Which perks do you like?  Is One Man Army useful at all?  I cannot tell if the effect is per flechette?
---
I just built my camp on top of a tent with a radio, a chem stash, and nicely stacked wood outside it. I try to be careful stepping around the bodies....
---
Never argued the design mate, just telling people how to use what we have.
---
No way Jose!  He puts one bullet in at time.  He opens the little hatch, one in, spin, one in, spin etc.  So funny. But frustratingly unusable in a fight.
---
If you are PS4 I will buy it from you once you are done
---
This has happened to me twice, but only on the one that spawns near the "Steak House" in Cranberry Bog with all the Super Mutants. Every other Census Violence event I go to works just fine. 
---
I figured I’d missed with my first shot, so I ripped off 2 more to be sure. Imagine my shock that mini nukes had no effect... luckily I had other, less sexy, tools to deal with that glowing fucker
---
I hope so, for the sake of the game.  Will firm numbers ever be available?
---
I play on PS4 and it happened to me 3 times last night.
---
Me and a couple friends decided to launch a nuke on white springs as well.
---
We went through a good amount of bullets and stimpacks getting the nuke launched. 
---
Right as we travel to white springs and start shooting at a couple glowing ones the game server crashed.
---
Not only that but once we tried getting back on and doing this on another server we were all getting blue screened or disconnected from the server!
---
Waisted 3 nuke cards, ammo, and stimpacks for nothing...
---
Yes you can rank up cards past level 50. You can also unlock cards you've ranked up to the highest point, and have them at a lower rank again.
---
Yeah I know. How delusional are they to think this will change anything?  Also what's with them bringing up TSE so much when the nerf has been confirmed already? Lol
---
Totally jelly of my sons Fortnight holiday events.  And game balance.  
---
Omg that property annoys the shit outta me too. I shouldn't have to leave gun completely as is just to actually get the Perk's proper effect 🤦total bullshit imo
---
I will just assume that you have never done any nuclear biological or chemical a decontamination. It's very painful.
---
For myself I tested it in my camp, the wood grain on my floors was visibly distorted less through my character when stacking pieces. I was in third person using the pipboy view that allows you to see your character when changing gear; the distortion of the floors visibly changed as I added and removed pieces.
---
As for affecting pve, I dont known the implications. For pvp it does make the cloaked player more difficult to see (although not 100% invisible)
---
I personally had 2 players using 2 shot explosive shot guns both firing at me with passive mode on and I did NOT get one shotted.  (They pumped a full clip each at me multiple times btw.)
---
Context is King.  There are other reasons why someone gets one shotted and usually it's  due not knowing the mechanics that flag you for pvp.
---
Keep thinking oh I'll just come back when pve gets ironed out with new stuff...at this rate, not sure when I'll be back.
---
Holiday skin pack, 76000 Atoms.
---
I'd buy it if it was F2P.
---
Do you have targeting hud? That seems to be giving ps4 users random crashes. 
---
It won't be any different in that aspect either. There are still dupe glitches so dupers will just dupe on there...or did that little fact slip by your train of thought?
---
I have eight of them right now.
---
Yeah a road map would be cool or like an apology from them for just using their name and releasing a totally buggy DC filled shit show. This engine can't take it and it shows. Seems like they just threw together some stuff and let it roll. What's the worst it could be I'm sure they said. Well this is the worst game I've played in a long time but it's fun. 
---
You know i had the same problem, and you know, im actually afrair it might be a new glitch/hack where one person can take all of the loot. I know it sounds crazy, but i wouldnt put it past the people that decide to hack.
---
Your assumption would be correct...... Good to know.... I will try to avoid.
---
Pretty sure pvp mode is what you are getting INSTEAD of stable servers.  
---
Ps4 im afraid, i have grinded for these items for uncounted hours since launch in many many places and nuke zones. The best I have ever come up with is 1 assassin gear and two assassin weapons, I have never encountered any tse or sentinel or cavalier at all in game 
---
Ding!  Upvoted 
---
Uhh, I love my flaming shishkebab.
---
Im still confused. I'll just wait until player vending machines. I wish it were somple, like dome other games have done.
---
You should join the reddit discord. Most sbq i Run Or join Haß like 10+ Players joining in and helping. It goes down pretty fast.
---
\^ This.
---
Amen! This needs to be a feature.
---
It is bullshit. Which means it probably isn't a bug, and is a feature. 
---
😠
---
Just because I don’t pvp doesn’t mean I don’t pay attention. Lmao
---
The OP wants to put constraints on pvp, I say no. Hell No.
---
Player vs player is what it’s really all about.
---
Combat in its purest form.
---
You run with what you got. 
---
Don’t have TSE? grind till you do.
---
Open this bitch up. Get all you pvp pukes off the pve servers. Let the pve pacifists and lowbies play
---
Unmolested.
---
you can complain about how pay to win may hurt gaming but historically technology has made a big impact in historical combat. Why shouldn’t this apply to gaming?
---
Why should folks who have technically advanced weapons be restrained against folks who don’t, when the conscience decision for all pvp combatants, was already made?
---
Stop your whining.
---
Get to grinding.
---
Runescape is almost turn based though, the combat is nothing even close to a shooting game.
---
The funny thing is, it was in FO4. If you had the Penetrator perk, and enemies were lined up, you could actually damage multiple at once
---
Found it! Thanks. Jeez would have never noticed that!
---
I loved mine too. Then I found a weapon that was just straight up better, so I put it in my stash. Eventually I needed the space, and it ended up in a bag at the watoga train station.
---
It doesn’t have the wood extractor sites though - which saddens me.
---
Ah. My apologies. I’m on PC.
---
i don't buy too many (maybe 5or6) mostly I am looking in shelves and corners of buildings. I would say stop rushing into a building and going straight for the quest and leaving. Search the building. Lately now in my 40's I've been getting plans from NPC kills.
---
Here's a clip, not mine though.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6tHMWM-3-M&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6tHMWM-3-M&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
I thought about that, but my concern was that you’d end up with too few players in each faction.  Maybe there could be sub-faction you could earn points within the main ones.
---
Responders-fire breathers, vaulttec
---
Bos- enclave, free states
---
Raiders- gourmand, and what not 
---
This is bad ass
---
I will fully support this recommendation if I can login as Phoenix the vendor bot.
---
Showing everyone's bases would be a bad idea. Getting a low level alt into a faction would allow you to find someone's base to go blow it up on your main character.
---
Otherwise, yea. Perks and bonuses based on factions would be great.
---
Maybe if we had freaking text chat like every other freaking game it wouldn't be do damn difficult.
---
Because if that were going to be the solution they could and would have done that already. If inventory wiping was the solution they would do that sooner rather than later. They may decide to force a new character at a later date but the lack of insight speaks volumes. They are lost and they are months behind. 
---
Sweet glad I could help
---
Yesterday a lower level invited me to a party, flashed a lot of trade emotes to everyone. Then he came directly to me when i was in my camp.. Which is fine but when i say No to the trade he start acting like a child, shooting me and my stuff to get my attention and gave me angry emotes.
---
Ended up with changing the door-wall to a simple wall.
---
I get fewer server drops, but many many many more CTDs.  Net worse.
---
I am going to try playing without my HUD and see if that helps.
---
Thanks for fixing a bug that shouldn't have been there on release and thanks for a quality of life update that should have been there on release that a mod maker was able to do before your AAA company.
---
While I’m not totally sure about that, it DOES have a deliberate accuracy nerf. Whether they achieved that by removing bonuses, or just by applying a -50% accuracy to the second bullet (which is what I suspect), it is deliberate. It’s the extra recoil from the double shot. 
---
Everyone has passive night time healing this week. 
---
Ho-ly shit man! Thanks for commenting, I hadn't even heard of it...but it looks SICK!
---
In my group of about 15, most people haven’t bought atoms. A couple bought a small amount and one player bought $50 worth. All of us have played since release. The one who bought $50 loves the fruit hat that so many people in this sub hated on lol.
---
Atom shop items
---
I use my ghoul slaying mirv fatman all the time, and tru to keep 6 or 7 nukes on hand. Its great for large groups of shit when i dont want to just tes everything. Mine does 300 dmg per mirv charge. 
---
MissI'll le launchers suck, dont use that.
---
Auto nade launchers are fun af, if you are accurate with your lobs.
---
A PvP mode would be nothing other than a one shot snipe fest unless they nerfed them into irrelevancy then Handmades/Combat Rifles/Assault Rifles would be king with maybe the auto GL for instagibbing people in PA.
---
No clue were I got my first few. But I have like 30 patches around my camp and havn't ever ran out and never have to farm for them. 
---
I think it has to do with how they implemented it. The perks &amp; the legendary armor weight reducing properties (weapons, aid, junk, etc.) apply their Weight Reduction to whatever you have on you.
---
Whereas the 90% Reduced Weight weapon property seems to apply only at the exact moment the item spawns, altering the item's actual base stats, so when modding it later it doesn't get applied to the new mods.
---
Sure. If you want your game to look and feel like something made in 1992.
---
Kurt Cobaine CoBanged his Kurt CoBrain
---
That's where the adapt part comes in. If you snipe mainly, you're not going to hit all your targets by taking time to line up. Spray and pray works best for Hits-to-XP. You just gotta use cover if you're squishy, it's a risk you have to take. I run an adrenal reaction mutation build now, and that is the essence of squishy. I have 350 HP. All but 40 is rads. You get one hit by most anything. 
---
You always get card packs every 5 levels just like before so you might get lucky and pull a few pistol cards.
---
Yeah, as time goes on you definitely don't need it anymore, but it's great when you're a mid-level. It would be sad times if they removed them from the game is all I'm saying.
---
No fireproof perks or sentinel/assassin armour, not sure what defense perks. I tried this with a couple of other friends too (I'm guessing they all have different perks) and it was the same with all of them, could only do a small amount of damage.. I don't think it was ever more than 5 damage. Tried shooting at the floor, off walls, direct in the face - nothing worked. 
---
I'm not saying that people aren't being one shot in pacifist mode, but I don't think bobbleheads stacking is the method. Like the OP said, there could be a different way. 
---
&gt;Furious Missile Launcher 
---
Amazing 😂
---
PLer would love to be able to afk alts and level them.  I think taging isn't too hard to do.
---
https://www.reddit.com/user/atomicshop
---
You make some good points, but the fact that you don't know what constitutes a heavy weapon makes me think you are just being lazy with your reasoning (unless it was just an example?). It doesn't take a bunch of research to determine weapon classes, just equip any perk for the class and look at the weapon stat. Of all the deduction required to figure out game mechanics, this is _far_ from an actual impediment to  the game.
---
Like, I agree with this argument overall, but your contention makes it seem like you'll complain over anything and hurts the overall point.
---
Well, I can at least say I wasn't using ultracite ammo.  From what I've seen, it'd need a bigger boost in damage for me to consider grinding for it.    
---
It's important to remember that the SBQ's health scales with the number of players present.  That's not an issue if all 10 players are doing serious damage or otherwise positively contributing to the fight.  When you have lowbie leechers or poorly equipped players showing up for that fight, they're going to make it significantly harder for everyone.
---
Has Bethesda addressed this at all? I’ve slowly stopped keeping up with updates on the game. 
---
I didn't say remove them, I said to make them better so people can use them more!
---
Everywhere and yet... Nowhere.
---
Like everything else? Have you seen the Social-Recents list? I have no clue how they sort it. My best guess is numerically by internal player ID. 
---
So it should be an easy fix by devs. So, maybe April's patch? 
---
Hehehe.
---
As far as the plans, Its already coming. Take a look at the "Inside the Vault" update from yesterday. 
---
You keep mentioning "behind" as if your play time / enjoyment of the game is measured against the next persons time spent in game.
---
I camp near that area. 8 Story massive facility. No monsters ever spawn up at my camp however.
---
The two people I played with most during December don’t log in anymore :/
---
I like this.
---
NP friend, sorry they didn't understand or couldn't answer your question :)
---
I am on XBOX.  If you needed something built and your on Xbox I'll pop along.  Generator, Rad shower arch, etc.
---
Yeah. I have a junkie plumber build I’m dying to play but even at mid 30s it’s getting tough to kill things and 1 active chem at a time is super limiting. 
---
Caps are a design choice to slow the intake. Don’t expect that to change. 
---
I’ve probably got 30k caps spread across my alts. Once you get high level, outside of buying gear off other players, there’s less and less to spend them on.
---
I am impressed that non-violents want to try the new system.  I had not expected that.  I look forward to hearing about your collective experiences.
---
Finally someone 
---
Well, Pvp is a solution only for a portion of FO76 players, the ones not interested in pvp will still have no content.
---
If you put TSE aside, you still have many ways to kill someone with one or two hits: sneaky build with chameleon (you won't ever see them), melee builds, bloodied/unyelding builds... pick your choice. It will lead to never ending nerfs that will also affect pve player (as, for now, their code base is shared between pvp/pve).
---
Plus, the server barely hold themselves together in pve, I see more and more often hits not registering, lag, disconnections, it's annoying as shit in pve, it will be infuriating in pvp.
---
I don't think the level of pvp experience FO76 is able to deliver (with the limitation of its engine, and the meh balance) will be really interesting to players seeking a good pvp experience.
---
Y'all know this is the whole game, right?  Like the main point of this game was to see if multi-player fallout could be a thing and how to add micro-transactions to turn fallout into a cash cow.
---
Lol wishful thinking but hey, I'm right there wishing alongside you 😁
---
Nope.... you dont get to see my data.
---
See you own I'm ok with.
---
Don’t use them as a main weapon, use them for crowd control, like an alternate to grenades on a heavy/strength build with minigun or such as a main weapon.
---
I was just playing around with auto 40mm on my grenades/pistol build. Every bit as effective as frag grenades with the added bonus of exploding on hit and not rolling around.
---
I don’t remember if ordinance express affects the weight of the ammo but if you’ve got a heavy build you already have most of the relevant perks. 
---
I still think they need to examine damage and maybe introduce perk cards that mitigate some of those insta deaths. Otherwise it will just be the have's and have not's as far as gear goes. Honestly the best idea is probably to have everyone start at level 1.
---
I agree. I will be playing Anthem, Outer Worlds and Metro in the coming months - 76 will definitely lose my attention for a while until there is more end game.
---
where did you get the bathrobe? i need one for when im afk at my base playing the banjo with the monster mask. ( i have loads of people that wonder in all the time, itd be great)
---
I throw missile launchers and their ammo away like they are trash.
---
Don’t forget if you own the workshop you can always put the rug down that marks the spot you will fast travel to for that workshop. 
---
Put down rug, spawn on rug. It’s nice. (it’s in misc or floor decor, forgot which one.(
---
I'm in the exact scenario. Be wary though, I've lost some decent gear by having the paper bag disappear instead of landing on the ground.
---
Like kindred, tormented, angered spirits. 
---
One day! 
---
They don't know what they are doing and have no solid plan, thus they cannot share that info. The no clip doc said as much.
---
You 100% sure you’re using the right purifier? I have all 3, the smalls go to 2, the mediums go to 3, the larges go to 5
---
Absolutely support this.  There cannot be any crossover otherwise the whole point is ruined.
---
By the way, you should also drop everything on death, increase the stash limit, remove legendaries entirely from survival and then rebalance PvP properly.  If you can do all that, I'll play survival.
---
I do believe that 300+ hours of getting your vear should get you fully geared. My enjoyment of the game increased by a lot when I bought my first TSE being a level 140 character. Its just an environment we're all sharing, and whether somebody likes it or not, the dedicated PvPers will be decimating the nice folks from r/filthycasual. What did dupers do, actually, was to level the field for everybody so that not only selected few people run with a gear thats not shitty. I do hope that duping is fixed completely and that new tier of weapons (more stars) will be released in the future, but I just cannot see any argument that could hold any scrutiny in a sentence that this game is broken because of dupers.
---
Dupers aint the source of the problem. The problem is that in crafting-based game you are only allowed to craft shit.
---
I have Bear Arms and use a two shot fat man instead of grenades.  Fun, pretty and effective.  Grenadier makes for a really big area.  Also, recently I have started to suspect One Gun Army is getting in on the action somehow, because a lot of targets hit by this seem to lose the ability to run.  More testing is needed.
---
So I love my mini nukes.
---
Pretty sure it says in the article that you won't be engaged in PvP during events
---
I would ask why, because its technically boosting. Just revive players through events or group up with low levels. 
---
It says "Weapons that could be removed from the game completely and no one would be too bothered" and then goes on to list the  shishkebab.
---
It's a bug, people laugh it off as clumsy fingers but too many have their equipped weapon magically drop while fighting. But what do I know.
---
Multiplayer like Destiny with single player expansions but endgame is PvP and raids I think I would work with the fanbase.   Fallout Battle Royale, not so much.
---
&gt; If they make it where everyone starts from scratch and only allow transfers from Survival to Adventure as some are calling for, then it might actually be fun, at least for a while, even for solo players.
---
Add to that possibly a server-matching system that makes you play with people in your level range. Even after starting new you'll have plenty of level 100s in the first week and hunting new players.
---
As I said I did? Just making excuses then accusing me of lying? Quality individual...
---
Last time I went to use one of my supply drop holotapes, they were at the top of the list.  I tend to only keep those and the Overseer ones on me, so that might have contributed.
---
The regular blade does 100% buy the furious does 100%+ the problem is that there is no concrete data on how much more a Furious weapon can do over the base. Your experiment proves that there is indeed a cap but without knowing the baseline I cannot do the math to figure out how much it adds.
---
Please tell me this is posted on Bethesda's forums....
---
So marsupial gets you pretty high, at the arc of your jump, tap the jetpack jets and boom, you go even higher, tap again, higher, etc. You are now flying!!! Cliffs, sky scrapers, and other areas you never thought you could get to, you now can!
---
Yesterday I found a secret back door entrance to a mine that I never knew existed. It just is a new way to have fun and explore. Gives you also new challenges for flight distances. :)
---
New doors and hats?! Huzzah!
---
I disagree on several points, we do need a new mode.. I dont need padded walls and hand holding throughout the game.. I dont want to be forced to play with anti PVP ppl as it's really immersion breaking to shoot ppl and have them fast travel away or jus block you.. heavy weapons do feel heavy, pull one out n go sprinting.. you will move slow.. theres potential for this game but I fear everyone wants it to be easier with more op weapons and more legendary effects.. does no one like a real challenge any more?? 
---
i've seen enough of him lately that i'm pretty sure he's just a troll account.
---
It absolutely is true. It happened to me. They took my Vault suit that I was wearing at the time and a low level plain 2 shot western revolver that I also had equipped. You can believe it or not, I KNOW that it can and did happen to me. And I'm 56 years old, not some young punk looking for attention. I've been gaming since there have been games. I also made a career out of fixing arcade video games, pinball machines, juke boxes and all manner of boardwalk games. I am an electronic tech/electronic engineer by trade and even did a little programming back in the day. My credentials stand as a testament to my knowledge of games and gaming and the trade glitch/bug/cheat/exploit was real. It may not be now after 3-4 patches. 
---
Although i don’t like the idea of boosting your pals (i don’t by know why tho). 
---
The rate of people joining my team has been slim since day one (xbox). 
---
In the early days I’d have loved some free fast travel points - and in exchange for them gaining from my xp it’d be a fair trade. 
---
Does eg warcraft share xp (all of it)
---
Usually what I do is mind my own business until somebody randomly launches a nuke, but thanks for the info! I might take a look :) 
---
I'm just glad I'm not the only who thinks this outrage is a little blown out of proportion. I just think people are saying that the other flaws in the game mean that you shouldn't transfer characters but that seems like a fallacy we should just get to the root of the problems and fix that.
---
I replied in here already that my concern was with too many factions you wouldn’t have enough allies so some factions could be sub-factions.  It’s Bethesda so everyone has some moral ambiguity but I basically grouped them collectivist, individualist, and chaotic.  It’s kind of tricky where everyone would end up.  BoS is individual because they reject all other authorities, responders are obviously collectivist, and raiders are chaotic.  With the others it’s a bit tricky but here goes:
---
Collectivist- fire breathers, enclave?, vault etc?
---
Individual- mistress of mystery (never revealed themselves), free states
---
Chaotic-all the raider factions
---
I have a two shot as well. Furious works with the rocket launcher just an FYI once you get the QUAD mod for 4 shots. 
---
tried to add you but cant because of your settings
---
I’d say furious, on a minigun. Stacks to 30% real quick, and combines well with Stabilized. From what I’ve heard anti-armor is worth about 28% more damage if you have zero other armor penetration effects, and less effective if you do? 
---
I’m level 91, I don’t need to be boosted It’s  just because I want the trophy. Whenever I try to invite someone to a team they usually decline 
---
An area of effect for the exp wouldnt be so bad though. So they would have to stay in so many meters of teammates or in said area to gain from it. Im not saying they can just afk at their camp/vault by any means and gain from it.
---
What’s your PSN
---
&gt; Do the solo players just get stomped on and then avoid this mode?.
---
yes.
---
As long as there’s a brief window after respawn where you can’t inflict or receive damage. Otherwise spawn camping at 76 will be rampant and you’ll die before you can even move. Or if they find your camp, same thing. 
---
Comforting because this Reddit makes me sick sometimes with the stuff on "top" lol
---
The mods you learn from breaking weapons down are random. You can build and break down weapons to learn more mod recipes. 
---
Be sure to check overseers stashes like the ones at Flatwoods and Overseers as Well as Suitcases and containers at train stations. Many of us leave stuff in them.
---
Bethesda is trying *so hard* to be Fortnite.
---
FFS
---
That's why I said drop ammo. People typically drop a single worthless item first, so a bag spawns. THEN they transfer their items. Thank you, for the warning, though.
---
I’d say that specifically on a minigun due to how many bullets you use on most enemies and how fast you fire; on something like a Gatling gun that is high damage-low ROF, Furious would only be worthwhile against big enemies like SB/Q, mirelurk queen. 
---
Hopefully in the next update there will be more "stability" improvements.
---
It's been addressed that launching 3 nukes in a single server causes this issues as well, but it seems that after these "updates" it's only been getting worst...
---
This is the real answer. Easy to implement, so we can still use cosmetics, but functional as actual armor.
---
Nope I meant would of
---
Maybe if a revolver has a single-bullet load mechanic (like the lever action rifle or pump action shotgun does) it has to load 1 at a time. But I promise you, on my quad western revolver the reload animation and time it takes is identical to normal
---
Thx
---
Yeah, and the problem is that the crap always seems to rise to the top.
---

There is zero point in responding to threads if they are going to be canned PR bullshit like this.
---
Say something of substance, or just don't reply.
---
Its not so much boosting as it is not competing with your friends over kills. I find my self kiting enemies for friends to help them get a hit in. It just seems unnecessary to do just for party exp.
---
Your entire argument is based off of an economy that wouldn't exist if there was only one of each item, is all I mean. Think it through, how much of the god tier stuff you use did you actually find yourself? Also, people aren't going to be as likely to trade items since they will inherently be more valuable to the person who found it (will only trade it for an upgrade or similar item).
---
I don't know about you, but in 300 hours of play I've found one TSE, 0 sentinel, and 0 cavalier
---
My two friends and I have already agreed to pay for a private server if we get the option. Permanent buildings would be worth 50 to 100 bucks a month from us, easily 
---
Yeah i always stack weapons and scrap them. Wasnt aware its random 
---
True, and if they really can't for some technical reasons just tell us
---
Thank nice to know more people can relate to how I describe. 
---
What, exactly, does that have to do with the price of tea in China?
---
Its irrelevant. My sweatshirts aren't some gimmic thrown in at the last minute with a pre-order (which, let's face it, are never worth the time of day). 
---
Sounds like you’re volunteering for the free states faction.  ;)
---
I'm not saying you don't have any good points, but:
---
It took you weeks to find "the perfect defensive camp spot" You simply go there and build again. Why would it take you weeks to refind the same spot?
---
Was more confused as to +200 on the excavator than anything.  
---
Bounties are pointless in survival. It’s full PVP all the time, what’s the point of bounty system? Shouldn’t be one. And I second ZERO player icons on map (I’m on the fence about them on radar with perception. It’s a little wallhacky...)
---
Exactly, there was another good post about addressing the actual issues I saw earlier.  I see quite a few unique posts that share this view, just the downvote army keeps attacking them.  Reddit is a minority, they seem to forget that.  (Or posts about how good the game is would never make the top listings lol)  We unfortunately live in outrage culture, so I think that explains some of the reaction too lol
---
They already said you won't have to start over and I don't imagine they will change their mind
---
What platform are you? I have more than 50 on PS4
---
Yup! I finally got to try mine out to take down a cargobot. I happened to be carrying one and thought 'now is my time!' Only for it to be completely ineffective. I dropped it there and then and have ditched all my missiles. Total waste of carry weight. 
---
Dude this is absolutely sick! Nice work 
---
Do you think there is anything currently wrong with the game or the future plans they have informed us about?
---
And they can use the club penguin system of filtering 'bad' words so people can't use it as an excuse to be offensive or bigotted
---
Dude, a roadmap would indicate that the Developer of Bethesda would have a clue what to do with this pile of code.
---
As long as you can also respawn at your camp, I think it’s fine to have the choice. What if they gank you in your camp? Don’t want to respawn there... of course if they have a team, with 1+ attacking you at camp and another 1+ at 76, you would be in trouble. 
---
Could =\= should. It's part of a larger discussion about why grinding legendaries is so tedious. 75% of weapons are trash as soon as they drop because the base weapon is drastically inferior.
---
During events pvp will be temporally disabled. However the instant the event is over pvp status resumes.
---
No, the world/server is still out there and if you are on the same team...you hit play with team and spawn back.
---
There are black titanium nodes in Welch among the broken asphalt.  I was stunned when I saw them, because I hadn’t seen them the first several trips.  Very hard to spot.  Excavator armor mines 4 per click.
---
Uff, thanks god! 
---
Yeah I read though I'm confused as to if you have calibrated shocks on the excavator armor or not as well?  Because that would give it +200 total.  On phone so didn't read all comments.  Maybe was said lol
---
Thanks, i was getting scared
---
Totally agree. I like buying stuff off of him, but I didn’t realize how funny he was until the last time I came across him. I followed him for awhile just listening to what he was saying. He was listing all the meats he likes and I just kept following. 
---
This is a horrible idea to focus on this first. Add real content to the game first, not just PVP. Does anyone even want a dedicated PVP mode for this game?
---
People assume item dupers or they for whatever reason after all the shit they've pulled, people still want to defend them.
---
I’ve only been in disconnects where it drops me and not my friend. Or him and not me. We’ve never both been disconnected at the same time 
---
That's the way to do it. Make armored head pieces 'under layer' like the Vault Suit, and cosmetic items go on top (aka visually replace them)
---
Yes! 
---
Problem is Bethesda currently has no way to detect duped items. 
---
I agree with above. I do love the improvised/musical instruments though. I would love them more if they were balanced closer to the BiS weapons or gave a lesser form of In Tune following long-term usage. 
---
Even those cheap phone earbuds with a mic will work. I have had to use them a couple of times for different reasons. Just throwing that out there. 
---
I’m definitely one of those builder types!  Half the time I got so caught up building that I never finished the story.  Bah, my son can wait, I’m busy building a factory to make giddy up buttercups!
---
Yeah I'm gonna laugh when they launch this in a month and there's a grand total if 500 that log onto it. 
---
Plus Super mutants will drop gun powder as well.
---
Honestly that sounds fun. Lol but the thing im getting at is, some people dont have that type playstyle. I get CQC is inevitable but you shouldnt have to compete for exp if someone excels much more than you do in cqc. I giess what im getting at, is that if youre playstyle is to be a long range support, you should have to be frontlines to keep up with everyone and not left behind due to the loss in exp. Or if youre a front line melee build, you shouldnt have to try and punch/smash everything and let your commando/snipers try and not kill everything before you can hit it.
---
That's a really cool idea!
---
At that point they would just remove duped items. It would be better to be a separate character entirely, since everyone would start on even ground and you wouldn't be able to farm stuff on a normal server then use those things on a pvp server
---
I do know for instance that my double pump action shotgun does have to load all 16 rounds individually. Must depend on the reload mechanic
---
Edit to note that my theory bares this out, the single action revolver is the only revolver that actually loads a single round at a time.  If you get a quad .44 or western revolver, I promise you it is not the same and you can load 24 rounds in exactly the same time as a regular one does 6
---
1. Move a Point from INT to STR
---
2. Move a Point from INT to END
---
3. Spend 3 levels getting Class freak Maxed
---
4. Get Egg head mutation (+6 INT, -1STR and END)
---
In 5 levels, which can be done in 1-2 days, you get a +4 SPECIAL stat. So where's the drawback, other than spending a little bit of time?
---
Pretty sure if they had a test like that they could just run it on everyone now already to remove the duped items 🤣 but I do like your idea in general, it would help clean up the economy while still allowing us to go back and forth between servers. I just don't think Beth can pull it off sadly.
---
In the game there are bobbleheads, which give different effects temporarily. Some of these are bugged so that if you use them over and over, the effects add together instead of being replaced.
---
For example, there is a bobblehead that provides 30% increase in explosive damage. If my weapon does 100 explosive damage, each time I use a bobblehead it adds 30% of the base 100 explosive damage - so 30 each use. 
---
As bobbleheads are fairly rare within the game, this wouldn't be such an issue. However, currently the Curator perk card is also bugged. For some reason when using this perk card, everytime you log in and out of a server it resets the timer for the bobblehead effect (they normally give 1 hour of effects) and so you can keep the effect forever, stacking the damage bonus more and more. 
---
More obviously, people duplicating items have literally hundreds and thousands of bobbleheads and can use so many that it gives insane damage numbers. 
---
Many people on Reddit claim that this means you could be killed in a single shot, even with pacifist mode on - due to the high damage. I know multiple people that have duplicated and they gave me literally 5000 bobbleheads. It crashed my game after using 3000. 
---
I wanted to test it, see if it was true and post the results. That is what you watched in my video.
---
Can you not make all the time my friends and I spent on our characters be for nothing...
---
We don't mind that people are calling for no items being transferred but making all the time we spent on our 
---
characters be invalid based on this thread would be devastating to the point we'd likely quit.
---
People who spent 100's of hours to achieve 200+ and 300+ really have ZERO desire to re level alts for a new mode. 
---
Gotcha, I stated the same as you, but thought they had already nerfed it to that 25% instead of 100%. That’s what I attempted to correct you on. My bad! 
---
I don't have a PS4 so I can't speak to their customer service experience. However on Xbox I've had a game with technical issues before, and I was able to get a refund. I called up support, was very polite, and asked for a refund for technical issues. I listed off all the issues I was having, apparently other people were experiencing the same thing, and in short order they issued me a refund. 
---
If you do contact Sony to try and get a refund, I would just use the littany of issues with this game as reasons.
---
An easy way to fix it would likely be to buff the boosts that perks give you to missile and explosive damage.
---
It’s been two months and the only thing they have detailed to us is that they are flipping a few switches and calling it a new game mode. I honestly wonder how long they have been working on that genius idea. 
---
Seeeee...I feel like that is kinda emblematic of how much an aberration the reddit community is. Most people playing this game don't "farm" anything or know an efficient way to farm xp, they're just logging in for a few hours and doing a few quests/discovering a few new locations.
---
Just doing that, takes a long time to get high-level. *Maybe* they're taking the time to be well-rested/well-tuned and *maybe* they picked up an xp perk here and there, but they're def not pounding down cranberry relish or anything. I mean...they may not even have PA or a rad suit to do nuke zones! I haven't done one and it took me doing Poseidon a bunch of times for the Fusion generator plan to finally get a rad suit spawned for me. :(
---
I like the surprise element your suggesting but feel this would open the flood gates for the griefers that would take the opportunity to abuse it. 
---
Why wouldnt I?
---
Gah all this makes me think of is Space Cake Clown Shoes. Now I want a beer
---
It's fairly rare to get hard numbers on online games int he past like, decade, so likely not unfortunately.
---
Id rather die to a person I know started fresh and worked his way up than get insta-gibbed by someone who could have thousands of duped bobbleheads and weapons. 
---
I agree, they’ll have to do something to mitigate that. Vault 76/fast travel points could just be neutral zones up to a certain radius. 
---
Another idea would be to randomize the fast travel points. Whenever you join a server you get individual random fast travel points, one in each map region. Maybe still make Vault 76 a neutral zone. 
---
They had premades in Fallout 4. This would make sense
---
aaaand I now have a new sub to lurk
---
I think this is in the Advertisement Posters pack. I have been looking for this one as well; I believe it is found by claiming/defending workshops, and occasionally at Watoga Vendor and Vendor Phoenix. (I’ve read people have had luck at the Top of the World vendor as well. Believe his name is Resin? He’s inside the resort.)
---
Conan Exiles pulled this off fairly well I thought, I enjoyed private servers a lot. 
---
I'm actually surprised Holotapes aren't classified under Voices.
---
If you are looking for basic building supplies, fast travel to V76 and off road it to the overseers camp, picking every log and killing all the scorched you encounter. Then head to flatwoods doing the same and ransack the place. Break everything down at the red rocket and head towards Sutton, again looting trees and scorched for their steel weapons. Follow the tracks north to Morgantown and ransack the place. 
---
You should now have well over 300 wood and steel plus a bunch of other crafting materials.
---
Oh. And there are 3 or 4 bags of cement in the cemetary north of the nuka cola plant.
---
It not only auto-powers the core generator, it provides 400 power to the junction boxes, so you can power up anything you want without wasting resources or build budget on generators.
---
do you use the new fireproof perk to reduce damage by 45%?  
---
do you have high resistances? 
---
pretty sure my missle launcher hits harder but you gotta build right. 
---
Nah, you should be able to nuke him, spawning Ultra Grahm and his army of zombie moo-moos.  Rarely drops a Grahm tracking holotape.
---
Forcing everyone to use new characters can finally hopefully be the thing that evens out the game again from the scammers and dupers that have already ruined the traditional fo76 economy and  are ruining the game for legimate gamers. Doesn't even make sense to me at all to transfer characters from this buggy Messed up world where everyone has 20 TSE guns and 300k sim packs.
---
Right? you just got shot....in the face...with a shoulder mounted missile launcher. It's okay, you can just walk it off. You should need stimpacks for your broken limbs!
---
So we have to completely respec and waste a dozen card slots to make a nuclear bomb do reasonable damage? You just explained exactly why the Fat Man is broken...
---
uhh, are legendary shishkebabs a thing? I would definitely be excited to find one.
---
Hazmat suit always spawns in the green trailer on roof of Poseidon Plant. ;)
---
Which is exactly the kind of thing that I learned here that most players don't/won't know.
---
The mode this game needs is a proper adventure with Npcs and quests and the ability to play co op. The world is already built. It would take some time but I'm sure Bethesda could do it and have a seperate server for this. I've seen mods go bigger than that on low budgets.
---
At what point will this sub stop blindly defending the actions of these people who are continously murdering our favorite franchise? 
---
I long ran out of ways to defend their actions with this game. And now they are wasting all this time for a pvp mode almost noone wanted, nor was the community consulted over first, something they promised to be better at. 
---
But now they are focusing their resources on this mode which is sure to fail, even if we change their mind about leveled characters in it.
---
You know, instead of all the big things that would make this game better that we have been proposing like a player hub.
---
What's in the cave? I mean is there ore or any scrapping parts people may frequent?  I've only been in mines mostly and I couldn't imagine blocking the front preventing others entering.
---
What level and type of monsters spawn there?
---
It's not wasted dev time at all, and this mode sounds alot more like ark or rust as it has more permanent consequences for death and such. I prob wont be in adventure mode ever again come March. And the gun play in fo76 is actually pretty smooth (some hit boxes are smaller than their model tho). There is no aim assist outside of vats which took me a sec to get used to but I see the point of not having it when we have a computerized aim bot built into us. I finally killed 20 players but it took forever to find em alot of wanted players are op and I couldnt drop em lol. I remember when fo76 was leaked early last year and it was said to be a rust clone and i think this mode it taking it there which I cant be more excited about or hardly wait til March!! 
---
You're comparing apples to bananas. You're comparing one weapon currently to what another weapon will be like after this patch (which so far a firm date hasn't been announced)
---
Whatttttt how?  I will say that Wes Tek seems to have a better quality of drops.  Not sure why but like I'll never find a level 25 legendary at wes Tek and more often than not the drops are Max level and 2* - 3*. Also there are some drop mechanism to keep in mind.  It seems that if a two shot explosive weapon drops, that world had it on the loot table and it can drop again, so DONT LEAVE THAT WORLD.   Just keep hopping around all the spots the could drop. Yes it seems that each world had it's own loot table generated for legendary effects.   But bottom line is, people that have these in adventure mode will end up with them again in a few weeks time.  So making people start over with new toons wont change the problems we have.  That's my opinion.  And base griefers will not migrate over to this server anyway.  Griefing is about making a person cry irl and abusing game mechanics and exploits to do so usually.  
---
Hopefully they will open the Vaults soon. From what we can tell by people who glitched in them, they will be group oriented PvE content where you can do different missions. If they are anything like the quest to launch a Nuke, they will be fun
---
Typos happen. Thanks for bringing it to my attention. It's been corrected to what I originally ment with heading into 3 months.
---
and the fact that the foundation is either to big or to small and just looks wonky as fuck
---
Haha I have a 3 star troubleshooters spear w/ faster swing speed and +1 strength, I love running around watoga like a futuristic Achilles.
---
This is actually a great idea. I’d love to see more emphasis on builds
---
1 cavalier, 1 sentinel, 1 low level cavalier I bought for caps from somebody who didn't knew its value and I am 100% sure its undupped, one bloodied explosive  gattling, I do think right leg I bought is undupped too, I do suspect the right arm I bought might have been dupped at some point.
---
My whole argument is based on the premise that a masterful crafter should output better weapons than a glowing ghoul ever could, and I really see no way of remaing reasonable while saying that  its the way its supposed to be, that glowing ghoul intestines is how you should be getting the best gear.
---
I hate recieving those because they weight way too much and you can't sell them
---
I saw a lvl 250 last night. 250?! Im lvl 55.. sure we only get 50 perk points but jesus christ.. lvl 250?? 
---
Im a casual. And thats just that i guess.  But to see a lvl 250 in survival. Pfft.. 
---
I agree. Fresh rolls.
---
The mechanic might break down if there are too many different factions. 3 would probably balance really well 
---
See this is the problem right here, everyone blaming duped items for causing some kind of in game imbalance, which is simpy not the case.
---
It's to.keep the high level spawns out. Really just some dog food and pipe guns. Nothing worth much, no resources.
---
ok, that sounds awesome. I'm in! (I hope)
---
Here are the next updates https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/1PnLPLl6a8D6gPNWvSVA0Q/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-24-2019
---
New content is costly. Flipping a few switches and calling it a new game mode is relatively inexpensive. Does anyone really believe they are sinking a lot of time and energy into making this game great? Playing whack-a-mole with game breaking bugs is SOP for live gaming so I’m not going to give them a lot of credit for that. 
---
Conan also pulled of base building much better imho
---
No current way, by March they might have if they tried?
---
Hell, move the intern thats working on copying assets from fo4 into an office on there own and make them check them manually if need be!
---
/j btw just in case its needed ;)
---
When you sale something you want back. Exit trade and reopen trade. The item you sold should now be in the vendors inventory. Granted you're probably going to have to pay more than it gave you.
---
I remember those. and even that would be nice I am wanting more of a fully furnished, actual nice house. or the ability for friends to share blueprints would be awesome!
---
Menongah Power plant also has an acid extractor, it just doesnt show it on the map. There's acid, silver, wood and nuclear extractors there as well as the Fusion core generator listed. 
---
I get level 68 mutants and scorched or level 50 wolves and mongrels. Sometimes a ghoul spawn of charred variety.
---
Yeah I know you can do that with teams. I guess I misinterpreted your original meaning. I thought you were saying if you were playing solo you could drop your loot, log back in with an alt, and then pick it up.
---
Agreed I feel like I should be able to one hit a level 30 super mutant with a mini nuke especially being almkst level 50, but it barely gets them to half.
---
I've said this a hundred times and I'll say it again.
---
As far as generosity is concerned the current Atom Shop iteration actually isn't too bad for players. You get a decent amount of atoms from challenges.
---
But... As far as making money for Bethesda? Lol. This cash shop is probably the worst I've seen. The dollar to atom conversation rate is *atrocious.* I'd say a *large* majority of players are just banking free atoms and not buying any.
---
It was just an example, but honestly, as players we shouldn't even have to go to that length. If they're defining different types, they should just label the weapons.
---
I believe you.  I didn't even think of the cylinder type. 
---
I think the same thing whenever I see a Supermutant meat bag. 
---
"Oh, look - there's some fresh Radstag meat in that horrifying chained-together pile of random body parts that is dripping blood and associated yuk all over the floor."
---
Launched a nuke an hour ago, wanted to kill the sbq. Fought for two minutes and then got disconnected.

Check out the faction section in [part 5 of this Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1djsNSmuRLbpNgyZauhhRQPl3lTSKv6NpKvjPbUPSETM/edit?usp=sharing) (not mine). I agree that better faction systems would be awesome.
---
But not by me :)
---
I don’t know how you saw dick and diskette as the same thing you must be gay. Or you must play Xbox. 
---
I would love for crafting to have a time to shine in this game, but my point is that people will be holding onto their good gear since they need it to stay alive and can't be quite as picky as they can be now. It will mostly rely on crafting and self-found stuff (I'm still worried about how the dropping gear on death would work, perhaps they'd just limit it to aid/junk/notes/misc
---
Just look at the weapons you are breaking down and you will see that the learned mod doesn’t necessarily correspond to what was on the weapon you broke down. 
---
Yea I do need to at least take the petty route more often.
---
It’s a choice. You don’t have to carry all the shit you are carrying, but you want to. And so you are given a choice to make carrying it all less problematic, at the cost of other things. Choices and consequences are a fundamental thing. People just don’t like the consequences of the choices they make.

I run a 1str rifleman build and do just fine with 1pt of traveling pharmacy as my only weight reduction perk. 
---
Honestly, AOE doesn't mean much in this game.  Enemies tend to conga line or be spread out/in cover and it's rarely possible to hit more than two enemies (mole men are a notable exception tho).  
---
Which leaves it a pretty bullshit weapon.  The fatman is probably fine, I haven't used it enough to tell, but missile launchers are stupid underpowered.
---
Hmmm I always thought more servers = more cost. 
---
And more changes = more potential bugs. 
---
You are oversimplifying the PvP servers as not costly. 
---
They will require significant dev time and maintenance. 
---
Further, even Bethesda admit it is a big move as they will do a PvP Beta! 
---
If it were cheap and easy, no PvP beta would be required. 
---
My X-01 does, yes. Good looking out. My t-60 has the internal database mod instead.
---
Long grass in Savage Divide needs to be included in this. I made a post about it. 
---
Oh, is it the one with two exits? I have been considering that one, but found another spot I am currently in love with. Very hush hush.  
---
;-) 
---
People who are out of touch with what the people playing the game want. Holier-than-thou highroading is just as irksome, if not more so, than criticizing someones work. You are literally criticizing the person while he was criticizing their work. 
---
Not at all.
---
They're launching the pvp mode instead
---
This is turning into Star Wars Battlefront II. A live service game that didn’t receive updates for over a year straight. 
---
I’m interested in the Decon Shower plans ... don’t have a ton of caps and I’m not sure what the vendors sell them for but would 350 caps be fair?
---
I would love it tbh....would make life loads easier.
---
It is the case though. Duped items have no place in the game or being part of the economy.
---
No one on the new servers wants them there do they? Or do they?
---
It happening naturally over time (months and years) is fine. Cheating to gain an advantage is not. New servers mean a fresh start, so why take the cheats with us?
---
And I'd more included to move once in a while.
---
&gt;Do you think there is anything currently wrong with the game
---
Of course I do. There are many things I wish they would fix. I also think the game is playable and enjoyable in its current state, and I also think Bethesda has been doing a good job at fixing many of the issues that people have complained about.
---
&gt;or the future plans they have informed us about?
---
I am pleased with many of the announced upcoming bug fixes. I think two shot explosive weapons were in need of some balancing, even if I don't agree 100% of the approach they are taking.
---
I really don't care about survival mode, as PVP is not my main focus. I try to avoid interjecting opinions on survival mode, as there's already enough noise on this issue, and it doesn't really affect me.
---
I find Bethesda's current level of communication to be informative and adequate. I think expecting them to inform us of every single thing they plan to change and giving us detailed, long-term plans about the game is both unrealistic given the realities of game development and an entitled stance to take.
---
My goodness I wish I could upvote this a hundred times. Thank you.
---
I have a mirv Fat man and launched like 21 mini nukes at the sbq.  Didnt really do much damage. My tse handmade did far more damage to it
---
I hope so. 
---
Today was the first day I logged in and did nothing but sell items and help some lower levels build their CAMPS. 
---
I will need something more, or time to go to RE2 for awhile. 
---
As in just as everyone is about to loot the sbq. 
---
Honestly, I just keep Pack Rat perk equipped, tagged the mats so I remember which objects I should always loot.
---
Then I just work my way through the side missions and dailies and snatch up the stuff that’s marked as I go. 
---
I also have contractor 2 so I’m not afraid to snatch a workbench at a site with something I’m low on, like that golf course or whatever near the water park for acid. Benches almost always have enough junk in reserve to pay for buildings themselves. Watch the aluminum costs though.
---
I think a serious amount of balancing is coming with  the update for survival and adventure mode with a time frame like this. Atleast I hope so
---
You have to build for a specific weapon to deal damage with it? Seems logical to me. 
---
Its not even alot of perk cards. My bloodied fatman hits for 2000 and all i have is Demo Expert rank 5 and Adrenaline Reaction.... but yeah the Fat Man is broken................... okay. 
---
Now carrying the thing with a bunch of ammo is a different story but its not even that much of a sacrifice. Your just being greedy. 
---
I think to highly of the team.
---
They announced this pvp mode before xmas. Currently it looks like some ini adjustments and it took them over a month to figure it out.
---
And its going to be a beta to boot.
---
Every item Needs an ID stored on creation tying to the person who made it
---
That’s the whole reason I keep an auto grenade launcher in the stash. I keep ending up with 100+ 40mm grenades and they’re weighing me down. I periodically have to get the auto launcher and just run around blasting everything in sight to drain the ammo stock 
---
For you info: don't make stupid assumptions, I will play the mode(but if I have to level up my fourth character, then I won't).
---
Hello, Sorry but i was looking for around 1000 caps for the shower plan
---
Strategy guides have a short shelf life in online games.
---
i approve
---
Thx..this card system is so confusing i leveled up last night and swapped it and then nothing happened lol..i just dont wanna start a whole new character because of the build..i will create a new alt eventually
---
If you don't have a friend just shoot the ground with an explosive weapon near a tin can and see at what distance the explosion moves the can. Grenadier doesn't affect the radius at all. And it's not just visual, i actual tested damage on a friend and the radius in which he receives slight damage is exactly the same.
---
Well, I get what you're explaining, and all I have to really say is: If you don't help kill it, why get rewarded for showing up? Some builds aren't for DPS, some are. But I do agree some group XP should be earned for certain helpful actions.
---
Fast vampire is very nice
---
it is in survival mode where people can kill you nonstop to keep you out of areas
---
Excuse you  many of us do
---
They are. I've found several, and dropped them for things like the obscurely mathed junkies prefix, and the berserkers quality that is diametrically opposed to my tanky frontline medic build.
---
Yeah or different levels of damage inflicted to be eligible for different levels of loot so a hit marker and hide will get you some some ultracite and maybe a stimulating or two as a well done for withstanding all them rads and only if you cause a helpful amount of damage do you start to receive prior plans, weapons and recipes.
---
I thought they were already doing that, did they change it?
---
Because the only humans left just escaped from V76. It would be nice to get some more variety.
---
Honestly, I only tuned into the radio for a brief time when I started the game, heard all the same songs from FO4 and got disappointed and turned it off.
---
It’s a shame it doesn’t work the same way for single action revolver!
---
The reason why we stopped playing fallout 76 is due to all this dumb decisions bethesda has been making, if we want PvP we'll play fortnite. This is fallout in which was a PvE franchise to begin with and has been marketed as such with PvP being an option, in which is highly misleading due to the fact that they even went and took pacifist mode away and for people like me who have real world jobs and tight schedules and dont have the time to grind the best gear and setup my character for PvP it ruins the gameplay. Fallout 76 story line as being vault dwellers and are out to rebuild alongside their fellow vault dwellers are now out the door. Bethesda has now focused on being a wannabe fortnite PvP game that is way too buggy and broken. And even goes as far as rewarding griefers, encouraging and promoting a bad mental health in an online game is just as bad as doing so in reality. Griefers and online bullies need to seek psychological help. Bethesda on the other hand needs to realize that people deal with bad people in real life everyday, so we dont need more of it from a game we have paid for. That to me is not entertaining, in which what a video game is meant to be in the first place. 
---
I've killed three people, one in self defense. They opened fire and I had to protect the massive haul of junk I had on me.
---
The other two were my best friend because he accidentally got a bounty in my camp and we didn't want any problems with bounty hunters.
---
Corporations do bad things for money sometimes. 
---
BGS is a corporation. 
---
Ergo, everything BGS does is evil if I don’t like it and they bought Fallout to ruin it. 
---
It’s just logic. /sarcasm
---
*Urge to quote Dukov intensifies*
---
I hope they do do that already have 3 characters if I have to make another I won’t play it 
---
It's only a Band-Aid. Assuming everybody has to start at level zero, a week later level forties are going to be camping Flatwoods to gank people coming out of the Vault. A week later it'll be north of a hundred doing the ganking.
---
Now that wouldn't be the right moment. Wait till after they have looted her and have moved onto looting the small fry.
---
I think we are a minority, but even so we can all agree that the game crashes and server stability suck just as much for us as all of the others. I can imagine most people stopped playing early on because of how bad it is.
---
Lvl 38 Phoenix is superior to Grahm lvl 50. Phoenix can hold his ground but Grahm gets destroyed facing more then two lvl 50 Watoga bots at the same time.
---
i bought one from the whitespring vendor, didnt care to go find one in the world
---
Its rather boring and you have to reque ever round and it reveals you in a zone.
---
Well im dying in one shot, its probably bobble heads as someone suggested?
---
Both amusement parks have candy/gum drops
---
I feel like the game should have the 'haves' and 'have nots' as that most aptly resembles a real apocalyptic scenario. That being said, some cool things like you drop your weapons on death might be a cool way to allow mobility within this virtual classism youre suggesting.
---
That way if someone ever does kill one of these guys, youve partially become them.
---
That might be my favorite gun in the game. Too bad I’m a light crafter build. I scrapped mine after I finally got through those 50 rounds, kept picking up more so it took a while. Might have been closer to 100 by the time I ran out.
---
The problem is the internet.  If they do a roadmap people will assume that these things are set in stone and are promised to them and anything that falls short of that for any reason will be looked at as being robbed of those things and just give people another reason to be pissed off at the game.  Sometimes things you plan don't work out the way you want them to and you can't put them in the game.  Unfortunately though people would just assume it's due to incompetence by Bethesda and throw a fit over this feature that was stolen from them.  While I would love a roadmap I understand why they don't do this for that reason.
---
But to be fair im saying dmg is broken not TSE only
---
I've got a better piece of advice for Bethesda.
---
Never, ever listen to powergamers when asking for design advice.  They exist to ruin the game mechanics and you will never ever please them.
---
Vaguely mumbling “buchr peet.... he lov tha meet... choppin tha meet... I lov tha meet... butcher grahm...”
---
Incredible post. Give this wastelander a job.
---
Bulldozer needs an update to include the elephant grass an shrubs.
---
Ctd?
---
Someone pointed out it was bobble head stack, not so much a lie but i didnt know
---
So you are upset that their first online game is going to have a PvP mode, of course all their previous games never had a player-versus-player option, they were all single player offline games. Would you prefer people to come and camp your C.A.M.P. and just grief you or go somewhere where they can go to just kill random people in a survival mode? If you want to enjoy your PvE, stay in adventure and keep Pacifist on.
---
Every MMORPG that has come out has been a slow start. I have completed all of the quests and I still play several nights a week with friends. The game is 2 months old, enjoy the experience. 
---
Respawning is lore breaking.  It is literally the opposite of the entire story of WV where literally everyone died.  And stayed dead.
---
I think the recent players list is sorted by “most recent.”
---
That would be awesome.  There'd be a notification of his radio channel if he was in range of you, and you could have it play the same mutterings he's already making while walking around.
---
Thanks! I forgot about that one
---
I'd like to just know a general time line.
---
I'd take vague quarters at this point.
---
The only info we have about the vaults is from the week 1 inside the vault after the game launched.
---
I'd like to know if i should play this game anymore as i fizzled out awhile ago and making a 2nd alt to do more of the same isn't something I'm keen on doing.
---
And here I am with a normal shishkebab like some kind of chump.
---
Another (related) idea - a message log. The rewards list is definitely one time I miss messages, but this often happens with quests or other things, and to have a way to go back and see recent game messages would be quite useful.
---
Hell ya booking fights for March on ps4 lol
---
If they change nothing about the game and just make it solo why in God’s name would you pay for it again. Just wait for fallout 5. I pretty much play it solo already, and I just had to pay for it once. 
---
Great idea!

Can we get a direct answer to a direct question please, maybe go and ask who you have to to get the information for your customers.
---
Can you Fix the duping of items and can you remove duped items?
---
Within a reasonable time frame? it's ok if the answer is NO just because its a negative doesn't mean it will be taken as such. I for one would appreciate the honesty, I'm not sure about others and can only speak for myself though.
---
Not to single you out, bc it's common on Reddit, and especially this subreddit, but making angrily worded posts without thinking it through is one of the major pitfalls about this subreddit. That isn't to say there's nothing wrong with how Survival mode was pitched, I just think this subreddit tends toward knee-jerk reactions over more thoughtful discussion.
---
Yea there shouldnt be one.... but knowing bethesda they can screw up even a good idea sometimes.
---
I'm hoping for the best but I'm also a little worried that this will die off very quickly because bounties sre worth double. No one would want to lose all there caps especially the high level players.
---
Personally I love the woodcutting bots that just run about gathering wood forever
---
like a cow level?
---
That's brilliant! I would cover my PA butt in bumper stickers, guaranteed.
---
1: Build for it.   
---
2: Invest in armor pen against super mutants. (Stabilized Perk/Anti-Armor legendary) 
---
If your using no perks, no initial stealth hit, mutations, chems and a standard RPG it 100% should take 10 rockets to kill it.
---
My point is, you shouldn't need to build for it. That's why ammo weighs 6 lbs. It's not meant to be your daily bread weapon. It's to be used in oh shit circumstances, that's why its so heavy.
---
A rifle should not do more damage than a nuclear bomb. Ever. With any amount of perk cards on either build.
---
I wish I had that experience, I am hella envious.
---
Got a better one for you.
---
Killed one the other night and didn't get any loot from it.
---
"IT JUST WORKS"
---
Seriously. I mean, they can't even organize the names of objects correctly. Oh look, my quest reward is "Laser". I passed up the Night Eyes perk last night, because, while it sounded useful and i was tempted, i had no idea what it ACTUALLY did, and can't find a video that demonstrates it. I just gave up and picked a card that gave me 10% more damage in some situations. At least i can figure out "10% more damage". 
---
Bubbles isn't hidden by any means lol
---
I agree. I remember when the issue of the patch was very large. And the community spoke up. Now we have smaller updates to accommodate that. I enjoy suggestions but I really dislike “Bethesda need to” attitude. At least we get some fixes and new things every month, better than some other games I’ve played with long content and patch droughts.
---
Cool.  Idea of responders as the opt-out faction is cool.
---
Yes, 
---
A new true PvP mode is a good reason to require a fresh start. Especially considering all the duping and bullshittery that has happened with this game. Fresh game mode, fresh start.
---
Fuck. That. This is the games one and only shot at getting a playerbase back and with the rampant duping and exploits if they dont take this chance for an economy reset it'll be thr final nail in thd coffin.
---
Your existing character will experience zero change to gameplay.
---
OP? Do you know something we don't? Don't scare me like that. I don't want to start over, i love my character and i really want to trasfer it to PVP. I will still play from time to time on the PVE server with it because it will be impossible to do the Scorchqueen Beast Nuke on the PVP Server.
---
But Starched Genes are free
---
Nice, I've never seen Grahm in Watoga but he tanked for me nicely when I was lower level.
---
So Phoenix is the ultimate, sweet.
---
Thanks I'll check there
---
Thanks, i will try that
---
Are you opening the transfer menu?  If not, try that and see if they load. It’s an issue with water/resource collectors. 
---
Playing with a friend is a lifesaver. Being able to join the party again in the same server is nice. But I don’t always have a friend to play with 
---
Interesting build well done. I had one of my older camps here too if you wana check it out http://imgur.com/gallery/V5OJxGH
---
The Rarity of that drop it is one in a million so yes while they would have found their way in the game we would be nowhere near the point to where we are now you would be amazed if you seen some dude having a two shot explosive shotgun which would be awesome to see such a rare thing and make the game even that much more layered
---
But if more end game content is 3-6 months away. 
---
They won't tell us that, as certainly a lot of players would vacate in the meantime. Which is why their timeline silence is disconcerting. 
---
Stacking bobbleheads doesnt bypass pacifist mode.
---
Its been proven.
---
Exactly the same situation here.
---
Indeed. The only thing my new friends have left to do is get on, team up, and shred stuff in the Mire or Cranberry Bog. Sometimes we'll launch a nuke but that gets old too.
---
PC   Crash to Desktop.
---
Thanks, I’ll give that a go.    I already hit the place up for golf balls but didn’t notice the clubs have plastic too.    
---
I've got to agree, I just saw a topic with a power gamer giving advice to Bethesda on how to improve the game.  Some of it made good sense, such as not making the rare drops so rare that it's completely unreasonable to try to get.  
---
But he also went on and on about things only a power game would think, like there should only be the 4 best melee weapons in the game since the rest are essentially useless.  That's just not true, but to a power gamer who picked up an armor piercing super sledge, other weapons are irrelevant.
---
If your level is 150 or greater, you honestly shouldn't be trying to give advice to Bethesda, because Bethesda has already captured you and there's no good reason for them cowtow to your wishes.  They need the people who haven't hit 25, killed the scorchbeast queen to give them advice on what would make the game work better.
---
“You’re free to create new characters for Survival mode, and encouraged to do so, but you can also use your existing ones. If you do take on Survival mode with an existing character, keep in mind that all your progress from Adventure mode will travel with you, and anything that affects your character in one game mode will also affect them in the other. This means that if you fire off all your ammo, level up, complete a quest, spend Caps, or find a fancy new weapon in Survival, this will also be reflected on that character in Adventure. If you’d rather keep your existing characters as they are, we recommend starting a new one when you head into the more challenging Survival mode.” 
---
Copied from Bethesda.net
---
Can’t wait to have a big iron at my hip
---
but you will gain mutation you don't want.
---
I'm a good romanian. I see Vlad Tepes, i press like.
---
Thank you both a bunch.   I’ll be trying this out here in a little bit.  
---
Coming now 
---
Nah just server hop, the same as you would now on the current mode.
---
Nice! Does it reflect current level? Also, can you go back to your old room in the vault to use it as a backdrop?
---
heres a thought.
---
1: they will never compete with other weapons due to being AoE. so they have to have lower damage then tradition single target weapons. 
---
2: style points
---
3: they are end-game viable. people just refuse to mix/max them because it interferes with their pvp rifle builds. 
---
I do think it's hilarious that a [daisycutter](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Daisycutter) has less tooltip damage than my .44 pistol.
---
Honestly, the opposite is true.  You've broken the game, and any semblance of normalcy by playing it to excess.  They shouldn't be chasing after what you what you want because you are already super invested and they need to invest the players who aren't being captured, not the ones who will play for hundreds of hours after the content ends.
---
Doesn't matter to me if they duped or not. If someone is griefing, it still ruins the experience and I'm out.
---
I've run into this all over the place. The spot I'm in now I built my camp half on and half off the road. Had to move it 4 times to get the half not on the road to not have terrain clip through the foundation and walls in one corner. But, if I'm even close to another object I can't place it. I can intersect with the terrain all day, but that one piece of junk or whatever can't intersect with my house, oh no.
---
any person without bear arms or ordnance express should. 
---
Sorry we are too busy balancing PVP and implementing other PVP for the three to 5% players that like PVP no time or resources for PVE suck it
---
If your tse's aren't a problem then go pvp without them.
---
I know you won't
---
The fact that many people want something doesnt mean they are right. I guarantee you that you won't have a leveled field if they separate those worlds. On the contrary, people such as me, analytical, with lots of time, organised and playing in groups will make sure that nobody who we dislike will be able to share server with us, and it will be even easier for if we utilise all of our knowledge and the other players who lack such knowledge also lack any decent gear.
---
I actually have it and can tell you for fact I cannot put this in a container. It doesnt act like a regular item. when I traded for it he dropped it on the ground and rather than it being a paper bag you could actually see the mask model like you do in Watoga school.
---
I don't fuck with mics. I am strictly PvE, the only reason I got this game is because Fallout is my favorite IP and I am a sucker for exploring and looting. I have absolutely 0 interest in playing with random people. I never even used companions in previous titles because I prefer to be alone and they always just get in the way. Always.
---
Every time I play I end up with a bunch of escess scrap and a shitload of plans/recipes I already know, so I will look for a low level player and give it to them.
---
You could say I could just drop it, but I've had the bag disappear on me a few times. I look like a giant dick when I approach somebody with the trade emote and then they see me access my pip boy and after that we both just stand there looking at the ground, them using the confused emote because they don't realise I just wasted 100 adhesive/screws/ballistic fibre/whatever and a bunch of rare plans.
---
Afaik it’s impossible to re- enter the vault. 
---
I edited to clarify what I meant about the weapons. Please go read it and let me know if you disagree still. Thanks!
---
Making everyone start over would do nothing for balance. Within a couple of months everyone will just be kitted out like they are now, there will still be low levels wandering into survival at a disadvantage. 
---
Same. I think you meant to tell OP, not me. 
---
No, thats why I’m saying they should stick to their plans.
---
Missile launchers are affected by all the heavy weapons perks, and the ammo by the explosive ordnance perk. I can get launchers up to like 200 damage that only costs me like 4 or 5 lbs., not to mention if I used other explosive perks.
---
Still isn't great tho.
---
This is the first thing I do when I log on tonight! Thanks 🙏 
---
Ive done some testing. Grenadier only effects grenades to my knowledge. 
---
I don't trade. Every time I tried the game has frozen when I see the other persons inventory
---
I haven't seen a captured workshop in a while. Ammo factory very rare. Not even low lvls seem to be taking them. I take the Sunshine meadows just because I don't have my camp on an extractor an the Salisbury steaks are good but that's it.
---
I would! 👍
---
Free states, responders, BOS, and the order.
---
I hope in future DLCs NPC stewards could be established so, after completing a quest line an NPC steward
---
Would be made available to pick daily side or enhanced quests.
---
E,g, Imagine after completing order, you find out via crypto’s, a lone toon was abandoned.  Like the robot cop quest thing.
---
You could assist as a responder or order or even free states to rescue babysit back to HQ.
---
and go back repeatedly as quest giver.
---
Makes the game open ended.
---
Exactly. I'm not saying Bethesda is perfect, but there's a steady stream of fixes for this game, and they have taken steps to improve their communication with the community. And many of the fixes so far have directly improved my enjoyment of the game.
---
I think if people take a step back from the, "You suck because you haven't fixed the thing that is most important to me exactly the way I want you to fix it" mentality, they'll realize the game is steadily getting better.
---
yeah you gotta build for it or they trash. just like heavy gatling plasma's. 
---
Potential note - Change CAMP circle to a square, and allow CAMP squares to snap to each other, like floor pieces. 
---
YES! I’m fed up off having to dump every single Power Armor down to figure out which is which. 
---
On a side note: I have found with the tricentennial paint on PA it shows a little atom shop symbol (I don’t know if it’s all paints for the atom shop or just the tri edition) this is a handy little thing I noticed 
---
&gt; Am I having a stroke, or
---
I might be bloody minded, but any thread starting with these words gets an auto-updoot from me.
---
This one, however, actually deserves it. The current plans for Survival mode are HORRIFIC.
---
Unfortunately i think that is the case.  No news is better for them right now as they're floundering.
---
Why buy one of those in the first place? they usually become outdated after the first content patch, and even if they don't, they will become obsolete quickly.
---
Your loss for buying them and you'll not likely get a response.
---
Glad i dont need to make this exact thread. Nice OP. 
---
I agree.  If I want to have a heavy guns build, I have to allocate perks accordingly. If I want to be a rifleman, same thing.  So if I want to be a hoarder, it makes sense that I should also have to spend some perks to do so.
---
I hope you had some industrial sized shortening.
---
Hah. He found you too! Cool dude gave him some chems an ammo for the laugh.
---
The power gamers are already here. They all use the same 8-10 weapons, and completely eclipse other players in functional play. I'm not even min-maxed, and I understand that end of the player base. Not being min-maxed makes the one dimensional weapon selection even more prominent.
---
It's too risky. Maybe you form a party with someone who has RadSponge. Or maybe you gain mutations you don't want. Also how expensives are Nuka Grapes? I rather waste 2 points than constantly live in fear.
---
Same here, seeing as how the focus is not on ironing out or fixing, apparently. 
---
Lol i dont pvp with them melee unarmed build
---
“A “(Known)” tag will now appear next to recipes and plans you’ve already learned in Vendor and player inventories, and trade menus.”
---
Copied from the last inside the vault article. : )
---
I usually have nothing to trade or people don't have what I need. Sometimes people ask for too much and I can't afford it. 
---
It's ok, a good legendary is almost impossible to find, let alone on a good base weapon.
---
And I hope they prove it.
---
But they also claimed this was a finished product ready for release, too.
---
We can, but we'd be wrong.
---
“Stay the fuck out my cave” should be a neon sign 😂
---
Again over time everyone would have them, even with your highly inflated odds.
---
That is a shame, but glad to have the frame!
---
Charleston FD. On the counter when you come in main entrance. Hope that helps 
---
I don't take any offense to this, but I do disagree with the sentiment.  I feel knee-jerk reactions are fine in a forum since you can see in real time how people react to something.  It shows they have a lot of passion and conviction on how they feel towards the initial update.  There will be a lot of thoughtful discussion about it now that the initial impact has worn off, and I'm more than happy to discuss any and all mechanics current/proposed to see what works better for the game.
---
Which is was

Lmao that last part is kinda hilarious. To each their own but you really can't expect people to KNOW what you're trying to do when you have the option to tell them but choose not to. Also all friends were randoms at some point. 
---
Not this post alone. There are countless posts about people requesting things that would improve the game, and that they usually take up anyways. I'm not saying it's a 100% fool proof way to fix the game, but it's a great resource. 
---
There is an illness I agree, I don't know what is going on over there, as I'm not a game developer or in the industry at all. But it just seems like there is bumble after bumble with these features and a lot of underlying game mechanics.
---
Ps, I wish the sickle was a viable weapon because it looks super cool. 
---
Go for the typewriters, phones and fans in the Charleston Herald Building(there are 5 typewriters in the building: 2 on the first floor, and 3 on the third floor) and server hop till you get enough. Was able to get ~230 screws in about 2 hours if I recall correctly (: 
---
I would not assume this to be true without testing.
---
i got the green turf flooring for this reason. the only way to make floor that sort of kind of looks like its still outside
---
I do that with the ritualist outfit when I accumulate too many extra plans. Granted I tell them about the plans I put in the chest afterwards.   
---
One fellow thought he spotted a "critter", I dropped a paper bag, he and his buddy were discussing how weird it was that critters dropped paper bags. I didn't have the heart to say anything and laughed hysterically into my muted microphone. 
---
Tell me how many years until everyone naturally gets 18560 bobbleheads?
---
You on ps4 ?
---
This is spot on what worried me. Not the few fixes...but that patch style fixes were noteworthy highlights...
---
Until level 35ish, in mid to late November, I could 1 shot most enemies with the m70. After, it seemed even low level enemies shrugged it off. Could it be a bug caused by an update.
---
I think you are misunderstanding what people mean by "level playing field", they don't mean everyone is the same exact level and strength with the same gear - they mean everyone has to level up the same, find gear the same way, and all start at the same exact place. If you allow people to bring over their duped gear, their thousands upon thousands of bobbleheads, their already high level character (that may or may not have used xp exploits)...etc, that isn't a level start at all. 
---
&gt; The fact that many people want something doesnt mean they are right.
---
I disagree here, the fundamental principal is right - a new mode should require a new character, if it's PVP focused it should never allow already OP characters to be included. That is right, anyone who thinks otherwise is the one who is wrong here and the fact they even thought that was a good idea clearly shows how out of touch they are. 
---
&gt; On the contrary, people such as me, analytical, with lots of time, organised and playing in groups will make sure that nobody who we dislike will be able to share server with us, and it will be even easier for if we utilise all of our knowledge and the other players who lack such knowledge also lack any decent gear.
---
I don't even know what you mean here... You cannot "make sure" people aren't on your server, you have no control over that. Again, you seem to be missing the point entirely of wanting a fresh start, it isn't so everyone is the same skill level or same anything - it's so dupers/exploiters and the sheer volume of duped gear isn't brought over to ruin the fresh mode. This is a super simple concept so i'm just confused why you can't understand this. 
---
Okay...
---
While auto melee weapons need some love like the rest of the melee weapons you listed, they should not be included in the same group the way you listed them, because they use a different mechanic than the rest of the weapons, which you are complaining about for being same-y.
---
Does this make sense?
---
I also feel the need to point out again that *I agree with everything else you said.*
---
Mark my words they will listen to the people who complain the loudest and change their plan, so we won’t be able to use our old characters. I am 100% sure.
---
100000% this.
---
I got disconnected fast traveling \*back\* to my workshop today, after dying due to a glitch, and losing all my junk to another player. I thought I could just go back to the workshop and sit back, collect all my lead, aluminum, etc. But nope, disconnected during travel.
---
I love this game and put a ton of time into it, but it's these combos of kicks in the teeth that hurt.
---
That looks painful
---
People more concerned about there own play time and getting "caught up" with xyz players make me laugh.
---
The fresh servers mean a fresh start, no duped items and a healthy natural economy. This is far more important than people moaning they have to re level. You don't have to re level you can stay on the current servers and not notice a thing. Want it to be harder....remove perk cards, don't use your TSE's.
---
Calling for transfers whilst ignoring the duped items issues etc seems selfish but that could just be me.
---
Ah yeah they had them pkaying on the nuka machines in nuka world so we know it definately can be done
---
The point I was trying to make is that they should fix issues like this. 
---
They also dont kill me because im optimized to deal with them for pvp. 
---
You're fucking joking, right?
---
This game is STILL not in a finished, release ready state. More less last year.
---
The one time I tried I was stuck in a perpetual waiting screen.  I really think they missed an opportunity for that channel 
---
While I agree with some of your points, reading your post was exhausting due to the whiny tone.
---
My favorite PvP model would be competely no legendary items at all, and a full drop upon death, but I am extreme PvPer.
---
I do think that for broad masses such game would be unplayable, and since this game already gives me lots of enjoyment, my agenda is not to push it more into PvP extremes. On the contrary, what my agenda is consists of how to make game more approachable to players who are not able to spend as much time and dedication as I personally can, and I want those players to be able to compete against me in fights that are fun to all sides.
---
Character 'reset' is not leveling the field st all. Its allowing the people who have lots of free time to dominate completely over those with more responsibilities.
---
Heading there now to take a look don't feel like server hopping
---
I can agree with stuff like missile launchers and the Fat Man needing a damage boost. They were actually the specific weapons though that I was thinking of when you mentioned increasing the weight. Both are heavy enough by themselves and with their ammo. They just suck for damage.
---
As far the golf club/sledgehammer comparison goes the rate of attack is supposed to be the way these things balance out. A golf club shouldn't do as much damage, but it should also hit way faster than a sledgehammer.
---
What makes them useless OP? Just wondering
---
I’m a sneaky rifleman build so it doesn’t do great for me but I am 5/5 in demo expert so it’s not a total wash. Still a blast to marsupial jump in the air and just rain down grenades 
---
Not from.what i can tell, its literally jhst a static white screen
---
Ha!
---
Are you sure there’s no 450 or 500s? Lolz
---
Won’t know till you find out for real.
---
Yeah, nothing should ever change.
---
Rewording what you first wrote isn't needed though. I understood it before 
---
&gt; makes it 3200...no player has survived 
---
Assassin, Fireproof and the Dense mod say hello. Add Sentinel on top of that and you'd think you slapped them with a wet paper towel.
---
Thanks it was there
---
i have an i5 4460 and i notice my cpu cap out occassionally. I originally was playing with an R9 280 but the game was unplayable so i upgraded to a GTX 1060. I still get those frame drops though. 
---
I did a little googling and found someone that posted optimal settings in the Nvidia control panel that seemed to have helped some too. 
---
Worded it wrong. My camp, it will take some time before i can build the rad shower, and other stuff again. 
---
Oh, man.. I didn't mean it in a bad way. 
---
I was actually hoping for more and was sad to see the post ended. 
---
I want to see more in depth criticism of the overall status of the game. 
---
Focusing on certain problems is okay, but it often times creates narrow minded solutions. 
---
To make changes needed to help this game they need to take into account all of the stuff you stated and more to actually "fix" the issues. 
---
Imo some things need an entire overhaul and it looks like they are avoiding that route like the plague. 
---
They cant just try and tweak Fallout 4 anymore. 
---
This is an entirely different game. Or at least needs to be treated as such when making changes. 
---
Oh I don't disagree. I fucking hate the bag disappearing but there are workarounds. A friend of mine taught me a rather obvious method but for some reason I never even thought about. Basically she puts the stuff she wants to give people in containers like desks or trashcans and people pick em up from there. 
---
Haha! That's where your heart begins to pound really hard, you hold your breath and let out a big smile :D
---
Fantastic build. I'm currently working on a similar fort style hub. Pretty massive but it's coming along nice. Has a trade post / bar / lounge / workshop / living quarters. Will be finishing it up in the next day or so an posting it.
---
Technically folks are accidentally putting their stuff in, but only because one of your items will randomly pop up on the list of quest items to drop in there. Its easy to just start hitting the button to put the meat or whatever in there and then suddenly your armor pops in the list and before you know it you've put it in there.
---
So you expect your friends and family to be perfect and exactly meet what you want despite other people liking them how they are?
---
People who have more free time will always dominate, whether it is through more loot, experience, or skill/muscle memory. Could maybe have something like an old days runescape wilderness type thing, where you can save one item
---
This game mode is for those people.
---
You can just stay on the current servers and ignore the survival mode :)
---
Its not mandatory!
---
Jesus grow up,  report yourself for christ sake 🙄 that's not fucking boosting. 
---
I believe I got it from one of the Whitespring vendors.
---
It had enough content at launch to be classed as a full game, bugs mean nothing.
---
Uh yeah..
---
It’s in workshops lolz
---
Not bad mouthing playing slow, just a statement.
---
Lets hope it comes with the Patch 5, they already stated "and much more" so here's me hoping...  
---
Bethesda pls.  
---
Smart! Thank you very much! Trading all the individual items takes way too damn long so this is a real life saver
---
ive bought the t-60 calibrated shocks mod from the watoga vendor twice now and each time it keeps disarming from my inventory...like wtf?
---
After 76 , I doubt they’ll get much in the sense of ore orders, I know I myself will not buy another bathesda game until after lunch, I spent 80$ CAD on the pre order just to see it on sale for 30$ CAD couple of weeks after lunch . 
---
Dang now this a good idea and I think it fits perfectly with theme of survival mode. Could grey out legendaries in a way so they are in your inventory but don't weigh anything and can't be equiped. Not sure how hard this would be to code into the game but would be a good way to balance it.
---
But it does matter. We have enough rumors going around without more bullshit being perpetuated. 
---
oh shit thanks!
---
There's probably some pretty good videos online of how it all works but when I was in the army I was the NBC (nuclear /biological /chemical defense) NCO for several different units I was assigned to.
---
Some of the decontamination process is simple depending on what was exposed, but even the decontamination wipes wer made in a manner that would remove a few layers of your skin.
---
If you were badly exposed you're talking about getting scrubbed with big plastic nylon brushes.
---
I would love to set up there, but I've seen YouTubers show where this place is and I'm afraid it will already be taken on many servers.
---
There is massive desync issues with it where it stops playing for long periods of time. They cant figure it out.
---
Phew, for a second i thought you heard something. I'm hanging here by a thread. 90% of the playerbase are anti-pvp singleplayer fans who complain about everything. They will never be happy playing this game might as well ruin it for us too just to teach Bethesda a lesson to never cater to us again.
---
I was about to go in there but the No Trespassing sign was too powerful.
---
There's a spot in the north most region (can't remember the name) where you can both have a lead and a junk deposit. If you combine that with the grafton steel yard, you get hella mats. That's at least about 30 lead and upwards of 80 steel per visit, and I imagine if you add in the circuits ran by OP it only gets better.
---
I actually like the sound of this
---
This is just dumb. Delete this comment
---
Or reduce their weight to 0.5 and 2 respectively.
---
Yes that's what videogames are for.  Be nice irl :)
---
That's fair. I use cultist daggers because they look awesome.
---
Thanks! Like I said, Don't want it to completely change the game, just make it a little more interesting ya know
---
I've assumed that armor follows the [Fallout 4 formulas](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance#Fallout_4), where the ratio of damage to armor is used (raised to the power of 0.366 and then halved) to calculate the percentage of the damage that makes it through the armor.
---
16% of players only get to level 50? Do people just pick up and dump this game? I got it for Christmas and basically haven’t seen a human life form for a month because I am obsessed. 
---
I didn’t realise the stats were so low. I classify myself as a half noob/ half okish player at level 88 I have launched many nukes, SBQ fights so it baffles me what people are moaning about if they haven’t done any of these. 
---
Thanks for the stats guys. Super interesting to know 👏🏼
---
You mean like every other game has?  Crazy thought! :)
---
I think the weekly events are already on, like the tots giving you rad resistance, and now the darkness heals your character 
---
Yes if expectations have been set wrongly. There are ways of roadmapping 'foggy' areas that can be locked in by e.g voting by players. Kinda like the MS Office roadmap.
---
I get it, just don't think it's fair to characterize it as lots of people having put the game down hahaha
---
I started before 25, and as soon as I leveled to 25, finished built the PA station.
---
My toon is 3x, and simultaneously doing, raider rose &amp; finished order.
---
The gear maybe too tall to wear but it fits, eventually lolz
---
I don't want to assume but it's likely the case yes.
---
lol soft arse
---
They won't learn to not keep there springs on them in pvp contested zones now.
---
Remember four months ago when were all like "I'm going to be in this faction and build a town with my friends and we are totally going to fight with other factions and it is going to be sweeeeeeet!" How naive we were.
---
Thanks a lot for the detailed explanation!
---
&gt; Explosive adds 100% weapon damage "on top" as AoE explosions, so same 16 damage per pellet.
---
This is quite weird. If I were to design this myself, I'd go with no additional damage and just add a radius to the regular bullets.
---
&gt; Explosives (rocket launcher missiles too) has AoE, where each hit can hit multiple zones.
---
So with Grenadier I can multiply my damage by 7 (6 body parts but the head counts double) on small enemies? This is awesome. And broken. 
---
Should of left some salt ahahaha cheers for the giggle
---
Thats not working out so well with WAR.
---
Capture sunshine meadows workshop. I'm not kidding I see him daily when I collect my Salisbury steaks.
---
It does in relationship to how you play, but your knowledge and experience doesn't seem to be indicative of the majority of players. That's the whole point of this thread.
---
Yeah it's broken for sure but we need to stop pretending it's because of tse.  Also more likely bloodied explosive.  Honestly it's near impossible to know if the weapon shooting you is two shot or not lol
---
[This video is a good explanation of potential trading improvements, too.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tkC2SkdWRA)
---
My apologies, it was not my intent to criticize. It was probably the "freaking", I'm going to edit that :p
---
The one decent 3* I got recently was a bloodied flame with 25% faster fire rate. Gave me a good laugh..
---
There’s a video of a whole server using two shot fatmans on the sbq and it still takes them forever to take her down.
---
Meanwhile someone does a crazy bloodied build and two shots her solo. That seems balanced...
---
If the shear amount if duped tse weapons, sentinel armor and obscene amounts of bobbleheads etc... get to survival mode it'll be impossible to do most things let alone SBQ nuke.
---
For example, all it needs is one lone chameleon wearing tse bobblehead sniper ( or teams of)  on top of the church tower in flatwoods to snipe everyone and anyone doing fertile soil. This is seen as a low level player event and it'll make doing even mundane tasks as that 1000% harder.  
---
A roadmap can apply to game, especially if it allows feedback from players to influence priority of stuff on it?
---
I miss calling my Syringer “Nirvana”
---
Everyone is entitled to there opinion dude. We won’t always agree that’s why we participate in forums. 😊🤙🏼
---
I've used mini nukes and missile launchers with full demolitions expert.
---
They're useless against strong individual monsters and good at crippling packs of weak ones.
---
Lol there is no plan. 
---
I don't think its adequate for you to call me out of touch. By make sure I mean peace through superior firepower, I do guarantee you that my group will be around the top of the food chain and we'll have means to make sure that really rude players (not the competitors, we love competitors) are forced to swap servers.
---
There is no fundamental principles here, there are things you consider absolute truth without any particular justification. 
---
The fresh start will not level the playing field because the day this mode comes out I will take two days of holidays by end of which I will be able to freerly control who on my server is allowed to exp where I am exping, and the only way to counter dominance of people such as me is to give less hardcore players means of gearing and exping up.
---
Please stop assuming cognitive issues on my part, because I will do the same to you, only my comments will not be as unsubstantiated as yours are.
---
Haha
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaT6EKzKb4k
---
Oh ya I think I saw a Camp with both before! Good tip!
---
There's also a spot in the southern part of the Savage Divide with: a Lead spot, an acid spot, and over a dozen minable ore spawns. But the problems with it are two-fold: A) the lead &amp; acid are separated by a cliff so you'd need to place your Camp centre like halfway up an outcropping of rock. B) it's recklessly close to a Fissure.
---
If you're on PC I have a few copies of the plan I can pass out.
---
And why are protest signs held with two hands but count as one handed weapons?  
---
Oh you mean stuff that youtubers spam out already?
---
Prove it. You could have recorded it after it happened. There’s NO proof of it happening. 
---
Wrong style as if said before, this will never be a battle royal but very similar to ark or rust(which both have no real story or quests and still have a very large player base). If there was no peplay value there why are ppl still playin years after launch?? I'm sure there will be plenty of new pve stuff(quests,events,dlc,n other stuff) but it will take longer I'm sure. But ya this def not gonna chase the battle royal scene, at least I hope not. Imo this game in it's current state is like Rust light. full of padding n restrictions and the new mode will open the doors to the real deal
---
I take workshops with water purifiers because 5 waters every 5 minutes in addition to my purifiers at camp equals a bunch of easy caps after I stockpile them and do the vendor bot circuit. 
---
Remove weapon legendaries? Is +20% extra damage that scarry to you? You can stack 5 bobbleheads for +100% damage for 1 hour. Duper has thousents of bobbleheads. Only thing they need to remove is bobblehead stacking and explosive shotgun ×8 pallet scaling.
---
Next to MooMoo
---
Lol way more than 5% but ok
---
&gt; I didn’t realise the stats were so low. I classify myself as a half noob/ half okish player at level 88 I have launched many nukes, SBQ fights so it baffles me what people are moaning about if they haven’t done any of these.
---
That's just it. The people who are complaining about not having anything to do are a small fraction of that 16% -- the people who leveled as fast as possible to 100+ and raced to the end. They missed out on potentially hundreds of hours of exploration and very well-crafted environmental storytelling. There's plenty of content to be had; it's just not the content that vocal minority wants.
---
Ye its in the game since launch :/
---
I’ll work on workshops and visiting Resin then. Thanks! 
---
Well said, sir.
---
step 1: keep getting rid of mutations/rads you don't want.
---
step 2: get to the point in the story that you get into the Enclave and can buy the different mutations you want. (not cheap)
---
step 3: throw starched genes x2 on and profit.
---
Unfortunately I’m on Xbox. I appreciate it though. 
---
Decent but I max vendor caps off Halloween outfits. They weigh litterally nothing with the perk an sell for ALOT.
---
I would rather the vault's main entrance be in a cave that so openly exposed. Granted it looks nice for the cameras, but being in a cave offers you some extra layers of protection, especially to the vault door. (See Vault 87).
---
But I would be a little concerned about being lead down into a deep dark cave initially. 
---
Yep.. all it takes is forgetting one time, or maybe accidentally walk into a running rad arch.
---
what’s a toon
---
Well, I bought a couple 2 shot experimental mirv's on xbox if anyone wants to buy em from me
---
And me
---
Half recipes changed, stats completely wrong. Maps are somewhat intact give or take. 
---
I have the Daisycutter on me and if I see a mini nuke I must pick it up. I found myself with a few the other day and shot them at a super mutant. He took both of them and still had over half health. 
---
Complain more
---
There is no source on the shareholder thing, that was simply my speculation. I posted a thread a while ago about some messages located in the game files. Find it here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ahyv35/datamined\_information\_regarding\_future\_cut\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ahyv35/datamined_information_regarding_future_cut_and/)
---
Two of the messages I found in the game files were:
---
* *Spotlight\_Holiday2018Message*
---
   * Happy Holidays!
---
   * We hope you enjoy this small gift from all of us here at Bethesda Game Studios.
---
* *Spotlight\_NewYears2019Message*
---
   * Happy New Year!
---
Which shows that there was something planned, however the idea of it being higher ups who cancelled it was pure speculation on my part and has no hard evidence.
---
letting people take their characters over to survival is a horrible idea. Cheaters and Dupers will ruin the experience for anyone that wants to play "legitimately".
---
I probably shouldn't have drunk so much at lunch...
---
It shows that you avoid pvp, not me. I've stated to others jus stay out the new mode no need for you to play it
---
So, bearing that in mind, if we are the vocal minorty overall, but perhaps a more realistic snapshot of players who do make it to "endgame", wouldn't Bethesda still want our input because we're the ones who they want to see. They want to see players get beyond level 25. They want to see people play Barbie all the way up to level 300 all the while spending Atoms along the way.
---
If they're not seeing that now, they're probably trying to figure out how to make more of us, and if that means PVP and event revamps, that's part of the direction that they think will create more level 50+ around the Wasteland.
---
Or trade useless cards for usefull cards.
---
So cool! Can I hack off a limb with this? No 😟
---
Naming power armor would be great but naming weapons won't work out. Too many people would be crass with the names and Bethesda isn't a fan of online pricks. Is why PvP is like it is. 
---
 Someone trading and seeing ".50 cal N*g*er F**ker rifle" wouldn't go over well.
---
I believe I got them from taking Sunshine meadow workshop. Seems to rotate plans of wood desk / rug set 1 / kitchen chair / advertising posters. Good luck!
---
No updates on that yet.
---
Still happening, and last night I couldn't even see my teammates name.
---
He was literally a ghost.
---
I run a lot of them. I rub marsupial for the jumping and carryweight, speed demon for the reload speed, twisted muscles for if I ever pull out my hammer, scaly skin and grounded for additional protection, carnivore because it was the first one I picked up and everyone says it great.
---
I also have the healing one, but I don't ever see it work. It sit at missing HP all the time and it doesnt regenerate.
---
Please take your time on this. Don’t rush it. Can’t afford another premature launch. Community won’t handle it well 
---
That would have been much better. Next time.
---
I really loved that game until they impelemented their auction house which just killed the economy.
---
People with more free time should have an advantage, not a position of absolute dominance. My point is not to make my life easier, because I am fine with recreating my character, I already have four of those.
---
What Im not fine with is that people are not happy with some things and request solutions that will not solve those issues.
---
What my agenda is is to allow less dedicated players remain competitive in PvP.
---
The project already implements pretty much everytying i’d want to see in an online fallout game and i can’t wait for future updates.. Pvp will be the Survival mode
---
Well, power armors are absolutely everywhere. I don't know what cranberry relish is, but cobbler needs only cranberries and it's 5% more xp. 
---
Although I agree there are a lot of players and no way of playing is wrong, just different. Everyone does what they like and I can respect that. 
---
It devastates your carry weight.
---
So what we see in the movies where they strip you naked and brush the living fuck out of you is real?   I guess it's better than a slow death to radiation poisoning but still.  Yikes.

This is a good primer on PA spawns around the map.

---
😂 I love this 
---
I drop every missile launcher I'm rewarded (I don't pick them up). Missiles, too. Don't even keep them long enough to scrap them. They're too heavy for the small damage they do. 
---
When I typed this I said it in my head about myself
---
My guy has the cloaking effect (disappear after being hit with melee) even though I wear no armor with that mod. I do have a piece in my inventory that has it though. 
---
How’s that aluminum foil hat holding up? Lol
---
It's just RNG.
---
Easiest spots I have found for low level T-45 to T-60 farming are at Mama Dolce's Food factory in Morgan Town (Just SW of fast travel point, in the barn there) and the shed outside of Belching Betty down in the Ash Heap (right next to the Firebreathers Final Exam mine.)
---
Both of those have T45, T51b, and T60 spawns.  With usually 3 Random pieces.  Pray to RNGesus.
---
they need to seriously put the survival thing on the backburner till they completely unfuck the original mode.
---
They shouldn't be in the same group, but they suffer the same problem. They're inferior. A 3 point perk makes them super good, but only for half of their durability. Then they lose an order of magnitude, and are beyond useless. I was so excited to find my first ripper that I immediately went and found a ghoul. That was a hard crash.
---
Marsupial
---
Speed demon 
---
Healing factor
---
Make sure you've got class freak on.
---
&gt;Weapons that could be removed from the game completely and no one would be too bothered: 
---
&gt;assaultron blade, chinese officers sword, cultist blade,
---
&gt; My Fusion Generator was suspended above my camp by a giant branch for a while.
---
Rock-a-bye-baby, in the tree top... (...) when the bough breaks, the fusion gen will fall, squashing everyone underneath flat, once and for all.
---
I’m a milf. I have Guinness world record for largest nipples. Your the sexist pig.
---
Wait, did you actually leave the springs? Or just the rotten fruit?
---
Either way, that was funny.
---
If you're short on parts that'd stop the repair. As for finding a T-45 helmet, you're gonna have to just keep finding random PA sets until you get what you need. It can be extra annoying when you do find the right parts but they're the wrong level 🤦 but you'll find it eventually, just maybe not before you reach a higher level and want something else lol
---
That would be a good change to make.
---
Bulldozer ended up being nothing like what they teased.  If you build a floor over a small tree, the game will remove that tree (or its supposed to) instead of the tree sticking up in your base.  Thats the bulldozer.
---
There’s no “bulldozer” icon or mode enabled, just that some objects get displaced when setting down foundations and the like. This was enabled for workshops from the beginning - they just turned it on for camps as well.
---
As for floating walls, can you select them? You may have to move camps to get rid of them.
---
Duping will always be in the game. Even if they wipe.  I heard all you need to dupe is trade an item to a friend then disconnect. And server will rollback you a duped item. I don't think Bethesda will fix it because they don't want to remove the roleback option. People will complain about losing items to disconnect. With the TSE nerf they even the plainfield now all they need to do is remove bobblehead stacking and then we won't be as vulnerable to dupers.
---
I strongly suggest using the internet to research games instead of using it to complain about text research methods.
---
It's irrelevant if over time if would happen or not, no one has a time machine and can know that 100%. If they could predict it they would be using the software for world peace / hunger etc.
---
Just because something may happen over time doesn't mean its acceptable for cheaters to try and inject the market and take it there over night.
---
No matter how many times you post that there's melee builds that can ignore TSE's is also irrelevant, the problem isn't being killed by them. Its about the cheaters being allowed to ruin an economy that doesn't need to be ruined, new servers is a fresh start a chance for the economy to mature over time as it would naturally and as this one would off before the cheaters ruined it.
---
For someone that doesn't use TSE'S and cant be killed by them you seem very passionate about dupers being able to keep there ill gotten gains.
---
The bulldozer function happens kind of automatically when you place things now. Small trees, logs, rocks, and bushes will disappear. 
---
I also had the issue of walls not deleting that were like three stories up. I ended up just having to move my c.a.m.p. so everything would store. You don’t have to move it far though. I was practically in the same spot. 
---
It works as you build. If you place something over the tree, the tree should disappear. 
---
Marsupial, Eagle Eyes, Bird Bones and Adrenal Reaction. VATS sniper build is why I got EE &amp; AR, I like to fly is why Marcupial &amp; BB. All serums, waited until I got Class Freak L3 and was over level 100. Considering getting Speed Demon next.
---
It's funny how everyone sits outside of the Whitespring slot machine loot cave endlessly grinding for the most OP loot in the game or posting offers on the market place for outrageously rare armor sets and weapons......and Bethesda somehow thought they could balance this game for PvP? Now they think nerfing TSE weapons is going to bring balance?
---
I greatly enjoy playing the game (not camping outside of the golf club) and the excitement when I encounter a 3* enemy......will I get an awesome drop? Or a 1* wood arm?
---
The only thing more lame in this game than the broken PvP disaster is the loot cave garbage that is  the Whitespring resort. I avoid both as a solo player and don't trade for gear, I play with what I get and I love the game.
---
Only the fruit. I am normally a nice guy, but not when there is 89 springs on the line.
---
they don't have one is all that's been cleared up
---
What part of stay the fuck out of his cave did you not understand?
---
Fun but not effective no.  And I really tried to make it work.
---
Cripples large packs of weak enemies.  Still useless against strong individual enemies.  You'd never be able to keep up with the ammo cost to kill scorchbeasts.
---
It's a goofing around alternate to swap in demo expert perk for a bit.
---
At this point I would welcome the duping back if I could get back my 1 to 2 crash to desktop a night instead of the current 15 to 16.
---
Man.
---
You are saltier than I am.
---
For like, no reason.
---
Upset that other people enjoy putting more effort than you do into a game?
---
Really?
---
File this under outrageous requests we don't really need. 
---
Grahm is supposed to be rare to find, not easily pinpointed in every server. 
---
We should all be asking for GAME/ SERVER STABILITY. 
---
I agree!!!
---
If I could just log on and have my camp, that would be a great start.  I almost threw my controller out the window last night when I logged on and got the "CAMP cannot be placed" and then try to place it and it's FLOATING and I basically had to rebuild.  UGH.
---
To repair them, make sure you store all your junk in your Stash.  Sometimes crafting / repairing fails to allow you to do so if you have materials split between your Stash and your Inventory.
---
The challenge here is player retention .. I’ve played quite a bit of this game and it was enjoyable with my irl friends and the general trading community in the last two months.   
---
However, we’ve run out of things to do and there are little incentives, poor rewards for events or even sbq, it’s tough to stay playing.  
---
If they have planned the game properly and thought it out maybe we wouldn’t be clamoring for more new content two months in.  
---
Sure some diehards will stick it out but frankly it’s saddening to see a brand I love like fallout be so poorly disgraced and treated like this.
---
It could be so much more in the future, but, will there still be players ?  There’s just so much competition out there and frankly, better titles for my leisure time playing games.
---
Will everyone win the lottery if we all started  living for millions of years?  
---
Thank you.  First time I moved my camp I built it like 5 times.. all m screws are gone.  So I've been trying to grind those, but then they get used for repairs and mods.  So confused but slowly getting it.  I started day 1. Just haven't played much as my group of friends hated this version
---
I use that outfit, and chase people around with a flaming chainsaw, then drops a bunch of plans or meds for them =P
---
I have no idea what I just read. 
---
Yeah, I just hit level 65 and the “special” card I got was hacking. Like, the first one you get. Needless to say I’ve had that one for awhile... and the expert and master hacker cards... so yeah, I’d like to have something better. 
---
Today I got to see a player who was at level 998. I'm 123. I play everyday and partake in nukezones etc. How does anyone get to level 1000 in 3 months?
---
Bro you are the one who is gonna have to re level to be competitive in survival. The truth is what you are putting on me about being selfish is a reflection of your own feelings on the matter. You all have to do some grinding to get in there and not get griefed, and you want me to have to do it to. Well I already have sorry bud 
---
As I said in my previous post duped items did nothing but speed along the progression of endgame. Yes It spoiled the game for pve, but had no effect at all in pvp. I would have had to account for the fact that at least SOME people would have tse weapons in my build no matter what. So what exactly would removing most of them from the game do? Considering people level up by the day what would starting fresh do?
---
Well it would accomadate the PVE community, who hasnt had a lick of interest in PVP until now. 
---
And I dont use power armor or tse weapons at all melee unarmed build.
---
&gt; Edit: T-51b is better anyways, just so you know
---
T45 starts at level 25, right?  T51b starts at 30 or 35?  Then T60 at 45.
---
&gt;Weapons that could be removed from the game completely and no one would be too bothered:
---
&gt;shishkebab, ski sword
---
I selected a few from that massive lists, but it sounds like you just don't use single handed melee weapons lol. I don't use most weapons but I'm not going to suggest they get removed entirely. I took this post seriously until I got to that part. I personally hate how slow it feels to use two handed swords, and if you use the proper perks, the single handed swords do almost as much damage but you can swing them faster. That part alienates single handed melee builds entirely lol. I admit the lv.45 modded ski sword is the strongest single handed sword though. 
---
You are out of touch and clearly have NO clue what people mean when they say starting at a level playing field. You have demonstrated you don't get it. 
---
&gt; I do guarantee you that my group will be around the top of the food chain and we'll have means to make sure that really rude players (not the competitors, we love competitors) are forced to swap servers.
---
So you say, as long as you and your team all started fresh and acquired gear legit than that is all well and good
---
&gt; There is no fundamental principles here, there are things you consider absolute truth without any particular justification.
---
The absolute truth is if they allow existing characters to bring their duped/exploited gear to a fresh server, it will ruin it. This is factually true in every sense of the word.
---
&gt; The fresh start will not level the playing field because the day this mode comes out I will take two days of holidays by end of which I will be able to freerly control who on my server is allowed to exp where I am exping,
---
Again, YOU are the one who is not understanding what a fresh start means and why people want it. NO ONE is saying there wont be people who power level and out gear others, not a single rational person thinks this. People don't want existing duped gear and existing xp exploited players to be able to transfer to the new server - the fact I have had to explain this multiple times is just beyond irksome - this is the simplest concept ever and I am completely baffled you cannot understand it. 
---
&gt; Please stop assuming cognitive issues on my part, because I will do the same to you, only my comments will not be as unsubstantiated as yours are.
---
It's not an assumption, you have clearly demonstrated you have no understanding of why so many people want fresh start servers. 
---
I didn't take it in a bad way. It's a rant. I did my best to keep it on point and thoughtful.
---
I had to get dinner for the family and lunch stuff for an upcoming trip, so I had to stop. I'm considering a larger and more clearly expounded document about all of this.
---
Small fundamental changes can create enormous ripples in the game, and should be the starting point to pivot to a better game at the more basic level.
---
As much as I would love to see this go single player (even more with CO-OP), this game was literally what New Vegas was to Fallout 3; the source code, bugs and errors were copy pasta'd from Fallout 4 to the point Fallout 4 mods work ok them.
---
We have most of the assests and tools required downloaded with the game ourself. Mass Effect 3 allowed matched to be hosted off of a single PC close to a decade (fact check?) ago, so I think Bethesda' could just release this as an eventually free 'dlc' or patch option for us.
---
I'd love to play this 'offline', but realistically after all the ride I've been through I wouldn't pay for it after a launch like this. If they offered the option at the beginning, maybe. Not now.
---
Or stop getting cards that can't be reused. I think I've gotten lockpick (the basic one) in every pack I've opened.
---
What category does Super Duper fall under?
---
Tried farming Blackwater mine for only the ones I wanted but that was a no. So I have them all (except carnivore.) Will probably adjust when I'm floating in caps someday but for now I've adjusted and they're pretty fun. Really like marsupial and chameleon. The ones that explode in melee are entertaining too.
---
So instead of fixing things as they go, they should wait several months to roll out 1 patch to fix everything at once? Chill man, these things take time unfortunately 
---
How would you abuse it? Assuming all duped weapons are gone? Each nuke is earned fair and square 
---
Serendipity and Marathoner do not work with power armor.
---
Yeah...the cards don't specify that.
---
There have already been leaks about a new pvp event that basically have you running for president.
---
I remember in Skyrim that wearing a full set of light/medium/heavy armor had buffs to DR and stamina I think? I think that might work better than specific weapons being affected by armor sets. I'd rather outfits be purely cosmetic. 
---
I'm also originally from WV, specifically growing up in the chemical valley region, and the first time I listened to a Survivors Story holotape, it unexpectedly hit me with such a vast sadness. Here was this voice speaking in such an intimately familiar accent and detailing the last days of her life. I looked around the ruins of Flatwoods and overlaid it on the actual town, the people whom I know and love who still live in that neck of the woods; I thought about all that just being gone. It was an unexpected and powerful moment. So powerful, actually, that I haven't listened to another Survivor Story holotape since.
---
So... Yeah, that jacket could actually be a ~$250 jacket.
---
But good golly gosh is that thing *tacky.*
---
Well if there's a "head defense" and then the hat, it would be nice.
---
Let me put this another way.  Do you seriously think there will be no duping in the new survival mode? 
---
&gt;Look, lady. I don't know what to make of me either. 
---
SAME.
---
Just nothing meaningful to do anymore :/
---
Like Monster Hunter, for example. There's even an option to hide hat only on cutscenes.
---
The chipmunk looking thing? I have that one. I just got tired of wearing it. I run around in my Confederate uniform and cowboy hat. I was wearing the duster, but I like the look of the uniform better. There is another costume or whatever that I want, but don't remember the name of it right now. 
---
Lmao.
---
Somebody stacking bobbleheads is only an issue to people who run around on passive mode all the time. You only need to be able to do about 500 damage to one shot other players if you perk right. So please tell me how doing 20000 damage effects anything at all in pvp against hostile players?
---
Isn't this what the Overseer wanted us to do?
---
I don't mind re levelling and new players on the server wont mind either.
---
I don't have to re level either i have 4 characters over 50 one of them is just under level 200. Ill probably take 1 to the new server and always start a new character on the new server.
---
I also understand though, that these new servers aren't just for me and the few hundred hours I've put in aren't the end all and be all for Bethesda. A healthy server / economy is far more valuable.
---
Well said Lapietra
---
Log out, log back in. Always works for me. 
---
But vs the only end game boss we have, high single damage attacks are the most powerful by miles. One handed weapons just aren't big boss material.  I also included an edit clarifying what I mean by that section about weapons. It's far and away the most controversial and mis-understood/badly written. Sorry for the confusion.
---
I think 30 🤔 but if you're 25 that's close enough it'd be worth holding onto if you find it, just keep it all on a spare Chassis to save weight. Also, it ends up being one of the best later on, because the leveled up versions of T-51b outpace the leveled up versions of T-60 or T-45. I think it's actually one of the highest overall except for having a lower rad resistance. But if you can handle a couple extra rads, it has amazing protection against damage.
---
That's still definitely a cool idea, I would just worry about the God Roll Complete Same Set Armor Sets, giving them even more power like that would worry me personally
---
Oh I do.  My friend, I log out and back in so many times I feel like Pennywise is going to show up and get too excited about floating.
---
Exactly!
---
That’s stupid they should definitely include this sort of information on their perk card descriptions
---
RNG isn't bad. Hell every time I turn around I see another player with 5 matching pieces of Cavalier Assassin's armor and half a dozen TSE guns.
---
Ow?
---
Halloween outfits, you say? Time for me to get into a new line of business :)
---
Depends on play style. There is one that passively increases ap. If you are a melee player there is one that increases with hits.... then there is stealthboy if you snipe... just depends.
---
Maybe because it's not helpful, and sounds like gloating.
---
It used to. But bethesda and their god awful way of dealing with bugs, realized this weapon also benefitted from another perks, I believe it was the heavy gunner ones which aren’t supposed to affect explosive weapons, so they changed the auto grenade launcher weapon type to no longer be heavy. Because of this, the perk bear arms has no effect on it.
---
An absolute dogshit ‘solution’ but not suprising they chose the easy way around the problem.
---
stooping to another's level is still stooping to their level. 
---
With that said, it is in Bethesda's interest to get you to pay for your own server if you want to play with mods. You made their argument for them when you stated you would pay for the game all over again just to play alone. 
---
Rooftop Power Armor spawn in Point Pleasant by the bridge 
---
This is hilaruous. Ty.
---
I post stupid, quick thoughts sometimes xD thank you for clarifying! 
---
The plans are really hard to find but if you can find them they are great. The skeleton one is the best.
---
Agree to this. A PvE with lite PvP component is what drew me to the game .
---
The game just isnt polished enough for battle royale style PvP. You can get dope weapons in PUBG sure, but screw up once and a guy with a starter gun can kill you due to relatively polished gunplay. In FO76 it quickly turns into the first guy to get assassins armor + high dps becomes god. 
---
If you do melee the +2 strength from Optimized Servos is quite nice. 
---
I opted for this on my Excavator and T-60 PA sets. 
---
Don't forget the mothman! 
---
hahah what no way thats awesome! 
---
Only 4 marsup, adrenal, speed demon, and the disease one bc I got it randomly in the beginning
---
Thats a good point, and as much as everyone has jump onto thisa "duping" train and all that, I am still trying to figure out how this has effected the game play, as a player, it hasnt effect my playthru yet outside of a few laggy servers, Don't get me wrong the exploits have to be fix, but in ruining a pretend economy? not sure how thats working
---
Really great and thorough testing! I know on some occasions I've seen enemies glow red for no apparent reason, and this would explain that I guess.
---
Also, a couple days ago I switched my main PA suit from Excavator with no targeting HUD to T-60 with targeting HUD. I haven't had any crashes yet, but that's only over maybe 6 hours of playing so far. However, I did notice a performance hit in certain situations. Running around Watoga seemed a little slower, occasionally dropping to 40-50 fps whereas it's usually a constant 60. In parts of the Whitespring Bunker, especially in the production wing with 10+ robots standing around, my fps dropped to a steady 40, and only recovered when I got far enough away into the military wing. I've never noticed performance hits like this before in either area prior to switching armor.
---
Tested at 2160p on i7 9700K, RTX 2080Ti, 32GB DDR4.
---
Emergency protocols. 100%. Bloodied anything with nerd rage. 50% DR. Also tesla coils if you are tagging.
---
Two shot, the second shot does 25% damage instead of 100%. Explosive damage reduced from 100% to 25%
---
If legendary weapons are allowed at all,  the new characters you insist on having will also be geared up through a new broken economy in  a new server.   The new characters won't make any difference long- term.
---
That's the reality, unless you are naive enough to seriously believe that Bethesda will stop all duping to where zero legendary items are duped.
---
It's Luck, unlocked at level 50.
---
I think I missed an opportunity to dress in wild man rags and use a bone club
---
I need it
---
How do you guys run so many at once and still manage your health? I would think you’d burn theo CJ stimpaks faster than boiled water 
---
The gold cards are animated version if you haven’t noticed. Would be cool to collect all of them. If they were to implement a system like OP is talking about it would have to be a trade off system because some of us(myself included) use multiple ranks of different cards for different load outs. 
---
For instance I might trade travelling pharmacy 3 for rank 2 so I can have bear arms rank 1 to use a heavy gun. But when I run commando with rifles I might want the rank 3 travelling pharmacy instead. 
---
IMO there’s way more useless crap they could give us an outlet for over spare perk cards. Like maybe bulking and selling ammo.
---
I've made a couple of playlists to listen to on Spotify when I play based on what I'm doing in the game. It's been infinitely better than listening to the exact same thing
---
I'm guessing your CAMP is in a really popular spot then? 
---
I've had the float thing happen while building. I don't know what causes it and what fixes it, but I've had it follow me through log offs, and even powering down and back up. I'm surprised it hasn't been addressed yet. 
---
I admit going against the SBQ with a single handed weapon isn't ideal, until it lands. Although if you use all the single handed melee increase perks and the twisted muscle mutation, it really does make it comparable to two handed swords. So it may do like 10-20 damage less than a two handed sword, but you can usually get 2 or more single handed hits in the time it takes for one hit of a two handed sword. I'm comparing between my build, single handed build obviously, and a friend who has the two handed perks. The damage is close but I can usually get more hits in, doing more damage.
---
OP already writes just like the President, his theory might be true.
---
I dont think they will be able to remove the duped items. Unless every item has an unique ID but i doubt that. 
---
Right.  They dont represent the capabilities of the real to life weapons. 
---
The patch notes probably seemed anemic because there were no patch notes, because there wasn't a patch.
---
If you unequip and re-equip a piece of armor you'll become visible. Happens to me constantly
---
What even is that last question?
---
Of course I run down the middle, in PA. Making train noises myself.
---
Thanks. I'll have a look. I coulnd't find it the other day but I get lost easily.
---
What rank of luck?
---
I like having 3/2/1 of most cards for various builds since we can't break them down.
---
With that said.......
---
The picklock and hacker cards in all of my card packs is a slap in the face.
---
Grenadier, tenderizer,better critical, demo,stabilized, adrenaline,four leaf, is ok in especially if you're in a fight with enemies and players get a critical it's 6400 instead of 3200
---
Dude, as a trader I spend a great deal of my time running people through the trade window and letting them get accustomed to it. Basically no, most people don't know what's up with the trade menu until you go up to them and give them a reason to interact with it. 
---
Or better yet... you drop all weapons and armor upon death, but not your junk... you'll need that to craft new stuff =P
---
Make this place a true king of the hill.
---
And please figure out a way to not screw us out of achievements on a character during beta!! 
---
LOL..... just read this after I posted the exact same thing.
---
Glad it helped 😁
---
Im on PC and no longer see it as an option since the last update. 
---
Yeah I thought the same thing so I fast traveled around until I found a rather secluded spot kinda far away from everything else and still couldn't build.  It was flat, no reason to be floating. I turned my CAMP in every direction I could and went all around my circle and couldn't get the floating to go away.  
---
I also wonder if it's because I have a one foundation only build?
---
Next time I'm just going to keep logging out and back on until I can find a server that will let me place my CAMP lol
---
Hopefully they can fix it soon.
---
Here you go:
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Super_Duper/Fallout_76
---
Where is he though, haven’t found him yet?
---
Hey man without this list I would've been so soo lost on the market. Thanks so much for this!
---
Using it for 2 weeks now
---
&gt; Also, the atom shop is terrible. Whoever is leading that design team needs to be demoted and forced to play some fallout before they come back to work. 
---
They should be fired without hesitation.
---
lol ob last question. I never thought of that to be honest.
---
Just make your own fun. Get busy with something 
---
I'm not trying to at that the general opinion of people here does not have merit in and of itself. It absolutely does.
---
But I've been seeing an awful lot of posts making sweeping generalizations about the playerbase to further their agenda, and I just wanted to point out that just by posting here you are pretty much acknowledging that you *aren't* speaking for the majority of players.
---
If you can't see how duped items effect an online game with other people then it doesn't matter.
---
Its no a pretend economy though is it, its the economy without Fallout 76 the game were all playing. Yes its within a game world but it still exists and every item created / duped effects that economy in one way or another. It's pretty simple stuff but hey ho its ok not to under stand something :)
---
Thanks I have most of the 51 just missing right leg. like I said I'm fairly new to this I'm still doing the overseers log. And I am stuck on the stupid basic training military camp thing I can't seem to do the obstacle course for the firing range fast enough I just got to that alpha spot in the responders thing.  I've been going to the top of the world back and forth and move my camp near it so that I could Farm aluminum and random things. I'm now on the hunt for a place to Farm Sim screws as the 200 or so I had we're gone in my epic fail to figure out how to move camp and building it over and over.  I enjoy this game a lot I came from playing save the world which I still play the majority of the time but as I've Max My level there. There's less for me to do so I started to play this more.  I still don't understand some of the guns. I'm holding onto stuff that's level 45 and 50 that weighs 20 lb that I probably shouldn't.  I got a war drum... I don't know if it's that rare or not but it look cool. But 20 lb is a lot.  Oh and acid.  I guess I used it up bulking all my ore and such.  Gotta figure out that too. First time really playing Fallout I feel like such a noob
---
Not even close.
---
I'll still use them
---
It would be great to allow non player usable objects to clip a small amount into the ground also. That way you could place fences or whatever through the ground. While we are at it let us change the axis tilts too. I just want place anywhere mod...
---
I know it's been used in the US military at least as far back as the late 90s.
---
I barely carry any of these with me anymore. After we found out about ghoulish and rad sponge sharing you're almost Invincible in Blast zones.
---
Fortunately still have to drink water and eat food once in awhile but I've spent hours in White Springs without using any rad away or stimpacks.
---
That would essentially mean adding in game effects to Atom store items. I am sure not many people will be ok with that. However, buffs from matching armor sets may not be a bad idea. It could provide an incentive for repairing armor.
---
To be honest it doesn't seem that Bethesda had it in their mind when they gave use the ability to place a CAMP anywhere. I get there can be only up to 24 players on one server but the amount of times I had to move my base because someone else took up residents is getting costly. 24 designated spots would help because at least you can choose what's free and your CAMP will just fit any 24 spots. Otherwise you  either have to give people the ability to assigned servers or assigned spots. I know that i get the free move if I remain on the server but that means i have to find that spot right then or i won't have access to my stuff in my CAMP. just a pain is all!!!
---
Because you can stack 1000 defensive bubbleheads making you immortal.
---
Antibiotics and Disease Cure are the same aren't they? They weigh 0.25 regardless. If I'm wrong please tell me as I've had a rough week and not been able to play more than 30 minutes.
---
Repetitive and dedicated pre-nerf whitesprings farming.
---
That's the only way.
---
Don’t ever run on the tracks bro.....when that train finally comes through ur toast 
---
Anemic pre-patch notes? My point is that they are not meaningful changing the game at that point. Unless I'm way off my mark, one guy could make those fixes in a 2 week span. I'm not a programmer by any means, but those aren't complicated mechanics since the systems already exist, and are probably just missing an item tag or database entry.
---
As it stands now, hell no. There will duping galore. They need to shut down 99.94% of all duping before they even start that beta. 
---
How though? Leaderboards and statistic rankings are in many, many games. Minecraft, State of Decay, Assassin's Creed, and many other non-pvp oriented games have leaderboards. 
---
Oh fun...
---
Anecdotal evidence: I've been playing this game a ton since December (it feels like) and I'm still only level 41. (Is there a way to check your in-game hours?)
---
I've discovered and cleared every location in the Forrest, Toxic Valley, Ash Heap and Divide (working on the Mire). 
---
I've just hit the "Defiance has fallen" quest. 
---
I have done almost every side quest so far, have claimed and defended public work benches tons of times and have done about 10-15 "public events." 
---
I have a few friends who play, too, and most of them are around level 30.  
---
LOVE the open wall looking on the waterfall! But why so many Mr. Pebbles posters?
---
Fully acknowledge that. I'm an odd duck who like FO3 over NV. Love the idea; just scared I'll have to buy my Nuka-Girl outfit and greaser jacket a 'third' time. That's the one part I wouldn't get excited for.
---
Two things, your ign if your PC so I can KoS you, and screw you dumbass. The fact that you do believe that fresh start will put the casual players in a better, not a worse position, for me is a clear indication that both your understanding of sociology, of competition and of online gaming economy is nonexistent. I do believe I am talking with a person without intellectual capabilities to understand the words that they are receiving, nor the consequences of their own ignorance, but I do not really care, because it will not change the end result, which is that noobs will complain the game is bad because they are bad at it, and this is what you are. A noob.

To clarify, fresh start is a situation by which every competitor starts from the same point and have equal chances of reaching the top, and its not possible to achieve in a game where some people are knowledgeable and organised in groups while the others are not. Instead of living in a dream world where taking out other people characters will somehow solve intricate problems this game currently has, and not postpone them by a week only to make them more severe, I suggest you really think about this topic for a longer while. But until the source of these problems, and not the symptoms, are fixed, your whole point is proof of your own ignorance, and here is a protip and a last thing I am willing to say to somebody who is clearly so bad at considering the consequences: even formatting the whole players database and removing every single dupe item and every stack of bobbleheads would not solve those problems. Just postpone them for a week.
---
Damn. Really had no idea that it was that extreme of a process. Thanks for the info.
---
Yeah that's fair. I just felt like it stood out from the rest of the examples haha.
---
Wait Bethesda lied to us about giving us new content every week? Well are you really that surprised? 
---
I've started helping the people in the silos. I can solo one in about 15 min, but I never do because I seem to have a 50/50 chance of getting kicked within a minute of launching the nuke. 
---
That seems a lot more like the random hilarity that I enjoy about this game as opposed the griefing. 
---
You don't fire a creative director like that. It's bad business. They're obviously talented and  have a skilled team. They're just not in touch with fallout as a game world.
---
Especially when you notice they went behind cover to go rogue.
---
My issue with the nerf is that they're over correcting and breaking them in the opposite direction.  Everyone has made it clear that eliminating the 2 shot and exploding together is the answer. Make them mutually exclusive.  Instead we're making the 2 shots worthless while exploding is still going to be broken with perks and bobblehead stacking.
---
I didn’t rush through anything and I have done literally every main and side quest in the game. I’ve been to 90% of locations and read the terminals/notes for the little stories. I’ve nuked the queen a hundred times. There’s nothing else to do. 
---
Ya I recommend not holding onto stuff that's more than 5-10 levels ahead, unless they're a really great legendary drop. And if you're rebuilding your Camp, try Storing items instead of scrapping and rebuilding.
---
But other than that, don't feel like you're falling behind in the quests. Everybody does em at their own pace, especially because a bunch of it is non-linear lol
---
Good luck out there in Appalachia 😃
---
People seem to not understand well what the R in RNG stands for.
---
Will try out moving/rotating the CAMP unit.  Unfortunately usually the first few fast travels are in rocks or cliff sides, and completely immobalizing my character.  So not sure there is anyway to accommodate that with building components.
---
Thanks for info!
---
It is kinda of week, your missing the bit though where they said MORE DETAILS to come.
---
We have been given a couple of bullet points to whet our whistle and try and deflect from the fact that fix's and content is taking to long to come out (ya'know normal PR bs).
---
Once all the info has been released it might (i say might due it being Bethesda) make more sense to everyone :)
---
Two players getting together to easily complete/cheat an objective is boosting. Dying multiple times on purpose to be revived is boosting. It's no different than tactical insertions in CoD with a friend on the enemy team to unlock a camo. Boosting is cheating the system. 
---
Why don’t you just stay in your  “adventure mode” safe space?
---
TSE Weapons will be nerfed before this goes live
---
This limited time crap needs to end, I'm not going to log on every day just to check the atomic shop, and I'd like to be able to get it when I have the money.
---
Much appreciated.
---
Well, this approach is exactly why we have what we have.
---
Stealthboy is my favorite but I haven’t heard of any in FO76. Sure they exist, but yeah none.  
---
This is for my excavator armor so I can haul tons of stuff un nuke zones.  
---
I’ve gravitated to melee due to my characters high STR.  but I’m a vats stealth sniper at heart from FO4.  I use VATS a bit too much since I’m not the greatest first person shooter. 
---
Well as the saying goes "never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity"
---
They probably didn't even think about it, the game is full of stuff that doesn't hold up to scrutiny.
---
&gt;I didn’t realise the stats were so low. I classify myself as a half noob/ half okish player at level 88 I have launched many nukes, SBQ fights so it baffles me what people are moaning about if they haven’t done any of these.
---
That's what I'm saying though; the people complaining about there here aren't the large % of people that haven't done that, but the small % that have.
---
You, who still feel like a half-noob relative to this community, are part of the top 5% of players in this game in terms of progress. *That's* how big the gap between the average Reddit player and the average player is.
---
What’s tagging? 
---
https://gifs.ninja/play.html?a=TaDzJ8R.mp4
---
I think PA and Hazmat has a hidden 90% rad resist. Because in PA with 500 rad resist i take just a small portion of radiation. Withoug PA i managed to get my rad redist to 450 via Rad-X and RadShield and i was takjng radiation like crazy.
---
By cowboy hat I just meant the Black Cowboy Hat mostly, DEFINITELY NOT any atom shop items, totally agree with that
---
&gt; Two things, your ign if your PC so I can KoS you, and screw you dumbass
---
Lol, you're hilarious
---
&gt; The fact that you do believe that fresh start will put the casual players in a better, not a worse position, for me is a clear indication that both your understanding of sociology, of competition and of online gaming economy is nonexistent.
---
blah blah blah, a fresh start is the only answer - anything less than that is a total trainwreck. There is no debate here.
---
&gt; To clarify, fresh start is a situation by which every competitor starts from the same point and have equal chances of reaching the top, and its not possible to achieve in a game where some people are knowledgeable and organised in groups while the others are not.
---
Again, you have demonstrated you have NO CLUE what people want and what a fresh start is. I cannot have a conversation with someone as dense as you are being right now. 
---
&gt; Two things, your ign if your PC so I can KoS you, and screw you dumbass.
---
Still laughing at this though lol, are you 12? Who says shit like this to sound tough hahaha. 
---
I usually just throw PA on at whitesprings. For the queen, you can nuke the fissure and make it to where you can fight her outside the blast zone. Even for PA I run rad sponge with my team. 
---
Oh wow cool man. Thank you I almost have a complete set of that I will definitely make sure I keep that one. I was using what I had of raider armor in the prison. When I got to the courtyard I got destroyed by the slaughter of super mutants that were my same level. I can take a couple of them but when there's like seven or eight of them constantly firing there automatics at you I didn't have enough time for the stimpacks to kick in. I figured with this armor and a couple of psychos or buff out and one of my bobbleheads I should be able to do it I just hit 25 last night was planning on finding a helmet and repairing my armor before attempting it. The perk thing still gets me to one of the first ones I got was the cannibal 1 I use that a lot for food but it's a pain in the butt if you're in power armor cuz you got to get out
---
And was sufficiently unstable and bug ridden enough to easily be classified as Early Access/Late Alpha.
---
Show stopping bugs mean your software is not fit for purpose and is not ready for use by your customers. I know the gaming industry has a lot of people conned into believing that "software development is just like this" but no, its fucking not.
---
Does software generally ship with some bugs? Sure. But are those bugs the same show stopping, function killing bugs from versions released years ago, added back to new revisions? No. No they are not. Because in any other industry, this is completely unacceptable. Software developers whose customers are smart enough to care about quality dont behave this way, because they know they would lose customers. 
---
No its not scary, i just dont think legendaries have a place in PVP
---
Probably selling the serums.
---
Second floor, around the dance floor, side area. Should help you
---
I have been gin 5 professional plumber cards... 3 were animated
---
No, we have what we have because the people above them are providing the wrong guidance. They want fortnite money so they're doing fortnite things. This isn't fortnite, and most of us don't want fortnite things.
---
If PC I'll even show you
---
Isn't the clean space suit atom shop only?
---
Didn’t even know that was a thing. Guess you learn something new every day.

Tells Beth not to listen to players.
---
Proceeds to tell Beth what needs to be done.
---
Naw, just rambling because I am to stay awake after only an hour of sleep. It is awesome that the OP took the time to write it up and make a video. I meant to put that in there also. Yes, I got lucky af, but I spend most of my time grinding anyway and end up selling bulk amounts of everything but lead, acid, springs, and plastic. 
---
Well, you are the one here who came here to make a statement, it's up to you to cite your sources...
---
I stopped playing when I couldn't leave my power armor. I started again after they fixed that bug. The more I play the game, the more I see that it's pretty brilliant. The design, locations, quests, leveling, social aspect are all really cool. I'm not the kind of person to hook an MMO straight to my veins for 3 thousand hours so I'm not expecting an infinite dopamine treadmill. It's fun to play alone, fun to interact with others. Exploring is great. There are some really annoying bugs but nothing game breaking and overall more fun than not. After 100 hours it's still fun, isn't that about right for a AAA game?
---
Shit if that’s the case then I might as well just stop playing now and wait until the new mode launches. Wtf is the point of building my current character? 
---
The prima guide? You probably wouldn’t get a response since they went bust shortly after publishing it.
---
Saw a guy in Harpers Ferry last night - Clown costume + gas mask.  That was about as creepy as I care to see.
---
Nope, you buy that from the roaming responder bot friend
---
Bugs mean nothing. If the content is there, them the bugs mean quite literally nothing
---
Every time I try to make a post it's always removed weather it's cuz the subject too short or I new it's happened 6 times now smh I'm just looking for a lvl 45 or 50 10 mm pistol or smg preferably msg perfect storm lvl 50 or whatever is closer
---
All cores are at 20-30%
---
I re read and I think I might understand. It was the f2p thing that threw me off.
---
What he’s saying is there is a terminal in the enclave that has information about being president and whatnot. 
---
He theorized this was future content, now however he thinks it’s in the game now and we’ve all overlooked it. 
---
OP suspects this would give you advanced access to the nuke codes each week.
---
Any of this making sense?
---
My dude needs some punctuation, really hard to follow
---
&gt;Is there a way to check your in-game hours?
---
Should be in your achievements page, there's progress bar for the "7600 Hours" achievement.
---
The point of slap damage appears to be just to allow griefers to start something while allowing the other player enough time to decide how to respond: server hop, shoot back, run.
---
They obviously need to increase the damage reduction because there’s too many one-shot wombats running around now.
---
How many hours did you get out of the game before it was boring?
---
A lot of people, even people who post on this sub, play the game maybe 120 minutes max a week. Including your "I've been playing since the beta and I'm only level 23 so stop rushing and enjoy the ride" types.
---
So it doesn't surprise me that so few players are 50+, they appear to be the target audience.
---
Ya that'd be time consuming, the cannibalism thing lol
---
This builder is pretty cool
---
There is no debate with fuckers who say that theres no debate. Nick or gtfo. Mines same as here.
---
Your missile launcher will break before the cargobot is down.
---
Well I found him outside the golf club so I think your right on the money.
---
Um u dont have to make a new guy
---
All of it 😂
---
I'm actually anticipating it, in a way.
---
It'll bring back the excitement of running into people, not knowing initially if they're friend or foe. At the moment, best that happens is that to randoms will save at eachother and keep going on their merry little way.
---
Survival mode will incentivize players to use different approaches, at least at first. Players might sneak up on eachother, making use of stealth bonuses or snipers more often. Maybe they'll make more of an effort to the portrayal of a trader, as to not get shot. Etc etc.
---
Same boat right here. 
---
Go to your safe space buddy. The worlds to crazy for you!
---
While I don’t think you are the only one, you are most likely in the minority. But it doesn’t matter because I don’t think Bethesda will change anything so you’ll get your way anyway.
---
Sharing/trading blueprints is a cool idea. Right now, you can kind off 'share' your blueprint with a friend, that is, you can build your blueprint in a friend's camp. But trading blueprints would be nice too. Kind off could give rise to a player role as an architect.
---
So, it does 250% damage as opposed to 400%?
---
Thanks but PS4. At least I can narrow down my search now.
---
Hey Bethesda, don't give us what we're asking for, fix the problems that are making us ask. Behave like you have dozens of people who specializes in making games that are fun and engaging on staff. Understand fundamental game mechanics, and how people interact with them.
---
Ah. I see.
---
I knew there were animated cards, I just didn’t know if they add anything more than that. If they don’t, that would be a nice added feature. Like with hacking maybe make it so you automatically hack terminals that are level 0. Something like that. 
---
It would be cool to collect them all though. 
---
Most TSE users may not be duper’s but their guns almost certainly are duped, bought/traded from dupers. Yeah, you aren’t a drug dealer, but 99% chance you’re buying their product. 
---
Today is when I discovered there was a character limit.
---
Yeah, stop drawing these stupid guns, I want a cloche hat by the end of the day!
---
Not sure you're right, but I got your point :)
---
I am the lawr! (Imitating stalone)
---
No matter what that person was selling it’s odd behavior. Lol. 
---
Yes but many are advocating to have to make a new guy. I was just giving my opinion on the matter.
---
I use demo max, grenadier figured out that helps mirv mod, tenderizer, better critical, four leaf, adrenaline, stabilized,lock and load, ordinance express, bondolier , fires close to auto grenade launcher, with better critical damage can climb to 6400 instead of 3200
---
I keep junk on me, but springs and screws go right into the stash.
---
Umm you seem to be missing the very valid points im making. None of which imply that its okay that people duped items. In fact I have stated that it is a shame that it ruined the game for PVE. The point I'm making is that it had no effect in PVP WHATSOEVER. Dupers or not I would need to account for tse in my build. So its an invalid selling point when we are arguing for fresh servers to reset "balance". You also keep bringing up the economy? Please tell me how your economy has anything to do with PVP? Again thats a passive mode warrior problem. Sorry cheaters ruined your PVE experience, but now you want to start over and PVP and Im supposed to start over as well so you feel better Right I'm the selfish one..
---
Ok lets start off to let you know I am not stupid, so lets take this who "Economy" thing apart:
---
"Its noT a pretend economy though is it" - Its not? So this effects the stock market? The price of coffee goes up? Gas prices go thru the roof? NO, its a fake economy! If you get more caps can you pay your light bill or buy Groceries? NO! So its a pretend economy caps are not real currency so there is no economy that is real.
---
I DO ubderstand the point people are trying to make but obviously people do not realize that that is no real life effect on how many caps people are making.
---
 Duping is someone using a exploit and its shitty that people need to do that, but has it devalued the weapons? Hell no people are still selling these things for crazy fake currency.
---
So please explain to me (because I understand clearly the point people try to make about the fake economy) how the Fallout 76 cap amount that people do or do not make effect the REAL world!
---
Ok do your complaining about something they haven't even done yet and don't intend to do? smh
---
I think legendary effects should be taken out altogether, but that’s probably too extreme for the average player.
---
There's also a lot we don't know about the mode. Will you be able to fast travel with other players around, or will they count as enemies?
---
What's to stop me from just ALT+F4'ing or returning to Main Menu if someone is about to kill me?
---
Open PVP is all well and good, but without an intelligent set of rules then yeah, it's just going to be a complete mess.
---
50 caps per serum?  I have all of the mutations (organically), but I would absolutely buy bunch to give to friends at that price.  
---
&gt; Still laughing at this though lol, are you 12? Who says shit like this to sound tough hahaha.
---
&gt; Nick or gtfo. 
---
Hahahahaha this has the exact opposite effect of sounding tough, just fyi 
---
Me to
---
I run around in my Santa outfit with the large extended gas mask, and a super sledge.  I definitely get 2nd looks.
---
Yeah, I have been more conscious of checking it now, I haven't got a game since I mentioned it, in about five visits. &lt;shrugs&gt; . But yeah, a mag per visit ain't bad either.
---
Stop victim blaming. Yeah, the fact that you can dupe needs to be fixed. The fact that I can probably break into your house and steal your shit also sucks, but would society blame you for having a house I can break in to, or blame me for choosing to break in to it?
---
I got this Nuka-Grape for you, found this c*** sucker in the tresh can outside the super-duper mart.
---
Thank you. And thanks to this subreddit it's nice to see some helpful people.
---
I made a post about this issue a while back. It was horribly written though (and downvoted like hell).  
---
This mode is going to suck, and if it has any effect it's going to drop the player base even further, even if people wanted to PvP, with the current promise there will be invincible players and one shotting players.  
---
Whooptiedoo better roll a new survival character to feel abused again.
---
Molotovs as long as no one has demo perk everyone should be able to get a hit, it's how I use to do whitesprings nuke farms just Chuck it in there and let it go.
---
Basically two the left behind the bar with the bartender.
---
Bethesda themselves have said that this survival mode isn't the only thing coming out in March. What it is I don't know, but it's not just pvp.
---
There are mutation Serums you can purchase from the Enclave bunker science wing after you complete that quest line and gain access. They are expensive. Once you take it, you are guaranteed that particular mutation. There are also serum recipes that are random event loot drops, extremely rare. Once you have a recipe, you can then craft your own serums to take or sell. 
---
Me too, I have 4 chars right now but two of them are still under L 10
---
Bro you can stack armor and perks to make yourself immpossuble to kill to. Chances are you've never even seen someone stacking bobbleheads. Just Pure PVPers with optimized builds.
---
If they put quest holotapes at the top, that'd help too.
---
I run marsupial and healing factor because that was the hand I was dealt.
---
Gotcha sorry. Just a suggestion so no hating please,
---
Check your hardware and software specs to see if there’s any updates you’re missing.
---
Great info!  
---
It doesn't seem to cause CTD's for everyone, but it is for enough that I saw a couple dozen threads in the last few days about it which helped inspire the research.  
---
Thanks, what settings are you running the game at?
---
Silent majority is with you.
---
Ppl since before release were against alts and they'll continue to be going forward.
---
Class freak + starched genes perk cards in luck.
---
It is most definitely broken. It should not transmit power until the number after your set number is reached, but it transmits power at all times.
---
Resetting the number on a terminal is not reflected on the counter, either. 
---
Instanced 'dungeons' would be cool.  
---
Its meant as an early game solution, of course i will get the perk in the long run.
---
And they did already say when you die you reapawn at your camp or vault 76
---
Hey, this guy offering me a brand new iPhone XR for $150 seems shady, but I don’t like to assume, so I’m going to go ahead and buy it. 
---
Is now...  
---
Totally forgot to add it in my excitement last night!
---
I think the only way would have been to have every item spawned into the world create a unique ID. Even I that case it's questionable if dupes would have copied the ID of their parent or would have been considered a new spawn.
---
Fallout botched this big time.
---
I didnt get the perk card so far :/
---
you have to keep crafting and destroying em haha
---
I did initially but everyone I try to kill runs off or logs out. The game's 24 player server architecture doen't lend itself to pvp at all with a map that size, for me.
---
Well you could go ahead and toss assassin if that was the case.
---
That’s not a bad idea, for cards that are tough to balance add a small increase in the effect if it’s gold. 
---
Like tank killer gold could give an extra 1% armor pen.
---
Nothing broken just a little extra for putting time in.
---
As cool as some of the effects are, I would really like this idea. Like Ultima Online's early days, and how some DND rulesets work. Your weapons and armor are fairly basic but serviceable and easily acquirable. 
---
Losing, for example if full looting were in effect, a complete set of combat armor and a combat rifle would suck. But it's not going to make me quit the game, it's not going to cripple my character. There will be a bit of a grind, but I can always go farm more resources and craft another set. Meanwhile X-01 armor is going to be much more painful to lose, however it's also going to offer significantly better DR than some non-legendary armor.
---
I sell all my rad-x as I dont like my mutations being suppressed. Does radshield suppress mutations? I haven't even experimented with it.
---
Recipes drop which allows you to craft them.
---
They take 3 stable fluxes and some other mats, very easy to come by when you ran out of things to do awhile ago and 1lb per stable flux is taking up too much space.
---
if you can deal with rad suits, sure. Not much armor there, though. You'd be better off changing cards just before a nuke happens
---
Are you talking about bubbles? Also I would not risk it, one oops pass a person who turned on the whitesprings bunkers decontamination station and there goes your muts.
---
Exactly, that guy's off his rocker if he thinks that it's good game design for TSE's even post-nerf to be able to easily out-dps a Bloodied Fatman while using ammo that weighs a fraction of his even if he uses Ordnance Express and they skip out on Bandolier. That's just a sad joke of what could be a decent weapon.
---
NOT EVEN ONCE
---
Probably duped then. Or maybe he has too much caps and all mutations.
---
&gt; I’ve been to **90%** of locations
---
&gt;There’s **nothing else** to do.
---
Yeah I've done that a bunch even though I'm running a glass cannon I have been pretty survivable with the prototype hazmat suit but my build relies a lot on my armor and weapon effects.
---
Doing minimal damage to mobs to get xp or drop credit on kill outside of teams
---
I did that but role-playing as Jason from Friday the 13th. I was hiding in the flowers just to the left of where you spawn in at by the Golf Clubhouse. Someone spawned in and I stood up staring right at them and they were clearly surprised. Good times.
---
That's the real kicker, how they're putting this up as if it is a content update as if it didn't involve just changing a few lines of code and adding UI options to the main menu. AND we're not even seeing any of this until the end of March. Looks more and more like the vaults were cut content rather than future planned content...
---
I wouldn't mind if Bethesda made survival mode where everyone's character is reseted. It'll fix the duper problem for sure right off the geckgo and now that they have a system to detect who's Duplicating BOOM they'll get banned.  
---
As far as from your first statement no there isn't going to be a character reset whatever you had in your adventure mode will be transferred along with everything you have In that build.
---
and trading you can just post a discord group and find some players to do some trading. 
---
Ah ok. I thought u were saying u had to. My bad
---
Its a nice idea but I mean its a f-in mini nuke... Actual nukes devastate entire country's\city's... The description of a mini nukes damage potential is 
---
"as rare as it is powerful." 
---
I understand its a game so it can't be a one hit kill but honestly mini nukes base damage should easily be 100% armor penetrating excluding pa or lead lined armor obviously and do at least 1500 damage. Just in fallout 76. Its so underwhelming and needs a huge buff imo.
---
That's straight up false.  I recognized the area as soon as I stepped in and then new right where to go For Armour.
---
I'm all of two days in game and first time in that area.
---
If you don't know, why even post dude.
---
I think FO4 put the blips above the enemy's head but I can't really remember.
---
Cute ! Would definitely buy if there's one like this.
---
While you're totally right and most people are carrying way more than we need the problem is the problem is we don't really have a way to store extra equipment. I've got maybe a dozen weapons, hundreds of cosmetic clothing, one of each bobblehead and magazine, and a small amount of each junk I'm my stash.
---
I'd love to store a lot of my crap like drugs, secondary armor, and ammo I'm not currently using at the moment but I'm completely out of room to do so. So the next best thing is to use those associated weight perks so I don't just have to get rid of them
---
 toon= character 
---
It’s my legacy wow term I use. Too lazy to keep writing characters lolz
---
Now i can finally start buying plans. :)
---
Marsupial, or with Class Freak pretty much everything (except herd and herbivore) is probably the way to go.
---
You know, you are def. correct on this.
---
They are like 36 caps? Im playing solo, and i am level 31. got marsupial at 20 and pulled trough till 25 with minimum health. Was a fun challenge itself lol. I was just so happy when i found bubbles  and the nuka grape. This tip is intended for low levels without the perk. Maybe i should habe clarified that...
---
Yeah, we’re just the Sims with guns. 
---
Yea I've seen a few threads about it now, and it's always ps4 users. Hopefully Beth will squash it in this next patch 
---
I meant in conjunction with adding a PvP mode, not just leaderboards themselves. I have no issue with the idea of adding leaderboards, I just think it's an indication of where they were going to try to take PvP mode.
---
I hope you find some fun people to play with.  It really does add to the game and make it not feel so lonely.  Plus they might be able to point you to things you wouldn't have noticed like hidden car-henges and holotape trails.  
---
Have you done a cost value matrix?  
---
Never thought of that. I will try it next time I’m on. Thanks!
---
Targeting HUD is pretty great, it works most of the time. Sometimes you will have a mixed bag of stuff highlighted stuff not highlighted and sometimes just the enemy's weapon highlighted.
---
Thanks! I was thinking I didn't have enough
---
Marsupial, Speed Demon, Healing Factor, Chameleon.
---
The first two is pretty self-explanatory, marsupial makes areas accessible that would not normally be. So on a ranged build you can hop up to an area that a scary melee cannot access and it quickly devolves into a firefight. Carry weight increase is a bonus. Speed demon increases movement speed significantly (encumbered movement is painful), and reload time. Sprinting/Jumping while consuming canned coffee and sugar eiminates the need to stop and take a breath.
---
Healing Factor just straight up saves on stims. I would imagine it would also help out when mutation farming. When out of combat and getting radiation, dropping a Radaway is nicer when you don't have to eat food or use a heal to get back up to full.
---
Chameleon works out pretty nice with the maiden of mysteries set. (My alt is imaged after my wife) The set looks god awful so it serves a dual purpose since I don't have to look at it most of the time when switching out armor to put that garb on. - I wish the fabricator allowed for the outfits look to be changed. 
---
Since there's mutations that lower carry weight that I want to avoid I just do a sell run every night and end up buying the enclave serums.
---
Ya even with quad launcher and tracking the dmg output is just freaking horrible. 
---
build gun, scrap gun, repeat.
---
I’m not complaining, I’m begging them to stick with their plans.
---
If you play Xbox we can team up and I’ll share starched genes plus I like running with lower levels.
---
Really need to pick up a new computer this year for X4. Egosoft has their ups and downs, but their post-launch support for their games runs circles around Bethesda.
---
People, for some reason, like to try and shut down discussions like this but it's the truth: This game needs more end-game content. End-game content is what keeps people coming back to the game, not exploring, not taking your time smelling the mutfruit, end-game content.
---
Let's be honest, the people who answer requests for more end-game content with "you shouldn't have rushed, the game has plenty to explore" won't be here for the long run. They'll explore the poi's, have their fill and then move on to another game. End-game content is what sustains a game's community, and maintains daily logins.

The first time I saw him in the game was similar to opening a present on a Christmas morning.
---
It was a moment so wholesome, I can't even describe it.. in a land of lost hope and constant struggles, where you learn of good people sacrificing their lives for a glimpse of a better future on every step, this was such a revelation to see a living soul that's actually NOT hostile.
---
I'd very much love to see him again, but I think it still should be somewhat spontaneous.. still possible through an event of some sort though, be that a radio-signal, where the host is Chally the Moo-Moo or a signal of some other sort (flair, like someone suggested in the comments)!
---
I don't think it'd feel right if we had a strict quest, that would lead us to him... but may be we could find clues like manure or something, and that would give us possible locations of Grahm's temporary camps? Then it would still FEEL random, but we would get more chances of meeting him.
---
Didn’t even think of that! Yea that would be way better 
---
I plan on doing the Nuka Cola paint side quest this weekend.  I just hit Level 50, and yesterday attempted to do the BoS Mission toward Prime Fissure and Glass Cavern with my two teammates (Level 40s).  We made it thru 4 scorch beats and right outside the Glass Cavern at the bunker transponder.  And it just got too much for us.  We ran out of Fusion Cores, and while they could barely touch me in my modded T60 armor there were 3 Scorched Beasts still flying around blasting us with Screeches non stop, making it all but impossible to see / target.  No power for the PAs made us unable to VATs or do anything but crawl around.  But if we stepped out of our PAs we would be very vulnerable to the toxic gas and rads from the Beasts.
---
We ended up retreating.  Now we are going to spend the weekend recovering our supplies, leveling up, getting new weapons/armors.  I'm going to do the Watoga quest to get that "All Rise" and then the Nuka Paint, and try to find a higher level T51b (my current is the level 30 version).
---
Next time we will be more prepared to fight our way thru waves of Scorched Beasts.  We weren't prepared at all this time, but still made it thru 4 of them.  Just wish they didn't spawn so much (though, it is the Prime Fissure location).
---
Don't care to trade. I rather drop a bag then deal with the trade interface. I never usually have anything worthwile to trade either because I sell everything or drop it to lower level players.
---
That is funny, but also disturbing.
---
How does it devalue them? Kinda like all the supposed "duping" going on so there are thousands of weapons out that that are selling between 5000 and 18000 caps?
---
People who use exploits in game to play it are shitty, but how does that effect your gameplay? It doesnt!
---
I know I know, the server gets laggy sometimes and I get CTD blah blah blah, we have all heard it over and over again even thou no one truly know if that is the case
---
No offense intended towards you or anyone else but reality is if people stopped worrying about what everyone else is doing and just play thier game, a lot of this noise would stop!
---
The game has no dedicated servers, they are in the "cloud" dynamically allocated and destroyed as the gods of Amazon see fit.
---
Yeah, I get it. That's why I'm not asking for specifics or dates. If they are working on a new instance, that is something that I want to know.
---
Agreed, especially mini nukes. At 6lbs each they should pretty much kill anything short of a SBQ or legendary Mirelurk Queen.
---
Also it shouldn't require perk investment to do so. Like how do you get better at launching a nuke?
---
Only kinda relevant but there has to be a possibility that resources that would go into creating pvp wouldn't interfere with pve development, especially if it is just the same game with no slap damage / wanted system. 
---
That seems to be the only thing you are worried about is the economy. Which has no bearing on in game balance.
---
Spoiled fruit?
---
Think he will stop griefing? Lolz
---
What platform are you on? I'm on PC and I've seen the combat load vs. Loot load happen with a lot of bad guys, I've never seen it on the SBQ and I've been in on dozens of kills including 4 today. Now, it's TRUE that one she lands I switch from heavy to melee and I'm up close and personal, but I've been debating hanging back to let others enjoy getting under her belly... if this is happening I'll stay up close!
---
Don't get me wrong, I love the game. I'm just a bit bored of it
---
That’s what I thought. He was very insistent on me buying them and was willing to part with them at any price. I figured if he was following me around and advertising, they were probably duped. 
---
Yes but me achieving a trophy doesn’t affect other people’s enjoyment or experience. This player base is dying already, don’t report people for trying to get a trophy. There’s people duping, ruining the economy, maxing Bobbleheads to one hit kill, and selling OP guns and items online for cash. There’s many bigger and buggier fish to fry than me trying to get a harmless trophy 
---
It's nice to see speculation about how many copies were sold and seeing numbers like only 10% have dropped a nuke or gotten past level 50, or whatever. The problem is that these numbers don't capture things like how many players have stopped playing the game.
---
Many games have sold millions of copies only to have active player number drop precipitously a month or two after release. And that's without the server instability and glitches this game has.
---
The 200k redditors here may not be the minority you think they are. Do you see as many people on the servers as you did at release? I certainly don't. 
---
Bethesda listens to players here because they want people to stick around past level 50, past 200 hours played, past dropping a nuke. Losing huge numbers shortly after drop is a bad omen. Bringing them back for a couple of hours after a DLC release doesn't help much. Fixing the game and keeping players is the goal.
---
If they can't, nobody will buy the next game.
---
Sucks you're not on ps4 :( Me and my guild have started hosting more and more fight clubs and other random player events for loot and things! They're super fun. Maybe try and find some players and make your own fun! 5 wanted bounties in one spot is bound to bring in some other players as well! 
---
Is it shocking that people quit? I was a Bethesda fanboy and have thousands of hours on their games. I quit this game about 5 days after launch. I keep coming back hoping they fix it. Keep getting disappointed. I haven't uninstalled yet. Not really sure why.
---
/full agreement
---
&gt; NO ONE WANTS STRONGER WEAPON BASHING EFFECTS. It's already too weak to be a viable attack in any fashion, making it stronger is a massive waste of effort that can be much more useful elsewhere.
---
I've been trying to buy an AA Bashing Combat Shotgun for weeks. So at least one person wants it.
---
It shouldn't have resets.
---
I and probably a lot of others wouldn't play if player levels get reset. It's normal that players with a higher level are mostly more experienced and have better equipment. They shouldn't get punished just because a newbie started to play months after the experienced players.
---
A newbie should just practice in the PVE game mode against mobs and other players that accepted PVP.
---
There will be no bounties...like it's the reason the entire mode exist: pvp
---
You are the exact person I expect would want to bring their duped gear OP characters over lol, who honestly says stuff like this? 
---
Rad-X Diluted will not suppress your mutations, just a heads up
---
also watch for the tell tale red glow around NPC's...
---
:) No hate.
---
Been through the steps.  No smoking gun.
---
A very compelling case was made on this sub that some problems may be due to a missing flag on the HUD mod.
---
I never reported anyone or suggested doing so. I for one enjoy doing things legitimately since it's easy enough. 
---
Definitely. The perk cards are essentially taking the place of Bobbleheads and magazines/comics, so a little more incentive on collecting them wouldn’t hurt. 
---
You understand im a pvp melee build on my main character right?
---
How it effects me or the next man is simple. 
---
If 5 guys one shotted a person with a tse that they shouldn't have because they purchased it from a duper or even duped it themselves that's 5 deaths that probably wouldn't have happened without duped items. 
---
The weapons are extremely rare, like i said I've done almost 350 hours and never looted a TSE shotty, lever action or handmade. Easy 50 whitesprings nukes probably more and NEVER seen them drop. They are rocking horse shit in terms of drops.
---
If you go to fo76 bazaar though you can literally see over 200 auctions for them, and then there's ebay as well. 
---
So 350 hours, 50 nuke zones farmed no drops. (tons of other people here on this very sub today have said the same sort of thing). So we can see that these items are in deed very rare, just because a server may have lots of them after a year or two is irrelevant. If Bethesda wanted to kick start the amount of them on a server that's down to them, NOT the players by duping them.
---
Cheaters haven't ruined anything for my pve experience personally, its about the game working correctly and not being abused by idiots.
---
Add player vendor's into the mix and low and behold your going to have the dupers holding the economy hostage and dictating prices / trades etc based of there opinion and ill gotten gains.
---
The effect it has on PVP may not be clear to you, however it is to the game developers for this game and EVERY OTHER online game out there. Pushing it the way you are just makes me think your more worried about being found out and banned or spitting your dummy out of the pram as you have to re level on the new server.
---
Reusing assets happens all the time
---
Grounded so SBQ screech doesn't hurt that much.
---
Speed Demon because AGLs and mini nukes load slow.
---
Scally skin for more general DR because I blow.up alot.
---
Marsupil because I like to get on top of things and grenade below me.
---
Just coming back in six months to a year is a valid way to play the game. I saw the same thing in Wow where people would only subscribe for a month after major updates and then disappear until the next one.
---
Same here, i only used rad-x once to test radiation but i play with a lot of mutations. Rad-X Diluted and RadShield don't surpress mutations. But they are useless even in Power Armor as your Rad Resist Stat is bogus. You take almost the ssme amout of rads with and without them. That hidden resist from PA and Hazmat makes all the difference.
---
Either way I would have to account for tse in my PVP build. So whether everyone has them now or 1 year from now is irrelevent to PVP.
---
#Mr. Dickbutt
---
Good point... I will edit I shouldn't get caught up with the troll
---
I did it to a couple of dupers once. Only I had a stealth boy instead of a red dress. Seen a box that they were dropping items into. I ran over, emptied it and logged out. When I loaded back in, my weight was unreal. Something like 18,000/270. It was all junk, mind you that number reflects the maxed out pack rat too. I jumped into the nearest fissure. I'm sure it hardly affected them. But I felt good. 
---
I'm glad you're within the seemingly small percentage of players who want this, and that you are getting your mode. 
---
I'm just very confused as to why it is a focus, as are many others. 
---
I am 100% in favor of three server types. 
---
Co-op (no PvP/More PvE content), Adventure (current), and Survival (PvP)
---
Marsupial 
---
Speed Demon
---
Healing Factor
---
Scaly Skin
---
Carnivore
---
On a rifle/shotgun build.
---
I guess i'm trying to decide between different receivers and also what effect hip-fire/recoil has in vats?
---
Does the crit dmg+ mod out-perform the hardened receiver with it's outright damage increase?
---
Got most of them perks nailed down. Good to know i'm good there :)
---
I have been. I've been a fallout fan since beginning. Always bought the packages etc.  Its just this game has been a headache.  
---
Define most recent. Most recent who isn’t still around? Cause after a nuke zone, I hung out and shot the shit with one guy for a while, we were the last ones present for a good 10 minutes. Went to add him in friends, he was somewhere around the middle of the list. 
---
Hopefully. Only time will tell
---
I can't remember that mob where were those found at in Fallout 4
---
Takes pegging to a new level.
---
Self objectification is a thing. You’re not doing us as women any favors.
---
It’s the internet, so it’s possible you’re a troll that’s full of shit. Either way, rethink your life.
---
Eastern Regional Penitentiary south east of Grafton has an event where you help a bot patrol the prision. It guarantees you a weapon plan upon completing it, lever action is one of the plans you can get. Server hop and going to the main entrance will trigger the event. 
---
ah good to know
---
I had to tell someone. It was killing me, reading all of the player interaction stories on here. 
---
I heard it on Laughlin Air Force base in the 80’s.
---
Nah just don't like cheats is the main thing for me tbh, and it does have a bearing on balance if you can't see if its ok.
---
If it had no meaning duping items in every other online game where its occurred wouldn't care about it would they and it would't be considered cheating would it?
---
Have Bethesda said its against the rules and they are going to try and ban people for doing it? Yes, because it has a negative impact. Why the hell would anyone want that negative impact on a new server?
---
But ..... Why? On a shotgun no less.
---
Happened to me last night as well [Xbox 1]. I have vats overlay on a t-45 helm and motion assist on my chest. The odd thing was it was lagging my wife's game and not mine. She was getting maybe 5 fps and I was running smooth as butter. As soon as I took it off her game was fine. 
---
I guarantee it's not for technical reasons. We could do it in FO4.  
---
It's probably because they don't want people to name their weapons something foul and then drop them around other players.  
---
The solution to this, of course, is to just make the name visible to the one who named the weapon.
---
&gt; three to 5% players
---
I would like to see a source because that amount is just unbelievable.
---
I love doing something similar although my way may be a bit more malicious. I love seeing the random camps I walk past but if the doors are locked and I can’t get in, I shoot one wall down, walk inside and repair it. 99% of the time they come back while I’m piddling around in their base. But they don’t waste the time getting the caps because I repaired the damage I’ve done. 
---
You are talking about Mama Dulche's. I know exactly where you are talking about even through your vague decription. If you don't get the reference of my previous comment then look it up.
---
They still increased it. The comment I was replying to made it sound like they never did it.
---
I’m not 100% sure how it works. I don’t know if it’s the most recent players in your immediate area, or if it’s the most recent people who hopped on and off the server while you were there. 
---
The game doesn't use servers in a traditional sense, there is no bank of servers in a set location dedicated to FO76.  They are using Amazon's cloud service, Amazon allocates server resources to running FO76 as needed or not needed.  Adding another mode doesn't appreciably effect costs unless it draws in more players.  Suppose they have 10 world instance running for 200 people, if 10% of those play survival then they still allocate resources for 10 worlds, it would just be 9 normal and 1 survival.  
---
I don't need to seem them to know that they work. If i usd 2 bobbleheads and they stack i can assume that ypu can fo thd same with 1000. And i saw pictures of people having 18000 bobbleheads. Why are you so pro bobblehead stacking? Have you purchased lots of them from dupers?
---
If something is rare, it has more value. If there are 10 billion of something it has little value....really can't see that?
---
I got mine from the vendor in Grafton Station.
---
Give me something like a glowing radstag skin trapper outfit, then I'll spend some Atoms. 
---
I agree with most of this.
---
I included the level 25 stat because I think it speaks a lot to what you're saying, actually.
---
I should have also included the Morgantown Airport quest achievement stat, which I think is a fair indicator of how many people gave the game an actual chance. I'm not currently home, but I believe it was around 90%.
---
The fact that there's a 70% drop off from level 6ish to level 25 is fairly telling.
---
Being generous, maybe 50% of those people are still playing and just make slow progress or are fairly new.
---
That said, even if only 1/5 of the people that purchased the game still play with any regularity, Reddit is still a minority.
---
&gt; Weapons that could be removed from the game completely and no one would be too bothered
---
You listed more than a few weapons I either use or have used and definitely some I have seen a number of people using.  I'm not sure why you are advocating everyone being more cookie cutter than already.
---
Yeah I'd play that.  Would be more fun overall actually.   As a game mode to hop into, nothing more though.   I'd rather we just expand on the current game mode rather than make another though.  I dunno
---
Player interaction is great when it's anything but being puddled by a TSE. Gift bags for new players is the best.
---
Transfer your items all into your Stash.  And then try again.
---
How about 700?
---
Out of curiosity how is that looking these days. 
---
It doesn't effect the real world does it? no ones says it does? LMAO this guy!
---
Of course a game can have an in game economy....
---
So my first toon has a name, as does my second, my 3rd toon is named Heavy weapons, 4th is named Sneak and last is Rifle....
---
Place material in your inventory. 
---
Got my plan for it today, cant post screens here, but yes it does exsist and does idd turn into dense in crafting bench.
---
Ditto! ugh
---
So maybe surprisingly bashing can be pretty potent with a small investment. The combat shotgun is the only one that has the bruising stock, bayonet and isn't bugged to deal pistol-whip bash damage. It would also benefit from Gunsmith where my current melee weapon wears out quickly.
---
Also I like stabbing things with my gun.
---
Nice, I like it!  Make the key stick out from the fusion core slot.
---
The required space between camps can seem very large.  Can see your area clear, but in the distance someone has a camp set, and it will be too close to place yours.
---
Yes I can see that, and you really cannot see that they are supposedly thousands of TSE handmades out there now, so its far from rare, selling at 5 to 10 thousand caps a piece?
---
They aren't exactly spot on but yes, that happens. Military vehicles are coated in a special type of paint called CARC, chemical agent resistant coating. Specifically designed as such they can use very caustic sprays on the vehicles to decontaminate them.
---
After the vehicle is decontaminated you get out of the vehicle and go through a very careful decontamination process. Clothes are taking off in a certain Manner and cut off if need be and you use all of these crazy chemical wipes and get scrub down on any skin that was exposed. You get issued new uniforms and such and go back to work if you are still capable.
---
I can highlight the walls, but I get the "part of the structure would in inaccessible" message when trying to scrap or store.
---
And my axe.
---
What you don't like surprise missile launchers and a half dozen missiles?
---
But it isn't the same game. It will have completely differebt mechanics, which requires extra coding. 
---
Such as losing aid loot upon death. 
---
Loot being transferable modes. 
---
Different drop rates, and rewards. 
---
Just to name three changes we know of so far. 
---
All requiring dev attention, all possibly creating new bugs that will need dev attention. 
---
I found a fat man that's called something else that weighs 6 lbs, it's freaking fantastic. There's probably a missile launcher that's like that out there somewhere in Appalachia...
---
Fissure site prime
---
AOE sounds good,  but you have less chances of using them to affect multiple targets than point target weapons.  Typically you get one shot off before you get rushed, maybe two if you start hidden.  They are buggy, or at least they were when I tried to use them.  MIRVs failed to inflict damage and you could not hit anything more than two height levels or so lower than you.  The warheads can be detonated by enemy bullets, similar to grenades.  The reload is horrible, though a perk can help with that.  And as you mentioned you have to commit to an explosive build for them to be otherwise useful.  I do have a two star legendary  autogrenade launcher I bring out sometimes since 40mm ammo seems to be common among the scorched crowned mobs, but were it not for that I would vendor it. 
---
The downside as it is outweighs the upside for me.  Now for AOE I use grenades or a tesla.    Grenades do more damage and with the perk that shows the throw path are more accurate in most cases and I can throw them fairly fast, though admittedly not far.  
---
Dupers run that market. They don't trade in caps.
---
I'm pretty out of the way and I ran around looking for another camp, there wasn't one. I can even set my camp back down in the place it was. I've tried several different spots and it's pretty much come down to if I log out I'm just gonna a have to rebuild. 
---
Yes.  But i have had lots of times when all the enemies in the group drop legendary items too!!
---
Then all they have to say is they are also releasing more end game content in March. 
---
The fact they won't, has me suspicious that it will just be more store items and bug fixes. 
---
How many other successful online game franchises started as single player games?  Many, and therefore the premise is off.  This version was planned this way from the beginning.  It's not like fallout 1, 2, tactics, 3 , nv, 4 , shelter, etc have been removed.  Go play them lol
---
I think this post perfectly sums up the issues with the direction of the game, but misses one thing completely and that is substantial communication and transparency about future updates. We've been getting vague promises of new content plans for over a month now, and we still have no idea when we're getting it or even what it is. Unless the PvP mode is that content that was being discussed, which is not actually content. 
---
This post also perfectly sums up why I, an avid PvPer in every game I play, have absolutely no interest in the PvP mode being discussed. 
---
Please ensure this is seen by people who plan for and create content within this game, and please understand the impact these issues have on die hard Fallout fans who truly want to see 76 succeed. 
---
Sorry cheaters ruined your PVE experience, but now you want to start over and PVP and Im supposed to start over as well so you feel better Right I'm the selfish one..
---
you keep posting this like it means something, I've already told you Im melee and play for pvp (bounty hunting)
---
Just because the game is ruined for pve as you put it doesnt mean the same problems have to carry over to the new servers, well see though. I can pretty guarantee you Bethesda will say new characters only.
---
The only way that wont happen is if they can remove the duped items, because thankfully, Bethesda do under stand what duped items can do to PVE and PVP. Look at ESO they had to relaunch the game after 1 year of fighting with duped economies and it cost them big time.
---
We have learned, and we have grown.  I only have one character so far, level 47.
---
hehe this guy gets it :D
---
test
---
It will be kill on sight. You won't be able to risk it when you respawn so far away. Kill on sight ruins tension because everyone will know it's kill on sight. This mode will be a ghost town.
---
Im just saying people don't want the ability to import characters into pvp for fear of it becoming existing high levels just sniping anyone lower.  
---
Even if everyone starts a new character you still have the situation arising after a few months. 
---
Especially with leaderboards this gives an opportunity to set survival up as a series of long running matches.  Experienced players will still have an edge in knowing how to progress quickly.  
---
Having it seasonal also would allow for balance changes to be planned to drop at season changes so you don't have people climb high on the leaderboards due to an imbalance and then a balance change makes passing them much harder
---
This is happening to me on alot of 3 star's. Might happen on other but i pay more attention on 3 star.
---
Thanks for the real answer. It seems pretty sound  If it was a dragon, or something better at long range, I'd see it as more viable. I've just never bashed something and not regretted passing on the reload.
---
Only thing this would change is to rebalance everything. What else are you trying to achieve here?
---
I'd love to see it. It was hard to strike a balance between having a functional space and showcasing the waterfall.
---
He's not a hug enough level and you didn't even say the location. Look I'm on xbox if you're on xbox ill play with you later hit me up deadkiller680. I would not focus on levels until you've completed a bunch of quests and make sure to scrap your junk to reduce weight so you don't become over encumbered. To scrap junk go to any workbench and press x on xbox to scrap junk and put it in your stash. Fissure site prime is located on the bottom right of the map. 
---
For real.
---
Clearly the Vault-Tec Corporation sabotaged all the head gear and exterminated the local population of West Virginia in the most insidious and third wall breaking plot points to reduce the development time and increase profits. Bastards. 
---
Should have been in from day 1, absolutely.
---
You’ll want to head into Flatwoods.  It is a good base of operations.  Vendors, workshops, and relative safety.
---
You can buy them a lot cheaper than that now. You can also pick them up on Ebay for about £5.
---
Just think how much they would be worth if there wasn't thousands of them on each server
---
Actually.. it could be azure it could be dell emc..
---
Most likely s3 and aws.
---
Where can I find this claw machine? Haha 
---
Yeah I so stupid I don't get how I effects balance. 
---
Pwease explane too mee so my feeeble mind can understand. Bro you clearly don't pvp, if you do i would imagine its just a thing you do from time to time. You clearly dont get that the player vs enviroment and player vs player dont neccesarily fall into the same category balance wise. It's a difficult line to walk for developers.  Your economy, your precious end game your pve experience was ruined for you by dupers. Really sorry that sucks. But quit trying to ruin the game for a fairly large community of people so YOU can have a fresh run at it. Just seems unfair and selfish to me.
---
Sometimes whenever I am feeling generous, I farm a few and pass them out to newbies. Easy to make and they look cool.
---
Now if only the other robot helmets did the same.
---
Everyone knows. It's been this was since the helmet was introduced in Fallout 4's Automatron dlc.
---
middle!!
---
I know a few engineers that struggle to work out cut and fill in real life so I wouldn’t trust Bethesda to do it in a virtual setting. It’ll end up crashing the game :)
---
Luck
---
Or.. he has the recipes and he is simply trying to make some caps by crafting and selling them.  A lot of people do that.
---
&gt; Making train noises myself.
---
choo-choo mudderfackers
---
I added an edit to clarify. Past mid game these weapons have limited to no use. They don't have unique perks, and only two that I know of have cool or unique mods. I didn't say remove them, I said you could. I was trying to demonstrate that they simply are inferior when you're working on that last 5-10% of the content.
---
I want to use a baseball bat without sacrificing my tier of play. I want them to be better, not removed.
---
I went to a super sledge build. Ammo is way lighter ;)
---
i kitted out 3 level 11-30 players last night in only hazmat suits with sledgehammers and what ever mods i could stick on there and they were wrecking shop against level 70+ players. 
---
&gt;Does anyone have the actual formula for how slap is calculated?
---
[slap](https://youtu.be/n-l4bt8agqw)
---
Sorry pc, thanks for the offer though I appreciate it, also thanks for the tips
---
I'm a risk taker, I run right down the middle.
---
I have noticed some ground features (like brush) disappear when I place a plant near or on them, but otherwise I don't think anything else disappears.
---
This I could also support.  Not as drastic.  Half these guys want a wipe just because they are nowhere near you. They basically want a reset so they can catch up.  That's the only reason these nonsense ideas could Garner any support.  In reality, the unbalanced will show themselves reguadless in a few weeks.  These guys just want to be level 400 also but have not even put in a third of the time required.  That's my view of it 
---
your feeble mind obviously isn't big enough to wrap itself around it so no, if you wish to learn and better yourself though google it or watch some videos about previous titles with the same issues and educate yourself on the matter.
---
It's the new Try To Sell Something Anything Vendor Mini-Game

I got level 50+ super mutants, a couple of them with mini guns. After I cleared them all out, some other player entered the building, and they all respawned all around me, back at full health and nearly all in the tiny room I was in. Aargh!  At least I lived to tell the tale :)
---
Absolutely, usually once a week. A lucky vault dweller gets roughly 53 plans and recipes.  
---
Not hard to miss when there are two options only- whitespring or SBQ.
---
Who said im pro bobblehead stacking lol. Just saying for pvp it's really not an issue.
---
See in recent posts on PA &amp; HUD.
---
Had an issue a few days ago while ingame fast traveled to several train yards in PA.
---
HUD DISPLAY was black. But you could see HUD!
---
After spending roughly 70 caps logging off for the evening. Hasn’t happened since.
---
Can we please stop coming here to have your cheating bs justified?
---
One problem with this plan: I don't think they have a roadmap to release. With the poor sales 76 had, Bethesda's in crisis mode, and they're basically throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks.
---
And how is starting new characters on a new server ruining the game for everyone? 
---
refund and try again in 6+ months.
---
lol Listen I am not trying to be difficulty, no trying to down anyone, its not a "I don't get it", its "I don't get how it has killed the game economy since weapons and armor are selling for 5, 10 sometimes even 20,000 caps. So how has this ruined the ingame economy and made this of lesser value, because I havent seen the prices go down yet. If anything, its a economy that is  "Price Gouging" like Katrina just wipe out the wasteland or some shit lol 
---
And WTAF why can't we "lock" items?
---
Why are all of our best items one button press away from Oblivion?
---
Press "R" at the wrong time, and the item falls through the world and disappears forever.
---
Plus you could accidentally "scrap" your best 3 Star Legendary gun that took you weeks of hard work to find.
---
You could literally code the ability to lock in a FEW MINUTES.
---
I can't remember the name of the mod, but it gives you an auto stim when you drop to 20% health.  It's pretty handy in frantic situations.
---
Tagging /u/jessBethesda -- this is a breakthrough!
---
Crud, glad I spotted this, I was suspicious about that when playing earlier. Why did't I just test it? Dunno.
---
That's like saying perk cards have no place in PvP. What legendary weapons do you think others will have that you can't? Or why do you think they will render your legendary weapon useless? TSE already get nerfed. The new Two Shot will suck, you lose long distance accuracy for just 25% more damage. What is the point of even playing without any type of weapon progresion or build variaty? Just murder people in PVP with identical weapons and builds? The PVP server isn't just for PVP, you will hardly find anyone since you won't see them on the map. Until you find other player you will be playing normally and that means getting loot and scraping it. Without legendary weapons everyone will be scrapping their weapons by accident.
---
It could be as simple as a “Well coordinated” bonus that gives plus 10 AP
---
That makes a lot of sense.
---
Don't sell your Technical Data for 1 cap before you know what it's for like I did for the first few weeks. Lol
---
Don't set it to 0? Set the price to something approaching the item's value and then buy the wanted item for the same price. That way, no one is ever on the truly shitty end of the deal.
---
true, when I brought the idea up to my friend who actually likes building he suggested using his blueprint at my camp. 
---
Yeah, the kids across the street from me play hockey. Their mom spends like 1 day a month scrubbing their goalie equipment down like I used to do with my turn out gear after a large fire, or a long night in the rain/snow. 
---
This couldnt be more accurate. I can 1000000% get behind this
---
That explains how I got one-shot the other day. I have pacifist on but was in a team and I had a workshop and was farming acid.
---
Son of a bitch.
---
Does workshop include CAMP? Because that would explain the player that was slapping me with a miners claw for around 50hp a pop.
---
I like that too!
---
You should definitely only trade with someone who is active on either Reddit, discord, or I guess the FB trading group so you can let people know if someone is a scammer or not
---
I killed two, three star legendary enemies today and got nothing. Nothing I say! (Well, no legendary items.)
---
...and why would you even do nuke in Survival server first place. 
---
Where have I justified cheating? 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Well if the dupers hadn't uh... no I mean this is their first multiplayer game and servers are... well it's not like there's ever been any other game that errr... well I'm sure the Year 2 patch will see this game in a great place.
---
What's technical data?
---
(You don't have to explain if you don't want)
---
Sound's like you have the poor luck to run into a lot of dupers. Their whole shtick involves making the servers fail.
---
Oh the sadness of growing old, when you can be reduced to only two shots...  (Depending, well, sometimes, like if you are going for round 2...)
---
I wish we could do like a chest system where people could buy stuff from you for your price from your camp for caps that are instantly given to you are a normal trade system like FO3/NV
---
I love it when that happens. It's like a legendary loot pinata exploded and all dead monsters around it snagged one.
---
Unfortunately I am on xbox. I am not allowed to do another gaming computer. 
---
And I have played this game 100% legit so get out of here unless you have some that actually pertains to the thread.
---
My heart tells me to hope but my brain agrees with you. At the same time, how epic would it be to see people actually not kill each other on sight! I'd love for [this scene](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/1dbQZOgWCWR9kgpEWkWN0K/03e2d106312fc98e702ad304ed88e00b/004.jpg) to actually happen. 
---
BoS item to turn in for rewards
---
Name should only show for the player who makes the name, right?
---
Then there's absolutely no issue, no excuse.
---
What do you mean stack armor and perks?
---
What Fallout 76 needs is project management. The project management process builds the roadmap in the planning process, before production ever begins. I can see that the game lacks a fully fleshed out planning phase, and it is suffered heavily from scope creep and feature creep.
---
Bethesda needs to read up on the PMBOK.
---
Ever since I took Pain Train in FO4, I just haven't been the same
---
Still open?
---
Ok thats screwed up that they are selling on ebay, even more screwed up if someone's gameplay is so important that they buy them on ebay, I guess I havent paid much attention to prices lately, I tried to buy a Bloodied exploding handmade last week from someone and 20000 caps wasn't enough
---
A friend had a different issue and got this response from support. Still seems worth a try...

---
There is also the option of dropping a single junk item/bullet/wooden armor. Once you confirm the bag successfully created, you can interact with it like any other container in the world.
---
What you want is to say "oh yeah totally fine that you duped since you don't use tse in your build therefore it doesnt change the in game balance."
---
Sorry still cheating and I hope you find yourself banned.
---
o o f
---
Ask Bethesda to explain it to you, it almost derailed Elder Scrolls Online, there biggest title to date. It was that bad, they pulled the product from the market and re launched it a year later. The information is all there online for you to read or watch. Take a look its intetresting.
---
If duping items didn't effect games negatively, games like WoW, EsO, SwG etc etc wouldn't take extreme measure to stop it would they they wouldn't care less.
---
It ruins the game for the very large pvp community who has been asking  for this. Bethesda is adding it because of our requests. I dont see any passive mode warrior screaming to have pvp restrictions removed.
---
Rarely. More often I find legendaries on unmarked enemies. 
---
The fun bit is attaching stuff to trees, then using a carpet to make the tree pop out of existence, but leaves the attached object floating in the air.
---
They are going to start to lose the very few loyal players left. Like when are we getting new quests. They should have had atleast a new quest during December 
---
I included the right now to signify I wasn’t against this mode, not at all. But I feel like it shouldn’t be a priority right now.
---
If I remember correctly. I could be really wrong, I just remember wasting a crap ton of nukes because they were taking up SO MUCH SPACE in my stash. bethesda pls
---
I can agree with the part about not having an option to import existing characters so that everyone would start as a newbie in this mode. I just can't agree with the resets and I probably won't play if it would get implemented. 
---
I  just want to have an almost unrestricted PVP-mode.
---
It should only spin when you are happy
---
Relish is a fancier version that gives 10% more xp. So with that well-rested and Inspirational 3 you could net 30% xp buff.
---
Doesn't the suppressor reduce damage? Or is it range? I forget honestly.
---
Those people popped back in to do content. I'm popping back in to see if they have managed to get the train wreck back on the tracks. 
---
Honestly, just go enjoy the game. It is so easy to get caught up in server hopping for legendaries or blast zones, or grinding for the shielded under armors plans(what I’m currently on). There is plenty of time for that stuff later. I used to just start at the top of the map and walk south discovering new locations. 
---
Oh right. The game is nowhere near beta yet.
---
Want this!
---
Text me when u want to trade because I'm on now
---
Also search some builds so you don't mess up your SPECIAL early on. Otherwise you have to keep leveling to "fix" it.
---
You rethink your life. Mad over man internet username. How sad are you? Get a personality
---
Why start now? 
---
Owned.
---
Rofl okay I'll go check out the last dozen and check back in with you in two hours.
---
No he's just a troll :)
---
Passive mode warrior....may not even be human, BOT?
---
If they are bulked, try unbulking them. I had this happen with adhesive a couple weeks ago. 
---
And to add to that, ok you make a good point of the worth if they were not duped, thats all I ask is for people to make a point and you did. I do not think anyone could afford one if there were only a few lol, which would be good, as you were saying
---
Yeah it normally happens on 3 stars for me
---
They should put in a trade box, you put items in them the other puts it on their end. Then both have to agree.  Like old school D2
---
Would make giving stuff away easier to.
---
This is the closes you will find [https://odealo.com/articles/the-best-weapons-in-fallout-76-mods-crafting-unique-powers-guide](https://odealo.com/articles/the-best-weapons-in-fallout-76-mods-crafting-unique-powers-guide) 
---
And actually a decent guide 
---
Just range I’m pretty sure 
---
I think it's not that Bethesda is trying to cater to the minority pvp player base. No what they're trying to do is cater to *as many people as possible* and this approach assures that no one is going to be happy with the result.
---
This isn't a glitch, legendaries have a higher chance to drop legendaries but it isn't guaranteed. Just how regular enemies can still drop legendaries it's just less of a chance.
---
see I would say transfer what you need into your inventory I had had the same problem. But maybe doing vice versa works as well.
---
Yeah. 
---
what did he write? I missed it! :(
---
All you have to say is "oh bro you a cheater get out" lol here comes the internet. Nithing of intellegence to add to the conversation. Why don' t you actually add something constructive. 
---
you can't use the extra int for perks, you lose 3 luck getting class freak instead of other perks, example bloody mess for 3.
---
Yes, it's a much smaller downside, but it is still something you have to trade off to get something else. 
---
Yes absolutely. Make it work like Star Wars Galaxies where instead of being "passive" you choose to be "covert" which means you're not engaging in faction PvP. Put a timer on switching the status to prevent abuse.
---
Sounds like me. I have a melee w/HW to force the Bravos down and a melee stealth that I RP as a vampire and a sniper. 
---
That's why I was using the missiles... and running around in power armor.. trying to get rid of weighty stuff
---
You're in a subreddit for a game that was made very differently from others in it's series already. Doing things the series has never done before. Such as being an online multiplayer experience, rather than an offline single player experience. 
---
You're criticizing a decision to do something that isn't the norm for the series in a game that's already vastly different and about trying new things for the series, it's rather silly. Attempts to be clever or snarky won't change that.
---
I know that area because I'm camped on an iron deposit there, specifically to mine steel for ammo. There are several good extractor sites around there. The lead site is kind of a bust though because of the constant scorchbeasts.
---
I too am surprised at the time scale on the survival mode. They have yet to reveal all of the details, but based on what we’ve got you would assume it wouldn’t take nearly as long as has been projected for it to be released.
---
They are adding vending machines in a future update
---
yes, their should always be a cultist faction.
---
Same here 
---
As I understand it, it's a Person v Person mode - with only 2 players on any given server things might just get a little more stable...
---
My armor never seems to break but my tse shotgun does no damage so I'm forced to use another gun
---
Ready
---
I do all my gun to gun trades from reddit. It’s easy to get scammed but I haven’t been yet
---
Unless you're using it for pvp purposes, I guess
---
Keep cosmetics cosmetic.
---
The game leads you through a series of relatively easy quests early on. Don't rush it. Build a basic camp in the Forest so you can fast travel back to it for free. If the event Fertile Soil starts in Flatwoods your first time there, remember that you don't have to join it. It's not that it's super tough, but it can be a bit overwhelming when you're just starting out. The Morgantown airport stuff (meaning quests but not events), which you're pointed to early on, can seem a bit easier in comparison (just my opinion; I'm sure others may feel differently).
---
Sneak damage functions the same way in PvP currently, I don't see why survival mode would be any different
---
"humor"!
---
What platform are you on? Me and some buddy’s started one with 7 people planned and then another 3 or 4 turned up ranging from 70-140
---
I think I have no other choice... but I don’t trust this game. When I loose my second character too, then that would be it. 
---
Not to downplay your problem, which is real, and a major reason I don’t bother with workshops anymore, but... how did you spend 1000 caps? 
---
Buying ammo? Aid?
---
Not to mention a lot of the gym sites are already farmed out. Nice if you can get them but more of a bonus than a reliable way to farm lead.
---
What if you don’t have caps? Or the player just buys it from you then leaves?
---
Right you have to be able to tell other traders that they're rotten. Our word is All we have in the wastes
---
" Like old school D2"
---
Also like Fallout 4.  Really stupid that they changed this.
---
I think people really just want to play without all the duped weapons, chems, armor, bobbles and whatever else. I know that I have been avoiding pvp for that reason.
---
Alright
---
I will look up ESO, have never played it, once I started modding Skyrim I never stopped or moved on, I still go back and build mods for Skyrim cause I love that game
---
I do not disagree that duping it bad, have never said that, was just saying that, as far as I know it hasn't effect the way I play the game
---
Would you suggest do a rifle buidl?
---
Yeah. It’s easy to get someone banned for scamming on trade subs though. 
---
No.  Bethesda is trying to capitalize on “mystery.”  This game is on life support and needs a clear plan, with detailed information and a vision to satisfy fans who’ve held on too long.  People are quitting in droves.
---
Really not that hard just to trade the shit for the exact same amount of caps
---
Could you imagine this stuff IRL?
---
it feels like a bill Murray movie
---
People are split between survival being no effort to add and survival will take up too much development time that could be spent elsewhere. 
---
I think you found an even better way to put it. It’s like picking a class. You can specialize in HW, specialize in Hoarding, or hybrid both, but you can’t maximize both. 
---
You may have also forgotten that Bethesda claimed the next update will be another huge bug/glitch fix one
---
I guess I would be really OP in a PVP mode as an stealth rifleman.
---
From a business perspective, which this message is to a business, catering to the majority is a wise business decision. I’m merely pointing out what it will likely take to please that majority. 
---
Okay... got it?
---
I've only ever noticed this happening when solo playing , normal scorchbeasts do the same it's frustrating especially when they spam the life out of the sonic blast
---
What if the other person buys your item then leaves?
---
An armor perks on? When the queen goes badly it is easy to use a lot of Ammo. Usually by 15 min in you have an idea if you can kill her, and it’s even better if you kill her before 15 min left. 
---
I for one will exclusively play survival mode, so long as they don’t include transferred over characters. One of my biggest issues is not being able to engage other players whenever I want. Whenever I actually get the chance to engage in PVP, it’s the most exciting part of the game. It’s satisfying to take another player down in combat and make off with their loot. 
---
If the servers could handle more than two dozen people you better believe battleroyale would have been the main mode of this game. The suits run this shit. Money reigns. Art is dead.
---
In this mode, nukes shouldn't be active.
---
I didn't.
---
You don't like it, therefore it's not important. Yeah, that logic tracks.
---
&gt; you shouldn't have rushed, the game has plenty to explore
---
I think three months is plenty of time already even for the non-"rushing" players to have seen everything.
---
Medic Pump, my personal favorite. 
---
Don't scrap the BOS power armor chassis you get for completing their questline.
---
If there were leaderboards in the game right now, the only way to get to first place would be whomever doesn't get disconnected.
---
You can build your toon to be 100% immune to explosive damage, you can get 5 piece sentinal, 75% damage reduce, 5 piece assassins, 40%, dodgy 30%, armor for another 50%, serendipity, nerd rage. Among other things. You really do t need to stack bobbleheads to be hard to kill. I think the accusations of chearing more often than not come from a lack of understanding.
---
Fast traveling to the closest locations for the workbenches, caps to claim them. I claimed 5 different workshops all across the map. It added up quick. 
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net works fine for me
---
Good for you :D
---
I use electrically charged, unstable isotope, plague walker, marsupial, grounded, twisted muscles, herbivore, healing factor.  
---
Also if you stack electrically charged(makes a electrically charge blast sometimes when you get hit in melee) and unstable isotope(same as other one but makes radiation smoke/mist) and they go off at the same time the electricity ignites the radiation and creates a nuclear blast.
---
People are buying atoms. To Bethesda the game works. It's functional. People are spending money. This is it.
---
I agree and I'm happy that I can finally play as a raider without the slap restrictions.
---
Your welcome! Anything to help the community!
---
I have conflicting sources in it.  Some have said scorch beast queen some have said vendors.  In at 210 hours and haven't seen either way
---
You're half right. All the assets and most of the code for the event are in-game, but none of it is accessible. They've yet to add the code to actually start the whole thing off. That said, most of the info has been thoroughly datamined, and you can even clip into the "executive suit" in the Enclave bunker. 
---
I'm on PS4 but have had this issue. It seems loading related, similar to how it often takes a minute for my CAMP to load. I primarily use VATS though and using VATS has seemed to magically make the invisible enemies appear... so if you don't normally use VATS, that might be worth a try. 
---
Why work on server leaderboards when nobody can stay connected?
---
you need to have some sort of health regen I think before it actually will regen for you. not sure about that but my hp takes less then 1 second to refill out of combat.
---
I like kinetic dynamo. Taking damage recharges ap.
---
I couldn't wait for PVP. I enjoy the fact that there can be content for both groups of people but pvp didn't even have a spot since the slap damage is the dumbest mechanic to have ever existed. I don't hate on people for wanting pve only so why all the hate on pvp?  
---
Seriously, I feel like I was the only one watching the map for bounties.
---
Wee little squeaker, I gave you my opinion and bc it doesnt support or justify your bs exploiting you say I dont have anything constructive. 
---
Hows about this for constructive- delete your cheating toon and make a new one completely free of your cheating?
---
Otherwise, happy hunting hope they ban you!
---
Ttfn!
---
In other words you can’t read
---
Omg please do! Haha
---
When we were playing Beta my husband got a pic of me with Chally. We had to be quick because photomode takes a minute and Grahm and Chally dont stop walking unless you interact, but its still one of my fave pics of my girl in-game.
---
Why kiddy?
---
my hopes were high with survival mode until i saw that it wont be until march
---
we are 2.5 months after launch and people who played a lot ran out of things after the first month. there will be almost nobody left at the 4 month mark to still be playing when it is released  
---
i was okay with there being very little content at launch since it is online only, i expected new things every month or two. but if they expect the current content to hold for 4 months....................  
---
for reference, the first dlc for fallout 4 was released 4 months after launch and fo4 had WAY more content
---
I'm disconnected twice in the last two weeks, and I'm sure I'm not the only one. Again, your experience is not the same as everyone else's.
---
There will be no "start PvP" it will be full damage from the first shot
---
&gt; The whole time I was thinking "I bet if I had a missile launcher this would be easier" Was I wrong in that assessment? 
---
Adding my voice to the choir of "Yes"
---
I got a missle launcher from a nearby Super Mutant, and decided "Hey I should use it on that cargo bot they were all shooting at before I came along"
---
I had a couple dozen missles on me because I'm an idiot that doesn't check ammo when I'm wondering why I'm so goddamn over-encumbered.
---
The launcher broke. I finished the damn thing off with my .308
---
Okay, so like the regen armor or just using water vs a stimpack? It works on the rad showers (unless rad shower restores hp automatically and I just never noticed).
---
All of those flare guns! Wait...
---
Destiny had that option for social places if I recall correctly
---
Read the terminals in the bunker...
---
Spoiler
---
There is a presidential section of the bunker off limits to players currently, a long with numerous keypads and hand scanners throughout the game we don't  have access to yet.
---
There is more that just vaults to come...
---
Random. Thanks for spellinf that out for me champ.
---
That doesn't sound like a bad thing. I look quite forward to sniping unsuspecting players
---
Jedi1josh on Xbox one. Today I noticed that the game freezes up seconds after it loads. I tried doing a hard reset of the Xbox and it still happens. This is making the game unplayable.
---
I don't use mutations, but it's really for RP reasons. I don't care what MODUS says, an Enclave member intentionally mutating themselves feels wrong. 
---
Everyone should have a fair chance if the leaderboards will mean anything
---
No but i took the blue pill. 
---
Piercing Mag is Reload + AP  
---
Perforating Mag is only AP 
---
It's a valid mechanic though. Maybe it needs to be tweaked a like damage wise but not everyone wants to stand around in power armor.
---
Not that poster but he said there are effectively only 4 end game melee weapons. He suggested improving performance on all weapons so that they’d have a purpose beyond chuckles. I also disagree with him as his examples excluded the 1h weapon class entirely. 
---
As a more invested player I’d say ignoring us is foolish, because we think about what would inspire another playthrough and see things that are easy to miss when one plays more casually. 
---
I agree that kowtowing to any group of players is foolish but if we point out why endgame has little build diversity.  
---
Maybe an issue with their content delivery network in your geographic area... I'm east coast US.
---
Who knows lol
---
&gt;This game lacks so much content if you merch your just going to get bored of the game real quick with nothing to farm.
---
There already is nothing to farm lmao. Drop rates are so shit you'd have to be insane trying to farm for your ideal 3★ instead of just buying/trading for it. And if you weren't already you'd be driven crazy grinding Whitesprings after Whitesprings, Fissure Prime after Fissure Prime just hoping for your ten in a billion drop.
---
That's half the point though. Heavy weapons can be boss fight gear. Pull out the big guns and really bring the hurt. Mini guns shouldn't be for killing radroaches. There's no BFG to pull out, and thusly, no reason to make it expensive to use. Make them bad ass and huge and crazy. If it's expensive to shoot and heavy to carry, it becomes a decision, not just another option. I want that heavy Gunner to roll out in the nuke zone and save our asses by addressing an ass stomping "to whom it may concern, fuck your whole village". 
---
I don't want them to show up and elicit eye rolls from all the late game players. I've got a full heavy weapons build with a meager 12 strength, and it's just depressing how little damage I can dish out with a furious exploding gattling gun, or a two shot explosive flamer. I'd rather use my melee build because it's satisfying, behind my shotgun load out, because it's even more satisfying.
---
Or just play selected holotapes that you have collected
---
It's the surprise missiles and grenades that gets me a lot of the time. The missile launcher at least I'll notice when I'm scrapping stuff.
---
You just said the same thing you did last time.
---
So say we all
---
Actually, I would like to know what Graham's route is too. He's always got 200 caps. He seems to show up at random times. Maybe he doesn't have a route like Trashcan Carla did. Gee, I'd even be happy to put up with some of Carla's cranky, alcoholic abuse.  Once I was talking to Graham on the bridge at Point Pleasant and a lot of Sting-wings attacked. I just stood there and Graham killed them all. Very helpful to his clients. 
---
I have no problem with PvP, I usually pvp daily. I just think the majority of players would rather more PvE content than PvP, obviously the majority doesn’t include everyone, as is expected.
---
It's not about the amount of effort. It is about the things you do that are bad for the fidelity of the game.
---
Agreed with this. I love Fallout, and this idea is great but I would never pvp with the way movement is so poorly handled in the games. So having factions with pvp as the end goal sounds dull, but having factions with the ability to pvp in groups, and then support each other in events and along each others' journeys would be great. Being able to build towns/homebases collectively as well. 👌
---
I wanna say that empty meat piles are causing issues.Was Farming the non nuked golf club just shooting through the side window while standing atop the planter,the meat piles got a little rediculous and they were all empty.  
---
After a while I would crash or lag and just kept getting the same server.
---
They had a previous patch where they nerfed the legendary grind and made it so you aren’t garunteed a legendary or a three star legendary. So it’s not a glitch
---
It’s because nobody wants to think outside the box. I seriously got jealous when you said Furious Missile Launcher. Some of us know.
---
Thanks, stills newer Redditor
---
Because the whole world posts on reddit?  LoL
---
I am a fan, I have played till about lvl 70 I sub to this subreddit and I see a lot of requests to make this game better. I had my fill of it I enjoyed the nuke zones and the meager story but I grew bored with it because it lacks, and it lacks and it lacks. It's forcing the community to do the work for them which is not an entirely bad idea because we can shape it the way we want but it also tells a lot about Bethesda. They're lazy. This was a lazy ass game that was broke and unfinished from the start and still broke. I read the topics about dupers and glitchers and it causing server stress forcing log offs, losing progression etc. My last straw was that I was griefed by a two shot because I had 5 cap bounty for accidentally shooting a fellow gamer during a nuke zone event and after I was minding my biz and forgot I had it. I was looting and getting stuff to repair armor and had a lot of junk. Got killed by a two shot lost my stuff and then got booted from the server. I only have so much patience and desire when it comes to gaming. I get that it should be tough for the reward and all. But... At this point, I'm done. It's a shit game. It really is. You can down this all day but at least look at the game and think. Should I be posting stuff like mini nukes should do more damage. It's a fucking mini nuke it should obliterate everything in it's wake! I had fun in it's birth, but it has not progressed enough to keep my attention. I would have done this as a solo post but I feared the worst. It's just my opinion hope you vault dwellers carry on and make this game better. 
---
I completely feel you. I'm not interested in having a friendly Cooperative Wasteland. I want the world to feel like it should 25 years after Society collapses, like the Wild West.
---
A lot of times I’ll craft a few dozen mini nukes. 
---
Then I’ll go up into the hills at Whitespring and look for nearby CAMPs.  It helps if people are at the CAMPs, too. 
---
I’ll keep pacifist mode on, so no damage.  
---
Crouch and launch mini nukes near the CAMPs. This makes it look like I’m missing my shots.  Switch to a scoped weapon to watch the players scramble looking for the source.  
---
So far those are the only nukes I’ve launched!
---
i have the barbarian outfit too on my melee main. 
---
New York here.
---
The plot thickens lol
---
I play with a group of people but I might be alone in survival mode. I'm normally on weekday nights Eastern so that might line up with West coast hours.
---
I was not aware if that. It's an allusion to a gamertag I use more commonly, but I enjoy my privacy.
---
Maybe we should all follow Graham at the same time - like Disciples. He will pass on the wisdom of Smartie.
---
No one wins a debate and tbh the fact he keeps ignoring me and typing passive mode warrior (which makes no sense to me - translation thing maybe?) is what suggested to being a troll or bot, wasn't really an insult was it :) 
---
Well see what bethesda decide to do though wont we :D
---
My monies on new chacrters only and dupers will be banned (eventually)
---
yeah lets have some servers that do wipes some that do pvp and the some that do pve/pvp. We can have another set of servers for people that are left handed then we can have special LGBTQ servers. Don't forget the servers for the beta cucks who constantly whine about everything. lol
---
more like "it just works" bug hahaha
---
Single player RPGs are falling off because money men see fortnite and are now making every developer chase that dragon. It's a bubble just waiting to collapse in on itself.
---
If you took that as a personal insult, you really shouldn’t unless you’re an EA fanboy or stock holder.
---
My point exactly.
---
Everyone keeps assuming I’m some kind of PvP hater. I usually end up pvping in every session, for at least a little bit. I just think the majority of players would rather more PvE content as currently there’s only one thing to do endgame, over more PvP content.
---
then call me crazy because i dont buy/trade period. the community was so infected by dupers my whole community decided to only work together and have no outside influences. 
---
over my 500 hours play time ive got a bunch of great weapons i can use. no tse or anything op. the best ive gotten was beserk/explosive dragon, nocturnal/explosive gatling plasma and quad/explosive tesla rifle. 
---
my community has the queen on farm without any outside influence to trading or duping which in my opinion is the best way to play the game. 
---
it does suck tho when those "elite tse" players kill the queen in 2 seconds when were purposely holding off on killing her to farm the add's for 20 minutes.   
---
They mentioned PVE content, but so far we have no idea when or what. After this PVP reveal all they told was "We are working on PVE content"
---
Smell my finger
---
*tears up your mensa application*
---
It's a bit of a grind until level 25 but then you definitely want to go get the Excavator armor (you'll have to look it up), after that leveling is smooth and easy.
---
My gattling is a furious exploding for the same reason. Not the best, but definitely bad ass among it's peers.
---
No need for leaderboard resets, just add best of week/month/quarter filters
---
:)
---
Oh, interesting.  Thank you for opening up two points for me.
---
A co-op fallout. With a story and NPCs. Towns to explore with your friends. Not whatever the fuck this mess is.
---
* Pencils! there are tons in places you might already be farming for screws/springs. Any office-type location really, nearly every desk has one.
---
* Toy-letter blocks also have lead.
---
* Combination wrenches (not adjustable wrenches) are great because they have both steel and lead.
---
* Can traps are another great source. 
---
* Lead-pipe weapons give a good amount. Scrap them as soon as you can to avoid the weight hit.
---
* Dead robots. Protectrons and above especially seem to drop lead scrap pretty frequently. And at minimum you will almost always pick up some steel.
---
Smell mine after
---
The Sims with an irresponsible enthusiasm for firepower.
---
I assume because it’s ready for a live test. (A players test with people outside of the handful of employees that did play testing.) 
---
You know you can play other games and come back later, right? It's a video game, not a new car.
---
Jokes on you, I feel bad whether I like the game or not.
---
Someone's parents made them feel a little to special...
---
No u
---
Dunno
---
ive started to use "Awareness" instead. its good to know which targets have a lot of Armor. ill probably swap those 2 points to luk for One Man Army. 
---
Can't because of trading with real people.
---
I guess it stacks like just about everything else does in some way. At some point I think you're going to be pretty difficult to detect and more isn't going to be that helpful. 
---
Give us a virtual chain saw ; )
---
disconnected from what? pvp fights? I have never had that happen to me.
---
I would have been happy with things as they are with no slap damage. Someone attacks someone they get a bounty. Never ending cycle. It could have been great.
---
The trade steal glitch was entirely fabricated.
---
Breathe more freely with fast, 12 hour congestion relief. Afrin No Drip. Use as directed. GET $1 OFF
---
Are we even playing fallout anymore?
---
They are found on pretty much all Responder vendors (Except I haven't seen them in flatwoods). You just have to server hop. Grafton is the most common spot (since there are 2 bots, better chances)
---
Good.
---
I did it for the first time the other day, and it actually went way better than I thought it would. I'm just rocking X01 power armor and a lever action rifle that does about 130 damage a shot, so I was mostly providing support and firing at her when I wasn't busy with the common enemies. My power armor didn't even get damaged enough to repair, and I was attacking her with melee when I got the chance. Took about 15 minutes - probably 10 players, all in the 50 to 175 range. 
---
One tip that I hadn't seen mentioned in another thread - it helps if you launch the nuke so that the northern edge of the blast zone just barely encompasses the fissure site. That way, you can retreat easily to the non-nuke zone if you need a moment to heal / catch your breath. I also believe that there is a location kind of close by that provides a ledge and building to fire from. 
---
It also happens when there's a group fighting her and the whole group dies at the same time, though that is a bit rare to see.
---
OMG Yes
---
I had assumed that was the function of Responder radio at first and it makes perfect sense. 
---
There a 'presidential' room in the Enclave bunker some people have accessed and there are suggestions of 'presidential' power armor and a weapon or two.  There has been speculation about all the voting equipment laying around being used for an election that would allow a player to access the room/equipment. The nuke code access would tie into presidential powers.  I think there will be some content along these lines on the pve side at some point, but no idea when.
---
What other items aren't reduced by Traveling Pharma?
---
No. The old "there have been a number of false rumors that nobody has been able to replicate on any of the real machines" defense.
---
Got mine at Grafton Station. I remember reading somewhere online that the plans are level locked till you reach lvl. 55 (Got them I when I past level 60vand was the only time I ever saw it being sold at a vendor) but I've seen other reports saying as long as you're past level 25, you should be able to find them at vendors. I also heard you can get them at Camden Park's vendor, as well as at the Welch and and Lewisberg Train station vendors as well.
---
Did I waste 3 points on ordinance express?
---
Only the people who speak up, which are the ones who get heard, which in the end is all that makes a difference, and thus all that matters.

They appear to be sticking to their guns.
---
Awesome be sure to look it up
---
Forgive me for being a pleb.....
---
That’ll do it, I’d never tried taking more then one at a time just because how beat-down I am with the server stability 
---
Agreed, it seems they were afraid of it being to over-powered like explosive rifles and over-compensated
---
Sounds like you had a lot of dead weight around. I've only had one time out of 50 or so fights where I realized I was the only one dealing decent damage, and I left. Every other time we either did good enough damage, or flat out destroyed her within a minute or two. I think I've been pretty lucky with that success rate though. 
---
And I think my PA durability is bugged, because I haven't repaired a piece in over a month and they are all still at over 100% durability.  
---
People will just move duped stuff to these new characters, i mean hell ive seen a level 5 tse pump going around on the boards so even if they make new characters you wont be safe from their gear
---
It’s up for interpretation, not reimagine it then editing it based on how you feel it should look . Imagine the cistine chapel painted over by peasants to more suite their vision....better yet look at the chasms in christanit with its one hundred sects because of someone’s reinterpretation. Once you start nodding it , you aren’t playing that game anymore, you’re playing what you think it should have been. Just like the chapel. , it would be a wreck bc of us peasants 
---
Although you could expand the map for human populated settlements, you also could one or more vaults also release human npc's without the need for a new map area.  They could even move into some of the existing locations without much in the way of modification.
---
I am yet to have to rebuild since the update and I have a complex build of concrete. Obviously don't move your camp, change servers and it should place by itself else you going to need to rebuild unless you have a 1x1. Short of that you might have. bug affecting you only, else the forums would be screaming .. been working like a charm for me for all my characters, have not had to rebuild once.
---
Keep believin' that buddy. Go post and be free!
---
Thank you very much!
---
I mean, you're still playing 76. You're still a beta tester.
---
If you claim the work-shop at the Speed-way, he rocks up. 
---
Disconnection from the server
---
90% of 6 or 2 is still more than other ammos, especially damage/weight
---
If you on PC I cal sell you one;)
---
hunter/hunted doesn't work and we already have LFG option, its called discord
---
I probably won't play then. Levels dont mean anything past level 50 and building a good build and getting nice gear is the only thing left. I don't want to lose my scavenged items every time I log out just because other players (newbies) are weaker than me.
---
A post-apocalyptic wasteland should be ruled by the strongest.
---
Have played numerous online games since Ultima Online. In UO, the outcry of the victims of player killers resulted in the shard being split into a PvP and PVE only mirror. This pretty much ended up in the PvP zone being virtually empty since wolves need sheep to prey on.
---
Most of the games that I played since that had open world PvP, like Dark Age of Camelot, WoW, Darkfall, Conan, SWTOR etc. the PvP was typically nothing more than gank fests and spawn camping. The exception being those that had a form of arena based PvP.
---
I think Survival mode will be a novelty at first, but casual players will be at a significant disadvantage if only new characters are allowed on the server. I think the easy prey will quickly stop playing this mode, leaving it to the wolves who will soon grow bored and go back to normal mode and find new ways to annoy their victims. 
---
"send it to defend workshops"
---
You mean send it to help retake workshops because they couldn't get there in time even if it was next door, ha. Hell they wouldn't make it out of your build zone before you got a disconnect
---
No. Thank you!
---
When I found out I had to unload an entire clip into a scorched and I didn’t kill him was the second I never used one again
---
Personally I (and it seems like many other) are excited for the PvP mode/servers. They are fixing the major issues as to why there is "barely a PVP scene": barely no rewards, the ability to spam "Seek Revenge", and slap damage. Just because they aren't focusing on what you want them to doesn't make it a bad thing. 
---
Survival doesnt come out until march if the dupe glitches are still a thing by then theres no reason to play either mode anyways.
---
&gt; it does suck tho when those "elite tse" players kill the queen in 2 seconds when were purposely holding off on killing her to farm the add's for 20 minutes.
---
TSE's don't suddenly let someone do that when SBQ already gets 90% explosive resistance right off the bat. Only bobblehead exploiters/dupers can suddenly just drop SBQ in a couple secondds after everyone else has just been tickling her for almost a half hour.
---
The account should get a notify when someone mentions them.
---
You could also check the fo76 feed for Bethesda Replied tags and reply directly to one of the community managers.
---
Congrats Doris!
---
Wouldn't everyone just disable voice chat since it is a disadvantage?
---
I think that there should be map blips, but just momentarily when the player does something that causes noise (combat) and only visible to nearby players.
---
Much better put.👍
---
Suggestion:  allow us to put protectrons inside our camp artillery 
---
I think Enclave is the only that can launch nukes at the moment?   
---
I am interested in having others to play with, however, I am not sure I understand how we would work together as a specific faction?
---
Far Cry primal is has the best survival mode of all games I played. The game is really awsome in most aspects. Graphcally supperior still. Survival, Expert and Permadeath mode makes it fantastically challenging. Not many have completed it.
---
True. I guess I’m going more towards if they do expand the map. But I agree, there’s definitely ways to do it without modification. 
---
Those types of events aren't real and never will be. Gaming can't properly punish shitheads because shitheads by games. Since there is no punishment for random murder random murder is what you get. Every online game has these lofty dreams of being a realish world. But it's ruined because the average gamer is a moron. And a piece of shit. Gaming has coddled anti social behaviour so long that it's impossible to break it.
---
What happened to Graham? Did the Scorchbeast kill him? 
---
YES! And they all repeatedly harp on a narrow range of talking points that all clamor for a small number of specific changes that would be straight up buffs. They believe they are clever, but it is really transparent public image manipulation going on!
---
LoL. I mentioned how I kept cheap disposable weapons for slapping mole rats and lower level ghouls and someone said "The fact that we even have to fight mole rates at the endgame means the game design is bad." These people are pathological.
---
Lost you at *off* director... no respect for people that do not prof read.
---
You would never lead with that kind of mentality. 
---
Shame it's on one of those "caps/gear/leveling for caps" websites and shouldn't be given the time of day.
---
Would be better to just copy/paste this information into a discord for easy access.
---
That way we don't give a trash website like this clicks
---
I join the OP. PLS only new character. Too many duplicated TSE in game with god sentinel-assasin-dense full armor.
---
BEG U JUST NEW CHARACTERS.
---
One of the best requests yet, and one I have been asking for. It's head scratch that Besthesda gives zero information about these effects, and what a perk card effects and does not effect. 
---
At this point, the fixes Bethesda is doing is like going around the world to get to the bar next door.
---
I always wandered how we can build a fusion reactor but we can’t pick up a shovel to even the ground...
---
The Power Armour didn't help me and I was level 38 at the time. Chased me and killed me twice. 
---
Yes. Yes. Yesssss
---
Like many have pointed out, and I agree: waste of time and resources. The game has infinite problems and bugs and exploits, this is not the time to be focusing on PVP.
---
Yeah..
---
I’m not sure what psychosis this belongs to but..
---
You get the prize!
---
That's weird. I've seen him about 8 times and I'm level 41 - always in different places. Maybe if you walk more and fast travel less. 
---
Hot swapping perks every time you walk by a lock is not necessary and should not be encouraged. 
---
Thanks, I'm not going to Hijack another's thread for mine, but since a couple people pinged them here, hopefully they'll see it and respond in time.
---
Clearly the can wait to share it :p
---
Never try to  loot a body when anyone else is looting it. You'll have things go missing. Wait until everyone is finished.
---
&gt; prof read.
---
*raises eyebrow* ORLY?
---
I mean bethesda was able to still make money without proofreading 
---
Very rarely the SBQ drops mutation Serum recipes, I’ve picked one up so far.  The vendor in the enclave that sells the serums is also supposed to sell the recipes rarely, but I’ve never actually seen that one myself.  
---
It depends, yes if you like to solo.
---
But with my suggestion it could be an effective way to meet and gang up with players within the open wasteland.
---
I meant to recommend this a couple weeks ago for planting stuff, but I forgot so thank you!
---
Meh..no harm.
---
Hopefully whatever positivity happening on pc will transfer to consoles, sooner then later.
---
Ah ha! Thanks for that. But I saw him once near that bar in the ash-heap
---
As a shareholder, I vote to fire this director and hire a slightly overweight house cat instead. 
---
I hope they at least let us cross the river at some point.  It should not be too hard to expand the map in some areas especially those we can see but not reach.
---
and that fact that we can use the same characters in both mode is just stupid. People oneshotting eachother with explosive twoshot weapons
---
Riding on this. Save AS MANY supplies as possible to build this armor. It was a life savor for me. HORDE these items in [this link](http://dulfy.net/2018/11/15/fallout-76-excavator-power-armor-guide/) 
---
I'm guessing the total number is significantly smaller than most people would expect. I looked into jobs at Bethesda some years ago cuz I'm a usability researcher &amp; see areas in which I could be helpful... after I did that, I really felt sorry for the extent to which people were haranguing them about all the bugs &amp; etc.
---
Although several of these fixes seem relatively small, the (known) thing will improve my experience &amp; reduce my frustration at least a few times per session... 
---
Yeah I guess you are right. The only "social" game I have heard of is Eve online, where they literally managed to build whole societies and hierarchies. OGame too to some extend, where a bunch of diplomacy and undercover strategy is involved.
---
Now those are async games so it probably makes sense. Other "quicker" games don't require enough involvement to see that kind of emergent player organization.
---
Just read the post you wrote...
---
Terrible, no self respecting director would let that garbage out...
---
Lemme re-praise i guess. "Within 1-2 minutes".  Its also very possible to kill the queen in under 1 minute solo without bobblehead stacking. Its actually very easy.  Melee can do it in stealth and chunk her like 15% a hit with min/max unarmed. Then a couple clips from a TSE or Anti Armor + ETC heavy prime gatling plasma/50 cal can burn her real quick.   
---
Most of the time its 2-3 people who dont know the plan. 
---
Also many people do not know this but there is a glitch if you drop the nuke near the Delta station that makes it so she cant take damage if shes aggro'd onto someone where she cant land. ive burned 5000 fusion cells with my anti armor explosive telsa rifle the first time i fought her not knowing this could occur. its very obvious when this occurs. 
---
Can't be OP if everyone is running the same build :)
---
I believe it.
---
*proofread
---
Couldn't help that one.
---
I'm not meaning "passive warrior"  in a derogatory  manner. Sorry if it came accross that way. I just mean people who wanted nothing to do with pvp until now. I agree with you that duping screwed the game up, and that these guys are scum. They absolutely have ruined the PVE experience for everyone by effectively spoiling the endgame gear sets and ruining the economy. 
---
 The new mode as a way for the pve community to have a second chance at a fantastic experience so I can see why that would be upsetting. From your perspective Bethesda drops the ball again. 
---
But that is not the only perspective. All Ive been saying this entire thread.
---
I think more pve content would be great.  
---
However,  I also find it amusing how lately there has been a lot of posts about how pvp is ' wrecking'. Everyone's fun and how there are so many griefers et cetera,  and than posts like this one that state there are virtually no pvpers at all.  .. Haha. ?
---
Launcher weight versus damage output was a major problem in FO4 survival. Like so many things, they just ported over this problem as well.
---
Yeah, I think it actually sparks a bit and that's the shock doing a tiny damage.
---
Hey I'm not claiming to be a director  of anything....lol
---
Everything's maxed at High or Ultra, Borderless Window.
---
You're being downvoted, but that's a legitimate complaint.
---
Was My fav helmet in FO4
---
Also does not know how to spell "restructure". 
---
What I found is that to have a true Jack of All Trades requires you to swap cards for the situation needed. If you’re on PC the mod for storing perk cards plans makes this easier. Here is what I have so far and I’m able to switch my cards around based on what weapon I decide to use or if I’m in my camp crafting or repairing. [My build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=bc34a88&amp;d=pd2pk2pl2c72ib4ic4l71lu2lt2au2a04eh2s01pp2sq2s32sr2&amp;w=s72se2sm2cr0sd2so2sp2sb2e82ao0s52s42s61ss2su2sg2sv3pa0pg2p80ph2p90pi2i30i82i44ij2i71ia0if2ip2i50iq2ie2ih2ig2lm2ar2ag2an2at1c52si2sj2sa2e52&amp;n=) 
---
He didn't make a post..?
---
Been happening to me for a few weeks. Trying to figure out why so I can report it correctly.
---
Nope bethesda said in inside the vault you get to choose everytime you log in and can choose sny character for survival mode 
---
Reddit traders would have servers full of “friends” and no one else. 
---
I don't know what the threshold is but I know small trees will disappear as well.
---
&gt;Just read the post **you** wrote...
---
*Raises other eyebrow* I do not think I am who you think I am.
---
Why force it on everyone when you can do it manually yourself?
---
It’s worth noting that the serums once crafted are valued at 400 caps, which means you cannot sell them to any vendor, and so can only sell them to users.  
---
As well they are relatively cheap to make, so they probably seem like a good item to make and sell, but you have to hunt down other people to do it. 
---
Yes I do. But in full combat armor it shouldn't be working. And this also happened before mutations. That's why I knows its armor related
---
10 points for effort there. Graham's not about to go Vegan any time soon.
---
Dan just noticed my bad lol
---
Trying to get on the battle royal “sell you skins” PvP cash train disguised as a fallout game. A bit cynical I know but nothing else makes sense. Game is an asset flip completely void of nearly everything that made fallout a good RPG. Shame!
---
Out of combat, HP fills up fast.
---
Im sure people dont want to have to use a 3rd party app to find other players 
---
Right... 
---
It was a suppositorie
---
Not only is it fucked, but it's the same fuckery they ported from FO4.
---
He's Hackin' n Whackin' n Smackin'!!
---
Well, I would like to know how/why. Randomly happening doesnt help. Even if its reported, until we know why itll be weeks or months before fixed.
---
Not just bigly…
---
YUUUUUGE.

Dolly Sods Campground. Big ones.

Yeah, my bad I'm just salty now... sorry

Top of the world or Harper's ferry full of super mutants = get all 200 caps from vendors quick plus some entertaining mutie quotes &amp; xp.

Perk cards are an essential part of leveling your characters skill to be better at shooting
---
legendaries are off things you can hunt for if you fealt the need to

You're comparing essentials to choices

Kinda awesome....I better put at least one turret up b4 I move
---
That's ok, the wasteland has a way of getting to you ;)
---
That the acid one is actually in this little cave, really cool spot. But constant SB harassment lol
---
Plz read up on bethesdas posts, it is not a 1 v 1 server at all lols
---
And telling people how to enjoy themselves and play a game that is designed to be played in a variety of ways ia not necessary and should not be encouraged. 
---
Ditto. I might switch to Full Screen (which I hate when running multiple monitors) and see if it has any effect.  I doubt it, but since the last patch I've been CTDing randomly and excessively (Targeting HUD aside)
---
Well said, my friend.
---
I did not notice this! That is so much better than I thought 😁
---
Right, I just leveled a base at the golf course so I'm still a little triggered...
---
I did not know this. 
---
No cant place wires while over budget
---
Luckily not everyone is running the same build. Imagine people with melee and shotgun builds getting obliterated by a sniper.
---
whatever floats your boat
---
You are of course right, I should be saying you shouldn't exclusively listen to powergamers, since they are going to be the most vocal about the games problems, but really the problems that affect them when they power through the game, ignoring the normal progression and powerlevelling to max the fastest and then complaining about the lack of stuff to do with endgame. 
---
Yes because those types of games are more popular, hence why fixing pvp is a smart buisness move. There are many examples where pvp made or broke a game. Dont be suprised if one day pvp players make up a huge profit margin.
---
For me I broke down all the extra plans. No you cannot make wires if over budget
---
I would like to know the plan of getting the game out of beta. 
---
Works on my end. SC
---
FFS, people, stop bickering about spelling! Doris was promoted and we don't have to put up with Phil's bullshit origami penguins any more!!!
---
Urm, ok?
---
Unfortunately, no. Wires have a budget value, though i couldnt tell you what it is. Ran into this situation when the issue with random camp items duplicating into the stored items tab was bad. At one point i had like 7 fusion generators, 20 nuka cola fridges, 10 water purifiers, and a MASSIVE adhesive farm. Eventually i just scrapped it all and went back to being able to run wires again lol
---
I didn't miss the point of the comment it just made me chuckle seeing you rant on about how a Furious Missile Launcher is an "ok" drop. 
---
Opinions are opinions after all but I strongly disagree. 
---
And if you must know Gatling Lasers are by far my fave weapon, cos that sound! Don't have a TSE one but I'm not on my high horse...
---
Not sure why you’re being downvoted, I agree 100% sadly. This is BSG trying to cash in on the skin shop PVP genre, and disguise it as a fallout game. Or they are entirely incompetent. Little bit of both?

I think this is the correct answer, it’s power armor, it should add power! 
---
As well the modest bump of carry weight helped until I could source those calibrated servos. 
---
Works on my end
---
Beth really should make that area off limits.
---
You’re hitting all the right notes here.
---
Antibiotics adds a disease resistance buff on top of curing a disease. I think the resistance buff is 50%.
---
1 cures ALL diseases. 1 cures a single disease.
---
Yeah, I'd LOVE to see factions.
---
It would give some real meaning to PVP encounters.
---
Not just stupid "see person, shoot person" like all the other survival games.
---
Give us something DIFFERENT!  Something NEW!
---
NO! Wasted far too much time trying.
---
i realized I had 12 missiles at one point that I had never picked up just because I accidentally did pick up some and went to drop them. now I can carry a whole 1 more rifle!
---
Preach! Common people can we get an amen!
---
Yes. I call the adult babies who incessantly whine at the developers to give them buffs names.
---
Here's the thing, you don't actually care about the game. You only care about increasing the amount of personal power that you have in the game, and it shows.
---
It's like opening a birthday present. You take off the bow. Getting excited. Take off the paper. Wonder what it will be. Open the box and look inside. And surprise there's nothing there.
---
Disease cure and a few others
---
Water
---
Always said they are now re considering and we are at the start of the conversation.
---
I think they will change there mind, as they can't fix duping or remove duped items. If they can then ill change my opinion but I still think they will remove that feature and everyone will start from scratch as it stands.
---
Thank you makes sense.  Guess it’s incentive not to die
---
But you are using unsupported third party tools to play a game in a way that is has not been designed.
---
YES please :)
---
Every time I see ....  I'm like "FML time to go play search the pip boy for whatever trash you added to my weight"
---
I said relatively cheap, as in cheaper than developing new content with voice lines and animations. It is be a more streamlined undertaking too with less moving parts. The BETA move is a cheaper way to publish changes and an excuse for jacked up coding as far as I’m concerned. 
---
Personally I think some are corrupted 
---
That feeling when you complete an event, you're carrying way more weight but didn't receive any new weapons or armor, and then you realize it dumped a bunch of 40mm in your inventory.
---
They've also labeled patches as "major" that consisted of bug fixes and basic UI improvement.
---
Get out of my Bathroom! Ive been using that house as a camp for a couple weeks now it has no resource node but its a nice enough structure and close to the water.
---
I think he sticks to the main roads and goes from town to town and doesn't go over-land.
---
Real talk no cap
---
I disagree, while levels on weapons are quite a pain, they make sense. You dont want a level 1 running outside Vault 76 and his friend gives him a super sledge, and combat armor.
---
Thanks!  There's another car nearby, but this one has a little less clutter - the other's got a campsite underneath it.
---
How many turds in the swimming pool does it take to diminish your experience?
---
Thanks for the link. gotta say, good thing I didn't have that phone number a few weeks ago lol 
---
They’re probably basing it on the fact that ~4% of PlayStation players have earned the “kill 20 players” trophy.
---
Just noticed a 12% downvote rate..   
---
Pardon my ignorance but why would people downvote a possible bug fix?
---
What's clippling?
---
Xbox one. Im always up for another!
---
I had to disable pain-train to deal with whitesprings, I kept hitting bots and turning the whole place on me ;(
---
What is the name of this lovely outfit? 
---
Speaking of its fire rate,  I recently discovered that the autonade launcher has the same tap-fire hipfire benefits as the gatling does. If you tap fire with the right rhythm,  you can increase its rate of fire over full auto.
---
Actually this one that failed a few hours ago did that exactly. First time I'd ever seen it, but its smart. We fought the whole fight outside of the nuked zone
---
Me to. Gt KnowledgeHound gonna try stay up for another queen if you wanna join 
---
Thank you for that knowledge. I thought it was similar to Radaway Diluted in that there was a chance to suppress so that's handy.
---
That's RNG for ya
---
preach it brother.
---
Maybe he was off his meds. 
---
Dude, I would have bought something.
---
Its a brill addition / fix being able to see which plans are already known. I kinda hope they make sure plans are named correctly as well whilst they are working on them and look at the pricing, some of them just seem so out of whack price wise compared to others.
---
Damn, rn I’m on the giant pointless fortress kick haha
---
I'm a total noob, but I see people building these HUGE and I mean H U G E camps and I can't understand how.  Do you get more of a budget as you get higher level? 
---
You can teleport through the wall by accessing a workbench through a window. 
---
Well, I wouldn't mind some limits. But I do mind multiple levels possible for same weapons.
---
It's really dumb
---
yup once or twice, then they gonna run stealth sniper builds as well!
---
Without the duping though i guess individual builds will change more over time depending on whats looted etc as there wont be the TSE zyx meta.
---
I find it amusing that pvp is somhow happening tons as well as not happening virtually ever . Schroedringers cat or what.  
---
Graham is looking for that one big score - just like the rest of us. 
---
You can with PA pieces, but you need to put them in stash box and then remove them back to inventory first.
---
yup it needs love. (as well as the energy weapons).
---
See but with mutations and my armor I can carry almost 400 lbs. Once I get in my excavator armor 280 or 300 tops I usually have 30 or so stimpacks and Radaway Diluted at any given time so once I put the armor on I'm boned and already overweight. I think im just going to have to continuously try and build and run into nuke zones 
---
These “dipshit complaints” about fixes/tweaks players would like to see in the game need to stop. You’re an intelligent person, you must know that player feedback makes these games better. 
---
&gt; bitter sweat
---
ew
---
That just shows how stupid SBQ's eHP scaling is. I've seen it myself: with low SBQ event participation I've seen myslef do considerable DPS to her with just a Furious .50 Cal then there were the times were the event had basically the entire server there (mostly low levels just standing around of course) and I couldn't see a difference in her HP even after pulling out an explosive Shotgun, making sure I have all the SG perks, Demolition Expert, popping Pyschobuff, etc. and squinting at her HP bar on my monitor. Those are the ones were you know you'll be lucky if you can even get her to half HP the second time before the timer runs out.
---
Saw them last night at the Lewisburg station for 932 caps, with an alt character level 29.  Pure pistol build, so didn't get them. They exist!  The first ones I found for my rifle main character were from Greg in Grafton.
---
If everyone is doing damage to the scorch queen and it’s not too many people in the area she goes down fairly quickly. When I was on last night (Xbox) I got a random invite while in white springs 15 min later the person dropped a nuke in prime. I think there was a total of 8 people in the zone (2 groups of 4) and she was down in less than half the time allotted. Admittedly I did go through quite a number of bullets but far less than if the nuke zone had more people. 
---
If lower than lvl 40 didn’t count for SBQ scaling, then that would make for far less instances of demoralizing failure (midway through you can kind of tell if it’s going to happen or not). Sorry for the bad luck in the zone my dude.
---
unsupported ia not equal to cheating. so of it's not cheating and allowed by beth then you shouldn't tell them not to use it. 
---
Traveling Leather Coat and Assault Gas Mask
---
&gt;older, I vote to fire this director and hire a slightly overweight house cat instead
---
Seems fair.
---
It sucks, but they wouldn’t make any $ if you could do that. At this moment I’m trying to learn paints for baseball bats, I would love to pass out free pink baseball bats to new players. 
---
Me neither.  Wish there was a digital instruction book at times.  Hard to work out what works as intended and what is bugged.
---
It's my favorite weapon for the distant thunder event. I dont bother with a recon scoped weapon; it's so much easier to walk in with the autonader and just smash the whole pack of scorched.
---
I got mine random drop during a event I think an enclave event 
---
That wasn't even that dead serious and written down in like 10 minutes.
---
I've been playing these types of games my whole life so I am well educated in the matter thank you very much. Dont need google and youtube to form my opinion for me either. I actually tried shit out with my friends in game to see what does and doesnt work. Although I dont like to a pve, I do see your perspective, but not feeling like you  see mine. We can agree to disagree I guess.
---
Not really. It prevents someone from getting a limited edition skin and selling it to other players.  From the developers side, this makes perfect sense. 
---
I may not have used the right phrase. I'm no word smith. 
---
I’m sick of the circle jerk that is this subreddit 
---
&gt;I like the surprise element your suggesting but feel this would open the flood gates for the griefers that would take the opportunity to abuse it.
---
Well, the reward for killing someone in pvp on xbox has been given to less than 5% of players, last time I saw it. 
---
That is where I get my statistic from. 
---
u/lonevaultwanderer
---
This is where my husbands camp is. Must be a popular spot given how often the game cant place his camp. Lol
---
I agree that it’s getting better in the sense that it’s not fully broken anymore although it still crashes and disconnects me on a daily basis. Some communication is better than nothing. I’m not going to give them a lot of credit for fixing game breaking bugs on a live game because that is standard operating procedure for everyone. That would be like giving your mom credit for feeding you as a baby. Yeah it’s the right thing to do but it was also an obligation. 
---
Better get to scrapping. Someone here claimed he was banned for duping camp items unintentionally. 
---
I have a running joke whenever I try to find a specific frame that I'm playing the guessing game
---
&gt; Ever wonder if you have joined the same physical server more than once?
---
If you mean the literal server rack machine wherever the game is hosted, I've no idea.  If you mean the same instance of the game, yes.  It has happened to me completely randomly while server hopping I jumped back to an earlier one I was on with the same players/events in it 5 minutes later.
---
“The best and brighest chosen to rebuild America. Not serial killers that were able to hold off aggression against one another for 20 years and now murder one another.”
---
I was thinking this earlier today.  We are all suppose to come from Vault 76.  A vault filled with the brightest and best and we are sent out to rebuild.
---
We as a community have shown that with this mission we are doing just that, or trying since the mechanics of rebuilding are lacking in the game.
---
Mostly we are helping each other.  We are cooperating in the game.  Sure there are some assholes that cause chaos, but I feel that would be true in real life as well.
---
Why would a bunch of people with the mission of rebuilding civilization, become a bunch of murdering everyone they see sociopaths?
---
Maybe the social experiment is to see what happens when you give everyone the ability to kill anyone else in an apocalyptic setting and see what they do.
---
My hypothesis is this community would still spend less time killing each other and more time helping and defending each other.
---
There have been some sales from 20k-50k this week.  The 3\* Hunting rifle that demanded max caps has fell to 3-5k on LFG on Xbox in the last day so maybe there is hope the armor market will erode as well.  I'm looking for the same thing and now I wish I would have paid the 20k but it was a lot of work earn the legit way.
---
Oh that sounds a hilarious. Is it worth the perk investment though?
---
Yup. I bet they have a marketing calendar (ex. Release the Overpriced santa Claus outfit pack and the scammy "Christmas emote" reskins around the holidays) that gets updated a lot. For content, I bet the developers themselves want to add more things but there's no leadership or management that has stepped up at all since the game launched. No creative director or anything to give us a statement
---
Maybe you'll know this since you're also a demo guy: does anti-armor legendary prefix or armor piercing from stability do anything for explosive weapons.
---
I guess I'm just asking if armor has any effect on explosive damage.
---
These type of things should be a community event over a week or something. We have to collect junk and turn it in to Grahm so he can build his radio beacon once we hit a milestone. Fallout needs more lengthy community events. This would be a perfect fit imo.
---
Another thing would be nice, is to be able to remove weeds and other stuff so that we don't have shit that looks like its growing through the floors. 
---
An alternative could be to have the ability to sort items by time they were acquired. Didn't see what you got? Sort inventory by newest items. 
---
You’re an intelligent person, you must know how the unsubscribe button works. 
---
Don't tell me what to do. 
---
You seem really defensive about it.
---
He was joking with you. Bethesda does this sort of thing.
---
I did two Queens so far (lvls 205 &amp; 215), both successful &amp; both with 8+ people, many above 150. To me, it was a lackluster fight of max 10 minutes. Maybe the lack of shed dwellers, maybe the fact that I'm a Excavator-based mixed-weapon build with 3x1 *Heavy Gunner*, *Stabilized 3*, *Bloody Mess 3*, *Adrenaline 3* and a Vampiric long range speedy Gatling Gun. 1500 rounds spent. I think the 45% armor bypass and the long range of the gun makes it reasonable to fight the queen. I managed to have the queen land on me most of the time, which may mean I was the only/top anti-air danger to her. The Vampiric effect even keeps me almost always at full health but I was once saved by the Medic torso as the other TSE bystanders forgot to clear the adds around me. Note that Adrenaline has to be upped and wears off, so you may have to switch to ground targets to prop up over and over.
---
For the power armor, I recommend *Power Patcher 3* and PA repaired to 200%. The increased armor DR seems to be applied before the wear calculation, which then seems to be reduced quite much with PP3.
---
The loot is mostly useless beyond getting the Ultracite Armor plans the first time. She has a higher chance of dropping armor which I have no use for in PA.
---
Noone wins a debate? I think these people would disagree with you.
---
https://www.regisjesuit.com/page.aspx?pid=707
---
I scrap all that and don't pick up mini nukes anymore. If i get a mimi nuke or missile I brown bag em.
---
Just have to give some respect to Eve. I've only dabbled in it but the amount of player control over the game is truly amazing. Its too boring for me but I respect the hell out of it.
---
You big silly :)
---
Sweet. Im so ready to actually beat one
---
Warframe's developer Digital Extremes pretty much outlined everything they [plan to do for the coming year](https://www.pcgamer.com/warframes-2019-roadmap/?ns_campaign=article-feed&amp;amp;ns_mchannel=ref&amp;amp;ns_source=steam&amp;amp;ns_linkname=0&amp;amp;ns_fee=0), while they haven't given specific dates it does a lot to inspire confidence and keep the community hyped for things to come. If your looking for an example of a company that knows how to handle it's community, DE sets a pretty high bar that I wish more companies (Bethesda included) would aspire to copy.
---
I am on PS4:
---
**1)** If your weapon breaks it clears out any other weapons you had readied.  This is disastrous and ridiculous because weapons mostly break in the heat of battle when one most desperately needs to be able to switch to a readied weapon as quickly and seamlessly as possible.  When a weapon breaks one almost always needs to be able to press left on the D pad to switch to whatever else is readied or they are going to die because they can't afford route around on their pip-boy for 30 seconds or more while weindigoes and death-claws are actively trying to eviscerate and eat their entrails.  *"Ooopse, my melee weapon broke – I had a powerful gun readied, but screw all my backup plans I better just stick to fists to try and finalize this loosing battle!"*  **WHY?!**
---
**2)** It really seems the more desperate I am to use a stim-pack mid battle, the more likely pressing right on the D-pad will instead call up the gestures and emoji menu, typically guaranteeing my untimely death despite having 30 stimpacks and having planned on hunkering down for a prolongued engagement.  Some of this probably comes from actually pressing "down" slightly on the D-pad instead of just right as a result of shakiness in the heat of battle, but for something that basically ruins your ability to fight it is pretty crappy design that it is so closely associated with a critical battle button anyway.  That said, it has gotten so bad that I often just stop looking at the screen and try to very slowly and carefully depress just the "right" button on the D-pad ... and yet it often still calls up the emojis and gestures screen condemning me to an untimely demise.  Fixing this alone would reduce the amount of inhuman screeching and expletives that accidentally ends up being transmitted to other players from my mic by about 99.999%
---
**3)** I can figure out any remotely convenient way to determine if I already know a plan or not before buying it.  I sit there and stare at plans for sale and there is no way to know if I have already read them without going to find the coresponding crafting bench or my C.A.M.P. and seeing if I can build that, and then wander all the way back to the vendor and see if the vendor is still carrying it after this 10 or 20 minute detour.  This is completely ridiculous, just mark it with like a little "(known)" or something if you already know the plans when you see it in inventories, vendors, etc...
---
Many MANY people will lose interest instantly if they have to start new and this will do nothing to prolong the game
---
Some of the stuff here is useful when you get through the circle jerky stuff 
---
Definitely a lot, I dont want to guess but I would say that I got my moneys worth. It's a bummer because I would continue to play this game even longer if I had a reason too. 
---
Like, I've got over 1000 hours in Borderlands 2, or I've got to be close to it. I wasnt going to stop playing the game just because I got my moneys worth. I kept playing because it was awesome. 
---
Same kinda thing with FO76, I would keep playing even though I feel like I've gotten what I paid for, theres just no reason at this point because the games flaws are more apparent and harder to ignore after playing so much.
---
If Bethesda would just fix some *simple shit* and improve the QoL of the game just a little bit, I'd probably play 100s of hours longer. 
---
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zm9yAx-_ihEKLI-DRnk5_LGFiIgR7HXd/view
---
True... but it just seems like the board gets a little too focused on negative criticisms when there is patch news. I thought it was high time to show some appreciation!
---
No. Because then you would just shriek even more bullshit than you already do now every time something changes on the roadmap.
---
I guess I'm just used to games like CS and Total War where DLC is usually teased, a trailer drops, and then you get it. I've never really seen road map but I'm also not an MMO guy so maybe it's just the genre.
---
Agreed! I have a lot of caps saved up for this!
---
Save your SPECIAL points until you've played the game for a day or so. Gaining the first 10 levels is pretty easy - don't waist them. (*Guilty*)
---
Its possible to "select a point", flip through your available cards, and then back out without using your point as long as you don't select a card. I do this alot as I'm planning where to use my points. 
---
I use Xbox and if you use the right and left buttons you can flip through the different SPECIAL  categories. This allows you to add your point to Strength but select an Intelligence card.
---
-- I'm not sure what buttons to use on PS4 or PC.
---
If you already have the card it will say 1x, 2x, or MAXED, underneath. You can merge cards to upgrade them which makes the game tell you you have 1x card vs the correct 2x. By viewing the card you will see if you've upgraded it or not. This is another trap that you can waist points.
---
Good luck &amp; welcome to Appalachia!!
---
I hope they do
---
Thanks! 
---
Can't wait to check it out!
---
This is a great idea, even if it was an atom-shop thing it would still fill a niche 
---
But, I can’t imagine they could make that many interesting bases that will be able to deploy in 90% of the map, I’d imagine that’s really going to be the limiter 
---
On second thought, they could provide plans that are “deployed” on a set size foundation, so they would have blueprints that deploy on a 2x2, 2x6, or 4x4 base and the user would be required to figure out how to place the foundation pieces to make it work 
---
I’ve really wanted to rename my furious buzz blade a weedwacker. 
---
Should have left a bag of fertilizer.
---
Yep. The sale price just kept going down since launch, even without the holidays it's still on sale now. And when I asked customer support if we were getting atoms since it was 40% off 9 days after launch (like some people on Reddit said they were getting atoms because they were refused a refund), Bethesda customer support said no and to basically just buy Bethesda games when they're on sale. Lol. 
---
What do you use as explosives build now?
---
I think what he means is mute in game voice chat, most people are going to gang up with friends and voice chat through Discord regardless. The only way I can see people meeting up through in game methods is having a proper text based chat system.
---
All of the interfaces are shit.  Bethesda really needs to look at the mods that have been written for this game and FO4, and copy them.  And reward the authors.
---
My game, my experience. That's why I live games. Especially ones i can mod.
---
Right now there's really no reason to carry explosive weapons around. Mini nukes weigh 6 lbs each and missiles weigh 2 lb each, and the missile launcher is like 45 lbs and the fat man 20 lbs, and my shotguns and rifles take up 80% less weight but still do a lot more damage than these guys. Seriously what's more believable, a gun killing a scorchbeast, or a fucking fat man? 
---
About the only thing the assault rifle has over the handmade.. is the reload speed.  Assault rifle reloads in like half the time of a handmade.
---
Its pretty much the same on console (Xbox).... Can't speak for everyone.
---
That being the said, mini nuking camps and low level raiding can be fun.
---
Yess large plots of even land is hard to come by. And thanks! Worked pretty hard on them!
---
It makes a loud alarm sound. Pretty loud too, very noticeable.
---
people rarely come back in any serious capacity, especially if there are new games in the same genre (like anthem coming out with coop pve soon). if you are having fun in anthem why would you go back to 76 that you were bored with
---
I believe I bought mine at a Responders vender bot when I was still under level 15
---
Don't put ideas in their heads
---
The 4% is probably on the high side by that stat.  I've had 4 players engage me in PVP since launch.  I have the kill 20 players just from people asking me to kill them to stop the bounty.  
---
A pvp mode where you dont pvp but work together, that makes no sense
---
Normally I'd agree, and I think they should keep it vague for that reason. But in this case, when there seems to be a risk of losing players, having some indication for what may be coming might get people to stick around longer
---
It says your offline. Invite? Gt: Sic Pyromaniac
---
Well shucks..... Can I has my 500 atoms?
---
I feel your pain.
---
They did say allot of the dlc they drop will be from our feedback, so I don't see us getting a roadmap for anything more than fixes as need like we are already getting.
---
Bugs as severe as those the game launched with, mean THE SOFTWARE ISNT FINISHED. That its literally, objectively not fit for purpose, or use. This isnt an opinion.
---
I've only had one server say I couldn't place my camp. Must be popular on other consoles.
---
I don’t think it’s new. About a month ago I was running from some mirelurks at the golf course and ran into someone’s camp. I flung the door open to hide. The player was there and killed the mirelurks. On my way out I noticed the turrets were broken, the mirelurks I’m sure, and I was able to repair them. 
---
You people complain about such trivial shit.....
---
Have they added Paints and things for the Ultracite yet?
---
Pvp servers are coming March at earliest, I’d be VERY disappointed if we get no other new content until then, it took them 4 months to fix the damage bug and add known plans tag, another 4 months for extra stash space perhaps? And then survival mode drops and of course they’ll focus on fixing it .
---
I don’t even bother logging in anymore 😂
---
Are you trying to solo her?  Because yes, that's a waste of time unless you're stacking bobbleheads in which case it's pitchfork time.
---
This is great lol. You should edit in audio from the movie to give it that final touch. 
---
Also what kind of psychopath uses the binoculars??? 
---
this game...lol.  so wish it was good.
---
I already see problems with this list, like Ski sword being listed as 2 handed.
---
I got bored by level 30. Played casually for a few hours and haven't been back in since.
---
No has always been the case, you a good Samaritan .. would be cool if they got a messaging saying somebody is repairing their camp instead of destroying it.
---
Yesterday had my camp destroyed by an idiot in PA and TSE. Shadow2063 you know who you are, you got blocked and reported twice ... keep it up.
---
Tbh I've avoided Whitesprings like the plague just cause I almost always drop..... 
---
You said I should be playing EA games. EA has been known for the better part of a decade for preying on their player base and producing garbage. I wouldn't call it a compliment? Would you?
---
Couldn't agree more. I wonder why it's only coming out in March then?
---
So do you
---
You're pretty safe in not going to the Motown airport, it's not that exciting. But it's hilarious to me that they recreated it so painstakingly!
---
Why waste time with games at all. Go outside lol.
---
Oh because people actually enjoy it.
---
Oh god no. I know i cant solo here haha. Every time ive done it, its been between 8-12 people
---
I played most of the game in excavator armor because I hoarded too much junk. It's a vicious cycle. Playing in power armor makes the game so easy that pretty much anything other than scorchbeasts gave me a net gain of healing supplies. I don't use pharma farma because I have too many already, but I use super duper and chemist when diluting stims, which essentially gives you 2.6x the healing. 
---
&gt;ZERO player icons on map
---
Maybe make it so that if you tag an enemy player with a recon scope, they are marked on the map for a while.
---
I went back and checked the data mining plan list, and it's not there. That's the most reliable resource I've found for if it exists. Not if you can get it, but if it exists. I'm pretty sure it doesn't 
---
I only used level 1, it worked well to knock things over, but I don’t think it did a significant amount of damage so the annoyance of having to take off power armor or flip the cards to go inside at whitesprings wasn’t worth it. 
---
If your running through groups tagging everything, I could see it being useful, but Tesla bracers does the same without the knock-down, and without the card usage 
---
I personally got about 100 hours before the fatigue kicked in so I have no complaints because that's good value for money.  In saying that bethesda bragged about it being a have that would be played forever.  As well as the fatigue hitting so hard I can't imagine ever wanting to play again.
---
It might be a while. I've only seen people do flat trades with those armors, nobody is accepting caps for it because most likely they already have max caps
---
I think it's kinda shitty that the game lauchned with only 1 endgame repeatable mission, and it's one that gets tiresome.  It should have launched with at least 1 vault accessible.
---
Hmmmm not quite accurate. Many corporations and countries have been lead that way throughout history
---
There's a data mined spreadsheet I have from some brilliant soul here in Reddit. I can't say it's perfect, but it's what I've been using, and what I've seen proven correct in my small fraction of actually finding rare plans.
---
Wowzers, that's three builds in one!  I have the perk mod so I can easily store them, which has been helpful for crafting. How do you do with say your melee perks and rifle perks loaded at the same time? Do you still hit for a decent amount of damage with both loaded and without all the lucky crit/vats cards on deck either?
---
If I wasn’t clear, players would make up both factions. So you would PvP whenever the other faction tried to take one of your bases or workshops or you just come across them in the wilderness. I’m looking for TeamVsTeam not 1v1v1v1v1v1etc. 
---
Yeah, it would be much better if the map had some dedicated PvP area or at least some meta region that easily lended itself. I guess the survival server will do that, but a lack of it on the regular servers makes pvp pretty much always accidental. 
---
I certainly wouldn’t oppose a buff. I retired my 50 cal for the quad assault rifle I picked up since 80 bullet clip is nothing to sneeze at. It sounds pretty tame with a suppressor I must admit
---
Its unfortunate tbh.
---
They haven't actually fixed duping so even if survival is new characters it won't matter.
---
I bet they'll spend more time policing their leaderboard than making meaningful content.
---
Survival is just some modified ini's. How it took them from mid dec to late jan to even announce a beta perplexes me.
---
The reality is the dev team is completely out of their league and its unfortunate.
---
Thank God mhw has its customer appreciation fest on now till feb 21st then division and anthem will be in reaching distance.
---
What the hell I’ve never even heard of this and you’ve had it happen “lots of times”?! Some people get all the luck..
---
I think they should adopt something like what Fortnite does with Seasons
---
If your on Xbox I’ll build you a dope pad if you give me the materials, long time ago I put up a post offering my services as an architect and nobody responded. I like building and my CAMPS tend to look like real houses. Usually takes about 45 minutes to make a place l, you just pick your spot and I’ll do my thing.
---
Hopeless lol I had a level 5 2 shot double barrel that can wreck with just a few levels of shot Gunner perks. No one will like PvP
---
Read the previous Inside the Vault and this one. While Survival mode is separate from Adventure, your existing character can be used in Survival. While this may sound like a high-level, two-shotting wet dream, they also risk losing those weapons. A level 15 could sneak up on a level 90 and slash them, take their two-shot handmade and Instigating Super Sledge, quickly run to a stash box and there you go. 
---
They really need to take from the books of Sea of Thieves. They salvaged their game by releasing weekly videos talking about content updates and other plans on top of gaming livestreams and consistent communication across their various social medias and forums. They need a face for the game that we can talk to and relate with that acts as the bridge between the devs and the community.
---
Playing the game with these limitations makes the game more challenging. 
---
Frank Lloyd Wright would be proud.
---
There is some weirdness happening spatially when resetting a camp. I had one built into the monorail support right by the monorail elevator. Took me a good hour to build. Upon my next login, I got the message that it couldn't be set. There wasn't another CAMP there, so I can only guess the servers couldn't figure out how to set it back in that spot. I've seen plenty of times where I couldn't set something where I clearly should be able to. It happened in FO4 as well. 
---
I eventually found a good spot on a cliff face that is inaccessible unless you fall to it and take a good knock doing so, or have power armor on. That's if you can even see it. It's not visible from the ground as it's blocked by trees, and you have to be in just the right spot to see it from above. Nobody has messed with it in the several weeks it's been there, and I only very occasionally get a couple molerats that will spawn in my garden. I like moving my CAMP around to different spots, but I think I'll keep it where it is. 
---
Just to say about point 3, it was in the ‘Inside the Vault’ for the 24th that the ‘Known Plan’ idea will be implemented in the update at the end of this month. 
---
My buddies and I have been wanting this since launch. I rarely pick locks and hack terminals anymore because I’m just lazy, if I had half a dozen load outs I could pick from easily. It would be a huge quality of life improvement 
---
This game has the worst servers I've ever seen. This type of server performance is understandable during launch week. Maybe even launch month. But it's been awhile now and still they are shit.
---
Awesome
---
It might end up being the type of game you take breaks from but then rejoin periodically for the immersion in that world. For some reason I always become obsessed with fallout games and could see myself going back to binge on any new content updates for as long as it's supported. That said I'm definitely taking my time getting through the wasteland and could see reaching \~250 hours before getting bored.
---
In FO4 that's about the point where I started modding, eventually making mods etc. We'll see if the updates and social updates are enough to keep it going.
---
I want to make a real life QoL request: millennials, kill yourselves.
---
Camden park is reliable.
---
Its not hard but annoying. I don't like how the tagging changes the playstyle. It just feels weird so i ignore invites and go lone wolf 24/7.
---
Then you have a ton of caps to make up for the loss? And if neither of you have the caps, then just make trades with people who have a better rep.
---
It's much more fun when you do the game with friends. Set high goals, too, like killing Legendaries until you get a full set of a certain armor. Then set a goal to find the materials to upgrade it to what you want. 
---
Why not you don't have to purchase this but I would
---
I liked it very much made me smile
---
Fine, fine, I'll add this to the list of things I have to do in the game.  Sounds very efficient.  Thanks for this! 
---
I would be thrilled if I just had camp and combat perk loadouts. I always tend to go fight the queen with ammosmith, chemistry, and super duper on. 
---
Meh, I’ve heard the same in every group about someone accidentally doing one thing or another, but as long as I keep seeing that explosive + perception quad hunting rifle for sale I’m not going to be worried about that personally 
---
Definitely had mixed results, only done about 4, one time we simply couldn't drop her, nothing was doing her enough damage, 30 mins later and she still had a good 1/4 health .. other times she is down, so I guess people who know what to do. I was use melee and a explosive shotty up close
---
So I went over to where the red starts at the top of the map for Cranberry Bog last night and found a sweet ass cliff that had a PERFECT spot for my CAMP.  Since It wouldn't let me just place it, I rebuilt.  It was glorious.  Nice sunset view.  I was so happy.
---
Until
---
Three damn scorchbeasts came just roaring out of nowhere and veribots were targeting them and so were my turrets and well.....I died.   
---
I'm new to that part of the map so I could have mistakenly placed my camp in a really bad spot, but if anyone saw me running around just getting blight and dieing, well, you're welcome for the show.
---
If they removed levels on items, then damage would have to scale with character level.
---
Give us more bosses, and make them actual *events*. The SBQ isn't an event, there's a big bad, and a lot of other bad shows up. Give us objectives! Give us side-missions!
---
What if for the SBQ, we had to fire up a lure from the Free States to ground it?
---
Orbital strike from the Enclave?
---
AA-Turret from the Brotherhood?
---
And hell, even just give us extra shit, like "A huge wave of scorched are coming from the Northwest, if they get to the Queen, they'll help her somehow!" so people have to stop the wave.
---
Make shit more interesting than shooting at something flying that doesn't care about you until it lands, and you murder the shit out of it
---
qol or basic functionality for a MMO?
---
I believe Phoenix is separate. I've sold those two bots a ton of stuff before and afaik, never ran both out from the same trading instance.
---
&gt;Do people just pick up and dump this game?
---
Given the game's horrible state at launch, and its state right now which involves pretty much the worst server stability of any online game in the world, frankly I don't blame them.
---
Doesn't your player location disappear on map when you're crouched?
---
once he spawns, he'll travel the roads for a bit, but eventually he'll despawn; he's not a persistent actor and doesn't have a fixed route/schedule. i'm not sure whether the despawn is time-based or distance-based, but it's why you'll see him on the roads in what seems like the middle of nowhere from time to time. if you saw him by the bar, someone had probably recently been near the charleston junkyard or mount blair.
---
workshop hopping is just the best way to get him to spawn afaik. 
---
How did the robo brain hurt it?  Are wendigos allergic to smoke?
---
Yep yep nope yep... In no particular order 
---
Wait, xbox has app based text chat!?!?
---
lol Nice, I ran into 3 glowing as a random encounter just to the right of WhiteSpring, first time I saw so many together ..
---
Well, before we can make more end game content for PvE servers, we need to create PvE servers.
---
So, get on that, Bethesda!
---
I understand the frustration. But some of us vault dwellers are just along for the ride through the good and shit 😂😊
---
Got what?
---
All of them except herbivore because.. class freak!
---
Nuclear launch detected
---
Yeah, I said it was brotherhood, you can hear him talk about Taggerty. I just wanted to list the vendors it's easier to look over than the rest, sorry if it wasn't clear.
---
Walking in circles and jumping around people is how I say hello without poping on the mic. So I guess thay she just expected a hello herself.
---
*bugged since FO4
---
I must just play with some die hard fallout lovers lol
---
I dug through the ESM and it looks like you're right that SD4 is just assigned wrong, not that anything is swapped.  Oh well.  At least they don't weigh anything!
---
Melee meta 
---
I've had that bug for so many legendary enemies, but today i had a few legendary enemies drop multiple legendary items :D bless todd, the RNGesus
---
This creates an issue when trying to hop servers. Billy wants to hop servers to farm Legendaries. Beth is his friend, and Beth is playing too. Billy keeps hopping servers...onto Beth's server. Yippee!
---
I built mine there too. Roleplaying a Randall Clark type survivor
---
And you are the exact person who talks shit out of their ass because its easier to insult somebody who you disagree with instead of considering their points. If you were something else than free junk, as far as PvP is concerned, you'd pick up the challenge. But I guess you are one of those persons who thinks they are so knowledgeable that any discussion with them is a sin, yet when survival mode comes out, separated or not, you wont even participate because that will not be a welcoming environment for arrogant and simultaneously incompetent people.
---
Yeah, i have the build for melee. Once I drop some stuff, ill include it
---
Np. There's tons of vendors whose caps are unlinked. You can make, like, thousands of caps in a single trade run.
---
Well, the way people complain about what needs fixing, you'd think they would've thought it a major update.
---
I find it funny when my buddy only has one power armor leg on....hoping around. I do wish they would fix it though. 
---
Is that a Ulfric Stormcloack roleplay? 
---
Next update: 2 QUEENS!
---
Totally. If this pans out, excellent find. Someone owes you a beer (or whatever)
---
I'm just about to hit 6k atoms, and I'm probably going to continue banking them for a while unless things change.  Even the few items on the shop that I kinda sorta want to get don't appeal to me enough, at the prices they're set at, to spend the atoms I'm getting through gameplay.  I might cave and get a pipboy skin.  Maybe.  I dunno.  I still feel like I'd be wasting atoms in some way.
---
It doesn't help that there are practically no skins to find and craft through gameplay for clothing.  Can't change the color of shirts or pants or hats.  Can't tint armor pieces (they change with modifications, but not always in a way you want).  The first time I saw paintcans with paint in them I assumed they would go towards painting armor and power armor, maybe even weapons, but they're just scrap.
---
Makes the skins I see in the shop more frustrating, because I know those also aren't tintable.  If I buy a skin or pack of skins in Warframe, I know they all have several details that can be tinted individually, so I'm getting something a lot more flexible and worth the price I pay.
---
Not sure why they haven't done something similar in FO76, even if they kept the palette limited so things didn't get too silly, with super bright colors or rainbow outfits.  Though they seem to be embracing silly with the atom shop, so it wouldn't be breaking from the norm they're trying to create.
---
I role play as a mercenary. My rate is 2,000 caps an hour. How does that sound partner? 🤝
---
Yeah I guess it’s a waste of time for the people who don’t want the new game mode but what about the people who do want it? Should they just go fuck themselves? 
---
Plus the game is laggy as hell for a FPS game.
---
Happened to me last night after I picked up a 1 star chameleon arm piece even though I never equipped it.
---
No... that's pretty dick-ish. 
---
Fucking awesome. Thank you for this!
---
ok thanks. Add a leader bobblehead for 5% more.
---
Automatic (faster ROF in vats) or shotgun. You’d want to be constantly firing off crits.
---
That said, I’m not sure how useful it would be. I mean it could be fun, and honestly nothing in this game ends up being too hard past a certain point. 
---
Be cool if you could make it stack w/ friendly fire.
---
define handsomely lol
---
what platform. just found one
---
Yeah. I have my Xbox set up on on my main monitor.  
---
Xbox app on a secondary monitor (From PC).  
---
When I am couching it, I use the Xbox app on my phone (which can be a little janky but it gets the job done.)
---
Just set up camp next to the vault tech 
---
This is the exact question [I asked yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajil6v/is_bethesda_even_aware_of_the_actual_problem_with/?st=JRCIY5E5&amp;sh=8d5719c6), but just worded differently. 
---
Will they fuck...... they have your money and don't care a bit for the game. It was a just a way to fund their next two games.
---
I don't understand *any* rpg in this day and age not having color tinting options for armor.
---
We've had armor dyes with RGB sliders since Everquest in the early 2000s. It's pretty damn simple.
---
First time I had to kill something big, before I had gear, etc. I rebuilt my camp and put a bunch of turrets on it, then lured the thing back to there. 
---
I have like 11 luck!!
---
On PS4 I think I have someone else that can do it
---
My only concern is the End-game Content, i have high hopes for devs but from what we see as a PvP mode i don't know, some concerns are there to be fair.
---
&gt;What was the name of that Holotape I just picked up, again?
---
Then I wish there was a log of any sort.
---
That would just be a massive buff to melee.
---
Vats is arguably the only gun build that is on the same charts as melee.
---
They released the "Inside the vault" yesterday and talked about the survival mode, a community manager said they have some pve content slated to release around the same time as the survival mode beta (around march) but he didn't specify if it was end game pve content or not
---
Just because I'm friends with someone doesn't mean i automatically want or need to be on the same server as them does it?
---
I play Heavy Gunner but you can find lots of info on rifle builds here if you search.
---
np
---
Grafton or I'll sell one on ps4
---
My GT is GuentherLR I am at that quest as well
---
So players just lose double caps when killed by another player? What happens when someone has no caps left?
---
You wearing vanguard outside and of power armor?  Or Bolstering?
---
Agreed.  I've launched a nuke and killed the SBQ.  I now have no reason to log in.  I am happy with the game, I feel I mostly got my moneys worth, but I am done with it until they release more content.
---
Checked the FO 4 wiki, it says that Lead Plating gives +100 rad resist and is applied under 'Shielding' which if I remember right is the frame? 
---
Range is the key.  If you are firing at long distance, you are just wasting bullets.   The biggest thing I see is lots of people firing and doing no damage while it is in the sky.  Meanwhile the snipers who can rack up some damage, are hopping around unable to get off any shots because the ground forces are chewing them up.  A little bit of collaboration would go a long way.
---
No, it’s not the homeowner’s fault. They will still try to arrest the thieves. Sure you can do things to make it harder, but ultimately, it’s the thief’s bad behavior that is the problem. An unlocked door does no harm on its own.  
---
&gt;Energy Weapons are one of the most powerful in Fallout 76. 
---
Zero credibility.
---
do you have any normal armor legendary effects that boost your damage? those dont work in power armor
---
Just workshops be it spreads to your team.
---
You can go claim a workshop then cancel without the person knowing, go find them and kill them.
---
Its a shitty exploitable system
---
i keep seeing this posted but only 2.8% of players reached level 100 on ps4  
---
more people killed 20 players than played pve long enough to reach 100
---
Wow, thanks BGS for adding basic functionality we have been asking for, for three months now!
---
I believe if you use the Perception perk that allows you to see the resistances and HP of your target in VATS, those numbers will actually change if you have an armor pen weapon or armor pen perks equipped.
---
Using this someone early on tried different combos of armor pen and could see that resists never actually dropped to zero.
---
What about this post is circle jerky? The fact that others agree and you don’t? 
---
I know for me I don't engage when people have the trade icon above their heads because the last time I did the person wasn't looking to trade something they had, they were looking to request stuff in my inventory.
---
Look dude, I know I have a ton of (non-duped) stims, meds, canned coffee, and an unrealistic assortment of nuka colas. Stop tagging things in my inventory. 
---
I'd prefer a "psssst! hey buddy I've got some \_\_\_ I'm trying to unload" like a shady dealer in a trenchcoat in the alleyway. At least they're honest.
---
That or make post nuclear factions that are supposed to be on the rise since you got access to  nuclear arsenals. You get extra points for your factions if you nuke another factions hq.
---
I like the idea of bos Vs enclave Duke it out competitions, but whenever I wanna check on modus for mods or plans it would mean that I would be invading enclave territory if i was in the brotherhood. And that would be a mess constantly
---
I'm ok, got some other guys for free
---
A power fist called fisty mcfistface a shotgun called shotty mcshotface a fatman called fatty mcfatface I’d be living the dream 
---
Honestly a great idea. They have to add stuff like this for the long term to keep people playing the game. 
---
Of course not. But with so many glaring issues with Fallout 76, and so many fixes and features being widely requested by the community on a daily basis, turning their attention to a new game mode that will only cater to part of the players is not a smart move (or it is, depending on what they have in mind, possibly getting more people to buy the game or get more profit out of those lunchboxes that may be coming out soon). They should be 100% focused on getting rid of duping methods, incentivizing trading between players, adding more quests and end-game content, fixing some game-breaking bug, that kind of thing.
---
Yup, was thinking of the chipmunk head.
---
Usually I roleplay as the Big Lebowski, but this shot wasn't part of the film.  Here's one for reference:  https://twitter.com/pilkro/status/1084209371003928582
---
explosives are good for softening up hordes as they close in.
---
You aren't supposed to fixate on one weapon and expect to use it forever.
---
Please stop with this. Sorry but half the reason they make an online game is for PvP. This has huge potential and I agree they have to do it right, and I understand you are a casual player but don’t try to ruin it for the people that actually want PvP because a good amount of people do want it. 
---
Nah, recon scopes are already wallhacky enough.  What’s the justification for them showing on the map? How is the scope tracking them if they fasttravel to their camp? (Does survival even have fast travel? I assume so, so much of the game design is based around it)
---
Same here, man. I uninstalled it two patches ago and went back to Rust. I may take a peek when MANY revisions are made (i.e. Ultrawide aspect ratio support \[not stretch 16:9 to ultrawide support\], servers that don't break, and dudes just exploiting the crap out of the game), but doesn't seem like that will be any time soon.
---
I have traded once.
---
I still have no idea how to trade.

Scorched officers are carrying the same code multiple times
---
One it's not your game, it's the culmination of thousands and thousands of hours of people far more experienced in story telling, world building and player engagement than you will ever be. Sure it's your experience, but I don't know why you would actively ruin a work of art, your funeral (shitty game experience not intended by the devs and 99% in all likeliehood breaks that complex systems they have in place effectively ruining the game for yourself.)
---
Ill poop in your cereal and call it an improvement, how about that?
---
 I’d like to be able to simply delete cards.
---
Shuffling through cards I no longer need just to get to those little lockpock cards is killin’ me.
---
I tend to enjoy PvP atmosphere because it creates emergent gameplay, but I don't like to kill other players unless its for wasteland justice. Right now PvP just isn't worth getting involved with, the anti-griefing measure are easily manipulated to grief other players.
---
Without VATS you may as well go play any other shooter game. The VATS is the foundation of fallout from blowing off heads to crippling arms and legs.
---
Shhhh they'll fix that.
---
I still find some enjoyment from the Queen but after they nerf my TSEs I don't know if I'd be able to take her down with my regular group.  Coordinating with a larger group is fine but if they expect that they need to add guilds or other in-game organization.
---
Might be the latter, but that isn’t useful to us as players. More helpful to have it sorted alphabetically (while still maintaining whatever internal timer that removes them from the list)
---
NEVER
---
This is the workaround I employ. The item I drop to test for a bag tends to be either a grenade or ammo I will never use
---
Yeah, that seems to not work 100% of the time.
---
nope, can't say I would ever do that
---
I use all of them minus vegetarian. Since I have carnivore.  
---
Harder is one thing... i've scraped 10 and gotten nothing... 2 today alone... the game is evolving into a make raadium gun/scrap exercise... which will get old fast
---
Same. That’s the way to go tbh. 
---
PC, Bethesda Net Id: Commanderbass
---
You’ve always been able to. I frequently come upon camps in the savage divide whose owners are lower levels and since I’ll spawn much higher level mobs I’ll clean them up and repair their stuff for them, seems like the decent thing to do.
---
I spend 25k caps a week on fast travel alone. 
---
That's very obviously an incorrect statement. 
---
No he's right, kill him and take what's yours! Ad victoriam! For the Brotherhood!
---
Everyone's just gonna fast travel to Vault 76 because it's a free travel and the area around it does't allow nukes to be dropped.
---
I'm level 63, never traded and only spoken with like 4 people. Cant say I have, no. Now, mad at BGS for getting disconnected yes.
---
Actually yes.   Vanguard alloyed metal chest piece
---
You're thinking IV bags. Those will break down for plastic. The bloodpacks you can convert into stimpacks, double if you have chemist wth a chance to proc multiple with super duper and then further multiply into diluted. 
---
Are you wearing underarmor?  That used to screw with the damage numbers if you had that on and entered PA.  Not sure if they patched that yet though.  
---
I can see what bethesda is trying to do, this mode is less about immersion and more of a score attack system. They are hoping to entice griefers over to the new servers by giving them a arbitrary ranking based on how many people they grief. I have no qualms about this idea, just wish it would force you to keep your character there.
---
If item =&lt; 100000 then flag_for_review simple code that I think is already in use. I feel like a passed this line of coding before in the data files.
---
It gives lots of rads but has zero disease chance :)
---
this is neat lemme try this right now
---
While I love fo76 for many many reasons it seems very softcore to me, so yes I'm happy for the ne w mode as its what's gonna keep me playin. Even without the new pvp mode tho there is major balancing and major exploits that need to be addressed such as bobblehead stacking among other things that will benefit everyone not jus the pvp ppl. I kinda feel some adjustments are comin to adventure mode to suit the no pvp co-op style and restricted pvp style soon tbh. I'm not slamming anyone for how they want to play, but I'm def not the only person who wants this and if you look at other threads theres alot of support for this. And for me personally I want all the new content we can get outside of survival mode but this is great way to keep me hooked. March seems kinda far to do such minor adjustments too so i think more balancing is comin with it for adventure and survival. I dont think they will keep one side happy and not the other but we shall see
---
Yes.  Weird that it goes down by 100 with PA on
---
How'd you do it? I can't get enough wires now to finish my lightning :[
---
Nice, that faster swing is awesome. I love how quick it is with that mod.
---
So this guy showed up on your recent list since you interacted in game, and then you where able to have this exchange? 
---
The nostalgia I am feeling right now is killing me so much I might as well type in "oOOooOOo."
---
Makes sense, but with 24 players, probably going to be a ghost town most of the time unless they have some compelling events to draw people together.
---
It was most likely duped, that's why it dropped in price....
---
I did say it was a long rant, not a coherent one.
---
They’re pretty fucking common. Description is probably accurate. 
---
We hear you and we're laying out what's coming for Fallout 76 in our 2019 roadmap, including new PvE content. But to provide full transparency, our #1 priority remains taking care of known issues and new user reports that you have been sharing since launch, and we’ve delayed locking in the timing for upcoming content while we stabilize and improve the core game.  
---
While we’ve made progress across many of the issues you’ve been experiencing and will continue working on those, as well as the new issues that come up, our dev cycle will soon shift towards the new content you’ve been asking for, including Vault Raids, new Quests, new Events, new PvP content, and much more. Stay tuned!   
---
why not and says who?
---
What are you talking about? Endless grinding -IS- endgame content.
---
(I almost kept a straight face typing that)
---
Hoping they sell the actually Grognak outfit in the Atomic Shop soon. That way I can dress up all fancy.
---
I hope survival mode uses character names instead of usernames
---
And then there's the launcher, which is where the real problem lies.  Frankly my Gauss is a better choice.
---
Ok so here's what you want to do.  Make sure you set iPresentInterval = 0 in your config file as shown in the video.  Now open Nvidia Control Panel / Click Manage 3D Settings (left side of window) / Click Program Settings / Select or Add Fallout76.exe / Under Monitor Technology select GSYNC / Under Vertical Sync select On / Under Preferred Refresh Rate select Highest Available.
---
Any changes you made with Nvidia Inspector regarding frame cap etc, revert to default settings.
---
Your point lol 
---
It took place at his camp, and I was able to get his XB live tag from his CAMP module, I am not sure if he showed up in my recent or not.
---
No one has tested it.
---
Its more a "I'm bored" sort of thing even though sqb isn't hard, especially if you're at the point of using those receivers.
---
Actually its more a "wtf do i spend flux on" situation
---
The inside the vault only described AID items as being additional possible drops, not weapons.
---
Grenades.  (And the Magic Boomstick, though I've sidelined that to get used to post-nerf wandering.)
---
Are you on PS4? You might the person who keeps that area occupied for me, I just want to go home!
---
No they didn't. 
---
I quote: "We’re also planning to award you double the Caps when you kill another player, and they may drop their Aid or other items in addition to their Junk." 
---
"Or other items" can mean anything. 
---
I just refer to the adventure servers as PvE servers, as I doubt we will ever see those anytime soon, if ever. 
---
Thank you!  I was wearing brotherhood fatigues.....removed them and my dmg jumped up 60 points with my pa     cool
---
Sleep in your bed, then go to whitesprings.    
---
I've never traded. There's no text chat so interactions are rather limited, like miming, pointing, and such.
---
Just set up camp near the vault tech agreclture center where fertile soil event spawns. There's a constant supply of Mr farmer boots that drop steel and lead scrap. The workshop down the road has a junk fountain and a food producer.
---
No acid or smelting required.
---
Heck, just the occasional visit can load you down big time.
---
You've also got a river with bloodleaf and snaptail, and two more rich workshops on the Western road between there and the nuka cola plant.
---
If you don't want to camp there it's still close to vault 76 so the fast travel is super cheap.
---
Any time my man. 
---
It was my last mode so far prob scrapped 30 or so by now
---
Do you drink coffee, because one of the major types of coffee bean goes through exactly that process. 
---
I know, right?  I still make Quantums to save weight and make vendor bait, but I'm seriously thinking of just using them when I'm blowing through AP like mad.
---
Look your perks will make one thing or another easier for you, if you want to be a pack rat who Carrie's things theres perks for that, if you dont want them manage your inventory better
---
Gun runner worked fine for me before I got Speed Demon a few weeks ago.
---
Are you sure you are looking at the settings dialog while logged in?
---
If you look at settings from the main menu screen it looks exactly the same, but that setting is missing.
---
Aye, unfortunately no current content *actually* required a support character, but I already have my main, and I want to have a support character ready in case difficult content does eventually come out. And it could maybe be useful for group PvP of gun balance is brought in line as well.
---
Unfortunately I don't think it's realistic to try to benefit from friendly fire and medics at the same time, as the flame weapon's fire rates are just far too fast. My main only has 120 AP but it's gone within half a second if I try to VATS my plasma rifle flamer.
---
The only reason I'd really want non-auto rifles to work would be because plasma rifle flamer goes off non-auto rifle perks, so you could have that as a backup for only 3 perk point investment (friendly fire).
---
I was hoping that maybe the bigger crits of a non-auto would make up for the slow RoF, but you may be right.
---
What you find fun isn't universal. I find it fun to be limited to small loadout of weapons and supplies, keeps me grounded and avoids players carrying a whole arsenal. If given the choice players would rather have a weapon for every occasion, this weight keeps encounters interesting as it forces the player to think about the situations that they are about to face and plan accordingly.
---
I like the weight reduction perks, most have another effect besides the weight reduction, and they help you choose between carrying a few dedicated weapons over carrying one of everything.
---
That's problematic with the new pvp direction coming into play.
---
Switching perks on the flywith loadouts shouldn't be a part of the skill that wins a fight.
---
Word I'll hit you up on when I get online, March seems too far right now lol
---
Very good to know.  Thank you for the reply.  
---
I know there are a lot of people saying trade exploits aren't real, but I don't want to risk it
---
Must have been the last patch then because they all worked prior to it. Well, squad maneuvers and gun runner, anyway. They don’t *stack* though, and strange in numbers doesn’t increase speed demon run speed as far as I can tell. I think runspeed is capped at 20% across the board.
---
when i first hit round 40ish just after release i wanted to kill a mirelurk queen in my quest to find the wetsuit and i heard she could drop it.. i kept getting killed to acid since my 10mm, pump shotgun, and 308 were doing lil to no damage to her (before duped tse's were everywhere, and i had no legendaries). i said screw it and jumped back to my camp grabbing my nuke launcher and 20ish mininukes i had been saving "for something big".  
---
jumped back out to the quarry feeling full of myself, equipped nuke launcher. strutted over within range of the queen (atleast what range was in fo4) loaded that thing and aimed, saying to myself "now what B\*\*\*\*" pulled the trigger watch the recoil.. i die..  
---
wtf  
---
respawn go back line up the shot lil closer, making sure nothing is in my line of sight and no mobs are around me.. pull trigger, watch recoil.. i die.  
---
rinse repeat 5 more times to evidently nukes hitting an invisible wall and falling to my feet and i said some things to make a sailor blush, tossed launcher and mininukes on the ground and walked away pissed and defeated. never touched another of those worthless a$$ things again..
---
I wound up using Quantums as emergency stims during my first nuked zone raid in Watoga. Delicious.
---
I’ve quit the game entirely because you all keep saying more details to come and nothing ever actually gets better. My game crashes more than ever since last patch. My personal experience is worse overall since we last got info about what is coming next. And we get no communication to bridge the gap except random replies saying “we are working on that”. A roadmap should have been done first. Fixing glitches should be an ongoing part of be roadmap. Especially when each new patch introduces new and more frequent issues. 
---
I'm totally gonna drop by and eat your food, drink your water, use your benches, and sleep in your bed.........wait......
---
And that's where you start the bloodbath =P
---
I got lucky and popped in a server last night that someone dropped a nuke on the queen and only 4 of us showed up. Took less than 5 minutes 
---
How do you get an 8 story camp? I’ve only been able to get 4 
---
I wish they had implemented something like this with the Bulldozer update. Sure it’s nice that it clears foliage and small trees (when it works) but I wish you could level the ground too. That just seems like an obvious thing, especially when so much of C.A.M.P. building is predicated on having a level foundation. 
---
oh, finally found the plans in the green chest in sugar grove at lvl 186..  
---
still hate that queen..
---
Whitespring ghoul gang bang
---
I use mostly all my free and ‘earned’ atom points on camp stuff. The turf floor and modern light wood floor still have me satisfied. Rather than a dirt floor option I instead wish we could just bulldoze and flatten square plots within our camp boundaries for free. Further, I wish we could also place any common, nondescript environmental items like rocks and trees for free
---
If PVP is decent, it's long term end game content that they don't have to do any extra work for. 
---
What do I replace it with?
---
  I think the greatest joy I get from the game is taking screenshots, but a lot of time the things I'm taking pictures of want to tear my head off. So, some sort of magnification is necessary. The rifle scope, unsurprisingly, gives a very narrow view of the scene, whereas the binoculars are much wider.
---
&gt;!Also, this was at the end of the Mayor for the Day quest, where, for one brief moment in time, everything including the Scorchbeast was not hostile to me. A fine time to relax and take in the scenery.!&lt;
---
  At one time I scrapped the binoculars. But an opportunity to take a capture of four Scorchbeasts circling what I was hoping to be my next C.A.M.P. site was spoilt by unsatisfactory optics. I grabbed the next pair I found and put them on my Favorites wheel where they belong.
---
Your rifles only weigh 12 poounds?? Sign me up!
---
What should I replace them with
---
Ya I think that's pretty much exactly what they're aiming for lol, while simultaneously trying to cater to the people who want to just play with open PvP and are tired of the current engagement system (although I think those people are probably a minority).
---
But also think that in the end, Beth is gonna go with whatever offers us some flexibility, takes less work for them, and let's you play with your friends no matter your preferred gametype (as long you're willing to play your buddy's preferred type lol).
---
This is actually a really neat idea!  I like it!  
---
"Nuclear Launch Detected"
---
Everyone starts scrambling for interior spaces =P
---
I'd be better if we could trade them or have the option to exchange as soon as we opened the perk pack free of cost.
---
I was thinking it would be a very tedious series of tasks while trying to figure out if it was possible.
---
when you go to different voting terminals around the map (I haven't been to all of them yet) many will tell you to contact different departments. I do think it may have been overlooked, but at this point in time I do not think I alone could be on a single server long enough to restart all the different infrastructure to get the database shit back going.
---
if people have the diffinitive answer that would be fuckin awesome. but if not I don't even think I can try it. like you might need to be a group leader of many coordinated individuals to actually do it. yo who wants to be prez, I'll be you're campaign manager (i kid but I'd help somebody else) lol.
---
how does the data mining work? is it finding the information as it comes up. I don't want to know too much about that though
---
&gt;problem
---
Doesn't sound like a problem to me.
---
I think Psycho addiction is -2 STR until you use a Psycho or let the addiction vanish on its own.
---
If that is their logic, it's pretty stupid. If I knew content was coming down the line, I would vacate and come back. If I sit around and don't open the game for 5 months, I'm just going to delete it forever.
---
I know for sure the 20% junk weight reduction does not stack (tested and verified) so I would have to say other legendary armor effects most likely don't stack.
---
Why are you in such a rush to level? Have you not seen the posts from people who power levelled and have since complained that there is no end-game content?
---
poe style leagues would be amazing i think! im 200% behind this
---
Tried that. 
---
He was a ghost, no name nothing at all.
---
Just saw enemies drop in front of me.
---
From what I understand the base damage is the same as a hardened receiver.  At least I know it is for a lever rifle.
---
That being said, the damage it adds to the SBQ isn't worth tying up one gun and the difficulty of getting the ammunition.  If they removed the flux component, and just made it require ultracite, it would probably be worth using.
---
It's clear this game was a commercial failure, I wonder how much staff they even have devoted to it at this point. 
---
Ha ha, yes, they saw all the money fortnite was making, so they went back in time to before fortnite came out and started making a game that is nothing at all like fortnite.
---
To answer your question, no, radshield does not suppress your mutations
---
However you get it done, just that you get it done is all that matters.
---
How hard is it to add extra enemies and some glowing ghoul packs to any area you nuke? Give us SOMETHING Bethesda, even if it's lazy and uninspired (like your ATOM store). You can't seriously expect us to wait months for new PvE content.  
---
I'm only level 41, but I regularly try to trade my plans away for free, including theoretically expensive plans, and few people seem to want them :( 
---
I quit the game a few weeks ago. I will definitely comeback if Bethesda don't allow current characters to Survival mode. They will just dominate with the OP weapons that they got from duping. You can't get those weapon now. They will have unlimited stimpaks, bobbleheads, fatman ammo.. It will be rediculous. This server should be a new clean start. 
---
1 done, 99 to go :)
---
In regard to perk loadouts:  https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a70b4m/can_we_please_have_perk_loadouts/ec0vw0i/
---
I know this doesn't exactly mean anything but bethesda has at least acknowledged that players want this.
---
My highest level character *can* switch between using shotguns, heavy weapons, or melee but I never do because it's more of a chore to do that than it is rewarding.
---
&gt; stabilize and improve the core game
---
Almost as if it shouldn't have been released in this state. 
---
ez fix, remove the glass helmet
---
I made and used one for the first time today. It was like a fire cracker, and very disappointing. I'll try again with demolition expert maxed out.
---
It's not that hard to understand. There are a few cheating assholes that run around non-stop and ruin it for everyone.
---
Where the backpacks at! And I'd love a deliverer.
---
Lone wanderer in charisma on top of the nap is good for solo character leveling and some of the soups you can craft will also give 5% experience boost for x amount of time.
---
You do realize that the survival thing is pretty much just disabling the features in game for PVE?  There's nothing significantly new to it.  They are working heavily on PVE content, the game has only been out for a few months. 
---
That's contributing to your super high armor rating outside of power armor.
---
No but missiles weigh 2lbs each
---
What console 
---
&gt; Someone here claimed he was banned for duping camp items unintentionally. 
---
Of course.  Why would anyone admit to being banned for a legitimate reason ;P
---
Platform ? Did it solo yesterday and the Robots weren't really and issue, the assaultrons were the most problematic, I pretty much ignore the rest of them .. lots of them weren't even shooting me
---
I thought they'd supposedly already fixed the scrapping mods issue in the last patch? Perhaps I am mistaken
---
Ill have to agree with op. I dont mind pvp but id rather have more content. If i want to go kill other players I will play a different game. 
---
As someone with over 600 hours in fallout 76 I feel like them talking this pvp mode is trash compared to working on new content and saying when that will be available. I wont be playing survival mode.
---
You should edit your system into the original post so people know which system you are on to help.
---
I got addicted to alcohol and quickly realized that it was a -1 CHA and -1 AGI penalty when addicted. Addictol cured the effect as expected.
---
When I try to open my pipboy right away that happens.
---
There are a ton of them around the east side of Whitespring. 
---
I think Silva has some in the SW corner of the Forest. Or the workshop to the south of that.
---
Someone in trade chat admitted to being banned for using the bobble exploit. 
---
&gt; Addictol cured the effect as expected 
---
Or even more alcohol!
---
One time I had a guy sneak into my camp while I was crafting... I had dropped some items for a friend who was upstairs getting the well tuned buff...  One of us had left the door open, and this guy walked in and took the items I had dropped.
---
Had he not proceeded to dance around and taunt us over the issue, I'd have just let it be and said "oh well".
---
But, because he was being annoying about it... I followed him to his camp and completely leveled it... then repaired the entire thing, and leveled it again while he watched.
---
I stopped playing and I got up to lvl 80 finished all the story, killed the SBQ and now there's nothing to do, I tried farming legendary weapons but the 3star enemy dont even drop a 1star so I'm done for now until I see a huge update 
---
Ah, yea same thing here. It was right at their feet a couple times and was just a small blue poof.
---
I have radius and demo maxed out. It did no good :/
---
Large tent?
---
Had a girlfriend in the early 90s who said it.
---
Maybe the option for it but I wouldn't want this on all the time.
---
How does this work? I ventured deep into a blast zone last night and had to keep up on my rad away/x consumption.
---
(Also don't wear pa, but did switch to my hazmat, ouch)
---
Can I ask.... why?
---
I've got a TSE radium rifle... but the radiation damage appears completely unaffected by TS or E.  Or any of my perks.
---
What is the exact lack of end game content mean? it has about as much content if not more than fallout 4?
---
Wow. Damn
---
Now do it with a clown outfit. Welcome to the War.
---
Really, thats what i wanted, more radiation
---
Have you tried turning it off and then turning it on again?.....j/k
---
The most likely culprit is that level 200+ player you see escorting the level 30 player who is carrying 15,000lbs of duped materials across the map. 
---
Thanks for the tips, I’ve got max line wanderer
---
Oh I’m not power-levelling, a friend did that and he’s bored as hell, I just want to reach level 40
---
I'm a PvE focussed playing and see nothing worthwhile for me in PvP and even I can see the benefit of the mode they're proposing. 
---
They have to start somewhere. It may not be perfect or even ideal but I'm all for them going forward and learning those lessons.
---
I had 8 mini nukes and 31 missiles.   
---
Queue Scorchbeast encounter near my base.   
---
I then had , 0 nukes, and 0 missles, and the scorchbeast had 1/3 HP remaining ... fun times
---
Yes lol. Could be, and could not be! I've had a few instances where I can't place mine down so looks the place is actually pretty popular.
---
&gt; All owned workshops stay owned for 5 minutes after a disconnect. Reconnecting will result as if the disconnection never happened.
---
This would be a nice change.
---
I’m using this opportunity to call once again for turning off collision physics.
---
Very well said
---
If you are not yet level 50 hold off on completing Rose's quest or your Black Diamond shan't be level 50
---
Same for me, but usually companies stay mum on what is in the pipeline as it can always be pushed back on its release date, so they prefer to only announce when everything is basically ready to go. 
---
I can't remember the name of the ski resort area just east of "Top of the World".  But it's some ski resort place, just north of the main building there is a small road that has a bunch of stalls on either side of it.  One side having a little arena type ring with a raider power armor that spawns in it (that's how you know you're in the right spot).
---
All along that path, and in a bunch of areas around it, there are a LOT of armor/weapons/chem recipes that spawn.  Run it a few times and you'll learn the spawn points.  I tend to check it daily.  Pretty sure I've picked up all the dense mods or their equivalent for each armor type.
---
Dont open your pipboy before the game fully loads u in. It can be tricky to figure out when that is. Fast travel also won't fix it
---
There is no plan.  No roadmap.  BGS has no fucking clue what it is doing.  The sooner you acknowledge that obvious fact, the sooner everyone’s suffering will end.
---
I'm really bad at this shit, my bad dude. I am going to try slowing down a bit. Probably none of it matters though so don't sweat it.
---
The fights I see usually succeed. But it requires many other players to show up and all contribute to hurting her.
---
Another thing to keep in mind is that it becomes easier to beat her if you cripple her limbs, which reduces the number of attacks and motion that she engages in. Use the various perks that have a chance of insta-crippling a limb, in order to do this easily.
---
Thank you!
---
I’d love to help, but am level 39. Add me: ProducerBoy416. I’ll be on in 2 hours. Would you be down to help me with the rose quest?
---
Yes it does. If you equip the awareness perk you can view someones resistances with the particular weapon while you use armor penetration perks or legendary affixes. It does effect fatmans and missle launchers. 
---
It's a cheat-prevention mechanism. Makes perfect sense why they've implemented it in an online multiplayer game.
---
Take advantage of grouping. That's really where a lot of the fun is. If everyone is around the same level you'll likely be on the same quest line. 
---
If you find a bored high level willing to group, they're a good resource to bounce questions off of while you play and enjoy the game. If you're on xbox at odd hours late in the night look me up gt sidedaddybear, I keep pretty consistent hours doing a sell run (vendors per faction share a limit of 200 caps that refresh every 20 real world hours. There are 7 different factions), finish any low hanging fruit daily challenge quests to accrue free atom points
---
When leveling, grabbing up the weight reduction perk cards will be a safe choice - even if you move ability points around at later levels (If in doubt you can just go shy of max ranks, you get card packs every 5? levels and one of the weight reduction ones might be in the mix). On the weight reduction perk cards you can switch them out for cards for your build later on and then they will come in handy to switch in when you're over encumbered and want to fast travel.
---
I don't think it does, fairly sure alcohol related perks are in charisma and act separately.
---
full charge, if your sprinting in power armor, that's pulling your charge down pretty fast, after the last change with fusion cores they are now at least a concern and this helps a lot
---
Traveling pharmacy is where I put the rest,  Lots of drugs, lots of weight.
---
&gt;Important to note: you can craft the lowest level version to cut down on the material costs.
---
Some people have said that some mods can only be learned by scrapping the high level version of a gun. But I have no idea if this is accurate.
---
I wish they would add bullet drop too. Sniping from 100+ yards away and getting that headshot every time is too easy
---
Gatling Plasma with Beam Splitter. Best weapon no question. 
---
Nah, a MooMoo level
---
You mean the caps I end up losing for becoming wanted?
---
Holy hell. That's amazing
---
I have it on the hunting rifle cause I think it's cool. I like the idea of having this super powerful round. I like to think the ultracite ammo is what causes the explosive effect on the rifle lol. To be fair it's not all that much more powerful and scorch are already pretty easy
---
Now you can craft the level 35 Excavator legs and have 9 whole springs left!
---
Same, server is bugged or game, trying do a hard reset. Today has been fine, but does happen. Make sure you changing to a new server.
---
Having it drop multiple times might be linked to another, bigger issue maybe
---
Nice, so it wasn't my imagination that the anti-armor autonader I had was doing nice work :).
---
Everyone knows, yeah ok smart ass
---
Let me say this. Thank god there are other games coming out within the next few months. Odds are if you play fallout you will dig Division as its the same concept of "loot everything and find good gear". Then of course Anthem which sounds like the same style of game (hoping thats good). Also you have single player experiences like Days Gone and Metro Exodus. I mean what a great lineup. I absolutely despise when im stuck to the same game for months on end, especially when its games like Fallout 76 where you do more or less the same things over and over again. Whether the updates come next week or in June, At least there is some shit to play until that time
---
&gt; It is completely outclassed by the Handmade. 
---
It's also considerably more common than the Handmade too. It's the mid-tier semi/auto rifle.
---
Can you imagine how much better launch could have been if they'd had a beta? That would have been great. 
---
amazing, I completely forgot about that.
---
must've been hit by one of those Vas Ort Flam, Kal Vas Flam halberd combos.
---
You are not forced to play you know, go do something else with your life, updates will come but they need time, don't blame devs for that.
---
It would be easy to cap farm, go to vault 76 and kill all the ppl still loading in from fast travel. They wouldn't be able to fight back.
---
Im not trying to prove my worth because lol its a game and your worth is something that you prove by taking care of your surroundings IRL.
---
What I can prove is that your arrogance is unjustified, and that most of people complaining about the PvP modes are unworthy of being called a true competition.
---
I dont know you as a person and I will not be judging you as a person, because considering ehat internet does to communication and how easy is to dehumanize opponent in a discussion.
---
Bus as a player, I already gathered enouch data about you to be fairly sure that you don't have what it takes to play nonkindergarten version of wasteland simulator.
---
i agree with this 
---
I meant to tell you because you made a statement I believe to be incorrect and wanted to state why I found it to be incorrect so peoples knowledge based on our conversation is better informed.
---
It works insanely well.
---
You need to have a minimum of one person with a level 2 in ghoulish and somebody else with a level 2 in rad  sponge.
---
Having level 3 is obviously better as it works more efficiently, and the more people in your team the better it works.
---
Rad sponge occasionally will heal 200 points of radiation on your teammates, so if you have it shared basically they have the same card equipped and you get the same effects.
---
This keeps the radiation cleared out.
---
Ghoulish will heal you up to your radiation level. The two of those bounce off of each other keeping your HP near Max. Only time you really have to worry about anything is if somebody really strong like a glowing Alpha deathclaw that's at level 91 or the Scorch Beast Queen herself comes up and starts smacking you with her wings.
---
The only downside is you need to stay Within let's say a hundred yard proximity with each other in order for rad sponge to work effectively but boy does it work.
---
The more players you have on your team the more off and it kicks off
---
Obviously you need a decent Charisma for this all the work right but it's well worth it.
---
Responders: Brotherpeople, we need your help!
---
Brotherhood: no u
---
It’ll make the regular game even more boring and lonely.
---
**OH THANK GOODNESS!**
---
Thanks to you too stranger for giving me the good news.
---
Noh
---
sure thing, i'm level 61. Just about to attempt I Am Become Death.
---
ps4 sheetsofstyle
---
Your percentages are skewed. Wheres your source for these numbers?
---
The class freak perk reduces the negative effects of mutation. 
---
Then the devs should give people’s money back until they’ve had whatever “time” they need to deliver a competent fucking game.
---
I can help on ps4. Psn?
---
You've missed the whole point of my dialogue with you. Maybe in a decade or two you might figure it out
---
What's your best place for legendaries 
---
Forget defense. I want a protectron to pick corn and take the tiny little water bottles out of the shed-sized water purifiers so that they can keep working.
---
I agree. You can’t really go wrong with alphanumeric sorting. 
---
Maybe the bugs you knew, but it seems after each update there is a new list of bugs.
---
&gt; I've got a full heavy weapons build with a meager 12 strength, and it's just depressing how little damage I can dish out with a furious exploding gattling gun, or a two shot explosive flamer. I'd rather use my melee build because it's satisfying, behind my shotgun load out, because it's even more satisfying.
---
You're either lying to me or terrible at building. My heavy weapons guy does more dps than my melee toon and my melee toon has a vampiric 40% swing speed super sledge that sits around 400-600 damage per swing. Meanwhile my heavy weapons guy has a gatling gun that does the same per shot and a .50 cal that does about half that at triple the firing speed. And my gatling gun sucks btw, its nothing special, if you have a furious exploding gatling and it sucks, then thats because you built like a fool and don't know how to use game mechanics.
---
How many points do you have in INT, 4?  Marsupials downside is -4 intelligence till you max out the Class Freak perk later on.  Mentats help some while crafting or repairing.  
---
Oh okay - thanks. So I’ve gotta grind to level 46 until then!
---
Get egghead.
---
Yep! Think I’m 3 or 4!
---
You sure you’re not on Xbox?
---
Try getting way more mutated lol. If you grab the right combo you can balance out most of the negatives except. I have like 5 and currently the only Special penalty I have is to Strength, whereas my perception, intelligence, and agility are all heightened (iirc).
---
I wanna say the Int boosting mutation is called Egghead? Could be wrong.
---
Think they could add signal flares?  Like in Fallout 4, throw em down and request support. It was in new Vegas too, although I could never get support with that NCR emergency signal
---
To clarify I haven’t meet BoS or enclave yet. I imagine they’re all robots. 
---
It would be cool to roll up to PvP with some ai support, see the other faction call in support and let things play out from there .. 
---
I want to see huge battlefields over factions lol
---
It adds a new menu that the rest of us will have to click through literally every time we go to play.  Everyone knows that the more clicks your UI requires, the more people like it.
---
I dunno man, sounds like that would take effort. Maybe we will get a nice plushie we can buy though!
---
When you start, sit there for like ten seconds. If you open the pippy you'll freeze in place. You can still fast travel, but that won't fix it. You'll have to exit the game, which sometimes brings you to an infinite loading screen. 
---
Yes, cost is not an option.. we want things to look nice. 
---
It was your choice to buy it before you see some reviews in the first place.  
---
Don't you get what everyone is saying all those years? Never pre-purchase/pre-order unless you are confident enough that the product will be up to your expecations.
---
Yeah I believe so.
---
Do you mean using traps? Do you have to have the floor trigger to make those work
---
Then maybe i need to test again. Think its been 2 patchs may have been fixed
---
This is a great idea. Would make it a lot easier at that point to uniformly clip a fence around it for plants.
---
If upper dirt floor was an option it would allow for rooftop gardens.
---
It is when you can craft the serums.
---
Nice. The introduction of sharing perks and online multiplay really has added another layer to this game. I run lone wanderer style so I couldn't acheive this personally, but that is really cool. Thank you for explaining!
---
Even in mutual PVP, the caps are far less than having spent the equivalent time scavenging.
---
Pic or it didn't happen
---
True, it sounds like it could mean anything. I appreciate the correction.
---
&gt;w
---
i only got it because some dude kept attacking me 30 levels lower and 1hko 15 times until he brought four friends and i killed 3 of the 4
---
Which I can't
---
Nah speed demon stacks with everyone in team sharing strange in numbers. Aka all 4 people have the perk and 3 chrasma and all sharing it at the same time on the same team. Not just 1 person sharing all 4 sharing
---
What kind of wasteland raider simulator is it where you don’t support the raiders. RPers keep it real
---
Just to be clear, I theorized it's already in game because of the terminal entries and the pattern of tricking government clearances(as well because the community computer generates the codes, but that's really evidence). 
---
and now I would like any hints as to whether it's either way larger than I thought and I can't do it or it's absolutely inaccessible at this point.
---
There is one at the little motel in the mire. 
---
He just slapped on the Sacrificial Blade mod onto a 3* machete he found iirc
---
power armor with a motion assist torso helps a lot already, also you can use the legendary ski sword "black diamond" which increases strength 
---
It’s Fallout 76. 
---
i saw your on pc so i cant really help you at all but until you get leveled make friends with someone that has access to ammosmith and super duper, farm the mats and then have them craft it for ya.  
---
i have done it for several people complaining about low ammo stock and ill tell them drop your steel, lead, gunpowder/plastic if needed and ill craft it till mats are gone. then i drop one round on the ground to make sure bag appears then put all the ammo made into it for em to grab.  
---
easiest way ive seen, and helps out people without access to the cards, and to keep my inventory seperate from theirs ill drop all my ammo into my stash box so doesnt get mixed up if doing something i use.   
---
you get more ammo than you would have crafted yourself and they get the lil bit of experience rewarded for crafting.
---
It needs to have multiple big baddies and other events that bring people together!! These moments are when the game really shines! Sometimes after playing with buddies I think, "holy shit I'm playing Fallout with my friends!!". I want more moments like this!!
---
Sorry I’m bad at the maths!  I’ve got the class freak maxed now at level 80, and some armor that had a + for INT.  So craft at night and pop mentats.  
---
This is great info. Now I need to see if I can use this to build my monorail-top camp that the game won’t let me build a foundation for on the monorail itself...
---
It will always be -1 (with class freak perk, otherwise it is -3 or 4). 
---
It's just a trade off really, and I personally can live with minus 1 to my intelligence as marsupial is so worthwhile.
---
That said, when doing things that benefit from intelligence such as crafting, pop a mentat beforehand. This increases intelligence, so at least it will take you to the number your special is at. 
---
Maybe just me giving them the benefit of the doubt.
---
Just recently consolidated my camp into a 1x2 cabin for effortless mobility but damn that's an incredible location
---
1. Get to lvl 50+
---
2. Move 1 Int to Str
---
3. Move 1 Int to End
---
4. Max Class freak
---
5. Get Egg head mutation
---
6. Get Kangaroo mutation
---
7. Go Play Fortnite 76
---
Can one climb that without mutations or jet pack?
---
This was roughly after first patch after day 1 patch. Roughly 2 patchs ago when i tested last
---
Legendary Armor pieces with +1 strength, Bobbleheads, alcohol, buffout, phsychobuff,  X cell, solar powered and radicool 
---
Just a foundation that let's you put plants on would be great
---
You got me lmao
---

No, I’ve seen 4star melee weapons on the bazaar a couple of times now. No sacrificial mods. 
---
Honestly man I put about 20 hours in and then I was just like.. what am I supposed to be doing here.... besides doing the dark souls environmental story telling thing which  I love I'm just like... ummm ok what do I do.... and then i got in a full squad... and then I'm like... ok so what do we do now ?
---
I climb it by jumping while wearing Power Armor. No mutation or jet pack.
---
Would this floor of leveled dirt allow us to build a water purifier inside our CAMP house?  Because if you, you have my sword.  
---
Just left the house but I would've been there in a heartbeat. 
---
Heh heh, that's why I mentioned  [Kopi Luwak](http://www.most-expensive.coffee/) above. But that's not why I don't drink coffee, I just don't like the taste. Black Tea for me.
---
Yes, start from the Obstervatory and walk/jump there. Takes some creative pathing, but no mutations or anything.
---
I’ve seen a couple of 4star melee weapons on the bazaar now (no sacrificial blade, other mods). Did you put on another 4th mod or did you find it like that?
---
Took a bit to get up there, but I say it was worth it. 
---
No probs bro don't wanna give them free caps all have TSE have taken there GTs anyway so will get them individually later
---
High levelz ?
---
You're not hearing that from Bethesda so whatever you're hearing are rumors and you should put about as much faith in them as the guy out on the street yelling the end of the world is this weekend.
---
looking forward to your really long post about the end of the world being this weekend.
---
I'm 175 there 100+ each one 75
---
I started with the BETA, still not finished everything, but I still want more, I'd be a fool to say no to more PvE content!
---
The duping glitches have been stamped out for now and the lever action rifle reloads properly. Fusion cores no longer refill themselves and the fusion core plant produces them properly. There are a host of other quest bugs and stuff that have been fixed. It still crashes and disconnects frequently. 
---
I run a pretty similar build and it has taught me some things:
---
The big ones: Marathoner only works when you're not in power armor. Portable Power only matters if you're carrying PA parts around in your inventory, so I would definitely recommend getting rid of both of those. I'd also take out Full Charge, the drain from running is pretty low and Power User will mean that your cores last forever anyway. Blocker isn't something I've ever used, but I think your strength points have better uses. Like Incisor, the single best melee perk.
---
Smaller issues: I'd recommend not running melee damage bonus and heavy gun damage perks simultaneously unless you really want to be able to switch at any time. Make a higher level set of each and swap them out depending on the circumstances. The only time I really bother with heavy gun damage is fighting scorchbeasts that won't land. I do tend to keep stabilized on because int perk slots are generally in less demand and the accuracy is handy if I want to drop some low level mooks without having to run over to them.
---
Finally: There are some other things you might want to tweak depending on whether you're aiming for PvE or PvP, what mutations you want to pick up and whether you care about quality of life perks over more directly advantageous ones. For instance: given how much time you'll spend in melee (and getting hit by diseased creatures), you could either spend the endurance slots on Vaccinated or else spend a lot of time making disease cures/running to the Whitespring fountain. Here's my build, which is largely a balancing act between hitting things in the face and enabling my hoarding tendencies: [Melee Build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f374f75&amp;d=sb2ss2se2s42sm1sn0pa0p80p90e12e60e52c72i44s12ip2id2i30a72s72a80lu2l71&amp;w=&amp;n=Quad%27s%20Melee) (with speed demon, twisted muscles, marsupial and carnivore). You can see it's not optimized for combat, but sometimes enjoying what you're playing is more important than min-maxing.
---
Oh yeah. I’ve seen that few and far between. Gives hope for when we get private servers. Her resistances are super low with low amounts of people 
---
updoots for the dude!
---
I've managed to get an extra floor by using marsupial to 'jam' my CAMP thingie into a tree. It's iffy but you can place it pretty far up a tree to get some extra verticality to your build.
---
Also I am on Xbox one before anyone offers trading and whatnot
---
I have a level 15 with a two shot black powder rifle that does 300-360 iirc
---
You dont need any triggers whatsoever. And another tip is that you cannot do my trick alone. In fact if you set up the trick, you cannot use it yourself, you only let other people use it, and they cannot be part of your team.
---
This is very much related to how the game processes the damage.
---
I do believe I said more than enough. I'll paste vid of my world record once I find a good spot to execute it. If you find it before, please let me know.
---
I mean...there are many many perks that can be valuable, but let me suggest something you might not have thought of:
---
In the endgame, the Achilles heel of melee is Scorchbeasts.  They suck.  They just spam you from the air until you log off or die.
---
Now, it may be that someday Bethesda will pull their heads out of their ass and change things...but for right now...
---
Consider carrying a shotgun as a backup weapon.  Specifically get the Enforcer perk (Agility), and perhaps Skeet Shooter (perception).  If you're really enthusiastic about VATS you can get Concentrated Fire, but I think it's more trouble than it's worth.  Just aim at the wings.
---
Now, if you do try this, be aware that you pretty much NEED Ammosmith as a card to swap out when making ammo, and Super Duper helps as well.
---
But there are real advantages to being able to ground scorchbeasts, when you get one down, you beat it to death with melee.  And then you can loot it and wonder about your life choices and where everything went wrong.
---
Welp better not ever die near any players. Healing hands workers even better then rad away. Healing hands does a hard purge of all mutations in one single go when they revive you. When a guy power lvled me through glass caverns he got dropped during the scortched king fight. Was revived by the other lowbie he was helping and had 3 of his mutations which were all of his, purged in one revive
---
Not calling *you* lazy, man. I was referring to Bethesda; that if they just removed stuff then that would be lazy.
---
You start it yet?
---
Yeah, it’s *by no means* perfect, and still has a lot of issues, but I’ve sank so much time into it and had a blast doing so
---
I’ve found 2 in a outhouse in the mire, can’t recall exact location right now I’ll get back to you if I remember
---
I won't hold my breath on that ;)
---
Your mind is just blocking out all the times you got stuck on a twig near a server boundary while fighting a nude dread lord.
---
I can one hit anything except sbq right now using grog axe or tse. I rarely use vats for anything more than seeing a hidden enemy. Really the rifle stuff stays most of the time unless I decide to use my 10mm smg. Perk mod makes it so easy. I think I have all 8 slots used. 
---
My theory: they released the gane too early. All they did since release is fix bugs and some qol changes. To give us any form of new content they are making the survival mode, because as so many people point out, its just "flipping switches". New PVE content will take a while because they had to fix important issues with the game first.
---
Personally, I am ok with that. Fixing the game was important. And PVP is a mess right now. At this point they could just disable it and it wouldnt make a difference. I am looking forward to survival mode, I am sure it will be exciting. PVP has a lot of potential in this game.
---
:p
---
How do you get so many caps? Can’t you only sell like 600-1000 caps per day, (like real world days)?
---
The only new content we will have will be objects for the camp 
---
I ran to there yesterday and remembered a video someone posted of one wrecking them, so I promptly fast travelled away. 1 out of 2 was enough for me!
---
\&gt; Why not?
---
Because it clearly doesn't work in situ. No single weapon is individually sustainable without a lot of tedious effort. That is a metagame theorycrafted approach to this game.  It clearly causes so much frustration in the people trying to use it that they feel the need to turn to the forums to complain for all manner of buffs.  
---
\&gt; Says who?  
---
Says me, a person who repeatedly advocated for nerfs to the OP legendary effects (Two Shot and Explosive) as a counterpoint to the incessant clamoring to buff everything else to match. I got what I wanted. I happily use pipe guns with no legendary effects against the vast majority of opponents I meet. (Licensed Plumber boi!) I save my good (but much more expensive to sustain) weapon systems for when those aren't doing the trick.  
---
The mainstream metagame theorycrafters are full of shit and have bad ideas about how this game is supposed to be played and they have infected the lot of you with brain worms.
---
I've found several near the Lighthouse.
---
oh god, the bramble + rock combo while running left or right gets you every time, or the small rock behind the leaves of a tree.
---
Not everyone streams / records their sessions..  
---
OP, had you claimed a workshop?
---
Lol Grahm's Karaoke channel.
---
I drop all my missiles and mini nukes. I kept them around in other fallout games to pull out when I wanted to have some explosive fun, but ammo was weightless. 
---
When I got the Kill or be Killed achievement, there was only about 10% of players had received it. 
---
As of checking it now - on xbox 32% of players have receieved it. 
---
So minimum 68% of xbox players do not partake in PvP. 
---
If you take into account, those who got the achievement for a one off kill, or killing a friend to remove a bounty, the number of true PvP players goes even lower! 
---
They are also good at pissing off everyone at whitespring when you drop one and a pack of 40 glowing mobs die and ragdoll to the ends of the earth preventing anyone from getting loot.
---
I like your style! This was by the rusty pick so I wished for robots or ghouls or anything to help me.
---
I don’t disagree.  But I also do not think the various frauds perpetrated by Bethesda vis-a-vis Fallout 76 should be swept aside with *caveat emptor* as its best excuse either.
---
My camp near Morgantown I keep it there when I play. Lot a of black berryss, some corn, tacos what ever the other one is that's needed to make your own adhesive. Other then that there's always a bunch in a wooded area outside of the starting area. Melon juice is better if your just after a drink.
---
Woot that's awesome!
---
Id say it depends on the weapon. Furious sniper rifle? Much better legendaries. Furious minigun? Yes, please.
---
Overall though, anti-armor is better
---
Thank you for the encouragement fellow responder.
---
I may be dense, but I cannot figure out the pass-through wall conduits. I’m trying to power my garage door which is on my makeshift “shed” behind my house. I have a keypad switch in the garage that opens and closes it. I’m trying to also get power to my house so I can control it from in there (I’m not paranoid, I just like the idea of security). Basically all I want to do is be able to open it from inside my house and close it/open it from inside my shed as well. Can’t get it to work. The pass through conduits are the bane of my existence. How do these things work?
---
Yeah. I think it's lag.
---
This is a great guide. As a part-time heavy weapons user I'm doing a lot of this already. Here's a few additional tips I have:
---
* If you aren't already, definitely search tag lead/acid/steel from the junk page in your pip boy and *pick up everything* that's flagged. This is kind of obvious, but really important for people who might not know.
---
* People talk about acid being a limiting factor, but as much ammo as I craft (which is as much as I can) I'm never short on it. Looked yesterday and had like 250 scrap on hand. This is all from just picking up Abraxo and random stuff like that. Basically there is lots acid in the world to sustain the lead ore you mine. Obviously some people will need more than others, but you can get away with not explicitly farming it, if you are already picking up a lot of junk.
---
* Extractors are especially great because both steel and lead give you finished materials that don't need smelting, which means even less acid. (Also I can verify steel extractors will max at 20 stored, not 10). If you need some help finding a good site to camp on, there is an excellent map of all deposits: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yza6w/i_made_a_map_of_resource_deposits/
---
* Don't forget to check inside the mine carts in Lucky Hole for lead. A few of them contain deposits. Also there's a pretty good amount of random metal items in the mine to scrap for steel, so keep an eye out and you can kill two birds with one stone.
---
* Steel can easily be the bottleneck if you are making good runs for lead ore. Again, you can organically get tons of it by just picking up tagged items in the world. Look for garages/workshops/factories and pick up all those torque rod ends and such. Lots of other stuff like fuel cans are great because you also get some other good materials.
---
* Also somewhat obvious, but one really simple, easy way to supplement steel farming is just picking up every weapon you can from dead enemies, and scrapping them all. Most people already do this to an extent, but if you really try for 100% of drops you can get a significant amount of scrap. This is another great reason to run Excavator armor, as you'll want the weight bonus for all those heavy rifles
---
* Bulk your lead scraps, it's one of the only things (aluminum is the other) that actually gives a weight reduction when bulked. DO NOT bulk steel! If you run out of loose scrap, the game will auto-scrap any mods you have in inventory before it uses the bulked steel. Most of us have probably lost mods this way, and keeping steel as loose scrap is the best way to prevent that.
---
* Gunpowder is also pretty easy to farm organically. Like you said, lower level super mutants almost always drop some. Summerville is a good place to farm them, as is the lumber mill at the far west of the map, north of point pleasant (the mill incidentally also has a good amount of metal junk around).
---
Mutations already grant substantial bonuses. I think it would have been better if it were the other way around: a legendary effect that gives you benefit for NOT being mutated. If it's good enough, then mutation ends up being at least a bit more of a choice, rather than a functional necessity at end-game.
---
I have two
---
One with excutioner limb damage weightless
---
One with bloodied limb damage blocking
---
Both with the sacrifice blade
---
Someone find one with bloodied and BOTH power attack perks hit me up
---
I have a bungalow type camp, and there is a huge tree right as you enter. My friend put a signal light on it and it looks awesome!
---
I re-enter them all the time. Seems like it’s always an armor bench. I soft lock if I try and open my pipboy too quick after loading into a server.
---
 Not as often as you say, but I have seen it in occasion
---
Its likely the players data is technically corrupted to hell and back. The game wasnt meant for people to have so much crap
---
I think you nailed it. Heck, they still have release bugs to fix.
---
or... certain items require certain skill points...   like super sledges require 10 strength.  Certain rifles require a certain perception.  OP weapons require more than 1 stat...  
---
I consider myself a die hard Fallout lover, been playing the games since I ran into the demo some 20 years ago and I'm still playing the classics every now and then. I got FO76 a month after release and I'm only level 40. So it's not so much about love for the game, it also has to do with how much time you can spend on it I think. 
---
There's probably a small team of coders modifying a bit of code to get PVP servers up and running while the rest of the coders and the entire art department are working on new content. Cool your jets.
---
Hate re-entering. It always happens when I get attacked at a workbench.
---
How about for like a commando build using like a auto assault rifle or handmade?
---
Dump the nuke in random locations too... like vault 76
---
I've read other people post that and it's never worked for me.  That fixes the slender man power armor issue by going in and out but not the disappearing teammate. 
---
Did you see patch notes somewhere?
---
furious works best on a weapon with a high rate of fire, where as anti-armor works on everything
---
&gt; Sacrificial Blade
---
I have 2 (different of it but both have "Targets bleed and are poisoned. Exceptional damage." from the mod, it is not always labeled as bloodied.
---
Thanks for this tidbit.
---
I reached that limit and was looking for a tent plan to bypass not having a roof, lol.
---
Most people just wanted co-op Fallout. But I guess Beth is trying to court the Fortnite crowd instead of their own fanbase. *shrug*
---
Where're we going?
---
It does.
---
Look like someone invite people to raid your camp with these kind word.  “Stay the fuck out my cave” 
---
Just have to grind the vendors like everything else in this game. 
---
I thought it would be a good idea to attack but not relizing you are litteraly unkillable cause of armor of chems
---
Bethesda going for the low hanging fruit... Meanwhile the closest I can come to rebuilding America is a camp 0.5 miles away from signs of human activity.
---
That would be nice have, but in the meantime this game allows you to place your crops on campfires. So what you could do is place those campfires w/crops on your rooftop.
---
Full set of unyielding will get you an extra 15.
---
If I had a private server I'm going to mod raiders and npcs back in.
---
I'd love something else to do besides farming nukes so I can play again. And not one shot everything. 
---
As someone who uses all explosives pretty extensively, my only issues are with Missile Launchers, and only against flying enemies. Flying enemies seem to be the only enemies who suffer less damage from them when they are further away (try shooting a Scorchbeast from right under it vs using a targeted rocket from farther away), which sort of defeats the purpose of both the targeting computer and Missiles in general. 
---
The Fatman is fine, except it seems to be bugged and does no damage to the Scorchbeast Queen (I shoot a test nuke at her every time I kill her, so I would have noticed a 1600 damage chunk after 30+ kills). I've seen some people say VATS crit Fatman shots do damage to her but haven't checked that myself. 
---
Overall they are fine, just the Missile Launcher needs its niche as an anti-flying weapon fixed so it works consistently and Fatman needs to correctly damage the Queen. 
---
Is it the mod or plan?
---
Honestly I went from staunch defender to leaving the game. I’ll maybe come back one day, but Bethesda made me feel like a fool for supporting them. Whatever happened to weekly updates and community quest? That week they announced better communications early December I was so hyped.. now I know that I’ve been had. Thanks Bethesda, please prove me wrong.
---
Having a separate mode for PvP is good for PvE players, it takes them away from the servers PvE players are on. So for me, bring them quick, the less I see of PvP the better. As for more content. It did sound like there would be more PvE content coming with the new mode.
---
I don't really buy that they are courting the battle royale fans. I think it was probably the easiest way to implement "new" content to the game. I doubt it required as much work as PVE expansions, which are probably 4-6 months down the road.
---
These are some of the best ideas for future updates, that I've seen
---
did you have a siezure with the emojis at the end
---
pipe pistols are in the legendary pool.
---
You're welcome. I had that problem at one spot where I only had 3 levels to build and no roof. It was irritating. But I was goofing off trying to make a Power Armor Jump Station off a cliff... and found out just how much room there was to build. There is roughly 11 floors to build in, but that's perfectly centered. And, as square blocks in a sphere goes... a lot of it looks a little 8-bit retrospectively when you look at it from afar.
---
I have a second account /Xbox so no friend needed , but that’s how u do it yup and have tons of mats and crap on everyone 
---
yes i did, they replied to a thread saying the PVP server would not be the only thing coming in march, and that there would be pve released then too
---
Grab a good melee weapon.  Far superior durability and damage.  Save your bullets for a gun that is worth shooting. Also this site is good for thinking about how you want to make your character max attribute is 15 points.

PvP in this game is just Trash... 
---
How much
---
Is there any kind of guide for how to find all available ones? I can’t seem to make heads or tails as to why some vendors have 200 caps and why others will be at 0; like how each vendor is connected to one another. Like, Why does the Sutton vendor have nothing when I sold a bunch of stuff to, say, the Lewisburg vendor? 
---
Absolutely..... would be a huge benefit. 
---
I've ended up inside many people's secure locations because their camp was where mine was.   Your no trespassing sign makes me want to move my camp there just so I can pop inside your camp sometime ;p   (kidding aside, neat location!)

Yeah inside the vault for Jan 24th

All good man, was just trying to help out. I guess in 370 hours I never really thought about the voting terminals and hand scanners. Quite interesting indeed. Thanks for sharing.

My camp is built into the side of a cliff face.. it's not movable.  If I get the can't be placed, I jump servers.

😂 thank you!

Can I actually move around special points?

I think that might be a per missile, if you manage to hit a landed SB I've noticed a difference between the two of them.

He’s either done a glitch or he’s has an ungodly character level, you get tiny amounts of space every level and it could add up.

Honestly, one of each would be dope af lol anti-armor for most enemies and furious for the bigger ones like scorch beasts and deathclaws.
---
P.S. sorry for delay, I've been commenting alot and Reddit put me in time out :'(
---
P.S.S. while I'm waiting, anti-armor is going to be super good in the PVP mode coming out, if that interests you

My Allrise eats Wendigos for breakfast after it knocks them on their ass.   If my Allrise breaks, I have a power fister that is a good backup.

There's a base dupe bug where you when you move your camp it duplicate Les everything into your storage. I moved my camo other day and had x3 my stored blueprint things maxing me out at 268% budget. You can also place all of it down I think
---
(I scrapped it all as I wanted a new build)
---
After lvl 100 all u get in perk packs are duplicates and garbage. It’s nice to have some duplicates to fine tune a build conditionally but nobody needs 10 goodest boi dog food cards 
---
Anti-armor Fire Axe
---
40% more power attack damage
---
90% reduced weight
---
Ignores 50% of the target's armor.
---
This + incisor perk maxed (blades melee weapons ignore 75% of the targets armor) is already deadly, with mutations and the slugger perk I can get it up to 237, and that should be direct damage, ignoring all of the armor.
---
Said this long time ago. In general PvE could do with a lot of improvements:
---
1. More bosses monsters, both on the world map and interiors. Boss monsters should have unique abilities that compliment the map / terrain where they spawn to make for interesting fights.
---
2. More interesting AI across the board. E.g. molemen and super mutants aren't that different besides appearance. Every monster should behave differently, and monster variants should have significant differences and that necessitate different responses.
---
3. More scripted events / encounters / fights besides boss fights. E.g. in FO4 large numbers of ghouls spawn out of ducts / windows when you enter certain rooms.
---
This game is a shoot and loot. If the "shoot" is one dimensional the game gets boring fast. The "loot" is a whole 'nother issue that's been discussed a lot already.

That being said, rereading all of this on a computer screen, you weren't as strongly victim blaming as I originally thought. But your statement "I disagree that its was solely the dupers who ruined economy." is what I take exception to. We have a problem; a game overrun with duped items and the many trickle down impacts they have. We have two things we're trying to decide where to lay the blame on (or more clinically, trying to determine which is the source).

Remove Bethesda's  " more and easier to do than  most. " exploits, and you still have people chasing after ever more difficult methods. 
---
Remove dupers, and the problem is gone.
---
Now which would you say is the source of the problem? An easily exploited engine didn't ruin the economy, people exploiting it did. It is solely on the dupers.
---
You got it, and I completely missed it.  :)
---
It's Friday.  That's all I know for sure.
---
I have my main painted up with atom shop stuff. It shows me the atom symbol. It's the only way I know.
---
I don’t have anything that makes me invisible, not even the mutation. And I don’t use buffout. I don’t even think you were one of the people that came if you’re talking about this stuff?
---
That doesn't mean there's nothing else coming before March. You could be right but nobody has said that yet.
---
North of Watoga there's a tunnel under a road I like to farm when I need to craft radaway. Last time with green thumb I picked up 72.
---
[I saw this the other day](https://imgur.com/gallery/Yy4HEH2) 
---
I had one that was built into a pond, nowhere near a fissure site, but here I was having my whole CAMP leveled by a Scorchbeast. I think another player was being chased by one and led him to my CAMP unintentionally. Or maybe intentionally? 
---
Bear arms is basically necessary.  With that, the missile launcher and its ammo weigh very little.  However, ammo can stack up and when you're using a perk to carry it all you can't put it back in your stash as it won't fit.  It means I have to carry a ton of pounds of missiles, 40mm grenades, MIRV grenades, plasma grenades, nuke mines, mini nukes, etc. always on me at all times.  It won't fit.
---
I've managed to stockpile all of this but I can't use it.  My weapons break too fast to be able to use all the ammo I have.  I wish I could use the weapons somewhat often but doing that would mean I'm repairing them all the time.  I've found that the best use for these weapons is using them on players as explosives bypass DR so they shred most players.  I rarely use it on the occasional boss enemy but then again I could always use grenades like the MIRV grenade that will chunk a scorchbeast if it manages to land right.
---
He's just over level 50. 
---
Also, I have multiple characters, including one over 150, that add up to over level 300, your budget does not grow by a noticeable amount (if at all.) Have heard redditors saying this, but have not experienced this in game myself.
---
Don't you think that's kinda stretching it...?
---
Same...I've been searching and found two spots.  One in the mire that is an open top ring, but it has some boxes and stuff inside already and after getting stuck on the geometry twice I've decided to move.  
---
Also there is some cave systems under the road leading north out of Watoga.
---
Thanks ill check that out
---
Dude i have a tse like any one else doing 1k damage and you took a small fration and you one hit with a combat knife people know about the stupid armors and glitches
---
I don’t know how Bethesda didn’t initially sit down and brainstorm ways to actually make these ideas more appealing. A few of these ideas are good because it entices people to engage in that specific content like home raids for example and the ability to spawn a legendary perhaps. As it is, Bethesda has merely created the barebones and there’s just not a lot there to keep the fans engaged.
---
What I've found is that if I pay attention to what I'm putting down, I can really extend my camp budget.  Lights take a lot of budget.  Turrets take a LOT of budget.  I go easy on the lights and don't use turrets.
---
well he was trying to respond to complaints about lack of pve content by saying more would come in march, it would be insane to not just say when earlier content is coming, if hes trying to convince people they will have content soon
---
I never went invisible or used a chem though? I think you just need more damage. I’ve got dense and fireproof like everyone else
---
Just suppress mutation w radx before crafting, pop some mentats and maybe some brain bombs to buff int temporarily. There’s no point to running high int continuously. To in suppress the mutation just pop a diluted radx
---
I consider it a personal challenge to break into Camps without getting a bounty
---
Thats what i was thinking but stacked with armor makes you unkilable 
---
I like carrying tons of raw fertalizer and no other junk.  That way when they kill me, all they get is a big pile of crap.
---
Trolled him for a while trying to get him to go aggressive, but I was on my second alt who is just level 14, so I couldn't do much. Believe me... I &lt;3 those strikes. (Even if they are under powered)
---
You’re saying “armor” is unfair? Come on... I’m just looking to PvP
---
Strange that it does that. Other TS weapons include the second shot damage in the overall damage. 
---
Tanagra town has quite a few as you climb the tree thingy.  There's also several plans/recipes you can find there, and sometimes a pipboy game.
---
With less than a third of all players making it to level 25 two months into the game, those numbers don't indicate that most people are taking it slow. It indicates that most people quit playing.
---
Well, I only tested it by timing my running distance between 2 pts with 1 other person in the party, and saw no significant difference in my times when using speed demon, speed demon+strange in numbers, speed demon+squad manuevers, speed demon+squad manuevers+strange in numbers. This was a few weeks ago. But I wasn't sharing perk cards, I was just having a team mate.
---
And as far as I know, Strange in numbers doesn't care WHAT mutations the other players have, just that they are mutated. And 4 people sharing the same perk and getting benefit from each share doesn't sound like intended behavior, but I can't test that.
---
No it wouldn't be insane to not say anything about it if it hasn't been confirmed or they're not sure it will be ready in time. maybe there are absolutely positive it will be ready in March but will ship it sooner if it's ready sooner. maybe there's a lot of content coming in March and only a few things between now and then. there are a lot of different ways with a actually said can be interpreted without the specific interpretation you are making.
---
Again you're going off on a tangent about something they haven't actually said yet.
---
South whitesprings by the Yao Guai cave there are two. 
---
Could you show us where on the map
---
Its not unfair but asking to be killed but being unkillable isnt exactly what i call pvp 
---
For bonus points, have him announce the events that are starting up, so I don’t have to pop the map open and swirl the cursor around every five minutes to figure that out.
---
What are my thoughts?  My thoughts are that slap damage should be a flat number, not a percentage of player damage.  Seriously, attacks outside of PVP, the infamous "slap damage"...should be a flat value of like....1.   You know you got hit, its fairly obvious in the UI.  Red flash.  Sound Effect.  Visual twitch.  "Ouch, You shot me you A Hole!".....And that's it.  None of this Super OP TSE Shotgun One hit kill even though pacifist BS.  It breaks the game.
---
I put the mod on the machete. It's the only 4 star I've ever seen in game, and I've killed a lot of legendaries. I would very much like to see the 4 star weapons from the bazaar
---
I had the same thing with mine but there o my problem is if you put it in the stash the symbol goes away.
---
Windego Cave
---
Hmmm, hasn't happened to me yet (and I have one char that moves his base often.) Must be more to it than just moving the camp. Thanks for shedding some light!
---
I loved the plasma rifles in past games. They are unusable as is. All weapons need to be examined and buffed. Also the repair and scrapping is maddening for most weapons. Melee should break faster imo. Springs and screws should be salvageable from scrapped guns.
---
So like retaining walls? I love this idea and want to be a part of it.
---
I'm not exactly sure how it works it's just happened a few times to me.
---
I don’t know what weapon that is but I’d love a power fist! I’m currently rocking the mole miner gauntlet and a guitar sword (why the heck not!), taking it slow :)
---
Cool thanks a lot ill have to check it out
---
All I'm getting out of this discussion is that you only want Bethesda to focus on the things that you want (encouraging trading between players, adding more quests and end-game content). Well I want survival and I'm glad they are working on it. Hopefully they'll add the things that you want too, I wouldn't be against it.
---
Exploits and bug fixes would apply to all modes, survival and adventure. It's not like they are just going to stop fixing the game.
---
I had a 5000c bounty earlier and got killed. I’m not invincible. You’re just weak
---
Add a place-able beacon that opens fast travel up on the map for non group members to join.  would be great for when player vending arrives.
---
I just joined the game to try again but your no wehte to be found 
---
That sounds handy for a Vats reliant individual     
---
Red rocket 
---
But you’re tell Bethesda that they should know better and doesn’t need the input of fans.  They should assume to know what we want.  Sounds like an EA thing.
---
It's actually quite the opposite. The entire community benefits from bug fixing and more quests, but only a fraction of it is actually gonna care about Survival mode. If they have a broken game, they should be fixing it, not adding more broken stuff to it. Period.
---
Definitely a glitch/exploit then. I’ve seen some massive bases and the owner is usually pretty high (200+). It’s just an assumption 
---
If I paint them all they all have the symbol...
---
The problem persists
---
Like 85% of the time I exit my Chem station it puts me right back in. Really annoying! On XB1.
---
Thanks it worked.
---
Uh. My 5 pieces of weapon weight reduction gear says otherwise. Cause I don't think guns are supposed to weight .85 lbs.
---
Anti-Armor probably.
---
Probably the glitch where moving your base copies the blueprint into your stored tab multiple times.  It messes up your build budget tho. Was his power working?
---
I thoroughly enjoy breaking into other people's camps.  My favorite way involves them building their impervious camp in my favorite spot.  When I enter the game, their game assembles itself around me and I usually pop inside.     I love taking their food and raiding any unlocked resources.  Often times I'll leave behind a bag of fertilizer.  I haven't found a way to set the bag of fertilizer on fire yet.    If they are in their camp, I'll hold off on taking their stuff, but I'll make some noises or throw some emotes from places characters can't normally be uninvited.   The last one:  I loaded up inside of someone's locked fusion generator room.  So of course I start playing with the switch that is next to the generator.   They didn't come to investigate, so I start making noises into the microphone.   Eventually I start making emotes because maybe my mic wasn't working in that session (I found out later that my wireless mic wasn't "active", so they likely couldn't hear my noises.).    When I started making emotes from inside a locked room, that got their attention.   They put on their power armor and opened the door.  I can only imagine the surprise seeing a clown with a gas mask exit their room, make some emotes, and take off.   I did forget to leave a bag of fertilizer behind that time.  Oh well.  I'll get better at it.
---
Yes.
---
The quality of the update will be the deciding factor in the game's fate. Maybe the blowback they've gotten about the lack of story (yes I read notes and listen to tapes, it's still not the same) will lead to a bigger/better writing team for Elder Scrolls 6. 
---
Marked plans might actually bring me back to the game. I quit on my second character because it became too annoying to remember which character had which patterns. I kept rebuying things and since i don't generally sell max amount every day because its freaking annoying...i got tired of going broke for no reason.
---
They haven’t earned it in this title. 
---
Would be great if they could include what Fallout4 had. The ability to remove stuff from your camp location. Example trees (standing or fallen), the ability to flatten hills or slopes. Also would be great if they could increase the camp budget. And also increase over all storage in the stash box. 
---
I think so because the missile turrets on the top of his base were all on. I didn't look around too much for generators but it looks like he only had one smaller one on the roof, maybe the large or medium generator, but definitely not the nuke generator.
---
Please provide proof of your assertion. I'll wait.
---
I don't think they can add this, but a spiral staircase would be awesome too.
---
You’re saying to switch anti armor for the instagating?
---
Yup - Fallout Friday!!
---
I seriously hope all you people going on about how you are done with Bethesda will actually stick to your guns instead just being all talk.
---
Is it your original Voice Of Set? I had sold mine and decided to pick up another later bc I happened to see it at a vendor, and it wouldn't let me modify that or the Blade Of Bastet either. I had always assumed it was bc it wasn't mine, but maybe it's just not working?
---
Mostly just helping each other in general.  Faction specific uniforms. Quest help. Resources sharing. General teamwork really with faction appropriate RP (though some suspension of disbelief may be needed for nuke launching lol)
---
Yup - Fallout Friday!
---
right. neither can the blade of bastet. i can be upgrade to lvl 45 but that is it.
---
No it was one she crafted
---
Yeah that we have to pay for. 
---
I cant say how many extra shots it will take but if your playing in pvp your going to be using spec and mods for pvp (assassin's gear)
---
Nice guessing on the percentages with zero factual information to go by. 
---
Most achievement numbers are low because this broken game can't even track achievements  correctly
---
Ya, I hear ya. 
---
Handmade is ridiculously good.
---
Yup, I can confirm. I was just here. It’s northeast of the Top of the World 
---
Oh a bit of a flop if you ask me 
---
With how the game is designed its not possible to eliminate duping yet, they can only mitigate the effects it has on gameplay and patch the exploits until a permanent solution is found. The issue is the time delay between when profile data is saved and when an "unexpected" error occurs. All they are doing is fixing the methods used to force an error in the saving process, they aren't fixing the overall problem which probably can't be fixed, people will always find a way to dupe. GTA Online is a good example of this. Its been years and thousands of patches to stop duping and they still have problems with it. So in short, there will always be new ways to dupe as long as there is a delay between saving and an error that causes a rollback. The only real solution is to eliminate the rollback feature but in order to do that they need a more stable client and server, which will take a long long time to achieve. and even then there will probably be another way after that.
---
Yeah, or the ability to climb a ladder like the way you can climb on foundations at the very least lol
---
Handmade. More damage, similar handling.
---
Assault vs combat rifle is closer. Most people prefer the combat rifle for the damage but the recoil and hip-fire accuracy are terrible.
---
Jesus that’s a high bounty 
---
You can add the scorched receiver to a 3 star gun and make it 4*
---
That's pretty sweet :)
---
I think mixing up playstyles and having viable weapons and armor add to replay and roleplay. Hopefully changes are coming down the line 
---
Assault rifle for aesthetics. Handmade if you want to try hard.
---
r/fallout is that way.
---
PC Master race!
---
Sorry, couldn't resist.
---
To venture forth to "Fissure site Prime" (BGS) and destroy the "ring" (FO76 game disc) where they were forged?
---
Nope.
---
That's really weird. I wonder if it's broken then?
---
Sounds like you just play the game inefficiently. Nothing wrong with that, but just because your way of playing the game works for you, doesn't mean it's the only or "correct" way to play.
---
People bought into the hatewagon around it. It's really that simple.
---
Yeah, what's up with that smoke? Is it toxic? Because it doesn't really prevent me from killing them, since after they huff and puff they stay pretty much in the same spot and I can just unload my combat rifle on them... 
---
No im on PC, but if you do the forbidden knowledge quest you will get it. So far ive gotten one paint plan every 2 or 3 days now that im actually attempting to farm the whitespring bunker for the tech documents. I think ive found 4 or 5 including the paint i learned
---
No, I'm saying Anti-Armor would probably get you the best bang for your buck.  Instigating works well on smaller enemies, maybe even players.  But, in a longer fight like SBQ, anti-armor will work better.
---
Good on Dan for keeping an eye out for you.
---
Following.
---
Handmade because its better and its an AK.
---
I think I have one or two 7 day trials if you want them. Isn’t much but it’s better than nothing lol. 
---
that's what I am trying to get implemented
---
Ok, because for my build I would end up being mostly melee on sbq, however I’d pop shots in with my rifle 
---
Now you're just contradicting yourself. More quests are going to result in more broken stuff. 
---
Fuck it, maybe the should just focus 100% on bug fixing only. No new features, quests or game modes until the game is 100% bug free. Period.
---
loved that game
---
the 30 minute standoffs were legit
---
Microsoft and Sony wont let you do any sort of playing without a subscription 
---
You're almost certainly right about reddit posters being more highly invested than the typical player, but those numbers don't help identify what an average player is doing. They identify the amount of people who bought the game and made it to a particular checkpoint. From the 22 percent making it to level 25, it's far more likely that the average purchaser stopped playing the game a while ago. You would have to intentionally avoid doing anything that earns XP to not reach that level if you were playing a few hours a week. The only way to define playing a few hours a week as an unusually high-level of investment in a new game is to ignore data about amounts of time spent playing nearly any other major studio release.
---
Could be the game displaying rerolled loot drops that they might use as a method to 'normalize' drop rates since those are the times I usually see crazy drops like 100 fusion cells off of 1 SM or super rare item drops.
---
It was the screaming. That was the cherry on top.  
---
There is no such thing as a game on xbox one that can be played without connection to online servers. You need gold for pretty much every mainstream game created...
---
Jumping on the bandwagon is what gaming "journalist" do best
---
The proof of a YouTube video that isn’t inherently from this sub when you said it was in this sub and I asked you to prove it means that you are failing to provide proof to your claim, this rendering it false. 
---
I think it takes around 10-12 hits for Furious to come out ahead, so probably Anti-armor in almost any situation.
---
They could easily do this by making existing towns accommodate camps! 1 large "town" for each in game town. 
---
Mabey I mean its a legendary weapon so I thought you could increase the damage, give it a scope ya know.
---
&gt; They are working heavily on PVE content, the game has only been out for a few months.
---
Yes, working very hard. One of the better jokes I have come across on this sub. Atlas is getting content and fixes faster than fallout 76 and that REALLY is saying something.
---
Because this rifle aspect of my build I would be going for would be for instance entering compounds via stealth, like one shorting super mutants, scorched, etc in map locations,  and then using melee primarily on sbq, but using my rifle when it isn’t landed. So I’m not really using this with scorch beast queen in mind, but more ideally one shoting ground enemies and then doing decent damage on normal scorch beasts
---
That’s where we discuss the functional Fallout titles.
---
Depending on how the pvp servers are done that 5% maybe a lot higher than you think
---
I'm curious as to the size of the team working on fo76... every patch seems to bring a lot of fixes but, then again, a lot of the issues being patched have been around since fo4 and were fixed by community patches and mods, so there has been a reference point available for a lot of these... 
---
Seems to me that a huge problem at this point is that many people have already played the life out of the existing end game content. Focusing on fixing issues is great... but we are rapidly approaching (read: already arrived at...) the point where even the fairly casual player is going to feel like they have seen/done all that the game has to offer. 
---
If the dev team is large enough, or if there are resources that could be allocated to the project to do some parallel development of bug fixes and new content I think it would be very beneficial to retention of the existing playerbase and salvaging the reputation of 76 as a whole. 
---
TLDR - More endgame content needs to be prioritized at least as a parallel development goal. Fo76 has had a less than stellar reputation so far and the last thing that is needed is for those who are enjoying it to get bored, leave the game, and complain about "no end game". 
---
Guess im not so weak after all
---
It's a multiplayer get that requires an online connection, if you want to play online you need Xbox gold or PS+ there are a few online games which are exceptions but those are few and far inbetween as far as I know
---
See?? Well about to get bounty up again. 
---
Idgaf
---
Since Xbox Live was released...this is a thing.
---
Gtfo stop shaming people for playing a game. You sound like a fool.
---
it absolutely is
---
Yeah in good i only brjng out the anti armor bloodied claw on rare occasions 
---
i did it for the vid ;)
---
If people enjoy it let them play don’t ruin their fun because you personally hate it
---
So, I should stop playing a game I enjoy to justify your sense of moral outrage? Get off your high horse.
---
Damage could use a buff but it's really not that bad. 
---
glad you like 
---
I'm having fun and enjoying it. 🤷‍♂️
---
i know how insane would that be
---
That's the weird thing, though, you CAN. When I had my original, I could.
---
Did you craft a new Voice Of Set? I know at the weapons workbench, you can basically rebuild it to level 35 and 45, I did that with mine.
---
Bet you can’t do it again
---
I only won cause i got thw drop on ya its hard to do that naturally 
---
grenadier helps to achieve this easier. I don't know the radius of explosives (maybe it's even different for different types, like mines, grenades, missiles etc), but fact is, whatever the radius of the blast is, level 2 grendier will double it.
---
now, some enemies are not so easy. Scorchedbeast (Queen especially), if they're inflight, the hit registration zones are either so apart or downright hit resistant and really difficult to get a good hard hit. Only after they land, they become really vulnerable with their legs tightly together. It's best to hit the ground beneath them. Currently, for normal setup, explosive shotgun (any) with grenadier will oneshot normal SB, if you shoot the ground beneath her while she's landed.
---
Ahahahhahah people downvoting without commenting.
---
Like, they can't even attempt at defending this bullshit but they won't stop sucking Todd's not even for a moment.
---
Such a circlejerk of religious zealot fanboys Bethesda has got, they could draw a 76 with a stick on shit and try to sell it for 500$ and they would buy it and downvote anyone speaking common sense.
---
Yea it's a bug when loading each person's individual loot in the body and then dividing up amongst all the tagged players. This has happened early game in white Springs where something happened to the sever itself and everyone that was there, who also almost all had mics, all had the infinite load for all the dead gouls except for lucky little me who got everyone's loot in one dead goul. I collected about 30 pieces of gear and weapons from that one body while everyone else got nothing and then right after the game crashed for everyone.
---
After level 50 you can choose to move one point or get a perk card.
---
Someone recently experimented and tested out that there is a flaw in the Targeting HUD mod and berry mentats as it uses the same “spell” it basically gives it to every player and enemy in a radius around you. Let me see if I can find the post. 
---
My dick burns a little when I pee, that's new. Think I'm drinking too much citrus. 
---
This has been a thing since 2002 when xbox live was launched, with all online gaming related games tied in with gold.
---
If I'm honest... you don't even need all of that.  I went for a pure rifle build, and can one shot just about everything with a non legendary lever rifle.  Level 68 super mutants take 2 shots, high health on them.
---
So a nice hunting rifle, fully modded, with the instigating legendary effect will be more than enough to one shot just about everything short of scorch beasts.
---
It should have a cool down timer full stop.
---
I honestly don't understand the level of hate 76 has gotten. This is worse than No Man's Sky and Mass Effect: Andromeda combined. Don't get me wrong; it's not a great game. But it's not the second coming of Hitler either. 
---
There hasn't been an update since the last update, so no.  Unless you want to count the announcement of things they plan to do "soon."
---
Do these numbers account for alts and mules?
---
If you believe that your opinion about a video game should matter to me, or anyone for that matter, you’re the problem. 
---
Around the overseer camp (close to the vault) near the bridge lots around the river area
---
Sounds like he has an issue with the miniscule  size of his penis, bless his little cotton socks :-)
---
There are 7 separate vending factions. Responders, Raiders, Whitespring Resort, Enclave, Brotherhood of Steel, Free States, and Watoga/Grahm. All vendors tied to an individual faction will share loot pools. 
---
So Flatwoods Responder vendor is linked to Charleston, you sell 200c worth of goods to flatwoods making Charleston &amp; all other responder vendors have 0. 
---
Bufftats instead of buff out would give you +3
---
Ok, so then with that in mind, should I go instagating with more aim down site damage then so I can boost my stealth damage? Because I definitely like the idea of one shoting literally anything that doesn’t have wings. What attachments do you use? Because I haven’t found any hardened hunting rifle 50 cal receivers which I imagine is the highest damage reciever? 
---
One of the problems of many I suspect. 
---
This is all account achievement data
---
Not everything is about you buddy/s
---
After level 50 you can either move 1 point from a stat or choose a perk.
---
Just wait until you find a gun with explosive and just one shot everything in the game, including wendigos. 
---
These best games lists are usually pretty okay, but sometimes very simply judged.
---
Worst game of a year itself is nothing but a joke. Those lists can't be taken seriously.
---
To kill people.
---
Hey rooster, just catching up on this thread. Is there a way to see the % drop rate in the files? (I'm on ps4) Had to get yellow through a trade and wanted to see if yellow and red had the same drop rate? Any info would be great!
---
The game could probably do without pvp all together. But it is nice that we can dole out some wasteland justice when someone’s trolling (I’m looking at you golf club turret bases). All in all I like the way pvp works now and I’m glad they’re giving the blood thirsty players a place to go be raiders away from the rest of us who want to co op. Maybe I’m a potato but I don’t see the difference between hit registration on other open world games like pubg and 76. Were not dealing with a map the size of my yard after all. 
---
What system are you playing on that you’re having these issues?
---
...And I am sure, people who think that game need LFG, those people are f#cking idiots too. Just for wanting devs to waste time on a f#cking broken/useless thing alone, those people are idi#ts. Anyone who played WoW on vanilla and now, knows how big negative impact LFR/LFG had for games social side.  
---
Bgawk!! There are also chickens around the lumber mill near Vault 76.
---
Was having this problem, and this worked for me.
---
Yeah, it's a plasma weapon
---
A Survival mode is something big, and it needs lots of tweaking. Look at how much time it'll take just to make things balanced. Some contents should be prioritized if we're only getting two patches a month or so. First comes bug fixing, then adding community-wide requested features, then other stuff. Of course they can add some new things here and there, but not at this pace of 1 patch every two weeks, not in the condition this game is right now and not something as big as a whole new game mode. Bethesda is just trying to make people come/come back to Fallout 76 by adding new modes, and that's understandable, but what good is adding a PVP focused game mode if OP legendaries and duping methods and endless bobbleheads still exist? If those fixes don't come out before Survival Mode is ready to be in the game, there will be trouble, especially now that players will be losing items other than junk.
---
Honestly i believe every explosive is operating under the belief they are using incendiary explosives. Big, flashy, a lot of fire and force, but no armour pen. We should have two types of explosives rounds for the auto grenade, grenade rifle, and missle launcher. 
---
Incendiary: great for AoE, no armour pen, decent damage, huge AoE.
---
Anti armour: good for single big enemies, 85% armour pen, high damage, little to no AoE. So you need to hit them to do damage. 
---
With its slow firing speed this would make it very balanced cuz youd need skill to get a hit or alternatively switch to AoE rounds and do meh damage but compensate with no need to aim.
---
For mini nukes. They should remain as they are but for every damage they do they should do equal ammount of damage as radiation. Thereby doubling their damage but still allowing players a way to prevent it.
---
As for flamers (another weapon thats not getting any love) the should have a passive effect that for every 1 second of continuously hitting an enemy you remove 5 armour and energy resist. 
---
This stacks indefinitely but the rate of -5 per second so if there's two flamers hitting it the armour wont go down by 10 but 5 a second but the fall off timer will be affected by both. Seeing as the range is mininal you'll have to stay in melee range increasing your risk but the reward is great and it allows other players to hit harder, promoting team play.
---
Thisll probably get lost in all the comments but literally looking at how these wepons are used in real life is an easy way to see how they can be made useful.
---
Nice one near the vault I did a post on not too long ago
---
Their big patch for the end of the month is something very minor that was fixed with a mod weeks ago. Really hard to be appreciative of something like that lol.
---
Dude I wish, the only problem is that the devs don't set the priority, the marketing team does. A "whole new game mode" sound a lot more flashy to new players, and that's where the money is. 
---
I am primarily PA free. I really hate power armor. That said, I have a set for high jumps and occasional rad zones. For the most part, I use a hazmat suit though. I sneak a lot so I don't pull a lot of agro at once. I know I need to back off when my nerd rage procs (at 20% health).  
---
I use goulish, radicool and sun kissed. The only time I every really need rad away is nuke zones and if I see a bounty or a big group of monsters.  
---
What kind of build are you going with.
---
Damn I need that jumpsuit
---
1) Xbox One 
---
2) Fated Stories 
---
4) whenever I spawn into the game I can’t move my character or bring up my pip boy. This happens every so often. The only thing I can do it bring up the map and use the hot keys. I try to log out and restart the game but that rarely fix the issue. I have to reboot my Xbox to solve the issue. I’ve tried waiting 30 seconds to a minute and the problem still occurs. Please fix this. I’m trying to enjoy the game as much as I can but this is really pushing me over the edge 😓 thanks ! 
---
I have an anti-armor lever rifle with a prime receiver that I use specifically for plinking at Scorchbeasts. I wouldn't bother if I didn't have cobalt flux to burn. 
---
Very nice my camp is also on a cliff but not nearly as nice as yours. Great work! :D 
---
Oh wah, boo hoo. Don't play it if you don't want to, but don't fucking tell me that I shouldn't be playing and that I should feel any shame whatsoever for enjoying a game, even if it's a flawed game. You're just like a Jesus-pusher, going around telling everyone we're going to hell unless we believe your fairy tales.
---
Pound sand. Go play Sims or something.
---
I had this mod. It was amazing.
---
Nekkid chikuns! And they're fast!! You can get a thigh or two off 'em, though....
---
They're basically the same. Pre-plucked too!
---
What do you mean by that? 
---
Its so much easier to hypothetically flip a switch, then creating new content that people will bulldoze through in a week and then complain there is nothing to do.
---
That's pretty cool! 
---
When I originally played on my Xbox 360 it was never connected to the internet because I only played single-player games, so I had no idea that was even a thing until just now. 
---
You are spending 20 minutes to kill people with nuke, with high chances to miss the target, instead of killing people with gun in few seconds...Man, You would make one sh#tty hitman.
---
The achievements for pvp show percentage if players who get them. 
---
It was one of the worst AAA games of 2018.
---
There are no hardened .50 cal receivers... I believe it's either hardened for the 308 or a .50cal receiver.  Hardened being higher damage output.  
---
ADS... is nice, but does nothing in VATs if you use VATs at all.  But, there is a +50% bonus vats crits legendary mod that can definitely stack up some damage.
---
That's my next tactic I think.. I used melee a lot at the start of the game to be honest but when I started to find guns that's when I started to consume ammo alot more! 
---
I agree with this sentiment, although you technically **CAN** spec into both...you just can't have them both equipped at the same time. I run straight DPS and grab whatever I need, then when I start getting over encumbered and booze is not flowing aplenty (or drugs, your choice if you like buffout man) I start to throw on the weight reduction skills. When I feel I've looted enough I fast travel my happy self back home and get to breaking everything down. 
---
So incessantly screeching to the devs for buffs is "playing the game efficiently" now? LoL
---
My question is whether it's 25% of accounts or 25% of characters. You can obviously have one account with multiple characters at varying stages of the game. I have one character that has completed way more than my others. So while only 33% of my characters have launched a nuke, 100% of my account has.
---
I didn't kill them. Didnt want the riverwood guards to go after me.
---
Send me an invite.  GT is denstreifen
---
IKR! I only found out there were cats when I got a recipe for one, don’t think I’ve seen one yet! 
---
The fact that people still compare this to a PS2 game graphics wise is beyond me. Are you running it on a literal potato and some lemon juice?
---
My friend is gifting me a physical copy of Fallout 4 so I think I will just stick with that until Fo76 releases new content.
---
I appreciate the offer though!
---
Thanks for the heads up!
---
This is totally going to be my next project! 
---
Cheers. As on I'm on PS4 looks like I'll have to strip them off for now. Hope Bethesda sort out this bug soon as it's affecting a lot of people it seems.
---
should I actually look the datamining stuff up, I am really afraid to see stuff too much. I'm taken' a break from the game for right now but that's because this just derails the shit out of me
---
At least this company talks to its consumers. They can release a shit game all year but tjey at least told us and gave us info. 
---
Thank you! It took a while to get everything to work right together. I'm really happy with how it turned out though.
---
Happens to me a lot and I figured out just don't touch you buttons for a couple seconds 
---
Good thing I have a PC that can be upgraded. 
---
Right. I see fo76 as The Division, in a way. Lots of potential later down the line, but flawed at release.
---
You don't if it's one of the Vault Tec blue awnings. Of course then you don't have any walls, so it's not exactly a win.
---
Do you recall the mass amount of problems and bugs? That drove lots of folks away.
---
I do what I want. 
---
Mine sits at a cosy 17-18 lol, I’m melee but still manage to one shot most enemies with the mighty power fist
---
I don’t really use vats 😅, I think doing some comparing from my own unlocked mods, that the hardened 308 did more damage then the base 50 cal reciever did, I can research it and figure it out if there’s a hardened 50 cal reciever mod, because that would be an end all be all for damage output in terms of buffing rifle damage 
---
yup, they give chicken thighs but apparently you gotta eat them raw cause i haven't found any recipes
---
Bethesda, I would like to just say, this is your game. Some people aren't going to like what is done, hell, nobody may like it, but it's your company's choice to make the game hiw it's meant. Only you guys can do that. Don't just hand over the reigns and let these spoiled,  self entitled people dictate to you how your game should be. There are people whom love and play this game, other than just the ones sampled from this website.
---
Please consider carefully, these folks are already demanding whatever they want, with or without any rationality. Everyone has their own idea of how this game would be "perfect" for them, and its very different from person to person, trying to appease the majority here or elsewhere, is the wrong move. Customers are fickle, they will come and go, but what remains is your vision, how it was portrayed in your liking, or bastardised by the ignorant requests of the masses.
---
I rather like the problem of instakilling oneself. It keeps things interesting :D But usually I use a knife when mobs come too close. 
---
Good idea about the landed scorchbeast. If they are flying, we could simply aim at the neck? That should give 1 hit to the torso and 1 hit (double damage) to the head at least. 
---
That is officially the pettiest complaint I have heard in this sub, ever. Congratulations.
---
Like New Vegas on release?
---
How about permanent C.A.M.P. upgrades that can craft to give your STASH weight reduction perks.
---
Add me PSN Grendalzzz I'll be on later :)
---
Hell, give us a foundation that is 1/4 the size of the regular foundations. If we only need it to deploy a set of stairs, why should we waste the room?
---
Mine either, people just talking out their butts.
---
\[citation needed\]
---
Happy to help.
---
The Quiet Man was made by Square Enix. 
---
Sooo my brand new furious fatman is probably junk then?
---
Since learning all the mods thats what I do too. Easy money 
---
Way to try to ruin the game for everyone Captain Buzzkill, some people like exploring, building, punchjng robots etc. go play fortnite.
---
Bethesda knows what they want to do. Don't be so self entitled and demanding, its like they are trying to please spoiled children sometimes.
---
Wow. Never knew this. Thanks so much for the tips everyone!
---
Yep. By far the best
---
it seems like your here to troll so ill leave you with this not everyone has the same opinion as you if anything go to r/fallout it will get you free karma
---
Go on...
---
Data mining just looks at the raw data in the game files. From what I’ve seen there’s a ton of stuff not implemented that dataminers have found. I find your post interesting because this stuff actually exists in the world. I don’t think data mining is going to tell you much, just what and what does not exist in the game files. 
---
Im going to explore this a bit myself now as much as I doubt I’ll find anything. If I end up president I’ll post back 😉
---
Thank you. I figured there were gonna still be some old ones and new ones considering after the game launched after each new update there were new problems. But it's time for me to get back into the game cuz I miss it LOL
---
Xbox and ps4 achievements. 
---
With what's available, there's not going to be anything like a proof for anything on either side here. Maybe Fallout 76 follows entirely different purchasing patterns and play patterns than every other game in its different categories. In that case, who knows! But, based on what we can see, it seems far more reasonable to assume that most people who bought the game have stopped playing than that more than 75 percent of purchasers remain active in the game but have taken it so slow over the last 10 weeks that they haven't hit level 25 on any character.
---
For a lot of reasons, it's reasonable to assume most sales happened during the first week. Nobody has any data one way or another, so we would need to agree or disagree on that and leave it there. The average time someone spends on games is 6 hours a week, and that includes everyone who plays any game. Everyone who plays any game is not the typical person playing an online multiplayer game, but I'll sit with the likely low average of 6 hours, but assume they would spend all of that low amount of time with the new and relatively expensive game they bought. FO76 has been out for ten weeks. So, with a low average overall game playing time but an assumption about how that time is spent, I think it's reasonable to say a very conservative estimate of time with the game for someone that has continued to actively play it would be 60 hours.
---
I don't have numbers of time per level currently, but I hit level 25 in 12 hours. That was playing an hour most days over the first two weeks.
---
Missiles are a waste of space but I like nukes, they're good for dealing with crowds.
---
In practice though the 40mm grenades are a better use of inventory.
---
Higher level doesnt give more budget.
---
A stored turret always takes 12% budget
---
For a planned roadmap, they would need allocated engineers for the next years working on the game.
---
As the game has no subscription, and nobody's buying it, who's gonna pay for it?
---
DLC maybe, but if you had a few millions to invest, would you invest it in some FO76 DLC?
---
Some random legendary instigating power fist that I picked up.  Great for punching things right in the face really really hard.  ;)
---
Did you have super duper perk active while you were crafting the excavator set? 
---
Idk, can I have it
---
In survival its still gonna be op. 
---
I only found chicken noodle soup, so I got that
---
Nah, I like hunter/hunter, pvp, and prefer to be with people other than friends for it.
---
I just tried again with mine. At the screen of loading any holotape into any pc 90% of my holotapes are alphabetized. All the ones starting with W are randoms for some reason and the overseer quest ones(the quest that nobody can finish) are at the bottom. Still a pretty good start to have that many alphabetized.
---
With 5 pieces of Unyielding armor you could have an extra 15 while at low health.
---
There are ^fuggin 
---
#CATS?
---
About to try a legendary fatman I got, wondering if I should use VATS at the risk of the nuke flying over and past the target. I have like 10 ammo for it, maybe i’ll go to watoga and shoot it down at robots from high up. I wonder how far back I need to stand from my target too, it might blow me up down on the ground. Killed myself many times in other fallout games using fatman.
---
Hell yeah
---
Group of people hiding outside vault 76 to avoid a nuke launch... drop a mini nuke!
---
Okay. I saw that post too, but only about 5% of people have completed Scorched Earth.
---
I did, I just screamed and ran away
---
Warning: ghouls are bros with wendigos. 
---
Survival mode is going to be a hilarious dud. Especially if you have to make new characters.
---
Griefers will stay put and grief because the pvp systems are so exploitable and survival will be a gimmick.
---
Even if they don't force new characters survival will be a gimmick. 
---
I prefer the handmade since it was my favorite rifle in fallout 4 and i love the look and sound of it. I love aks and im glad they have it ingame
---
Nice! I did something similar just south closer to those two tall buildings. I've posted my treehouse before so everyone can see how useful the monorail supports are.
---
I like where your head is at.
---
I know aha! Lost my mind when I saw a possum, I mean I’ve never seen one in real life but they’re cool as hell in 76 
---
All mine does on Xbox now is say, “Server not responding, controls temporarily disabled.” All afternoon. I can’t even load into the world anymore. 
---
Okay nice! 
---
there’s a dog too if you didn’t know
---
Got me beat, I sit at 30 with just armor and specials. Chems and weapons and another 4.
---
Same here. I don't understand how if people are really reading every note and every terminal to get the game's backstory that they are level 160 already. I read everything and explore everything and I'm not even level 50 yet.
---
That or people have a lot more free time than I do.
---
I like to avoid fast travel completely.  I take a big loop around the whole map harvesting and cooking as much meat with butchers bounty and thru hiker as I can and selling it as I go.  
---
I’ll switch in super duper when I cook - but I keep the other non-coms and good with salt rank 2 on pretty much constantly.
---
"Whoever is leading that design team needs to be demoted and forced to play some fallout before they come back to work."  
---
Aaaaand you can fuck right off, your credibility just went out the window. 
---
When I post this, people tend to get on here and downvote and just call me a liar. But not I, I feel your pains as well.
---
Spend 10 minutes in lucky hole and realize how much time you've been wasting. I was shocked when I did my first run. 
---
That’s for the insider information. 
---
Can you have more than one in your stash?  I had three and all but one disappeared.
---
Never heard of it.
---
Did it come out on console?
---
The irony with that statement is that NV only had so many issues because Bethesda forced a short deadline and demanded they do the QA process instead of letting the professionals do it. 
---
Here is how Trade system works, I have around 6 or so that I play with normally and we are like a Co-Op, sharing our resources and trading with each other. Very rare when it comes to randoms.
---
In your video, when you highlight your 5mm ammo... How is the weight zero? Is this a perk or is the weight so small, like 0.001, that it just shows zero?
---
Type fallout 76 build into your app store, pick the 1 you want
---
Er...
---
Again, these are account based achievements. If you have reached level 25 on any character on your account, you have the achievement. If you have not, you don't. More characters isn't more accounts.
---
You're better off just drinking them for the bottle cap rather than selling them to vendors who can easily have their meager 200 cap limit sucked dry from all the other shit you'd probably have to offload on them.
---
Definitely agree when my tse handmade can match a ts fat man
---
Pop a rad-x for crafting, will temporarily suppress the mutation without removing it.
---
Came out on PS4 and PC. I can't even argue that it looks indie, it feels worse than indie games. 
---
You missed the point entirely -- you're complaining that players don't know what they want. Therefore, by extension, your own fucking complaint doesn't know what it wants, and is worthless.   
---
Maybe the professional game developers know a bit more about how to do this than some furry cuck on reddit.
---
That happens because it dropped a drill/ chainsaw/flare gun or some other weapon that isn't programmed to have legendary variants. Like how the hunting rifle didn't have them before.
---
They’ll give you that! 
---
*For money.* 
---
Just, yes. Ffs. Yes. 
---
And this is why you don't work in games.
---
Got a double shot rocket launcher with a quad barrel, still better off melee against SBQ
---
Your name certainly holds up... 
---
How am I being self entitled? How am I being demanding? By suggesting that fixing issues that the game never should have been released with in the first place shouldn't put development of additional game content on complete hold?
---
Compare 76 to any online game launch, with the exception of ESO and look at what is really there... 
---
It launched as unpolished and incomplete as some of the early access titles on Steam, and the end game content is farm an area you would encounter around level 20-30 in normal game play, launch a nuke and farm this exact same area, or launch a nuke and kill the one and only boss in the game... 
---
Honestly, they haven't even fixed nearly close to all of the bugs from release yet. There was a huge uproar yesterdsy when they announced that people could transfer established characters to the survival mode servers, which takes an astounding lack of forethought, and even that they will probably have to redo. I think their to-do list is *way* too long to consider adding end-game content any time soon, or even have working mechanics for end-game content any time soon.
---
No come back in a week.
---
Human head studios is not a AAA dev....
---
Good bye vats pistol builds then
---
What were you, level 12?
---
So? 
---
That doesn't make my post incorrect. 
---
Approximately 5% of f76 players actively have taken part in pvp. 
---
I ask that Bethesda, while working on PvP servers for that 5% don't forget about the other 95% likely to stay focused on PvE. 
---
I am usually sitting right around 37 at the moment for strength. I have not used any chems or booze to boost my strength yet. I think I saw 42 once or twice. I can one punch a level 91 Death Claw.
---
No, nothing has changed since the last time you posted here 5 minutes ago. 
---
Wasn't end game griefing players? 
---
You're playing the game wrong. The *real* endgame is carry weight optimization. 
---
Translation: “I’m bad at making decisions and managing my inventory.”
---
This is sound advice. I concur.
---
Let me rephrase a comment I made earlier...
---
#DOGS?
---
I saw one in real life... seconds before my brother ran it over with is car going 55mph. Felt it too. I still feel sad about it lol
---
Think I just accepted you on PSN! 
---
Your right! A fool and they're money soon part ways. Shoulda brought the re2 remake at least thats worth your money. 76 is a rip off. People are defending a rip off game. Welcome to 2019.
---
Imo they should have completely leave out PvP from this game build. And introduce PvP with the upcoming Survival.
---
I don't know how it can be done so that open-world PvP would satisfy all players with different playstyle.
---
fo4 is a classic, have fun!
---
I’m new to this game but I did enjoy your conspiracies. 
---
OK, thanks. I was unclear that these are cataloged as one time account achievements, not player specific achievements.
---
On Play Store i found only some interactive maps. Can you tell me one that have the features i said before?
---
Chicken was fcuking?
---
&gt; The weight reduction makes a much larger difference due to the higher weight.
---
90% is 90%. It lets you carry 10x more feathers or 10x more rocks there is no difference.
---
Shhh its beta and not too well thought out.
---
Totally, sorry if I sounded frustrated I just sometimes have trouble communicating my ideas properly and wasn't sure how to properly reword/explain to get it across more clearly. ^^
---
Yasssss! Please! It’s a pain to shuffle between my 6PAs to figure out which is which! 
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1111111&amp;d=&amp;w=&amp;n=
---
You've ignored known issues that have plagued us since Beta. Why should we believe you're going to start paying attention to them now? I can't even file bug reports because your terrible support says I'm not doing it right, then copy pastes the same incorrect instructions. Your support is laughably bad.
---
It's as bad as people are portraying it. Telling people to shut up because you don't like their opinion is communism. And the only good commie is a dead commie.
---
Well I'll See ya guys in a week 
---
your use of "you people" here makes me think you don't own (or at least don't play) the game. if you did, you would realize that this is a much-needed QoL feature
---
using a vats hud? 
---
It's that Ray tracing. Fo76 has too many Raymonds.
---
How has this user not been banned here? 
---
Their post history is toxic AF. 
---
Ingame there's a challenge for 7600 hours played.
---
There isn't anything external.
---
Next patch, already been announced
---
Im simply curious on your opinion 
---
Would u prefer the mode to NOT drop aid? Or have the dropping of aid too?  
---
I feel like the "Respawn at camp or vault76+loose junk you farmed and caps" should be already a hard punishment.
---
I would love to play it without loosing aid first, so we can see how hard it is to gather up junk/anything with constant threat of pvp....
---
I like that idea!! Any locations i could farm up some low level legendaries?? Leader of the pack in the forest area?
---
gl dude, I am stumped. different voting terminals may also say different departments for completely different reasons. I just know it would for sure have something to do with terminals, and\\or the voting places. I've thought you might have to become mayor first but that seemed ridiculous. 
---
The mayor of grafton actually won by 1 unanimous vote so maybe it's actually easy to rig the election. I don't know, I guess time will tell. GL to anybody who goes for it, I am honestly going to take a break from concentrating on it.
---
This is different. You can’t dupe a chassis. 
---
You could spend hours whining on Reddit
---
Personally  
---
I think this  
---
Is a great  
---
...
---
I have a few friends who were interested in coming back to a character reset in the form of a new mode.  
---
I was hoping survival was going to be slightly more punishing by also increasing enemy difficulty and the PVP interaction would fine with us, we'd enjoy it. We're big fans of POE and D3 so character resets are really common for us. 
---
I think you should at least add a 'survival only' option to make it so those of us who want to only deal with survival only characters have the option without stopping others join the fun of the mode to test it.  
---
One mechanic I think should be added for Survival is that when you die to NPC mobs, they should loot your junk from your paper bag and you should have to slay them to get your junk back.  
---
Also the survival servers should probably join players based on level, maybe 5-10 level difference maximum and have the server scale automatically as the players level, so all new players only get placed with similar level survival players (uptil 50 where the servers just become 50+) - I can't imagine the experience being good unless the server does its best to keep drastically different level players somewhat apart.
---
Thank you, it's what i was looking for. Sad i can't see such things externally. There's a way to see these stats in game or even challenges and/or their state of completition in game? (Sorry i'm new to the game)
---
I think this is a known dupe. I don’t remember the circumstances that caused it though. It duplicates an entire suit. 
---
War.... War never changes...
---
Damn... That suckkks.
---
Too bad there wasnt a legendary retrieval system like destinys post office ey?
---
Not what i was asking for, but it's pretty useful. Thank you!
---
Commenting hoping that the devs notice this. My mother's boyfriend, who is nearly 80, just got his Xbox One and it came bundled with fo76. The game needs increased UI options. Particularly for text sizes for button displays and onscreen notifications. It would be beneficial for some to have have customizable ui all together. 
---
I'm half his age and can't read half of this stuff on his TV. It's a 4k qled so I can assure its not the problem. 
---
I'm level 139. But I've played every Fallout game. I like to go through with a fine tooth comb. The stories of some people are heartbreaking to read and listen to. They did a great job with the voice actors. Some of the small quests are brilliant. There is also those treasure maps. I've still to find even 1 treasure, but I've collected nearly all of them. The quests that repeat can be a little tedious, but even without them, I have loads of Miscellaneous tasks still to do, and I'm betting if I dig deeper there's way more.
---
Absolutely agree. There are a lot of good suggestions on how to make it work but at the end of the day it's a silly mechanic that is forcing you to play differently for something very basic and a given in other multiplayer RPGs. Some sort of party range limit would be perfectly reasonable.
---
Well, it already basically functions, the change will improve my quality of life and I am not certain 76 qualifies as being massively multiplayer. Largish multiplayer? But your question is just so provocative. Dare I dream of a world where tight, coherent features are not spectacular but instead considered mundane? Dare I?
---
Shotguns and melee weapons weirdly did this already.
---
Shotguns get reload speed And weight reduction, melee gets swing speed And weight reduction.
---
I agree completely that pure weight reduction perks are simply not fun. I'd add to this good with salt, and the reduced durability loss perks. They just mitigate annoying mechanics, they do not really add anything fun to the game. 
---
Looks hardware related. GPU or PSU in my experience.
---
Try and troubleshoot those two things, if all good, rollback your display drivers and report in.
---
Fix bugs asap? Hahahahah. Release game asap? Easy.
---
I don't like the slap-to-duel PvP mechanic, or engaging in PvP in a situation where my location is immediately apparent to anyone who may be hunting me back, so I have not engaged in PvP because I do not like how the PvP mechanics are implemented.
---
Also, have you noticed that some creepers stalk and snipe at other players for the satisfaction of getting a "kill" in their head canon? Or did you believe that the occasional damage indicator you take from an unknown source was a bug?
---
It is the same reason why I don't claim workshops... PvP needs work. There is already a shitload of PvE content still available for all of the people who didn't rush to the "endgame".
---
There are foxes as well
---
E-sports ready game /s 
---
What do you mean by player stats then? I figured you wanted a build planner.
---
Thanks for sharing I think I'll make one now. Sounds cool.
---
The assault rifle already has a place in the game -- everything from level 20-40 or so.  I didn't see a handmade for the first time until I was level 35; I've seen a grand total of one handmade that was not legendary (fortunately my very first legendary handmade was a decent one as far as non-explosives go, with furious + limb damage).  
---
Meanwhile by the time I got that first handmade, I'd already completed learning all the Assault rifle mods, and had several legendary assault rifles.   
---
I guess one could make an argument that you could do a better job of distinguishing them with their mods: give them different sets of mods, to give them different purposes? But that doesn't even really make a ton of sense either, because it seems pretty obvious that the Handmade is the upgrade to the Assault Rifle, in exactly the same way that a 10mm Pistol is an upgrade to a Pipe Pistol. 
---
Make another near it...
---
Sh:t post...
---
If you build your camp on a hill or place your items on oddly shaped terrain, the server will be unable to transfer that to an area that has flat terrain.  Easiest thing to do is use the cement blocks for floors and limit the amount of stuff you place outside of your house.
---
I  agree with the nuke thing, would be amazing to get the warning but not know where it was going to hit.
---
I also agree on the starting again stuff - either that or servers only allow you to join with other members within say 20 leavels up or down then ytourself
---
My end game is springhunting, it is boring.
---
It is but I don't get to pick which I find with Pharma Farmer so I end up with a mix of both.
---
That would be great. Unfortunately I'm on PS4.
---
This is definitely where a chat window/combat and loot log would've been handy. Not only is it for accessibility, but it is honestly for quality of life. 
---
Not knowing what I just received from a quest/event at one glance is a huge headache in terms of inventory management. Especially so when the animated text gets cut off or you're in the middle of another fight and can't sit there and look at it for the brief amount of time it's on the screen.
---
I would remove Pain Train and I would exchange Pack Rat for another Traveling Pharmacy. There are so many crafting stations around the world so if you keep breaking down junk into components and you pick up more weight efficient junk then you shouldn’t have issues.
---
Cannibal is great to have but it gives you a lot of rads so you need a way to mitigate this. Pairing it with rank 3 Lead Belly is a typical combo.
---
I would only put 3 points into charisma because it’s enough to share a perk card. You can use the extra 2 elsewhere.
---
Melee weapons are very efficient to repair, especially when you have a rank three Weapon Artisan. Therefore, I would remove Luck of the Draw.
---
An overall suggestion, if you’re good with VATS, is to invest more into critical perks in Luck. I personally use a one handed no power armor build which I feel like is more advantageous because you can get more out of it from legendary effects. 
---
Awesome. Hadn’t heard about that yet, thanks!
---
Nope limit is 90
---
Someone with this person's post history using the word 'moronic' is deeply amusing.
---
Yes the first one was level 15 this is silly I hope Bethesda fixes this
---
i dont think this is going to change anything. people will just get the overpowered weapons in the new mode and grief the new players anyway. it won't take that long. 
---
this is a legit post. That would make nukes super fun. Also they should add cool down to log out so people can't start a fight and just log out to avoid losing stuff. Lone your character stays logged in for 1 min if you are being attached but another player. sounds frustrating but it adds a whole new dimension to PvP. In Conan exiles you stayed present in the world even after logging out. your character would look like they were asleep. So before logging out you would want to park them somewhere safe. I'm not suggesting that but just a cool down to make people think twice about starting some shit they can't finish. or when you finally track down someone who killed you days ago... you can settle the score without them logging out to fight another day with their friends.
---
No problem. I am a PC player and I don't think I can track those things. (like hours played etc.) I also have not owned a console in a decade, so I am a bit out of the loop as far as those things go.
---
I don't presume to speak for everyone, but I feel like most of us acknowledge the game isn't perfect, or complete, however we still enjoy playing it.
---
Bug bugs dead, moo moos safe, Torr thank you.
---
I think aid is missing the mark as ppl won't kill you for your aid items.
---
They kill you to make you weaker so they can constantly kill you till you can't actually fight back.
---
Death should have very little punishment but killing should have a reward.
---
That way ppl will engage in pvp more knowing win or lose its enjoyable.
---
I think FO3 did have a Nuka Cola Factory that had research and marketing papers stating that they did use radioactive materials in Nuka Quantum. I think a lot of the lore might be implied just based on what had been established in the previous games, but I could be wrong.
---
 There is 3 Strength on Enclave under armor. 
---
It was probably bash dmg and faster movement speed anyways
---
"Rush to the endgame". 
---
Ummm, I took my time, and am there. 
---
I didn't even have the game at launch. 
---
So no, I didn't rush. I hit the end game at a relatively reasonable pace. Only started farming the Queen two weeks ago. 
---
But after two weeks of just fighting the queen and whitespring ghouls, it does start to feel lacking. 
---
Which is why more end game content would be great.
---
Every mmo I have ever played has had more end game content on launch, than F76. 
---
Fingers crossed they rise to our expectations. 
---
Do you get to pick what meds you find randomly in containers? I certainly don't and I'm not going to waste all of those antibiotics to cure the basic things. Regardless, they both suffer from the RadAway issue of not being affected by weight reduction and in a game with so much focused on weight reduction it needs to be fixed.
---
Ahh I get you now! Makes more sense when you think about it. Thanks man! 
---
This system is such a failure. 
---
Me and three friends could never seem to get these to pop when in que.. so we all joined at once and we were immediately all flagged to kill each other while we were all standing on top of each other..
---
The guy who shoots first wins because he one shot the other guy.
---
Two deaths are registered out of the four-man group and the Hunter/Hunted session is over.
---
So. Much. Fun.
---
You can see your post is probably more fitting for the word 'petty' op has put more effort into his post than your petty attempt to shut him down with nothing more than a watery dismissive response?
---
Stupid bears hoarding all our springs! 
---
I didn't know about that, thanks.
---
Still I find it interesting to think about this lesser known lore.
---
If you're in a fight, there's no difference to you between feathers and rocks?
---
Also with regards to lifting weight: is it more impressive to lift 100 feathers or 100 rocks?
---
please this would be dope. Although now every sniper and "Chris Kyle -wanna-be" will have a field day in places like Watoga , and Ash
---
baby need his bottle?
---
I think the challenges has alot of stuff actually.
---
Killing animals is one so you could see how many you've killed.
---
Tbh I'm at 250 hours and i haven't looked at them too much but there are alot of personal stats on there
---
Also I don’t see anything about that for the next patch. Where did you read this?
---
Oh wrong "player" I was think of you character, you're talking about you stats. Best I've found is  (on xbox) it keeps track of hours played and achievements but not players/enemies killed. And as far as I know, there is anything like what you're asking for. Maybe the "leaderboard" Bethesda is coming our with as part of the new survival mode will keep track of that, sorry I couldn't be more help.
---
Who hurt you emotionally lol sorry that people want QOL content that doesnt pertain to you
---
It must be bugged, regular Nuka Cola grenades blow up whole groups of supermutants with a mushroom cloud and everything.
---
You might need to spend more time on this sub then... But I appreciate your heartfelt congratulations and accept this fantastic responsibility that is associated with being your personal best in the 'petty' category. 
---
In all seriousness, I hardly see how pointing out that forcing additional UI clicks to get in game is petty.
---
That's some inspired C.A.M.P. setup! So cozy!! 
---
I'm gonna keep an eye out for a nice cave now. 
---
Yay meta builds /s
---
Lol have you been living under a rock for the last 15 years? You've always had to pay to play any online multiplayer games on Xbox Live, PSN more recently after the ps3. Maybe get a job or a better one so you can afford it. 
---
It's reduced 'wear' for all weapons, not just self-crafted ones.
---
I can't wait it either. The Wasteland will feel dangerous again and I will still be easy to kill.
---
I'm not surprised. Everyone wants a nuke but doesnt want to do the snooze fest mission of finding mainframe cores n wasting a nuke card if you mess it up. I've probably launched 12 nukes, with others and solo. N honestly probably wont launch anymore sense in my player sphere I'm one of few that get asked to do it again and again because I've completed the quest. So for nukes I'm not surprised that only a handful of players have launched them sense other players are probably asking those who have already done it to do it again and again. 
---
The super mutant lore made me feel sorry for them right up until the multiple bashes with supersledges. I got over it.
---
PvP should be restricted in Watoga, that will make it the default place to go hang out, meet up others to for business and pleasure. Wanna see that barbershop open also.
---
Wasted my card unlock and rank ups investing in the Robotic Pacification card, only to find out that hard way that robots only pacify for a super short period before returning to hostile. 
---
Found out the hard way.
---
Robots are not currently tame-able for camp budget. 
---
Lol I’ve been trying to tell myself the same thing... it’s not helping lol
---
They’re all out to get us! All of Them!!! Aieeeeeee!
---
Yeah, it sounds great but the real problem for me is that it won't attract griefers from the adventure mode. It's easier to mess with someone who won't fight back right? But it isn't even in beta yet so we will see how this plays out.
---
You've got to do this while your machete still has blood on it from a fresh kill...
---
Exactly, int is useful when crafting... so rad x and mentats while crafting.  
---
True.  I convert to those every time I get a cola and grenade, but decided to make some quantums for once. Huge let down.
---
Thank you much.
---
Is lucky hole ready-to-use, or Ore I need to smelt? Because having to farm acid might make make that net zero lol
---
Fallout 76 isn't an MMO.
---
Dont mess up on the placement 
---
Perks you almost NEED:
---
Fireproof: 3pt Endurance
---
Batteries Included: 3pt Intelligence
---
Perks you probably shouldn't use:
---
Both of your Power Armor perks are unnecessary. Power Armor doesn't weigh anything on the chassis, and power armor is incredibly durable as long as you're not blowing yourself up with explosive weapons.
---
whatever man, this is a garbage post. You don't speak for me. This isn't fallout 5. This is a spin off. You'll get your game stop trying to ruin mine work this tripe. Players like you want fallout 5 but with rainbows and destiny like mechanics. This game obviously isn't for you. get with the program!
---
Or a spectacular one. 
---
I said in another reply that I only played single player games since I got a 360 back in like 2008. I never bothered to hook it up online since adapters cost money. 
---
I am currently unemployed but money isn’t a real issue to me, I just don’t spend it on things that I don’t like. 
---
After I finish Fallout 4, if I like the updates Besthesda has added to Fo76 I will get Gold. 
---
I like going to multistory buildings and clearing it out of useful junk floor by floor
---
Way the hell too many jiggarays! :)
---
I'll try rolling back drivers, but the latest drivers were installed on the 15th, been running fine with them up until a couple of days ago.
---
Handmade ... Hands Down (pun intended). I got lucky and got a TSE handmade and a friend gave me a an Explosive Assault Rifle (not a 2 shot)  Assault rifle as a backup since my handmade breaks crazy fast and the Handmade does almost three times the damage. Granted the Handmade's a L45 and the Assault Rifle's a L40 but I'd give the edge to the handmade and I seem to be able to stay on target with it better as well.  I do like the Combat rifles as well, but as others have already mentioned they are hard to do more than burst fire because of muzzle climb even with an anti-recoil build.
---
Use flat roofs as floors
---
First rant that was articulate regarding the issues.  
---
I like finding terrible legendary weapons and challenging myself to make it through tough areas of the wasteland.
---
I have done that, yes. Test it with some wood scraps first if you don’t trust it. I don’t blame you. This way is easier though.
---
I like the idea of it being rediculous but I realize not everybody shares that mentality. On ps4 I was surprised how few people had played fallout on survival mode before. 
---
If you played in beta or if you didn't look up the PVP rules before jumping in game, the very first time you and another human made saw each other it was so nerve racking because you didn't only not know about slap damage but you didn't realize how little a burden death was. now all that changes, personally I like it. I think there needs to be somethin' for everybody though. if you remember fo4 survival mode you'll remember that every time you died you probably just lost your latest legendaries, that sucked but it made death not an option (the also buffed you for continuing to fight though).
---
I don't think it's gonna be for everyone man 
---
im interested
---
No, we just need your donations for us to continue our fight against the Scorched.
---
Please ***donate.***
---
If I went from my experience playing the game pvp is less than half a percent of the player base.
---
Can I ask why specifically Executioner's?
---
Daily reminder http://imgur.com/gallery/SJvv31R
---
Yes, it is a shared world survival rpg game. I get that it isn't exactly an mmo, but it shares many similarities and is trying to persuade fans of mmo to play and enjoy the game, such as myself. 
---
So I believe the comparison about end game content is fair. Especially as the Bethesda reddit user says in future they want to introduce end game raids. Which is ALSO something that mmos have. 
---
Overtime being like 10 years
---
I like raiding people's camps for food (it'll grow back) and I love it when they leave their collectors / purifiers unlocked (either on purpose or accidentally).    On the other hand, if I'm going through there and they have some turrets/generators/other stuff that is broken I'll gladly fix it for them on my way through.   Because life is confusing like that.  ;)
---
re: Super mutants, past games have shown that there is some variation when it comes to how the radiation effects them, similar to ghouls vs. feral ghouls. Obviously, even the "worst" super mutants can still form groups and packs and what not, so it would make sense that they still might have some sort of bartering system that uses the caps. 
---
Yes exactly right. I had this badass unstable isotope mutation all day today and if anyone hit me I erupted into flames and it was badass. I needed to get more health and used deluted Rad X and then it was gone. I was so bummed out. 
---

---
It's a cylinder, but sphere is close. 
---
It uses your current level on pc... cant speak for console but Id guess it would.
---
Doomsaying already? At least wait for the game mode to go live first.
---
Explosive is the single biggest damage effect you can apply, as it will be multiplicatively affected by Demolition Expert,  and Bloody Mess; and can be made more effective with Grenadier, and will continue to benefit from the Rifleman perks you probably will have already.   10% while ADS is not only meaningless in comparison, it won't help you if an enemy closes to ranges where Explosive could potentially cause self-harm (since you'll be hip-shooting anyway).    
---
Instigating is decent, but you only get 1 shot for it, so it only works for the first shot of a covert build; given that most builds these days get their damage from repeating sneak-attack criticals, this is not an efficient bang for the buck unless you're already putting up 1000+ damage numbers per shot.   
---
Bloodied, at low health levels (10-30%, easily managed in power armor with good damage resist perks, and you can take a bunch of rads to help keep you "capped")  will give you the next biggest increase in damage output.   
---
Anti-Armor is pretty good in certain cases; I suppose you could swap Instigating here, but anti-armor is probably better all around.   
---
I have a TSE Handmade and it still breaks Crazy fast (I'd be afraid to try it without L5 gunsmith equipped), but so long as you use the L3 "Weapon Artisan" perk when you repair you can still get double the durability which helps out a lot when running with any fast breaking weapons like TSE's.
---
I just fixed some turrets at a camp on the golf course pond yesterday.  I wonder if it was the same camp.  This one didn't seem to have any doors though... it was more of an open barn style.
---
I'm pretty sure someone did a study that all stats cap out at 25 even if the stat screen says otherwise.
---
I completely agree.
---
I played for about 10 hours yesterday, got disconnected or crashed at least 10 times.
---
1) It's an extra mouse click. One. 2) Effort != post quality, and 3) sorry if I don't take any offense by your response, seeing as 90% of your posts on this sub are trolls, complaints, and tears.
---
The real endgame is figuring out who to sell your mother to for the gear needed to build a no-Power armor char that isn’t a glass cannon.
---
If you're running low on aluminum. Keep an ear out for wind chime twinkling sound. Grab the wind chime for aluminum scraps. I used to have aluminum shortage issues until I found that out. I've recently been selling excess of 50 bulked aluminum to the vendor. 
---
This is great news, thanks for sharing. I should have just left the roof alone :(
---
Like the ghouls who retained their humanity vs the screaming jeebie ones.
---
100% agree on this, it's the biggest impediment to grouping.  Anyone in you team should share kill credit regardless of whether they tagged the mob.  Yes, it may lead to some exploitation or twinking by super decked out characters but the alternative is players choosing not to group at all, which is much much worse.
---
Hell, I have plenty of friends that play this game and we usually choose to play solo and chat on discord rather than group up, primarily because grouping slows progression in FO76 rather than accelerating it.
---
Could be only 5% because the slap/pvp system is shit. If they improve it(survival) more people will go into pvp.
---
Yeah but then if you have a small area why even have it.  Too big and you just park them near?
---
I would rather it either be there nor not there 
---
Holidays buddy. They’re human too and have families. 
---
No need for the antisemitism 
---
How about a instagating explosive lever action rifle? Or do you think anti armor would be more effective for it? I’m looking at those lever action rifles now, and it seems with the demolition expert and some other stuff, you can cap about 934 damage before sneak multipliers? So an instagating in that aspect would be better than an anti armor in that scenario right?
---
So what you're saying is: it is using servers... just rented servers... 
---
And it certainly does up their cost if Amazon is running more servers because their playerbase is fractured between two modes where you can't just throw one PvE player into a PvP server just because it's below capacity and there's no open local PvE servers to throw them in.
---
You don't see an issue with your title?
---
Because if they get close, I’d likely switch over to melee 
---
Yawn. Yet another "Bethesda is making X, we want Y" post that doesn't represent anyone but the OP.  Nobody fucking cares.
---
I like how you obviously meant definitely but defiantly totally works too. 
---
Or in other words, “I’ve never been in a zone with a scorched beast”
---
While I appreciate the jukebox it's tuned to the classical station with no option to switch to appalachia radio
---
I agree but also if you exploited your way to level 200 you have no right to complain about content. 
---
I've over level 70 and I am no where near having all the new / unique cards I want.  Add to that the cards that I just wish were expressed as a lower power version of themselves and that is a lot of levels away for me at this point.   There should be no reason that once you've earned a 3 star card that you couldn't just USE that same card as a 2 star card.
---
One way to achieve that:   Bethesda should just add an expression modifier (up / down arrow) that lets you tune the power of your perk card up to its max level.   So you still combine cards to get a 3 or a 5 star card.  That 3 or a 5 would show on one corner as the max.  On the other corner of the card you have the modifier that lets you raise the usable value up to the max shown or lower the usable value so that you can run a 3 star card as a 1 star if you choose.  
---
At level 70 I absolutely hate looking through my perk cards because there are too many of them.  This expression of a perk card idea would cut out all the duplicates at least.
---
I'd just be happy if missiles didn't blow up in your face half the time
---
It could. You wouldn’t see it until 2021 that way. Quit complaining. They’re doing ok. 
---
Maybe more people will go to PvP, but I doubt the number of 5% will inflate too drastically.  
---
That still would leave the vast majority of players focused on PvE and wanting more end game content. 
---
Same camp. Even if they fix the bugs, I'm pretty much done with 76. I get the same story experience by reading the wiki, and that's hassle free and linear. Farming one hit kill guns isn't fun for me, I'll wait for a Bethesda game with a little more personality.
---
Beth is also a bigger company now with more resources and people then they used to be. They can actually juggle working on multiple things at a time. 
---
Of course, a lot of folks would be moved to the next game.  But they must have known that a large multiplayer game would need more than a skeleton crew to run/do updates. And since fixes have been coming out at a fairly quick pace, they can't be running TOO lean. 
---
Still, even if they are running a small crew, I guarantee not everyone's working on the same thing. 
---
The 95% of players who haven't finished the main quest yet don't mind. Bethesda should not cater to the very small minority of players who play too much, too fast, and then clamor for the most resources to be dedicated to them.
---
I'm glad that me enjoying the game makes you this irrationally angry. Your salty tears are delicious, and give me sustenance. Thank you for your contribution, and I look forward to laughing at your next nonsensical rant. Of course, you won't actually comment in here, because I'm sure you turned off inbox replies, because you're an r/fallout regular just here to try and stir the pot. So who's actually part of the problem here? Hint: it's you. 
---
Thanks I’ll use this to learn even more expanding my intellect 
---
Hunting rifle is trash anyways. Youre good broski
---
Antisemitism isnt cool bro
---
1.4k?
---
They worded that badly. They meant you could carry the same weight’s worth of rocks or feathers. Which I guess is true but not really an important or applicable point. 
---
I think there are holotapes at the Nuka factory in 76 that talk about the nuclear material in the soda.
---
just make sure he has dark skin
---
i agree.
---
i also feel like that would make you weaker and punish you alot for dying.
---
If you die 20times and loose 20stimpacks, that may have been all you had at that time.
---
Especially if it happens daily like that and you arent a "good" pvp player.
---
I would like for them to give you a random item generated by the game when you kill a player (and get his junk and some caps from him)
---
that would be a reward without punishment for the dying party.
---
but im glad you also see the problematic with the aid dropping
---
You've committed crimes against West Virginia and her people. What say you in your defense?
---
I use a 2 shot missile launcher with a targeting computer and it easily takes 10+ (keep in mind the 2 projectiles) 
---
Jesus.
---
Hopefully they will allow you to transfer characters back and forth. That way the early adopters won't have an insurmountable advantage after the first month or two.
---
Why do so many people think more content is not coming? We already know gear goes up to 5 stars, of course, that means more content that will drop that gear. :P 
---
Perhaps having a crazy person storm in with mirelurks chasing them they changed the layout...lol
---
I think it’s a nice feature-allowing us repair random people’s stuff. 
---
It all depends on how many shots you're going to need to kill the thing. If it will take more than 2-3 shots, you almost certainly better off with anti-armor; anything less and you can make a pretty strong argument that instigating is better.     
---
On the other hand, if you can get an anti-armor melee, then you should \*definitely\* go for instigating on your rifle, because like you said, you'll switch to melee up close anyway.
---
Telepathy doesn’t work in the real world buddy. Not when you’re trying new stuff. Those who attempt it get lots wrong. 
---
Either your dev is feedback driven or it isn’t. 
---
Here it is. And that’s a good thing. Saying they shouldn’t ask for feedback is dumb. 
---
Excuse me, Chally is a boy. 
---
I kill lower level players then myself then get on reddit and put long posts about how im not an asshole for doing what im doing #raiderlife
---
Yessssss
---
Bit of gravedigging here, but I wanted to thank you, after I recovered from the facepalm for not looking myself in the ini. This makes leaving the game minimized *much* more pleasant.
---
Ooooh. I hadn't thought of that! Great idea. I'll try leader of the pack too. See what happens. 
---
They may not have finished the last quest, but they could have taken part in the end gane content abd just failed to defeat the queen. 
---
Or been dced fighting the Queen, which happens often. 
---
Clearly, stability should be the priority, however, with how little players take part in PvP, i believe that more PvE content should be the next priority. 
---
Or at least have duel development pipelines for PvP and PvE. 
---
The only reason that didn’t scare me was because I saw it coming! If it had snuck up on me I’d have pooped my pants.
---
I’m happy to finally see some stats on what people have done.  Although this number of those reaching level 25 is a bit disheartening - does that mean the average player pretty much gave up on the game already?  That’s not a good sign.
---
He said he likes them because they’re more fun. If you’re not playing for fun you’re doing this all wrong. Not everyone is worried about min/maxing. 
---
There is a "perk loadout manager" mod on Nexus Mods for F76 that will give you eight different perk loadout slots that you can save for different types of gaming.  I've been using it for awhile and it works great, though if you're running it it might mess up using the Atom Store and in-game items from the store (like my Daughter has custom floors from the store in her Camp and not only do they not show up, but I pass right through them!, which is Ok by me as I'm not a big camp builder.  I do have some custom clothes from the store and they work fine though).
---
On a side note there is also a "Known Plans" mod that allows you to see if you already know a particular mod or recipe which is great when making rounds at the vendor bots to prevent you from accidentally purchasing something you've already learned since Bethesda hasn't included an way to check all your know plans unless you have the weapon / armor and are in the mod menu.
---
You missed the point.  The point is that a player invested a lot of real time to tune their build because of a particular powerful combination.  Then Bethesda comes along and nerfs that combo.  So your build and times spent is completely wasted.  Now you have to tune for something else that is good. 
---
There should be a way to use a higher level card as a lower level.  You've already earned that lower rank and created a higher one.  Adding extra grind so you can re-get lower level card versions is just plain dumb, frustrating, and a complete waste of time. Respecing and moving points around will still take a while, but at least you don't have to grind another set of levels just to get some lower level cards to fill in gaps in your new build out.
---
Personally, I like the idea of adding a user controlled modifier to the perk cards.  The current value that is there would become a MAX value which the modified value could match but not exceed.  Then players could turn a 5 star card down to a 2 star card if they choose without losing the 5 stars.  It would "run" like a 2 star card while it was turned down, and then if they wish they could turn the card back up to 3, 4 or 5 stars at any point they wish.  Cards could still be ranked up if they were tuned to a lower level because the rank would be applied to the MAX level of the card, not applied to how it is being used on the character.
---
i also like the nerves that PvP gives you.
---
I simply see that if you start dying to another player once, and are already low on aid items (because u were doing pvp the days before) 
---
You may get a situation where u literally have no heal items.
---
When then someone keeps hunting you down, you cannot win the fight (even if you are even on level and strenght) 
---
Just because he has stimpacks and you dont (or u just have 1-2) 
---
I would love if they would change their minds on that.
---
Its also open for abuse, because i would carry a bunch of useless flowers in hopes you only get those. (i assume u dont drop every item) 
---
And it would limit bobbleheads or nuka cola dark uses alot, since u can now loose those to other players.
---
Wheres this bubbles guy at? Be specific. Use graphs, arrows, bright colors, and small words. Please 
---
Downclock your GPU and/or VRAM by 50-100MHz and see if that helps in this case (it usually helps with black screen/no signal cases).
---
Thank you, you actually.helped a lot. Unfortunately on PC Bethesda.net keeps track of nothing...
---
I don't find it fun to lose to the Queen and do little dps due to how weak launchers are. 
---
People would have more fun, if launchers were balanced better, imo. 
---
Vendors pay more.... save em
---
They plan on dropping vaults, and other end game content, this game dropped in November and everyone expects them to have full blown dlcs dropping. Be patient and the content will come. No ones forcing you to play fallout in the meantime, or to play in survival mode. I for one am very excited for the new survival mode and I hope they manage to push it through even with all this resistance from the community. 
---
I didn't say it wasn't coming, just that it should be prioritised over PvP. 
---
I've spent plenty of time on it, thanks. You are complaining about an extra mouse click when it would 1) give survival mode to those who want it, 2) allow an outlet for those that want to PvP without being called "griefers" by the PvE crowd, 3) separate the PvPers from the PvEers so everyone is happy.
---
And you're saying that we should... completely trash this mode because you'll have to click your mouse/controller/whatever you use an extra time when you start the game? 
---
&gt;stop liking games I don't like
---
Lmao you're dumb
---
Man I really you feel you on the why in the hell am I playing attitude, it's kinda sad. I'm sure we all know that feel looking at the game and thinking "am I really about to launch it again just to crash..."
---
I want to friggin get rid of em
---
What hate? People just don't want to PVP against cheaters/dupers.
---
Dang I thought I explored that area pretty well my last time on. I'm pretty sure though it's not the far north eastern section so it must be west from the map edge.
---
That is a terrible idea
---
 👋
---
Cool. Let me know!
---
I just want to rebuild 'merica!
---
Their are cats as well. Seen two black cats by Vault 76 going down the hill toward the Moonshiners Shack.
---
1 handed melee. This game reversed Skyrim'd me. I started as a stealth rifleman. Then I got a decent mole miner gauntlet and Unyeilding armor I run Sunkissed, Ghoulish and Rad Resistant (which typing seems a little backwards) Nerd Rage, Adrenaline, and Serendipity besides my perks for mutations 
---
So correct me if im not mistaken but is fo76 becoming another fortnite. 
---
Is Bethesda trying to head in that direction 
---
I think it's because you have invisible story there, so try building floors on top of the staircase, and/or remove the floors beginning from the furthest floor tile from the staircase (or figure out which floor tile you can scrap at a time, because it's only one certain that's allowed). After you have scrapped/stored the floor tiles from that story, you should be able to scrap/store the staircase.
---
That happened to me too. I just scrapped the parts and kept the chassis.
---
Come on.. 
---
Customizing the playstyle by implementing these weight cards is a lazy ass move and poor design. There are plenty better ways.
---
Pushing updates has nothing to do with telling us what to expect for the future of the game or explaining why there have been so many issues from a triple A studio.
---
I probably shouldn’t have drunk so much lunch. 
---
sometimes photo mode will UNstick it.....sometimes
---
No it won't.  Do you have dense armor install into your torso? Do you have fireproof?  Literally take no explosive damage.  It's more than just the that's killing people.  I'd assume most of that is bobbleheads besides whatever other exploits people are using.  But yeah, dense armor.   I can craft dense raider armor chest for you to try if you are on PC.   Can't imagine how useless explosive will be after the nerf.   Bloodied weapons will be a clear champion imho.
---
It is literally unplayable right now. More crashes now than when the game launched and a Nuke was dropped on Whitespring. I have tried to do the Poseidon Power Plant 7 times now. Crashes and more crashes. How are you going backwards? 
---
 *"I wanted the ideal animal to hunt," explained the general. "So I said, 'What are the attributes of an ideal quarry?' And the answer was, of course, 'It must have courage, cunning, and, above all, it must be able to reason.'"*   
---
*"But no animal can reason," objected Rainsford.*   
---
*"My dear fellow," said the general, "there is one that can."*
---
\*Enjoy your hunting!!
---
Don't worry I also like to wear a dress as my male character when finding other players haha. Except my dress is blue.
---
It’d be cool if there was an elevator option too for camps! 
---
I like the Medic Pump. Uses a stimpack when you drop below 40% but no cool down time like the regular armor or perk card. 
---
They have a huge wide open map clearly not designed for competitive FPS gameplay and weaponry, where even if you just ignore the massive imbalances in damage and versatility, that has select few weapons that are perfectly suited for long range fights while the majority are so laughably bad at long range fights. 
---
It's basically textbook FPS 101 material that "map made of &gt;90% wide open fields+sniper type weapons = boring ass snipefest filled with nothing but shooting at tiny black dots before tiny black dots kill you first."
---
Needless to say if they want PvP to be decent, long term content it's not only gonna take some extra work but *a lot* of it.
---
It's actually really clear to see how many young adults are on here that are just before the point in their lives where they have responsibility, and don't realize that most people actually can't play video games 8 hours a day.
---
I feel like survival needs to be hardcore. Not showing nuked area's, not showing any players on the map at cetera 
---
I assume nuke keycards are valuable? I found one in some guys drop once, can I use it?
---
But the thing is, I’m not the one who made the statement. OP did. So perhaps you should tell them. 
---
I bought fallout 76 because of it's anti-griefing system and PVE focused gameplay. But somehow the survival mode looks interesting enough on paper. Would give it a try !
---
You know what, I think i mixed that up with the scorched mod and the 4star weapons had in fact this sacrificial mod.
---
Saw a diseased wendigo @harpers ferry w/squad of scorched single file.
---
Did the math. Considered the fight but it was 7 vs 1 and I didn’t like the odds or the location.
---
Lets upvote this some more yall because if what is given to us  provided by Bethesda into how  PVP mode is being shaped then I'm perfectly fine with a character reset or non-transferable character from adventure into Survival mode because think about it would yall want to go into a pvp match with someone WHO'S probably a lvl 243 with all the TSE WEAPONS in the game blasting you into the next dimension without not putting up a fight. Seems unbalanced if you ask me. 
---
Yeah I don't think I've seen ANY hate for the mode itself, only the fact that dupers will probably still be around to make it unfair.
---
 The only complaint of the mode is a PvP leaders board, which means there will NEVER be a friendly interaction. This does change it from a tense unknowable situation into a definite hostile situation. 
---
There would never be an incentive to be friendly. It's less a Survival mode and more a Raider mode.
---
Theres a perk in charisma that gives all players in a team 15% more xp when earned. Which helps when you all dont want to get a shot in on the same low level enemy 
---
A reasonable area of effect for the gain wouldnt be much to ask for. Im sure someone will find a lazy way of gaining exp without much effort regardless of what we have. However, what we have now is really competitive with our own group since most can jist one shot stuff as is. 
---
Man are you toxic. 
---
Worse, you're full of crap. If you've got a gattling gun doing the same damage per shot as a super sledge, prove it with video. I loaded up 8 points of heavy gun damage perks, crafted a base gattling gun level 50, and it's at 128 damage. A super sledge, with no melee perks or mods, is at 177. Add ~7% for the heating coil. That's a massive gap. Now throw +55% damage on it from perks, and you're the one lying outright.
---
A minigun does ~20% of the damage of a gattling gun, and it's closer to 8x the fire rate of a gattling gun without martial artist. 60% DPS gain is great unless it's a heavily armored target, because of alpha damage. And 8x the resources to gain 60% damage isn't what I'd call a meteoric rise.
---
I know how to build just fine, I'm built as a medic/support character. 450+ hours in the game, and I can tell you that your math is bad, and you're using bad gear.
---
Roll out your DPS calculations for everyone if you're so confident, but it's not gonna work out beyond "I can keep up and only spend 15x on ammo." Let alone how many rounds miss because minigun.
---
Went ahead and crafted a combat shotgun too. 104 damage per round without perks or mods. Hardened brings it up to 129. Slap some perks on that and it's a different story again, from the lowest damage shotgun. Skeet shooter 3 makes an exploding shotgun really reach out and touch someone to boot.
---
You play the game how you want, but I'm trying to keep up with people dropping the queen in  &lt;5minutes, let alone whatever boss comes next.
---
I'll drop the mic here in case you want to say something else. I'm done with ya though. 
---
Thanks!  And yep, the columns are great for putting power conduits and such on
---
Yes it does, and you don’t see it till it’s in your carry.
---
I want to play optimally and still look exactly like I want/whatever I'm roleplaying as. Hard pass. New cosmetics and fun item effects are always welcome, but keep those separate please. I also want all visual variants of armor as cosmetic mods so I can wear matching gear.
---
&gt;combat isn’t the only element of play style
---
THIS.
---
Sounds about right.
---
I'm pretty thorough when I go through any kind of area because I'm looking for anything I can. Would it have anything to do with my luck?
---
It doesn't matter that they aren't fun. 
---
Some mechanics are not meant to be fun by themselves. They are meant to round out an experience, or help drive home theme and tones. 
---
Is reloading guns fun? No. The. Who needs it! Infinite ammo capacity for all weapons!
---
I actually just logged in to reddit just to update this post. I just got on for the first time today, loaded in (or so I thought), moved around and made sure I could switch weapons before I opened my pip-boy. And then my character was just frozen, getting hit by nearby enemies. 
---
Again, why the fuck do I still play this game? 
---
I remember a game where each item had a unique serial number... can't remember the game. If duplicate serial numbers were found, the server automatically removed the duplicates...am I wishful thinking? 
---
Does anyone remember something like this?
---
I like that idea of being able to mod just the visual effects of the armor pieces
---
Gondor will see this through.
---
Awesome. Now the question remains. Is it more cost effective to scarp the helmets, and is it even possible to get the mod from the helmets. I got the Helmet today. Honestly it doesn't look great and not sure I would even wear it with BoS mod but if it's possible it will be on the to do list.
---
FUCK OFF, I might need them later...
---
PVP is the new endgame content. I've killed a lot of players. Many of them while role-playing as Jason from Friday the 13th. Many people seem to get spooked when I show up and die. My best fight was against a level 33 dude doing unarmed melee with a (possibly) bloodied mole-miner gauntlet. I beat them twice in a row but it was a close call. They beat me the third time after I did not 'seek revenge' and I turned on pacifist mode. They continued to try to kill me for several minutes but I just slowly walked away and did the ??? emote.
---
I build random traps at workbenches that won’t kill people but sure will give them a surprise :)
---
How about the really high instability of servers now? Last patch made crashes more often than when everyone was cheating with the dupe glitch.
---
It’s actually a sphere. 
---
Go back to Twitter. 
---
Every time I move my camp it duplicates my items like I’ll have 2x tinkers workbench, 2x generator etc. Am I doing something wrong to cause that?
---
If only you'd been aborted.
---
"*Top* men."
---
Pretty well? It's broken on so many levels :D I have int 10 and I can shoot like max 5 full mags with it and it breaks 😀 and the same goes with two shot missile launchers, even have the gunsmith card maxed and it still breaks faster than anything other in the game... Well except tse plasma, that's just a fucking MEME, who tf coded that. Literally one mag and it breaks, I remember I didn't even got to finish the mag or something and yes I have artistan 200% repair :D you melting your weapons faster than you melting the mobs.
---
Idk, sounds like exactly what this post is complaining about is what the rep is doing. They say they're working on core gameplay but the patch notes seem to indicate that they're working on fixing the bugs more than anything. That's all well and good, but a lot of the complaints also stem from the gameplay being boring. Unless they have a financially sound 2+ year master development plan to add content, the playerbase won't justify the money needed to make quality updates.
---
I worry that we are just crowdfunding their new engine, at least that's how the investors might see it. The game still doesn't feel like a complete $60 AAA title, and all that money is going towards fixing up the engine they want to recycle for 8 more years instead of the gameplay they promised. Whoever has been axing dialogue since Vegas, we need a word.

If you want strength to carry more, then also consider "Deep Pocket" mods for armor.

It gives u the note solider’s certificate read it it tells u where to go next
---
I've built a pretty big staircase down a cliff as well from my camp. Didn't know the camp device placement was the key to making that work.
---
Yeah, definitely. Even tomorrow, I've got a good  day ahead of me. Wife is going out of town for the weekend, but I have to drop her off in the morning, then run some errands, get some groceries, do some cleaning, walk the dogs, make dinner and go to bed early because I've got a thing Sunday morning... I'll be lucky if I can get in a couple of hours sitting on the couch. 
---
3k
---
That robot that's standing next to Miguel's corpse has some pretty funny dialogue if you stick close to him for a while. I had a level up to spend last night, so I stuck around longer than usual, and got to hear a bit about how much he disliked the fact that Miguel was rotting away next to him. Cracked me up.
---
Awh I was hoping they actually exist
---
i picked this game up at xmas time and one thing I do miss  is being able to use my spare ammo as currency.
---
 I mean in all my various modded playthroughs of fallout games I always use the spare overflowing .38 &amp; 10mm  before I ever spend my caps first and it is kind of driving me nuts that I cannot sell the ammo.
---
 I have always spent  the lower ammo type as currency or for whatever backup gun and then stored the missiles and mini nukes.  now I don't even bother picking up ammo I only craft what I need to save space in stash.
---
It's explained. The guy was nutty and hoading them.
---
Bear arms
---
Somebody at Bethesda put this guy in charge!
---
But that inhibits the damage the weapon does
---
The point of the soft cap was to discourage grinding.
---
It appears you made a sound decision. I can't imagine any game worth playing if the gameplay annoys you, or any player, and/or results in you, or them, raging. Best to step away from the game and return, if at all, at some future date. Good luck to you. 
---
Compared to the ~90% who have finished the Morgantown Airport questline... Yeah. Not a good sign.
---
Was the same when I did that mission on PC a couple of patches back. IIRC you also had to find the correct clue items in the giant lists, or the mission didn't advance.
---
Nah, other than they managed to make DCing and crashes even worse.
---
I like to have a little fun with all the ridiculous weapons. I'll whip out nocular fatmans and assassin's broadsiders and blow up the cars in whitesprings for fun. But after I run through the little ammo I have, I toss em.
---
No matter how strong they make them, they will still be awful in PvP thanks to Bethesda's amazing idea to change the fireproof perk. Combine it with a dense chest mod and you are basically immune to explosive damage.
---
They should change fireproof back after they nerf TSE weapons because that was the only reason they changed it in the first place.  
---
Shotguns and melee weapons are both good to have on hand as backup weapons for when things get in too close.
---
You didn't read the post. 
---
VATS is what made the game stand out in the first place
---
Apart from being able to use your PvE character for it (which the devs will hopefully reconsider or add some sort of limitation like separate inventories for each mode), I'm cautiously optimistic. I remember when FO4 survival mode was introduced and despite the relatively small changes the mode made in the grand scheme of things, it completely changed the feel of the game. Having slap damage removed and making death a potentially massive setback might make for a really intense gamemode. As of now, there are issues that make that prospect worrisome, so I understand the apprehension though.. I'm fine reserving judgement until March though.
---
Most of the time I run into him near the train tracks just north of the first overseer camp location. Head north and you'll often see a super mutant on the road. 
---
I've seen him 5 or 6 times on the train tracks just north of that super mutant. 
---
Ive farmed the random encounters soooo much and still haven’t seen one civil war era plan :(

Hey man, that kind of talk screws with their agenda.

I’m going to guess no, it’s just a glitch.
---
I’ve had it happen too. 
---
The music and sound effects when they are chill are pretty zen.
---
So...
---
All these pvp folks are still on pve servers w/ TSE &amp; Bobbleheads? 
---
Me too (well, haven't played every FO game, just FO2/NV/FO4). I hack into every terminal and read every log. So you're 139 and still find time to uncover every little note?
---
I wouldn't be capable of being in charge of this lol. I could certainly help whoever was a lot though.
---
This! So annoying.
---
Thats not how it works, and I found the video in this sub, just like I said.
---
I found that consuming glowing fungus soup lowered the rads I got when collecting water from the river, It seemed to give the impression that I took less rads the more soup I ate.
---
Others have mentioned the rad shield and rad-x diluted since they don't surpress mutations. 
---
I think I saw that nuka orange that you can buy at the soda shop in whitesprings also offer some radiation resistance, couple it with cola nut maybe?
---
Lead lined mod is +10 resist per limb. Biocom mesh makes your meds last longer. Trapper has highest resist. Not sure which underarmor grants the highest resist
---
Even with everything stacked on top of perk cards the best you can hope for is 7-10 radiation per tick.   My guess is that power armor and hazmat suits either has a radiation resist multiplier built in or reduces incoming raditation by a percentage.
---
Sidenote: Rad sponge helps the people you're grouped with so unless you have the charisma to share your card with yourself it's not going to do any good. I would recommend also the sunkissed since it will slow it down during the day. (There's also a way to bug out the radiation you get in a nuclear blast that is probably not intended so will probably be patched in a future update. If you spawn into a nuked zone (fast travel to friend), there is a chance to bug out the incoming radiation -from the environment not from the enemy- that lasts until you either leave the nuke zone or die)
---
I like my 90% weight reduction fatman just fine as it is, but this is probably an implementation oversight and may actually be changed
---
Looks like you were right! With the survival mode/PvP mode coming out.
---
Doesn't affect the weight of the weapon inside your stash.
---
I was complaining about the UI implementation.  At no point did I say that the mode was a bad idea (though putting dev time into other things would have been my personal preference... like PvE content...) or that it should be trashed.  That's your misinterpretation of what I wrote.
---
The nailer is awesome, I can do 300 damage with that badboy
---
True, but players shouldn’t have to be forced to equip weight carrying perks all the time, sacrificing their desired offensive builds in the process. Constantly mixing and matching perk cards when you craft stuff, have to eat/drink, carry items is so goddamn tedious.
---
Try doing what I do. Follow the game in the comments on Reddit to get a sense of what changes and/or improvements have been made. I stopped playing about a month-and-a-half ago and based on everything that I've followed on Reddit, I have yet to find a reason to return. That being said, someday I probably will come back to the game again.
---
Actually..
---
If you’re on pacifist and there’s a dedicated pvp server , I think if you’re not pacifist enabled you’re going pvp. Lolz
---
Hey, I saw you in Watoga yesterday! My username is different but I knew I recognized yours!
---
It's all about budgeting. Right now i've got a roughly 2-story that's about 4x4 with extractors and purifiers, full crafting tables and a bunch of deco. I'm a little under budget but still have enough for three turrets as well. They really eat up a ton though, I couldn't do four.
---
You have to watch stored items too. It's stupid easy to end up with half your budget items as stuff in there that's not being used. Definitely check and clean that out regularly.
---
You’re all just making shit up and wildly guessing to try to prove your points. 
---
Yes please. I want to grief with these in PVP mode against new players. Thanks.
---
Yeah, there's a note I think that says something about the one lady hiding all of the strontium.
---
I'll still play what I own, will just not by any more merch and such. Future games will be bought second hand, then upgraded second hand again to the inevitable "GOTY" edition with DLCs included. I have to assume sales will be down for their future releases after every bit of this fiasco.
---
I agree with your point re telling what to expect. 
---
I made it myself in the past. I’m talking about your suggestion that is needing to tell them what matters and what doesn’t is a bad thing. 
---
It’s not a popular view with over-entitled consumers, but like it or not, agree with it or notC,  it is the answer to your question: 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a6txdh/welcome_to_the_design_team/?st=JRCP1E6U&amp;sh=ec1d9bdf
---
You're forgetting that alot of people played a little bit, then quit playing, inflating your number for the overall "active" player base. All of the conplaining on this sub illustrates the ammount of "pvp" happening.
---
False
---
If you haven't yet go do Mayor for the day.
---
No thanks. I bought this game to grief in PVP. That needs to stay the focus. Thanks.
---
That area is protected so you are unable to nuke the corn there. 
---
What's the point on acquiring mods for your weapons or armor pieces if you can't even use them if you don't have the right perks for them? Aren't mods made for that purpose? To avoid spending on Perk Cards you'll barely use, Just like in Fallout 4.
---
I would understand if using a mod teaches you how to build weapon mods like plans do, but you don't even spent resources, you just "attach" the mod, so why do you need the fabrication skill of the perk card?
---
MODS Should be a by pass to avoid using Perks Cards.
---
5% better damage against molerats (who Snipes molerats?) But -20% damage against everything else
---
Does not count as armor for chameleon perk
---
I was being sarcastic in return. Apologies. I have horrible spelling in my response, the op and even now. I figured it woulda been read and seen for what it was. 
---
I forget sometimes that you can't really hear the intent or tone of the response or conversation if your reading it. 
---
So my bad for the misunderstanding. 
---
Ima stab you in the throat  you fat gamer i bet the only games you play are ones with anime girls get the fuck out of this Reddit 
---
Had the same issue. 
---
Took off targeting HUD and went from 12+ crashes in a 6 hour play session to zero (one server disconnect, but that is to be expected).
---
Ymmv.
---
That's weird, for me they usually move hazily to the left.   
---
Boy they sure know some maneuvers.
---
That's the balance of the perk card game right now. To be honest, all the heavy weapons kinda suck. Rockets weighing 3lbs each is more of a nusaunce to me. 
---
Its not a fun system, and I think that the unlocks of fallout 4 were nicer. That would lead to incredibly overpowered characters tho. And in an mmo there has to be an attempt at balance. 
---
As above 
---
So carry it
---
I used to call my guns after legendary modifications or other names like "The Instigator", then I would find a better one, boom, "The Instigator 2.0".  The "Annihlator". The "Fire Starter". The "Pray then Spray". Loved that feature.
---
no games with anime girls
---
Deep love for all you folks who randomly do this. 
---
I came back to my camp to find a SB taking out mine and camps along savage divide.
---
It tore up 3 camps that were attached by a string of lakes.
---
When it was done I had to repair all my walls and roof. From then on, I upgraded and went to brick walls and turrets.
---
Alrighty, you sir, have a wonderful evening.
---
Depends. Am I getting all uppity because I heard about a turd in someone else’s swimming pool and want to feel victimized with them? That’s a much more apt example for this sub imo. 
---
You're full of crap.
---
That’s great! We are on pc is that ok? 
---
Lose pain train for more damage pain train is super annoying in areas with friendly robots like whitesprings/the enclave
---
Take as much adrenaline as you can the game loves waves of low level enemies that will keep it charged.
---
If you have the spare points thru hiker would be a solid choice as melee tends to lack in weight reduction.
---
Having a few points in lockpicking is always a good idea especially as a lone wander
---
 Cola nut works really well with thru huker as it can basically replace aid with nuka.
---
If you're going to do mutations (which for a pure melee build i recommend) you almost need 3 ranks of class freak and to carry starched genes at all times. 
---
Also sometimes you dont get the trophy for doing certain things. My friend has killed the SBQ 3 tines but no trophy. 
---
Yeah. Could work like taking an armor piece to a workbench and dismantling it to get a mod called "metal leg - sturdy - painted" and applying it to your legendary heavy combat armor. That way we still have to work for the mods. Also add a mod to completely conceal armor.
---
Is there a new duping thing, then? I thought that problem was fixed.
---
if you like dog shit then by all means. go support all the scumbag things they have done to with the bag and the rum, the banning, the 20$ santa outfits, releasing players information...
---
I know *exactly* which location you're talking about, because I tried to set up my camp there once. It's a stone's throw northeast of Lake Eloise. If you place your camp well you can totally get both extractors, but the place attracts sierra bravos something fierce. Ultimately not worth it.
---
Quite frankly with the various economy issues that keep popping up, I'll play again when I can have my own server without building limits. If that doesn't happen I'll just keep playing Fallout 4.
---
It is not. You'll net a lot if you switched to an acid extractor though. You'll get a lot more than 14 lead from smelting with 10 acid. 
---
&gt; Here's the thing, you don't actually care about the game. You only care about **increasing the amount of personal power that you have in the game, and it shows.**
---
I'm not even sure what this even means given the context we've been speaking in. I'm asking for more content, more content also very typically comes with new gear that may or may not be more powerful than what you currently have. Raid style content is fun with friends. I have no remote interest in being as strong as I can either, just enough to do the content that I want to do.
---
For me, I am at lvl65, i enjoy the game,  not sure how many hours i have played, but i  personally found that around lvl 40ish, I start to hunt weapons that can do some decent damage, as the mobs get larger and harder to kill. Still bloody looking for a decent firearm that could atleast do something more then sub 100 damage.  And you start to grind the events looking for better. Which gets a little repeatable. Chuck in the need to craft ammo and required 
---
Although it probably more my fault as i kinda like the gatling gun and lever rifle,  I have plans for both and it's about the strongest i can build,  75 dps gat, 95 dps lever. 
---
But i do love the game, just got to get that one drop i am after.....lol
---
From the vendors, it's about 1400 a day. Farming super mutants, cap stashes with cap hunter, and events will get you much more.
---
That being said, I'm still in deficit most of the time. 
---
If you look at my post history, I am in fact a raider. I love the PvP aspects of this game. I am criticizing the community.
---
Not sure why you jumped to a conclusion about me in 3 sentences.

I remember in fallout 3 the energy weapons were high class, particularly the plasma guns. You got one and were like ooooooh. Now you’re like ughhhh
---
Everyone? Really? I’ve never personally encountered a “cheating asshole” in over 300 hours. If they ruined my fun I was somehow unaware.
---
Cult faction is a must. 
---
It happens sometimes, but occasionally (once) an enemy will have two legendary items on them. So it balances out.
---
Reduction of heavier weapons will give a better weight reduction per perk point since you'll only be carrying around a few weapons at a time.
---
not really. just saw how they tried putting out 300$ crappy costumes. i was glad tho when I saw the leaked server numbers and they are pretty much dead. but if zero people played they would fully learn a lesson. but they pretty much did learn their lesson the numbers show so, todd pulled his main teams off to work on the next game. if you like to support trash and them doing scummy things like scams, releasing private info, making fans apologize in essays even for visual mods like its the 6th grade have fun LOL
---
I had the challenge pop wearing the enclave uniform and hat 
---
Not bad. 
---
Love the game mmkay buh bye.  
---
God you're pathetic. 
---
Yeah, as the system is now I guess it’s the best we have. Even if it’s like a 2/10 not sure how you could change it otherwise unless they buff stashes up more like they hinted at before.
---
Nah. It shouldn't be easy to optimize a character. That's called playing the fucking game.
---
Git gud, scrub.
---
Drink them then....
---
Since when can’t you sell a legendary weapon?
---
Buff the fatman and minis and make them rare as fuq 
---
&gt;There was a huge uproar yesterdsy when they announced that people could transfer established characters to the survival mode servers, 
---
Mostly due to people thinking with their "duck fupers" hate boner instead of complaining about the root of the issue, i.e. fixing the horribly balanced weapons and loot tables because ***even if*** Bethesda disallows transfers and nipped every known and would have been discovered duping method right in the bud before the mode's release through some miracle; guess who'd be right back complaining after they realized stopping dupers and character transfers won't do shit against the people who get really lucky and/or cooperate with friends to gather god-tier PvP focused loot that they can't just "git guder" against because it's clearly unbalanced af dupes or no dupes.
---
Yeah for sure, I can definitely see why people would like that. It wouldn't matter for me a whole since I run BOS Combat and that's what I prefer the look of the most, but I also really like the Shadowed look so not sure which I'd choose lol
---
Okay. Main entrance of whitespring resort. You enter, go up the stairs. There is a bar with a robot.you walk past this bar and directly to the left.there is like a windowframe-wall.just hold left.there is a doorway like 20 meters down the way on your left side, can easily be overlooked. There is a red mister gutsy called bubbles.
---
The park for alcohol is Party boy/girl.
---
"bowler hat" doesn't count towards the challenge, use the one called "bowler"
---
I wish we could sort out how much is a failure on the design and how much is crappy players running dupes. Today’s been lousy with server crashes. 
---
I can almost hear the swearing when your basketball takes a bad bounce.
---
You sir are a goddamn saint.
---
Sorry, don't have time to read your post.  Meeting a friend in the game soon.  
---
Good luck with your crusade, or whatever.
---
and what about all the scummy shit they did? leaking private info. 20$ santa outfits, canvas bag scam, the rum, banning players and wanting an essay like its the 6th grade even for a visual mod, offering only 500 atoms as an apology which isnt even enough for the in game version of the canvas bag, the dev room, literally a new scandal or something stupid they did every few days. so the game is crap and looks like crap thats one thing. but to still support it after all the scum stuff has happened.....as I said shame on you. and I mean that. I can keep going about all the scummy stuff if need me to
---
I disagree. The assault rifle is fantastic, mostly because i have yet to even see a handmade. 
---
That’s what surprises me about some of these posts on here.  Fallout 4 was no different on launch.  Skyrim the same.  Ambitious games usually need a lot more play testing than the beta periods require.  
---
Not getting stuck in my power armor anymore was pretty fucking major for me lmao. 
---
Why have there been so many issues?  We were told when the game was revealed that it was experimental and was going to develop over time.  If you expected a complete and polished game at launch, I don't know what to tell you besides "duh!"
---
I think you’re missing the overall point. If you’re not pacifist enabled, then you’re on a dedicated pvp server.. lolz.
---
And by omission, if you’re pacifist enabled, your TSE weapons are nerfed or kited to point sticks and stones to other players.
---
Uuggghhhh....fine. I'll tell where my base is.  Northeast of grainger farm in toxic valley. You need to find out though, cause I don't know how to be more specific then that without being logged on.
---
Lead and junk.
---
You’re just speculating and passing it off as fact. 
---
I dont play fortnite bud. yea if you like exploring an empty world that looks like crap with the same fetch quests with bugs every 2 min, a game where they are such a joke it took what 7 weeks to think of adding a push to talk feature? LOL
---
That might be true but it doesn't refute what the OP is saying: Having to micro-manage inventory or take a bunch of extra perks for weight really does not make the game more enjoyable.
---
I'm actually at a point where I don't need to worry about weight that much, but I'm running excavator power armor, 15 STR, and about 2 points each in bandolier, ordnance express, pack rat, strong back, bear arms, traveling pharma, thru-hiker, whatever perk reduces armor weight, and the weight-reduction for shotguns. It's a little ridiculous but I can carry about 100 lbs of scrap, and I don't have to stop every 10 minutes and dump stuff I actually want or could sell/scrap, and can carry a spare weapon or two without stressing it.
---
I had it happen three times last night while moving shop. Spent so much time scrapping excess walls/floors/roofs, so I could place an extractor...
---
I've noticed it happens most often when you have a large, complicated, and entirely connected structure. 
---
Game tries to blueprint the whole thing, and when you go to dismantle said blueprint after moving; it doubles (sometimes triples) the component parts. 
---
ps3 7-8 year old graphics at best
---
I bought my plan from Grahm I believe (or the random spawn vendor by the Charleston station, they spawned in succession so I’m not 100%), he showed up at the Poseidon plant heading towards the junkyard.
---
And having to fight the urge to lunge and catch it. If they ever allow us to place items, I'm gonna have to put deflated sports balls down at the bottom.
---
I feel almost bad for him, he keeps having outbursts about millennials. Clearly something in his life isn't going well and this is his outlet to complain about what he feels is the source of his problems. Don't know why he's taking it out on FO76 players, he's probably the type of sunk a million hours into the game already and now is bitter that he's bored.
---
Where does one obtain this tin foil hat?
---
Probably will be the only thing in the atomic shop I buy
---
I hit level 25 in 35-40 hours on my first character, but I'm very slow and methodical in my exploration. I also play more hours per day than you. My primary chatacter is level 70 now, and has finished all the main quests. My second character is level 35. I'm still finding things to do and locations I missed the first time around.
---
Our anecdotal experiences are not indicitave of a trend, however, and any extrapolation about the average player is pure conjecture. Many gamers play more than one game at a time, for example. I honestly don't know what people are doing, but I don't necessarily think your conclusions are reasonable either. We just don't have enough data to make such a judgment either way. I suspect the truth is somewhere in between.
---
# on ps4 more people have unlocked the 20 kill achievement than reach level 100 achievement
---
all the achievements are low because so many gave up on the game early
---
Ya I opted for somewhere safer after they proved relentless.
---
its not just amount the game being a massive piece of garbage. its all the terrible scumbag stuff they have continued to pull this whole process, so shame on you for not fully standing up and boycotting them with all the shit they have pulled. well im glad nearly everyone has. I guess there is a few idiots who wont admit they are salty cause they spent 60$ right when it came out
---
I didn’t want to admit it before, but I was low on caps and just wanted to see what he had, lol
