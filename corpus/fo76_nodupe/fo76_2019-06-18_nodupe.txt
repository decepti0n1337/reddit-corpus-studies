Should be using linear PCM, not Dolby
---
---
---
With how OP melee is in this game, I’m happy for limitations on it, TBH.
---
Mine's doing okay now but the other day I had the same thing happen until I just gave up.
---
1.) Remove 4 player teams and replace it with Single or Duo's.  
---
2.) While you do this, reduce the map radius to "small" and max match size to like 26 players.  
---
3.) Introduce the data-mined Charleston map.  
---
This will make it so getting into the next match is twice as fast.  
---
It will make for quick action instead of spending 5 minutes looting before you see someone.  
---
It will remove overpowered curated teams from dominating games.  
---
  
---
4.) Auto unequip armor if you just upgraded or put on a fresh armor.  
---
5.) Use the ping system similar to Apex Legends. Imagine showing your team right where a Marine armor is, or where you saw an enemy.  
---
6.) Improve the sound in the game. I should be able to hear footsteps accurately.  
---
7.) Get rid of useless weapons. The explosive bow, gauss rifle, assaultron head, .44, lever action, and all the junk .38 guns  
---
8.) Nerf the Gauss shotgun because it shouldn't be able to one shot someone from the roof of the parking garage to the roof of the robot shop in north Morgantown.
---
Sometimes the best builds fit perfectly, and this is great.
---
They should at least give us the option to scrap ammo.
---
Yeah. On Xbox too. Mostly nice and wonderful people. When I was around level 50 someone gave me a full XO1 armor setup. I never forgot. Just yesterday I gave one of my best PA to a level 15 player (and a couple of * weapons/low level). Helping is entertaining and mentally rewarding! ;-)
---
Its irritating when that happens. Uranium Fever is both the best and worst for this in my opinion. At level 170ish, a level 40 legendary is nothing but scrip. But it's easy scrip for everyone there. So why not share?
---

---
I had the opposite of your story today though. 4-5 players ranging from 100-400, all doing the come here emote when a legendary showed up. Let's face it, they can't really hurt anyone with a high level. Everyone shot and waited until all the others gave a thumbs up emote, then destroyed it. That's how it can and should go.
---
Edit: spelling.
---
So you're talking about camp budget not stash budget
---
Oh shoot, that’s a bit crap isn’t it. Thanks for the info dude.
---
76 isn't an MMO and MMOs do tend to have endgames. They are just often reset with expansions.
---
The bullion grind isn't that bad at all either.
---
Yeah AWOL Armaments is another one that would be nice to have as a public, I've probably only done it a handful of times due to rarely seeing it pop up.
---
Yes, yes it is.
---
Yep my thoughts exactly
---
It wasn't even my analogy look at the damn usernames. 
---
I hope you feel better after your rant.
---
It does, aswell as the one in Toxic Valley where you clean up the toxic sludge, I forget the name. Got a badge from that one today.
---
Yeah, isn't really explicitly clear and you can do it no matter who you side with.  You lost a little rep gain which sucks though.
---
I want mole rat mines.
---
I got 1 each of the first 3 times I did it.  I was wearing my scout gear though.  Maybe it helps!  Probably not.  Seems to be about 20% drop rate or less.
---
I can get down with these changes. I'd personally prefer a Watoga map but any map addition is nice in this game. Edit: looking back it's cool to squad up with people and I'd rather have a squad and solo option. Don't wanna squad up do solos. When I mean solo I don't mean put me in a server where people are teamed. I'd like to solo against other solo players.
---
It’s all the mould. Spores are technically flora, right?
---
Thanks I'll have to take a look tonight, I stopped at the free states one and didn't have it.but have yet to search whitesprings for it. Thought that would be too easy lol
---
Steam summer sale is June 25th to July 9th according to the usual Russian leaks
---
It’s not bad at first. Someday I’m going to want the secret service jet pack - after grinding out weapons and weapons mods - and it’s going to be a multi-week slog. (Yes it could be as short as 10 days, but I simply have other things to do)
---
But yes, Fallout 76 is an MMORPG. It may not force you to gather a hundred people to kill one boss, but lots of MMOs have seen past that nonsense. FO76 still meets any broad definition when compared to other large and small MMORPGs out there.
---
So at least on Steam, there’s the favorite wheel and I can set 12 items, 1 through 9, 0, minus, and equals. That’s all the favorites I can have and I’m not wasting valuable buff/health space on gear lol.
---
Yeah id unintentionally waited until i was already on friendly rep and was thinking finishing the quest would take me the rest of the way or close but I guess not eh
---
I'll take a look, I searched the building with the display cases and didn't see anything. Maybe someone else grabbed it.
---
Cripple their legs first and they sit there, new ones dont spawn and you can go pick up ore. After you get enough ore (25 for the first reward level), kill the ghouls and they start spawning again.  
---
I agree, its great XP. Im usually a little bummed when other people show up at all.
---
So how's it sound?
---
I don't know that location where is that bear in the bog?
---
Broken by some patch or another, hasn’t been fixed. There’s a lot of those.
---
Checked all the trains and nothing, maybe I'll try server hopping and see what happens
---
Needs more SUB for the .1
---
Thanks for the offer but I think I want the plans.
---
sarcastically, i play solo i wish we had a looking for party or chat so we can text, i have a headset mic but omfg you use it and people still won’t or don’t party up
---
7.1 here too. I am very impressed with the sound positioning. Two thumbs up from this one armed man! 😂
---
Power armour
---
It's the red one right by the station,  closer to the assultron. If you have 1st I'd recommend hoping. Harper's ferry and that spot are usually looted.
---
Edit. It's usually got a rifle in the train car too. Hope that helps you find the spawn. Oh it's on a barrel in the car.
---
Do it. You won’t be disappointed. Or, that’s my opinion, at least.
---
Just scum of the game dude. If you have evidence, try to report him to trading Fallout subreddits. If he ever tries to hop on here. Also what platform?
---
I presume if I go wanted and people try to engage, I then get to attack them back right?
---
Might be a good way to finally get that Kill X players goals done when overzealous people who cannot defeat me try to do so.
---
I have clips once they upload on my Xbox I’ll post them for sure I’m so upset I’m seriously thinking about just quitting the game all together now.
---
It's the Synth. The Institute is thriving at this point in time.
---
All of the rifles have left-handed reloading animations also
---
What does it say?
---
I don't think so, I can't remember tbo. I got the Amiga when I lived in the UK, so it was sometime in the early 1980s, when I emigrated to NZ I brought it with me. For a while I was the NZ agent for Jumpdisk, a utility/game disk put out by some guys in Scotland.
---
Thank you to everyone who has taken the time to contact me with amazing offers of help. I think I won't be playing again until tomorrow (NZ time) as we've got a visitor this afternoon. Don't they know game time is precious? ;-) Anyway, I'll be sure to add people once I get back to the game. 
---
One thing I forgot to say is I don't have a headset, so can we communicate via typing on the keyboard?
---
Don’t let one bad apple spoil the bunch. Make friends in this game or play with ones you have. I’ll be down to play with you if you don’t have anyone.
---
I mean you can just glitch through the silo and finish it in about 10 minutes
---
Yea, that's normal - the FO76 bow animation is opposite; bow in right hand, left-handed draw
---
Aaaah, that makes so much sense
---
🥇This Is art!!! Bravo!!! 🖌🖼
---
That’s nice of you to say. But I’m gonna chill out for a bit and cool down.
---
It doesn't take hours to get through a silo. You must be doing something wrong. What kind of weapons and perks are you using?
---
*Side note:* I actually really do Love this!!!
---
I bet she told you she had a headache too :-D
---
Don’t blame you dude. Lack of content and assholes of people make the game god damn annoying at times. You enjoy your break man.
---
Thanks, I didn't know there WAS one. I've only found the one combat armor helmet since I started playing. I'm a level 52, now. And I haven't even gotten a combat armor drop in over 2 weeks. I think the last time I got one I was a level 32.  I've had the helmet since I was a level 18, I think.
---
Oooops missed that sorry. Not a rant just further explanation. Nobody in that discussion thread stated that the imaged appeared without disclaimer Read the damn posts.
---
Xbox
---
I don't really care what people donate. I was just offering suggestions. I get it's a game.
---
Just glitch through the map
---
Definitely!!!! One of the reasons why I don’t use the Gatling style weapons very often. I was using medic pump to get around that but now that I run a bloodied on my heavy kinda a pain in the ass.
---
Sure! (I tried to make a joke) LOL
---
It just sucks because I seriously love the game just pisses me off when shit like this happens and it wouldn’t be so bad if I didn’t just get this gun like 2 days ago. Fml
---
Spending every god damn day in the asylum because I like to punish myself apparently. Must find the red...
---
BuT YoUr NoT dOiNg MaX dAmAgE!
---
Yeah I feel that. Not sure when this started but wasn't always a thing. I only use my explosive gatling laser for the bosses now as I have a nice guess shotgun:D
---
Well with maps that can start as low as say 16 people to a max of 26 people, it might be possible to have this and the classic 4 player mode.  
---
Watoga would be good too, but just realistically speaking, I'd say Charleston or Harpers Ferry will be the next map since it was data-mined. https://imgur.com/8kPtSUT  
---
Notice the size of Charleston map, perfect for solo mode.
---
Agreed. I'm not a pvp guy...but if that server were to exist, I'd like to add that your SPECIAL stats need to have a real effect. Like if you're 15 strength and 1 intelligence, maybe you randomly grab your melee weapon backwards and have to equip it again.  Just random odd stuff that might fit the Fallout world.
---
In FO4 I tried a whole fence line of radios 2c if it would make it loud, but it just glitched the sound 🤷‍♂️
---
But, she could make you some caps...
---
Nah.
---
Camp building is one of my favorite things. It’s so relaxing after a stressful day
---
Put a ticket in with BGS. they gave me back 700 atoms I spent on the monster suit.
---
I solod it with the assistance of a regular SB and 1* SB. Took quite a while lol.
---
Put in a ticket for support. They should be able to refund you your atoms. In some cases they may even let you keep the item. Response time may be 3 - 7 days before you get your atoms refunded.
---
Great advice, I was unaware of this, thank you.
---
Yeah I do it fairly often but only because my camp is down there lol so if I see it I go
---
Add some more robots and it would be a great public event
---
Yeah it was an atomic shop item unfortunately.
---
I think I’m going to try only fast traveling to train stations. This is really a beautiful game and I feel like I’m missing out by fast traveling everywhere
---
This problem started a week ago. I built my camp in that spot 3 months ago. And, no, my camp has not been moved since then. That's why I'm so angry about it. And I'm only angry at Bethesda for this.
---
Bethesda could easily give you a way to set a landing spot for fast travel. But they can't be bothered. Or they could just put you back where you were when you logged out. But that's too easy, I guess.
---
There is PvP in this game? No, I must be in the wrong sub.
---
PS. Don't take a workshop part makes you sound a little bit of asshole.
---
If it makes you feel any better, I accidentally scraped my leather coat last night while I was mass scrapping. Only took me since release day for it to drop for me. Had it for two days. I wanted to quit too after that.
---
Someone sent me a message complimenting me on my camp today. Felt good!
---
If you truly think "half" are using aimbots, then I suspect you simply are a low skill player.
---
Of course, any of those would be nice adds just something different to give new life to the mode is nice! I'm assuming they are more likely to be added as they were datamined. This is all cool for me!
---
I came across a camp a while back that had pews and candles lining an aisle leading up to the giant lion statue labeled "BIG LION" in neon letters
---
Yes! Although the snapping could be worlds better. I still love the whole thing. Finding a dope spot to set up camp, then making my camp look like it belongs there. More enjoyable than the story most times
---
They aren’t worth much as stated, but people will still buy the hats from your vendor in the 50 to 100 cap range. You can even sell the red hat for a tad more. But nothing over 150 caps
---
I think it’s the one labeled “effects” ... that one turns down the wind and rain
---
Atom items should be Zero budget....
---
SHHHHHH!!!! You know not of the ill sewage that spills across your tongue!!!! The Man Hath Spoken!!! Now bite your tongue!!! FOR WE DO NOT SPEAK OF THEM!!
---
we had ritas in north Carolina when I lived there, seen a few here in Florida too
---
Walked by one saying “ Settlers lives matter “ had a bunch of bullet holes under it ..... very political i though but had to laugh for a minute because it fits the waste land pretty well
---
Go to inventory, weapons, press unfavorite, press favorite.  
---
This should cure it.
---
Targeting Hud
---
Reactive Plates
---
Tesla Coils
---
Calibrated Shocks
---
I believe they are all the tier 5 plans
---
None of the armor plans are actually sought after, given you can get them for free from Fort Defiance.  
---
Mods-wise, Calibrated Shocks is probably the rarest.
---
I just went with raiders cause I thought it fit better for busting into a vault. Also I thought the characters for the raiders were a lot more varied
---
This is good stuff.  Great use of CAMP space.
---
I’m pred season 1-2 and I have recent videos of 20 bombs in pubs and a 14 kill game in pred. You only talk about dwarf account cause that’s the only way you can get a 20. And rank means nothinggggg. Omg you hid in a tree and have a kdr of .5 lol ur a bot kid u talk like one too
---
It was NW from Vault 76, just on the road, I kept server hopping on Anchor Farm, just had to run few seconds on the road and there is spot where random NPC/Trader can spawn. Should be quite easy to find, its quite obvious empty space next to big tree, where a camp can spawn...
---
And Bow plans are bought with caps.
---
In the words of the Almighty Todd: "It just wOrKs!"
---
Maybe I’m being to drastic I can’t let one person ruin it for me but it really just made me mad! Lol
---
I know you’re a pred rat and I’m the one finding you in a corner and t bagging you after I roll over you
---
I do enjoy visiting others camps to see what they look like.
---
As for my camp, it's a high traffic area by the Whitesprings. I built it in the cliffs, with 3 separate structures that actually snap together. I spent the time and materials to put in supports so looks realistic. I sell tons of basic.plans for cheap, chems at half value, and some random weapons, armor, and outfits. I am specifically trying to keep treated under armors.for sale for 100 caps or less. I was many levels in the game before I knew they existed.
---
Otherwise I like to stroll through the Whitesprings in stealth, to see if I can kill everything and not get noticed. Same at the asylum. Then I do the faction dailies, along with a couple others I enjoy.
---
The one thing I do every single time I go to my camp though...is murder the mole miners by Uranium Fever. Every once in a while they get drawn out and shoot poor Sofia and my camp.
---
I never kill the same one first. 
---
They must all know what it's like to see their friends explode from level 3 Bloody Mess teamed with my lever action, just before I stab the last one to death and beyond with a cultist dagger. Then I feed on their glowing flesh while I stare at their corpses. The whole ordeal is a sacrifice to the Mothman. 
---
No mercy. No remorse. No mothballs. 
---
After that I go and pick some flowers.
---
Boss?
---
They data mined those literal mailboxes months ago. I don't believe they were ever used in game so who knows. Maybe they are coming with a future patch or they have been forgotten about.
---
[removed]
---
Not bad at all, as long as you put thought and creativity into in, IMO. And don’t target new players - if they stumble into it, fine, but don’t position it in a way to specifically take advantage of folks that don’t know to be suspicious or would be disproportionately put out by losing materials. You can be classy about a trap - I’ve seen people gift materials, aid, and gear to lower levels that get caught to make up for it (though they might just be one of us that normally do such for them anyway).
---
I actually really like checking camp builds out - one of the few reasons I pop into Adventure Mode - and love critiquing trap camps or traps within camps, especially ones that go the extra mile to include enemy spawns, though they are not particularly effective as a trap to get loot from players so much as a “gotchya” effect.
---
Go to check a vending machine to only find propaganda fliers and technical data and the floor has dropped out under you in the mean time, dropping you into a deathclaw spawn? Nifty! 
---
Walk in to find a stash/scrap box and a gulper or wendigo drops on you? Brave of you to pop your camp up there and shame on me for forgetting where I was!
---
Check out water purifiers to see if they are unlocked and a mirelurk queen pops up? Yeesh, I was not looking where I was going and props on the repairs setting that up must entail!
---
These last two are not net positive in resource capture, as a proper trap is meant to be, BTW - they are just fun.
---
Really, only on Saturday or Sunday? I've never had any issues, though I purchase from him just after he resets on Saturday 8pm ET. That would suck if you can't purchase from him on a weekday.
---
Its brave of bethesda to have even gone out on fo76 the way they did. Im just waiting for the next new content. Other then daillies and events ill be in fallout new vegas or fo4. Scrip and bullion.
---
I've just started playing with $400 Sony headphone that have 3d sound, I've had to stop going into areas with ghouls... Too scared.

Needs work Ray !
---
Bethesda graphics since at least FO4. 
---
I never found a way to adjust the graphics on a PS4.  Maybe there is a PC mod.
---
pick a different floor
---
I've only been playing about a month, and I've yet to see more than 1 instance of another player taking over a workshop on a server I'm on. That aspect of the game seems kinda dead on Xbox, so I figured I was fine to screw around with the snack food factory workshop. Nope. some asshole 4-5 times my level shows up, and one shots me while I'm just standing there clearly not wanting to engage in PVP. I just wanted to team up, or whatever, you can have the factory. I don't care. 
---
Fucker took the scrap I'd been gathering all night, too. Harsh lesson for a noob.
---
I think they introduced this with the last patch.
---
There are piles of random items all over the place.
---
I kinda like it because it's more realistic than searching containers for random loot.
---
Story time!  Share a description of your favorite C.A.M.P. encounter; bonus points for pics.

Mine was a full press conference room with Mr. Pebbles (the astronaut cat plushie) at the podium.  Complete with flags and such.  Super clever, and I wish I had taken a picture.
---
People never seem to trust me either when I’m in power armor.
---
I mean, sure, I’ve got the vault boy head with glowing red headlamp eyes on the X-01 with the blackbird skin. But can’t they see past that, and the flaming pitchfork, and accept my bags full of Nukashine and severed head plans?
---
I've run into the issue many times on first access of the terminal. It's super frustrating.
---
Hear hear!
---
Conveniently placed chair, there.
---
Just what have *you* been up to?
---
Bonus points for fallout classical music!!!
---
Except for finding officers. I'm pretty sure Bethesda fucked them up a few weeks back. You can track the beep all you want but they rarely actually lead directly to an officer.

Hmm, the double wall trick works with powered doors?
---
I just want a "repair whatever can be repaired with the resources I have available" option. Like, if I don't have enough tatos to repair the plants, REPAIR EVERYTHING ELSE AND LEAVE THE TATOS WRECKED.
---
Yeah, I’d like that too.
---
I buy Smiley’s gold every Tuesday afternoon without fail. Where did this Saturday/Sunday thing come from?  I’ve seen some mention of it before.
---
Nuclear Winder needs  ~~balancing changes and bug fixes~~ to be scrapped. FTFY
---
You have to deal a certain threshold to be able to loot her. They made it so people wouldn't show up, shoot her once, and then let everyone else do the work
---
Happened to me 3 times now, I thought being a high level with powerful things would help me. NOPE
---
I was wondering about that too. Good to know.
---
They take up little ro no stash weight. The issue is indeed the camp budget.
---
I dunno, I had a similar glitch happen to me with that “heavy radiation poisoning” glow and got tons of messages asking how I got it
---
Its only about 1500-2000 damage. She has 75% Damage Reduction so if you want to get an idea of how much you are doing turn on damage numbers. It was made so that people wouldn't show up, hit her once, and then let everyone else do the work
---
thanks you! I will withdraw my other statements in this topic. 
---
I was very certain it was still this way. Nice to know. Thanks
---
Flux, lots of lovely flux
---
Never heard of Stabilized eh
---
That's true.
---
I came back to Wastelanders and simply cannot do any of the dailies/bullion/legendary grind anymore. It's amazing how little endgame we have gotten in 76's lifespan.
---
Now I am just checking which will have a better season system: The Division 2 or 76 and that will decide which game I will play(but TD2 already has lousy seasons, so please let it be 76).
---
This. From roleplay perspective, with all the horrific mutated horrors out there, going into the wasteland NOT in a tank suit is pure lunacy.

Sure that’s a Queen?
---
Are you me?
---
That's in you for fighting at your camp. Ignore or just get a quick gank in and then server hop if u didn't want pvp.
---
Sorry but WRONG, this specific outfit is worth over 120k caps easily. Smart and experienced people dont sell these for measly caps, they trade them for multiple god roll weapons or 2-3 legacy weapons or items of equal rarity from limited events. "25-50k caps" I'm lost for words on that...
---
I've been having weird run-ins with people lately. On Sunday I log on, and someone entered my camp and was constantly slashing me with a knife. I ignored them, and went on to do what I was planning on doing that day: launch my first nuke. I go and do that, and as I'm traveling back to my camp I noticed the guy is still there. Took me 45 min to an hour to launch the nuke, and I'm guessing he's been there the entire time. When I get to my camp, he resumes his slashing haha.
---
Just now I log on, and within a minute or two, someone's already at my camp. They try attacking me, and I do what I always do and ignore. They're saying something in the mic, but I have everyone muted. I leave to start my daily quests and about ten minutes later, they're dropping a nuke at my camp! Geez, dude. Of course, I server hopped as I'm not about to let my camp get nuked haha.
---
I realized I didn't have pacifist mode on, so now I know haha.
---
PA is cool as fuck. That's why.
---
You have no idea how long I was looking for those the other day. Eventually just went through everything one item at a time scrolling through all variants and when I found them I just couldn't figure out why they were there of all places
---
That's very cute.
---
Saw a guy block the ghouls with power armor and he just chilled and i gathered ore while over encumbered but we somehow completed it
---
There are all fair criticisms.
---
Even before the pandemic, Bethesda's rate of output with this game was best described as lethargic.  I think they've put too much emphasis on releasing major expansions after several months of minimal additions, rather than having a steady infusion of smaller events (or equally valid, tweaking existing ones so they are more fun).  They need a better balance.
---
It's rather self-defeating how they stretch mediocre content too far (like the faction dailies), while simultaneously pushing the player to get through the meaty new main quest as quickly as possible (so they can start collecting Bullion for the new grind).  This really didn't make sense.  I would have much rather taken my time with the main quest, rather than speed through it because of fear-of-missing-out.
---
Ultimately, they want players to log in every day, but not stick around for hours and hours.  Their design reflects that, and it's ultimately not great for the players.  One wonders how many they manage to retain versus those who drop off out of boredom.
---
Super rare ? Nah more like ultra secret rare, you ever find one of these ? Go buy a lottery ticket.
---
Cries in heavy gun build
---
Cries in only being able to craft 21 .308 ammo at once
---
Cries in .50 cal chewing through steel when crafting
---
They’re not always going to spawn but i promise you if you keep checking and sever hopping it won’t take you too long to get the full set. You can also get the wetsuit and tactical helmet plans there.
---
Oh I didn't know it was THAT rare lol.
---
Ty so much
---
Everyone talks about end game. What was the end game of FO4?  That game really got boring once you blow up the institute. Sure there are mods but on console those only go so far
---
Doesn't matter which floor it is, it all looks like it's been greased and waxed.
---
I'm just gonna (reaches over and grabs) borrow this real quick. Thanks
---
If you haven’t finished the quest that you got it for it reverts to the original quest item state when you log on again
---
I haven’t checked TD2’s seasons but I did play it for a lot of hours and it was solid fun, I may check it out again since I haven’t done any endgame after the main story. I really want Fallout 76 to be better, there’s a really solid base (aside from bugs and features).
---
When you launch a nuke, that's where the default target starts. Generally people move it elsewhere. That area is probably pretty good for irradiated plants.
---
Well looks like I am going to go learn a bunch of plans and maybe a video or 2 just so I can fully understand what I am doing thank you for the information
---
There is a spot near the Palace of the winding path with a skeleton next to a gramophone.  Need to set this up near it.
---
Can you not use a terminal to switch them off? First use them to kill everything then switch them off so you can clear up the leftovers?
---
Oh, and you just need ranks in Home Defense (Agility, unlocks at lvl 22) to build most of these - don’t need to buy/learn plans :)
---
In my opinion Survival mode should come back the same way it did on day 1. The stakes were higher, the risks were higher and that's what made it so much fun in the first place. Knowing that your base could be wiped out without you knowing, loosing double caps (back when it was based on your level) and aid items, and that you had to be extremely careful where you fast travel. That was insanely fun. Almost felt like playing Rust.
---
Which Flux is in that area?
---
It sucks, because I really want to spend more time in it but I can’t, I just can’t find anything else to do besides the dailies just for the atoms and maybe polishing my camp or trying a new design but that wears off in less than an hour. I want my endless Fallout 4 nights in 76. They should really rethink the way they deliver content and the amount of content, I felt I’ve seen everything and done everything after the main quests and side quests.
---
I hate it when people try to involve their camps in SBQ, or worse on the other side of Fort Defiance to capitalize on Line in the Sand.  Inevitably the dude is up hunting radstags at hemlock holes instead of participating.
---
Ive had to switch them on in like 5 places. Im going to try that this run through. Tedious bs for a solo player.
---
Oh, I’m level 218 right now. With 206 hours
---
 It’s also 4 caps to fast travel to camp venture, which has at least 6 spawn points for plans, and a few more for mods. Not necessarily marine armor though.
---
I'm creeping up on 2300 hrs and the wife is close to 3k since beta.  We play side by side, from the couch.  We spend most of our game time just plain goofing off as well as helping newer players learn about the game. 
---
My wife is immunocompromised and this is how we socially interact with our friends since way before the Covid-19 quarantine and will be for long after.  It's pretty much the only MMO that doesn't make her nauseated within minutes of playing due to various camera &amp; lighting techniques used in other games, GTAV for example).
---
There’s loads of open area with crops growing, can’t remember off the top of my head
---
Feel your pain. I had to be quick swapping my perks around to unlock them etc lol but was worth it in the end. Good luck 👍
---
What about just adding the CE Magnum? That is easily outclass any .44!
---
I bet she talked about her headache the entire time ..... liv the ones that talk during sex dont you?
---
   Also just realized he was a trader , look at it this way , she might have just been trying to earn her keep for the camp in your relationship since she has no caps ....
---
Gotcha. What was the event/is it repeatable? Can you tell I need this?
---
Vendor hop, forget if I’ve been to someone’s camp so I travel there again multiple times.
---
Do events that pop up.
---
Raid all the gyms in the game for lead so I don’t have to go through lucky hole mine again yet.
---
Vendor hop again.
---
See someone way out in the wilderness obviously at their camp with their vendors turned off so o go out there and try to sneak in...not to buy anything, just because.  It’s good fun to sneak past them when they heard footsteps and are looking for you...always go play an instrument or sleep in their bed.
---
Some serious salt in here today.
---
Gauss minigun is a heavy weapon, adjust your build to be heavy gun focused, power armor is also nice and allows you to use the (IMO) best heavy gun perk stabilized
---
The gatling gun doesn't have a lot of mods either, but yeah. The guns that are since launch need a revamp  ASAP
---
Hmm did not know that thank you
---
Meanwhile shotguns and rifles have like 40 mods lol
---
I still love the game. I’m almost 170 and I have fun playing a couple hours a day. I hadn’t played for almost a year before Wastelanders. I hadn’t reflected about quitting /starting, but I obviously stopped for some reason a year ago. I think I was pretty casual about the game last year: no “build,” no vending, random legendaries, never nuked. Now I’m deeper into the Wasteland. I’ll probably get bored and cycle through some other titles, but that’s not Fallout 76’s fault; that’s the nature of all media.
---
Theres a quest? Ok thanks.
---
Fallout 4 wasn’t a service style game and yet it had a ton of quests after the main quest and the settlements were wonderful, 76 is a service game and is just not offering anything besides repeat this and grind the boring dailies, the main story + side quests is not enough for a Fallout game. Give me more lore, stories, quests, I don’t know, make me spend hours in it and don’t kick me out after 30 minutes of doing everything there is to do in the day.
---
I have a camp set up as a Fasnacht themed bar, and I’d like to travel around with it, but I’ve built some of my stuff into the landscape and I’m not sure how it would travel. Might give me something to work on!
---
I've spun around countless times trying just to figure out which direction the sound was coming from and have had no luck. I just thought my sound was off.
---
Is it weird that the heavy barrel for the .50 is I think the lighter air cooled barrel used on airplanes while the default barrel was the heavier barrel used on the ground?
---
I like it, lol! Have you seen the orgonoal commercial
---
Idk if you noticed the part where I said "after looking..." it means I did a quick search and the top few posts I found had that price range. I didnt personally know what the price was and honestly I dont give a shit lol. That outfit is literally worthless to me. Value is subjective, smart and experienced people understand that.  I would never trade any of my best gear or favorite outfits for some dress. Only an idiot would. Especially one that I could just get for free with enough server hopping. Lmao, imagine believing that a fictional pixelated item has that much value, and that thinking that way somehow makes your superior to those who don't. 
---
Did it make you feel so proud to be the "actually" guy in a post over a day old? Especially when OP already got their answer. That's the most pathetic thing I've ever seen in the year I've had this account lol
---
Edit: it makes your comment even more sad when you can clearly look and see that someone else already pointed out the current value of the outfit. And they did it without being a condescending dick.
---
Cheers, I’ve completed everything in the game (mission wise) so just looking for things to do lol
---
Offline raiding sucks if you can't log in every night
---
The vendor glitch is back so beth has probably stopped sales again.

---
True, shotguns and rifles are the bread and butter of this game. Idk, i think a little more variety is necesary, not only in the mod department but also in the weapons themselves
---
ah, wonderful
---
Getting banned for killing the CS manager because Bethesda is corrupt.
---
If you wanna compare it to the launch, it’s a 1000x better. Most of the glitches are bearable, with the biggest issue truthfully being the endgame
---
2300 hours? That’s a lot of goofing around lol. It’s fun I love helping new players I even made a whole camp for one player that casually stepped into my camp so it was fun times. Unfortunately my wife just doesn’t like games at all so I play solo and fallout games are my perfect cup of tea and still I can’t find a reason to come back and goof around for more than an hour or less daily.
---
Yeah I know right, heavy guns need some love too.
---
The sooner you find our missing equipment the better.
---
I love Wasteland garage saling for the same reason I love real garbage sales. Get to check out people's digs while checking out their bargains.
---
I wear power armor cause I like it. It is clearly worse in some aspects but I will not stop wearing it because of it. I like it, I just wish it was had some benefit other than pure DR.
---
PA should be the best, it's not, it's just easy.  And you still get rads, disease and poisoned in it, which is kinda dumb.
---
Wair are you still on there?
---
Thats good to hear, but at this point is it worth $40?
---
sure thing bro:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19b1SpZTTRk&amp;t=8s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19b1SpZTTRk&amp;t=8s)
---
Redbox it and give it a try. Depending on who you ask here it's hit or miss. I myself am a day 1 Fallout 76 player and have enjoyed the game bugs or no bugs. The way I look at it is, there is no game that is ever perfect on release and is never brought to perfect. The community alone is great in this game.
---
Thank you!!
---
Heh, the burrows. Yeah a real 4 man difficulty dungeon... that can do semi-afk, solo, with a butter knife, and zero stimpacks... naked.
---
Thank you for this, very helpful!
---
I think all weapons need to scale. In fallout 4 you start with pipe guns and then you start finding more and more "modern" weapons. This needs something like that but for every weapon
---
I'm on the Xbox and have no problem, what platform are you on?
---
Redbox has games?
---
Joe's spawns Raiders vs Settlers a decent bit too. You have to kill the settlers but I've never gotten rep loss from it
---
Yeah, okay. I have 5 sets, right now. (Excavator, Raider, T-45, T-51 and T-60). But I just like having all the power armor sets once I get them.
---
I only just discovered I could rename each of my power armor chasses a few weeks ago. It was a pain trying to find the set I was looking for until then.
---
Not anymore. They’re stoping this year.
---
Yes i just went in again and took out a few turrets. This run should do it. Not wasting stims anymore lol.
---
Want me join and help you?
---
It looks like you've got all the right mods to it power armor is definitely a help with stabilized perk card however it will eat through some ammo I suggest you save it for critical battles.
---
If you have a PS4 it’s on sale rn.
---
Disable enlighten in the custom ini or mess with these enlighten settings

I got my 1500 atoms back for the log cabin bundle and kept the bundle, submit a ticket with date you got item, name of it, how much it cost in atoms and platform, say its bugged.
---
Thanks, I'll try that if I can get out from under my camp.
---
Agreed. The .50 HMG needs a few more mod's added, such as a Muzzle Brake, an Armor Piercing Magazine, and a Spider Sight.
---
I believe so. I don't myself, but a quick Google search and it seems it does.
---
Sorry chief, Xbox. And since your a ps4 owner, what do you think about the ps5?
---
I want more options for commando/rifleman players. I mean a legendary handmade or fixer is all we have right now for practical end game guns. Maybe the Service rifle?
---
Dolby
---
No prob but keep in mind the pieces you want may never be bundled as a pack. Theres no way of knowing one way or the other
---
PC, Steam.
---
So is it just the gauss or all semi auto rifles? Doesn’t hit at all or just miss the first shot? I’ve been using commando and haven’t felt much different than months ago. But I read lots of complaints about gauss now.
---
I cracked up at the thought of this position in real life.
---
right?  That's either 5.0 or 1.4.
---
Not for 40 bucks. Maybe like 25 at most.
---
okay I really asked my question more so that your platform would be available for others to see perhaps they can direct you.
---
I’m not super into specs and stuff like that, I just prefer the general layout of PS consoles and controllers fit my hands better than the Xbox controllers. Also I’m a huge fan of most PS exclusives. So I like that we’re getting a second Spider-Man, but even if the Xbox is faster or whatever I’m still going ps5.
---
In a way, that kind of makes our character even more of a badass. Due to their pip-boy  getting in the way of proper bow wielding, they say "fuck it" and reverse wield the bow, not wasting a second to complain and instead grit their teeth and adapt to their weird bow-problem. It's like having a sword break, but instead of panic they flip it around to use it like a dagger.
---
Wolfgangsta702 on xbox i can wait
---
did you mean a new atom shop exclusive skin only available in a limited time bundle?
---
Would this gun work well against SBQ? 
---
I love using the furious handmade I’ve got but I’ve everything in the game so was going to have a mess about with my build as I never really paid too much attention to it.  Ideally I’d like to use both this minigun and the handmade but think that might be difficult.
---
So you actually have a top to your head and still play fallout 76? I lost mine a long time ago.
---
Thats really cool that you don't really care, I don't think consoles should compete. And ps exclusives are ten times better, but I was asking about the design
---
No, can't say I did lol sure that's what we will get...
---
Only you can say if it’s worth it.  
---
There’s way more than 40 hours of game play. If all you played was 40 hours would $1 an hour be worth it?
---
Interesting perspective. I find there to be way more to do in 76 after all of the main and side quests than in FO4. Have you done all of the side quests in 76? All of the sheepsquatch quests? Do you have all of your possum badges? Have you looked into researching that weird alien writing that came with wastelanders? Have you don’t the pawn shop hidden quest? How many DOME keys do you have? There is A LOT of hidden content people are still discovering.
---
Yes, I find it more effective against her once her health begins to drop probably after the second or third landing you can really bring her down. To bring her down with justice gone alone from the beginning would probably cost you about 4,000 rounds depending upon your build.
---
lol, made an alt account to join a failing brigade.
---
NW is pvp  you know?  and they are nipping the future grief problem before it begins
---
As long as it fits on my tv stand I don’t really have an opinion. I hope I can lay it horizontal though. I’m not a fan of the vertical console look.
---
LDOOs, Lap dances of opportunity.
---
I'd love to see Gauss weapons for commando types. An SMG would be fun... as long as it can be **suppressed**.
---
Should be joining your sever hopefully rn
---
Hey now, this isn't Fallout 2
---
I think the INT bonus caps somewhere in the 20s.
---
I try to build craft a lot in this game, and I make use of the build planners online to create good builds oriented for playing any aspect of the game, using any weapon (No, a pure explosives build isn’t viable at all)
---
When I’m not doing that, I’m usually hopping player vendors and doing trading so I can get more weapons for my Anti Armor Collection, or ganking players at workshops.
---
For future reference you can use [Mapalachia]( https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Mappalachia).
---
Use the gallery and scroll to find the flux you are looking for.
---
Yess please... the shotgun should have a supressor as well
---
I kept mine locked most of the time until I figured out how to put power connectors through the walls.  Now I just have a single locked room with switches that operate the power grids for my garage doors and vending machines.  Now I can leave it unlocked for people to explore and no one can mess with the power unless they're willing to lockpick that room.
---
:0 I didn't know that, awesome
---
Level 95 I encountered it in the cranberry bog all alone on my bloodied stealth sniper. I was almost able to kill it but it hit me with a projectile shot through a tree and respawned me at vault 76. When I went back it was gone. It mutated and had like 20% health left.....
---
First and only time fighting the thing.
---
Awesome just chilling at the storage area waiting to go further.
---
Ghost
---
That is great, thank you!
---
Lol.
---
Either your build isn’t great, your aim sucks, or both.
---
So to answer the question, no, the bug isn’t back.
---
Which silo are you at?
---
Yeah, it’s a random encounter. Probably one of the better ones because you can kill the opossum(s) they are targeting, talk to them to get rep, then kill another, talk to them again, get more rep, and repeat.
---
Unfortunately, I agree...forcing group play will lose a portion of the player base. I would not continue. Same reasons I left GTA online. Forced me to do content in groups, (heist, contact missions).  I am a fan of single player content. As an older gentleman, a gamer who plays solo for the last 4 decades.
---
I can sell
---
Wow really. Suppose I’ve got nothing else to do so could keep crafting ammo lol I’ve got a furious Gatling laser which I currently use for SBQ but up for a change.
---
Im in bravo btw
---
Can survive naked just fine in nuke zones with enough drugs.  PA is still much better than a hazmat suit.
---
Best way to find all four containers is to not open the gate after taking out the captain.
---
You sure?
---
Did you sub from Steam, or on the Beth launcher? I didn’t realize when I first subbed under the Beth launcher that it wouldn’t be available on the Steam version and vice versa. That’s all I can think of.
---
You'll probably still want to hold on to that one.
---
Yup. Absolutely. I use the Gauss Shotgun on my main toon and I love it as it is, however, it would be even better if there were an optional mod to suppress it.
---
So u link me to a guy who pves and happens to make a pvp video. If u dont actually pvp u dont get a right to talk
---
Bravo
---
I don't really understand how they determine what mobs are what level when you start a private server, tbh. All I can say is that was my experience.
---
What system are you on?
---
I subbed through Steam and It even shows in my Steam Acc. settings that I have the sub.
---
I don't like it, personally. The gauss shotgun is a way better use of 2mm. It's a queen killer, sure, but I can't say I use mine for much else. Even with super duper+ammosmith it just consumes too much.
---
It seems to lock everybody out after a certain amount of time. I guess that's to prevent any unpleasurable experiences.
---
Coming down the elevators, I ll start making my way to you as soon as I cam
---
25-50k caps hahaha experienced in fallout 76 ? Not even close, good to see someone else with actual experience in trading corrected your ignorance when you initially replied to OP. You're bad at the game and it shows.
---
Because you lose a bunch of special points while using it if you are wearing unyielding armor normally, and it consumes fusion cores unlike for example SS armor which can use a JP like PA but doesn't need cores.  However, the damage reduction (not damage resistance) is great in PA and any set of it offers superior protection, especially in nuke zones.  The targeting helmet is a bonus as well.  I am normally a bloodied build with SS Uny armor, but I prefer a protocoled PA in nuke zones, mainly because it offers superior protection and my damage output is high enough to negate any special stats that I might lose by wearing it.  With the right perks and buffs, I can sit at 19% health (my preferred nerd rage level) and tank damage all day without losing a single point of health unless I get bombarded by poison/DOT.  Alternatively, SS armor does fine if you down some radshield and use glowing blood packs.  I do take more damage in nuke zones without PA though.
---
I hate it.
---
It’s too slow to switch enemies.  Much faster to just exit and enter VATS again.
---
don't join a team :)
---
Most of the people trading the presents aren't the ones who made them. All Bethesda needs to do is make presents weigh 1 pound each and remove the caps.
---
I am frustrated, but if people who don’t know what they’re doing see this and can be informed. That’ll make my day
---
yeah, lets just tell 95% of the playerbase to completely ignore a very requested group finding feature, in a PvE based series... 200iq right here /s
---
Nuking white springs is  okay place for that. In the main garden at the front door towards the rear of it (the garden) you will find about 47 plants with green thumb perk card.
---
Think of it like a child. It's always hungry and you're going to have to work to keep it fed.
---
Angry Turtle made a video on [ammo mats] (https://youtu.be/XxFu4SnTb8c?t=7) farming.
---
And I agree with /u/StoneRevolver's comment.
---
Seeing some great comments and thought I'd add this: if you haven't unlocked the ultracite 2mm EC already (Gauss rifle Prime Receiver) then you won't be able to craft ultracite ammo for the MG. Currently buying the prime receiver for the Gauss MG does not unlock the ammo crafting for it (it's a bug).
---
In the maintenance office.
---
[deleted]
---
What ever it’s takes! It’s getting ridiculous but they are accomplices!
---
In the reactor room rn
---
don't join random teams
---
you don't understand the "teamfinder" concept do you?
---
how about an actually good suggestion, like a "pvp" team that has the whole team flagged for pvp?
---
Perhaps someone can paint the armor for you. The only pev  about it is there are so many different skins in the atomic shop eventually you're going to want to change it anyway.
---
Not terribly long. 1/2 hour maybe less, but I never really timed it.  I'll time myself doing a silo and let you know.  With the stealth I don't need to kill nearly as much as I would other wise.  I slip in, get the card, get the measurements, fabricate the card, then it's off to the reactor from there.  I fix the reactor, break and the fix the appropriate mainframes, then into the control room for launch.  I take out the turrets so all I have to do is run herd on missile prep. with all the bots up and running that goes quick.  After that launch and run.
---
Test one
---
Should be cleared out
---
My internet is down. I'm at a starbucks just to post here :/
---
Yes. I’m a big fan of Fallout and an even bigger fan of Elder Scrolls, but even so, based on all the horror stories I had heard about the game, I told myself I wouldn’t pay more than $25 for it. 
---
Found it on sale for $23 back in April and scooped it up. 
---
Now I’m 180 hours in and counting. It’s one of only a handful of games I’ve put this much time into. 
---
In hindsight I think the game is worth well more than $25. $40 is worth it, maybe even $60 for as much enjoyment as I’ve gotten out of this charmingly buggy piece of software. Think of it in terms of dollars per hour of gameplay. I’ve been paying about 13 cents per hour to play this game so far, which is totally a fair price imo.
---
To be fair, most of those are legacy OP Gatling Plasmas that do 100% Explosion damage instead of the 20% that other explosive weapons now do.  Explosive damage does very little to the queen though.  I don't see many people rocking Non-exp POS lasers and plasmas at scorched earth.
---
Right away does affect the mutations for about 20 minutes.
---
your fine. Lets hope bethesda patches it soon!
---
Rad x suppresses mutations that long. Rad away just increases disease chance
---
The gauss eats though ammo like crazy! That being said, it’s fun as hell! Definitely get the prime capacitor as ultrasite 2mm can be made much more efficiently than the regular ammo. (Ammo Smith and supper duper are your best friends)
---
I do carry two gauss minis too. The other one uses regular 2mm just incase. 
---
And don’t forget to equip demolition expert, as there is an explosive effect on the 2mm.
---
PvP failed, the overwhelming majority don’t want or don’t care.
---
you can get killed if you join random team
---
There is usually a ton of goofing around when we play.    We even make up little games sometimes, like a Nukashine relay race.
---
Ok
---
I've mostly played this game to extend my fo4 settlement building fun. It's *all* about perfecting my various characters' C.A.M.P.S. 
---
3 out of five of my characters have completelyv used up budget permanent immobile campsites.
---
I take pride in them and heart emotes sustain me.
---
I also enjoy the budgetary restraint (to an extent). Striking the perfect balance of decoration to structure is a lot fun for me.
---
You're correct. Energy weapons do suck and people do use Gatling Laser for SBQ. Why? Cores from power plants are free ammo. Why waste 1,000+ crafted rounds on a boss fight that'll probably drop a one star Nocturnal Rolling Pin? Plus, it's easy to tag everything for experience, but hard to kill things so quickly nobody else gets experience.
---
You still get some for both factions so it isn't all that bad.  It's nice to get a big bump with whatever faction you want the plans from but as long as you do the dailies for each they will both unlock around the same time even with the bump in rep.
---
Worst option is keeping all the gold for yourself.  You get a little over 2 days of bullion in exchange for a week or two of grinding out rep.
---
Pipes were optional but well done lol
---
Yeah I hate this. Almost every floor I bought besides mosaic tiles does this. The latest black tile one they released is horrible. You can’t even see the pattern unless you look straight down.
---
lol not for long, amazing change when it drops.  less stuff for griefers to abuse
---
I think it’d be nice easier to make an alt since you get so much xp from the main missions. That’s what I did this past double xp weekend
---
well some of us have fun with it
---
Just keep server hopping at Slowcum Joe’s. Filled half bar in three to four days while i was doing Fasnacht. It’s the fastest spot, no need to travel around the map look for encounters.
---
This and Power User. Doubles ammo capacity. Gatling Lasers are garbage, but ideal for SBQ. Free ammo, high rate of fire, low damage, and high capacity. Easily tag everything, without one shotting anything.
---
Maintenance office btw is where im at
---
How about any or all vintage weapons from older Fallout games?..
---
Okie, could you join my team? There some kind of invisiabke wall at the mainframes
---
I hope so my friend, I hope so. Have a great day.
---
It worked for the the second time. Sorry for the late reply hope you finished the qeust
---
Really? I never seem to have that problem.  I sell chems and cooked food to vendor. Super easy
---
Such is the way of Bethesda games.
---
MedX and Old Possum didn't seem to fix it, either.
---
Well, of course.  The issue is that the “some” isn’t enough to warrant the investment in PVP.  People barely touch the existing PVP options, why invest the money? On the off chance you might draw in a few more players? You’re better off just focusing on the PVE side of things.
---
Lol  I totally understand.  It was quite a few levels later until I decided to try it again.  It definitely puts the assault in assaultron haha.  If you and your hubby are on ps4, my buddies and I have started to run them somewhat regularly when we have caps for keycards if you guys want to join in and get it figured out.
---
the thing with p/a is that if you have armor with deep pockets and a 3rd star 20% ammo/junk/weapons/food, drink &amp; chems weight reduction (x5 arms, legs, body) you get over encumbered every time you use p/a, so you only take it out to do an event, then take it off so you can fast travel after the event.
---
I agree, they should lower the limits. Good suggestion.
---
Edit: ;-)
---
Have you seen a time for when beth will be on. Went to the official schedule and it had no time listed. Contldnt track down any other info.
---
Many legacy energy weapons had explosives. Most beta players still around have explosive energy weapons. They were "temporarily" removed from the drop tables over a year ago. But they were never added back. Though the ones that survived have been duped to hell and back. My bloodied explosive laser has been my main weapon for a long time now. they just need to add it back. Explosive energy weapons makes more sense than having a gun that magically makes all your normal ammo explode.
---
Should be able now
---
There is some kind of invisible barrier I can not pass
---
I agree with the above comments about the shotgun, but some arguments for the minigun: primed receiver does terrific damage, the range of the standard barrel is incredible (though the triple barrel is probably best), and it's a fun gun to play with.
---
This reminds me of that old Dolby digital ad
---
why not have more players and work on pvp and pve
---
The wedges only like being attached to a ceiling afaik
---
yeah most of the crap ammo weigh 0 with bandolier on. so it's just free .50 for me lol
---
lever action shotgun!!
---
They only snap to slanted roof
---
PC, IGN: MrBright01
---
EDIT: To be clear... each of my CAMPS have a game. If you ever see my camp in a new area, means that character was relocated and the game remade.
---
Honestly all o want is for there to be a separate game mode just like Adventure, except for pvp focused like the game was when it first came out. I enjoyed having to always be on gaurd. That way people who wanna play pve can play Adventure, and people that like more pvp could play that. Everyone gets to play the way they want
---
yeah
---
I'm on Steam and I'm seeing my sub.
---
Maybe try "verify integrity of game files" under the local tab in Fallout 76 properties.
---
If that doesn't work I'm not sure what else to suggest.
---
That. Is. Infuriating....
---
Thanks for telling me though.
---
Tried it but I’ll give it another go.
---
Apologies for potato quality but I just went there and marine arm plans were there https://imgur.com/a/owm1SpY so just hop and keep checking my dude. 
---
If you’re on Xbox send me a private message and I’ll give you this one I just found
---
Same, will have to remember this next time my Gatling Plasma craps out halfway through SBQ!
---
I think they could add the central marketplace to the terminal in your camp. (a good reason to get one since they're pretty much useless right now).
---
And, yeah, it would need to have a search function with sorting and categories of items (weapons, armor, etc.).
---
Players would not need to use the terminal if they wanted to just go to a user's vending machine. Even that could show either local goods or the whole marketplace.  They wouldn't need multiple vending machines if they had more than 15 items, either (another artificial limit).

Players who want the "global" marketplace could use that. But players that don't want it can specify that their goods not be listed there, too. I can't really see why they wouldn't want their stuff listed there unless it's the social aspect (most players ignore me when I go by their camp to see their vending machine(s), now)
---
I'd love to be able to look at all the players' goods at once when I'm looking for something specific. And competition for prices on many things would bring some of the more outlandish prices down.
---
They could even add an "opt-in" or "opt-out" button on a player's vending machine when he/she goes to put items in their vending machine.
---
One other thing I'd like to see. If you put 100 shotgun shells in your vending machine and then add another 100 the next day, it should add them to the same listing. As it is,now, they don't aggregate even though it's the same item at the same price. You have to remove the previous listing then post them all in one listing. 
---
The prices the bot vendors charge are very high. And they pay practically nothing for stuff you sell them. So, maxing the price for something at the price the bots sell that item at isn't much of a limit. But it should stop people from listing things like shotgun shells at 50 caps each so they're sure no one will buy them (and thus they'll stay there until they de-list the item). That is how someone would "game" the system and use the marketplace as an extension of their stash. Having the items taken from your stash when you list it would make people more likely to list stuff they don't need or want and "should" make those items reasonably priced for those that want them. I'm just not sure Bethesda actually wants a working in-game economy, though. Some people seem to think that post-apocalypse there would be no trading. But people would still congregate in settlements for safety and to enable trade (specialization requires trade and specialization is how civilization would reboot). So, I think a central marketplace would happen IRL post apocalypse. It might take a few years. But this is 26 years after the  bombs. And there clearly are settlements. So, a trading post (marketplace) is a foregone conclusion.
---
They would be in a dead heat for bugs, maybe.
---
Complain to bethesda, it's their shitty mechanics.
---
Awesome I'll get back on tonight and take a look.I have 1st so maybe it's best to search for it on a private server so no one else grabs it.
---
Well dang. Not sure why it's not seeing your sub. Good luck on figuring it out. I wish I could be of more help.
---
This is from a old commercial I believe lol. It was a guy sitting in front of a radio and getting blasted by the sound system. I could be wrong as I’m lazy and haven’t read the comments.
---
Edit: I was way off lmao 😂
---
Oooooooh I’m not really that good with sound setups but still cool
---
I completely agree, I do so many events that I basically get double the amount of treasury notes that you can turn in per day. I’m sitting on 800+ treasury notes right now.
---
Not enough return on investment.  If you have 90% that only want to do Solo/Co-op PVE Content, and 10% that wants to do PVP, it still won‘t make sense to create more PVP content, even if it brought the 10% up to 15%, because you still are creating content for a very small group, not to mention the recurring costs of maintaining it.
---
No, not at this time. The different bundles say what they each include
---
have a pvp sever
---
You learn something new every day
---
maybe a light barrel, a sight mod, some different receivers and maybe some ammo box mods.
---
LMG needs mods as well
---
I had to stop using the Facebook groups.  Everyone is either a duper or they celebrate dupers like they are rock stars.  I'm not stupid I know I have bought and traded stuff that fell out of a display case but dont be so in your face about it.
---
Lmao that's what I been working towards i got a bloodied gauntlet randomly after making it, and now I love bloodied started changing perks etc lol so hopefully I can get that set one day
---
half roofs
---
I’ve got a full set of Vanguards but I’m a bloodied player. Too bad we can’t trade!
---
Stacking bobbleheads.
---
why Spend money on a server the majority Won’t use?
---
Darn I had better plans for them in this position for a different project
---
as a freshly converted commando, sign me up!  10mm smg was my first auto i ran with and i would love to have similar with a gauss
---
Just sold and bought from vendors all night.
---
One should be able to trade this thing with other players who also have learned the plans! Or set a gold-related vendor
---
Doesn’t even need to be gaussed. Let me suppress my bloodied explosive smg!
---
As a full health build i feel your pain. Sick of getting bloodied weapons. 😐
---
Yikes. Desperate attempts to insult me, makes your whole situation even more pathetic. 
---
You still ignored the part where I said that price range from a quick google search. I dont trade player to player, it's not my thing. But that has absolutely nothing to do with skill at a video game lol. Its complete idiotic to think that it does. Is that really the best you can do? Repeating your comment twice in a row and claiming at bad at the game? 
---
I'm pretty sure you're the one who's bad at this game. And it shows, along with your enormous narcissism. I pity you, the only joy in life you seem to have is trying to be a dick to strangers in the internet. What a sad life.
---
why not have all the players in the game like where it is at
---
You got the codes right?
---
A level one what
---
Anything that was stackable could be duped not too long ago.  A fair amount of plans came from Christmas presents and those were heavily duped.
---
Yeah, so did I. It's rather frustrating.
---
Honestly I don't have a problem with frog legs personally but some do think it's op so I edited it in the post for them. I understand players don't really need it but I find it to be a very useful utility perk. Sure you can jump higher during a gunfight but it's not like it increases your damage or makes you tankier.
---
This. It's hundreds and hundreds of levels and doesn't take much time to do. Though it is mostly pointless and super obvious that you've abused it a bunch at 3k.
---
Well, it's the thought that counts, right? :D
---
For the same reason I already said: there’s not enough of them to warrant the investment. The cost of maintaining the extra data load just won’t be recovered compared to creating more PVE content
---
A word of warning, if you have multiple of one type of weapon, the game has a habit of equipping a random one. Like last night I used a repair kit on my TSE Fixer in the hotwheel, but it selected my AA Fixer that wasn't favorited and repaired that instead.
---
doesn't work though right? i'll take a peek next time i log on.
---
And you as well.
---
With diminishing returns for DR, and SS armor putting you really close you may want to hold onto a good life saving, chameleon, or even mutants piece.
---
I would make anew character. My story is similar. I went strength for melee played melee then thought id do heavy guns.  But then decided to do a sneak rifle build so thats vastly different as most of my str will need to  diverted to perception. In the end i made a new character. As i got to see the main story again and now i have a high str shotgunner character and a high perception rifle character. Also if you have a friend or fallout 1st you will be able to trade items between characters easily.
---
When you scrap a weapon, you are supposed to get half the resources used to build it back (yea, right...screws anyone?). But if we got back half resources on ammo...I could stop farming lead and acid.
---
What does it show for your next billing date? I'm going to guess today. 
---
There's some kind of screw-up between the Steam sub and Bethesda's account system where Steam doesn't think it's time to charge you yet, but Bethesda thinks your sub has expired. The fix is just to cancel the sub in Steam and then immediately resubscribe. You don't lose anything, because Steam still won't bill you until after the present sub time has expired, but something in there flips a switch on the Bethesda side that gets you working again.
---
Tomorrow, June 18th.
---
How do you trade between fallout 1st characters?
---
why get rid of it leave it where it is
---
I will say though, if the limits weren't in place, I'd have been completely done with nothing at all to do quite awhile ago. Sadly, I'm already bored... At this point their is no content difficult enough to warrant me improving my gear so it would just be more stats for the sake of more stats.
---
Hoping for something new and interesting... Diablo 3 style rifts would be nice.
---
A good roll on a combat rifle is a very useable endgame rifle. Honestly on the proper build almost any weapon is useable.
---
Canceling and re-subbing worked. Didn’t know if it would charge me or not. Thanks!
---
Because it costs money to leave it. Maintaining servers isn’t free
---
You probably figured out that I am new
---
No eta
---
Thank you thank you thank you.
---
It doesn't, because Steam still thinks you have time on the sub (hence the billing date of tomorrow). It doesn't delete your remaining time when you cancel; it just cancels the auto-bill for the next cycle.
---
Is it actually 0?
---
Good thing to note for future issues, weird bug from Bethesda as per usual.
---
? Don’t they just give you buffs?
---
if they have money now it will be fine
---
I’ll trade it or give you caps for it gladly! If you’re on Xbox that is lol
---
Yeah I looked and didn't see it listed but they are famous for being sketchy mofos
---
It could have rendered in the wall. Try shooting the area with an explosive weapon and see if it flies up in the air.
---
Why lose money?
---
Edit: Sorry I missed the Xbox tag, I totally spaced....
---
The same thing about the PNP router setting is important.
---
So is the possibility of following someone in using the Microsoft network thing where you can join someone's game explicitlythrough the power of friendship rather than through the games inherent matchup capabilities.
---
All the same issues and questions are in force. The fact that you end up having the same server and the same outgoing attempted port in your router from the two Xboxes can make a routers life difficult if the servers don't have a way to announce the alternate porting.
---
That's what the PNP stuff is for. It lets the client know to tell the server to use a different port on the public side.
---
basically the first person to connect is probably receiving all of the return packets for both clients if the client doesn't know how to specify use of an alternate port via learning the link via setting it up via PNP. It's chain of custody thing.
---
... End Edit ...
---
If you're on PS4 you might be able to end around the problem.
---
One of you can go into the private server and then the other one can find them in the PS4 friend menu and follow them that way instead of just trying to join the server.
---
I don't know if you can do that same thing through PC or Xbox.
---
Second question, can you both end up on the same server if you're not using the private server?
---
I asked that second question because it could be a NAT problem if you're both in the same house. That is your router could be crossing up the fact that you've got two hosts trying to leave the gateway using the same port etcetera.
---
If the network settings for your game let you override the port selection for the game, changing one of those clients to use a different port than the default might solve your problem.
---
Since I don't actually have the PC version of the game I can't tell you for sure if this is possible to do with the PC version.
---
If your router has the option to enable plug and play (PNP) Make sure that that's on. That can let the the games and the router figure out if there's overlapping problems and do some special port mapping.
---
Again I'm assuming you're working from the same house off the same router etc.
---
why lose players
---
It's been going on since the Steam release. Happened to me, my dad, and several others I know. It's been reported to Bethesda but that doesn't mean much. They are the only company I've ever seen have issues integrating with Steam's billing platform, at least in recent years.
---

Wow

I didn’t think there would be considering, but it doesn’t surprise me. It’s Bethesda.
---
Why worry about losing the minority?

She came to a faschnat parade with me. I had her dressed up in a nuke girl outfit and a jester mask, thought she was another player till I saw her name.
---
It is one of the most interesting elements of the game for me.
---
Very nice design.
---
I’m gonna have to wait till I’m level 650 it would seem, just tried to launch, got to the part where you defend the robots, ran out of stimpacks and almost all my .50 is gone, I’m not good enough by myself
---
your making no points to me
---
Join a private world with one character. Drop items in a suitcase at a train station as an example. Log out and log back in to a private world with a different character and it will log you into the same world you were just on. So if you check that same suitcase you put items in you will see the items with the 2nd character.
---
I am slightly confused, I have been playing since launch, and on this subreddit as well and never once heard anything about power armor being underrated? Or even any complaints about it. But I may have missed something. 
---
Nonetheless I wish you, and everyone all the best!
---
Got stuck overloaded

I'm a crazed camp builder.

Why did Beth have a fairly major NPC constantly sleep and fuck around ya know? He's always in bed. Always. I'd rather a static guy at a desk than trying to find that worthless asshole or wait for him to wake up in a painful, protracted animation where he's clips everything weirdly anyways and talks to me facing the entirely wrong direction....
---
An assault or capture the flag mode would be more fun than nuclear winter.
---
Every single first shot in vats misses. It’s unfortunate because it is a fairly powerful rifle. But if feels useless because of the first shot always missing.
---
I've server hopped a couple times, and it's always missing now. I've got a friend who could get it for me, but I would like to do it myself. It would suck if they just overlooked this while programming the instanced areas in Wastelanders.
---
I'm not even big on PVP but that's a great idea, I'd try it.
---
Why aren’t you understanding that there wouldn’t be enough return on investment by catering to the minority? What business case do you have that would show it would be worth the time and money for the to work on PVP?
---
I found this video which may help. It shows a few caves and a couple of them look pretty good.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE-oBVJe-Vk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE-oBVJe-Vk)
---
The barrel mods aren't even a tactical choice, either. The heavy barrel just does more damage. The only con is a bit more weight (which I think can affect VATS cost, but I don't remember for sure).
---
And it's only a "historic" weapon in the sense that it was first used before WWII. It's not an obsolete weapon; multiple militaries are still using updated variants today.
---
Well, I agree with you at least. Not for the same reason, necessarily. They're just bad for the game. Need to be reworked like they said they would, or just remove them to break the wills of the losers who use them.
---
Someone found a player at 10000+

well if you stack thousands of leader bobbleheads using exploits you get 4k xp (which is the cap) for anything you kill. Same for stacking big gun/small gun/energy bobbleheads basically getting as much damage as you want depending on how many bobbleheads you have

Everything looks moist.

My pet peeve is tied between the ridiculousness that is FO's decisions on what constitutes flat ground right now, and the fact that it rains inside my glass green house.
---
What you talking about there’s ton of end game. Grind for plans, grind for desired legendary weapons, grind for desired legendary armor, grind for caps to buy plans, grind to get bank notes, grind to get gold bullions, grind to unlock all pioneer scout items, grind for levels, and soon grind for legendary perk cards which will take years! So plenty of end game grinds that aren’t fun and will take many years to complete. /s
---
The defaults are fugs, but they aren't shiny. 
---
I bet if Beth put non-shinies in the Atom Shop, they'd make enough to pay for a whole new DLC.
---
Quantum or military
---
For X-01
---
I have a b2525. 38 suppressed pistol and i love it so much .. but man it's hard whittling down a mountain of .38 ammo... I still have like 16k. When that and my 10mm ultracite runs out I'll swap back to gunslinger but it is just so much ammo
---
Just want to mention that repair kits are not the only way to repair stuff, I've seen so many newer players that had no idea you could repair stuff at workbenches. 
---
This is not to imply people are stupid or that OP doesnt know this already. Just a heads up for anyone who didnt already know.
---
Did you check if it was actually there or not?
---
At this point I would say probably everyone has or will, at least unwittingly, acquire something duped or benefit from something duped even if its just caps in circulation
---
I really like how you put that.
---
Oh there’s a 2nd beamoth spawn east of the workshop in cranberry. Glad I was able to show the extra content doubling it ;p. But to be fair map may be large but it’s mostly trash with a few diamonds hidden.
---
Goul
---
Well this is what happens when you rush a DLC, to try and bullshit everyone into comming back to play a half finished game to apiece management and investors. 
---
And this is comming from someone that has put 3600hrs spent $500 CAD on this game to come to the realization that I was a sucker for punishment. 
---
I love this game, I am tired of the half fast, bullshit antics from Bethesda. 
---
If you are going to say you are going to do something, do right, give it your 110% and stick to your word! 
---
Instead it's one bullshit lie after another, and homme don't play like that! 
---
Nonetheless I apologize for my rant, I am just tired of the bullshit! 
---
On another note, I do wish you, and everyone all the best!
---
I had a guy come to my CAMP last night and liked it so much he dropped 5 large presents. I mean, thanks? But I felt so dirty after opening them, I just dropped the  plans. Except the icicles, put those in my machine dirt cheap because someone will be happy.
---
But realized that my coveted Sloth Mount isn't worth shit. Took it down.
---
I hate dupers because they ruin the game, in more ways than just the economy and sever crashing.
---
I carry a set of pa (or 2) on every character. I only use it regularly on 1, heavy / melee.
---
 How about 10 rounds of .38?
---
No because I started a new character after wastelanders and found both paired key cards make sure ur looking in the bathroom on the left behind the stall door
---
our definitions of dramatic differ greatly...
---
Hello.
---
Wait was the explo radium not nerfed?? I thought they did a blanket nerf on all explosive legendary effect items
---
I'd be livid if I got the Santa Crash by earning it. Now when I see one, I just assume it's dupe dirt and cringe for the people displaying them.
---
I have the plan because someone gave it to me. But fuck if I'd ever put it up now.
---
Already datamined as a utility item but appears they gave up on it as it’s been in game files since last year sometime in Jan-March.
---
They can't just remove every single duped item from everyone's inventory. Its not that simple. It would take months of coding to remove every single one of them. Would you rather have no new content for the next 6-8 months while they remove duped stuff? Plus people will find a way to dupe again, and it would all be for nothing
---
Actually last year in Q1 near time of first utility item for seeing daily quests.
---
My camp is extravagant, I am always open for a visit, I don't care what you do, just leave my camp the way you found it. If you are using my camp for what ever reasons, and it being attacked, help defend it. Just common courtesy. 
---
As per work shops, why waste time building something, to lose it after you log out? 
---
I wish you,  and everyone all the best!
---
It's a beast of a heavy weapon, but I dont run it as my regular use weapon simply because of its ammo consumption. It's my tank killer when I need to drop a high health bar quickly. I use a BE90% Gatling Gun as my regular weapon, it goes through ammo so slowly and dishes out more than enough damage for trash mobs. Plus with Bandolier rank 2, 5mm ammo has no weight. I currently wall around with over 100,00 rounds of 5mm and about 40k ultrackte 2mm ec.
---
Oh, I know. I'm getting the bed and billboard
---
Totally. I build camps to decompress. My wife provides bystander guidance and feedback.
---
I have 5 characters, and at any point in time I've got one of them doing a new camp theme. Ive got a theater (now showing ... The Mistress and the Moth complete with snacks at theater prices), a mad scientist house adjacent to a graveyard, a fire station, a mr pebbles themed rest stop (lots of nuka variants for sake) and a raider esque guns-n-grub serving guns and ammo in one vendor and preserved food in the other.
---
Yes. But having played alternatives, they are viable, just require actual effort. It turns FO76 from a "lol I killed everything now I'm bored" shooter to an actual shooter, where you have to do things like take cover and sometimes run like a bitch. It's tough... good thing there is no meaningful death penalty in the game. In a way, I wonder if that was the goal, to make the Mire and Cranberry Bog scary instead of "la la la, loot pinatas everywhere". The goal failed, of course, because of the vast divide between optimal or not, but still.
---
PS4.
---
!remindme 14 days
---
The problem is, I picked it up once before, and used it, which removes it from your inventory, but I messed up. Now, no matter how many times I server hop, I can't seem to get ANOTHER of this card. The second card from Tanagra Town respawns perfectly. I already have another of that card, it's just this one that I can't get back.
---
I'm surprised you fix the reactor instead of using the shortcut.

I'm slightly confused how he has no cool down thought it was like any other daily can only be done once a day?
---
I saw someone with a camp like that on the PC. They had actual streets, bunches of tiny houses with three or four items each, which was more than enough. Only big thing I recall was a modest sized "motel"
---
Quest weapons will scale. Legendary enemies do not scale
---
Hm that’s weird perhaps they’re is a big then but that’s also odd it removed it for ur inventory perhaps get on a team and go into ur team leaders space inside of it maybe you can get another shot at it
---
Echoing Quantum skin for X-01.  It's a decently fun mini-quest to get it, and you don't need to spend atoms for something that looks cool.
---
Excavator - I really like the bone raider skins for it (although the red and yellow versions have different names).  Wait until they're on sale again in the atom shop.  Or, just pick up the basic colors pack because they work with all power armor (maybe not T-65, I don't have it yet) and it's kind of cool to mix and match them.
---
I wish there was a way to turn HDR off for specific games on the pro, or at least adjust it.
---
I hate how it looks in this game on my tv. Any bright lights are blinding, opening my pip-boy in some train stations is annoying because I can't see it.
---
Oh i see, that sucks. Seems ok on auto rifles (for now).
---
...mees yeht tahw ton era slwo ehT
---
In most cases when you see this when you log onto a server it just means the server hasn't updated your map yet. Close your map, wait a minute and then reopen it. It should then show where the correct target is.
---
Carpets and furniture and practicing with the lighting. it’s doable with patience
---
I can't read the words in the photo, what does it say?
---
There are legendary hunting rifles, it's just a matter of the drop pool being sooo huge
---
I highly recommend looking for an instigating rifle by the way, double damage, doubled again with sneak attack
---
kind of.  the levels of enemies are in play as well.  meaning just cause you're "max" level, if the enemy isn't high level enough, they'll drop only up to what they are.  i have no idea how all this interplays with quests though.  i'd imagine they'd scale for the area you're in, or the "toughness" of the quest/event.  but what they're keyed off and if i'm talking out my ass or not... well that i dunno.
---
They’re there. Just have to wait till you roll on every type of harpoon gun there is.
---
Me too. PSN is the_grimbot if you want to add me
---
Yeah, so many backpacks are ruined, hope it gets addressed sooner than later.
---
There's a time limit too when doing that too, isn't there? I'm probably going to get it for a month for the junk stash and I might move a few weapons to my alt
---
That’s because Vault 76 experimented with time dilation and memory alterations. Their greatest experiment is access to the alternate dimension, which is the Appalachia we experience. Due to current issues with 76 itself there are barriers preventing exploration past this area of space time. Vault-Tec has been busy.
---
Honestly, its annoying af when people do this, happened today as well
---
Guided Meditation, about 4 of us, Legendary came up, I didn't even get a chance to hit it with my gun before his level 400 odd insta kills it, I do the usual angry emote and that and he does the love emote then thumbs up, that irked me - I should also mention I was not in a good mood and patience was thinner than a thin piece of string, I messaged him 
---
"why do that ya selfish twat? Let others get a hit first"
---
He replied "sorry, it happens, lag you know?" Bullshit, I've had lag but not to that extent besides there was fuck all around that would've caused it
---
Event ended, I was about to run a Silo to get the 4 notes but Uranium Fever came up and I realised I had enough notes for the 20, resisted the urge to Nuke the prick and left the session when doing that event, guy wasn't at the event and everyone got a chance to get a hit in, which calmed me a bit
---
Ya I was hoping to get an instigating rifle, the other 2 stars can pretty much be whatever.  The legendary pool really is huge, I just thought I would see one on a player vending machine either.  Lever action just isn't the same because I don't have all the mods unlocked.
---
I have a heavy gunner character that I HATED until the last month or so.  In that time I fiddled with my perks until something clicked and now things are working.
---
I still enjoy my unarmed character more, but that character is crap against flying beasties.
---
Power Armor still sucks against Mirelurk King and Queen though.
---
Don't forget all the broadsiders!
---
Better yet, allow bullets to be scraped for gunpowder, lead, and steel or copper. I'm ok with removing gunpowder from the loot table if we switch to scraping bullets.
---
I think it would be fair to still be able to craft gunpowder from mats but remove it from the loot table.
---
Yesterday, I removed 10k+ 10mm ammo from my vending machine and forgot I had it in my inventory. I was over encumbered for 2/3 of that game session. Then I remembered the ammo. Poof! No longer walking everywhere.
---
Agreed, its ridiculous, I gave up giving a shit about the Sloth due to the onslaught of Legendaries during the event - the idiots that would kill it would then drop the Legendary, like why fucking bother then?! 
---
Uranium Fever is a solid example you get good ones you get bad ones mostly good in my experience thankfully
---
You should switch to bloodied, I just tried going full health junkie and regret it very much. Still trying to fine tune it but it's a definite **big, fat** downgrade.
---
Yup shoot the middle of the panel and pop go the circuits!
---
At risk of getting flamed, what is the bull barrel? I'm a noob attempting a pistol build so I'm very curious.
---
I literally got 2 near identical broadsiders in a row. Thought it glitched and showed me the first one again but nope. Two 3 stars with 1 different star
---
So it kind of depends on a few things. Fed76 is based on PC prices. Console might vary. 
---
Fed76 range I find good for person to person trades but not vendors. If you put something in a vendor for the fed76 price it will sit for a long time.
---
1.  Well see what it actually entails.    
---
3.  I hope not.    
---
4. If it's just a level balancing system like TES did the loot will still be trash, you'll just find bullet sponges everywhere.
---
Fed76 is laughably out of touch in my experience. I wouldn't trust it for anything.
---
Just look at what other people are selling things for in various market places and aim for around there with your buy/sell prices.
---
Yes to all of this. I also want some glass walls. I dont remember who made the mod for fo4 but someone made glass walls that worked amazing with the garage door. You could use the garage door like automatic blinds or a blast shield. Also I like building minimalist modern homes and desperately miss those.
---
Yeah I'm on PC. I only started 2 months ago, so this has been a great resource for me.
---
Edit: Not sure why the downvote for stating something true about myself, but hey, keep doing you. Guess the person who downvoted me don't agree that I'm on pc or have only started 2 months ago...
---
I been searching vendors for ages and never found a worthwhile hunting rifle. Any instigating perfect line up is gonna get grabbed or be top dollar. I actually gave up on sniping as fate gave me such better VATS handmades. You can plan and dream, or you can look in your stash and face reality. This is the way.
---
Keep looking. They're out there. Also, a side note...look for one with 250 DR while Reloading as the 3rd star if possible. Since the bug associated with that has been fixed, it is a monster on sniper/hunting rifles. The DR also kicks in as you're chambering the bullets between shots...this has been a thing forever, and almost no one knows it. I haven't tested it recently to make sure it still works like that, but there haven't been any notes saying it's been changed. Makes surviving in a mob much more doable. Good luck in your hunt.
---
Is it really that bad? 
---
&gt;Just look at what other people are selling things for in various market places and aim for around there with your buy/sell prices.
---
There really isn't a good place to track this, at least not one I know of. If you know one, please tell.
---
Wired with standard lamp cord? Fail.
---
Need to craft five-9 silver cable with ultracite connectors to bring out the spaciousness in the mid-range.
---
Haha yup I get attacked there every time
---
But bro have you seen my explosive gattling gun?
---
They’re out there. Got an anti-armor exploding “short hunting rifle” from the purveyor yesterday. It’s not so short anymore.
---
Sigh... yeah we're all pred/gladiator/professional gamer on reddit. I know that you're a lying scrub but I respect you for not lying about you being a pred current season.
---
Think I saw you do that on NW
---
For my X-01 I use Military.  One of the best looks I think.
---
There is one that is a reward for the wayward quest with the robos token
---
It depends. Quest rewards generally so but some rewards max out at 45 so that's all you get. Even then in some instances I have a vague memory that even then it doesn't scale. However, for the most part if you're talking quest completion rewards are usually scaled.
---
Legendaries you get along the way e.g. Uranium Fever, don't scale to your max.
---
I think theres a time limit of 5 mins but im not exactly sure. I always just swap characters and grab the stuff i left right away.
---
They wouldn't even need to make them a pound. The perfect solution would be to change the loot pool to just coal.
---
I'm not sure why he assumes every newish person to this sub is a shill. I got fallout 76 last June and joined reddit because it came up every time I searched fallout 76 related stuff.
---
I'd love to donate furnishings... So many players sleeping on a dirty mattress...
---
Wish someone would do it for me lol. That was awesome of them to do.
---
If you can't tell aimbotters in this game, you don't pvp. They aimbot without hesitation in fallout 76. It's nothing like NW gtfo
---
Not for EXP
---
Ik, but bloodied makes the game too easy and I like it being challenging. Besides, I can sneak kill almost any enemy with one hit of my instigating axe if I want to
---
And it’s a shit design because god builds are putting out so much damage that you can sometimes only get a hit or two in before she’s dead and non god builds can’t reach the damage threshold
---
Vanguard HTD AGI is your best sneak roll a
---
well its says 0 like 5MM.. but it may not.. it's such a small amount it would take ALOT to even be 1 lb of weight.
---
Trying to retool my stealth rifleman to this, not too hard but I really need a good bow, and I have yet to max out Settlers so I can't compound.
---
Also could be a Maxell commercial ...
---
/old
---
Not true at all. I hit the cap yesterday with a level 5 pipe rifle on my alt. Its not very difficult, and its made so people won't be able to leech like they did in events like Fasnacht.
---
I keep forgetting about the shortcut when I get in there to be honest...
---
You can’t craft legendary fixers you can only find them
---
I figured out how to fix it, go into the opposite mode so if ur in private server go to online, teleport to vault 76 and then go back to private and you will be able to load in, at least it worked for me
---
Yeah you may want to research what this actually means and how these items were created.
---
max gunslinger, demolition expert, bloodymess, and adrenaline
---
They didn’t exist at launch but absolutely do exist now. Just got a junkies drop recently.
---
Hah, well, it's an option. I prefer it, saves a few minutes.
---
I dont get it.
---
its a chair on a floor placed odly
---
I think I still have a bloody hunting/sniper rifle sitting in my vendor.
---
The 3 star one (bloody, 50% extra crit damage, 25% AP cost) took ages to sell at 10k caps...but it had been my baby before I switched to commando.
---
They are out there is what I am saying.
---
I just completed it with a great group! Good tip about the enforcer perk too! Thanks again!
---
Need some proof with that
---
I think I have an instigating explosive hunting rifle on one of my mule characters I can sell for like 5k.
---
Yea, I am mainly melee but I use the .50 machine gun for long range and I fly through ammo
---
Some people on the PTS have been reporting  the FT bug and respawn bug have been fixed. So hopefully next patch.
---
For some lower tier items, they might not be too off. But when it comes to high tier-god tier items, they lowball a lot.
---
I had a friend test out tank killer, and apparently the only good thing about it is the knockback
---
If you have the super duper perk, I encourage you 2 try it and see for yourself.
---
Very insightful thank you
---
Very cool.  They could land a spot at the Whitespring with this!
---
Honestly all the time they spend adding stuff to atom shop could be spent adding more crap to do
---
Thanks! Seems like that is the case.
---
This is why I kept all the gold if they're going to still be mad at me, it may as well be for a good reason!
---
Does junkies weapon give you some kind of boost that shows on the unequipped weapons?
---
Have you used the cards yet? If so, check your inventory, they won't be there anymore.
---
If  not, don't use them until you've looked up what they're used for. I'm being vague for possible spoilers.
---
[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ1WYOqIabM) explains it (near the end).
---
It almost feels like the game WANTS us to be bloodied
---
&gt;Is it really that bad?
---
Yeah, it really is that bad. It's not even consistently that way. Some are grossly overvalued, others sometimes somewhat undervalued.
---
If you don't believe me, visit this sub's discord and ask around. I'd be VERY surprised if people thing that Fed76 is a good pricing resource.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt;There really isn't a good place to track this, at least not one I know of. If you know one, please tell.
---
I do agree somewhat there is no one good place to find what prices are. That's a good thing. No one pushing a single price that may be not relevant after changes due to meta, player preferences, market being flooded by exploiters etc.
---
One great example of not falling for what people tell you prices should be had to do with mutation serums.
---
When people started selling them regularly, a few people on trading sites and organised trading groups would push the idea that the average price was like 500-1k and sometimes even more than 1k per serum when in reality the price is closer to what you see nowadays, which is usually around 300-500 with it not being too difficult to find them at 200 or 250 if you're willing to shop around and wait. 
---
Grossly overinflated prices to serve their own needs rather than reflecting the reality of what players were vending them for.
---
Worthless grinding in a nutshell in spending 1000 scrip at the purveyor and getting 10 mutants Gatling plasmas.
---
Yeah I’ve used them both to get the quantum they’re still there I’m on Xbox maybe it has something to do with that
---
Sacrifice a goat on the altar of RNG basically. Once you learn the plan, Fixers enter the random loot table of possible drops from the Purveyor. Exchange scrip for a 3 star roll on a ranged weapon and hope you get lucky at some point. Edit to add you may get lucky and find one for sale from a player but the price will probably be hefty and likely require a trade of some sort
---
Once you learn the fixer plan, the purveyor has a chance to give you one when you spend 100 scrip on a ranged weapon.
---
But she will probably just give you a 80 lb missile launcher instead
---
I would probably jam plasma cores into the mailboxes.
---
Nevah! One day i shall laugh at their nerf, muhahahahaha! 🙃
---
Miscellaneous. No category. It’s just there, but can’t be grouped with other things like “hello” or “let’s team up”
---
Maybe it's PC only. Oxhorn's video (which I linked) even references the cards being "consumed".
---
Had no idea, thank you!
---
Oh ok...i knew that misc stands for miscellaneous but i didn't know that it meant literally nothing..XD thanks
---
Are you on PC by chance?  If so I'm interested.
---
This person is right, with a couple of notes. You only need one peice with HTD as it doesn't stack...one is enough. Also, I'd throw in a piece or two with Chameleon. Those coupled with the Sneak Perk really make you sneaky. Consider throwing in a piece with Luck and/or AP Refresh as the second ability...Luck particularly if you use VATS Crits (more crits) and AP if you use VATS at all (more shots).
---
One other note, skip Sentinel. Its doesn't work while crouched, and you probably spend most of the time crouching. Good luck and happy sniping.
---
If you currently have a junkies equipped (with addictions) it will show you a higher damage on non-junkie weapons (basically they have the junkies boost) but you lose the junkie modifier when you equip them
---
I think I missed out on that one :(
---
It’s because it makes him feel better to think that every ‘real’ player agrees with him and dislikes this game as much as he does. So if he convinces himself that anyone that doesn’t hate the game is a shill, he feels vindicated.
---
Damn that sounds tempting.  I'll keep an eye out.
---
A duper gave you a bunch of stuff for free. You probably didn't know any better but this isn't a good thing. You basically did the equivalent using stolen goods.
---
Like I said you didn't know any better but if you come across something that seems to generous to seem right, you may be best off to avoid it. May not sting you now but if it were duped hacked items, you could possibly have your account flagged to be temporarily or permanently banned at some stage.
---
Not hating on you at all dude. Just saying it's something to be mindful of for the future.
---
Ah. Ok. That makes sense. Thank you.
---
As a bloodied build, I on one hand envy you, as I’ve crafted almost 200 pieces and scripped about 50 vanguard sentinel/cavalier/sneak secret service pieces. On the other hand I can’t get a good bloodied weapon drop from enemies or the purv.
---
Can’t turn down Cicadas. Visit anywhere in the South lol
---
The pound would fudge their characters over. That's why I suggested it.
---
I wouldn’t use it, it seems to be wayyyyy off to me
---
That sucks, I wish they would take them out :(
---
There's a post just after yours that might be the answer you're looking for:
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hb6g2h/have\_had\_to\_get\_rid\_of\_the\_ss\_jet\_pack/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hb6g2h/have_had_to_get_rid_of_the_ss_jet_pack/)
---
Htd?
---
Lol I bet it doesn't even look like the same gun.  Gratz
---
I have a good handmade, but bloodied isn't the life for me.  I do too much dumb stuff.
---
I survived because the fire inside me burned brighter than the fire around me.
---
Thanks for the info, gratz on your rifle!
---
My gun is a bloody FFR combat rifle and I shred things faster than anyone else I’ve come across.
---
Are you on PC?  If you still have it I would be willing to make an offer.
---
I learned a couple things!
---
Is that sentinel thing fact? I have so many damage redux perks I can’t tell
---
That’s odd lol maybe Xbox is glitched or my character is it is fallout 76 lol
---
I just hate that the economy is so trash now. Dupers fucked it up so badly that I can't even go into r/76market anymore because everyone's asking for outrageous prices, items, legacies, no-fucking-caps, no-low-balls shit. Bitch, I JUST PLAY THE GAME, for normal players trading items is fucking useless now.
---
Shotgun ammo also drops fairly common and, since most shotguns aren't automatic, they generally don't require too much ammo (when compared to guns like the flamer and minigun anyway). 
---
Regardless of how cheap or viable a shotgun is most players will most likely use a shotgun at lower levels anyway due to the fact that the ammo drops from scorched. So nearly every player would have used a shotgun at some point. Whereas a flamer can easily be skipped because by the time you can even use the thing (level 30) you have probably already started on your main build.
---
Even then, before the shotgun was nerfed it was one of the most common weapons. Which is where people would have started reporting on the rubber banding effect. Flamers, while kinda usable now, still are not as widely used as shotguns were pre-nerf so less people have documented the rubber banding on it, and even less people would have compared the two. Even then whenever I see people complaining about it I'll always see someone bring up the rubber banding on it. 
---
Anyway, this is a discussion with no real conclusion since we don't actually have any hard data, just heresay and anecdotal evidence. The point is we agree that rubber banding sucks and needs to be dealt with, regardless of which weapons are effected more.
---
You'd need to have heat seeking artillery shells because it'd still likely miss if the enemy moved around as it takes some time from firing to landing and the enemy could have moved away by then.
---
That doesn't even factor in the tech required or how expensive each dart would be.
---
Chinese stealth suit 🙂
---
Sharkfromjawz with a z, not s. He's part of a group called The Trap Camp Federation these days
---
I know it's an old post, but it's still true...
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aybujm/sentinel_apply_when_sneaking/
---
Xbox. Sorry I didn't mention that in my other post.
---
Probably the troubleshooters FFR 25ap cost fixer lol.
---
So close to perfect...still sold for 20k
---
I always give the same answer when these posts pop up. If you rely on others opinions of the game to make decisions, then this game is probably not for you. I say that because once you get into the higher levels, enjoyment of this game comes mainly from your ability to entertain yourself. There's no actual endgame style content to play and grind. Just different challenges and repetitive daily quests. 
---
Asking an entire sub-reddit specifically for the game if you should get the game is kind of like asking a mcdonalds employee if you should get a mcdouble. 
---
I probably come off as an asshole, and I'm sorry if it seems I'm being harsh. I'm just giving my honest answer to your question. I've been playing this game since beta, and I love. I play every single day, even if it's just for an hour or two. The game has its flaws, but I still have a good time with it.
---
It could be a reward like the decontamination shower in scorched earth, making it another way to show off your experience at your camp
---
THANK YOU, this is good info. I dont really have a need for a jetpack, if I need a better vantage point I'll just pop on my PA :/
---
It depends. If you have no other anti-armour effects, it's pretty good. If you have a bunch of them, it may be better to allocate those points to a different perk as you get diminishing returns when stacking anti-armour effects.
---
&gt;its murder
---
And I just want it to be fun. Lately it isn't.  I am not sure that it ever was.
---
Make sure your chipset drivers are up to date.
---
Harder to detect while sneaking
---
Hard to argue with the top comment haha
---
What other aa perks are there then the effect?
---
PS4 unfortunately.
---
HAHAHAHA
---
They could use a small nerf and high hp a big buff
---
Good to know - thanks!  I'll invest in the SS arms and legs instead of that mod.  I just got the chest piece this week.
---
Do you have ap refresh on limbs or the ap perkcard.noticed my ap is ok but I use the card and 3 limbs w ap refresh. Diminishing returns indeed but works ok
---
That sounds rather fancy. It must make you feel special being able to stack on more and more power armour mods than your normally could. I likey very much :)
---
As an impartial third party you were being dramatic.
---
You avoid it “LIKE THE PLAGUE?”
---
You avoid using an Armor in-game like an actually life threatening deadly disease responsible for countless deaths?
---
Lol, what is your definition of dramatic?
---
Rally? I dont see the point of those legendary effects.
---
You can only place things in designated displays.
---
Not perks. Other AA effects, like the ones from the weapon itself.
---
I'm at that point too, but putting it off for as long as I can.  I'm sort of leaning towards the Raiders, because I feel like giving it to the settlers for rebuilding the economy will just enable them to make all of the same mistakes.  The Raiders have had to scrounge and fight for their foothold; survival just seems to mean more to them.
---
I'm still not entirely sure, though.
---
all i ask for is to buff the range __at least 2x__ so its useful in more of the wasteland.  the range is so pitiful on the thing
---
better yet, let us target anywhere on map with the pearly peepers, would be a great use of a unique item.
---
I checked again, I only have Paired Key Card 02, and the other card still isn't respawning. I even tried advancing the quest in the power plant to see if that would trigger a respawn, but no.
---
Have u tried being part of a team and going into ur team leaders space that sounds like the only thing crazy enough to work
---
So what you can you display on shelves? And where can you display your Nuka bottles?
---
That's my bad, I updated the main post.
---
I use the jetpack and haven't noticed any issues. I have no problem using vats on everything in uranium fever or radiation Rumble. It may be your perk card set up, agility or armor perks not having AP refresh.
---
Flamers have always been heavys
---
Update: just did a run through of whitesprings.
---
The junkies, with mister sandman, covert op and adrenaline going, it was hitting torsos for 678. 
---
The TS, when both shots would land, was hitting for 552 and 276 (I avoided VATS to get the numbers to appear) so it really seems that the TS is better right? That’s 150 more damage.
---
It's not a public event. But it is random if it's up or not
---
I only Have the SS Chest Piece at the moment.
---
My other 4 pieces are all high tier Forest scout Armour pieces.
---
Not sure on AP refresh side i will have to check.
---
Now i have put the Sentinel Piece back on all is cool again.
---
I will have to check tomorrow to see if this piece has AP refresh.
---
I am pretty sure it dosent though.
---
I think being a Sniper build i just noticed the -1 AP more with that Jet Pack.
---
It is pretty significant to us type of players.
---
It really does kill the build.
---
adding on: ally daily quests use the purveyor list, so they also have a (slim) chance for the fixer
---
I have the SS jetpack and love it. I'll never not have it now. I hated the jetpack on PA, but it works much better with the legendary perks on regular armor.
---
That's what I'll do next. The only problem is that that would probably use their card. I have a second character that I'll have to use to get them the Quantum plans.
---
I remember when they added just the Fixer and gave no other viable weapons to any other category. And they still have yet to add a weapon with a special effect for all categories that stacks along with its 3 legndary effects. The Fixer is basically a 4*. 
---
It made sense that pretty much all the other commonly used weapon classes got a significant upgrade with Wastelanders. Pistols finally got an actual useful pistol. Heavy weapons got a energy weapon that is useful on more than just the queen. 
---
Shotguns got a kick ass powerful energy shotgun. The new gauntlet sucks from what I've heard and the bows seem to under perform. 
---
Even with all those additions a god roll fixer still pretty much out performs it all on average.
---
Strangler Heart has more damage. T-65 has more defense. Thats rlly all you gotta weight.
---
You probably had a high level person go through at some stage. Server hop and try again. They're not always robots. Sometimes it's scorched too.
---
Pay them in caps or give them the first quantum x01 paint u get to pay them back idk if it will actually work tho I hope it does for u
---
It's definitely easier with more people. You can get the stable flux from Scorched Earth too.
---
I've seen a couple similar designs, really cool concept.
---
my camp is near sutton. during fasnacht I had blast. literally.
---
here is my 2c on the armors
---
IMO strangler is better for the long run, though an argument can be made that T65 mods are easier to get for more short term.
---
here is why:
---
- after 400-500, DR/ER is near meaningless due to diminishing returns
---
- all PA have a base 42%? damage reduction (full set)
---
- rad resist # is near meaningless per AT's str/end video, all PA has a base 90% rad reduction (full set)
---
- strangler has the acid damage and aura effects, t65 has no set bonus
---
Yeah it’s a raider life.
---
In the early launches day they were pretty valuable. Not so much today though, new players might want them, but Ultracite PA is subpar and not too common. You'd just have to find the right buyer to fetch a good price.
---
It needs improved range.
---
Its a sign - time to change your build!
---
No to both. Her behavior is random.
---
caps were already worthless long before the gift dupe.
---
its because of the caps cap that noone will trade high end items for caps.
---
noone wants to play accountant simulator 76 when they could just do a barter trade.
---
that being said, you are arent going in with a good peice for trade, then you wont get any  traction with your trade. sometimes you have to try a few times, id use the discord if you want to trade faster. also try going into smaller 76 discords, almost all of them have trade channels.
---
As I say, I have another character that i don't use any more. I haven't used the cards for that character yet. I'll use them to help the team leader get the quantum plans.
---
I had no problems before.
---
No idea why this one piece kills my AP but it does.
---
I have 350 levels in the game.So i know which is my best Perk set up.
---
I checked,checked and double checked.
---
When you are grinding out those Treasury Bonds it gets very repetitive,so you notice little things like a much slower AP refresh when killing Ghouls.
---
The slower refresh was the worst part tbh.
---
Energy guns for the most part are fine, it's laser rifles that are garbage
---
What would someone creating duped items gain from this? I thought someone was being nice by dropping things to a low level player, going to dropped these from my inventory. Don’t wanna do anything I’m not suppose to.
---
They already removed the scrip. 
---
I grounded out 1000 presents and had been opening them as needed for a few extra scrip here and there until they took that away. Now I save them to give to new players (1 each) along with some I promised to save for a buddy that’s deployed. 
---
I understand the desire to punish dupers and exploiters, but there are some of us that still have presents that **didn’t** dupe them. Penalizing a player that broke no rules is not the right way to go.
---
I agree with most points but I hated the cocky SOB in the raiders who is needed on the team near the end (did my best to not put spoilers). Foundation may be boring but they are fair and the raiders are easier to get rep with because they have more dailies (being able to do 3+ raider daily quests per day to get rep is much better than the 1 per day you get from the foundation). So I will always go with foundation to get them both maxed asap.
---
Wholesome
---
If they have been around since launch it would be very easy to do. There have been lots of different XP glitches as well as legitimate XP farming methods that have been nerfed.
---
&gt; I gifted basically all the mounted plans, prime receivers, misc camp object plans and even some nice power armour attachments. 
---
That sounds more like you opened a bunch of duped presents and are just offloading crap.
---
Are you a cop? Lol 😈
---
your not coming off as an asshole, honestly next level answer here. incredibly intelligent
---
Hmm I’ll give that a try
---
WH-1000XM3.
---
They've added enjoyment to everything I listen to, I think they were worth the months and months of saving
---
It definitely doubles your melee dmg so it's very fun. If you think you won't kill her b4 you blackout try and die or take another post war alchohol it should override the nukeashine
---
Could also just a be hoarder of plans but who knows Todd ;)
---
yeah that makes sense. it worked, thanks
---
That plan wasn’t that hard to get from the gifts. I set up a Santatron at every workshop on my private world, bought out as many vendors as possible (selling stuff first to clear out their caps and let them refill at 25%), and ended up with over 1000 gifts. Completely legitimately. 
---
I ended up with about 18 extra Santa Crash plans, IIRC.
---
Dupers screwed the legitimate grinders moreso than anyone else.
---
Why have the switch out on the open if you’re gonna do that?
---
All my common ammo gets vendored for one cap.it still doesn't sell quickly.
---
Isnt that nuclear winter related stuff?
---
There's about 500 billion presents out there. More than 499 Billion are duped. It's such a small amount that are legit that makes it a fair sacrifice. Nothing against anyone that worked hard for these, it's all Bethesda's fault duping got to this point. If they would have applied more to fixing the dupes then we wouldn't be here. This is legitimately the only way to fix the problem and start fresh for the next Christmas event.
---
Oof. The gentleman doth protest too much methinks.
---
Also those specific plans? Nah...
---
Mine will likely collect dust almost forever now - its a novelty of something new but far too impractical to run all the time regardless of ammo type.  Gatlings of all types are my go to weapons, I don't bother priming them and for someone that does multiple queen runs about everday now these are by far the most sustainable weapons - 5mm, plasma and fusion cores.
---
I have another character that's stealth commando - and I do notice how much 5.56 you burn at scorched earth.  Heavy guns ie. gatlings are by far the best/most economical to field on a regular basis for these large fights.
---
Reach rank 44 in Nuclear Winter and use the pink sprinkles power armor paint on all of your different power armor sets. It's easily the greatest paint job in the entire game.
---
I'm suddenly sad I'm PS4.  I would have followed you around like a puppy until you dropped stable cobalt or the brick building plans.....
---
By leveling up in nuclear winter and getting doubles of the cards in the level up packs
---
Look under display cases in the build menu. There are two cases by default that hold 4 items. The Thanksgiving display case holds 6.
---
You have to talk to him every time. For me I talk to him and he thanks me for helping out last time. I tell him I am always happy to help friends of crater. Then I ask how he ended up all the way out there (despite the fact that I already know what he says I still have to ask or it will not work). After he tells you that I ask to talk about something else and then I ask him if he needs help with anything. this is when he gives the quest. I will also point out on public servers he tends to bug out allot for me and sometimes you have to close the dialog window with tab then start over with each new back of lines (especially if you try to skip them by pressing space bar). Also, in public servers if someone has done this quest recently there will be fewer mirelurks that come out (I assume it is becasue the other people killed most the mirelurks nearby when they did it but it never happens on my private server).
---
Ahah nah I totally opened a few, but in my defense I just got gifted them and 2nd I did throw in alot of shit that wasnt from those.
---
Like I crafted them stuff and gave them fusion cores and excavator armours so dont throw me down the creek yet my fellow fallout'r
---
I'm on the East coast I'm on during the day and many times in the evening to do dailies if you'd like to launch a nuke with me I'll bring you through it.
---
Maybe you should ask for support from those that would be making the sacrifice before you start volunteering us?
---
So how many presents did you open?
---
its an auto rifle, nothing to boost the incendiary damage that i know off.
---
Judging by 10mm SMGs gaining damage from Commando, that would also be its perk. Nothing boosts the fire damage.
---
They nerfed the heart, remember.
---
Dont ruin my robin hood moment  😅
---
You probably don't want those old cards deleted quite yet I watched a video by angry turtle on YouTube and those cards may come into play for leveling up those legendaries.
---
Lol fair enough.
---
Do 3 laps around the map starting at foundation with nothing but your fists and you gotta make sure Ward's right about to get in bed when you finish each lap. After your final lap you gotta eat 100 raw glowing meat while standing over ward sleeping without catching a disease and then the bug will be fixed.
---
Any body of water in a low-level area.
---
And the super Christmas holds 12
---
Neveeeeer!
---
What torlok12 said is correct. Unless you're doing PVP you'll never see or need them. If you do play Nuclear Winter you can trade them in for specific perk cards that you want for your build.
---
Like the mods for this:
---
https://bethesda.net/en/mods/fallout4/mod-detail/3582688
---
You just need action boy and a few ap refresh pieces. 
---
The jetpack is worth -1 ap.
---
This.
---
Or you know, just remove the mod from the armor and continue using the armor...
---
Is there a way to find out the spawn locations of enemy NPCs around your camp? In order to decrease camp budget but still protecting the water purifiers.
---
my question is, why vanguard and not bolstering? is it not better that you have more time to heal ?
---
Like 25? Lol I've had like 400 lbs of plans for about 6 months though. Have like 3 chars and my highest level basically just hoards plans and I didnt wanna mule stuff. Good enough answer? :)
---
Why can't I just put one in range of some power and have it turn on automatically like lights and vendors? I love the music in this game but I never remember to turn on the radio in my camp.
---
That's what I'm saying let me turn them in for the level up points. Just let me bank them until Legendary perks go live.
---
Having played with a quad and a two shot I'd go with the twoshot 2x the rads is pretty nutty. You can also chuck some pumpkin nades to make them take more rads as well
---
Jetpack is the most fun and useful item imo. Worth every damn gold bar, no doubt.
---
Not like I opened 700 like most do... lol
---
Sad life I have lots lol.
---
They gotta get cross platforming going.
---
That I do not have the answer to.
---
Solar armor set with harder to detect and ap refresh.
---
No problem. Thanks for the info
---
You're welcome to suggest a solution to the broken economy caused by duped presents? I guarantee there are less than 50k presents in circulation that were not duped but instead crafted. The items within are so worthless they sell for 20caps, or litter the ground. The cap gain from the presents requires 500 for about 30k caps, while the people with duped ones have over 15k. 
---
If you think your cap gain from the presents has a huge boost to quality, I can assure you that caps are easy enough to come by with good vending. I'm always at max caps because of that.
---
I don't understand why you choose to die on a hill that is made of duped presents. Would you rather Bethesda straight up wipe the presents out of your inventory like they did in the first dupe cleanses?
---
For added fun throw a jukebox in your camp...see how long your sanity lasts
---
Only way I've found is set up camp and place a few scarecrows down around the outside of your camp circle. Leave for 10 minutes or more than fast travel back. Soon after you spawn in enemies should spawn close by and shoot at the scarecrows.
---
What kind of performance gains are you seeing in FO76 with an SSD?  Faster load screens?  Any way to quantify how much faster?
---
No.
---
Is there a paint on it?
---
I now how you feel, I must play with headphones because if not my dog goes crazy and barks to the damn insect noises all the time...
---
Have you already turned in your 150 script for today?
---
We're crab people now!
---
what solar do?
---
Best comment ever
---
Yes! Is that the issue?
---
Fast health regen even in battle when above 60 pct health
---
Any ideas where I can get scarecrows plans? 
---
Thanks for the advice
---
Or you could just drop them.
---
What super christmas?
---
Because you use cores vs. thousands of ammo lol
---
And a protection that can deliver mail for you from one camp to the other...and make the fucker take real life days to deliver it.
---
Not just the purveyor. All random loot drops from quests and legendary enemies.
---
Not just the purveyor, but all legendary enemies have the chance to drop one, and quests have them added as random loot too.
---
I think a solo map would be outstanding,  but I fear teams would still coordinate their action.
---
Magnum mod from Fo4 it completely changed the look of the gun and was totally awesome. Check it out
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/.44_pistol_(Fallout_4)
---
Actually raiders have more than 2 daily quests. There are the 2 you mentioned but you also have the mirelurk defense daily and the mirelurk food supply daily (most people do not know about them since they do not show up in pip boy but you can do them once a day and they give rep with raiders). both the mirelurk daily quests come from the Ohio River Adventures and they do not give as much rep as the ones from main camp but they still give some rep. Plus the foundation daily can sometimes give raider rep as well if you are okay with losing foundation rep. To do that a raider must have stolen the supplies you are sent to get and you just tell em that if they pay you and put in a good word for you at base they can keep it.
---
The principle is simple:  I put forth the legitimate effort to acquire a legitimate reward. 
---
Why should I be punished alongside those individuals that duped?  How will **your** gameplay experience be improved if the presents were removed completely?
---
How do you benefit?
---
It’s not about the caps. It’s about providing a reason that supports penalizing honest players.
---
Only need one piece with chameleon, as it doesn't stack either.
---
Waste of time at high levels.
---
Bethesda:
---
“Hey you know that ultracite laser rifle that does even less damage than the standard one?”
---
“Yeah what about it?”
---
“What if we, hear me out, made it do LESS damage? Eh? That’ll really balance the game out”
---
Lol
---
You can use anything really (walls, displays, denomination showers). But I find scarecrows are targeted first. If you don't have them place another decoration down and just keep an eye out for the spawn point.
---
You gain the ability to craft them when you scrap one.
---
That tracker is broken for me about 2 times out of 3, and the conversation afterwards is broken about 1 time out of 4. Sometimes it beeps but the numbers don't come up, sometimes   the thief is nowhere to be found, sometimes the thief is already dead but I'm still encouraged to tearful regret being forced to kill him...
---
In your case I would bet the thief got killed and his corpse fell through the world.
---
I didn't see a time listed. I imagine its pre recorded so I don't think its a live stream either way.
---
Other issue is stairs. You can't place walls on stairs so your walls can only have one half because only one seem works
---
Put door way walls first then the rolling door. After you put the rolling garage door, then you can switch the wall to a window. The inside walls look better with the rolling door asthetic and functionality as they have a "deeper mesh" , the outside walls just look like a garage door. If you want an inside wall on the outside, place a second foundation until you orient the wall properly, then remove the second foundation.
---
Yes. 2 mods is crazy low
---
Yep, can't drop/sell/vendor items with atom shop paints on them, remove it and it should be fine.
---
The funniest use of text I've found so far was some guy professing his love for someone named Jessica who "doesn't care" that he loves her.
---
Also someone wrote "bad words" all over their camp. Literally, "bad words".
---
Yes. It's worth it. I have about two years to Elder Scrolls Online and, upon starting F76, never logged in to ESO ever again. Theres an understated and undervalued level of independence this game gives. If you like exploring, that's there. If you like combat, there's enough to wet your appetite at times. If you like building, that's there too. You can solo, or you can team. There's story content to listen to and stuff to read that's kinda cool with respect to lore. My advice is, start a game with *absolutely no preconceived notions* and take it for what it presents as. I'm sure I'll see you at level 150+ in a few months.
---
Lighten up. It was presents. Nothing game breaking or server crashing. And quite frankly, it sounds like he was more than thankful for the help.
---
god mode glitch with stacking xp buffs/ unyielding to get 4k xp per kill.
---
Fallout 4 was a single player game. After you finished the main quest, all you're supposed to do is the side quests and the DLCs and that's it. This is very different from an online live service game
---
I’ll put my team to work on this.
---
I provided the reason that you completely ignored. The economy. 
---
People will stand at vending machines and use presents to buy you out. They spend 30k then open presents to buy more. You reach 30k, so your items are stolen as you have gained nothing past 30k.
---
Sometimes life is unfair and you are penalized because the actions of others. These cheaters ruined the economy. Taking away what ruined the economy would set it back to having worth again. 
---
Go ahead and suggest your solution to this. I'm still waiting to see how you would improve it rather than saying "my precious presents".
---
Don't let the other comments get to you. Sounds like they are jealous. And FYI: even if they were duped, there's nothing that could be done to you about it. Bugthesda can't/won't track non-atom shop glitched items unless it's an outrageous amount of them.
---
.308 handgun would break your wrist, and probably knock you in the head.
---
.308 SMG also literally makes no sense because an SMG is based on handgun calibers.
---
Granted, some more midpoint rifles are needed. Semi auto like an AR-10
---
They need half walls and half foundations.  Half porch too.
---
U should see my friends half base I'll let you guys think about what that could be lol
---
Pick it up. You might be able to give it to ward when he’s not asleep
---
If I'm reading your comment right, it seems like you think the damage on an instigating is doubled for the first shot, and then the doubled damage is doubled again for being in sneak mode. Is this a correct summary of your thought process?
---
Fiddle would be so dope!
---
Is it just xbox players at the moment  or is there some ps4/PC players as well?
---
Yes
---
Needs a nuke dropped in front of it to complete the ad
---
That's amazing!!!
---
You're forgetting that it only stacks when using the god mode glitch.
---
Thank youfor the help
---
My experience is that Fed76 is based on what people are asking on trading subs and groups—not what they’re getting in vending machines. Dedicated market groups have a tendency toward high prices, while players who shop at vendors are a much wider cross section of the player base. 
---
I think it’s useful to tell if things are desirable or not, but beyond that. The prices probably aren’t that realistic.
---
This sounds like a terrible joke but I'll try it
---
Just go through public servers until you see an active nuke zone. I wait until it's empty (as the launcher and his buddies deserves first dibs for going through the hassle) then skulk around in my Hazmat picking off leftovers. I've gotten enough for a few PA mods this way. It's not the flux that's an issue, its the enemy mats (fluids, mass etc). I notice after the Queen most everyone just leaves totally and I have free pickings of ghouls and flux. Shit I even bag a couple of legendaries in deserted nuke zones. 
---
Also with lockpick and hacker at Max a silo launch takes &lt;30mins even for me as a casual player sneaking and looting at the same time. Get the guns to turn on eachother and other robots will save you some ammo. Pros do it in ridiculous times like sub 8mins or something.... 
---
Reddit community what's the record for silo speed run???
---
&gt;.308 handgun would break your wrist, and probably knock you in the head

https://www.tactical-life.com/combat-handguns/smith-wesson-m67-308-special/
---
&gt;308 SMG also literally makes no sense because an SMG is based on handgun calibers.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Black_Knight
---
Also the 5.56 pistol and 12.7mm SMG from New Vegas and the .308 caliber mod for the combat rifle from 4 all prove that wrong. Not to mention 12.7mm is basically a Soviet .50 BMG.
---
I tested it tonight. The random “Fast travel just doesn’t work” bug seems a lot better, but it’s not 100% fixed. The overencumbered respawn issue does seem to be solved.
---
Here with you. That's why at level 300+ my main fun aside of kicking Scorched asses is going to Charleston Capitol, Whitespring Golf Course and Fort Defiance to shred these disgusting pieces of crap into gibs with my Gauss Shotgun. Revenge!
---
Chameleon does stack, both visually and stat-wise. There's a video explaining the breakdown, but I can't find it right now. This is a video showing the power of a full Chameleon Armor build...
---
https://youtu.be/8VZk_TFozwI
---
From what I remember from the other more detailed info, 3 pieces is enough to stay undetected in most circumstances. I'll do more digging and find the one explaining it deeper.
---
I've got nothing against duped presents lol...so 250 it is 🤣
---
Feel free to add xa0t1ca (middle o is a zero). Former electronic music DJ / promoter for \~18 years &amp; typically listen to electronic + other music genres while I play. Lately I've been on my unarmed character the most so I can craft any related mods for you ;)
---
Bloodied needs hard nerfing
---
So I'm by no stretch an expert but those numbers don't sound bad. The SBQ has insane damage reduction. I think this calculator is supposed to be reasonably accurate... Can noodle around with various effects and get an idea of what they're  worth...
---
https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html
---
I have tested this minimally, it seems to align pretty close with what I see on my character, but I can't say for sure. Hopefully someone else will speak up if a better tool exists.
---
If you are pretty much using the decked out commando build, I think you might need to look to a legendary affix like bloodied / junkies / furious / etc to further increase your damage.
---
You don't have to use a fixer, any other auto rifle will do fine as long as you have the powerful or prime auto receiver for it. Assault rifles and combat rifles, even 1\* will do better than a non legendary fixer.
---
Also don't sleep on Adrenaline, using vats to pick off scorched and insects underfoot during the fight can build up a good bit of momentum.
---
You don't remember the super Christmas pack?
---
Ha
---
I get error measses as well from time to time with my PS4. When I do, I close the app, and then fully power down my PS4. When I do this and power it back up issue disappears.
---
The way I've built my sneaky sniper, you rarely get to a point life-wise where the Bolstering kicks in. You pretty much one shot most things except big enemies. In those cases you want as much resistance up front, giving you a chance to sneak away, re-enter stealth, and lose their tracking.
---
Reddit is not a sample of the greater public.
---
I love it when people DJ. Can't help with the mic part though, console gamer
---
I stay undetected with one chameleon/4 unyielding. Anything more than one really is a waste, if your perks are set up correct.
---
I'm in desperate need of a duel drum mag for my MG42 only thing holding it back is magazine size but 50 cal could use some love too
---
It’s just gonna be sweats complaining about your vending.
---
Wastelander's Fanny Pack 
---
Gives the wearer a 10% discount on all plqyer vending items.
---
That revolver article is a misprint, that's a .38 Special revolver.
---
A 12.7 pistol caliber is MUCH different from a rifle caliber. 
---
A 5.56 "pistol" is an AR-15 style firearm with no buttstock and a very short barrel. It is essentially useless except for CQB and "cool guy" factor. Also, it skirts BATFE(Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives) rules on short barrel rifles tax stamp.
---
Yes, there are .50 call pistols and revolvers. They are .50 call pistol rounds, not a .50 RIFLE round.
---
A .50 call Desert Eagle does not use the same round as a .50 call M2 machine gun, or a .50 call sniper rifle.
---
I'm a vet and a gunsmith. I think I may have an idea what I'm talking about.
---
Get someone to mod your lever or find the plan so you can craft and learn them, it's so much more useful than the hunting rifle.  Hunting rifle will do a tad bit more damage but only really works as a sniper rifle.  The lever action lets you run and gun a little, uses a more common ammo and gets really close to the damage output of a hunting.  
---
I fully agree with instigating.  I used an Instigating explosive 1 perception hunting rifle for a long time and it was by far the best gun I had.  Got an Instigating explosive lever after a while and have never touched the hunting rifle since.  Not trying to trash on the hunting rifle as it is a bad ass gun, but I just love lever actions for their speed and versatility.  Still have my hunting rifle if I ever decide to give it a run.
---
Fed 76 is kinda high for some stuff in my opinion. it seems less designed as a price guide and more designed for players to get top caps for their weapons. 
---
What iv found works is unless its something crazy rare or super popular like a 3star instigating lever action or a bloody fixer which raises the price closer to fed 76 levels. 
---
My listing is usually 
---
 ones stars i sell for 500 caps or below depending on whats on it. 
---
Two stars i stay between 800-1,500 
---
Three stars 2,000-4,000
---
I move weapons pretty decently this way. But the better source of caps i found is ammo. I can not keep 5.56, 5mm or 45 in stock very long.
---
But are you running a low-life or a high-life build? If its low, sure, the Agility buff you get makes up for the loss of 4 pieces. If you're running high-life, like I do (and the op apparently), your life rarely gets down to the point where the Unyielding kicks in. I think both are usable...it just depends on your style.
---
Edit. The other factors I  was going to mention are availability of gear and ease of use. If you go the Bloodied Low-Life build you have to spend large amount of time or luck or resources trading for the absolute best armor that everyone else is looking for too...often spending Max caps plus per piece. You go the high life route, you still are looking for specific gear, but it's not the ultimate god rolls that can often cost you Legacies just to trade for.
---
Also, life management is much easier...low-life requires you to be so low on life, constantly worrying about rads killing you quickly. High-life is all about spamming Stims if need be. Much less worrying about where you are life-wise, and more just straight killin'. This is how I view it, and I know Bloodied fans will have a different take on it...but that's my 2 caps on that.
---

I was so psyched to find an accordion....and it isn't playable.
---
I want an accordion so badly.
---
I like UNY and VAN and switch between the two a lot. Currentlym I have SS UNY arms and chest, so I tried to craft a LL yesterday. After 20 tries, nothing. Said screw it and crafted 15 more, ended up with 2 UNY +STR and 2 VAN +STR. Almost a crime to scrap the two extras.
---
You forgot that this is fallout though since when do alot of the firearms in the game make sense? Also would it be bad that a .308 revolver or SMG be added to a game where the only option is ammo chewer or slightly better than black powder reload speed hunting rifle.
---
Smart I guess I should have know that,  chems counter other chems and as bloodied I'm always carrying all kinds of alchohols and psycho I just thought maybe the blackout would still happen but probably not. My internet is on so I'll test that now! Will reply with an update!
---
Lips are sealed. 225* cough cough
---
The economy has already been irrevocably impacted by the duplication. As soon as any hint of the gifts being nerfed gets out, the dupers will just start opening them and moving things over to mules and additional accounts. 
---
The genie is out of the bottle.  As far as the ‘vendor’ problem you cited, you can fix that. Don’t list more value in your vendors than what would put you up to max caps. Manage **your** shop better and they couldn’t impact you negatively. 
---
Here’s an easier fix:  Bethesda gives 48 hour notice that any account that has more than, say, 500 presents will have all those presents automatically opened on the characters they are on. All of them taken out of the stash’s and vendors and placed into the character inventory. Everything gets opened all at once. If they lose caps, oh well. 
---
Those that still have a handful of presents left aren’t overly impacted. Those that are sitting on 25k presents now have an insane amount of weight on their characters.
---
That’s the best compromise. Not just ‘stripping the presents away’. Someone that is only holding on to a few hundred is unlikely to be a duper. 
---
And for the next event, set a max capacity that a character can have at one time. Maybe 500. Sure, they could still be duped. But it would slow them down tremendously and make it an annoying grind. 
---
Alternatively, they could also issue bans to accounts that have over ‘X’ number of presents in their inventory. Let them decide a fair number. Maybe more than 5000 or 10,000. 
---
The point is, Bethesda has a responsibility to address the cheaters. Using a ‘napalm the whole village approach’ simply lets them off the hook more easily. 
---
Why not delete or nerf all the legacy weapons?  95% of those are duped. The players that got their legitimately will just have to accept the sacrifice for the greater good. 
---
Tell me why gifts should be removed or nerfed but legacy weapons shouldn’t.
---
Pure scum
---
Build a trap camp.
---
Yes -- annoying AF.
---
Any idea what and where those 5 spawn points are?
---
Damage in pvp is capped at 110, doesn’t matter what you’re using. Look up how to make punji board stacks. You can blueprint and store them, and when someone wants to be a dick, just open the build menu and drop a stack next to them, instant death.
---
Not OP, but I always assumed Insigating and sneak would result in 3x damage.  Both double the base damage and it's all added up.  Either way it's a great combo.
---
The problem with Julie is that she sounds like a generic person from our universe, in 2020, versus an actual character from the Fallout universe.
---
Weasel would be a hilarious DJ.
---
I smack her at about 450-500 with a Bloodied Handmade at effective range , you should dump the Fixer and get a Good legendary
---
Edit : Head/Face shots
---
This is the way.
---
Dont know bro, i think thats low than being coward...and not a "face to face"...wich is of course what im searching
---
I feel like I need to make another post addressing the need for more mods for heavy weaponry as a whole. 
---
Some people may not agree because heavy weapons are just not as mod dependant as rifles or shotguns, they can still kick some major ass as they are.
---
But I think weapon customization is one of the aspects that make this game good, and heavy weapons simply cannot be left out of this opportunity. 
---
There is so much room for creativity heavy weapons are missing out on, it's unbelievable.
---
Wait what? Can I get a link to a wiki page or something that explains this more in depth?
---
If it helps I ran into the guy at the bottom of the ski lift near top if the world.
---
Pistol build will raise that to crazy levels as I am currently a pistol build and have been on the lookout for this god weapon for pistols. I believe the explosive perk with work with it as well to raise it even more
---
Before you embark on your journey to revenge, first dig two graves - some Chinese dude.
---
We can't freely change shit out at out camps and its annoying at our camps..
---
Pretty sure I've seen it at the antique shop in the bog.
---
Edit: And the clothing store in Charleston.
---
I love how mobile I am with my stealth build + jetpack, I don't think I could go back to not using it, jetpack + marsupial has meant I can climb some crazy places that you can't get upto in PA as the PA jetpack does not offer anywhere near as much lift as the SS one.
---
Ty DC. Appreciate it. I’ll take a look.
---
I'll look for some of those videos. Thanks.
---
Someday a good legendary will come my way. The highlights for today...
---
A 1* junkies machete and a 1* bloodied gamma gun
---
Of probably 25 legendary enemies killed today those were the best drops I got. 
---
The fixer I have is a vampire explosive. Which is great for everything but the queen. My handmade is exterminator so also not a great drop. 
---
But someday...
---
I wouldnt think its at all possible to get a legacy anymore since they dont drop and the cost of getting them is pretty expensive.
---
Basically sneak damage is calculated by the base damage of the weapon. A good way to think of it is getting in two sneak attacks before sneak attack perks are factored in.
---
Yeah, it was expensive to trade for it.
---
I actually did this tonight: had two t65 left legs and two t65 torso all had the equipped square. I didn't even consider the possibility of stacking mods, and because I don't run duplicates for paint I scrapped them.
---
That is awesome... I saw a guy with a sleeping bag on top of a campfire yesterday. He built his camp in a trench in the cranberry bog by watoga. Made me want to make a Hobbit hole from the tunnels by the pylon. Too bad there's Zero space there.
---
Full health stealth commando here with an anti armor fixer here. Make sure to pick off the mobs she spawns to stack your adrenaline plus head shots.
---
There are 2 spots where headwear spawns in the antique shop. Both first floor on wooden shelves in the main shop area.
---
for .308. youre talking battle rifle caliber.
---
something like an M1 
---
the game could use a nice semi auto dedicated marksman rifle anyway,
---
balls. i JUST scrapped the duplicate t65 chest cos i thought it was extra weight
---
🙏🏻
---
Name one thing specific to you that dupers are ruining. I'll wait.
---
.38 =/= .308. .308 is a rifle caliber, .38 is a revolver caliber, they're totally different rounds. .38 is a a thicker, shorter round, whereas .308 is a narrower, but much longer round.
---
I can build you one when I get on tomorrow
---
Alright what time zone you in
---
That sounds like a you problem. If you let the actions of someone else ruin your fun, maybe you should take a step back and revaluate.
---
Lol! Yes!
---
inb4 you need the courier 😳
---
Yes they did. I hate them.
---
NW weapons aren't balanced at all though. It's really the worst game mode for pvp balance. PvP should be 1 part skill, 1 part preparation, 1 part surprise, 1 part gear.
---
Story wise I wanted to go with raiders but I decided foundation simply because I can do 3 raider quests to get rep a day (the one at crater than there are 2 at Ohio River Adventures). Where you can only do 1 of those for foundation and that makes getting max rep with raiders much easier/faster.
---
Awesome, I've run into the other settler defense ones but didn't know about the opossums, I assume because they're classed as hostile but don't actually attack, thats why you can kill 1 and talk to a settler for rep and repeat that process?
---
Dude, does bethesda like you or myself cause I just got an instigating crossbow 7 minutes after starting up fallout 76 today. [Image of crossbow](https://imgur.com/gallery/11Pd6cA)
---
Wanna know something that'll really blow your mind? All the plans from the mole miner event was able to be gotten from presents as well.
---
Yeah,  complicates it as well.  I rarely sneak but it does add damage, not sure how much exactly.
---
edit- misread your comment, edited to only explosive
---
Hope they didn’t think it was the recipe or that consuming it would unlock the recipe... oh well
---
DAMIT! didnt know pvp was cap...ok, well...somehow your advice is usefull, thought i dont like the idea since is not a face to face like i need, still, tks i guess
---
Anybody know what time this will be shown off?
---
I've tried the alcohol trick, didn't work for me
---
And i will take as many with me...(jon wick eyes)
---
It ducks when you grind for something that becomes super common because it a dupe. And, during causes a shit load of other technical problems in the game. And gets vendor shut down, and..well...its just selfish.
---
(The BADTFL regional office requests your location)
---
Weight is never 0. You may need to have a couple thousand to notice the difference. Even Bobby pins have weight
---
mmm...is going to take some time to raise lvl and get the perks...but hell, im willing to try it no matter what, thanks mate
---
What system / console ?
---
PS4
---
The ultracite pa is shit anyway lmao
---
Your fix is highly unlikely. Bethesda has not used any of those tactics. They removed things. They don't give warnings, or flood your inventory. Bethesda has removed things like the Radical Mask effects, even though it upset the community. They can and will damage our feelings regardless of how we feel. Removing caps from the presents would hurt less than 10k people while immediately killing mule accounts created by cheaters. If you don't see the greater good, there's no point in continuing this conversation. 
---
About the legacy weapons: They are getting rebalanced and added back to the loot pool, as stated by Bethesda themselves when they became Legacy in the first place. No one knows when, or if the plans are still in effect. Balance of the Wasteland seems Prime for this.
---
It’s not an easy build I’m letting you know now Bethesda doesn’t give you much to work with when dealing with pistols☹️
---
Hey what? I guess I could just Google around and see so you don’t have to put it all down but that’s interesting to know. I honestly feel like I’m justified if I skip it since I put in the work already lol.
---
Waiting for that post from an angry player claiming to have paid 30k for a doughnut.
---
Mountain, just lemme know when a good time is for you. I can hop on early to knock it out
---
I’m eastern
---
This made me crazy with the Sloth in Fasnacht. Level 100+, 200+, killing the sloth in a few shots. I was so irritated. I knew I wasn't the only one at least I saw a log of angry and thumbs down emotes. It's like dang, let the lower level / noobs get some shoots in too.

Would 4:00 ET work

Turrets hurt your camp more than they help.
---
Enemies don't randomly attack buildings, but do go after turrets. To be clear the game spawns random attacks on your camp where the enemies spawned target your camp buildings when they appear, and enemies can change targets to nearby objects, but random enemies that aren't on a mission to attack your camp will not aggro from distance. I have a camp near a random encounter area by a road and hostiles will happily walk by the road and ignore my camp, but if I place a turret every single one will come attack my camp to get the turret.
---
It is better to surround your camp with a wide range of random hostile creatures than to have turrets, because when the game spawns enemies to attack your camp they will often fight the native creatures, and forget about your camp, wandering in a random direction if they beat the natives, with said natives remaining in their home range if they win.
---
The only time my camp gets attacked is when similar enemies spawn to attack it (ghouls spawning next to ghouls), or if those random enemies spawn in force and crush the natives so fast one of them doesn't join the fight and remembers where my camp is. they do sometimes wander in badly beaten because they just happened in the wrong direction after fighting the locals.
---
It feels good right? So many people do it.  Never seen a game community like this.
---
Yes it’s pretty damn awesome.  No way it’s gonna last forever without a nerf, so good luck getting one soon!
---
100% this. Been trying to explain this to people since the t65 came out out. It's really not any better than t51b
---
Ya the return on those is absurd. I certainly understand the need for a sink but putting in 100 script and only getting 5 back is insane, there should not be a one star from those at all.
---
I was thinking about this the other day when I moved my camp. Because you can have half floor tiles but there's no wall tile to match it.
---
Also a floor tile to fix the gap of the metal stairs would be nice. Going down the stairs is pointless when you can just fall through the gap at the side. Or at least let the stairs be flush against the walls.
---
How long did it take?
---
it never shows the pictures for me
---
I one shotted a Sheepsquach pre mutation with a one star bloodied gauss shotgun without the shotgun perks. I did have my sneak and Covert ops multipliers though.
---
If you're talking about the 2x1 stairs, it works if you place the walls before the staircase.
---
Not much, it was quite easy actually
---
But I guess it was just luck
---
Wait, is the doughnut recipe really that rare? I think I got that recipe during the event - not sure how many times...
---
I’ve been there. I personally created a new character, but both options are viable.
---
Just make sure you understand the basic concept of the build you are following, and have all your perks and level ups planned.
---
I’d you want a guide for a bloodied build, you can follow this one I’ve created. If you want to play with bows it’s just a matter of switching out the rifleman perks for the bow ones.
---
And if you truly wants to learn the ways of the bloodied, keep in touch and I can help you with it
---
https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1KDLtvkwVa7thH-zvXRkxwIs2DNm1a6R-EIltxeFXDVU
---
I will ask I think most of us are xbox though.
---
You never die in a full health build.  Game is way harder bloodied if you don’t sneak 😂
---
Not that I complain about PA here constantly, but I built my character to use PA. I'm not going to spend several levels respeccing it to not use PA, especially when I don't have a full set of Unyielding armor pieces.
---
So, I'll keep using the PA.
---
I’m bloodied rifle and am highly op. I try my hardest to share legendaries by switching to a bloodied 10mm pistol. It does 125 dmg and allows me to stay in stealth.
---
no
---
How do you manage to die when you kill everything with one tap?
---
I completely agree with this. I mean, jukeboxes turn on automatically. Why not the radio?
---
I now realize wtf all the explosions I saw one time were.  Someone made an explosion ring around a large area of the event.  I thought it was a glitch.  Great idea.
---
Same
---
Yeah I’m semi auto rifle and all my bloodied pipe rifles hit hella hard. My b3325 .38 has a base of 200 something. If you’re in sneak you can still one shot a lot of mobs with it. I switch to a 10mm bloodied pistol for sharing kills.
---
It currently beats pretty much any non modded gun in the game. 
---
It's going to be nerfed. Only a matter of time.
---
Ight I’ll hop on around 8am your time. Just shoot me a message on Xbox and I’ll hop into your world GT is DatDamnTexan
---
Seriously? Looks like this may be the future for me. Google it is i guess. I get anxiety looking up items because i’m scared they will log off lmao
---
Alright I’m on now so I’ll add you
---
Yea it irks me. That adventure mode has all this perk balancing for what???
---
Why does it matter my chems way less and I can carry more cause my strong back and that I can pick level three locks? God forbid being able to have those equipped along with all my combat perks.
---
This goes for everything, hate having to switch to ammo Smith and chemist etc.
---
Pretty sure that came with last update to address server lag. Not having to render hundreds of items frees up alot of processing power
---
Ok,  im gonna hook you up with a spare Furious limb damage Handmade later when i get from work and been to the store with the kids, cant go round embarrasing yourself with a bug shooting handmade lol ;) 
---
I'll pm my psn
---
Plastic maybe but you could just go to Morgan town hs
---
1. When looking at my stash, be able to filter out my vending. You can do it when looking at vending but not thr other way...
---
2. Separate clothes from armor in stash and inventory lists.  
---
3. When putting things in vending, stop scrolling all the way up.  I know what I jist listed,  I dont need to see it in my face and lose my place.
---
Got it, thanks!
---
So then where's all the weight at?
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/eWiFY20](https://imgur.com/a/eWiFY20)
---
No, you’ll be fine
---
Isn’t “new arrivals” for level 20 though? I’m just nervous to rush up there when I still have the main story to do
---
Some people just really love doughnuts.
---
No. All the recipes had the same rarity.
---
I recently got a full set of Unyielding urban scout armor. Mostly 1* pieces but it’s all max level and it all matches, I’m happy with it.
---
Thanks for the build info, but I’m actually thinking of going with another build I got from a discord server, the build doesn’t focus on bloodied but I’ve heard about how obscene the damage can be
---
Hunters are lobster
---
Happened to me once, clicked on install and the game just opened instead of downloading
---
If anyone else is curious, last year in quakecon they released a concept art for that specific armor.
---
https://imgur.com/oziI5OE
---
That said, does anyone know who's the artist?
---
Hey are you on PC? I can craft you full moded weapon and armor for free if u want.
---
such a well thought out post, filled with counterpoints.  must have taken some time to find and press those three whole keys for it.
---
Upvote for knowing who FLW is.
---
Heard so much hype and praise about the SS Jetpack, so since I bought everything I actually wanted already, i got the jetpack. 
---
It's definitely underwhelming imo. No where near deserving of the hype it gets, but to each their own. I'm gonna trade it in for the lead lined mod probably.
---
I'm almost there, same situation.  Got 2 Vanguard and 4 Unyielding full health build.  I do find that hanging on to an unyielding set or piece to be useful if you need to pass speech checks or want max out of selling things to the bots.  Still only have gotten 1 fall damage piece so I'm just using the Vanguard chest, but should be around 850 DR once it's complete.
---
5mm weighs 0.001 or 0.0001 with 2x bandolier so those 100k rounds still weigh 10lb with bandolier.
---
Xbox. Thanks for the offer though
---
Bethesda needs to get off their damn asses and make some basic public event loot/XP sharing that *every damn MP game these days already does*.
---
People might legit not be aware of how ass backwards 76 is in its systems that loot and XP *doesnt get shared* in public events. It's asinine that Bethesda still uses this archaic system that does no one favors in a game built around killing things fast.
---
Buttressed is the best for secret service, above hardened. I bought the hardened and realized mistake later. Hope this saves you!
---
Awesome, thanks for the help!
---
I didn’t even know that power armor had speeds
---
The god damn .308 receivers from FO4 for the ARs!!!! They wouldn’t be so useless to commando builds who already have better handmade rilfes.
---
No idea why you're getting downvoted when the core cause really is 76's outdated mechanics that games solved years back. The fault lies entirely on them for having this system in the first place.
---
Great camp. This message will self destruct in 5 seconds. *Left an active mini nuke in the mailbox*
---
After getting the jetpack to check it out, it's pretty meh. It is definitely over hyped, I'm sure it's fun if you decide to use every perk, ability, and aid item to give you as much AP as you can get. But that's a bit tedious just to fly up really high for no reason. 
---
I'd get something more useful like the dense mod or lead lined mod.
---
Same didn't work. Shame tho
---
No.  I always scrap them if I pick them up because they tend to be heavier than if they are on a chassis (i.e. a chassis with pieces is 10 carry weight, each piece individually is around 10 carry weight).
---
However, other than weight reduction, you don't get any mods and little, if any, junk.  
---
PA modification plans can be dropped by the Queen, bought at the vendors, and can be found at treasure locations.
---
Sometimes when Im really bored I'll use a voice modifier to give me a really deep voice and act like Frank Horrigan around random people.
---
There is an Atom challenge to make/scrap PA pieces.
---
You can only damage a camp if you and the camp owner are both at the camp and reciprocated pvp, otherwise you either do zero damage (or if you're in workshop pvp with them the items show damage but autoheal and can't be totally destroyed).
---
And the mouth harp. Already in game. Make it craftable.
---
thanks for the info
---
Yeah handmades have basically rendered the AR useless
---
I suppose that makes sense but at the same time the looks of something plays a big role sales.
---
Green:  ok to build and place
---
Green:  see above, but something is bugged and we won’t let you place the item
---
Your best bet is to use the industrial water purifiers.  However, as has been mentioned, you need a decent sized body of water to put down enough purifiers.  The far left side of the map has the river.  I've never tried placing a CAMP along it, but it should only have low level enemies.
---
In addition, you could take a workshop and build a bunch of medium size water purifiers.  These seemed to fill faster than the CAMP purifiers.
---
Heck the real life m2 browning also came in different forms like a lighter or heavier barrel version or the ww2 airplane version with a higher rate of fire.
---
The Chems and Gauss rifle are slept on, but busted.
---
With proper investment, a fully charged Gauss oneshots. With a bobble head and the right magazine and chems, it oneshots to the body fully charged and to the head uncharged. 
---
Bufftats are extremely strong. It gives you 50 hp for 6 mins with Chem fiend. Combined with life giver and power or marine armor, you will literally have too much bulk to die.
---
The scoped lever also is super strong and capable of oneshots to the head, but also has tiny hip spread, and it works almost like a shotgun.
---
The lower tier weapons are seriously trash. Pistols and the like just suck. 
---
The Auto Laser Pistol, while a purple weapon, was much better in its first form with the beam splitter. 
---
M79 cheese strats are still really strong. 
---
The tesla rifle has more range than most sniper rifles, and shoots as fast as you can spam.
---
You're correct, green does mean that and you should be able too. It's just a very common bug with this game.
---
You should do a power cycle and a database rebuild, it helps with this type of error.
---
Legendary armor cultists and stealth junkies love talking shit about power armor.  They say it takes no skill at all to be a tank, but wearing combat armor with magic powers that make you impossible to kill somehow makes you more skillful as a player. 
---
I have nothing against legendary armors by the way. I have a commando build who wears full set of Vanguard armor and never uses power armor.   My main character is a heavy weapons build who stays in power armor mainly because of the stabilized perk and power armor just looks cool and has role play potential. 
---
So just to be clear I am not trashing builds without power armor. I am just pointing out a weird phenomenon I have seen since Fallout 4, maybe even 3.  Non PA players often have a weird superiority complex which isn't warranted, because legendary armors can be even more OP than power armor in some cases.
---
I just run over and bash the legendary when that happens.
---
It can also spawn in Morgantown. On the metal bookshelves on the main road where all the tents are. Dont see it that often but this is wherebive managed to get them.
---
Strangler also has lag effects.  Maybe it's been fixed, but the last time I used a set I was lagging badly.  I switched back to Ultacite and it was like night and day.
---
I've heard that works. Do you have to place a floor panel where the stairs will be then put the two walls, then delete the floor panel? The shitty part about the stairs is once you place them you can't remove them or you have to trash the whole structure :(
---
The front desk at the DMV is a headgear spawn, there's also one on the bench, up the hill, behind the enclave bunker entrance. And there's one by the door to the pleasant valley station right under the skeleton on the suitcase.
---
I split my gold with raiders only and now  they admire me and want me to join their raids and all  
---
We are like a disfunctional psycho family
---
It was fixed with wasetlanders, and by fixed I mean they nerfed it so hard the damage is about nothing now. And it only ever lagged me in the Queen or the imposter
---
It's a shame they haven't fixed it yet, it still removes your facial hair, hair and you can't wear any masks/gas masks, eyewear with it.
---
On the bright side at least you don't have to scrap a lot to learn all the mods...could be worse
---
Welcome to Fallout my friend.
---
I came to F076 from Division 2, and would recommend avoiding the game like the plague - it's exponentially worse than F076.
---
Yea.... Building in Fallout 76 is daft at times. Sometimes you can use the daftness to your advantage, other times it's frustrating. "It just [doesn't/might] work(s)"
---
Nope
---
Yeah I was hoping for the vertiguard pack but maybe next week
---
After learning the fixer plans I got a legendary fixer after a few tries at the legendary purveyor.  It was a Hunters, or something similar, and I stupidly turned it back in.  
---
The next one I got, after much trying and about 6 months later, was a Quad Explosive...  Still my favorite...  but I've picked up a few more since.
---
Some have argued that your best chance at one is to spend your script on 2 star weapons rather than 3 star.  The theory is that you will get more random tries so you have a greater chance at getting one as it's cheaper for the 2 stars.
---
FYI:  A fixer is basically a Combat rifle with the added sneak attributes.  So, if you don't sneak much, then a good legendary Combat rifle would do just fine until you get a Fixer.
---
Yes please
---
What about a tse handmade?
---
I couldn't care less about what they say to me. I sided with the Raiders and made sure to kill as many of them before stabbing them in the back and keeping everything for myself. Crater doesn't have a lot of characters for me. *smirk*
---
With pvp being as broken as it is, if you’re not setup to battle, I’d definitely not feel shame about trapping them 😆
---
I feel you, whenever I’m looking to buy cosmetics I have to look up the item on google every time.
---
What’s the third on it?  Vamp fixer is a decent weapon. Not massively sought after. Tse does more damage and mist run the regen mutation making the vamp perk irrelevant. I’d say a Tse would maybe get it. Depends on what the sellers perception of value on the vamp is.
---
Of course im not, i mean...i aim to play against the world and be nice to everione...not pvp...but hell, they push you to do this...
---
Average PA is not just excavator. Every other PA is outclassed if you have a backpack along with any armour. This is a average case, agree?
---
Hell, even naked with back pack, carries more than average PA.
---
I haven't looked into DR or ER so I can't say much about it. I use X01 on my bloodied character in nuke zones and because dodgy or serendipity (can't remember witch one, maybe both?) doesn't work in PA I'm about just as tanky in and out of PA.
---
Oh man, I have several great SMGs that I'd like to use but can't because of the lack of suppressor and subpar sights. It really is a missed opportunity.
---
The only time I use PA is for the Queen, Encryptid (i.e. Imposter Sheepsquatch), farming flux in a Nuke Zone (any PA is fine for this), and for farming lead ore (Excavator PA).  
---
So yeah, it lagged for me during the important events, which was enough for me to ditch it.
---
It’s fmswa and someone offered me this, is it a steal?
---
For vending machines it's probably more accurate estimate to price things at about 50% of what fed76 says, when it comes to the average legendary that isn't useless, but not particularly sought after.
---
It tends to undervalue explosive weapons, and the most popular weapon types, doesn't account for weapons that are hot because they do more damage than they should etc.
---
Well. If your going to use the Tse then I’d say yes. If your looking for a trade item then the price is similar and I’d say the Tse is probably the more sought after. Bear in mind neither are going to make much headway in getting a high end bloodied or junkies
---
I’m just trying to make sure I get a fair deal
---
yea...when i was low level i was like "hell i will be a gunslinger headshoting mutants!"...until you see the perks...and then one went like "...mm...ok...im doing dmg in the same amount a Roach does to a YaoGuay"....to bad, really bad.
---
Are you going to use the Tse handmade?
---
I plan on it
---
Then yes
---
There are 5 radios around the chair
---
Pretty accurate
---
Idk, was very young. Maybe it was a 386 or a colour monitor was more expensive?
---
Yes, but I believe the fixer has a slightly higher base damage than the regular combat rifle, and also weighs slightly less.
---
Any legendary fixer is better than the non-legendary crafted one.
---
I have a junkies vats/sneak attack build, so I'm guessing that the fixer with the junkies talent would be best in slot for that build.
---
If the other handmade is executioners its better then the tse. Trust me on this..... However i feel the vamp fixer is worth more then either of them.
---
Why is it better?
---
I don’t get why they didn’t just arc the backpack handles outwards. 
---
Sitting down it would make sense for it to go onwards and poke you in your neck and back. 
---
Also wish its eyes flowed now and then
---
it would need to be instanciated by player: the door would lead to your private space and you would have no way to tell the game that you want to go to the private space of an other player.
---
I haven’t used Final Word against SBQ, but I know a Furious Gatling Gun I use, with all Heavy Gunner Perks &amp; Stabilized does around 45-50
---
Yet, unarmed melee, Like my bloodied DCG or Mole Miner Gauntlet do around 3k damage/ w melee perks &amp; sneaks. 
---
I seem to do better unarmed. Solo queens are much faster and easier
---
Aw dammit. So far I'd managed to keep my FO76 game to a single character.
---
But being able to build multiple different CAMPs with different characters?!?
---
THAT might inspire me to create a new one... or two... or three...
---
Yes, it does have a bit more base damage, 48 vs 40 for the combat rifle.  The Fixer has a +4 base carry weight compared to the combat rifle.
---
I feel the same way in real life. Like, why decorate your house all nice and then lock it so I can't enjoy your nice couch.
---
The ad is from a bot and revenue generated goes to Reddit. The mods don't have control over what gets advertised, they should however try to do something to address it.
---
AA effects works of Queen just fine. They just don't work like you think they do. Instead of writing am essee about it i just tell you this.. AA effect by itself only adds 28.88% damage if the target has enough DR (armor) to penetrate. On lower level mobs who don't have enough armor, it is less. And AA effects are not just added together, instead AA (50) + Stabilized (45) perk is equal to 72.50%.
---
Check out this link. I made a comparison between two 50 cals, Anti armor legendary and a non-legendary. Both using damage related perks and stabilized for added penetration. Scroll all the way down to the bottom of the screen to see the actual effects on Queen. Also, you can see the effects of AA in the lower DR's.
---

This is fantastic.
---
This
---
just curious what is base damage without adrenal on that bloodied?
---
Interesting
---
Green means that it can typically be placed.
---
However....  You will run into problems like intersection with another object, etc.
---
I recently moved my CAMP for my main character to the streams near Top of the World and it reminded me why I started building over larger bodies of water instead of on land.  
---
When building over water You don't have to worry about collision with rocks, trees, and uneven terrain.  You just have to check under the water to make sure that there isn't a jeep, truck, etc. under where you plan to build.  Makes building a whole lot easier.
---
I was hoping i didn't have to explain.... tse shows the dmg number in pip boy that it will do if both bullets hit the target. However you need to be real close to hit both bullets. Executioners works at what ever range. So unless your good to shoot it at the range of a short db shotty. Ex is overall better then tse. If you do believe me. Get any cheap tse weapon and try shooting it at different ranges and you will see what i mean
---
The raiders are better story wise but foundation is better for the end game because you can complete 3 daily quests for the raiders every day (1 from crater and 2 from Ohio River Adventures) but foundation only has the 1 quest for day. Plus if a raider stole the equipment from foundation you can convince them to pay you and put in a good word for you at crater in exchange for letting them keep the item (this will make you lose rep with foundation so its not recommended but your choice). That makes it much faster/easier to get rep with raiders than it is for foundation.
---
I don’t play NW it’s a trash BR. Ur a salty bitch omg stop commenting. I do have an 18 kill game with 0 nukes launched tho when the BR first came out before everyone was frog legging grenade lil bitches. I’m assuming that’s your meta. Get off me kid, stop commenting on my post ur a str8 fuckin clown boy 🤡 hop off my nuts
---
It's bad lol I also find it funny how people have the fed76.info in letters posted on their vendors or walls too.
---
Where?
---
Because PA makes an already laughably easy game a completely braindead game.
---
And because it's probably the most iconic thing from this entire IP?
---
And that probably was u in the corner at the end of my 18 kill game 🐀 😂
---
Yeah, but it’s not that inaccurate right? I rolled with a tse Gatling gun and 50 and I didn’t have two many problems as long as I aimed down sights
---
That’s the build I run, spec for heavy weapons , unarmed will work just fine with heavy perks in place.
---
Get rid of 5 int points and run with one of the perks not both
---
Add more into luck so many useful perks there
---
Im not going to try win you over. Take it or leave it i own both those handmades. I would choose executioners EVERY time.......
---
Thanks for your insight. You’ve been very helpful
---
It's not like they had clearly delineated top speeds like 50kph vs 60kph. But there was a fo4 loading screen that said the t-51 had the fastest movement speed, and the X01 had superior damage resistance, but was much slower. I definitely noticed it in FO4, but since I haven't used any armor other than XO1 in the past 135 levels, I don't know if that holds true in fallout 76.
---
Boy you’re Collection looking look like the Power Rangers
---
I don't know what it is without Adrenal. Equipped it was doing a thousand and change.
---
Last I checked the only thing that determines if a weapon benefits from shotgunner is if it shoots shotgun shells. So yeah, it'd be a rifle, one that drains durability five times faster.
---
I got one
---
Np. Get a 1*tse and try it with rifles. You will see what i mean
---
Haha dang dude what hacks do you use? Geez.
---
If it's balanced like NW expect everyone to use explosive builds. Everyone will be running around with Auto Grenade Launchers and Missile Launchers.
---
Theres a lot going on here. Firstly, the SBQ has a blanket 70% reduction to incoming damage. This reduction is applied before her resistances, so you have to factor that in. If your pipboy damage 67, then right off the bat you're doing 20 damage before armor penetration. Her defense is 300, and your armor piercing comes out to 72% ([1-.5] x .45), so her effective defense is 84. You're rolling 20 damage versus 84 DR, resulting in some number less than 20 damage as your final amount (exact number is tricky). So its plausible to be doing 17 damage with your weapon and build.
---
I can't read the letters.  What does the message say?
---
Hello,  
---
If you are running steam, check tegridy of files :D ( integrity )
---
There is nothing better than a gamer crunching numbers and applying formulas. Thanks for the explanation tho, did not know this.
---
Do you want anything for it? My psn is athenasprinqs :)
---
Ok that makes sense
---
If you make your body super skinny it doesn’t clip
---
thanks for the advice. does batteries included work for fusion and plasma cores? thats the only reason i have it in but im not sure if it does
---
In short, no...
---
First, some weapons only scale in the 5's, so the max level you would get for these weapons is level 45.  The ones that scale in the 10's will go up to level 50.
---
Second, it depends on the level of the enemy.  If the enemy is at level 40 (i.e. uranium fever, because mole miners are capped at level 40) then you will get max level 40 weapons.
---
Third, most event rewards, such as the 50 cal for the Wastelanders quest and All Rise for Mayor for the Day, do scale.  Some others may not.
---
Finally, the main reason to get to level 50 is so that when you trade in script for random weapon picks you get max level legendaries.  If you have learned the Fixer plan and/or the new weapon plans that came with Wastlanders, then you also have a chance of these dropping and, if they do, you'll get max level weapons.

It's a good way to tell when you've found a godroll item (or what was a godroll at one point in time), but otherwise they're always too high. I've tried to use their prices for stuff but my sales were so slow it wasn't worth it. I went weeks without selling any armor or weapons, had to lower the prices by half to start moving anything.
---
They also miss the bus on a lot of newer stuff and "currently bugged in your favor" items that are worth a lot for the moment.
---
It's more than merely annoying. The new item naming rules have vastly increased the number of items with names that are too long for the crappy UI to display them in their totality. This makes the Inspect action the only reliable way to find out what, exactly that item is. And Inspect is no longer available in the vendor interface - I'm fairly sure the change happened at the same time as the removal of the item preview.
---
This, quite frankly, means that I am unlikely to buy armor pieces from a player vendor until that bug is fixed.
---
It does, I made a choice to go with ballistic weapons and only use PA in SBQ fights, I run SS vanguards for day to day so don’t need to worry about cores
---
You return to your camp and open your mailbox. You find the 'You have been insulted' note. "Huh", you think to yourself. Then you hear a familiar clanking behind you.
---
"Target acquired."
---
The speed is uniform in this game, but power armor has a negative modifier on speed, so you'll be moving slower than a player outside power armor, even with speed demon. Emergency protocols helps offset this a bit, but it requires low hp.
---
thanks ill try, sometimes i shoot the turrets on the sealing and i dont get hitamrkers is that a bug or what, if u know thanks
---
They're aware that it's missing, along with other missing mods from FO4. Hope we'll see them patched in in the next big DLC.
---
And only one is reasonable to equip for most people.
---
Concise and to the point.
---
Not sure about that one, for those turrets I have a lever rifle which is what I use for when accuracy is needed.
---
I still need answers to my other questions so i dont know why the down vote
---
Gauss shotgun uses 2mm and is still using shotgun perks 😉
---
Only what is a shotgun as a base weapon, uses shotgun perks. Pump action, double barrel, combat shotgun and gauss shotgun.
---
Yup! This guy gets it! Fallout 76 is surely the best game to have ever been released (ha. controversial) and it’s why I hold it with such high standards and shit like this feels like a kick in the knee.
---
Wacky build. 3 lvl 1 heavy gunner cards is more dmg then 1 maxed card
---
If you're playing on Windows 10 and using onedrive it may be something to do with that, I had some weird issues with it recently where it was loading up an old ini from around release and as such the game wouldn't launch. The images are saved in the same location as the ini file, perhaps one drive is uploading them and deleting them locally or something? Long shot, but I dunno what else to try, hopefully someone who knows more than I will add their 2c worth soon.
---
But scrip is always useful
---
Same bug on PC here. It's been like this for two weeks!
---
I seen a full bloodied build get it over 2k base damage... that is before the glitch, and any on hit modifiers
---
I was wondering about the gauss shotgun. I havnt got that far yet.
---
hey thats good advice. i probably wouldnt have thought of that
---
Flaming pitchfork, chainsaw flamer?
---
But there isnt 12.7mm ammo
---
The assets already exist, they just need to be ported from fo4
---
Oh sweet
---
Still not patched on PC. Does Bethesda know about this bug? Is there somewhere I can report the bug to them?
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.

If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.
---
Yeah just checked again... still bugged. Smh. Come on Todd work what little magic you have left!
---
But im talking about the bow to you. The one with the string that you pull back while a sharp stick was connected to it to launch the sharp stick a far distance to kill a thing
---
PLEASE GIVE THEM TO US
---
It's a very devastating weapon which luckily does a lot of damage outside VATS, so it can be used to one-hit-kill most mobs (all shotguns are broken outside of VATS causing health jumping back up on mobs after each hit). VATS is broken in two ways... 
---
* You miss point blank with gauss weapons constantly unless you exit and enter VATS again
---
* You do crazy damage with some legendary effects, way more than intended
---
So they are actually rather annoying to use... Outside of VATS only the gauss shotgun is effective. Inside VATS most shotguns deal expected damage, with some effects causing massive damage (think one-shotting lvl68 super mutants without any perks) and the gauss shotgun missing constantly even with 95%.
---
Please help. i cant speak to commander Daguerre after getting the flight recorder data every time i go back to speak to her and she just says "oof this place isnt helping my back" or just cant be interacted with. - From the look of it on the subreddit it seems that many are having this issue on Console and PC. I'm on PC btw
---
I’ve been invited to a team and after 10-15 mins booted from the team to find posters all over my walls in my camp absolute piss take, luckily I was very close to the build limit so they couldn’t put too much down
---
you can 1 headshot most mooks especially with sneak/covert operative but often without (though might take 2 shots in some cases)
---
solid sustained dps vs bosses like sbq.
---
No rad balancing and don't need any special perks to make it work beyond whatever you'd normally use.
---
So overall imo it's a generally better setup.  
---
Instigating will deal more damage on the 1st shot though as inst = 100% damage vs full health, and junkies is 50% damage period.  Psychobuff can get you to 75% in a pinch and ballistic bock to 90% though I spose nothing stopping the instigating setup from using those as well.
---
Glad to see a post talking about this... I have lost all hope in this game, not that I really had any at all to begin with. Which sucks because this game could be my favorite game, if it was implemented by a company that understands the importance of playtesting game breaking glitches before they release them to the public. 
---
Just a bucket filled to the brim with god damn disappointment this game is... is there any news regarding a new engine being implemented anytime soon? Or is Bethesda considering selling the company? These are the questions I’m at now with this game and the future of any game that comes out of Bethesda. 
---
They desperately need to put these games in the hands of developers and creators that can actually put forth narratives and characters that people give a shit about. I fear that Bethesda simply doesn’t have the patience, desire, or vision to create something that people will actually enjoy and not shit on. It seems they are decent in certain areas of game development, but horse shit in many critical areas. They have so much misused talent at their disposal, it hurts my nostalgic heart.
---
I had that same issue. If you press the buy button but don’t actually press “yes’ on the confirmation screen, it lists the whole name of the gear bit
---
Thank you for proving my point that team building is such a trash concept with teams, there really needs to be not only a no building with public teams, but also simply just a "building permissions" tag on standard teams.
---
It’s not coming with Update 20, sooo we don’t know atm, even The Colossus event
---
I use it to puke on peoples shoes when they irritate me #adulting
---
The wastelander power rangers called power raiders
---
They suck unless you get a nice legacy or a nice ffr one. My bffr does 225 dmg it’s pretty close to my combat rifles dmg. On my rifleman I have a BE laser that melts everything. I’ve heard the junkies frr and JEs do a lot of dmg as well. I had an AAE ultracite and an IE regular laser and I wasn’t a fan of those rolls.
---
They are ones of a few enemies that remain dangerous in the game especially if you cannot deal with them quickly. 
---
Shooting at their legs is helpful. Make sure you have some cover before engaging. They can still use the face laser even when their legs are crippled.
---
bethesda's good side lol
---
Ok so i was running a junkie/bloody hybrid. Basically a bloody build with addiction for the extra damage. Just swapped off yesterday due to getting a decent bloody weapon.
---
With full adrenal and sneak damage I was doing 2.7k to mobs with headshots and about 530 to SBQ crit headshot, 340 base.
---
It all depends on how you are going to play though. You just getting the addiction and stopping or you gonna go full junkie with chems up to you.
---
Release date is unkown.. But I hope they come into being when they are.. lets say a little bit more legendary, less useless any way less grindy.
---
Um...Am I the only one who can't read what it says?
---
Why do you regret it?
---
Only Purveyor can give you one and the daily ally quest, if it is the weapon cache one.
---
Quests and legendary enemies can't. The only exception was Fasnacht reward at the end - it was also giving a legendary out using the Purveyor loot pool.
---
You could go to the wall above it, snap a half wall to the left to that one, snap a full wall below that one, snap a half wall to the right of that one, attach a slanted roof above it, snap the wedge to the roof, then try to delete all the extra. Build order is key. I can show you if you're on PS4
---
Torches no, but like those lanterns we see all over the place? I’d 100% use one, I don’t care what I have to give up. I hate the green light from the pip-boy, would like a nice glow.
---
Thanks for the tips those are great! I didn't even know you could kill off the heads, though I think the shrieker effect is hilarious! I'm a shotgun/pa wi heavy gunner build (the easiest thing to play I guess), so that suits me well. I just need to stock up on a lot more ammo or hope that someone else is around then next time I encounter it.
---
Can confirm - a chainsaw flamer with an extended bow bar puts off about 2-metres of light
---
You can’t.  Tried it myself.
---
Have you just started playing/replaying FO76? Curious, because I felt similarly after leaving Div 2, but then when I played around a month of FO76 Wastlelanders, it got so so so old, boring, then depressing (because I had high hopes). 
---
I completely ran out of content in both games in under a month...
---
Yeah I saw a video of people taking it down with the Gauss mini, I'll only try and get that after I finish my Strangler Heart PA (just a left leg left) and get a Gauss shotgun. Well, if I manage to finish off this rep grind.
---
This. And the worst is when you do his daily and the target circle is pretty much 30 meters to the right of Foundation. Like, seriously Ward, you couldn't just walk over there by yourself?
---
He's incompetent, lazy and annoying. I'd much rather get my dailies from one of the Sunny bots.
---
If the laser has a stock it uses rifle perks, if it has a grip it uses pistol perks - even with the splitter they still use rifle/pistol perks based on their handle, and the weapon does not benefit from Enforcer (though Tormentor/Modern Renegade work)
---
If that was directed at me, you may have me confused with someone else, I've never streamed. In my life! Wouldn't even know where to begin.
---
Try using a mining helmet. They have great built-in headlamps.
---
Right now im just running a sneak vats rifleman. Iv Been toying with the idea of running a junkie build since i pulled a junkie lever action with increased vats headshot today.  I can’t run bloody. Way too clumsy. Might have to give a junkie a try at least. Thanks
---
Definitely have to give it a try then thank you
---
Remember this unfairness, you will miss it.
---
My current and only weapon worth mentioning--Zealot +33% vats hit +30% vats cost reduction (not sure how correct my number are btw) handmade. Not great but against scorched in the bog I feel semi strong and cut down those patrols that respond to their ultracite being touched. Against everything else I just get cheap vats which is better than nuthin.
---
LOL
---
Reason I haven't logged into the game in a week, exhibit C.  Laser rifles suck, and they have sucked since beta.   And yes I mean legendary laser rifles too-  with legendary effects that work great on ballistic weapons.
---
Shut up about legacy laser rifles.  They are irrelevant to people who don't want to trade with extremely shady people and/ or people who like to earn their own gear through grinding.
---
I had some help with some super mutants, but they didn't last long, how did you lure it out of the Grove? I saw some other people managed to get it to fight the SBQ. I couldn't get it to moved from inside the Grove though. Might have been for the best not sure how long I would've lasted out in the open.
---
Aw bummer still? Thought they may have fixed that. Ty
---
Not accurable at all.
---
alot
---
Np, also I'd think twice about gun fu. When your melee you won't need tons of vats and most targets won't cluster enough for it, and when your heavy gunning you won't have enough ap for more then 1 kill.
---
No, though it is the most damaging
---
Watoga high is where it’s at
---
You're lucky that you didn't find gorillas everywhere.
---
It's really not that big a deal though, you just scrap them.
---
Yeah, to my mind it's only worth it as part of a Silo/SBQ effort, but it's something I haven't yet done, so like most things in this game, that's the drive! 
---
A bit sad, but true, haha.
---
Sounds like you've got on the secret formula, haha!
---
Thanks! It is a bit edited for visibility though. Not sure you can take too many bad shots in this game tbh.
---
So with perks 🙄
---
Dang. I feel like i might have wasted my time with the gauss pistol. But went all in on the raiders. Well at least ill have something to look forward too. Now i can focus on the settlers.
---
Got a ghoul slayers the fixer from a three star scorchbeast.
---
I think out in the open it'd be a different story, but I still had to deal with like 20+ wendigo spawn, which I didn't even get to loot! all those screws and HRF's all gone to waste. :'(
---
In any case I'm determined to destroy it now, haha. It'll give me a reason to start running silos more earnestly, God knows what I'll do after this though, haha.
---
Drop all the ammo, the weight in your inventory shouldn’t change, but it does
---
Might be worth looking at the PTS forum on Bethesda’s site.  Should give you an idea of how it’s progressing.
---
Which tonics ya'll try? You can't do it with prewar drinks like vodka, whiskey ext. Needs to be new stuff like ballistic boc, lead Champaign, or tick blood tequila.
---
Bloodied builds are litteraly tanks these days they are way more op then any other build in this entire game.
---
Those number are pretty old. Thats even before they nerfed the tesla
---
np.  take 5 addictions frome this list whatever you think will damage your build the least: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Addiction 
---
Remember that you don't suffer the negative of whatever you are high on.  psychobuff is life :P
---
Thanks.
---
I once transfered a Bloodied 25 Handmade from my main to an alt... That few minutes between putting it in a mailbox in Huntersville and returning with the another character praying it was still there.. my god.
---
Thanks now i dont have to put points into enforcer.
---
No glitching
---
Thanks
---
How do you transfer items ? If you are using private servers, you can just drop it into paper bag.
---
If you are using adventure mode servers, you are just insane :)  
---
Tbh : If you are role playing, how do you explaing this ,, muling ,, ? But i guess everyone has their set of rules.
---
Anyone currently building the Strangler Heart armor needs the ultracite mod plans, so the rare ones are becoming increasingly valuable.
---
If you don’t get it let me know.
---
if they introduced cold weather mechanics and the threat of freezing on top of pvp hell yeah
---
100% agree!
---
Thx for clarifying!
---
thatll get your blood pumpin for sure haha
---
Or 20 steel for 2 pounds, depends.
---
Never, ever use paper bags for transfers, even on private worlds - only unlimited containers - there are plenty of them everywhere.
---
TL:DR
---
You are all idiots, I am better than you. 
---
You are playing it wrong (ie not like me).
---
&amp; you are why the game is rubbish
---
Gotta love hunting those among dozens of half used fusion and plasma cores!
---
I didnt know you could paper bag it, I always use a container. good to know! 
---
sadly its me irl role playing having nice things haha.
---
you make a strong point, i just figured it would be legendary since if an auto fire laser or gatling laser/plasma with much lower recoil would be pretty dominant but truth be told i just want non-gauss or non-5.66m weapons to be viable for "end game" instead of being noodles
---
You can get rid of demo expert or bring it down to r2 to make room for nerd rage. Demo expert dose not give much extra damage
---
Pushed till after update 20 now so they can change them a bit
---
I was using this kind of transferring for months, never lost a single bullet, not to mention more valuable items. And I moved almost all my OP gear from one mule to another when I decided my mule become 3rd playable character. Just use private world, turn off ability to join by friends (at least for the time of transferring), find infinite container and voila. Ohh, and don't screw by joining public in the mean time - you'll lost everything that was on the private.
---
A barrel mod for the .4 that made it look more like a DEagle.
---
Actually really annoying me now :( they’re really cool icons
---
It would be nice if the grenades also activated other people's artillery if you are close enough. That way it would be more useful as you travel around the map and would incentivize people to build them to help each other out. 
---
As to damage, yeah they aren't super useful. I use mine just for a change of pace and to kill some of the camps on the way to Foundation.
---
No not a huge problem just a pain in the arse, wouldn’t mind gorillas everywhere I don’t have the plan I’d have kept 1
---
Yeah my guns are all ffr fr, so I could probably ditch lock n' load for blocker 1
---
I usually find something underneath the multi scopes. Found mine near silo bravo
---
Hope not in the current state - for me, the currently available cards, at least some of them, are of medium usefulness. Besides that, the system of converting unnecessary cards to Perk points is very ill-considered (both in terms of the number of points obtained for removing unwanted cards, as well as those animated and non-animated cards).
---
no game really does seasons well because they treat them as replacements for actual content when they are far from an adequate replacement. people who are bored out of their mind right now won't become less bored just because you add some new rewards to the same shit they've already been doing.
---
Yeah, it is so weird. Using it without the iconic barrel feels so wrong.
---
Yeah I agree, or at least change the color like fallout 4, a white light really was cool or red or purple
---
Yeah, I usualy mule my items in front of Rusty Pick or vault 76. And yes, in paper bags, I have never had problem with it :)  
---
But when I found out, i was using containers too, nervous, palms sweaty ... as time goes, you take it just like another chore.
---
There is a mod to reverse that.
---
&gt;I would bet the thief got killed and his corpse fell through the world.
---
Been wondering where all my 3* legendary's corpses disappearing to.
---
While you’re asking Show some love for the Buzz Blade, Singe Action Revolver, Drill, and Paddle Ball too please!
---
All the heavy guns except Gatling Lasers need better sights, most of them have either no sights or sights so bad that it messes up the aim.
---
no one talks about end game in single player RPGs because they don't have them. it's not a fair or useful to compare a live service game with a single player RPG that does not receive constant updates, a live service game should be receiving constant updates.
---
thanks for the tips! the infinite container was something im hip too. was worried about clickin the wrong world and having that happen, now ill be sure to be extra careful. cool to hear its worked for you without issue.
---
Think again.
---
Yep, only risk is when you accidentally click on Public or you'll crash with internet disconnection for longer than 5 minutes, but for me that feature is the most important in F1st.
---
i wouldn't call it brave. they jumped on the live service game model because they saw how incredibly lucrative it was, they even jumped on the battle royale train (though a couple years too late). they are just following the current trends in order to try and make some easy cash.
---
I always have the same issue with the Gatling plasma,  as soon as she lands it takes a shit
---
Because it is most often them with their Fixers.
---
RAY DOLBY:FIRST
---
ATTEMPT AT 5.1
---
SURROUND
---
NEEDS WORK RAY!
---
very cool. ive only moved ammo and little stuff until recently and just moved 700 lbs of stuff and its safe to say id like to fast forward to it being more routine hah.
---
THIS, I really want my JukeBox be turned off, while Appalachia Radio staying on, while it's exactly opposite. Just let the game remember last state of each when quitting the server.
---
Heh.
---
I usually get 1-3 great items after unloading 5000 scrip on every sale.  
---
I only spent 3000 on this latest mystery pick and walked away with a uny/ag/sneak scout leg and a furious/vats/vats Fixer.  Not too bad.
---
Also, wow we have similar builds. U PS4, Xbox, or PC?
---
Unfortunatley not, it still depends where your camp is located.
---
Just you....
---
Or rather the completely unpredictable availability of events...
---
B-but.. it was in the patch notes... 😞
---
Damnit!
---
I personally only use AAFFR heavy guns, imagine I have AP bullets in them. None of those magical Diablo properties that depend on the player character being an addicted freak of nature on death’s door.
---
definitely one of the more useful things. i do think it would be nice to have an implemented feature to eliminate that risk as well though.
---
Cyka Blyat
---
I believe it is a joke to explain it bugs with 76 and the boundary fence
---
If the mobs aren't scaling to your level, they were spawned in by someone else. In all honesty, the only reasonable alternative to leveling low level toons outside of grinding whitesprings is gradually picking up levels as you continue along in the story. Whitesprings and then the west tek circuit are the only leveling areas that have a large amount of the same type of enemy, and in both cases the enemy types are mid to high xp yield. Before wastelanders I would've told you to run through big bend tunnel, but now that the blue ridge caravan got rid of all the scorched in there, whitesprings and grinding through the story are your only real options.
---
That's for sure, some kind of the temporary 100-200 lbs stash that will allow to transfer items between characters safe and easy.
---
Huh? Easily half the players are out of PA at any time except Scorched Earth. If the event in easy, hardly anyone wears it. After getting a backpack, I stopped wearing out of combat because of the ridiculous carry weight advantage.
---
The reason why they got rid of vault raids was because the event was broken to the point of being borderline unplayable from the start. Back when it first launched, it was a miracle if you got through the novice level without encountering a run ending glitch or an unkillable boss. Bethesda gradually made a few improvements, but they didn't have any meaningful effect, specifically because they didn't know how to host several instanced complicated maps on individual servers. Idk why people think they got rid of them because of their difficulty level, they were pretty transparent about recognizing how broken vault raids were.
---
My FPS sometimes drops through the floor when I'm doing it, so annoying
---
Arguably Chinese stealth armor is way more defensive and offensive as long as one doesn’t mind sneaking everywhere. I take no damage in it in situations my PA char could die.
---
Join an lfg discord/subreddit, make a post on here looking for people, run around with your mic on until you find some cool people, force your friends to get fallout and play with you, watch fallout streamers and get to know people in their communities, join a fallout youtuber's discord group. The list goes on.
---
Remember friendly fire perk gives workers health back so use a flame weapon
---
And it was like this in all Fallouts till 76. Multiplayer always kills lore. Add massive to it and it turns into lollore oftentimes.
---
Back in fo4 i used to have a glitch where my weight would somehow be over what I would be actually carrying at the time.
---
A few days ago while makin diluted radway i noticed the recipe showed I had more purified water than what was visible/available in my inventory. 
---
I'm running around in excavator pa (still without calibrated shocks, plan too expensive at 7200 caps)
---
It didn't work for me yesterday. But before that, it was working just fine on pc
---
Bruh what even is this argument? If loading screams make you throw tantrums like this, why tf are you playing a bethesda game?
---
I keep selling those diluted radaways and bought all that, just make sure to use grap mentats and hard bargain. It was down to 5600 or something.
---
Womp womp. I'm always looking for heavy gunners to trade with. I have a Junkie's FFR FR Minigun and a Junkie's FFR FR Ultracite Gatling laser that I've been rocking as my 5th and 6th guns. What's your go-to weapon for the Queen? 
---
I usually use that J/FFR/Fr Gatling Laser when she is flying. When she is on the ground I will alternate between my J/FFR Gauss Mini, Furious FFR Prime .50 cal, Furious FFR Gatling Plasma, or Vampire's FFR Gatling Plasma when I am low on stims, or want to get right in her face and feel invincible.
---
That does explain why it was raining scorchbeast corpses yesterday.
---
Still too expensive lol but i have like 300 radaways so next level up I'll get the chemist perk (already have super duper and 2 ranks in hard bargain) and sell most of the doluted that I'll make.
---
I ran it earlier on PC for two rounds.
---
Since i cleaned my inventory i feel it less, dunno if it's related i'll try to confirm later
---
Heh, I’m regularly in a party while playing and a guy came into the party looking for help launching a nuke. I jumped at it because I love launching nukes (I don’t even care where they land). I soon found out the guy was level 15 and this was apparently his first character. I told him to wait in the room with the terminal for the launch control chief (by the launch prep terminal), but at level 17 he was officially done with the original campaign. Not sure what he’s gonna do now since that’s like half the game right there, but it it was a lot of fun.
---
He got a lot of help from other people while doing the questline, to those wondering.
---
I have 28 luck and have never gotten a pie lol!
---
I had been having the same issue. Completely froze for about a second or so at a few queen fights.
---
Yah I’ll freeze for like 1 or 3 seconds
---
We have no control over it. Other (bigger) subs even got in trouble in the past for using CSS to push ads to the very bottom of the page so they wouldn't be seen.
---
Yeah, that’s what I do myself, the game throws so many that can be diluted. Try to reach 4 caps per diluted on sell, I make most of my money that way, selling hundreds of them every day. No problem covering 1400 every day.
---
I take it you're not on xbox?
---
I tend to use my j ffr fr ult gat laser in the Queen, switching to my Ve gattling plasma when she's in the air. I carry a jffr 50cal, lmg, mini, gattling, ugl, flamer, and gauss mini. Also carry a vffr ugl and flamer. And then my Ve flamer and plasma.
---
I've got a collection of all the heavys on my first list in bffr, vffr, jffr, and mu ffr hah. I like my big guns
---
I just get nervous I’ll delete one of my characters on accident playing on controller. Buttons are so close together.
---
My first nuke is going to someone's camp for shooting me dead through my walls with his op gauss minigun (yea i was wanted, I'm still new to some of fallout 76 bugs)
---
I lost 2000 5,56s and 50 grape mentats earlier, took me 10 minutes to get over it.
---
Are you sure? Just went over the [patch notes](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gmpb43/fallout_76_update_19_patch_notes_may_19_2020/) from May 19 again but can't find it, maybe I missed it. Waiting for this quest reward to be fixed myself.
---
Relax with the music ;))
---
I just literally never see it run on PS4. I explored for hours in that area and the event never started. I've been checking every day and never see it, although some say it happens I haven't seen it myself since wastelanders.
---
Ah, like weaponsmith and armorsmith? I get ya. Some of them are indeed useless to have extra of.
---
Thank you, will give this a go :)
---
Check you're stored items
---
If something is attached to a wall (posters, lights...) and you apply wallpaper, the items will go into you camps stored tab. Not sure what happens to weapons mounted on displays, though. Maybe check your stash/inventory again after a relog?
---
Yah you missed it, it’s ok it’s under Bug Fixes -Items
---
Weapons- Commander Daguerre final quest now gives lvl 50 Vats Unkown Alien Blaster to players about lvl 50.
---
Cheers for reply, powered down a bunch of times but no dice yet. Will try unplug it from the wall maybe.
---
I've definitely seen it since Wastelanders on Xbox.
---
This. I occasionally trying to invite them to group so I can fix this stuff, but they never accept. Someone gifted level 10 me a fusion generator long ago, and I have yet to pay it forward dang it!
---
Replace or scrap the display, log out, log back in. The weapon should be back in your stash.
---
It is starched genes
---
not just the 50cal, every weapon added in 76 and not imported from 4 needs WAY more mods. Its pathetic how little effort was put into every single weapon. 1 or 2 token mods for each weapon and thats it, and nothing added since launch. Its just plain lazy.
---
I use it all the time. It works great for me. Super mutants in particular are fun to watch as they're trying to avoid the incoming shells and find me at the same time.
---
I'd rather get junk than normal armor pieces and weapons I can only sell to vendors. :P
---
LOL I know right, I'm always looking at my ammo time to drop missiles, 40mm and 2mm.
---
God bless you!
---
Now I like that suggestion, they should give you a bulk ammo per major public events at least.
---
It's garbage for most of the valuable items. I trade a lot, my trading spreadsheet has 300+ weapons and armors and most of the times information from FEd76 about value are made up with some not understandable calculations, unreasonable and inaccurate. I know not everyone know the value of the items, but it really piss me off when someone trying to negotiate with me using valuations from this site... You can only use it for two situations: low-tier items you'll probably scrip anyway and usually you have to split the valuation by half and when you suspect you might have valuable item and don't want to scrip it or sale for couple hundreds caps. It's completely useless for trades valuation
---
Arrrr... you are right, only looked for Ally related entries in the patchnotes. Still have one high level char left on the PTS without the last quest, will try later if it is fixed there already. Won't help you much, I know, sorry.
---
I puke on morons who do Mothman or robot dance.
---
Congrats but the fact they're not in the middle of the displays would drive me mad.
---
Yeah, would do again, but sticking up on a lot more ammo and stims first haha
---
What platform are you on? If Xbox, I would be happy to tour with you. Gamer tag TeaGeek
---
The main one that comes to mind is a very popular location, which can be annoying at times, but it hits your criteria plus it has a resource node. Lead deposit in the Mire just east of the crashed airplane. Comes with a cool tree and waterfall that can be integrated. Also next to a silver deposit, but you can’t quite reach both at once.
---
The extreme south of the Savage Divide, heading into the Cranberry Bog near the map border has some nice pools that come with a view and a couple integratabtle elements, though most structures are associated with random encounter or enemy spawn points.
---
Pond to the west of the Moonshiners Shack, next to where Grahm stages his cook-offs during Meet Weeks. It has water, an integratabtle cliff and dock, and comes with useful vegetation.
---
Ponds just north of Foundation/Spruce Knob, en route to Twin Lakes, tend to spawn low level mirelurks, but a couple have what you are looking for. One has become a random encounter location with friendly NPCs sitting and talking - not sure if this now disallows camp placement.
---
Pond just northwest of Yellow Sandy’s Still, northeast of Central Mountain Lookout. This has a bona fide infinity pool effect at one end, has some nice cattails (not harvestable plants, though) that make for charming ambiance, and a little net and rock outcropping that can be incorporated. No buildings, but nice central location. There is a lead deposit just a bit north from here that can be built to have a very nice view and is right over a short cliff from a trailer shack with rad rats but does not have water.
---
North of Site Alpha, near the Top of the World, has some more chained bodies of water, including another waterfall, but the only integratabtle “building” is a train bridge and campsite if you keep going all the way to Seneca Rocks (which has a killer view on top and allows for some creative buildings with foundations but no water on the ridge).
---
absolutely right. I also agree with OP but also with you. The pace of new content will not increase, the quality of new content will not increase, deadlines will be missed and new dupes will emerge.   
---
I love how a lot of players remain positive and look at the roadmap like it is set in stone and BGS will keep it's word, despite of all things in the past pointing to the opposite.
---
Still love the game but REAL improvement (quality increase for example) instead of new 'just working' content, I do not see happen.
---
I seem to remember they used to default to on in beta, but then on release there were no camp radios at all, then when they finally readdded them (as till now) they default to off.
---
My theory is they came across some issues due to how they all radios are synced to the same point in the 'radio stream' (which I guess they did so you can sing along with your friends).
---
The only normal thing you mentioned (where I come from anyway) I did. I joined a couple discords, but the time zones doesn't work.
---
But running around with your mic on and forcing friends to buy the game isn't normal at all.
---
Never thought about streamers, I never got why people watch them. Prop for the same reason I never understood why people like watching sports. I'd much rather play the sport/game myself. I'll check if I kan find any close to my time zone, thanks.
---
It only matters if you finished the quest for settlers and want to help a friend with the final raiders heist - you won't have access to the keypad locked elevator down to the vault door. Otherwise nothing of interrest down there.
---
The Fire Breather wasn't killed by Rose, he was killed by raiders and Rose found his corpse in the cage.
---
Yea that's useless to have extra of.. I personally don't see much use for it at all tho, since i don't use mutations, but it's pretty good if you do.
---
It's not about loading screens. It's about bad game design that makes have to do shit like serverhopping... But I guess there is no point trying it explain to someone like you... Have fun looking for that one sever with active nuke. And dont forget to buy some skins ať atom shop...
---
It's part of a hidden quest that also reveals the location of vault 79 I think, I gave a few of the map parts, but haven't tracked the rest down yet as I've already done the vault storyline. When I get bored I'll go looking.
---
Fallout 76 pre WL, on its surface, was an absolute dumpster fire. The only thing that kept me playing beyond the month and a half it took me to completely exhaust the available activities,  was the way the naive developers more or less held me hand the whole way, progressing at a snail's pace that was close enough to casual rate that I was learning at that I never fell too far behind them as I "modded" 76 for fun.^((and profit))
---
Or perhaps every hour (or fuck every server day) the Purveyor sells a random roll for caps (or double writ?). It can be ANYTHING. But you see the damn thing and there's no fucking RNG in the purchase. Like the vending machines in borderlands kinda.
---
Explosive us 20% base damage before demolitions expert.
---
Same damage as the hardened receiver. But 50% more damage against scorched
---
Some ppl throw nades to tag all the adds
---
Did anything stats change besides the tesla? Did the tesla stats even change or did they just remove the chain effect when shooting the ground?
---
Don't read them and keep scrolling then?
---
How can you explain 5.1 system to the people watching films or listening music on mobiles, tablets, cheap in-ear headphones, soundbars ... Kids are doing a parties with single speaker Bluetooth MP3 boomboxes ... Those people don't even know what they are missing. However, most of actual "hit music" is made for club's mono systems. Where are discussions about quality of MP3 vs. FLAC vs. CD?
---
15 mins?  Crap I'd be launching them all over the place lol.  I had a massive break from this game and came back as a level 70 odd but practically a noob.  Level 90 now and doing much better.
---
It's a game, it's not real life.
---
In the current state, I only sell stimpacks. I never ever used super-stimpacks.
---
So, more variant will be more type of vendor trash in my inventory.
---
Good luck.  It was a wild ride but it was a really satisfying feeling seeing your own nuke go up, probably more than it should be for a game
---
This kind of humor often isn't as obvious as you might think. a /s is often a good idea, even if it takes away from the humor a bit.
---
Because I was crap lol.  I didn't have to hack anything though.
---
I'd say instead of your syringer idea I'd suggest something like the orbital scan beacon, it scans an area for enemies and marks them. Have a version for the camp artillery you have to craft using the artillery flares plus the stuff for the scan beacon that results in a better flare or beacon that also increases the range of the artillery.
---
The picture in game is what it looks like exactly in ligh, but in dark areas it’s purple, hard to explain but it’s okay I’d say not the coolest thing ever but it’s alright
---
Thanks, so people complaining about player damage are either knowingly or unknowingly in a PVP state with the other player.
---
Wondering why players don't realize this?
---
Really, my bad. I have not even tried in 76. In fo4 I had the laser trigger and the countdown spinner to close again. I'm gonna have to try and recreate that? I know how complicated it was. 
---
My automatic Brahmin slaughter house took months to get right. Wish we had the conveyers/factory in 76 we could really create real items with economic need.
---
Because for me it was hard work but I got there in the end.
---
feeling you. Getting rid of the FOMO and not playing a few days feels liberating. Once you notice that, you start wondering why you play "Daily Chores 76". My answer to that is the players, not the game anymore.
---
It's part of the Fallout 1st monthly subscription
---
When wearing the stealth suit you won't be wearing the unyielding armour so you will have your base level of agility
---
It is better then the vanila T65 jetpack.
---
I had PA but don't usually wear it so I don't have any perk cards on it.  I might change that and grab the tank card for my next level up.
---
Thank you!!!!  I went in in my normal loud shoot everything that moves style.  A long way from my sneaky archer Skyrim characters.  Now I know what to expect I'll do it differently next time.
---
Yes indeed it’s better for for it ! :(
---
Scrap the non legendary gear there’s your junk.
---
I always craft a level appropriate heavy combat armor set, bos mods and deep pocket everything when I see anyone leveling up.  I throw in a gatling cannon too to spread my love of heavy weapons.
---
A fully charged Assaultron/Imposter Sheepsquatch head?
---
Aw really?  It was repairing the reactor that took me the longest time, trying to kill everything and repair everything within the time limit.  Loving all the tips on here, will definitely be doing it again and putting some of them into practice.
---
Don't drop in paper bags, they can vanish! containers are more reliable
---
I always have pacifist mode on maybe that's why I've never experienced this.
---
I tried a long time ago and seriously got my ass handed to me.  I was determined this time and had more good stuff.  Definitely do it at some point, it's a good feeling at the end.
---
The gauss pistol is the best gunslinger weapon by far. And very effective outside of VATS. it's just the VATS part that's very bugged, but I'm sure they'll fix it eventually. You definitely didn't waste your bullion, it's the best weapon for gunslinger builds :)
---
No kidding.  Or just go play Borderlands 3 and Destiny 2, see what amazing stuff they have and copy it for this game.  Bosses, raids, common stash, leveling up gear...
---
Fallout 76 1st, sounds ideal for you.
---
Also we can leave messages on it. Like: Great camp. Or I'm 1 cap short for the thing I want to buy from you, can we make a deal? 
---
Also the owner could leave a general message: I need items, like a friend.
---
Joining a couple of discords and only finding people in different time zones sounds like you definitely didn't look hard enough, but ok.
---
Running around with your mic on and talking to people is how I found the group I currently play with the most, and the forcing friends to play was very clearly a joke, but go off ig. (Although I got a copy for a buddy of mine like a month after the beta, and we still play now and then, so it may not be normal, but it's certainly effective)
---
And I get it, but don't knock it until you try it. Visual media's been a popular form of entertainment for decades, and streaming just adds a more social side to it.
---
thx
---
There is a datamined reskin for PAs, that may or may not come, with a helicopter jetpack. Until it arrives, I could use the mothman, or the standard. Will concider this.
---
Thanks for the help.
---
12.99 a month
---
I'll be honest, I got the codes off Google.
---
You can meet her (I did, by accident) you just can't do the quest she gives you until 20.
---
I rarely ever interact with these in Fallout 76 because I spent (or, wasted) hours in Fallout 4 trying to get them. But, one day in Murmrghs as I was heading out the door I activated it for the shits and giggles and low and behold I got it. I was expecting some form of cool buff but nope, was a let down.
---
Get it fist time (and all after), if high intelligence...
---
I would, in nuke zones I run in SA if i'm farming matts, with all stealth skills I never get seen really. I can shoot a SB in the face at point blank range and it still won't see me.
---
And you won't be wearing your unyielding armor anyway so deduct -15 from your agility, the stealth armour is effectivley an armored hazmat suit and works the same way.
---
I figure the best way to approach it is to treat Bethesda the same way they treat their players - use them for what you can and when you can't, disregard them until you can make sure of them again. Seems only fair.
---
What's *it*?
---
Isn't the pawn shop quest pointless after you do the last quest for wastelanders?
---
please, Bethesda, don't...
---
I'm on PC, but I will certainly check these places out, thank you :)
---
Yeah, it's the same for davenport on your daily photo shoot. Well assuming you return the photos to him.
---
Reddits ads are insidious. Fortunately Fiefox mobile even on my old tablet has adblockers. Some of them are a bit too close to the mark and almost constitute harassment IMHO. Of course it helps sell Rediit Prremium.

---
I understand now that all this camp damage people are complaining about is because they enjoy PVP or join random teams. I never PVP and have never joined a team and always have pacifist mode turned on.
---
This is why my camp never gets damaged.
---
Bruh what are you even talking about? If you could trigger any event whenever you wanted to and didn't have to trigger respawns for efficient grinding routes without server hopping, there'd be no point in playing at all. You seriously expect bethesda to implement a system where you could trigger any event whenever you wanted a specific one? You're delusional.
---
Funny enough, the alternative to server hopping exists. It's called fucking waiting. Idk why you think you have a point here. These are well established, pre existing systems that exist in practically every goddamn mmo rpg. Making this shit brainlessly easy and accessible would defeat the point of playing, but go off ig. You're just lazy.
---
Here in lies your lack of understand of what the average case is.
---
I don't think we need to continue any further. We're just wasting each other's time now.
---
See rule 10.
---
Head over to the trading sub if youd like to buy something
---
M1919 hehe we need the m1911a1 back. M14 mp18.
---
I have 1 luck.  I can get it every time.
---
All I have to do is go to the roof of West Tek Research Center.  Ya so, They aren't worth much
---
just you, I see it every few hours every few days.
---
Once you get strong nothing is a challenge. Enjoy it while it's there
---
Yeah... That'd be a magnet for trolling and abuse. 
---
As well intentioned you and a lot of your fellow players may be, sadly a few will ruin it for everyone else.
---
Never happened to me, never lost a single piece of item. Still using bags :) Sometimes it take 5-10 to actually load the items in the bag.  
---
But you startled me a bit :D  
---
Anyway, i will still use paper bags, till i get burn ... :)
---
Ya I don’t do PVP and I also have pacifist mode on, idk why I decided to join a random team all of a sudden I’ve always been a solo player.
---
😊
---
we need bad sport lobbies in this game
---
All the time. Hardly a rare phenomena given our player base.
---
Bethesda FIXED a bug???????  HERESY!    That isn't possible without full modder support.
---
Oh well, at least we can repair everything from the CAMP unit, easy to do if you have the mats.
---
No nerf needed, just buff other builds and let people play the way they like it.
---
You also have a duplicate post. Might be an idea to get rid of one of them.
---
Yeah, thats my end-game right now :D  
---
\+ It would really help to distinguish new players and alts of veteran players. Time to time, veterans alts are a bit grumpy about me, annoying them :)
---
With char 8 you can sell the photos to a Ghoul down in the burrows and still convince him you were robbed by raiders to get a nice reward. The Overseer is suspicious I assume, she always looks at him like 'I need a new brain for him, he is falling for it again!'
---
35% more, not 50%.
---
Is it? Thank you for the correction
---
You've mistaken it with Scorched Killer receiver which have 50% bonus to scorched, but penalty to all other and uses regular ammo, not ultracite.
---
Copy that. Thank you👍 always happy to learn
---
OK until you use it then you will be detected by other local enemies. Like an un-silenced rifle. At least in my experience, take it as anecdotal, I did to carry out intensive tests.
---
Melee has always done more damage then any ranged weapons, but the time it takes to run all over the place to get INTO melee is the problem.
---
Tank killer and long shot shouldn't with with auto rifles. Ground pounder shouldn't work with semi auto rifles. Modern renegade and crack shot shouldn't work with subs. 
---
IMO lock and load shouldn't work with the M79 or other launchers. It gives the M79 a better ttk than most precision weapons. There's no reason a gun with a massive blast radius should have a lower ttk than all 3 revolvers, pump shotgun, scoped lever and scoped laser.
---
sold my 3* gatling gun: ffr, dr and heal for 5K yesterday
---
Aye, he has a short term memory problem. I've been mugged daily for ages and he never seems to care much, or get suspicious. Same old samel, every day.
---
Wait, are you taking excavator as your average case then? And not the 7 or so others combined? 
---
Seems what you consider average is what you personally use.
---
How much did you lose? You weren’t at zero caps were you? That’s crazy
---
Yes, the power fist is set as 'quiet' in the game files, same as the crossbow. I use it as my goto with my fisty build.
---
Can't wait to come back to my camp and see the bee movie script on my notice board.
---
When most people agree that most other people are stupid, they're all correct.
---
it's a static spawn on the roof of West-Tek, there is nothing to be excited for. And waste time near port-a-diner machines...
---
Why was it removed?
---
that would be the woooorst
---
A bit late but no, only available on all base PA.
---
Thanks!
---
that sucks ass. howd it happen?
---
Get rid of First Aid and 2 Demo for Nerd Rage. First Aid boost isn't that significant and particularly useless along with healing factor. You're much better off getting rid of healing factor.
---
While you're at it, what the hell is up with the melee mutations as well. Just gimps your heavy. I'd respec your serums. And if you Int isn't maxed out, I'd maybe consider egghead since you seem to love XP bonus stacking.
---
Also, Green Thumb and Lock and Load probably can go too. Mostly deadweight. How often are you reloading with a 1000 round energy heavy? And you can enable Green Thumb when you're going on a  flux run or whatever you use it for. Once again, outside those times, dead weight.
---
I'm on PS4. When you say Ve, is that Vampire explosive!?!?
---
Can you still get these paint plans I'm on my 50 th drop and still nothing is this normal ?
---
Wow, that lake west of Moonshiner's might just be what I'm after! Still gonna have a wander and look around the others too.
---
Thanks again :D
---
Thanks for the laugh, I needed that.
---
If power armor could be legendary it would be all anyone wore.  Unyielding normal armor letting you have 30 in all stats just blows it away.  Power armor bloody is way safer and you won't die (except to poison) every few minutes like normal armor. Emergency Protocol chest pieces is amazing.  I lose 100 lbs of carry weight when I step into my armor.  PA gives rad resistance, (but so does the new SS armor which is too good)
---
Damned  bethesda budget cuts
---
Yeahup
---
At least in OP's instance it seem pretty clear cut as any veteran would need about 5 minutes to put together a whole set of PA.  It can be annoying though.  The last time I had a decent low level legendary and dropped it at someone's camp I'm pretty sure it was an alt since they knew I was there but refused to acknowledge me or look in the bag I dropped.
---
I don't care, you have a bag of level 15 instigating swing speed shovel on your deck now and I'm not taking it back lol.
---
soo many improvements could be made, no doubt. id be happy for the time being with a shared stash and better trade menu.
---
Building a tribe. I go wider than deep. 43 characters at various levels but only about 10 over level 50. Different builds, roles, camps. I play a team of 2 on one screen as well. Tightest group you can make because I can read my teammates mind.
---
Love making new chars with powerful gear. Kind of rogue-like, how spoilt can I make a new level 2 noob? Do it better/ more efficiently next time.
---
Odd camps, tall camps, unique camps. Trying to break stuff that isn't already broken.
---
Slowly fine-tuning main character.
---
And never ever grinding - it drives me insane(r).
---
I started a community of peaceful outgoing players a year ago. BOS and Responders lore based. Its not only a RP faction but a home for people in need. None judgmental wholesome environment to help gamers in game aswell as those who deal with anxiety and or depression. We started as 20 and now we are over 1400 on all platforms all over the world. And helping others and information about the game is all me do. Not just a gaming community but friends, faction and a family most of all. Thank you yourself for being kind! All in this together!
---
I have a full set Unyielding SS armor, but still keep rolling for a set of Vanguard SS just in case if there is a nerf in the future.
---
I usually drop the items in the ground in my private server.
---
I had issue in a limited trash can once it was a few ammo.
---
As I heard the trick is the time. You have to gather it fast. So I built all 5 camps in the same area and I drop the items in a shared flat spot so I can pick it up in 1 min.
---
So far I did 30 drop with no problem. Do not know what happens on server crash :O
---
Where did you get this info?
---
Thank you so much
---
Haha that's amazing
---
Damn
---
Escorted  And teamed up with a level 47 around a nuke zone last night, whilst I was just mindlessly mat farming. Was pretty cool, dropped him loads of aid and a marsupial serum as he was struggling with all the trenches. 
---
Got good karma as we went to the nuke grove and got 4 legendary enemies from one visit-most I’ve ever seen. Nothing extraordinary do I dropped him all those too. Had a good time just wandering and farming XP for him etc. 
---
I’ve had loads of people help me out early on this play through, met loads of generous people so only fair to carry it on.
---
It be nice if they'd fix armor pen on energy weapons. That'd make a huge difference
---
By definition smgs use handgun ammo. Thats not to say you cant get a rifle in a smg aize package. That first link you posted is a typo. A smith and wesson model 67 is a J-FRAME... a 308 round could NEVER fit in a J FRAME size revolver.  Intell you this as a gun enthusiast who carries a model 60 (another jframe ) on my hip almost daily. Here is a pic showing the size difference of a 308 vs 38 vs a Jframe size revolver

Also what is the order you unlock them.
---
Running around my house turning on all the radios is always the first thing I do and it's so tedious! Also the smoke machine and probably anything else that needs to be turned on... except the jukebox which IS turned on but shouldn't be.. &lt;.&lt;
---
Yep, I noticed this also. Only one giving me lip still, is Ward. First thanks me for bringing back stuff they keep losing and then snarls that he does not trust me. Bipolar much, buddy?
---
Also noticed that when I first arrived at the Crater, audience for the musicians kept booing and heckling. Now, they are cheering. But don't know if that is tied to my reputation advancement.
---
Isn't that true for everything though? There's always some douche trying to ruin whatever any useful tool. Same process as for anything else - report and block the player. Plus if it's a CAMP item you can remove it. If you don't implement something because it could potentially be abused, you'll never get the benefits. The trick is to implement it then improve it and close the loopholes.
---
The Assaultrons are sorta bugged since Wastelanders came out, in that their eye laser is supposed to take some time to charge up before they can fire and then have to charge up again.
---
However, since the last big update, they tend to shoot that fk'n thing non stop without any cool down, which is smashing everybody regardless of their level.
---
As others have mentioned, take out a leg so they fall to the ground and have to crawl. This makes them pretty easy to kill since they're slow to turn and can't easily whack at you with their arms/blades.
---
I'm sneak 50 cal sniper/shogun, and with the perks and gear I currently use, most enemies can walk right through me and still not detect me..... But the Assaultrons will spot me pretty quickly if I get too close.
---
So, I usually try and keep a critical hit saved in VATS for such an occasion, target their leg and crit hit it from a distance. If that doesn't smash their leg apart, the second hit does. Then I just come right up to them and shotgun them in their stupid face.
---
I thought this was something to do with Steam players names not displaying correctly but I could be wrong.
---
A Mr. Fuzzy parade.
---
With my lv35 excavator pa, first aid 3 and born survivor 2 and ultracite laser gatling i can tank a head laser for a while, enough time to kill it. If i end up against 2 though, I'm dead.
---
He later confirmed in messages he was a nooby. He must have just done the excavator quest and was struggling to get the materials to build a full suit, my base is on a junk machine and a death claw spawn so I'm never short of materials for power armour crafting.
---
I've never thought about it, but I've noticed nuked flora the moment the bomb exploded.  I don't mean it suddenly appeared but as soon as the explosion happened and I would run into the zone, I would notice both nuked flora and glowing ones.
---
I do remember reading several months ago that some areas produce more flora than others.  Whitesprings I think is at the top of the list.  I have definitely joined servers and found nuked flora in Whitesprings as well as Fissure site Prime when there was no nuke (probably has just dissipated).
---
They will drop in order once learned. If you obtain one of them out of order via a vendor and learn it you will never get the ones to drop that come before it.
---
Thanks, is the cpt the first drop or is each player's order different.
---
Same order for everyone. Goes Knight, Knight Sargeant, Knight Captain, Officer, paladin, Elder
---
Or better yet craft poisoned spears and throw them at/smash baddies.
---
From everything I have read, the map fragment quest was just a teaser quest to into Wastelanders, before the DLC came out.  I did the map fragment thing, but all it did was let me into the cave, but just that one room where you can see the entrance to the vault.  You still won't be able to access the vault itself until you go in with one of the factions.  You don't need it for the raids, and the raids won't change if you do the quest.
---
IMHO: anything immersive that isn't painted brightly. Might as well paint a bulls-eye on your body...
---
That is why I like the camo paints.
---
What armour do they go on cause I'm sure I've never learned any and the cpt just dropped.
---
It used to be:  Initiate, Knight, Knight SGT, Knight CPT, Officer, Paladin, Elder but lately they've removed Initiate.
---
They drop in order from rank II (Knight) up to rank VII (Elder), at least thats my experience. However if you got a plan from another player and learn it, you won't get the plans for ranks below it anymore as drop. Initiate (Rank I) was removed from the Forbidden Knowledge loot pool for some reason.
---
T60 only
---
Okay, that’s what I thought too, based off what I also read. Seemed like most of posts about it were pretty dated, so I figured I’d come here. Thanks for clearing that up!
---
Amazingly I do have a top to my head. I did take quite a long break (5 ish months) before wastelanders came out, but I’ve been all over it since
---
wish I knew, maybe bots? dunno
---
Look at wastelanders and the new currency. That should give ur answer
---
Right I've just checked I know knight. But not knight sergeant should I not learn CPT and keep trying for SGT.
---
If I had the money, you'd get an award
---
Where exactly is the random encounter spot at Slocum's?
---
On PC, I saw it a few times. Not that rare.
---
No, you're right. It's Steam players who haven't linked their Beth account or something went wrong while doing it.
---
It's one of the reasons why we need an option to actually change our in game name.
---
For the queen, it's worth it. All others(unless ur using heavies) it's not worth it
---
All hail the moth man
---
Yeah, I am stucked with the lvl20 version. Not if ever want to use it... it is on a pistol display.
---
i feel that! i went around on all my characters and put everyones survival tent right by the container i was using. some people were saying 5 mind and some saying 15 mins, im not risking it haha.
---
I want the opposite, to send them the insult bot to deal the burn to their half assed camp
---
They didn't nerf explosive damage on energy weapons when they had them stop dropping in game and made them legacy. That's why they're so overpowered. Not certain about the radium since I've never used it much, but as it's legacy as well, I would assume they handled it the same way. I don't know why they didn't just nerf the damage on all explosive legendaries and keep them in game, but I'm sure people with legacies to sell aren't complaining.
---
😂😂😂
---
Thanks just check I know knight, only so God knows why captain dropped I'll not learn it and keep trying hope Sargent drops.
---
it is
---
Bethesda: The Burrows are now open! Prepare for the deadliest dungeon in Appalachia, testing the skill of even the most hardened team of veteran players!
---
Players, five minutes later: That was it? Did we miss something? 
---
My friends and I actually scoured the place after clearing it, because we were certain there had to be more to it to warrant Bethesda's hyping it up the way they had.
---
It’s a good way to get your camp nuked.
---
Sorry about your 'whole bottom' 😢
---
Yeah, I agree with you. I mostly carry around a bajillion guns because I like to trade, and most of the high level people I meet who don't have mics don't have the attention span to wait while I pull guns from my stash. I probably don't need a weapon wheel FULL of heavy guns. I probably don't need 93 UC plasma cores, 50 Uc fusion cores, 15k UC .50 cal, or 15k UC 2mm EC, but I already made it, and it's too heavy to put in my stash. I can burn down some of my ammo to manageable amounts while I stack up some level ups.
---
I'm very interested in your take on my mutations. I run those melee mutations because I will swap into 2 hand melee for whitspring farming, but I probably don't need mutations for that. I've enjoyed healing factor, because I rarely need stims, but I'm interested in your opinion as to why I should ditch it (water, food, stims, sleep, etc). I guess realistically, I could ditch class freak if I dropped some mutations?? (Do you think CF is necessary for a mutant?)
---
I have my int maxed, but I'm not really interested in XP at this point since I'm lvl 175, it's just a habit from early days, and have considered changing my Charisma from 7 to 4, but am unsure where to put the special points. (Maybe endurance so I can run chem fiend?)
---
Lock and load and first aid are really just placeholders to use empty slots created by accidentally over-leveling perks, and green thumb doesn't need to be on all the time (I use it almost exclusively to get ingredients for orbital strike beacons and formula P).
---
Please tell me what mutations you would suggest. 
---
Sorry for the novella, but you have some good suggestions, and I would love if you could expand on them. If you were willing to do so, maybe you could just send a nukes/dragons link to show how you would spec my character?
---
 I sincerely appreciate your feedback. Thank you.
---
If it is your private world:
---
yes. 5 minutes. If your game crashes in between or you accidently rejoin a public world with the second character, you have just enough time. If both happen, you'll load into a new private world. The 5 minutes is how long the private world exists with the owner gone, not how long the weapons stay in the container.
---
If it is the private world of a friend:
---
So if the private world is owned by a friend and he/she stays there all the time, the 5 minutes don't matter because there is no risk of the private server shutting down.   
---
BUT when an owner leaves his private world and stays away for more than 5 minutes, and there is an other FO1st member there, the world will change ownership. However it is not implemented properly and rejoining will be very difficult if not impossible since the new owner will still say 'visiting private' in the social menu.
---
Were this a different game and different company, I don't see why we couldn't have such a feature. The problem is that we have Bethesda.
---
Have you seen how little effort they put into running and maintaining their game?
---
Take cyberbullying and discrimination. Who is going to police it? Certainly ain't going to be Bethesda, at least not in a timely manner. Do you think Bethesda is going to want to expose themselves to litigation for not properly managing the situation?
---
Bethesda is going to do what they're going to do. Unless it costs you money to leave a notice or money to purchase the notice board, Bethesda just won't do it. Hell, they won't even do something so basic and standard with most online games as text chat.
---
With that in mind, do you honestly expect Bethesda to implement this? It's not a matter of douche's winning. It's more that Bethesda lets them.
---
Dreadfully executed sculpture, hopefully they can find a real artist to create the one used everywhere.
---
Sweet jeebus, any explosive plasma Gatling is my DREEEAAAAM.
---
Any improvements in qol would be great, but the game  needs end game content more
---
When the game is finally nerfed so even those leaving the vault never lose, we will get complaints that the game is too easy and boring.
---
It would also be a great way to implement purchase history. You come home, check the mailbox, few messages of how your prices suck, you ruin economy, youve been insulted, and a vending history... wouldnt it be nice, if we would get this 🎶
---
Dps rankings go like this.. 
---
1. Explosive with rank 2 or higher *Demolition Expert* perk
---
2. 25% faster fire rate
---
3. Explosive without *Demolition Expert* perk
---
BUT..
---
Differences are **really small** and you have to remember that Queen is immune to explosions, meaning 25% ffr will always be better for her. And using up to 5 perk points to improve explosive damage might not be the wised thing to do.
---
I personally use both. For different situations. If im killing Queen i go 25%ffr, if i need aoe damage etc i swap perks to demo expert and use explosive weapon.
---
True, why do people want everything on EASY mode all the time?
---
Imagine waiting around for the devs to add this instead of just downloading a mod that already out there for this. And no for the 100 times you are 20000% not going to get banned for having visual mods.
---
This happens when a previously nuked area returns to its "normal" state. The game ain't spawning in the normal mobs, it just plops down robots.
---
Probably the cleaning crew. :)
---
That's what I guess too. I have over 40 weapons and 20 armor pieces in my inventory and 700 stash space full of legendarys. The lag everytime I open my inventory or stash is insane.
---
Yup. Me too.
---
Yes, this is a pain in the arse!
---
I remember playing with a friend they logged in and someone else had their CAMP already out where their one once was, but they missed or ignored the option to 'find another server' (it was on a private server so not sure if that had something to do with it). 
---
Anyways, the other guy whose CAMP was there left the game so my friend went to put their CAMP back down in the EXACT same location, and couldn't place the Blueprint of their house because "Item is floating"... Made no sense, but ended up scrapping a tonne of components and starting from scratch.
---
Shhhhhh!
---
I does it a few days ago on ps4 for my platinum trophy and it worked.
---
Ok? My point is I feel like there is repeatable content (as there should be). The point is if people want weekly new content they should expect much more aggressive monetization. Developing content costs money. The game is $40 and you don’t need to spend any money beyond that and people act like they should have new events added every week. It’s unrealistic.
---
Ya that seems almost broken with how easy it is to get, &amp; superior to the previous stealth system where you had to hold still or use stealth boys to move.
---
Depends what you mean by pointless. I think it’s a fun little detective case. I play games because they are fun.
---
At least the people you message showed up.  After the queen last week I went over and checked the area and finally found one for the first time.  Ran back over to where everyone was at a did a follow me emote towards the thing.  One of the guys shot me in the face with an explosive harpoon gun instead. 
---
Okay. I went to kill the thing myself and eventually one or 2 other people finally realized it was there.
---
Do you have to pay a subscription for this live service game?
---
Aren’t those ads based on your browsing history?
---
Imagine playing on console
---
the sights on the harpoon gun look like a bit of coat-hanger wire twisted into a circle, aiming with it is a joke
---
850 DR??? HOW???
---
What's the cap of diminishing returns?
---
I’m also on Xbox and have the same issue. Mostly during the queen fights
---
wow double excavator, here i come :D
---
Does your two shot have explosive damage also? There is no world where two shot (which adds only 25% damage) is better than junkies (5 addictions add 50% damage). If you are seeing differently it has to be a bug or you don’t have 5 addictions
---
Speaking of the gramophone, why isn't this something we can get? Be a cool quest reward followed by hunting multiple records in hard to find locations. I'd be sweet to a have a record player and different albums to play.
---
I can Scrip my gauss Minugun just fine... Have you applied a skin by chance?  As soon as you apply any paint/skin to a weapon/armor you cant scrip it
---
since nobody mentions it:
---
you can use  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) to plan your new/respecced build so you'll choose the least amount of 'useless' perks along the way.
---
I use the garage of the overseers house (private server) as my drop off and pick up spot, there's a stash box and all of the crafting benches for changing weapon and armour mods after I lost a full uny/bol set using a container at mt pleasant station.
---
So far after maybe 20 transfers between alts it's been flawless
---
Regarding healing factor, I use to be into it like a lot of other people did and it was very meta early on as a no-brainer pick. Having used it for a while though, it's more of a hindrance overall. 
---
Remember, healing factor doesn't just affect stims, it affects all chems. So if you wanted to amp up your damage with chems, you've just hamstrung your self I think around 12% ish for no real reason. Stims are plentiful so you'll likely never run and there is no need for First Aid perk if you just use stims without the negative effects of healing factor. 
---
Up to you with what you want to do regarding Class Freak. For me if you're using Unyielding, it's probably not necessary as your bonuses eat up the losses comfortably. PA doesn't do that.
---
The way I see it, you could probably get away with a minimum of mutations. Speed demon and adrenal reaction at a bare minimum. You could do without Marsupial but the passive +20 carry weight and jump height are well worth it, even for the minor Int loss. If you have marsupial, bird bones is a requirement but just for the slow falling. It'll prevent a lot of those instances where you jump and do one of those hard PA "hero landings". Those really slow you down and can accidentally aggro friendlies.
---
Aside from those, scaly skin is fine since you don't really need AP. Egghead is good for XP boosting. Maybe that Herd Mentality that you had if you're always in a team. The rest for me are unnecessary or actually counter-productive. Carnivore especially. It's not really worth it. I've almost never been in a situation where I've had to resort to eating raw or spoiled meats.
---
Hope that helps.
---
Praise be to Mothman.
---
That’s better then the team that destroyed my entire camp and ripped down my walls, literally nothing was left standing. I’d never tried being on a team and I had no idea they could do that to your camp
---
Probably Weasel. She seems very perturbed that she can't say bad words.
---
I started like a month ago, and got loads of care packages from high levels, it really does feel good, when you run around with low lvl weapons, 2 diluted stimpaks, praying that this 40 ammo you got for your shitty hunter rifle will be enough to get somewhere meaningful. 
---
And then you see a fuckin tank lvl 400-ish walking right to you, with gift emote, dropping bunch of cool stuff. Im already at lvl 80 after only few weeks, but everytime i see a low lvl i do the same now. I dont have much in terms of resources, so didnt give out any weapons or armor, but i always carry shitloads of meds just so i can drop some, if i see lower lvl. Feels good man :)
---
what do you think of ? Or what kind of reward would be sufficient for you ? Bring up some examples.
---
3\* legendary every time ? or exclude some stuff from loot pool ? Or some fluxes ?  
---
Semi decent loot is .... variable.  
---
I always get tons of screws fighting collosus. Add some fluxes and I would be happy :)
---
And some kid stuck in a fridge.
---
Whats it like inside fort defiance with them on? I love the ambient noises in there.
---
How could I forget hahaha
---
Waiting or serverhopping for common events with trash rewards with only small chance for cosmetics? My time to play is limited and I would like to spend it having fun instead of waiting. What activity should I do while I'm waiting? Run circles around map hoping for legendary to spawn? There is nothing entertaining. Events are atleast activity with some purpose and goal to achieve. Its not like fucking Radiation rumble is raid that gives you some epic loot to need to be locked. And when you are talking about locks in other games, sure but it's only for events that grant the best loot in that game and there is also some activity to do while you're locked out. We get random loot in Fallout 76 with really slim chance for it to be actually something good. There is no Citadel of Buring Todd that drops bloodied fixers. If there was I would agree that there needs to be lockdown. This randomness in loot is more like Diablo or some looter shooter game where you can grind untill you go mad and there is still point of playing.

Ray Dolby: First attempt at 5.1 surround. 
---
I honestly dont believe posting about it here will change anything. I'm certain most players don't go online to read about it (maybe because of the franchise's singe player background).
---
This was a well fucking worded rant though, upvoting because of the visceral rhetoric pleasure.
---
Can you not read what it says? 
---
"Ray Dolby: First attempt at 5.1 surround. Needs work Ray !"
---
And the speakers are set up like a 5.1 surround sound system (missing the subwoofer)
---
Ray Dolby: First attempt at 5.1 surround. Needs work Ray !
---
r/nottheonion
---
Then you see the One Violent Night/Radiation Rumble problem: Assholes bitching at others for trying to complete the goal rather than farming points. Ultimatly, the problem is not game design as much as it's gamers.
---
It's a great way to free up some space, drop all those unsold plans after they've sat in your vendor for a couple of weeks - don't worry, you'll get new copies of that pipe pistol ivory grip plan in about 5 mins anyway!
---
I was about level 40 when some random lvl 150 player came to my camp and dropped about 200 plans - i know it was all garbage for him but i read what i didnt know, learnt about 40 new plans and it really made my day - it set the tone for my Fallout 76 experience and I've been passing it forwards ever since  - it's a top community - big love to all you wastelanders out there!
---
Pacifist mode doesn't protect camps, it just makes it so you take very little damage until you shoot back.
---
I try to.
---
If I see a low level, when I'm on my main, I'll drop them stims and ammo.
---
If a high level drops me stuff on my alt, I'll try and give them a level appropriate legendary or whatever ammo I see they might need.
---
at 1500+ hours I can say Yes.
---
However, I still get blue screened daily. If you are a person that gets really mad about bugs, then I would say No
---
For me it's a super rare encounter, surely a guaranteed 3 star anything is not unreasonable? Just disappointed in the reward for effort put in. 
---
You state 'always'. Is the Colossus a common enemy for you that screws are a decent reward?  That's ...not worth it imo.
---
I am confused about what Public Teams are (teams on a public server?) And are you suggesting that the team leader be allowed to pick the perk that you share with the rest of the team?
---
I logged in last night, not able to place my camp, someone else was there, so took a look around.
---
Pretty basic camp, level 103 him and a few mates were firing weapons into the air, from the look of them pretty bad ass weapons.
---
Anyway he had powered off his vending machines, I presume he was near max cap.
---
They left so I "broke in" to his shed where vendors are..... Full of duped weapons mostly ultrasite gatling guns. God weapons. Pretty cheap prices too!! 
---
After mulling it over I thought I'd annoy him/them. So I bought 10 and left the server......
---
Fair point. It's a shame that the developers are letting their customers down so badly. After so many u-turns on things like their no-pay-to-win promise and the dismal money-grubbing attitude it's no wonder their popularity has tanked
---
What do you mean "deal with the people that dupe"?
---
There really isn't much you as a player can do. If you see it, report it. That's about it.
---
Are you sure the problem isn't you comparing yourself to your friends? What does it matter what your friends have? I mean if you feel badly enough about it and you have evidence, report your friends. 
---
I mean it's the right thing to do but what matters to you more - that you have your friends or being just? Hell, are they even really your friends?
---
I'm all for reporting dupers as you come across them but at the end of the day it's neither your responsbility or your fault if you don't report them. 
---
It's all on Bethesda. Not the duping. Dupers will always look for exploits. That'll always going to happen. It's on Bethesda for not acting quick enough do deal with these issues, not making their game robust enough to minimise incidences of duping and discourage that kind of activity.
---
Didn't know that. I ran through there alone on my ooh this perks looks cool, broken build.
---
bucket list
---
lol. yeah i was lucky they showed up. Did message a few people though. Prob thought i was trolling.
---
Can you remember what dropped for you from it?
---
The galling gun got nerfed a few times and with wastelanders the fire rate got capped but at the same time the fire rate of the handmade, 10mm and 45 subs fire rate got uncapped. The current fire rate displayed isn't the correct one. 
---
The tesla did get a damage nerf and it still chains. 
---
And reducing the damage cards from 40% to 20% isn't really a minor nerf imo
---
I’m still waiting for someone to buy my 12,000 cap toilet paper. Any takers?
---
if you’re micromanaging just because of maximums, it’s a play style issue
---
And I thought you could only use repair kits at workbenches. Just now learned you can use them from Pipboy.
---
It’s usually pretty immediate in my experience
---
Hmm interesting. Then why are the subs classified as auto rifles in fallout? I would have assumed at least the 10mm sub would be perked for pistols in NW.
---
Ye the miner miracles quest is too low level for the mats it requires to make the pa. I had problems with black titanium and screws. Ended up powering up the ash mountain workshop to get the black titanium until a scorchbeast attacked.
---
I think the bonuses match up pretty well to how the description is applied. If you join a team that says roleplaying but they aren’t doing quests (where the CHA bonuse applies) then the team leader choose the wrong perk and it can be cahnged
---
Not sure where you got that swing speed info. I keep a swing speed Shishkebab for Friendly fire use and it's decidedly faster than one without it.
---
Anyone else have to stop everything they're doing to use a stimpack?
---
I ended up farming death claw island with a sniper pot shooting the deathclaw and server hopped when I first started building my first EPA.
---
.308 receiver for the combat rifle.
---
it badly needs a 200 ammo box mag. And dammit a better way to get .308! really miss the glorious system from Fallout NV...
---
&gt;Fair point. It's a shame that the developers are letting their customers down so badly.
---
Eh. It's Bethesda. They are who they are and there's no real incentive for them to change since enough players reward them with subscription payments and purchase of Atoms to keep them going.
---
You're right that their popularity (or more their reputation) has tanked but will it matter...? I mean it does for me and I've seen for a few others as well. Like I'll NEVER pre-order a Bethesda game ever, nor pay full price ever. I'm not even all that hyped for Starfield of Elder Scrolls VI because of what they've done with 76. 
---
However, people like myself might very well be in the minority. It bothers me seeing so many posts about people blindly supporting and justifying Bethesda's action or begging for more ways give Bethesda money to support them to "keep the game alive" like they owe Bethesda to keep the game going and not the other way around.
---
I guess only time will tell.
---
Agreed. This is a must in a game that supports multiple player characters. Borderlands is much better for this. I cannot imagine Diablo 3 or WoW without this. Hell, even an old (but still good) game like Titan Quest has this. This is also one of the reasons why I cannot go back to Diablo 2 - here's hoping that the rumored D2 Ressurected includes shared stash.
---
So yeah, 76 should really get some shared container item. I don't care if it's buildable in CAMP,  available somewhere around Wayward or simply in any place fit for it. I just want it too exist.
---
It would be benefitial for the game and for keeping player playing. This game was very sandboxy endgame. Many players don't want to find something to do in endgame, so they like to play alts. Just like in WoW Classic - no endgame content, so players level alts. And it surely keeps players subscribed, so why wouldn't it have the same effect here?
---
It was probably removed because it'll likely be added in with Steel Dawn/Fractured Steel. But that's my guess.
---
Same. I moved just so I could shell the event. Burn him indeed!
---
I mean tank killer is used in adventure so idk about why that shouldn't work for autos. 
---
Last time I checked damages, pre-wastelanders, pistol perks don't work for the subs. 
---
The current ttk for the m79 isn't better than the scoped lever. 
---
Long shot, tank killer, and ground pounder shouldn't work with shotguns.
---
I'd say vanguard. chances are you're not gonna be getting hit much so you should be able to maintain high health.
---
I use a junkies shotgun and when i rolled my secret service armour it gave me 3 unyielding and 2 bolstering. So that comes in handy. So times i lower my health if i'm just out adventuring. Don't do it on the queen though.
---
Although. I mean i suppose you could also go do that. Get your health low enough for some sweet stat boosts. Just need to be prepared to cheese it.
---
I don't even keep track of drops anymore. I've been playing for around a year now and I've gotten so many garbage one star drops I've learned to just ignore the pop up.amd sift through it later lol.
---
If anything I wish you could turn the pop up off.  It's pretty annoying when the queen dies and you are surrounded by mirelurk kings trying not to die and the game want to stick a giant combat armor chest on your screen and now you can't see...  Every freaking time.
---
I wonder how many people are going to blame the player for dev imposed limits.
---
I keep the torso as a swap. I usually do not slot it. It's fun, but unneccessary.
---
I'm level 29, and because so many high level players are farming around that area... I can't get much past the front door with all the high level spawned ghouls.
---
I'm hoping that ES6 is where they're concentrating all the resources they obviously aren't using for F76
---
Gold is 5k, treasury notes appear unlimited atm..
---
"Nothing personnel, kid..."
---
Sounds like PKOA? Would you mind directing us the faction?
---
I hope to one day wake up to my future wife screaming and i have to rush to play video games with her
---
So you want to have your cake and eat it?
---
Its honestly terrible at the moment, have they even explained why they decided to set it like this? Most of the time I can't participate in events, or teleport to places because I am always overweight because I got no where to store my stuff. You can get 2-3 legendary weapons from certain events. I usually keep certain weapons because of selling them for scrip at a chance for a better weapon. But that gets even more annoying when the scrip daily limit is about 200 which can be taken away in like 30 mins. I get a crazy amount of legendary weapons at my level. Got no where to store them or sell them. So my only option is to get rid of the worst ones and deal with it. Cap limit is a big problem too, some weapons can go for 30,000 caps to 100,000 caps. It hurts my head to deal with the trade system to trade items of equal value for weapons or armor. I just want to throw up a shop and sell my stuff. Also worrying about losing a fuck ton of caps because of the cap limit is a big problem too. It goes on and on with this. Its all just a massive headache of micro-management, that scares people away from even bothering with this game because they don't want to sit for an hour trying to find out what to keep, get rid of, or sell(If the vendors don't run out of the 1400 caps they will disappear with a small amount of items).
---
I really tried to get back into this game after the May update and honestly they are doing nothing to improve it. I played for a week and half, most of the game play was fun until you hit a mid to high level which where you are introduced to micro-management hell. 
---
The excuse I heard for the reason behind the stash limit was because it was straining the servers or something but its been a year already and nothing has been done. I hope they improve the game soon because its more work than fun. 
---
(Sorry about the rant just got back into fallout 76 recently and it just made me real pissed to deal with the micro-management and again. Thought they would fix it but I guess not)
---
I see a daily but I also look for it
---
Ha. But the bottom of the camp is all floor with foundations its just not good enough for 76.
---
I would love this! Just spent about 8 hours yesterday redoing my CAMP design. I haven't even started working on the furnishing and decorating yet. I'm pretty sure I could build a round house now, the building is so freaking buggy. Adding then deleting pieces to get stuff facing the right way or to fill a gap that it should already snap into. I felt like I was fighting the game vs actually using a built in system.
---
by camp you mean  
---
1. That little movable C.A.M.P. thingy ?
---
2. Some blueprints of your previous camp, that you want to place.
---
If 1. There might be some restriction if you are too close of map marked place.
---
Lots. This does my head in, especially during crazy fights. For me (on PC) my stimpak hotkey doesn't work if my cursor is active on an enemy or while I'm firing etc. I have to run away from the fight and use it. I've had to remap the key a few times as well.
---
Innovsurvivalist latest youtube video
---
I’m level 91 and I’ve never learned any, are the drops from a specific event/quest? I would love some paint for my t60
---
Amazing shot. I can feel the oncoming radiation from here!
---
He became the avatar of ~~Grugni~~ Grognak at that moment...
---
I had a few help me 18 months ago early game, so I definately do what I can to help anyone. 
---
I gifted a mixture of items to a level 12 player, they then told me it was their alt... ok, I didn’t mean to patronise you.. it was all good. 🙂 the gesture was there..

Yesterday i fast travelled to someone's camp near the river since it was closest to an undiscovered place and spawned in the river. It was nighttime and due to the tricky location and their camp being mostly on water, i got lost trying to walk to land. 
---
I wasn't expecting Bethesda to remove underwater breathing in pa and panicked instead of leaving the pa and swim for the surface. Ended up drowning.
---
Even if they do, would you not expect a massive amount of bugs, very little effort spent on their part to fix those bugs until the mod community kicks in around a year later. 
---
That's assuming of course Bethesda doesn't monetise mods like they've been wanting ever since the failed attempt to monetise mods with Steam and there onwards with Creation Club.
---
Also, sure given how 76 has played out that they're not going to incorporate some online service component as well as a microtransaction store like Creation Club but built into the game itself, with "helpful" reminders to buy certain things from the microtransaction store that Bethesda, on purpose, introduced an annoying mechanic within the game that "conveniently" is dealt with with said microtransaction store purchase?
---
Bethesda isn't going to leave money on the table. They've shown us at least that much. Single player game might be solid, fun with some good characters and quests but it'll be buggy as all hell and they will do everything they can to squeeze every last penny out of you.

You have to find the technical data and turn it in as a quest forbidden knowledge. Eventually you get the bos t60 paints just having trouble with mine seem to have missed one. You can find it in the white springs bunker. It's a real grind though.
---
Same, that's why I must adapt, delete some walls floors and other weird stuff to assimilate it with my C.A.M.P
---
it is though, limits serve a purpose. Why is someone at max scrip? the only reason is to hoard it for the next sale. why at max storage? you have to be holding onto far more stuff that you can reasonably use? Has a person really bought all the items with gold that now they’re sitting there at cap?
---
Caps is the only issue because we need a permanent cap sink since by now people can have all the plans
---
I like the The Division 2, but just like FO76, it struggles with the end game. I finished it's first shitty season and now I hope 76 does seasons better.
---
The way Massive handles the endgame is really weird, because with WONY they have all the pieces to make a great endgame, but they decided not to use NY in it!? What hell? This means that it's DC and the same missions again and again.
---
Beth already has as bad endgame, so I let the seasons decide.

Take the "building" team, it has an intelligence bond, which is more useful for general roaming and killing enemies because each points of intelligence increases xp gain by a percentage, if the team leader could simply create a team for just "roaming and looting" then pick the building team's bond bonus it'd be ideal, instead of making a building team, then hoping everyone who joins knows what you're after if they don't have voice chat enabled (and some people invariably won't).
---
&gt;Public Teams should have more categories, and the group leader should be able to pick the bond bonus no matter what category they pick.
---
That is "having your cake and eating it too" though.
---
Also, good luck with text chat. I wouldn't mind it too but it's not happening for the foreseeable future. Bethesda made that very clear with recent interviews.
---
I have similar situation - switched the server, empty Blast Zone, turns out my Cop a Squatter were Drop 9. So I cleared it, and run towards the forest, you'll never know. And I found it between the trees. Turns out it was faar too easy, like half magazine off my Bloodied Gauss Minigun. Got 3\* Exterminator's Gold Club and Wendigo Collossus Vocal something (junk category) and that's basically it. Really hope that event will be more demanding and more rewarding.
---
Yes, 3\* legendary would be reasonable, I hope that would be the reward for collosal problem :)  
---
I stated always, because there are spawned many wendigos around collosus, so I get lots of screws and acid out of them. I remember having problem with screws and acid.  
---
And yes, screws are good reward, at least for me :) They sell good and you need lot of them if you are supporting low lvl players ( yeah, this is my end-game content now :D )  
---
I was thinking at least have a chance ,, - 1 \* ,,  
---
\* \* \* legendary - would drop 2 - 3 \* items. I feel you and I hate that 1\* from 3\* enemy. :/
---

Also on xbox. I get lag pulling up pip boy and when initially looking at perks. Kind of annoying when I need to swap cards
---
I mean that might be ok for now but it's clear where Bethesda is heading with the future of legendary items that they don't want us trading them between characters.
---
Yes P.K.O.A,  Peacekeepers of Appalachia. Go to my profile all my posts will send you there. Against the rules to share other subs on here
---
I'm curious how you think its a play style issue for the stash limit or cap limit. It highly limit players from keeping certain items they are going to need in the long run.  Even if you try not to horde things the only way to really make a good portion of caps in this game is selling to other players which also cost weight because shops are connected to your stash. Its honestly just hassle to deal with. 
---
I'm not saying limits shouldn't be a thing because it does stop people from mass hording stuff. Selling stuff becomes a pain because you have to pick out which legendary weapons and armor to get rid of, keep, or sell. Which are all a pain, getting rid of it either takes a lot of time to get scrip because of the small limit, keeping it cost massive weight, and trying to sell it to players takes time and weight in your stash.
---
Its just my opinion but I think all we need is an upgrade from what we got now. Increased storage or maybe junk, aid, or ammo is lighter when in a stash.
---
They could use the terminal for this.
---
Thanks! Yeah I dig your friends project too, pretty creative stuff. My psn is the same as my username on here. Add me and swing by the camp sometime!
---
It's more options and a more customizable system, if the suggestion was something like "I should be able to create a team and lock it so no one can join so I can be solo and still get the x1 benefit" then I'd agree.
---
It turns down ALL effects, including gun shots etc.
---
just play normal game and events as you would. it will be done quickly.
---
Nice! Out of interest what type are they from top to bottom?
---
What a doughnut! ‘Groan..’ 😀
---
yeah ps4
---
Sadly it was a limited time event, I have no idea if this reward will be available again
---
Haha.. it’s ok their back in the shops now, panic over 🙂
---
Life goals right there
---
The luck from the generic roaming/looting is there to increase the durability of items found, in turn increasing their value.
---
Building makes sense for Int since it’s about crafting. Yes, you get bonus XP (though you’re better off just having one person share inspirational), but Int is supposed to also increase the durability of crafted items.
---
Building could probably be renamed to learning, but really it’s the only one with an off name
---
Right in front of it. Its popular so sometimes its already cleared. And it's also technically faction vs faction so any faction in game (robot, ghoul, settler, exc) can spawn so it's not always going to give you rep, but server hopping its fairly consistent
---
gold limit is 5000 
---
Kids these days with their new fangled 800 stash limit. When i was a lad it was only 400.

You're making a lot of sense!

It has an exoskeleton how would that work?
---
If you can farm a lot of flux and use ammocrafter and super duper, you can cover your costs. For me, its worth it (ultracite plasma cores are cheep to craft).
---
I have a decent 5.1 system but never actually noticed that the surround sound was working. Do you have to enable it somewhere?
---
r/market76. Try this
---
I'd just play normally, it will complete quick enough. I think I did mine in one evening. But if you want to farm, charleston capitol building, westek, harpers ferry and the burrows are all good places.
---
I can’t even have a go at the daily, when I talk to Ward he says, “I see you have our missing property” and I get the reward.. a nice bug 🙂

What if they want a roaming team for xp?
---
Better trade menu for sure. Between transfering between alts and praying the level 1000 isnt scamming you when you put your B2525 minigun up for 0 caps.... combat is a breeze in comparison
---
I’m assuming you can only do this in the lobby for that limited time frame? Thx
---
Excavator power armor with double calibrated shocks my God the CarryWeight would be insane
---
Are you at max treasury notes?  I think you stop getting any after you have 1000 in inventory that you haven’t converted to gold.
---
I wouldn’t, get the jetpack first. I personally love it and was able to adjust my perk cards very slightly to negate that -1 AP issue and then some. It’s the single best item I’ve gotten in the game and I’ve been playing for 1900hrs. Get it!
---
I used the pocketed armour trick for a long long time to carry round like 900 lbs of gear or something
---
Same as bloodied - Unyielding. You can still go like half health if you want the extra buffer but you get quite close to the power of a bloodied build without having to commit to be below 20% health all the time.
---
I directed someone to PKOA that posted he was to slow to play with others because he lost some use of his hands, hope that was oky for me to do? I didn't realise it was against the rules.
---
Been fixed mate, I actually enjoy plasma and laser rifles these says, especially on automatic.
---
then think of building as leveling you’re character. You’re “building it up”. 
---
There’s six options and you’re taking exception to the naming of one of them.
---
But Gauss guns
---
No
---
But
---
NO
---
Don't you mean wife goals? :)
---
The jetpack is one of those things you didn’t think you needed until you get it. ESPECIALLY for a bloodied build. It’s hard to explain all the perks of having it, you just need to experience it for yourself and make small changes to your perks. But man, I will never go back to not having it.
---
if its ANY legendary you are after go for the Leader of the Pack Event near the Ferris Wheel in the map. it will generate 3 seperate low level legendary wolves every time.
---
other than that look for "hoarde" events on the western part of the map.
---
I've had it happen before, pretty sure it has something to do with the way item weight is calculated when you are loading into a zone.
---
I'm assuming you run weight reduction mods/backpack?
---
Ah no after moving the little camp thingy I cant place my kickass barn camp.
---
Bethesda gets most of the blame, but not all.   That’s like the thieves saying should have locked the door as they steal your TV.   While true, it does not excuse their behavior.
---
All the damn time. Especially during combat
---
Absolutely ok! We are here for anyone who cares. Ad Victoriam!
---
10,002 That is just bonkers!!
---
They put a cap on notes too? Goid to know. I am half way to 1000, but soon I have to slow down then. After I sit on 5000 bullions (thats the cap on them).
---
Same. If Flux isn't an issue it's a no brainer. You get *much* more Ammo when crafting!
---
Steam peeps.
---
Arnt they the same?? Wife goals are life goals
---
I've done that a hundred times times and been fine but just the other day when rejoining to pick up the stuff I got a disconnected message. I immediately rejoined but the stuff was gone from the suitcase. Luckily it was just some stuff for my secondary character to sell but it definitely spooked me. Not sure if the private world server crashed or what.
---
I run 1x LS, 1x zealots, 1xtrouble shooter, 2x vanguard.    Looking to replace the vanguard pieces with a ghoul and mutant slayers pieces.

We need a way to easily share items , caps and anything we craft  with alts. This would solve a lot of QOL issues this game has.  We can have max 5 characters in the game so It would just make sense to make storage 5 times 800 (4000) and have it be shared between all characters.  
---
1. **It would solve the respec issue, as you can just make an alt to play the build you want.**
---
2. **Remove all the risks with  any transfer.**
---
3. **Eliminate the need to redo a lot of timegated grind and crafting RNG minigames just to play the build you want.**
---
4. **Storage wouldn't be so much of an issue.**
---
5. **The ridiculous cap limit would be pretty much be eliminated.**   
---
Granted that there are better solution for these issues, but it could be a quick intermediate way of getting there.   However bethesdas monetization model is actually based around limiting storage (for no actual reason other than to charge us)  and timelocked grinding with RNG crafting minigame is what they actually have for game content right now, so I doubt this will ever  be implemented any time soon given the roadmap they gave us.
---
Yep, stopped getting them, then realized it had been days since I turned any into gold and was like “Doh!”
---
I don’t chase the items you can buy with gold, etc.... when I get enough I might buy something.   I’m pretty casual, and realized some time back that I’m far too lazy to chase BIS.
---
He died in my game too. I encourage him the keep going even though I was sure he shouldn't and the automated turrets killed him.
---
It's only been half fixed pal. It applys to the weapons base damage. It dose not calculate buffs from perks and effects like ballistic weapons do.
---
That's such a sweeping generalisation, anyone with a well optimised build can be doing big damage. Blame Bethesda for not sorting out proper event loot sharing, not 1 build when there's others equally capable of one shotting mobs.
---
It would at the very least, help people find the shops. Aesthetically it would be amazing to have.
---
True, ballistic still stomps them damage wise, still they are better than they were.
---
Holy wall of text!
---
Looks like you not only lost maybe some notes, the game ate your punctuation too.
---
Thanks. +250 hours and i didn't know
---
Shame you singled out bloodied then, maybe blame the creators of events that don't share loot between all participants rather than blindly blaming 1 build.
---
I usually wave first.  If they don’t wave back, I move on.   I figure if they don’t wave back, they are not interested.  Also, I can tell by how their character behaves if they are new.  Sometimes it takes them a bit to find the wave if they are super new.
---
Yeah,  
---
I think you wont place it, in my experience it is always better to start from scratch, big blueprints never worked for me. I just stopped trying.

---
Modern renegade and crack shot still do and always have worked with both subs. Modern renegade even seems to narrow the crosshairs slightly more than ground pounder. Cowboy doesn't work for subs.
---
The fire rate of the M79 is the same as the scoped lever. Perked out you two-shot with the M79. If you use lock and load it gives the M79 a 40% reload speed(not the 30% reload speed in the description)
---
Longshot, tank killer and ground pounder don't work for shotguns.
---
If tank killer is supposed to work with auto rifles then description needs to be changed, like cowboy. I think the game would be more balanced if ars didn't benefit from tank killer.
---
I had a similar issue, it was that I had placed one thing on top of another. A statue on top of a storage box or a sign on a crafting table. Something dumb either way, but it was like 2 tiny things and a whole base had to be scrapped because "item is floating".
---
I shot a mole miner with my shotgun and killed it and I feel really bad because I realised right after. To whoever I did this to I’m sorry and now almost always use my melee weapon on legendaries.
---
Checking in a few years to see if it comes true.
---
Let’s hope for the best.
---
Red asylum is a world spawn; it definitely still applies, though. Thanks op!
---
The dupers do get some blame. 
---
I've seen as much here in the sub and I'm sure if you did a survey, more people would look upon them unfavourably more than favourably. 
---
Traders especially hate them. Really messes with the in-game economy, or at least what we have as one anyhow.
---
I really don't think not enough people blaming the dupers is the issue here. Like I said, there will ALWAYS be dupers, no matter the game. It's the systems that certain devs put into place that keep the issue under wraps for one game and doesn't in the case of 76.
---
In a future patch there'll be a new boss event like Encryptid or Scorched Earth with a unique Wendigo Colossus. From playing it in the PTS I can tell you the loot for that event will be great. For now, the best loot from the random Wendigo Colossus will be all the screws and acid you can farm off the Wendigo Spawns.
---
Even at level 50 it's pretty useless, so don't feel too bad.
---
Lost count the amount of time so have joined a public instead of rejoining my private, backed out ASAP then rejoined my private stuff was still there :)
---
its fixed on the PTS, so at least thats something to look forward to
---
It was litteraly as I said, an example of a high damage build.
---
I could put Junkies, auto rifle, stealth, bow. Any of those would be relevant.
---
As i said, its an example. I'm not making a point against bloodied.
---
Read it on here months and months ago, and it was from a random person so I really wasn't sure tbh
---
Another no-brainer that Bethesda is either too incompetent or tone-deaf to implement.
---
Yeah, I thought it was supposed to be a joke weapon.
---
They are slightly better. They are still missing a fair amount of damage from it not being properly fixed
---
public teams are an upcoming feature for the game, a "team host" starts up a team that anybody can join, no invite needed.  its kinda a first attempt at an in game "LFG"  
---
each team has categories, like "event team" or "building team.  when a player is on the team for X amount of time, a bonus is applied.   this bonus right now is assigned to the team categories (e.x. building teams are ALWAYS + INT)  OP would like the leader to be able to choose the bonus instead of having the assigned bonus
---
This is my life.
---
I realize it has to do with inventory size (don't even get me fucking *started* on my stash lag), but if they're going to have collectibles in the game then the game shouldn't run like ass-in-a-can when you aquire things.
---
Aye true enough. They should either fix them or release perks to boost energy weapon damage, though that would be a bit OP on heavy stuff.
---
I’m getting horrendous lag doing anything ATM, god help me if I want to use a workbench.

---
most of us feel this way in the beginning. it's definitely not a hard game, but it takes a bit to feel comfortable out there. it's normal :)
---
Either way Bethesda has let us down when it comes to power armor.  Power armor should be just that, powerful.  In what world (other than the wastelands) would a person in a red dress covering their secret service under armor have better survivability than a person wearing T-65? They need to fix PA.
---
There’s always that one guy...

Im mean in another ocassion, you dont have to be sarcastic and sassy about it, if you dont know hiw to do it watch Glitch Unlimited or maybe DemonAsylum, they are glitchers.But thats up to you.

Cries on console

Getting good gear you actually want to drop is extremely rare. A lot of time when you get a good drop it's going to be too good to scrip but not right for your build.  A lot of players will take drops like this and put them in their vending machines.  Best bet to get better gear is going to be hopping from camp to camp and seeing what is up for sale.
---
Make sure you collect weapons and stuff and  sell to robot vendors to collect your 1400 caps every day.  Before long you will have tons of caps.  You dont want to end up finding really good gear for sale and not being able to afford it.
---
Yup that is how I reactivated mine a few weeks ago and then it went back to normal every day.
---
Yeah, that could work
---
Yes, I change between my gatling gun and Gauss while fighting the SBQ and the lag has almost killed me a couple of times.
---
I miss being the hero of Kvatch.
---
TIL.  {hug}.  
---
also cross your fingers that your private server doesn't randomly crash and take all your shit with you!
---
Destiny has no trading even tho it was promised 10 years ago lol
---
I've had this happen once too, ever since I'm a little bit worried when transferring stuff. that time it was a full set unyielding. will never do that again.
---
Jeez I have friends that would glady hold things while I transferred characters I hate this for you
---
wdym by trades? because engaging in one on one trades seens like a bad idea, especially since a lot of players set up their vendors to be fairly cheap for new players. so yeah, just buy from player vendors and dont do 1on1 trades.
---
as for knowing whats good, and finding good stuff from legendary move or events, its all rng. for example i was cursed with pieces of nocturnal armor for a while but today i found a bloodied explosive pump shotty that also lowers cats cost. part of what makes the game fun for me is that rng aspect. just keep playing and your knowledge will grow
---
Agreed
---
It has leveling up gear and tons of end game content though
---
I started steeling all the sweet rolls, so I can laugh to myself, it was I you fool . Now in 76 I still do it.
---
Yeah, we all could have been an ethnically diverse group of hot 20 year olds that went into the vault 25 year ago. What happened?
---
Man I have such a cool shot like this I can't seem yo upload it to imgur
---
Dupers will find another avenue. They always have. 
---
There’s currently an infinite cap acquisition method in this game that I guarantee you will **never** be fixed. Because it’s not a glitch; it’s a required in-game function that the only way it could be ‘fixed’ is using a method that would penalize brand-new players.  But penalizing new players probably wouldn’t bother you, since it’s for the ‘greater good’. 
---
In the end, your solutions are based on ‘let’s just make it easy for Bethesda and allow them to use a bandage instead of fixing the flaws that caused the problem.’
---
You’re allowing them to just treat the symptoms instead of requiring them to develop a cure.
---
I'm only lvl 38 but I scan the map for newbs near vault 76 and will FT there to drop stims, healing salves, crafted food and disease cures.  When I was fresh out of the vault, I somehow got TWO diseases in the first half hour and it kicked my ass.
---
I did what you say and got lucky, they respond much quicker in less then two hours they let me keep the items plus a restoration of 1000 atoms.
---
I can't remember it exactly off the top of my head but something along the lines of.. 
---
"What's with all the empty Nuka Cola Bottles?". That one made me nod along in agreement.
---
Now I can't even sell them to a vendor either..
---
Exploiting existing broken game mechanics to benefit yourself and your friends, thus proving you would have been a better tester than the monkeys working at the company? Perfect. Using third party software to spawn or hack items into the game-world and selfishly using it to make real-world money? Not chill.
---
Not really noticed a difference having it other than critters die next to me
---
It's our tradition.
---
A big thing to remember is the Fed76 guys are pvpers so theres an inherent bias
---
Did not see your comment early. But it has only been half fixed. It only applys to the guns base damage. It dose not calculate perk cards and legendary boost like it doe with ballistic weapons. So it's only half fixed.
---
Had this happen last night doing a surface to air event I died....whelp better travel back and finish the event....died again......travel back to finish the event....get back event failed .... 108 caps to pick up my singular military ammo bag...but at least they are just caps
---
Yeah the “mobile” camp isn’t as mobile as advertised
---
but neither they, nor the armor sets, have all the mods available.  I don't understand that at all.
---
I do quests in waves.  Lately i have been visiting specific sites, taking pictures, just to write a few short stories.  I am in no rush to complete any one thing.

People tried to deal with the dupers at first by stealing the duped items. This resulted in bans for non-duping players who stole the loot, an automatic ban for creating/possessing a certain amount of items within a limited timeframe, and items dropped over a certain weight limit being destroyed.
---
Now, people report how it's done, the method gets disabled in-game (Whitespring Restaurant, Modus Vendors, Player Vendors, etc), and hopefully the dupers get banned, while they patch the exploit.
---
I guess for Bethesda that's part of the 'game experience',part of the thrill.... Will my world still be there? Can I pick it up before the server suddenly crashes?
---
Terminal entries would be very nice
---
It never happened to me and I've been using that since the introduction of F1st.
---
It doesn't, only fusion cores.
---
I wouldn't risk doing it, but lucky you...
---
He's misplaced the subwoofer
---
yeah it hadn't happened to me either... until it did.
---
I thought private servers stayed online for 15-20 minutes after the last player leaves?
---
I'm experiencing this as well and have tried contacting Bethesda to no avail. Did you find a fix?
---
The 'fancy' weapons don't even have mods at all.
---
Yeah they are great, I've got a be, Tse, and Ve. Had a fe but traded it for my Ve flamer. Wish I could get my hands on a je. But that's next to impossible on xbox.
---
I think it's 10 minutes, definitely not 20.
---
This is pretty awesome
---
It's annoying we have to use workarounds for some basic stuff other games have. If they don't want us to transfer items they would do something but it's here via friends or containers. I don't see a reason why some normal method for items transfer between characters is still not implemented.
---
That reminds me where tf is my robot companion. Also f the management who ruined this game I want my refund a a year and a half later
---
Maybe you have somebody of reddit staff to complain to that those ads are against the game's ToS?
---
Had it for a short while, but got rid of it because I found it to be useless. It worked on level 1 tics and roaches, but when I was surrounded by ghouls it didn't seem to do anything.

Oh, and it affects Brahmin (friendly/non-hostile), so you'll never be able to milk one ever again.

So i ended up  making  a account just to  respond to this.    I do not know if there really a limit of 4 but i hope not especially with the description change on the serum if  one day it really makes the sickness   incurable i do hope it sacks more than 4 ....   
---
As for Damage it self  it seem to vary on the sickness
---
This is weird but basically  i had the blight at one point  and it would  damage blood eagle and other enemy but not the scorched. 
---
While  having glowing pustule i would actually damage  the scorched (despite having only one sickness in both case)
---
So really The damage seem to be sickness related in some way at least that was my experience

If I recall, these are the steps:

1. Place a set of stairs you plan on removing

2. Place Floors and Walls
---
3. Place intended final stairs.

4. Remove support stairs and continue building.

If someone stays friends with thieves or cheats it says something about them that isn't good. You sound decent, you can do better than them

Better 3 scrips than nothing I guess... Yes, I have max affinity and was wondering why it rewards me first with 8 and again with 3 after that.

Aww this is cute!

Steam users get that until they link to a Bethesda account.

---
So you are using AP refresh perks and maybe a couple armour pieces with refresh? I can fly directly up maybe 4-5 floors and have my ap refresh enough for me to stick a perfect landing with no damage taken. 
---
I also rolled 50% less fall damage on my SS chest piece.
---
I'm always flabbergasted they let the jukebox on 'always on on login' but the radios somehow had to be off
---
Yeh and 3 armour pieces have weapon reduction
---
I keep a full unyielding set for that reason. When I buy a serum plan or hit the brotherhood vendor to blow caps on other plans, I'd rather get as much as I can.

Whatever you’re suggesting, even joking that FO 1st get benefits in game before everyone else will get ya downvotes
---
Yeah an item like that I would have gotten a friend to help with. Ammo, aid, or non-legendaries I would be okay risking it though.
---
Youtube, reddit and the players in my group are a huge source of information.
---
As to pointers, what is your build? Can you post it using  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)
---
This.  And I speak from much experience.
---
I felt like  its when ur ass is handed to you hard and your critically killed u dont get a respawn games saying go back to the start punk lol
---
Swarms, sneaky mobs, poison, fire, floaters, radiation, forgetting to put on your em prot PA, high rof enemies, shooting myself in the face with explosive guns.
---
I die 1 or 2 times a day now. I used to die 1 or 2 times a week. Its a bit more exciting.
---
I’d just rather they give us an extra SPECIAL point every 50 levels past 50 instead of “legendary perks”
---
Flux would be nice or at least a few of all the flux precursors so you could make your own of your choosing, already in a nuke zone anyways.
---
Hit several nuke zones yesterday, picked 100 raw florescent.  Ended up with 20 hardened mass and high rad fluids each....and then 2 glowing mass.  Checked every vending machine I could find hoping someone would have some for sale before the crap went inert with no luck.
---
Sounds super boring imo
---
Same, got annoyed when it interrupted sneaking or instigating weapons
---
It looks like garbage, though
---
This has always been this games biggest issue. Once you complete the quests, there isnt anything to do
---
 Originally nukes was supposed to be end game. But that didn't last. Then the burrows as people talked about.  So quick and no reason to repeat. Vault 94 which I missed but apparently was so bad they scrapped it and all other vault raids. 
---
The new content they added for free has been good. Wild Appalachia and wastelanders quests were good. But again once you finish the quests,  there's nothing to do but grind the same dailies/events over and over. And this new content doesn't come fast enough to keep from getting bored.
---
The rotating events like fashnaut or meat week can give a little boost, but overall get old pretty quick.  
---
The road map looks good but will probably be delayed and/or buggy.  I'll probably stop playing until the next new content drops. I've lost the motivation to keep grinding gold to get gear... cause what am I gonna use it for?
---
I lost more than 20 legacies when a paper bag became bugged and could not be accessed, even though it was right there on the ground.  I even tried having buddies log in and view the bag.  Nada.  At least three times I have lost items due to bags.  All of yall need to stop being stubborn and listen to players who tell you that unlimited world containers are the safest way to transfer items.s
---
I used to hurry up to get 3X20 treasure notes for my 3 characters that did wastelanders. This gave me stress and felt like a chore. So now I just dick about and don't bother anymore to get all my daily limits (caps, bullion, scrip). Liberating!
---
What platform are you on?
---
Not ‘INCREDIBLY’ rare at all, sure the drop rate was pretty low but there’s still going to be thousands of them. INCREDIBLY rare would be the masks from year
---
You are right about limited containers.  Always use the unlimited ones, such as the blue suitcase at whitesprings station.
---
me too.
---
"Scam / hack Raven masks" . 
---
Scamming implies they scammed someone, basically trading with them but not honoring their side of the deal. In other words, they ripped off someone.
---
Hacking implies they somehow found a way to spawn the masks in-game using a hack. Not calling BS on it but this sort of hack would probably be known by now.
---
It is important to make a difference between the two, because there are a lot of accusations of hacking going around since this game is so prone to hacking.
---
My honest feeling is that your friends are either BS'ing it when they say they hacked, they could have gotten those masks through trading or player vendors.
---
My two cents is don't worry about what others do and how they acquire their items, just be happy how you got yours and don't let hacking concerns spoil your fun, you earned your masks fair and square and that's all that matters :)

Since the queen is more difficult and the same, I wouldn't hold your breath for a change
---
haha, he said bl3 had good raids
---
Bethesda is already toxic enough so the players try to compensate that, that's what I think
---
interesting never heard that actually, maybe it is correct and should work like that or did day say its not fixed yet?
---
Player I just dealt with named Saul_Guud had vendors outside "on his porch"
---
Go to browse his vendors, and he goes into workshop mode to instakill me by placing some sort of contraption on top of me. 
---
Then takes loot and logs. How is that game friendly at all?
---
Insta kills? Really? Nice way of destroying any in game trading thats for sure. Told me he maxed his caps out three times so far today just doing this.
---
It is very annoying, I ended up with a Seedy Shed only, as I like to move my camp about and cannot deal with all the trouble.
---
Nice work.  The chance to get a pie from the machines is much better than it used to.  In the past month I've probably gotten 4 or 5, but admittedly I've played a LOT.  I consider the pie on top of westek an imposter and refuse to pick it up.  Only vending machines contain the real "Perfectly Preserved Pie".  Real men get pie the hard way.
---
Can't see them
---
So I can go to any random camp and just shoot stuff and it breaks, without being in a PVP state with players or contested their workshop ownership?
---
I'm sure I've tried that and nothing happened at all.
---
If you watch the video they are at 10 seconds
---
Yes that’s the case with me. My experience in the game are for example when a low level player asks me politely if I have some spare ammo I give it for free. Or when he needs help with a quest or asks me if I can mod something for him. I know how it is when you don’t have anyone to help you in a new game and I don’t want them to experience that
---
Bulk junk sells well as long as you come in lower than you can buy it at the robot vendors at each train station. The only ammo that people usually buy is 5.56, .45, .308, shotgun shells and fusion cells as long as you keep them at 1 cap each. Don’t waste your time and stash space with mini nukes, missiles and 40 mm grenades. Also same goes for non legendary guns and armor....... most people won’t buy it so you are better served selling it to vendors or scrapping it a bench where you could possibly unlock mods. 
---
Good luck
---
Imagine u get booted / disconnected f that
---
Wow / World of warcraft uses mailboxes since day one they are placed at general camps. For money or item transfers or just a message. Just saying its not imposible lol
---
One of my favourite all time classic movie!!!
---
"In days like these, I'm wondering what I'm even carving for...."
---
this is the same thing with the vault raids. the super eager people who play a ton figure it out early on, grind it until they're sick of it. casual or occasional people try it and get wrecked. nobody is around to 'lead' it.
---
but if they nerf the event and make it super easy, nobody will want to do it in the first place. how can the game teach people how to do the event better without it being explained-to-death. maybe scale the difficulty with, instead of player level or number of players, the average experience of the players (e.g. how many times they've done it successfully)?
---
Haha.  Ok. Thank you!
---
Are you talking about having slots for different perk loadouts?  Yeah, I agree with the others even though I have FO1, we shouldn't get any special in-game abilities just for being FO1 subscribers.
---
Do you mean the bunch of white grapes?
---
Lag like you wouldn't believe for the last week and a half. Doesn't have to be more than 2 mobs or players either.
---
50 cal is good weapon as it is, why would you need more mods for it? Maybe things like lmg or harpoon need bigger magazines but thats it. And I don't see point in adding 10 different recievers like rifles have because you default to hardened/powerful automatic anyways.
---
What i don't get is how can they travel with god mode on. It doesn't let you travel so you need to walk everywhere. I tried the glitch once and couldn't stand walking.
---
It's just graphics glitchy buggy Bethesda
---
No explosive damage. The two shot gun is a TS/33/25. And addictions to Buffout, Daddy O, Daytripper, Mentats and Psycho. 
---
I agree that the junkies is supposed to be better. I’m wondering if I’m interpreting the damage numbers correct from the screen. I’ll see if I can get video somehow and post it.
---
Lol yup
---
**Stash:**
---
* Weapons/Armor: Keep 1-2 weapons for different occasions/builds, same with armor (such as keeping a set of Power Armor for Nuke Zones).  
---
* Aid items: Keep a little bit of back ups so you can grab it from the stash while you’re out, everything else you can just create while you’re out there.  Only thing to keep otherwise is materials for making fluxes. 
---
* Misc Items:  Not really too much worth keeping in here, convert ore to scrap as soon as you can. 
---
* Junk: Keep enough for your to repair your current gear 1-2 times, and some rare materials.  If you are keeping super common things, like stacks of wood for cooking, you’re wasting space in the stash. Obviously, if you have 1st this can be disregarded altogether. 
---
* Ammo: Keep enough for some adventuring, unless you’re using a harder to come by ammo type, such as .50, then you can maybe double up your stockpile. 
---
* Other stuff:  there is really no reason to stockpile anything else, if you already know a plan, then there is no reason to keep the plan, but there are so few that are really worth selling.  The only Mods I save are ones that have no plans for them. 
---
* The above shouldn’t end up weighing more than 300 lbs max (And I can keep it below 200 in many cases).  Any additional space can be used for storing display items for your camp and items you want to sell. 
---
* When you have a project in mind (such as getting ready to craft secret service armor or if you want to move your camp and build some new stuff at it), farm the items before you craft.  
---
**Caps:**
---
* It takes minimum effort to get 1400 caps daily from doing things like selling bulk junk, weapon/armor drops, purified water. Especially purified water.
---
* Doing a handful of dailies and events on top of that and you can easily hit at least 2k daily in caps, doing just those things can get you to cap max in a couple of weeks, unless you are incredibly wasteful with too much fast travel 
---
* I *rarely* sell anything on vendors to players, and if I do its either themed stuff (such as my coffee shop that sells fasnacht donuts and canned coffee), occasionally I can make some good caps from the occasional PVP piece I pick up since I‘ll never use it, but in general I don’t even bother trying to sell armor or weapons.  I don’t need to sell anyways, since I’m often at max from the first two. 
---
* I also rarely buy anything from players, mostly just travel to their camps to see what they built.
---
* Increasing the cap max can’t happen until we can deal with the duping, in particular the duping of any item that generates caps (such as Nuka-colas or presents).  If the max was increased now all it would do is increase the prices of items since people would have more money to spend at a single time.
---
* We do need a cap sink.  Something that is appealing to everyone and can pull a lot of caps out, and it has to be permanent.  Without that cap sink, eventually everyone Is going to hit a point where they don’t need caps for anything and we will all be at max anyways. 
---
**Scrip:**
---
* The only reason to hold onto scrip is either A.) you already have a perfect set of gear and don’t need anything anymore. B.) You’re waiting on a sale. If it’s A, having more scrip in your maximum won’t do you any good.  If it’s B, that’s a conscious choice, and in theory your scrip will be worth potentially 2x what it is now.  You’ll already be flooding the market with more legendaries 
---
* If I have run out of my 150 Scrip for the day, and still have not hit my 1400 caps, I’ll just sell them for caps.  A shitty 3\* weapon can easily get me 500+ Caps for one item.  
---
**Gold:**
---
* We don’t know what the future holds for gold. We may or may not see new stuff when the BOS stuff comes out.  If you really don’t want to buy any more items (or have actually bought everything), just save the treasury notes.
---
That's a stretch. 
---
And it isn't an exception, same could be said with legendary or event xp
---
the guy being chased by a chicken, "Don't let it get me!" Had a good chuckle with that one.
---
Idk, I think the problem is "trusting" the current server to have your back. I have a good few friends now and we play this and can 2 or 3man complete it now. we only get lvl 3 with 2 people but its still good for treasury notes, xp, and chances at pleasant valley tokens etc. The glowing blood and glowing meat alone is a vendor bargain. We can usually rope in 1 other person though to hit 3 limit and sometimes we send them party/team invite and try explaining what they need to do
---
its a long event they figure it out and when they get 20+ we tell them to deposit and then we dump ours and boom one by one we'll teach the wanderers
---
Don’t give me hope
---
Thought that too since you can see it kinda goes through the tree. They just look weird the way the move. They look like videos of UFO's you see in real life. Thanks for replying!!
---
Those groups make perfect sense. You want to specifically hunt legendaries, so thus you want the extra XP from them. 
---
Same with Events. You are actively going to go do events.  
---
If you are choosing the public group for “Events” but then just wandering around doing nothing, changing the bond isn’t going to make the people in the group want to stay. And vice versa.
---
I've only recently started playing, haven't even hit Level 50 yet and when I did Miner Miracles a week or so ago I was a little miffed at the requirements to until I found out that the mole miners in Blackwater mines I think it is have junk that contains black titanium and are not terribly difficult
---
Because PVP is pretty useless, so most of the bad apples go elsewhere.  Most people on FO76 are just enjoying the experience and probably want to lighten their stash.  Why not give it to someone who can use it rather than throw it on the ground?  At Fasnacht people were dropping legendaries, leveling gear, plans, rare outfits/items, aid.. you name it.  I crafted a bunch of lvl 20-30 fixers, fully modded them and gave them to anyone under lvl 40.  It was a blast.
---
The ones for soil,water and air? They're for tygart water treatment, it's north of summersville. You'll get a misc quest to start it.
---
Don't know why you are getting downvoted. This is 100% the reason
---
The water, air and earth sensors? They're part of a daily quest called Ecological Balance
---
I also want to know the perks and build you use for that damage. I have like 5 magic heaviea and cannot get to that damage level nonmatter what i try.
---
Only thing I can comment on are fusion cores. As a rule of thumb, charging 1 cap per 1% charge (100 caps for a fully charged one) is the norm, though some people will only buy mostly full or full FCs. 
---
You can sell for less and the fully charged ones can sometime sell for a little more than 100 caps but that's the ballpark figure.
---
You mean the air soil and water ones? It's part of a daily, and it selects one of each sensor type, so 3 total. There are a bunch around the map.
---
Any other quests, like for the scorched detection systems?
---
One, you can price anything you like at any price you want. Make up your own guidelines. To help, I will share what I do.  
---
Ammo sells well. but it's easy and common to get. So things like missiles and mini nukes, which take up a lot of space, I don't stock. The minimum price I sell is 1 cap. If it's more than one cap, I sell it lower than what comes up. If it's 2-3 caps, I sell for 1 cap. 4-6 caps, I sell for 2 caps. If it's 10 caps or higher, I sell for a reduced price, but probably more than half. 
---
Food recipes aren't hard to come by. Sell them for cheaper than what comes up. Same with plans for camps. Plans to make weapons, I sell higher than what comes up, but not if it's twice as much. Same with mods for weapons. 
---
Armor, it depends on the armor. The more high end armor, like marine armor, higher but never twice as much. 
---
Same for mods. Higher but never twice as high. 
---
Food, I seel for a little higher than what comes up. Like canned dog food, or Nuka Colas, royal jelly taffy, fasnacht donuts. 
---
Legendaries. If I don't want the legendary, chances are, no one else does either. Often they are better off for getting scrip. If you find a good one, but you have better, put it up. If it doesn't move in a week or so, maybe consider just getting the scrip for it. 
---
Keep in mind, that you can only have 30,000 caps on you. I often have to go and buy things as I get close to the cap limit. Like a serum or such. Or mod plans for weapons and armor from the vendor bots. 
---
It's working for me. But everyone needs to try things, and see what works and what doesn't.
---
Yea I think giving us the option to like camps on the map would be cool, maybe just have the sale notification show up saying X liked your camp and then your camp will show up with a +1 for everyone to see.
---
The common ammo such as the 5.56 and .45 readily sell for 2 caps each. I've never had a problem selling them at that price.
---
You should try from bottom up,instead.then remove the unecessary parts
---
Really? Seems low... For items in my inventory, they sell around 11 times that number plus a few caps so i figured id sell them at a discount from what the bots sell for.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
That would be helpful.
---
You still can loot legendary enemy, if someone one shot it behind you
---
As a level 200+ player I am still learning, but mostly because I am old school and don't like spoilers... Give it time, you'll figure out what works for you, and reddit is your friend...  
---
Another user asked for your build, but I might suggest what type of weapons do you like to use?  Once you figure that out create your build around it....
---
I price chems 10 to 15c each.  You can usually go a little higher on Antibiotics and Addictol but personally I would rather get stuff out the door vs. hoping for that one person that will pay the price I hope for.
---
I personally would not sell powerarmor parts/frames.  They weigh a lot and folks that use them already have what they need.  Same with fusion cores.  If you are not using them ditch them.
---
I think it would make sense to give the player "free" fast travel to the settlement and a discount at faction vendors if you are a full ally.
---
I lost 10x 3\* script legendary to can't find you server bug yesterday. Balances out finding a suitcase full of legendaries at watoga one time
---
First question is what are you defining as “good”?  You can complete the vast bulk of the content in the game, solo, with what many people consider trash gear.  Sometimes “Trash” gear can help you get good gear (get a set of mutant slayer armor, throw that on and then farm West Tek for stuff, the damage reduction from the mutant slayer will make that MUCH easier even if you aren’t using a good weapon).
---
Oh sorry, I should have explained more fluently. So thankfully nobody has stolen from me or anything like that. What I meant to say was when I finally do get some Legendary or rare drops thier typically not for the kind of build I am so I try to trade for something that will work for my character. So when I say I'm getting "Ripped Off" I really mean I have no knowledge of what a fair trade or price is for whatever Item i may have at the moment. The problem is I don't know how to figure that out too. Fortunately someone gave me a decent amount of Presents awhile back ago s ok caps aren't really a issue for me, my main issue solely is I dont know how to get good items for my character or what events or whatever to do so and my drops are pretty crummy most the time. Anyways, like I said I definitely feel like I'm just ranting so I'm going to leave it there. I appreciate you showing some interest in the discussion and I appreciate the tips.
---
I could sell you the ultra rare ivory grip mod plan for the single action!
---
Okay, I will see myself out now... :-)
---
Nah, they're just for the main quest.
---
That's the norm pricing though it's not a hard and fast rule. Some people won't even pay the 100 caps for a full FC because people do sell them cheaper at times.
---
Nah.  People would just instantly ruin it with cursing/racial slurs/etc.  It wouldn't last a day.  
---
I'd love to see it work, but realistically there is no way to implement it safely.
---
You only get 1 of the 2 from the Raiders each day.  You then get 1 from Foundation and one from Davenport in the Overseers house.  They like other dailies reset at 8pm EST.
---
Yes, it's been happening since around launch.
---
If you decide not be friends because they "cheated" in a video game, then you're the shitty friend. 
---
I've known my friends since we were kids, the thought of completley alienating them over a video game is comical. And it speaks volumes of anyone who would actually end  friendship over a game.
---
Wish this could happen but my so and I play on different consoles ;-;
---
That makes a lot more sense for that part then. Thanks so when I got 2 in one session I was playing over the after the reset then. 
---
Is there a reason other daily’s don’t show up some times or is that just broken part of the game?
---
Yes, I agree.  I don't know why people don't realize this PA is Ultracite too.  So yes, ultracite is okay PA but Strangler is much better and takes the same mods/plans.  So yeah I'd like to finally get calibrated shocks one day.
---
You don't get queen of the hunt every day.  You get a random one from the Mire area each day.  You may get QotH or Idle Explosives or Play Time.
---
Some areas have more than 1 and you get 1 of them for the day.
---
It is not working properly. Though I don't think Bethesda had said anything about it yet.
---
My camp is in flatwoods right behind the church wher. I have 6 industrial purifiers there. Was a tight squeeze though. Never had anything attack them long enough to cause any real damage. I do have 2 turrets back there
---
Even if you go to these places?
---
Burrows are instanced location? When did that happen?
---
Same. The quest items that are in the MISC tab are super useful. If you find a Portable Power Pack, for example, you don’t have to worry about scrapping it and as long as its in your inventory you can automatically complete Ward’s quest every time you meet him for the daily.
---
In Fallout 4 it's implied that the capital wasteland super mutants have been at least nearly wiped out and in Fallout 3 it was mentioned in vault 87 that they were running out of "the green stuff",the west tek facility in Fallout 76 terminals say the fev has been neutralised but not enough time has passed to see the super mutants killed off yet.
---
Just got Tesla last night, trying to grab shocks at some point.  Probably have run close to 100 Queen Fights and still praying.
---
"We're having a sale on brooms... "
---
Your build is 10x more important than which weapon you use. You can boost any weapon's output by as much as 400% just using perks and stealth.  A plain old crafted handmade or shotgun will one-shot almost anything if you spec for it properly.
---
Yeah the gauss pistol is the only savior for pistols at the moment if you have an instigating or a junkie build you can somewhat make the pistol worth something sadly but that pistol would be crazy to have what’s the base damage after it’s fully charged?
---
Yup even after wandering around the mire for an hour and pinging all 4 spot manually  etc   just nothing.
---
The first time you get the dailies from the Crater you do get both.  After that its 1 per day.  It confuses a lot of folks cause you are like "But I got 2?!?!" =)
---
So you have to actually travel to the area to get the daily.  They don't just pop.  So like when I log in after dailies reset I have to travel over near Camden Park to get the Daily to pop.  I have to travel into the Mire, into the Cranberry Bog, etc...  Then they show up.
---
Much like how you have to travel to Foundation, Crater and the Overseers house to get those to pop up.
---
The asylum uniforms can actually drop from a few events (I forget which ones), although with a fairly low drop chance.
---
No, but I get weapons of the same type replacing my favor/wheel spot.  Gotta love not getting vampiric effect because last fight you found a different minigun and now it's the one on your wheel.
---
Well yeah the definition of what a "Good" item looks like is definitely subjective and will look completely different for each and every person and build to a certain extent. What I'm having a problem with though is I keep getting items that dont work for my character and I don't know how to figure out the value of the item so I can trade it for hopefully something that works for me. All I'm really saying is it just seems like I just am not very lucky with my drops at all and it starting to get a little exhausting trying to grind for something that just won't happen for me.
---
Well that's new since Ive gotten queen every day for 5 weeks straight.. But k
---
Ah ok thanks for the clarification it’s much appreciated.
---
I've struggled to get this event to trigger lately, can't seem to find technical data anywhere
---
Bethesda wants people to keep playing so they spend money on the atom shop. If the players get bored of the game, they will just leave and play a new game, so it is in Bethesda's interest to keep adding new stuff in order to keep the players.

The Desert Rangers are clearing out Arizona/Nevada from a tremendous threat (I count both Wasteland/Fallout as the same universe, plus in Fallout, Tycho [A Desert Ranger] makes clear reference to Las Vegas)
---
Np!
---
Lol when though?! I'm like level 100 and I still feel like I have no idea what to do or where to go.
---
They should just stay in the state they were in when you quit. Lights too.
---
Same for me. The lag in my stash box or even at a cooking station on my main is unbearable.
---
But on my 2nd character, level 52, he has a very lean stash box and inventory and it’s much smoother.
---
Then on my 3rd, level 10 character, it’s lightning fast because she simply doesn’t have much stuff at all. It’s definitely tied to the sheer amount of stuff on you and/or your stash. Only explanation I can think of.
---
Oh snap
---
I think it works how shotguns work so it would actually divide by 4
---
This a non-competitive pve based game. The dupers aren't  heroes or anything, but it doesnt affect me personally that they have a a bunch of duped stuff. Most people hate them though and blame only them for duping exploits. They dont hold Bethesda responsible at all, which is funny. 
---
I get what you're saying about "earning" the mask, but none of us that participated in Fasnacht *earned* anything. We got lucky with our completion rewards, because all it took was completing the event and getting lucky. Basically don't worry about you're friends getting it outside the event, there's nothing you will have in this game that some duper doesnt already have a thousand or more of.
---
These plans seem to sell out of my vending machine pretty well.
---
Another thing I've noticed is that if you turn the photos in to one of the settlements and then change servers right after, there is about an 80 percent chance that when you go back to Davenport you will be able to turn in the photos as if you never gave them away.  You get double rewards for the quest and full caps from Davenport.
---
Seems low. I mentioned above that the value listed in my inventory is 11 times lower than what the bots sell for. So i generally sell it lower than what they sell for by a good amount
---
"YOU WHAT??"
---
Keep all the gold? yes, it's one of the choices. You just lose some rep from the factions.
---
Likely the issue, apparently it's been fixed on the test server, so hopefully not an issue moving forward.
---
True. It’s really only useful if you I have a legacy exploding laser since you get the explosive bonus on each beam. Otherwise it’s dividing the damage and in my brief time using it the gun seemed to break 4 times faster as well!
---
Rain in the helmet visor.
---
Yeah, I have been doing this thankfully i was gifted some Presents awhile back so caps haven't been a issue for me but I really dont tend to see weapons or armor in players machines. I will keep looking though for sure.
---
Not every daily rewards treasury notes?
---
Anyone feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, because I need to know also
---
When talking .50 cals I am under the impression non explosive is better due to the 3 Heavy Gunner perk cards that are only good for non-explosive.  This also works well for the SBQ
---
The pump has a decent selection but compared to the other shotguns it’s still lacking. Same with the 10mm sub. I’m convinced if they added a suppressor and sights, it would instantly become extremely popular in the community (since stealth commando seems to be everyone’s favorite build). 
---
I love that we got new weapons but they do really need more mod options.
---
My method is pretty basic. All ammo sells for 1 cap. Everything else is half price. Nothing stays for long and I’m constantly getting too close to the 30,000 cap limit.
---
And here I am wishing my boyfriend would just play with me. But no he'd rather spend time with his online friends

I would just dump all of my missles and mini nukes into maliboxex. Instantly fill their stash.
---
What the bots charge really does not matter.  All FO games have really jacked vendor prices.  I am giving you my experience from playing for the last year.  You can of course raise the prices and sit on the product longer.
---
Personally I stopped selling chems in my vending machines.  While they don't weigh a lot as you get more and more they start to add up.  I now use all my excess chems (Sims, Radx, Radaway, buffout, etc..) to get my 1,400 caps from the vendors daily.

That wet blanket? He was salty af ever since he wasn't invited to the Greenbriar event back before the launch.

lovely story, but I can't help myself. Did you mean "gesture" when you said "jester"?
---
Maybe bethesda shouldn't have done that
---
He's an interesting case for me.  I find myself either Strongly agreeing with him or vehemently disagreeing with him on points.  He's very polarizing and I think he goes out of his way to do this because it creates controversy which is good for his business.
---
Yes i think he has a really shitty attitude towards this game.  But got damn sometimes after a super buggy play session rife with CTDs and other issues I find myself thinking "you know hes got a point.."
---
ugh, I have had all that shite happen and I always panic for about 2 min afterward.
---
I have Quantum on my X-01.
---
Lemme explain better cause I worded it poorly:
---
In the "Hunting" category, you get the legendary kills xp bonus, this could easily be interchangable with the bonus intelligence from "building" for xp, the bonus luck from "casual" for drops durability and possibly the endurance bonus from "exploration" category (for low levels mostly to help with hp, or possibly bloodied builds)
---
The "exploration" category's bonus could honestly be interchangable with all the other ones for the same reasons, int for xp, luck for durability, end for hp, event xp for when you run across an event that starts on your approach, etc
---
"Events" category bonus could benefit from having better luck, legendary xp kills or just more int for xp for normal kills, ie radiation rumble, one violent night, lode baring, breach and clear, uranium fever, irrational fear / heart of the swamp, all of these can get benefits from int increase, luck increase, legendary kills xp increase or event completion increase.
---
Casual category is so vague it could benefit from anything, it implies you're just gonna do whatever, so any other benefits is also just as valid as a the bonus luck for that one
---
Roleplay category is the opposite of casual category, nothing fits including the charisma gain, so may aswell get to pick one
---
And the building category is the only one that really only gets benefit from intelligence and no other bonuses, but then other categories get more out of the intelligence from that category, because kills &amp; event completion will get a greater bonus xp from that bonus than you do with building.
---
So I went with a semi-auto Rifle build and as far as I can tell I tuned it up pretty well but I'm always open for suggestions.
---
I get 11 scrip from Ward. If I kill the person with the stolen item and pick the first option which is along the lines of "I hope it was worth it as I had to kill him to get it. I get 8 scrip, 60 caps and then another 3 scrip.
---
Done what? Not not invite him to the event?
---
Nah. Given how this person has been since then, it was a bullet dodged.
---
When you say half price, what price are you using as a base?
---
So what do you sell mostly
---
&gt;The only ammo that people usually buy is 5.56, .45, .308, shotgun shells and fusion cells as long as you keep them at 1 cap each.
---
This is not my experience. I regular sell other ammo, and for more than 1 cap. Never for the full amount that comes up, but never just for 1 cap. 
---
It's never good to tell anyone you can only do XXXXXX. Because chances are, someone could be buying your ammo because they know they can sell it for more.
---
Lol, sorry I'm just glad I'm not the only one here. I feel like stupid sometimes when playing with people and having to ask all these questions that seems to be basic knowledge  to them. Haha.
---
Would be nice to see the more “traditional” energy weapons get some love, including the plasma rifle. Other than the flamer barrel, it’s extremely lackluster in my opinion.
---
Also after a handful of stealth changes that occurred when Wastelanders dropped, prime receivers were buffed and are now more effective on some energy weapons than they used to be. 
---
Some examples include the Laser Rifle, Gatling Laser, and Gatling Plasma.
---
It doesn’t fix the problem, but it’s your best bet for maximizing damage in their current form.
---

This, along with OP's issue as well. On PS4 here, though I doubt it makes much difference. It's absolutely maddening.

if you have any access to flux, consider priming your weapon

crafting 308 rounds is way more efficient if you craft ultracite 308 than the standart ones :)

Historically all of the reactive mutations (Plague Walker, Unstable Isotope, and Electrically Charged) have been exploitable by those wishing to initiate non-consensual PvP. 
---
I’m not sure if this is still the case as I’ve since removed them from all of my characters for that reason.
---
That said, having experience using one of some combination of all three routinely back in the day, I didn’t really find them to be all that beneficial and don’t miss them
---
I highlighted the quote above you, and hit reply to them. it's not my fault that reddit put it to the wrong person. I'll see if I can fix it.
---
The ad works by keyword algorithms, so when you search fallout 76 a lot webpages related to fallout 76, include boosting services or caps would appear.
---
Hes twice my lev and caps are super easy and I found pretty much all my own gear maybe not god tier but I demolish every.
---
Well seeing as how full ss armor has pretty much the same stuff as PA but can have legendary effects.  A non PA biuld is much more tank like. I stealth biulds not efficient Haha dont make me laugh dude if it wernt for me radiation rumble would fail every time encrypted the mob spawns dont get any where near the conduits because of me and I garantee my stealth cammando does the 2x the damage to SBQ than a PA biuld
---
This is not my experience. I regular sell other ammo, and for more than 1 cap. Never for the full amount that comes up, but never just for 1 cap.
---
What are good items to sell in general?
---
Dont know...but i made a little test, charge the thing and shot the scorched queen, more than 200Dmg in a single hit with no perks...dont know how strong can hit the thing with fully perks and all
---
I’d love to be able to drop a kudos in a guest book or on a bulletin board for players with really creative or well-crafted camps. Leaving a heart for leaving extractors unlocked or good vending prices would also be nice. Or a frown for a poorly made trap camp that I’m able to escape and is just annoying...
---
I agree with the terminal entry possibility, but see that it would bug out easily and would be hard to implement. Maybe just a post-it board you could interact with, using the emotes so the camp owner gets the emote notification when not nearby? Probably needs a cooldown of 30sec or so, to reduce risk of lag like shopping sprees on your vendors can cause.
---
No problem dude :)
---
It’s definitely related to weapons / inventory
---
Ah I misunderstood, I’ve tried moving the camp unit around my build area when I first noticed the spawning issue to see if it affects it but hasn’t changed much, changes how deep and how far I might spawn into the cliff but not really enough to spawn at the camp like I’d prefer
---

Do these things actually count as pre-war food once picked up? Ie. do they have a spoil timer? Considering the low chance of getting them, it might make more sense to put them in a display case if they don't spoil... xD
---
Well if you do all three perks for pistol it will add 60% more damage and then if you add bloody mess that’s another 15 so you could honestly do some crazy damage with that thing if done right.
---
No its all in ur inventory only counts to 999

I am not spec'ed specifically for rifles (I am shotgun/heavy), but here is what I run when I go rifleman.  Keep in mind my build is more QOL rather than just damage focused.

Yes I will fill that out and post it. So, Luckily I've always been pretty good at really looking at all my options and picking what I think will be the most effective for the type of playstyle I'm going for, however I'm always open to suggestions and pointers. I haven't gotten much help from anyone so I don't  think anyone has told me whether or not I'm on the right track. Si I'd appreciate any feed back given from anyone.
---
In your pip boy under the ammo tab you should see exactly how much you have wherein when you reload it will only show "999" till you below that.
---
Checked ur stash and inventory?
---
You need to finish the brotherhood questline completely if you have done this if you go to the bunker in whitesprings and into military wing search the desks there there are loads of YouTube video that may help too.
---
sorry you never heard a figure of speech before..
---
I avoid it like something I dont enjoy.. better?
---
It will only show 999 but you can hold as much as your inventory allows.
---
The point isn't cheating in-game, it's if they'll scam some random person online, what's to say they wouldn't scam some random in real life, or their friends? 
---
I understand that's taking the example to the extreme, but I also understand the point they're trying to make.
---
Very cool idea!! I'd love this. Last time I got so many compliments on my camp 🥺 that guestbook would make it even better.
---
I use explosive guns on everything else and ffr only on the queen. Consider how often someone would farm mobs and how often they might fight the queen, I would say if he uses only one weapon, use one with explosive effects. The imposter sheep is very easily killed when I use explosive effect weapons such as auto rifles and heavy guns, but gets harder when I use ffr weapons. Same with gutsys. I can one shot them with explosive weapon, but two or more shots with FFR. When you have a bunch of them, that’s doubling the ammo consumption.
---
Swapping servers I've not tried before, and that's a handy tip for an easy extra 100 caps.
---
With that clarification it just looks like you are trying to make a simple incentive to group with other people into this overly complex system of selecting a title and then selecting a buff.  So people won’t just be able to look at the title and know what the buff would be, instead they have to look at the title and then look at the buff to try to see if it fits.  So instead of 6 options, it would be up to 36 possibilities.  
---
You’re over complicating this simple incentive to actually group with people that streamlines other aspects into this complicated exercise in min/maxing.
---
600 lead scrap wont last 5 minutes if you are trigger happy.
---
There is a balance though. Development of new events and quests can be very expensive. Their best bet is to focus on repeatable content vs adding new stuff weekly. It would be near impossible to be profitable releasing new events on a weekly schedule.
---
Seems like you got the essence of it all. There are opinions and pointers but in the end your build should reflect your playstyle.  
---
However not all things are common knowledge, like the myriad of perks that don't work in PA
---
Basically the larger the blueprint, the less likely that your ever gonna be able to put it down in one piece once you relocate. I learned this the hard way when I had to rebuild my mansion cause I wanted to move to a nicer spot by the lake.
---
The trick is to manually blueprint save the more complicated parts of your building, such as glitched shelves etc, and rebuild the house shell. The last time I moved and wanted the same build I went around and took screenshots of my house to make sure the foundations and shape is the same
---
With all the possible grieving you could deal with in this game, I've experienced none in the couple of weeks I've been playing.
---
In general, anything you always need, like aluminum, springs, gears, screws, acid, gunpowder, you name it, sells. But try and put a lot up for sale at once. It's more attractive to be able to buy 5-10 bulked aluminum then 8 scraps. But maybe not wood or steel. Yeah, you use that most in the game. But it's also the most common resources you get from scrapping. 
---
You just have to ask yourself, would you ever conceive of buying it from another player? But the bottom line is. You have to just put something up for sale, and pay attention to how long it sits there. If it doesn't sell in a few weeks, maybe take it down, or change the price. 
---
There's no definitive list. For example. Right now, plans for mounted heads and animals. Hard to sell. Dupers have made so many, you can sometimes still find literally hundreds of plans in a container in the world. But in maybe a few months, they might start being sellable again.
---
You'd literally just look at the name of the category and the buff though? Surely 4-5 whole words to read is not too complicated? "Hunting"
---

---
Click, join, done? How is that complex?
---
Yea you have a cool wife... my wife usually wakes up screaming because I am playing video games while she was sleeping and not snuggling her.
---
She is a gamer too, but while I am retired, she works as a nurse and her video game time has dwindled; so I think she is more jealous than angry. 😂
---
Scamming someone irl vs in a video game arent just two completely different things, but it's also much harder to rip someone off irl and get away with it. Just because they "scammed" someone in a video game doesnt mean they're mastermind criminals irl. 
---
Is it a shitty thing to do? Of course. But it's also just a video game, none of it is real. 
---
Also, friends don't scam friends. If a friend ever scams you, they were never your friend.
---
Reddit admins don't listen to us. The only times they have ever listened are when hundreds of subreddits have "closed" en masse. Changing the ad would affect their bottom line so it's not something they'd ever deal with. Cynical I know, but I've been doing this for 9 years and have had to deal with them more than a few times.

If a display with an item on/in it was stored, you may have to scrap the actual display and relog to get the item to show up again in your stash/inventory. Happend to another guy earlier today, see [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hba6mb/weapon_display_vanished/) here.

What does this mean?
---
I havent done it much since wastelanders but queen of the hunt resets daily for me...
---
Why even make the change?  If you want your group to have an INT buff, just select “Building” after a few seconds people will figure out what’s going on with the group and either stay or leave.
---
The times it hasn't worked I'm not sure if it was because I ended up on the same server or what, but it seems to work pretty reliably for me.

I suppose I would say that my problem isn't really in the "Build" aspect of things but more or less in the progression of the game its self and what is going to be the most rewarding tasks to participate and accomplish.
---
Real talk though enclave events should have purveyer drop pool since they are kind of late game
---
IIRC according to the Lore in fallout 1 and 2, Energy weapons should be a lot more lethal compared to ballistics as "Energy Resistance" on armor was not advanced enough compared to ballistic resistance. You would have needed special reflective coating to make Laser mute, and by the time the bombs dropped, it was not as widely available. So most stuff, especially animals should jack shit ER.
---
I'll give it a go later tonight and test it.
---
Not disagreeing with you.

Just saying I understand what the other commenter was trying to say, in regards to those who hang out with thieves, etc.

That other people's reputation can affect your own, whether that matters to them or not. 
---
If I hang around with known drug dealers, people who know me will know I don't do drugs, but they're likely ti question why I hang with those people.

If they don't know me personally, but they know my friends are dealers, then I appear to be a user or a dealer, regardless of why I hang around with those people.

Since we're on the topic of how awful laser weapons are, I'd like to bring up why charging laser sniper barrels are probably the single worst thing about laser weapons. I'll preface this by saying that even though I'm mentioning Fallout 4, basically everything I'm saying still applies to the 76 iteration of laser weapons.
---
Bethesda did not design them very well in Fallout 4.  The way they work is they have 3 lights denoting the level of charge that works passively whenever the gun is not firing.  It charges roughly one level every second or so, and at maximum level it will deal the listed boost damage.  But when fired before that point at any of the other two stages, it deals a much lower amount potentially weaker than a normal, semi-auto laser rifle shot.  The automatic charging, compared to the manual charging gauss rifle charging also means that you have a very, very low DPS and effective fire rate, and if it wasn't obvious enough already, the damage boost for a full charge on a laser rifle isn't high enough to make it a worthwhile option.
---
But perhaps the dumbest thing about charging is that Bethesda put the charge meter in a place that can be obscured by optics, so ironically if apply a scope to your laser gun, you'll be unable to actually see what level of charge your rifle has.  You can only hear the ticking, but the meter is completely blocked.  Some designer for the weapon was clearly very, very ignorant when they designed it this way.
---
Dumbass
---
The counter only goes up to 999. Basically it's a 3-digit counter trying to display a 4-digit number. 
---
I regularly top 3000 rounds for my 50cal MG, but the display won't drop below 999 til my actual ammo count drops below 999.
---
3 videos? Are you stupid or just a boot licker, I’ve counted 18 videos so far and there is still more...
---
So you're saying a couple words to indicate what the goal is prior to joining the group is complicated, but joining a group who has a category set, then they change it would not be? If anything a player is more likely to leave if the category changes if they think the goal changed and isn't what they're looking for.
---
I almost did the same thing with both the scout masks and the three jumpsuits you get with them.

---
Oh we definitely had help. We both restarted when the updated dropped so we're both level 88s and we got it half way before it mutated. Then 3 random level 300-400s come in and finished off what we started which i'm glad for. We were in the cranberry bog getting lost in the tree forest.
---
A lot of serious vendors set up shop somewhere in the center of the map near whitespring.  Since you are able to see what's for sale by hovering on their icon, look for vendors in that area that have a decent amount of what you are looking for.
---
You'll still find vendors in different areas as well but the highest concentration is usually around that part of the map.

So, after several hours, my main boat is almost done. It's about the size of your smaller ship. Masts and rigging are done, as well as the hand rails. I have my vendors concealed in the hold, but there's a lot of extra space down there (like 4 foundations length of empty space. Any tips to till it up? Its tough to put anything down there with the slanted roof hull on either side.
---
Just let us scrap ammo
---
“Learn to price better” would be in the top 5 along with aggressive shots at your vending machine.
---
4. If Bethesda insists on controlling the economy with caps, at least give us an in-vendor countdown display that counts down to reset.  I don't remember when I first sold a legendary yesterday. Itd be nice to know when I can today instead of having to keep checking.
---
Yep. You're right. Pack it up, boys. Can't add a gun without ammo. If i didn't know any better, I'd swear you were already working at Bethesda! Impeccable logic, truly.
---
You do realise that you can simply join your private server and start a public team, then your friends join the server and your public team? That would grant you all the benefits of the public team. Or if you have 3 friends playing with you on a public server , just start a public team and have them join right away.

I'm not quite sure where the issue is.

Query, reserve if available, load. Server hoping is not a factor and this approach is easier on the server because it doesnt waste compute cycles loading in a player that will leave once they find their camp can't be placed. The point of reserving the location mutes concerns over game state changes and ultimately if somehow the reservation expires and some one stakes a claim down, the player finishes loading in and gets the current/original spot taken message.
---
I didnt even know this was a issue still, I've been running stealth vats sniper for a while and have noticed that sometimes I feel like I'm putting everything down easily, other times its takes multiple head shots to do a chunk of damage....
---
Im really interested in the info to, might have to adjust my build to compensate.
---
Figured on heavy ballistic weapons Minigun, 50cal, etc.  I feel like there's more bang for your buck with them.  I'm not real familiar with what bloodied, junkie, or other variants are or when to use them.  do those modifiers really help that much?  I suppose you need the right legendries to take advantage right?
---
I was debating ghoulish or good doggy.  I've used good doggy on my other character and it's kind of nice since dogfood is so plentiful.  I'm still working on a backpack, but that doesn't help with PA anyway.
---
I guess i was mainly looking at a second weapon class because guns do shit for damage it his game unless you've perked the hell out of them and at these lower levels heavy weapons just aren't feasible.  considering there is no respec (so to speak) in this game how do people get through lvl 50 when they want to build a tank build?  or do you just do whatever until lvl 50 and then start reassigning points as needed?
---
One huge gripe I've got with this game is it's hard to try new combinations especially when you only play a couple times a week.
---
if u like that, u should see my vault 88
---
Technically The Master was still working out his transformation process until 2103 and then started creating his army up until 2131, but it would fall right about now if the FO76 world runs in the same time format as the real world.
---
I'd intended on the Shady Sands set up being part of the new factions (even though it's a civilization in it's own right I suppose) in the OP.
---
That's right! Harold would've been setting out on his expedition some months before the Vault 76 door opened, so, he'd have been exposed to the FEV by now and beginning to mutate, and would have just been shunned from the Hub.
---
The Survivalist would have just lost his wife and unborn son recently. I think his first encounter with Ghouls was later, circa. 2110? Not 100% sure on my date guess-timate, that may need some further reading into!
---
I'd happily accept that as canon but I'm not sure on the lore of The Desert Rangers, I'll add it anyways tho!
---
He's talking about the new secret boss they added that wears a fasnacht jester mask and hurls radioactive candy canes at you. It also has a Cuphead-style laugh attack.
---
You don't need to tag this beast to get a reward, and everyone in its presence, when it dies, gets a guaranteed 3-star legendary. The game prompts you for which weapon or armor type you want beforehand, of course.
---
Speech checks introduced in Wastelanders were just another reason an unyielding armor set is super beneficial. I've cleared every speech check that I've come across since it launched. Super useful.
---
The clickbait title is a bit annoying. Suggesting it’s me who’s the problem when you can’t figure out the game (tons of online guides and YouTube videos to help you out) is just stupid.
---
I find it hilarious that he injects the words 'Greedy Bethesda' into stories where Bethesda is neither involved nor relevant. Guy's just a negative nancy that hates games and loves suckering people out of their ad dollars.   
---
Other reviewers look down on him and I'm glad for it. Only purpose Legacy has is to serve as a bad example.
---
$12.99 a month, *per one month*, or $100 for a year, which balances out to $8.99/month.
---
Also remember that value is subjective to everyone. I personally wouldn't pay more than 100 caps for that red asylum outfit, because it's literally a useless item to me. Not everyone values stuff like that so highly.
---
Just make sure to find the right buyer. Oh and try not to get scammed, because Bethesda offers no insurance lol.
---
thats before the adrenaline starts stacking then it gets on up there
---
Post some pics =0
---
The 3 raider crews led by Overboss Colter are planning/already have stormed Nuka World, killed the guards, and enslaved the traders.
---
In Memory Lane, the residents are being tortured, murdered, and resurrected by Stanlis Braun.
---
The Commonwealth Minutemen are extremely popular after the defense of Diamond City from marauding super mutants.
---
The Brotherhood of Steel leads a successful operation to wipe out the majority of the Pitt residents, leaving Paladin Ashur behind.
---
Curie is still locked up in the secret sectors of Vault 81, working on a powerful disease cure.
---
The early remnants of the Early Dawn Elementary students form the settlement of Little Lamplight.
---
All this occurs later though, so it probably doesn't happen while our player characters are alive
---
How will you go to your jobs all messed up with sleep deprivation...and who screams when somebody sleeps next to them
---
Can you explain a little more about expo and the queen please? I'm super confused.
---
I'm level 355 with over 750h and this is new to me. 
---
I see constant use of TsE 50. Cal and explosive Plasmas Gatlings and Laser Gatlings.
---
So, explosive isn't good on the queen? And what about Gauss weapons, since they have splash damage? Or do they count as a different kind of damage?
---
Did I miss something? A patch, or has it always been like this?
---
u need to experience it man 
---
add me if you are on ps4: Owl_No
---
Its the only thing i use the bash atk for. When i see that emote in a event i rush there, bash the thing once and go ahead with the event. Still, gotta remind myself to loot the fucker later.
---
Why did you drink a Nukashine? Or did you mean nuka cola lol
---
Would be awesome to attach a lantern to my backpack
---
New player here.  Is there a central place to price check items?
---
No bl3 has bosses destiny has good raids
---
Ah. Xbone here.
---
stop watching
---
The goal is set from the category, and with maybe the exception of building, the bonuses match up fine with what the goal is described as.  Role playing gives a bonus to charisma, so everyone in the group gets extra XP and Caps for completing quests as a group, exactly what you’d imagine for role playing. Exploration gives a bonus to Endurance, perfect for some extra hit points and resisting diseases, it makes perfect sense.  If you want to hop events, the bonus to event XP will outshine the 8% XP in the long run of doing events as a group. 
---
You’re the one that wants to use a different category than the suggested one.  You’re the one that thinks that an 8% bonus XP is better for legendary hunting than earning 2x the XP for a single kill (which if your group is doing legendary hunting right, should end up being far more than the 8% for all the kills leading up to it, especially if you have people doing things like sharing inspirational)
---
You’re the one asking for them to redesign the UI, create additional code into the game so it’s not just selecting a group, but then also a UI element for selecting the benefit.  A lot of extra work for something that really is unnecessary. 
---
Everything you have said has made it into a big min/maxing experiment.  If you really think that the 8% bonus XP is going to be best, then just select building and tell people when they join the team what’s going on.  People should be able to figure it out when your on building but currently located in an instance zone or doing an event anyways.
---
I love it.  I'm only a lvl 47 so I don't have the greatest stuff, but i have a "free" vending machine and always try to keep it stocked with non perishable food and other helpful items.  I try to make low level weapons for noobs i see wandering around and drop that with some ammo, water and a teddy bear or something fun.
---
I would agree, maybe make them a tiny bit less common in that case cause you load into any server at the moment and there is a 90% chance at least one is active. In all honesty they need to make all public events have access to the purveyor drop table, scorched earth is one of those dissapointing scenarios where you do this incredibly tough event and get only a guaranteed 2* piece of combat armor... then whatever crop is on the queen that is most likely a 1 star pipe wrench.
---
I appreciate this post because I have no group and had no idea what to do at the event
---
Yw, glad it worked out. Thanks for the award but it should go to the user who came up with the solution in the post I linked
---
"Unfortunately, Sunny can no longer dispense death as a remedy for life."
---
Cheers to that! Gotta love this community. 
---
Recently had some help from high level players myself during the Messenger event. I was in the Savage Divide going towards Toxic Valley. At first the mission was simple enough - I was on a level 25 character, having no trouble with level 5-16 scorched and mole rats. 
---
Half way through, I was swarmed by level 60+ ghouls that would one hit me. I was about to give up on finishing the event when 4 level 80+ players joined the event and made it so much easier on me lol
---
I did my part and became cannon fodder at least
---
Even revived a couple of them during some of the craziness. I counted 12 ghouls swarming us at one point. 
---
A relatively boring event became pretty hilarious after they joined!
---
FOR ME the most rewarding things are the difficult events and the easier events that have good rewards for the time you put in. I have to say that I run with an experienced group that has a 100% succes rate (on private servers) so the difficult events are not difficult at all for us but here it goes:
---
* project paradise: fun because it is different and also different environment than all the rest. Always a few legendaries. Great for looting afterwards. Rare quest reward plans include stimpack diffuser, bear arm and bear arm mods. A lot easier when you turn on the friendly AI program. You need bear arm plan if you want to find it in the wild or at the purveyor.
---
* encryptid: only event my main can die in so good for a challenge. Gives fixer plan as rare reward, which you need to be able to loot legendary fixers from the purveyor, quest and legendary enemies. You must do the Van Lowe mission to start this event yourself.
---
* scorched earth: fun. Flux and rare plans as a reward. Tons of enemies. Lately not so fun because of the magical weapons that kill her in 30 seconds. 
---
* uranium fever: easy event but lots of enemies that carry guns. You can walk out with 1000+ steel if you scrap them. Or you can sell it all and have your 1400 caps in one event. 3 legendaries (4 if you extracted enough ore). All other events I mention drop 4 treasury notes but this one only 3. However the event is only 8 minutes so it good time versus reward.
---
* radiation rumble: loads of enemies. Plan rewards like the radiation barrel. Also many legendaries but all scrip (not max level). good fun for mindlessly mowing down enemies.
---
When there events aren't going on, I just go on a killing spree in westtek, charleston capitol building or the burrows for exp en legendaries. Sometimes I join the other easy PUBLIC events because they give treasury notes.  
---
The non-public events are a waste of time for me.
---
You seem fun.
---
I regret doing my job tired I scrapped my PA during this night raid. It was sad. But for the love of the hunt I'll wake up any hour to get a beast I've had my eyes on. And honestly thats my wife. I'm out of job due to Covid so why do I need sleep? She's made that very clear. And I don't mind. 😂😂
---
Yeah, it does. After I got it first time I started to sell the extra plans  for 250 caps. It never stays in my vendor for a full day.
---
100% wastelands improved the game so much. You will get way more than your money’s worth
---
I have done so many PHOTO OPS and never given Davenport the pics. Rep grind is too damn loooong!!!  :)
---
Thanx for the heads up. Will definitely give pics to bot. AFTER i have completed settlers rep and buried WARD under his trailer!!
---
It's worth a tad more than 100 caps. 😂
---
This happened to me once in NW lol
---
makes sense.. thats what the button is for isnt it?
---
I carry 20k+ of the ammo I use. There is no limit
---
Have you tried using the small displays so they center up? I don’t know if they will just a thought.
---
You can get it off eBay for about £7, I’ve picked a few up for my mates off there
---
Hell, Diablo 2 and Runescape fucking had this. How in the world does 76 not? Are the devs that incompetent or is the code THAT much of a mess?
---
Whatever the listed value is. For example, the game puts All Rise value at 91 caps, so I’d sell it for 45 caps. I had a three star Bloodied Gauss Rifle that had a value of something like 1400 caps, sold it for 700 caps. I’m sure I could have gotten a lot more for it but I don’t run bloodied  and I’m happy to just see it go to someone who can use it.
---
And other bonuses fit just fine for most of these, so why not have the option? Extra coding, yes, so what? Should we just skip any potential QoL features because it would require some extra bit of coding ontop?
---
Now that’s podracing!
---
Interesting that mods are removing comments from this post at the bottom.
---
Guest Book too
---
It's not just you.
---
I believe you can check ask on the fallout 76 market reddit but don't quote me. The moderators can be fickle over there. 
---
This sub reddit doesn't allow trading post.
---
Really comes down to the right buyer. 
---
My end game right now is collecting rare items and outfits and some players will offer great trades for some of the outfits.
---
This is pretty frequently suggested. A good work around is to of course buy some stuff from their vendor.
---
Thankfully D2 mods exist for things like shared stash. PlugY is a godsend.
---
Also props for mentioning Titan Quest. Both it and Grim Dawn are damn good Diablo-likes.
---
Had someone drop this plan at a SBQ event, wondered what it was from.
---
I played at launch did the main story launched a nuke cause it was so hard with just two of us (it took 6 hours) after we did it I'll admit I stopped playing, then they shown wastelanders and I thought I'd jump back in and now I can't put it down with how the update has changed it 100% it feels like fallout 3 with the dialogue options honestly £20 jump on that hours of fun awaits so much fun 👍
---
where most of us sell it to,  the floor at 0 caps.
---
Nah I'm good. I got a few extras.
---
The friend whose server I was using suddenly logged off in the 5 seconds I needed to change character.
---
Not to me. I realise that other people value it higher, but I don't. So basically I'll never trade for that, because I would never reach an agreement that suited the seller and me. And that's fine with me, if I ever want that outfit I can just server hop enough to get it. And it would be free. 
---
It's why I said value is subjective to everyone.
---
I mean its still a 1 in a million chance you get a good one (Lol thats more or less the actual number)
---
You tell 'em, Mom! 👊
---
If you have wall decoration or the atom shop staircases, I've found those to cause this error. Theres no solution other than deleting the blueprint and rebuilding.
---
in good conscience I cant ever recommend a FPS on a console..
---
that said if youre planning on playing in 3rd person its a solid maybe..
---
These all bring back great memories they'd make you wanna go back and play through the whole franchise worth of games again.
---
Minutemen were late 2100's, but not that late that it mightn't happen in our character's lifetimes tho.
---
Curie is one I had to check the Fallout Wiki for cause I couldn't remember when she was first locked into the lab but it wasn't until 2204!
---
I think Little Lamplight was actually formed prior to present time of Fallout 76, as it was shortly after the Great War in 2077 that they went to Vault 87 and set up camp close by, but it would have lasted a while longer so I'll add it in, as maybe it did continue on as a civilization throughout the years.
---
This is epic, im so jealous! My gf plays as well, but sadly we do not own mutiple consoles
---
Oh sure, you comment on grammar and get upvotes, but whenever I comment on grammar I get called a nazi....  
---
;)
---
I like the one about hoagies, subs and grinders all being the same thing.  They are all ravioli at Sunny's.
---
how to know what stats stack though?  like speed demon gives reload speed +20% and lock and load gives +30% on heavy guns so is that plus 50% reload speed for heavy guns?
---
And subscribe? \^\^
---
I really don’t care as long as they don’t crash the servers.
---
Yes, lag accessing my favorites wheel, especially right after loading into a world, when accessing the aid tab in pip-boy, when accessing a weapon or armor bench and sometimes a cooking station on Xbox. 
---
I suspect that they are removing the eating and drinking debuffs to improve server performance. I can imagine keeping track of the degradation of every spoiling aid item in inventory, refrigerators, and world containers/paper bags has a big performance impact.
---
I do this too,  if I use the facilities and especially if they have a nice toilet (IBS in the wastelands is no joke) I'll buy some cheap  things from the vendor
---
The button is for doubling down?
---
Ok, good luck.
---
You know what? I was just considering Fallout 1st as I'll be playing the game for the next two months, until I saw the price. I bet a lot more people would have been more willing to pay for the subscription if it was $2-$3 a month, not $12. That's more than the basic Netflix/Hulu subscriptions. Are you effing kidding me? Forget it. I've already paid $60 for this game. They're trying to mimic ESO's plan, but they offer hardly anything valuable in comparison. Especially considering the scale of ESO's content compared to FO76.
---
rather have it drop when its ready than before...
---
Agreed, but its mostly one time thing where you pick best mods and never do it again. I'd rather have devs working on different things.
---
This is awesome! It's always good to see Couples play together..... it brings joy to both people when you can rely on each other in a game.   
---
Now if I can get my girlfriend to dust off her PS4 in the closet we would be in the money lol
---
For the love of Todd please do not tell them to release an update before it is ready.  That kind of mentality is why we are in this whole mess to begin with.
---
The Bethesda and Gamb-reation engine have a history. A very, very, buggy or poorly executed history.
---
Let them take their time with this. For all our sakes.
---
I’m on PC, I can’t verify if I still own it or not but I had a 1 Star Bloodied Hunting Rifle in my vendor for 100caps. I’ll have to check tonight when I’m home. I’ll gladly give you it if I still have it, if you would like.
---
Can you not sell ammo to vendors???
---
I am glad to help!  If you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask!
---
I just ditch all of that ammo in suit cases.  You can't sell ammo to any vendor and they weigh too much to sell in your machine.
---
Bethesda are the ones that have control over these decisions though.  If it is going to require more money to make the game worth playing regularly, then it is up to them to make the necessary changes.  
---
As things stand we have to either accept it or find other things to do with our time.
---
It is ready though. The only things that need work will need a lot of work to be ready. The content that is ready to go works fine and has for 2+ weeks of PTS testing.
---
Nooo! We dont want more boken products! I rather wait a bit
---
This is a QoL feature, we went from having no incentives to group to getting one. But you’re not happy because it’s not exactly the way you want it.  The system isn’t even live yet to see how the masses react and utilize it.  There are so many other issues and QoL improvements that we have needed since day one that would be better served with that coding than making UI changes to something not even out yet.
---
Its been a log time since I set mine up - you can check both the audio and game settings in the menu - there may be a Dolby setting (some games have an explicit Dolby/DTS setting, some are automatic and rely on the console or amp to properly decode and distribute the audio signal.)
---
If not an in game setting, then verify your console is configured for surround.
---
Gatling laser feels alright at the minute to be honest, mows down mobs with an never ending barrage and whilst it doesnt kill in 1 second like commando builds it stuns for days. Only thing you gotta watch out for is the wind up speed before they fire
---
Did you not read what I wrote? The only 2 things that arent working in the PTS have already been discussed as NOT coming in Update 20. Everything that IS coming in Update 20 is working perfectly in the PTS.
---
Only number at low-right corner shows 999, but when you'll have more and look at the fast-choice-wheel (for that weapon) or Pipboy you'll see the full amount you carry. With 3\* Bandolier perk card I carry around 30k+ U.50 cal ammo, 5k+ U. 5mm and 10k U. .308 on my heavy gunner.
---
Odds are they got them the same way, and is clearing out the extras after unlocking everything. You didn’t dupe them, you didn’t beak any rules. 
---
Are they illicit? Probably. Use them or don’t, it makes no real difference to Bethesda. The amount of duped gear, plans, and aid floating around these days, it’s blatantly obvious no one cares.
---
Hahah ok ,fair enough
---
Stooop😂
---
Haha, relatable xD
---
I think 999 bullets of .50 cal would last what , 2 minutes ?
---
If everything was working perfectly and there were no issues then they wouldn't be delaying it.  It's being held back for a reason that neither you nor I know what it is.
---
Who knows, it is Bethesda
---
I believe all arguments that are compelling tend to have a "grain of truth" within them that people can identify with. The question, to me, is this: Is this person arguing in good faith? 
---
I don't really know who the guy is and I am not familiar with anything that he has said, so I cannot really comment on any of that. 
---
After all, literally any perspective can be rationalized. Are this guy's statements worth it?
---
We’d rather have devs working on this. It is pretty much zero effort to write in 2 lines of codes that alter parameters, they would need very little modeling if any.
---
I usually don't comment on such things (not a native speaker myself), but this 234 word sentence... could not resist :-)
---
My wife just complains when I play
---
I always sold to raiders and at ally rep, it will be too soon if I never visit Davenport again. Tahnks for the heads up though.
---
I'm actually going to be adding PC within the next maybe two months, I'll have to try to remember to look for you!
---
I was happy when I learned that they had fixed the durability issue as in the past it broke far faster. But the new and improved durability is still a big joke. But I'm super glad I held onto my explosive energy weapons since release so I'm not complaining to much.
---
Scorpion claw gauntlet!
---
Nope. Only way to push ammo is to sell to other players
---
They’re 9800 caps I’ve seen in the top right corner at the trader near Ammo factory. I pulled the trigger on the atomic shop ones once I saved enough atoms. Very annoying as that may be the most expensive camp item by a long shot, but they offer an atomic shop solution that may be easier.
---
Even on rifles, I agree! It feels so *backwards* going from starting with the modern-ish Hunting Rifle, to having the 1800s-ish Lever Action Rifle being one of the overall "best" rifles... really wish we could get the actual Sniper Rifle from 3, or the Anti-Materiel Rifle from NV...
---
Duping sucks. It's why we lost the vending machines for weeks. That won't be the last time that legit players will lose features because of greedy losers who have to exploit because they suck at a simple game 😂 It must be embarrassing, tbh..
---
But when we *aren't* having parts of the game disabled as a **consequence** of their small peens, tbh what annoys me more are that some people in this sub who were just a minute ago complaining about vending being disabled are now telling newbies who found 500 presents to "just open them and enjoy!". They're just hypocrite sell-outs who only hate duping when they don't stand to gain. If you can't stand by your own words, then what kind of person are you?
---
So yeah.. Don't hide the fact that you think it is petty and stupid, but beyond that just try to ignore what items your friends may or may not have. Your Raven mask is worth a lot more to you than theirs does. You get more satisfaction out of the game than they do through the instant gratification of duped items and exploits. Stick to your guns, and don't change your opinion as soon as duping might benefit you.
---
Be better than they are.
---
how did you edit that post without getting an asterisk? because the previous post isnt what I replied to..
---
what I replied to was (paraphrasing) "the people who are down voting you dont agree"
---
Sometimes it sneaks in there.  The crafting stuff is common to find since it doesn't autoscrap, but occasionally you misclick or zone out on your sequencing.
---
as far as doubling down.. Im not the one melting down because someone disagrees with my POV...
---
downvote and move on yo..
---
Can you give me example what mods you want and what paramaters you want to alter?
---
Well if you think about it a few things may just simply have fallen to complete disrepair after surviving the war, then all after. (I.e records for music being played, weapons not being properly maintained over the years.)
---
That could explain away some of the issues with variety in the future.
---
Wastelanders is just a grind doing the same thing over and over. “Can I cross this name off my list or what” I’ll never go to the crater again
---
I would love a heavy barrel mod for the LMG, where it decreases the ROF and increases the damage. or at least a receiver that does that
---
Your pip boy will show the actual amount, you can carry as much as you want. The normal UI just stops at 999 even though you actually have more.
---
As far as I know, you can only buy the plan for the neon letters (named signs and letters) from vendors nowadays, it's quite expensive. Another option would be the pink(?) letters from the Atom shop.
---
Ok, take care.
---
I mean the campaign
---
Ok I think I’ve been sold and gonna pick it up, West Virginia awaits
---
Yes, this entirely.  I'm trying to figure out how to implement the grocer/chemist backpack mod to free up some perks, but I'd really like to be able to drop my 20% chem/food/drink armor pieces and replace them with gameplay ones.
---
I think hes saying it was a fucking joke, waking him up at 4am to play a game damn crazy woman, lol
---
isnt that just energy weapons as a whole
---
If you don't mind the game getting really stale after the story finishes.. yeah go for it. it has about 300 hours content and then nothing but grind and repetition, which is fine if you like that.
---
I’m mainly tired of the lag from crafting. Anytime I make food there is a second of lag after I craft something before I can craft another. Also Xbox.
---
Yeah that took a whole 3hrs to complete. Then the grind started.
---
Sights tha help aşming actively with a small acc bonus most important. Magazines that have different reload speed or armor penetration. Handles that work like stocks that might improve recoil. Receivers to change RoF or damage etc. Or barrels. They can balance however they want.
---
It's a very interesting idea, there are some awesome camps out there. I usually buy something from them, even if i dont need anything
---
I've stopped playing myself and i started when it joined steam.. So its not that long, that said its a good game, just dies when you finish the content.
---
Just glad i only purchased a month of Fallout 1st not a year.
---
I didn't scream. I gasped. Very loudly. I mean come on! We went actually hunting for that damn thing and got zilch. Yet, here I am just minding my own business in a blast zone tryna kill things and get more raw violet flux when boom. There it is. You looked at the TV and got super excited and jumped up. Bahaha and plus, you never know when a vendor pops on and has the T-51b plans that we need.
---
I sadly stopped doing events expecting to get a legendary Item.... its just not feasible anymore. I played last week on "uranium fever" and watched the legendary appear and die as quickly as they spawned. Then I wanted to do the event at Project Paradise.... nobody joined. The only event that I get a legendary in is in One Violent Night. That is because nobody really does the event. Even if there are a lot of people at the event the wendengo spawns outside so as long as you are outside when it spawns you are good to get a hit or shot on it. Other than that I just join events for treasury notes.
---
There’s a way to set two walls in one spot. One facing toward the inside of the home, and the other facing the outside of the home. This allows you to set a wallpaper on the inside and outside of the wall.
---
&gt;Their best bet is to focus on repeatable content vs adding new stuff weekly.
---
I don't see the two as mutually exclusive.  Maybe not weekly, but there should be a greater emphasis on events that are repeatable.
---
To go back to last year, yeah, Fasnacht was cute.  But the game was so starved for content that it made no logical sense to introduce a week-long seasonal event, rather than a new one that could be played indefinitely.
---
Is the Fast Travel bug fixed in Update 20? that has to be the most annoying bug as of late lol
---
I'll tell you why I think PA needs some love. My PA gives me +1 strength and my BoS under armour gives me +2 strength. I can carry more (not to mention the backpack's added carry weight) and hit harder in under armour than in my fusion powered robot suite. BoS under armour and PA don't work together even tough it's designed for PA. 
---
On my bloodied character I use X01 for the rad resistance in nuke zones for instance, pretty sure many do this.
---
Neo letters are spend as others have said. Around 10k with perks
---
As for the double sided walls the play has either glitched 2 walls back to back so that both sides show wall paper. Or they have the way facing backwards so it shows on the outside.
---
I usually get people that wanna kill the legendary when it spawns. I stopped having fun  with that event after level 100
---
Walls with Doors allow you to easily place them opposite side of another wall, you can then replace the wall (without getting rid of it) to a plain wall or one with windows, then you can change the wallpaper
---
I'm not too big on marriage but not gonna lie, I would die a happy man if I had this
---
Craziness. It has to be a mister handy.
---
I had this same issue when trying to move my camp. I ended up having to scrap it and rebuild. Luckly I remember how everything went (structurewise), but it still wasted 1 hour +
---
Im on PS4 and people are quiet on voice chat. Only heard a whiny kid once and that was during an event.
---
I had this the other day. Found the kidnapped settler by chance while doing another daily. 
---
Unfortunately though I still got no more quests the next day from my ally, and havent since.
---
"You can't just stab someone...
---
 ...unless you buy something to do the stabbing with"
---
Actually it just made me laugh, but I did need to buy the plans for a better stabbing implement so not totally inaccurate.
---
as others have said.. the hud only uses 3 digits.. 
---
pip boy shows full amt.
---
I run an Unarmed weapon, the Deathclaw Gauntlet as my main melee. The Nukashine alcohol gives a damage bonus to unarmed weapons when you drink it. You can really change the output of damage for many weapons by using different items in your aid tab. Many of them will stack with each other. Like one time after I killed so many enemies and triggered max Adrenaline perk card, I had alcohol, 4 different types of melee bonus meats, a magazine,alcohol, drug on, and a bobble head, My default damage was 6k per hit. If I was in stealth, and used a critical with a better critical bonus, my damage could have been upwards of 14k if I landed a swipe. But many times during a queen battle it’s between 3-4K and I have a hard time staying in Caution and also getting a critical on the queen.
---
I would have nuked his camp then left the server..... :D
---
Bring the .308 receivers fo4 had for combat rifles would.be.nice.
---
Aye, I know how hard it is - I got good news and bad news for ya.
---
The good news is, it's totally doable to put the epic swag and loot down there: https://imgur.com/a/tteXtty
---
The bad news is it takes a flamethrower and some patience to get it done :P
---
Good luck!
---
I have no hard data or tests, but I played around with Better criticals with a gunslinger and finally replaced it with Critical Savy because the damage increase was minuscule. I believe it is based on the base weapon damage before any mods/perks are applied, but it could be a display issue too. Maybe worth a retest with a target with way more hitpoints.
---
That would be a nice feature, especially if people who help themselves to unlocked food and water (which I don't begrudge) could leave a bit of a thank you
---
Yeah lol, it was literally a person like level 34 in a hazmat running up to her with a tire iron, it caught me off guard as I was running at the queen myself but then saw that and laughed.
---
I was tempted but I didn't
---
That's awesome lmfao
---
I was wondering why I found one of those plans for sale in a vendor! Glad to know it can drop somewhere, and I didn't accidentally rip anyone off by taking something they didn't mean to sell. :)
---
It happens, it seems to be getting rare but you always get that one knob
---
Note, this only works with brick doorways iirc (may be all brick walls but I think just doorways). You can double up on them in one spot, then change the doorways to different material or walls, and then apply wallpaper on both sides.
---
I’ll back up a few of the other replies I have seen so far. 
---
Fusion cores tend to go for around a cap/percent charge and most people won’t buy one with less than half charge (I don’t consider them unless they’re full). This used to be different when the game first launched but it seems like they are being given as event rewards more often so the value has dropped a little. I don’t even bother with them anymore and just drop them on the ground (3 pounds per makes me sad)
---
For ammo I sell 5.56, .45, .308, fusion cells, 10mm and fuel. I don’t deal in explosives (same reason as fusion cores, market seems flooded). Everything goes for a cap per no matter what it is. The issue here is you may find the right person to give you 2 caps each or something like that but anyone truly trying to find bulk ammo knows that if you are selling it for more than a cap they can get a better deal somewhere else. 5mm can also sell but I don’t list it because I don’t sell it and just give it all to a buddy. The other hot ammo currently is 2mm emc because of all the new gauss weapons but it’s heavy sitting in your stash so I don’t play with it. 
---
I don’t normally deal in selling chems but the ones I do buy when I see them (psychotats, overdrive, calmex, med-ex) I don’t even look twice if they are over 15-20 caps per. Another case of “I can find a better deal if I have some patience”. I do sell a few drinks though like ballistic bock and high voltage hefe and those get listed for 15 caps per. 
---
Power armor frames are super easy to come by so it’s probably not worth the 10 pounds in your stash. There’s a ton of fast travel points that have them. Same with power armor pieces, they’re just too heavy to be worth it. 
---
For legendary weapons/armor the going rate for not great rolls tends to be 10 caps per 1 scrip. So for a 3* crap gun that can get you 40 scrip they sell for 400-500 caps. At that price I’ll buy any 3* weapon you have and stash it so I can farm less for scrip. Don’t even bother with non legendary armor of weapons, there’s just no market. 
---
Outfits are all over the damn place so you have to research every one and price it based on where the market is that hour of that day. Lmao
---
And as for plans/recipes I tend to deal with this differently than other people. If it’s worth more than about 300 caps market rate I’ll toss it in the vendor. If it’s less than that (or ANY amounted head plan since they were duped into oblivion) I either go to white springs train station or vault 76 and drop them on the ground. Don’t feel like scrolling through 1000 garbage plans sitting in my vendor every time I want to find something.
---
It’s ok, thanks for the offer! I have enough cards, I don’t run too many nukes, maybe 2-4 a week.
---
I got to the point that I would just join the event for Fasnacht and march with the parade.... no use in shooting the sloth so I just stood there at the end on top of a house and then got my mask and rinse/repeat. I only got to kill the sloth maybe 2 times.... but the GOOD thing is we all got a legendary item regardless.
---
Most I’ve seen is a three way so far but they’re always fun.
---
I was in a fight at abandoned bog town last night, involving a scorchbeast, a random robot, suoermutants and the behemoth. Was great.
---
Pro tip: I had friends who made mouth man church donation stations and they would get people dropping stuff often. Theme is everything.
---
I've maybe had a 1 - 2 minute loading screen, but never more than that.
---
True. Have my angry upvote.
---
past updates have worked well on the PTS but when integrating it into the game vanila there are always flaws
---
Let's be honest, it's not like having a battle pass is going to make the existing endgame any less boring.  It just provides a different context to do it.
---
So basically buff it's stats ... Back to my original point: 50 cal is good weapon as it is. It doesn't need buffs. You would build best possible variant and never touched it again. And messing with ROF would kill this weapons character imo. I am not against helping weapons that are bad but 50cal just isn't one of those.
---
That makes me think shotgun damage is bugged or nerfed.. I bet VATS is doing the correct damage but default shotguns aren't.
---
I use the barn doorways, they work too.
---
there are plenty of times, during much intense action, where the wheel simply fails to show up or weapon swapping commands simply get ignored (ps4)
---
Gotcha. I wasn’t positive but good to know!
---
Yup sure have I have 3 toons main ( stealth cammando 93) secondary ( unarmed tank 85) last (PA heavy 70) stabilized is a most for this biuld but I still dont think it out ways all the thing you can get with legendary effects on non PA armor
---
Man, I use chems and booze pretty darn frequently but the addictions have been fairly rare lately.
---
I do *occasionally* run lowish on addictol (as in, a dozen left) but that can usually be solved but looking for vendors.
---
I honestly don't blame this on the engine.
---
If you had a look at the lackluster Legendary Perks on offer and the crazy expectations for acquiring them, that has nothing to do with the engine.  That's tone-deaf design, and there isn't an engine in the world that can fix that.
---
That and perhaps remembering the states of lights, would be fantastic!
---
Nah you didn't read that at all. They can gimp the unmodded weapon if they so desire. Not having sights is ridiculous. This isn't just for the .50 cal though as I wrote, other heavy weapons need it too. A pipe gun has more mods than the entire class of heavy guns put together. Braindead design choice.
---
God, stims are heavy as hell.  And what sucks if you're going to tank pylons you DO need a ton of them!
---
I wish he’d of given it sooner.
---
That's awesome. Mire inspiration to work off of!
---
4x crap is still crap sadly.
---
I had a similar thing happen finding a weapons case. It seemed to jump start the quests again for Forager. Hoping your issue is fixed as well.
---
I just can't understand what changed in the last few days. It was a real pipe hitter up until this last weekend and now it's a fly swatter.
---
I really need to get that lever gun plan, I have a decent explosive lever action that just needs mods.  Thanks for the advice, I do like the hipfire on the lever action better than the hunting rifle.  .308 ammo is also getting a little scarce for me haha
---
Very broken, mine only pop every three or more real life days.. I know that sounds odd but its true for me.. i gave up attempting the rep as my dailies are no longer daily.
---
I would be interested for sure, would at least buy me some time to learn lever gun mods in case I can't find a solid rifle.
---
Every story on this sub about “my wife plays le fallout 76 here’s a fun story guys” isn’t real.
---
beam splitter is only good if u want to get urself rekt
---
Ok so you gimp unmoded version add mods and end up with the same thing. Whats the point of all this? At least barrels for rifles have some impact on playstyle but machinegun is machinegun...
---
Yep i dance around and nothing then two days or so later they pop.. then nothing for three days etc..
---
I think adrenaline may be part of the answer. I have one point in it but recently there have been very few adds to get adrenaline to proc reliably. Most of the fights have taken place outside the nuke zone and with her unwillingness to land it leaves much fewer adds.
---
I've seen ads for the same site advertising RMT(real money trading) for eve online, despite it specifically being against eves EULA. It's the same situation for you as why it appeared for me:
---
You searched stuff about fallout 76, like I searched about eve online.
---
Google AdSense thinks: "they searched about this game, so I'll just put ads related to it up"
---
I'm daily/every other day kinda guy. Maybe 2-3h at a time. 
---
I'll do my raider dailies. I don't care at all to do settlers. The only worthwhile thing they have is the dirt plots IMO. Gauss shotty is cool but not worth the effort.
---
ANYWAY....
---
I'll do Uranium fever or One Violent night if it pops. Visit all the player vendors that look worthwhile. I have a particular run I do while porting around. Usually gets me tons of adhesive and other junk. 
---
If I still have time I'll just port to random places. Explore or w.e occasionally take a workshop if I know I'll be on a few hours.
---
I’m fine with it. My sense of “Pride and Accomplishment” doesn’t get hurt if someone has a better item than me, I just look to see how I can get it, and if duper’s make it easier, well fantastic!
---
This is true love! My hubby and I game together too! It's nice to have someone to share it with!
---
Some of the other comments do have a point - Public Teams will be available in Private worlds as well, so you could just use a Public Team there while having the world set to Friends Only.
---
I do agree they should do more with the base Teams system, though! It *still* baffles me that Team members don't share XP...
---
But I want the wendigo colossus event? And I want it to work and u know not have a game crippling bug. As you stated content is dry we need a next end game nukable boss for U20 or else the game will lose alot of momentum and potential.
---
Afaik vats is more bugged with certain legendary attributes. In some cases each shot or projectile is doing full damage, instead of the base damage being split between each shot.
---
With specific attributes one can one shot high level super mutants with zero perks into anything shotgun related.
---
Source: angry turtle videos and own experience since I run a commando build but carry a pump shotgun to one shot stuff to save 45 ammo for sbq.
---
Shotguns are bugged in VATS. The current theory is each pellet is doing full damage turning them into amazing murder machines.
---
You’re welcome. Be sure to pass some screenshots of your finished ship around 👍
---
I’d love to see more like a guestbook where you can leave a quick note or whatever. Would add a cool human touch to the game.
---
I have the gauss shotgun and against the calcined beasts when shooting it lowers half its life and a second later its life rises suddenly and I only did 20% damage
---
I keep going to bed at like 1 am and forgetting. I will be doing the captain's quarters tonight so once that's done I will :)
---
I was pretty sure you couldn't do that but thank you for telling me!
---
It’s mostly the accuracy that makes VATS better for shotguns. Or it seems to be. Turn your damage numbers on and shoot stuff in the face until it looks right. Have you changed any of your perks or anything?
---
Reminder: Fallout 1-Tactics are not canon to Fallout 3+. They have flat out said they will retcon things for the sake of their goals and writing. They \*are\* separate worlds.
---
What's the point of "no I won't accept your quest" line? It's an RPG, it's about having choices. Up to the player how to play. As I already told, they can mimic functionality differences. Just read above again.
---
What's your stake in this really, you sound like developing this will come out of your pocket. Relax man, it's some content that they should have already done at launch.
---
I’m a married woman who would like to have my husband rush to play video games with me. For the record, that’s not a complaint about my husband. We just have different hobbies, which I’m happy about, but I could use an occasional assist.
---
I only get my dailies every three days.. and the hunt down a crater person daily i've not had for weeks.. its always the 3 tubes, my foundation daily is bugged and it wont remove the item from my inventory.. my rep when i attempt it seems to reset as well........
---
Had the same thing happen...but I found the captured settler in the tunnels of Riding Shotgun...very strange. Anyway it didn't fix the problem, same broken nonsense the next day. Goodluck though.
---
I got excited for a moment, then re-read that you said extra scrip, not treasury notes. Going back to sleep now ...
---
The only daily quests that reward treasury notes are the daily rep quests and Davenport to take pictures. You get a total of 9, 3 from each one. 
---
After that, only public events will give you notes and they vary in the amount rewarded, from 2 to 4. Regular dailies only give caps, scrip and random item rewards.
---
Very cool
---
Your idea is too effective and too simple for most people here to understand I guess. People could also just remove doors completely and wall them in but I’m sure that simple idea will also be downvoted.
---
Cool. If need be, can always screencap this and make it your desktop.  
---
HEY, CLOAKEDSTOAT! YOU WANTED TO CHECK OUT MRBRIGHT01's CAMP WHEN YOU GET 76 FOR PC!
---
Thanks.  Lol yeah i have the final word so the fire rate is even higher. So 1:30 probably.
---
Oh nice. I never use chems or food for buffs, as I am quite strong without them but I did know about most of the effects, just not the nukashine. Thanks for the explanation
---
Dont see a build link champ.
---
Thanks all. Got it.
---
That's sweet! I collect and display stuff at my CAMP as well. Didnt think about collecting bats
---
I picked it up when the reviews bombed it originally and the price dropped to &lt;$10, and played it once. After it crashed 3x just while trying to create my character, I shelved it.  
---
Picked it back up after Wastelanders, and have dumped an embarrassing number of hours into it, mostly from exploring the map after I completed the story missions lol   
---
And when I get bored in the main game I'll hop over and play some NW for some easy XP and random rewards.
---
So shotguns are suppose to wet kiss enemies not actually do damage lol ok
---
The laser rifle is in such a sorry state.
---
Which is how a shotgun should work...
---
Easy there, Thanos. We don't need another "accident."
---
&gt; Ok?
---
Don't "Ok?" me, I am exactly correct here. Fallout 4 is the type of game you're not intended to keep playing once you've completed the one-and-done quests. 
---
&gt; My point is I feel like there is repeatable content
---
In Fallout 4? No way in hell are players intended to play those radiant quests for 40+ hours after they've completed every quest. They're side content. This is  FAR different than Fo76, an online mmo, with a live service roadmap and repeatable events like Scorched Earth and the like. 
---
&gt; The point is if people want weekly new content they should expect much more aggressive monetization
---
You've got a point here. They really need to just make this a subscription game because the content is suffering.
---
Shot guns become super OP  in vats by wearing a single 3* legedary armor piece that has 3rd perk take 15% less damage while blocking. See YouTube's Angry turtle magic shotguns a month or so ago.
---
You could always put a link to adblock plus or ublock origin right next to the ad container. 
---
I never said that lol ok
---
My Rifleman Build is posted if you wanna take a look at it..
---
I play a male character and have no interest in cross dressing so collecting rare female outfits holds no appeal to me. I know you can sell them for tons of caps but I'm almost always nearly maxed on caps anyway so what would be the point?
---
I hear you, man
---
I did it just the other day, in fact.
---
Tell you what I'm not seeing anymore, though - is Manhunt showing up every hour.  Which is a shame, it was a good way to deal with that Complete Events weekly.  Even if it was funny that Mad Dog Malone could simultaneously try to escape jail, and be hiding at Grafton Dam.  I maintain there's some kind of kinky game going on between Mad Dog and the Waaarden.
---
And THAT, ladies and gentlemen, is why Bethesda's strategy of turning a blind eye to dupers, hackers, and cheaters is so bad for the game's overall health.
---
Grrreeeatt
---
i have a luck of 4 and found one last week in bolton greens. then 2 days ago i did the event again and i went to take a look and it was there again. seems like a good spot.
---
Thank you! Got a Hunter’s Long Coat! First time this character has encountered one “in the wild”.
---
Check now.
---
I have done it 3 times in the last 2 days
---
When u are using glitches for dupe the ammo to Gauss Minigun - Ultracite 2mm - then it's a time-saver too. Duping ammo for self using only - that's a fair. Grind for the ammo is a sad joke.
---
You have seen how much time it takes them to do simpliest thing... And add some more time to fix bugs introduced with it. So thats why I don't want them to focus on something so unimportant like this, instead of giving us some content.
---
Scraped the camo jumpsuit when I got it.its funny how things work.remember having those masks that dont drop anymore as well.
---
Done this before. Accidentally scrapped my shielded under armor because the highlight cursor jumped up to the top instead of staying where I was scrapping from at the bottom. 
---
Gets easier later, as all legendary armor with custom paint you can’t do anything with accidentally, all I did was favourite my underarmor, adds it to the wheel but small price to pay.
---
Maybe that's it then. I had a different armor set up last week. Maybe one of them had the blocking attribute. Well shit then. I guess I wish I had that back.
---
Rename your preciouses at a work bench, enter the names in ALL CAPS so they're easier to differentiate from the stuff you're selling.
---
Lucky devil. I got a clean spacesuit which i already have on another character
---
I would if I could dude, PC
---
They definitely won't implement open text for that. Can you imagine the abuse people would leave? If they had a list of phrases to choose to leave (or even buy phrases to leave from the atom shop) then it could work.
---
Wow, very nice shot my dude!
---
It would be nice if laser weapons had no recoil!
---
Yeah this is content some deeply care for, while I understand you may not care for it, some of us do care a lot for it. I'm fairly sure they can employ some modders to work on nickels if they're really starved for staff which seems they aren't based on the stuff they spam on atom shop.
---
Best. Wife. EVER.
---
Or put a ! At the front, then they sort to the top as well.
---
It's ridiculous. I've had it completely freeze where I have to exit altogether, &amp; I've had it freeze enough to almost kill me in boss battles. Something is very wrong with it, and it is maddening.
---
My bf and I play video games a lot and I finally convinced him to get 76!
---
Yes it was disappointing.  But if it was more difficult people would complain it was too hard and then it would just get nerfed later anyways.
---
The majority of the player-base of this game has issues with mechanics in general whether they be easy or complex.  People can't grasp how to do simple events such as project paradise or radiation rumble and i bet you'd be shocked at how many people have actually launched a nuke.  
---
It's the same as the Burrows.  Remember how hyped we were for that only to be let down at how easy it was?
---
Eh, it’s PVE rather than PVP, so not really.
---
That's kinda cool. I've played a couple games on my XbOne and PS4 through my Pixel but haven't tried FO76 yet.
---
Awesome story! I am still working on getting my boyfriend to play fallout with me :(
---
Great idea but we’ve been suggesting this for months. They just don’t care enough for this type of content.
---
You know...i think i may do a 3rth character...just for this purpose...pvp character or so e.e...
---
I maintain that the damage numbers against the Queen with sneak melee are wrong.
---
The Queen supposedly has something like 32,000 HP.  If I dealt 7,000 a hit, which is what the damage number claims when I hit her, she should be dead in 15 hits from me alone.  But she never is.  It shaves off a chunk, but nowhere near what you'd expect for that much damage.
---
The suspicion I've heard from people in-the-know is that the sneak damage is erroneously being added to the damage number before taking into account her 70% damage reduction.
---
Yeah wasn't intended to be click bait. Also the purpose is to get some guidance just like all thos things you just mention. This to is a resource. I apologize if a "title" inconvenienced you. Thank you have a good day.
---
Hum, yea, thus the PTS..
---
Also the leader would have to choose regardless, the only difference is that it won't change the category, thus be more clear to potential teammates joining.
---
I dont know about you but my assaultron glitched out and was stuck in forever stealth amd always had its head laser charged. 2and best boss fight I've had in the game since the SBQ.
---
Besides that though, 79 raid was pretty easy.
---
It's quite a common 3rd perk, hop some vendors I bet you will find another.
---
Beautiful.
---
Favorite the weapons / armor - that way you get the warning.

To put wallpaper on both sides
---
1. Put down 2 foundations.
---
2. In between these 2 foundations put a door wall 
---
3. Put another door wall in between the 2 foundations if you spin it youll see it fits.
---
4. Change door wall to watever other wall
---
5. Wallpaper both sides
---
6. Delete on of the foundations (optional)

---
This is a must watch (for me) in regards to custom ini and possible fixes/increase in fps etc
---
All credit to Angry Turtle of course :)
---
That's your problem, the bug fix was just to check the last 2 digits of your character level!
---
Do you need a hug?
---
The mods:gotta scrap weapons and hope you get lucky
---
The plan:gotta read plans in pip boy under notes tab
---
Weapon breaking:it’s not that bad at high level but it’s still easy to repair weapons
---
Does someone need a hug?
---
Ah gotcha, thank ya
---
Really? There is no reasonable endgame and you care about sights. I guess everyone has different priorities.
---
I hope not.
---
It's pretty much the *only* thing of value that grinding rep with the Settlers, and having to deal with Ward's smug face everyday, offers.  The Gauss Shotgun is what people want, not poop grenades.
---
They should let us sell unwanted gold plan items to Mortimer and fake Vault guy for bullion. Exchanging for scrip is a monetary downgrade. All this stuff should stay in the gold tier of the economy.
---
Yeah I dont understand how come. I'm a pathetic lvl36 and I started the Cryptid even because I followed that quest line with the Wolf or what-have-you.
---
I immediately knew I had to interact with those pilons. Sure I got killed almost immediately but at least I gave it a try with the pilons. Wasnt a good idea doing that at my level . Got two shotted all the time and then I just left lol.
---
One of my alts runs a shotgun build and I can confirm that damage seems to be random or at least reported inconsistently on screen. 
---
That being said, the Gauss Shot Gun is always godly, and I highly recommend the Foundation Grind to get it.
---
Nice one, sadly nothing of note on him for me.
---
The funny thing is that if the Bull Barrel did nothing except add armor penetration, it would still immediately become the best possible pistol mod just for that one effect alone.
---
I am on PS4. I will give you mine.
---
The main reason I assume you can't make a public team and join a private server is because you gotta make a private team in order to join a private world. Public Teams afaik you can't make in the main menu, Public Teams have to be made in-game. If you join a private world, you can't leave the team to make a public team because then that should(iirc) kick everyone who isn't a 1st member.
---
Yeah I guess the amount of effort required to add in sights rivals endgame quests and events, definitely a monumental challenge for Bethesda. Since they just added heavy guns weapons, that must be the reason why endgame lacks stuff.
---
Oh wait..
---
I got to one late and out of ammo (on main weapons) the other day.  Missed every shot I took from distance trying to get there.  The fat boys were eating too damn fast.
---
Yes ,that would be a good feature. Never scrapped something by accident but I totally want that feature.
---
have you tried renaming so its always at the bottom of the list?
---
First of all forget all about FO4. Learn this game as you play it and don't try making comparisons or you're in fir a hard time.
---
 You can't remove mods. It's not FO4.
---
That's a great idea. From both of you.
---
Pretty sure they can't destroy/remove your stuff unless they did that griefing tactic that's getting removed soon.
---
Where they hit one of their friends who's not on the team and you become aggro to them so they can destroy your shit.
---
At this point, i suspect that they're going to added to the BoS's vendor pool when they arrive to give a reason to buy things from them.
---
You know what's funny, all they need to do is copy their own game ESO because it has all these mechanics.
---
You know all the massive piles of scorchbeast shit that this game got when it released? That was because it was released way too early. I’d rather wait for updates than have them be rushed and majorly break something. Nobody wants to end up like that Vault 94 guy that lost his entire inventory.
---
Me too, I prefer the dense mod much of the time, the Jetpack is for fun.
---
Still don’t have my DE15
---
Lucky this time, I almost always find him with Skeleton Costume and Witch Hat 😕
---
You really have no way to know that.
---
I'd rather it be released when it's ready than rush it out had have people complaining broken.
---
Bethesda really can't win: complain when you hear nothing, complain when you do, complain when new content is being held up to be polished, complained that its released early and has errors. Sheesh.
---
"Found a couple hundred dollars. At least i'll have some kindling tonight."
---
The feeling every time i find pre-war money.
---
I really hope they will have some more Vault 79 content in the future, after Dungeons and Vault raids come back.
---
If the USSS were a faction, they could have their own flavor of raids in which they put a distress signal and we help them defend the Vault against various enemies, for example a Ghouls' uprising from a section of the Vault that we help Digger claim back, or from an invasion of scorched creatures from the nearby Fissure site.
---
With the reward being gold bullion directly rather than treasury notes, and of course reputation and new plans to buy when we reach new levels, like the existing factions, which I'm sure is a pattern that the devs want to keep going forward.
---
For the new event, is it triggered by nuking?
---
What is your current character I might have something to help you with pvp depending on what system
---
And add the mods to the production terminals.
---
How the heck did you finish the game in 3 hours ? There are loads of sidequests. 
---
I never play a game for more than 3 hours a day.
---
You can't remove mods from weapons, only relplace them.
---
Did you learn the plan for the armor or a mod for it. Gotta learn one before the other. 
---
You can use perks and weapon mods to manage durability to an extent.
---
Forget FO4, this is a very different game. 2nd time trying to write this, hit post early by accident lol.
---
Best thing you can do to optimize your build(s) is learn to play without utility perks.

---
Sure, you want sighs, someone else wants photo frames someone else wants postboxes etc. Lets all run laps arount Westek while this stuff gets added...
---
lol wat
---
Have you tried scrapping her station, replacing it, then relogging to reset the quest?
---
Probably they want to keep it for a future update that focuses on the Enclave just like this year focuses on the Brotherhood.
---
Absolute underrated classic!
---
Just the wastelanders quest. I already had everything else done. Just was waiting on the update which didn’t take very long
---
Nothing changed in the last few days.
---
Equip a "less 25% damage while blocking" piece of armor and you will get the magic back
---
Yeah. I breezed threw it without any issue. Kept waiting for something big to happen. It was much harder the second time when I went with my buddy. I had already done the raiders and he went settlers. I also had to leave for a bit to do something. When I got back I tried to catch up and just got destroyed by the laser turrets. Took me a while to catch up with him haha
---
Camp building was made a month before the game was announced.
---
 It's like the game assumes that 60 is the highest-level player that will attempt anything, so when you roll through with your 200+ character clad head to toe in god roll armor, carrying 6 weapons that each defy the laws of god and of man, you're not going to face much of a challenge.
---
Funny thing about any sort of “canon” in works of fiction. Only the current IP owners can decide what fits or if it matters.
---
Duping makes items accessible
---
I use a Quad/Vats crit/reduced weight double barrel. I have used it for weeks and I haven’t noticed a difference in my VATS damage. Still a monster as long as I’m using VATS with my perks.
---
And yes explosive shotguns should benefit from Demo expert. I personally don’t like explosive shotguns due to the self inflicted damage but that’s just me.
---
I’ll let you know by 8pm EST cause I won’t be home till 7, if I don’t respond by then just send me a message/comment in case I forget.
---
So you were once an audiophile like me... Then you took a base to the ear.
---
I'll see myself out.
---
That’s true. The numbers never come out right, I normally throw over 50 swings w/faster swing speed melee. All whilst doing 3k or 4K per swing, which has to be wrong cause that’s way more than 32,000 HP.
---
&gt;!Yes, but the boss fight takes place in a non-nuked interior!&lt;
---
Oh... but still, 3 hours ?
---
Not doubting your word but I find it just a tad hard to believe I could do it in such a short time.
---
There are also other sidequests and other main quests. Which are superb. Random encounters ,events ...I dont know maybe because I played only a few hours before Wastelanders.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_Laser_gun_aligned_automatic_barrel_(plasma_gun)
---
Might be listed as a laser gun, possibly. Not sure how up to date the wiki is though.
---
What’s NW?
---
Alright, thanks!
---
Yeah it does like, more bullets to put in my 50. Cal. Never meet a alpha hermit, sheepsquatch, scorchedbeast, and etc. I can’t beat, just need more bullets for that extra Rambo feeling I get just unloading the whole container.
---
1. Can't swap weapon mods. Either scrap weapons to get a chance at learning a random mod, read plans to learn mods, or buy mod components for a one-time use.
---
2. Plans are strange. I believe if you learn the plan for, say, Lead-Lined Combat Armor, you only learn that modification type. You will still need to learn the base Combat Armor plan before you can mod it with Lead Lined. I could be wrong here, but I believe that's how it works.
---
3. Weapons break with every landed shot. The cards do slow it down, and another perk allows repairing to 200% quality, so they become virtually indestructible.
---
4. Food - try and focus on soups for the first while. Razorgrain and Corn is abundant, and soup fills both hunger and thirst together. Makes sense early on to keep weights down.
---
5. Plan your build carefully. I found out the hard way that you can't be a Jack Of All Weapons here. Also, another mistake I made was not realising the level up process is two step - the type of card you pick has no bearing on the stat you increase. First, choose your stat, then choose whichever card you want. I'd been levelling STR and picking INT cards, then wondering why I had no INT points for faaaaaaar too long.
---
I’ll give that a shot!
---
I've had issues with SB bodies following me after I've killed them. Maybe this is the same?
---
both laser rifle and assault rifle need buff, wtf is wrong with assault rifle's dmg and ammo capacity
---
Yep bought the armor plan and read that in my pip boy already, not sure why it’s not showing up.  Definitely a learning curve here no doubt and enjoying the process.  Thanks for the advice.
---
I would suggest ps4 version but XB1 will do.
---
Yes get it asap. I really like this game.
---
I started on release day with about 8 friends. None of us had anything and neither did anyone else lol. So I never had that experience.
---
&gt;and it's also much harder to rip someone off irl and get away with it.
---
How easy it is to get away with doesn't change how morally right or wrong the behaviour is. Someone looting a shop when mass riots are going on isn't any better a person than someone robbing the same store at a quieter time.
---
Similarly, robbing a small local store with poor security measures in place doesn't make someone a better person that someone that robs a well guarded bank.
---
&gt; But it's also just a video game, none of it is real. 
---
I'm guessing what you're trying to get at is that because a computer game is not real, consequences of actions relating to it are less serious than for other aspects of real life. I.e. because assets in games aren't physically tangible, they're inherently worth less.
---
However, some people invest a lot of time and money into their virtual world. If they're scammed out of these by dishonesty, how is it any different to being scammed out of expensive real life sports/music/tech/whatever related hobby equipment?
---
I wish that it were true. Die less perhaps, but death comes for all builds eventually.
---
I think that was one of the scariest places in game when I started out..it has the best sounds to make u feel like you are in a horror movie.
---
Anyone know how long you can keep it there for?  
---
It's been 30 mins so far
---
which are considered "unlimited containers?"
---
I’ve enjoyed my time playing for sure.
---
Yep I think I have a decent grasp of the SPECIAL+cards process and definitely been eating a lot of soup, fuckin love soup.  Just gotta nail down the plans+mods process.  Ty!
---
Once saw a scorchbeast and behemoth duking it out, and a Mirelurk Queen running in to join the fight
---
Here is my stealth/Rifleman build.  You just swap out rifleman for commando.
---

You can dismantle weapons , armor or scrap (to reduce their weight) at any crafting station . Dismantling a weapon will unlock mods for that weapon. You can see how many mods you have unlocked for that weapon by selecting it in the modify section at the adequate crafting station . Same for armor , but only a smaller chance of unlocking mods from dismantle . Once mods are unlocked , you can apply them to armor/weapons in the modify tab of a crafting station .
---
For plans and recipes , they are located in the NOTES section in the pip boy . Simply click/press on the plan to learn it and you’ll be able to craft the item. If you get a plan that you already unlocked , it will be at the top of the notes section and say: (known)plan:name of plan instead of plan:name of plan so to unlock plans you have yet to learn , you need to scroll down to the letter P (alphabetical order) to unlock plans and R to unlock recipes (which work exactly like plans).
---
Hope that helps :)
---
Commando
---
Yeah but it must really suck for peeps that played it a lot before Wastelanders. I would be a bit angry too if I had such an experience.
---
But as far as I know soon new main story is coming up so perhaps it'll last longer for you long time veterans . Cheers
---
The Marine armor starts at level 35 (i believe) so you need to be level appropriate to craft it.
---
The RNG seems almost purposely perverse. If I want melee weapons, I get legendary rifle drops. If I want Vanguard armor, I get Unyielding. If I want Bloodied, it steers me back to Vanguard. Whatever I seem to want, the game seems to know and deliberately give me the opposite.
---
I got allied with both factions last night.  Davenport will be getting the pictures from now on.
---
lag with weapon wheel, freezing when opening map or pipboy, lag with stim button. all of these have been fucking me and its getting pretty frustrating.
---
My build isn't entirely optimized for stealth/sniper bc I run with shotgun, commando and archer perks as well. 
---
I also dont understand why people invest a lot of points in agility. I basically live in the Chinese stealth suit and that suits me just fine, pvp or pve.
---
This makes me wonder if maybe they are using some of the same code they used for the dragons in Skyrim, because they scorchbeast seem to do the same thing never land and their bodies follow you after death
---
Hey welcome to 76! Big fallout person here loved 3, NV, 4 and now 76 is my main game. 
---
Weapon condition perks like gunsmith are not used much in builds later on. Used mostly to mod guns since some mods can require different lvls of gunsmith to do. Weapon artisan perk rank 3 can be used when repairing ur weapons to boost them to 200% condition making the perks like gunsmith used really only to change mods on guns. Both these perks can be swapped out for different int perks like nerd rage if ur a low.hp build when you go to explore.
---
I had no idea you could use these outside a workbench lol. TIL thanks!
---
And please sell 2mm ammo for 1 cap. I'll buy them all
---
Or just make it a 1% skin drop for existing plasma guns?
---
Take few have weapons and go to any station - punt weapons inside. If all fits, its probably unlimited. I use two stations - Whitespring (sack near entry, blue suitcase opposite of stash box and brown suitcase in the trashcan on the other się of atation) or Pleasant Valley station (blue suitcase opposite the vendor robot).
---
yes man. the majority of my deaths are because im spamming the stimpack button but it's just not using them. so irritating.
---
they will never spoil; the same pies can be found in boston... 185 years later
---
Yeah, you only have a limited time to look through all the perks you can buy. It's pretty annoying.
---
Sorry, Nuclear Winter... it's their version of a battle royale, but it's more about survival than running around the map killing everyone else
---
Rubberbanding is common, with a lot of weapons, and it sucks.
---
Yeah coincidentally I just started doing that on my level ups. I'm at 2 star expert camando as of right now. I figure with the automatic I'll get a little more DMG output. Also I think with the longer I've been playing my my play style has changed from taking things slow to moving through things fast now that a little more comfortable with the dynamics.
---
congrats!  that pie -- a sweet delicacy that will survive a thousand trillion nukes before it ever expires
---
Useless legendaries sell really well for 100 caps per star for weapons and 50 caps per star for armor.
---
People buy them to get scripts
---
ESO isn't made by them. It's made by ZeniMax Online Studios.
---
It’s a shame the weapon displays never got more love. 
---
We need one specific for melee weapons
---
This post proves why duping is good.
---
why we don't have a "craft all" button is beyond me.
---
Vault 79 was not end game content, it was designed to be run by lower level players also who had recently joined the game on a free weekend period.
---
For the rest of us it was just some housekeeping chore to complete so as to get any rewards and to start the bullion and rep grind.
---
The grind in this game... that is the end game content!
---
Ah that answers that thanks!
---
I liked your kitchen and living room, but the rest is too cluttered and makes eyes hurt.
---
I've been in there hundreds and hundreds of times looking for the red uniform. So i've kinda got used to hearing the noises on the 3rd and 4th floor. This one time i was picking up all the crap lying around and i was like 'these noises are new!' and i turned round to leave the room and a glowing wendigo was stood in the doorway and when i say i nearly shit myself i am not exaggerating. I think a little bit popped out.
---
Whenever I'm max caps, i will travel to a low level player's camp in the server and drop a couple stacks just to make them a bit happier, and richer.
---
there is a difference with and without speed demon.   First, I had been in PA full time for a long time (overencumbered, so using excavator w/calibrated shocks)
---
I really didn't notice until one day I forgot to reequip starched genes2 and popped a radway; lost speed demon.  Took me a while to acquire another serum.
---
In the interim, the differnce was quite obvious.
---
subjectively, it also seems like the less weight you carry, the faster you move.
---
According to all known laws
---
of aviation
---
there is no way a bee
---
should be able to
---
Nice.
---
We've have a very similar build. I like when I'm teamed up though cause theres a charisma perk car I put on and share instead of tenderizing. I forget what the cards call bit it adds couple to positive mutation effects when on a team. Meaning I jump and mice with ridiculous speed amd hieght!
---
not trying to be a dick, but does anyone care about this? i get doing missions around photos, but otherwise, the camera is a complete gimmick. photomode is far superior when it comes to taking a nice shot.
---
You can easily trade those outfits for nice legendaries.
---
I play fo76 on my iPad! PS4 remote play ftw. You can even use your PS4 controller with it now via Bluetooth
---
hmmmmmmmmmm
---
I shall have to check this out
---
Very handy!
---
-
---
Even better, craft a Bloatfly Syringer and head into a Nuke Zone. Infinite Flies = Acid &amp; Stabilizing Materials galore!
---
I use the blue suitcase at train stations since they have no weight limit. Had a disconnect once when I was doing sum transferring,  but when I loaded back in everything was still there🤷‍♂️
---
They’ve been using the same engine since Morrowind, so...yeah. Scorchbeasts are literally dragons.
---
Not quite. Theres a huge difference in mass, shape, and inertia between shot and bullets. 
---
Bullets are designed to penetrate (or expand, depending in your preferred ammo) barrels are rifled to give the bullet spin, allowing it to keep its inertia over larger distances (as well as fly in a more straight line)
---
Shot (the individual projectiles that are shot by a shotgun) are small metal pellets (think BB's) that are spherical in shape. They aren't designed the way bullets are. The barrels in shotguns aren't designed to give the shot spin, so they lose their inertia much faster, and they have less mass than a bullet, meaning they are more susceptible to changes in inertia than a bullet is.
---
If you put those together you realize that a single pellet should not do as much damage as a bullet. That's why shotgun damages are essentially total damage / # of pellets (it works a bit different than that but that's the basic principle of it)
---
You still get Treasury notes from him. Also if your Charisma is high enough you can lie to him about the pictures and get rewards from him still.
---
Vanguard or unyielding
---
I actually made one of those for myself but haven't tried it yet. It will still be handy for sure since lots of times the zones that get nuked never seem to have any ore deposits in them.
---
Yeah that juke box playlist is TRASH. gimme some swing baby.
---
Fuck that assaultron.
---
Didn't glitch for me but was just a huge pain in the ass.
---
Wow, I'm kind of surprised I dont think I've met someone who dosen't like to you atleased Marsupial. Yo uh just not a fan?
---
Me and my bro crushed 95% of the game in under a week, really doesn’t take long
---
I lied all the time, lie only adds 40 caps. No plans etc.
---
Explosive weapons in general, grenade launchers, grenades, explosive arrows, and weapons with the legendary Explosive affix are all affected by demo expert
---
The last bit is the most important advice. A lot of people start playing after FO4 and really struggle with it. Learn to only take what you need as space is very limited.
---
Wholesome af 😤
---
Would you be willing to trade ur ME50 for caps? I just started back a couple weeks ago and dont have much as far as legendary weapons to trade as of yet.
---
a motel? that's brilliant. I had a tiny community center but I'm not sure it was obvious enough.
---
It's a website that you can use to determine the value of items in Fallout 76. Google it and you will find it.
---
Screws, ballistic fiber, ... people would love that.
---
I was referring to 76 with repeatable content. 800 hours in and I am not bored. I can’t say the same for fallout 4. I just don’t know what people expect from the game. I paid $60 18 months ago. I shouldn’t expect to have a lifetime of entertainment for free with weekly content updates. That’s unrealistic.
---
I went through it again with my friend and wasted that b**** in 6 shots lmao I got my revenge
---
How do you get the quantum
---
Digested Goo is quite soothing for the symptoms of IBS it seems to aid in smooth muscle relaxations, stops the spasms.
---
And it's fun to harvest, just beware of the radiation those pitcher plants burp!
---
Don't you fucking dare
---
I mean, basically yeah. Look at their flight patterns vs dragons. Even when they do that weird fart thing, it's the same as when a dragon would do a flyby breath attack.
---
Which one are considered "Utility Perks" are you referring to Rejuvenation etc?
---
Yeah a friend would have been nice but I was doing it solo.
---
So it was mostly:
---
Fire 2 shots
---
#*BEAM LASER!*
---
Die and run back to the room
---
Repeat
---
Jeah... Recently experienced it myself... "A Violent Night" popped up and i started. At first i was alone a pretty long time, then two other came and helped. The bar was full and the Wendigo appears. The two other where on the other end killing some Ghouls and i "Come here" emote, then I landed enough shots in to get loot...  
---
One of the two came, emptied a magazin into the Wendigo and killing it... After that he "heart" emote me. The other Player was angry and emptied a magazin on the dead Wendigo... I stood there like: What just happened :(
---
Gesture*
---
Yes, i made this mistake, too. If I were to share the gold it would actually give me more rep with both factions combined. Big oversight.
---
If the camp owner is present I buy something and poop it right back out into a bag then do a love emote.
---
My friend hid in the corner for the fight lol
---
I get what you mean though. Whenever you fight an assaultron, their head laser glows when they're charging it, and it gets brighter the closer it is to being fully charged. Even if they're invisible, you can still see the head laser.
---
Oh really! Thank you for the heads up on that! I've been trying to find something like that with no luck for some reason..
---
I have marsupial.. scroll down its in there..
---
I run Marsupial, Grounded and Eagle Eyes
---
Oh man ,I guess I'm the kind of guy who doesnt really have a strict objective playing this game you know what I mean ?
---
If you are ps4 I have some armor pieces with the damage while blocking on and would be happy to let you have one.
---
Please read our wiki page on this subject
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning)
---
That isn’t the game though. I chose to play this game because of the monetization methods and understand the trade offs. If there was a mandatory subscription I would never have started playing, let alone put 800 hours in. 
---
That’s the point, there are plenty of other games out there. If people are bored, play something else. If you are still having fun, keep on doing what you do. I personally don’t bother grinding legendaries or gold. That’s not fun to me. I find other things to do in the game. It’s a massive world, I don’t know why people limit themselves to specific grinds. No wonder they are bored.
---
Probably Hitler stuff, racism, anti (choose your minority group) tirade...
---
Same old same old 🤷‍♂️
---
Oh! And their love of Todd.
---
Agree interesting observation, wonder if it works every time or just a glitch
---
Yeah might have gotten lost, I check pleasant valley on occasion, including today.
---
you're best not knowing what i put in these sausages *friend*
---
Yes the cap and other rewards are low but you get Treasury notes from it.
---
Not entirely sure if that's supposed to be sassy, the reason i mentioned it is because i see a lot of people listing specific affixes and consumables, which in my experience I've never needed to get the job done :p
---
It's pretty fun at Events too. Try it out at Uranium Fever, funny as fuck seeing people running around confused.
---
I've not tested this yet, but if there's more than one player with the Syringer, you should get more than one Fly. *They're Multiplying!*
---
Okay thank you..
---
As a 39 year-old woman who plays Fallout with her husband on a regular basis, I'm so sick of hearing those kind of comments. A while back we actually bought a second PS4 just for that (we'd been wishing we could play together since the beta). We even started new characters together. Sometimes we team up with friends who live nearby, or take turns playing with our teenager (it's even fun 😱). Not all gamers are 15 year-old boys; in my experience this is ESPECIALLY true of the Fallout player base.
---
TLDR: go nuke yourself. ☢
---
If you have I think 8 charisma BEFORE you talk to Davenport to turn in the quest (after giving the pics to whoever) you can lie to him and say you were robbed and get some caps.
---
&gt; Where do you out those other points?
---
its a matter of perspective.. 
---
I run atypically high STR for non melee / non heavy so lets just say I put them into STR weight reduction..
---
personally I like to tell myself Ive used them to flesh out my Crit damage.. lol
---
That's because they dont let the trolls into the pts.
---
They should honestly just release another BETA system, but let players hack n cheat and do whatever they want in a locked server so they can find every flaw in the system.
---
I'm speaking beyond a single gimmick they're introducing. I'm speaking of the ancient, and **huge**, engine they're doing it on. The larger picture. The..  tapestry they're painting on, as it were.
---
Every time they touch something, twenty things break all over the game. Always a snowball they didn't catch internally. It gets into the wild. Then we have to deal with the fallout (heh) until they chase it down. This isn't unique to FO76.  
---
But unlike Morrowind, Oblivion, FO3+, Skyrim and FO4, players can't release unofficial patches to fix everything they miss or chose to not address. We *have* to rely on them to do it.
---
Let them take their time.
---
Something like:
---
1. Right, I haven't played in a while, forgot about these baddies.  Why did I hate them again? Oh...  **BEAM LASER**
---
2.  Right, was supposed to shoot the legs....**BEAM LASER**
---
3. Got the legs now I should be fi...**BEAM LASER**
---
4. Okay, legs down, hide around this corner when it's charging, I should be good now, *peek*, **BEAM LASER**
---
5. Listen here you little shit I'm throwing grenades from the other room now.
---
I had a similar dungeon idea myself. We know that Taggerty's group went into Glassed Caverns and detonated a load of bombs to cave it in so it's fair to say that area is way bigger than what we've seen and the labs mentioned on the holotape aren't necessarily the ones you go through. It could be huge down there and a great dungeon opportunity.
---
Ah yeah, now I see. I actually kind of like your build. You have alot of luck. That helps with VATS correct? Also does your luck have anything to do with the drop rate of quality items?
---
&gt; you should get more than one Fly
---
Hahah that sounds incredible. I'm going to have to craft one for my buddy now and try this sometime.
---
I envy you
---
Monster mash if you do not take the candy bowl and if you are alone you cane legendary farm. The most I have had was 8 and the least I had was 3 per event.
---
(Kills SB, Drinks Nukashine, blacks out, wakes up in ye olde wooden prisoner wagon)
---
I’ve gotta respectfully disagree. I can follow those sounds straight to the guy. Maybe I’m totally wrong and just get lucky every time, making me think it’s awesomely well done with the sound, but I’m pretty sure I am following the sounds.
---
Because I hate him and I should have killed him while I had the chance
---
You can wake up now
---
They were ignoring you, sad, I'd have left you all kinds of tasty morsels.
---
Generally? I sell all my ammo's at 1 cap. Fusion cores can be tricky due to the different charge levels; but generally 1 cap per 1 percent charge works well enough (33% core; 33 caps ext)  
---
Frames... they're so common I doubt anyone will buy them; you find them all over the joint with and without armor already on them.  
---
Chems and the like sell quite well, especially stimpacks, radaway. Generally I sell those for half what it says they're worth.  
---
Also as someone mentioned; Scrap can sell very well once you get going. Alot of players need steel, lead, adhesive. So where possible; stick that in your vendor if you have it going spare.  
---
I regularly charge 2 cap per steel, lead, 5 for adhesive.. vendor usually sells out in minutes.
---
very cool, but that it?
---
The middle of Tanagra Town is also great for this trick.
---
that’s it? no approximation for update 20?
---
I do ok with vats yeah.. Ive also got a similar commando build.. 
---
when my sneak breaks I rely on crits and Furious weaponry 
---
drops are RNG luck doesnt matter..
---
Been dancing all day mate, no dice unfortunately. Didn’t realise people were so law abiding. I appreciate the sentiment though.
---
No, he meant Jes2r
---
Yes, ever since wastelanders came out and i seitched to steam instead of the bethesda launcher ive had that problem
---
Yes! MFA!
---
Sorry I meant "Put the other Points" I'm starting to get tired. I don't type very well when that happens. Lol is the Crit thing true or is it just one of them Santa claus story's we tell our kids to make them have hope 🤤🤤
---
I remember those times, the good ol days..lol. Miss the feeling that induced. Poor ol critter is just another piece of cannon fodder now.
---
Mostly everything is open, like a highway rest stop with full amenities. I keep one locked purifier off to the side, just for me.
---
Why would anyone play like it's zero-sum? It isn't like we're going to run out of tin cans and corn, everything respawns including you and me.
---
I cant even tell if you're joking. It wouldnt surprise me.
---
I just wish the quest was longer and more epic feeling.
---
Noted thanks
---
I'd think that was a base texture bit map of the SB ultrasound attack, it was spinning like smoke textures do,  but hadn't processed fully. Many effects in the game are I think bit maps that are rotated and run through an animation, often see them not running correctly.
---
that confusion is just the radiation.. you'll get use to it
---
Oh thank god, not masses of Harambe and sirens at my camp for public teams.
---
100% agree.  I went from Melee, to shotguns now to stealth Rifleman as I better understood the game.  
---
You can't swap mods like that anymore. You can only apply them which means you lose the one you're replacing. 
---
Light marine armor is a mod for marine armor, you know how to mod the armor BUT you haven't learned to craft the armor yet. Most mods, weapons and armor plans can be learned or earned, but some plans have to be bought and others you can only buy the mods. Enclave armor comes to mind on the last one. 
---
Unfortunately leveling up doesn't decrease weapon degradation. Only gunsmith/makeshift/pipe rifle crafting perks will reduce weapon degradation, the only other factor is weapon artisan and fix it good allowing you to repair weapons and armor respectively to 200%. Some higher end weapons break faster even. 
---
Much more than eating and sleeping has been expanded upon from 4 survival. There's a ton of diseases along with challenges for contracting them. At least not sleeping doesn't give you insomnia and being overencumberd doesn't break you legs. However BGS is going to remove the NEED to eat and drink soon but keep the benefits. 
---
Yes, the limited amount of special points can mean you build could go off the rails and you end up in a bad place. You can swap points around after level 50 but only one point per level. Go to nukes and dragons and familiarize yourself with the cards at least. Swapping cards around will het old but at least we'll have card load outs eventually. 
---
Mutations are cool but come with a negative attribute as well. Also rad products effect them, rad x suppresses them and rad away will remove them. Get starched genes cards to keep them and class freak to mitigate the penalties of having them. 
---
So you can get up to 3 legendary attributes on a single weapon, wait until you get a bloodied explosive shotgun! There's a lot less legendary effects than in 4, gone are incendiary (except for one specific weapon) or cryogenic as well as many others. Two shot isn't that good anymore unfortunately. 
---
Legendary fixers only drop if you know the plan. Only a few weapons are like this. Either plan on purchasing one from a player ( for a lot of caps) or sitting on the encryptid event (and dying a lot) for the plans.
---
Stash space is minimal. You'll have to unlearn your hoarding ways. Keep only what is necessary or hard to cone by. 
---
Get the small backpack plan on Morgantown airport terminal, get the free personal terminal in the atom shop and find the suspicious person it mentions. That'll give you the camera you'll need to get the real backpack from the scout quest you'll start north of the Grafton dam.
---
Welp, I'm also on PS4, and at my camp I have a load that go for the same amount regardless - ten for camp items, twenty for weapons and armor - so if you see "Blokeh's Camp" on the map just east of the centre, stop by and stock up. 👍🏻
---
I fuck shit up yo.. 
---
with gunfu/adrenaline bonuses, headshots and crits.. I dont sweat breaking sneak
---
-eta: that said... It would take me a long ass time to put down a SBQ solo.. but how often does that really come up for most players?
---
I really want to play this game in 3rd person so I can see my characters outfit etc, but I've just gone stealth and can't look down sights cos I can't see my gun, so forced to play 3rd person in certain circumstances. It's terrible. Camera bounces all over the place. Maybe I'm just used to the first person view now.
---
Anything that doesn't influence you in combat situation.
---
Im Asubix jajaja...thats my main, and im on pc, but dont worry, i will see how to make that weapon work...i will broke the thing if i have too hahaha
---
Yeah, might be - though my last SB kill has been some time ago, seems they can get pretty attached to you ;)
---
Definitely. Lemme know if it works! I always wanted to test it in that wee Raider Arena up beside Top of the World, with the PA in the middle.
---
Just keeping tagging with the Syringer then use a Tesla to kill them all at once.
---
Boring.
---
you definitely nailed it. the character locked weapons and rolling with modules is definitely what they want going forward.
---
Sounds interesting, someone said recently that they had this when they nuked Harpers Ferry so it's possible it works on all ore deposits. Will have to launch a few nukes tonight and test it.
---
Good find mate. In my experience high radiation fluids drop about 2-2.5 times less frequently than the masses.
---
it's a shopping cart full of tin cans and tbh they're welcome to them
---
I love watching these fights. A particular good one was sheepsquatch versus glowing deathclaw and glowing hermit crab. I thought it would be a fairly balanced fight but sheepy just wrecked them.
---
I'm still thinking 6/30 or 7/7.  No later, that would really piss people off, especially with the event and perks most likely being missing on content launch.
---
Lol everyone likes the good Ol' Fuck Shit Up Yo Mode 🤤. Very nice though. What system are you on? If your on XBone I'd be down to run with you sometime if you are.
---
I wish she is screaming cause of other reason 😉
---
They spawn at the cranberry bog primal cuts, though they do not give shrimp sadly.
---
🐝 👼
---
I just love Bears, its' a weakness, don't really like killing the Yogis where it not for the sweet acid.
---
Yeah.. but they are giant shrimp!
---
Both
---
I’m glad they’re finally updated it so you can’t get dragged into pvp by your team. Would have been nice to see some kind of update on when we can expect patch 20.
---
No info on update 20 date...ugh.
---
One of my favorite creature designs, absolutely brilliant.
---
Trading posts, including price checks, are not allowed on /r/fo76. There are other trading/price checking subreddits and websites available - please make use of those. 
---
If your post is not about making a trade, please [message the subreddit moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/fo76) and they'll take a look at your post for you.
---
Yeah, just a dry pit of content at the moment. Treasury notes and dailies if you haven’t hit max rep are all me and my mates hop on for, then over to an intense game. We can still dream.
---
sry man PC
---
Im too old to relearn how to play a FPS with a controler.. lol
---
Those poor queens start off so well until they get crop dusted and join the scorched club.
---
Yeah I would hope they’re wanting to push out the season as soon as possible since everything else was delayed
---
I sell all ammo for one cap, even 2mm and plasma cartridges.  I do not sell missiles, nukes, or grenades.  I sell .44 and .38 for zero caps, fusion and plasma cores for 50 caps.
---
All ultra common recipes and plans I sell for 0 caps.  I mean things like soot tower tea and workbench plans.  I generally charge 25 caps or less for common plans.  Useful plans like deep pocketed mods etc I sell for around 50 caps.
---
I don’t sell chems because they take up too much room in the stash box.  I am a low priced vendor because I want the stuff out of my stash.  I don’t sell any scrip legendaries.
---
Useful legendaries I sell cheaply as well.  Like a vanguards combat chest with plus strength I would sell for 300-500 caps.  An Actually good legendaries I keep for trade and do not sell in my machine.  
---
Eventually you will be managing your caps because of the limit and you will start running out of things to buy.  You will want to come up with a method to close access to your machines so that you can turn them off when you hit max caps; Like a garage door or locked room
---
Yep xbox here as well. First noticed this as soon as wastelanders came out. It was happening constantly, now only during fights or high-fps situations. Still incredibly annoying.
---
I meant no other rewards. Only 40 caps and notes. Nothing else.
---
Mine happened after wastelanders came out, thought it was an issue they would eventually know about and fix.
---
The option has been always there.
---
I was kinda just being snarky.. 
---
do what you like.. I just cant play a FPS without KB/Mouse.. it feels like I am crippled
---
They're definitely pretty neat. I always hate getting hanged up on by em lol.
---
While the chinese stealth suit is very good, you still have action boy/girl, adrenaline, gun fu, dodgy, thru hiker etc, plenty of decent perks for a high agility build without the stealth skills to be fair.
---
And slap that notification bell.
---
Probably the dumbest question on this post, but can I ask what this Davenport Photo Op thing is. Is this a event or something. I really enjoy using the camera in this game and would really enjoy participating in photo competition or what ever they if they exist.
---
his luck must be at 15
---
Didn't they say you can get atoms through the season stuff? They're just changing how you get them I think
---
Public Teams seem cooler than I expected, nice.
---
it started with wastelanders for me too.
---
Great now I'm imagining the keyboard cat meme but with the scorchbeast.
---
I unfortunately dont have a single friend that plays this game hah.
---
Is it just me, or are the team bonuses super lackluster except the event one? I'd want to pick event even if I was doing something else because it has the most benefit. Stat bonuses are junk, and getting more XP just for legendary kills is pitiful (better to take the builder one for hunting since 4 INT gives XP bonus for all sources.) They really need to up these bonuses to make them compelling.
---
Before that i hadnt had an issue, now its a 2-5 second lag spike where i drop to 0 fps everytime i change weapon via the wheel
---
You should put some focus on your character build. Decide on a fighting strat that suits your play style, and collect weapons/armor to compliment that.
---
Personally, I play as a stealth/sniper with a focus on Semi-Auto Rifles and Bows. I live in the chinese stealth armor, and I can usually tear down normal enemies pretty fast. (The only reason the assaultron got me the first time was bc of her glitched head laser)
---
But the more you build your character, and practice your play style, the easier the game will be. It's a hard transition from FO4 or Skyrim where you can literally just do whatever and be fine
---
Same frustration with smoke machines. Every time I login I have to turn it on manually.
---
damn, that would be terrible
---
Yes exactly!
---
its time for another MEAT Week
---
Im torn between "glad im not the only one" and "sorry you also have to deal with this"
---
I never realized how much I wanted a mod until just now.
---
Do you think they could remake the skyrim intro purely using Fallout resources, like a fallout themed skyrim intro?
---
Maybe it's just the different consoles. I'm on Xbox. 
---
I'd say at least 80% of the time the sound does not lead directly towards the officer. Around half the time, the sound is inverted - it's loudest at the edge of the radius and softer as you approach the officer. The rest of the time the sound leads to a spot where the officer isn't. 
---
If you're in an open field or can spot the officer easily, it's not a big deal. But in a forest or a crowded area it can become a problem.
---
Lol, that's okay man honestly I really wish I have a nice PC to game on over the console any day. I'm planning on making the switch one day when I can afford to build a decent tower.
---
How does this work? Don’t you get dropped in a different instance if you leave to the main menu to switch characters?
---
Been waiting for this for so long!!!
---
They are probably more focused on starfield at the moment.
---
some world containers say 0/20 when you go to the transfer menu. some suitcases and ice coolers and such say 0/0
---
Sounds like you picked the wrong one.
---
Wack. Zombie SB's.
---
Like a fuccin strangler sb but more dead.
---
Ngl I kinda want the PvP drag in to stay for Private teams and only remove it for Public teams.
---
You lost me at rose is one of the best robos in fallout. Raider punk is a much better option.
---
Today's reddit post sponsored by raid shadow legends
---
I'm sure everything about the game is better playing on PC.
---
Fair enough, but I don't think that this game as is will have long term success without a better stream of content and more lasting repeatable content to retain players.  
---
As you pointed out, it takes money to create content and I have no idea how much the 1st subs and atom shop are able to fund it.  If the product is going to be on the mediocre side because it is "free" then that is a failure to me.
---
I was trying to show a teammate a 3 star bloodied 10mm smg. I found back when the trade thing wouldnt work at all. So we had been dropping stuff to each other. As soon as I dropped item, server kicked us both off..needless to say, no more bloodied 10mm. Also.lost 3 star furious lmg doing the mule thing...that one I still havent figured out why. (Maybe I overloaded capacity of container- not sure. I still do the mule thing but more careful with it.)
---
Naw... just been married for 20yrs lol. We didn’t play video games when we met back then.
---
Finally you can join teams freely and not have to worry about stashing your junk immediately. Goodbye to the last remaining vestiges of pvp, you shall not be missed.
---
haha thank goodness!
---
You can't tame a mirelurk queen can you?
---
And it's a bullshit idea, quelle surprise.
---
Yeah it puckered my bhole 4 sure🤣
---
I've made the same comment a few times on the PTS forums, and also suggested a few different team types, but at the moment they haven't acknowleged any of it.
---
Awww my husband does this when he sees I’m struggling with a scorchbeast. For years I was all “I don’t want to be that couple with two consoles and two screens” and now I’m glad we did it so we can team up and play together.
---
Or make it so the legendary enclave weapons themselves are a drop from the event so people continue to play it. Add the president guass rifle to that loot pool too.
---
I've always liked the Minigun. There is just something about prancing around with a massive hunk of metal as big as I am, vomiting lead death in front of me that I find endlessly amusing.
---
in adventure mode yes, in private worlds I believe you have 5-10~ mins before it switches over.
---
Ok so yeah Rejuvenation, slow metabolism &amp; what not would definitely be considered utility. What do recommend using instead?
---
'i miss my mum...' 
---
she died

Maybe I'm just lucky then. I've been with my partner for almost 10 years and shed she'd prefer I play video games so she can play animal crossing and watch youtube/netflix.

Public Team: Building – Bonus: +1 Intelligence (+4 for a fully bonded team)

Also known as the general XP boost team..
---
We would've eaten more Donuts if they weren't so extremely expensive to craft..
---
That many masks, makes me question the rarity.. But then I have probably have 8 million masks in storage.
---
I posted a build in my original reply
---
Really though, I feel like the majority of weapons need an overhaul. Sure, a *Rolling Pin* doesn't need to be as viable as an *Ultracite Gatling Laser*, but there's so many weapons that are complete garbage, even with legendary modifiers. Then there's the other part with many not having mods.
---
I mean, I guess, though I only use thru hiker and action boy. The whole point of my build is to not be seen, so if an enemy does notice me I've done something horribly wrong lmao. Those perks are nice, but I haven't messed around with them yet, they're not really my thing lol.
---
Everyone has different opinions. That’s fine. I don’t consider the game mediocre. There are things I don’t like, the world is just massive so I find other things to do. Personally I’m pretty skeptical of the seasons though. That’s not the type of “content” that I want them investing in. That feels more like a mobile game or F2P tactic. At least they are free...
---
I imagined that people choosing the builder public team would do so to build. Either at a team mates camp or to get help building their own camp. How weird that you can’t build for others on your team in a building team...
---
I think if it was something you could toggle like pacifist mode that it would be a good compromise. This could make team pvp a little more difficult
---
The best part of this ITV is the MFA.
---
That's it.
---
I like that there are three usually then that single glowing one loitering with intent somewhere in the area.
---
That’s the whole idea. Give us reasons to do some of the less popular events and activities. Idk why they seem so resistant to these things
---
With high agility you also have that added benefit of being hard to detect when you aren’t in a stealth suit, especially when sneak perks and armour benefits are added into the equation. I only use my stealth suit for nuke zones usually, sometimes for silo runs as well.
---
I'll look through it again for sure than. Thank you for the information I really appreciate it. The one guy can suck it for saying I was stupid to make that post on reddit. You and the rest of the community have been just as helpful as any dumb youtube videos.
---
As a fan of Hank Scorpio, the Flamer. Still looking for a good roll, but it'll happen eventually.
---
Can we get a "mutations" team category?
---
For anyone who wants to team up with other players that are mutated for the strange in numbers perk?
---
Oh crackle
---
Whose servers are located in Oceania and call only be accessed via Nord VPN.
---
I think the 3% of all nukes dropped were dropped on Helvetia is hilarious considering the number of people complaining about it throughout the event. And it was barely a thing that happened.
---
Yup. The LMG has literally had 1 mod since launch... we can’t get a larger drum? Red dot? Suppressor or long barrel? This game has needed weapon tuning forever I’m just convinced they only care about content &amp; not about the quality of what we’re playing. I don’t want more bullshit events I want to use a plasma &amp; laser rifle in a non-joking manor. Only viable lasers are explosive &amp; only viable plasma gun is the Flamer barrel rifle the regular rifle is severely underpowered
---
Not being able to be dragged into PvP will be nice, and having MFA is great, but, besides that... meh? I'm still hoping update 20 will be either 6/30 or 7/7, but that's only two or three weeks - I'd think they'd be able to say *something* if it were that close...
---
And the Public Teams? Those bonuses aren't really enticing - bonus XP for events could be nice, but the rest feel like they'll be so minor you'll barely even notice having them. I'm not keen on people being able to just join uninvited, either... I think I would've preferred if they'd just improved the base Teams system a bit, like allowing XP for kills to be shared as if you "tagged" enemies so long as you're within a reasonable distance. (This has been one of my main complaints since the BETA - co-op would flow much more naturally if we didn't have to constantly be worrying about keeping track of who tagged what.)
---
Lol daaamn. My kigercounter is off the hook right meow!🤢🤮🤤
---
Every heavy guns
---
Nahhhh
---
Yeah, they just kinda slapped FO4's modding system in here but haven't done much to build on it.
---
...Yeah, I was level 80-something when I did it and have the same build you do.
---
[Assaultrons are just annoying](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/search?q=assaultron&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)

Everyone likes to pretend they knew what they were doing when they first started out. I was nearly level 100 before I realized my build needed work.
---
*Hitler in the bunker scene*: ...one wasteland will fix that...
---
I appreciate the input. I really enjoy playing this game it just gets a little overwhelming trying to keep up and learn everything glad to know we all get the struggle there.
---
This is me and my wife she was hesitant at first but now I cant get her off hahahah
---
Edit: No that was not a bad pun
---
I like it too. 50 cal is probably right in the middle of dps and crafting ammo cost. Lmg can be magic so probably lmg.
---
Weren’t we soppsed to get a new trailer today too? I coulda sworn I read that somewhere.
---
I ment you get 3 extra script per faction. 6 total extra.
---
I have all those things and I do notice more damage after I eat some Blight Soup, no idea if that is what you mean?
---
The whole time reading about Public Teams I was concerned about public teammates being able to ruin/deface our camps, but Bethesda appears to have thought ahead on this one, leaving CAMPS and containers private. 
---
Well done!
---
Yes, about damn time.
---
The game makes it really obvious in *almost* all cases with prompts warning you that you can end up in pvp if you do something or warning you that a player attacked you or you attacked them, or warning you by making the other player name red to indicate they're hostile and can damage you or your camp. I fired up three accounts on two PC's last night to test all the pvp rules with myself on a private server just to see what the current state of the pvp rules are and it heavily protects camps from damage. The only way I could damage a camp without the camp owner being at the camp was for one of their teammates to be at the camp and to reciprocate an attack with me at the camp location. If I was in pvp with them somewhere else it hid the vendor marker for all the camps on their team and if I walked to their camp anyway the game would cancel the hostile state before I got there and I couldn't damage their camp. The only thing I forgot to try was if I was in pvp with someone and my teammate was at their camp if they could damage it, I think they probably could. Also there's two ways to get into pvp with pacifist on, and that's to be in a workshop circle during a capture or claim or have a teammate be in one. If you're there you're hostile to anyone else there automatically and can be killed whether you returned fire or not, and I also assume that hostile state applies to your camp and teammates too. Also, most people don't understand what the "seek revenge" and "ignore" buttons mean on the death screen. Ignore means you add the player who killed you to the block for session list, it hides you on each others maps, and you can respawn wherever you want to avoid them, and when you respawn you are both non hostile to each other if you do happen to meet up you'd have to reciprocate pvp again to damage each other. Respawn does the same thing except doesn't add them to the block list. Seek Revenge respawns you at a nearby location but retains the hostile state. If they're damaging your camp they can keep damaging it while you're respawning, and if you seek revenge they can keep damaging it while you run back to the fight.
---
TLDR; if someone doesn't want camp damage, run pacifist and don't go into workshop areas and don't have teammates that do either.
---
Someone should really make a sticky post about the pvp rules here so everyone can get a grasp on them.
---
Well that's a fat f my guy.
---
Bloodied Gatling Gun. Faster spin up than a Minigun, and with better per-bullet base damage. I often used it as much in single shot sniper mode than full on auto. And of course if they do hit me then I simply hit back even harder! 
---
Close second is my Explosive 50cal. All the giddiness of the instant firing big bullets with the added bonus of anti-mob splash.
---
And taking bronze is the Anti-armour Fast Firing 50 cal. Ideal for urban wafare where spin up is a massive disadvantage, and with no splash damage there's no suicide radius to worry about indoors.
---
I dont really use them.. but Im thinking .50cal also
---
maybe because its the least heavylike heavy?
---
Definitely have this.  Game needs to load in the weapon.  Can't wait to play this on XSX later this year.  Playing on PC is great, but KBM sucks.  Miss my rumble and trigger pull.
---
Another vote for the .50 cal from me.  I changed my character build around level 170 from a Gauss/Shotgun runner to a PA heavy gunner, and it's been oh so much fun mowing everything down.
---
This so much this the micromanagement is just annoying but no end game is making me want to stop playing
---
I've transferred loads of equipment between characters and don't even bother to use preexisting containers.  Dozens of times at least.  Zero problems.
---
I know a server can crash, but are there any other actual things that can go wrong?
---
There seems to be superstition about only using world containers instead of dropping, is that based on anything other than hearsay?
---
Bruh I basically live in my stealth suit lmao
---
Speculation for later today.  IGN showcase etc.
---
On the forum people have been suggesting others to add like a 'Scavenger' one that has a chance to give double the junk item you pick up in the world. (So no lootbags or containers.) Higher chance with more people.
---
My mom
---
Oooooooooooooh
---
Kidding. Fr though, its gotta be the .50
---
Ah thank u. I’ll make sure to look out for it.
---
Or, heres a thought, use a non legendary gun for tagging like the aforementioned Tesla because you dont need to have bloodied in the name of everything to play a bori- err, bloodied build.
---
Happy Cake Day\~
---
But it is tradition to leave a roof toilet.. :(
---
I dunno if I would build it that way.. but for ME?
---
probably the full health build..
---
Exactly, there's a clear lack in sense of progresion. At leat in New Vegas you had the regular Sniper Rifle and then you got the  Anti-Materiel Rifle.  
---
Even with the shotguns in NV, we had so many different types. In here we have 3, classic, pump action and the combat one. Yeah mods gives you some flexibility but is not the same. At least a pipe shotgun should be there for early players
---
They do this on purpose as another insensitive for fo1st I do it in my private world all the time and never had a problem
---
My faves are the ult gat laser and the flamer
---
&gt;Over time, we’ve received lots of requests from the Fallout 76 community for quality-of-life improvements when it comes to finding other players and forming teams.
---
Yeah so how about text chat, just adding some broad or vague categories to your group doesn't help when you can't even communicate with anyone.
---
I just wanted to extend my gratitude to everyone who participated in this discussion. It was brought to my attention that my choice of a title may have been a little "Click Baiting" I honestly don't think about those kind of things when I'm trying to creatively write a discussion so I apologize if anyone felt that way. In all seriousness though it has been very reassuring to know that there is such a strong and helpful community for this game and everyone who has contributed to this discussion has help me want to keep up the grind. Y'all can give your self a big ol fat sweet roll for such a good job 🤤
---
If your on xbox I'm always lookin to help out gives me something to do I made my own end game as a bodyguard for hire (dont ask much just what people can spare)
---
AFAIK, it's the same as it's always been. 50% increase of base damage and a guaranteed hit. I've never noticed a damage issue, but hits don't always land. 
---
What test results do you get?
---
I agree with this post, as somebody that started a rifleman, drifted sniper, spent time with sneak commando and is now moving points over to be a heavy. Of it all, heavy is the most fun to me. 
---
But I have a million ways to mod hunting rifles, combat rifles and handmades. I have nothing for my .50 cal. and all I am using is the Final Word you get from the Beckett quest, as I am new to Heavy and haven't collected other weapons yet. 
---
To me, it highlights the overall inequity in this game. the entire thing is simply grossly out of balance. 
---
Bloodied is the build to have. why? because not only is it the best damage modifier, but you have multiple other perks that support it, multiple perks that give low health bonuses. 
---
Beserker, on the other hand, really has nothing to support it. Like, you can still you dodgy or whatever, but nothing to choose from a perk perspective that specifically support low DR builds and gives bonuses. The prefix also give less damage than bloodied. 
---
There is no high health damage bonus either, no Vanguards for weapons, which I think would be cool (ahem, your sniper build, for sure) particularly given how very easy it is to pick up some rads. 
---
There is a huge amount of effort and options put into rifles in this game. There is little to nothing for heavy weapons. 
---
Explosive weapons are basically unusable
---
Energy weapons are a mess, and all over the map. 
---
Down the board the game lacks synergy and equitable distribution of how you can mod, and how you can use perks to support a style of play. The game shoehorns you into one of a select few ways of playing, which isn't great in an open ended MMO-lite game.
---
Ah it was like that? Well there was sitings of a level 3000 running around since the bobbleheads can be stacked, so he'll be able to get them all.
---
thats a good question. im still new to this, but my apprehension for using my paper bag would be that sometimes theyve had issues with spawning through the ground and what not during regular game play. my assumption would be a world item would be more stable, but maybe im the ass for assuming.
---
Personally, I'm glad for it. 
---
Right now, I only party-up with people I know. I don't join random teams, a little bit out of fear of someone ruining or defacing my camp. I've seen people complain about teammates building hate-speech in their camp then getting reported for it. No thanks.
---
im on pc, but i appreciate the offer!

wake up in the bed of a burned out Pick-R-Up, bein pulled by brahmin
---
Done
---
You used to be able to stack overdrive with pychotats, it doesn't work now.
---
These ITV are getting more and more bleh as time goes on. There is no sense of  "we are aiming to drop this patch for the first  week of July" or that sort of thing. Everything feels like a dry pile of leaves.
---
FO76 is such a good couples game.
---
My Fiancée's big time into the 50s vibe and PvE shooters. Naturally she clicked with it when we got 2 copies.
---
Only thing is she has no clue how the legendary system works, or guncrafting. So I sort her guns and perks. She revives me every 30 secs in combat.
---
Ouch lol
---
I don't see why people would come back for an experience bonus honestly.
---
We've been asking for more end-game content for groups for fucking ever and instead of adding more they take it away.  People always say oh the game will die lose momentum etc. and yet more people still pick it up and subscribe to first and the atom shop.  Not hating on these people by any means this is good but we just have to accept that end-game players are 2nd class citizens in MORPG games behind the never-ending horde of casuals who just want to build a camp and walk around and pick flowers.  Again, not saying there's anything wrong with that but just pointing out that the causal majority will always be super-served at the expense of the hardcore end-game players.  Sucks but it is what it is.
---
sssssshhhh, stop giving away the secret about the stealth armor before Bethesda nerf hammers it into the ground
---
Yep. Some of the most fun ive had in f76 ive had being wanted
---
I usually drop stimpacks for players with sick camps
---
Speaking of nord ya know what every hairy guy or girl needs, dollar shave club for all his or her shaving needs and necessities!
---
Hacked weapons are the ones that have a mini nuke barrel attached to a minigun. Or a beam splitter explosive pipe rifle. Those are just 2 examples of hacked weaponry (attachments that don't fit the weapon). As for the BE Plasma Gatling, it's a legit legacy weapon.
---
Sounds like a damn siren head game
---
Haha yep that's exactly what I'm going through right now too. It's like fallout 76s version of a mid life crisis.
---
Never showed for me! I could hear it talking but it never appeared.
---
it is a hard choice between my explosive 50 cal, furious Gauss Gatling gun, 2 shot explosive LMG, explosive harpoon gun, or my Anti-Armor explosive Gatling gun. all fun to use and very deadly
---
It has a more realistic look in the lens. The 105 looks like a kids toy down the lens.
---
I think they already knew what it was capable of before thinking it was a good idea to put in the game. 3.5x damage and invincibility at the cost of moving slower, unless the mobs bump into me, I’m a Starcraft ghost!
---
I believe the "One Wasteland" is going to change a lot when it comes to the lasers. I almost cringe at the negative thoughts I have on what will happen to my legacy collection.
---
If there were a game mechanic for it, I would romance my BE gatling.
---
I think it’s available as a daily quest only after the wastelander quest line. He is in &gt;!the overseer’s home!&lt;
---
Believe me you will eventually hate this quest. But definitely do it because it’s easy, just over repetitive.
---
I think that the game is mediocre when you get to the end game and that is being kind of generous.  Otherwise I've enjoyed my time playing.  I've put over 1000 hours in now since beta.  It isn't like I haven't gotten my money's worth.  I'm just concerned about the future as it is a growing online game.
---
I agree with what you're saying with the mobile game/F2P aspect and that is what I am worried about.  I went into this wanting a AAA title online game with big plans for expansions, etc.  If all DLC is free then I don't know how we can expect much more than F2P type of content.  Maybe the direction we're headed just isn't for me.
---
I honestly don't even have a problem with the seasons.  It just isn't enough if I understand correctly and it is just more cosmetics and camp items to grind for by doing the same things we always do.
---
Where can you find the artillery plan?
---
PTS is stuff that’s there primarily for bug testing. A UI change would require them to delay the feature
---
I gave a friend a t51 nuka set. He dropped it in his trap General Akbars Hotel and some guy came running in all watering at the mouth xD
---
Some good way to look at things in positive way at 3 in the morning. Salut.
---
I wasn't aware that was something that happened.  Have you experienced it yourself?
---
You're not in love unless you're saving your SO from a walking, spitting foreskin
---
Honestly I just get tired of flat % increases or stat increases. I really wish shit was more interesting. Like for the exploration bonus it could be something like "if everyone on your team is sprinting, sprinting no longer costs AP" instead of just an endurance increase. Helps you run to locations faster. Just something like that instead of +X%
---
Never said they would or should just because of double XP. What I said is a weekly rotation of events with xp/sale events on weekends as an addition. Some people have alts, some are prefarming levels for Legendary Perks update. Even if those are not reason enough, it's better than nothing.
---
So first the cult, then the apocalypse... dammit bethesda had it backwards... or hmmm (rereads cult lore)
---
I think that would be great. I also think if they let us mod the mistress of mysteries gear and where the garb over armor that would give those items longevity. I enjoy so many of the side stories in the game it is a shame to make the items worthless in the end game. So much potential to make them better.
---
When is meat week?
---
What team types did you suggest?
---
 Unarmed should be in your face!  No need to sneak, if you do feel the need to sneak around grab the Chinese stealth suit. 
---
Day to day nothing should be able to kill you If you are unarmed and have decent Armour and weapons .. you should be 1 punch guy
---
That's a fair point. Surely Beth realises by now there's enough players wandering the Wasteland with high tier legendary items and need to do something to add a challenge for these players IMHO.
---
I could see how it would be challenging for lower level players or players without decent legendary rolls but the whole raid feels like a missed opportunity to me. Especially as the raid itself is instanced so could surely provide more of a challenge for those players who have optimised their build.
---
Hacked weapons aren’t limited to just mods btw. 
---
Non-Modded hacked BE90 Cryolators are out there. Cryolators are lvl45 max, most of the ones I see are lvl50. 
---
This is just the best example I can share, because I have been searching for a non hacked BE90 Cryolator for a while.
---
interesting. i guess ill have to pick it up and check it out. at least from the base camera, i really couldn't tell the difference (at least not a positive difference) between those shots and photo mode, so i appreciate the clarification
---
im tired of these useless ITVs
---
Somebody copy pasta this.
---
There's a spot in the Savage Divide that is an obvious callback to the Skyrim intro. The hillside is just about identical and so is the cart, only it's being pulled by a tractor.
---
**Converted Munitions Factory**
---
* Take-over the workshop
---
* Build a munitions converter
---
* Specify the type of munition you want.
---
* Drop your excess ammo you want converted along with other required materials. 
---
* Fight the world enemies and/or other players trying to get your converted munitions.
---
Yeah I’ve heard stories on here about that happening too and totally understand the hesitation. But as someone who enjoys helping others build or improve their camps, it’s just weird to me that there even is a building team when you can’t build. I know the workaround is just adding them to a private team and building for them that way, but why even make “building” a public team option?
---
I would love a "Salty" team to make food last longer :P
---
Bloodied would be better because with endurance theres a perk where when you hp bar is full of rads it can grant up to +5 strength, which will add more melee damage. Also need rage adds a lot of damage bonuses and resistances. I also think serendipity doesnt work until your below 30% hp aswell.
---
I'm not sure. I hope soon! It was fun.
---
You can use the teleporting dead Scorchbeast glitch on the Queen when she dies out of bounds or just can find her. It’s an awesome bug in the game honestly!
---
Wait! There's a ghoul in the Burrows that you can interact with!??!\~?
---
They might be too focused on finding new variants of the "enemies explode when ___" legendary perks.
---
Apparently it’s based on where your camp is located whatever that means lol.
---
the only joke to me is that the game is designed to drop high level players low level gear unless you are in 2 of 6 regions
---
Does this hold true for shotguns as well?   I've been trying to figure out why my double barrel does so much more damage than the explosive combat shotgun I have.  I've maxed out all three shotgun perks so this makes sense.
---
You're gonna get more Sirens :V
---
I completed the quest after the patch notes explicitly said they fixed the issue. I received a level 20 alien blaster. You'd best believe I stopped having faith in this company's patch notes.
---
Same. Read it and just went wtf. Can I get new info and not info that’s has been talked about since the public teams came to the pts. Or maybe even not have the whole post be about teams and some blurb about the mask factory event.
---
At any rate the damage output is most likely the "red flag" in that case
---
I've never seen anyone praise Borderlands for it's shared stash. It's severely limited. I would've rather had a separate stash for each character in that game.
---
"know a good way to open dialogue with Bethesda support.."
---
hah good fucking luck.
---
I was just going to suggest FO76 rip off D2's Events.
---
I like how there's a condition that needs to be met before the event goes heroic and provides further rewards.
---
Imagine if you shot down that scorchbeast at the morgantown airport during crash course or whatever it's called and suddenly you had to fight four times the mobs.
---
It's going to be used by trolls for sure.
---
All you'd have to do is make a portable trap, drop it by the event, when it's over you have the scrap box and everything behind like bait. They come running and get shafted for the bag. It's a guaranteed bag too. If you build it big enough you could get all 3 in there.
---
Yep.
---
Is anyone unable to inspect or see the model of items in vendors? Is anyone unable to trade due to the trade screens being blacked out?
---
Renaming items &amp; using skins shouldn't be the only way to keep items in your inventory. A simple lock option would be EXTREMELY helpful. I'm very good about not spamming buttons, but I nearly shit myself the other day doing encryptid. My game froze for a second while I was trying to open my pip boy and I unequipped my bloodied handmade..!!  I thought I had dropped it for a few seconds and I almost died panic searching for a bag on the ground until I realized I still had it 😅
---
I remember when GeForce Now had Fallout 76...shitty they got it removed.
---
My plasma caster, I do about 700+ damage per shot on average. Sweet weapon
---
ultracite isn't really subpar compared to the other base PAs
---
Love this!!❤️ any addition to pvp has my upvote👍
---
Have you asked a *human* that why did she need to change her name?
---
storage weight will be better off since we're not hoarding weapons on our mains
---
Yeah, I know. But I have seen that in some subs there are actual Bethesda people that sometimes respond. They responded when they wanted to send my Mom free swag for being a "gamer Mom", so they definitely seem to have at least some presence? 
---
Shot in the dark, but I figured it can't hurt...
---
This sounds like a lot of work for a mode that most people did not play.
---
It was I think 3 more base damage while at 100% HP. I have a legit BEMS Cryolator, and got screwed over by a guy with a hacked one he traded me. Not “hacked” powerful that’s for sure, but it was lvl50, so I threw it on the ground on my private server and am still on the search for a legit one. 
---
Hacked weapons don’t have to be overpowered, they can just be the wrong level.
---
I got the red rocket diner set and have turned my shop into a diner hybrid. Laid out the bar section and put my 3 vendors behind it and some booth seating in the back. My camp looks much much better.
---
Contact support by making a ticket with them https://help.bethesda.net/?doLogin=true&amp;loginRedirect=/app/account%2Foverview%2Fi_id%2F15883439
---
Gauss Minigun. I just love the sound it makes when firing. If only the spin-up were faster...or at least have a Legendary Perk for instant spinup. :c
---
I am, is this stuff thats covered under an NDA? then I wont ask of course.
---
What? Wrong thread?
---
Idk what to tell you, just play the game with frineds it a whole lot more fun than alone
---
So the only thing really worth a damn is the exploration bonus.. joy.  Will it stack with inspiration or no?
---
Haha, good luck finding a legendary corpse with that in the mix. 🤣
---
my general advice to new players is:
---
Stay in the forest for a while exploring, doing side quests and events..
---
then move north up into the toxic valley.. enemies should cap out around lvl25-30 up there..
---
by the time your leveled into the 20s youll be ready for the Ash Heap in the south which should cap out enemies around lvl 35-40..
---
outside of the Top of the world area.. The Savage Divide and Eastward will be pretty tough until youve unlocked some good perk cards and started getting rudimentary legendary gear and or PA.. all spawns could potentially be max lvl
---
Pick up everything and scrap everything at first.. you can always bulk and sell what you dont need later.. but you want as much scrap as possible up front while leveling..
---
If your worried about lack of ammo or repair/building materials.. dont! soon youll start building up so much crap you have to sell/drop/give away shit just to keep your inventory clear..
---
dont worry to much about repairing gear at first either.. just swap it out for other stuff when you can.. no sense overly repairing weapons and armor youre going to outgrow in 4 or 5 levels..
---
**also..if you want quest rewards to be max level you dont really want to progress too far into the main story until youre lvl 50**
---
**not everyone cares about the levels of those rewards.. some people collect them.. some level with them... YMMV**
---
FYI : when you level up you do Not have to Pick a card from the same stat you put the point into.. after you assign the point.. you can scroll the stats and pick any card you have unlocked
---
also.. you cant bank levels waiting for cards to unlock.. for example: you wont have access to a level 10 card until you have spent the points for the previous levels
---
of course you can wormhole certain points much more in depth.. but that is my general advice...
---
GL!
---
-edit for fixing
---
Don’t try to rush through the storyline. Explore, take on daily challenges, get to learn the mechanics of the game, and LOOT EVERYTHING for caps and scrap before going too far into the main stories. You’ll know you’re going too fast when the enemies seem impossible to kill.
---
Use melee alot to start.  Dont be afraid of high levels that run up to you they usually just want to give you stuff.  If you get the responders fireman outfit with the white helmet dont put it in your vendor for 10 caps it's worth alot. Have fun and make up you mind about how the game is on you own and if you get stuck or need some help we are all here for you.
---
did you buy them or farm them?
---
God tier waifu right here
---
not in long a while, but i feel more comfortable not risking it. i havent ever done the private server hop with a paper bag.
---
I wonder if this has something to do with the stash stealing glitches, it takes an eternity for any weapons or armor to load on my character or in the stash box when loading into a world. I’m actually ok with it if it keeps my shit safe.
---
Unfortunately fo76 doesn't have text chat, you'd have to use Steams chat or something like that. Not sure what platform you're on though
---
put a modern white display case on a rug, and you can back it up to the wall and make it look like the bats are inside the glass
---
Has been suggested many times. They most be aware of the request by now. No reason why it isn’t a thing.
---
There is already an open ticket for the issue (which they hilariously said "we assume the issue is closed if you don't respond") that she has responded to. But the original email seemed automated/canned, so I'm worried we won't get an actual human to respond to it and look into how they determined that her name was in violation of the TOS...
---
And with the 3 day window they gave us (which is already a day passed) I am not sure we will get it resolved in time before it forces her to change her name or they pick one for her. Which would then lock in her name for 3 months due to the [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) limit on nickname changes.
---
Wait, so in Public Teams, none of my teammates can build in my CAMP and vice versa.... so what's the point of having a Building Team Goal? I feel like I'm missing something here. What does a Building Team DO if they aren't building in each other's CAMPs?
---
You know, a very wise jedi once said, nothing happens by accident.
---
the 4-5 paragraphs about how to join a team is weird
---
Yes.. And feedback. And we don't even have a release date for patch so a delay wouldn't exactly change much, if such a thing was required in the first place.
---
oo how?
---
No pvp unless we are absolutely sure Bethesda is banning cheaters
---
Well, you could mention some of the Bethesda/community managers that will visit this subreddit.  Maybe they can see this and help get in-touch with Bethesda?
---
u/BethesdaGameStudios_
---
u/LadyDevann
---
Thanks for the advice! I never expected that much but I will use this information wisely
---
I want a baseball bat that can make a Super-Mutant go halfway across the map.
---
I was feeling the same way about events, no one was doing them.  I decided to start doing them in my own and have noticed that after I start people do come join me.  I think it's just a case of no one wants to be the first.  Go to the event and wait a few minutes to start it, you might be surprised.   On another note there are assholes who show up at the end of the events, like the level 337 guy who yesterday arrived at the end of Free Range, one shot the sheepsquatch and left.  The 4 of us who did the event got nothing,
---
Especially when voice chat doesn't even work for some people. Mine hasn't worked since a few of the first patches after launch. It's way too quiet to hear anyone and no matter what I've tried, I haven't been able to fix it. Plus in the EU region a lot of people don't even use voice chat
---
This is a cool idea
---
Ah the more you know!
---
According  to fed76. That's worth 25k - 40300! If you're giving that away you're an incredibly nice person. Too bad I dont play on pc or use heavy weapons 😁
---
Right!? One time, I had my girlfriend do Fasnacht because she loved doing that event (but she never plays video games) and I heard her panic so I ran over and checked the pip boy and sure enough she dropped my Instigating lever! It was in a brown paper baggy. I would have died inside if someone picked it up
---
Also: stashing your junk where? In my stash box that has 3lb free space? Alongside Fastnacht, I've converted to taking almost all junk and heavy weapons with me because then at least I can save 'space' via perks... 
---
Still 350-400lb on me and stash full. At one point lost all my stuff, 5000+ caps of junk and flux, too - not (only) because I'm dumb, but mainly because the game decided to crash while I was running back to my bag...
---
They really need to do something about their piece of shit inventory management by implementing some of the following:
---
 
---
- let us apply maybe 6 or 9 points of perks to storage
---
- scrap weight limits for scrap and/or other stackable items
---
- remove the bullshit weight limit and introduce unique item limit instead
---
- give us an account global storage for transfer between chars
---
- an option to remove items from local storage, manageable ingame (e.g. assigning items to display cases removes them from stash and uses a graphic model only, removing them reallocates the real item)
---
- bonus: pay some mod authors a couple thousand of dollars to use their QOL mods in vanilla because apparently Bethesda is incapable of implementing it themselves (for whatever fucking reason)
---
Yeah it feels more like a stretch to fill out the post. I prey it something like, no update 20 date b/c it’s dropping after the DLC roadmap thing today.
---
Hell yeah
---
I think the most important part of this announcement was the Multi-Factor Authentication being enabled for bethesda.net accounts.
---
I want this guys life... wow that sounds sadistic
---
Iiiiii don't really see the majority of people doing it? Maybe in other games but in F76 ppl are normally pretty nice. 
---
Like you could just as easily shout obscenities over mic or hang up trash comments on your camp with letters.
---
Sssshhhhhhhhhhhhh.
---
He's not asking them to Nerf the broadsider. And the broadsider doesn't even really need a buff tbh, it just needs to work and itd be fine.
---
Ah thank you for this, very thorough.  Definitely a relief to hear you can move special points around later.  I have a good plan and roadmap worked out from nukes and dragons but glad to hear there’s room for adjustment later.
---
Right, good point. Actually, the timing of it wasn't too bad as I had just bought the Marsupial plan a few days ago.  You could say I lost about 10k or so.
---
Watch this video...

Bruh, I like PvP and all, but if I wanted to play Rust I’d just play Rust.
---
8,646,507 masks divided by 336 hours (total hours in a two week period) = 25,733 players.
---
That would be amazing. Hopefully they see the post and contact me.
---
[u/BethesdaGameStudios\_](https://www.reddit.com/u/BethesdaGameStudios_/) or [u/LadyDevann](https://www.reddit.com/u/LadyDevann/) or u/jessBethesda please let me know if you can help!
---
Apparently my comment was to vague they are nerfing auto grenade launchers and buffing the prime receiver on gat plasmas
---
Boring post
---
No worries man definitely wish they could make 76 cross platform
---
I always had this except when I first started playing the game during last year’s E3...
---
Maybe I didn’t have anything in my inventory anyways...
---
On Xbox it is so bad that I get killed every time if I try to use a Radaway or change to a different weapon (via wheel instead of “left” on the d-pad). It does happen on PC (Steam) as well but not as bad. 
---
Sometimes the game freezes for like 5sec or more when bringing the favorite wheel...
---
It sucks big time
---
pacifist yo.. turn that shit on
---
Nuke the Whitespring.
---
I got that fireman outfit when I started out and had no idea at the time.  Think I sold it to the flatwoods vendor bot for probably 5 caps or something.  Found out a few months later that I done goofed lol.
---
He'll stick around until he just falls over dead for no apparent reason.
---
doesn't happen often, but you will have people like that sometimes
---
I freeze for 4 or 5, longer even.
---
Yea I dont think about those times....or the forest jumpsuit I scrapped......
---
True. But you have to be a worthless gang of cunts to sit there and gang bang a level 7.... no need to be like that.
---
I think they should do this with alot of non legendary unique weapons. Like blade of bastet or voice of set
---
Sorry for not including this but there is a event called leader of the pack in the new part of the map very good event for low level legendary gear and it pretty simple
---
Who would throw away this perfectly good used toilet paper? - Collectron
---
Same here, no matter what i change or try it has never worked. Recently i was doing an event and there was a mic indicator saying this one guy was talking, after the event i go back to my camp and then a minute later the guy appears still trying to say something, literally the only thing i could do was go into build mode and write "can't hear" on my wall and after he saw it he just gave up and left. 
---
Real social game, just barely has technology from the dark ages, good job devs.
---
What a stupid check. I setup my camp in The Mire at level 20, location doesn't mean anything.
---
I have a spare one that i don't need and its 20 weight in my inventory. It is the Final Word, the reward for Beckett's quest.
---
We already have Terminals, why not implement them somehow.
---
Terminals &amp; PipBoy seem like the easy way to implement Text Chat while we're talking about it too.
---
I gave up on trying to earn it, so I bought it from a vendor for 7k
---
And people think they want more pvp in this game
---
Usually little kids.  Look mom I killed someone!!
---
I would love to launch a kickball into someones face with a fatman  😂 Maybe mini pvp game/ events could award the winners with a small amount of scrip? A batting cage challenge would be neat too. The pitching machine could chuck baseball grenades at you and if you miss they blow up in the batter's box but if you hit it you have to try to blow up hanging targets.
---
looks like its somewhere between 3 and 7 est
---
Yeah but isn’t attacking only enabled if you shoot back, only time I had 3+ people come rushing me was when I was wanted. And they were able to just run up and kill meX and other time I get messages saying “ such and such is attacking attack back to enable pvp”
---
Not saying it’s not possible but just from my experience only time something like what you describe happens is when your wanted. Which can happen from shooting and killing to many people or from stealing or breaking into someone’s camp
---
It's intended, I think.
---
It's been the case with all Collectrons so far, so I'm assuming it's an intentional design.
---
Yes, however I found it faster in a pair for one to syringe, and one to kill during reload.YMMV
---
Not common at all. But as the other person suggested turn on pacifist mode... And try and build up workshops at lower levels. Just take them as you run across them for the XP and other rewards, but don't hang out at them or worry if someone contests it.
---
Sometimes you get lucky though man just a few days ago I did 3 SBQ in a round and in order I got 2 star bloodied combat rifle 1 star unyielding scout chest and a 3 star bolstering sturdy combat arm ( sturdy i no weak)
---
And before anyone tells me to go by a lottery ticket... yup did that didn't win
---
Well, who won? Apart from you in the end, of course...
---
This game needs to seriously rethink how loot is distributed in public events.  The fact that one or two people can show up and stop anyone else from getting any loot is fucking ridiculous.
---
Emoting and tagging enemies is nice and all, but why does it even work like this to begin with?
---
Lol imagine sending a player halfway across the map in pvp
---
dunno why they'd bother nerfing the 40mm I don't think I've ever seen one in use, tbf the gat prime receiver boosted damage by like 3% before so I'm not complaining about it not being useless
---
The public test server is no longer under NDA. You could log in right now on PC if you wanted. Every PC player has access (at least all Bethesda.net players. I could be wrong about steam)
---
Was she trying to take a workshop? Cause that's fair game in adventure mode - you don't get what you can't hold.
---
Were there any legacies?
---
Don't know if she was wanted or not.  And I'll check my son's settings for pacifist when I get home tonight.
---
Do you still take a small amount of damage until you engage or do you take no damage at all unless you shoot back?
---
Yeah that is quick and easy! But if you both tag the Fly with Syringers, you should get 2 Flies when it's killed. Then 4, then 8, then 16, then... I'm itchy now...
---
If someone has cheap goods and are at camp and I buy I tend to leave them a present. A mini nuke or missiles.  As I am a super low character and relative newb i leave ammo too. I have run across the take one swap one at Watonga and Charlston. Leave a few things and leave. A tip jar would be nice especially if it is a well built camp or has stuff you use like the decontamination shower.
---
Not that I know of sadly.
---
No damage at all!
---
For me personally the chances of it dropping from super mutant spawns is infinitely higher than anywhere else. 
---
I got 40 from nuking for the wendigo colossus and getting assault events spawning super mutants. Anecdotally they drop far more often from super mutants than anything else for me. It went from being my rarest drop and stifling my crafting of fluxes to the one I have most of.  
---
I am yet to test it fully by nuking huntersville etc, but so far it's definitely held true for me, from super mutants in the grove near the prime fissure site to just random assault spawns.
---
That’s sucks, but still good for them. This makes me happy knowing some jackass got what he deserved
---
I'm sorry what? There is nothing offensive about that username.
---
And if you find that username offensive then maybe you should take your mind out of the gutter.
---
To be fair, she is a weapon.
---
It is an intended feature.
---
When you purchase a themed collectron every type of collectron you own can then produce the resource the new one can as well as the basic scrap.
---
meh.. shit happens
---
maybe they were hoping it was a mule acct and were looking for a huge junk score..?
---
I had to change my username too. I trapped Todd or somebody, maybe Pete, they roid raged and made me change it. It took forever to get it changed too.
---
What's the temporary name they gave your mom? Mine was GenericCamp
---
Oh yeah, the email you get is worthless to reply to. I finally got them to change going through the beth website and filing a ticket. They said it took so long because I was under investigation! I'm sure they found nothing but legit activity. I'm so legit don't even run mods and same as you, had that old name since runescape.
---
I'll check the pacifist mode, thanks.
---
I'll let her know about the workshops.
---
Screen shots, or I don't believe you lol Not calling you a liar, OP, just seems too stupid to believe
---
I farmed them.
---
Mods do not have the weight reduction
---
AFAIK 90% reduced weight doesn't effect weapon mods
---
Mods add weight. Reduced weight does not apply to mods at all.
---
No, she was doing the first quest on the main quest line.
---
I don't even bother with the signal, I just run through the area looking for the npc markers, either it is a blood eagle thief that is hostile, or a raider thief that is neutral. As long as you get within 10m the marker will change to highlight the person/object on the ground.
---
Awh shoot thats fuggin sweet haha cheers :')
---
Thank you!
---
I believe the issue is the effect only applies to the weapon before mods so all that is the weight of the mods. It's dumb, I know.
---
Why are you booing him? He's right!
---
Yes see they are stealing everything
---
Like others already said, it only reduces the weight of the base weapon (so no mods)
---
You mean mods? They are rocket, heating coil, and bladed.
---
If you mean legendary, you can't get legendary bats with these colors.
---
And I’m saying such a meaningless change isn’t worth the effort and time to delay the patch, or release only the Score system.
---
I was thinking this as it's the only thing other thing that makes sense lol, thanks!
---
Junkie and vats isnt great, because youre missing the unyielding effect (agi for ap, perception for vats hit chance, luck for criticals).
---
On PC you can install mute mods for any sort of sounds, just like any collectron or instruments. Wont be possible for console sadly.
---
I mean it's always about perspective but to me that's stuff I script. And the 1 in a million is getting a good 3 star
---
It didn't though I was at like 98% which was basically interaction distance
---
working as intended.. reduction is only applied to the base weapon weight
---
maybe for a level 25-40 it would be hard, anyone higher than 50 should have walked through it.
---
I never broke a sweat and felt the same way you did, underwhelmed.
---
If they don't go in depth with stuff, people assume things and make YouTube videos without any actual knowledge and then everyone believes it and they have to make another post just to clarify what they didn't say in the last post, so, yeah, wordy but tells you what you need to know.
---
Meteor shower idea by making it not be actual meteors but pieces of the ground being launched into the air and rains down. Also could see a bit more erratic movement from the queen such as having it try to ram people or lash out with its wings and claws more.
---
This is glorious. Absolutely glorious.
---
Alright
---
I personally would prefer an option for "leave me alone, just want more XP"
---
It’s sometimes hard to believe this sub is free
---
Yeah, that was the only other thing that made sense other than a bug lol.  It's dumb yeah, but at least i know what's going on now lol, thanks!
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ That's a shame about the griefing, but the wasteland is a dangerous place. Think of it not as a reason to stop playing, but as a reason to make friends. If you were PC, I'd say lets play sometime
---
It's pure speculation on my part, but I believe in order to bring the laser weapons on par with everything else, something has to be done with the legacy versions.
---
this..
---
essential source of low level legendary gear for leveling.. and the event procs constantly
---
Once you finish the daiky quest go back to the terminal in fort defiance and access the teminal that gives the quest choose the fist option and exit the terminal then the game will give you the quest again
---
This keeps getting brought up. Why not just buy more stuff from their vendor? Most people who post here are at max caps any way and I'd appreciate more space in my stash than I would caps at this point. Or just find the player and drop them a loot bag of goodies if you feel so inclined.
---
Really disappointing to me that private teams aren't getting any love with the public teams update. I have a couple of friends I like to play with, and we typically do all sorts of stuff including events, building each others camps, or sometimes just doing our own thing. I'm fine with joining up with randoms for public events, but not getting any of these bonuses unless I party with randoms is pretty lame. sure I could join a private server, but that really defeats a lot of the point of 76, even if I'm not interested in directly grouping with others.
---
Could’ve been worse
---
Oh for sure there's a gang of guys that literally do nothing but go around griefing players. They claim they are into PvP. but they aren't. 
---
Here's their tactic. First, they put you on block for session, so you can't see a bunch of high level players coming near you. This works great if you have claimed a workshop and are at it. Because it's auto PvP. If you happen to look at the map, you can't see them on it. They will sneak up behind you and mow you down.
---
If they can't find someone at a workshop, they have one of them use a low level character, who will attack you with a low damage weapon over and over. If you get annoyed and decide, I'm going to show this lowbie a lesson and attack back, that makes you a PvP target. So they all start shooting you from a distance. And your dead before you know it. 
---
Currently, they are all pissed and upset, because bethesda is going to make it so that if you engage in PvP with someone, it's just between you and them. Not you and your whole team. So their little tactic of group ganking people isn't going to work anymore. 
---
I've encountered them several times. I just block them or move to another server if they are on.
---
Change the name, but add a 1 to the end.
---
It is a heavy energy weapon
---
We'll take a look at this, it definitely seems strange!
---
And you get the wolf horde right after.  4 pics of low level gear in 30 minutes
---
Seriously. They hacked out half the content of the patch, feels like that would speed up the release date.
---
And the crowd goes wild fluttering into the light
---
I commend the effort in writing this, but PVP in this game is dead.  There’s not enough interest of the overall community to invest time and money into developing a new PVP mode that people aren’t going to play.  
---
Workshops are rarely taken, Hunters/Hunted is never active, no one does monster mash, Nuclear winter is dead except for a few die yards and people trying to get the overseer rewards.  Survival mode failed.  PVP has been changed over and over as most people didn’t want it (And the grinfers too)
---
With all the PVP failures and lack of interest in PVP, why would they invest in making a new PVP mode? Something that would be released for free?
---
It appears mods don't benefit from reduced weight, only the weapon itself.  Whether this is intended is another matter lol
---
Any nice legendaries?

Some kind person dropped the plans for the 200mm lens plans at Faschnaut before I even had a camera and I've been using it ever since after actually starting the bucket list quest. I finished it yesterday and was bummed to find out that despite more broken deluxe camera spawning as loot now I can't make a new one with a 200mm lens to drop for people.
---
Usually when I'm adding clothing/armour.
---
Put one up, wait til the rotating image starts moving fluidly instead of stuttering, around 10-12s or so, then put the next one up.
---
Pain in the ass.
---
I had a spare vending machine with a sign that said good stuff on the front.  Inside was a single note that said "all gone" for 25k caps.  Someone bought my note and ruined my whole joke.  I was near max caps so didnt even profit much
---
Let me put that again
---
The signal is BULLSHIT. And a waste of time to try to follow, the area the game tells you to search is small, and almost always has hostile npcs that will cause the quest target to fight them, if you go to the gunshots in the zone that is a better way of finding the target than the buggy, glitchy, radio marker that is often in the wrong place.
---
I can run through and cover the entire zone in less than a minute by Z crossing it occasionally firing my gun so any hostile npcs make themselves known to me. If the target is a non hostile they will show up on your compass as a yellow marker at a rather large distance. In addition the target almost always has friends that are the same type and lead you easily to the location of said target if you find one.
---
This and the deliverer. I like ppk and makarov a lot and this was a bummer to me, when I did my first weekly challenge for the legendary, that the deliverer was just an icon for weapon rewards.
---
Also, people are dumb af to downvote me when I just point a fact. Many fo4 models are not in 76. They can't "bring back" something that isn't present. Also models and texture conversion from 4 to 76 are not just a matter of copy/paste.
---
Not sure, my cousin got them, I was able to hear and see the chaos.
---
Oh pop
---
Oh ok, if you get any good one just edit the post.
---
It's something that probably should be tested. They made changes to the damage recently.
---
ehrm... did she attack back? because thats how u initiate pvp, otherwise they can keep hitting her for eternity, or just switch servers?
---
&gt; just over repetitive
---
I dare any quest to try and take that title from Preston.
---
and don't call me Shirley!
---
this is good info, thanks!
---
I just found out about The Burrows and did it for the first time yesterday.  And the whole time I'm just thinking..."why isn't there more stuff like this?".  
---
Yeah, this game needs the equivalent of the *A World of Pain* mod from New Vegas.
---
Okay thanks. They look good on display. I’m hoping for smaller display boards at some point please Bethesda.
---
Just play the game broski
---
Thanks for the help
---
Oh right. Yup!!!
---
Yes! That support ticket I sent in last week asking for 2FA totally pushed them over the edge!
---
Thanks man,  specially when she hasn't played any video games in like 10 years. She's been watching me play and finally ask if she could join for this to happen.
---
I was reading another thread and someone mentioned that a well places orbital strike grenade can take care of their camps. Is this correct? 
---
Might have to make a few for the next few griefers.
---
You're buying/selling too fast.. What Blokeh said. Same thing happens trading between 2 players.
---
I understand you love your idea, but can we at least let it come out so that the majority who don’t spend time on reddit and/or even try the PTS get a chance to test it?  Let Bethesda collect some data on it first to see what options people are selecting vs. what actives they are actually doing (We already know they collect in game data like this). 
---
Who knows, some of the options might need to be reworked, or the idea might not get any groups formed and the idea may be scrapped in the future.  Can we at least let the system as they designed it come out and try it on a grander scale first before we start shitting on them because the options aren’t broken down the way you want them to be?
---
Didn't they say public teams were set for update 20 the last ITV?
---
Like isn't this literally confirming everything everyone already knew?
---
Damn. I still haven't found one.
---
Just found out I cant. Having to dump 1000+ tech data. It's not that I was actively collecting them, I just happened to scroll through my Mics. tab and saw a ton of them.
---
I’m not buying or selling anything.  I’m loading my machine.
---
Always play solo so nothing fresh
---
serrrriously though. during fasnacht i saw a dude with the username “mooncricket”. if you think mommysalami is more offensive than that, youre a fuckin idiot.
---
I use acrobat armor and store my stuff. I'm not even sure light footed works, last time used it it didn't do anything vs punji- took damage crouched.
---
And if trying to loading an item faster than every 2/3 minutes is “too fast”... this game is fucking broken.
---
Some huge poison aura would make the fight a lot more exciting
---
Just a reminder that text chat will never make it to the game and because, I quote
---
&gt; most of our steam players came from console, so there isn't a real need for text chat
---
This is literally the reason you do not have text chat right now. Because the devs are so stupid they think steam players don't want text chat because they think they came from console. Despite this being a feature that's been requested since the beta and is one of the most popular mods available.
---
I wish I was misquoting Bethesda
---
Yeah like when it lands it should have a body slam effect that stuns all surrounding players
---
Have you tried reinstalling?  Perhaps something bugged out on your xbox when it was being installed, or maybe the xbox patched it wrong.
---
Yeah, I had about 100 and it actually was preventing me from picking up more and triggering the quest.  Had to get rid of them to get the quest to pop again.
---
Light footed works, we made sure to test it ourselves before going to camps just in case.
---
To bad we can't custom the skins, I would have them all setup. especially as a champion of Khorne
---
Aaaaaand no PvP public teams. God DAMMIT Bethesda, we've been suggesting that since DAY. ONE. of the PTS. What is even the point of gathering feedback if the dev team just plugs their ears and goes "LALALALALA CAN'T HEAR YOUUUU"?
---
No thanks. I don't need a guestbook to be filled up with spam/grief. I realize a lot of the community is genuinely good people, but the internet as a whole and with PC gaming as it is, not thanks. Just one more thing to get abused and, depending on how it's implemented, possibly exploited. Call me a conspiracy case, but if vendors can be hacked I'm sure these could as well. Someone enters in a code and all of a sudden your camp is flooded with hate speech and you get a TOS notification or something. No thanks.
---
Hmm, non-descriptive title **and** a meme post. That’s a new one.
---
Thanks for the info!  This bonus coupled with  Legendary perks on top of unyielding builds...our players are essentially becoming Lorenzo Cabot from FO4
---
Lol I know right ?
---
For the glory! For the honor! This! IS! APPALACHIA!
---
He went on a diet. Like this post.
---
Agreed. Running events with a group is more fun that doing it solo. It'll be nice to set up a public team rather sending random team invitations.
---
That is a lot of donuts.
---
If you nuke whitespring on a privat server you can just kill all the ghouls, relog and kill them again. Rinse and repeat.
---
I’ve been playing on it a While without a problem so I don’t want to delete the progress I’ve made
---
They should have added PvP Public Teams.
---
Check your Xbox Live subscription as well, it does that when your live is expired
---
Was it where one of the players started gun bashing her and his mates were in the back ready to blast once she struck back? That's usually what people tend to do, atleast in my experience, just gun bash you until your "grounded" mutation goes off or you attack back, then they all jump you in a team with fully loaded Legacy weapons (legacies are laser rifles/gatling plasmas/flamers that dropped off legendary enemies with the explosive prefix which deals INSANE explosive damage). If she encounters something similar, just change lobby, these types of players want one thing, attention.
---
Text chat is the best thing they can add to the game right now.
---
Don't know she was on the other room. She said she was fighting some scourged (purple zombies with green crystals) and then they were all dead including her. And when she respawned they kept following her and jumping in front of her every time she tried to engage other enemies.
---
😆 that's an ever green classic
---
Yes, also at vendors and crafting stations.
---
I'm trying not to spoil anything in case anyone reading hasn't finished it, but isn't the resolution providing the location of the last quest essentially making it redundant unless you did it prior to completing the last quest? I also enjoyed it though.
---
I am mute, the lack of a text chat makes you feel super excluded, it is so disheartening!
---
Yes they kept following her and trying to kind of jump in front of her attacks as she attacked enemies.
---
I like the idea of a claptrap with maybe 4 slots that are shared. 
---
But a shared stash is not the way to go.
---
I am pretty sure the limit on the number of items we can store is to conserve the resources required to manage that data. The number of Horders in Bethesda games is vast.
---
The limitless storage for the Fallout 1st membership is just for scraped junk. That is a finite list of generic items. Therefore, it is easy to manage the data.
---
The display cases and vendors are linked to the stash. That entire system would have to change. Otherwise one character could use up all the storage.
---
But then we would have people making the max number of vendor machines and display cases.
---
Plus it is probably tricky to manage character restricted items on a shared stash. So then two stashes would be needed...and we are back to the claptrap idea.
---
I got it from the event but I've yet to get a legendary naturally
---
Thank you so much! Please feel free to reach out in PM, I can get you mine or my mother's contact email!
---
My Xbox live is still In date but thanks for the help
---
Yeah. The thing is it's not that exponential because ultimately you are limited by the speed of the Syringer.  You can't shoot 4 to make 8 inone reload.
---
I think it has to do with older generations that appreciate the nuances that TTL photography offer. Or anyone who is actually a professional or amateur photographer.
---
Most people nowadays think a camera is just a subset of their phone, which it sounds like the group you belong to. Nothing wrong with that, but you are missing out on the idea of composition and exposure. A dedicated device has so many more opportunities to tweak and adjust these elements to the users liking. Digital photography only offer these changes post capture, which most people don't bother with. "Did I get the selfie" is number 1 concern, not depth of field or black levels.
---
Anyhow, you do what you do, to each their own, right?
---
I disagree that stat bonuses are junk, we have to remember that this isn’t designed just for the meta Bloodied/unyielding builds out there - things like CHA can give a bonus to a whole group when your completing quests together as well as making speech checks easier for everyone. Building is also great for crafting (as a group) for the better durability.  Luck might be the least useful, but does get you better quality of drops so you can earn more money when you sell them. 
---
Again, have to look at this from more than just the end game players standpoint.
---
That message is normal stuff. 2/3 minutes though, maybe a bad server. I'm talking like wait a couple seconds.
---
I'd love to see the queen grab a player in her mouth and chomp them like the dragons in Skyrim. Likewise it would be awesome for melee players to be able to jump on her head and perform a power attack. There's so much more interesting behaviour that they could have ported over from Skyrim in that respect since she's basically a reskin of a dragon.
---
Yep, these players are annoying. I switch lobbies instantly unless im in a mood to unload my mag into some foes, i have some of these legacy weapons too, they're great fun from time to time.
---
I started playing at Wastelanders, but I'm "working" from home and put a lot of hours into the game. As it stands I have two level 120s with full three USSS gear and max rep in this game, and four level 30s at 628 SHD in Division 2. The main issue is Division 2 is not rewarding in any way, but in this game you still get things that can be useful in some way.
---
I mean, yes, but collecting the pieces is kind of fun and reading through the clues.
---
I don't keep a weapon on me that's not legendary, but I'll keep the lowest caliber, worst stat 1 star or whatever just so I don't one shot things at events.  Fasnacht was a joke because people were killing the ONLY legendary with their massively OP weapons. It's stupid at this point.
---
I wish one day i will have a wife or someone who loves me
---
I never said anything about the morality of stealing or scamming irl. I was pointing out that just because someone scams in a video game doesnt mean they scam irl, most likely because it's much harder to accomplish. Actions in a video game don't necessarily reflect how a person is irl. 
---
And if I were to log in tonight and my entire account had been wiped, it would definitely suck hard. I would be furious, but ultimately all I would lose is saved data. I can replace it all. If I were to go home and find my house burned down, that would be a much more devastating loss. And some stuff I would likely never be able to replace. You cant compare the value of video game data to the value of irl items.
---
There you go, mate.  Hope it works out for you and your mom.
---
Bethesda likes to hate on creative names, I was banned for the name JesusChrist. I  sent them a whole argument and used their own ToS to say pretty much that it wasn't offensive; but they forced me to change my name and told me that it was deemed too offensive. I see that maybe if I made a post here, it'd be fixed. I had many friends on Nuclear Winter that don't recognize me anymore.
---
I bought a second game just for item transferring
---
“When cooking items, chance for a random enemy to explode on crafting a cooked item.”
---
Yeah, it all comes down to end game and rewards from time invested. Neither does very well, but I firmly believe FO76 does it better.
---
But think of all those fedoras you have now.
---
My girl and I knew we were going to be the couple with a couch and 2 side by side TVs with 2 consoles, the look of confusion on other people's faces when they visit is more the amusing part.
---
Just wish I could get her to play more Fo76 and less sims, because when she is playing Fo76 she might as well be playing the sims. Dont get me wrong, I love camp building, and I've got some pretty spectacular camps, but I'd also like to do some combat with my partner.
---
Our gameplay tends to be her logging in, spending an hour browsing the atom shop for camp pieces, another hour of placing whatever she managed to scrape out of the atoms she has left over, and 10 minutes of chasing the enemies around at Slocum Joe's across the street from her camp and that is mainly because while she was building they killed her brahmin. Then she logs off.
---
Mean while I'm sitting beside her, killing the scorched queen, scripping my useless legendaries, counting my serums, making builds on nukes and dragons, and falling asleep while waiting. Oh well. Lol
---
Keep it in your pants, it's a fo76 post, not a hub.
---
"Believe, believe/yes you can/in the power of the [mothman!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VRZTYXaDVg)
---
That happened to me except I just quit for the day ,irl, then started again early the next morning. I had assumed it was just that the new daily had started and I benefited from the game not recognizing that I had completed part of the daily.
---
I will have to try the server hop. Thanks
---
Currently farming this myself, done it 8 times and keep getting the same thing. 
---
Not really bothered as it's giving me something to work towards, and it could be worse as I keep reading horror stories on here about it never being completed at all even when you activate it.
---
In fo4, right. Two different games with different gamefiles.
---
Oh man.. Any way to get rid of just one mutation..? xD
---
I relate.
---
I'll nuke both Whitespring and Harper's Ferry then hop between them. By the time you clear out one, the other has respawned.
---
Level 98. Dailies stopped for me as well with Raider Punk.
---
Lol I just want friends. That’s my first step
---
10% chance to drop from completed event. So RNG gonna RNG.
---
I have the same problem as well. No workaround that I have found. I am hoping whenever the next update is and the servers are brought down it will come back up repaired.
---
Jackal? Hellsing tribute?
---
I just want friends that’s my first goal,
---
You have to get the last hit, I recommend soloing it if you have a private server.
---
I completely understand how real life photography works lol I don't think camera = smart phone. 
---
I'm not talking about real life photography. I'm talking about an in game camera that doesnt look much different visually from the photo mode.
---
This. I'd also appreciate some new weaponry. Bring back my Wattz laser weapons damn it!
---
when patchie? team group? no food drink?
---
Its because they use google translate, and dont hire a proper localization translator.
---
If you type fractured steel into google translate it comes out as gebrochener Stahl, its the same with scout armor one you mentioned as well.
---
They ban people for doing this btw. Just as a warning
---
As MommySalami's daughter, who coined this name for her when I was 8 years old, thank you!!! ❤ Mom is 70 years old and just wants to play under her nickname with her adult kids during COVID19 🙏🏻 (she is also such a badass and sooo doesn't deserve this headache right noe!!)
---
LOL yeah, Fasnacht really showcased some of the insanely offensive (or in some cases, creative) names that people have. Not all of them were bad, but some you are just like "Wow...".
---
Pray hard to RNGesus.
---
I see your point. But it seems that people do care as the plans seem to sell quickly.
---
That's because Bethesda is incompetent. I'm a lvl 160 or so and I'm not bloodied or some other OP build, just some 'normal' build with average dmg (as in: still pretty high damage, as in: appropriate/sensible dmg, as in: low dmg compared to the other OP builds).
---
I had mad respect for all robots there besides protectrons and died  a few times on this quest, esp. to gutsies and sentries as per usual. So it's not that the quest is too easy, it's that Bethesda can't balance shit. And it's that the dmg range for a lvl50+ is something like 150 dps to 30000dps.
---
We Outward now
---
I didn't eat any, considering you need to go out of your way to craft the thing first
---
My point was more about they can't bring back something that was never in this game more than this mod doesn't exist. Of course they can import the models and shit. But it requires more work than a simple copy/paste.
---
I don't think trashing extra perks is a good route for this system. I think perk load outs would be a better way to go to improve the system. Set say like 3 or 4 different load outs for different situations, no need to scroll through perks just select the perk deck you saved previously. There are a few perks I still use occasionally that don't quite fit in a build but I like to use briefly. A crafting set, a building set, a battle set, and a scav set maybe.
---
No, but you don't need to rush it either. *Patience Young Padawan*.

---
i agree. the couple slots would be more than fine with me and is what i meant by shared stash, thanks for clarifying. the one big stash for all characters sounds like an absolute nightmare haha!
---
well it seems sometimes the server bugs out a bit and doesn't run the script for nuked flora to replace the previous correctly
---
Had this happen twice yesterday when my hubby claimed a workshop. We don’t do PVP, these people were obviously upset they got shit perk cards in NW or upset they suck at COD. They killed me a couple times before I knew what was going on. Then they just jumped around a ton and kept stimpacking then magically I was able to vats,  and one shot critical with my awesome shotgun. Sorry bout ya life. 
---
The second time was this group of assholes. One ambushed my hubby, kept jumping around, so I just followed them and threw nuka grenades and vats-ed the grenades over and over. I wasn’t damaging them but they got super annoyed lol
---
Soon after patch 19 came out they said that patch 20 isn’t for another month or so. So most likely it’ll be here right at the end of June or possibly into July
---
Even as a casual player, I'd have a hard time taking +4 charisma over 100% extra XP from events. Theres nothing that these stat bonuses give than chems/alcohol cant give. The experience boosts are head and shoulders better than the other options and that's the problem.
---
Yeah I was hoping for mid/late June for seasons. Happy cake day also!
---
LOL take my upvote sir!
---
Sure: [https://imgur.com/a/vW5lmcX](https://imgur.com/a/vW5lmcX)
---
A lot of times at Scorched earth I switch weapons and the game is so lagged that usually it switches me back to my other weapon or a different one in my inventory. Since I switched from melee it hasn’t been so bad though
---
Same here the B@#!% just won't  take her medication.
---
The claptrap stash box for moving items between characters, and the trade menu are two things I want from Borderlands 2 in 76. Being able to trade items for items would assure nobody gets ripped off ever again. (It would suck because all the couriers would be out of a job, but most I’ve talked to said “Yeah it would suck not being a courier anymore, but It would be worth it just so people can’t get ripped off anymore.”)
---
Damn, I was sure I had but that’s fair. I’ve not launched a nuke yet so private server isn’t in it for me right now. That sounds super time intensive! But thank you for the reply!
---
I don't get it, I made a comment on what seems most efficient, that's all I wanted to contribute to the convo... downvoted too? Alright man you have a nice day anyway.
---
It's bugged. There is a rumor you need to get the last hit on her but plenty of people have soloed her and still don't get it to complete.  I have definitely gotten the last hit on her quite a few times and nothing, still isn't complete.
---
also considered doing this. would be beneficial since i only ever play solo and could lvl up my own alts that way. time to build a second pc hah
---
I’ve completed it twice a few weeks apart in the last couple months and I got the plan both times. That’s RNG for you
---
Hope the team up feature is a success. Might get me back on playing some more.
---
gebrochen would be the right vocabular but I think they messed it up because gebrochen and geborsten kinda looks the same on forst glance
---
I love this
---
I agree. There is a reason the one thing that always gets an update with new phones is the camera. There are lots of photo editors and filters and such.
---
All this is duplicating what photographers used to do. An oldschool photographer had very fine control over manipulating the picture at the point of taking the shot. Then s/he had the option to manipulate the negatives and then could even manipulate each print.
---
We see a lot of people going back to vinyl records for the sound. Maybe we will see a resurgence of non-digital cameras in the future? Who knows.
---
Yeah that guy's suggestion is helpful knowledge but completely unreasonable for the average person to accomplish. I wouldn't even waste my time.
---
agreed 100% haha
---
Thanks lol
---
because the stupid game is programmed to check with the server for every little thing you do, including movements. all sorts of weird nonsense during the SBQ fight because there's too much going on, and everyone is hitting the server at once.
---
I once had 500 rounds loaded into my Lever Action as I was switching between it and a Minigun and the game spazzed out
---
unlucky
---
Vampiric FFR gauss mini.  Vamp's lets me tank anything while never interrupting my RoF for stimpacks, which are also frustratingly delayed by the spindown otherwise.
---
I didn't downvote you though?
---
Everyone gets the same items. Switch it to the other setting to get more "valuable" consumables.
---
If it does I haven't noticed. I use semi auto rifles and I mainly get melee and heavy weapons.
---
Yup yup, I had a mod that added the Hellsing Jackal in New Vegas and Fallout 4, big fan of Hellsing Ultimate Abridged.

RNG will RNG, done this Event for countless times now. Still no Plan
---
Is this another username that isn't offensive or is there something wrong with mooncricket?
---
Wife crispies
---
Apparently you can put a ticket in and they'll give you the atoms for the quest BUT the quest wont be completed. 
---
I've killed hundreds and hundreds of sbqs and still not got the quest done
---
Wait, what it the deal with drops and the location of your CAMP?
---
Fricken RNG, it will drop eventually.  I had done the event a bunch of times without getting it and then finally had it drop about a week ago, and then got another a few days later on my second run after the first drop.
---
Nope. Reasonable rumour has it what effects you have in your collection influences what will drop. Not sure if that has ever been verified but I've noticed if, say, I'm on my bloodied toon more bloodied stuff drops than other effects. Not necessarily on good stuff though.
---
That one is actually understandable, you might not like it but there are a couple religions with him as an important figure and i suspect you know that some might find that offensive.
---
very sick will keep my eyes peeled thanks dude!
---
Looks like we have a rogue in our midst
---
Which vendor?
---
Do all YouTubers have this same set of sponsorships or do we watch the same people?
---
THEY TOOOK OUR JOBBBS!
---
It doesnt take an insane amount of resources to make replayable content. CoD Zombies and Halo Halo Firefight are just a collection of maps that pale in comparison to Fo76's location count and detail, but the issue is that there is no game design that makes someone want to repeat this content. All they have to do is refresh some of these dungeons with different enemies each day or week, and offer rewards for completion, and that would do wonders.  
---
&gt;  I shouldn’t expect to have a lifetime of entertainment for free with weekly content updates. 
---
Again, I've had years of entertainment with just a few maps and modes. Bethesda just missed the mark with not adding in a proper raiding system. They also should have made Raider and Settler events with objectives that fit the lore. It's not about new content each week - I dont expect a new Event each week, **the real issue here** is REPLAYABLE content. 
---
Bethesda drastically missed the ball with Wastelanders in regards to endgame content. They made a system designed to incentivize daily play after the quests ended but they didnt bother to add in anything more to DO in the game other than Radiation Rumble and Riding Shotgun (and Riding Shotgun is utterly boring). Rad Rumble is a great event but they shouldve focused more on events. The daily quests are an absolutely chore as well - Raider and Settler events should have existed and awarded reputation. 
---
&gt;  I paid $60 18 months ago. 
---
I get what you're saying but you're missing the point. ATX and FO1st are paying for post launch content, I'm not asking for them to release a Wastelanders sized update every week, I'm asking them to *divert* their development towards replayable content. It looks like eventually the game will have more replayable content in the Fall and Winter updates, but until then there isnt much reason to play the game. 
---
&gt; 800 hours in and I am not bored. 
---
How? There's almost no variation to the Scorched Earth event and well over half the other events arent worth playing (like Census Violence and The Messenger - complete bores of modes).
---
Player vendor, sorry if I made you think I meant a npc
---
game changer thank you.  I'm AlanFeathers on PSNow
---
Best. Spouse. Evar!
---
Always interesting to hear about marriages where the wife is the gamer and the husband isn't.
---
gotcha thank you
---
I’ve got a bloodied 50crits 15crit fill plasma, if you’re rifleman and mod it into a sniper it’s pretty powerful. It’s not something I buy ammo or craft ammo for but if I have built up carts it’s worth pulling out of the stash and sniping mobs with. BFFR is a good roll on a laser as well mine is comparable to the bffr combat rilfes dps.
---
Lol I did, now I am sad again. Grinding this plan has been so depressing. Thanks for the clarification.
---
People  have done that and it hasn't worked. It's obviously bugged.
---
They reverted those changes
---
T-51 is the best vanilla PA in terms of DR/ER.  Excavator is best for carry weight. Every other vanilla set is underwhelming when compared to those two.
---
The recipe isn't rare, but the actual item itself is such a bitch to make that no sane person would ever go out of their way to craft it (3 brahmin milk, 2 frog eggs, 1 salt, 1 spices, 1 cooking oil, and wood...all for ONE doughnut). I, however, am not sane and have an ingredient gathering route for all of these to sell doughnuts at 25 caps each, probably undercharging like hell. They don't expire which is their literal only notable quality.
---
it is definitely an offensive derogatory term.
---
HaHa! We will find them, and when we do... BLOATFLY THEY'LL BECOME!
---
I remember back in EQ I had a Paladin named Dravious Holyavenger (which I named after the D&amp;D sword) they made me change my last name because it had "religious overtones". Duh, isn't a paladin a holy warrior based on his belief in his God? I swear sometimes these GM's and company's have nothing better to do.
---
Get lead belly
---
Ublock origin is better
---
Not the case, have solo'd her on a private and still doesn't credit.
---
It's been bugged forever.
---
Its a common name in Hispanic culture; to name yourself after Jesus, or to proclaim yourself to be Christ-like. In that sense, its not heathenish to name yourself Jesus Christ. Its no more sacrilegious as being named John or Mary.
---
I got a 2 shot flamer and i could waste 150 fuel before what i am fighting dies. The health bar melts in a second or two but just refills. It sucks because the weapon is a beast but realisticly useless in combat because of the servers inability to calculate damage properly.
---
I am completely aware that the Strangler Heart uses the Ultracite mods. But many people weren't able to get SH when the vaults were active and the T-65 is even more common than the SH after Wastelanders. 
---
Sure theres plenty of SH, but veterans will most likely have all the Ultracite mods plans already
---
The mode was poorly done with no incentive/rewards. They split the pvp population between NW and survival. If you wanted to shop vendors or do the Queen, you would join an adventure server. All these would make it seem that there is not a pvp player presence, but I’m telling you there is🔪
---
I frequently forget that there are gamers that are old enough to retire.
---
Find a good lady who sounds like that except when your sister dies of cancer and you get sad about it she starts talking to the guy she said not to worry about and then she sends pictures and then guilts you for 6 years about not being trustworthy enough
---
Don’t trust any of them. She’s not yours it’s just your turn. Either she’s phat and doesn’t mind you playing so much indoors or she will get bored and eventually someone else will come along
---
I have all the same wholesome memories you do but the moment shit gets rough and virtual items in video games become as meaningless as they really are, bet she won’t stay a good lady
---
It fucking blows. Sorry for over sharing but I thought I had a good lady too
---
Make sure you are hitting her from stealth. That should help those numbers somewhat. If that is what you are doing from stealth, then yeah junkies or bloodied will be your best bet. AA will help some, but not as much as those. Ballistic bock will bump up you ballistic weapon damage and I think psychotats will stack with that as well.
---
Yes, we shall harvest the enemy's glands for precious fluids XD
---
I played a merchant character I always sold out my inventory on ps4 but had very low prices. I turned over maybe 5000 caps per hour of play time, with most of that being play on my private server. Sell cheap ammo types at 0 and I usually buy something else from your vendor for the difference like 2000 .38 I would buy 500-800 caps worth of other stuff.
---
If you want to sell quickly chems under 10, stimpaks 15, nuka 5-25 based on rarity, ammo at 1, acid 4 per scrap lead 3 per scrap steel 2 per.
---
If you want to swueeze more out of your inventory add about 50 percent to those prices and they will go at a lower sale rate. Lower prices do not really move it for normal buyers although super cheap and other merchants will buy it all up to sell for more in their machine if they have stash space.
---
I’m not sure how it all stacks, the purpose of having it is to save the perk card space. Like I said, casual play you’ll clear a room well before needing a reload and anything SBQ or Encryptid a couple seconds aren’t going to matter
---
oh
---
Yes.
---
I'd hoped for something like this for the golf club, but no
---
I didnt do anything other than show up at right time and place. Once I tagged the big fucker both beasts came over and started tanking. It killed the non legendary in about 2 or 3 minutes but the 1* lasted till about 20% health left. At that point I just kited it around for another 10 minutes with an BE .50. It was fully out of the forest and fighting on open ground. A couple days later I saw another with my buddy and my son and we couldnt get it out of the forest, so must have been the SB doing. 
---
I got it done, but it was long and dirty and frankly SB did all the heavy lifting.
---
Mostly worried about the pvp scene.
---
Here is the video. I did not have adrenaline on, I took it off. Early shots in the video show damage of 339 with the Junkies.
---
I then equip the TS handmade. At about 2:10 in the video is when I'm able to get some consistent shots. Firing 1 round shows 278 and 128 for the damage.  Then I go back to the junkies and it shows 342.
---

---
Thanks, second time was the charm.
---
Tbh I'm a real recluse, so I think this system will help me get the "join 20 teams" trophy easier. Once I've got that I probably won't use the system any more...
---
You mom sounds cool.
---
You have it on arguably the worst setting for a collectron.  I mean the blood packs are nice for making nuka cola my bloods in it but the other scavenged items are crap. Switch it to Proletariat.  You will get stimpacks, water, food (raw and cooked veggies), and chems instead which are much more useful than broken swords.
---
In the early game these creatures are hardcore! 
---
I’m just picturing a horde of them coming from all directions in meat week.. carnage 😀
---
It doesn’t. So this is my loadout now
---
Strength (15): Barbarian, Iron Fist, Blocker, Incisor, Martial Artist
---
Perception (3): Glow Sighted
---
Endurance (3): Adamantium Skeleton
---
Charisma (6): Suppressor, Tenderizer
---
Intelligence (8): Nerd Rage, Makeshift Warrior
---
Agility (12): Action Boy, Marathoner, White Knight (1 star), Adrenaline
---
Luck (9): Serependipity, Class Freak, Starched Genes, Critical Savy (1 star)
---
I’m saving up as I level up for better perks to swap. Is the only thing to run a good bloody build that I need is Radicool? If so, I have that perk and can easily swap it out if I want to
---
Sorry maxed caps on my 3 characters.
---
Missile launcher because it doesn't use up all its ammo in 12 seconds
---
Edit:spelling
---
How do you make sure u get the same server when u change character?
---
Bots.
---
My surname is Riddle. I went on Adidas's website and tried to personalise my son a football shirt.
---
"Riddle" violates their naming policy....
---
P.S, no, his first name isn't Tom :-)
---
But that's not what you were doing and not everyone who plays this game comes from a hispanic culture, you literally named yourself Jesus Christ and i think you know what you did is offensive to some.
---
Text chat when? What's the point of teams if you can barely communicate with them yeah?
---
🤣🤣 I can see that. This is the most we've gamed together. I'm always working and when I'm off the kids want my attention so we squeeze in maybe 7 hours a week top. But quarantine happened and its been magic. We restarted in March and have our build and weapons built prime. Still a work in progress but i'm loving the time we are getting. We are basically on 24/7. so if anyone ever is on ps4 we could always use/welcome a third to help with bigger game. I should be going back to work soon so we are putting in as much time as possible.
---
Slurp Slurp!
---
Part of the problem with the Workshops is that they are not persistent. So the rewards needs to be instant to make it worth holding. Like literally a huge chunk of rewards for just taking it either from empty or another player. Then every time you repel an attack by another player you get another chunk of rewards.
---
AND the resources need to AUTO generate themselves without having to build any extractor and just go into a container next to the Workshop control. And by resource, I mean the actual resource, not the ores that generate them. 
---
Cause no one is going to waste their resources to build on a Workshop that they know is going to disappear the moment they disconnect from the server. Which btw, due to the fantastic programming of the game, can happen at any time the server decides it no longer wants you. And you have build the extractors, which don't actually give you the resource, but you have to come back, take the ores and go back to smelt them. 
---
Is it any wonder Workshops are almost ALWAYS empty?
---
I can see why Gowron approves upon both of you.
---
For sure lol
---
Funny enough we weren’t planning on crushing it that fast, we just did missions that were closest to each other then towards the end of the week, bam finished main story n side quests, while doing events and dailies at the same time. To say the least the story was underwhelming and short :( *fingers crossed* brotherhood has a bigger story line but I’m not holding my breath
---
use the mod then and u can chat with your so enjoyable public that use text chat... the same 5 dudes of everyday plus the random asking for something
---
It's a toss up whether these will count towards the challenge. Sometimes stuff just isnt coded the same, even when it's super similar. Example, lovers embrace and kindred spirit dont count towards being well rested for daily level up challenges - despite being basically the same effect just longer.
---
I enjoy doing bots on parade just for the “thank you for using bb bb bot stop!”
---
Trading, generally.
---
I would rather see bonus rewards or some sort of reward control. Bonus XP isn't really all that important in this game.
---
edit: how exactly do you build as a team?
---
Here was my perk loadout at the time. Forgot to get it in the video:

---
Yeah, but people don’t accept junk for rare weapons.
---
Same, but for a Behemoth
---
Thanks for the suggestions on ballistic bock and physcotats. I’ve never tried either one of those. 
---
Any idea where I can buy the recipes?  They in whitesprings?
---
It's all RNG. Theres no "desire detector" mechanic in this game.
---
Hmm I hope you're wrong. I would imagine just being in a group with other people would count as you being in a team whatever method you take to do it. Guess I'll find out on the update. I'd like to play with people, but none of my friends play.
---
Yeah o can't imagine a worst way to go about it, no way I'm gonna reroll a whole unyielding set for all my alts. They will be just mules
---
Did I state it as fact?
---
its the milk that kills it.
---
The RNG of Murgh, sometimes she hates you, but on rare occasions she gives you love.
---
Ballistic bock recipe is gotten from Biv by doing his daily quests (part of the Nukashine DLC). I'm not sure where to get the psychotats recipe, but you may be able to find it a player vendors, I don't think you'll find it at Whitesprings.
---
steam have like 11k or 15k at peak so between beth.net and consoles are only 10?
---
yeah , thats part of why i go full health and i kinda have a hard time separating role playing from the game.  
---
plus i dont understand what exactly unyielding would be doing for me xD.
---
Farm trash legendaries and exchange them for legendary scrip. Rinse and repeat until you have the legendary that you want.
---
Thought this myself, I've never been dropped a good weapon. Spent thousands of scrip at purveyor, just stopped doing it now.
---
Ah - yeah I dropped 960 scrip and got straight trash lol ok I will keep trying
---
People tend to server hop areas that tend to spawn legendary enemies. Do it enough times and you'll end up with something semi decent. If you do end up with a god roll weapon, you can then swap it for one you do want
---
What is the point of these articles anymore? they use to be actually informative now they don't tell you anything, just reused info and no length to them at all.
---
Do you need one? I've got a spare you can have
---
You get lucky, you find a good roll or you get an event  rare and trade it asap. 
---
You join trade groups and discord.
---
You hold on until you can get a trade in your favour, never take a lesser items for 1 good one.
---
Eventually you get something valuable enough to trade for a legacy or the like.
---
Ok, I don’t served hop. I will try that.
---
DR/ER is about 350/375 before you get hit hard with diminishing returns.
---
You probably know this, but There's also the Raider's daily turn in of mirelurk products at Ohio River Adventures, the Raider named Blackeye.
---
Fastest Fasnacht event 9mins!! That’s going some..
---
I bet the beekeeper bot wasn’t part of that one 🙂
---
If you know it's not true, then don't speculate. If you weren't sure, then why are you upset that I confirmed the right answer for you?
---
to my understanding its time based. going from private server to private server you have a 5-10~ of being able to rejoin the same server.
---
So I went and tested it. See video below. The TS is doing more combined damage:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJ210fPJylM
---
Next time, for sure.
---
You have completed the quest, right?
---
Well yea, your games came from somewhere. Your generation didn’t just wake up with the technology needed to develop the games that are out today.
---
Back when I was a kid we had Arkanoid, Pong, Coleeco Vision with games like Turbo and Zaxxon. I mean I even had the first Nintendo. I think my dad bought my first computer in 1983. It was an IBM clone with a back up TAPE drive... VHS was a hot commodity and those eight tracks were just being replaced with cassettes.
---
In the mean time my first PC game was the very first Microsoft Flight Simulator; it was like looking at white chalk lines on a blackboard. Then we experienced real games like ZORK where you actually had to know how to read in order to finish the game.
---
My favorite games didn’t even come out until two years later with Sierra Online’s Kings Quest, Space Quest, and even the Police Quest series. They taught me how to type - and type fast - because if you didn’t then you would lose the game. It was fun times!
---
So yes I am older, 44 to be exact, but I have been gaming since the 80’s. 😉🤣🤙🏼
---
I know what you mean I’m a 38 yo female and I play with mostly adult and all but a few are people I’ve met in game and a few are now really good friends and I don t know what I’d do without them
---
Usually you get lucky and find something you can trade up until you're sitting on legacies or B2525 fixers. It takes time, patience, and luck.
---
It had Rudolph on the display and came with a stripper pole Christmas tree with mrs. Clause dancing on it...
---
Hey Gav. Thank you man. I found one. Sadly it’s still terrible since you can’t equip it with anything. 😃
---
Remember that the SBQ does call in all sorts of Scorched including Scorched Mirelurk Queen, Fog Crawlers, Mirelurk King, among many more. 
---
However, I do agree that something similar to the fear attack that the Wendigo Colossus has.
---
Try again. You have the capacity to use full sentences in English, based on your post history.
---
I don't know it's not true. That's why I used the word 'rumour'. Have you proof either way? You haven't confirmed anything without.
---
MG42
---
It depends on what you’re doing. CHA is an experience boost, and a cap boost when doing quests as a group.
---
With 4 players in a group, it’s +20% XP and Cap bonus at 4 players, per quest turn in, and if the group was working on dailies (let’s say all doing the same 3 dailies) its going to be +20% three times for every quest turned in.  I don’t know a lot of players who put more than about 4 points into CHA, so unless you are wearing unyielding you’re not likely hitting the charisma cap.  
---
So I can see Roleplaying being a great option for people who are going to be focusing on doing quests.  Events that pop up might not be ones you even feel like doing.
---
For top tier stuff, you need to basically get items of equivalent worth.  No one will trade a god rolled item for junk, but you can trade junk for lower level stuff and bundle items together to get mid level stuff.  Trading is a fun aspect to the game and it requires you to put a lot of time into it to really get what you want.  You will basically have to get lucky with a drop to get something you could trade for something like a bloody fixer with good rolls.  Always check player vendors, you can find some amazing stuff!
---
I understand you’re coming from a place of hurt and got fucked over real bad and I feel bad for you that it even happened but man, EVERYONE is capable of causing hurt and being shitty to their partner it’s not strictly a woman thing. 
---
I sincerely hope you process and move on from all this bad shit that bit you in the ass and you get a better outlook on women.
---
Do that 30 or 40 more times and you might get something you are looking for.  Maybe.
---
Or you get lucky and meet someone like me who hands out God roll weps because I'm bored and won't use them
---
They go together good with the urban/forest mask.
---
I got a pretty sweet zealots explosive -90% weight from her once. And that’s the only thing I’ve gotten that’s good...
---
Ok I never check player vendors Bc I kept seeing junk for sale.
---
IMO, the proletariat setting is the best for the communist collectrons because it gives you stimpacks, radaways, food, water. It’s great because it pretty much allows me to take off pharma farma in favour of some better combat-related luck perks
---
Flare grenades?
---
Yeah, find one of these guys. 
---
I'm not there yet but I'm not far off!
---
Something like that does not, and has never, existed in a Bethesda game. And if it was added to this game, dataminers would have found it by now. I can't prove a negative, so you'll just have to be satisfied with that answer.
---
It should be noted that the East Coast didn't have proper nation building post-apocalypse, and as such a weapons manufacturing faction like the Gun Runners never appeared to restore various old war weapons so everyone is using scavenged weapons (DC is basically just tribals pretending to be more advanced than they actually are). The more advanced machined weapons such as the 50 cal MG and Gatling Plasma thus break down with no way to repair or restore them due to the overall stupidity of the East Coast so they rust into scrap metal.
---
The Institute is arguably the only East Coast faction that actually produces new weaponry of any sort, but that's such a non-priority compared to their synth obsession that the weapons they create is half-assed, disposable crap (though their armor is dope).
---
Essentially, the East Coast is the very thing that Caesar's Legion runs into whenever they conquer territory; warring, simple tribes pretending to be civilized that get steamrolled by any real organized fighting force. The Lone Wanderer, Sole Survivor, and whatever title the FO76 protagonist has are essentially just their local versions of Lanius pre-Legion.
---
I only saw the bottom reply, I thought the top one was my original post.
---
You can still run Ballistic heavy guns. I’m using Batteries Included just because I’m going to use a Gauss Mini once I get the right roll and the cartridges and Fusion Cores weigh a lot.
---
The legendary effects on guns can substantially increase your damage. The biggest pain about the Fallout games is high level enemies just turn into absolute bullet sponges.
---
As far as legendary effects your only real choice are Junkies or Bloody. 
---
Junkies will increase weapon damage up to 50% as after 5 addictions it caps out. 
---
Bloody increases weapon damage based on your missing HP and I don’t remember what that % is but you can also get the Adrenal Reaction mutation (45% weapon damage at low HP) which stacks with a Bloody gun.
---
So, you need to work on getting guns with those effects first, and then worry about getting a 3 star roll.
---
You do want a backpack because your backpack bonus still counts in PA as well as the extra carry weight.
---
You don’t need Good with Salt or the Grocer mod I just recommend those because I hate running back and forth to my camp for food. It’s basically only weight management I mainstay on all my characters because I do use some of the hourlong food buffs as well hence the perk card.
---
And no, heavy weapons aren’t great at lower levels so you may have to do some respeccing after 50.
---
I don’t run around in PA all the time to save Fusion Cores, and once you get a build situated or mostly working you’ll understand that. Being bloodied, I wear unyielding for the bonuses while I’m out of PA but you could just as well have a Vanguard set to better protect you while you’re not in PA either.
---
When you do a character it’s a good thing to know what you want in advance as it helps minimizes the amount of levels you have to earn to correct earlier mistakes.
---
I updated my melee toon last month and thank god for the double XP weekend cause she needed like 35 levels.
---
My husband used to be a gamer with me but then he became Chad.
---
&gt;The RNG of Murgh, ~~sometimes~~ 99% of the time she hates you, but on rare occasions she gives you love.
---
There, I fixed it for you.
---
That is so cute! Thank you for sharing! Ugh my parter sleeps one a different schedule so it’s usually just my goofball self finding enemies or them finding me... I’ve been called scorchbeast bait lately by a buddy lol 
---
My partner and I have been playing RE7 together, same time different screen it’s been really fun! I whipped through a fight before he did. My stubborn self wasn’t going down with that fight.
---
Works for me! Thank you.
---
I run this combo also. And the forest scout with guilie hat.
---
I try to help out as many as I can, like a neighborhood bad santa.
---
Built a camp at Lake Brahmin (or that spot southeast of Pleasant Valley where a trio just hang out and kill themselves via rad damage from the water), built a concrete flooring and fencing to save those 3 cows, added by own brahmin, and server hop for milk production. The amount gained still sucks though.
---
¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Geborstener Stahl passt. Bersten = mit gewalt auseinanderreissen. Brushed Steel = Gebürsteter Stahl.
---
Yes give me a shared stash and allow us to also transfer items that aren't trade-able like the gold bullion stuff so I can trade the legendary rolls onto the right character.
---
I can't get my scout mask to stay on with my ghillie suit
---
Check camp vendors too, I bought a mole miner gauntlet with the exact roll I wanted last week. I’m not even worried about crafting Gauntlets anymore cause it this does more damage AND I have a skin to put on it so I don’t accidentally scrip it
---
When patch 20 hits.
---
Really? That what my guy is wearing now. Looks cool.
---
Maybe it's coincidence, but I've noticed that if I keep a weapon type that I want in my inventory for a while, they tend to drop more often.
---
I switch between 5, differently built characters to do ridiculous things that only they can do as they're built. It's fun to switch to a tribal weapon wielding savage when you get bored of being a lead spitting gunner, or an explosives maniac that literally can't live without Fireproof + Dense by virtue of accidental suicide. Also build all of their camps differently depending on the character theme.
---
Tent + simple bare necessitates for the tribal, a junk extracting facility with a naked ally with a slave collar for the evil maniac, and a restaurant selling non-perishable cooked items and Biv's booze recipes for the gunslinger with a Faschnact obsession.
---
After reject quest play time yesterday, it reset today  ..received instruction to investigate Berkley Springs, ..yes,, Play Time again...survived the quest in Harpers Ferry, returned to Chloe, was told to go away, and quest completed, scrips and rewards. PS4.
---
Since they pulled out content to get the patch out, and they said nothing today I’m guessing June 30, maybe july 7 at latest.
---
They’ve used up all atom shop datamined from patch 19 (except the prefab red rocket, which is bugged) so that usually means a new patch is close.
---
do we have an estimate ? like june or july? :)
---
You’re comment made me smile👍
---
Hey. I have three. You can have them.
---
"Geborstener Stahl" wäre "burst steel" wenn ich das richtig im Kopf habe. Aber im Grunde passt es so.
---
Nope. They are not said a thing in the new Inside the vault.
---
If it's an instance, no, not until the instance resets. Things like junk will respawn when the cell is empty after a set amount of time, and things like berries and food in the wild can be claimed by more than one person.
---
If you have no trigger discipline, maybe.  It is generally pretty ammo efficient.
---
Care to enlighten me ?
---
Vault 79 is clearly not endgame, it's the gateway to the new currency. It wasn't designed as a challenge for completed builds, it's designed for level 50s.
---
New equipment and the Wendigo Colossus are the endgame additions.
---
Anyone interested in adventure pvp on PS4 add Fruitstripe145
---
I think you need to hoard less and sell some stuff bud.
---
For junk, bulk and sell, you dont need 40k steel and 10k gears or screws, and you most likely don't need any cork or ceramic, so sell all or most of it. It will take some time, but clear what you have no intention of using out. I cleared out about 300-350lbs by getting rid of junk that my weapons/armor didn't need for mods or repairs, and that I couldn't sell for more in a camp vendor (like screws and gears)
---
The perks that affect item weight should affect the storage if they don't. I thought they did but I could be wrong.
---
The weight limits are not going anywhere, especially for scrap, since thats one of the major selling points of FO1st.
---
You really named yours "my bloods in it"?
---
Another player invited me to a team and was doing this inside the cricket cave at tanagra town and I didn't know what was triggering the spawns. Good to know!
---
You shouldn't be running any farming perks all the time.
---
Ja das wär "bursted steel". Diesmal haben sie den google translator offenbar nicht benützt.
---
You legend, my GT is lewilewi41 I'm online now.
---
no thanks, dont wanna get anymore downvotes haha. i would google it if you actually care to know.
---
I'm betting it will probably be another 2 - 3 weeks away at this point...but they could surprise us.
---
Only happens with the final mission for the Commander, if your camp is in the forrest you will get the level 20 version. If it is in a high level zone like mire or cranberry bog, you get the level 50 one.
---
I had the same thing happen to me but I lost WAY more. I lost 3 legacies and about 300k worth off other legendaries, plans and meds. It was at that time I got fo1st so I wouldn’t have to rely on a friend to stay on their private server. Took me a few days to get over it. Hell I am still upset about it.
---
Yuppers and it sells exceedingly well too 🤣
---
I think I'd still rather have 100% event XP. Almost all the dailies except the ones from WL are classed as events, so the net benefit is still better I would think?
---
Oh yeah definitely. I've got a plain Jane fixer and I hate it because it's so weak compared to all my legendaries
---
This might be neither here nor there but the current lineup for today's IGN summer of gaming stream doesn't have anything for today (or any day) with Bethesda or Fallout or Wastelanders or the DLC roadmap or anything.
---
https://www.ign.com/articles/summer-of-gaming-event-schedule-how-to-watch-lineup
---
I think it's probably been cancelled

Thanks for the idea, going to swap between this and the mothman goggles.
---
interesting points
---
You will find primarily junk, it’s just a different type of legendary farm, but occasionally you will see an amazing deal.  Same as hunting legendaries, almost always a garbage roll, but every so often you’ll get something worth keeping or trading.  Playing the game for 18 or so months I got one god tier drop and a handful of “decent” quality items.
---
Well...at least it's free if that's any consolation.  I see what you mean though. I have the opposite experience with it but that's also because of very limited time I have for gaming each day which sucks but hey ,better than no gaming :)
---
Thank you so much for your reply!
---
And then start looking for cave crickets, snallygasters, and yao guai for acid. If you can, also take the Hemlock Holes workshop and get the three acid extractors running there. You'll need a hell of a lot of acid to smelt all the lead ore you'll need to be collecting to keep up with the LMG's hunger.
---
Yh you can grab the plan from Foundation for gold
---
Awesome.
---
You have evidence to all of that?
---
Yeah I missed out on the plague armor, looked perfect for Nurgle roleplaying too. So many options
---
It was August last year I think
---
If they allowed custom skins you'd be getting beat to death by someone wielding a giant penis.
---
That's why we can't have nice things.
---
Will do
---
Did you have to glitch it?
---
*facepalms* Karen, don't let that guy join the making department...
---
This game on console becomes unplayable at points. I can never use a full auto rifle build because sustained fire makes my frames plummet.
---
When I try to weapon swap sometimes it’ll be a good 3-5 seconds before the weapon actually comes out, during which a then-20ft away charred feral ghoul has now replaced half my hp bar with rads by the time the swap finishes
---
Sons of Dane is a decent rare hat spawn when you walk inside the bar area where you play the instruments. it should be on the middle table on the right. I had a red Asylum worker hat spawn there yesterday which is supposedly pretty rare.
---
My mom has the same reaction to wendigos. She wasn't expecting one when finishing up Buried Treasure. 
---
All I hear from the other end of the house are shrieks of terror and she ends up butchering the wendigo anyway.
---
Because I play the game differently that you. I enjoy exploring, for example. I still am finding unique parts of the map I haven’t seen before. There are still some notes I’ve found in the middle of nowhere that Are clues to something but I haven’t found out what yet (and no resources online know either). The game i more than just running the same events over and over again and fast traveling everywhere. It’s not for everyone, but I enjoy it. It’s relaxing to me.
---
And on top of that, Jesus is one thing but no one names their son Christ. That's a very specific person
---
No. I just put 1 on then the other.
---
If you have pacifist on you cant end up in PVP unless its workshops, you being wanted, or being part of a team and your team mate starting a fight with someone
---
I’m sub lvl 50, I don’t have any other perks to run at the moment
---
So instead of running pharma farma, I’m running some random luck perk I got from a pack that helps a bit more in a fight
---
And the slocums joe bundle wich is supposedly coming next Tuesday
---
People can play whichever way they want.
---
I believe I still have them.  If no one else gets to you before I get home, then I will let you know (they've been in my vending machine, so I don't know what is left).
---
team goals = brilliant!
---
altering the pvp rules also shows them really thinking about the experience for players and how these new systems will interact with each other.
---
this is all good news, keep up the good work! \[heart, thumbs up, heart, mothman dance\]
---
It’s been a long time since I’ve even bothered with a group - but I know I have earned rewards from helping others with quests in the past.  I’ll have to test it this weekend with my buddy to see how it’s actually working and what counts as what.  I think that’s more of an issue with the classifications of the quests though, if they were properly classified.
---
Of course in any case you can just switch I guess.. start the group up as whatever to earn XP, then go do the quests, and switch at the end (waiting for the bond to reform to get the bonus for turn ins..
---
did they ? i cant remember, you might be right, it's either we cant earn anymore from dailies or we get a reduced amount from a similar source
---
Some people just want to watch the world burn.
---
Presumably, you create a public team to attract people to build with you, then once you've vetted them you can change it to private (which would allow them to build).
---
Your tears.
---
thatd actually be like a cool team goal.  hunter/hunted gang warfare!
---
With my first actual good legendary I got from scorch beast queen, bloodied gatling laser with the faster reload and faster fire rate thrown on it.
---
Sometimes stupidity knows no bounds.
---
I’ve seen a sheepsquatch take out two Yao guai and and a gang of high leveled Blood Eagles. I waited till it took out everything before jumping in and finish it off.
---
Did you use the camp budget exploit in the past?
---
A lot of that has to do with the fact that there also wasn't really any successful control vaults given GECKs on the East Coast as far as we've seen so far. There 'was' a GECK that we basically squander in Fallout 3, with the whole small minds idea of just using it to purify the water, rather than restore the entirety of the local ecosystem along with the water. Of course that GECK was also stuck in a highly irradiated, and nuked, Vault. I'd imagine that if there was at least one vault on the East Coast given a working GECK that was in a control vault, we'd likely see things similar to the NCR popping up there. Its also good to note that the East Coast likely was hit significantly harder than the West Coast was, due to Washington DC and many major military and political locations being on the East Coast. So there was likely a lot less survivors outside of the vaults on top of all the other issues.
---
X-01 has the best rad resist, t-60 is better vs ballistic than t51 whereas t51 is better against energy, ultracite is just kinda the middle man between all of them
---
the differences between all the sets are pretty miniscule though, I wear ultracite cause I think it looks coolest
---
I have somewhere close to 100 fedoras and have only got the plan a few times  (I'm trying to fill up 4 vendors with fedoras on the character that I use for encryptid) 😅
---
I was hoping to see some more information on this myself.
---
Jester being the most common mask is fitting. Bethesda thinks valuing our time is a joke and they enjoy laughing at us. 
---
8.6 million masks? Tell me again how too many items in game is bad for the servers, keep making excuses why you can't increase limits in aspects of the game.
---
It's a super rare drop.
---
Cool, you should support us anyways. Most players want varied gameplay experiences, and they want it in the form of raids and new events. This isn't too much to ask for, as you seemed to imply in your earlier comments.
---
Finding one new note every 20hrs of gameplay isnt going to get me to want to aimlessly wander around. I'm happy to replay the same Firefight map multiple times because that game has tight, fun gameplay that is fun with replay. But Fallout 76? Scorched Earth only gets ya so far. And nuke zones dont even spawn that many enemies, it's kinda absurd how wasted that is as an opportunity to really throw all the cool mobs at the player. We're expected to grind daily for a shot at a decent roll of a legendary gun/armor, but to what end? Without challenging and replayable events to use them in, it's pointless. Daily Ops and Expeditions are 4-6 months away and who knows if they'll be any better than the vault raid they shut down. 
---
And you can wander/explore in Fallout 4 too, what makes this game (supposedly) unique in replayability is the events and new content, but lately they've fizzled out in their attempts. The raid is closed and the new repeatable content (daily quests and Riding Shotgun) are super boring.
---
Bulk lead and aluminium to reduce weight. Keep an eye on things you have a lot of but don't use. I constantly throw wood acid steel and cloth away because they like up
---
I wear the leather coat with the guilie hat and forest scout mask.
---
As is said in the other post, only keep what you need at the time....if you don't need it, don't pick it up.
---
Bad net, too many high prim items in one tiny area, etc.
---
I'd like a visitor's book, where people can leave a brief note when they visit.
---
You'll run into mostly good folk when playing 76, in my experience. Though you will of course run into some people who just want to ruin everyone else's fun. I always run with pacifist mode on, and if I run into a real pita, I just session block them. Though to be fair these days I don't often go onto the public worlds unless I'm trying to find a specific legendary to buy from someone, or some plans that I'm looking for.
---
Next time don't accept a fight at your base, and only accept after your junk is stashed
---
I think it's been cancelled. If you look at today's lineup there's nothing there for today or any day for Fallout, Wastelanders or a DLC roadmap.
---
So do Bulk items actually weigh less? I just thought bulking them was for the sole purpose of being able to sell them for caps. And yeah do, but it's after every quest that I have to do it and it just takes up a lot of time, I'd love to have to not do it at all
---
He was playing the game as intended. You fought back.
---
I want to see one fight the imposter to see who wins.
---
Players should get the travel fee when others visit their camp. There is no logical reason why there is a sales tax when something is sold. We shouldn't have to adjust the price and make the buyer pay the tax just so we can get what we want for an item. Stop creating useless cap sinks.
---
I just looked it up, no but I am at max budget and the vendors  are on the first floor right near where you load in :( 
---
Some scumbag probably took it all
---
There were literal deities in that game, two of which had a server-wide event battle in Lesser Faydark at a certain point in the game's life cycle. That's really insane. Meanwhile I had a shadowknight named Daeth for ages, and when I finally decided to go for a last name, neither Wish nor Wysh would take. One petition later a GM told me I couldn't have it for... reasons. And then started hinting my character's name was already against the TOS. Whatever, I ended up going with Daeth Bites out of spite and that stuck for years before I ended up server-merged and Daethx just doesn't have the same ring to it. Thankfully a GM let me wipe the last name and get a different first name.
---
Oh man.....yeah, I'd move your spawn point ASAP (you can do that my moving your camp device).
---
I do have a bad habit of picking up junk when I already have a lot of crafting materials, I guess that's probably the main problem here
---
In comes the patch ruining it for everyone.
---
It was just there this morning too. I believe it was right above the gameplay for Remnant.
---
Coffee machine?
---
General rule of thumb is to have no more than 100 of each junk item in your stash. At least, that was the rule of thumb before the scrap box became a thing. Since the stash hasn’t increased since then, I’d say it’s still a good thing to follow.
---
What?
---
Yeah but only lead and aluminium for some reason. Other than that it's just scrap everything and try manage it. Now I'm high level I try just keep the stuff I'll need like repairs or power armour mods
---
Yeah it’s been cancelled because it was there when I checked 2 hours ago. It was supposed to be a trailer if I remember correctly.
---
I was a hoarder for a very, very long time. Took quite a bit to break the habit.
---
Not having an official mechanism to share items between characters isn't actually stopping it. They really ought to just give us a tool to do it.
---
It's a bug that people can exploit to not waste tons of hours farming Whitespring like the old days. Of course they will want to fix it. They only care about making people log in every day and this gives them one less way to force people to do that.
---
Reminds me that I'm still two T-51b plans away from being able to start making full suits of the armor for people. I have the Nuka Cola paint job learned and whatnot already. Just need two pieces of the armor proper and I'll be starting to Power Armor Fairy people.
---
How can you have 850 in you stash when your stash can only hold 800lb and a stim is one pound each.
---
UM. One *slight* problem with your math... for that to be accurate, those 25,733 players would have needed to play the event *every* time it was available, without ever taking breaks to eat, sleep, go to work, or anything else. And I know for a fact *I* didn't do that - I personally didn't get more than a dozen masks, which isn't even close to the 336 I would've needed to get to match your numbers.
---
Also, it just says "masks"... does that mean *just* masks, or does it include things like the beret, too?
---
Thanks for sharing. FYI when you inspect them you should select the equip the gun first, otherwise the damage numbers may seem off.
---
No idea how TS seems to be doing more damage (when both shots hit). It almost seems like the first shot Is getting more than 2.5x boost when in sneak. 
---
I have no idea but appreciate you uploading the video. Maybe someone else can chime in here.
---
One does not simply count bullets when unleashing a 50 cal on a scorchbeast!
---
Or maybe I just watched too much Rambo as  a kid..
---
:D
---
In fairness I'm from aus/UK and had no idea either. It's safe to Google and is a racist derogatory term predominantly used in the US.
---
Thats very sad
---
You throw Acid away? Yikes!
---
Slocum Joe's Coffee machine... makes coffee, coffee is like AP super juice
---
It’s one of the many issues Bethesda still hasn’t fixed yet, like item previews in trade windows.
---
You mean flying around for 25 mins and never landing so you can't complete the event isn't frightening enough? Lol
---
Whitesprings usually has some legendaries, sometimes 4 on a single run. I also find some weird legendaries, like bone weapons, in cranberry bog groves
---
I'm offended by the tasty, tasty luncheon meat! /S /drools
---
Yeah it was there this morning :-(
---
We know it is “intended” that you can destroy a base followed by letting your friend kill you to remove wanted while losing no caps. We know it is “intended” that the guy whose house just got demolished shoulders the entire cost. 
---
The rest of us know it is bullshit. Room aboard our train if you’d like to join the Sanity Express.
---
No, (and that would probably be pay to win content). It‘s a datamined furniture bundle kind of like the red rocket one we got last week.
---
Adding a new map in something like COD or halo is completely different than adding a whole new quest or area of the map in this game where you can interact with almost every single object in the world. You are comparing apples to oranges. 
---
And I found FO4 very stale to explore after about 150 hours. I don’t know why this game is different, but for me it is. 
---
Yes the cake could benefit from more replay-able content, but I personally just don’t enjoy doing events over and over again and grinding for gear. It’s not my preference. I will advocate for what I enjoy and you can advocate for what you enjoy. OP is asking for new events weekly though and that really is unreasonable and would take away resources from bigger improvements IMO.
---
I stumbled upon a trap camp that was using the exploit to put it under the road. I knew something was up when I saw the sign and the owner standing there. I played the bass sticking out of the road, fell down the hole but moved out of the way of the pressure plate but I still died somehow. Second attempt, I made it out of the trap and almost got to the vendors but somehow still died. I voiced my displeasure about his shitty trap camp and left. He shows up in an event that I was doing but he brought his buddy along to fight his fight for him. He was being such a badass tough guy that he was shooting me while I was in pacifist mode, so scary!! I could barely hear him as it sounded like he was using a dollar store mic, he was jealous or something about my Fixer and was calling it garbage. Whatever, I just blocked them, reported them for harassment and using exploits and went on with my life. I hope Bethesda enjoyed the video of his exploit camp and their harassment.
---
The event completes and they decided to teach me a lesson by going to my camp and buying everything in my vendor. I made almost 12k caps. That really showed me, oh boy! They were probably hoping I was close to the cap limit but I had like 11k on me so they actually made my day better. Best trap camp ever as it gained me almost 12k caps. He even showed me how much of an edgelord he was by leaving me a "Your the Dumbass" note in a bag on my porch. I guess I'm a dumbass for earning 12k caps. So salty! Thanks buddy!
---
Didn't know names with religious overtones was a issue. Good to know.
---
Yeah, my first suggestion would be to fix the pathing on the SBQ so that she ignores the fact players are not standing directly on the ground.  That way she lands more often, and calls reinforcements more often.  The more she does it, the more powerful the mobs seem to get.
---
Mine works juust fine! Its all about dem mods, dem mods.
---
I’ll sell your 11 for 1500 caps
---
It's just luck. They appear randomly at some Vendor Bots, or PA Plan/Mod Spawns. Watoga is usually a good shout, two bots, several spawns. Also try the BoS Camps dotted around the Bog, and Fort Defiance. Unfortunately there's no Plans either.
---
Thank you just let me know when you are free
---
It's _possible_ it's been lumped in with a nondescript 2 pm (Pacific time) IGN stream of trailers, demos and interviews but there's no longer a standalone Fallout 76 DLC Roadmap _event_ as was first posted a couple of weeks ago (and I think was there until today).
---
Only if it piles up, then I'll give half to a friend or leave it by whitesprings station. As a melee main I barely need anything now lol
---
Also there should be a camp rating system where you can rate the camp on a 1 to 5 star system. This would also give you an idea which camps you already visited on the map.
---
Sit down. OP fought back, they cant damage your Camp otherwise.
---
patchie or no? 
---
WHERE IS THE FUCKING UPDATE
---
Ahh so it does exist, I was starting to wonder if it were just red tactical. Thanks for the info I'll give those places a try
---
Right after fasnatch when the vendors went back up. I found quite a few fantastic guns that people saved up. I have quite a few solid Bloodied weapons to choose from now. Nothing like a fixer, but assault rifles and lever actions I use often.
---
I have a bloodied 33% vats gatling gun. It hits like a truck and with unyielding and my base 3 perception it's basically a vats heavy sniper rifle that runs on the cheapest ammo in the game.
---
Lol the “free” updates kinda kills me lol imo most of this stuff shoulda been in at launch but w.e hahaha but I hear u lol in all fairness me n bro we’re both laid off at the same time so it was easy to crush it in a week. Probly best you keep going at ur pace, enjoy the game before it turns into the repetitive grind
---
Derogatory term for people of color.  Comes from comments about slaves singing "like crickets" at night.
---
Yes, I've heard it has something to do with the animation of attacks, the game won't do that *and* use a stimpack at the same time. The only spammable heal I've found that can be used regardless of attack actions is Healing Salve, but the heal is so small at high level it's easier for me to just hold off on a left-click (weapon attack / gunshot) for just long enough to get stimpacks to take... nevermind that how long *that* is, feels more random than it probably should. Could be server lag also mucks with this situation.
---
Quick question.  If I open my own server I can switch characters but stay on same server and then run to wherever my main account hid stuff and the new account can grab it?
---
I thought you might be melee! I cant get enough Acid! Aciiiiiiiiid!
---
This is an issue on PC and has been since roughly Wastelander's debut. (Edit: Bethesda launcher, not Steam for me.)
---
I think red rocket and the power stations are worth taking for fusion cores. That being said you can farm them pretty quickly and most people do that in a private server to avoid PVP.
---
I had that same problem. That mission is more of a one off but it’s good practice to get up to level 20/30 before.
---
Right?! Although knowing these servers it would just queue up the lag as well where if you craft 10 things there will be 10 seconds of lag afterwards.
---
Mods
---
No problem! Purple is pretty cool, but that and Blue are quite dim to be honest. Red all the way! HeHe. Plus, makes your PA eyes red on some types.
---
Very true. 
---
I scrapped a hunters cost like 6 months ago and havent been the same since aha.
---
Now I hoard all the rare ones, but I'm nice and hooked my buddy up with a scout mask.
---
I'd say the one I grinded the hardest for was the blue ridge outfit. Hat, outfit, bag and flag.
---
Still probably the nicest looking in my opinion.
---
Remember some of the rare outfits look super weird and to
---
Always share the nice drops with the guys 🥳
---
No need to be uncivil. 
---
Why are you expecting Patch 20 to drop today?  Was it cited by Bethesda to release today?
---
The miner helmets and hats have working lights that work the same as PA headlamps and can be mixed got different types of light, been using that ever since I realised!
---
Oooo! Where did you guys find it? My boyfriend and I looked all over the place for one last weekend and couldn't find it
---
Lifegiver
---
Hell, I'm in the US and old and grew up around racists and I have never heard this term at all.
---
I live in the upper gulf coast of Texas around rednecks pretty much all the time and I have never heard this. I'd be curious to know just what part of the country is this supposed to be a slang term.
---
I call bs
---
this! this almost exactly happened to me the other day. my fiancé and i were in the middle of playing when i had to take my dog outside. 2 minutes after i walk out, i get a phone call. it’s him and he’s screaming “GET BACK INSIDE GET BACK INSIDE!” i thought he hurt himself, but no he just really wanted me to see the scorched mothman, and kill it with him
---
Mommy likes her salami xD
---
Ty yeah that green hood spawns there quite a bit.
---
It has been removed from the list. Wtf.
---
No, it was supposed to go live sometime this week, so i thought i would ask the wonderful fallout 76 community if they know the current location and situation of the patchie. 
---
I'm going on hunger strike until it releases.
---
Only 1 pizza for dinner instead of 2
---
Be sure to check your local stations. The acid fairy may have been
---
Ah, but do you think it's actually going to **work** that way? I'm very new to Fallout 76 but even just in my short time I've seen some pretty big issues. Even smaller ones seemed pretty weird, like my turrets fighting with my ally.
---
And I've heard/read about some of the past big ones (Private stash accessible through public vending machines?). 
---
So... bets on whether or not public teammates can ruin/deface camps at launch of Update 20? :-)
---
Overgrown Sundew Grove in a nuke zone of course. I think it was sheer luck but I'm glad for it.
---
Isn't that what this is? I have no real plans to be joined at the hip in these public teams.
---
I have less than 50 of almost all scrap in my stash, as everything except emergency scrap is on my person (...I'm scared of reaching &lt;30 scrap because the asshole system will scrip my valuables). 5 of each flux in the stash, rest on me. I think all aid is on me, too, maybe a couple of items in stash/vendor. Ammo is all on me except some low weight stuff to sell. Weapons in storage are mostly 90% WR or light stuff, the rest I got on me because perks. Armor may be an issue because I got no perk for that, but generally I don't put heavy shit in stash.
---
As the better inventory mod doesn't work on stash I don't know, but I expect a good portion of my stuff being outfits (btw, all fastnacht stuff is still on me). That, a couple of rare junk items, and leftover low weight legendary shit from fastnacht is basically all I've got in there.

I'd get rid of many legendary items, but, you know, scrip limits and no sensible trading interface whatsoever. So I'm currently just waiting for scrip reset to scrap a couple of &lt;1 to 5lb items, although some I'd rather want to trade - haven't bothered a courier yet, but I assume I have to for some (almost)god rolls.
---
I've got the red ranger on my t60 and the eyes go blue whichever colour it actually gives out so I just wanted it to match, my x01 is mothman which the mothman red light you get it looks so good!
---
I have an older laptop with an i7 and a 770nvidia which barely runs 76, good enough to do item transfers.  Definitely be easier to just transfer between toons lol.  Haven’t tried to power level or anything.
---
Ps found it at vendorbot Phoenix first try!
---
that was shortly before he got cut in half and the kid he said it about went on to become the scourge of the universe, but sure a very wise jedi
---
i put up a sign in my CAMP that i'd buy/trade for the plans. a couple days later i find someone selling a level 50 for 2000c, just said fuck it, and bought it.
---
Damn so sounds to me like everyone just wants god tier stuff in the game handed to them... I'll take stuff like this all day everyday
---
Well, I semi-recently got a level 50 explosive 10mm that I handed to my gunslinger as something a little more lulzy to use on low-level mobs. Shortly thereafter I discovered the damage on it was so bad, his old plain level 50 10mm was more effective. One would think the base damage of the gun should remain the same and *then* add a little on top for the explosive affix, but that would not seem the case. I'm not sure that info is useful in your case, especially if something got patched very recently, but that's been my experience with explosive weapons lately. O.o

That's interesting. It does not match up with everything I have seen about 2 shot. I have a 2 shot gauss rifle I could test against a base gauss rifle. I will try and check it out tonight when I get on.
---
Its also interesting that the second shot is 50% of the first. I wonder if this is true for non-stealth shots as well.
---
Yes I use the suitcases at train station just put what you want In leave come back with different toon and get from same suitcase
---
You can switch characters on same account but a different account would have different server
---
Oh no the precious upvotes ):
---
Lmao
---
When you start going east into the savage divide enemies scale to players in the area and aren't locked, so if a higher level ran through before you you'll find the enemies alot higher levels. I would suggest you slow down and don't try to smash through the story. Take your time and play events and stuff to level up before you start venturing east.
---
A release date or even week has never been given by Bethesda. Even as recently as two days ago, the reputable game news media were reporting that, according to a simple Google search. 
---
Anyone that made the educated guess of ‘this week’ was just guessing based on past history.
---
**There has not been any official release date provided for Update 20 by Bethesda.**
---
Nice! She's probably climbed inside to explore as well!
---
Quick google search and I can see why someone would report that nickname MAYBE.
---
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salam
---
Could also be that "Salam" got its way to the banlist and a bot flag your nickname up.
---
But it's definitely the "Salam" part of the nick, not "Salami" nor "Mommy"
---
No way! Nice one bud that's quality!!
---
Of course with 'seasons' non of these issues will ever happen..
---
Put as much in your vendor as you can, it’ll get sold. As someone with caps burning a hole in my pocket and having 1st, I’m always searching for junk to purchase and throw in the box. This way you’re not wasting plastic for bulking to sell to NPC vendors, since bulking only reduces weight for aluminum and lead
---
True. The group I play with try to farm OVN for as much as possible, but we still complete the event. My 300+ character can gain over 1/2 a level from that one event. I have no suggestions on what to do about other a-hole players, other than play on a private server if possible.
---
One per legendary no matter how many stars or what it's named unfortunately.  You'd think killing the SBQ would be at least worth 2 since that's part of the last step, right?  🤦‍♂️
---
It is much, much easier just to do the enclave events for the commendations. Imho the enclave events are more fun than farming legendaries too.
---
damn...
---
I enjoyed the raid but you can tell its more focused on getting people who aren't max level to be able to complete it to move onto the newer endgame grind of farming gold.
---
The Burrows will spawn glowing ghouls but you won't get any irradiated materials from them because there isn't any radiation underground. It's not a bad spot for farming but only the Harper's will have irradiated materials.
---
Just use nukacrypt for the weekly codes check it out no need to hunt them down just need the keycard and good to go
---
I bet some woke intern saw your mom's username and was like" this is  derogatory towards mothers because it implies that they're shoving pepperonis up their puss i shall put an end to this" And everybody in the office clapped and gave themselves a tap and the back.
---
Yeah 🤔
---
In all fairness though, what's good is subjective to the player. All of those pieces would be scrip to me too, or something to sell. I'm not a bloodied player, so bloodied, unyielding, and bolstering do nothing for me.  My main weapon is an instigating lever action with 33 vats. Ideally I'll find that with a third star. But vanguards is really the only armor for me.
---
Yes Alpha to Alpha, etc...

and if you want thae codes without the tedious collection nonsense they are here:

[edit: reset every week*]
---
I haven’t heard that one in a long time. 
---
It’s amazing how the context we artificially add to words can have such lasting impact.
---
I grew up in Brightmoor right outside Detroit. just because people dont say it all the time doesnt mean it doesnt exist.
---
yeah I think they're trying to make it so its less random out of the way shit that gives you atoms and more from just normal playing
---
The reason it feels empty is because it is, because it was thoroughly tested and found distinctly lacking, so they pulled stuff out. That's a triumph, man would you have bitched if it was released as was/partially tested. :-)
---
You could just not read the threads talking about the unreleased features?  What am I not getting...
---
That is awesome!
---
Good try Todd,
---
I guess my hunger strike shall continue until patchie arrives.
---
&gt;Your account security is something we take very seriously
---
Not that seriously given its taken close to 2 years to implement such a standard feature, let alone the basic hack where your account could be compromised by using a specific URL without the need of knowing someone's password.
---
You can always *not* read the articles or watch the videos.
---
not looking forward to posts from all the people who get kicked out being butthurt over it...
---
you are trying to progress too fast.  Slow down and enjoy the scenery.  Learn the lore.  follow the overseers quest line.
---
Roses initial quest (the one you are trying to do now) will quickly take you to areas you are no prepared to be.  Back burner it and revisit it later.
---
Stay in the forest until about L15 or 20.  Work on the mysteries quest, the firebreathers quest, and start the BoS quest (at camp mcclintock).  I dont remember where the responders quest starts.
---
Between 15 and 20, head to the toxic valley and start the Pioneer scouts quest.  At 30, head to the ash heap and start the Miner Miracles quest (for excavator armor).
---
At 40, head into the wester side of the divide.  At 45, the eastern side of the divide and beyond.
---
A little bit of both I think
---
And if we’re kept in the dark about it, and they still delay the things that need more work, we’d still have people comparing about it being empty *and* not getting a warning. At least this way you know what to expect when the update comes out.
---
just means im rubbin someone the wrong way and that is not my intention.
---
I could, what I cant is stop YouTube comments, my friends comments, pictures and titles on Reddit
---
I'd like to think most people were not doing it 24/7. The group I play with was only doing 1 or 2 per night towards the end.
---
I believe the Public Test Server was a bone given to the community with the big changes coming with seasons - in the future, expect that the PTS will be private again.
---
I appreciate the offer but unfortunately I'm an Xbox guy.
---
You are a sad, strange little man and you have my pity. Farewell.
---
If you need Violet Flux, you can't go wrong with Harpers Ferry - lots of Ferns to irradiate.
---
I want it tested, just not on YouTube
---
The T-60 has lower DR and ER than the T-51.

Easy-peasy...just FT from fissure site to fissure site, doesn't take long at all.
---
Thank you for the advice
---
Griefers are the most miserable bastards in gaming.
---
Holy fucking Todd, it actually worked!! Hahaha I guess that's my luck for the next 76 hours
---
you should be able to sell bulk acid at 45 caps per all day long.
---
Definitely gonna try this. Thanks for the tip
---
You should probably contact IT about your device’s inability to be turned off and put down.
---
Hope so!
---
lots to do in the forest, toxic valley and ash heap in order to be prepared to not get your ass handed to you in the savage divide and eastward....
---
you need more levels (better perks) and decent gear before you go walking around like 1wasteland has already dropped...
---
Link to the quote?
---
So to avoid spoilers I should return to the 90s is that it?
---
There are also three brahmin that hang out in the forested area of Flatwoods
---
The main quest isn't meant to be a speed run. I would recommend getting to level 25 or higher before venturing into the Savage Divide.
---
I know, but they are disgusting imo. Just give me an oil lamp that I can carry around.. just something better than the pip-boy green light
---
I had 850 on my person with the traveling pharmacy perk. It wouldn't fit in my stash box itself.
---
Yup, common problem.  Their game can't even track the most basic things.  You can try doing it with a different character, but no guarantee that works either.
---
NP.  
---
That will keep you in more or less level appropriate areas and enemies.  There's enough to do in each area, and those quests will keep you occupied for a good while :)
---
It's kind of sad this is what people have to do to get actual customer support.
---
Hahaha good for him.
---
Ahhh i got you Todd!
---
Please add text chat to the game.
---
Other than TSE and gauss energies
---
Oh ok. So it was stolen from your inventory not your stash.
---
I mean it's common enough to be able to show up as a bunch of search results and no one should have to see language which is derogatory like that. Might mean nothing to me but I can respect it feels bad to other people.

I really fucked up with introducing my wife to Fallout. She sat with me while I played through the intro of FO3 and the whole time she narrated the opening scenes in relation to her fears. For context we were pregnant with our first kid so anxiety was high already. 
---
“Oh god, what are they doing with that baby? WHERE IS THE BABY GOING? Oh my god. Oh no no no no. Fuck this game”
---
She loves the looting aspect of it but it’s a bit too scary for her.
---
Not worth it, none of the related mutations are in my utterly biased opinion. I found I spent too much time trying to farm diseases when I had it, and the fact that you can't cure diseases *at all* really sucks (especially if you are a VATS build or prone to getting heavy a lot, and get something like Sludge Lung). Unstable Isotope and Electrically Charged will mess up a bloodied build bad too, though Plague Walker wouldn't affect that as far as I know (though as someone else here noted, it would mess with instigating weapons). Better to just not do any of those and not regret later that you might have to redo all your mutations just to get rid of it (happened to my punchygirl, heck I've redone most of her mutations *twice* now due to poor mutation choices).
---
I believe those codes change on a Tuesday evening right around 8:00 p.m. so you probably don't want to launch at that time.
---
That's a game changer. Cook build incomming!
---
Fasnacht completed in 9 minutes? Damn. My best was 9:55. You have to get Candlewax, Decorations, Intestines, Steins and Wood to even have a chance. Start with everything collected and go Steins -&gt; Wood -&gt; Candlewax -&gt; Intestines -&gt; Decorations. Then you need the early progression at both the radtoads and supermutants. Kill boss and mob immediately.
---
Next year we should really try to make speed running Fasnacht a competitive thing.
---
Yes. 100%. Like the sheepsquatch staff or club
---
Anything with a bloodied prefix.
---
Oh sir. How I love you so.
---
This is great advice.
---
i just attempted this and found several  ultracite ore deposits which summoned scorched but none let me interact again.  anyone have a more precise location?
---
Just need hand sanitizer now. LOL
---
Come on, you don't have to be that extreme.  I have no idea what is coming in patch 20, so I know it is possible.
---
I thought I was insane when I didn't see it on the list when I LITERALLY SAW IT YESTERDAY.
---
Guess the fo76 team delayed their trailer\\teaser for this because of how Update 20 is delayed. :(
---
People can’t even PvP without some complaint. I remember when we could have big group fights in adventure mode when people were beefing over workshops. Now there is little incentive to take a workshop.
---
Sounds like someone quit the game and wanted to throw a doughnut party.
---
Yea directly from the inventory, really out a damper on wanting to play the game cause I've been collecting those since launch a few years ago
---
Not saying it doesn't exist, but in my 50+ years living in Southeast Texas, *I* have never heard it before this.
---
Not judging using it or not using it or if it exists or not, but if it were a common racist expression, I would have thought one of my racist inlaws or neighbors surely would have used it by now.
---
Paper bags despawn after a period of time. Sometimes that period is only a few minutes, other times it's closer to an hour. World containers persist as long as the server is running. I've dropped stuff in a cigarette machine, come back hours later, and it's still there.
---
If I really like someone’s camp, I make sure to buy something from their vending machine even if I don’t want/need it. Sort of like tipping them for being SPECIAL!
---
People are saying it works by Tanagra, and the one by West Tek worked for me for sure. It's weird that it's not working a second time though. Ultracite veins outside of a nuke zone will still spawn endless scorched if you keep interacting with them. I did that inside Glassed Cavern.
---
Max bullion is 5k I believe.  So what I am doing is buying the PA parts (I am the opposite of you I wear SS and don't use PA) as I get close to cap so that when the new stuff comes out I will be really close to cap to buy new stuff.
---
i think it's actually illegal in at least some places to name your child Jesus Christ, though i don't agree with those laws (it's fine for a game to restrict your name based on their policies but IRL is a different story)
---
To avoid spoilers you should avoid social media or news sites **that specialize in the topic for which you’re trying to avoid spoilers.**

I haven’t finished watching the new Picard series yet. I’ve got one more episode to go. 
---
Guess how much time I spend reading through the Star Trek themed subreddits?
---
Here’s a hint; not much at all in the past few months.
---
Do you know what you are talking about? The chat mod has a very active community and extremely active developer and I am in it nearly every day and it kicks ass and Fallout76 would benefit from it greatly. If you want to be a recluse turn it off, which has been a feature of multiplayer games featuring chat since the beginning of time and is a feature of the mod in its current state
---
I can only imagine the outrage from everyone at a nuke when someone smacks the queen straight off the edge of the map.

Some people buy things out so you lose caps and the items

Would you have preferred no ITV so you could complain about that instead?
---
Right that I am doing have the helmet so far...just woundering if the ss is worth it given I am only out of pa for about 10 mins of the game when I play.
---
Well dang. That's where we were looking too. We even set off the nukes ourselves lol. Ah well, hopefully we'll have better luck this weekend. Congratulations to you and your wife for finally getting one, my man and I are jealous!
---
To get you to fight back and waste your time, along with a few caps each time he killed you. 
---
You engaged in consensual PvP but are now complaining about the aftermath?
---
Some people say to not see him for a whole week I’ve tried this still hasn’t worked for me but has for some people, I think it’s just random at this point when you’re able to buy gold again from him
---
Heh awesome!
---
The only day he sells me gold is on Saturday. If I miss Saturday I can’t buy from him the rest of the week.
---
i just got a lvl50 instigating fixer for 1500 caps .
---
Killed her untold times solo and it won't complete. Totally bugged
---
Cool idea, but Bethesda still hasn’t fixed friends lists (people appearing offline incorrectly, invitations don’t take you to the invite but to another player, invites to add friends doesn’t show up so you have to mutually add each other manually). Oh and item preview is still broken.
---
I’ve been in the same world as you before! I might even have shopped your vendors.
---
Geez I agree, I expected a deeper system to be honest not just incrementals of the same iteration. 
---
If I am being Frank some of this systems feel sorta half-heartedly done just to get them out there, but with no focus on further developing them. Also I don't know if it's just me or what, but I felt like for a game that has been out for a while updates are far in between with little content (well adding NPCs wasn't "small" but you get me)
---
Ich kann es einfach in Deutsch nicht spielen, aber ich finde die Übersetzung ist ausnahmsweise mal passend gewählt.
---
You can trick wallpaper inside-out using just one wall, but it's a pain depending on what your building looks like and where you're trying to put in the backwards wall, especially if it's at foundation-level. I've done it using stairs and floor pieces (basically ending up with floor pieces beside foundation pieces), and also roofs because walls snap to roofs much easier if you have the space to work with. The downside is, the exterior wall will become the interior wall, so keep that in mind if you try it out.
---
&gt;Instead of giving news they are reporting something we all know!  
---
So you already knew multi-factor authentication was available for our accounts now?
---
Probably not cause then you have to buy legendary modules to make them and then what you get is random.
---
And others do it so they can get rid of caps because they have things in their own stash they want to get rid of.
---
I use a junkies explosive laser rifle, but a normal laser weapon is pretty lame unfortunately. Junkies in general help out a lot with the damage plus armor penetration cards. Only worth using laser if it’s legendary.
---
This is wholesome💛
---
If its duped, you can not tell the difference. Beth wont ban you and they wont delete the weaoon neither.
---
It feels bad that you may have a duped weapon... I have a JE gatling plasma, I traded a godrolled handmade, so it can be a duped one...
---
Not unless it's a burning bush. Then it'll give you 10 commandments, not 3.
---
If they have a vending machine, you can buy something as a form of donation. This is the only reason I ever buy ammo.
---
You can get 20% reduction as an effect on legendary armor that stacks with perk.  I'll often have a couple thousand pounds of scrap on me because it's a huge waste of space to put it in stash.
---
Generally though aside from a couple things like ballistic fiber, coal, flux, and maybe screws, springs and crystal if you use a lot, there isn't much reason to worry about scrap because if you know where to go you can get hundreds of whatever you need in a couple minutes.
---
Someone nuked a players camp south east of monongah power plant just as a real blast at Seneca hotel appeared.  Almost all the scorched dropped high rad fluids, 18 in total.

Same here

Nothings working for me

I can’t get in either. Xbox

&gt; With 4 players in a group, it’s +20% XP and Cap bonus at 4 players
---
I play this game regularly and at level 200+ and I didn't know about this bonuses. You think casual or just regular players would op for the CHA bonus or the Shiny +100% XP?
---
My point is that the bonus is too ambiguous. They should have just said +20% XP and Caps Bonus.
---
that is totally fair. sorry, i wasnt trying to be as hostile as it may have come off.
---
i just went back searching and it seems like it's just less atoms in general
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gjmy4s/psa_new_road_map/fqly44s/

that is some of the discussion about it on the roadmap post
---
Please Be sure to emphasize this discussion is about weapons only. Assassin's armor is fine as it pays a valuable role in pvp.
---
The vertical half-walls in Fallout 4 weren't great either, there's the thick concrete ones but they're the old-standard height as opposed to the warehouse height. Warehouses/barns had ruined half-walls that were better than nothing but still had gaping holes in them. Half-verticals would be lovely in this game, but unfortunately I'm going to guess that takes more work than reskinning old objects.
---
Unfortunately I'm on PS4. But thank you
---
I know there has been some info given out but has anyone heard if there will be new items that can be bought with gold?
---
Everyone got banned again. I can’t login either.
---
Seems so... I cannot get into the game on Steam and cannot log in into Bethesda website...
---
Not lag per se, but I've noticed I cannot quick swap between Gatling Gauze and .50 cal for a second or two after firing the GG. I can quick swap between my two rifles though.
---
If you bought super cheap marine armor helmets/tactical helmets then yes that’s me lol
---
Went down for me also, tried going into atomic shop and it spat me out the game
---
Not working for me too. I see other similar post
---
You're just wrong. Even if I was the type that spent all my time building up a camp, I wouldn't selfishly act like the game doesnt need more events. It does. Most players cant put 800 hours into a game that has very little to do. I might personally want BGS to do more camp stuff, but I shouldnt downplay everyone else's concerns just because of my niche tastes. That sucks and you should stop, please. That's like saying Bethesda shouldnt fix a bug because you havent experienced that bug. 
---
&gt; And I found FO4 very stale to explore after about 150 hours. I don’t know why this game is different, but for me it is. 
---
You're just not a logical person. Idk why I expected more from this conversation but you're obviously a very weird individual. Okay, you enjoy wandering around the same locations doing nothing xD cool. The map really isnt that big and the locations are largely devoid of interesting content. Fallout 4 had the same or more density of content in its locations, you dont make sense 
---
&gt;   OP is asking for new events weekly though and that really is unreasonable and would take away resources from bigger improvements IMO.
---
OP is one person. You shouldnt latch onto specifics of one person's communication of an issue and instead you should focus on the issue.
---
Exactly. It’s one thing I’d try we’re using exploits to force PvP or damage a player. 
---
This was consensual. 
---
Last night I was leveling up an alt (currently level 11). I’d spent the last few of my caps buying a few plans at a vendor along with some ammo and was literally broke. I’d stashed all my scrap. 
---
And about two minutes later I got ‘attacked’ by a level 77. I stopped, looked at him, and over area chat said ‘I literally have nothing droppable on me. You’re wasting your time.’  His reply was something about being scared to lose all my junk. I laughed my ass off and said ‘fine’, let’s go and you can keep whatever I drop. 
---
I shot him once and then went to photo mode two thumbs up. He took about five seconds to kill me (which was kind of shocking) and then once he realized he got no caps and no junk, he got a bit pissy. 
---
I laughed my ass off and went about my business after turning Pacifist back on. 
---
PvP is 99% consensual.  The only legitimate complaints are the rare instances in which a glitch is used to force PvP.
---
Same here on Xbox, I was server hopping and now it’s disconnected from server :(
---
Or it was rightfully desevered
---
looks like they just added Multi-Factor Authentication in the new inside the vault maybe their severs getting hammered right now lol

The SS chest piece with jetpack is worth it even if you have a jetpack on your PA since it uses AP which is infinitely replenishable.  It really is imho the best thing they added in Wastlanders.  Huge QoL increase.

I actually forgot about that one

I’m just barely lvl 51. My first hour of the game, 2 guys gifted me a ton of stuff. It was sooooooo helpful. I’m still grinding. But, I always stash stuff in suitcases at the Charleston Station. My CAMP is right on the road up the hill from it. Make me feel good to pay it forward every time I play.
---
EVERYONE IS BANNED. Todd wants to play alone from now on. 3:(
---
Same on PC and PS4 :(
---
same issue here, bethesda have posted and issue the service status on their site so they are aware i hope
---
Ist hald nicht wörtlich übersetzt. Aber sinngemäß.
---
please don't use the containers!  I lost a couple of plans switching alts on a private serve because i used a tool box instead of just putting it on the ground.    I think the tool box is less safe than the suitcases but I still lost the plans and I don't do it anymore.  Have not had a problem since just dropping it on the ground.
---
You’re the one making the claim that there is a way to influence the RNG. Therefore burden of proof is on you.
---
Same... PC
---
No.  Definitely not.

Bethesda forgot to pay the electric bill again...

I got 1407374883553289 error and a lot of others. Now I wont do another post on it. 
---
Other bethesda games affected as well according to bethesda.net/status
---
Europe ps4 , same
---
As a thought, the metal support beams will give that sort of error if used on any floor other than the first floor; a lot of my builds use them so if I actually want to try and plunk a pre-built camp down in a new location, I'll remove all those first.
---
Also, the cooking stove variant that looks like just a little pan on a tiny fire/grating will give the floating error no matter what it's been placed on.
---
Both servers and forums are down. I think there are some problems with the MFA, since I couldn’t even launch the game like 10 minutes ago because I enabled it but the game didn’t register it.
---
My experience shows that 200 caps per star nobody buys, but 100 caps per star a lot of people buy
---
same here on PS4
---
No way. 50 to 100 per star
---
I was thinking of it...I like the look of it...but its my luck that id buy the ss armour and then new stuff comes out that id really like...but have no gold lol since I only play for about an hoir a day...I only get like 10 treasury notes a day...so if my calculations are correct it will take me 100 days to get all the gear ..bwhahahahaha
---
I think, a while ago, it was said that it’s 25 caps per scrip. So if the weapon is worth 9 scrip, you’d multiply that by 25 to get a 225 cap weapon. 40 scrip would be worth 1000 caps. Of course if you manage to get a god roll, you can kinda do what you want with the price.
---
It's all good. It wasn't that you came off as hostile, I just felt it important to clarify my initial post.
---
Great, thanks!

They getting DDossed??

---
Little east of pleasant valley station
---
Gauntlet, gauss shotgun, pistol and minigun are craftable with 1 or 2 modules.  They're your cheapest way to turn the garbage you get from legendaries into something useful.
---
If you specifically want a bloodied fixer, well good luck to you.  You could spend 24 hr/day grinding events for scrip and legendaries and trading with Murglegurgle and not get one in a  year.
---
But that is your fastest route, grind events/dailies for scrip and let the mole miner rip you off over and over again.
---
Login servers (game and website) took a shit.
---
My wife is still online and playing, weird 😁
---
Sure, I'll happily sell you a 1 star Lead Pipe or Pipe Pistol for 1000 caps.
---
Ofc not. Nobody's paying 3,000 caps for a 3\* nocturnal golf club.
---
Sure, if you’re a hoarder and don’t actually want to part with your wares that your significant other is making you sell.
---
I usually go 100-130 a star on crap I ran out of scrip to get rid of, and with decent modifiers I go for 180-250 a star depending how good the rolls are.
---
If it’s a God roll obviously all bets are off but then I’m not listing that normally.
---
No there dark just got it from atom shop still looks cool
---
If it's good might be more
---
The making *what* department?
---
Again, I didn't state it as fact. Merely something I read on here made sense to my own observations. I'm not the one creating an argument out of nothing so no it isn't.
---
I got the fixer plan on my first go around. Didn't know it was rare until much later. Can't seem to get any other cool stuff from the vent though. Would like to get the imposter sheepsquatch outfit but honestly that event is just so much work I don't know if I care enough to do it again.
---
Cheers! And 5 seconds to kill you, HaHa thats crazy! Bet you could've farted on them and blew them away, even at a lower level!
---
Same I’m getting server login error..
---
Mine says "login issues with TES Legends." "We're  currently investigating issues some players are having with logging into Legends."
---
Hmmm. I might have. Now I’m going to definitely look for it again.
---
Dang, not the answer I was hoping for. Thanks for confirming.
---
A quick 3 or 4 farming runs  of West tek and Whitesprings should get you 10 legendaries.
---
Explain why this particular weapon should be included in the loot pool?
---
If you're selling for scrip, think more along the lines of 20x scrip value, so a three-star weapon worth 40 scrip would go for 800 caps.
---
I always pay attention, and i close app when a reach 28k while someone is buying stuff
---
Weird that they’re both in strength
---
God Dammit, I just made myself a coffee and was ready to try and enjoy this game today.
---
Looks like Elder Scrolls: Legends is also down
---
I thought about seeking revenge but really didn’t want to waste the time. I’m working on a new build, but that was an amusing diversion.
---
I would not expect new content for bullion for a very, very long time.  It currently takes almost a year to get everything that is currently released.  This tells me they wanted us grinding for a long, long time before they had to give us new stuff to grind for.  I would also expect the next set of rewards to use a completely different currency or otherwise someone will have everything first day, and that's a nightmare for developement.
---
Obama why!?!?
---
Hopefully they have removed the caps from presents out of the blue...
---
Candy claws
---
I wish big guns and pistols also had a second trait to their reduction skill
---
Yup mine down also :(
---
I’d probably buy it just to get rid of these damn caps
---
I think there is a character limit on posts, so everything?
---
yeah, i was farming fluxes in my private server and left 30 in the case for my main character and i lost its ;-(
---
Yeah looks like servers went down. Can’t connect at all
---
And this is why I not even bothered to rescue either named ally.
---
Also after 1000h theres not much else to do than get god tier stuff for ur build..
---
Haha I thought I got banned, I’m glad other people are having problems
---
Everything :(
---
I’m no expert on this as I primarily sell plans, but when I dabbled in junk legendaries I found its better to price per scrip instead of per star. Like 20 caps per scrip for example so a 1* would be 100c, 2* would be 300c, and 3* would be 800c. But like I said, I’m no expert
---
Are you getting an unknown server error too? Just tried to log in and no dice.
---
Thats game changing!
---
Heh, got a magic vampiric shotgun first time I tried.  OP as hell, but not bloodied.  It held me over until I could complete faction and get gauss.  Never gotten anything decent since so I just stick with stockpiling modules.
---
Yup
---
The mothman glasses are the ones that glow at night cost 210 atoms for the 3 pairs of funny glasses. The 3d ones are the best and googly eyes are good to.
---
The red eyed mothman goggles were from a gag glasses bundle earlier in the week, it didn't stay up long.
---
honestly yeah, less reading. 5 paragraphs about how to join a team?
---
It may have something to do with having lots of items - the more items in your inventory the server has to sort/track...
---
My though is when you open the window, the server starts determining what you have.  Until that search is completed, when you try to add something, it wont let you and throws the  updatng server message.
---
I get the same behavior at some bot vendors - it won't always let me sell to them immediately after selecting a category.
---
Give it a minute, then it works as expected
---
PS4 Europe I’m down. 3:0:844424930263043
---
So it's on their side, good to know. I almost had an heart attack when I tried to log in in all platforms and it said wrong password, I thought someone stole my account...
---
You claimed you’ve noticed it and that it’s a reasonable rumor. Someone asked you to support that claim. 
---
The update to that is ‘you have no verifiable evidence to even claim it’s a reputable rumor’.
---
You’ve now clarified that it’s simply an opinion and you have nothing to support your belief. 
---
Thank you. 
---
Have a good day.
---
Cant connect either near Chicago :(
---
I was transferring stuff between characters on a private. I guess my stuff is now gone forever
---
You can't get a quad bloodied fixer though....
---
Also you get them from the purveyor.
---
Can’t login but Bethesda’s support page (of course) says everything is green.  SMH
---
Everyone twitter poke Bethesda Support. They seem to think it's just the Mods lol
---
Damn I missed that
---
i have only seen one trap camp. and when i got there, there was another player shooting the back side of a building. so i looked around and saw the traps down a hallway to a vendor so i jumped on the roof of the building and waited for the player to shoot the back wall of the house off, then i jumped down and found a 3 star explosive 50 cal machine gun for sale for like 200 caps. i sold it in my vendor last night for 2k. nice trap
---
Can't get in on PC and have no mods. Wonder if Steam has the same issue.
---
Then you go to his camp and realize it’s a mule and he’s selling 250k caps worth of presents and weapons lmao
---
Edit:
---
Jk that’s a cute story and appreciate you being a good member of the community
---
The game isn't down I'm playing right now
---
I’m online right now. from brazil. and there are more people on the server
---
edit: xb1
---
I regret not buying them. I wish it had said they show up in the dark like that.
---
Nooo 😭
---
...I am not going to lie, I would instantly slot that.
---
Rip😭
---
They HAVE to come up with a better solution than that. I've lost so much stuff transferring on private servers.
---
Same on Xbox.
---
I was talking to smiley the other day and he was like "man that luket3112 fella really grinds my gears, I ain’t gonna take his sarsaparilla no more."
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one lol. I looked up the code and thought i somehow got banned.
---

 &gt; Hey all! Thanks for your patience while we investigate this.

---
 &gt; I see what you did there haha
---
YIKES.
---
I’m sure I’m not the only one, this thing looks global, guess Bethesda will have to use humans instead of monkeys to run the servers today!
---
Thanks for all the responses, at least i’m not banned!
---
Sometimes there just isn’t much for them to tell us. But if they didn’t say this you would have complained they didn’t have anything.
---
I'll usually buy 1 star for 50c, 2 star for 100-150, and 3 star for 300-350. If they're priced higher than that I shop elsewhere because I know I can find script for that price at other camps if not cheaper.
---
I'm not suggesting they shouldn't take their time.  But the shortcomings with the Legendary Perks don't seem related to the engine, as much as a failure of imagination, perhaps.  Do we really need "enemies explode on death" five different times?  Or a set bonus perks for *each* class of armor?  Between those two things alone, you've covered 80% of the Legendary Perks on offer.  It's rather lame.
---
*spams mini nukes*
---
Same on ps4
---
seems like a very bad bet to wait a few months with max gold, not doing any dailys and not buying plans. i doubt Regs shop will ever get anything new added besides the few SS armor mods and UA lining additions coming.
---
Meh. 1k per star is an okay price for mid-tier or better effects (ie Anti-Armor, Furious, Berserkers, ect.), keeping in mind top-tier effects (Bloodied, Junkies, Instigating, Vampires) can sell for considerably higher depending on the weapon and any additional effects. Low-tier effects might sell for 500 caps per star, but I doubt anyone would drop 3k on something like an Exterminators limb damage faster movement speed while aiming 10mm Submachine gun.
---
Its Bugthesda at it again
---
Drop on by lol
---
You should unplug console or PC and throw in the trash ...
---
Or you can wait for the server side problem to be fixed.
---
Really because they already have automatic and semi-automatic receivers so couldn't they just name a new model and add a button that allows you to switch between receivers in the code
---
Everybody is banned
---
Everyone
---
For scrip value?  Absolutely not. I list mine at 15c per scrip. 
---
If it’s an actually useful item?  It can sell for a lot more than that. 
---
If I saw a max level two-star Bloodied Explosive Handmade selling for 2k I’d buy that in a heartbeat. Hell, even if it wasn’t max level, Od snap that up 
---
But a Nocturnal Limb-damage Hatcher for 2k?  That’s asking to get your camp nuked, lol. ;)
---
I've never gone looking for those things but have found them twice by accident. The last time it was just standing on the road in the Ash Heap, I managed to hide while I tried to get some back up. Was already low on ammo and by the time we killed him I was down to using a .44 pistol with only 4 rounds left.
---
That seems like kind of a random thing to do, about 2 months after they were mass duped. If that was a concern, at all, for them it would have been removed when the scrip was.
---
I love these sort of threads... faith in humanity restored.
---
You can join someone else's SBQ event, but wow... sad that she doesn't count towards the point total.
---
I was just buing nice gun from vendor and sundenly lost Connection with game. Saw that i paid but didnt see that this gun is in my inventory.
---
Last time saw in someones vendor B2525 radium for 3k. Wanted to buy but 10 minutes earlier Beth Disabled vendor machines :/ now again... Problem... Funniest is that in their main paige it shows that fo76 is online...
---
Im tired of this...
---
That made me laugh, it would also perfectly fit in the universe... as a solo player, fairly new at that, i was excited to see the titles, the bonuses are dissapointing... the idea itself, team roles, awesome keep it, but they gotta work on those boons! (Im not sure if i used that word correctly i borrowed it from Cpt Jack Sparrow)
---
Place dirty water for sale at various prices, if people want to tip they can buy that.
---
Game is down on PC - I got booted off and can't get back on. Seemed to be right around 3:25 =/
---
u/ladydevann
---
/u/bethesdagamestudios_
---
Games down for me too chad.
---
I like the idea I just don’t see Bethesda ever doing it. I can see it happened if they add mod support though.
---
huh, that's weird. they were definitely on there yesterday, so this is certainly a recent development.
---
"They HAVE to come up with a better solution than that"
---
Sums up about half the features in this game, really.
---
It does, just picked one up 2 days ago.
---
One of my accounts can the other can't
---
but if your'e a herbivore, invest in corn and create corn soup. Best food in the game for a herbivore.
---
It’s happening to me but all my friends are able to play.
---
Also community forum on Bethesda.net is not loading.
---
Yes! Playing from PC in Germany
---
It isn't. Banned keyword filters don't look at the entire word, otherwise people could bypass it by just adding something at the beginning or the end of a banned word. They also don't take into account context or language.
---
For example: "Pedo" means "Fart" in spanish and it's banned even though "Fart" isn't.
---
You also could get reported for just using something like "IloveNigeria" as your nickname.
---
When the servers are back I can help crimson angel7
---
Same here, apparently an accidental ban or an error or maintenance
---
Legendary variant is fine. What I'm asking is, why does this particular weapon have to be part of a pool instead of a plan? Is there special attributes to the weapon?
---
We are investigating the log in issues right now. Thanks for your patience!
---
I sent todd a text, he said "it just works" and "buy more atoms."
---

Yes, yes you do.  So while lore wise it doesnt make sense to kill her early, it does if you want her loot.  And if you're technically skipping steps you'd think it would be more commendable.  Well, at least I think it would be more commendable lol.
---
Happening for me as well.
---
Do not relog restart or leave the game if you want to do something in fo76. If you want to log in you will probably get this issue.
---
Heh.  I sell junk weapons and armor for 6c/scrip in my vendor.  
---
(Bargain hunters:  I'm am "jeem" on PC.  All FR accepted.)
---
lol you're petitioning for less information and more fake hype so you can then get disappointed? why not just play the PTS, see the changes, get disappointed right away, no unnecessary hype. I dont get why people want to stay ignorant about a game they play a lot.
---
Same.
---
I am too, I can't login to Bethesda.net either so it seems like they're having issues
---
I was able to play fine about 10 minutes ago, but I’m getting the same issue now
---
On Xbox, me too
---
I’m getting that to on Xbox, I’m thinking maybe the servers are down but I haven’t seen anything to confirm that.
---
Ah. thanks for the definition. Good to be always learning new things here on Reddit.
---
Just got kicked on Xbox. I can’t even pull the game up now.
---
Holy shit thats an awesome idea! I can already see 4 tanks running thru wastelands, man that would be epic to see...
---
Happening on Xbox
---
same here , nothing on  [https://bethesda.net/en/status](https://bethesda.net/en/status)
---
Same code on XB1 Europe booooo
---
I got the same error on my PC when trying to log into the launcher.
---
We're investigating login issues currently, thank you for your patience! We hope to have you up and running again soon!
---
Yeah I imagine in game it just looks like a red gauntlet
---
Yep. Getting the same error here.
---
All weapons should be. This one just happened to be on my mind and the Enclave events felt like a good suggestion for how to implement it in quest-driven way.
---
Same on PS4 for me
---
Do you think they should?
---
While the receiver could change to other firing mode the perks card would be a mess. From commando to rifle etc.
---
Same for me and a friend on PS4
---
I got 4 or 5 of the points with a char the other day killing scorchbeasts at the fissures in cranberry bog. If you're into holding workshops, the NPC critters that attack those can spawn legendaries; if you have access to a private server, some workshop hopping will supplement whatever other means you're using to get points. As pointed out by someone else, Whitesprings spawns legendaries a lot but sadly my char this round got zero on her pass through there before heading down to the bog for scorchies.
---
iirc the PA chassis on top of watoga HS always has a T60 modbox behind it. the one on top of the civic center by the vertibot might also but im not positive.
---
Same on Xbox
---
I have the same problem..
---
In general most events have poor rewards (minus the regional outfits with very small chances) and there’s not really any reason to do them. Hopefully the one Appalachia update at least results in level appropriate gear.

There are confirmed sign-in issues right now.
---
It doesn't necessarily mean the game is down, though, especially if you were already playing it.
---
It‘s not possible to log in rn. 
---
Beth is investigating the issue.
---
This happened to me the other day in the mire. It was after a sbq incident, people were still lingering around finishing off the sb that came out afterwards. I shot it once or twice from a distance, then fast traveled to the watoga train station where it fell dead right in front of me with all of its loot still in the inventory. Maybe none of the guys who killed it out by the fissure site took the loot? Idk what happened but it was a fun surprise.
---
unban me pls
---
Yeah, those perks seem useless
---
Same, and finally got my frst fixer today... It even get Faster Fire Rate.... But it was a Nocturnal
---
Yeeep
---
Server issues. Lots of Bethesda games affected
---
I’m getting the same error on X1
---
Same with a long code [3:0:844424930263043]
---
Great idea but i dont see them adding this in with the way perks work though. Unless they made commando/rifleman one perk card.
---
They didn't ask to support that claim, they said it was outright incorrect so I asked them to prove it. And no, I have nothing to support my belief. I've been quite open about that from the start. Neither do they though. No idea why you feel the need to get involved in a clearly dead line of conversation either.
---
Every time, every single time...
---
Login servers are down
---
weird, maybe they're planning on doing a showcase of their own?
---
they need to turn up the spawns so you don't have to exploit a glitch like this maybe a 5 minute re-spawn instead of 10
---
youve been toddbanned
---
Bahahaha. Funny. 🤣😂
---
Nah. I did my first Enclave events at lvl 35, but with a friend (level 32). But I agree with you
---
I was doing a dry run and it happened to me too.. Got lucky, hope you didn't lose anything crazy. 🙏
---
Same on xbox
---
is it from turning in the airdrop holotapes ad nauseum?
---
replacing gas mask filters.... erm QOL? i don’t think so
---
Maybe it's just me but it seems like Bethesda's usual MO i.e. missing deadlines and bugs.
---
Yeah, same, I wonder what's going on! I just wanna grind!! 😫😫
---
Yeah dude lots of people saying the same. Hope you didn't lose good stuff☹
---
Bethesda servers are a awful and are currently down nothing you can really do but wait
---
The final two weightless powered pieces for my set :'(
---
&gt;you would have no way to tell the game that you want to go to the private space of an other player.
---
why not
---
I'm got the same problem
---
It means your account has been flagged for duping and will be banned.
---
Nah, it's just a log-in issue. Happening to everyone right now.
---
Bethesdas servers are down rn
---
It‘s not possible to log in rn. Bethesda is already investigating the issue.
---
I’m having the same issue on PS4, and noticed the Bethesda forums are down as well.
---
Much appreciate! Also the last one for me!
---
If you don't like cooking, melons give food/water, but you won't get the AP refresh bonus from corn soup
---
First off, no. That's an insane price unless the gear is actually good. 
---
Second, price by number of scrip rather than per star. For example, I charge 15 caps per scrip for crappy stuff: 1 star weapons = 75 caps, 2 star weapons = 225 caps, 3 star weapons = 600 caps. My machine labeled  "scrip crap" gets cleaned out as fast as I can fill it.

I am having this error currently on Playstation just to put that out there.  I believe it is when a lot of people are trying to login at once but I could be wrong.
---
I dont know, I have same problem with you now.
---
i have done the event about 6 times . gotten the plans twice, i dont have the hat with horns what ever its called. thats what i still do the event for

GT-65 doesn't worth it compared to X01 anyway

I put up Scrip legendaries for 10c per Scrip given.

Honestly glad it’s not just me, used super duper (the perk) to craft like 5k ammo and was worried it registered as duping.

You’re banned for duping most likely, check the latest blog post.

I'm getting the same thing on PC at 1443 CST.

Currently login issues for Fo76 and TES

Just bought brotherhood scribe for 500caps and that vendor have plenty on stocks. I thought im banned lol
---
I see what you did there haha
---
Really? Haven't duped or anything before. How annoying
---
PC/Central Europe (Germany), same problem.

From Bethesda support on Twitter: “⚠️We are currently investigating intermittent connectivity issues in @Fallout 76 and other Bethesda titles. Please keep an eye here for further updates!”
---
I'm on the far side of 50 and live in a southern state...that's a new one on me.
---
Had to google it.
---
With a name like deathstalker there has to be a reason.
---
Servers are down.
---
Came here to ask this.
---
No it doesn’t. There is login issues across Bethesda servers right now. Just check Twitter
---
Solo I was routinely getting 10-12 minutes  on public servers. Eggs were a delay, but it was that damn honeybeast which was the biggest time drain
---
F
---
It displays sideways, otherwise same cup. As for the "lore", I have no idea but am also curious.
---
I don't get what's wrong with the name...
---
They always try to give me something in return....I'm currently Level 502 / 503.
---
I seriously don't need anything, I only want to help.
---
I pay up to 600c for armor n 800c for weapons to recycle.
---
no go on PC in the midwest.
---
🤦‍♂️
---
Kind of funny people always assuming they got banned....what are you up to in the game?
---
Oh ok thank you just text me when your on
---
Any news on patch 20 release date ?
---
Banned for duping most likely, check Bethesda’s latest blog post for details.
---
You're 100% correct, yet somehow my camera bugged and lost its quest item status after a while and the zoom lens stayed on it despite not having completed bucket list yet. Sometimes bugs are actually useful.
---
perhaps.
---
we'll never know that schemes and plots ye olde todd has planned.
---
None of that is coming in Update 20, this was stated last week. Update 20 only includes the public team system. The public team system has been in the PTS since the second wave. If you go to the PTS forums, nobody is complaining about the public team system not working. Update 20 is ready to go. The only explanation is that the season 1 isnt ready to go (something that was never available in the PTS).
---
You’re most likely banned, check Bethesda’s latest blog post.
---
Same thing dude
---
or even a mod for the railway rifle?
---
Yup check the ton of other post about the same topic.
---
So amounts register as duping?
---
This ^
---
Price should be determined by the amount of scrips a weapon gives. 
---
I usually see ppl go 1:10 (scrip:caps).
---
But 1:15 works too i guess.
---
Nope I'm having it too never duped in my life.
---
Only the other 10 people that made a thread to ask the same question in the last 10 minutes. Otherwise you are alone.
---
Damnit. Was playing, everything went well. Decided to hop servers to spend caps and now I can't get in.
---
According to their tweets it has been going on for a while.
---
Lots of bans rolling out today
---
Oh really. I asked that question on here a few days ago and was pretty much told its far better on all 3 points and that x01 is the 4th best lol
---
todd has rigged that game from the start.
---
its nothing personal.
---
Zenimax and Bethesda are one company, they are seperated for legal reasons. If you hadn't noticed, Bethesda makes mostly console games and micro transaction games these days.
---
Am I the only one to be tilted by weapons not bing centered on mural displays ?

MFW campfire tales is just the physical manifestation of the game code and was never actually intended as an event

---
Man, you must have money to burn O.O
---
Try joining a team and being the team leader.  Seems to work for my friends and I.
---
Bethesda twitter/status portal isn’t an all knowing god.
---
I’m having login issues too and just coincidentally two factor authentication was released, so it’s possible that the server has overwhelmed with all the people signing in to enable it.
---
I'm guessing they found a serious issue and brought down the servers intentionally.

It's the only thing keeping me from teaming up with randos now. I just want the XP and people will be like "are you guys up for anything?" or start following you around. I don't want anyone's hopes to get crushed.
---
Servers down
---
https://twitter.com/BethesdaSupport/status/1273700231830548480 nop
---
Ha ok I'm not the only one.... That's why i stopped displayed guns in my camp
---
Did you find it took a while? I managed to get it eventually but had to starve myself while eating radaway to do it.
---
I don’t know, I was just worried that the sudden increase in ammo might’ve triggered a false flag or something.
---
Oh for sure. That’s what we did back in beta. I had my open world container that was my go to during beta. Made sure to go to a public server a “friend” was on and sent a pm letting them know not to leave the server. Then I would transfer stuff that way.
---
The only thing that is included in update 20 that we dont know is working is the seasons (that was never in the PTS). EVERY SINGLE OTHER FEATURE IN THE PTS THAT IS GOING TO SHIP IN UPDATE 20 WORKS PERFECTLY. Play the PTS yourself if you dont believe me. Update 20 WILL NOT include the legendary perks or the colossal problem event, the only 2 broken things in the PTS right now.
---
I mean obviously the 1st assumption was "severs are down" but a quick google search yielded not a single answer, including down detector at the time. So I think asking if it's happening to everyone is fair..I mean you never really know until you know.
---
They just released two-factor authentication which is causing issues with people trying to login.
---
Same PS4 US
---
Server down in NYC
---
I'm in The Forest and got a Level 50 version.
---
Banned for poor play and general lack of skill.
---
Yeah, I doubt he meant that seriously. People often add /s when people don’t get the joke.
---
But you never know for sure I guess.
---
Apparently the servers are down, possibly related to the quick team match up feature they're suppose to be incorporating
---
Because we on consoles can just see you guys play :)
---
That's what I do. I preface all my keepers with 
---
 _ so they all drop to the bottom of the list and it's an unobtrusive character so it doesn't make it harder to read what's what.
---
Server down in Spain
---
Melons are all I grow for food and water, 2 in 1! And I grow gourds to make relish.
---
Your entire ecosystem is crashing. Can't log into the account's forums are down.. Is your slack working internally?
---
Merely sarcasm...
---
It's down on Xbox too
---
Server down in France
---
Down in Texas
---
Servers down in Oppegård
---
Down in Japan.
---
You made the initial claim. That opens you up to any contrary statements to dispute your position.
---
They don’t have to prove a negative existence. That’s a flawed debate approach. You cannot prove a negative and any request to do so is ludicrous and ignorant. 
---
And this is a public forum. Not a private conversation. If you have an issue with a random person interjecting their viewpoints into a public discussion, then use a private discussion method instead.
---
🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
---
He edited that in the last part. It was just him telling me I was banned when I saw it. Not that it matters, most likely trying to pull my leg xD
---
No lol. He posted it a bunch of times on other peoples posts. He only is changing what he wrote now cuz he was corrected. He was being a know it all ass don’t feed the BS.
---
Yup. I was in for a bit right at noon and started the Arkos Farma quest. Realized I was in over my head doing it by myself so I dipped out to a player vendor camp. The world itself then looked odd, like stuck in one of the photo filters so I tried server hoping and got the error.
---
Servers down.
---
This is very ture.  I like to go act as a bodyguard for hire to low level player to help break up the grind cuz I have max rep with raider( finally) and I'm not really interested in dealing with ward
---
And I only have like 500hr
---
These are great! Need to do this as well.
---
Down on PC as well that's why I'm here.
---
While I wasn't this lowbie, I as a new player can relate. I feel guilt when people come give me things because I'm still low level. I mean, thank you for the healing, or ammo, but keep in mind that I, as a lowbie, am already probably at my weight limit! I do always vendor check when I am at someone's camp trying to get closer to my quest location requirements, so I'm always buying cheap plans that I don't have yet. I am frightened when the level 200+ comes back home to see who's buying from their camp, and just sits there... staring at me... I wave goodbye and go about my business, I don't want any trouble good sir or madam!
---
Dev doesnt deserves the photos anyways
---
Down in UK 20:52 GMT
---
The first year or two of EQ was great because of the GMs and guides, but also kind of sucked because of the GMs and guides. I remember when you still had to petition to get a surname before the /surname command was added, and then sometimes the reasons given for a rejected name were kind of ridiculous. As a former guide myself, I might have rejected that name for being 1) from established D&amp;D lore and 2) being a compound set of words which taken together doesn't look very good, but I would never have thought to revoke it due to "religious overtones" ... That reason just sound stupid given the character class and in-game lore.
---
is there a way to tell how much scrip it's worth without visiting a train station?
---
If your on ps4 and need help ill run through with you
---
How stupid are you to put 3* in your trap vendor? Serves them right.
---
I'm logged in on PS4, says world found then disconnected from server.

Down in Chile
---
They are. The fresh install seems to have helped, no crashes in 2 hours of play time
---
Server down in Belgium !!!??
---
Ok, then. Would’ve helped to just say that in the first comment.
---
But let the downvotes commence.
---
Delicious. I’d love to find you in a workshop :)))))
---
Nah he was just being a dumbass and thought that was what happened. He edited it after I corrected him. Don’t worry you are good. They should have it fixed soon.
---
Server down in Germany
---
I switched over to the Gauss Minigun to replace the LMG today... it's a great weapon, but the ammo is so darn expensive...
---
Ho you're right, I meant Ultracite.
---
But even the X01, which is worst, is close. 
---
SH Games tested against level 95 behemot and the results are : 
---
34 damages for excavator, 
---
29 damages for T45/X01/T60
---
27 damages for Ultracite and T51
---
24 for T65
---
So the gap is only 10%, which is far from the gap between SSA and BOS combat armor, which is still good.
---
So the question is : Is 10% worth the grind ? IMHO clearly not.
---
Nope all good Chad thanks.
---
PS4 got it too. Can’t log in.
---
Anyone else? Just look at all the recent posts about it lol.
---
Yep. same here. Can't login @ Bethesda launcher either..
---
Edit: PC
---
Website says no, but they are offline on pc.
---
I just need my husband to pass things to my mule. I don’t ask much.
---
Yeah same issue on ps4 !
---
I am not sure how they are doing it, maybe people I was grouped up with, but I have had people donate clean beds and icicle lighting.
---
i want the mortar cannon back from contraptions.
---
actually i want all the stuff from contraptions added in.
---
i want to see peoples rube goldberg machine camps
---
Servers are down i supose. look at all the other "server down?" threads.
---
I am so glad my fiancée and I get to do this kind of stuff too. We both love playing video games.
---
I can’t connect, but someone I was teamed with says he’s still on
---
If they don't launch it soon, they're going to have difficulty fitting it in with their stated 'season' scheduling of \~10 weeks with a few weeks in between. In a couple of weeks without release it'll mean an best, July/Aug/Sept is Summer Season. Then Oct/Nov/Dec will be autumn, and any winter-themed cosmetics and camp rewards wouldn't come out until after Christmas. Which would seem odd. And that mistiming will continue for years. They could maybe shave a week or two off each season/break to try to get back to traditional season timings, but it's not really an auspicious start.
---
I literally said it in my first reply “he edited the comment” I’m not downvoting you, but looks like people see you being a dumbass too. Sorry
---
Yeah, same issue here on PC mate they appear to be having issues. 
---
Partial System Outage by the looks of it, seeing as it's cross platform I'd say they took the servers down.
---
Only says that TES is having trouble. But hey guess we will see if FO76 updates their status.
---
Fingers crossed, I put your link to Bethesda's twitter in the description. Thank you sharing that :)
---
Lol you are not wrong!
---
Offline on Xbox yea
---
Same thing in Germany.  And I couldn’t even log into Bethesda.net.
---
Currently on for xbox. Was about to server hop.
---
No problem👍🏻
---
What was lost? Hope nothing important
---
Yeah, you have to be in a group with those people, I can't do this for random camps I find!
---
Yeah me too, Xbox here
---
Yep started about 40 minutes ago, PC
---
Sharing is caring.
---
**CAVE CRICKETS**
---
The duped presents should remove caps instead of adding and include a "You've Been Insulted" card
---
This could be abused big time
---
250-300 per star
---
Down for me on PC
---
....That’s the last code you want to get
---
There removing smiley
---
Will you be issuing partial refunds to fallout 1st subscribers for the downtime they were unable to utilize the service they paid for?
---
My friend has the same problem and same error code. Now I'm the same thing. Idk if it's a ban wave or a server error. Do you have any duped presents?
---
Just tried to log in on ps4 and getting  "An unknown server error occurred. Please try again later. "
---
Yea my main I just switch to bloodied but my unarmed tank with almost full set of ss vanguards is sweet I get in a five min starring contest with an assultron and my health barely moves lol
---
I’ve checked server status on their website and it’s green lol yea ok!
---
My issue is that I was running 3 accounts (now I run 4) at the same time to share perks and take advantage of things like Herd Mentality + Strange in Numbers for +3 cha. With the gear they were wearing, I could have 6 charisma on everyone, but still share level 5 perks like Adrenaline and Gunsmith. Since the change, I've had to adjust my characters' builds to 9, 12, and 15 charisma to share what I want.
---
So, I was hoping that with the Public Team bonded +4 charisma that I would be able to move more charisma away again.
---
Smiley?
---
Once again, quelle surprise!
---
I was already playing when I was disconnected.
---
Technically they took a system that was all right and made it obnoxiously grindy. Fallout 4: You want that mod? Get x level of the relevant perk. Fallout 76: You want that mod? Find/make a billion of that item and cross your fingers and get scrapping, and that might not even get you what you want... oh, and get x level of the relevant perk too.
---
Meanwhile, yes, melee weapons need some mod lovin'. My sneaky bloodied 1h melee dude is using a bloodied sickle. No mod slots at all. Whoo.
---
Me either mate, says invlaid user/password when I try. Looks like they've taken the whole system down.
---
They are down everywhere for everyone for no good reason.
---
My best weapon from her was a J33FR Lever
---
Im guessing no , Cause it just works Todd style
---
You’re most likely banned. Check Bethesda’s latest blog post and remember to follow rules next time.
---
Can't get into launcher at all
---
It's down on PS4 aswell so I'm Gunna guess pc are having the same problem
---
With how very easy it is to grind random legendaries for scrip, max id pay for a threestar is 200 and i have a buttload of caps. Ive never bought any item for scrip as ive never needed it, I dont run alts- which I guess is the reason that people can claim 1k for a threestar wep.
---
Melon life 4 life! 👊
---
No the servers are down
---
Bloodied quads don't exist
---
Servers down in all of Midgard
---
Non l that lknow of
---
Ultracite is free too ;) and vendors are now flooded with mods plans you can often buy for cheap
---
Literally all of us at this point on all platforms.
---
\+1
---
Ugh. I was farming red asylum outfits ;-;
---
I was hoping it was patch 20 for Seasons but it's just their crappy servers lol
---
Yea. Less than 100 imo. Whatever the scrip worth its not worth 400.
---
The what 1 penny you want back? Depending on which method you did you get either one penny or one and a half, roughly.
---
I get:"This is strange!" The Bethesda Launcher is having trouble connecting to our servers or the internet."
---
Happened after I quit to desktop from a private session.
---
PC US still down
---
I understand that this guy has a bad personal perspective of women.
---
But don't hide his story just because it isn't something you wanna see. Both sides of the coin are valuable to see. There are relationships that are happy and ones that turn south. And they're both equally valuable in learning how relationships flow and function.
---
Its a fool that drowns out the personal perspective of others just so you can have the blissful ignorance you want to see.
---
That sucks. Been looking for red as well. Damn thing one of the rarest items in the game :/
---
On a regular basis I’ll cycle through a 3* Instigating/Faster Fire Rate/Faster Reload Pump, a 2* Instigating Explosive Pump and a 3* Quad/ Faster Fire Rate/ Faster Reload Pump and I prefer the non explosive instigating over the explosive
---
[edit] I thought I had a thread saved that was a list of all the abbreviations for weapons and armor, but I can’t find it. If you search through the r/FO76 sub you should be able to find it pretty easily
---
Why on Earth is there a Building team if the players can't build together?
---
You don’t need a 3 star legendary armor for it to work. I have a level 15 zealots shotgun with crippling effect (+50% chance) and in VATS, I can 1-2 shot most enemies. I don’t even have any shotgun perks and am a Heavy Gunner PA build.
---
However, outside of VATS, the damage is shit.
---
Should be 50 cents as this is one day where they failed to provide the service.
---
Another DDoS attack?
---
MommySalami isnt cool but someone with the gamertag LilCumstain can run around just fine
---
Search by new.
---
RNG
---
And what sort of things do you think knob heads will leave, I'm pretty certain they wouldn't be very complimentary.
---
I raise or lower my price depending on how badly I need to clear stash space. Stuff moves reasonably fast at 15c/scrip, but if space is tight I will lower it to 10 and really blow it out. Anything that doesn't sell just gets scripped by me as needed, so I'm not too concerned.
---
This would explain why Bethesda shutdown the servers immediately.
---
Post too long, didn't read.   
---
Are the servers down?
---
Well I have mostly bloodied, junkie, zealot, and 2 shot...
---
That's mostly what I see people selling. I was selling for 100 caps no matter the stars and I got a message calling me names for selling to low... they bought all the turned around and put them for sell 2000-3000 caps...
---
I think it’s for the secret service jet pack? I may be wrong
---
I can’t read what it says under the front radio :/
---
i thought was banned lol glad im not the only one
---
What’s the code you’re getting?
---
Can't even login to the launcher...
---
Down in North Korea
---
Literally just seen posts. Sorry about that.
---
Same problem. Same with Bethesda web site stating all is good except some portal issue
---
EDIT: ADDED WEB SITE
---
[https://bethesda.net/en/status](https://bethesda.net/en/status)
---
I'm over level 250, and could care less about XP. Gimme the +4 charisma.
---
Thankfully I wasn't doing anything important, just trying to find a cargo bot for a nuke card that had spawned underground. They sure are advanced these days those cargo bots, looks like they now come equipped with phase matter converters.
---
Still, it’s not a whole lot. Yes, if this is down for a day it would be more but since it’s been down for about 45 minutes it’s not even 50 cents
---
Down in buffalo
---
Tell that to my 40k scrip without anything than some scrip back
---
IIRC, Armor is 3/9/24 and weapons are 5/15/40 scrip for 1/2/3 star.
---
If only..
---
i can't either, so much for my work at home lunch break! ...
---
I gotcha.
---
Samething happened to me but then I woke up in Valhalla. Should've pillaged a bit more
---
!?!?!?
---
It’s a skin not a mod. If you don’t have the jet pack plans learned for the t-60 and crafted, you can’t apply it. 
---
I feel your pain, if this is the case I have t-60 plans you can have. I’m on PC I get loads from queen killing.
---
Does anyone know if those atoms will be updated?
---
Damn. How long do you guys think they will be down?
---
Wait a minute..
---
I literally got one sooner than I expected but now it's like I ain't ever gonna get another one. Didnt realize how bad itd be lol. I got like 2 blues but I dont think they're as sought after as the red.
---
If this was just now, could be linked to the sign in issues.
---
Do you have the plans for the T60 jet pack ? I don’t think you can apply it if you don’t have the base plans
---
This works for any fissure site too. Pick up the ultracite ore and scorched will attack!
---
Everything's down. Can't log into the launcher, can't log into the game, their website is down, going to guess someone isn't happy about something and are attacking Bethesda.
---
In Texas by the way.
---
I’ve had issues with that as well. You don’t get the pop up, but once servers are back you should just have them in your atom pool
---
I'm right there with you,I've gotten maybe 1 really good and usable roll from her.
---
It's for power armour. I checked earlier today
---
Im doing a x-01 PA with full hp, got a .50cal j/e and j/e fixer and its aaah very fun.
---
Having it on Xbox! Damnit!
---
you can get level locked cards in packs..
---
Probably not.  Better outcome than the treasure hunter hat method where it removes everything else including facial hair lol
---
200k ultracite does seem like a bit too much.
---
My bf and I aren't able to connect.
---
The code we are getting is 3:0:844424930263043
---
In starting to think the servers are in fact down. Another 3000 post have been made about it in the last 10 seconds.
---
Wait?!? The servers might be done? I need to make a reddit post as well! We need to get to the bottom of this!
---
Yellow, then forest, then pink, green&amp; blue, and brown 
---
I have all but red lol
---
I say make it a skin for the regular plasma rifle
---
Seppuku, obviously.
---
Yeah, but I've only ever had that happen in the early packs. I've leveled 17 characters to 50+ now, but have never gotten higher level cards in a pack after 10.
---
You'll need to be able to make a standard jet pack.
---
Xbox? I can make one for you
---
Yep
---
If not planning to get hit, the extra resistances are not very useful. Go unyielding for extra stats and dont get hit instead :)
---
also FYI : when you level up you do Not have to Pick a card from the same stat you put the point into.. after you assign the point.. you can scroll the stats and pick any card you have unlocked
---
Whatcha saving up for ? 5000 atoms buys out most of the shops current content lol
---
I'm getting error code 3:0:844424930263043
---
Hahaha I'm dead
---
Thank you, sir!
---
Wow I often buy 3 stars for 180
---
MORE DAKKA!!!!!
---
Maybe it’s just not meant to be! Oh you meant to the game, my bad.
---
I need a follow-up graphic that tells how many berets players got.
---
Done this a few times before. 
---
Find him by actively spawning and then just message yer mates. They keep logging out and returning on you while you keep him there and his inventory often changes and you get all the exclusives in one night/day.
---
A few prefer random chance and get the stuff on their own, as I did, but new buddies made online love what they see you with and this is a good way to help the impatient ones or to get outfits to sell for your vendor.
---
Banned? For what playing the game lol
---
Aww :) my partner plays on a different console otherwise we would looooove to play together! Sadly neither is willing to convert! But great you guys have that together.
---
Yeah, I know you can't bank levels for cards that you choose. I'm only concerned with the bonus packs.
---
I got the pop up thats the issue. It said "+40" twice but the total I had never changed. I really hope it works.
---
Hmm, was hoping public teams might be a bit more specific.
---
**Terrors of the night**
---
*I'm sure it'll be fine...*
---
Looks like you’re in the minority bub
---
First Reddit post so bare with me. Thanks for the links to Bethesda’s Twitter feed and the helpful comments from you all! 
---
Definitely looks like it’s because of the connectivity issues as I haven’t duped anything to warrant a ban.
---
lol oh yeah, same for the pink ones. too girly, but i am a girl I'd be happy to take it off their hands!
---
hey didja hear..?
---
Is there ultracite where the queen spawns? I couldn't find any. I'd love some good directions if there is some, it would make things much easier since that's where people always seem to target their nukes!
---
We still dont have definitive answers about the seasons but I believe the GB rewards are just some extra currency to help you on your way.  From the way I understood it everything arriving with seasons is free provided you make it to their steps on the board.
---
Remember, we usually get at least a couple of week warning when new stuff comes out thanks to those awesome data miners.  Usually more than enough time to save up for whatever is coming.
---
Servers aren’t down but the player vendors are. /s
---
My suggestion to cover most things is keep any outfit or apparel item you get from any events, some of those are very rare and worth shed loads of caps.
---
This has been posted before but is extremely helpful. Not mine, full credit to the author for being a gent and making it.

---
If not make sure to send in a ticket
---
I never got attacked until level 56-58
---
I agree, I was just referring to what the poster would need for his shotgun that he was using to make it work, I myself have a medics bash 2\* combat shotty it's brilliant (in vats) and like you I run no shotgun perks either.
---
Yeah they are dumb for doing this.. But the people opposing pvp mechanics are way more vocal, so of course they are getting their way.
---
Hasn’t ever stopped them from banning people before. I know still waiting on a temp ban from two years ago to be lifted. Know nothing of duping or what could possibly make them think I did?
---
Honestly they should just remove world pvp and keep it to specific events.
---
Disconnecting during your first nuke launch is a rite of passage in FO76.
---
Ah, ok. Thanks for the clarification.
---
Just searched and can’t find any other posts with that code hmm 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
it just works.
---
I need the plans. Thanks though.
---
It was just a few minutes ago. I tried logging off and back on and realized there were server issues.
---
Same here.
---
they should have left the adventure alone and made pacifist the side mode...
---
You got lucky. It took me 20 minutes of waiting there while it chewed on my ankles before I finally caught the whoopsies.
---
The engine is buggy enough. 
---
Not saying it can't be done, mod authors have done some frankly wonderful and innovative things with Fallout 4, but seeing as the weapons Bethesda have implemented have their own bugs I'm not confident in them adding new features like this. 
---

---
I need the plan myself, apparently. I tried my alt first, which I transferred a full set from my main...
---
I buy things when I see something I like. Most of the time there just isn't a lot in the shop that interests me.
---
Lmao I'm going to hit you
---
Same happened to me on Xbox 😑
---
Backpack plans are no drop/can’t be traded.  
---
Maybe try uninstalling/reinstalling the game
---
thats a drag..
---
ive never bothered to launch a nuke.. I just get in on others SBQs.. its enough for me
---
You're welcome! I enjoy spreading the cancer of memes.
---
PvP has been made continually worse since launch. I'm not sure why they ever included it or made an Assassin's class of weapons and armor if they never planned to support it.
---
Same. looks like login servers might be down.
---
^^^^^My ^^^^^heart... ^^^^^This ^^^^^is ^^^^^too ^^^^^wholesome...
---
If you took 3 seconds to look at the subreddit, you'd see its an ongoing issue.
---
welcome to the club
---
Armor. All kinds of it. Scrap it and mod your existing armor. Also, hunting rifles are very good in earlygame. I made myself a sniper rifle at level 10 or so. Keep all clothing, but do not sell it - you can do that later. Like u/Steamedradscorpion suggested, take a look at the list.
---
Since the problem is with Bethesda's servers where all Bethesda's info are stored (since it affects the website and forums as well), I'd day so
---
Totally understandable.  That's why I craft and stock BoS Under Armors that give Strength buffs without a level requirement.  Most of the weapons and other armors I sell are usually Leveled 10-25 to help out new players.
---
Also, there is always free booze available in my punchbowl :)
---
done it myself 20 times before i posted and a good community member decided to add me and give the plans for free 
---

---
Progress is saved server side, so if you uninstall/reinstall you wouldn’t lose your progress.
---
In the forest, if you ever do "The Messenger" event and get a bunch of jumpsuits or a scout armor mask, they're very rare and valuable. They come from various events in the savage divide but new players won't generally be venturing out that far and aren't likely to survive long if they do. The Messenger is technically considered a savage divide event though, and can occur anywhere on the map, including low level areas. The rare jumpsuits are whitespring, white powder, BoS, and camo. The Responders jumpsuit and the mechanic jumpsuit aren't rare at all though. And for reference, that rare alternate fireman's suit is called "Responders Fireman Outfit," can be rarely rewarded from the "Ounce of Prevention" quest very early on in the game, and from most events in the forest region. The Firebreather's outfit isn't rare but you can only get it once per character unless you buy more, so it's also worth keeping as a souvenir or selling for up to a few hundred caps because lots of people do like it.
---
I originally thought it was just a bad internet connection, so I restarted my console. I guess I’m not the only one having this issue!
---
same here
---
Lmaooooo
---
They can't even hotfix the fast travel or the can't respawn overencumbered bugs yet... With all the problems this game has they are just so dam slow to fix anything that I actually think they don't give a shit, but I sadly still keep coming back.
---
Oh God yeah, don't get me started on weapons that lack modding options. (Melee and projectile alike) I mean, talk about uninspired designs. 
---
Seriously why can the sickle not have: 
---
* Reaper sickle mod: ads an extra large sickle that does 30% " splash" damage to near enemies when hit. 
---
* Honned edge: sharper edges increase critical damage by 15% and VATS critical recharge faster
---
Or you know idk literally anything, this are two absurd ideas I came with while sipping coffee.
---
Now I don't want to make a winning thread. But I don't see why hasn't the Fallout 76 team not expanded on existing systems or offer them love &amp; polish. I gotta wonder is FO76 is even on Bethesda top 5 priorities right now  
---
Anyways I want the team building on FO76 to have more frequent communication and be open to players feedback / suggestions (much like with the PTS that's a great step on the right direction) 
---
Also side note: WHY THE EVERLIVING HELL CAN I NOT CHANGE MY PIP-BOY UI COLOR OR LIGHT COLOR?!?? 
---
It is literally using the same damn engine and the freaking code is there?!!
---
Sorry I haven't noticed.
---
You don't get aroma from dailies. You get scrip.
---
Hey, nothing about that tweet suggest it wasnt me who personally broke the game.
---
I will never understand that...when you play it all out, it doesn’t matter if you sell things for super cheap or not unless everyone is selling the same things.  And no one is selling the same things primarily.
---
Seems to be affecting the Bethesda site? Can't log in or change my password.
---
Hi I just found that I also cannot login in the game. It gives me message: We're currently  investigating issues some players are having with logging into Legends. :(
---
I’ve bought, sold, and traded backpack mods.
---
glitching raider rep to max
---
This is not a PvP focused game (thank god), it needs removing entirely.
---
You have to do the Tadpole quest to get the larger backpack. It isn't tradeable. Mods are, but getting them is a huge grind so I don't think that there are many available for you to buy. 
---
You can get the plan for Small backpack for free from Morgantown airport, but it does not support mods, only cosmetic skins.
---
Or look at @fallout.
---
Maybe Bethesda's servers are being peacefully protested to the ground
---
Bethesda is having issues on their end.  Ignore u/RaiderDawg
---
My bad. I didn't mean daily missions, I meant daily challenges.
---
WAAAGH
---
there will never be PVP features added to this game. they are going in a different direction. it amazes me you people dont play an actual PVP game
---
No one wants to hear your voice or your uninformed opinions, so I'd suggest you don't bother trying to fix it.
---
Do you know when it will be fixed
---
There's several ultracite nodes around fissure prime, and several more surrounding the other fissure just to the west if that gets included in the zone as well.
---
I guess I should have been clearer that I was talking about the backpack plan itself, since that’s one of the things they are looking for
---
Maybe the servers are down ?
---
I cant seem to get any confirmation, anyone else having the issue?
---
Also my email is not recognized as well. It tells me that it doesn't exist :( ... so I cannot login on their website. Holly crap.
---
Probably wouldn’t have been 500,000 posts if the game wasn’t marked operational with a big green checkmark on their website. (Still is, btw)
---
I wonder if it will correctly save everything you did on the server between the logging in issues starting and you logging off. Hopefully so.
---
If you want to get real technical, they owe for the whole month in any country with good consumer protection laws, as they failed to give 1 month of service.
---
“We take your security seriously” is the “thoughts and prayers” of computing.
---
On PS4 when I get that error I usually do a system shut down.  Then boot in protect/safe mode and then do a 3 min database rebuild.  That helps a great deal as over time I find I crash more and more with PS4 (2 systems and I have one slim and pro).  I would try that before an uninstall.  You will know fairly quick if it works
---
The bullion guy
---
More like they are removing another axis of griefing used by the so-called PVPers...
---
LMG, with the right perks it shoots fast, melts the queen, fast reload even with the 15%, a somewhat large ammo capacity, and a good look. Only downside is the lack off ammo to feed it and any atomic shop skins.
---
I was in the game just a few minutes ago until i tried to hop to another server, now can't login at all. Apparently, if you were logged in before you can still play.
---
There are a few posts with some recommendations on the PTS forums, hopefully they'll see and acknowledge them.
---
Wouldn't it just become a confetti cannon when using cloth?
---
Aw man. That's horrible. Disconnecting while launching your 1st nuke isn't good, especially you have to do this again. But here's a tip. If you completed the preparation quest (not sure which one) for the Vault 79 raid, you should have the Chinese stealth armor in your inventory. A friend of mine did a launch with minimal weaponry use that way.
---
They updated on twitter they see an issue in the fallout 76 servers as well
---
You haven't experienced FO76 fully until you've lost connection during a nuke launch, sucks it was your first one. If the problem had been a few mins later I also would have been in a silo.
---
If I have to do the challenges again, I'm fine with that. If it reports them as complete but doesn't award me the Atoms, I'll be a bit annoyed.
---
It sounds like you just don't enjoy the game. Go play something different.
---
No, because the vast majority of players didn’t want PVP.  I haven’t seen anyone do the existing PVP content other than NW for about a year now.  I see people take workshops but there are barely any disputes over them.
---
maybe they are finally permabanning all the bastards and making legacy weapons untradeable..?
---
You scared the shit out of me when I read that, I don't even dupe but I know Bethesda hasn't been very observant of who the ban. Jesus Christ man.
---
It just works....
---
It'll be like any other charisma boost, so no it won't help with perk sharing. Sometimes I wonder who comes up with these ideas. Players want a real LFG system and text chat to help set up teams, instead we get this. /sigh
---
Wait til it happens 3+ times during the Vault 79 raid or right after you kill the sbq.
---
Apparently it was not a waste of your time, though, because you needed it so that you could create this post.
---
Yeah, I had a Druid and named him Sownazi, they made me change it, so I changed it to Blumpkin, then they made me change that, too :(
---
Technically yes
---
Actually, why not?
---
*Presses X to doubt*
---
How are we doing on the results? In fact I will make a new post asking about your results on finding out the results from the post @Eldyrus is making 😂
---
I’m fighting sbq right now.... only joking
---
The servers are down silly
---
My punchygirl actually has a bloodied variant I can switch to without changing SPECIAL stats once I've got the relevant weapon(s), a bit more unyielding gear, and perks (still filling a couple out, I forget which at the moment). Like so, and note the mutations too (I'll put in Adrenal Reaction once she does have the bloodied goodies):
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f396698&amp;d=s92sg2e00ss2se2ir2l71lu2la2a12pe2a72sb2ed3eh2eu0a40c72i42aa0a00cu0cm0&amp;w=ce0i12sf2ej4lt2am2ck0eo2a80cr0&amp;m=1cef9gh82&amp;n=Wednesday%27s%20facepunchy
---
The ones slotted into that build are the bloodied variant, with Barbarian being an option in either version (would swap-out for Travelling Pharmacy if you aren't having issues with stimpack weights). Trade-outs to make the rest of the build non-bloodied are as follows: Rad resist, Fireproof, and Radicool get swapped for the other cards when not doing bloodied, although if I'm going up against a lot of scorchbeasts I keep Fireproof in regardless (and Adamantium Skeleton sits out for the time being). I swap in the other charisma cards (or your bodyguards card would work) when in a group, instead of Lone Wanderer. Nerd Rage becomes First Aid, which is very nice when coupled with Field Surgeon to give stimpacks a big boost in non-bloodied mode (also 6 int is convenient for crafting and repairs). Evasive and Born Survivor get traded in for Dodgy and Moving Target. And finally, Bloody Mess goes in place of Serendipity.
---
May or may not be useful to ya, but your build feels to me like it still needs some fine-tuning. I love theorycrafting and have also tweaked, retweaked, and sometimes tweaked-yet-again builds on several characters now at points where I realized "it's just not working" or things could be done better.
---
Had a feeling since we got level 15's that we'd be able to craft it? Even though we currently can't.
---
new to the game. Why are the prices in the vending machine important? Ive only ever seen one trap house and it wasnt anything crazy. The dude just stacked the nailed board traps in a big square then put vendors around it.
---
Yeah those were max prices I'll go lmao
---
i just got kicked short after a scorched earth event... error 3:0:844424930263044 ... ahm ... cant login atm... WTF!?!? (europe, germany)
---
How do you message someone? I have heard of this, but how would someone get a message from you in game while at a vendor?
---
If it looks crap it's worth a lot of caps.
---
I've been getting errors since last night with my game blue screening repeatedly and multiple different error codes. Never duped or did any exploit unless server hopping is considered an exploit 😔
---
But when they list outrageous prices it defeats the purpose of a small tip jar.
---
Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
---
I've received a grand total of 2 from the purveyor, and I've had the plan since the first week the plan was available. The loot pool for "ranged weapons" is just too fucking big.
---
Thanks all. 
---
I'll try the boot in protected mode first and than if that doesn't work, the re-install.  
---
Thank again markww22 and Aurick\_411
---
You in a dream? This is Bethesda. You ask, you wait, you wait a little longer, maybe a bit longer, then it comes, with bugs and things going wrong.
---
weird ive had that open in a tab for awhile and i hit F5 and poof bethesda is gone
---
They have to hotfix the hotfix
---
U talking about unable to join any server? Have the same problem here
---
Why would you wanna tip a camp with outrageous prices though? Kind of mutually exclusive in my book.
---
Geborstener Stahl ist eine Lack Farbe meistens sagt man auch brünierung, zu englisch brushed steel. "denk doch mal nach bevor du so nen schmarm postest."
---
I believe they wanted to support it, we had quite a bit of stuff at the start, but people just didn’t participate. Things got worse with griefers went out of their way to do slap damage to people to kill them, then doing things like teaming up with a person and starting PVP with a friend.  
---
PVP died from a lack of overall interest and griefers finding ways to force people who didn’t want to PVP into PVP fights (or just cause anguish by destroying a persons base).
---
Yeah or make pacifist wear a pink diaper and binkey so we know who's who
---
Because they fundamentally misunderstood the franchise fanbase.
---
Save up for the strangler heart pa. Nice bit of extra damage
---
LMAO
---
Same, can’t log in.
---
What kind of error code are you getting? Have you tried making a post about it?
---
im not the OP lol
---
What’s going on?
---
End result would have been the same.  Most people would be playing in the side mode then, and there wouldn’t be enough reason to support the “adventure” mode.  
---
We’d be where we are now - they’d cut support for the lesser used feature and focus on what people do play.
---
yeah. I realised that after i posted it but couldn't get on to edit it.
---
And then i forgot to edit it :p
---
i forgot bolstering doesn't increase stats
---
I'm 32 but I can relate to 99% of what you just wrote here. I had a Commodore 64 though as a first computer. I get all teary-eyed thinking about having to punch in all sorts of commands to start reading from the cassette tape drive, and I can still hear the sweet 'click' of the locking latch on the 5.25" floppy bay.
---
Vocal and in number.
---
If you engage a lvl 100+, he'll wreck you in seconds. I never engage in PvP unless it's an accident or a player is being toxic. 
---
But I know why everybody is so scared. It's basically your loot. The things you have - the scrap - is worth a lot. Especially people coming back from loot tours do not wannt to be killed in first place. 
---
Tip: Just mute everybody by setting the VC to Team. A while back, I was playing a Scorchbeast Queen event and there was a hacker (or dev, possibly). He was engaging EVERYBODY and was getting super toxic on the VC. Worst event ever.
---
That's awesome. I tried 2 nukes and couldnt find 1. Then a week later did some queens and got 1 in the middle of the queen fight. Everyone ignored the queen until it was dead. I was so pumped.
---
Well, they can but they keep rolling back updates to faulty versions.
---
Can't even log into their site. Me thinks their enabling of two-factor authentication blew up the server hamsters.
---
Wonder how many dropped 3\* nocturnal rolling-pins.
---
Yep, I have few bloodied builds and they're way tankier than full health due to multiple perk cards and mutations that work best at lower health.
---
I always love the stories from console people about how they can send other players messages
---
So it is a feature that’s consistent throughout all nuke zones, as I use this method to farm materials. However, the chance for ore deposit to become an ultracite deposit is randomly determined, so you do have to hunt for them within the zone each time you enter it.
---
Correction, level 2.
---
Also there seems to be an issue with the servers right now, which might be the underlying reason anyways.
---
I need to do the revive part for the tadpole on ps4 as well, drop me a dm and we can help each other
---
If you manage to get to his vendors, you can clear him out, especially for free. Just dumb, he could have crafted 30 shovels, the map would still show 30 weapons. Or put everything at max cap price. Trap camps come in 2 basic flavors. Cool folks make it a puzzle or at least give you your junk back. Asshats just try to steal your junk, or your caps and junk if you buy junk from them.
---
The stealth suit has absolutely changed the way I play!
---
Dunce hats for all pacifist users woo
---
I bet it is the Enclave screwing with us.
---
Todd spilled coffee on the goddamn server again...
---
we dont get such a basic luxury on PC
---
This sucks I only have an hour to play and this happens
---
I DO try to partake of everyone's vintage nukashine in the punchbowls because I've watched enough Youtube to know that can be fun. The first time I did this, I ended up at the Sickleman's house next to 76 and was very disappointed. The 2nd time I ended up in the dry lakebed and was also sad I didn't get to travel very far at all. Those videos lied to me!
---
that never occurred to me. 
---
nice one
---
They're rolling out seasons today 
---
*please*
---
they can't even get it to work currently as it is
---
I know on some online games, ffxiv and swtor, people will report your name as offensive to steal the name.
---
The most consistent node that I’ve found during SBQ is the one that spawns in the ruined house with the windmill. It has a trench running through the middle of it, and there is often an ultracite deposit there ready to be tapped.
---
I have a First Subscription so I thought I might've been hacked and someone was getting some free content on my pay.
---
This is simply not a PVP game.
---
Balancing and gunplay are horrible for pvp standards and nothing in this game is really designed with pvp in mind. Im honestly supprised that there are even people who WANT to play this kind of content. There are tons of better games for survival PVP, like rust, ark, tarkov, dayz, hunt:Showdown etc etc
---
Just the fact that it breaks in seconds and costs a shitload of Ballistic Weave to repair makes it a rarely used item for me. If I'm going for the stealth, I'm just gonna use a Stealth Boy...
---
kill'em
---
i want to load my punchbowl up with nuka shine but its too expensive. Nuka shine is a fun adventure.
---
Lol this just made me die laughing
---
Those prefixes cannot drop together.
---
Crazy...Country Roads started playing on the radio as I started reading this post. The feels.
---
Aww. That would've been so cool.
---
edit-
---
nm i read that totally wrong
---
Bloodied and Instigating are both Prefix stars
---
Any idea when it's going to be fixed ?
---
Sad thing is that it is several of their games. Tried Fallout 4 and the mods and creation club are down. Tried ESO and it was down. Wtf Bethesda.
---
Exact same issue on Xbox rn
---
Lol sorry.  It was not a waste of his or her time, then, so that he or she could create the post.  By the way totally agree with you that you have to read something to know it was a waste of time.
---
They are first perks so don't go together. Bloodied, instigating, furious, junkies, etc.
---
Todds boyfriends are downvoting you , take my upvote
---
Oh, that makes sense because of how OP it would be.
---
Making names department
---
They are [working on it](https://twitter.com/BethesdaSupport/status/1273700231830548480?s=19)
---
Game machine broke have a good day
---
If you want a revive, at least not in water, go do the Mothman event at the lighthouse. I was wearing the tadpole uniform and someone threw themselves off the lighthouse for me to get an easy revive for the quest! I never even asked, as I don't use a mic, but it was super cool of them to just know!
---
different devs, different engine, different studios. yes, they are under the same parent company, but you seem to be under the mistaken impression that fixes and features of both games are easily compatible; they aren't. 
---
ZOS made a new engine for ESO, it's completely different to previous TES and fallout games
---
funny I don't feel lucky...I mean, I have Woopsie after all.
---
I have never saw in my life a company that keeps adding new content to a game or project, or whatever when there are major issues with their product. I still cannot find normal explanation about Bethesda behaviour. I am also huge fan of fallout series. Started with FO2 but .... somehow more and more disappointing with FO76. :( Maybe my expectations were too high ... I kinda feel lost already. Trying to be objective and if so...then it is very clear: The game is bad! Technically, mechanically, design and even end game is not satisfying. It is not a problem to be tolerant and wait. It is not a problem to accept and understand that They need time because it is their first experience with multiplayer platform. But somehow that  serves as good excuse for everything. It just not right Bethesda... it just not ok.
---
Not as cool as a bloodied instigating two-shot explosive tho!!!
---
Me too.
---
Also, is the SS armor considered a heavy armor?
---
I just got that as well. It must be happening to everybody
---
Good luck. People are awful
---
I'm just tired of dealing with weight management every 2 minutes at full health. Every little thing you pickup or every quest reward makes you overweight, after an hour of this bologna gameplay you want to shove the full health build where sun don't shine.
---
relationship goals
---
Breath and look at previously posted submissions.
---
If only. I can dream

This is how meny bugs are in the game lol
---
PS4 and getting unknown server error [3:0:844424930263042] message.
---
I remember some level 500 dude got mad at me for seemingly no reason during the caravan event- he went up in my face and started doing thumbs down emotes and stuff. I gave him a thumbs up, then he went out of his way to disable his pacifist mode and oneshot me, then immediately left the server. I was like lv20 or something, only pvp i've ever had in the game 😂
---
They lite up for me
---
wHaT wIlL I dO iF i CaN't PlAy FaLlOuT?!?!
---
It means you’ve been banned for having a small...nevermind...just look at the other posts.
---
it just takes a bit of fiddling to make sure the target spot is in view, the 200mm lens has saved me a few times when i went sprinting into the raider camp forgetting to take a photo of the crops and being too lazy to walk back
---
Sometimes I do get killed in seconds, sometimes I don't.. Idc if I get killed a few times, if I get them once. Even getting close is fun. Junk really isn't that valuable.. I lose way more shit from the server dropping me on events than from pvp. This player base is just weak and doesn't like to be exposed.
---
Much easier to just mow down npcs with pathing issues and think your a big tough guy, I guess.
---
I don’t know about you guys but for my level 58 noob self, going from 200 5.56 to 5k is a pretty big jump.
---
Why is weight management different for bloodied vs full hp?
---
There's not that much irreplaceable stuff to be honest. It's mostly things like quest rewards and outfits which you only get once. I've brought loads of responder outfits from vendors which aren't rare, everyone gets them, but you can't get them again. Any outfit you get from an event or quest it's worth at least googling or asking on here. 
---
 Probably worth adding not to mindlessly spam sell at vendors. The UI is very ropey and you could easily sell something you want to keep. It won't necessarily lose you the item but it will a lot of caps.
---
[This](https://youtu.be/cya1i-81Fys) guy explains it perfectly. If you want to skip the code and only worry about the keycard, use [Nukacrypt](https://nukacrypt.com/home)
---
Bro it's my birthday today wtf I just wanna play fallout
---
I dont think so..
---
mostly the amount of players (PC) is quite big that cannot login into game. So stay calm.
---
Livid
---
Not mad, just disappointed
---
If you are making a post about this, you could at the same time ask if someone will help you with the revive a player part. I mean...just saying.
---
Down in Atl and Nyc.
---
Right before the servers went down and I was booted out, I got an unwelcome surprise.
---
I was in Fort McClintock looking for Ammo Bags when a quest popped up: Recruitment Blues.
---
WTF?! I *did* Recruitment Blues. Finished it. Got the military ID on me. Went to the top floor of the elevator and through the grid. Done. Never to set foot in the DMV again. Done. Over with. Right?
---
But it’s back?!
---
Asking me to do basic training again.
---
There goes my evening. FML.
---
You tried out the Turbo Ferts yet? Really bloody handy.
---
pretty sure there are couriers on the discord / subreddit that shall not be named (because mentioning it gets my comments removed for some reason) that will do it for free, they're reputable.
---
I'm quite curious about this but not sure whether to enquire here or start a new post?
---
If it is I want a bloodied bloodied weapon.
---
Your mom/gf/s.o. comes to mind....
---
In regards to the crafting I will agree as somebody who sided with the Raiders to get the Gauss minigun I have crafted roughly about 30 of them to try to get one that I like ranging everything from a one-star medic to what I have now is a 3-star executioner with that being said I feel that we should be able to determine the number of Stars based on how many modules we want to add to it
---
Wait, what are servers?
---
No, ammo for 1 cap. If you sell you ammo for more then 1 cap I'm gonna take over your workshop
---
Best response to the server wide shut down I've seen.
---
Let this be the way
---
I'm not mad.  Just disappointed :(
---
If you like disease use radaway.  Then you get disease if something looks at you funny.  Seriously, I get disease by shooting things.  And don't get me started on the water pump.  Every.  Single.  Time.  I think my ally is shoving turds up in it.

---
Bold of you to suggest anything that isnt add more script or buillon per day
---
If you’d like I can play through it with my new toon and take pictures for you. I really don’t know myself but now I am curious. lol
---
That sucks but guess it's time to fire up nms or rdr2
---
I can't seem to log on, do you know if the servers are down?
---
It’s all about them bone clubs

bloodied and instigating are both primary attributes., meaning they only drop on the 1st star

And 90% damage reduction.

A bit annoyed? I'll rage. No-one messes with my free atoms.

I know just the one. Thank you! And best of all that house is out of the way of scorchbeasts most of the time so no annoying surprise visits.

Cooking some thick and creamy Macaroni, so I am not mad in the slightest. Get like me nerds.

When the game is back up could you please share a screenshot taken at night? If the gasmask looks bright enough I think I might get that bundle, then.

Definitely sart a new post. Maybe if we all post we may get the answers we are looking for!

Huh news to me

Glad i’m stuck at work today woof

That would be great! Please let me know what you find, thanks!

Hey, they know how to nerf with a hotfix lol
---
Unknown server error here on PS4
---
Well I can already earn that. I have the some of the best weapons and armor now so more scrip and bullion really isn't much incentive.
---
Beth's community sites are down too, looks like their server farm shat itself.
---
Broken things in a Bethesda game?! Non sense! It just works!!
---
Don't get mad, get GLAD, with new GLAD press and seal!.. for your leftovers

only you are getting toddbanned today.

Maybe you're shooting robots in the head? Protectrons and Assaultrons are heavily armoured in the head, torso is weak spot.
---
lol unfortunately it’s not just 76. Seems most if not all their games have their online stuff down right now.
---
I little disappointed. I was going to launch a few nukes and test out something, but at least I managed to do my dailies and scrip/gold for the day, so could be worse.
---
Trust me I know reddit though on the hand...
---
youre gonna get the plasma hose with that talk.
---
Please no. The game has enough comedy weapons already.
---
That's an invalid error code.
---
I believe it's Up, down, at the start.

Maybe it was intented for him to do so, to keep said balance with the light and dark it was his sole purpose to bring the number of light users in line with the dark..

Maybe he was the chosen one this whole time, all the light users were so scared that they tryed to sway his choice and continue the domination of light over dark and keep the system unbalanced.
---
lol
---
Same here. As a mostly solo player who takes a lot of care with my camp, I don't accept random invites for two reasons, one I don't want people messing with my camp and two, I don't want to get dragged into PvP unless I chose to. The fact that they addressed both of these while still allowing private teams to help build each other's bases (or fill them with toilets) is very good news.
---
meh.. Im not really concerned about it...
---
just killing time till the shits back up yo
---
It always happens to me, whenever I try and use the weapon wheel when both in and out of combat my game practically freezes. This has led to countless deaths as while I’m trying use the weapon wheel the game will freeze, leaving me open to be bombarded with attacks from floaters. I’m as well on Xbox.
---
Honestly though I wish they’d fix this along with the Stanley mod. I haven’t been able to use my Grognaks in months now. Plus it’s been months since I got any daily from my ally. I tried doing the others and they’d get stuck at some point to. Irritating.
---
No I was just asking if it was worth getting just to have or if I should hold off. To my knowledge its listed as "non power aroumr"
---
Stupid question, did you make sure all your volume sliders didn’t get turned all the way down in the game settings?
---
Edit: NVM I missed that at item #2 on your list.
---
Thanks for the help. I wouldn't say I'm new to Fallout 76, but I am fairly new to legendary effects. I wasn't sure how they worked. I knew it was too good to be true.
---
Whoa now; let's not get drastic. We know Reddit isn't capable of such a task!
---
i got kicked just about 10min now I was so happy that I had finished the rose quests, I hope we don't get rollbacks, she is annoying
---
I will and I will post pictures so you can see it.
---

The quest at Al's Tattoo is repeatable.  So far I've learned (and stocked in the punchbowl) Nukashine, Lead Champagne, Rad Ant Lager, and High Voltage Hefe.
---
Solid (actual) advice amid the memes. Easy to forget that people largely don’t do this for one reason or another. 
---
I mean, people still deserve ridicule for not using a single ounce of common sense when they have an error of any kind and not exploring even for 2 minutes on their own initiative, before feeling out and/or posting, but still.
---
Of course it won’t help because if people can’t search for an actual issue they aren’t gonna see this, but you know, I appreciate the effort and thought.
---
Thank you!!!
---
Was this a ddos attack on Bethesda’s server from the pvp “resistance” after the ITV came out?
---
had the same problem, and have helped others resolve it since, as i cant find the post that helped me, so try this:  
---
go to windows sound settings for the unit used (i personally only had the problem with my headset and not my speakers, so went to settings for the headset) as follows:  [https://imgur.com/a/3PHd5ED](https://imgur.com/a/3PHd5ED)   
---
as you see i have put the settings at 48k dvd quality. was originally set for 44.1k CD quality. no idea why, but that fixed the problem for me and many others.
---
I'm waiting for rust on console to jump ship because deep down I know you're right.. But, I still wanted that from Fallout, because I love Fallout and it makes so much sense in the world to have pvp. Some people are asshole some are friendly.. Raiders and Settlers.. Idk why people think it's so weird that anyone wanted that in here.
---
let me get this straight, you guys on pc cant message other players??? no chat box? nothing?
---
Very much appreciated.
---
I have 1 rank of goat legs and bird bones mutation which you want regardless and it's practically impossible to die from fall damage even bloodied.
---
sounds like youre already leveled up past much of this but..
---
also..if you want quest rewards to be max level you dont really want to progress too far into the main story until youre lvl 50
---
not everyone cares about the levels of those rewards.. some people collect them.. some level with them... YMMV
---
**-eta : Id be hitting up the ash heap discovering all the areas and doing as many events as you can there and in the toxic valley to start getting some rudimentary legendary gear or PA if you use it..**
---
**youre just getting to the good zone as far as unlocking perks goes so things are all downhill from where youre at**
---
Just to let you know: the servers are down...
---
:P
---
i rocked 3D glasses with gladiator helmet(or NW beanie) and mr claus outfit last xmas. all glasses work with the gladiator helmet and ghillie hood. medical smile mask looks great with the googly eye glasses
---
One day I will really get a mic and turn on local chat, I never have, scared of the other.
---
you have angered [todd](https://imgur.com/gallery/DHjjU/comment/1197928035) and will feel his wrath. 
---
please by skyrim again.
---
Thick and creamy, you say?
---
I tried all of them yesterday. Can't say I enjoyed it, but it had to be done.  
---
It was working fine with 192k@24 before I wiped the drive.
---
Radiation rumble, i usually walk away with about 75-100 per event
---
I fixed it before you made your post. And I only posted it once. I can't take credit for any other assery that you have seen today, sir.
---
Don't thank for patience, not all of us have that. Fix your shit.
---
Trading was **NEVER** promised in Destiny, get your facts straight.
---
I just got a Two- Shot Gauss Shot Gun and can confirm,  its very godly. Putting out 428 DMG and not even specd in shotguns.
---
Sounds really nice, I do appreciate well thought out camps even though I'm too inept and lazy to do it myself.
---
Kinda frustrated seeing as I literally just walked in the door from work to this shit. Seriously wtf
---
Nope, one of the youtubers just did something on it last week you can mod the hell out the tesla but it doesn't change the perks affecting it.
---
Just like my parents...smh.
---
Totally.
---
So the servers ARE down!.. I had my suspicions I'll admit
---
ive never gotten it as a drop but...i found it for sell in some camps 3 times for 2k-2.5k and 5k...so you might as well server hop and look into vendors, ur chances are much better if you ask me
---
Thank you for posting, Love hearing stories like this!
---
It's craftable legendary.  If I want a troubleshooters set one day I can just craft hundreds of pieces until I get it.
---
Legendary modules are sort of how you can bank scrip.
---
ah, sample rate and bit depth. my bad. shit, then i have no clue. did you restart the game in between changing them?
---
ESO is up for me. Still no fallout though.
---
The newest invention in the world of Kraft brand Macaroni. Only trust the blue box! Now in Thick and Creamy style!
---
For real though, its delicious.
---
just crashed. same as everybody else
---
They dont lite like an head lamp , just a litle bit but for the price its worth it
---
I just claimed a workshop and a couple minutes later the servers crash. Fucking incredible
---
Good thing we have this post to move the ones about server issues further down
---
Where’s Valseek when we need him!
---
For leveling, I would just sleep in a bed for +5%, take some workshops on the west side of the map, maybe 6 or 7, ignore the defend events and do the Retake Events, Keep an eye on the map for events that other people are doing and join n on that as well, it's good xp. If you have issues with ammo, wearing a cheapo suit of raider power armour and going 2h melee with a multi-purpose axe or Fire axe works well.   
---
Most of my early game issues were keeping my shit repaired, so look out for Adhesive, leather, rubber and screws, those are pretty commonly used up in armour and weapon repairs.
---
Not without mods
---
careful with suggestion posts.. had 4 of them removed for no reason and mods not answering why :)
---
We all got it. Something broke at Bethesda again...
---
I have 96 hours in the game. I finished the main quest and im level 40. The only things left to do are explore around, find a few cool things for the base (most of which I have) and find a quest or two. I have maybe...25-50 hours left until its no longer fun. They really do need to add more content. Its been 2 years, the current state of the game should have been what it was on release.
---
Please see the other 200 posts about this.
---
blocker negates 45% of melee damage.. of which youre mostly taking since youre standing right on top of mobs all the time
---
CSA maybe for the SBQ?
---
Also forgot select
---
this
---
I'm honestly highly amused over the number of people that have expressed relief that the servers were down, and they hadn't been banned.  Like... wtf are all these people doing that makes them expect to suddenly be hit by the ban-hammer ?
---
 [https://bethesda.net/en/status](https://bethesda.net/en/status)

:o
---
Or make it where you can send other players items or money like ESO.
---
I'll take "Shit That Never Happened" for $500, Alex.
---
Servers have issues at the moment, not just you.
---
&gt; I’ve seen SO many threads saying they can’t login or severs are down
---
So you decided to make your own thread about the very same topic.  LOL
---
I didnt either but I made a TON this game is great for it
---
Glowing blood packs help radiation resistance, like Rad-X, without the mutation inhibiting effects
---
Radshields are easy to farm, I have like 40 from one hour of hopping.  Glowing Blood packs help too.  Make sure you are using blocker, Fireproof 3, Serendipity, nerd rage. Lifegiver 4 will give you magic health.
---
It's about the caps as well... Lost 200 once, that wasn't so great
---
THIS IS JUSTICE
---
Most likely "automated" flagging. Maybe thay "mommy" part caused it. I suppose there are plenty of "creative" users, who find it very amusing to make a juvenile joke and name their account "MommyShagger" or "MommyPoker"  etc.
---
BTW, I love salami! Esp. spicy ones :D
---
This is a little less serious than outright cheating with hacks or duping things into oblivion..if they haven’t yet banned all the actual cheaters and cheated items I’d be surprised if they issued any bans at all over cheesing that rep honestly.
---
In the beginning I restarted just the game itself, later restarted the whole computer after each change. I knew it'd be pointless, but it's Windows :D You never know.
---
Yes 100%
---
Sneaking is your best defence with bloodied, less getting shot at and that crisp sneak damage bonus, also diluted rad x will eliminate the rads the queen gives off (except for when she screams)
---
The servers are down
---
Do you have evidence to back up your comment? We are all going crazy here. WE NEED ANSWERS!! 😂😝
---
Yep. Shouldn't have duped

Not from bethesda but you should be banned from reddit for posting something that’s been asked and answered 1000 in the last 20 minutes.
---
Servers down. Damn!
---
Yes, that's a way to do this as well. I did always use these for my normal armor, especially the Stand Fast.
---
Ha!
---
Probably, but maybe you can find the solution reading any of the 300000 post created 30 min ago
---
Servers are down, they’re fixing a bug where players were able to log in and complete quests and events.
---
Dude, use the search function. Can mods start removing these please?
---
Juat woke up. Was gonna do the dailies. Todd trolling again...
---
Yes, you've been banned.
---
Banned form using search to see that you are the 80th person to ask that in the last hour.
---
I can't/refuse to read.
---
Anything is possible man.
---
Time for more downvotes?
---
4000 posts? Seems like a minority of the community to me so there is in fact not enough evidence to make such a ludicrous statement.
---
NANI?!
---
That's a bad one.  Not only are you banned, they're going to send someone to confiscate your console and/or pc too.
---
Just how I like vagina lips
---
Haha that will be a fight to see!
---
RNG Jesus likes them more than he does you.
---
Yup, enjoy your life time ban for being you.
---
You mean this? https://bethesda.net/en/dashboard
---
That was an excellent read, thanks for taking the time.
---
You could I think repost this as a PSA and I think it would be quite useful to those that read it.
---
You have confirmed for me these reports of camp damage are from people or a team member in an unknown PVP state  from the reasons you described.
---
Thanks again and take care 👍
---
On Xbox I have the same issue. In order to fix it I have to have a headset connected. Then the audio should turn on. I mute them and no sound come through them but they just have to be connected for unbeknownst reason.
---
Thru hiker or grocers mod
---
Servers down for a few of their games. They were having intermittent connection issues and pulled this and TES offline for maintenance.
---
All bad excuses to maintain an illusion of power when it comes to pvp against someone 1/3 your level, imo.
---
I'm not one of these people trying to fight lowbies, I swing up 100% of the time.. And get called a griefer. It's pathetic.
---
Servers are down
---
Also diluted radx won't affect mutations
---
Same!  I immediately thought 'Should have set up 2FA'.
---
Bethesda's servers went down
---
Ur banned yea they are finnally cleaning up people who can read the rules
---
A friend of mine gave me his 3 star executioners double barrel a while ago and that thing is pretty OP when using Vats. +50% limb damage, 250% damage resist when reloading and +50% damage if target is below 40% health. He didn't use it because he thought it was trash and now it serves me instead
---
The master bug finally has claimed its throne.
---
Maybe the mods need to sticky these things.  Of course people are going to post about it.  Best to have it all in one thread.
---
niiiicce
---
My main char is a sneaky sniper who initially started questing up through the Morgantown stuff, and then I read that quest rewards scaled to 50. Welp, that was it for quests! I did a lotttt of exploring, just booping around the map, ending up in the Mire at some insanely low level, etc. The funny thing is, I hit 50, went "oh right I can quest now"... and kept exploring for a while.
---
I have 8 playable characters and two mules. After having pushed a bunch through get-to-50-any-way-other-than-questing and a few going the just-quest-anyways-lol route, my highest levels are back to booping around the map exploring. I still have quests undone, hell, my main just finished the old endgame quest chain in her early 90's, and my highest level is 121 and still has quite a few side quests and I'm guessing most of Wastelanders to go (and a bunch of my chars have barely touched the expansion content if they've done any at all)... and I really don't care to push it any faster. I'll get 'er done when I get 'er done. Meanwhile I'm currently playing a Legion-bound sniper in Fallout New Vegas, so '76 is mildly derailed at the moment.
---
Ok. It is worth it, but I was wondering if it was considered a heavy armor?
---
Swing badadadada!
---
Sorry this my first time even using this subreddit. Also calm down I was just asking a question.
---
I looked at twitter too..
---
had to LOL @ "intermittent"
---
It's a glitch, it only happens when the owner of the camp is within his/her camp
---
K i shall kill him so i dont have to suffer the fate you did
---
There should be a stickied post on the servers being down.
---
Hi Brotato,
---
Bethesda is actually an established company.  They have been around awhile and have released many games.
---
I'm not convinced thats the problem yet, still hoping for more inquiries from fellow redditors.
---
They get even better if u have instigating or bloodied
---
Yeooo I'm so glad I wasn't in when it happened I would've freaked out
---
Tell me about it, I was rearranging everything and got kicked off!
---
[yes](https://imgur.com/gallery/DHjjU/comment/1197928035)
---
Even i thought it while i wrote it haha
---
Add sneaking and blocker to your build, for radiation pop a radshield and for SB damage fireproof is your friend.
---
80th?  800th, at least
---
I signed upto fallout 1st last night for the first time just got home from work to play and boom..... Its off!
---
What you don't want to get a nocturnal bashing damage junk jet from the queen?
---
SAME like omgggg
---
There's no reason why they couldn't make it so it switches automatically if you have all the Commando/Rifleman perks bought. 
---
Same for Guerilla/Gunslinger and One/Two-handed.
---
If I woke my boyfriend up to me screaming at a video game, he would be pissed and grumpy.  🤣
---
This link better send me to some weird shit.
---
If you cant beat 'em, join 'em.
---
Has red dead online had anymore updates?
---
Do they require certain perks? Laser turrets, for example, need Science and Home Defense.
---
"Better not"
---
Games rated M for mature should not have any kind of name censoring unless it's racist or sexist. Especially since they can't seem to even comprehend what is offensive or not.
---
I suggest you send in a support ticket about it, and keep sending one a day until you get a real response from someone. Most likely you will get an automated email the first time, but keep at it and you'll get their attention. Chances are it's something stupid like a salami is considered phallic by some dumb fuck, and they will realize the mistake and clear it up. I hope it works out!
---
They skipped the sunday prayer to Todd Howard.

Little Bobby Tables strikes again!

Shit if you still have a plan I'll trade you

About to hit the usual time i log on for my session. How mad am i? So so. Thinking fuck it i shall go play one of the other ten billion games i have not got round to playing yet.
---
being on zero is quite good for this sub :)
---
Translation: several hours
---
1001 now
---
I swear I have seen this code before? 🤔
---
Status page mow shows Fallout 76 down
---
I mean, technically this is more a general suggestion, the reasoning behind posting it now is the part you quoted and was not the main point of the post.
---
What was the test?
---
thanks ❤️
---
A lot of it really is perk card dependent, but at your level you have not a lot of choice yet. What can really help out is legendary items. I would join the leader of the pack event that happens west of vault 76. When you kill the boss wolf or complete the event you should get a legendary that should fit your level. Also some ally daily events will reward you with a legendary weapon, so complete the ally quests completely and they’ll give you daily quests.
---
Also drugs are a helluva thing.
---
😝
---
i dont think he was saying each pellet should do the same damage as a "bullet" just that each pellet should be doing the base damage of the weapon, also "less mass than a bullet" isn't really how it works, its all dependant on what type of shot is being fired and could very well match and do as much damage as a traditional "bullet" (slugs or any sabot round) and in fallout 00 buckshot is used which are def bigger than BB's and would be a lot more effective than the damage that we are given
---
 nerd rage, dodgy, and that one luck skill that has you avoiding damage with low health. Serendipity or something
---
Maybe last time you used a mod and didn’t craft it with a plan?
---
When they manage to finally get to the pet shop for some more hamsters.
---
Do you have the required perks equiped? I think it requires the following:
---
Science rank 4
---
Armorer rank 4
---
Huh. not what I was expecting to see.
---
you don't need to equip them again, when the turrets are stored.
---
Not a damned thing. It's pretty frustrating, sometimes.
---
Farm? Where?
---
Wait,  I'm not banned? Just kidding
---
Players should **never** be able to log in and complete quests and events!
---
The current system totally screws over all the players who don't log in. Not to mention all the people who don't buy the game.  What about them?
---
Not fair or balanced!
---
im getting  "an unknown server error occured. please try again later:  3:0:844424930263042" and am panicking since someone dropped me a gift yesterday and i guess it might have been a duplicate item??? but how am i supposed to know that T\_T 
---
is this a common issue or am i gonna get fucked by bethesda for other people's bullshit?
---
Blocker in Strength and Evasive in addition to or instead of Dodgy
---
But Why..... Why would you say that!!!
---
💀  Lmaooo
---
That'll get you every time.  They should be worried.
---
What about his cat? You should never hurt a cat!
---
I've just tried this by plugging in a random USB sound card before and while the game is running, still no sound in the menu.
---
My bad I was reading it as if you were saying power armour sorry. I dont know what the actual classification is...light/heavy/sturdy
---
servers being dumb as always
---
I was being 100% sarcastic. Of course they are big, of course they have a status page, and of course Redditors should go there first before flooding subs with lazy posts asking if the servers are down.
---
Dumb as always.
---
trade for Uny Cavalier pieces. the damage reduction helps a ton
---
Beth servers across the board are down.
---
Well thanks for letting me know everyone.
---
So am I, your father.
---
Nope, you're banned
---
Rumor is they were doing a server side install of MFA and it crashed everything. Just rumor. Probably just wonky servers
---
No, where can I get a plan etc?
---
Last weekend I dropped a few nukes to farm. First Whitespring to pick up all the non-flux materials. Then I was on the hunt for mainly violet flux, so I dropped on General’s Steakhouse and Harper’s Ferry (so I could decide which one was best for future use).
---
General’s Steakhouse (or slightly SW of it) won hands down. Sooo much violet flux and loads of nasties to kill to pick up materials. I was very happy with that. Harper’s Ferry wasn’t as good in comparison, there’s an OK amount of flux, but not too many nasties. And as others have said the ghouls in The Burrows are glowing, but don’t drop flux materials so it’s a bit of a waste.
---
Maybe, I honestly can't remember it was that long ago but can't check for sure till the servers are back up and running.
---
Never thought of that, cheers
---
also trying to find solutions, and one of the bugs associated with this is with the "voice chat mode" setting ingame. if its set to auto it can be bugged out, but try changing it to "team" instead. apparently this has been around since launch of the game, but it might work for ya.   
---
gotta wait for servers to test it though.
---
i dont get this, they created a freakin mmo and they forgot the chatbox? 
---
theres a few things i dont understand about this game and thats a big one
---
I wonder how many people are actually gonna check to see if the numbers are different?
---
This is my worry, I have no idea if I’ve picked up or bought something that’s been duplicated.
---
Hmm interesting
---
I wonder how much he regrets saying that
---
What would you consider the best?
---
Oh i see, thank you.
---
Aaaaw man that sucks lmao
---
servers are down
---
Gotcha
---
Welcome to Fallout 76!
---
Great
---
Ya gotta craft them iirc
---
lol nice I never thought about it that way
---
Agreed. Adding some new cosmetic versions of outfits in the game would be a great incentive to run events that aren't popular atm.
---
Heck, add the purveyors loot pool like fasnacht had and give me even more reason.
---
Yiiiikes everyone damn
---
Someone said they managed to get loads of high radiation fluids from nuking west tek and farming an ultracite node to get mobs to respawn again, and again. Was going to try that, then somehwere else with an iron ore node to see if it's all nodes.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hbgbat/a_tip_for_farming_infinite_easy_mode_high/
---
I guess that's an option, but all 15 points I have in agility are filled with better perks, so I'd rather not sacrifice something like adrenaline. They also seem to have tweaked/nerfed bird bones and it no longer reduces fall damage. 
---
Honestly, after playing with the jet pack for a couple weeks I just didn't see the point, so I swapped it out for a dense mod instead.
---
I thought it was my connection
---
I can’t because this is before it is explained to place the console. The console doesn’t exist yet. She is still in the shelter and the interaction to continue her quest doesn’t work.
---
Oh, thanks then. Should I delete the post? I saw there's a lot like this one and I'm pretty new in this sub.
---
Yeah, a dragon weighs 7.8, a weightless dragon weighs 2.4, so there must be a bunch of mods on the weightless one /s
---
Same here. Probably just Bathesda being Bathesda..
---
The fact that I have now read 12 minutes back just to get here I think that we all indeed are going crazy!! 🙊🙉🙈 
---
But Just a side note: Uh Dose anyone know if the servers are down?? 🤔🕵
---
But her damn headaches, wouldn't want to put HER through that
---
/s
---
I'm on PC and my server just went down, glad it wasn't just me!
---
You sir, are hilarious
---
haha I'm pretty new to all of it too honestly idk if wait for a higher up to tell us what to do lol
---
If THIS is the hardest thing for you to believe, 76 has a lot of things in store for ya.
---
If you mean for the legendary perks, it's heavy, scout is light :-)
---
when they're stored, you should be able to place them again, regardless of who built them (&amp; with which perks equipped).
---
sometimes me &amp; a few friends are not able to place those items, too. but for us closing the building menu always helped.
---
Same for me, I was worried for if someone stole my account or something else
---
You are a hero and keep getting the new wastelanders like myself drunk! Nukashine isn't really a problem since it's a free trip back to Vault 76. Although waking up next to a bunch of high level upset Cultists was a surprise on my 3rd Nuka-trip.... That scrap was just gone as there was no way I could recover that death!
---
probably 2/3 of days I don't get roxy's find-a-raider-retirement quest. I always get the overseer's robot take a picture quest. I usually get Ward's quest but not always.
---
I've been playing since launch and this is the first time I've ever had the servers go down unexpectedly. So  not sure what you're talking about.
---
Sigh. No trust these days.
---
The menu works to some extent, I can change settings and check by listening if I have music in the menu. Played a bit with that setting and nothing changed.
---
Now what am I supposed to do?
---
Haha, ok then, thanks again!
---
Apologies if i missed this, but have they confirmed that these public teams will be available on private worlds? 
---
I'd love to have that feature open to friends popping in and out all day :)
---
Oh! I didn't think Biv was actually serious when he said come back tomorrow. I will have to go get more recipes then! Thanks!!!!
---
Samual sells them once you hit Ally. You can craft them and also set up a contraption that makes them, one at a time, at your Camp. You can also Trade/Sell them. I've also managed to free up a fair amount of Camp Budget by removing Crops and only keeping just one plant for each thing that I need. Nice. And it's like a big smelly fart cloud when it goes off. Double Nice.
---
the real question now is.. 
---
what ridiculous thing is the community going to demand in compensation for this grave injustice?
---
Im all for whatever the mob decides.. but Id appreciate if yall would consider demanding MEAT Week.. Primal Cuts yo!
---
How long tillfix
---
Dead!!😂😂
---
cool but itll fuck over melee characters even more than her slam attack already does
---
Me too.  Still trying to track down Tick Blood Tequila tho...
---
But we want to show you, in return, that we also want to be friendly! :)
---
Yup... Fallout 1st gets a major nerf in Patch 20.  At this point its a sub for a scrap box... may not be worth it.
---
TSE and role play in the same sentence seems kind of contradictory but we get what ya mean.
---
i'v not swapped items over to my alt just because of the paranoia of losing shit i'v earned over time due to either a bug, another player or straight up not being able to get to the server, screw that stress &gt;&lt;
---
Same error code here in the US (still).
---
A long shot but open the Fallout76.ini * file to see whether under [Audio] bEnableAudio = 1 . If this is set to 0 or the command is missing audio could be disabled. 
---
If this doesn't work request the problem to be escalated to Level 2 support or post directly on Bethesda Fallout 76 Forums.
---
And that's why
---
Yeah, I had about maybe 7 minutes of being chomped on by 3 diseased hatchlings (while I had low disease resistance) before I got it (was just about to give up), any other disease and it seems like the enemy just has to shake my hand and I'll get it.
---
Thanks fam, I try.
---
Seasons and atom store confirmed for skyrim, fo4 etc
---
But seriously, I don’t want or need anything.
---
Tod giveth, tod taketh away.
---
My mom warned me about people on the internets!
---
True. It starts off very exciting and then just falls flat on its face. Just like every other bit of narrative in the game.
---
PC...Slovakia, Europe.  Nothing works.:(
---
Ah thanks. Im at about 3/4 of last bar to get to Ally. Raider already maxed. Thanks. Me too, only crops I have are melons and gourds, so this could help me get rid of some crops. Thanks dude.
---
If you’re on PS4 and IF the servers ever come back up I’ll be happy to give you the plan.
---
What's it like having a wife?
---
They’ve been there since NW launched, so I wouldn’t expect them to go away.
---
ESO has this feature and its a bethesda owned game.
---
i mean come on
---
All Bethesda servers are currently down, not just 76
---
Took me about 25 levels to realize that originally, felt like a right idiot when I found out!
---
Lol. Not surprised but still disappointing🤔 Maybe they just forgot they were scheduled to show gameplay!
---
Been playing since release. I just recognize an attention whore when I see one.
---
Must be, since it affects Doom and ESO as well.
---
As far as I remember it doesn't have a category yet unless they recently changed that on the PTS.
---
Belgium here, definitely not a thing here.
---
I do the same thing. To prevent that I just do the heart emote and sprint tf away lmao
---
Servers are down because you touch yourself.
---
The instability of the Wasteland daily chores has saved me, as I gave up bothering and just bumble about doing random stuff.
---
Don't keep us hanging man, who won?
---
I usually give out stuff because I don't use it. I'm level 175 and 260. I have healing factor so I really don't need more than 30 stimpacks and you get a ton from blood eagles and cultists now. Shielded suits I sell for 900 caps but usually have a couple not for sale to give away.
---
Would this affect bethesda.net also?
---
Unfortunately not on ps4 as far as i can tell, you can block the guy of the bat, but i cant send a direct message without adding to friends first... pain in the ass tbh.
---
I thought nobody was watching!
---
Edit: time to come clean. I did know Todd was watching, and I liked it.
---
I have found this to be the exact opposite lol
---
wait, it says your post has been removed. how are we still posting XD?
---
If you try to build that type in any other tab but "Stored", it won't let you. Try doing it from the "Stored" tab of your C.A.M.P. and see if that changes anything!
---
Do we have mods  to stop people from spamming the same posts
---
Don't spend a lot on the mic unless you're gonna use it- mine collects dust 98% of the time. 
---
But I've never switched area chat off just in case I bump into someone organically and for the past year and a half it has just been the rare heavy breather who forgot he was "on air" so you can switch it on no fear. 
---
Everyone I have ever spoken to was super polite- even the kiddos. I'm sure some ppl have gotten into fights but its easy to nip that shit in the bud.
---
Yes the servers were down but instead of the error code saying that there was a server error the message read something to the affect that  made you think you had banned. Lol. Can't remember the exact wording though.
---
Try to replace one of your unyielding pieces with a lifesaving one. You will melt things like before and also will have a "in case of emergency" pasive effect
---
Pft, that's amateur hour. I want a bloodied instigating bloodied bloodied.
---
LOL 😁 I guess it's a matter of taste, but thank you. ✌️
---
Xbox :( but that doesn't change the fact you still the MVP
---
I think the lowest level PA parts are 15, and heavy guns are level 25 base to start, at least as far as LMG and 50 cal go. I'm guessing that's why the Heavy Perks don't kick in until 30, because of the higher level starting of weapons. Just go with whatever melee weapon you get early on that's good to supplement your strength build.
---
how did you know
---
With unyielding armor pieces at low health you get additional Strength points, on top of that Radicool perk card can give additional +5 strength points. You can see where this is going :)
---
Carry capacity of bloodied builds can get to ridiculous numbers.
---
dsp?
---
I want the deliverer from 4, 'that gun' from NV and and the Chinese pistol from 3 xD
---
Well you might need to get your eyes checked friend. If you've been here since release, you'll know that this is far from the most bizarre true story to happen in the history of the game. But, no argument will sate you so I'll leave you to your beliefs.
---
" I can find nothing in the TOS or other terms and conditions banning the use of lunch-meat related, rhyming names for usernames."  LOL  Have an upvote.
---
I find the best "with a view" spots tend to be too far from water, so when I find a really nice "with a vew" spot, I use the purifier that requires dirt. It's not as good as the big open-water one but three or four of 'em do the job decently enough depending on how often I visit my camp and how much water I actually want.
---
I did wonder how I just picked up an explosive laser on my dragonknight.
---
same issue, switched from a trouble shooters limb damage to a medics explosive and for some reason it sucks compaired to the previous one even when the tooltip damage is higher and explosive = AoE limb damage, it cripples far quicker than it deals damage even though 50% limb damage could not cripple fast enough... talk about WTF logic
---
Appreciate the help
---
Not a problem man, I still don’t know what all of them mean. When people start substituting just numbers. I can figure it out if I’m looking at the list but it still makes the hamster cage start spinning
---
But I don't know that, and I wouldn't mind you being generous to me in the future. So how am I supposed to show you my appreciation now? :)
---
Thanks, I'll get a cheap one, I'll try turning on area chat and see if anything happens.
---
I was on eso and I’m the servers went down so I hopped on 76 and those were down too, I think it may be all Bethesda servers
---
Well it's a good thing they're adding group finder in the next patch
---
We would like if our characters name would display in game vs our account name.
---
Live well!
---
Public teams videos are up on you tube so that should be launching soon. Will probably change your behavior if you are looking to group up.
---
https://youtu.be/BmE8KemhlTE
---
Edit: the random invites can be people accidentally hitting keys, or trolls trying to get you to pvp. Or just internet lonely hearts. I’ve only accepted a few and only when they are right in front of me and seem like we are gonna actually do something. Just be aware current team structure allow others to manipulate your camp, not sure about public teams upcoming
---
And every other neglected weapon (chainsaw, alien blaster, etc).
---
Why did mods remove your text? I came here with this same issue
---
Wait. There’s a daily overseer quest?
---
Submit a ticket to Bethesda, someone report her name.  Explain the reason it is what it is and make it clear you won't spend anymore cash until they correct thier mistake.  He had his name changed back in 2 hours.
---
Officially down at the moment.
---
I haven’t seen any indication they are going away. What have you seen?
---
yeah tell me about it... happened to me 4 times with no explanations and mods not answering PMs... spam, rage and easily looked up things are fiiine, but unique posts are removed with no reasons XD
---
Yeah my g/f won't let me play after dark lol
---
Server hopping and checking the Raider vendor at Whitesprings
---
Thank you for fixing my raised eyebrow lol
---
Soon you'll be fus'roh-ing SBQs off mountains and taking explosive crossbow bolts to the knee
---
That's my plan - I'm farming for components to make high-end underwear.  
---
Unders, Ammo &amp; Booze.  Wish I had a neon sign for my camp...
---
When I did my X-01 jetpck it was a mod that had to be bought from modus. I didn't think you got plans for mods on the X-01?
---
*Might take a bit to get it to show up at the vendor, it used to be a pretty rare chance to show up, 1% IIRC.
---
Wait, its not available for gold in the vault?
---
I was killing myself yesterday jumping off a 4 story house and I had to rad-x to shut off birdbones.  It's definitely reducing fall damage.
---
Me too.  And I thought I knew every racist derogatory term in the book.  Hell I'm from ALABAMA.  Never heard this one.
---
  Investigate? 
---
Like everyone is lying! Or just making this up!
---
Looks like they removed all the posts about this outage.  🤷‍♂️
---
I’ve got a third character I play w my daughter with. This all from foggy memory. Raider power armor can be found at lvl 15. I remember finding her a set and myself early on. Excavator can be built at lvl 25. My character just past level 40ish. Many of the heavy weapon perks are locked below level 40. Just got a level 30 light machine gun in the game yesterday so that’s at least when you could find those.
---
You make a Good Point
---
You can wear the frame now. You can get the raider PA set at lvl 15. IIRC, you can get a Gatlin Gun at 20 and a .50 Cal at lvl 25.
---
Hey did you know Bethesda also released a game similar to fo76 called fallout 4 and they did the skyrim trilogy too!
---
Yeah.  Davenport gives you a daily than you can then turn in to the opposing faction for additional rep.  Or you turn it back into him to get the 200mm lens for your camera.
---
😂😂. What is keeping me going completely crazy is the enjoyment I’m getting from all these great and funny comments. I’m glad that 99% of people are still being so positive in these dark times that has fallen upon us all.
---
Side note: Apparently the servers are down yes(investigation still ongoing). 🕵️‍♂️🕵🏻‍♂️🕵🏼‍♂️🕵🏽‍♂️🕵🏾‍♂️🕵🏿‍♂️🕵️‍♀️🕵🏻‍♀️🕵🏼‍♀️🕵🏽‍♀️🕵🏾‍♀️🕵🏿‍♀️🕵️🕵🏻🕵🏼🕵🏽🕵🏾🕵🏿. We have many people working on this ongoing investigation. Please stand by for further updates!
---
Thanks for the help!
---
You just making stuff up and posting it like you some kind of genius...
---
Well that would be nice
---
Is gatling gun good?
---
This is the most coherent and well-articulated OP I've seen since the last OP I saw.
---
Its a joke 😂
---
No crashes in 2 hours, I guess that's pretty good! lol
---
No problem bud! Also, it only works with plantable crops, not wild or Flux unfortunately.
---
Says the guy with the name "DickPrickles".  I see what you did there.
---
I had to look it up, what I find interesting is it also could just be thought of as today a "Black man signing under the moon". Why bring in social status or profession? Could even just be a person singing under the moon, in fact I like that best. Wow even obscure very old names hardly ever used anymore still 'cause some type of uproar, as-if someone is alive that was witness to this. I could get it if it really used it derogatory.
---
Do a round of all the fire bases in cranberry bog between the ammo bags and military duct tape you'll usually come out with between 30 and 45 ballistic fiber if they've all spawned.
---
Mine JUST went down MA, US XBOX
---
At least at the Whitespring you have the free disease curing fountain.
---
They're deleting the new redundant ones because it might as well be spam. It's not "in the shadows". All you have to do is look at the first page to see at least two server posts.
---
I stood for 25 minutes when I diseased mirelurk hatchling went to town on me and got nothing! I’m going to have to try again. It’s the only one I have left also.
---
Someone started the Encryptid Event. lol
---
definitely stressful! im role playing a guy with nice things irl haha, my character definitely is not. all she does is drink water and jump all high
---
Your perks are fine, concentrated fire isn't much important with heavy weapons until higher level I guess, because your VaTs meter won't hold up to many shots if you're using fast fire rate guns. Also investing in Luck of the Draw (I think is it's name, has a chance to fix guns when attacking) is helpful for fast fire rate guns, as it keeps them firing longer. Also Ammosmith (Agility) will be a must once you get close to level 30 to keep your costs down. Most of the heavy gun related perks kick in in the 30s, so go with what will be useful to you no matter what gear you're using.
---
I've had no problems with it, although it's the grey version, not forest.
---
Probably not that soon though lol
---
👍
---
Good ol’ two-shot explosive. For when you wanna blow up everything around your target but leave them unscathed.
---
Fart isn't banned?  Thanks for the info...
---
As far as perks go I got aggravated with perk level lockouts myself. It’s too limiting to really plan a character from the get go. That’s why I gave up on my first character and started over. Focusing on melee on my second.
---
well, the beth status page is down as well, sooo....
---
You forgot the + or is there no + symbol in those letters? I've not got them.
---
Looks really nice regardless, good spacing.
---
#coverup
---
Do tell.
---
Pete Hines did say he prefers to play solo....
---
A system like that would only work if the modders themselves are getting payment out of the deal. Otherwise why would they spend the extra time to send it through the creation club when they can just upload it to Nexusmods for free. 
---
The other issue is that why would players purchase mods when they know that it might not make it to the full game. they will only get refunded 40% which means that they wasted 60% of the atoms on a mod that they will not be able to keep through the public realms.
---
I got mine last night. Just showing up when I see it on and do my part. Though last night I was fixing my controller so was afk most of the event. RNG gods have been kind of nice to me lately
---
And this resets daily?
---
He may not have meant it as payment, more as a "thank you."
---
Jesus knows.
---
Was the last OP asking if he got banned for accepting duped ammo?
---
They could at least have given her something cool as a name.  That's crap.
---
someone up in here doesnt suck at the internet...
---
the sulfer fountain is everything. fyi its in the gazebo near the golf club.
---
Yes. If any diseased enemy even looks in my direction I catch something. Most of the diseases aren't too bad though.
---
I like it. The 5mm ammo is easy to come by and it has great ammo to DPS consumption. It's my basic go-to for most mobs.
---
Any progress yet??
---
Because it's a penis reference. But the interesting thing is I saw someone with the name "Goblincock" during that Helvetia event.
---
Definitely will get the perk. Also if you run PA do you use a perk that reduces cores weight? Forgot the name.
---
My hubby and I have a set up so we both play together. 2 xboxes, 2 TVs side by side. It’s the life 🖤
---
Leave crickets. I need the acid.
---
I had this problem with girlfriends for a while in the late 90s.
---
Yup.  8 pm EST with the rest of the dailies.  Its call Photo Opportunity.
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Photo\_Opportunity](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Photo_Opportunity)
---
Just got booted (PS4 UK). I guess that's a sign that I should try sleeping instead...
---
But but... a super rare Trump Mask at Fasnacht would have been hilarious.
---
You just made my day. Thank you very much!
---
drop your build into [nukes&amp;dragons](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) and post it..
---
kinda hard to say not knowing where your at what would be the best actions to take
---
not only server posts are being deleted... ALOT of posts are being deleted with no reasons or explanations. im thinking the mods have gone mental..
---
wait, what is going on? I guess I missed it.
---
[_Vault Dwellers Liked That_]
---
Probably not.
---
Well maybe I am just locked into crap servers but they are always empty of events when I join.  OFC I could go speak to Jack at the pumpkin house or retrieve scorchbeast DNA, but events that reward notes are sorely lacking in my experience.
---
What exactly were the changes?
---
I wonder if bethesda's going to prorate our billing or our fallout 1st membership time for the time we are unable to play that is not our fault... FeelsBadMan
---
There’s no + :/
---
Can you.  Yes.  Will you be as good as a person who focuses on one or the other?  No, you will not.  If you don't care about that then rock it out.
---
Personally I like being good and doing nice damage with my weapons so I focus on one type of gun.
---
Yeah, that's why I asked, it's quite the compromise. I want to use the water-based ones for aesthetics, not practicality, so I'm willing to work with it.
---
The suggested spots in the south of the Savage Divide can do it, although they're way out in the boonies.
---
I would love mods! I really liked them in FO4 but I don’t see Bethesda being able to handle mods with the current server problems.
---
ive never seen one nor had anyone try to pull that shit on me..
---
yes, this reddit has been full of posts like yours lol
---
Sooooo. Does this mean "private" servers aren't that, private? Like, why can't I use the server I purchased if these things occur?
---
Haven't been able to log in for last hour
---
Enlighten me, how will this help find more events?
---
Glad I could help!
---
If you max out both strength and perception it would work. You will have to sacrifice a little in agility/luck most likely so the build would be less good at vats
---
Prediction; When the game comes back online everyone’s inventory will be empty...There no dupes no bans. 
---
I’m about to get downvoted I feel it
---
Liiiike dude it's been over 2 hours. Just got home from work at 3 and I just wanna pvp in fallout lol
---
Sheesh
---
bethesda servers are down.
---
Junkies Tesla, one star.
---
Bethesda is making a change in update 20 that if one player initiates PVP with another player then then only those two players will fight instead of automatically bringing their entire team into pvp
---
Maybe if we all promise to spend that much, suddenly the servers will pop back up 🎅🏽
---
Server nuke, it's a feature.
---
You can't throw your team into PvP with you anymore. So say I attacked a player and my team was nearby they would get to PvP. Now it's only players attacking gets to do PvP. So players are trying to crash servers and ruin it for everyone.
---
Not just you, same here. On Xbox.
---
A few games maybe but ESO is working fine.
---
Just like the other 2000 posts, check what everyone else is reporting. Servers are down.
---
It's always been there as soon as I get to the nuke zone, even if I just launched the nuke myself and it just smashed down. There are bad spots to nuke for flora, you wanna do some research via google first to see where you want to nuke for which types of flux. The northwest part of cranberry bog is spectacular for crimson/violet flux but you are probably going to need to mule the flora because the mob spawn rate is terrible there, even on private server (and that's with using the trick of logging out and back in when the area's mobs are all dead, to respawn more). Whitesprings is much better for masses and fluids, also has a bit of crimson/cobalt flux and a bunch of yellowcake if I remember right.
---
Edit: Here ya go - https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bnpyno/mappalachia_now_with_maps_of_flux/
---
Bethesda’s servers are down. There have been numerous posts about it already.
---
Ah your brain musta skipped out of the gutter. I was giggling at mommy salami, great name for a penis.
---
Cause you can even log it.
---
Long short of it is this:
---
1) Something happened
---
2) All of Bethesda is down except main website pages.
---
Honestly, both weapons kill 98% of the enemies in the game very easily with less than a clip. Unless you expect to solo fight the queen every other day lol it doesnt matter, fixer is for vats builds due to high recoil so ads is not going to happen lol and handmade is for ads and vats because less recoil.
---
Would make dailies more unbearable than they already are.
---
You can buy mod plans in the Production Wing. The Armory/Military Wing only sells three mod boxes at any time, which are random.
---
I played ESO after 76 went down!
---
But yet I have other people on my friends list playing with no issue
---
I was over encumbered for so long that me filling the scrapbox killed the server.
---
I never understood when people thank for patience because I am such an impatient bastard, but I understand that shit happens.
---
Yeah, it is a pain.  When it happens, I just back out of the vendor screen, go back in, then it works.  If it happens again with another item, then just back out and go back in again.
---
Wow. Check Bethesda support on Twitter bud. Can you manage that?
---
You got banned
---
Anyone else load up on explosive bait before vendor hopping? It’s my new normal.
---
PS Sorry about the Yao Guai.
---
What region servers did you play on?
---
Yea it's not a motivation for me at all.
---
So do you feel it's just the sneak affect on the fixer that makes it better?
---
For a while I had a rock music venue at the stage in the Toxic Valley. I highly recommend that people make camp around those empty nukashine bottles if they can.
---
Yet other people are playing on my friends list I'm even in a party with them
---
Last night I had a young player ( probably 10 yrs old-lvl 14 ) come by my camp, who was so excited about EVERYTHING and was asking a lot of questions, I made him some extra outfits and a set of fasnacht masks and eventually made a shielded Brotherhood Officer suit for him.  I didn't have a mic so I could only emote yes and no for answers and got him all set for some leveling up, which he was grateful for.  A traveling merchant showed up just as I was about to log off, and checked to see what he had- and the kid had sold everything I just gave him for next to nothing. I laughed hard and wasn't going to chase him down to give it all back again, it honestly was the best social interaction I've had in game.   You rock little gladiator or whatever your name was, don't ever stop reaching out and brightening old peoples days with your manic energy.
---
i saw someone mention it will probably be categorised as sturdy due to the mods being buttressed etc.. which is the same as trapper and marine, which are sturdy
---
Brotherhood Scribe outfit? You can get those for a little work turning in Technical Data.
---
Does Jetpack appear in the crafting menu? Is it greyed out?
---
Edit: If it doesn't show up at all you haven't learned the Plan. To check, head to the Production Wing and see if the Plan is (Known).
---
Nah I know the ban code I've been banned before this one is different
---
Imagine having server shut downs in 2020!
---
I have a bloodied heavy/melee build that runs 1 rank of each rifleman card . You have more room for QOL and misc perks with heavy/melee cause you're not using any vats perks. And being bloodied with all your applicable specials well into the 20s those Vats/sneak perks are nearly useless anyways. It's definitely my favorite character to play.
---
I agree that these people are childish ass hats. But this new team system is breaking pvp even more. Every patch thats been released since survival left has broken some aspect of pvp unintentionally, this is almost them intentionally breaking something. All they had to do is make pacifist players not take damage from other players period. Instead we got some convoluted, over complicated system thats bound to break PvP even more.
---
The truth hurts sometimes. 
---
Anyone that equates a hate group like the KKK to a movement designed to promote equality and respect is absolutely in the wrong. 
---
I’ll defend their right to express that opinion.  It’s still a pathetic and small-minded and bigoted opinion.
---
delays and more delays lol. But who knows maybe there was some miscommunication or something between ign and Bethesda.
---
Scroll down
---
There won't be a ton of difference. I wouldn't trade away a bunch of stuff for something slightly better. Also if you are on PC a bunch of the bloodied fixers are getting duped again so you may be able to find a decent deal.
---
Oooh I like it, fair fight as it should be. So who's the salty losers who think it's ok for 4 guys to team up against 1 ??
---
I refuse to use Twitter. If they allow a big orange baby on there I won't be.
---
Shit, I didn't realise that, cheers man.
---
lol.. theyre gimping their game for casuals and its going to be a big fucking hit
---
everyone will be 1shotting everything all the time.. wgas about anything other than XP bonuses
---
Exactly why I hate games that make you respawn, ride in a helicopter or other vehicle to the battlefield and parachute into the action only to be one shotted and start the whole 5 minute process of getting to the battlefield again.  I refuse to play games that require a long "Get Ready" period.
---
That is fucking fantastic
---
It's possible to do just about anything but it won't be optimal as those two weapons use different special stats. There are certain perks that boost anything, like bloody mess or adrenaline, but for your core weapon skills I'd imagine you'll have to stick to 1 point in each heavy/rifle card to get the most out of both weapons.
---
WHAT Are you kidding!! READ Every post in the last 30 minutes!!!
---
Yeah so my name is being forced to change to I understand Haans\_Job is a little childish but cmon bruh. (also I can't even get into 76 as of today)
---
i got a notification from a discord im in but thank you
---
Todd has broken the entire company 😂
---
Agree. Console is down too.
---
Hold down the console button and restart should pop up with turn off console and controller
---
 Bgs carpet bombing to remove exploiters

Yeah. Shame I let myself get suckered into subbing for a year.

server is down

A Water Wheel that makes Electricity?
---
You don't need any Perks to craft PA.
---
Well my buddy and I do queen fights on his private server all the time. He has a BFFR fixer and I have a BE fixer. And we kill her in around 4 mins. But I see his damage against her and it's crazy with that fffr. Just wondering if a primed BFFR handmade would do that?
---
Bethesda should have the ability to not have their entire servers go down all at once 😂
---
Because they were signed in before the authentication servers fell off a cliff.
---
OMFG. I recently tried that for some stupid flower challenge - I gave up after around 15 hops (found them the first time I went there, NOTHIGN after that). Thanks - but no thanks... this utter Bethesda ^^TM grade epic fucking design failure shit can stay right in the gutter it tried to creep from... -.-
---
this reply wasnt for this thread
---
edit'd
---
Well, to be fair, you brought up the example, you made the statement that it is derogatory, i would not have to google if you cared to be more complete in your statements ;)
---
("google if you care to know" is a personal pet peeve so please don't take this as a personal attack, but more than often i have received such a response to questions where people make statements, to the point that i've adopted a "if you care enough to say "A", but not enough to say "B", then i do not care to know")
---
Happy Birthday
---
Each zone would need major fast travel locations, but I'd be fine with it. I enjoyed seeing other players spawn in on Defiance and race to the next event.
---
I use weightless and chameleon mutation
---
Some Raider Thief stole the Server connectivity widget. We need someone to get it back. Luckily we put a transmitter in these items...
---
Yeahh realized I wasn't gonna get any community if I wasn't communicating. Trading is also harder without some form of social media. At least for me.
---
It doesn't work if YOU have peace mode on, but if someone with peace mode off walks into the camp of someone with peace mode on and starts shooting, everything breaks.
---
Yes servers are down. Yes people are making posts about it. Yes its just going to happen. So yes your just going to have to deal with it. Always the crying. Who cares :)
---
Making another post about all the posts was a pointless venture to say the least. You have stopped nothing, the machine will go on with or without you.
---
 Because they were signed in before the authentication servers fell off a cliff.
---
There is somewhere between 15-20 alcohol recipes you can learn from Biv. Like everything else in this game, it's a long grind to get them all.
---
Reading? Oh you can read can you? I watched a porno with someone doing that!
---
The mods here aren’t exactly the best.
---
No problem! Production Wing is where you enter the Bunker from Whitespring Service Entrance.

Before I hit neighborly with raiders, I had a lot of fun with just a Two Shot auto grenade launcher. But since I now have my gauss minigun, there is no other weapon I have more fun with.
---
Can report steam version of 76 is down as well. just got home from work and thought id hop on after work for a bit. Guess not
---
THIS\^\^.  Oh, you died...you can play again in 5 min...please wait.
---
I also dont use twitter cuz it's a fucking cesspool
---
A tip with a note attached!
---
Servers are down mate. 
---
Don't change the fact you should of looked at the numerous other posts with your same question.
---
your thinking of fo4.
---
It happens mostly after scorched earth to try to take flux, they use a low level teammate to bait fights
---
The exception to diseases spreading I've found is mirelurk spawn, which won't give you whoopsies no matter how much you beg.
---
The Fixer will be about 10% better.  Not very noticeable, but significant over time.  The sneak bonus is (at least for me) an upgrade over the handmade.  Ammo cost is slightly less for the handmade though, so it probably balances out.
---
That's a 10-4 Ghost Rider!! Thanks for the update, and will be standing by!! 😂😂🎮
---
Oh well.... Anyone else play Mobile Legends on their phone??

I'd have screamed 'WITNESS ME' in the area chat right as the transactions commenced...

Now you slowly sell them off at 40 scrip over, I dunno, ten years logging in every day to do so.
---
If it weren't for the sErVeRs aRe dOwN posts I would think you were talking about the new mothman jet pack. Have literally seen the same question asked like 5 times.
---
check reddit and see if there is a thread in the fallout76 sub about it
---

I was looking forward to both the FO76 gameplay and BG3, so that’s a bummer Bethesda pulled out at the last minute. 
---
I wonder if they’re going to put it with Xbox’s showcase next month.
---
Doesn't appear at all, think someone has already solved the problem.
---
Because it was so long ago the last time I modded my PA I might have bought a mod and not the plan for an x-01 jetpack.
---
I'm going back to a time when mods and plans were random in places and not guaranteed, sometimes requiring numerous server hops and luck.
---
It could be highly possible it was a mod I used and not a plan because it was so long ago I honestly can't remember lol
---
From what I can tell, almost any build works in this game. The game isn't that difficult at the end the the day. SBQ just flies around dropping poison and when she lands she is deleted. 
---
The hardest right now is the Imposter, but with death having no penalty, its still not that big an issue. You just respawn in. 
---
If you want to try it, go for it.
---
Ok, thanks
---
/r/thathappened
---
I don't if someone is harassing my wife i would 2v1 them, But this isn't the way of doing it, DDoS attacks. Maybe to fix this issue with baiting teammates they HIGHLIGHT people who are in team and display said names of the team attacking.
---
Still down FYI
---
Charming
---
Whenever I play it’s not uncommon for individual servers to crash after a couple hours of playtime which is unacceptable at this point.
---
Cool, thanks!
---
How can I masturbate when I can't log in to see all the sexy deathclaws and Fisto robots though?
---
Yeah it's an Int perk, 30% reduced energy weight up to 90% at 3 levels. If you really want to go with energy weapons and power armor, it'd be worth it.
---
In b4 this is locked .....
---
That u dsp? :D
---
That's definitely true. I suspect Events teams will make up a majority of the public teams. I don't think Bethesda thinks of the different options as "balanced" though and they probably expect Events to be the most widely used. But the other options are there because they are things some players want and I bet all of them will be used. I don't suspect I will ever be in a roleplay team, but there are dedicated roleplayers out there who I bet will have a blast with this even though the CHA boost is kinda useless for them.
---
my guess is its related to the multi-factor auth that they added
---
stop giving fake advice!!
---
I told my son about my experience and his first response was "You got conned, Dad."
---
Haha
---
Just like people d-u-p-i-n-g but you know they never get em
---
No, update 20 is still a week or two off, probably around the 4th of July.
---
This Is an issue with Bethesda attempting two factor verification keys for fallout 76 player logins (all online games and service, but fallout is what we care about), that failed. They are currently working to revert the changes.
---
REALLY?  Get a grip BGS. This has been over 2 hours already.
---
I have not cheated at all! I wouldn’t even know how to, I don’t even know how to delete my account and try again! I better not of got deleted!
---
making friends is pretty easy in this game you just gotta talk and youll make friends nearly everyone is nice in this game but be a little weary
---
Triple XP weekend?
---
It is possible and I have my main toon setup to be a flexible build with heavy weapons as the dominant trait but capable of being good with commando weapons, pistols, SMGs and rifles. I don't use melee at all. 
---
While that toon is being effective in combat outside of heavy weapons, the trade off is that he's less effective with other weapons types. 
---
Does it actually matter for PvE? Not at all. But if you're after min/maxing your build for specific scenarios, specialization is the only way to achieve greatness.
---
OK, please forgive my ignorance but I cannot find this mythical First Page.
---
I tried Top, New, Hot... no Mod link.
---
Am I missing something?
---
Now is also the time for some to find a sense of humor
---
Savvy???
---
True
---
My main point was really the worthless boosts. For stuff like Vault 94 (Or 96 or whatever) it’ll be helpful then.
---
Yeah, looks like intentional immersion mechanism. Started to just ignore it and bathe in filth, like some back alley 10 buck hooker.
---
Hint: Intelligence increases XP gain for killing mobs and crafting, so Building Public Team is the way to go for XP bonus - way better than Events which only grants XP bonus for event completion.
---
They are just pruning the duplicate posts.  Prob should have a sticky or megathread.  But hey people will post anyways.
---
If you can find one at low 20s, it is very strong and fun. Plus you can make 100 5mm ammo each crafting time, so it's nice for that.
---
&gt; Well your kinda rude soo
---
How old are you? If you think I'm rude, you will be in for a rude awakening when you get in in the real world.
---
I like to be able to live longer at the expense of some damage.  If you die, DPS goes out the window anyway.   Since I run bloodied variants of both builds, you might be interested in my Jack of All Trades, Bloodied, High Endurance build.  Good (but not the absolute highest possible) damage coupled with great sneaking and nearly impervious to incoming damage.  You can run any of these three with the same SPECIAL distribution.

Maybe I am missing out on getting the absolute max possible damage, but this build is very satisfying and quite tanky.  I rarely if ever die and still one shot most anything.  A bonus is that I can carry loads of aid, ammo and guns and not get overencumbered.
---
Its because I just joined Fallout First, isn't it?  Buy something...break the servers.  Seems only right.
---
I'd want my .0185055555555555556 cents l then lol I'm not paying for 1st anymore but I was really thinking about it. Guess I'll wait till they figure out stability but still,  at least give an extension you know
---
So I’m guessing Bethseda got hacked as all their servers are down not just fallout ones
---
Oh wow, I had no idea, thanks!
---
While it would be nice, you are completely wrong. Go look at their status. It’s pretty much all of their games. Gotta do your research my friend. Takes a handful of seconds to look.
---
Delete your post. Only posts asking if the servers are down are allowed. ;)
---
Oh dear lord... You're not serious are you?
---
Sort by new and have a check for things like this before posting. Saves the sub from 500 of the same post from people too lazy to check, thank you in advance.
---
I have 4 characters with specific roles. Heavy, Rifles, Pistols, and shotguns. It is 100% the best to go all out on one character for one weapon type. You gain inventory space, perks, and max damage.
---
The servers are currently down, confirmed on Twitter.  Apparently it has to do with attempted two factor authentication.  I guess they're trying to revert the changes now.  Guess I'll go play Fallout 4 for a while
---
Ok now what ?
---
I am getting the same error. If you go to the support page on the Bethesda website it says they are down right now. Your account has not been deleted.
---
It's the worst, especially if you like to switch a lot during a fight.
---
I like to fire off a volley of quad missile launcher and then use an smg or melee.
---
But the lag just spoils the action for me.
---
Fallout 1st members be like
---
UNLIMITED AMMO !
---
Someone in your Team I'm presuming? So the PVP state gets shared.
---
I have both, the fixer is great at distance , hits harder, but seems slightly slower compared to my handmade. The handmade seems better in run and gun action, up close and personal. Both are great primed but crafting ammo for the hand made is cheaper since you get 144 per flux vs 89 for 45. If I had to give one up I would probably let the fixer go but that is due to my own bias.

None your business and I'm in the army I know a thing or two about rudeness. Just could have said hey servers down now make a whole parade about it.

Dude don’t listen to them please. The game is having problems for everyone don’t delete anything
---
And yet I still haven’t caught the whoopsies.😖
---
The servers are down, I cant get to bethesda forums right now either
---
This is not what happened to you.
---
The tax has always baffled me - doesn’t seem like there’s a reason mechanics-wise and there definitely isn’t a lore reason. So strange.
---
Yeah, I think the problem might be that Bethesda tried to be too clever in making the boosts tie into the team themes when it might have been better to apply more general boosts to each (or the same boost to all team types).
---
I used to be a vault dweller like you...
---
Cheaters gonna get deleted. It's right on their home page!
---
You're gonna cause this individual an annurism😂
---
What happens if I do that?
---
Most of Bethesda is down right now with server problems. No one can log into FO76 at the moment. They are working on the problem and have for an hour or more with update posts via their Twitter page. Sorry for your loss. Hang in there and we will all be playing FO76 again soon.
---
Just got and sold another this week
---
I agree I'm not exactly singing in the rain about most of these, still just having event groups to run with will be nice. Few enough people run them as it is, finding others to do them with easily is a nice addition.
---
It’s like this in ESO where you need to go to a station to fast travel. It’s not that far out of an idea. If someone can’t be assed to walk distances in a video game then idk what to tell you guys. 
---
It’s literally normal to walk in all other MMOs.
---
Bethesda website says they have a partial system outage. Servers are down for a majority of their games.
---
Building is better than event one. Why get only bonus XP for event completion, when you can get more XP overall?
---
That was quick! Must be young or on Viagra 👍
---
Radscorpion tile floors bethduh plz
---
Huge disagree. Plasma grenades and frag MIRV have been very kind to me and I don't even use demo expert. I bet the nuka quantum grenade is an absolute killer
---
Unyielding Bloodied stealth builds can use any weapon for pve and be on par with focused builds. When everyone is one shotting anyway a few hundred damage doesn't matter. I use a bloodied gatling for SCB and as long as I keep my distance I maintain my stealth and do about 150 damage a shot (more if I remeber to switch to heavy weapon perks). Not massive numbers but 10 shots and I've go my loot.
---
Todd Howard appears in your bedroom at night to whisper country roads in your ear
---
Would be cool with Runescape kinda like loot tables for mobs. Maybe it would make the grind less hideous
---
Thank you! At least there is one decent person on this sub that will help out! Much appreciated!
---
This is literally an option in ESO guys and our map isn’t even that big 🙄
---
XB1 canada also down :(
---
Fool they ain't gonna look at this either!
---
[Here is a link to the status portal.](https://bethesda.net/en/status)
---
The servers are down because you touch yourself
---
Pokimane viewing numbers just spiked!
---
Shit someone get him to Todd quick! He needs his fix or he'll snap!
---
You sure ?
---
I only started with Wastelanders, but I've seen people mention that they nerfed explosive damage pretty hard some time ago.
---
Don't know if that's just the Legendary Major, or anything that deals that damage type from players.
---
&gt; None your business and I'm in the army I know a thing or two about rudeness.
---
Wow you sound pretty sensitive to be in the army. 
---
I served as well and buttercups like you didn't do so well there.
---
&gt;s. Just could have said hey servers down now make a whole parade about it.
---
You are the one going off about how rude and mean I am. I just said you should of read another post instead of made this one, then you got your panties in a twist.
---
I am assuming that the servers are undergoing maintenance considering that it seems that players are all offline including myself
---
Well I won't lie this really fucks up the endgame for me. My squad and I regularly draft each other into 4 v 4 teams and use this mechanic to team fight each other.
---
I do try, but between game crashes and surprise spawns killing me the last few days, the living part is harder to do, but I'm trying! :)
---
EDIT: Oh wait. Refreshed the browser after writing my post and... "FO76 OUTAGE".
---
But their Server Status page shows the FO76 servers are fine, and it is some other game (maybe "TLS"? IIRC?) that is down.
---
Hm that's interesting. Glad I didn't waste my materials on it lol
---
Discovering Beckley doesn't work either. Even on my alt.
---
I put a bunch of propaganda posters in my vendor for 76 caps each, the bonus of doing it that way is the sale message when someone is 'tipping' me (and who and how much).
---
Thanks for the tip!  I usually just hit Camp McClintock a couple of times a session.  
---
Any tips on where I can farm High-Rad Fluids?  I have trouble getting them to drop in blast zones for some reason...
---
Thank you man appreciate I'm pretty new to fallout I'm not very familiar with the community and all that jazz so I'll be sure to check that when I have a problem
---
Check this page, it should help :) https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects
---
This is a great change half my camp got destroyed by two cowards who left after destroying my house
---
I just got kicked out so this appears to be spreading to North America PC servers.
---
Yeah...it’s the new fapschnacht event
---
You can get the plans to make them at Harper's ferry vendor
---
But my daily gold bullion:(
---
You serious, Clark?
---
Instigating lever action rifle would be the way to go if you’re not wanting to use auto fire.
---
This is not an mmo. It's a single player fallout game with co-op elements randomly stapled onto it. It will never be a fully-fleshed out, perfectly balanced, true mmo-experience. 
---
End game is legendary farming. That's it. Every event that fails to give consistent legendary drops is ignored unless you're really, really bored. No legendary and you have to run a bit? It's not gonna work out the way you want it to.
---
No problem mate.
---
I tried the Quantum grenades a few days ago.
---
Had Demo maxed on, tossed one into a pack of scorched all nice and clustered together and... there was a little aqua colored mushroom cloud in the middle of the pack.
---
They all turned to look at me like I had my bra on backwards.. then I died.
---
Three hours now for me.  PS4
---
Maybe some of us are posting looking for info, after having looked extensively online, to see if anyone else here has news? 🤔
---
Yeah I feel like it was different a long time ago, but I don’t find them even as effective which, one would think, they would be.
---
Exactly. Perception from reading this sub was.that it happened to everyone, every single day. Meanwhile, I did Fasnacht every time I was on, and it was only nuked once.
---
Before or after the fap?
---
Maybe I should have just kept my mouth shut. My intent was not to teach you about photography, but the mindset of those that enjoy using the camera in FO76.
---
Just saw that the server status changed... AFTER I posted my tirade.
---
Sheesh.
---
I’m sorry... a colossal what ;-;
---
When there is a economy, there are people that seize any opportunity to excel in it, no matter the method. Bugthesda is probably aware, but doesn't care, as long Atom and 1st purchases are present. Simple as that.
---
Update on Server status!!
---
We have got our top team working hard on issue on wether or not the servers are in fact down. So far they have have made 1000 new post on reddit and the team leader has given us some feedback on what they have figured out so far.
---
[https://imgur.com/gallery/DrnsXUt]()
---
We better get treasury notes for it.  And they better not be sticky.
---
I feel like there should be a specific public group for team pvp, but the way most people use this current system is to the detriment of most other players experience
---
What do you mean? Mad Dog Malone has escaped, AGAIN!
---
Good thing I grabbed a screen shot of duchess....
---
found the bloodied build
---
We need a “hotel” , elevator to your room putting you at a ten story or so height and everyone’s room being their name no floor numbers. 
---
Maybe trade the “management” your camp for the duration of your stay or something
---
If I had to guess.  It is an emergency maintenance to fix all of the underground glitch bases that are popping up everywhere.
---
They must not have liked your suggestions. LOL
---
I feel your pain lol hopefully it’ll be up soon enough for you to still get those dailies done
---
I could see Hunting during the middle of like Uranium Fever, then when it gets close to the end of the event and most of the legendaries have spawned and been killed switching to Events.
---
You deserve a reward for that
---
Pleasant valley tickets...

Any idea when this patch 20 is dropping ??
---
All semi auto rifles get the same benefits from the perks, so who cares which one you choose.

Oh my stars and garters! What den of sin have i fallen into!

I was well-fed and well-hydrated with rank 2 Rejuvenated. Hadn't had any radaway or stimpaks. Yesterday i sneak-attacked a diseased ghoul and well and truly overkilled it with one hit. It didnt even look at me. Contracted rad worms.

Ummm, did you look to see if anyone had posted anything like this before you posted it? Because they did......lol. Practice what you preach.

If you play on PS4, there's a chance you'll find it on the hill between the two Gauley Mine entrances
---
Scared the shit out of me too
---
There is a 255 item "Recently Looted" list for both your character and for the server that will keep flowers from re-appearing once you have looted them.  Loot 255 items in the area after picking flowers, change servers and they should reload.  You can also get a friend to join the server and spawn in the area of the flowers (but you need to crouch first so that the flower spawns are not blocked by your presence) and the flora will also spawn for the friend.  You can take them.  Angry Turtle has a very informative video that describes the spawn/respawn mechanics of FO76. It is definitely worthwhile to watch it.
---
Even without using that method, you still get enough in one run to craft about 20 radshields.  That will last an eternity.
---
OK fair enough I stand corrected and will go look as the posters history, sorry if I upset you, really not intended. ❤
---
On Xbox you can straight from the social menu makes it very easy for finding certain items without wasting the caps and for finding teams
---
I’m ok with letting it die , it’s player vs gear not pvp.
---
With the quarantine going on, hubby and I bought a 6ft table to put in front of the couch. Now we play next to each other and can relax at the same time.
---
One of the reasons why I bought a private server. Kids think they are playing fortnite or whatever the fuck. Tell your wife she was just attacked by kids and I doubt that will happen ever again. Hell looking back I was extremely annoyed by the Pvp and stopped playing for months and ruined the experience for me until I came back after wastelanders came out. This game isn't meant for pvp unless all the guns did the same damage and didn't have legendary effects. This game gets good once you dive deep. Don't let this discourage you
---
IE Lever!
---
Wait the servers are down?
---
Any reasonable person understands an online game goes down from time to time, that's the risk you take when you buy an online game and I'm sure the FO1 TOS covers reasonable outages like this.  
---
No, it's not reasonable to expect a prorated refund for a few hours of downtime. If we're still here 3-4 days from now then the case for a prorated refund or some kind "we're sorry" gift starts to become more legitimate, but until then "that's life son"
---
404 not found.
---
And besides pvp in this game was dead on arrival and sucks.
---
People spamming teslas and god rolls and nuka quantums don't seem fun to me.
---
If there was a better way to grind for gear and some major pvp balance maybe.
---
But hey that's just me I'd sign because other people feel its fun.
---
I'd like to see a stripped down better balanced mode like nuclear winter but not battle royal.
---
Maybe faction wars.
---
Capture points
---
Or stuff like that.
---
If survival comes back it needs to be stripped down and be new characters only maybe make it so the weapons are like nuclear winter.

They are killing greefing exploits not pvp

Nope! Die PvP, DIE!!!

This will tell you all their server's status
---
Fake News!

Sounds cool, looks cool, but my lever action does more damage. Both are bloodied. Any way to boost caster damage? I have the long barrel on it right now and it's very accurate.
---
Scroll down to Live Games section. They are all down at the moment.
---
Blocker, in Strength.  Nerd Rage increases protection and damage, and Lone Wanderer also blunts damage and provides faster AP recharging for Dodge to proc.
---
For rads, it depends on what you're talking about.  In a typical SBQ battle, people lure the SBQ out of the nuke zone.  While she kicks out a bunch of rads just being near her, a simple Rad-X (Dliuted) should be enough to counter them.  For the battles where she's in the nuke zone, you have to accept that you're not going to be operating at peak efficiency.  The best option is to wear the Chinese Stealth Armor, which you get from the Settlers quest line (or pay massive Bullion for it, if you didn't).  Or you can just use Power Armor with an alternate melee setup, since your Unarmed weapons won't work, but your investment in Strength can still pay off.
---
But it only has one mod iirc i bought Nd sold it cuz i couldnt hook up anything.
---
Heeeyy... the servers looks to be down .....   /s   🤣
---
Good luck with ammo on that puppy.
---
Much easier to rant than read
---
How come they don't say when patch 20 comes out? They have taken out the new event and the lendary perk system. So what's left? The seasons and  this community bonus?  
---
Why does bethesda always kills the momentum with radio silence and 3rd tier content? I've been playing since launch and i always hate that they are taking this aproach. Smh
---
I hope you're using up all the bad fixer luck now rather than later. I blew all my good luck and got the plan on the first run at the end of the questline. Still to this day I've never had one roll from any of the appropriate events or mumbles. 
---
RNG giveth and RNG taketh away...
---
Reinstall your OS to make sure it works.
---
I appreciate the info. And if your on XB1 and decide to trade your fixer lmk.
---
I'm so sorry for your entire situation. I really wish you the best and hope you get this resolved ♥️

That said, I'm starting to think this entire planet is a vault Overseen by Todd and things are just going to keep getting worse 😡

Don't feel bad I think bathesda just released an MFA and there's some kind of bug with logging in
---
Maybe this is why people can't complete Encrypted
---
No many people who havent duped or cgeated cant get online either
---
I think you are misunderstanding his point. I don’t believe he was actually asking for a refund, but was making a point that the services he and thousands of other subscribers are paying for have been spottily supported. Try playing for more than a couple hours without being disconnected from a server, that is unheard of in other live service games, especially ones that offer premium subscriptions, but for some reason people accept it here happily.

It may have been the armor you were wearing.  Any peice with "15% less damage taken while blocking" as a 3rd effect will auqment shotgun performance in vats.  Substantially.  In a good way.  Keep it hush-hush please.
---
Or has a really hot girlfriend 😍
---
The force is strong in this one
---
Thanks. I love how punks try to assume s*** or try and throw shit it in your face without knowing a fuckin thing
---
No to pvp. Not why I play Fallout.
---
is it offensive if only you and the person with the name actually know what it is?
---
You know how much these go for? Gonna try one myself
---
The flux rewarded by Scorched Earth disappears on death, nobody takes it.
---
The drop rate sucks on them. Nuked Morgantown airport is probably the best. Anyplace where scorch will spawn in nuke zones. They seem to have the best drop rate for flux mats.

---
Todd Howard has had enough of your complaints and decided to shut down Fallout 76 for good.
---
pretty down.
---
Lmao I know everyone else already said this but you had me in the first half, ngl
---
I know right people like just that ruin the damn community
---
Somewhat new. Haven’t seen these events pop up, do you have to activate them or something?
---
These are all good answers.  I love my Bloodied/Instigating Levers.  They are hella strong.  I'd add that a good Bloodied/Instigating Railway Rifle is a hoot and hits like a truck.  Plus the ammo only costs steel and it makes the best sound in the game.  It is loud though, so stealth is not going to last long.
---
A Bloodied Semi Fixer is also a great weapon for stealth rifleman builds.
---
Man I completely agree with you. But people here are gonna shit on the idea. Guy talking about dailies lol. Exactly the point. Dailies are trash too. Remove fast travelling and actually make some more compelling gameplay besides fast travel to loot 1 item and then fast travel back. The problem with good ideas like yours is basically this entire game needs to be rebuilt from the ground up. I always think about that Dunkey video making fun of Battlefront 2. "All they gotta fix is the fast travel, the bugs, the lag, the story, the weapons,  the perks, the quests, the dailies, the endgame, the teamplay, and then they'll have a good game!"
---
I’m running 1 endurance 1 charisma 5intellect , heavy on luck and agility because of the various card combinations with reaper and bloody mess is just a given. The cards for endurance are great but really just quality of life points that could be used for maxing damage
---
Hey, I know this community likes to talk shit and make fun of each other sometimes but it’s honestly one of the nicest subreddits I’ve been to. If you ever need anything in game, just let me know. If you’re on Xbox I can help you out, if you’re on another system hopefully someone else will be able to help. 
---
But besides the game if you ever want to rant about anything, you can always send me a message and I won’t judge. I probably can’t give much advice but I can at least be someone that you can talk to 100% safely.
---
Idk, losing a pet is so hard and especially one that’s been with you for a decade and a half. If you ever need anything let me know.
---
its over.. get out of the way of the casuals and dont forget to wipe your feet...
---
Same here, took little over a year break. Came back about a month ago.
---
We talked about it and she only plays when I am on and I have FO1st. From now on she'll play on my server.
---
Ack..
---
Agreed. Nothing fun about a bunch of bloody builds running around with Teslas. Nuclear Winter may be flawed but at least you have a fighting chance.
---
Just finished downloading 62GBs of fuckin updates the last week. Go to start the game and the servers are down. 10/10 Bethesda.
---
No you're just not very good with them..
---
You want to play stealth ?
---
Rifleman/expert/master, tank killer, adrenaline, gun fu, bloody mess then season to taste with whatever else you want. I suggest stealth as the extra damage is hard to pass up.
---
Depends on how many stars and what the rolls are. 
---
If you’re on PS4 I have a 1* one in my stash I could sell/trade to you for fairly cheaper you can try it out.
---
Or just pick up weight plates.  I have no idea why people mine.  It's way less efficient.
---
Heart of the Enemy or Tipsy Taste Test, weight plates in Vault Tech U.
---
Guided Meditation or just at Crater, weight plates in basement of temple.  Also plastic if doing shotgun.
---
Forbidden Knowledge, weight plates in bunk room.
---
Have access to nuke silos, all 3 have weight plates.
---
Bunch more.
---
I pick up way more lead than I can use just while doing dailys.  Although I don't use a Gauss Minigun which can piss out a hundred lead in no time flat.  I'd have to farm silos if I used that seriously.
---
😂😂
---
Yup, same for me, and I'd say it's pretty darn certain that probably non of us affected on PS4 did anything shady to get banned or so.
---
So I suppose it's nothing to worry about /too much/ as of now.
---
EDIT: I love how there is this one sad little soul downvoting everything that is /not/ Bethesda-bashing xD
---
Wouldn't they need a shed load more servers? Even though they are virtual servers it would be a huge number.
---
bloodied stealth melee build..
---
Thanks for explaining it. I don’t usually follow all the different streamers out there. I play alone for the most part. Buy  I was all for pvp getting a rebooted survival mode or some kind of pvp mode/balance. No reason they can’t do what they love but if people are taking it far enough ddos servers then thats just childish. If that is the case I really hope Bethesda starts taking hard legal action against however many of these resistance members they can find. 
---
Sounds really suspicious to me as well. Announcement comes out about changes they don’t like and the servers for pretty much everything Bethesda owns goes down after threats to do just that. I think your right and someone probably  ddos their servers. 
---
Im not sure what they even hope to accomplish. Bethesda to just give in and  turn pvp on by default? If anything this could be a reason for Bethesda to pull the plug on pvp once and for all. Which i hope they don’t do. Not fair to punish the good pvp players because the bad ones had to act up.
---
Eh, these are the kinds of things that should be a bit underwhelming.  Otherwise, you'd feel like you were forced to team up, and I don't think anyone wants that.  This is just a little bonus for doing so.
---
Or a wife
---
You want player interaction. Players interact at events. Events take time. Most events don't give worthwhile rewards. Players have to pay to travel to events. Make them walk on top of paying? Less players at events. Less player interaction.
---
Also note, if you need Raider or Settler rep, it's better to turn the photos Davenport wants in to Crater or Foundation, and then (if you pass the speech check) go finish the quest with Davenport.
---
Edit: Passing the speech check still gives you a cap reward, it's just 40 caps instead of 100.
---
Yeah, but I'm getting this weird error code and I can't play the game. I think I should make a new post about it, just in case someone else is having the same problem.
---
It's in stealth and only shows if you press the power button on the PC or Console.
---
No thanks, I'm busy drinking water.
---
I invite people all the time to team up for perk bonuses, to help new players, or alert vets to something that's popped up that I want to share. PVPers have made people wary of teaming up so I often get rejected. Luckily the PVP mechanic is being changed in next update
---
No thanks would be happy to see pvp gone.
---
I used to think that too, I'm not so sure anymore. And even if it's true, they could still make an Enclave bundle... Even an army one... But no, more animal costume outfits, and rererererereleasing the Free States bundle....that's better yeah /s
---
But what about all us Jet users who can't get it up?
---
Well to be fair it matters that you use one that has good base damage and accuracy.
---
And can you give me your stable cobalt flux on your way out?  This Casual wants to upgrade my outfit but really doesn't want to work for it.  Maybe the brick building plans too - my camp is sad.
---
How does that work? Have a friend in the server then join back on him, or anyone in the lobby, with your other character?
---
or both 😍😍
---

---
I have been busy....
---
I want that xo2 they datamined
---
I love how people here are trashing others looking for answers, rather than trashing Bethesda for not providing them
---
The enclave is In Hawaii Messing with portals and shit  , Fallout 5 Hawaii!
---
imo you either go tank melee or stealth melee, doing both makes it really hard on your perk eco, and when your are that stealthy you don't need to be nearly that tanky. Just my two cents the build will still perform great tho. I would suggest dropping the stealth boy perk for adrenaline tho, stealth suit might fit your playstyle as well.
---
From what I'm reading in the thread above, I don't believe they will. It sounds like they only work on plants which can be placed in a C.A.M.P or workshop.
---
How would that work? The whole thing with the junkjet was that you could pick up the junk again after you fired it.
---
Now with the brown bag system, you wouldn't be able to do it.
---
Fallout is down?
---
Hella stealth
---
whos leaving?
---
&gt; Please be gentle this is my first theory 
---
Like ever?
---
The bonus modifier would vary based off of Wich mode you're in and if that can't work they can a different card for those receivers they can always add more cards
---
Nah they are just doing a brain surgery on Ward
---
So heres my comment from another post exactly like yours:
---
Thanks :) had the same issue, thought I got banned
---
Then they’re trying to make people lose their flux
---
Roxy's quest alternates with Wren's quest every other day.
---
Idk why people don’t just check the server status at the Bethesda website. It’s faster, no harder than making a post about it.
---
[https://steamcharts.com/app/1151340](https://steamcharts.com/app/1151340)  
---
They banned everyone but about 800 people? Surely not.
---
In his dreams 🤣
---
I thank Godd Howard every day that ive yet to be disconnected. However, if I spawn in and someone has built their base where mine is, I get this horrible loop where it wont find an empty world and just keeps sending me to the same one. The only fix is closing the game and restarting, so I guess thats just as bad as a disconnect.
---
So your a man culture as well
---
None of which provide any answers, updates, or ETA
---
Base damage hardly matters. The prefixes do.
---
Still pretty disappointing that a 45 ends up doing more damage than a 12 guage.  When realistically a 12 guage puts a gaping hole in any and all soft tissue at close range, even with birdshot.  And in game they're supposed to be firing buckshot, aka 30 Caliber balls at 1200 fps.  Should be dealing like 6 times more damage than a combat rifle at close range.
---
Private doesnt mean offline. I'm sure alot of people thought it would tough.
---
have you both considered just throwing passive mode on and laughing at the sad life someone must life if they attack you?
---
Yeah why?
---
At the gazebo just outside of the golf club there's a bubbler (er, "water fountain" for non-Wisconsin people) that cures diseases when you drink from it. And no, you can't save the water to cure your dirty diseased self. But it's a lifesaver on WS runs for sure.
---
😂
---
You're overthinking it. I didn't capitalise "First Page" like it was its own thing. I mean when you first enter the subreddit, it's sorted by "hot", and you can clearly see posts about the issue without having to move on to the next set of posts.
---
But fine, I'll play along. Here is the First Page: https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/
---
thats cause nobody cares about pvp. otherwise they wouldnt have removed survival.
---
That is beautiful. Guess they never figured perks into the planning.
---
type of wholesome content i look forward to 😌
---
It’s not lag, it’s a feature!
---
They were never interested in PVP.  There are plenty of PvP games and Bethesda has a version of PvP.  In fact, there was a great system for PVP I’m the beginning, but only for those with honor.  Fight and lose caps or junk or whatever is fair.  Catch me off guard? Cool.  Snipe me from afar? Nice shot!  Beat me with a stick? Nice build, can you tell me what your load out is?  Gang up in power armor with two other people and explosive weapons to fight me while I’m naked?  Nope...that’s not PVP.
---
im feeling very personally attacked haha. sorry for not elaborating, i thought at first i was being trolled until everyone chimed in and confirmed they didnt know either.
---
I'm not sure that's how Viagra works...
---
Near the club house, there’s a white dome fountain structure with a drinkable water fountain inside called something like a sulphur fountain.  Drink from it, and it’ll cure your diseases.
---
It’s on your right, past the tennis courts, if you face the club house.
---
What are the trap camps for?

Are you serious?

The world is currently in a pandemic, you're lucky to be alive mate!

1-how do I farm the legendary gear?
---
Events, story, legendary enemies, random picks (script)
---
2-the crane quest in the end gave me a legendary using some type of coin, where can i get more of that?
---
You can't, that's one per character 
---
3-i have a melee legebdary sledgehammer, that I made the second upgrade with the rocket thing, dmg show 95 but when I equip shows 79 on the weapon 78 on the damage indicator(bottom right) when I hit the damage goes to 87 wtf is happening?(I got no card/debuff or buff or gear that make me do more damage, I'm not addicted too)
---
What is the legendary effect? 
---
4-any workaround on the performance on ps4 slim, shuttering bad even on ssd
---
Not really, some servers are more stable. Jump around if you have issues on the one you're on.
---
5-the last one is where can I get the heavy metal armor plans? the combat armor is way bad than the metal one so the heavy one must be better right
---
Idk about this one, check the wiki for plan locations
---
No i meant that what i share to other i am more of tight lip kind of guy
---
If you don't have issues with fusion core supply, you can easily drop Power User for Nerd Rage. While my PA/HeavyGuns dude is only in his low 40s, I have more cores than I know what to do with.
---
If curious, this is what I'm shooting for with him, with swap-outs for specialized weapons and 2h melee (which is working well so far, 'course he had to rely on melee until big guns became relevant anyways):

c'mon, it's a small indie studio, give them a break
---
I hope the outage is from them trying to get mods working for fo76, report says Mods. bet they workn on that :D yay
---
It's not really PvP. It's people picking fights and one shotting you with an OP weapon or teaming up on you to steal your stuff and/or trash your camp. It's honestly the main thing I hate about the game. If you're into PvP there are plenty of other games out there.
---
You people will complain about anything, they need to do server maintenance get over it
---
Offline on pc dont know about other platforms.
---
Something has to be debuffing it.  A mutation perhaps?
---
As for legendary gear and assuming you are a very low level, I'd do "Leader of the Pack" often.  It rewards legendaries scaled to your level.  Also, if you have any scrip, use them on 2\* (best bang for the buck) pulls from the purveyor.  Another way is to do Radiation Rumble on a public server.  Hide somewhere, and try to tag as many enemies as possible.   Let the others do the work, just try to survive and tag enemies.  You'll level up very fast doing this.  If you have a "Perfect Storm" from that quest at Wavy Willards, that is a great gun to mark mobs and get loot even if you don't get the kills. Many legendary items drop at radiation rumble.  You'll want to grab a Hazmat suit at the beginning of the event if you intend to get around any of the radiation sources there, because they are very very strong.  Uranium Fever is another event that you should try to do, but don't do either of those events alone.  Find a server with others doing the event and just help as much as you can.
---
Lastly, somewhere in the gold quest, In Beckett's questline, you'll get a "Final Word" Which is an Anti Armor Legendary .50 cal with Faster firerate and 250 damage resistance while aiming.  A solid heavy gun for someone like you.
---
Bohemia Interactive and DayZ...
---
Love that game too, like a hardcore 76, but it makes this game look perfect in comparison.
---
But yeah, all this game needs is a bit of attention and polish. 
---
Maybe I'm asking too much...
---
I just want a desk fan so bad.
---
Edit: and a car jack.
---
Dammit.  I never get free stuff.
---
This is done purely by bots. Not employees. Not sure what you're hoping for. The system flagged the account and sure customer service can say its fine for now and remove the flag, but that will only result in the system just flagging it again.
---
Don't listen to the trolls. Todd todded it up royally and all of Bethesda is down, not your end
---
You know what, I wouldn't mind if there was a total reset.
---
Correct!
---
please contact "steve" at customer services [https://imgur.com/a/tmWTzI3](https://imgur.com/a/tmWTzI3)
---
I have about the same sort of inventory as you, but dont get any lag equipping weapons or armour or using the quickslot wheel.
---
Herbivore here.  The Communist Protectron junk collector was the best investment ever.  Free food, all herbivore friendly.  I almost never have to cook anymore, and I have the Healing Factor mutation.

I work in an intensive care unit treating COVID patients. (Edited because I can be a dick when I don't get sleep. Fuck night shift.)

1) kill legendary creatures.
---
2) by killing legendary creatures.
---
3) combat rolls have multiple facets, you may be hitting something higher level than you, or something with armor to mitigate your damage, or your SPECIAL points may be allocated differently to increase or decrease your melee dmg rolls.
---
4) PS5 is coming out this christmas (ish) get one of those.
---
5) Heavy Metal can be found by using any genre search for music on your preferred platform, be it pandora, youtube, itunes, or any other.
---
My inventory is a mess of ledgendaries and I dont have any lag at all quickswitching weapons or armour.
---
This is the most blantant copy and paste statement ever made. The ONLY reason survival numbers were down is because Bethesda started making changes to it based on the cry babies in the community. Survival was amazing when it first realeased, then as time went on it slowly became a 1 meta game mode because Bethesda doesnt know what the word balance means.
---
I'm just messing with you man... Are the servers down? ;)
---
I was gonna grab add that ha ha Definitely should be in the build menu
---
Good thing you can just choose to ignore those posts and scroll over them.
---
No, some random person. If someone has peaceful mode off they can destroy camps, even if the other person has peaceful mode on.
---
And how you gonna down vote a factually correct comment?!?
---
Sorry no but I dont wanna spend time trying to play the game
---
I'm gonna have to craft up a bunch of frag mirvs when the game comes back up and give it a try.
---
I have multiple builds, they can all shred mobs. Blaming bloodied when other builds can do the same is lazy stereotyping.

This build is assuming you have the chinese stealth suit. Which you can obtain if you side with the settlers which is pretty easy. With chinese stealth suit you get armor and don't need stealth boys.
---
The one directly to the right of the gramophone was a NW reward
---
Yes now i have to deal with an existential crisis
---
Honestly, I’m okay with most of these boosts. 
---
Exploration - A bit of extra health, while not useful for late game players, could be worse, and the only thing it could be changed to that makes any sense is extra exp from locations, which would be entirely useless for late game players.
---
Hunter - yeah, this could use some help. I don’t think legendaries are common enough for this to be worthwhile. Instead, perhaps a 5/10/15/20 percent chance for a double legendary?
---
Builder - Well... it does help with resource gain. A bit. They could just give a workshop cap discount for the team, and a resource discount as well for building.
---
Role playing - this one’s fine for people still in the main quest line, as there are enough charisma checks to make this worthwhile.
---
Casual - Honestly, while I like the luck boost, a small but generalized exp boost would make more sense. Maxes at 25% extra for everything, or perhaps even less.
---
Im lvl 73 and I'm in love with the Gatling gun. I also have the final word it's a unique 50 cal that's pretty good
---
Haha... You making stuff up and posting it like it's a fact.
---
Damn man.. daddy needs his fix! Been home from work an hour now. I demand satisfaction or else
---
Cause people bunnyhopping with teslas or 1 shotting you while cloaked while almost being immune due to min maxed builds and serendipity and assassin armor was really "fun".
---
Seriously, do you lazy assholes even look before posting? This is like post 43208754b043 about this.
---
That’s understandable, I don’t get why I’m being downvoted for saying the truth though. Cheating and duping items and legendaries is worse than cheesing rep because you still have to grind out the gold and legendary modules for whatever gear you’re getting which still takes a lot of time. With cheating or duping excessively you’re just exploiting the entire game to the point where you shouldn’t even be playing.
---

I kind of like the idea of a Roleplaying group.  I want to be a Chaotic/Neutral Ninja Wizard that stays drunk on Nukashine and launches nukes out of his butt.
---
nobody wants to hire my service and I want someone to make me get reputation by changing low-value things so that they can see that I am trustworthy
---
Because the "private world" is just a copy of the world on Bethesda's servers that only you and up to 7 other people you allow can use.
---
I've checked the roadmap and I've been keeping up on updates but now that they won't be including legendary perks and a colossal problem with update 20, what will actually be new with the update?
---
talkspace.com
---
The problem I see (which was taught to me) is that “when someone does a favor for you, you should return the favor”. So yeah that’s what I seeing from this type of post, you can easily forget about vengeance on someone but not a favor.
---
&gt;mommies with salamis.
---
Is that like Bananas in Pajamas?
---
I tried that today, pacifist mode off I could do no damage to any camp, and I tried a few.
---
Health bars of camp items dropped then jumped right back to their original level when I stop hitting.
---
Or a cap storage system would work too were you can hold the current amount but you can make your own cap stashes with a 50000 cap limit
---
It isn't server maintenance though
---
Message me on xbox saying “fixer plan” il get u 1 gt:soprano 307
---
well there are also situations where people want to 4v4 pvp and now they all have to start hitting each other 1 by 1, it will take like 16 individual hits to get that going
---
and now your low level teammate can accidentally initiate pvp with someone stronger, and they can beat the sh\* out of them, but you cant jump in and help  
---
i dont pvp in this game since january last year because the pvp in this game is shit, and i would rather play CS or valorant, but i think the pvp community has legitimate complaints
---
I'll attempt when the servers are back!
---
Same!
---
That would make the line "are coming down the stairs" have a whole new meaning.
---
There's an entire mode made specifically for PvP, why not play that?
---
Yeah but in most cases when a name gets banned it is not allowed to be reused. Heck, even when you change names in most online games the original name still remains unavailable for others to use.
---
They made you change Blumpkin?
---
I did shotguns at the beginning then switched to heavy guns and pa but I'd recommend doing melee at the beginning and save your mats for later use
---
Don’t read into the guys saying you cheated or were banned. Servers are down. I’m assuming by the obnoxious sarcasm of the previous replies that they’re insinuating that you could have used the search bar for the sub.
---
I’ll save the toxicity and just recommend to search it next time and post if you don’t see any other posts. Other than that, you could use [the official Bethesda server status page](https://bethesda.net/en/status) to check on it next time.
---
Edit: Just so everyone is aware, I will wholeheartedly accept downvotes from anyone toxic enough to reply with something rude or sarcastic instead of simply letting him know. You’re probably hella fun at parties, kids. Stay classy.
---
Woopsie is a great name for an STI
---
Oh look another crybaby complaining about reposts, go play in traffic OP. No one cares
---
As far as I know you get legendary items from successful quests started by high level players. I'm level 40 and have hardly any legenday stuff. I have a three star melee from the Rusty Bucket, that I got on the legendary random giveaway event, but that's about it.  When I join events started by level 1000s, I die badly and often. BUt you still get loot in the end so make your way over to the eastern part of the map and prepare to die.  Bring lots of water.
---
Lots of the higher level players sell off lower level plans (lower thean their current level). Shop around the Vendors. I have no idea about your other stuff. I play on PC and it still gets jerky. And Damage also depends on what you've eaten recently, whether you've played instruments, slept, condition of weapon, etc. I think. Someone will tell me I'm wrong no doubt.
---
edit: if you want is easy XP join events started by lower level players. I don't know..  for some reason, nobody ever comes to my side when I start an event. Maybe lvl 40 is still too low for most players.
---
Neither do we!
---
Naa that's a much smaller ornate one in the burrows :)
---
Here's what i'd come up with as basis, you have 15 stats to put where you wish
---
I also used my own build as base, so it's pretty much my taste in perks/Mutations, you can modify at will/needs ( I have 1/2/3/4/5 levels of adrenaline to make a lots of variation )

Turn on  pacifist in the settings until you want to PvP.  You are protected until a certain level regardless, I think 5.
---
Look for events that have people doing them and join.  You can learn the event and get good rewards.  Don't do events in the SE (cranberry bog), Project Paradise or Radiation Rumble until you're at least 40.
---
If you die you will leave a bag that anyone can loot that contains (practically) everything you have that is classified as junk.  Make sure to put it in your stash regularly or be prepared to lose it.
---
If you're having trouble with radiation, dying removes some radiation damage.
---
Quick travel to your camp, a team mate's camp, Vault 76, and events with an exclamation mark, are free.
---
? When you delete a account ussualy the characters on the account get deleted no?
---
It won't let me sign in on Xbox at this moment it is 6:05 p.m. eastern standard time.
---
Yes--THIS! A thousand times over!
---
We could have a pre war food set to display in our kitchens.
---
????
---
Also if high level players are in the area before you or at the same time it can spawn higher level enemies. Server hopping might help in cases.
---
And how do you think I could possibly know what you do in real life, I'm not psychic.
---
I appreciate your service, but you are complaining about something so incredibly pointless, and more than likely out of the control of Bethesda's hands, you just sounded dreadfully entitled.
---
Anyway, lets not fight, take care, stay safe. ❤
---
Yep... You figured it out all on your own and shared it. That's not how rumors start or anything.
---
Ha ha ha! It is isn’t.
---
Oopsie, I think I gave you Woopsie.
---
A temporarily pinned post on the issue would solve the problem of multiple posts better than giving harsh advice individually to everyone looking for help after they already did the thing. Even if the latter is more cathartic.
---
Biggest problem for me is them moving away before they explode.
---
then why release a useless item? like??? just release another mask rather than a stat item that doesnt do shit to the majority of the players.... yawn
---
Yeah, totally understand what you're saying. But if it is an automated system then someone, a real human preferably, should have to look at the automated flags before actually issuing a warning/ban/rename/etc. Just automatically sending them out seems... lazy, if that is the case.
---
U wot?
---
Can we at least get hourly updates?
---
pvp was one of the most advertised aspects of the game at release
---
That escalated quickly.
---
lol, i feel you.  same exact thing.  sat down with my coffee and nothing. =/
---
I doubt that. I hope so for you but I doubt it. As someone who is a game/software developer himself I can tell you those basic things arent always available sadly. Mostly due to time.
---
this is true
---
Agreed.  Looking back, I should have made him bite it in water so I could revive him and get a merit badge out of the deal.
---
The only way to recover any lost data is to put your PS4 in the microwave on full power for 3 minutes.

You have to change the console language to Finnish after deleting your account, too. Otherwise you're just wasting your time.

All event with a (!) in the middle. 
---
You get anywhere from 2-4 from what I’ve understood. 
---
You then trade the notes to gold afterwards
---
Thanks for the info i just really didnt like that method
---
Aghhhh!! My eyes!
---
Honestly I'm use to new reddit in dark mode, my monitor just exploded.
---
I was indeed taking your post literally. Time for a drink I think. 👍
---
I'm sorry how can you not see the other posts regard the servers being down? There's about 20 different threads about it currently in the sub? 
---
Sort by new maybe next time might bring up stuff from last few hours.
---
Ricochet perk.  Rad resistant perk.  Robot/trapper armor. Stacking radsheilds.  Using radaways.
---
Use or have someone use enforcer on mirelurk queen. Cripple the legs so she can't move. Stay outta poison range. Get naked hungry and dehydrated, use a rad x for 50% more desease chance. Kill any spawn that's not deseased and let those lil bastards nibble on your asshole. You'll get the whoospies
---
All Public Events (everything that has the !)
---
And Riding Shotgun
---
Thanks for the info still i appreciate it
---
My "tipping" is usually just defending their camp if something attacks while I'm there. Or repairing what I can if things get damaged.
---
You’ve been deemed unworthy of playing such a masterpiece
---
Over two hours now.  Most of Bethesda online is down.  Something bad has happened but hope they recover soon.
---
[Status](https://bethesda.net/en/status)
---
Same on xb1 us east.
---
Lol imagine searching for an indirect comment of mine, but wont directly reply to what I said to you. Pathetic.
---
Same here in Idaho. Fallout 76 ps4 down.👀🥺🇺🇸
---
Bethesda just deleted a lot of accounts from people who were reported as cheaters.
---
This is your own fault.
---
Maybe it is all a PR thing and then BAM FONV2! /s
---
Lol didn’t know you could do that
---
Naaa the new 2fa borked the entire Bethesda login service all there games/website are gone down its fun.
---
There I evened it out for you. Haters....
---
Wait is that not how you commented on two of my comments? Damn you love to contradict yourself
---
The quantum sucks. Use the regular nuka grenade.
---
It matters immensely when you start piling on damage multipliers.
---
I guess I'm more in the "pay it forward" mindset.  I would rather help out a newbie in hopes that as they advance they, in turn, help out the newbies they meet.
---
Star lord is that you.

This is my Bloodied Commando Stealth Build. You do get one shot killed very easy if you are not careful but keep your distance and you will take out everything in seconds.
---
(Very) Easy = 2
---
Medium = 3
---
Hard = 4
---
You see that's why I asked
---
&gt; Has anyone found out yet **exactly** which events reward gold and how much? 
---
because some "!" do NOT reward any note. Swarm of suitors for example.
---
 10/10
---
So fallout 76 1st plays get a month for free or is it 1000 atoms? Lol
---
Goes well with liquids from what I’ve heard
---
This is about the same as my built for my unarmed character, except the Stealth Part. I use Bloodied Unarmed &amp; Full set of Uny. Armor; to be honest is one of the most fun, tanky* &amp; powerful build. I really enjoy it 👍🏼
---
is 40% faster swing only
---
This is affecting more than just fallout 76, multiple titles. Either their infrastructure is crumbling, or they are under cyber attack.
---
Would be interesting for sure
---
Or an actual PVP game, 'cause this sure as shit isn't one.
---
You can't post pics on this sub, but you can post links to pics. Upload your pic to imgur and you can paste the link in your post here.
---
Just a pepperoni. We moved from NW to South Jersey, and the pizza is fucking fantastic.
---
Have you actually seen someone with that??
---
Ty
---
You'll find that the most success with them comes from being in a compact space (9 mini grenades exploding in one concentrated spot = 1 ultimate throwable) or with lots of enemies spread out (as you'd probably expect)
---
absolute madlads in this sub, feeling like they‘ve cracked the code or something, lol. ignorance is bliss.
---
I'd like more instruments. I've seen the playable Frame Drum around at various places, but have never seen it in C.A.M.P. build mode. There are also models for an accordion, trumpet, violin, and flute (the accordion and trumpet are obtainable junk items).
---
She is awesome. Her dedication to Fallout 4 has always amazed me, and she's attacked Fallout 76 with the same zeal.  
---
We have recorded some of her big moments in the game, like reaching 1000 hours played, and there are some great clips I'll always cherish.

I tried, couldn’t get it to show the image

Hmm well I’m pretty sure they should. 
---
Sure you didn’t just miss them because of all the other rewards?
---
Sorry if I’m asking stupidly. Just making sure
---
On another note, Bring back the chem Jet. All these junkie builds would love it.
---
Nope. Hence me asking.
---
/sigh
---
I double checked the debuff/buff a lot and even with nothing and all the cards and no gear the thing would not fix a value

please.. I get where youre coming from.. really I do..

but lets just aim a little lower and just get a proper trade dialogue first.. then we can think about extravagant shit...

Preserved pie machine that other players can pay 1 cap to try, but maybe let us select the item inside.

One of the rewards for raider rep is dynamite. It's cheaper to craft than frags, and is just mostly better all round.
---
If y'all know as much as I do, why respond...?
---
jesus christ almighty
---
Its an outage.  Also some players pay monthly for Fallout 1st to get access to a private server.  You cannot expect people to not complain when they pay for a service they are not getting.
---
Because when TSE weapons got duped to hell and were doing insane damage, Bethesda decided to just nerf explosive damage across the board.  They nerfed the hell out of it.  Pretty sure that  grenades suffered from this.
---
Tbh I don't think they'll send a sizable force.. Maybe a recon team or two to find out why they lost contact with whitespring bunker and modus.
---
They'll also investigate why modus is still using the satalite arrays/missiles etc.. and try to re-establish contact to Poseidon oil rig.
---
Atm the enclave are hunkering up at the oil rig creating new tech and equipping it's troops ready to take back the U.S. and re new it's offensive against China.  modus and whitespring bunker aren't top of their agenda and so they'll send a small well trained team or two via vertibird transport
---
The servers have been down since I tried to play at about 2:16 pm Pacific time. Its def not you
---
I just want the mouth harp!
---
did you try turning the servers off. and then back on?
---
I’m getting this on PS4 and have no idea how to cheat in this game
---
Well there is that rumor that Zenimax has a showcase planned for July; this might be FO76 getting reallocated to the Zenimax showcase.
---
If curious of the rumor, just ask on r/starfield
---
You don’t know what Public Events are?
---
Seriously, I have over 900 Treasury Notes.
---
Riding Shotgun - 2
---
Encryptid and SBQ - 4
---
Radiation Rumble - 3
---
Heart of the Swamp - 3
---
Most of the rest are all 2
---
Yeah pretty sure I got two earlier tonight and also many times before from that event. If you let them get to the island so the queen comes, you might not, even though you can still finish the event.
---
This is getting ridiculous.  I'm sorry you guys get the brunt of everyone's frustration. However this is unacceptable, for us to still be waiting 4 hours later for a platform wide issue. Not enough employees? We pay so much money for this game monthly a d through transactions, that it makes this, all the more disheartening.  I fear for the future of this game if this continues. 
---
I'm so close to calling it quits on this game. 😔
---
Sure dude im about to sleep so gonna be tomorrow il message u when im on
---
Not to mention glowing &amp; hardened mass can drop up to 3 at once. Something is off, lol
---
That was beautiful
---
I think it’s because instigating you get guarantied double damage at full health if you hit and normally that’s a one shot on non-auto rifles. With two shot I believe one bullets has a chance of missing while the other one hits. So that would make instigating more popular. That’s just my theory but it makes sense.
---
what are the buffs associated with crops you can plant and those that are only wild?
---
maybe its related to that...
---
There's a large group of players who \*want to pvp,\* but don't, because pvp is broken and shitty.
---
Probably
---
You feel enlightened in the presence of the Wise Mothman.

I have better things to do then keep a collection of all the reasons to dislike Bethesda. Just read what they say in their updates.

Fantastic, looks like the moderator didn't like our prior back and forth, it was deleted.
---
Well looks like enough people reported you that it flagged your account :(
---
I don't have much to use it on as I don't use much gunpowder anymore so I regularly throw it away.  I'll keep a few hundred on me just in case and not pick up gunpowder as gunpowder's weight can't be reduced.

I have crickets as the common spawn at my camp and I do Irrational Fear whenever I see it so I'm getting acid all the time.

Agreed.  I removed those form the post to focus on the base idea.  The feature creep is real!

I can't connect on PC.

Its getting boring now please stop🙏

For the same reason people don't crop quoted text on forums, probably. All I'm sayin' these days is that *Idiocracy* is actually a documentary.
---
It should and did for me the last time I checked
---
Plasma, Mirv, regular Nuka grenades and orbital strikes. I got like 40 of each in my inventory all the time just to spam them all the way down. They are powerful even without demo expert. Everything else, including the new ones are weak. The dynamite bundle is also usable.
---
That's a great idea and I would love to see it implemented!
---
That might be correct. Haven’t checked it yet. 
---
But distinguished guests gives notes even if you don’t find all the plates. Just did that today
---
Two shot doesn't do 2x damage.

The game is barely 2 years old. Give it another 2 more years for text chat.

---
Who spilled their drink on the equipment and fried the server, was it Todd, it was wasn't it?
---
It should. But it was nerfed to 1.25x I believe
---
youre right that makes logical sense, thats how it used to be when the game first came out and it was broken strong and they nerfed it
---
That’s a bummer
---
We're experiencing a service outage right now and it may be hitting [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) services as well. Can you try again once we're back up and running?   
---
That’s what I’ve heard, thanks!

It used to be this way but it was nerfed.

 &gt; We're experiencing a service outage right now and it may be hitting [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) services as well. Can you try again once we'r...
---
I'm confused, what does this do?
---
Lvl 340 here with 3 alts at level 250+ and I've done everything that you suggested.  I also try riding shotgun but even that has a 1 hour cooldown.  There is no reason for anyone to join a server and have zero public events available.  IMO there should always be at least one active.
---
I don't know shotguns well enough to advise on them specifically, but if you were to run that build without swapouts, three 2-rank shotgun damage cards (45% damage) is better than two 3-rank cards (40% damage). Eventually you could have all full-rank cards along with a set of two-rank cards to fine tune things on the go, but as a starter I'd go for the 2-rank versions.
---
Beyond that... without godroll unyielding this is probably going to be a rough build, but I don't have the equivalent in the field myself. My unarmed chick is nonbloodied but has a potential bloodied variant should I choose to go that way; for now she has tankiness stacked and even though people say armor has diminishing returns at some point, I find for facetanking without power armor, the more armor the better and it's mostly coming from her perk cards and mutations.
---
The build you have linked looks like a half-bloodied half-nonbloodied build (and that's not counting the swapouts) that is perhaps desperately in need of sneak perks and something like Dodgy instead of White Knight, but again, I'm not sure I'm qualified to advise on this particular build, not knowing what gear you might have or whether you're already making it work in some sense. O.o
---
Oh! But you only really need one rank of concentrated fire, as it scales poorly and most of the point of getting it in the first place is being able to target limbs. So there's a point that can get moved elsewhere or used on something else. And hopefully any of this wall-of-text is useful, I really should not be on reddit when I haven't slept in a while. XD
---
Edit: Eh, I had a go at a nonbloodied theorycraft rearrange for ya, this may or may not be useful but here we go (and I don't think I'd even try a bloodied variant of this because too much is going on, although swapping Serendipity in for Bloody Mess would be a start): https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f476888&amp;d=s92se2ss2pc2p00c72ic4l71as2sg2am2ck0i12lu2lt2a00ej4sd0so0sp0a80eh1&amp;w=ce0cd1cu0&amp;m=1ce89fg&amp;n=Shotgun%2FUnarmed%20Hybrid%202

I have to say that up until just a few days ago, I really haven't had DC issues (and I hope I'm not jinxing myself by saying that).  Considering the issues this afternoon, I'm wondering if all the DC's I've had this week have been related.  I've put in 630 hours since I picked up the game mid-April and really haven't had many connection related issues (the bugs are a different story, of course).
---
Being in the same server as a duper caused loads of people to get false flagged in the original bamwaves!
---
Ew
---
should have been done long long ago.
---
I’m in California, keep getting “server error 3:0:844424930263042”
---
Have you tried turning it off &amp; back on again?
---
Swarm of Suiters does if you win it. If the queen shows up you lost.
---
It's not just about 4v1, it's about tricking people into flagging for pvp also.
---
Right okay I think I get it now. Two shot is damage + a little bit extra whilst instigating is guaranteed 2x at first
---
You need to keep driving to Austin
---
What should you do?
---
Take a break, go outside...
---
Jokes on you, I don't have a day job because the US economy has collapsed!
---
Lets face it this and the legendary perks are garbo they stopped trying yo make this game have more late game content a long time ago.
---
Play NW. You'll feel differently after you get continually noob tubed by an unending string of tube noobers.
---
Very cool idea!
---
Each projectile does 65% of total damage. So 30% extra overall. I believe.
---
The second bullet doesn't do full damage.  It was nerfed several updates ago.  Also the accuracy on TS weapons is terrible.  A lot of times the second projectile misses the target. So instigating offers more bang power.  But you lose damage after that first shot. I am a bloodied build but would consider furious weapons if I wasn't.  The increased damage with each additional hit on an enemy comes in handy I would imagine.
---
I am tasting a bit of salt
---
Only way to be sure, quest items and all!
---
so that's why when I looked up the error code the bethesda website wasn't working lol
---
Time will tell.
---
I think MOST players will go for more xp, but I'm like you and would rather have something more interesting.
---
Also I don't think that the extra END is giving more HP in the test servers at least.
---
Awesome!  I’ve been waiting to try this!  Thanks for being the communal lab rat :)
---
Flame trap?
---
I have zero interest in NW and any other battle royal for that matter.
---
Thanks, Interesting how everyone remembers it differently, or maybe she has a wide range of weapons at her disposal, in which case my research has completed. I’d like to see a photo before closing the book.
---
Suppose this is why servers are down they attacked bethsda ?
---
At least you're just bummed and not making an entitled dumpster fire of a post like this. I've been playing since the last free weekend and this is the only time I've seen the game go down randomly for more than a matter of minutes but this person is talking about "occasional service outages we face" as if this is a common thing.
---
Maybe it was just a veil way for them to complain about the grind, though.
---
Only if you fail (let the Queen appear)
---
The latest release of skyrim server edition had unforseen consequences
---
No. The outage is actually getting worse.
---
Huh. I always thought it was just a funny way of saying pumpkin.
---
Woopsie is babies. 100%. I can't attest to the Woopsie STI...
---
Lol jk lil man was totally planned and wanted ;)
---
And that’s if both of the projectiles land! So you could be risking doing just 65% if you land only one of the bullets
---
They do the limits and the timers all set differently the way they do to corp telling them to min max the player hook like mobile same way you have to pay for fo1st to cover the craptasic engine choice, there's still 10 year old exploits floating around live in 76 code. Less then a week after the vending and displays came back up there was duping again. 
---
There's 2 teams in fo76 the Devs who love there work and want to make a great product and the corp scum sucking fuckwads who's sole job is to milk as much money and metrics out a you as they can.  Problem comes in when guess who has the final say.
---
How'd you do that??
---
The vending machines are so damn ugly I stuff them behind a wall so you can trade through the windows
---
This is how I mostly remember it too. I thought it was a crappy rifle, and she spent more time taking a knee than helping me clear a path.
---
If you don't use it, definitely sell it! You can easily get 50c+ per Bulk in your Vending Machine. *Easily*. Probably even sell it at 7c a Scrap! I'd buy it.
---
Haha thanks I was like oh god I must’ve bought a duped mounted Santa crash!
---
I got my b2525 fixer from fasnacht. All other weapons I had to trade my soul for lol
---
Gotta get it from the guy that mailed him a box of Bobby pins
---
Yeah, I’m not a big fan either
---
You can use flame throwers and break stuff like couches and etc... then move the conduit into the yellow outline area
---
It hides it the best (outside of the wall/door method)
---
Flame throwering the shelves **can** kind of work, but you still have to stack items and rugs to get there into position
---
If anything clips, it loses it’s mesh, and turns invisible. If you go to build mode it becomes this bright green place holder outline
---
I worked in Atlantic City New Jersey for just about 20 years. In fact Wildwood on oak Street was actually where I lived
---
Correct sir. But after that hit the rifles becomes normal again. Whereas 2 shot gives you + 25% all the time. 
---
Depends on your build really imo
---
Lmgtfy posts are best. Thank you, good sir!
---
Haha thanks
---
They can. They choose not to.
---
The easiest and cleanest way is to put the items you want to display on top of your shelf, then take the shelf (with items on top) to the ground outside. Find an area where the shelf seems to sink into the ground a little as you move it around, then drop it there. You’ll notice the items on top drop inside a little. Repeat until the items sit on the shelf as desired. Put it back inside your camp. Done.
---
I couldn’t get on since 230p. So I went to Apple TV and watch some more Star Trek Next Generation 🤣
---
2 factor authentication, security code enable etc got added today... Apparently didn't go so well
---
Babies seem more like. OMFUCKINGGAWD!
---
I’m going for a stealth rifleman build, and I’m not a great fan of the concept on being low on health so I’d most likely go for instigating in that case. Thanks for the info!
---
Okie dokie.
---
The new two factor authentication will be that you need to buy a new copy of Skyrim each time.
---
Explosive flamer. Crazy fun.
---
I’m going to stick my finger into the USB port and end it all
---
Two shot has been a medicore prefix ever since fo4. Bethesda only nerfed explosive and two shot combination.

Bloodied limb dmg Mr. Handy Buzz Blade. just hold the trigger and shredder everything that walks through your way.

Hiw is that possible
---
Stupidity. Anyone over the age of twelve doing this should go outside for a bit. And anyone over 18? Pretty sure it ain't getting you chicks.
---
Any thoughts on how that would work? It can't really slow down time anymore and its ap regen is already covered by other consumables.
---
I’m going for a stealth rifleman build trying to one tap enemies, so instigating sounds like the much better option. Thanks for the info!
---
Courier as in being a middle man in trades?
---
I LOVED SURVIVAL, especially that 2x XP
---
That what I’m doing as well. So I think that the right choice. And no prob. Good hunting
---
Jesus. Of course. They cant just revert it and try again some other time? Lol like wtf
---
Use the merge trick!

Edit: I think it's worth noting that the bounding box of the Fusion Reactor is a bit bigger than the vending machine's, except for the vending machine's keyboard that sticks out and can be interacted with. So to browse through items, I added a sign that reads "use the keyboard".
---
'This Mary Poppins, is he cool?'
---
Thanks. I played through it a few times and wasn’t paying close attention, but I’m positive that one of those times she was using a rifle. With the variety of responses here it’s possible she has a wider selection of guns than I expected.
---
Great minds think alike!
---
I think they know that, with how it is now, people are more likely to sink their precious hours. But that's just fucking rotten dude lmao. I've been grinding farm routes more than playing that actual game in the passed 2 weeks. I think they can and NEED to find a better balance. Like I enjoy grinding, but I also enjoy doing events and quests with a gun I actually like.
---
Fast traveling in 14.. 13.. thumbs up.
---
Lol, I fell for it once. I thought they wanted the little junk I dropped

Wow always something to learn, great tip
---
Everything from the amusement park I want bumper cars and roller ball

That's deep bro.

Did you study liberal arts?

That's whats happening right now, you try rolling back a massive security update from live servers, it's real easy
---
Quad double barrel shotgun.  8 shots before reloading is nice, and its the most powerful of all the shotguns.
---
i just rolled a bloodied faster fire rate fixer on my commando 
---
an its nuts the dmg it puts out is crazy! 
---
but i always remember to hold back for events with other people around 
---
don't wanna be that guy not letting anyone else get a hit in lol
---
Also a good point
---
Would this work with multiple items on each level of the shelf
---
That bug that's in the game now is so bad it prevents allot of players to play the game so it causes a bad name for Fo76 pls fix
---
I did chainsaw leveling and doing berserker's currently with random weapons the only one I missed was the joy of legendary rippers because at the time I said why would I do that?! ..I was a fool haha..the most common weapon I use most of my friends consider useless is the railway rifle I get a joy from that sound.
---
Some trap camps are genuinely solveable and may have "prizes" at the end
---
OK thanks!
---
Thanks dude
---
Yes they'll make an exception for one unplanned day of accidental outage just for you.
---
Junkies Bow with explosive mod.
---
On rare occasions the arrow will glitch and hit an enemy only to them fly straight up then fall on the enemy exploding on impact. Rather funny watching it.
---
I actually remember this! I played about 30 hours at launch and I never remembered seeing 3\* drop anything but. I don't mind having the chance of a shitty drop, but cmon! Finding a 3\* legendary is hard enough as is Bethesda.
---
Roleplayed the mobster on my commando when wastelanders came out. Did it all using a .45smg and a combat knife. That was prolly the most fun sneaking bh enemies dropping 2 with the gun and 1 with the knife. Felt good... 😉
---
I just want the succulents to come back please
---
All good!
---
Railway Rifle.  Hands down.
---
No problem.  You could also look at Junkies.  Day Tripper, Mentats, Daddy O, Med X and alcohol addictions have the least side effects.  You only have to get addicted once unless you take addictol for some reason.  It is a flat 50% damage increase.
---
Also if you can play at 49% health, the adrenal reaction mutation serum kicks in at that level and you cam use unyielding armor to recover points lost to addictions.  
---
I played a stealth junkie commando this way and enjoyed it.  You can use barbarian and Evasive to give yourself more DR since you are playing at half health.
---
I'm sure Todd is personally working on allowing you to do that tomorrow.
---
I've been saying this change should be implemented since launch. Just a couple of dudes having a go at each other. 
---
While they're at it, bethesda should also change the instigation system. You tag them, they tag you, then a countdown begins and when the timer hits 0, you both have at it. Makes fights much more fair vs tagging someone and then they can immediately damage you.
---
Oh yeah, this one is good too.  Probably #2 on my list.
---
a free states quest would be kinda cool with npc's
---
*laughs in two shot auto grenade launcher*
---
How much do you sell my fusion cores for? I’m a bit new to reading and so I have devised a system where I put the price of the fusion cores equal to the amount of charge left in it. E.g. if it is 80/100 I list it for 80 caps. Is this a good idea?
---
Yeah this is the real trick. Someone nuked the area and I was super confused until I stumbled on that area of Tanagra town. Materials for days.
---
Two-shot faster reload  MIRV launcher. Sooooomany mininukes
---
I log in every day for my gold (except today apparently) and they got me... can't they just leave this one in for a little bit :( gonna do some farming I might actually have to keep pack rat on for the hardened mass
---
They can and do adjust drop rates of items constantly. During an event period such as Fasnacht or Christmas scorched when they hand out easy scrips, my chance to get nocturnal bashing pistols goes through the roof. After the events are over the drop stats go back to normal.
---
yea the past few attempts i made at this, there was a level 33 assaultron. 1 hit and i'm dead. this is fun. also where the eff am i supposed to get so much black titanium?
---
lmaooo, u right u right. This game is all about fucking patience huh Bethesda????
---
Everyone cried how unfair it was that TSE was so OP in the failed experiment of PvP thus they nerfed the hell out of explosive and two shot got gimped hard also.   
---
Basically they took fun away knowing it wouldn't solve shit.
---
That's weird then. I always go solo and come back to a fucked up camp
---
I rolled a TS Plasma Caster and took it for a ride...oh wow, its not bad...its Terrible! 
---
The slow, glow-in-the-dark plasma rounds really display the terrible accuracy nerfs of the double shot far better than rapid almost invisible bullets.  I watched one volley hit a distant target almost perfectly, and the next sent one in to the ground less than half distance, while the second went high over the targets head.
---
Honestly it's not worth the extra 25% buff if both somehow manage to hit the target when it's just as likely you'll get a 35% nerf as one misses, or worse still a 100% nerf as both vanish on their own trajectories.
---
 I will choose the 1 time, +100% damage followed by standard damage &amp; accuracy every single time.
---
Amen! NW may not be perfect, but (at least on console) it's largely a matter of skill and tactics. I think if PVP in adventure mode was more like NW, many people would be less opposed.
---
I’ll bear this in mind, thank you!
---
I think it would reduce the necessity to travel about if we could provide all our needs from the camp. We know Bethesda want players to walk about more.
---
I have come across more interesting places and random creatures while walking.
---
We're still here though in spite of all that,  but the game just gets worse and worss.
---
yes just yes and it free to travel there
---
This is a great idea! Though, the idea for automatically having a plot when you load in would be an inconvenience for newer players, considering they won’t have many caps to pay the rent you propose. Maybe it would be better to have the option to have players go to the hub and claim a plot manually, that way they can sell when they want. Or at least have a minimum level requirement to sell. But overall, it sounds really good!
---
They did threaten to take down servers tho, and hitting Besthda as a whole,is more likely to make a point.
---
Wait fallout down?
---
I actually noticed that the first legendary drop you got from your first Fasnacht event this year had a very high chance of being something very good. I got a 3\* BE Lever Action, and I saw a bunch of people roll fixers, handmades and all the good shit from that first event.
---
Sure not, yesterday it happens to me
---
It was a lot of fun being a Raider in the beginning.
---
In addition to all the replies here explaining that two shot only does 25% more damage, the TS is also wildly inaccurate.  Probably why it gets much hate now.
---
Lol, your experience with two shot doesn’t sound very pleasing to say the least. I’m defo gonna use instigating (if I ever find one that isn’t tagged onto a rolling pin)
---
10mm smg is hella fun with 45 round drum
---
Maybe YOU didn't see it, but I'm in groups that do PvP daily.
---
First weapon I truly enjoyed was using an instigating lever action with crit damage, seeing those clean one shots made using a level 35 weapon fun until all the way until level 90
---
I can tell you this much. If you don’t have the backpack yet, yes. Do it
---
I have the PS Messages app on my phone. I can message anyone with just their PSN name.  No friends request required and you don’t have to leave the game to do it.
---
Looks like most of Bethesda is down according to the server status page!!!
---
It bothers me because it makes rare items not special at all. This is for players like you and me that get excited about finding rare things or getting rare drops. I've been legit looking for the red asylum outfit. It's the only one I'm missing. Then I hear people had duped it. I'm wondering now if they just took it out of the game completely. If they didn't and by chance I did find it..then it's just not even worth wearing anymore because everyone will think I duped it or bought it off a cheat.  So I'm done looking for that. It bothers me because rare things are what I like looking for in the game. On another note, about rare items.. I used to fight through level 78 ghouls to get the Undamaged Tri Fold Flag and Untarnished Coffee Pot to sell in my vendor. Now with Wastelanders.. they have both just sitting in the overseers house! Grrr. What's rare anymore in this game? Nothing.
---
That's strange, idk how to help you with that. Are you well fed? It must be something you're missing.
---
Someone probably messed up that new multi-factor authentication they added.
---
I’m not about inaccuracy so I doubt I’m going to use it. Thanks for the info!
---
Yes the possum backpack is worth the challenges, idk why the servers are down, and maybe with animal friend and wasteland Whisperer perks
---
Same lol. They didn't even touch Harper's so I went out of curiosity. Was really glad I had an auto grenade launcher with me. The nice thing there is they keep dropping more ammo too.
---
They exploded with confetti! I popped them every time I saw one.
---
LOL These guys are absolute idiots, get this when the game came out there was no push to talk neither they said it was a feature that you cant stop the convo. A feature to hear some kids mom yell at him to come get some doritos or something. I sincerely think Todd Howard cries himself to sleep wishing he had just done a multiplayer mod to fallout 4 while someone rubs his head saying it just works.
---
Enjoy.  If you are on Xbox let me know and I have a some Junkies weapons.  I have a J 1* HM you could try out before going all in.
---
TS is 62.5% of base dmg per shot I believe, combined you get 125% of base dmg. 2nd “shot” of the TS may or may not land, depending on the time of day and which way the wind is blowing. Instigating is 2x base dmg if target is full health.
---
I believe I have most of this right, maybe not. Definitely not an expert
---
Not always the case and you're over generalizing.  I know folks that PvP in Fallout and in other games as well and do just fine :)
---
How do you get the craziest numbers? I'm using a ** bolt lever rifle with all the rifle perks and I only crit for 1200 once.
---
Oh i was talking about the drops at murmrgh’s. Yes i saw people reporting good hourly drops too, but percentage wise it’s hard to estimate. I did the event maybe 200 times and only got a handful ranged weapons, everything else was one star melee and armors.
---
In your opinion.  There are plenty that disagree, just not in the Reddit echo chamber.
---
Thanks dude! I’m only level 30 something but if you add me on Xbox (gt is doublejazzy) and shoot me a message we can play some time!
---
I was wondering the same thing haven't been able to play for about a hour or so
---
Two-shot has strength in consistently applying its damage regardless of what it’s shooting at and what condition that target is in. It’s always going to be giving you that 25% damage boost so long as you can get all bits on target, which is easier said than done when you consider that it also grants a significant penalty to weapon accuracy. It also plays well with abilities and effects that scale with hitting a target, such as the Enforcer perk: every hit has a chance to cripple. Two shot directly supports this. 
---
Instigating is one of the best solo-play effects when dealing with standard enemy types. Want to quickly clear out West Tek? Grab an instigating weapon, go it alone and go to town. It’s a great farming effect. Where it falls down is that it’s damage is highly conditional and doesn’t play well within groups and/or events. If you’re not the sole source of outgoing damage against the enemy then Instigating quickly loses its value. If you can’t kill your enemy with the one hit then it also feels lacking. I sometimes see people try to mitigate this by looking for explosive instigating weapons to add some additional damage, but this is a mistake: explosive effects nullify armour-penetrating perks and mods making your initial instigating shot less effective, and the explosive damage has a chance to deal chip damage to nearby enemies. When you try and kill them, Instigating will no longer apply.
---
So, in conclusion: Two shot is a “stand and deliver” style effect that works well enough for most engagements and can shine in certain specific set ups. Instigating can be devastating, but is brittle. You can’t rely on it to carry you through every engagement.
---
ohh that makes sense. And yeah, that BE Lever Action was the only legendary worth while that I got from it.
---
Hacked weapons, Tesla stealthboy users. Just a bunch of children throwing a tantrum because they can no longer be allowed to ruin a game for others. Its truly sad this was not introduced long ago when the duping started. One teammate forgets pacifism is off and all of a sudden im gunned down and my stuff stolen. This is not fun or fair and this will be a joyous moment when introduced.
---
Are you saying that minorities shouldn't be listened to?
---
Does this method take up the camp budget?
---
It was definitely more balanced at release then it is now, so im confused by what your even trying to say. Those armor effects being nerfed was the only good balance change Bethesda made. All we needed was some well thought out damage caps based on weapon type, but they lazed their way thorugh it and didnt think of the repercussions. PvP being dead in this game is Bethesda's fault, the player base was there, but left because of incompetence.
---
That is a fantastic idea! Maybe make a separate stash container for your plot. Or perks/bonus challenges associated with sales.
---
I’ve seen them for sale for 300 in machines before so I bet you will get some good sales at that price.
---
Has anyone tested mods for fallout 4 and skyrim as well? I cant login to anything Bethesda and I was terrified that I got banned because I recently crafted alot of ammo and I thought they might've thought I duped ammo
---
I imagine it takes up a bunch
---
Last time I did the event I intentionally let the queen appears to get its meat for the raider at Ohio River and it still gives me treasury notes after I killed the queen, but I only got notes and no other rewards.
---
Awesome!
---
&gt; cause legendaries in this game meant that pvp could never be good. 
---
Well that's not true. Destiny has pvp, despite depending on gear.
---
The difference is, there's different rules to pvp vs the main gamemode.
---
&gt; even after all the nerfs and changes it was still a shit show, and it only made adventure mode worse cause griefers dont have the skill for fair pvp.
---
Like I said, there's a large group of players who want to play a good fallout 76 pvp, but don't want to because the pvp gameplay is shitty and unbalanced. Additionally, the TSE nerf didn't fix the actual broken pvp legendaries (explosive lasers)
---
Loads of people want an actual fallout 76 pvp, but they don't want to play a battle royale/deal with legacy weapons/deal with the million ways the game discourages pvp.
---
I lol'd when I saw 3% of nukes Ive got to admit..
---
Same with The Dragon.  I've come across a few Legendary Black Powder Rifles, but no Dragons and no mods either.
---
I think I’ll stick to instigating as it has a higher chance of killing enemies in one shot, and that’s what I’m going for. Thanks for the super detailed info!
---
I had a couple players do this when I first left the vault. It was amazing. This game is my first online game since Ultima Online in the 90's...(showing my age here) and I didnt even want to try it out because I figured y'all would kill me. Lol.
---
Almost everyone is very kind. Even at level 50 I have higher levels giving me things still.
---
So, I pay it forward. If i see lower levels i give them stimpacks and disease cures and anything else i have they can use.
---
It's a great community and I'm glad i decided to join it.
---
The things I’ve bought just to reduce my cap pool.  Caps are the only resource limited by quantity.  Cap cap is crap.
---
I would check the fo76 sub and see if anyone has posted about it..
---
That’s an organic god roll so lucky you!👍
---
You’ve been caught in the ban wave!
---
dude even with a guarantee 3 star there is like 25 range weapons,  25 melee weapons and 100 pieces of armor. thats a 1/150 chance that you get the item you want. And then 1/20 that it has the prefix so without even considering the rest theres a 1/3000 that the item dropped is the item with a prefix you want. They can leave it to 3star guarantee and nothing would change.
---
For what?
---
Will do.  Now is the time to shop the vendors.  A lot of people have lower level legendaries left over from the Fasnacht event.
---
I love the snark and all, and I use lmgtfy at work as necessary, but in this case the results generated didn’t really answer the OP question.
---
Ps4 Us still down
---
Sounds about right, thanks for the info!
---
Yeah, you can tame a cat, but the spawn point is on the North-East side of the map. If you're a low level then I'd wait until at least level 50 before venturing that far from the safety of the Forest. I'm level 106 and The Mire still puts me on edge 😂
---
I think you are right. I think I get notes either way.
---
I’ve been using the flame-trap blending techniques to make place TV’s into walls and I must say I’m very happy with it. It’s a glitch that has some fantastic potential/application.
---
Hunter's Long Coat.
---
Two Shot Fat Man. On 'Line in the sand' event especially. Evaporating scorched all at once.
---
I have seen youtube videos of that being done... I would say that if it happened to me I would...but thats why you can get names of the people
---
I just want the ability to grow my own pumpkins. And harvest seeds from them for Grenades. Pumpkin Grenades aren’t even that powerful it wouldn’t be overpowered if they gave me unlimited seeds even
---
People say it's a 10% chance but I've run that event 50+ times and never gotten it until I found it at a players vendor for 10k caps. I didnt hesitate lol
---
I mean, yes I am aware the chances are still ridiculous, but just the pure disappointment of getting a 1\* after working so hard to kill something is just too ridiculous sometimes. I think a lot more people would be okay with getting a low tiered 3\*.
---
I’ll be sure to do some server hopping in that case
---
Nobody:
---
Half this thread: I didnt dupe nothin
---
Let me grab my Nukashine. Be right there
---
lol you sir want the chaos!!!!!!!! I was just making a joke....oh welll bring it on!!!!
---
I bought it for 10k then I got it the next time I did the event :/
---
There is no need to bother the Oil Rig Enclave, when there is a known government bunker just a few miles down the road from WV in Virginia, Which is Mount Weather. Hell, even Raven Rock, which is a different bunker, could play a role before the Oil Rig.
---
I have all 5 vanguard pieces but 0 have sent or AP lol. I have 2 S and 2 P and one E. I try and do one ranged weapon and 1-2 legendary modules a day though
---
Needs to be like 1/3 price purveyor.
---
Back when first started playing, I always wanted to give back when people helped me out. The best I could do was stimpaks, pies that I cooked, or flowers. Somehow, people appreciated the flowers the most and I always received messages about how nice/cute/kind that was. 
---
Now when I help newcomers out and they want to give me probably their very limited resources like stimpaks or ammo, it makes me smile so much. Especially transitioning from extremely toxic and competitive online games to Fo76, it makes my day (that I hope as much as I made theirs).
---
Mabey not garanteed 3 star but maybe gear on the higher end cuz yea I got 2 star bloodied handmade on my very first run
---
Line in the Sand - 3
---
Uranium Fever - 3
---
Let's try getting the servers up and running first
---
Same here, not the greatest fan of using clunky power armor and constantly having to use fusion cores, so better off just flipping them
---
Todd has had a break down with all the complaints and deleted all our characters and took the servers down.
---
I’m really sorry to hear that, maybe sell it in your vendor for 11k? Get compensated for your troubles!
---
That seems pretty common.
---
&gt; I’m about to get downvoted I feel it
---
wow you were right!
---
Servers are overencumbered and cannot run.
---
You may be on top of a creature spawn, critters can break camp items. Could be Scorch Beasts they wreck things fast.
---
*laughs out loud, alarming the cats*
---
It was definitely not a 100% guarantee on the 3\*, but I found that a lot of people got desirable rolls on that first event drop.
---
If you open a support ticket, they'll give you Atoms that you missed-out on usually. I've been able to do it twice.
---
Y'all are thinking too small, pentuple XP is the new path forward
---
i dunno man.. check the fo76 sub and see if anyone has posted about it
---
If you read the front page you'd know
---
I hope they never do live service game again
---
I sold it for about 15k eventually, I was just a little salty
---
They tried to implement 2fa and fucked everything up lmao
---
I loved warlock in Wrath. Old demonology was my favorite.
---
I wonder if they kept track of how many stationary spins were performed.
---
Nope just you.
---
(try hitting "new" and reading down)  :)
---
Atleast boss monsters like cmon.
---
Also, the instigating will do 2x damage until the server realizes that you have injured an enemy.  So because of lag, automatic fast firing instigating weapons often get up to 4 hits at double damage before the damage falls off.
---
It attracts animals, then explodes when they get close.   
---
When you come across a trap base, toss some on it, let the animals do the work.
---
And isn't that sad.
---
Vats is bugged, still. And explosive weapons seem to have issues with vats.
---
Two shot m79 grenade launcher
---
1. Taming a Cat? Yes - but be warned, you will return to camp and find all your furniture scratched up and your display case items on the floor.
---
2. Why are the servers down? A wizard did it
---
3. Possum Backpack? There are pluses and minuses to the possum backpack mods. you can get upgrades like increased armor (90 DR) or increased radiation resistance - but it comes as a cost of decreased capacity. So the basic backpack without upgrades holds 50 or 60 pounds (i can't remember). Using the armor mod (for example) will give you increased DR but will cut the capacity in half. So it is really up to you as to what you value more.
---
Sorry, that will cost 23,000 ATOMs, we don’t use dollars here.
---
Yeah, I dont think I’m ever going to bother with Encrypted ever again
---
Is this sarcasm? Because the forum is down
---
Agree. I run levers and it's the best for stealth sniping. West Tek is a one shot paradise. My Istigating can easily get 800+ per shot and near 2k with crits.
---
I back it up with a semi auto TSE handmade in case stealth bugs out and you get mobbed. Works great and shoots as fast as you can pull the trigger.
---
I didn't even know about the flame trap technique! I'm just using uneven terrain so far to merge stacked items. I'll give it a try for sure.
---
Have you tried to unplug it, wait ten seconds and plug it back in?
---
There's about 20 posts asking the same thing, all saying yes, so logically I have no idea!
---
In all seriousness yes. It's not just FO76 either. It's a Bethesda problem
---
God no there not smart enough for that bugthesda did it to themselfs they rolled out 2fa login today and borked there login servers
---
Here is what I don’t understand about the whole duplicated item stuff and getting banned for having them.  Now, I never called myself a gamer.  I don’t have any platinum trophies and don’t care to, but I don’t get why they banning people for doing what the game allows you to do.  I remember back in the day, I use to buy the games code book and there was special codes to put into the game that gives you an advantage, what’s the difference?
---
Drop the explosive. You lose more damage from “switching off” Tank Killer than you gain back from the additional explosive round.
---
If only you could with settlers.
---
Maybe y’all forgot to repair and  power-up Poseidon, Monongah, and Thunder Mountain?
---
8,646,057 mask awarded...but what were the %'s for each type.
---
I assume the vast majority of events ended with perfect survival rates (95%+ of the many I took part in) so did the amount of rare masks approach 5% as the data mines suggested?
---
FYI I popped many, many balloons. I arrived early once and concentrated on killing them...there were a lot hidden away in such a small space!
---
Lol no. If your dumbass level 16 friend attacks a level 200 in full PA unprovoked, they deserve to get thrashed. Also who the fuck meets up like a 50's gang to have 4 v 4 pvp in the streets? Come off it.
---
This is exactly why I turned on pacifist mode.  Stupid idiots who get in the way of your shots when an event like scorched Earth ends so they can two shot you because you're at like quarter health so they can steal your stable flux from the event.
---
&gt;I was expecting to be a huge end game dungeon type affair
---
It was never intended to be that and was never sold as such. It is the final act in a story driven DLC with human  NPCs.  I would put it on the same level as a silo run, and slightly more challenging than West Tek. White Springs has always been a complete joke.  I have never understood the fixation with that goddamn place.
---
They've deleted quest items from my inventory before!
---
I swap to power armor with the emergency protocols mod for queen fights.
---
It works pretty well.
---
Don’t think so
---
I dont blame you, you have to deal with clueless players and the one shot deathbeam of the imposter sheepsquatch
---
I wish they kept a NPC-FREE survival server for us, and just put wastelanders in adventure mode with limited workshop pvp or even none. Sure survival needed work and balance.. But they didn't even try, they just gave up. It's sad because a rust like Fallout server would be so much fun.
---
A little off-topic, but Is this just me or does anyone else wish that noise when you pop a balloon at the parade would also plan whenever you kill a Floater? xD
---
I'll wait until their current server issues are taken care of, then see if they show up when I can log in again. If they haven't shown then I'll contact support.
---
We all make mistakes in the heat of passion Jimbo.
---
Ok thanks.  I dont even know what the front page that guys was talking about. I am fairly new
---
[https://bethesda.net/en/status](https://bethesda.net/en/status) nope.
---
I find the explosive affix to be incredibly satisfying
---
Nah it’s me too PS4
---
Nope. Good thing Bethesda chose probably the busiest time of the day to take them offline for maintenance.
---
I sell full fusion cores at 50 caps a piece, and partially depleted ones at 25.
---
Explsoive shotties took a big hit in patch 11
---
Well Kristof,
---
I'm glad you took your time to reply to me.
---
If you google"f76 treasury note events" and click the first link which is the fallout76 wiki ( the number 1 source of information about the game btw) You will see that it clearly states that all public events provide you with treasury notes.
---
There is also a plethora of youtube videos on the subject.
---
I rest my case.
---
\*mic drop\*
---
(to be honest i'm just tired of seeing posts about simple shit people can just google)
---
Keep after it. You will get there someday. I have rolled around 80 pieces across all the slots combined and I haven't gotten a single sentinel or cavalier piece yet. I could easily build a full set of safecracker's pieces or water breathing if I want those. With how awful my luck has been someone out there has to be getting good pieces and maybe that someone could be you.
---
The very first day I started playing when wastelanders hit, the very first camp I came across had been loaded with had to be 50 sirens and as many tuba chairs you can craft and there were five people on the mics cackling. It was the funniest/weirdest thing I've ever seen in a game. So yes, what you explained is completely believable and just the tip of the iceberg. People are weird and this game gives you the tools to be extra weird. I love it!
---
Yes you can.
---
Ive got 2 pieces I roll about 20 pieces a week
---
A bloodied explosive shot pump shotgun. Shotguns are fairly poop in this but I learnt some mods, whacked a suppressor on, had great fun. Sold it for maybe just over a thousand caps? I was new to the game still, didn't realise what I had.
---
This dude, soooo much this. Imagine if they did a thing where if it was a legendary Deathclaw, it'd have higher chances of let's say a rifle, but if it's a legendary ghoul, it has a higher chance of dropping a legendary piece of combat armor or something. 
---
I can see this becoming a problem in where people are going to grind only one enemy type, but I think they can find a good balance in a concept like this somewhere.
---
No really? Did you really think OP meant this as a priority?
---
Yeah, but that’s manageable-ish, what really gets me is the audio and visual distortion!!! I got surround speakers and stuff and it really messes me up. That coupled with all the lasers, robots, and the invincible death machine that can turn invisible and gets lost in the chaos instantly.
---
Ah, basically the subreddit. There's a wall of posts asking about the servers. We won't know how long for so it's just a waiting game currently
---
Instigating Lever is my current go-to, but I’m also going to go a bit left-field and suggest you try a primed laser rifle. Standard barrel, all True/Precise mods and a beam splitter. When you’re dealing with enemies that can’t be taken in a single instigating shot the accuracy, ammo capacity and punch if a laser rifle is genuinely quite impressive. Also, they make cool noises and burn your enemies into piles of ash. Bonus.
---
I have a full set of vanguard and a full set of unyielding, which took roughly a little over a month rolling 3 pieces per day.
---
No but seriously stop dropping my mules things I feel bad and I can’t chase you down to give it back. If you seen my inventory you’d understand you should be begging for my b2525 hm’s not giving me scripts.
---
I don't think this was planned. We received no heads up, and apparently it's across multiple games.
---
Who's going to harvest my Razorgrain!?
---
But all my precious junk being used as ammo would hurt
---
Mine is doing the same thing. Does anyone actually know what it mean?
---
i said check the fo76 sub and see if anyone has posted about it..
---
not the bethesda forums..
---
To much special changing, heavy/shottie works smoothly if you want a non heavy the special stats are pretty much the same just some perkswap. And there's the kickass guass shottie
---
Well I wasn't aware! Didn't think you could take and send domestic creatures back to your camp! Whereabouts can you find a cat to tame? Would love one at my camp!
---
It shouldn't be a relevant question as that jetpack looks and is dumb. Same graphic over and over again, a little ctrl+c here, a little ctrl+v there, what else can we slap the one mothman image we paid an artist for on?
---
This isn’t a maintenance thing, they’ve stated multiple times this is a server and login issue.
---
Yeah there are trolls who want to fight or do something shady, but I have teamed up randomly before, especially when we are in the same event. Might be good for some perk bonuses. Sometimes people invite you because they want to trade or something too. Most people are just looking to have fun but you still have to be careful of the griefers. It sucks but there is always someone who wants to ruin your good time.
---
Chryslus Corvega for my garage. Gas pumps.
---
Bloodied Gauss Rifle and OHK scorch beasts and that lvl 95 behemoth.
---
Laser show? At my funeral! Sounds like fun...
---
as soon as people figured the bloodied meta out the balance just went out of the window till they added the damage cap, most bloodied build run something thatll often negate damage like again, serendipity and armor perks to name a few, and then just being instantly vats while you cant hit 30 bullets into them cause of their perks just to be one shot isnt balanced.
---
They never have and never will sadly
---
Nuke grenades are extremely potent, and I’ve heard good things about the new dynamite. But I think Beth looked at how op explosives were in FO4 and decided to scale them back for ‘76, but may have swung the nerf bat a touch too hard on the first attempt.
---
sigh
---
The damage is good but the accuracy and weapon degradation is a huge nope.
---
The one wear people fly around with their arms in the air and shoot bullets out of their face? We call it the Jesus pose. If you think that's bad wait till you see the swimmers.
---
I can’t even find normal vanguard armor I feel like I rarely see it or get it to drop. Good luck !
---
I have 300 hours and I have yet to see PVP. I also have yet to join a group.
---
Bethesda is like the old white man of gaming... They do not want and intend to part with their outdated ways lol.
---
At the rate there going we’re gonna get double xp every weekend.
---
Awesome! So should I incorporate nerd rage, crit perks etc...?
---
i got lucky cost me about 100 modules for my full set of unyielding with decent stats
---
edit:  here's the pieces if anyone cares

---
Yeah I literally saw the same thing yesterday. A lever 30 punching everyone with a powerfist over and over and three extremely high level players with god tier weapons watching like hawks, I lured the low level away and watched them follow along to confirm my suspicion
---
Same us xbox
---
I'm on xbox on mods we have access to is a 28 dollar controller mod. And no their character model is like it is falling but glide across the grounds
---
That is a very good point thank you :)
---
If you're a commando or rifleman build, carrying another weapon for a specific event adds a LOT of weight.
---
Quad crossbow with explosive mod, vats targeted on legs. Things go flying. Definitely the most fun weapon I've used in the game.
---
But you should also mention, this is most likely a bug and could be patched at any time. So in short, enjoy it now, but don't bank on it being around for a long time.
---
Try forest area pet spawns, you'd probably have a smaller pet pool to choose from since it's lower level creatures out there. My friend has had a few dogs and cats. I'm not very lucky with finding them.
---
I could use one on Xbox and willing to pay for it in caps.
---
Facts I hope they make the right choice and let someone else take care of it one day
---
Yeah I usually just buy some ammo. I don't every really need it, but I like buying things from people who have really nice well thought out camps.
---
The nerfing we have all been worried about....
---
I’ve gotten my 4 uny limb pieces...but I yet have to roll a single uny chest piece....I honestly lost track on how much scripts I’ve used...I know it’s ALOT...I try to roll a few every so many days...but not keeping track keeps my sanity. ;) (Then there’s trying to re-roll and get better uny pieces lol....but let’s save that for another time...lol)
---
I got that one...... Looks guuuuud heh ;)
---
Right it gives me anxiety that our  cool methods will be stealth patched
---
Perfectly preserved pies look great in display cases  :)
---
Pretty pissed they didn't give any stats for how many squirrels died during the event.
---
That would be lovely yes. But in my point of view Beth is taking this game out of "trading" purposes.
---
Lots of new content are untradable now and its like a trend for a future direction, sadly.
---
I know a whole bunch of ppl that builds their characters after a trader build, but it seems Beth is taking that away from us.
---
All and all it does sound a wonderfull ideia.
---
ive rolled 60 chest pieces full 30 and then another full 30. my best was chameleon ap fall damage, unyielding ap cav, unyielding 1 special wwr. i used the fall damage one because i use sent not cav and i use jetpack so fall damage works i guess.
---
Big facts
---
Getting runescape grand exchange flashbacks oh god oh f*ck
---
whoops, he forgot to include "/s" for all you delicate flowers out there.
---
Ive seen swimmers already I can also kill them but I watched a dude the other night after he killed everyone on my team with a single mag from a 10mm then run around all match like that. Also ibe notched you dont seem to play with frog legs what is your secret
---
Sounds like something entirely different then which I've never encountered. I play on PC though.
---
I think the white springs was intended to be this place. 
---
I wonder how many locked room doors are inside?
---
&gt;Well that's not true. Destiny has pvp, despite depending on gear.
---
1. The PvP in Destiny is also not that great.
---
2. The gear in Destiny has *far* less impact on PvP than gear in FO76. 
---
Most players who are serious about PvP play dedicated PvP games, not hybrids like Destiny or FO76.
---
Yea and we know there's a bunch of em in pristine condition over at Watoga!
---
It's buggy as hell. Sometimes if you fail it won't give anything.
---
my go to gift for newbies, studded heavy leather armor with deep pockets and shielded vault suit.  sadly i see you're on console.
---
At least you got to finish the event lol.... I just want to play already
---
I'm barely hanging on to my "legacy" display case with the light string in it.
---
So basically you're telling me the game is a complete mess code wise. 😂
---
Appreciated mate, I will run proper testing.
---
There is a log in issue. Bethesda is working on it.
---
Yea I wear a campaign hat and a bandana with the mothman glasses.
---
I like using the beacon grenades to rain fire from the sky during that event!
---
Go watch angry turtle on yt about bloody VS full health build and his PA builds etc
---
But till then shotguns they use same special stat setup as heavy.
---
Armor is 25 for excavator which due to testing you can recraft over at 35 and 45 and use endgame not having to get any others unless you need jetpack.
---
Weps you gonna end up tossing everything heavy that isn't 45 + and DON'T FINISH BECKETT QUESTLINE BEFORE 50 his last reward is a legendary. 50 the last word set level 45 3 star and can be your main end game gun till you farm more.
---
it does help to make tradeos legal
---
Man, sorry to hear about the loss of your pupper. All I can offer as a token of support is this advice on play time, which I complete on a regular basis and know all too well how buggy it is:
---
-when initiating the first stage of the dialogue to start the quest the miss nanny can stop talking to you, making it seem as though the dialogue has stalled. You can just press the confirmation button a couple of times and it’ll fix itself, starting the quest properly.
---
-when handing it in, miss nanny can sometimes load in a bit slow and not be ready to deliver her appropriate dialogue that finished the quest. You need to hang by her for a minute and she’ll right herself.
---
-if she gets stuck in her “Leslie, this instant!” Dialogue loop you can just hop servers and try again. It’s always worked for me.
---
I DONT WANT THEM TO MAKE US PAY FOR THINGS ALREADY IN THE GAME.
---
What platform do you play on? I find 0 cats/(non aggressive) dogs in the wasteland, never have. Do you know whereabouts these spawns may be?
---
This! I have all these game holotapes and want players to be able to use them in my camp. Cabinets were one of my favorite additions to fo4
---
I run a stealth commando queen shredding build, 1 Cham Sent the rest uny Sent And I shoot a BFFR FR Handmade, one shot everything in vats except the queen that I can solo in like 3 min with the right consumables, there’s really not much difference between the fixer and handmade, the fixer is obviously better but not by a lot
---
I was able to wear the hooded rags with it yesterday, so I suppose yest. \^\^
---
I'd like to know how you put junk items on dang shelves.
---
This.  But at least you still have a nice quad explosive even when they finally patch this out.  At least for now it will kick major tail.  This bug has existed for a long time now, maybe they won't patch it soon.  It has not been patched on the PTS yet.
---
The so called pvp is really a shit show of exploits, duped bs and scam tactics. I’m all for having a real PVP survival mode where no legendary nor aimbot and chems, just old fashioned fps free-for-all or team deathmatch. Those few scam players won’t touch it but it will definitely attract many real players who enjoy CS and CoD.
---
Well if anything, cola nut Quantums are one of the big reasons why it's unbalanced. Nobody wants to partake in it because like I said, it's currently broken and shitty.
---
&gt; and destinys gunplay is made around both pve and pvp
---
And their pvp has different rules to regular pve. NW shows the gunplay can work, especially since it works with different rules/item balance.
---
And when he says it won't be around for long. Think about Bethesda's track record on fixing bugs. Should be good for awhile 6+ months before they attempt to fix it and in the process bug something else
---
I've got a TS auto grenade and it's hilarious watching where they go. It's quite handy on that thing though for the extra aoe.
---
easy, my favorite weapon to use is a bloodied handy blade. it wrecks and so hilarious to use. plus its good to put those people hogging a vendor for 15 minutes in check. gees guy buy something or let others buy something.
---
I don't like that I'm paying for fallout first to play privately away from people, and can't even play :/
---
Nah, bugs that are beneficial to the player seem to get squashed much quicker than bugs that hurt the player.
---
Memorex. I'm also old.
---
No, they just think it's funny
---
A rare encounter in 76 added in wastelanders nuke zones. 
---
Sometime in the future there will be repeatble encounter of it. Like the SBQ.
---
Welcome to Fallout, I love you.
---
NP mate.  PM me if you have any questions.
---
Marriage goals
---
Two shot sub machine gun. Loved using it with my Silver Shroud outfit. Ate threw 45's and durability too fast. Also felt like a damn sawd off shotgun with bullets flying everywhere. I got in trouble trying to help some whitespring robots fend off some ghouls.
---
Well while it's down, just so everyone knows there's a new fortnite update today.. yeah yeah I know it's full of kids, I don't care it's fun at least while big daddy 76 is compromised.
---
Who do you think they got to do the killing.
---
Thank you for your understanding then.
---
its so good and not a lot of people seem to know how good it is.
---
I think it's actually possible to come out as level 1 if you don't pick up the cards. I've seen people come out at level 1 before. Not very often, but it happens.
---
My buddy and I are both level 65-ish and tried to fight one. I was tanking it okay but neither of us were doing ANY damage so we escaped.
---
Then shortly later we returned and found it dead and I acquired a 3-star legendary gatling plasma from it with the "increased damage per hit" prefix, so it all worked out.
---
It bugs sometimes it does sometimes it doesn't.
---
Its pretty consistently inconsistent.
---
I realize the need for damage caps. Im not saying they werent needed. But a flat damage cap across the board was a terrible idea. Either way, i done trying to convince this community and Bethesda to blanace pvp anymore. Between all the toxic remarks made towards anyone who openly pvps and Bethesda ignoring every construct suggestion on how to fix it, its been made quite clear were no longer welcome an im sick of it. Picked up Red Dead 2 a few days ago and will be playing it for the forseeable future. If Bethesda ever holds up their end of the deal with allowing us to mod our private servers so we can balance things our way, i MIGHT come back. Highly doubt it though.
---
Why 2XP? Make it 3XP
---
My wife and I have been trying to find one for a while now with no such luck. Knowing our luck though, when we do find one, she'll stumble across it first and fucking murder it in to 3 seconds flat. Her character is way stronger than any of mine 😂
---
Wondering the same thing. Can you flame vendors? Seems expensive to repair otherwise.
---
Gold + max foundation rep needed
---
I was straight up told by some moron that during the maintenance to fix the latest Vending Machine problems, it wasn't due to that.
---
I shared with him Bethesda's official post about how it directly affected it.
---
He never replied.
---
I would love to see a dang shelf I could put books, not magazines, and junk on.
---
As someone who has at most had 5k caps at once, this sounds like a dream come true xD might be able to afford a great weapon at that point :p
---
Maybe it could increase movement speed and attack rate?
---
Maybe I'm missing somethingm, but there isnt any AP chem. Adding jet would open multiple chems, making more junkie build options available. 
---
The drug is a powerful hallucigenic-meta-amphetamine that stimulates the central nervous system, triggering a rush of energy and strength primarily brought about by endorphins.
---
With that description, you could make it so Jet has a visual distortion effect, similar to Nukashine. They could make it work like a stimpak but for AP, a general burst followed by a slower regen for a short amount of time.
---
Then:
---
 Psycho-Jet (Psycho + Jet) - Same visual distortion, red tint. Provides a small burst of AP followed by high AP regen. Increases damage dealt by 20% &amp; lowers damage taken by 10%
---
 Jet-Buff (Buffout +Jet)- Same visual distortion, blue tint. Provides a large burst of AP followed by moderate AP regen. Increase damage dealt by 20%, increase max HP by 55 Increase Endurance &amp; Strength by 2
---
 Jet-tats (Mentats + Jet) - Same visual Distortion, green tint. Provides a moderate burst of AP followed by high AP regen. Lower Weapon Condition Cost &amp; AP consumption. Increase Intelligence &amp; Perception by 2. 
---
**For fun:** 
---
Jet-Cell (X-cell + Jet) Same visual distortion, multicolored tint. Provides a small burst of AP followed by a short AP regen. Increase all S.P.E.C.I.A.L stats by 3.
---
Sunshine-Jet (Sunshine Oil + Jet) No visual distortion, no addiction. Provides a large burst of AP followed by a High AP regen.
---
Rad-A-Jet (Rad-Away + Jet) No visual distortion, high addiction chance. Removes rads at a constant rate while under the effects, increase AP regen. 
---
Rad-Jet (Rad-X + Jet) No visual Distortion, high addiction chance. Increases rad resistance, increase max AP by 45. 
---
I've always wondered why they scrapped it rather than try to make it work. I see endless possibilities.
---
Well it'd be a bonus if they were free but we get free atoms sooooooo still free either way really?
---
Atlantic City...you ever see the commercial for "A place for mom?"  There's one called A place for dad. It's a  park bench on the boardwalk.
---
Just you. Must be banned.
---
Suggestion for you, I just did this with my camp. Tie all your vendors to a switch with a keypad so you can shut them off whenever you're getting close or just want to stop selling for a bit. (When they lose power your camp loses that vendor status)
---
Lol, it's cool. I'm not fully noob anymore, two weeks in, so I've gotten a bit past beginner area. But thank you for being so kind!
---
Yes but beware of clipping.
---
I probably say "fucking Bugthesda" to my team mates at least once a session. But I believe they really do care. I think the problem is that they're working with a 23 year old engine that has had multiplayer slapped on top and left the development to a new studio that put out one unsuccessful multiplayer game. It's a bunch of spaghetti code at this point.
---
I managed to roll a Powered Unyielding Sentinel SS chest awhile back and I have yet to roll anything good on limbs since then.. the grinds kinda bogging me down, now.
---
TIL!  This whole time I thought it had to be a scorched mirelurk spawn!
---
you are talking about the tadpole backpack, the possum  has mods  for the backpacks only
---
&gt; The gear in Destiny has far less impact on PvP than gear in FO76.
---
It still has an impact. Thing is, Destiny has different rules and systems in play to keep 1k hr players from squashing casual players.
---
&gt; Most players who are serious about PvP play dedicated PvP games, 
---
I mean, this game was advertised with pvp, had pvp planned when it was in development, and BGS keep trying to market towards a pvp crowd. The crowd is here.
---
Nope. According to Beth’s server status, many services are down.
---
The event boost is nice, I guess? They dropped the ball on the Legendary one though. It should have been:
---
-While in a team with this bonus active, all Legendary enemies killed by team members will drop Legendary items of 2* quality or higher, regardless of the * rating of that Legendary enemy. BONDED: all Legendary enemies drop 3* quality items.
---
Yea, me and a buddy got disconnected about 2 1/2 hours ago.
---
This sub is out of their minds.
---
if people like you were banned from all games we would all have a better playing experience and surprisingly companies would still make money.
---
Almost as if games generate near to infinite revenue. Stop this Bethesda apologism and corporate bootlicking. Not even the devs of this game probably agree with being forced to monetize their game in this bullshit way.
---
They announced on twitter a massive banning tonight
---
Now Bethesda.net won't even load.
---
*Someone* is going to get a visit from the FBI.
---
but destinys item effects are still not as over-the-top as fallouts. imagine bringing an instagating sniper into the crucible. just bodyshot everyone without even trying.
---
could you imagine bloodied? oh youre 1 shot.. and now you can crossmap everyone with a single body shot of your hand cannon!
---
fallouts perks are more over the top because it still is a PVE game.
---
even certain legendary effects are less strong in pvp in destiny.
---
Agreed. Have fun but not too much fun. Server crash, blue screen
---
yes i was I even stoped at my camp to try to understand why that was happening and was with no radiation full food/water and yet that strange bug
---
Use what? A rifle?
---
how many people danced on top of the balloons for immersion?
---
How many caps you want for this soy gun?5k
---
i was thinking of trying a beserkers build with chinese stealth armor but craft a low level one so you have low resistance and get the stealth benefits. combo that with a sweet berserkers fixer and wooooo boi  might be beastly.
---
Yes. :)
---
In terms of damage, the difference between the two is minimal.  I think the base damage is like 48 for the Fixer versus 45 for the Handmade.  
---
IMO, the choice between them comes down to recoil.  The Handmade is superior in that regard, which makes manual aiming much more accurate.  The Fixer you either have to rely on VATS or fire in short bursts.
---
Bloodied swingsspeed sheepsquatch staff
---
It does such a stupid amount of damage it should be illegal lmao.
---
Yes. For 4 hours now on PS4
---
maybe they’ll fix Smiley’s gold glitch :/ been wanting to buy since last fucking week
---
Wouldn’t be a problem if offline mode existed
---
Nobody cares about PvP because anybody who isn't interested in playing Sims: The apocalypse and farming atoms to buy items which are held back for no reason but greed isn't actively playing this game. Because this game has no other features aside from empty progression to increase your interaction with the game and the atom store.
---
Nah I am not a gasbag... the older you get, and you will get old one day, the slower your reaction time will get with your eye-hand coordination. Sometimes I have that issue with the controller, and that my friend is why I have 3 kids... “Hey! You get me through this part of the game, or you get me that power armor, and I’ll give you an extra 10 bucks and promise not to make you wash the car”... incentives to help their old man.
---
🤷🤗😂😉
---
I really enjoy the boxing glove.  I've got a bloodied swing-speed glove that takes down baddies like a champ.
---
I named it "Hardcore Fisting"
---
Fantastic, thank you! :)
---
Yea some pre-filled shelves would be nice, I'd love them to make a single display stand that's the size of  an ashtray. Place it where you like and then you can display any item you want wherever you want!
---
Monster Mash will scale very well with Builder.
---
It's weird that they added blackberries and nothing else.
---
No pet spawn has a guaranteed specific pet. There's a mappalachia post for pet spawns. And I play on ps4
---
that sounds like good fun.
---
Here’s an update on where it’s at; quite literally everything is down besides stores. Allowing players to still buy dlcs and games but not actually play them, I understand it, but also most large titles are having issues. I have nothing bad to say about Bethesda other than the constant bugs and duping in fallout ruining the economy, but I just thinks it’s kinda funny. And for those who haven’t checked yet, yes, they are having issues with Doom.
---
This. A good trap camp for me isnt a "huh huh you ded", but something that is interesting. The best ones either have a strong RP element (the guy who built a "church" in flatwoods, dressed as a pastor, and convinced people to come into his flamethrower filled hell-church), or are fun/clever. Seen some nice mazes, and obstacle courses.
---
The ones where they just stack punji boards on you are lame
---
I have an IE the dragon from way back when
---
Shotguns do extra damage in vats for some reason
---
This is exactly what I came here to say.
---
I can imagine they'll try to fix the outage first.
---
It's a fact this isn't a PvP focused game...
---
EDIT: Well guy below, I'm not even going to directly respond to you, I'm done, can't help idiots.
---
Well than... Looks like I need to go collecting some stuffs. LOL thanks for the pro tip. Definitely guna come in handy, guess I'll be using ordnance express while shopping from now on. hahaha
---
Was waiting for the fatman squad! 
---
Got myself a quad strapped with a MIRV many suicides with the monster
---
They were interested, but in fact they were surprised at how many people actually wanted to co-operate and be friendly. This is the nicest gaming community in existence.
---
I think they should bring back Survival Mode and just have it be an exact copy of Adventure Mode but without PvP restrictions. Seems like a really simple solution to me.
---
It could be and probably will be patched at some point at least I hope. 
---
I thought the same thing about the lmg I've had since the beginning of the year that can kill the queen in a mag or 2.  Might take a while to get fixed, just don't learn to depend upon it.
---
I've been rolling for a weapon weight reduction full set. I'm probably around 3000 scrip and have the chest and arms, finally. 
---
Missing the deep-pocketed mod, though.
---
"intermittent" ha. ha.  hahahah. 
---
nice try.
---
games been down for 3 hours. 
---
turn off whatever terrible MFA implementation you guys did, so we can play.
---
Same here xb1 Australia
---
Instegating Level Action Rifle Lvl 45 or higher.
---
If i recall, the reason why a GECK is only used for water purification in Fallout 3 is because GECKs are too small and convert too little matter at a time to sensibly affect the Capital Wasteland's extra-horrible conditions, so the Project Purity team decided to use it for water purification for a much more wide-scale and gradual land reformation process that would happen passively instead of matter-recreate one box of dirt at a time.
---
Really dumb that Fallout 4 shits all over that (the water purifiers should have simply extracted partially purified water for less rads than dirty water, but not fully clean either).
---
I noticed how good the community was too. Met a random guy on the forums and he helped me build a home and gave me a ton of supplies. Love exists in the wasteland
---
If mods ever come to 76 the first one should absolutely be balloon noise + confetti explosion when you kill a floater.
---
there's something incredible about the \*thunk\* that the fixer makes when you land a shot. And I love using black powder weapons.
---
Because the outage indicators show more being down now than what was down when I tried to log in hours ago.
---
Yeah man, never asked that haha, just asked where the spawn areas would be? Link to post if you could be so kind?
---
Some people said the trailers were delayed
---
I got dropped from the IGN listing last minute. https://twitter.com/CaptainShishou/status/1273705357311868928
---
Dude I ended up giving away so much Tasty Squirrel Stew (my always and forever food) because I could not stop murdering those squirrels.
---
Junkies and Instigating shotguns are bugged.  They do insane damage in VATS.  Watch angry turtle's video on YT titled "Are Shotguns Secretly OP?"  There is a piece of armor you can wear that causes this effect even outside VATS.
---
I think one of the main computers that drives the game must be out of operation.
---
Good bot!
---
Do you somehow have a blocking percentage stat on your armor?
---
Implement different rules then.
---
&gt; even certain legendary effects are less strong in pvp in destiny.
---
Then why not weaken legendary effects while in pvp?? Why not even turn off legendary effects in pvp engagements? 
---
Why not re-introduce survival mode, but don't half-ass it? Make it like you have to start a brand new character every "survival season" and you're encourage to hunt/be ruthless to people. Give big awards to adventure mode. Only make a select group of legendaries available on Survival. Remove the stupid 100 dmg limit on guns in Survival.
---
&gt; could you imagine bloodied? oh youre 1 shot.
---
It's already like that on live lol. Instead of hand cannons it's bloodied explosive gatling plasma. Again, the current pvp is broken and shitty.
---
Ok cool. Think I will stop trying for a BFFR fixer and try for a BFFR handmade.
---
This. Has a pseudo-Boushh look.
---
Yep. The non-bloodied non-drug using players wouldn’t mind being able to kill her in a reasonably sized group. That would be cool.
---
If they implement this they will forget to implement an option on making your own camp visible on the map.
---
Lol that will be a thing for a long time
---
I like your pacifist idea, but I also have to say everything eventually breaks in this game, intentionally or not.
---
The gift of a good advise for surviving the harsh Appalachian wild lands.
---
I think some players don't want freebies, cause it can mess with the play experience (mostly challenge). A game like this can feel more appealing if trade and supporting one another is more central than just being given handouts by kind folks.
---
Wow that's so cool I'd love that as a background or wallpaper even better they should let you hang your photos in your camp ✌️
---
Marriage goals!
---
Cant confirm now but sure, I have all 2&amp;3* armours
---
Yea it's amazing. As a full unyielding Bloodied melee build with not even full 2h melee Perks only at 30%dmg bonus I get a tick of 160 dmg. The lvl 95 glowing Behemoth near by my camp is cut into pieces in less then 5 sec haha
---
Why not? You're shooting it not dropping it
---
Dang
---
M'vaulter
---
\*tips\*
---
Do we know when that will be?
---
And prosper
---
A lot of PS4 users have it set up where you can’t send them a message if you’re not friends.
---
&gt;I mean, this game was advertised with pvp, had pvp planned when it was in development
---
Which was a mistake, pure and simple. Just one more on a very long list. You'd be hard-pressed to find *any* instance of any existing Fallout fans asking for PvP in Fallout prior to the announcement of 76. Lots of people wanted simple co-op though.
---
&gt;The crowd is here.
---
No it isn't. The percentage of players who ever cared about participating PvP in FO76 has always been an *extreme* minority and have always been vastly outnumbered by players who wish PvP never existed in the game.
---
Workshops would be a much more active and used if players didnt have to fight over them. If instead there was a system that allowed co-ownership of the workshop, you'd see probably all of them being actively used. 
---
We are supposed to be rebuilding America, and that wont happen if we are too busy killing each other
---
Nothing to see here, at least for me. Fix camp budgets, vastly improve on in game trading and economy. End game seems to be for many people making new and interesting camps and trading to get better/different weapons. Beth ignores the pleas from both of these.
---
It is almost like they don't play the game, or understand the game they made.
---
I had so much spoiled meat it took a good 10-15min to turn it all into fertiliser.
---
I was killing the critters left right and centre, even when I was waiting for the super mutants to show up  just so I had something to shoot lol
---
yup im there with ya.
---
Thanks for this really useful info! Gonna take a look now
---
Yeah for some unknown reason if you have that piece and use vats on a shotgun it makes it stronger. You can use that on a flechette harpoon gun too.
---
My husband and I have our two consoles and tvs in the same room so we can share the couch. Pretty sweet
---
Haha, ok, fair point. Fun &gt; optimisation.
---
I spent about 400 modules just to get a full set of 2-3\* Unyielding.  Only one piece is sentinels. A couple have AP refresh.  One poison resist.
---
BUT.. I rolled a Bloodied/+33 Vats/250dr and a BFFR Gauss Shotty in the first 10 rolls.
---
I had a bloodied ripper back when over repairing those weapons made the damage shoot up. It was immense fun running around Whitespring with it.
---
The rep dailies are quests not challenges
---
Vital Equipment from Ward in Foundation
---
And either
---
The Importance of Communication from Wren in Crater
---
Or
---
Retirement Plan from Rocksy in Crater
---
Also if you go to the overseer's house the robot Davenport will give you a daily called Photo Opportunity
---
Take the pictures and give them to the opposite faction to gain rep with that faction
---
And you can take mirelurk meat to the Ohio River Adventure location and turn it in to a person named Blackeye to raise raider rep
---
better be compensation if i can't hand in treasury notes, the time gate is bad enough as it is.
---
Yes. But they get added to a bugs list, and fixed eventually. There isnt a single bug related to PvP on the list of known bugs, not even god mode. Which basically shows that Bethesda doesnt give a shit and never intends on fixing them. At this point, all the bugs pvp related might as well be called features.
---
YES!
---
Would of bet 30k caps that it would of been Beret that was most dropped.
---
Honestly at this point Bethesda would be better making dedicated PvP game modes like team deathmatch and capture the flag, just you can't use your own weapons you can create loadouts instead
---
posted the same suggestion a few days ago. post got removed almost instantly by mods with no reason given and no response on PMs. careful.. they are triggerhappy
---
:( Just got home. Same problem. Glad its this. I was worried it was my account.
---
Had fun with the Dragon collection during Fasnacht.  Made those little red decorative balls sail like a centering pass into the robots.
---
Isn't that change only for public groups? Or are they applying it to private groups as well?
---
A two shot grenade launcher.. there's sometimes a comically long pause between the shots and for some unknown reason, really works for me in vats.
---
I made use of Good With Salt for the first time just so I can prolong the tastiness of my tasty stew.
---
They mean Daily Quests in game- you interact with certain people at either location and they give you tasks.
---
Hi capacity mod for the backpack is great for hoarders...no, it‘s bad for hoarders....
---
but either way, it’s great for extra carry capacity, especially combined with deep pocketed armor and WR perks.
---
But its bad when you get into PA....
---
Do these outages happen often?
---
I don't stop to receive harpoons, what a nightmare, I will check well when servers up
---
How did you get SLudge Lung to stick? I swear Ive contracted that multiple times, I think I even took a screenshot saying it but it stays unchecked
---
Not sure if it’s a good or bad thing, but I just tried again and got a new/different error code:
---
$LoginError_GameCodeFailure
---
[3:0:9]
---
I like a central market for the ease of shopping and to even out pricing.  I like people coming to my camp to see my hard work and creativity.  It’s a mixed bag.
---
If you want that, you can each perform a dualing slap before your fight begins! This change protects people from being unwittingly dragged into pvp where they can't fight back because pacafist doesn't auto toggle off on PVP!
---
Two Shot Exploding Minigun (plus the Bloody Mess perk).
---
Stepping into the Whitesprings Golfclub and just holding down the trigger, streaming explosions into the entryway until I'm surrounded by meat chunks is the most cathartic thing I have ever done in my life.
---
Not likely, as you’re probably looking at daily challenges. There’s a daily quest section in your Pip-Boy, however you’ll need to visit the in game locations to talk to the NPCs to actually pick up the quests.
---
there was a method for settlers, unfortunately it got patched with update 19.
---
That's actually a very cool idea also it would help low level players cause I tend to put stuff that would benefit them and not me for cheap or if I pass a low level I'll give them something to help ✌️
---
Tadpole challenges get you the backpack which is +60 carry weight. possum challenges get you the mods for the backpack. The added weight mod is another +60 carry weight giving you a total of +120 carry weight! With my backpack and perk cards I have 420 carry weight. The backpack and backpack mod is definetly worth the grind and all the info for every challenge and answers to all exam questions can be found on the internet and in these forums just by searching.
---
That sounds like a bug like when it doesn’t register you’ve discovered a location.
---
Is there any game that has a more wholesome community?
---
My server had some awesome guides/GMs.  On my server in EQ, infamous item ebayer named Oaklandbash had to change his name.  He then got salty and tried to have the guides/GMs change my name (As a side note, I never reported him, I think he just thought my name violated TOS also).  But they disagreed and my name stuck lol.  I did change my last name at one point, though.   Naive me asked co-workers for a good last name and one guy suggested "Jungfrau".  I thought that sounded cool and went with it, then German players started whispering me thinking my last name was hilarious.  I didn't understand until one told me it meant "little girl/young girl" in German.  I got the GMs to change it for me after lol.
---
It took me 160 modules just to get a UNY left leg more than 1 star.
---
I really hope they introduce them with a new daily, at Tyler's fairgrounds or in a Arcade room in the frathouse area of Morgantown, that requires us to play a match of the game, and then gave us a community wide scoreboard.
---
The plans to build a basic Arcade at our CAMP would be a drop from the event, and then they can sell skins for the various games on the atom shop, instead of making the whole thing AS exclusive.
---
After all, to code those games it must have taken a lot of effort, and it's sad that most people never really played them because they aren't given the right  opportunity to shine. Just like they are risking doing with gold perk cards if the system goes live the way it is now.
---
Wasting potential is a recurring theme with this game, really.
---
Got it.  Thanks.
---
They still make you loose your flux by killing you with radiation weapons!
---
Can I cross this name off my list or what.....
---
I have a 2-shot handmade and an instigating handmade and I always do better with the instigating. The reason being distance.  If you are right in front of them the 2 shot may be better but anything past a few car lengths and the pattern of the 2 shot really spreads out.  So one may miss completely or just hit them in the arm/leg.
---
Instigating to the head at even 200 feet and it usually drops the mob in one shot.
---
I love this!
---
Now if that ain’t couple goals I don’t know what is😂
---
Can you get max rep with both factions?
---
Lmfao😂😂
---
Figures. What's the likelihood this is related to the War on Bethesda.
---
this post is essentially useless because people have been telling them to do this for years across many different games (and anything that could go down, like netflix or facebook) and it never works, the people you are addressing do not pay attention to these types of posts.
---
I actually really really enjoyed those legendary weapons on the PvP servers.  It was something to look forward to each week, and I just stowed my junk and hopped over.  There was a lot of tension and it added an element of fear that was cool.  Nothing could really happen except you lose a few caps or something, but the legendary weapons you got for it were awesome and guaranteed.  Funniest was when you would run into someone who had a load out that was obviously not meant for PvP, which is how I was often running around and there was a second non-verbally where you are thumbs upping and hearting, and basically saying, “please don’t kill me I am just trying to get the weapon this week.”  But, I always found it enjoyable to have a one on one confrontation with all the perks and load outs in this game.  It was a change, and it was unique, and it was a server specifically for people who enjoy PVP, which I respected.  It’s a multiplayer fallout, so I think it’s creative and neat to bring PvP to fallout with the option to be pacific.  I am mainly a solo PVE player but the more options the better.  Sometimes a game mode that is no good can give birth to a new genre or game mode that supersedes expectations.
---
You have to go to crater to trigger the raider daily for their reputation, then you have to go to the foundation to trigger the settler reputation daily quest. There’s 1 daily quest each and they trigger at 8pm est
---
This is disgraceful!  You should be ashamed.  I don't even know how you do that.  How do you do that?  Asking for a friend.
---
Ya ya rub it in :)
---
That sounds my like my sort of gun. Instigating it is!
---
Id heard it was bugged because lots of people cant get it to count either. I was just wondering how you managed to get it to count. I need to work my way through the last few I need but Im fairly certain that one will be getting added to the list of atoms Im owed when I send in a ticket for bugged challenges (its why i took a screenshot to prove I contracted it)
---
The MommySalami rolled out of bed,

and ran to the Whitespring station

When Todd found out he began to shout

and started an investigation

It's against the rules

Todd was such a tool
---
I got tons of free items early on just like you. This game really does have a lot of awesome players. I like to drop an assortment of cosmetics for new players and always enjoy seeing which ones they end up wearing. I don't mean all the super common stuff either. I was lucky enough to find plans for the Treasure Hunter and Insurgent outfit/hats super cheap so I give away a set of each along with some other less common cosmetics I find while playing.
---
You want fireproof to protect yourself from your explosive damage, not adamantun skeleton.
---
I've got a quad explosive double barrel too. Seems like I do the best with it modded for max range and accuracy, then always use vats. As long as you've got 95% in vats all your shots will hit for max damage. You have to be in near melee range to make it work.
---
Yes i learned yestersay you can at the same time
---
Nuka Quantum is inherently broken for some reason. The normal Nuka Grenade does wonders though.
---
But yeah, explosives in general have been gimped since they tried nerfing the two shot explosive weapons back in the day. The regular explosive weapons were kinda collateral damaged with that nerf.
---
This happened to me with warcraft. I had a name that was made up and had nothing to do with anything but they said it was a name of a location used in the game. I had the name for over 8 years and playing that long a ton of people know you. They suspended my account and told me to change it. I told them to delete my account and that was the last time blizzard will ever get a dime from me. Scumbag move to do that to people.
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
I've seen that. They skate around at higher than normal speed with their gun straight in the air. This is a controller mod?
---
Edit: I am on xbox
---
Considering no game I've ever played has given bonuses like this just for grouping up, it's an odd thing to be critical of. xD
---
I mean I can understand not being thrilled by them, but I don't think that's the point. I don't think getting more power is really the point either. It's just about flavour and for some people getting more stats will be worthwhile just for its own sake, even if they can't suddenly leap from tall buildings.
---
I’ve got full sets on both my characters. One unyielding sentinel and the other guy is a mix of Van/Weightless sentinel.
---
Yes servers are down
---
Or just have high rad fluids have a chance to drop in multiples off enemies, like glowing masses and hardened masses do.
---
Apologies. It's +25% then divided over both projectiles so 62.5% damage per projectile.

&gt;With Patch 5, the damage bonus for Two Shot Legendary modded weapons has been reduced from +100% to +25% damage
---
Well, basically any furniture or object could be sold.  
---
But, I'm waiting for the metal chess figures.  Would be cool to set up a chess board, camp scavenger hunt, battle plan/maneuver table, etc.
---
Or 
---
A black coffee pot. How do we have the little woodstove without a coffeepot on it? Seriously!
---
They are actually some bums
---
Across the board I believe.
---
No it isn't I was just saying that was the only cheats I knew of on console
---
As a shotgunner as well I use the VATS with instigating combat shotgun and can one or 2 shot 95% of enemies (have all the shotgunner perks), but I keep getting told by higher level players to "get this one or this one they are better!" I have been given 2 shot explosive legacy weapons that just don't hold a candle to my instigating. My point is go with what works for you. I take a grounded legendary scorched beast in 2-3 shots and take no collateral damage with a shotgun I was told is only worth scrip,  that works for me.
---
I had that for two weeks. It's made the grind for end game gear just that much slower.
---
Ooh sorry got confused. Now I get what you mean, yes. 
---
No need to apologies friend ;)
---
If only I had text chat to talk to the community, and challenging endgame content to overcome with them!
---
Servers are currently down if you're trying to log in as of recent
---
Also getting server error:  [3:0:844424930263042]
---
Probably that low lvl that attacked me and when I attacked back his high level friend snuck up an one shot me.
---
Dude these high levels giving crap to low levels. I give them legendary for scrip or caps. Things that will actually boost them. Some level 370 boost me and my friend and i will always be grateful about it.
---
As far as I know you can still breath underwater in PA.  A quick search seems to indicate that some of the Atom shop PA skins were glitched causing the underwater breathing not to kick in.  Perhaps you have one of the glitched PA skins applied.
---
The little tricks aren't listed anywhere in game. Some of them aren't even quests. 
---
These are what I can think of from the top of my head:
---
When taking pictures for Davenport, you can turn in the pictures to the opposite faction for rep. There will be a marker displayed for that.
---
When tracking down the rogue raider for Rocky you can convince the hunter to go to Foundation for Foundation Rep
---
When tracking the stolen property for Ward you can let the raider keep it for Crater rep.
---
Go to Ohio River Adventures. Talk to the raiders there. You can donate mierlurk meat once a day for a Crater rep boost.
---
Many new random encounters now have dialogue options that will boost rep. Always keep your eye open for people wandering around.
---
I actually dont want text chat. I thought I did, but then I remembered all the racist/sexist comments of usually teenagers trying to be edgy.
---
Oooh yea that chess set would look good. Even better if it had npc interaction with it
---
I don't really have a "Trap" camp, but if you drink the Vintage Nukashine out of the punch bowl, it is what it is. I also have my vending low priced, the robots get you badly enough with caps, and some things can be hard to find.
---
If we're going off the state of launch, apparently not a lot of people wanted online Fallout period. 
---
&gt; ...have always been vastly outnumbered by players who wish PvP never existed in the game.
---
See, I have a problem with this mindset. What's so bad about having a gamemode separate from the main mode focused on pvp? By not having that, you are still denying a large portion of people who want to have fun shooting strangers in a game.
---
Unfortunately this was my heavy gunner time... But a bloodied ripper is still a thing Im looking for.would be a nice weapon for lower lvl events and not to kill legendary enemies immediately.
---
Well, allow me to pick up your mic that you dropped. 
---
It was my sincere pleasure to take a moment while I was cooking dinner to reply. 
---
I addressed our mutual love of that website’s usefulness. And I also roll my eyes every time I see one of the following types questions:
---
- where do I find lead in this game?
---
- what type of armor is the the secret service?
---
I actually did click on your lmgtfy link, and noticed that none of the first three hits were very useful (unless you want to purchase real t-notes from Steve Mnuchin) and another was just an explainer article for how the system works generally. 
---
But who knows?
---
Someone got me with that last week.
---
The first ones were clever, and done for a bit of fun. Unsuspecting players would wander into a "shop" and find themselves trapped, and killed by a hidden  flamethrower.
---
The owner of the camp would then GUARD the junk bag until the victim came to reclaim it, and then usually throw them some free stuff as a no hard feelings reward for pranking them. Bonus points if the camp was heavily themed, or if the trap was very cleverly hidden.
---
Most of the ones now are lack-lustre shitty ones because "iM gOiNg tO bUiLd oNe tOo" except they have none of the style or design work of the originals, or are just "haha I killed you" and steal your junk
---
This.  I am not a dedicated rifleman build.. only have one of each rifleman card and still hit for 4k once.
---
Servers are down and they canceled their ing roadmap release today
---
Because it is still considered patience when you don’t go off the rails about it and are understanding about it. As a cashier if some one had to wait for some reason I also thank people for their patience rather than apologize because I find I get less people being pissy if I do that. If I apologize it’s like it is a license to go off on me.
---
No, you must continuously try to log in. Sleep is for the weak
---
Same but it's going back and forth
---
I see. I have seen the same two high level players doing this repeatedly. At first I thought it was just a funky glitch,  but the fact it seems to only happen to a couple players repeatedly has me wondering
---
I mostly always do that: buy something (cheap) just because I like the Camp.
---
But it'd great from the vendor side to know that someone liked the Camp.
---
3, 2, 1, Deleted post
---
That explains it. Was with the red rocket skin.
---
Yea I just double-checked and you're right. It doesn't seem like a problem to me, it seems to just mean you can't flag people in your group if you decide to PVP. But I don't PVP in this game so... *shrug*
---
Let me add, not because they are bad at it but because I personally hate live service games for this reason.
---
If you're in need of acid, wander over to the flooded trainyard. All the snallygasters are good for 5-ish acids each as well.
---
Thanks, I'll have a look.
---
I am, and instead got an unyielding set
---
Done Encryptid yet?
---
Wait. What?
---
The vault is the end of the wastelanders story questline. The Burrows can be done any time, it's a dungeon located in Harper's Ferry. There are two entrances, they're manhole covers that lead down into the sewer. Unfortunately it's not really an end-game dungeon the way it was supposed to be. Before it was added to the game, Bethesda hyped it up and said it'd be a harrowing dungeon for a team of high level characters. What it ended up being was a sewer full of ghouls, comparable to the Whitesprings golf club but with a much cooler atmosphere. The first time you do it, it's a very basic "quest" that rewards you with a non-legendary unique named assaultron blade with a mild vampire effect. It's a fairly unimpressive weapon but I guess it's something to collect if you want it as a souvenir. You can repeat the burrows as many times as you want after, but there won't be quest objectives after the first time and you won't get the blade again. Another dungeon for end-game grinding is West Tek, it's packed full of super mutants and generally you can get a legendary weapon or two in a run through it.
---
Most ppl like the fixer because of the extra buff it gives to stealth which helps for stealth commando builds
---
I had this happen to me and since then I refuse any team invites from people I don't know.
---
Very life goals
---
I was just able to load the PTS forums which were previously down as well, so it looks like they're making some progress.
---
Edit: I was able to load the various threads and shift around the pages, although still no log-in.
---
I love that they keep releasing these bundles for factions that aren’t even prevelant
---
smh
---
I dunno. With text Bethesda can easily know who left it and suspend them. There's voice chat and thats a lot harder for bethesda to review what is said unless someone records it. They could ban certain words. Gotta be a way to do it.
---
As far as I am aware, there is little endgame content. Just Scorchbeast Queens and Wendigo Colossi. 
---
I'm new though, and that's all I've seen or heard.
---
Not all bugs effect all players
---
We call our ding dongs salami in spain. So i figured it could be it. But also there is a ton of errors in translation in bethesda games so who knows...
---
Eh, I'm not concerned about that. It could already happen on mic and would be much worse in that context. I've played plenty of MMOs and the number of players who post garbage like that are generally low, and can be screened with language filters, blockers, and and reporting. Plenty of ways to deal with asshats. 
---
I just don't think the right play from Bethesda is to penalize good people because of a niche of bad people. Not to mention, an online multiplayer game without text chat in 2020 is shockingly absurd and makes Bethesda look like amateurs. For that reason alone they need to add it in. xD
---
if you're done with both the "normal" and wastelanders questlines, there's really no other endgame except for the grind for reputation/gold and the scorchbeast queen. imo its the biggest problem with the game atm. lack of endgame content.  
---
vault 79 is the last part of the wastelanders questline, where you side with either the raiders or the settlers
---
burrows is the "underground" in harpers ferry. they are marked on the map and you basicly "enter" the sewers and go kill ghouls down there.
---
They were supposed to be at the ign summer games reveal stream thing. They bailed litteraly a few hours before their time slot
---
I have the Pale Horse PA skin from a while ago and I've never had a problem with it.
---
Few things for me in favor of the fixer are .45 ammo weighs nothing when using bandolier, slightly better damage, weighs less and the sneak bonus is nice.
---
Nope, not this one
---
Chily, aren't you on xbox?  At least I've seen someone with that name in NW lobbies. There are flying players on xbox too?
---
I know that and I always forget for some reason, probably because the derp is strong with this one. Last time I looked I had over 3k acid so it's not really an issue, not really sure why I still get a grin on my face when I see Cave Crickets near Watoga and actively go after them.
---
Yeah it has been more than a few days for me and I still can't bring myself to log in again.  I used to live and breathe this game,  used to really enjoy it.  But it has been death by a thousand cuts, little things here and there that haven't been addressed that have added up over time. . After more than a year it is much harder to look past them.
---
I have had the hardest time getting Unyielding armor in general but of all things I got an Unyielding Sentinel arm from finishing fasnacht one time
---
More likely, they forgot to pay AWS.
---
I can actually log onto a server, it doesn’t recognize my account, but it’s a black screen with hud, sound plays for the actions I can preform, I can open Pip-Boy, but I can open map. I can scroll around the map, and put it away you hear the map closing sound, can’t move, or fire a weapon, when the maps open I doesn’t show my atomic points, or caps, you can also experience it via spamming the failure code and it’ll instantly change screens to this without loading (kinda)
---
Or when some fucker fifty levels higher than me keeps shooting me to piss me off. I kill him, then he gets his lvl 180 friend with explosive rifles and destroy my camp.
---
Yep! At least nobody ever reported his Surname, Angrydragon
---
Well they haven't fixed it on armor yet either so that figures. Would like to see more x amount less damage received from y . Etc type buffs
---
Been using this with the insurgent outfit for the longest time. Looks hella tacticool.
---
Stays says Bethesda.net production services are experiencing degradation WTF does that mean?
---
I just popped in my Falllout 4 disc
---
&gt; Building is going to be the one everyone uses. Extra XP in all scenarios.
---
I guess so, and what's funny: no-one will use it to actually **build** something **as a team**, because: "While in a Public Team, you and your teammates will not be able to build in each other’s C.A.M.P.s."
---
Did the "war on Bethesda" people win?!?!?! They actually killed the game!?!?!? Lmafo
---
Ya I'm on Xbox. No hackers here but still an occasional bug abuser.
---
Yup. I didn't play much Survival when it came out, but I did play quite a few hours of Nuclear Winter. It's not really a thing my team mates like, so I tend not to play a lot. 
---
I think Bethesda has put all of their hopes on the NW mode, and it's a good mode (save for the hackers) but I think being able to play the base Adventure mode with no PvP restrictions at this point would be welcomed by a part of the community. There's really no need for complications. Just Adventure sans PvP restrictions and boom, Survival Mode.
---
So you're just making it up then, ok. At least we know.
---
Too reinforce this, at this point in the fallout time line the Enclave and Brotherhood of Steel haven't had an direct contact or skirmishes, both groups are still doing their own things. 
---
This means with future content release we could see Appalachia become the first contact/fight between the two, given the Enclave does come back of course.
---
I've still got time left on my sub, Bethesda has until October to wow me or I'm going back to Fallout 4 and Skyrim.
---
I was surrounded by a swarm at the place near what is now Foundation and, after using a couple stimpaks to stop myself from being nibbled to death, realized I could use VATS to kill the healthy ones and just leave the one diseased one alive.  Alive until I finally got Whoopsie, that is! lol
---
yeah, that would actualy make pvp fun, but the way they implimented it (and how it still is on adventure) is just horrible.
---
as this point i dont think beth will actualy do anything with survival or pvp because the team working on FO seems to have zero idea of PVP balancing outside of the base guns for NW. and even then theres big differences in effectiveness.
---
Over/Under at 10 minutes?
---
OMG! I feel your pain!!!
---
It more about adding a random. That random is actually a friend of a different person. They "fight" and the other guy kills the hapless person adding the random hoping to make friends.
---
I'm on ps4 looking for a fixer plan if the servers go back up.
---
I see your points and I used to be totally on your side. 
---
But I think this is a dead end topic. Bethesda has obviously made their mind up on this. 
---
I still know many games where the racist, sexist, or politically charged chat is still rampant, even with filters.
---
Yes!!! I love this so much and I'm so happy to see another couple that has two copies of the game to play together. My husband and I do this also 💕 A couple that kills wendigos, scorchbeast queens, Gouls, and supermutants together... stays together. Happy hunting!
---
Yep so now the only reason for unsolicited team invites will be free fast travel. I can live with that. I normal refuse all as is.
---
Ok cool, not just me. I was looking forward to playing a bit after I got back from work.... guess I have to be productive now. :-(
---
An hour or so ago, it only took seconds to remove. Getting lazy.
---
I had a cat as a target for the Vox Syringer daily recently. It was fun chasing it down the road. 
---
iirc, there was a Hurd of cats near a cliff side by Seneca Visitor Center.
---
Any ideas?
---
They feel like completely different games marketed at different players. So I would personally expect a minor drop in players, if at all. It probably won't be noticeable to the average player.
---
I was actually surprised how quickly i got good pieces. Well. Good in a sense. I got 3 unyielding and 2 bolstering. I run junkies gauss shotgun but if i'm not doing anything too difficult (basically SBQ) i lower my health a bit for a nice boost. I don't really have anything else i want to buy so i might try and roll some vanguard.
---
but to answer your question if i did more than 25 rolls for the whole lot i would be surprised.
---
Mack012166. But if this is a ddos attack we might be a while.
---
Craft a regular backpack and add the mod to it.
---
My ability to say thank you or sorry to someone shouldn't be limited because some people just need to be muted. Text chat would make the game even better for me.
---
Anything good?
---
At least those settlements might have needed help. The photo he wants of the black bear lodge is going to look remarkably similar to yesterday's picture of the black bear lodge.
---
Same here. Just 2 more pieces of the SS and my Gauss Minigun and attachments and I’m done. Honestly, they should open like some special limited time offer to buy all the lost gold. Something around those lines.
---
Mothman should be removed, yes, but only because it’s one of the most pointless enemies in the game. Not only does it fly away almost instantly, when it rarely chooses to attack, you can kill it in a few shots and its drops are pointless junk.
---
I have seen the skaters and then two people who wall breeched onto an elevated floor and won even having been in the storm for 6 minutes
---
thank you, high rad fluid has been the one thing that I never have enough of when stabilizing flux
---
I would love a one-life game mode. THIS single mechanic creates a competitive environment and with that, they could create an incentive for the revenue of pro gaming.
---
But that's just my opinion.
---
Sounds like a fallout game.
---
&gt;If we're going off the state of launch, apparently not a lot of people wanted online Fallout period. 
---
That's also true. But of the ones who wanted some kind of online multiplayer, it's also pretty clear the vast majority preferred just some form of co-op, similar to Borderlands.
---
&gt;What's so bad about having a gamemode separate from the main mode focused on pvp? By not having that, you are still denying a large portion of people who want to have fun shooting strangers in a game.
---
1. Because it splits dev resources, and PvE or PvP or (usually) both inevitably suffer. There are vanishingly few instances of games that actually do very well in both. And no, Destiny is no exception to that. 
---
2. Because PvE almost always involves some kind of gear upgrade system, and there will always be a group of players who clamor to get their gear advantages in PvP, and that *always* causes balance issues.
---
And if you do manage to create enough separation to effectively eliminate those issues, you effectively have two totally different games anyway, so why not just *make* them two totally separate games developed by two separate studios?
---
I went after the balloon plans specifically. Setting up a target practice range at camp was too good to resist.
---
I've got a QE25 10mm pistol that is so much fun I built a character around it. With gun fu and a high luck build I can shoot well over 100 rounds without running out of AP.  I just hold down the fire and crit buttons and let'er rip to mow down any mob. Not the most elegant play style LOL but it's amazing fun, like fireworks of murder. Works well enough in PVP too, even while vats is broken.
---
If I can make a build where I run around naked, punching things with only knuckles, then any build is possible.
---
Doubt it. PC/Xbox servers will still be packed as usual. Granted many PlayStation players play Last of Us so they'll look forward to Last of Us Part 2, but given how controversial it's going to be/the generic story plot, doubt many people will truly play it for long. If you ask me: It's way to over-hyped. But that's just my opinion on the matter.
---
Guess we'll find out what happens.
---
Considering the servers have, uh, "unplanned downtime" today and the IGN 76 roadmap event was cancelled and, unless you count the number of Fasnacht donuts consumed important, there's been no real news from Bethesda on the start date for Season one I'm pretty sure they player base is going to shrink a bit for the time being regardless of whatever games get released in the near future.
---
i didn't really care for the first one i doubt i'll play this one
---
edit: so according to the post i get to have servers to myself
---
How I can do that (sorry I'm new in the game?)
---
Aaah well the devs behind NW are different compared to the main devs. If anything, they should be in charge of any alternate gamemodes going forward while the main studio works on adventure, like buffing TSE and letting us not be at a bee's dick of HP to get high damage.
---
Right before the servers did lmao!
---
you have to do Order of the Tadpole to use that skin, I think
---
Not really just a few recently
---
Why could they not have added a pvp grouping system ffs....
---
I'm not interested in it 🤷‍♂️
---
It's pretty bad when Gajin games are more dependable than Bethesda, and Crossout is free to play. Maybe I should go back to playing Crossout again?
---
Scroll down on this link and you'll find every way to earn reputation and its severity.

This may be because I tend to stay away from the whole PvP aspect and I play solo, but what exactly do you mean "automatically bringing their entire team into pvp"?
---
Instigating super sledge with 40% swing speed when i was a melee build
---
could kill almost anything in one hit. And i used to love charging in to a mob and just going absolutely HAM
---
Great question-I’m level 230 and I’d be interested to know what answers come out of this one 👍
---
Check the front page
---
Started doing this after i heard they are removing team pvp.
---
Cant pvp? Guess ill grief lol
---
If you ever wonder why something stupid is happening in this game, just think of how the most lazy and uncreative methods developers can think up to force players to continue to play the game over a long period of time, regardless of whether it works or makes any sort of sense. Then you will understand a lot of the decisions that went into this game.
---
FO76 is encroaching on mobile game territory by this point. 
---
The cap on Caps, Gold Bullions, Legendendary scrips are all just mobile game "energy bar" mechanics in disguise. Once you go through them, you log out and come back tomorrow. There's nothing you can do to fast track it. e.g. You're limited to a maximum amount of GB per week, so there is a limit to how fast you can get that set of SS armor you want.
---
That's the true "core mechanic" of this game.
---
I live two shot weapons. They don’t serve a purpose with sniper builds. Heavy weapons commando and shotgun builds really shine with it. Also, if you use vats and have super high vats accuracy then both shots are more likely to hit the same mark.
---
Massive bans for duping. Sorry mate.
---
I cannot even sign into my account it says wrong username and password but it is correct. I try the find my account option and just get an error.
---
If they're not, or don't take you up on the offer, I'd be interested
---
Yes love the 3D on my Sony headset ❤️ I can easily follow sound
---
It's a skin, not the backpack itself. You need to either have the backpack from the Order of the Tadpole quests, or the Small Backpack found in Morgantown Airport. Once you are able to craft either of these, you can apply the backpack skin you bought to it.
---
No it’s not bans lmao
---
Ok thanks for your help 👊
---
Thanks for your help 👊👊
---
I like to run the Glassed Cavern, Westek, Charleston DMV, and of course the Golf Course.  Also, as mentioned, Encryptid, Radiation Rumble and Project Paradise are high level events.  Vault 79 is the end game gold vault for the Wastelander's questline.  Plenty of content for you on the way to that goal.  You can trigger the Riding Shotgun event by visiting the Big Bend Tunnel East and talking to the guy in the suit.  Doing the daily at the Hunter's shack, I forget the name, gets you a cryptid.  Roaming the road heading south from Thunder mountain down to Harper's ferry usually nets some nice high level enemies.  Beyond that, I just farm public events for notes and do the faction dailies from the Wastelander's quests.
---
can we get an update on how things are going?
---
Doesnt rly work cuz ur the cowards that are afraid of fighting othet people in a videogame lol
---
Doesn't this mean they're mostly likely being attacked rather than an outage?
---
I just want them to bring dogmeat back. Even if he’s just at the camp I miss my old road dog
---
Is it the same group of script kiddies who launch DDoS attacks on Blizzard when they get banned for botting or silenced for being DBags?
---
Trailers for what?
---
rewards are region bound. there is a healing salve plan for all of the regions, only mire and ash heap are rare tho. then every region has their seperate outfit loot pool, for the forest it‘s the responder outfits and the forest camo jumpsuit, for the savage divide it‘s the jumpsuit set + both scout masks. for the cranberry bog it‘s the asylum dresses and for the mire it‘s the tattered field jacket, leather coat &amp; traveling leather coat.
---
So if you as a solo player were to attack someone after they attack you, if that person has 3 other teammates then they could all 4 kill you once pvp is initiated. It has been that way since launch
---
Word.
---
There is an event that can be started at Big Bend Tunnel East, "Riding Shotgun" you talk to a guy named Vinny Costa to start it, has unique blueridge caravan gasmask and outfit rewards, aswell as a backpack plan and a CAMP plan for a blueridge Flag. I'm not sure what else is new with wastelanders, Radiation Rumble I think, but thats a bit of a shitfest if you actually want the rewards for completing it, as alot of people tend to go there to farm legendaries and not actually help collect ore for the event, meaning you may often not get to the maximum reward tier.
---
There's a buggy event called It's a Trap that uses the scorchbeast lures, though not sure if that required the detection system up and running.
---
I loved the chainsaw back when you could repair it to 200% and it did decent damage (on a level 20\~ char) :D
---
how are you even online right now? rude.
---
Oh thank god... you had me panicking!😂 thanks bro
---
Yeah, I've got a bloodied FFR 2* one of these and it shreds. Rough on vats though and pretty hard to aim with a controller, but the sound it makes is much fun
---
Project Paradise has a bunch of unique plans, outfits and backpack skins. Same for Riding Shotgun. Radiation Rumble has an outfit and the radioactive barrel plans. Encryptid has outfits, Fixer plans but mostly hats.
---
 Riding shotgun is nice as you can do it solo easily. Not so much with the rest.
---
Wasn't this supposed to be the case with The Outer Worlds? 
---
And it wasn't.
---
ya ya true, you win, I love that gun
---
It is being degraded which I'm not sure either.
---
I got rid of mine, didnt realize they were legacy :((((
---
You have no idea how many times i had 2 run to aid new players due to them getting jumped by team Tesla. I run a junkie (auto)rifle/melee build, and normally i add low level players to coach them into the story and build mechanics and just about each time they are sent on there own they get jumped so i have to go and torment whom ever is jumping them lol
---
I'm not. the server went down while I was playing 😔
---
Yeah, so now its meet up, slap everyone, everyone make sure they slap back, walk away, reform as a team and reapproach / reengage. Thats really janky, and going to make the setup take several minutes instead of several seconds and a lot more room for error. It also will now slap a red arrow onto the people who are often depending on stealth to do their dps, when we could circumvent that by having our tanks initiate pvp so they have the arrow. Guess im gonna be one of those players who logs in, gets 200 boullion /150 scripp/ 1400 caps and logs out in 15 mins :/
---
Lol,i said launcher not game.
---
That means the servers are down
---
It could but with the stability of their servers we can’t be sure
---
I'm completely aware of this reality, and it scares me. This game had and still does have potential to be something much greater. Especially with the traction FO76 got with the Wastelanders update. The community is there, the content (arguably) is also there, they just need to fucking acknowledge the fact that this shouldnt be like a fucking mobile game.
---
It fucking BOGGLES my mind why they pay no attention to making events more interesting and worth it. Instead they keep piling on stupid timed  "energy bar" mechanics. THAT IS NOT THE WAY TO KEEP US PLAYING. I am about to take a long break if this fucking farm route keeps giving me jack shit. Sucks to know that it will probably take a large portion of the community to stop playing for them to realize it's a problem.
---
You have a full set of SS uny sentinel?  Know how much scrip?
---
Skins work on the small backpack from Morgantown airport too.
---
I do this a lot, too. Not to resell but just to shop. I've been scouring for a witch dress or the plans but if I see a good deal I'm on it. Lol
---
Don't worry, the creation club store is online.
---
Vampire fss switchblade
---
It’s been a while but I believe they start popping up once you’ve progressed a certain amount in the Enclave questline.
---
Do you know da way?
---
Outer Worlds is actually what brought me to FO76 so not sure what the ecosystem was like before that :)
---
Exactly lol
---
No problem. If you're new to the game, it'll be easier to get the Small Backpack from Morgantown Airport. The Tadpole quest line takes quite a bit of work and/or time, and includes doing a lot of challenges and annoying exams on a computer. It's much better, but not really something that's easily done until about level 30 at least. The Small Backpack plan is much quicker, it's just sitting in a box at the airport, in the room where an NPC is hanging out by some terminals.
---
Any event with an ! Gives notes.
---
it‘s normal. any critters caught in the sonar scream turns scorched. didn‘t know it was possible for Behemoths tho, since super mutants don‘t have scorched variant. cool encounter!
---
Any of the public events with the ! Award them. The 3 daily faction quests give 3 each as well.
---
Most of the banked notes came from fasnacht
---
so no news yet?
---
You know what, if that's the case I'll admit I was in the wrong. I'm quick to criticize because so many people complain about anything and everything. Doesn't mean I should have said that. Thanks for advising me.
---
It was supposed to make fo76 dead.
---
Nothing stopping everyone from iniaiting the pvp slaps whilst in the team! But everyone has to do it!
---
I am hooked as well.  Love those vending machine finds!  30k + Bloody combat rifle for 800?  Yes please!  Junkies Fixer for 3400?  Oh yeah!
---
Fireproof makes sense indeed. Thanks.
---
I usually go with armor penetration, damage, critical but yeah, definitely need to keep range and accuracy high.
---
I just had to explain to my girlfriend why I was giggling, thanks
---
Could be. I haven't kept up with Blizzard in a really long time, outside watching the trailer for Diablo 4 that is.
---
Where did you get these stats? Just curious
---
They duped them.
---
Hopefully we both get the answers we are looking for!
---
I'm doing about 12 a day with photo daily and the raider settlers daily..dont even have to do wards quest I always have his stuff apparently
---
Ok That makes so much since!! And yeah is polly one of the dumbest things!!  Also Ty for clarifying, this really has got to be the best community I have ever had the pleasure of being a part of!!!
---
Change the name to PapaPepperoni.
---
PS. I am trying to expand the Enclave community in hopes Devs will add an Enclave faction &gt;.&gt;
---
*cough *cough recruit newbies into the enclave xD
---
I don’t think Last of Us is a fallout killer by any means. Very linear story. You play it and you’re done. But I do think, especially with the lack of major releases lately that there will be a dip.
---
I made them with modules. A crap ton of modules. I don’t waste my time with the legendary vendor anymore.
---
I try to do Project Paradise whenever I see it, but you need a big group to get the decent loot. I really want the plan for the Bear Arm weapon.
---
I loaded up on Fasnacht. Now I have over 200 and whenever I do public events, I’ve had a hard time getting below 200. I almost want to avoid events so that I can actually get rid of notes
---
&gt; Because it splits dev resources, and PvE or PvP or (usually) both inevitably suffer.
---
The game has two studios working on it. Austin made/is working on Adventure mode, Dallas has worked on NW. It's not a herculean feat to have one game studio work on a pvp side gamemode whilst borrowing code/already made assets from the main game, while you have another studio work on the main draw of the game.
---
&gt; ...and that always causes balance issues.
---
FO76 already has balance issues lol. Funny enough, NW made a lot of guns viable. But whatever, having a side mode dedicated to a pvp experience(like forcing new characters every season) wouldn't harm the balance in adventure.
---
check the fo76 sub and see if anyone has posted about it
---
This is so accurate 😂
---
van and uny alone are a little easier. Sent only appears on 3* pieces so half the time what you get isn't even eligible. Sucks.
---
If you’re on PS4 I might have a spare witch dress that I can give ya...lol if the servers were up I’d check!
---
Nah
---
i can get in
---
I just moved my level 22's camp next to grafton dam like I'm building a godamned rust raid base to take on those super mutants
---
Oh absolutely, I have a Bloodied Explosive variant and a Quad Firerate, nothing stands a chance against those damage outputs. Also, the ammo for it is just ridiculously cheap since 7 steel = 5 bullets with ammo perk (even better with super duper). Not to mention, that sound effect with the reload... 
---
Bloodied handmade are fun but railway rifle is just amazing.
---
Hold your horses bub
---
Alright that makes sense, I haven’t even stumbled upon the enclave yet
---
Thanks dude I really appreciate it
---
Happy bday!!
---
Trust me we all wanna play fallout!
---
I'd think that the best of the best Vault 76 vault dwellers, those who have won prestigious rewards such as [Best Looking Hair and Toilet \(??\)](https://i.imgur.com/rHWAQAq.jpg) would be able to plant cranberries.
---
Getting the same issue on Xbox.
---
Thank you! It’s good to know it’s a generalization thing and not entirely event specific
---
I got two for every fasnacht event, all 180 of them that I ran.  LOL
---
\+Path of Exile
---
There are dozens of posts about it over the past few hours. Probably a good idea to check those out.
---
you got onto reddit to ask about it.. but you didnt see the 10.000 posts in the last couple of hours about the same thing?
---
I think they’re taking legacy’s away. They said they were but I dont know for 100%
---
I thought itd be an easy money maker if they forced you to even buy special garden tiles for different plants. I'd buy them.
---
Damn! Those are some good deals!! Nice work! ;)
---
&gt; you talk to a guy named Vinny Costa
---
You can start the event any time you want?
---
Damn bro calm down lol, shit happens. How often do the Bethesda servers go down?
---
Except in Destiny you don't get players that have an rifle that suddenly does explosive damage and one shots you while they just spray wildly whilst jumping up and down.
---
Destiny doesn't have bullshit, broken legendaries.
---
Bro ty 😁
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/new/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/new/)
---
Depends on how long you can play per day. If you are pretty efficient you can do those 3 faction questions in 30-45 minutes (at least with my loading screens, that’s how long it takes). So that’s 9. If you are on for another hour there should be three or four events popping up. 
---
Jump into Uranium Fever, One Violent Night, Enlightenment, Line in the Sand, SBQ, etc. depends on your level. You only need a few to get the other 11. Maybe in 90 minutes you would have all 20 tickets.
---
Yeah, I have a $LoginError_GameCodeFailure [3:0:9]
---
Explosive Gatling laser, regret selling it
---
Yeah the accuracy mods reduce the spread when you're aiming, that's important. I like aligned on most guns for the vats efficiency, but true on shotguns for the better accuracy. Or run with enforcer and do crowd control crippling all the legs, that's fun too.
---
wait he turned into a scorched human? that‘s awesome.
---
Any item that already exists in the would should be a findable plan. Atomic shop should be for unique items only.
---
Ps I still want the nuka bottle lamp from the big quest line.
---
I got my settlers rep maxed legit last week it’s not that bad. You just need to donate your rewards with ward for booted rep gain and deliver photos of the raiders to him every day from Davenport daily and you’ll be done a lot faster. The daily quest rewards aren’t that worth it and you still get treasury notes.
---
I didn’t even know a bear arm existed in the game now but I’ve seen this events name a lot I’ll definitely run it best I can next time it’s up!
---
I love it, now the jackasses who have hundreds of plans in their shop will learn theyre worth about 10% of listed value, not the suggested price.
---
I can see how awesome this would look though!
---
que sad trombone
---
The new dynamite bundle is legit.
---
Oh I know, I was just kinda reinforcing your point. Only a few of mine are even keepers. Most of my 3 stars, the 3rd star is trash. I only have 2 AP refresh on my uny.
---
I honestly only badly wanted a quad because of obvious crowd control advantages. But expected at least same damage... 😂
---
ah yes because i refuse to fight the bloodied, bunny hopping, assassin armor clad tesla user who probably has stacked his bobbleheads im a coward.
---
fallout pvp is an unbalanced shitshow.
---
i play enough pvp on other games, fallout is not a game i can see pvp thrive in unless they SEVERELY revamp it.
---
i don't see your average joe-smoe looking for a fight with his super sledge or pipe revolver, the only people that want pvp are the ones that have their full build min-maxed for it and just turn it into a big 1 sided battle, thats not pvp, thats griefing.
---
But why
---
You and everyone else if you'd check the front page
---
If you think Bethesda plans to compensate us for this "inconvenience", that's not gonna happen. Bethesda is already playing this outage way down by claiming it's "intermittent". There's nothing intermittent about this outage. It's a hard down for everyone as far as I can see. It also appears to be their authentication system that's down. When a login system goes down, it takes everything else behind it down with it. I'm sure the FO76 servers are fine, sitting back there idling with no one on them. It's just that we can't log into them to play.
---
Some engineer at Bethesda probably tried rolling out a patch to this authentication system and fatfingered it, bringing the whole thing down. Now they're having to recover them. Though why it's taking 4 hours and counting is a bit of a mystery. AWS (and other cloud services) offers snapshot backups. They should have reverted to a snapshot hours ago and been back online. Sounds to me like Bethesda might need to hire some expertise in their Site Reliability Engineering team.
---
Dear God, Ultracite Laser Rifles are hot garbage at the moment [i modified a very good 3* legendary variant: Anti armor, +50% Limb Damage, +15% Critical Meter] yet it's still complete indisputably trash... 2 shots to kill a level 6 Scorched! Yet it takes 1 shot from an automatic Handmade to kill up to lvl 14/20 enemies. 
---
I really HOPE the 'One Wasteland For All' update truly balances weapon damage/condition across the board because right now it's extremely lacking to say the least...
---
You and everyone else if you bother to check the first post
---
Run every world event that starts, even the crappy ones (tea time, I'm looking at you) and you will have a pile of T-Notes.  
---
Just skip Distinguished Guests, even I have my limits...  That one starts and I server hop!
---
It's about the right height for it and has suitable standing animations on the keyboard, where the normal terminal has you crouch down, or float while crouching if it's placed higher up!
---
Now I’m sad
---
I am going to miss my 3v1 fights where I get to farm multiple people for caps until they quit. I like cleaning house when the little shit bag parties roll through. There are several aspects of the current system I don't like but I'd rather have the whole team go red instead of having to try and individually start pvp with each. If people have pacifist on and their teammates start pvp then I think it's good they aren't dragged into it. I just hope they don't make more loopholes for the griefer wannabes to use to screw with people. I'd say hacked weapons and god mode are bigger issues for pvp than the new changes.
---
Error screen changed for me. Now it is "LoginError[3:0:9]" I guess there is no much time left to wait
---
This exactly.
---
It's a good thing I didn't put any money down. I'd have lost, picking under
---
&gt;But whatever, having a side mode dedicated to a pvp experience(like forcing new characters every season) wouldn't harm the balance in adventure.
---
Of course it does, if they change anything specifically to balance PvP. If it's all part of the same game, it uses the same game install and same assets, of course some changes in one game mode are going to impact the other. It's impossible *not* to.
---
So again, why bother making it part of the same game at all? Why not just split it off and make the PvP "side mode" an actual PvP game with its own install and its own assets?
---
In reality you want both.   But specifically you want Fireproof to protect against explosive damage and Adamantium Skeleton for when you are using the Enforcer perk to prevent crippling yourself.
---
As far as shotguns go, get closer.  
---
As has been stated, you VATS shotgun will do much better than your Quad Explosive because increased VATs guides every pellet to the enemy, even if you are further back than optimal distance.  However, if you are further back with your Quad, a number of the pellets are going to miss, doing less overall damage.
---
One thing that I've found about shotguns is that you need to be close to get the full effect.  
---
The Shotgun build pairs well with Heavy Gunner.  So if you want to also be able to switch it up for distance kills, get yourself a good .50 Cal...
---
Nice! My one mule has a lot of my good stuff for that reason too...almost 1K pounds I think...I need to start a spreadsheet of my stuff lol.
---
Hi gang
---
Is it still down ?
---
I tried logging in, it shows green but disconnected ...
---
Im confused..
---
thx all!
---
Jean
---
Yes, I am! LoveIsAbusive (it's my oldest boys old account, dont judge me lmao) 
---
I had one at one time and accidentally scrapped the dang thing. Now that I'm a little more used to the game I'd like to think I wouldn't do that again. 
---
But yeah, add me if they ever get these servers up and running again. Even if you don't have one!
---
Yeah it's a beast. Best time to do it is if a group is farming Scorched Earth as they'll often jump on it after the 3rd nuke and it's usually a win. Hopefully when the new team system comes in it'll be a lot easier to do these things. Project Paradise is one of my favourite events but it really needs enough people to do it.
---
Man, it certainly doesn’t feel like there’s a timer. I’ve been in a perpetual state of being diseased lately. I get one, cure it, and have another in very short order, or at least it feels like it!
---
Simple baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire. Then go around poppin skulls like Negan.
---
Servers are down. I get same error.
---
Haha, I can't believe it's so simple.  That's not even a glitch, that's operating exactly as it was designed, it's just really stupid design!
---
They need to investigate what went wrong with the hardware and/or software this causing this issue.
---
This is correct. It has not been changed on the PTS.
---
I’ve already drank four cases of dew I don’t know if I’m going to have any left when the servers come online.
---
No, it's not you.
---
I can't manage to log in with my Bethesda account anyway, neither on their website nor through the Bethesda Launcher.
---
I was starting to worry my account might be compromised...
---
My instigating shotgun performs the same way. It kind of shocked me honestly, as I started using it as a full Rifle build and didnt suspect my completely unspecced for shotgun would absolutely obliterate my rifles and make them essentially useless. Very few enemies require more than 2 rounds to die in vats.
---
They need to increase scrip cap to 300 for this tomorrow!!! [Speech Check Failed]
---
Got most of what I had from Fasnacht. Those are almost gone though, tomorrow Fasnacht will have paid for most of my T-65 and it’s mods 😁
---
I got some extra :)
---
I keep meaning to do that then I see that camp with 14 armor and 12 weapons on the map and the viscous cycle begins...
---
You are a wise man. Thank you
---
Roadmap 2020
---
Yep teslas are weak af if not quad.
---
Even if they are range is too weak. Maybe on consoles where no one can aim....
---
Bobbleheads dont stack.
---
Bloodied builds go down in 1 shot from even basic guns.
---
Plasma flamer
---
I could be wrong but I think all of the games attached to Bethesda are down.
---
That would requite them fixing exploits and 3rd party software.
---
It would help is Bethesda pit more then I think 4 updates for NW in the year its been out
---
Will do! And don’t worry, I’m not judging with the name lol! ;)
---
Same here!
---
I think SBQ gives 4 so I do the daily’s and a couple of queen fights and I’m good
---
I think this must be Bethesda's new multifactor authentication coming into play.
---
PS4  Same
---
Nah nah nah. The ultimate. Sex.Tuple. XP.
---
I like that the only things working are the website and, of course, the digital store.
---
No but I’ve put it on the list ty!
---
I don't think it's MFA since it's affecting consoles too.
---
That's a good point about enforcer and crippling yourself. Or just stay in power armor since the double barrel can't be silenced anyway.
---
No, triple RP weekend. Instead of 250 RP daily, how about 1500 RP for each faction quest? And, how about offering us a way to get more RP per day?
---
Does no one bother to check the literal first post of the subreddit before posting?
---
It seem to only affect Reddit users
---
Haha everyone that pvps 😂
---
Hahahaha!  That is so my problem too!!! Then it gets late...and you’re about to log off, then u say one more server hop...and bam!! Tons more shops with lots of stuff on the map!! ;)
---
I think this is definitely why we can’t do it, I just wish they’d allow maybe 1-3 “special” crops at our camp. That way the ones you like to use the most are easily accessible, but you’re still encouraged to go out for the others. 
---
As it stands, I rarely go hunting for the ones we can’t grow and just forego the benefits of recipes that include them. I’d be more inclined to make the more sophisticated recipes if I had a few of the special ingredients at my camp. 
---
Hell, it could also encourage people to visit other camps for more than just checking out their vendor items.
---
Dragon used to be able to drop as legendary. It was inexplicably left out of the loot pool when the purveyor was introduced. Since the purveyor’s loot pool is now the same one used for normal legendary enemies, it means you can’t get legendary Dragons anymore. It also used to be able to be equipped with the black powder rifle’s large bayonet mod but at some point they changed that.
---
This also applies to the Ripper and Cultist Blade, though you can still get a unique 1* Bloodied Cultist Blade from the One Violent Night event called the Nailer.
---
I would say that making the machine should use the holotape aswell just because Bethesda wants to have some awkward aspect about something new... (when I say use I mean it’s actually used to make the machine)
---
How often does this happen? Got the game 2 days ago amd haven't had any complaints until now...
---
Awesome. :D
---
That is my life now...hahahaha
---
Do legendary dragons not drop anymore?
---
Can't fight. Can't even have an adult conversation. What a surprise... You food builds always resort to name calling when you can't hold your own. Catch you in the wastes sweetie 😘
---
ah yes, till you introduce stuff like stat boosts, serendipity and the stuff alike.
---
dont forget cola nut and quantums!
---
i dont know the pvp meta. but unless prepared pvp is just a 1 sided slaughter.
---
The nuka bottle lamp was an atomic shop item? (never works for me anyway mind)
---
Yes, still down NA East PS4. 
---
Good luck.
---
Yeah it has a 45-60 minute cooldown and won't cooldown on private servers (If you play private, you will have to jump to public to do it to have it reset in private afaik).
---
I’ll be on there with you.
---
 I can count on one hand the number of games I‘ve bought on release day - I’ll eventually get LoU2, but  I’m quite content to give it time for the price drop(s).
---
Don't forget the rolling pins....  
---
 Seriously, my day isn't over until a high level 3\* legendary drops a nocturnal rolling pin into my lap....  At least it's light script...
---
I'm still waiting for the day that I get a junkies explosive rolling pin...
---
Project Paradise for sure
---
Well I missed that one still its IN THE GAME should be a plan.
---
It's their login system that's down. Anything that requires logging in will be affected, this includes ESO and mods.
---
Agreed! Thats a good idea! Although if I had to pay for special garden tiles, I would expect the plant to grow there by default (without needing to go find it and plant it or replant it if damaged for some reason).
---
Two shot bats hit auto grenade launcher
---
nah it’s m’lady
---
Not for long lol. I melted them before having chance to see if their appearance changed unfortunately as I was just vats blasting away and saw the name. It's a really  cool feature. You see them get the green glowing poisen effect as they change.
---
May I ask what Quest we are talking about ? thank you ;0
---
jean
---
PS Encryptid ?
---
Or maybe they're being DDOS?
---
Yup totally making it up because you're too lazy to read what the shitty company you support says
---
very cool, thank you
---
I don't know if this has anything to do with them, but if it does, props to them. I wasn't expecting anything from those threats.
---
It's like the riots and protests that took place recently over the US, they were fighting for a good cause (well the PvPers maybe not, but the game needs improvements overal), their destructive behaviour achieved nothing, but they got a hell of attention from doing it.
---
Read the first post and find out
---
&gt; Yup totally making it up because you're too lazy to read what the shitty company you support says 
---
Says the person too lazy to provide the proof.
---
Yeah, the irony of that statement isn't lost on anyone.
---
Threads closed bud, you lost, move along "sweetie".
---
Salty you're not getting the reaction you want :(
---
FYI my build is a Junkies, although I'd rather be food than bloodied.
---
Pathetic.
---
maybe if you didn't want to be gunned down, you and your team should get gud. If you are bad at a game, the good players take your things, what a surprise.
---
Read the first post on the subreddit
---
I am at over 30 rolls right now for a crappy torso piece. I haven't event started the others pieces yet.
---
So I'm not doing anything wrong, oh thank god
---
The internet is also full of that garbage though, and it's still incredibly beneficial. So I don't think the potential for abuse is itself a good reason to do away with the idea.
---
We'll see what happens. So far it does seem like Bethesda isn't very interested, but I doubt that's for content reasons.
---
It’s leviOsa, not leviosAR.
---
You’re not the only one, we’re all in the same boat and it’s sinking fast
---
I got a lvl 40 bloodied swing speed combat knife when I was around lvl 40....currently at lvl 463 and still use it all the time...got heaps of far more op melee weapons but have sooo much fun with the knife!
---
You see I’m at that point where I really don’t think another developer can do a better job, which sucks. I just feel like a lot of the charm and aspects of the game we enjoy so much comes from Bethesda when they actually care. I know they’re shitty rn, but Bethesda games have always been something special to me. Something that is not easily replicated.
---
SOME,  and thats the minority, most requires the standard backpack gained from Order of the Tadpole
---
Getting the same thing on PS4.
---
Bethesda just punishes the people who try to show them where the faults are in the code, etc, so why even bother trying to help them out anymore
---
I never see anyone doing project paradise. I’m level 90 and I just did my first one yesterday. I don’t get it it’s actually a really fun event
---
Incredible, I've only ever seen it started one time and always wondered why. I can't believe people don't run it constantly since it's got basically one of the only free backpacks that's not just a scout reskin.
---
Ohhh...on another side note. I’ll see 2 or 3 camps I want to visit but can’t decide on which one to go to 1st...I get major FOMO. Because one of the owners might log or server hop before I’ve had the chance to check them out! Lol
---
Im getting the same code was looking forward to playing
---
I didn’t even get a beret. Did get omw and the Deathclaw tho. I dropped them all except those two.
---
Thank you for the follow up, everyone.  I also discovered that the previously added exclusion in my AV was gone.  Adding the exclusion back didn't help, of course.
---
Reinstall immediately
---
"Tricking people" Boofuckinghoo
---
It also use to work for making scorchbeasts land. I haven’t tried it recently to see if it still works on them.
---
:)  I've had 2 high levels do this to me.   And now I have 2 or more of all the mounted heads, and no one to take them!
---
I did save a level 9 player from getting killed during a cargo drop at Morgantown airport last night
---
My main is lvl 425 but I've got a lvl 3 I need to level up. Down to team up depending on when you play, PSN is in profile.
---
What stat boosts?? Endurance doesnt give hp. Unless they have that bug that makes bloodied builds reset their hp they will always go down in 1 spray.
---
Quantums is broken that i agree should just delete them people who have more than 200. 
---
I pvp alot and barely anyone uses them tho.
---
Such a quandary!
---
Drats, she used to have that tweet pinned on her profile!
---
The imposter. Remember, we have to use some pretty fancy tech to take down her shields enough to even hurt her. And she hits brutally hard with melee OR deathgaze.
---
Heh you're welcome. Also, if you're not already aware, a lot of regional events have a chance to drop rare outfits and plans. I rarely miss Mire events or dailies for the very slim chance at raider outfits.
---
I probably play too much, I seem to be earning somewhere between 30-50 notes per day, as my total is steadily rising, a week ago I had around 700 excess notes, now I have over 900!
---
Thats a dope tip man, appreciate it. But I thought that T-51b and X-01 have better DR and ER? Excavator is good for carry weight though
---
Wipe your hard drives! It’s a trap!
---
Who knows. Everyone is in the dark right now till it alleviates
---
That's the problem. It's not fun and competitive it's always a curb stomp by ridiculously leveled characters with a boat load of legendary items and all their triple digit friends.
---
Shit like this keeps me off the public servers except for shopping trips.
---
Wow. I always scrip them or drop em for noobs.
---
I advise reading the first post on the subreddit
---
Those locked rooms in the Whitespring would be perfect for this
---
You expect the same people to see this? :)
---
when i find camps not worth the caps spent on travelling, i steal everything thats not locked. mostly crops obviously, but occasionally collectrons and resource collectors. after hopping around looking for decent weapons or armor to flip for an hour or so, i usually have enough to craft 100+ adhesive
---
Can't say I've tried them all but I've not found any that won't yet.
---
While I agree they should have made it a more fun grind, like instead of a daily thing be a weekly so you don’t HAVE to get on every day it does give you more of an end game goal that has less rng involved because most of the new plans are worth it and you know what you’re getting instead of spending 2000 scrip for a chance at nocturnal roll of the new gear lmao.
---
You keep complaining.. but unless you can do what they can’t learn to shut your trap before you speak.
---
You mean about 5 hours ago it was ok.
---
New Vegas still works.
---
how TF did you get enough modules to get full uny/sent sets already? That's got to be some *insane* luck.
---
Had this game for a while now, maybe a couple of months? First time this has happened for me.
---
I wish it was something like ffxiv you walk up to a board and can see everything that everyone is selling. Compare prices and buy the cheapest.  I’m totally on board with that. Although it will break some people hearts learning what things cost. In the marketplace.
---
Edit: ff xiv has a limit of 1 million so maybe it’s not a fair comparison
---
again, high agility + serendipity, AP regen armor and perks already ruins alot.
---
cant kill the bloodied build at 20% hp if their perkset wont let you hit them in the first place
---
Very very very rare
---
I pvp with friends more than anyone else and we all have high end gear. It's actually quite fun if you understand the mechanics and find willing participants. A friend and I ended up fighting a guy after Scorched Earth. We emoted to each other and I gave him some spare ammo after. I've had several fight where we say GG and I'll often drop them some stims or ammo. I've also had many more fights with the asshole that want to bully people and most of them don't stick around long once they realize you aren't easy prey. Most of the people running the hacked weapons are really terrible at pvp on top of that.
---
Naaa shgames debunked it its fractions of a percent litteraly not worth the effort of crafting except for a jetpack
---
I'm not here for a reaction dear, I'm simply defending op saying that people do want pvp in this game lol. It's obvious people do, I pvp with people everyday, Reddit is just a weird hive mind and tries to bury anyone asking for pvp to be fixed.
---
Same here on xb1 us
---
Check your antenna
---
I’ve never played anything that is as horribly grindy that wasn’t a mobile game.
---
Good idea my error code might be different to yours though, so we all need to post those.
---
This "shotgun" bug actually hapens to every weapon that fires multiple pellets at once.  
---
Shotguns, Explosive Lasers &amp; Gatling Plasmas with the Beam splitter mod, Harpoons
---
I got some awesome chem recipes like formula P and a couple legendary drops from project paradise yesterday, it’s really fun but you need a couple people
---
Eh. There will be a dip but a significant one though...?
---
We have steam chart stats now at least so we'll know how much it's affected the steam PC playerbase at the very least.
---
Cause servers are still down, who woulda thunk
---
Skynet has come
---
Hypothetically if I get banned I will never return to this franchise lol.
---
Never duped, never scammed anyone so if me of all people gets the "big ban hammer" instead of Johnny level 4000 with an exploding lead pipe. I'll gladly throw this buggy game out the window :)
---
Some time between now and Armageddon.
---
Ap doesnt make you hard to kill.
---
Pvp meta is full health with lots of points in end.
---
Haha I just bought this game today after months of mulling it over. I was worried it would still be too buggy to play
---
How or why would a sp game that can be played leisurely at your own pace affect a mmo type-ish fps rpg game.
---
Do 20 hail todds
---
They can’t even steal it. It’s immediately disappeared from the game to prevent theft.
---
Who?
---
If caps aren’t an issue for you do 5 encrypteds. They go fast and are easy treasury note/legendary farm
---
Yea even if they don’t want to hurt the business by perma banning cheaters, at least they can do temp ban for three days or a week in PVP game mode if reported and verified. The cheater still gets to enjoy PVE during that period.
---
This is why online-only is a mistake. If I pay for something, I should be able to play it.
---
And people wonder why Steam is still well liked.
---
Admittedly not on the same level but I've seen sheepsquatch smack the shit out of a dominator without too much fuss. Beth should make it happen. Only way to be sure lol.
---
The future is unknowable except to time travelers, who run the risk of altering the future by revealing it to you.
---
i try to avoid blowing shit up when acting stealthy.. YMMV
---
Yeah I didn't realise you could start it at first, figured it was like most other events, so I'd be lucky to see it pop up maybe once or twice a day, then I checked the wiki, found out you just have to talk to vinny and since then I run it probably 6-12 times a day. I've gotten all the plans and outfits multiple times now, but they sell REALLY well, like 5k for the backpack plan, 500 per outfit item etc. I've sold the backpack plan about half a dozen times and about a dozen outfits and gasmasks, its a good money maker.
---
It’s been down a good 5 hours now. All of Bethesda’s games are down according to their website. Check there or twitter for updates.
---
They're the only ones "for now". Itd be cool to see some custom made stuff.
---
I use a instigating lever action as one of my main weapons.  You will be fine.
---
my point still stands, that anyone unprepared for pvp (which im willing to bet is ATLEAST 80% if not more of the people) just get stomped.
---
Sooo....pretty soon then. With how 2020 is going so far...
---
 [https://fed76.info/a/wastelanders-unlockables/](https://fed76.info/a/wastelanders-unlockables/) 
---
Just hop into any Event when the notice pops up, I just jump in all the time, and I'm swimming in more Treasury Notes than I'll ever be able to clear, unless I stop playing and just log in to claim GBs. Stupid 200 GB daily cap
---
Doesn't the E kind of go against the stealth part of your build, even with the suppressor?
---
Grenades, such as the Plasma Grenade, do well with the Explosive and Grenedier perks.  The only problem is the blast radius is still relatively small.  So they are best for enclosed locations and when you know what you are doing.  Can't tell you how many times I've killed myself with a badly thrown Plasma grenade.
---
The 40mm Grenade launcher is quite good, especially one with Instigating and FFR.  However, they break really quickly.  So you really need both Gunsmith 5 and Explosive Damage 5.
---
The most important cards will be a handful of rifleman or commando cards for leveling. Heavy gun builds are essentially non-viable until lvl 40-50 and incomplete until lvl 70-80 and really higher for other cards to swap in temporarily. So the most important thing early on is not putting points in the wrong stat just to have to reallocate them later. Plan your build in advance. It's safe to get the 1\* only cards that will not drop from packs: Green Thumb, Picklocks, Hackers, Scrapper, etc.
---
The easiest way to build a heavy character is with a suppressed rifle and have someone share escape artist. Get yourself to lvl 20 and have someone craft you a Fixer if you don't have a low level legendary to use. Then head to events with lots of high level stuff to tag while others kill them off. You'll level up fast.
---
I'd suggest putting the 3 points into Inspirational, then go to town on Intelligence (more XP) and Agility (more AP) early, followed by Strength and Perception (to run Rifleman/Commando 1\* cards) as useful.
---
 [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f424d7b&amp;d=s01sq2s32sr2ao0a04l71ls2lt2lu2p00pe2cu2ce0sg2eh1ii0ip2ir2s12id2st0a30](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f424d7b&amp;d=s01sq2s32sr2ao0a04l71ls2lt2lu2p00pe2cu2ce0sg2eh1ii0ip2ir2s12id2st0a30) 
---
(Side note: I put in all the cards I pop on and off from time to time and the roadmap gets me up to around lvl 130 to get all the cards I use occasionally, and many of those no longer come from perk packs.)
---
That's roughly my heavy gun build. Differences are I run 3\* Bear Arms all the time (but it's a crutch you should avoid if possible) and I usually still keep 3x1\* Rifleman equipped for general running around and silos with a Lever. Glow Sight goes on for nuke zones. Batteries Included could come off now that I've gotten rid of hundreds of Plasma and Fusion cores, but I wouldn't see much from any replacement card. Gunsmith would probably make the most sense but that character has hundreds of repair kits from SBQ. Other difference is since they stopped allowing the Queen to be crippled, I've switched to Mysterious Savior in place of One Gun Army. The staggering effect is not all that useful when enemies that are susceptible to staggering are dead in a couple bullets.
---
As for PA, I wouldn't even bother until Excavator at lvl 25. And that just for the carry weight if you're not wearing unyielding (which you should, if possible, if you're trying to level as quickly as possible) and have a backpack. Raider PA sucks. T45 sucks. Can't get into T51 until lvl 30. Can't get into X01 until lvl 40. Level 25 Excavator is the first useful set of PA in the game imo, except for the frame itself to jump off mountains.
---
Yup! Ugh.
---
you’d be safe and sound with a suppressor
---
Make sure you tag every Bethesda representative you know to get their attention. I'd hate for them to not know about your critically important error.
---
Do you play this game?
---
