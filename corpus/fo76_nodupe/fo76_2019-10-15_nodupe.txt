Good job counting. I cant count much higher than 10. 🤓 What's the overall counter at?
---
---
---
Vampire, the extra bash isn't that great and two shot is nice but it isn't that fantastic. This will give you extra staying power and the extra 10% is always nice for aiming.
---
With the ammosmith perk card you make 3 at a time. Quite worth it.
---
Damn, that's a great haul!
---
I’m having xb live issues. Before that some of my friends were. Didn’t get my errors through 76.
---
Probably cause Xbox live was down
---
650 hours in. It has its moments, very fun with friends, community is great. Glitches are what you expect from a Bethesda title still but they’re working on them. 
---

---
Can’t say I agree with the no NPC decision, glad they’re reversing that. Factions still feel underdeveloped. We need more reasons to communicate with one another imo. And endgame is just nuke, raid, event, repeat really it’s really boring if you don’t have a consistent friend group.. The trading sub is like 80% of the fun I get out of this game alone.
---
Overall I do regret my preorder tricentennial, but I can’t say It’s a game I regret playing, 100% I’m happy to have gotten this game just wish I waited a bit. 
---
I’m a former Runescape player so the initial commitment to cosmetics only was something I liked. I can’t say I like the direction the atom shop is moving. I just hope it doesn’t move any further down that hole, rs3 just had its lowest average playercount in over a decade because of MTX, and I don’t want to see that happen here. The game’s good, not great, definitely not the best, but good, and I enjoy every moment spent with friends
---
this plus if you boost your int up you get over charged cores that last longer
---
You know, if someone had hacked my account, it would have to have been my Microsoft account right? I guarantee you if someone had had my Microsoft info for the seven or eight hours they’d have found something more interesting to do with the info than fuck with my characters on 76. It’s another example of the game logging someone in to someone else’s account that’s the only logical explanation, but they’ll never admit it.
---
To be fair, reading through both your topic post and comment replies on the topic, you constantly sideways put the blame to the devs for something you didn't pay attention to. The only reason you are being down voted is because instead of plainly asking a question, you go ahead and also say "Bethesda, why? ". This comes across as an itch to slander someone instead of genuinely looking for help. 
---
And... Probably going on a limb here as I didn't search about similar topics about this problem and this is the first time I hear about a UI bug like this since launch day, I'd go as far as to call you a compulsive liar, because I doubt the bug actually happened, you simply overlooked it for so long and instead of admitting it you are calling it a bug that supposedly happened on your end (also no image proof etc) . 
---
Just my two cents on why the community may feel unwelcoming to your post. Be on this subreddit a while and you'd be surprised with how many blatant tantrum or outright misinforming posts most of us read up.
---
Thank you. You’re correct.
---
Yeah... On Xbox :(
---
My welcome or his?
---
You can go to  [https://bethesda.net/en/status](https://bethesda.net/en/status) to check Bethesda's servers.
---
I have played probably almost as much as you, I’ve never seen it.
---
I killed one.
---
Also the side building on the south side of Harper's ferry, with the black powder weapons in the display cases
---
I did. Said operational. I just know they are slow to update that page sometimes.
---
Do the quest. You can then drop them. Still weightless regardless
---
Do you even know what this post is about or are you just a troll trying to sow discord
---
You ever come across another plasma nade plan, you wanna hook a brotha up
---
Oh ok. Just making sure you were aware. It always seems like it's updated pretty fast to me.
---
Everybody is downvoting you because you seem to be unwilling to understand how the first rank (star) of a perk card could cost 2 perk points. 
---
It's pretty simple math...
---
Level 1(2 points) + level 2(1 point) + level 3(1 point) = 3 levels total(4 points total)
---
That'd be cool, like for example the lower your Karma the higher the value of your bounty when you commit crimes.
---
Because it is pretty powerful perk?
---
What do you want for them?  I'm on ps4 too.
---
Stars indicate levels used. Lone wanderer3 star perk card took three levels to accomplish but uses up 4 ability point.  A one star card takes one level to acquire and it can use 1-3 ability points. 
---
Based on other comments, your confusion about the games system has shown you to be very cynical about Bethesda and this game. It makes me laugh
---
Dunno. I counted for shits and giggles then kept counting like a serial killer.
---
Good job.
---
I didnt notice any extra charge, do I need more than 22 INT?
---
or just rifles in general, auto rifles are pretty heavy as well......
---
Same answer
---
Pistols have stagger with modern renegade, and tank killer is really good for the armor penetration.
---
Gonna give you a list of things you missed. This is a copy paste message and may not be applicable to the questions asked. Reply and I'll go into detail on things if you want
---
March is when they actually started improving the game, from Nov-Feb it was only bug fixes and a boring world. Not listing things in any order, you missed:
---
two weeklong holiday events (minor addition)
---
alcohol crafting with daily quests (minor addition) 
---
a camera for taking quicker pictures (minor addition)
---
New faction and questline with backpack reward (large addition)
---
Sheepsquatch questline with unique weapon reward and side quests, two repeatable events (major addition)
---
Small dungeon with quest (small addition)
---
Large dungeon with repeatable event (large addition)
---
Player Vending Machines (small addition)
---
Nuclear Winter game mode with 51 other players in a battle Royale scenario with special cosmetic rewards (major addition)
---
Special vendor that gives random Legendaries in exchange for other Legendaries (small addition)
---
Vault Raid which gives guaranteed armor rewards with unique set bonuses (major addition)
---
Display cases for your camp which allows you to place items so visitors can view them (minor addition)
---
Basically I put either small, large, or major for what these updates added to the game. However, that's only in terms of content. For example I would say player vending and the legendary vendor were bigger adds than say Survival mode or the Arktos Pharma dungeon. Still a buggy game though, but that's what Bethesda is. Wastelanders will be like a chapter 2 with a supposedly different feel but I am cautious
---
Modern renegade adds 4% chance to cripple per rank, not stagger. And yes tank kill is fantastic for AP, but it doesn't work on pistols
---
If you use the scrounger perk, you can occasionally get some that way. I found two within a few minutes of each other with that perk maxed out.
---
I meant tank killer is really good for armor penetration on rifles, a lot of people rely on it for damage like me
---
I don't think it is OK to do it, I am just saying you can't sterilise online interaction and make it safe for everyone. How many people here make jokes about dirty communists? How many people would be (maybe are) offended by that? 
---
Are race and sexuality the only two ones that matter? Religion? Foreigners? Where would you draw the line?
---
Both
---
It seems like a good, polished game, just maybe not the right fit for me personally.
---
ok thats what i thought  i didn't have either of the walking cane mod plans till just then now to find the other plan
---
Considering how my grenades seem to either just bounce right past where I want to throw them to or fall waaaay short, I wouldn’t even give them grenades. Just horseshoes.
---
nope 22 int is pretty good if you look at a normal 100% fusion core and a crafted fusion core you should see a second white line through the normal durability bar kinda like over repairing armor or weapons i know for a fact it gives more shots when used in a gatling laser works with plasma cores as well
---
I did it pretty frequently while I was in Canada this past May. Played from my laptop in Alberta while Playstation was at home in Georgia. It has to be on the same wifi the first time they sync together.
---
And the Launcher still can't launch the game. Telling me that the first installation of the game can't be finished.
---
Always have to go via the .exe file

Checking in 1300!
---
I’m more concerned about the building ones, and acquiring wood. 7600 wood chops is nothing to sneeze at either!
---
Honestly with my setup this game takes almost no usage from it.
---
GPU and CPU usage is pretty low.
---
Even on ultra the game has some washed out textures but it is definitely a big upgrade.
---
A friend showed me how he plays the game and the low textures on prints and ads etc isnt even readable most of the time
---
I miss how stable it was then, sure it crashed frequently, but at least the server ran smoother and there was less lag!
---
Thought the scorchbeast following was a rare bug guess not
---
I want to gather community opinions without having to hunt down players in game to ask them (half of them don't have mics). I'm making a video on Fallout 76 a year later, and wanted to get a LOT of perspective from various players who've been through the bad, but also the good. I made sure that people put into a "use my opinion" part so they understand I may or may not use their thoughts in a video.
---
Never seen it or plasma.  You obviously can corner the market!
---
They never like admitting they don't know what they are doing.
---
I modded Skyrim, I don’t think the Creation Kit is able to do that because of pathfinding.
---
But yeah, this game needs dungeons badly, not just for nuke zones though, Skyrim has a smaller map with way more dungeons.
---
According to the challenges I haven’t discovered several locations that I have visited several times and are blue fast-travel icons on my map...
---
Also, the “take photos at Red Rockets” and the “Craft chems” dailies recently were bugged: took photos at 12 RR to get it to count the five needed, and no matter how many Psycho I crafted it kept telling me to craft Psycho.
---
Anyone else felt a little surreal going back to f4 and fast traveling to diamond city and seeing all the npcs?
---
Yea its great. But that was the whole point of my post. Rifles only downside is their weight. They get to benefit from every damage, stagger, cripple, vats, sneak and crit perks you can snag. They have make next to no sacrafices  other than weight, and the OP wanted that reduced. Like you gotta give a little somewhere, can't have everything. I used pistols as an example becauase their class specific perks are about useless. They don't need weight reduce, their hipfire is already good, the cripple chance is so low unless you use automatics, you have to choose between damage or sneak skills, no AP skills, and running speed perk doesn't stack with speed demon ,the list goes on....
---
lol they were both learned instantly but yea if i ever find another
---
It was a hugely popular phrase among The Greatest Generation after they returned from The War.
---
That's the hope. I want it to be Fallout 76 v.2.4.1, though. The bugs are going to be legendary on release
---
Oh damn that's probably why then thanks for mentioning. This is bigly news. Yuge, and I'm not being sarcastic despite the vernacular
---
Insert *I'm doing my part!* meme
---
It will take most regular daily players around 10 years to complete that one. Definitely should be a better reward than merely 20 Atoms!
---
I remember a week from now was supposed to be the first PC beta test, that was then pushed back another week. Damn I was so pissed during that week XD, but felt good to finally play it for the first time, and with extra hours too.
---
Depends on your build. For legs I always do calibrated shocks. For a bloodied build emergency protocols on chest is awesome. Helmet I like targeting hud
---
They fixed it. Had someone tried me for a few minutes last night and I have charged and unstable. The mutations went off multiple times and it never started pvp. He tried using deathclaw gauntlet and tried using a buzz blade.
---
Eventually I got annoyed and blasted him with my laser and he came back as a stealth boy tesla prick -.- still kicked his ass tho
---
I just can't anymore lol.
---
The encounter can happen anywhere, but the note and holotape do refer to a specific bunker.
---
This is amazing, did it have its own thread?
---
In my time zone, my regular playtime coincides with US overnight — there’s hardly ever anyone around to worry about.

The frigging bloom wont let me take it.... :(

Why?  Its a secondary challenge.  It requires you do nothing but log in and stay logged in.
---
Calibrated shocks both L &amp; R
---
Torso- the one to increase strength 
---
Helm - one to increase intel (when scrapping it will help assist in learning new mods)
---
Arms mod to help AP
---
Somebody had some kind of voice modulator tuned up to sugar cute bunny voice at SBQ over the weekend, and provided color commentary during all three events on that server. It was pretty funny.
---
They said “Oh no I gots the rattle hands” with a Chicago accent and a sky high Disney cartoon pitch, and that got me LOLing.
---
A couple days earlier it was some dude trying to initiate PvP by punching everyone endlessly at SBQ. N bombs and homophobic slurs left and right until someone got tired of the nonsense and wiped him out with a legacy laser rifle.
---
Sometimes I want a private server, but then I’d never be entertained by unexpected bunnies with rattle hands.
---
Xbox live had an issue as well as Xbox console update not installing for many.
---
LOL! Yeah no prob! I was up there for 3 weeks so I did lots of testing at home playing around town before I left, lol. Once it's synced up successfully and it learns what the PS4's home network IP or whatever is then it's good to go. IIRC when you're on a different wifi network it'll say it's checking the local network but if it can't find your PS4 then it'll automatically check online for it.
---
Used my own on my smartphone.
---
Tip for getting wood easily: equip the Woodchucker perk, and go to Pricketts Fort. There is this massive pile of wood that can give around 200 wood. Go to Helvetia, and you’ll find a smaller, but similar wood pile near the restaurant.
---
But who are you? What other work have you done? You should introduce yourself when soliciting opinions for a project like this.
---
Hahaha. You can tell people are getting bored around here and just waiting for the dlc
---
I configured mine, targeting hud, core assembly, hydraulic bracers (great for mining ore) and of course cal shocks.
---
Outer Worlds is a non-open world RPG and like most Obsidian games, will be beatable in 10 or so hours easily. No reason anyone will be playing it till Wastelanders comes out in November.
---
&lt;insert Gru meme&gt;
---
It's very possible, we're probably already halfway there and will fully make it before the time is up. Over the weekend, we raised it significant, so I'm sure we can do a few more
---
Probably fairly significant but rumor is that Outer Works is a fairly short game.  I’ve heard 15-40 hours for a play through.
---
I for one will be giving it a try.
---
I will for sure be checking out of 76.  I've played this game into the ground.  Currently level 535 and have been basically bored with it for quite a while.  I keep playing because I've got family across the country that is into it and it's a good game to socialize with my sister and her kids over, but I've been waiting for OW to come out.  I do look forward to the future updates, but I've got so much inventory that there are literally zero items left that I'm searching for and I've done everything there is to do dozens, if not hundreds, of times.
---
10 DAYS!? My frikn playstation store said it releases next year! Count me in!
---
Maybe 7600 atoms?
---
Thats over lvl 100
---
I can't prove it but I seemed to get diseases more often.
---
If you're on xbox, I'll fuck up some a holes.. Pm me.
---
Great to have you on board!
---
If Wastelanders gets delayed into next year probably a lot.
---
There isn't a legitimate weapon in the game that doesn't require a legendary effect to make it effective.  
---
Legendaries IS the game.  Beginning Game.  Mid Game.  End Game.
---
If the game sucks for new players ...... there is no end game cause no one gets there.
---
Yes
---
I have a strong love-hate relationship with it. My wife and I play together and it’s definitely way better with a team.
---
this made me laugh so hard.  "like, one had an aneurysm, one shot himself by mistake and the third drowned -- these don't count, sorry."
---
I lost count but I just kept server hopping the morgan town airport and got a lot of kills
---
Just saw this.. So my reply is moot. But I get it... I'll shove a can of dog food up a raiders ass.. I don't care.. Just a bunch of snooty, entitled, rich folk either way... Go back to the Top of the World where you belong!
---
I would love it to be for fresh, new characters only.
---
Awh &lt;3
---
My point stands.  Their is no PLACE to find legendaries.  ONE singular event to gives a lvl 10-15 single star, that makes you run over the whole forest just to get that lv10 wooden leg isn't a LOCATION .... you changed the subject to event.
---
This is precisely why I don't bother with this kind of trading unless I'm trading for caps. It really sucks. I loved trading in TF2 before its economy went to crap, and would love if this game used that same simple trade confirmation system you posted.
---
Yep my bad didn't read it well.
---
Awe man you gota try it some time, just slug a nuka shine and have a contest with some buddies to see who can pick up the most. Whenever you wake up from your stupor, just slug back another and let the good times roll! You guys could even throw in on a pot for the winner.
---
I'll still log on for challenges and grabbing atom shop deals, but Outer Worlds is made by the people who made the best Fallout  games so...
---
Oh god, That crap made me move my camp haha I had it near the golf resort as some do and every time a robot started firing, the noise would never stop.
---
RWA armor does not effect mini nukes, 40mm grenades, or missiles
---
Very good strategy. I server hop near fissure sites.
---
Wow you really hate obsidian that much huh? Well have fun wallowing in your puddle of hate. The rest of us are going to play it with an open mind see where it takes us.
---
Is that the key card one?
---
It’s not meant to encourage you to log in and do nothing for hours, which people would do for 760 atoms.  It is just a way for you to track your time in game.
---
Not really. If 2 friends are wanting s workshop, do you really think only 1 would attack it while the other justs hangs out and watches?
---
I've noticed less legendary enemies too.  But if not getting enough for scrips is your problem then try doing more events.
---
No, it’s terrible. Go away and never post here again!
---
this
---
im just going to travel the high seas if you know what i mean
---
I have seen it shared in market subreddit, some time ago, I think it was written for there. Initially I didn't much pay attention to it since it was about farming different stuff and I just pick up everything so don't really need to farm anything.
---
But later I saw it on Sinseers website and paid more attention to those item respawn limits. Which I guess will take more time before they are common knownleadge.
---
I’m on PC, I wouldn’t mind a little workshop pvp revenge (I’m only like level 70 something though) edit my ign is the same as my reddit
---
New age wave of everyone having their own launcher and stores
---
The guitar and trumpet can be found on a bus north westish of cranberry glade. From spawn point follow the path away from glade and theres a grey bus guitar is in the back seat and trumpet is on one on the passenger side
---
What’s the setting needed?
---
Why would I hate Obsidian? I've played almost all Obsidian titles in recent times and I find them mediocre, so I don't expect OW to be some brilliant masterpiece, especially with their current team. They were always shit at coding, they had a good writer team during NV but that team is now gone too, leaving Obsidian with just, well, a shit coding team.
---
I have an explosive unltracife laser. It’s worth about 250 caps
---
I can see this, could be a good thing though
---
I'll buy that, you on xbox? Gt Hurtfulfriend0
---
bitch I know. I said in the post I don't care about losing the workshop.
---
They were dicks about it.
---
Oh yeah, I wasn't even thinking about the respawn limits. Just sometimes when I'm building in camp I run out of something weird and now I know where to find it. I've actually just started bulking all my junk and selling most of it
---
No. Did yall read the post? I dont care that they took it, they were just assholes about it. And I want to be petty.
---
Internethistorian biter.
---
I might have a extra. On PS4
---
Or the trolls who just go around trying to initiate PvP or even while building workshops, so you abandon it and go to another workshop, and they follow just to start PvP with a player, those trolls that follow you to different servers. Is where this would work the best because they are just out to start fights when most other players in the server are just doing their own things (mostly farming when our builds are set for farming scraping and building), then there is the times where we swap out builds for PvP, I'd personally enjoy this because it allows more PvP based on a fraction you choose, let's say wastelanders is a hit not a crash and allows the choice to live a raiders lifestyle where you are always an enemy of the responders, BOS, that would be nice and amazing. If not a karma system based of the NPCs and other players would be a good idea.
---
....I dont think you know your stuff. there are only very select places above the nipples that would be fatal.
---
Fallout conditions....yeah, you would probably die from being shot anywhere.
---
Executioners Laser Pistol
---
The only thing I can think of is the mod. Never seen a plan for it
---
This lol. Obsidian has tried so hard to manage peoples' expectations about Outer Worlds. It's not gonna be a hundred hour Bethesda style open world with dynamic NPC schedules and hundreds of locations.
---
For Outer Worlds, I expect an RPG with a good story, funny dialog, a few too many long exposition dumps, combat about as okay as Fallout 4, choices that range from good to evil to cartoonishly evil, and an unfortunate amount of bugs. And I expect to have a great time with it.
---
Thank you. Nice resource!
---
I can mod it for the cost of mats
---
Me and my crew killed 67 scorched beast today so far, gotta keep chugging along.
---
If on ps
---
That's still more than I make in a year
---
Fine with me. Gives me the 0.75lb back I need to fast travel to my camp and piss around with the stash for 8 minutes.
---
I brought my crossbow and 11 bolts and killed 11 of them. You're welcome.
---
This sounds pretty great!
---
im on xbox but you know what? im dumb. i guess one of the gatlings i scrapped unlocked it for me 🤦🏻‍♂️ i double checked and just saw it

Kill the sentry's at white springs they're almost guaranteed to drop a charged fusion core
---
welll obsdian signed the agreement. people who even worked on nv said it was fair and it's there fault that the game was buggy as hell on launch date and still is.
---
Well that is a hidden mechanic, they should state at the top left that I am fed or something not just a 'hurt' animation with no message.
---
Thank you.
---
The Vault Raid is the ONLY piece of content added to this game that I don't like. The cost vs reward is laughable. Why nerf the hell out of the XP? You don't get stronger past level 50, it just gives you more diversity and options. Either give me normal XP gains or change the neverending spawn design. Make it somewhat worth my time, not a resource drain with no reward. I would literally rather do anything else in the game than Vault Raids.
---
Haven't played Rage 1, I'd say Borderlands type.
---
I kill everything on the ground attacking players, I then farm raw material to make stable flux. I get a few shots on the Queen but the bigger fight is all the enemies helping her. 
---
Flux from the Queen is only a few of them, not even worth a 5 minute fight. Want a lot? Farm materials like high radiation fluid and hardened/glowing mass which doesn’t expire and then when someone else launches go for raw flux! Boom you’ll have a ton of flux with right perk cards!
---
THANK YOU &lt;3
---
I think I saw them in whitesprings cunningham the mister gusty
---
It's a 50% off purveyor sale, with 100% more likely nocturnal and stalker drops according to Bethesda. Getting ready for Wastelanders new meta of pitch black vats weapons.
---
What's that? Eh?
---
I can't hear you over the gunfire from this shrub.
---
Karma for nuking the golf course instead of prime.
---
And they're still  pondering the lessons to this day...
---
Game is so frustrating w/o the legendaries.  Before level 40, the only weapon of value I had was a lv20 TS Combat rifle, .... then they nerfed ALL the TS weapons to rid themselves of the TSE duplicates .... and I got a Quad Assault Rifle at that point ....
---
W/O legendary effects, everything is a bullet sponge.  Makes Melee the only option.
---
I found a few in lucky hole mine and at blackwater mine.
---
Yet still so many things wrong. Still waiting for no cap limit and script limit for players and vendors. Also a stash increase and all general bugs and crash issues that are still in the game. There's many things that could be improved.
---
NEW VIDEO COMING SOON!
---
You will interact with players via NPC Vendors, Player shops, Events, Nuke Zones, and random encounters in the world. You don't have to fight anyone, or even say hello. You can ignore them completely if you choose, unless you steal or use a workshop PvP zone.
---
If you've got plenty in Strength, I highly suggest speccing into some Unarmed/Melee perks. I run a Bloodied/Unyielding Unarmed Sneak build with one rank of Enforcer and I manage to take the SBQ down in 15 seconds from spawn to death (includes getting it to land with a shotgun).
---
I wish those caps would just go into the robovendors cap stash, same with the sales tax caps.
---
Atomic shop item for 1800 atoms...lol (only kidding)
---
Wastelanders will bring all manners of new bugs to find. It's like a mini-game!
---
I'm not necessarily against companies doing their own launchers.  After all, with 76, we have to go through Bethesda's launcher.  But we're relying on their online component anyway, so it's not really an enormous leap to rely on their launcher.
---
With Outer Worlds, a game with no such dependency, they decided to make Epic their middleman.  Yes, there's Microsoft too, but the Windows Store is a total disaster.  I don't like Epic as a company, let alone their hardball approach to exclusives, and Obsidian/Take-Two are basically telling me that my money isn't good enough for them and to come back in a year.  Well, screw that.  Why should I have to jump through hoops for the "privilege" of paying them money?  This is a buyer's market, and there are countless other games competing for my time and attention.
---
Fair point.  Everyone else on the server was like level 60 and below.  Just imagined I'd be the only one to show up to Prime.
---
Everyone gonna go stealth night builds
---
Oh yeah, my go to guy is a good friend of mine and is always super clean. He prefers doing realistic images but takes even the most simple design super seriously.
---

Why sb? Why not do what i did and nuke fissure omega and kill the reg scorched? Faster body count. Im at like 323 scorched bagged and tagged in the past 3-4 hrs. Im just tryna get the sale
---
For the wolf horde boss that's the case, but for any other? I've never noticed that before the past week and I don't think you're correct. I'll Pay attention to where it's happening though from now on. Maybe though! They do excel at making dumb decisions like that.
---
Build your character to solo the queen and it never matters who else is there. 😁

So they up the reward, then what?  Its still a secondary challenge...for atoms...to trade for cosmetic items.

Infinite spawns either can't spawn legendary, or there's a limit on how many can per encounter (which should probably just be one at the beginning so that people aren't tricked into trying to farm it).

They are under Aid.   Your results may vary, obviously.

They weren't able to keep pushing the release back due to money issues.

I haven't found a reason to jump back in. Last time I played was the first time Meat Week happened and the event failed twice. Haven't tried the raid or anything else since.

Made a trade today with a random, told him if he could find me a Furious Explosive .50 Cal I'd trade him my AAE Gatling Plasma....he messaged me today and told me he found it. Trade went totally fine, but my weapon was worth way more than the Furious .50.... Made him sell for $0, before putting the AAE Gatling Plasma up for $0. We are both a little happier and trust was certainly built with that trade.
---
He wants my Bloodied Explosive Tesla now, told him to find me a Plasma Grenade Plan and we have a deal, he was thrilled even tho that particular plan is Damn near impossible to find. We will see how much he wants this BE Tesla... To be continued.

&gt;What bothers me the most is the fact that Bethesda are perfectly OK with releasing something so broken. It appears like this company does not have any quality control and release whatever they are working on, as soon as it reaches the point where it is just barely playable. This is unacceptable. I love the Fallout franchise so much and I have been so disappointed with Bethesda this last year. What happened, Todd?
---
Couldn't have said it better myself.

Turn on passive mode you’ll never be pvped again unless someone on your team doesn’t have it on and gets engaged then you’ll be engaged. If passive is on even a wanted guy who hits you and your electrically charged goes off it won’t matter, but if you are not you’re going to get yourself griefed

The theory is that it happens when you don't do enough damage to her.

One player (ID not included) came up to me while I was loading stuff into my merch, started firing at me to aggro, I ignored, went upstairs to work on stuff, he crouched and went chameleon and wandered into a corner.  Next I know rads are spiking.  I don't know what /exactly/ he was doing, but I wandered down and he was running off down the road.
---
Second time, diff server, same day, another player (diff player ID) comes by, and starts shooting at my CAMP (high traffic area, it goes with the territory).  He dropped something (not sure what) but ended up getting wanted.  He was level ~200 something, and as I aimed at him he was running a bloodied build.  I am in pacifist mode, so I just logged off the server.
---
Call it whatever you want, but two times on sunday dill-weeds were harassing.  I don't know if there is a legit way of doing something like this, or if a bunch of neanderthals just thought they'd try out things to get a rise, but it happened.

It's that one child that came out rotten compared to the others. The ugly duckling. The kid that everyone dreads that comes to the same parties as straight A kids. The parents barely paid attention to this child as it was learning to be itself. It doesn't listen to us. It would rather punish us for entertainment than try to improve itself. But as fallout fans and fans of the community we put up with it in the hopes that it will be just as good as the others. 
---
The game should have been aborted and tried again, Im sorry not sorry. 
---
(Yeah you can use my content)
---
Make your camp more useful though?
---
I'd trade the usefulness of the power plant for the usefulness of my camp
---
Do all the ones that spawned in and then immediately dropped dead count? I mean, technically, my server-hopping DID kill them...
---
Are you saying that it is not challenging trying to find all the missing enemies?
---
Yup
---
Keep up the good work, friend.
---
All Bethesda games are like that. Shit, Fallout 4 was released 3 months after it was announced with little more than a couple of trailers.
---
I already know
---
Use advanced connectors to punch through ceilings with wires to create seamless lines in an idle corner of a C.A.M.P.
---
Same with a wire that's obscene and in your face, try to experiment with running wires on exterior foundations or using advanced connector pipes to span a shadowed walk way. 
---
If you're on PS4 I'll show you my C.A.M.P. build and my gf's. Both have multiple inputs from both of us and have these points of interest.
---
At QuakeCon they said that NPCs will talk to the team leader and the team leader will guide the conversations for the group.
---
Technically not true.  Also, if left up to introverts society would never happen.  We would be a bunch isolated individuals nodding at each other occasionally.  Than, after two weeks of not noticing, someone goes missing we might ask another isolated person we barely know if they heard something.
---
Thanks
---
In short, yes.
---
I played it from the day it came out until early February. At the time, I enjoyed it in spite of the many issues. If I wasn't such a big Fallout fan I wouldn't have even bothered putting up with the issues. Behind all the bugs and whatnot you could see the framework of a good game, but nonetheless I stopped playing it for several months. I would have given it a 4.5/10.
---
I picked it up again a few weeks ago and I haven't put it down since. It's not without its flaws and it can still improve in so many more ways, but it's legitimately a good game now and should only improve with the Wastlanders update upcoming (read up on it if you don't know about it yet, big takeaway is there will be NPC humans and compansions ala previous Fallouts).
---
So many quality of live improvements have been added and server stability has improved. I've disconnected from a game only once since I've started playing again. Player vending is a great addition and the community is largely helpful and friendly. Nuculear Winter is a fun mode, similiar to Fortnite.
---
My biggest complaints as of now is the nerfed shotgun build, which sucks since my player is a shotgunner, but then again I've yet to procure any notable legendary weapons so maybe that's the problem, and the fact that I'm always, constantly buying, crafting, trading and searching for ammo which I blow thru like nothing.
---
It's finally beginning to recapture the magic that the other Fallouts had. Still a long way to go and it's certainly not without its flaws, the improvents have been fairly large as far as I'm concerned. It's clear that the game is consistently being improved, slowly but surely. A lot is riding on the upcoming Wastlanders update, and I feel it'll either make or break the game. Huge potential if doen right, but possibly a death knell if they botch it. As of right now I'd rate FO76 a 7.5/10.
---
when I was leveling my character and was doing very little damage there were times I wouldnt get drops. I think that is the issue.

No radio...and the story seems meh so far but it is free on gamepass so I will give it a go.

Wendigo Cave at LVL 18? Wow dude you are brave, kudos to you. At 18 I barely scratched the surface of TV. Didnt go to the Ash Heap till at least LVL 25 and your already grinding in the Savage Divide. Like others have said, at your LVL avoid The Mire and Cranberry Bog, your nowhere equipped to handle it... Not trying to lecture just some sound advice. A friend of mine went into the Mire at LVL 30 and was getting his ass handed to him.
---
The first time I ended up in either or those areas was The Mire at LVL 35 and it was because its where I spawned after blacking out during the Nuka Moonshine quest. I spawned in the tree fort location, found a level 50 suppressed sniper rifle but fast tracked outta there the second I could.... Wasn't about to start fighting a mob of LVL 40+ anglers and mirelurks
---
Right, Wolf horde isn't supposed to. The first part of it will spawn the three legendaries and then the second part, the fourth wolf, will never be Legendary.
---
thank you!!

There's also sometimes caps in the containers and meat bags that are submerged in there. Sometimes up to 40-60 in each container.

Thanks for the answer. Sounds like it's doing better but maybe I should wait for the Wastelanders update before I decide.

LOL we just killed 1mil dragons in ESO (in the first few days of the event... they have 14-16mil health and are like final trial bosses) and got rewards plus Bethesda/ZOS donated 200k to animal rescue charities. Who cares about Scorched, FO76 players are fucking cancer. They aren't strong as a community so as a whole failed. https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/slaydragonssavecats
---
Oh I get you now. Yeah always finish out the prescription. Just not all at once lol
---
Definitely agreed. I like to customize everything I possibly can, so it stinks I can't customize the HUD anymore.
---
So you just left your PS4 on for three weeks?
---
One character all 3* armor, one 3* melee and the other two 3* ranged.
---
&gt;this looks like the kind of thing you can fix in few hours of work.
---
I absolutely agree. I want to believe they have at least a board with a list of those things which could be taken care of just to keep the game looking not-as-beta, but... 
---
Some bugs are hard to understand. Be serious, Bethesda.
---
Honestly, joking or not I feel this way about the game. The community is awesome.

Oh boy you just signed yourself up for your post to be used as a billboard for discords

Nah, my brother and I share a PS4. He was home while I was gone. If he turned it off I would text him to turn it on for me, lol. Same if like he was playing Warframe or something, I could watch him play live and I'd either text him I wanted to get on Fo76 soon or I'd troll commentate on his gameplay lol.
---
Hey there,  I'm an Aussie too!  What platform are you on?  Please say ps4

Here's a hint. That may seem news to you but everyone on here has more experience and knowledge of the game then any YouTube click whore.

I’m just sick of everything cast in green lol
---
Also on XB1
---
Nice! I almost always play solo but if you ever see me on, join up and come visit the camp! GT is DRSTEVENSTRANGE
---
I might be, I'll have to look into more.
---
It’s definitely related to how much damage you do.  Try to target 5K damage on her per event to get loot.
---
Line in the Sand needs some Scorched legendaries. It's a fairly long event, lots of mobs, no reason it shouldn't have a chance to spawn them. I always go to AWOL because there's a guaranteed legendary in the mix.
---
16 people doing an event at once is laggy as hell I can’t wait to have 16 + companions good grief....FO4 had companions because it was a SOLO game.
---
I don’t see the game supporting companions unless they start phasing things
---
Garthin are mirelurks.
---
The problem is this
---
"There are no places to farm legendaries for low level players in the Forest."
---
The only things "low level players" should be concerned about "farming", especially in the Forest, is food and mats. They're supposed to be learning locations, tactics, crafting, and the background story.
---
The weapons and armor available are more than adequate for the enemies they are likely to encounter, they become familiar with the Perk system, and learn (usually by dying) to exercise some caution and judgment. 
---
Somehow, for a small subset of players, this game morphed into: Exit vault, power-level, acquire all mutations, apply recipe Perk build, acquire God-like weapons / armor . . . And complain about "boring" content, grinding, and no "challenge" 🙄
---
Eh I just thought it'd be cool. Maybe they could switch around the way events work, right now I know people aren't very happy with them.
---
Edit not to say just to design an entire system around dogs lol
---
I definitely turn off music and I use a headset.
---
"OP was later found dead, a result of another Fallout fan during the 2020 Apocalypse."
---
Killed her today with like 15 ppl and looted a three start bloody meat hook and then the server crashed and we all logged into a new server with no credit or loot....../sigh
---
This exactly. I remember finding a power armor frame in beta and being so excited, I took it to war over a workshop at an airport for the rest of the beta time. Even with the bugs, those were some of the best times I had with fallout.
---
I’d suggest biting the bullet and getting to 25. Ask for help at that point. Someone will craft you a full excavator armor suit. Then you can smash away. Just don’t ask me how to get to 25. I make my GF run around white springs and west trek and shoot stuff while I slaughtered it. 
---
Remember. Ask for help. Plenty of people that move to help out with stuff. I just got finished dropping a fusion generator, water pumps, excavator armor with a lvl 25 fire axe on someone. With 20 stims and rads.
---
Try it in a clown outfit and fascnacht man mask.....  I rocked that combo for a while...
---
Arnt there some chess pieces?
---
Just get it.
---
Garthin came first
---
"And when everyone's super..."
---
Just to make sure. They have a lamp on them visually. And you use your pipboy light to turn them on.
---
I suggest you take it to a armor bench and mod it with the bright light. As I've noticed some don't shine very bright.
---
Melee build.
---
I run excavator L45  with Targeting hud, optimized bracers, motion assist servos, and calibrated shocks.
---
Have configured the other PA suits the same.
---
It’s your damage. I’m telling you it’s all over the forums and Facebook.
---
Turn on damage numbers and double check. She has huge armor and unless your pushing high damage or armor pen you will be surprised.
---
What build are you? Hitting her soft but with a machine gun won’t cut it. What I tell people and it works, is get an axe or pole hook (armor pen modifier) use incisor. Power attack her.
---
Turn damage numbers on and check first. You have to do substantial damage to her, you can’t just tag her anymore.

Thats what I did @ Poseidon until I made about L20.

Remote Play can wake your PS4 from “Rest mode”

“R-Play” a different remote play app, can play over cellular if that’s something you ever wanted to do too.

Or mass spontaneous death upon spawning. Had a whole camp of scorched  appear fall over dead when I fast travelled in. Creepy to hear all those death sounds. Kept thinking "what terrible unseen creature of the wastes killed all these scorched at once?"
---
The game is expected to drastically change and be different after wastelandwrs. I suggest to anyone gone a while to just keep waiting. It sounds like their vision is changing 180
---
Yeah no wonder I was getting so frustrated with the sheer gap in levels, I’ll be sure to stick somewhere closer to my skill level from now on, thanks for the advice I appreciate it
---
Yup they are good for this week
---
Thanks so much!!
---
I would like to be able to plant anything. Like perhaps in a planter? Idk. Theres too much to venture all over to farm for and the respawning time for camp veggies are quicker than in the world. It seems... the things inside my camp that aren't my produce stays vacant for a longer time than what I've grown myself.
---
I’m saying we are gonna get it regardless, it’s just a ploy to up their numbers. They’ll only be hurting themselves by failing us since I’m sure a lot of people have been playing their asses off for this.
---
You're being a bit hard on the boy, Ward.
---
While you do get xp in adventure mode from Nuclear Winter, it is by no means a way to power lvl.
---
Since they made changes to the events system, You can now travel to a world event for free without fear of losing your junk if you die.   So, you can farm high level events without much worry and score some cheap exploration xp in the process.
---
All that was pregen. They did it from parts but it was hand made

Yikes

You have it all backwards. These people are the griefers building up workshops with locked extractors and making them so expensive to claim. It hurts me deeply, right in the feels.

I did Monster Mash with a similar kind of griefer today after starting this very thread. The griefer showed up wanting nothing to do with PvP. He even called me names when I shot at him while he was wearing the mask.

Absolutely.  I’m a nomad in WVA and if I see some one I’ll run up to them, give them a bottle of whiskey and a pack of cigarettes and be on my way.  As the great Harry Dean Stanton said,; “there’s a difference between being alone and lonely.”
---
Don’t they reset on Tuesday? Because I didn’t have to re enter any codes today while playing, just scanned my card.
---
To the guy I met that day, the one who genuinely talked to me like it was real life: Thank you. I never forgot you and how we discovered our first watchtower together, how we bid farewell to each other after just an hour or two, feeling like a lifetime. You showed me so early the greatness that a game can bring, the friendships. I will never, ever forget you.
---
They reset at 12pm est on mondays
---
Oh ok...that makes sense.
---
I had an accidental factory reset on my PS4 so I post the cherished photos of the guy I met that day. Never got his psn, so that hurt.
---
Try the farming method next time. Tag the boss but kill all others. The others will be replaced by new, high level enemies and often times they are legendaries. I assume it to still work as long as you don’t kill the boss.
---
I mean sure, don’t get me wrong i would loveee to be able to do that in my camp but that makes 3 locations that also happen to be workshops completely pointless to visit. Workshops are been less and less used due to fear of pvp, better grinding alternatives and disconnecting so making 3 of the most still viable ones to take useless it kinda hurts the world.
---
It’s a newish bug
---
Maybe a survival mode of some kind :/
---
Going AFK doesn’t count as a glitch
---
Oh you're so funny...
---
Enemies spawn at your camp when you or someone fast travels to it. It's a conscious design choice, probably to keep you on alert.
---
For me the easiest way to earn xp on a lower level character was to grind the events in the forest, toxic valley, and the ash heap. Just server hop if you aren't seeing any.
---
Hey, if we're fixing that, a retroactive count of recipes and plans learned would be swell... I learned too many before teh challenge was invented and now?

Impossible to finish. :(
---
Check out The Dark Crystal.
---
Great idea!! Thanks for the tip! We are all for the sale also.
---
There’s already a fix in-game, shoot the sentry bot until it explodes. The sound bug will then be removed from the game for approximately 30 minutes.
---
I'm just waiting for a quest giver's head to start spinning 360 degrees while maintaining eye contact.
---
I too love my flaming chainsaw.
---
I have some pretty good recent photos of some but certainly not as prevalent at launch.
---
Get a mix of Chameleon and Vanguard prefix armor.  Preferably heavy Combat Armor or Scout Armor. If you can get Sentinel or Cavalier, that’s awesome, AP regen is great too.  That’s basically it.
---
I’m thinking maybe your camp was near one of the Prime Meat event sites.. these sites were all over the map and occurred every fifteen minutes as an aside to the main Meet Week event. In some places it would be Yao Guai, in the Bog it would be Fog Crawlers and yes, in the Ash Heap it would be radscorpions and a Sheepsquatch.
---
Yep, lacks the ability to invite frienss though
---
Just happened to me right at the end 2nd time in two nights . Just won't let me respawn.  I quit and joined on a recent player got back and the as I body was empty also the 3 star gusty I lit up a bunch.  So ok frustrating I'm level 310 and put a lot of time in this game . Wish the makers wound also put in a little more effort.  Also 50 per cent of time in hitting a 3 star it's crashes makes the worst noise and quits out . If lost out on over 100 3 star drops this way . It's like the game can't process my damage output and just fails.
---
12 hours later it still says 33.48%. I think the page is bugged or just people in this thread care/ are trying.

Best for pve is still the same, bloody TSE. For pvp I'd say FFR and AA are the best. And end game is still the same, tho now with the legendary vendor you can sell some less desirable legendaries and get some currency to get a roll at the vendor
---
Fixer should go for a solid 15k my man, FN items idk but i'd go with 5k each at least
---
Nah you can garuntee super high kevels like that have used the early xp glitches
---
Im not a console pleb, sorry
---
They want to play the game and dont want to be bothered while doing it, but have no options to play on their own so they are doing what they can to create the environment they desire. Literally shoot them for being introverted right?
---
Lol yeah np. It does say scorched thats why. They fixed the typo. So just sharing knowledge!
---
what is ffr and aa. also i thought before you couldn't get a bloody 2 shot explosive you had to choose between bloody or two shot
---
Survival only really added PvP challenge though. Not pve
---
They want to play the game alone but have no options to do so, screw them for trying to make things more enjoyable for themselves right?
---
TSE is definitely not the best.  TSE is mediocre at best for most builds. The are much better builds depending on what you want to do, like a stealth/vats build sniper using an Instigating Lever Action Rifle. 
---
TSE will never be the best weapon for any build, there’s always a better option.
---
I doubt it. He’s usually at least mildly stoned.
---
Faster fire rate and anti armor, and You are right. It was bloody explosive not TS
---
God that was a miserable week. Pre order the game only for Bethesda to botch the shipping so it was delivered late and I couldnt play. And there wasn't even an actual disk with it, just had to dl...
---
Correction there is no "human NPCs"
---
[removed]
---
ok cool so my bloody explosive double barrel is still good?
---
O H   G O D
---
My soul applauds you.
---
Fair point, guess I haven't played range in a little while
---
LOL.
---
Imagine if you and those good players had something fun and rewarding to do :)
---
I thought this as well as it is rather annoying to see the same post about that.
---
Should be, tho shotguns did get nerfed when it comes to explosive legendary modifier so there might be better options
---
Bloodied has had four stealth nerfs since March of this year. Just letting you know. I run bloodied builds, we aren't doing anywhere near the damage that we use to, to the point that junkies is actually a better idea as a damage dealer. Bloodied was always to be a glass cannon with high dps but they continually lower the damage output of bloodied.
---
does explosive still scale with the skill or was that nerfed?
---
Its broken until they fix it.  Submit a ticket.
---
They reset on Tuesday at 8pm eastern time.
---
Yea I mean everytime I pull up the sub I see 1 or 2 of these posts!!! It’s crazy. I got tired of chiming in after the 30th time with my same input so I just scroll past. But I feel like maybe they really are curious so maybe there could be a post at the top with opinions on the current game, or something along those lines.
---
I am basically a PA/Heavy Gun build but have a nice 63 dmg Serrated Combat Knife that is deadly with the Gladiator and Make Shift Warrior Perk cards and a hit of Fury.
---
Appalachia appreciates your service!
---
Ok...thanks for that...by the way, saw your video on that fast sbq kill...fricken awesome👍👍
---
946?! highest I’ve seen is 200
---
It has to be manually updated by some intern or something.
---
And I thank you.
---
I really enjoy the classical music station. You sort of tune it out, but it can definitely add another layer to the gameplay for me. Especially if it starts getting dramatic during a fight.
---
I do remember there being a nuke zone at white springs. It’s still just ridiculous that us, the players, have to find workarounds for a game to work as intended.
---
Straight up drop rate? Extremely rare
---
I completely agree.  I was just looking yesterday and there was too many.  Making a general forum with feedback for that constent question to pin would be nice.  
---
Thinking ask the moderators and tell em to check out your post here.  I was thinking for this in the skyrim forum as well as the same thing happens there its just getting on my nerves lately but I am easily irritated lol.
---
I wish I wasnt lazy enough so I could make a meme using the template of the guy shoving a stick in his own bicycle spokes and then being pissed that he crashed.
---
If they dont want PvP, wouldn't you think the best thing to do would be to not do things that are tied to PvP?
---
Actually I just shared this in the skyrim one as you phrased it very well.  So thank you.
---
You know there is an option in settings now to turn off all world radios. They added it because youtubers were having copyright issues.
---
If you cry hard enough, maybe they"ll give you a participation trophy. Grow a pair. We'll either get it or we won't. Who cares?
---
Maybe if it gains some traction I will message a mod. Honestly wasn’t sure if I was the only one that noticed this trend! Lol
---
Your welcome! Lol
---
Drop monster hunter for something better i would say
---
Oh you didnt between here and the skyrim sub reddit i see over 20 of the same post which is irritating.
---
I always just research a game if i am interested, look up some videos, and check out these reddit forums.  Thats why i picked up fo76 reading everything here made my thoughts solid on it.
---
I turn the music completely off for most games. I usually use headphones for this one, and the ambient sounds are like being outside in the woods. 10/10 sound immersion
---
Then you should nuke the place before you go there.
---
If I leave delta free of rads to be able to go without PA and I die there I should spawn there, not by the fissure prime and with not enough time to even put on my hazmat, pipboy wont react.
---
I've always turned off the radios I find and in game music!
---
I've seen them occasionally inside Poseidon energy plant. The drop lvl 5 legendary.
---
Screw us for wanting to use workshops the way they were intended right? Screw us for wanting to enjoy ourselves yeah? All because some snowflake wants to have an unrealistic view of how special they should be treated? You can dress it up any way you want but it still boils down to a simple reality: want to be left alone, don't touch workshops.
---
Oh jeez. Just kill mole miners and scrap their gear.
---
Don’t know why my build makes me dumb. As I’ve stated I went in on NOVICE, and everybody I’ve talked to about it has stated that novice is very soloable. If the mission wasn’t slow af, I would’ve been just fine.
---
Any idea if doing events in the forest will increase the drop rate?
---
Extremely rare. I spent months running forest events, and never found one. I ended up buying 2 of them through the market.
---
The black market? D:
---
 [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events) 
---
We have until tomorrow to complete it.
---
The event ended yesterday the 14th
---
NE of house of scares but be sure to kill honeybeasts first. 
---
See them at dolly sods and a few other campground type spots at times but the NE place I believe is only guaranteed spawn.
---
Nope, just solo.
---
Yeah buddy I think you're in a different time zone than me Where I'm not it is the 15
---
Thanks, come by for your pharmaceutical needs if you’re on PS
---
My bloodied build has worked wonders at everything else in the game so I figured this wouldn’t be different, and tbh if the terminals were faster and actually let me leave them when I’m spamming exit, then I would’ve been okay. I was 1 hitting every enemy.
---
First I have to say I love the tone of your videos, I know I'm always in for something funny and good natured when you make a fo76 video.
---
I've been playing since launch and I have nearly 2k hours in game. I've explored nearly every aspect of the game except NW because I really don't like 3rd person pvp and NW doesn't have separate first person or third person matches.
---
I enjoy the game and I still play almost daily, but that's because of the friends I've made on discord. 
---
My number 1 requested feature is to add a 10 second delay when someone wants to claim an owned workshop. Instant death at workshops needs to stop, people need to have a chance to defend or leave the pvp zone. It's incredibly unfair that an invader can be in your workshop zone and be completely safe until he decides it's the right moment to hit claim and fire off a cheap shot. With a delay, workshop trolling is completely eliminated and new players can use workshops without risking instant unavoidable death to former survival mode players. 
---
The biggest bug fix that the game needs is the friends list. It's almost impossible to add new friends, I rarely get it working even if I restart everything. This game is much better with friends and it's really a shame that I can't play again with new friends unless they get invited to the discord server I am on and another friend with better friends list luck manages to add them.
---
Feel free to put me in a video :)
---
Yup, just have to destroy him and the 50 Mr. Handy robots with him. Rofl.
---
Fine with me
---
I think you're in a different time zone than me  Where I'm at it just became the 15th
---
uhh... Look at the top of the page.
---
Ah sorry didn't realize it was so late already. They said they will update it one last time later today.
---
Ok cool thank you
---
Yeah and everytime I hoped the airdrop event popped up and now in stacked on aid items
---
I insist everyone get a chainsaw upon reaching level 20 and proceed to teach other vault dwellers the importance of cardio.
---
I was there.
---
In a lot of ways, I miss those 2 hour windows. It made the game feel like an event.
---
If you want many Bloatfly Glands, invest in the Bloatfly Syringer mod. Very very useful if you want to not have to go server jumping to get what you want.
---
Didn’t see this till now, gamertag is same as my name here. Even in the current state, I do still want to try and complete all the missions eventually. So hit me up if you are interested. Thanks.
---
expect v2.0.1b to come out 5 hours later.
---
Never needed one
---
I had planned on it once I got enough of them, then I was gonna sell syringers too
---
Lol, I died at the voting section while stuck in a terminal for approximately 30 seconds. Nothing I could’ve done. The hate towards bloodied builds in honestly mind-boggling. Yeah they are very powerful, but they are in the game. Sorry.
---
Make a bloatfly syringer! Pretty soon you’ll have all the bloat flies you can manage plus plenty of meat!
---
It basically walks you to each step. I never needed one
---
Raiders represent!

&gt; There isn’t really an agreement on what the transgender flag is
---
this is the most commonly accepted and used trans flag
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_flags#/media/File:Transgender_Pride_flag.svg
---
Don't worry, maybe they'll have a 50 GB Day 1 patch like the original
---
I'm pretty sure those posts or some of them are bethesda employees or mods promoting the game on an endless level...
---
It's happening more and more often nowadays because veteran players can solo the SBQ and only slow down their dps enough to let the members of their own group get hits in before they kill her. The SBQ is far too weak for  veterans and still impossibly hard for newbies. There needs to be an absolute damage cap or a limit to buff stacking in adventure, it's far too easy to make a melee character that can hit for 10k+ per hit while ranged characters are hitting for 50dmg a hit.
---
It gets asked more than anything. So much so I came up with a nice copy/paste. In fact I almost posted it in response to this thread by accident lol
---
I'm anti-melee, so that's just my opinion. If it's novice it makes sense. I was just pointing out the point you made about the game being slow
---
No never had to unless I am drunk lol. The only time I kind of in game cheated was when the game would disconnect me a few times through doing the last brotherhood quest so I was pissed off at wasting so much time and resources that I just looked it up that I can fast travel to the glassed cavern and finish it that way instead of the game not saving my progress per step. Let me just say that as a casual player, having me repeat the steps to kill sb over and over again drains my resources too much and I can't proceed without grinding to get back to being able to do boss fights.
---
**Guide to Returning** pinned to top of r/fo76 page.
---
Oh damn that’s a good idea! I didn’t even think of that.
---
You’re entitled to your opinion. The point of my post wasn’t even about builds or difficulty. It was about the lag and bugs, which thankfully we agree about.
---
He said bloody TSE, you can't have bloody and TS. A lot of people accidentally say TSE when they just mean E. Except for PvP, E is still the highest damage second roll, even a little better than ffr
---
I'm not disagreeing that it sucks but all the events work the same way and I don't see them changing it. It's why I don't even bother with the queen much because I have to put on power armor and switch my bloody rifleman to a half assed heavy weapon build.
---
So you don't find that the game constantly fails to walk you to the next step?
---
When I'm in a building (which is a separate zone), I am never told where to go in the building.  There is supposed to be a quest marker pointing where to go, but they never appear.  So I have to search the entire building looking, but what happens if I can't find it?  If I exit the game and come back, I'll have to do the entire thing again.  So I go to a walkthrough.
---
Do your quest markers appear when you're in a building?
---
SAVED! thanks for this buddy! Lol
---
They also spawn by Gilman lumber mill
---
I don't understand why I was downvoted?
---
Some bugs made me look for help. For example, SPOILER BEGINS when I was doing Mayor for a day, the game did not recognize the keycards and passwords I had, even when I had collected the ones with the item quest icon and some other ones, just in case. There WAS a bug there. 
---
Sometimes, closest access points contradict themselves and a door is the suggested entrance and exit in an endless loop. 
---
I have lots of Fallout gaming years, but I can see some people getting lost and frustrated with issues like those.
---
I've actually recently gotten bored of the game and started a new character with Melee to give it a try. Unfortunately I suck at Melee builds so he's more of a quick- and auto-heal because I take so much damage getting close enough to melee enemies
---
You are an idiot.
---
I'm hispanic white, meaning I'm as white as white bread but I'm actually half Mexican. I live in a very diverse place. I never really experienced a community being so white outside of traveling. I play as white characters too because it's closer to what I identify as.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.

If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.
---
Get blocker ASAP. Are you trying to go bloodied with it?
---
Wait, I didn't take a close look at them, they are all cargobots. Not vertibots.
---
Didn't know 76 had walkthroughs, every time a quest bugs out I just go do something else, the sort themselves out eventually
---
Unyielding, along with at least 3 AP refresh pieces. Greatly increases your VATs. 
---
If your gonna do stealth rifleman you might as well lean to LowHP/HighDMG and get yourself some bloodied weapons. And if you build it your SPECIAL  right, even with low HP you'll still have decent survivability.
---
I want Preston Garvey's great grandfather as a kid, living next to Grafton's mayor.
---
doubt that will happen but i wouldn’t mind trying to help you start out for sure
---
I dont remember paying a monthly fee for that. We played when it first came out and beat it before any new content came out. Once content started coming we were too busy for it and bailed since. Its been years lol
---
im not super interested in the battle royale mode. everything else sounds intriguing though. how do i do the new faction questline for the backpack? and the fault rade/dungeons? thank you so much btw
---
Go to any train station, there will be quest posters for the three new main quests. The vault dungeon open right now, Vault 94, activates when you get near it in the Mire/Savage Divide
---
With a golf club.
---
i can help you with washout tomorrow/today if you are on around 3-10pm est
---
Fuck cows and fuck challey.
---
Yeah I’ll be on. Sounds good.
---
Back on the Beat is the only event it drops from.
---
If the markers work than no nah, but i remember 2-3 times where markers decided not to show anything and i had to look up stuff
---
Why not a shotgun? What do you mean by crapshoot?
---
I'd say scrip vendor is the biggest addition my man
---
Yes!!
---
can’t seem to be able to find your gt on the app
---
It's really only 2 or 3 times for you?  It's been more like 100 for me.
---
Let me ask you the same question I asked someone else.  When you're inside a building which is a separate zone, do quest markers appear?  They don't for me.
---
For Australia EB games, got a 2nd hand one for 50% 9 aud (6usd) i shit you not and they had a ton of it
---
They do appear to be lagging and so i'm assuming it can contribute to server lag. Shooting at them does nothing really, they heal up out side of the map gradually. But they also just keep circling that location.
---

---
People are asking cause fornite is dead.
---
If I'm in shotgun range I just use melee. By crapshoot I mean sometimes they'll cripple and take down enemies, sometimes do very little damage.
---
I’m in Wasteland Republic for XB1. Great community of good honest people. We have a full trade hub for all categories of inventory. SBQ, arktos, encryptid, other public event runs happen on the regular. I highly recommend!  https://discord.gg/9aDRTur
---
Oh lemme get this straight, it has happened more than 100 times for me lol, at this point its usually not working than the other way around
---
But even if it happens, the text is still there and i was able to do the next step most of the time as they are pretty straight forward, and after the first glitched QM the next one tends to show up correctly even if i'm indoors. Couple times tho, especially DMV quest, i had to look it up as i couldnt understand it without the marker
---
King Dryco
---
It's not content though. It's more like a replacement for content. Would rather have another fun event to grind for 3* legendary enemies
---
Also player vending is a bigger addition than scrip vendor my guy
---
Talk to the Grafton Mayor for answers
---
I think 4/5 times I gave no idea where to go because the markers won't show, do yes I use walkthroughs regularly.
---
Fair enough 🤔
---
Core mechanics are set, lets go wastelanders!
---
No perks between sniper and pistol I'd probably say pistol, I'd recommend an instigating revolver
---
A better option might be to use a heavy gun, like .50 cal machine gun, gatling gun/laser, that kind of thing
---
The damage perks are in strength like shotgun so you can switch out from melee easily, or combine both if you've got enough points, and it gives far more range than shotgun
---
So sad, we are 2 months out from when it released and i haven't seen any balance changes, bug fixes or loot improvements. Wtf is wrong with these devs?
---
Well tbh fellers and please don't get mad at me😔, I find myself avoiding scorched if I can as they don't drop 556, gunpwdr or stimpaks as regularly as muties and oh this is the biggest reason
---
THEY DON'T SPAWN LEGENDARY VARIANTS
---
Is it that hard to mark SBQ and SB's spawns differently from local spawns? I understand why they did what they did but man I really just avoid scorched at this point:(
---
90% of the time you have to run behind Fort Defiance to tag the SB to take flight.
---
If you do it right you can kill it even before it takes off.
---
Either way the only way I've ever failied line in The sand is because I forgot mats to repair the Sonic generator.
---
Dearest Bruh, or ladyBruh,

"Tim Cain and Leonard Boyarsky, the creators of the Fallout series, served as the game's directors." From wiki. Tim Cain's face was the launcher on Fallout a post-apocalyptic role-playing game. Josh Sawyer is also still employed by them as of 2018 according to wiki, though he may not have worked on Outer Worlds. I'm not sure which people you are referring to, but as far as I'm concerned, Outer Worlds has more Fallout in it's DNA than any Fallout game on the creation engine except New Vegas. But this is coming from a hoary old vault dweller who has travelled the west coast wasteland since before the 2000s.
---
I gave the AMA a shout out a few days ago, but I was actually apart of the AMA part in this one so probably no real vid covering this stuff
---
I could kick myself, I wanted a pink so bad that I traded my forest for it not knowing how rare it was. Now I've found 4 more pinks and no forest (or red).
---
The ambient sounds of the game add a lot to it.
---
Hearing a deathclaw in the distance
---
The rumbling of a megasloth waking around
---
The clicking nosies of razorclaws in the water.
---
Being able to trace where the shooter is like the scene from the movie Book of Eli.
---
Or the ghouls a floor above you walking around. Unaware your near them
---
Even when. Repairing the power plants hearing the sounds of the broken pipes and the ghouls walking around is cool.
---
A lot of people miss the total immersion of the game by playing music and even the In game music which I Love.
---
Im playing on lowest since beta to reduce load times even tho i got pc that can run ultra at 120 fps
---
People keep saying that but they already said it would be back up on the 17th.  My 11 year old son is an avid player needless to say.
---
Facts: It is an extremely rare drop available ONLY in Forest events/dailies.  It's also possible to obtain through the few first Responders quests in Flatwoods.  The chances are very small, around 0.02% or something crazy like that.  I got super lucky and got one the 2nd day I tried grinding for rare outfits.  Good luck!
---
Like...tally marks?
---
There's a counter app on android. Each button press ups the counter by 1.
---
Little high on The Fixer plan imo, highest I've ever seen is 10k caps.  Some people sell em for as low as 7500 caps.
---
I'm working on a melee character. I'm using a double-barrel shotgun because of the range. If enemies are close and easy to reach, melee is best. I found a L15 Furious Hardened 1\* with a range of 72 which I'm still using at L29.
---
I actually found a Helvetica Garland plan for 500 caps a month ago in a player vendor. You better believe I snapped that up! As noted 5k seems to be the going rate.
---
I max daily caps easy just picking up guns and chems.
---
I have a love/hate relationship with this game.  Fallout is my favorite series of all time and when I started playing 76 I was very dissatisfied, even with fallout 4 to an extent as well.  After a while of going back to fallout 2,3, and NV, I decided to give 76 another shot and I was pleasantly happy with it.  I had to break away from the fallout expectations instilled within the fallout reputation and just take it for what it is and I’m truly have a blast with the game now.  Does it need work? Absolutely.  Is it broken? Yes, to multiple degrees.  However, it’s what we have and it will be long time before we get another game so I plan just having fun and enjoying WVA, after all; Where else can I have someone chase me with a chainsaw wearing a Patriotic vault boy head?
---
Yeah, cause they're considered a quest item.
---
Somebody was trying this on me at white springs tonight.... I’m on Xbox. The funny thing is this person had quite a nice set of plans and weapons for sale right next to the train station....
---
Good to know man, thanks! Still kinda new to the scene
---
I'm so bad at blocking. I need to remember to do that. I wasn't sure what weapon perk I wanted, but I had a death tanbo once on my first character that did extra damage, higher swing speed, and something else. I wish they had a life steal perk. Every time I do damage to someone I get 10% of that damage as health or something
---
Weird i dont See the Bos Symbol on your Army only a skull....
---
You are not important enough for your own thread. We don't care.
---
Sorry should have been more clear. Get the blocker perk card ASAP. You can get health regen perks on weapons.
---
Totally agree.
---
Yeah, turning off music comes just after setting graphics on literally every game I play, no matter how good the music might be.
---
When are they going to fix meshing
---
&gt;For some very odd reason Bethesda has decided not to implement ANY difficulty features whatsoever. There are no base difficulty options, no sliders, no hardmodes.
---
v94 difficulty features don't count I guess?
---
I second this. There's a mini cave nirth east of the house of scares, 1-2 honey beast, and maybe 8-10ish bloatflies spawn there. Just try to loot them immediately after killing, instead of killing everything then looting. Their corpses can be hard to find in the grass.
---
I actually nabbed some pumpkins in a play session the other day with this exact thing in mind.  It seemed like such a no brainer that I didn't even question whether it was possible to plant them at camp.
---
They need to add a bartering menu when you offer to trade an item for 1 or more items
---
Watoga Civic Center.
---
Our welcome!
---
I would play without music, but Scorched Earth and We Hold the Line Here (the boss battle tracks) are just too damn good to miss. Especially since I spend most of my time in the Bog with Scorchbeasts showing up every couple minutes.
---
What are some other rare outfits since you mentioned grinding for them?
---
I turn it off regularly.
---
F I’m on xb1
---
Yes...
---
You'll be fine. You'll just see people here and their is all.
---
There are other BOS Chapters out there that are Xbox or cross platform but I'll just say straight out that unfortunately none of them are as good as us. 
---
I don't even know any stable, reliable groups I could refer you onto.
---
Sorry bro.
---
Why should we care about them?
---
This doesn’t affect us at all.
---
Cross play??
---
No warning?
---
b/c building is fun!  and too many plushie's at CAMP
---
Its very sneaky. 
---
Its frustrating because its a bunch of small things that make the overall picture crappy. 
---
No button config? I mean even Duke Nukem 3D had that...
---
Definatly the best place I've seen. As a side stop camden park can spawn 6ish. Emphasis on "can"
---
Acknowledged
---
She totally is XD. Have fun you two beautiful people.
---
I thought it ended when the atom shop updates this tuesday.
---
[Here is the pic.](https://imgur.com/6pzHbvQ)  
---
It was taken on the bottom south part of the map. There was nothing there but it looked like a nice CAMP location tho.
---
extremely nice and articulate writeup.  to expand on a point you mentioned, there is a definite feel of two diff masters pulling the game's direction in diametrically opposed ways.
---
I had no idea. Fortunately I have been taking down plenty of scorched anyway, just for funsies.
---
Responders fireman with white helmet, BOS jumpsuit, White Springs caddy jump suit, White Powder jump suit. Also worth mentioning are the asylum outfits which are hard to find, the red one being worth mega caps/trade.
---
2816 hours and counting...
---
I wish I could get mine to already m at least try D;
---
Yeah. I specifically said *hardcore* to differenciate it from the pvp mode. 
---
I mean a mode that is restricted to level 100+ players. A mode where damage and radiation recieved is increased. Where the NPCs are more numerous and uplevelled and can actually detect players.
---
[They still spawn.](https://i.imgur.com/ePB9p82.png)
---
And I disagree.  Most players claim workshops for the resources and I think that you, and most PvPers, know this.  A small minority actually want or welcome PvP.  
---
I do agree that when you claim a workshop that you know that it's a possibility.  For example, I always dump everything into my stash right before and right after gathering resources, just in case.  
---
So far I've run across only one mature PvP player in the game.   Most end up being brats.  I had the racetrack workshop and was using it to try out new building techniques and was just about to blueprint the whole thing when the workshop was contested and he one-shoted me.  I got on my mic and asked nicely if I could have it back to save my design.  He gave me the workshop back and even dropped my junk for me, even though I didn't ask for it back. 
---
My final thought is this, when PvP is even, it comes down to skill.  When it's one sided, it's just a duck shoot...   enjoy your duck shoots, I'd rather spend my time taking on harder challenges...
---
Its 4/10 right now maybe better when dlc comes
---
I've seen someone post a link to a wiki page that says what has and hasn't changed, but I didn't save the url. I have a mildly toxic habit of downvoting any "is it worth it? Is it better? Convince me without making me do any research myself?" Posts I see. A pinned post would really clear up this sub.
---
public service announcement...
---
as if they are community managers lol
---
i get this too.
---
I'll hold out for another year.. No Mans Sky VR, Borderlands 3, and Cyberpunk coming out soon I'm going to be okay.. Thanks. Sincerely I did search the front few pages and threw a few into the keyword search and nothing in the last 5 months came up.. Sorry if this may have continued a theme. I was so excited about this game, played the living crap out of it then my friends and I just kind of gravitated away from the wasted.
---
TLDR: Sorry, see you all next year.
---
She's got some serious RBF going on... It's perfect!
---
I also had this problem recently, and they fixed it for me as well all I had to do was put back some time in my special points because they were reset
---
Truth hurts XD
---
I used to do that all the time, but found that it was wasted time if you don't get a legendary within the first couple waves.  Sure, you can sit there and farm it all day, but moving on the West-Tek or your other personal favorite farming spot is going to be much more lucrative.  Sometimes you get a really hot server and there seems to be a legendary in every wave, but that's a pretty rare occurrence.  If it's scorched or liberators, I'll just kill the boss straight away and hope another horde shows up on the map soon.  They sometimes pop up one after the other.
---
It's like One Violent Night.  You have the ability to farm that for 25 minutes, but if you don't get a legendary within the first few waves, legendaries aren't suddenly going to come pouring out like the dam broke.  It's better to just get the wendigo to show up, collect your lvl 40 item, maybe a bonus Nailer, and move on.
---
I dunno man, that looks like too much hassle and extremely niche thing to do. Are you sure that is what happens? I mean, do you have a solid proof someone actually does that, not just assumption?
---
Even if they come some BoS RP’er will just kill them and be hurdur
---
It’s the wall hanging that spells out the town name.
---
there should be a few friendly ghouls and super mutants like in previous fallouts 
---
i miss the NPCs, without them appalachia feels too empty 
---
sometimes i see a group of super mutants fighting those helicopters, i would like to see more fights like this between factions 
---
and faction specific quests would be cool too
---
yeah dont be focusing on legendaries at your lvl 
---
instead, come by my shop and see my cheap and modified armour for low lvls
---
Somewhat off topic but I was in Watoga the other day—all the bots were fighting a cargobot, like forfuckingever, and I was able to just trot around killing them all with barely any resistance. If anyone happens to come across a similar scenario, I highly recommend taking advantage
---
Pretty much every super mutant drops gunpowder
---
How cheap is cheap? And what platform?
---
Eh shooting her In the face with a tse handmade is still effective. Definatly not the best but I can see her health bar dropping when I hit her. I do have tankkiller and a perferating mag
---
I found The Fixer to be a useful rifle until you can pick up a better legendary. Having never used a heavy weapon I can't comment it's just the ammo needed that puts me off.
---
My friends and I left the vault and started on the story quest. We very quickly got bored of that and, seeing a large tall structure surrounded by smoke, headed towards that. We were distracted by the Poseidon Energy Plant, and worked together to get it up and running. We proceeded down to the theme park on the map, explored there, and that's when we built our first house - a 2x2 wooden shack with paintings of barns on the walls.
---
After that, we headed into Charleston, then up to the firehouse. We passed the test to become Firebreathers and headed down into the mine. We proceeded into the Ash Heap, through a destroyed town featuring our first encounter with mole men with rocket launchers, and found the excavator, the large structure we had been heading towards. We explored it as the beta ended.
---
add me on psn with 'fo76' in request, 
---
im lvl 42 and i can help you out with quests
---
i can picture my gf playing fallout with me, seeing this pic and saying "shes a mood" lmao
---
I just want that square roof panel so my fireplace can have somewhat of a chimney
---
Came here to say this. Indisputably the best way to find bloatflies.
---
Um, have you gotten All Rise* yet?
---
We don't know. One of the raiders said "we've been everywhere, seen everything." In the trailer so we know at the very least that he is from outside of Appalachia all together.
---
Haven't played in months, hopped on today and fought 3 SBQ fights and all her goons. It ain't much, but it's honest work.
---
Right on, thankyou.
---
Acid from cave cricket in Tanagra town
---
Well that's cool, so not everyone died.
---
And that's when we nuke their camps.
---
The quest in the mire dives into ghouls a bit. There was heavy prejudice in Appalachia. Many ghouls were shot on sight so people didn't even know non ferals were a thing for a while. After that all of them either left Appalachia or killed by people who didn't trust these weird mutated creatures.
---
Yeah, no reason they should be that easy, you can outlevel/outgear this event in one play session, throw in some shitty legendary enemies at least
---
Everyone in the Appalachian wasteland died to the scorched plague/fighting the scorched directly. These settlers and raiders are coming from outside of Appalachia so it's likely they haven't met the scorched yet.
---
welcome to fallout 76 
---
i recently had a lvl 275+ wreck me 
---
however, since i built max. amount of lvl 2 turrets all over the place, he died as well and i stole his loot and dumped it in my stash 
---
after that he just kept killing me and jumping away but never took the workshop
---
.... how would they survive atomic bombs being dropped on them and wallowing in radiation for years on end?
---
Thanks for the idea. Will give it a go
---
Not at all. Many people are probably just wanderers from outside the WV area. The scorched plague never left the state as far as we know. There’s plenty of survivors in the country elsewhere
---
Why lone wanderer?
---
This is on PC, yes. Only 1080p but I have a reshade (Optimum Reshade) running and that is the Feral photo-mode filter in the first pic.
---
Hello, thanks very much for answering :) I'll spread the info around in my discord.
---
They've always been there. We don't know the answers yet but it's not a bug.
---
If it could help, I first brought her to shop for a whole day then bought her the game ahah
---
Save scrip till level 50 just use whatever you find till then or make your own. Events will reward 1 star armor at your level sometimes.  Leader of the pack always has 3 one star wolves for some easy scrip
---
Currently there's no real reason to continue playing NW once you hit rank 100, unless you just really enjoy the mode.  I doubt a few extra caps could change that when it's already very easy to earn a lot of caps in Adventure.  They would need to add new limited time rewards on a regular basis, or perhaps take a "season" approach like other BR games in order to make NW popular again.
---
That's awesome! (hope the in game counter can actually keep track)
---
.... west Virginia wasnt the only place it by the bombs.
---
Just a reminder for the #pcmr, there is a mod on Nexus that fixes this.
---
I used to wait outside vault 76 in a sack hood and red dress with a chainsaw for the level 1s to emerge..welcome to the wasteland baby!
---
Well I came back yesterday and made a new character, left the old one at 50 because I was overwhelmed by the amount items and quests it had ... here is the kicker, I didn't ask her or even check the subreddit till today.
---
Vampire. I have a vampires minigun and I can stand in the queens face firing an entire clip without a worry in the world. Several mobs around me hitting and I only notice when she's down.
---
Who else would it be?
---
I am definitely checking that out. Thanks!
---
Go the Glass canon route it's enjoyable but scary. Aka The Mistress of Mystery, The blade of Bastet has 50% armor penetration equip the eye of Horus and the garb of Mysteries and it ramps up to 100% armor penetration, no need for the insisor perks. Iv'e taken out a room fullof Super Mutants without them seeing me just don't get seen.
---
The mods can be found very rarely and unreliably at vendors or out in the wild. The mod plans can only be learned by scrapping Gatling Guns. Crafting the guns to scrap yourself is the only time-efficient way to do so. Boost your INT with Berry Mentats to increase your chance of learning the mods.
---
I don't like battle royale games either. I don't really PVP at all either. But give NW a try... there's just something fun about it.
---
I agree. Leave them alone. The only thing needed is a bit more stability. But I enjoy the challenge and raids are the only reason I get on anymore
---
Thanks for this, I’ll definitely use that mentats trick.
---
The plans for the BOS combat armor can be bought cheaply from the Grafton train station vendor, IIRC. The underarmor should be a possible reward for handing in Technical Data during the Forbidden Knowledge quest.
---
Commander's Charge is per now "legacy", so you might be able to sell it to a collector
---
Both can be found on a table outside one of the buildings at Beckett Farm up in the Toxic Valley.
---
So?
---
Nah they’re still laggy. Even simple silo runs don’t always work, every second or third silo run requires me to relog to be able to get past the reactor room.
---
No they are not. Read my post on why you lag Mr downvote.
---
r/cringe
---
Seeing that they already had tracked other accomplishments via inside the vault posts I'd say they are tracking something. More than likly they are tipping the scale for us a little though.
---
I used to do this with FO4, but my play sessions are much shorter these days and I usually quite like the ambient music. It's the combat music I could do without. It would be cool if when you were in [caution] mode sound would cut out to make it more eerie.
---
Seems like two weeks out of three, the vault is FULL of bugs!
---
They update the site later again, not sure if we got it or not.
---
Thats happened to me too. A couple of times.
---
They did a great job of the ambient soundscapes in this one.
---
I actually didn’t downvote you until just now, and Why on earth do you think you’re qualified to tell people why they’re lagging?
---
Does this stop the sound loop or are you suggesting you should shoot the bot?
---
I take that back my actual evidence is a video on youtube a while back of some guy showing his gfs sparkling new empty inventory after the vault wiped it clean ... everything except quest items if i remember correctly.  I have also heard rumours on reddit as well so pretty sure its a thing. Haven’t heard about that survival thing or maybe its the same case i dunno. For anyone looking for workarounds ibe heard your stash is safe from the wipe personally i dont want to risk it either way
---
The best is when i read that it's a waste of resources ,when there are stimpaks at every corner and ammo scrap to craft double the ammo used.
---
I'm not doing less damage than I have been doing to her. I get the armor thing. I usually hit her with an AA Handmade until my hp gets low and switch to a bloodied gauss. It usually works.
---
Although one of the times in question I did seem to attract an absurd amount of the events Ankle bighters so maybe that time I did less damage to the sbq herself than I usually do.
---
Honeslty I wouldn’t take thier word for it I’m certainly not going to the test dummy to find out whether their vault still wipes items or not.  Enter at your own risk
---
The 'Exterminator' card only works on mobs, not game bugs.
---
Cringe is a bunch of ripped Smurphs exposing their pubes that live in dick houses. 
---
Wtf even is that?
---
isnt it hot
---
No, but you'll want to subscribe for the sweet sweet crafting bag alone (everything else included is just icing on the cake).
---
Thank you! Didn’t knew that XD
---
Remember how you helped rose set up that radio beacon in order to call in all the raiders to Appalachia for help with looting and shooting.
---
Youd think so but they dont like admitting that incels are more mentally stable than  their game
---
what
---
I killed like 12 scorched since the announcement. I only log in to do the dailies and log off. You're right, these were not tracked in any way.
---
You can craft mentats after learning how in Sam Blackwell's Bunker, if I remember right. 
---
I think your best bet may be Pharma Farmer runs at Morgantown Airport and other medical facilities.
---
There are 2 kinds of 76 players.
---
They already do it for beer bottles and baseballs. I don't get why they locked some but not others
---
Its tedious, but if you spend an hour server hopping the 2 yao guai that spawn near mountainside bed and breakfast, you'll get hundreds of acid. They drop 5 to 8 aswell as springs that are nice to sell.
---
And so much fun!
---
Sledge is lvl 30 so its scrip
---
76 is like prison, find the biggest guy and knock him out. 
---
You, my friend, are the biggest guy in Appalachia.
---
I was hoping I could sell them at my vendor for a small bit of caps to any player that didn't have one yet or needed another one.  Can't do that.
---
I can recommend the vault raids on two of the three week rotation. The flooding week has infinite bug spawns and is great for bloatflys as well as most of the other ingredients you'll need.
---
What site
---
Then what's your GT? Let's see if you can back it up.
---
Bugs are horrendous - out of 3 tries with it in last 3 days only one try was successful - first game crashed to windows when I was opening GECK chamber, the second time friend has the same problem and I couldn't do last part alone. And lags are dreadful - when you wait 10+ seconds for screen to load on monitor it's pointless to play on anything other than novice.
---
A) Your Agility is low  
---
B) You position yourself too close to the SBQ  
---
C) Selective memory  
---
D) All of the above
---
Why do you have one chilling in a closet?
---
I see you're wearing your wedding necklace
---
The terminals explain that the facility was tasked with finding a way to destroy all proof of DNA experimentations in case of nuclear war in an attempt to cover up the wrongdoing of the government, the army and their contractors.
---
There is no FEV in those vats, the virus is dead.
---
I usually keep the radio off and just listen to the atmospheric soundtrack. It can either make the game calm and relaxing or make it intense.
---
Let me know how this works out? Otherwise I'd say go check captainoob.. he made a medic walkthrough ;)
---
I'm experiencing this half the time, although I'm only crouching outside the fence of V9. In fact, this tactic so far avoided many SBQ glitches caused by those fence-sitters. I can only speculate otherwise. Being biggest threat based on damage? Being more reachable than other players?
---
This: [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events)
---
Gunsmith I've found is rather unnecessary unless you're using explosive guns which have fucking dogshit durability.  Though I guess you could use it if you really wanted to.  Also chemist is obviously unnecessary to keep while not crafting.  I'd say take some points out of Int and put them somewhere else.  Probably End.  You'll get more bang for your buck from healing.  Or charisma for more team play.
---
I'm an actual IT and I belive I am qualified enough enough to say the OP is talking out his ass. Lmao.
---
The raids arent hard, they're a buggy mess.
---
If you want something to do damage at distance you need a good heavy gun. My personal advice as a fellow melee build is to seek for a Gatling Gun or a .50 cal Machine Gun
---
Apologies, it would seem I was not very eloquent.
---
That is what I meant, that when they add existing misc items that scrap into components to new recipes they should add the keyword as they did with those examples.
---
50k 556 is essentially 45-50k caps and yeah its worth it
---
Go on then, what is this pc that can run at 120fps. My machine is shiny AF and still bogs down to 45-50 in busy areas @4k.  
---
What is this beast?
---
Nah. Not worth at all. Nope. I give you sweet deal, 1k caps and raw fertilizer.
---
That's a mighty potent gun you have; don't sell it. There are guys who would trade it for legacy.
---
No chance with uranium fever full of assholes who one shot the legendary enemies
---
So when outsiders come does that mean that
---
- the scorched blight has ended or
---
- they re all vaccinated?
---
The same way everyone else did? Being in the right place at the wrong time.
---
OP, you're still going to need to tune it. The settings are mental, shadow distance on Max is something stupid in the "miles away beyond your sight" stuff, but you pay to render the stuff you can't see.
---
*Grahm didn't like that*
---
Ok thanks .
---
Correct answer is C btw
---
Lol touche
---
Yeah, don't buy the bramin milk from my vendor....
---
Np.
---
Players are connected to servers Randomly dude and playing Fallout solo is hardly idiotic.
---
I've killed 697 in last7 days
---
and you dont tell me what i cant tell
---
have you ever played the other fallouts..?
---
Still decent bra coz its a 50cal
---
Amused, or not, she's still there. That's a win, my friend.
---
I had moved my camp to a fissure site temporarily to help out
---
Now to keep her there, I already collected all the possible teddy bears to show off in her C.A.M.P
---
ps4 
---
cheap is a price lower than its value, but also affordable and appropriate to its item level, so that beginners can actually spend caps on something useful
---
for example, lvl 5 items with several modifications for 20-30 caps
---
None of them are worth much in my opinion, bloodied sledgehammer looked good at first but it's not max level. I'd scrip it all if it were me.
---
The Plan is rare and valuable to plan collectors. Same as barbed plan and others which Only drops on forest events. Don’t sell lt for caps and don’t let the scrubs here fool you
---
ya i believe i learned all the learnable drugs/medicine expect formula q.
---
thank you for the advise, this might work
---
Harpers ferry is the only place I have seen TWO max level legendary scorched, in a thousand+ hours of gameplay.
---
I just check player vendors for Gunpowder if I really need it. Can usually find it for 2-3 caps or even occasionally free.
---
It happens all the time....
---
I’m on PS4, I play a couple of times a week. Have only met a couple of others in game in almost 12 months. Look up rynobiwan.
---
Used to dress with clown suit and ritual mask  hiding near new players and then Chase them while screaming on mic, too bad i dont have flaming mod for chainsaw. Those times i Chase are the most funny part of Game, sometimes even those ppl run and Scream haha
---
nice, i always like scenarios like this, i regularly see super mutant fight off a deathclaw as well 
---
but for me the problem with fo76 is the lack of atmosphere... i mean some places in the wild look stunning and cool, but all major cities are dead or filled with the same robots 
---
i miss that apocalyptic atmosphere where factions are trying to survive, but at the same time they are fighting each other for power while also fighting off a shitload of radiated monsters..
---
now it feels more like you wander about and occassionally there is a lvl 1 chinese robot attacking your house... ofcourse you can go to higher lvl locations, but in general the monsters are the same anywhere you go 
---
and they could make it very interesting by emphasizing factions, like in new vegas, with faction specific quests, followers, items, privileges etc..
---
Hey, Kevduit! Came across your pile of '76 videos a couple of weeks ago and you're one of the few folks who actually played the game before rating it, good effort.  
---
As for my view of the game? I try to play daily if the kids will let me. I own 3 copies of the game, to let some of my kids (my two boys, *way* below the age rating of the game) build camps on the river in Flatwoods, plant crops and milk the wandering bramin. They treat it like "Minecraft for grown ups".  
---
Their first interaction with a player that wasn't me? A level 70(ish) dropped them a set of pocketed leather armour.  
---
I can log in and just wander around and enjoy the views.  
---
Stuff like Meat Week and Fashnakchthck are brilliant for bring a group together.
---
That’s great to know, I have a X01 set for my melee build, is there any advantage to the excavator PA over the X01?
---
It's persisted since the dragons in Skyrim, and I get it constantly in 76
---
800 hours and you still go to white springs lol
---
Sometimes the body can jump to where the living creature first spawned- not always but if you follow back to where you first saw it you can sometimes find it.
---
At Grafton, but not the Station the town.  Also at Camden Park
---
u/salty-gaming
---
If you want BoS Combat armour you need to by the Plans. Both the Combat armour build plans (Light, Surdy and Heavy available from the two BoS Vendors among others) AND the BoS Mod plans from the vendors mentioned above.
---
Undersuit lining plans, Treated and Resistant are purchase-able from the BoS vendors, the other 2 are quest drops only.
---
Yea why not? To farm legendaries, xp and some chems, whats so odd about that
---
I think we got it. I killed a few hundred scorched myself and I got my scip wallet bursting at seams! How many active players are there I wonder?
---
super mutants. Gunpowder is just acid and cloth. Head to the prison and then the lumber yard ( North West) low level mutants have tons.
---
Platform heels all the way man
---
Me and my bf play 76 together almost everyday, we tried it on a free weekend and are admittedly addicted I think hahaha we are both the same level and share everything in the game and did the whole story together (even when we had to do missions twice in a row)
---
I play most games without music. I call it the BBB Experience cause it allows you to hear the Birds the Bugs and the Breeze.
---
This is adorable.
---
No need to have Gunsmith on all the time.
---
Put 3 perk points into Weapon Artisan, it repairs weapons to 200%. 
---
When you repair weapon you have Weapon Artisan active and then you take it off when gun fixed, freeing up available perk points. 
---
The weapon will degrade at the same rate as if Gunsmith was active (wasting 5p perk points).
---
Tuesday at 8 EDT the codes reset. It used to be Monday until a bug a month or so back.
---
Also if you are Bloodied put one perk point into Endurance for Radicool.
---
Give you more strength the higher your rads.
---
if your so OG then you would realize they are just using fallout to get free marketing and piggy back off it's good name. I never played a game that was "made by the creators of" that was any good except wasteland.
---
yeah, watch the video... that game doesn't look too good
---
to Reddit, to rage with crushed hopes and back to 76.
---
I rarely play with music in any game. Especially this one.  I like to hear what's ahead. About the only time is when I'm chilling in CAMP, or rebuilding it. Workman has to have the radio on. Lol.
---
slightly unrelated but I have wanted to PLAY as a ghoul since I first got my hands on a Fallout game
---
No, you are not connected to a server randomly if you join with team from main menu ..
---
Whitespring has one of the highest concentration of enemies (golf club alone has a whole hoarde of ghouls) and I doubt that level 68 ghouls are an easy kill for a newer level 40 player. I farm west tek and other locations such as flooded trainyard, harpers ferry etc. but they dont have that many enemies therefore less chance for a legendary to spawn. I don't care about mats since I have around 130 repair kits farmed from SBQ, but the junkie ghouls in WS drop valuable chems which I transfer to my alt character which utilizes junkies melee build
---
Thank you for the advice pal!
---
no the audio just doesnt work anymore, checked all the settings and it just isnt working
---
Born survivor for bloodied build? Whole idea of bloodied is to be below 20%, so every 20 secs it'll use stimpack which will do nothing?!?!
---
I agree with the Gunsmith - I also have stealth bloodied rifleman and weapon degradation is slow enough to no waste 5 perk points for Gunsmith (I use B25 Fixer and Handmade and BE25 Lever).
---
So I'll move some points from INT to luck and get max Class Freak and better crits.
---
You're clearly her favourite!
---
got a ton of those yesterday at Morgantown airport lol
---
why not both?
---
Troll
---
I never listen to music while playing when playing any game. I do have ingame music on by on very quiet so it can't be really be heard.
---
Sweet. So this captainoob doesn’t know what he’s doing I suppose.
---
It's a counter.
---
I am unfortunately already level 235 while she's just level 7, but I can still function as bodyguard ahah
---
it's so fun. Busting those yellow excavators like a.
---
I don't know why he do it, maybe you should ask him instead of copying his build without thinking about it. You asked for advice, so I write you down why it's pointless - for bloodied build you should be 19% health (highest unyielding bonus + Nerd Rage threshold), which will trigger Born survivor every 20 sec, only wasting your stims.
---
It's up to you if you use my advice or no...
---
Baronik, do I hav BiS gear? Uny/Sent/AP marine armor and Bloodied Fire Rate Fast Reload Fixer? Also, can you share your build on nukesdragons? We did a bunch of trades on market76 I believe ;)
---
Doing Workshop PvP and PvE in a team.
---
i hope it destroyed fortnite
---
Whitespring Mr handies don't give loot or XP. And the buttler bots only give XP and loot if they were normally spawned in, they also spawn dynamically from those boxes and those don't give anything, just like the Mr Handy.
---
il agree with the raids being easy and a team activity, it is also the __only__ content in the game where you want to be teamed instead of solo.  which is more reason why i dont think it should be nerfed, its designed for teams, not solo.  the tasks are all relatively easy once you break the rooms up and give everyone a role/route.
---
i do really enjoy running raids, but that said, the raids still have their problems:
---
- you have no choice in what server you get put on
---
- stability needs massive improvement, some servers are so bad doors take 30+ seconds to open, you gotta get lucky to get a fast server
---
- not gonna say much about your timing, seems at an appropriate speed
---
- meltdown specifically, is one of the most buggy missions  i have ran, between ghouls spawning in the floor/behind pipes, and some very bad/hard to get keycards because of object placement, it was the least fun one to expert clear.
---
now that i think about it, they have to know how many people have been saving up scrip and been grinding scorched. If we didn’t hit the goal then a lot of people would be demoralized and possibly leave. They know they can’t afford another hit like that. They’re definitely at the very least will bump us to the goal if we didn’t actually hit it
---
Yep. Twice to me recently. Also it has taken every other option away to respawn except vault 76
---
I think we did. Got to still wait maybe 5-9 hours for any news from Beth though.
---
I give permission to use my opinions.
---
(I started on release day, 1700 hours in, 3rd character @ lvl 336, full health Heavy Gunner Excavator PA build.)
---
Looking back, it was quite buggy and unbalanced back then, plus the lack of community/wiki knowledge made it generally difficult to improve one's build. For example, it took me 1000 rounds of Gatling Gun to finish a simple lvl 50 Scorchbeast. Today, it takes 10-30 rounds. Many of the perk cards and effects didn't work properly. Perhaps the biggest issue for me was that you could get killed with splash damage outside PvP and many griefers/exploiters were at it. I didn't mind the lack of human NPCs and the landscape/story was engaging enough that kept me going. I have a tendency to stumble upon bugs and provided many uncommon bug cases to the "Unofficial roundups" posts.
---
Today, many of those problems from the early days have been replaced by newer problems. As the game ages and gets bigger, more crashes, basic to complicated show-stopper bugs have surfaced. Contentwise, there aren't many things to do in Adventure mode. The dailies (when they work) have become boring and monotone for a veteran like me. There weren't many soloable and somewhat rewarding quest additions (i.e., Biv is okay, but the private-eye quests are one time only, V94 is pointless). Starting a new character is just tedious: grinding for 60 hours to get all perks and level, while grinding for 100s of hours to find the legendary gear. Or grind the money to buy them (except when one wants non-mainstream vending items such as Troubleshooter's gear).
---
I think all these issues boil down to bad management. Devs are likely forced to work on new content instead of fixing bugs once and for all. NW delayed essential bugfixes and Wastelanders almost delayed the PA fixes. Also there are at least two syndromes I, as a software developer myself, have noticed: *down the rabbit hole* and *the CEO's nephew*. The first one is about trying to remedy a bad decision that require further decisions which then lead to more remedies. The second one is akin to lower skilled devs related to management able to push through bad code &amp; bad design because "they are smart kids and know computers".

So Fallout 76 overall isn't bad but isn't good or exceptional either and what's concerning is that just this one year, there was no shift towards exceptionality but everything just stayed "ok enough".
---
Oh, that’s not what I meant. I didn’t copy his build. I’m going to use it with suggestions made by others. My apologies. :)
---
I had brought this up awhile ago and I still think it'd be really cool to have these "live events" in Fallout. You could so much cool stuff and really bring the community together to witness something special in the world like a vault opening or a location getting destroyed.
---
Sadly I don't think their game engine can even do something lime that. Everytime we get new content its just servers down for maintenance then boom there's new content. Closet I think we'll get is little clues that are added to the world like the nuke briefcases awhile back for NW.
---
And the page is glitched for alot of people, you have to manually force update it to actually see if it changed or not. Definitely something on their end.
---
.... a lot of people survived in the USA after bombs dropped... have you played any fallout games? Heck have you played this fallout game? Every character you “meet” in the game survived the blast. They may be dead now, but they didn’t die from nuclear bombs. The responders you learned about when you first started playing survived the bombs lol
---
I don't see why this same approach couldn't be done in F76 especially as F2 caves are pretty much 100% of what I'd love to see in this regard
---
I didn’t even get that option. It wouldn’t open the menu. It just said respawn. It wouldn’t respond to any inputs.
---
Do you have a job or anything? I can't understand how you could have over 1000 hours and when it has been out for a year. That's almost 3 hours everyday for 365 days in a row without skipping a day...
---
it was an example, not a judgment on fortnite. I mean it's nice, for a fan of a live game, to see it change suddenly with an event that concerns the whole community, leaving the communiy the mystery of what's going on.
---
FO76 players -- Bethesda should stop the play to win
---
FO76 players -- I bought a god roll weapon for $15.
---
If you are finding legendary armor, that is probably good enough for your level. I wouldn’t scrip it unless it unless it’s a piece you don’t need. There isn’t a lot of legendary armor at your level. If you really want it so
---
Leader of the pack every time it pops.
---
that's exactly what I mean, and I fear that the engine won't be able to do things like that ..
---
imagine an explosion near watoga that changes the city, and imagine that this happens without warning .. a dream ..
---
What nonsense are you talking?  It doesnt matter if you load in with a team or not, the game still places you in a random server.  You have ZERO control over which servers you join.  Unless you can show everyone a server lobby that noone other than you knows about,  then your talking out of your ass
---
but even though you just used it as an example,
---
i still hope this black hole destroyed fortnite
---
Hmm I haven't noticed. I thought it was junk item. If I remember Ill check next time. But if it's weightless I don't care, there's a lot of bogus stuff in misc category anyway, making the whole category useless since it's too tedious to check.
---
It's a known bug. Happens at all of the public events I think. If you die as the event ends you can't respawn. I've had it happen at Encryptid.
---
Ah, they didn't mention Whitesprings. So I thought this was a spawn elsewhere.
---
Well, that explains why I try to do the quest and that place is always dead.
---
Camden park was very lucrative.. kept server hopping killing and jumping again... Didn't add up my kills but did it for 2 days...
---
Rabbits cannot vomit. They don’t have enough muscles in their stomach.
---
Bos plans are at the train station just got them yesterday for my newest toon.
---
I would hardly call them legacy since you can get the same thing with rng in game. Unlike an explosive energy weapon which you cannot get ever.
---
It’s an extreme buzz kill for me
---
Two-man team, we took every workshop someone else set foot in and ran the map killing people for hours and mouthing off the other day. 
---
Then someone nuked 4 of our workshops and came to fight us at the ammunitions factory 2v4 cuz they couldn't take us in an even fight. Then they just left with our name still all over the map claiming it was no longer our server? 
---
Regardless, getting nuked twice was funny as hell and yes, if one name is all over the map, we're asking for it. Literally. Please wipe us out so we can learn something. 
---
Dude killed me once when I jumped over to him with a syringer (partner thought he was glitched) and called fighting me boring - but dude, I changed your whole game that day and you know it. Don't be so salty.
---
Sould make a sub for 76 missed connections! 😂🤔🙃 ( not saying this doesnt belong here, being genuine)

---
Marsupial recipe for 200 caps
---
How is this not an achievement?
---
uhm .. the servers are rented from amazon and is really fucking fast ones. 
---
You connect to a serverfarm close to where you are located, if you have 4 people all playing from EU you will be connected to the closest eu serverfarm amazon have available.
---
The reason why you might have lag is because one person of your team is located outside of eu(example) and that is when you see lag.
---
The reason why we had the first weeks of the raids is because the servers+engine couldn't handle the pressure events+raids put on the server at the same time and this was fixed by nerfing event spawns.
---
Wow!
---
Why do you wear this collar? Isn't it exploding?
---
Sorry. PvP is fun. It's disappointing when someone gives up so easily.
---
I remember I got on all excited to get a taste for the game and crashed 5 minutes in, if only I knew.
---
no duuude, you are connected to the closest amazon serverfarm depending on your team setup. If one person is located somewhere else in the world you will have lag.
---
Also fallout 76 is a multiplayer game last time I checked, perhaps fallout 1,2,3,nv,4 is more for you.
---
32gb ram i9 2x 1080 ti
---
What I am noticing is this:
---
- People who have grinded the Vault 94 Raids and have completed their sets or are close to doing so, are generally positive about the Raid's stability.
---
- People who have tried to run the Raids 1-3 times and failed each time are generally negative about the Raids stability.
---
Why can this trend be noticed so clearly? Is it a sunk cost fallacy by the Raid proponents? Or is it cognitive dissonance by the Raid opponents? Perhaps a combination of both? Perhaps it is tied to the platform on which the Raids are done?
---
two days ago I came across someone who was selling 100% Fusion Cores at the price of 1 Cap each. He had like 45 of them. I bought 1.
---
I just want to be a ghoul.
---
Be wearing my red and blue PA but with a sheepsquatch head, the Power Sqautch
---
That range though.
---
Gunpowder is practically a gimme with super mutants. But you can also craft it.
---
Acid... makeshift batteries have it along with abraxo cleaner which is almost everywhere. A number of enemies have it as well, I think cave crickets carry it but they can be a real nightmare sometimes. If you want to harvest it you can take the workshop just to the west of the water park (can't remember the names right now) it's got a couple acid spots
---
Yeah having random, sourceless music is peak immersion. I even keep the pipboy radio low. 
---
Fallout 76 is my Westworld lol.
---
I think 30 is kind of cap - as far as I remember someone has been doing tests and getting more than 30 INT didn't prolonged the durability bar for crafted pieces. He was published his tests here, but it was few months ago...
---
Calibrated shocks for sure, and depending on your survival needs, Medic Torso. I think the arm mods are bugged still.
---
I don’t think I do the most damage every time but I’m definitely up there as one of the biggest hitters. But I’m almost always in the middle of everyone.
---
It’s interesting.
---
oh my god! how dare you have fun with pvp!!! /s
---
Glad you laid them out and had a good time!
---
I sell everything dirt cheap, around 20 for all plans. I would just rather be a hobbit than a dwarve
---
Done some research. Found that collecting gunpowder is almost useless if you can get a lot of acid &amp; cloth along with super duper 3.
---
I bought few nice items from players vendors: B5090 Handmade for 8k, BSS+1STR Meat Hook for 666 caps and QE Railway for 3,5k.
---
Ah, probably getting confused with ExPA plans, would have visited Town repeatedly thus probably why I though it was there
---
Remember that the front ring sight obscures a lot of your vision! Bethesda added a crosshair dot the Gatling Gun a while ago
---
I found a BFFR +1 agi 10mm pistol in the scrip machine. As for vendors probably a JE +1 per assault rifle for 300 caps. Not amazing weapons but nice rolls on them.
---
#WHAT?
---
I don't even look for cores at generators and don't bother with power plants. I find so many from enemy drops, event rewards and loot containers.  
---
Every few weeks I switch to just using my Furious/FFR Gatling laser to burn them off.
---
That's true cause you can craft shit tons of it that way. I personally find it and craft it either way just so I can get my hands on it.... I'm an ammo whore so to speak
---
Yea that’s true I guess!
---
Very true. And I would assume that even after the bombs fell and the scorched plage swept the area, there would be west Virginian ghouls sitting in rocking chairs on their porches with shotguns refusing to leave. But, having killable NPCs in a game with so many players wasn't something they were prepared to do, so they were left out.
---
Thing is. That stuff normally sells for a decent price. And up til now I was solely a melee build. Never used anything but a combat rifle to pop off shots on legendary mobs. Besides that it was all one hit melee. So I literally sold all the ammo and crafting materials I had til now. I am becoming an ammo whore too...
---
Music is the first thing that i turn off in everygame i play, i know that sometime it's a shame but i love to hear the effects, it's more immersive :)
---
What's the build you're trying to make because it does not make sense.
---
Showing numbers like that don't have so much sense with seeing which perks you're using.
---
Maybe for a few days. When Borderlands 3 released, I spent about 40 hours to play it twice with 2 different characters. Then I returned to Fallout 76. I'll play Outer Worlds but based on previews, the replay value and gameplay loop isn't that engaging for me to keep playing it over and over.
---
I only assume you're getting downvoted because of your tone, because you're not wrong. People hated getting wanted so they made it so you can't get wanted from hitting someones camp unless you do it repeatedly. Still not good enough now you can't destroy a camp unless that person is in active combat with you. Then they didn't like slap damage so that was removed. Then they didn't want PvP at all so they made survival with a slight xp boost to make up for all the walking you'd have to do. PvE foodbuilds wanted that extra XP so they cried until they made it so you cant 1 shot someone. Then that wasn't good enough so they made a 110 damage cap. When everyone went full automatic weapons in response they still cried so they nerfed legendary effects of weapons and armor to the point where a handmade would do 6 damage per shot. Everyone besides the elite with the means (caps, time, hookups with dupers) to switch their builds to the stealthboy tesla meta left survival and it died. Well guess what. Now these people that have fine tuned their build to kill you in a millisecond are back. I for one loved survival but after months of tweaking a build only to have it be nulled with 1 single patch why would I stay? Sounds harsh but the whining of these foodbuilds brought this upon themselves really.

Ve SMG for 2k, instigating,vats hit  ,faster reload lever 1500, AA ffr vats cost lever 2k, bloodied vats accuracy vats cost 44 pistol that I got for 8500 used it for a month and sold it for 17k.  Sometimes you get some steals
---
If youre on xbox ill tank for you to level you up and complete quests
---
I mean... their dedication to the idea of an RPG has been pretty consistent from Interplay, to Black Isle to Obsidian in my experience. And before Fallout was an FPS, it used to be an RPG, which was my interest in it. On a personal level, I didn't come to this franchise from Half Life or Halo, I came from D&amp;D and WoD, so sure, it's not going to be FO:NV2, but I can assume that if I decide to play a character a certain way, I will be able to play a different character a different way and have a different experience, which is what I want out if the RPG I am signing up for. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I don't have that problem, I'm a melee player. I have to occasionally dump steel because I have too much in my STASH.
---
Works just as well! :,) hope you guys have fun!
---
The Gamma? No, this morning, and I bought it just as they logged off the server. Was falling to the ground as the caps left my account and the yellow text came up.
---
Yeah but not in Adventure mode.
---
Armor piercing +15 vats +50 crit hunting rifle for 1250, I was stoked.
---
I killed one in the Civic Center this weekend. 3 star. It was upstairs at this exact spot:

wait ,you can play with music on? Lol .I never play with music on,I can barely hear the holotapes play in my pip boy as it is.
---
Found a tse .50 cal for 1500 caps a while ago, obviously I bought it.
---
If you kept killing the bots then high level gutsy bad guys would spawn and let's just say they missed the part about you being the mayor.
---
Have you never played a fallout game before the last two?
---
I'll probably just go to the airport
---
And the ones we thought we lost but came back again!  
---
I still check my bobbypins weight after installing a new patch 🙄
---
My dream character to play. A sassy-pants ghoul.

Titally agree. I could write many positive points for the raid but you generally get bullied here for having fun and little problems.

Oh the gutsy teams still spawn? Man they were brutal.
---
Won’t change you’re mind, because you are right.
---
I like the blinking light ahah
---
Dont fast travel.
---
Walk everywhere
---
They'll probably switch it to 760 or even 7600 when people start legitimately hitting it in a few years. The game will be near the end of its life cycle by then anyway, Atom Shop items won't be as valuable, if not already cleaned out by someone who's played that long anyway. They just don't want to encourage idling bots and can use it to track time played at the moment.
---
Hey P 👋🏻
---
That challenge has been bugged for a long time. I have killed the queen solo before they rebalanced her and didn't unlock. Many have since reported solo kills not counting.
---
In theory, just by assisting with the kills on the other big enemies does count and works. Therefore, I believe this challenge simply doesn't recognize you killed/assisted the SBQ.
---
LOL a drill would be epic. Maybe gold plated.
---
How much do you charge for berry mentats and how many do you have
---
While on chems, well fed, well tuned, and (of course) well rested.
---
I did not know that bug was from goddam Skyrim.  For Pete's sake, Bethesda, get your staff together.
---
I love showing up to Collision Course and an empty cargo drop falls out of the sky next to me. The lowbies look at me like, "where did that come from? Are we done?"
---
She likes you.
---
You can also run through Flatwoods and collect all the bloodleaf and soot flowers, make boiled water and craft healing salve. It’s an early recipe and it’s under utilized. 
---
The game thinks it’s a stimpak-diluted.
---
Whitesprings is the only place with large amount of Mr handy robots along with sentry bots.
---
S 10, P 15, E 3, C 4, I 8, A 15, L 1.
---
It's a sneak sniper build, so high Perception and Agility are beneficial. Strength are carry weight perks only, for Endurance I got Lead Belly, for Charisma Lone Wanderer, since I'm traveling solo 99% of the time.
---
Cranberry bog generally contains few dozens of those. 700 wood in 5 minutes is my typical route. Start from Ranger District Camp or sth like this.
---
FNV runs awesome on XB1. 
---
It's odd playing without mods or console commands but I recently started a FNV run on XB1 and so far I haven't crashed once. 50 hours so far. 
---
I do have one "stuck" side quest.
---
Ok
---
Well they took away Survival Servers
---
I don't think so. Line in the sand is a public event now and has about 1/15 chance of showing up in a hour. A nuke lasts 2 hours. 
---
There are way better places for particular type of flux &amp; enemies. Example: Whitesprings has a lot of Yellowcake &amp; Ghouls; The Velied *Sundew Grove*\-*Cranberry Glade*\-*Flooded* trainyard is excellent for Violet Flux (300+ easily visible).
---
I run events to stockpile them
---
My theory *was* that people prone to becoming ghouls without going feral quickly were more susceptible to the Scorched plague and became Scorched in Appalachia instead of friendly ghouls, but now that they're adding NPCs, I'll be surprised and hurt not to have any ghoul buddies.
---
Full strength for heavy gunner/melee
---
Perception 10 for commando and green thumb
---
Endurance 1 aquaboy
---
Charisma 3 travel agent and suppressor
---
Intelligence 5 stabilized, scrapper and first aid
---
Agility 15, sneak, full adrenaline and others
---
Luck 8, bloody mess, one gun army and starched
---
Sleep, seriously resting on a bed for a bit gives you an exp earn buff, cranberry cobbler does the same
---
No word yet. I’m guessing that it won’t come back. It doesn’t attract new players so there’s no reason for Beth to invest any time or money in it. It was for endgame players who had their gear and build groomed out.
---
I think it was just mentioned few days ago in the dataminer ama here. Search for the thread and check it out. And surprisingly I think it was only 20. That is what I remember being mentioned.
---
Im working forward to craft Excavators for others, so for me I've just collected punch of lightweight as possible unyielding I can switch into when I craft a bunch. 
---
My main chars int has always been high, 14 or 15. I think originally 15 but I downgraded one for some other special.
---
Long time ago when I crafted my Excavator Im still using, it didn't occur to me to boost it futher. However while since then I've started to use the PA always because of the huge increase in carry weight, over my previous system of using normal armor except looted T-60 in nuked zones, I have to repair an Excavator piece(just one) about average once per month. Previously I had to repair a T-60 piece maybe once a week. It wasn't a burder, but for whatever reason my Excavator is very durable, and I was already level 120 back then and I was using the 200% repair perk. 
---
It hardly ever breaks, so even going over 15 int is probably an overkill, unless Excavators are somehow significantly harder than say T51b which should be everyones favourite.
---
All chems are 10-15 each. All ammo is 1c each. That includes mini nukes and explosives too. Fresh out of berry ones though. Gonna go restock the machines tomorrow.
---
Yes they do.
---

perfect! ty vm!

going to safe that website. im happy they acknowledged. hopefully we dont have to wait that much for a fix.
---
It should be an unarmed only event. Otherwise, it gets too crazy. Skyrim had you punching people for quests and hiring purposes.
---
When hubby first got his game,  I did not want to play online. Now I’ve surpassed him in levels!  Have fun!  It’s so much better with someone you love ❤️
---
As others have mentioned the Forest is your friend when you're low on loot. There's like 8 first aid/chem kits in Flatwoods and the agricultural center. Use the pharma perk and hit the button (not sure what it is on PC) after opening the box.
---
Oh I think they are more about farming easy kills and loot from people unaware of how things work.
---
People who want actual PvP don't need workshop for it, althouigh it probably helps to draw people in.
---
Im not even trying to help reach that near impossible goal just for a damned purveyor sale. It would be different if it was for free atom shop items or something.
---
Theres allot of areas at the good springs golf club where ghouls cant reach you.  Use that to server hop and get xp.
---
Got a hunters explosive harpoon gun for 500 caps.

I need all the carry weight I can get so I had to build on strength and I am usually playing solo so I don’t need more than 4 points on Charisma. Essentially I use 2-3 different builds without swapping points. A punching melee build, a heavy weapons build and a two handed weapons build.
---
I hate the 50 cal i have.
---
Nah there's a few places I've seen strikebuster groups in the Ash Heap. Sentry and groups of Gutsy together. I also bumped into level 60 annilatator sentry bot last night too. Cranberry Bog somewhere. They spawn around NAR train yard randomly but it wasn't there.
---
They should reduce the weight of everything, and put every item that should be used into a quest to a weight of 0, like those circuits from the nuclear silos.
---
They should also scale the weight of things between Fallout 4 and Nuclear Winter; I think thats the best possible system.
---
This. The sledgehammer and that ultracite pistol. Combat rifles, however, have lost some market since Fixers became scrip available.
---
Just remember with Pharma Farmer you have to manually hit a button to search for the extra items
---
I use diluted and usually at least 1 sometimes full 3 levels of the int perk that boosts then. I have always way too much of them because diluted are so effective. I think your problem might be more about using them too much, than not finding enough.
---
Do you use the healing mutation ? I was using it for a while with one char and I really hated it, because it made even normal stimpacks so weak to use on actual spot whenever I needed healing in combat. Never again.
---
I use mostly rifles and sneak all the time so of course I don't receive that much damage anyway. I could imagine you might need more when you are using heavy weapons.
---
I would take a hunting rifle (BoS recon, if you don't have a nice legendary) to start the fight or snipe enemies.
---
But you need to compromise perks. If you run a 2h melee/revolver, you can have everything.
---
Stealth sniper here too, except my strength is 1 and my luck is a bit higher. Bloody mess, Tormenter, Super Duper, and Thru Hiker is nice to switch between.
---
Did you ever see the mom's do that in mass effect? It was creepy and funny at the same time.
---
It's exactly the same with the Red Dead Online subreddit. People are just way too lazy to search for 3 minutes. It's pretty idiotic.
---
On my old ex survival character ex pack mule now primary character my stash and inventory was gone before lvl 5.
---
i didnt think cross play would work with Mods on PC and console not having htat ability. Also the advantage some people may have with Mouse and Keyboard vs Controller.   Since everything is on the server i thought the easiest approach would be to just port a character over.
---
The bloatflys aren't hacking. That's the Bloatfly Larva syringer. Nuke mines are craftable and currently exploitable using the carry weight dupe
---
Like enable the safe as a special stashbox...
---
I only have problem when I use my Strangler Heart in combine with BE Gatling Plasma - there is so many particles to calculate all the projectile explosions with adding acid to all of it, that my game almost freezes. When I use my Primed BE .50 Cal there is no problem at all.
---
My only real issue with survival was the map markers for players. they should have had players marked on the minimap by the yellow quest circles so that it showed an approximate area a player is in, rather than  real time GPS coordinates as it was. That way you couldn't just FT to players exactly, but you still could find them if you wanted to.
---
Npcs coming in November, and a fully fledged quest line with it

New vegas did this and I loved it. Break down ammo to make differant ammo as long as you had the cases.
---
QE harpoon for 10k =]
---
It's actually the only one that doesn't, which is a clue in of itself if a Vault Dweller was smart enough to notice the gap in the station distribution or check official rail-line maps.
---
I've had magazines moved from the display rack back to my normal stash from time to time when I log back in. Bethbugs.
---
Every bloatfly you kill makes 3 more? I never saw that before. The spatulas just using the same exploit? His base was a floating one and he didnt go up. It just started raining stuff down. I didnt see anyone using syringers but it was a warfield so i could have missed it.
---
If you are using sketchy methods by anchoring on a friend, why not just use the friends?  I’ve helped so many of mine transfer.
---
I have been doing Raids since week one and going to the menu with 4 and jumping in together does help find a fresher server. I have also gone in with 4 and in the middle of the event my game has crashed. Do I think they need to make the raids easier no but the server instability in this game is insane. I have come to the point that I am not having fun sitting through 10 different load screens just to attempt a Vault. The first boss of the Raids is being able to start the damn event. We have loaded in go in the cave and the vault door doesn't open for someone so they have to sit through 2 load screens by exiting and enter the cave again. Yes that works but the door should open. When the doors are suppose to open when the event starts it has stayed closed before so now the team needs to jump to a new server. The game needs fixed. I feel like wastelanders is going to be a last effort to keep the game going or everybody will drop like flies and I don't blame them.
---
I don't know why you got rated down. You would spend far more than that in the wear'n'tear on your console/PC and the electric of keeping your PC on/awake all that time. Probably in the hundreds of dollars/pounds.

Your second ti is wasted, the engine doesn't scale with sli. I'm willing to look after it for you.

You've got threads to spare on the CPU and you won't be using much of your ram.

That reminds me i saw a maga camp today. Equality for all.

That is an important message. Keep up the education. 🦄
---
What perks cards do you use for weight carry? I’m in a similar boat.
---
I had this problem too when I was testing a new weapon.
---
Yeah, the music is great, but a while back I turned it way down because it was drowning out the sound of the Pannapictagraphist perk... Gotta say, the ambient sounds of the game are just right. Haven't gone back to the music.
---
It is great when you have a game to play in common. My ex-wife and me used to play EverQuest, World of Warcraft and Star Wars Galaxies together, back in the day. My new girlfriend, while great in her own ways, have no interest in computer games. It can be a lonely world, the Wasteland, but less so when you have somebody to share it with!
---
If 3 people shoot 1 bloatfly with syringers, it'll spawn 3 more. If you shoot each of those 3, there will be 9. The raining 'spatulas' definitely sounds like the throwable exploit
---
You what? The universal standard time is UTC... It's centered on Greenwich, London...

You probably only see everybody using East Coast time because you live there...

Wouldn't be the worst thing I've seen in a game world.

Make all SB legendary.
---
No¡!!!?!;;(++ Mirelurks are aquatics creatures designed by a mad scientist. Garthin are crack smoking lunitic wildest fantasy.
---
Not at all. Item condition is as good as what I've seen from other players (or even better), I don't use criticals or mutations and Legendary spawn rate/star numbers/effects aren't affected by Luck. It's a really pointless stat for my playstyle.
---
Bethesda’s “But you can have scrap kits too”
---
That's your opinion. The game is shit, and not worth buying full price. If people still want to try it out I'd suggest buying it used (I'm sure GS has plenty available)

Of course there is.

With the death of the SBQ and the vaccine for the survivors in the area, the plague was stopped from spreading.
---
Lol I am walking armory but I prefer melee so I carry very very little junk
---
well, I’m a collector. I had none. if I find another then I’ll sell. this one will uselessly and prettily on my stash.
---
Instructions unclear. Have no friends
---
You can also call for a courier to help.  Sometimes we are available for transfer, usually for a fee. Friends might do this for free however. As long as you trust whoever you use for transfer and agree to the terms, I’d go with that method.
---
Or the brotherhood! Ad victorium
---
Gamma gun. It's not like perks help it anyway :)
---
Seriously though, a gatling is solid.
---
Muahaha more downvotes, MORE!
---
It was mentioned in that thread by a non-dataminer that 
---
&gt;The crafting condition table maxes at Int 20, while the drop condition tables max at Luck 20. However, you can find and craft over-condition weapons, so the maximum permanent condition should be reached with much lower stats.
---
The answers are unclear by the data miners themselves.
---
They have legendary variants. I saw one while farming Morgantown
---
Please play the main story ... hint: Responders survived, Raiders survived,  the Free-State survived, and the Brotherhood survived(well, the last one was formed from surviving military personal), all in their own way.  
---
Everyone was basically killed because of the scorched plague or left the state.
---
And thats just the West Virginia area.
---
It aggros things you don't want.
---
I've got it on 2 characters, but taking it off. Ruins stealth, ruins instigating, etc.
---
Thats crazy, i didnt know that. I kept just running around deathclawing them untill it broke. Each strike popping more up. It felt like christmas. Xp and cap making machine.
---
This we can agree, brother of steel.
---
Do you have your SPECIAL numbers plugged into [Nukes and Dragons](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) so we can also see the perks/mutations you're using?
---
Much easier to exchange build strategy (the "why" component) using the N&amp;D link...
---
ty for the feedback. yes same here. using my .50 cal only troubles sorrounded players, not me. i could use it maybe with a gatling gun, dont know. energyweapons all the same because of many more projectiles. if someone uses a be plasma it can crash your game. happened with a friend, we had a crash at the same moment.  
---
i just wish i could use it all the time...
---
Depends on your definition of bug really. It's probable that the players weren't meant to see them, but it was also intentionally put there by the devs
---
100 lbs stash mechanism to transfer between your own chars would be really great.
---
S12, P1, E4, C5, I5, A15, L14

I’m running a vats shotgun build using a medics / explosive combat shotgun.

Everything you need to know..
---
https://youtu.be/1av-wwg2_dc
---
Why so much intelligence and endurance? Unless you’re running power armor you don’t need more than 5 for gunsmith.
---
It's very speculative what the spawn rates are, and open to massive bias.
---
However, it would be believable if bgs are gradually tweaking the number to try and keep player retention in a sweet spot.
---
Don't forget that you have to manually hit a button to use pharma farmer while looking in the container.
---
It is a counter, so you can track your in-game time. You are not supposed to reach it, just check it now and then so you know how much you have played. That why the reward is low. It is not a goal, it is just there.
---
Kept noticing I was very low on space all day yesterday, couldn't figure out why on the fly while farming nuke zones, the end of the day went thru my entire inventory and realized I have 54 stimpaks and 31 Super Stimpaks... I mean I know I can be ocd with picking up every single thing from every little corner of every room but damn, I only had 10 the day before lol. Apparently just search every inch of of a room before leaving it and you will be flowing in them lol.
---
yes ty! i remember that post where a dude wrote he just realised that after like 300 hours gameplay \^\^
---
I know most of the ultracite plans and any ultracite plans i get now go in my vendor from 12-15 caps.
---
Another bug? But, they fixed all those with the numerous updates.
---
They've only ever done bans to target item duping, and even then this appears to be a retroactive search on their player database to identify abnormal amounts of items in player inventories. Presumably they defined a threshold for a selection of items and banned players exceeding these.
---
Beyond this, there appears to be no anti-cheat.
---
There is some server-side position validation. You can see this by standing on the extreme edge of something (like a really thin branch on a dead tree) the server will snap you back a few seconds, because it incorrectly deems your position to be invalid.
---
Wow what uninformed lies, this is in the Alpha.
---
&gt;Im not even trying to help reach that near impossible goal just for a damned purveyor sale. It would be different if **the purveyor wasn't more RNG trash** or something. 
---
Fixed.
---
Nice one bro
---
Find a bunch of high level dudes doing a large event. Find some place to hide at the event and tag every mob that you possibly can. You're not even trying to do damage, really,  you just want to love tap everything so you get xp. 
---
I went from 29-33 in one event yesterday. I'm sure there are diminishing returns at your level but the XP in those things is Big Bertha approved.
---
Turn on your damage indicator, it's the only hard science we have to go on.
---
I’m not sure if you mean to come across as an ass but you are.
---
You remember the shotgun sound bug where the entire server could hear it firing whenever one was fired back on release of this game?
---
got a AAE handmade for 20K
---
Got a blooded explosive double barrel shotgun
---
Let's not forget the Fallout 4 quest with a bar fight in Diamond City, either.
---
But yeah, I agree. Unarmed would be best for this type of thing.
---
Ahhh I see, your primary build is melee, explains why your ammo stash is hoarded lol. I've never really bothered with melee yet, I always carry "all rise" with me but I'm mainly a rifle/shotgun build. I rely on my power armour far too much I think lol. I usually keep a good stock of .308 .44 .45 5.56 and shells (at least 2000 rounds each, it's makes me feel safe lol)
---
Is that a steal?
---
Doesn't matter to me, high damage resistance, the queen doesn't hurt me too bad
---
IMHO yes. Most go for 30K+ (was a three star with less AP cost)
---
If you have the Chemist perk, you can get 4 dilute stimpacks from 1 regular. If you’ve got SuperDuper, there’s a chance of even more. Also the First Aid perk makes stimpacks heal more.
---
I don't know about Survival, but I wouldn't call those weapons Legacy - none of them has anything that can't drop right now - it's only name of the item, that you can change by yourself.
---
Fixer Plan for 1000 Caps
---
He had two, I brought both, now both my characters might get Fixers from Mummbles
---
was debating with someone using facts and he have now deleted his post.
---
Wooow!!
---
Spend the 10# and keep a set of power armor with you.  
---
If you hit the overencumberred limit, put your PA on until such time you can get to a workbench or a stashbox.   In general, thats no more than 5-10 minutes depending on where you are.
---
Excavator with calibrated shocks will allow you to carry up to \~1720#.    
---
(Other PAs allow up to \~1420.)  You wont be able to FT with that much weight, but you can sprint.
---
No
---
That fake junk royal jelly &gt;spits&lt;
---
Yes! Let that thirst for revenge be the fire under your butt! Go level up a bit, maybe use a build planner, use it with PVP in mind, lots of good tips on the internet. Practice some PVP game mechanics, if you've got a friend in game you guys could really pick up a lot from each other by practicing on each other.(most pvpers I've met have done this) at the very least you will pick up enough to know how to not be sucker punched as easily. You've got nothing to lose! PvP is a really fun corner of the game once you don't fear it anymore. At the very least you'll be able to fend off workshop takers if roaming around looking for fights isn't your cup of tea. Good luck out there!
---
Random things I do not want to accidentally scrap at 25k and stored in the vendor for safekeeping. Ammo is 1 cap for reg, 2 caps for ultracite. Serums are 500. I only sell bloodied weapons for between 2k and 8k depending on the scarcity, and I only sell unyielding combat bos armor for 2k per piece. Bobbleheads and magazines are 100.
---
There is already a perk that reduces FT cost.
---
I’m going to add this to mine👍🏼
---
Git gud.
---
It's probable we are meant to see them and there was an explanation that was never included because they ran out of time.
---
For me:
---
Scorchbeast queen flies off around the map sometimes. Bug.
---
I can see a few vertibirds flying around in this corner of the map. Not bug.
---
Mate, how the fuck did you know? I got into that habit when I was farming for level 100.
---
Wow really? I have one in my stash, don’t actually use it anymore
---
Sell on trading groups on social media to get the most out of it, let them bid and you will be very surprised
---
I didn’t even realise I had the fixer plan, where does it drop? 
---
Got a sweet +perception, executioners FFR fixer from Murmmlpjhsysbsnnsn
---
Healing Factor mutation and diluted Stim packs, Born Survivor or Auto Stim Armour pieces are a waste of stimpacks with a Bloodied build. 
---
Also Evasive (in Agility) is good. I use that during the day time and swap it for Mister Sandman at night.
---
I probably have the best "food builds" on PC.

---
Best perk in the game? Ordnance express. The last two chars were to be just high level mules to do scrip and carry my explosive ammo, but they quickly outgrow their roles. Charisma tree is so unappriciated. Originally when I started playing, I though my endgame would be teaming up with other randoms, and sharing useful perk cards with high charisma. 
---
But eventually I learned you can only share one card :( And all those "raiders" doing everything they can to drag people into PvP to steal their stuff, so it eventually became impossible to team up with randoms, and I quit trying.
---
Bloodied 10% dmg and 60 dr on aim gatling gun: 2000 caps. My new farming gun.
---
Also the bug where an invisible invincible Sentry bot keeps attacking me dispite having killed and looted the body!
---
I lol'd. this has happened. sometimes a bat and a damn cargo drop start following me. it's kinda funny though
---
Encrypted
---
Yeah it would be good, but I suspect that people would start to get bored with just punching the rival. Otherwise, a good option would be to implement an option for wanting a punch fight. What do you think?
---
Will have a look, thanks.
---
Bro I can't even get my friends to play galaxies lol, I salute you
---
Yeah that's probably fair actually.  I don't run bloodied but I'd imagine it's very risky with all the rads though.
---
Ah thanks, not done that one for a while.
---
I have run the Raids more than I would like to say. I am 6 steel away from completing my standard armor. I have already built my PA. This weekend we were in the middle of a standard run and it was a cake walk. One room away from opening the GECK and my game crashes. The server stability is just demoralizing. This week we want to complete the raid on expert and we will have completed them all on expert. I just dont know if I have the patience anymore. Like I said on my other post the first boss is just getting into the vault and making sure the server is stable.
---
I love seeing posts like this! I used to bombard my girlfriend with Fallout lore tidbits even at the time when we first met, but with Fallout 76, I was so happy to get to share a piece of the universe and the next "chapter" (if you will) in the franchise with her! We both play frequently now and recently went on a scavenger hunt to complete her teddy bear and Mr Fuzzy plushy collection! We're waiting eagerly for the arrival of Wastelanders! Can't wait!
---
True, but in power armor, which you pretty much have to use it wasn’t so bad
---
I messaged their customer support and literally got “try power cycling your PS4.”
---
like wtf this isn’t a hardware issue???
---
I have not killed and but there again I am only level 104.
---
It would be AWESOME if they had the plans tied to account rather than toon, so that I could build them in camp on a different character.
---
No radio is the only way to play.
---
Oh I assumed you'd be using unyielding sentinel armour on bloodied. Do you use power armour often or just for the vault?
---
The flux dissapears from your inventory when you die right after the queen fight, Mr Queenkiller. Nobody is stealing it.
---
I never use power armor, but as soon as I started getting 49rads/s I put it on.
---
Where do you get your ammo? Can't craft effectively without super duper?
---
Fallout Tactics do have Ghouls that join your party that you can directly control!
---
Or maybe a boxing style event with just punching, and another event kinda like the Nuka-World Guantlet fight that could just be one random weapon (each player gets that same one) and fight to the death.
---
Cal .50 rounds are ridiculously cheap to craft, especially with Ammosmith in Agility. And they're pretty much the only caliber I use.
---
I never carry those, but friends have told me it does, and also includes Plasma Cores.
---
I see him every damn day lol.
---
Yes it is fair to say that I know most are claimed for resources. It is also fair to say that I leave most alone. Fair as well to say that I don't play like your average workshop contester. I contest the ones that get my attention. I'm not going to pretend I'm policing some kind of policy because that would just be silly. 
---
I contest workshops that appear to have been claimed and left abandoned either as fast travel points or (hopefully) wanting pvp. I contest workshops when one person has more than they appear to be able to maintain. I contest workshops in the mire owned by low levels screwing up the spawn levels for everything in the zone. I give them a chance to walk away. I contest workshops of specific names that I know. I toy with workshops used by those attempting to game the system. 
---
Got me fresh out of bed, this reads like a Dr Seuss post I think.
---
X01 has much higher DR, ER, and RR. (458/513/513 vs excavators 300/300/426)
---
If mining or, excavator gives you 2x the amount.  It also lets you carry more weight.  I can carry up to 1720# in exavator before I can no longer sprint.
---
T51 and X01 sprint limit is 1420.
---
==
---
My build is for 1H melee, weapon of choice is a vampire switchblade. most enemies are dead before health gets too low, but for that, I have healing factor mutation.  Rough translation there is in excavator, the WS golf club swarm may take me down to about 30% health before I kill them all.  Once they are gone, healing factor activates - back to full health :)
---
I ran excavator from L45 to about L132.  I did more than one SBQ in excavator, as well as IDK how many WS nuke runs in same.   "upgraded" to T51 for about 10 levels, then switched to X01.
---
Nothing wrong with T51, just wanted to try out X01.
---
Fusion Cores weighing 3 weight x 45, that is 135 weight! HOLY CRAP I would love to have that much free stash space. I just got mine down to 750 but that is after I have thrown away so much of my junk
---
Contrary opinions can be very helpful for these sorts of posts, but only if you explain what you don't like (e.g. still encountering specific bugs, lack of appeal of endgame loop, friends stopped playing, etc).
---
I love the absolute shit out this game. Way more time spent on it than any other fallout title.
---
Usually turn music off on bethesda games fairly early. 76 in particular has great atmospheric noises.
---
Explosive tesla, 300 caps
---
Can you share your heavy weapons and 2h weapon builds?  I'm looking to alternate like that as well.
---
Farming Bloatflies in a Blast zone is the best, you can get enough Flux Stabilizing materials to last for weeks from one 30 minute session.
---
Undeniable. Solid proof for me yes, as in the first time I encountered it I stalked/watched for over an hour as the person crouched their main all over the map and logged the second account on and off to do exactly what I described. I even tested the waters by claiming certain ones and sure enough they came to check it out. 
---
Solid proof for others no. I don't have video, I'm not going to post names of accounts despite having them noted for myself to keep an eye out for.
---
Good Idea.
---
What about those who legitimately got the rare ones and want the rarity to mean something?
---
They did however add a dedicated 100% PvP focused mode.
---
Yeah, even the switch from medium to low makes rock surfaces look smooth. Almost unplayable.
---
I never play music when I play games with good OSTs
---
Didn't most of the survivors just migrate because of the scorched?
---
These kits are worthless if youre stash is bursting at the seams.
---
I’m upgrading from a GTX 1050 to a 1080 - I’ll see what NVidia optimises the game to. . .
---
um....not sure...  I don't look at my PSN name often - I know its spelled out... maybe its not hyphenated?    aj ninetyeight
---
You can't open VATS if you are not hostile to the Sentry Bot.
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
I've been playing since the E3 sale, and I haven't turned on the radio since I bought the game. I love the immersion
---
I‘m unable get my girl to play it, the only game she likes is mario kart (she‘s so damn good at it).
---
The problem is that I cant explain why I like fo76 so much, it has no story and no goal. She once watched a queen fight and I had to admit, that its been a pretty boring fight...
---
I should have mentioned, I think it's a "holding area" where they go when they're unused. It means they don't need loading when they are needed. This is why I suspect it's not meant to be seen
---
I've found a couple of pieces but some are duplicates, I keep seeing Leader of the Pack pop up but didn't think it was my level, I'll give it a go next time, thanks 😁
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
Yep, xbox. That would be amazing, I'm happy to pay or trade in exchange! I'll add you later when I'm back from work.
---
I agree that there's no need for a nerf, but I'm still seeing lag across the game. Waiting for terminals is not my idea of fun.
---
But also talk about a refugee.
---
I'll give leader of the Pack a go. I've been doing feed the people and the event in Flatwoods when they pop up 😁
---
I had legacy prime meats about two week after the meat week ended, because I didn't play the first week after, and they expired in about week after I started playing again.
---
I have legacy mutant sludge because I've heard you can no longer keep it when doing the event. Legacy this, legacy that. 
---
It's just a stupid buzzword. People even call doubles legacy which they strictly speaking are, even though the number of players who want to collect them, are pretty small. 
---
Yet no one seems to be trading the super-legacy broken assultron heads with incorrect legendary effects, because their primary effect was completely removed making major a prime, and minor a major. Hurr hurr.
---
As far as your legacies, just like everyone else is doing, call them whatever you like. As Bethesda ran most of them twice I think, somehow I suspect they will keep using them are prices later events or quests too.
---
Which one do you have?
---
One.
---
Gotta know when to hold em, and know when to fold em.
---
I like the idea so I can leave some known plans or whatever for other players to take because I feel bad about throwing them away. Although if anything changes with stash it will most likely just be a straight increase again.
---
Thanks owl_no - I'm on xbox else I would have popped by. I've been checking people's vending machines but all that I seem to come across so far are plans for camp items.
---
I really don't know if you are being sarcastic, because internet. 
---
And to be honest, I thought you were gonna show something funny or game related.
---
If it was a laser or plasma gun I've had the ash or goo piles disappear infront of me and appear under my feet like I dropped a bag. It is a bit disorientating.
---
If its any consolation, when it stripped all my frames it left me horribly overweight.
---
Would not let me reassemble, and everything was destroy on drop.
---
Ended up destroying a full set of both raider and T45 before my weight got below limits.
---
I only have the normal ones. I'm just speaking for the few players that did get a rare mask. If they were duped out must've not been very much. I have 700 hours in and I've never saw a rare mask.
---
What are you, 7 years-old girl? Lol what kind of idea is that?? Seriously??
---
Two.
---
Til
---
I have 8, I'm still waiting for my X-01 to break for the first time. 6 month old power armor, used only in Scorched Earth. 
---
Looks like a second hand ad.
---
This is at least game related and also positive
---
Haha yeah that's fair
---
We'll find out later today when they post the final update.
---
My boyfriend was already a super high level also when I first started, but he created a new character to play with so we could do everything together. I think it made my gameplay much better that he was the same level.
---
This idea would be cool but I'm hoping they release new masks instead of the ones we already could get.
---
Not only would it make the unobtainable still rare it would bump up the price of last year's obtainable ones
---
I love repair kits, have over 100 and never bought a one.
---
Fuck, i didnt even think about this. Thanks!
---
I just wish there was a better way to group. I'm not a clan guy, but I would like to find groups in game for the raid.  When they first came out, you could just wait for a group in the start area, but after those characters got wiped, even pinging everyone on a server cant get you a team.
---
My girlfriend just likes to explore houses and loot anything that isn't nailed down, so I suppose just casual gameplay is the key in our case :D
---

Well I am a bit overwealmed with this community, in a good way ofc. Not only a person (who wishes to remain anonymous) gave a Plasma Grenade Plan to Fackie, for him to give to me (which I did get), but Mr.drama also gave me one plan, even though I already had one. I did explain to him before the "transaction" that I had received one, but I also told him that there was another friend of ours who also quested for that Plan, quite a bit, so he said something like "well, I am giving you the Plan, what you do with it it's your call".

People like this make me treasure this game and its community. I am proud to be a part of this "gang".

BE 10mm pistol for 3800c. A few 2 and 3 star weapons for under 300c, though they were only scrip worthy but at that price, yes please!
---
It's a battle Royale. NW is playing a sports game, open PvP like survival is kicking the ball around. They aren't the same even if the activity seems similar.
---
That's possible because there is a hidden nuke off the map for that reason but that doesn't make sense to have a whole bunch of them. They'd have 1 bot sitting somewhere stationary doing  nothing (like the nuke).
---
There is a load of them actively flying around and that makes me think there's a reason they are gathered but we haven't found out why yet.
---
If you are lower level, the 1st aid kits in the hangars at morgantown airport, especially the ones around the cargobot drop.  
---
If you are high enough level, do a circuit at WS.  Most of the critters drop a stimpack, radaway, and/or radx, or a diluted version thereof.
---
I looted everything when I did that run, and excavators high weight limits let me just keep picking stuff up.  At one point, I had around  300 each of the above items.
---
Needs team matchmaking
---
It’s all level 5-15 legendary gear
---
So you think giving an incentive to raid bases in survival mode is a stupid idea? Cheer up mate, having a bad day are we lol?
---
God that was a hard quest line. It made me actually sad where I had to just turn off my computer for the day.
---
Starving. Hungry. Famished. 
---
Taking a workshop is like waving an open can of pork n beans in front of a starving wastelander. The aroma of fresh meat can be smelled across Appalachia!
---
Got a QE Harpoon gun from the legendary vendor last week, so fun.
---
Yea it’s like they just want someone to say, “this game is great, you’ll love it, drop everything and go get it!” Just so they can in turn say, “idk... I heard there were bugs...”! It’s literally the same conversation every time.
---
Research! And they called you a madman!
---
I am using Traveling Pharmacy(3S), Bandolier (2S), Bear Arms (1S), Batteries Included (3I) and Thru-Hiker (3A). This way I can carry everything I need with me and free stash space for all the 3\* legendaries I am selling.
---
But you can drop nuke mines and spatulas without a bag, had someone do it at my camp
---
Yeah I’m constantly in excavator due to junk.
---
Vanguard, 25 Rad resist, harder to detect while sneaking for 1500c.
---
Sharing something with other player in online can’t work.. in real world too. There’s reason they don’t do things like that. Not funny, not needed, not wanted.
---
Which ones are rare?
---
Looks like they have some team-based Charasima cards to swap for it.  Lone Wanderer is one of the most useful perks for anyone not in a party, so great for everyone to swap in while running solo.
---
This game could've been sooooo good. I'm genuinely sad by it really
---
Use pack rat 3 and an armor piece with junk weight reduction. You won’t have to worry any longer about junk weight.
---
Destroy\*
---
I think that means with 20 int, you have max durability item(highest bar lenght in pixels) 2x so it's 200%. 
---
But anything over 100% is pointless since the repair perk gives you 200% anyway, so the max bar lenght would be reached by lower int than that 20. That's how I would interpret that. Would it even imply the max 100% durability is just with int 10?
---
So that would explain why my Excavator I crafter with just naturally high int is so durable, it's probably as durable as technically possible. When I craft more with unyelding boosts, if I see significantly different results, I will post it at least on the market subreddit. With 5 unyelding armor I can easily get my main to about 45.
---
Seriously. Ppl need to learn to crouch.
---
It happens often. Dedicated ambushers wait until you are busy with your first defense and join the attack. I just abandon the conflict zone and my high DR does the rest.
---
Still 2hours to kill!
---
They do seem very similar to me but again I do not PvP. Maybe the difference is less obvious to the 'untrained eye'.
---
Either way quite a bit of effort has gone into PvP since release, just doesn't seem to 'take'.
---
Maybe with factions coming with Wastelanders they will get it right.
---
What are you talking about? im talking about a box which can be accessed by anyone? loads of online games have it, even already in Fallout, like the supply crates in Nuclear Winter, they can be accessed by multiple players at once and display the same inventory. 
---
So you're saying in real life 2 people cant look into the same box lol. i think you need to step outside...
---
Tbh I buy 90 percent of my games used so either way I would agree with that part of the statement. If you do that you can get the no questions asked warranty.
---
You confused the wild "raider", they don't know what it means to share, and give freely, they only take, and grief folks.
---
Go to whitesprings, put on PA (for carry weight), and run the circuit.  Loot everything.  At the end of the route, goto blackwater and take out all the mole miners hanging around outside. 
---
 Then go to the train station vendor.  You should have at last 2 legendary items.  Decide whether to keep or scrip them.  Sell the junk items and weapons to the bot vendor. (or go inside the resort proper if you need to repair your armor)
---
By the time you get done with that, its a good bet everything has respawned.   
---
Do it again.  You'll get lots of XP, and likely, hit the daily cap limit as well.
---
Bonus if its nuked - XP is even higher.
---
None.
---
I dont know coding, but wouldn it be possible to have a separated stash accessed only at our base? 
---
so it would be saved at our end, and it would be saved/loaded when we load/exit the game. so if you want to have 100 pounds of extra gear know that it would need yr data and time. sorry if it sounds stupid. I’m an old timer and coding seems difficult to me.
---
I don't even know what the rare and normal masks are!
---
I missed the event last year. But I bought the owl, so I’m good to boogie.
---
Like pocketed armour?
---
Check player vendors, I have my camp on a acid vent and I sell bulk acid, whatever I don’t use my self goes up for sale $$$
---
Nope its a legendary effect only on 3* armor
---
Yeah, one of the event challenge rewards is a limited duration 50% off sale in the atom store.  
---
I'm not seeing where my comment is sowing discord unless they went back to the old style challenges or ramped atom rewards.
---
I have reactive plates on mine. I love seeing low level melee enemies keep hitting me and watching their health melt away.
---
Im like keep hitting me you regret it.
---
Just do what everyone else does and put unwanted stuff in a suitcase at the train station. 
---
I know you’re looking for something permanent that you can access later, if there’s anything left, but we all have to just let go sometimes.
---
I would love a rare one. I know on Xbox, the winter man mask was duped to no end a few months back. People were giving them away for free but now they're rare again.
---
What?
---
Your MSM is about to run 100 miles with this
---
Honey beasts, Wendigos, and Camden park dailys.
---
No problem, you could be right, its just that Fallout 76 is an obvious toe in the water survival game, and in all the other survival games ive played, raiding another players base and accessing their stash is an element that i enjoy, it would be unfair to totally raid their personal stash which is why i thought a smaller seperate stash might be a good addition.
---
Well, it was back in the days when it was new and my ex-wife was a super star wars nerd, bless her (we are still great friends, even though divorced). Man, it was great for its time back then, groundbreaking up till the point when they tried to make it a WoW clone and broke the game.
---
Nice I’ll check it out have to say I’ve been ignoring legendary armour.
---
The total number of the uncommon and rare masks that dropped was less than 10. The Skull, Goblin and Jester masks were uncommon and the Sun and Winter Man masks were rare, according to the files uncommon was even less of a chance dropping than rare.
---
Three weeks ago I found three Fixer plans for 35 caps each in a player vending machine. 
---
Easiest 105 caps I’ve ever spent and yes, I sold them in my machine for a wee bit more...
---
Cant you sell them for 0caps? I sell my 38s for 0 and usally drop off other unwanted low level stuff at morgan town. Gave two low levels full power armour but they couldnt use the armour just yet but they was so stoked to have a frame and shit at level 3
---
It gave me mixed signals if I'm honest.
---
Context to prevent confusion, I understand "Durability" being the length of the CND bar, Forceful stocks for example length rifle CND bars but Condition being how much of that bar is filled, which can be double filled for 200% repair.
---
In Crafting, I was under the impression that INT effected the Durability. When finding weapons "in the wild" then both Durability and Condition was based off of LCK.
---
The statement gave me the impression (Confusion), that if you have high enough INT then for repairs you might not need Weapon Artisan or Fix it Good.
---
I will attempt to test tonight, I've got a good stock mats and my main is also a crafter.
---
Difference is they can't use op gear to overwhelm opponents and are closer to equal footing.
---
I agree it would be awesome
---
Some time ago I bought an Instigating Handmade from a player vendor for under 1000 caps. Have not used another weapon since.
---
I’d appreciate some kind of “community” chest we could build. I could store access water there and some of the junk that’s not valuable enough to sell but some players still might find useful, like my 1000 units of cloth.
---
I really hope for change with probability of those drops (common ones probably have all who wants them), but I would like to get rare ones (Sun, Skull, Jester, Goblin) for collectors purposes.
---
there is no way 50% off doesnt happen IMO
---
No as if theres more legenedaries then theres more chances of you getting what you want and having no reason to play or pay for future atomic shop scrip kits!
---
1k for the fixer plan?!? Are you broken?
---
vending machine with items priced at zero. mark it free with the small letters. thats what i do and it works great. i know that doesnt fix the stash weight issue, but my machine is so regularly cleared out nothing takes up space for long, often less than an hour.
---
Yup, it was meant to happen regardless of how many scorched we actually killed.
---
Thanx, I will try it out soon ..
---
Not everybody agrees with that. There are those of us who want to use whatever gear we have worked for since beta. I don't care that others have bought their gear. 
---
Having said that, I respect that there are people who want a perfectly even playing field. It would appear that people like myself who were perfectly content playing survival 7 days a week are in the minority and I can accept that.
---
It was mainly for bloodied builds tbh
---
Decent price on PC. Not a steal though. I would assume he is playing on PC.
---
It hasn’t been said and nor is it guaranteed, but if they can bring back human npcs they can certainly bring back ghouls, so i wouldnt be surprised.
---
ikr i almost never play with music on!
---
Been saying this! Maybe just get a chance to full respect once any time after level 50.
---
Attend every Scorched Earth event that occurs. Tag every single thing on the ground, when there's nothing on the ground shoot the big bat.
---
Yeah you can get a pretty decent haul of black titanium from them. Plus steel. I get at least 25 or so by just doung Uranium Fever one time. Blackwater mine has a bunch outside (inside too) and Welch is another good spot for mole miners. Both have vendors and benches nearby. Plus, experience points!
---
I feel like it's not going to fulfill the hype unfortunately.
---
What exp nerfs?
---
But yes, respecing should be reworked, even if we have to pay 500-1000 atoms for a reset.
---
That's actually genius. Have the upvote, sir.
---
If they dont they're China
---
Rad suit?
---
Sorry can not remember the armor name.  There is a quest also to make some good chems with rad resist in the mire as well. Maybe a combo.
---
Never really seen anyone without PA in nuke zone honestly
---
I’ve never tried the prototype hazmat but, like this guy said, I would think that would be your next best option.
---
There is no High RR armor that is not PA. The highest you could get is afaik scout with lead mod, but it's still under 200 RR.
---
I have some really bad news for you. I wanted to do the same. You can't, not really. Even if you get your resist as high as physically possible with legendary resist, armor bonuses, drugs, and perks, you still can't match the hidden rad resist in PA. It's Rad Suit or PA in zones at this time. You can survive a little, but you'll be burning through radaway like nobodies business.
---
I'm planning to dial back on 76 to play Outer Worlds. But once I finish that, there's Death Stranding coming out. The Last of Us 2 is not too far behind.
---
And of course, when Cyberpunk 2077 comes out, all other games are dead.
---
Same. Being able to hear which direction sounds are coming from is handy, too.
---
Literally had no idea this was happening?? Why do they suck at announcements.
---
False
---
Perhaps in its early stages but post damage cap it was dominated by full health builds.
---
Mainly the Nuke sites Glowing Ones EXP nerfs, I mean it's been a while but still doesn't help if you want to make a drastic change to your build Melee &gt; Gun, etc.
---
Even if they took all the gear away the player with more practice/experience with PVP mechanics is going to beat the other player. Don't underestimate your opponent by assuming it's just gear. We certainly don't.
---
While Trapper, Robot, and Marine Armor all have built-in rad resistance, you'll *never* get to a comparable level to Power Armor or the Hazmat Suit because they have a hidden buff that actually gives them well over the stated \~1,000 RR.
---
That said, you can work with a Hazmat Suit if you take some perk card-based defenses, like Ironclad, Barbarian, and Evasive.  The same things that help Bloodieds avoid damage, like Lone Wanderer, Serendipity, and Dodgy all come into play as well, even if you aren't a low-health build.
---
I'm running all besides empath, carnivore and herbivore. It's fun but I dislike how often I have to consume food and drink.
---
Basically why use a Shotgun when you're already in Melee range.
---
Oh nice, thats cool, might have to try and find a static container too!
---
I got to my daily scrip limit thanks to a player who had 1* armour and weapons for like 70/80caps. Just got 100 more scrip to get so i have 1000 for the sale in a couple of days!
---
I'm still waiting for them to fix the 'every enemy in the vicinity randomly drops dead for no reason' bug.
---
Too many times to count..happened on the queen too...smh
---
I'll be honest, I don't really think you're going to get much out of any gun if you don't build for it.
---
Dude survival was the best! I lived there too! Now I'm homeless
---
From what I understand there was a rarity that dropped to one guy. One only! That’s rare!
---
Its not a hack and there have been no confirmed hackers on console for fo76.
---
How do you play for 8 hours a day?
---
What do you do the whole time?
---
I have 1000 almost and I'm pretty bored
---
I used to sell 1* legendaries all the time for like 100-200 caps. Didn’t really care too much for doing a crazy build or anything so I just kept the ones I liked
---
That's crazy, but gives us something to grind the event for though
---
Yes it’s the hazmat suit or PA... I’m a non PA user so tried a few times with the hazmat... which removes all armor so you’re basically naked regards DR/ER, it’s just annoying that the hazmat suit can’t be worn with your usual armor. 
---
So now for SBQ I only join when people place nuke so you can fight the queen just outside the blast zone.
---
No to companions mainly due to the fact that the game can't really handle it.
---
What do you mean?
---
As if I would ever share my teddy bear collection with my wife. Psh.
---
Yes def makes a difference
---
They made them heavy to keep people from hoarding them, it was in a recent patch.
---
I could but they'd be taking up space in my stash still and take up space for stuff I could actually want to sale.
---
Traveling Leather Coat for 1,000 caps. It is now my everyday outfit along with the Assault Gas Mask.
---
How high damage resist do you have? I've got 400 dr and er without PA and thats full vanguards with 1 chameleon piece. The chest is light, and I'm looking to beef up my resists even more. In PA I think its like 450 DR but the queen still wrecks me in a few hits.
---
3 fixer plans for like 1,500 each
---
Fair. Mine usally goes with the first person to come into camp. Go back to the vault when new players come out and drop a bag for em
---
Yeah, those are good deals.
---
I’ve got 7 or 8 on right now (without looking I don’t remember exactly.  Whenever I accidentally pop a rad-x I feel like I’m moving in molasses.  Would not want to go back to playing without them, as a melee build.
---
Does anybody know the prices for the common mask.  I should sell a couple extras so people have them for hollowed.
---
Perhaps not only event quests, but misc quests, as well: https://guides4gamers.com/fallout-76/quest/clear-watoga-civic-center/
---
Running 3 right now with 2 points in the perk that helps with negative effects. Works nicely
---
Marsupial
---
Health regen
---
Eagle eye
---
Speed demon
---
Keep plenty of food and water handy.
---
It means that "close enough" is only considered a success while playing horseshoes or throwing hand grenades.
---
While I have no fucking idea how the game of horseshoes is scored, I'm assuming you only need to be closer to the peg than the other person, you don't have to actually hit it (so "close enough" is all that you need) and well, I'd assume hand grenades are a bit more obvious, it's often left off, so most people will just say "close only counts in horseshoes" (which makes it far less obvious in meaning, because who the fuck is out here teaching everyone the rules of horseshoes?! We all know "throw thing that goes boom, as long as you hit close to your target, you're gonna fuck their day all up")
---
Dont use Rad X with them
---
I've only invested into it with a rifleman and it definitely makes a difference. Unless things have changed and I just have not noticed, the explosive damage is represented by a separate number that is for some reason often hard to see. It is either above or below the primary damage number.
---
I realize it's likely not the case, but sometimes I quietly wonder if the SBQ's attacks are shown coming toward you when, in reality, they actually connect to everyone.
---
Definitely, the one who does the most damage draws her aggro, but I swear there are times when I'll be \[Hidden\] and crouched before I've even attacked her, and somehow, she sonars me anyway.
---
I've heard Demo 5 adds 12% damage. I purchased an AAE Harpoon Gun, with the Flaschettes mod, in a player vendor for 12,345 caps last night and the damage increase with Demo 5 appeared to be 35%.
---
I've got 8 at the moment, and everything is going well. I never pick up Rad-X anymore, simply because I don't want to accidentally suffer for a time period.
---
Awesome! My gf and I play Fallout76 all the time as well! She’s finally catching up to me in the story so we will be doing quests side by side as I’ve already been helping her with them. She loves the camp stuff as well, we have to much fun spending time decorating and building our camps. Now I just gotta show her the perk to craft her own ammo cause I’m about out of resources! On a side note I’m happy that you and your gf get to spend time enjoying a great game together!
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ah5g3z/max\_possible\_xp\_boost/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ah5g3z/max_possible_xp_boost/) a little dated now but a good reference.
---
I would add gut shroom soup to that list because mats are very easy to find in a high-level zone (the burrows).
---
Oh good to know! Thank you! I’ll be on the lookout
---
&gt; even if we have to pay 500-1000 atoms for a reset
---
That actually sounds like a quite realistic price, ESO already sells a similar feature for 700 crowns, and the value of crowns and atoms is comparable. It would be against the fundamental business model of the game to let players skip a large amount of grind in a way that is not monetized.
---
xbox live being down last night was a total bummer here, I hope you all slayed your hearts out

You’d think so, I wonder if that’s a glitch?
---
In a vendor machine?  I didn't know u could sell those in your vendor, neat
---
Im all for people playing how they want to play but we should have more control of who we want in our camp. Although dropping the floor on a griefer is pretty funny lol. Ive used flamethrower traps and radiation emitter traps but i worry about innocent casualties
---
Honestly, they need to give you better perks when you're leveling up, when you're a low level you're getting alot of useless perks. I'm finding it out on my second playthrough and it makes sense that my build was horrible the first go round. If you want a good build youll have it ready between 50-70 if you plan it out. But if you dont, you'll be moving stuff around a ton
---
Raids are unavailable a few hours before they change the raid rotation on Tuesdays. Im afraid you're just gonna have to wait.
---
Oh, the mass suicide thing. It is annoying as hell.
---
Yea didn’t think that far into it. Haven’t played with a real need for them in a while outside of occasional SBQ fights that use them all so I don’t have to stash.
---
The next time Fasnacht comes back there will definitely be changes to it. We've seen the feedback on the event and will incorporate it for the next round! :)
---
There's a questline waiting for you in Watoga involving the mayor's office. You probably already have the quest in your log.
---
I really like the booth the whitespring station vendor is in. That would be neat if I could have a robot in a similar booth instead of vending machines. ***IDEA Maybe the bot could also facilitate player trades!? 2 players load items into the bots inventory - both hit accept - bingo. Trade is done! Otherwise items go back to players inventories
---
I would think you could get 5k a piece for the faschnaut  plans just based on their rarity. What are the offers!!?? I must know the highest offers on these!!
---
With ap reduction that one is certainly worth at least 30k... the duped one with faster vats fill is worth much less than one with less ap cost
---
I wish my fallout tattoo was alot better. It looks like poop, but it was also my first tattoo. The lines on the sword are uneven. But, it's the Outcast symbol. If I was in the wasteland and was in the brotherhood, I would have been outcasted also, so I relate to them. I'd want to stick to the cause.
---
She's actually made her PC so resembling to Nora while having never played FO4 whatsoever that I started doubting she has never actually played it ahah
---
Anything not locked is fair game. Some players like to leave them open for guests since they refill so fast. If you feel bad next time just take what you need and leave some for the next guy. Maybe buy something from their vendor as a thank you.
---
Drat, yep I'm wrong.  With the first one being purveyor I thought the max stretch goal was atom shop discount.  TBH it seemed reasonable to entice folks to buy atoms.
---
Didn't you read the patch notes? They fixed it. /s
---
At that point just buy atoms... you can use all that money you will save on electricity for not running your PC for 316 days 24/7.
---
Okay, so the basic understanding here is that Workshops are PvP areas, Okay thanks for the clarity, I don't follow online communities a lot so I didn't know it was the "PvP only area". In my opinion, having PvP in a game that allows for such unfair matchmaking isn't acceptable, this is my opinion and I'm entitled to it.
---
Unlike a lot of other gamers, I play games to enjoy, be immersed and rarely ever "farm" or "grind" because the point of playing a game is to enjoy it not do chores, for me anyway. Fallout 76 is a decent game and I enjoy the solo experience but with no one really willing to RP (instead of XP farming, go figure) and a complete lack of matchmaking in PvP areas, meaning players like me (I am not low level, I just don't "build" to fight other players in a stupid arena, If i wanted to do that I would play Overwatch or COD or something). I play Fallout to Role Play, because you know, it's a Role Playing game by nature.
---
I guess Fallout 76 isn't a Role Playing game. Fallout 4 (unmodded) barely was. Over the years Fallout has died to me and I've moved to the Metro series (specifically, Exodus) to scratch my Post Apocalyptic immersion itch, even if it's not even an RPG (ironic, right?).
---
Thankfully, modded Fallout 4 is still pretty fun. I will probably play 76 again and just stay away from the workshops, which is a shame because it's even less stuff for me to do. Shrug.
---
True half my perk slots are used to reduce weight of everything so i can have more space i made my character basically a pack mule as a build but even then im still full of stuff. Its not fun to have more than half your perks dedicated to reduce weight because the game stash is extremely low.
---
No, but I only played 2 and 3. Sounds creepy though.
---
You did nothing wrong - if owner wouldn't like to share it, he would lock it. I have my purifiers always open for everyone.
---
TSE Gauss rifle for 1k, Vamp FFR 25LVC Tesla for 3k, TSE 10MM sub for 100c, multiple pink asylum uniforms for 100c, Uny Sent Strength Scout leg for 900c, BFFR 25LVC western for like 1k, multiple scout masks for around 400c, lots of BE/AAE Pistols for under 1k. can't keep track of all the great items I find, but it's usually a few a day from vendor/server hopping
---
I have no idea what you’re babbling about but it’s still coming across like you’re an ass clown.
---
Yup it’s a known problem. I have personally filed a ticket before on that.
---
Sounds "fun". More activities ruined by overly aggressive gamer brats\~ Just have a PvP server and a PvE server, don't mix them. What If I want to do make a cool base and defend it from the mobs? Yet another thing I can't do because I will be OHK by a "try hard".
---
I've got 7 in so I can equip demo + science to craft pulse grenades &amp; mines.
---
It's kinda a pain. I know I could get a second copy of demo at 3 and a copy of science at 1, but I'm in the process of changing my build around so I'm throwing levels at that.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning
---
Great news. Since I have your attention, any word on the damage bug which results in enemies regenerating partial health after each shot?
---
I think it just makes you a gamer. Embrace it!
---
It wasn't easy to pull her away from WoW, but scavenging houses together looking for any kind of junk item around surprisingly managed to do the trick. :D
---
Thank you!
---
Yep. There is a note in Fallout 76 indicating that a bunch of them went to D.C. which sounds like a reference to the Underworld in Fallout 3.
---
The saying is "Couples who game together"
---
There is no need for the sarcastic response. I am sorry if I triggered you, honey, but being sarcastic isn't going to help anyone. And don't use the "safe space" thing with me because you have no idea.
---
"Oh him? That's Flappy. He followd me around, plummeting from the sky on a clear day. How you doing, Fkappy? Still dead? He may be a corpse that follows me around Appalachia, but he's kinda growing on me.  Like the fungus growing on him. Good boy, Flappy, good boy!"
---
"You're goofy, vault boy."
---
PvPers can go play Overwatch. PvP inclusion ruins games like Fallout, because humans cannot be trusted to not be a\*\*\*holes.
---
Palace of the Winding Path for Carrot Blossoms and Bloodleaf, Ash Heap for Toxic Soot Flowers, Sparse Sundew Grove for Digested Goo, the tunnel north of Watoga for Brain Fungus. The Firecaps are the worst, there's about six of them in a static spawn by the Monorail Elevator and a few other locations like Vault-Tec Agricultural Center where a few of them show up. Otherwise, just use Pharma Farma and pick them up or hit player vendors.
---
Most players in the community are very generous! Just remember to pass along the kindness when you're able to 😄👍🏻
---
My question is, I'm making a new build with heavy weapons/explosive weapons like missile launcher fat man etc, would rank 5 give you a big boost to explosive weapons or will it be a small percentage like the explosive prefix weapons
---
The nice thing with doing it this way is that you get to maintain your increased carry weight with the full Excavator PA.
---
You don’t need science equipped at all times, only when you craft. You could drop intelligence to 5 and max demolitions expert and swap in science when you need to craft.
---
I always thought those comments were referring to the hive mind they all share.
---
Amazing... I wish more people played 76,I wish you good adventures In Appalachia
---
Bingo
---
Should have seen my girlfriend when she entered the Red Rocket station in Flatwoods for the first time, and saw the ghouls for the first time.

I neglected to previously inform her on purpose. :D
---
Sometimes you can wait on the meat pile to show up.
---
It’s a random sheepsquach encounter, I believe.
---
I more than 1 month of playing with my camp in a new location, it has only ever interfered with another camp once. If I didn't have my player vendor turned on I'm sure I would have had next to 0 players come to my camp. I don't mind being sociable, I just don't like getting the message that I can't place my camp.
---
They aren’t available for 2hours or so while they switch the raid. It’s been switched atm if I’m not wrong
---
I thought everyone played that way... Why would you listen to Spotify while playing?
---
I know there's a floor trap that will send em flying! But I don't think that's what you meant haha.
---
When in the wasteland, it just works 😉
---
i would be okay with paying atoms for skins for the robots, but i would like it if we could build our own like in fallout 4. maybe have it scale with the player's intelligence stat. say 1-3 allows you to build a junk eye-bot with no personality, and it scales up to 14-15 allowing you to make a sentry-bot. killing robots could allow you to learn bot crafting plans and the robotics expert perk may be needed for some more useful/cool mods
---
It's just showing you Sheepsquatch was there. There is another one where you find the Brahmin alive and the Mr herder alive too then the Sheepsquatch attacks.
---
same issue
---
Yep, two different ones a few weeks apart.  The basic plan can't be sold, but the mods can just like any other plan.  I have rarely seen them in vendors since they are such a pain to earn.
---
No.... but if i could set that up right, it would be instant karma😈🤣 great idea! Lol
---
This looks so nice!
---
Sweet but the screen on andriod cant change  it wont go into horizontal screen
---
I play without music exclusively.  I have multiple radios in my camp, so I only get the soundtrack when close to the radios in game.  I have to agree with the OP, it is awesome hearing enemies chatting.  It reminds me of Westworld, and the hosts talking to one another conversation lol
---
I’m trying it as soon as I get home. First fallout game I’ve ever played...My brother talked me into it because he and my niece play. Have to say it’s taking up 12 to 16 hours of my life every day since I started.

u/ladydevann

Could you look into this please? It’s been a issue since game launch if I’m not wrong. Would be nice if it’s fixed maybe next patch! :)

5 points as opposed to 9 points for 60% bonus with the other weapon damage perks... There are other explosive weapons, it's not just meant to buff the explosive legendary effect. It's more noticeable on hunting rifle and lever action etc because the 20% explosive bonus is a much higher number than on, say, a 10mm. I think it's the most useful to have the 5 ranks in demo with explosive rifles, and obviously if you use grenade launchers, fat mangs etc.. 
---
Fireproof perk and the chest mod pretty much negate all explosive damage to your char if you go that route
---
I prefer the blood bone raider one.
---
It is not optimized but here it is.

I have some more tweaking to do but it works for now. I only switch to Heavy Weapons when I am doing Scorched Earth. The rest of the time I am using the non-PA build in order to save materials and ammo. Anyway, I hope it helps.
---
I've called this one out before. Constantly hungry!
---
Me too!
---
Hey, I only said it was tempting, I really want one. Doesn't mean I'm going to spend $15 dollars on it. I don't even have 5 dollars to spend 😂 I think it's ridiculous people are selling them though. If you even look up legacy weapons on google, eBay pops up with people selling them at $60 a pop, even for regular weapons you can still get. Tbh, I don't think they should be sold for money, and on one hand I feel like the guy on Xbox is a huge scammer, but I wouldn't send a random person money like that on Xbox, just to have a gun that I'd only use for mobs. I already have 2 handmades, I'm happy enough right now
---
I did till they raided 40 waters every single time i went to get some was empty so i lokced them all and sell them for less than venders least i can keep the limit in check that way so i dont lose out
---
If you follow the trail of the cows, or look around the area, ur bound to find a sheep.
---
Sorry, what did you say?
---
I still don't understand the logic behind separating characters for the Nuclear Winter levels, too.
---
Purified water is really easy to come by once you play for a bit. I keep 50 or so on me and sell 50 to 100 a day depending on if i remember to grab it when im at my camp. Before too long youre gonne be like "what the hell am i going to do with all this water?" That person wont even notice its gone and they left it unlocked for peeps just like you.
---
I missed it too, but didn't like any of them enough to buy.
---
Baaah
---
I was hoping to use my shitty performance in this game as an excuse to go sli or jump up to a 9 series from my 8700, but after research it's just a matter of unoptimised code slowing things down and as much as I'd love another 1080ti or another 4 threads or another 970evo, the game wouldn't be able to use it.
---
The seem to be very rare unless it's a scorched horde
---
I remember when you could scrap them for ballistic fiber.
---
I mean if there’s load outs and we can have several softener saves of them why not make one with all the building/repairing/crafting one, and the one with those 6 perks as the only difference to the one you use most of the time?
---
Luck is mostly useful for the perk cards.
---
Bloody mess is an easy +15% global damage increase, I pretty much never put it away.
---
 There's also tormenter for rifles that adds a limb cripple chance, though I expect that's best for auto rifles.
---
The chance to repair cards can be useful depending on your gear. When I was running an ultracite gatling laser I put on the weapon repair card to make that a little cheaper (I also swapped out my crit cards and had tons of room so why not).
---
Having at least 3 so you can swap in super duper is a pretty big boon, and it's easy to find a single 3 point card for your build.
---
lol A hero in this day and age!
---
Source? I mean, it makes sense from a morale boosting standpoint.
---
Funny that, I was just thinking of coming back. Maybe I should make a post about it /s
---
(no shit, though, I've been out of it for a while. Might restart, not sure)
---
I carry a Black Powder Rifle and a Hunting Rifle and usually have one each of the rifle perks on Perception. I can't really do much damage with them, but it's enough to take out turrets, drones or any other annoying flying thing (also Yao Guai, those things suck for melee builds). I also use it to tag legendaries in events and to pick off low level enemies when I don't want to bother. Just don't start shooting at scorchbeasts or the queen or they'll never land. Find an open area and convince them to land or don't bother.
---
Somone bid a  tse Laser rifel
---
I have 2 medium sized purifiers at my camp, so a total of 6 that can be stored at a time.  I occasionally remember to collect from them, but not all that often, and I still end up vendoring a lot of it.
---
If people take water from them (and they're right at the entrance to my camp, so easy to find), I don't even miss it.  I may *notice* that someone's taken them, but trust me, even with only 2, I have plenty.
---
I've seen people with 6+ purifiers at their camp, locked, and I don't get it.  Unless that's their source of income at least.  But if you have a shop set up, and you're not making 10x more from that, you're doing something wrong.
---
Don't sweat it. If you need the water, take it.  Almost no one will notice, much less care that you do.
---
I upvoted you. Someone had downvoted...?
---
Also, bite your tongue, sir/madam! The big-shots who make all the choices might hear you!
---
If you have the space and want maximum damage, you may as well. There's nothing else that improves damage aside from Nerd Rage, and bloodied builds can still use both
---
I have wished for an online version of FO4 since it came out back in the day.
---
Those that continuously bitch about FO76 are either not interested, simply want their 60 seconds of fame by riding the trend-wave or just have nothing else interesting to do. For as many bugs as there are, I have never encountered anything really game breaking as long as I played the game the way it was intended to, and a bit of caution.
---
That is how I am planning to go on!
---
Since the effects increase hunger and thirst, the game sees it as a positive effect. "+"50% Hunger and "+"50% Thirst. Class Freak decreases "negative" effects so since the mutation adds hunger/thirst it's not affected.
---
I imagine that adds up to a damn good contribution!
---
This would be a really good idea.  Specs don’t need to be fluidly changed on a whim but I personally would love smoothing out my duplicate cards.
---
ejecting could be a viable solution, that too could end up being abused somehow... 
---
Could make mine damage in camp boundaries immediately make the perpetrator wanted... as should shooting someone whilst in camp !!  
---
(just not down with people being rude and shooting me cos I'm using a machine they want to access too)
---
Smartass...
---
Terrible potential for trolling. You're just going around your business and whoop, somebody places a camp underneath and sends you to V76.
---
I don't like any of those masks. They'd make good camp decorations but look silly worn. I'd love it if they made some cool costumes instead. Lederhosen, Bavarian barmaid dresses, stuff like that. The beret looked cool, but I've only ever seen two of them. I enjoyed Grahm's bbq, but I'm not going to do an event repeatedly in hopes of getting something unless both the event is fun and the rewards are good.
---
Ist it Wort it bro ?
---
Did you get a reply?
---
They could implement an arena system allow other players to watch.  Would fit perfectly with the raider style.  I dont pvp myself but I would watch others fight one on one.
---
Every time my fast travel fails, I think about your comment here. Works on my second slower attempt every time. Lol. 
---
If I could upvote again I would! Thanks for this!
---
Another hero! I have upvoted you for telling it like it is.
---
I assumed he meant bloodied or TSE are the best but he forgot the “or”. 🤷‍♂️
---
Because it's fun to do the workshop defence events. So this is another thing in this already content void game I can't do? I hate PvP players and all that they stand for.
---
Just a guess. Bethesda won’t deny it since it would only hurt them. I’m sure a lot of people put a good amount of time into this event, to say we failed would only piss them off and cause many to shelf the game for a while. It’s just a ploy to keep players active while they work on wastelanders.
---
Question-  you mentioned Spotify- can you play that in the background on PS4 while gaming?  I tried to do that but couldn’t figure it out
---
You are a great man,thank you, (I 100% agree with you and also I have been wishing the same,just wish you could all start up one big camp together,like one camp for one squad?)
---
I wonder if that would fall under some sort of ethical debate, offering a financial incentive to achieve a certain goal. I'm sure someone has floated this idea, with their lawyers shutting it down because this could leave open incentive/suspicions of Bethesda to fudging the numbers.
---
Less chance of a lawsuit when there are no theoretical monetary damages. So by keeping the rewards as far away from financial incentives for either party is probably smart.
---
I ended up just going with 3 points in demolition on my commando and i think its a good compromise. You can still tell the difference but youre not investing 5 points. When they dropped the damage bonus from 100 to 60 they should have dropped the last 2 point requirements as well. Maybe give that a try and see if it works for you?
---
I think 1 free full respec after lvl 60, or whatever level you finally have all  the perk cards. That way you have 1 chance to nail down a build after having to learn the confusing perk card system. After that can be the 1 point per lvl thing if they really want to keep it that grindy.
---
Yeah, we have to remember that we here are not even the majority of the players, we are a vocal and active minority.  I once met a guy with that mask, and he did not even know he know it was rare! I did give him a "fair" offer for the mask (25.000 caps, max at the time), but he declined after learning it made his character more unique.
---
I've experienced some really giving folks on there. I'm only level 35 and don't have much but when I eventually hit the high levels, I'll be sure to help out my lower level survivor friends :)
---
"Spare operative keycard"
---
No, I'm mad because I stood absolutely no chance. On all occasions, I didn't see them coming, and I was killed from full health to dead in a single or at the most, two hits. I am level 74 in game. Just because I do not specifically build my character for maximum dominance versus other players shouldn't mean I am not able to do the workshop activities.
---
Well might I suggest just lurking on here for a bit. Read the complaints and the appreciative posts. There is a vast amount of posts on here, generally positive, plus check these comments because a couple guys posted good info/links about its current state.
---
Today I've found a group that nuked the queen all 3 times on three different servers, though they were so well- equipped that I could only land enough damage on her to get the loot four or five times. It's impressive how her health went down quickly, a couple of times she was dead way before death from above even completed.
---
i know someone who got the winter mask
---
I thought this happened to me the other day, I couldn't do shit after I died, SPACE didn't let me respawn... But I clicked the word "respawn" and it worked!!
---
I already read the warning. I just didn't think I'd be anhiliated so quickly.
---
I have the standard backpack, but the Nuka Cola cooler shows up as a completely separate item in the crafting menu.
---
Why not make a new char to play with her?  I'm assuming based on your equipment you aren't.  I think if I brought anyone over to a game to play with me, I'd want to start at the same level so they get a genuine idea of the game.
---
Forgot what sub I was in. Was about to greet a fellow dweller out in the wild....but this is not the wild.
---
You didn’t see them coming because they had better tactics than you and had you outnumbered. And you say that but you faced people who are built for PVP so no you shouldn’t have a chance.
---
Something like this would be good. But there is no way to enforce balance on a PvP event like this, so it will always be a case of total anhiliation by one side/player. The answer is a PvE only server, and a PvP server. So us PvE players can do the workshop events without being brutally murderised in 2 seconds.
---
It was December many of us were not expecting things to leave the atomic shop in the beginning. I believe the tree came out with the red fireplace which I did get and stayed for quite awhile but missed the first round of black bird paint.
---
We shall never speak of the CU or the NGE that destroyed Galaxies.
---
Oh shit, I just did.
---
Some people, like myself, actually value their camps and their location. My camp has been in the same spot since the beta and i have no intention on moving. Especially to go out of my way to grief someone. There are also many places where camps cant be erected. Heckling people by using the camp mechanics to eject people would be very unlikely. Its too much trouble. Besides griefers want kills so they can get their 50 caps and possible junk
---
My spouse had a similar experience at the SBQ over the weekend twice in a row on the same server. She's not here to ask at the moment but I don't specifically recall a mirelurk being involved. What I do know is her health steadily drained whenever she entered a certain area on the roof of V9. I was able to linger in the same area without issue.
---
not sure why your getting down voted for this
---
Check their legitimacy, like if it's in the main trading subreddit then go check their karma. Also maybe check out the main trading sub's blacklist. It has a lot of the known scammers
---
Yeah because people losing all their accounts, hundreds of hours of gameplay isn't "news"? Pffft.
---
The Increase in damage is 25% of Base damage for the weapon when DE is at level 5, Two Shot and Harpoons with FlechetteMod see slightly higher numbers due to the additional projectiles.
---
I thought you were very polite😁
---
I went to a wedding recently where the minister said (in front of everyone during the ceremony) that he wanted to know the definition of marriage. So he "did what anyone would do: I Googled it". My first thought? Buddy, you obviously don't use Reddit...
---
You ruined it with the award edit
---
Everyone is guessing after patch 14 and the Halloween event we'll hear something. Probably beginning of November in an ITV is my guess.
---
if you are stash
---
Its probably the commies
---
It wouldn't surprise me. Oh well, this will give me something to start saving my atoms for then, I guess.. As long as they bring it back.
---
Yeah some groups really nailed it down. They eat SBQs for breakfast!
---
But I mean it depends on which legacy. Some are "rarer" than others. Rarer in the sense that they're kept for trade only purposes. Like on PS4, a VE Radium rifle is really rare apparently. A BE+FR laser rifle? Common as they come
---
Yay! Even less stuff to do in this game. I think I'll stick to modded Fallout 4, thanks!
---
Guess what? It's a great game! You should come back!
---
Joking aside, I do love it. What system are you on?
---
Ahhhh!!! really.. bummer. I bought the red fire place, but never noticed the tree. I must have been a little too late. I do hope at some point they bring back the tree, as well as the other Christmas bundled goodies. I guess it's a waiting game now.
---
For TSE laser rifle? Well yes, you're uptrading for a legacy item, though duped a plenty, but still... But if you can make junkies build, you're not gonna find many better weapons than JE handmade, so there's that.
---
Well, for the most part I hoard junk, really!Lol It's the social part that keeps me playing, I would be bored playing solo for that much too.
---
Thanks. I did have a friendly experience like this with some players before now. This sort of lulled me into a false sense of security with the Workshop zones, because I figured people wouldn't be so overly aggressive.
---
In a Roleplaying PoV: there wouldn't be any V76 dwellers left because they would have all brutally murdered each other in &lt; 5 years. Fallout 76 is a blight on the franchise lol.
---
I didn't downvote, but I am guess that it's contextual.  The reply is completely unrelated to the topic at hand.
---
I RP as a ghoul now. I started off wanting to be a raider, but switch up to all the radiation perks, cannibalism, and I keep plague walker, carnivore, and a couple other good solid mutations. 
---
I have only come across lame bloddied Melee weapons like wrenches, walking canes, etc. So until I find something good I keep the daywalker perks to heal my rads. That way radaway won't effect my mutations, and starched genes keeps it from getting rid of them in nuked zones. it doesn't effect my mutations.
---
I even made my dude look as sick as possible. I layered on all the scars, sunken eyes, pale sickly skin, etc. I hope ghouls to come back though. The game doesn't explain why they are absent. I get that the scortched plague killed off all the humans, but did the more civil ones all leave? They couldn't all have gone feral.
---
yo ... just a simple question ... so , untill i shoot somebody who's crauched out of vats i cant' vats him? correct?
---
And a tse tesla rifel ? 
---
Btw thanks for youre help Kinde wastlender
---
No news and there is only a targeted release time frame which is developer jargon for we want it to be ready but we aren't making any promises.
---
This guy Bethesdas.
---
I had it on my bloodied guy long ago, it doesn't use a stimpak every 20 sec, but if you even take 1hp of damage at 19% health, it will. It got annoying real fast lol
---
This is why i have 5 different builds. Its hard to reset someone after level 50 if you want to change their ways entirely. This is where build planning comes in. I got bored of 1 or 2 options per build and made someone that can use all rifles, shotties, and pistols, with main focus on rifles, with the switch of a couple perks all at the same time without really losing damage or defense anywhere else. It actually confuses people when they go to trade with me to try to see what my build is lol. The trick is to take only the first rank of each weapon perk. My main drive was when my weapons broke. I wanted someone who could pretty much use anything grabbed off a corpse efficiently besides melee. Its a vats, crit, commando build now at level 135 and the universal aspect made this probably the funnest build ive done besides the bloodied melee and guerilla. Shes also decent at pvp coming from a non pvp person and told by people who do lol. Got to love the griefers coming in since survival is gone, little do they expect a aa ffr combat rifle lol, shreds PA like tissue paper.
---
Oh well thank you! Ignorance is bliss, in my case 😂
---
Agreed. People on this r downvote for no reason. Here's an upvote to help balance it out.
---
I had the same encounter yesterday. It wasn't my first, but it had a twist. Sheepsquatch sleeping in the middle of Brahmin corpses. Shame I had to kill it.
---
I can't really say that was "nerfed", the glowing ones xp was bugged af, giving waaaay more xp as anything else.  It was ridiculous, not good, back then.
---
Ahhh...makes sense. I haven't done to many mire quests. Kinda skipped that area.
---
lol, right?!  whenever i play my other toons im always freakin' out like, did my main learn water purifier?!  or chemistry bench?  agh!  i should hold onto it just in case we ever get inter-character trading...
---
Is your junkies 3* and is their Tesla 3*?
---
\*grins\* I can't say I disagree. The worst is that this is already a thing, but no one reads it.
---
Someone in another post similar to this one commented that at least people are still interested and talking about it. I have chosen to look at it this way, or I will make myself crazy seeing all those posts. The returning ones are the ones that really kill me. Why not start up the game you ALREADY HAVE and find out?
---
That's very good resist. Makes PA look like shit lol. I just wonder if Wastelanders is going to be like other MMORPGs and the new gear with this DLC is gonna make the gear we've spend the last year collecting look like trash.
---
Right, I'd personally rather them take more time if needed.  While I want it now, I can wait.  Plus, we'll have games starting to roll in from next week forward to provide a distraction.
---
If your teammate is near you all the time it should probably be possible to adjust the level of ran sponge and dilluted rad-x&amp;radshield so that your rate of healing is about the same as rate of gaining rads.
---
Haha I thought I was the only one that did that! Especially jukeboxes. It wouldn't be so bad if it didn't play such awful music.
---
They're not uncommon on my platform. Also the E versions don't arc. Most people want a Qffr Tesla, so it depends on if you're getting it to trade or keep yourself. You really shouldn't value legacies highly, they're too common to be rare
---
PC. Got it on a whim one day. Was disappointed that it wasn't heavily discounted like I was told it was, but hey. I enjoyed it when I played it, but it didn't hold my attention for some reason. 
---
I think I'd have a hell of a time getting my friends to play it - but they're mostly playing Destiny for the moment, and that content there has already worn thin for me.
---
Pulse grenades/mines require demo expert (3) **and** science (1) to craft. But I have both cards maxed out (5 and 2 respectively).
---
I normally keep demo expert and nerd rage on when exploring, since it'll at least do something.
---
Oh don't mind me, he's wearing heavy armor and I'm wearing a nice little outfit. I'm sure it'll stop all those bullets, claws and lasers. :P
---
imo itd be supercool if there were new, unique variants based on the year of the event in addition to mixing up which ones are the "rare" ones
---
Max level marine Uny ap refresh wwr RA for base price.
---
That's awesome. I wish I could do that!...
---
You know...get a girlfriend 😂😂😂
---
I would have to consider far more than it being a legacy weapon to take a TSE Tesla in that trade. If it is something appealing to you either for novelty or actual use then by all means it is a fair trade. If you are looking for your new #1 weapon I would pass.
---
95% of the time no music. Put it on now and then whilst crafting and doing inv stuff but way prefer no music. Mainly because its so much more immersive, partly because i cannot bare to listen to about 9 songs each 2 mins long on a loop. Its not even random, its like a bargain bucket album you pick up in a petrol station. The songs are good, but after a year they are quite tiresome
---
If it’s unlocked then no, not only does it produce so much water they likely won’t notice, I leave mine unlocked as a jester of good will so people might want to buy something from my shop
---
THIS IS GRAFTON’S MAYOR
---
IF starched genes is equipped, diluted radx does not temp remove mutations
---
Yeah
---
Yay! Still need a fixer plan though lol :(
---
I mean you could just leave 1 unlocked 1 locked or something
---
There's a note near vault 76 that explains some of them left for D. C
---
I also hit a couple legendaries at Big Bend while working on my scorched grinding last night
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events
---
For anyone who needs proof! :D
---
Never do something for nothing lol
---
Events are a good way to help level up. They usually have a lot of enemies and you also get xp when completed.  I also look for areas with a high number of enemies to clear when not doing events.  The higher the enemy level the more xp.  I would recommend looking for the highest level bad guys that you can kill quickly and efficiently enabling you to get xp but not wipe out all of your resources.  I had good luck at top of the world when I was at your level but that was before they lowered the level cap there.  Super mutants also give great xp if you can find areas that they are in.
---
What's strange about these is the lack of "mysterious quills." The good thing is that you can use Butcher's Bounty to get meat for ribeye steaks.
---
I wouldn't say so.  
---
I basically leave every resource open and available for other players and I imagine most are similar.  
---
If you don't have to pick a lock to get to it, I'd say you're welcome to it.
---
If you rank up Fireproof, it should help mitigate the explosive damage you take when firing at close proximity. Def helps me.
---
Yep basically this. Legacy doesn't mean anything besides common dupe. So really only get one to say you have a legacy I guess
---
ooh-rah
---
Dunno why you got downvoted, this is an important part of a trade lol
---
yeah that would be great if we could move our duped weapons to different platforms
---
If you're on PS4 I can get you one my guy
---
Sorry sir but if you think that you're the one towards playstyle whose the game should be completely adjusted we haven't got much to talk about. The fact that YOU personally wouldn't use some systems for sinister usage doesn't mean it will not be used by other players. Making these types of changes is something that has to consider the greater context. I don't think you're in position to specify what griefers want either, if you think its caps, not salt, that they are harvesting.
---
With actual explosive weapons you get the full 60% bonus (which is huge).
---
The reason it's smaller with explosive legendaries is that most of the damage is balistic and some explosive, and the perk only boosts the explosive portion of the damage.
---
What are the 3rd perks on your and 3rd perks on yheirs
---
I never have music; it's a distraction.
---
Nicee
---
Does it bother you much?
---
The hair, the clothes... Did she watch YOU play FO4??
---
I'm assuming it eventually gets easier to kill them, cuz at level 60 they're still a challenge
---
PC, I'll just have to spend more of my playtime shopping and hopping lol
---
Lol no, she's never had any contact at all with it ahah
---
Yep I wanted to get the highest DR without PA. A couple of my pieces could be upgraded to heavy metal and j could get close to 800. Been chasing a couple pieces, but I'm happy with what I have now.
---
I really hope our gear doesn't become obsolete.
---
By the way, making 4x Diluted Rad-x with Chemist and Super Duper nets way more than selling the Rad-X
---
I can tell you, that is the easy part of the whole process of making her play with you ahah
---
I have 6: marsupial, healing factor, speed demon, electically charged, grounded, and adrenal reaction.
---
As a melee player, everything necessarily gets really close, so the only negative is electrically charged can be hazardous in large mobs like WS.  Grounded helps offset the damage, but I've died a couple times because of it.  
---
Thinking about removing it, but I need to get serums for a couple of the others.
---
OTOH, I was in excavator at the time.  Now that I'm in X01, may not be as bad b/c of the higher DR, but I haven't tested it yet.
---
Maxing Demolition will add 12% more damage total.  So clearly it’s not a very good perk, post-nerf.  One point is a decent addition (4% more damage), but after that you are probably better off using different perks.
---
I'm okay with that, but then there are certain things that confuse people. For example, "How can you be a gamer and never have played/beaten \[insert game here\]???
---
I noticed this after the quest. You still can't drop them.
---
Bought both the legs for my Bloodied build from one guy. Unyielding Sentinel +1s Marine LL, Chameleon Powered Sentinel Marine RL at 1K each.
---
Also bought an Unyielding Sentinel RL for 5K which I flipped for a BE Handmade.
---
I got a BE LMG for 900 which I flipped for an Unyielding Powered Sentinel Marine chest.
---
Got an Imposter Sheepsquatch set for 1180 combined. 
---
Plenty more good buys, but those are the most memorable.
---
You're not gonna find one in a player vendor more than likely my guy
---
There's a quest you can do called An Organic Solution to get the recipe for radshield, and it's easy to make. It offers 300 rad resistance for 15 minutes and doesn't suppress mutations:)
---
Me and this other guy noticed that if you kill things, you get XP, so I'd kill lots of things. It's fun and levels you
---
.....China would be dust before we fell.
---
Yes.  Open spotify first, get some music going, then open your game.  You can then control spotify through the ps4 (long hold the ps button and navifate to the controls) or if you have the app on your phone, you can control spotify that way.
---
Sure. You can’t share cameras. But if you hit drop button then it will destroy the camera and it’ll be gone from your inventory. Same difference.
---
How can they grief you?  They can't harm you, or your CAMP, if you have pacifist enabled.  And if they try to nuke your CAMP, you have a 3 minute warning.  Just server hop.
---
Yea I actually will, had this raider itch I need to scratch.
---
I was just watching her ass around for the first few levels, waiting until she dropped almost dead from a few mole rats and then nuking them before they could deal the final blow ahah
---
I just see month old patch notes...
---
Wow thanks for that u fucking bot now people cant even complain
---
That's awful! In one of these games somewhere there was a vault where they turned into weird plant ghouls that were basically invisible in the plants all over the vault. I screamed there, too. Weird(er) looking ghouls leaping out of nowhere, making horrible noises!!
---
I mean it's there company, I would put my time zone in it? That better represents my hours of operation
---
I've seen tenderizers for 1k, maybe... :) I don't mind grinding the event but seems like most people don't bother going to it and we fail
---
If you’re planning on rocking a hazmat suit and run a ranged weapons build like rifleman, try to post up on top of a fence (by the bunker) or building and you’ll have a much easier time. Def don’t recommend that exclusively melee builds rock a hazmat suit for queen runs though (but that strategy does work well at Whitespring IMO)
---
It still says 33.46 to me :(
---
Which event does it drop from, imposter sheepsquatch or arktos?
---
Yes of all the sounds to repeat constantly this one is maddening.
---
That's why I suggested her to rank up Charisma, she can talk the mobs out of fights
---
It happens after you download a dlc I think I for 2 iirc.
---
That is weird, but worry not! We met the goal, we get the 50% off sale :D
---
Well, the friends list is current bugged, but if you see me in the wasteland, wave me down! I play on PC as well, and almost never have someone to wander with (and it IS a lot of fun with someone else).
---
To be honest, i love the in game radio via pipboy.  But i wanted more songs.  So i turn on a playlist.
---
Fo3, new vegas, fo4... I've always listened to the in game stations.
---
You have the plans for sale?!
---
Thank you for apologizing.
---
That’s speed demon
---
I've found that the "fix" for that bug is to just destroy the bot. Fixes it pretty quick, lol.
---
Don't like ghouls personally i think they look gross and the whole radiation magic makes you immortal for some odd reason makes it worse for me to take them as just anything but immersion breaking even for the fallout world, the kid in the fridge quest in FO4 is one of the biggest examples, 200 years locked in a fridge without eating anything and not even a hint of psychological trauma seriously? Besides ghouls was used in the games mostly as a pre war connection since this game takes place so close to the great war there are still a lot of human survivors from that time.
---
ty vm for that detailed answer! good to know for healing stuff. im still looking for drugs. but i guess its just farming.
---
After the Halloween event we'll start getting news from the Inside the Vault. Likely it won't be one big update, but the NPCs will come gradually week after week with new updates spanning the whole period.
---
They didn’t add the private servers and mods yet, which they said were coming in 1 year.  - as though it takes a year to do something they claimed they planned all along (yeah right).  I wonder if they will pay Wall that too - assuming they have any actual plans.
---
Encryptid
---
Imposter Sheepsquatch event. Encryptid
---
Refresh the page -- Ctrl+R!
---
I'm on PC and this doesn't happen at any event for me... And no, I'm not the guy one shotting things lol everyone gets a hit in and all that
---
I literally scrap and bulk everything to cut down on stash weight. Also helps that I only keep 4-6 weapons, all heavy, with a lvl 3 bear arms so they weigh 2 each.
---
This was so satisfying to read. Thank you.
---
Some of the legendary armor reduces (item) weight by 20% or more.  I have a couple pieces of it - I weight about 150# less out of PA than in it, but still way to overencumbered.  so I still live in PA.
---
I could get behind that too. Ejection we be a quick painless defense unless betheada removes player induced rad damage. Then no one has to worry about it
---
Hazmat or Power Armor are your two options.
---
We need bulking ammo, and make all bulked goods have weight reduction of like 90%, maybe cost more plastic.
---
ummm your really grasping at straws i have not paid for atoms and have earn all atoms in game to get what i wanted. i would stop complaining and actual do events in game and earn atoms. Yes its buggy and yes its a grind but its either you pay or earn there is no pay to win when you can invest time and get the same as someone who invests money. Time is a commodity in life you either have the time to invest to get something or you have the money to save time and get something thats almost true in everything in life. so grow up and stop with the millennial bs
---
" Murder relaxes me. "
---
I think this is good.... or is it? :P
---
I tried but it seemed closed to miss and invitees
---
Fixer plan: 400 caps!
---
I don't have a link to where it was said but it has been stated by the CM that this is a visual bug. As to whether that is true or not I can't really say as I personally have never taken the time to verify it.
---
Mmm all I do is play that event. I've sold over 15 copies. Don't have any extras rn, but probably will by the weekend
---
Huzzah! I helped with like 0.005% of that!
---
There’s another. Let me PM you.
---
I only sell legendaries below 900.
---
Over 1000 seems so crazy to me, most of my guns are sold for about 200
---
That's so strange! I guess she and Nora just have the same sense of style. Now if you tell me your name/player name is Nate...!
---
I am stash
---
What is even more amazing is my camp is on the Ohio river on the west side of the forest.  The crickets/frogs get kinda loud sometimes.  But if I fire my gun they all go silent then a few seconds later start back up slowly back to being loud.  
---
Whoever programmed that in is a genius.  I know the game has issues but to think they silenced the bug noises when they hear a gunshot and then let them come back gradually afterward takes a hell of a lot of thought.
---
Ahah no it is far from it, although it looks slightly like him if you remove the sunglasses and change the hairstyle
---
There's a reason early MMOs were all subscription based. Development and hosting costs money. Most funding from sales comes from the initial rush, once that fades sales income is probably barely enough to keep the in house beverage cooler stocked. 
---
No denying that the game is a bit of a mess but I just can't side with this mentality of wanting endless content updates for free "because I bought the game." That's like buying a new car and wanting free service + tire changes for life. Welcome to the real world.
---
If you refresh will say 36.11 :)
---
I think the most time I’ve spent in a single game is around 840 hours. that I know of at least, totally unsure on my time spent in Halo3 and Runescape.
---
I hope you'll one day grow to the point where criticism of a hole in your idea will not be approached as personal attack.
---
I get that you value your camp. I do value mine. I even bought another account once because I wanted to keep the camp AND to build new.
---
The thing is both griefers and PvPers are prepared and have their fancy camp on one character, their mobile camp on their combat character, and their trollcamp on their troll character. Some people move their camp to use it to throw dead cows onto other people (seriously this is a thing), other will use it to teleport people away. 
---
You could take it productively, for example "how about giving it a 60 sec notice that lets you quit the camp area on your own terms to prevent this trolling", instead you said "I wouldn't do that myself so your argument is invalid", well played sir xD
---
It's only a pay wall if there is no way to get it without paying money. Since there are multiple ways to earn Atoms in the game, the only items that have ever been locked behind a paywall are those that require the purchase of a limited time Atom bundle like the 1500 Atoms + Elder Battlecoat
---
I remember that as well. Also, my characters with speed demon don't seem to get any hungrier than those without the mutation.
---
Do a hard refresh, Ctrl+F5.
---
Not for me it doesn't, but WE FUCKING DID IT!!!!
---
Ah, okay! Thank you for this, I was thinking It could be a waste, but I'm glad to find out that it's not
---
Agreed. Also, the collectron IS essentially a cosmetic item. The amount of stuff it collects is tiny compared to what I can collect in the same amount of time. So it isn't giving me an advantage (even on my level 11 alt) I really only have it in my camp because it says funny stuff.
---
What do they run?
---
If they aren’t going to address the obvious dupers in this game then you think they should address griefers?  Give me a break. 
---
Check and adjust folks. It’s the wasteland.  Instead of whining and complaining why don’t you make a plan to defend yourself better?  Team up.  Set up your camp differently with better defenses. 
---
But oh no - bitch and moan to Bethesda to see if they nerf yet another game feature because the duckies and bunnies crowd doesn’t like it.
---
Now what do we do?
---
Thanks for the good news buddy. 
---
Now, I have some serious weight management to do.  I have 1K scrip but no stash space...
---
Most games that offer private servers typically ask for a fee, since you're renting it from them.
---
That is crazy but i see how lol!
---
Back in my day schools were for learning not gaming!
---
What would you say their values are roughly
---
Uhm, private servers?  What does that mean - modding?
---
I just had to get rid of my speed demon, i couldn't crawl out of constant starvation!!!!
---
At least DLC will be free unless they pull a switcheroo like ESO did and stop calling it DLC after a few releases and change the name to Chapters
---
Thank fucking God
---
My boyfriend introduced me to fallout with NV BUT refuses to play 76 with me :( I’m so jealous
---
Now we play the game.
---
I use one rank as a bloody sniper build. Even with a B/E hunting rifle, I don’t think it’s worth a 5 point investment. You can kill almost anything with one shot anyways. An extra hundred damage is a drop in the bucket when you’re making 4000 point headshots.
---
When explosive was +100% AoE damage, that was a different story.
---
I guess it’s a personal choice, and how valuable diminishing returns are.
---
Once I start my melee player (next double XP weekend) I plan to use a Gatling Plasma as my only gun.
---
&gt;I don't think you're in position to specify what griefers want
---
Oh but you can assume about me huh? Awfully entitled with your opinions. Good day hypocrite😘
---
You missed the outrage bus by a few weeks, my man. These microtransactions have been normalized and accepted by now.
---
Do they? I've started that up, having never played the pre-FO3 games. I got them with my copy of 76, so I started up Tactics. Now I am excited!
---
I’m from the old CS 1.6 days where private meant you were not renting from them.  You were hosting your own.
---
Duping a weapon wouldn't be possible as the 2 weapons would never exist in the same universe so to speak. You would have one item on one platform and one on the other you would never have 2.
---
And you wouldn't be able to do multiple character transfers.
---
There was a perk in past Fallout's where you could any a grenade in someone's pocket. What you're describing is kind of the same thing.
---
So let's party anyway, i got beer :D
---
I actually found a note somewhere that was saying the ghouls were moving east to the capital area, and i felt like that was a little homage to the Underworld, or whatever it was called in fallout 3
---
Yeah I have credit for every other except the queen wich I've killed over 600 times. I did the queen another 4 times last night an still nothing.
---
A full respec for 1 level up. No reason not to.
---
This is based on what you specified, you're missing the point by astronomical distances and if you for a second stopped the assumption about your infinite wisdom you'd see that xD
---
And the scars. But I like the scars. He looks like he could actually survive this mess. And keep the pretty lady alive!
---
Acid: antifreeze, abraxo, bstteries (also yield lead) fertilizer, wendigo teeth, in loose containers (look like mustard jars), stingwings, cave crickets, yogis...
---
gunpowder: supermutants.
---
Lol I love how someone offers an alternate opinion that’s not in line with the non PVP crowd and it’s instantly downvoted.   There are different ways to play and people have different interests.  Camp building ain’t my thing.  Shooting and killing and blowing things up is more my deal.
---
I just deleted my comment cause I said the same thing. I was so hype to see some homage to the Underworld
---
Lol..
---
They're also gonna take his prize money
---
Ah okay, makes sense.  But given the game and current industry trends, I'd be surprised if it was a free option.
---
This is why I love Better Inventory mod for PC. Prefixes plans with (Known) if you already have them learned.
---
I know but my CAMP is near one of the entrances to Whitesprings so I have to listen to it constantly or kill Sentry Bots every 30 minutes.
---
Can you try through a VPN? Your latency will be higher but you may be able to rule out interference via packet inspection or just simple packet loss from an over saturated network. 
---
In my experience most corporate configured networks (this includes college) are less than ideal for gaming for a variety of reasons. They are always over saturated, they are always inspecting everything, and they always have QoS geared toward voip and other "essential" services.
---
Ctrl + f5 doesnt work on cell phones.  And I keep hitting refresh but that’s hard to do since my cell phone keeps trying to give me the web search for what ctrl + f5 means...
---
We had to walk in the snow to the computer center to play hack in ascii.
---
Shooting the SBQ in the air with 50 cal is waste of ammo in my experience. Most shots won't connect or deal fraction of damage. 
---
I have an AAFFR primed 50 cal for ground fights to shoot her in the face from point blank range. That deals 22 damage/shot, 11.4 shots/second (up to 41 dmg with Adrenaline 5). Firing 100 rounds puts me above the damage limit for loot. Otherwise, after this period or if she is in the air, I switch to one of my Gatling Guns (AAE, Furious Prime, Zealot's Prime) and keep firing. They are way slower but deal 2x-4x more damage than the 50 cal and thus consume half the ammo (you can craft 360 ultracite 5mm vs the 180 regular).
---
I haven't failed an SBQ in months. The closest I got to a failure was this Saturday when I nuked Prime but most 100+ players logged off by then. I spent 3k .50 ultracite and 2k 5mm ultracite over 23 minutes. The other one was recently too where I was just able to fire enough rounds in 10 seconds when she was killed by an extreme stealth/bloodied build in seconds.
---
The theoretical point? Yeah i got it dude... the first time. Tangent much?
---
As if there was any doubt!!
---
Yay!
---
Any legendary enemy with poison attacks seems to be a dice roll. Sometimes the poison hits for a little bit and stacks up after awhile to do some decent damage to me, other times I watch all my health drain at a rate of 75HP/s. This has been going on since patch 9 (when I sent my first ticket) and I am fairly certain it hasn't gone away in any major patch or subpatch. Whats also frustrating is that the damage is so strong that my +75 Poison resist doesn't really save me in these situations either. =(
---
And then rebroke them trying to fix the bug they created prior to fixing the first bug
---
Same! I really wanna try a different build in it just to switch things up but it feels pointless starting again at Lvl1 whem I already have all the rewards up to 70.
---
All of them.
---
I pre-planned my scrip, should have 1000 by tomorrow and then I'll have that 150 buffer when the sale starts since I know I'll be turning most of it right back in...
---
Looks pretty good.  I assume you will be running a bloodied weapon?  I would get rid of born surviver since nerd rage doesn't kick in until your below 20% health and having level 3 nerd rage is awsome.  I've also found that I didn't need all 5 ranks of adrenaline either when I was using a bloodied combat rifle, the adrenal reaction and stealth.  I've only been running 2 or 3 points in that and after the first kill everything pretty much dies in one shot maybe two.  I also like lone wanderer maxed out as it gives great ap regeneration and damage avoidance.
---
I normally play with no music.  Then you hear the sounds of your enemies.  But last night there were times it went all quite. I am not sure if this was associated with mist rolling in as I seemed to be at the edge of it getting misty.
---
Winter's not that rare due to dupers, least on Xbox.
---
I usually get 15k per plan. Which I use to buy more keycards, you can buy about 8-9 for 15k. Little light rn, last ten runs I didn't get any so wasn't able to restock on keycards.
---
Yea but other locations aren’t guaranteed max level either. The only potentially better place is WestTek, but it could be three or zero legendary when Whitespring has at least a couple. Uranium fever is good for scrips capped at level 40, as well as other places where the boss is a mole miner or an animal 🤮
---
Bought a Bloodied gamma gun with FFR for 1500 caps.  Found a furious fire axe modded with spikes and swing speed and for 500 caps. 
---
There are deals out there 
---
On the flip side, I sold a Bloodied radium Rifle with FFR and dmg reduction for 800 caps about a month ago.  Was trying to lower my inventory stash weight.  Not the best move I’ve made!
---
Careful what you wish for they might add a respec option but lock it behind atoms.
---
And how would you accomplish this on a mobile device. I'm not trying to be a fuck by asking. I'm honestly asking because I have the same issue on my phone. Still shows 33.48mil no matter how many times I refresh the page and it'd be nice to know how to forced it to refresh
---
I was just now remembering a time a little further back when games came on discs and there was no signing in online - in fact there was no online - and you could give the doc to all your friends to install, and yet somehow we still got amazing games to play.
---
Stalker’s pipe with extra bashing and vats chance👌
---
I took 50 glowing blood packs one time and couldn't get the radiation damage below 7 a second even with over 2000 rad resistance. But I only had to pop a Radaway once a minute. Had my friends freaking out wondering how I was still alive.
---
Action Hero 50 cal for 1500 caps.
---
 This page may contain erotic or adult imagery. You'll need to sign in if you still want to view it. 
---
???
---
Ive even said that im all for people playing the way they want to play and this guy still downvotes. Never underestimate a butthurt person on reddit🤣
---
Yeah I could see this being on the atom shop. Just make them basically walking turrets that you have to know turret plans for. Looking forward to spending 500 atoms on this!
---
Yeah that’s a bummer. I have a pretty common spot in the Forest near Mama Dolce’s and Grafton High (access to the Dolce event and GHS for plastic scrap) and seems like 50%of the time I get the message that I can’t place it. All I really need is a train station so I don’t care that much lol
---
Go and do something positive with your life.
---
I have a couple on Xbox.
---
Unless you’re using a legacy auto weapon, Fireproof perk and/or a dense mod on your chest armor will negate almost all explosive damage.  You can stand on a car, shoot yourself in the foot with a B/E hunting rifle, explode the thing and walk away without a scratch.
---
Surprised so many people get excited at seeing a kill count but hey with the poor state of the game and lack of real content you need small things to keep you going and not lose hope.
---
Um really?  I’m sitting on an AAE handmade with FFR and vats right now.
---
Would never sell it that high 
---
My BE auto primed handmade must be worth 50k then
---
Ah that would make sense.
---
LOL classic
---
The battle is won!
---
Yeah that's really the only negative I have.
---
Nuclear keycards?
---
That's okay! If you don't like it, you can move on, not comment, and go play something else!
---
\*grins\* You know you're going to be downvoted for that, I assume?
---
I don't PvP because without VATS, I am a terrible shot. So just no. But without Survival, we're going to have people wanting to PvP more in Adventure. It's not wrong. It's totally understandable. It's not a Bethesda issue, it's a people issue.
---
I have no problems with the person who walks up to me, puts a shot in my leg, and then waits for me to agree or decline. I have no issue with dying in a workshop. Serves me right. I DO have an issue with the scenario OP laid out, where no one had the chance or choice to defend themselves. That's not PvP. Player versus player assumes that both sides stand a chance of at least TRYING. That's just being an asshat.
---
Use diluted
---
which event is it?
---
they are not missing if you can find their marker under the map
---
Not enough people are filing tickets.  Squeaky wheel get the grease and all that.
---
Gotcha - I might be able to get to 15k soon, but it'll take some doing.
---
Please be gentle
---
Buy a fresh new cell phone and all the site will be the most recent.  
---
Problem Solved !!
---
They were added for the Fourth of July, obviously.
---
Not a misc quest, but probably  triggered by a script. The one and only time on this game that I ever had a legendary scorched inside the bend was a crowned one running with a group towards me after picking up the key on the tunnel.
---
On a good day, a high level may give you one.  My first was a L5 furious fire axe given to me by a L60.
---
Some people drop stuff in the overseers cache, so add that to your route of places to periodically check.
---
If you do the event at morgantown airport, you'll get a few decent non-legendary L10 weapons.  Check rooftops or other high places - you may find a nice sniper rifle.
---
I kept killing them until the maintenance started and kicked me off, did not realise it was over :)
---
That’s a great gun. Damn near perfect for a high health stabilized build.
---
😂 I bet!
---
Same here! We met during the first Meat Week when he randomly complimented my camp and we play together pretty much every day now!
---
Ah victory
---
&gt; And how would you accomplish this on a mobile device. 
---
I would google up how to refresh on the mobile browser I was using.  I would also Google up how to delete the mobile browser cache.
---
Well done everyone
---
Another 25% off is worth getting excited about, IMO.
---
correct. you may be able to vats someone who is wanted and crouched but otherwise thats correct. Also, you can't VATS anyone if you both enter an event (be it even involuntary like fighting in watoga and ending up inside of an Enclave event)
---
It does suck.  I run herbivore.  It helps a lot. I recommend getting herbivore or carnivore in order to eat better.  I can pick a plant and it give me 10% food without cooking.  And there is plants everywhere you go.
---
damn man, you really dont see any validity to his post huh? 17 dollars for power armor frames is ok?
---
grow up? millenial bullshit? are you @#$@#$ kidding me?
---
its the older generations that loved fallouts ans should be the champions of calling bullshit for what it is, we grew up with no micro transactions, remember how the shit hit the fan when Beth introduced Horse armor for pay&gt;?
---
and now fast forward and apologists seem to suck up all the sour milk Beth is squirting at them
---
in my experience its the millenials who are ok with micro transaction bullcrap as they were raised on smartphone games
---
No event keycards.
---
Already have newest phone.  Thanks for playing
---
What platform and what ammo? If you're PC, I'll give you some to tide you over
---
Just grab carnivore and kill something that drops meat once in a while, hunger is really a non-issue.
---
I get the same message
---
Yup! We had all of yesterday to meet the goal, AND WE DID IT FOLKS
---
Yea just the name will be different, and people are willing to pay caps just for the names 🤮
---
But how would they feel better than everyone else if they did that?
---
Seriously I’d love an assaultron guarding my camp
---
Can we not purposely crash the trade value on masks thanks
---
I like it!

---
You could do this in FO4 with the right DLC. I forget the name of it
---
Oh shit u right u right
---
Nice. I'll keep bugging ya then. 😋
---
I kind of wish that Bethesda has said we missed it ... by one.  Just one. " Sorry folks! You were *this* close!"  The website and Youtube angst would entertain for weeks and be worth (imho) far more than the additional 25% off
---
Yeah picked carnivore, melee build needs them glowing meat steaks, and it really helps with the hunger
---
Ha, your prob right. Sucks as new quests (outside of the vault raid) have been hard to come by lately.
---
Youtube Channel. RAGECHRONICLES. 
---
We do vids on PVP but its normally a bit more trash talking, etc. 
---
I can't post links here unfortunately without risking the thread because its against the rules I've been told so I won't do that.
---
Fasnacht Parade
---
Yeah just hate having to horde water
---
more thirsty than hungry i get
---
As evidenced by comments made in many of the "Are we gonna make the required total?" kinds of threads over the past weeks, I had predicted that the event would conclude with the desired results, regardless of the actual totals. I still doubt that the community was responsible for having "unlocked" anything, and that this event was  predestined to succeed, even before it had been rolled out.
---
Bethesda required something to fill the void until Wastelanders, and they certainly weren't going to  announce a 'Meat Week #3', because something as lazy as that just wouldn't fly. Bethesda's only concern was that people were playing the game, _no matter what they were doing_ (and buying Atoms, naturally).
---
So people can believe what they wish, but this was simply a marketing strategy. It was hyped too much, and Bethesda wasn't going to withhold the rewards and risk upsetting their player base, of which is already balancing precariously on a knife's edge as they await the release of Wastelanders.
---
I have mu purifiers locked, because I use them as a way to max out my vendor caps each day. I have other stuff unlocked, though, for people to take whatever they want or use whichever workbench they need.
---
I meant Assaultron Recall Keycards. They cost 2500 base cost at any robot vendor. Then you need Flourescent flux and some other junk.
---
It's all I spend my caps on, so really me charging 15k for the massive costs to me isn't overpriced
---
 
---
I think I did kinda set the tone for its value on the main trading sub, because everyone was buying from me at first on my system and when you searched for it most of my posts came up
---
Fortunately for me too since I have done exactly that.
---
That's euf info to find it, thx!!
---
I'm 47 and I think what they've done with the Atomic Shop is fine.
---
If you want something, you can grind for Atoms for it.  You don't have to pay a dime. 
---
 Plus, nothing in the Atomic Shop is vital for enjoying the game.
---
Okay that would have both incredibly infuriating and also hilarious 😂
---
If you had not left the game you could have earned the atoms in game?
---
50% off, unless you meant 25% off the usual 25% off?
---
i would have so much stash weight if it worked that way
---
I thought so but I never see it spawn the event and when I first got the game the game crashed when I tried that event. Sorry I'm on text to talk with my phone
---
Im just saying its getting worse lets say the npc update comes out and we get the ability to craft robot companions whats stoping them from adding the robot station in the atom shop for 10$ or giving normal players something like a robot slots and normal people only get 1 robot slot but you can buy more. Then whats stoping ppl from buying all the robot slots and having like 5 assault trons following them around and they just fuck with ppl. I liked the game but even stuff like the refrigerator cost atoms. Ppl are just like i can earn atoms in the game i dont got that kinda time i got a job and school i get 30 min to play max and i dont want to spend it grinding man. You guys are really just ok with this its crazy.
---
I have over 40 repair kits that come from SBQ events, I'm not too sure. Also how else do you propose Bethesda keep this game going? They could charge a monthly subscription or sell DLC. What's your opinion on that?
---
*Golf claps*
---
I think repairing things comes out of your STASH. I'm pretty sure I've repaired the extractors at Uranium Fever after coming straight from depositing everything at my CAMP.
---
Now showing 36.11m
---
Just don’t suggest she do the CAMP dishes and cook dinner
---
Please identify what you think you absolutely need to possess to play this game that you have to pay for besides the initial purchase price.

They said the atom shop was going to be cosmetic. My opinion is sell good cosmetics and ppl will buy them.
---
Unfortunate that PA removes backpacks
---
There's typically some kind of firewall at most schools that prohibits access to certain areas of the internet, as well as setting bandwidth limitations per user, so that no one user can prevent others from also accessing the internet. In short, you're never going to be able to stream a game successfully at school, and for good reason. That internet access is for you and your fellow students to be able to study etc, not game.
---
Thy would make sense, why the amount was manually updated as opposed to an in game counter. Lots of time to fudge some stats
---
Congrats everyone! 36 million Scorched kills is no small feat. Looking forward to that 50% off sale! 
---
Now if I could just get my hands on Fixer plans...
---
how cool if we get some perks that lowers junk weight in stash, or just all of one type (i must collect all typewriters!)
---
Wait until the 17th for 50% off.
---
&gt;Edit: You need 5 Demo perk card to craft a nuke mine and I decided I'm not going to waste a level up (and my build) on some unfounded wild goose chase
---
I noticed you are on PC. I can give you few, or test them with you.(preferrebly so that I try to kill you with them)
---
Good thing is 3 legendary super mutants for me to recover my lost of items
---
The bag will be sitting at the bottom of the tank, you can retrieve it with hazmat, PA, or sometimes if you dive in quickly enough after respawning you won’t take rad damage and can grab it. Been there.
---
Good advice but the last time I cleared my cache it also cleared all the pages I had opened and I'd rather not do that. I'll just stick with checking it on my PC instead lol
---
im on xbox and i did find one with a couple vendors, i wanted to buy it but i'm not paying 20K caps for it
---
As far as actual explosive weapons like a missile launcher, Demo Expert behaves like a 9 point investment in any other weapon system. The drawback is that explosives have very few other related perks, take some practice to figure out where the lobbed projectile will actually land, suffer from weak durability issues and don’t benefit from several desirable legendary effects (instigating comes to mind). 
---
Not to poo poo the build, but I’d definitely invest in a weapon system that offers you a DPS option when you’re in close quarters and/or surrounded by mobs. You’re going to have a hard time with a missile launcher in a vault raid, or even a place like the Burrows.

I turn music really low, but not off also. I like hearing it faintly behind the ambient sounds while exploring.
---
possibly I haven't played in a few months.
---
Last week I found a Hunters Long Coat for 500 caps.  Accidentally scrapped it the next day.
---
Yes we are all aware of the "it's all a marketing sceme" theory. No reason to spoil people's fun to say I told you so nothing you did mattered. Just congratulate and celebrate 50 percent off purveyor regardless of why and how we/they did it.
---
You chose a sad way to *feel* superior.
---
Nice. I've put down so many Scorched the past couple of weeks... And saved up so much script. Now to just wait for the queue to spend them at Baba Murmur's.
---
I've never had music \*on\*.  
---
I need to hear badguys sneakingup on me, alerts, and everything else that's baked into the game and since I have, like, teh worst build in history, the difference between "Did I just hear a Super Mutant  grumble?" and "RAWR!" \*bonk!\* is living or dead, yeah, no music on, ever.  
---
I can't imagine playing with anything else. How would you \*do\* stuff?
---
It does drain AP to keep moving at the normal rate but you cannot sprint? After the AP is gone its dead slow. I think I'm remembering that correctly.
---
My water purifier and junk collector are both unlocked.  It's usually full to max and not gathering anything else anyway so why let it go to waste.  
---
I also take any water I find at other camps.  Fast Traveling &amp; shopping make me thirsty.

My friends and I have spent the last week farming Encrypted, eventually we all the plan and some of us got it more than once!
---
All the time, but I'm deaf so it's not a thing for me
---
Especially if they use the voice model and script from KL-E-O.
---
I have them unlocked to keep the Vendor browsers happy. Hopefully they are more likely to purchase something when well hydrated :)
---
Now lets all mourn for the scorched that were once decent humans, cute and vicious animals that gave their lives for us......NAAAA
---
I have 2k hrs in the game and have a good understanding of the game. No.
---
Walking cane with 50% limb damage and ability to breathe under water.
---
Bonus ... speed demon, marsupial, herbivore, chameleon, grounded ... no class freak required
---
Eh, ignore the gatekeepers. I always get crap for not having beaten Skyrim or not getting into Borderlands 2. I tell them, I like what I like. Games are meant to be fun; no point in wasting time on something you're not enjoying.
---
I'd be happy to do that.  Frankly I'm curious.  What is your PC game name and I'll do a friend request as soon as the Bethesda servers come back up.
---
I wish they would have had a Christmas in July sale. Missed opportunity.
---
Love that toxic goo for maintaining rads, but I’ve never fallen into a vat of it and lost loot so I guess I’m biased 👍.
---
Correct. That’s how it works. You need to craft from scratch vs apply mod. So to be clear, you hve standard backpack from pioneer scouts and not the small backpack from Morgantown airport?
---
More junk for the trunk.

It's only worth it on two shot explosive weapons. On normal explosive weapons is a waste of points.
---
I lost everything. Went in 3 times nothing. Gave up and killed 3 lengendaries as a revenge
---
Interesting, thanks for the post about this. Reports of this have dropped off pretty dramatically recently, so I'm interested in any new cases of this issue. Will pass your info along to the dev team to help in investigation.
---
Classic
---
Any devs who want the fixer plan I'll sell you one for a private server
---
I was just thinking the same thing. If anything, my toon without speed demon is hungry/thirsty more often!
---
I thought about reducing the rank from 5 to 1 and adding three points into END for fireproof. Input? I'm a PA Heavy gunner with a 50 AA E.

 &gt; Interesting, thanks for the post about this. Reports of this have dropped off pretty dramatically recently, so I'm interested in any new cases of this...
---
its a known bug that has been reported to the CMs. no updates on when it'll be fixed though
---
Best deal for me was 249 caps for Quad +33% vats hit chance gamma gun a couple days after they started dropping with quad. Traded it for a BE Laser. 
---
Haven’t actually found anything useful for my build, but I’ve been able to flip a half dozen good items for very nice returns.
---
What did they call that again?  Oh yeah... Piracy.
---
That's great to hear! Hope you have good luck at the Purveyor this weekend!
---
That's great, I find it useful to known about mechanics to avoid them. ville80 .Yep the servers went down but should come back up in a hour or little above, since it's probably just some minor exploit fix. 
---
Im going to go buy some food but Ill be back in about an hour, and after the servers are up Im going to be playing at least few hours to do my daily stuff and all that.
---
Awesome! I hope the event is different itself, to keep things fresh, and not just different rewards.
---
to keep its little brothers and sisters company.
---
I done both and I didn’t get shit.
---
3 star board for 20 caps. Ffs +1strength bowie knifr for 100 caps. Those were the best ive seen.
---
15-20k is what they go for, maybe you get lucky and someone doesn't know the value
---
Heard it still works, but I’m not using any hunters weapons so I may have been misinformed.
---
No...the space station *was* the vault!
---
👍
---
It was a close call at 36.11 million bit woot!!
---
Depends on your build.
---
why is social interaction not considered rewarding? 
---
Some people look for a different kind of reward than physical gains.  Sometimes the experience shared with others is the reward.
---
exactly its all bs crap anywway it does nothing for gameplay. Its the players with the  whole i was born so i deserve stuff mentality that ruins everything now. Growing up i had to earn everything i got nothing was just given to me. Do you really need that 17 dollar skin that does nothing no do you want that skin just cause you want to show it off or just cause you think it looks amazing then either pay the 17 bucks or work for it period
---
It's not allowing a speed up anymore since last patch.. even with AP 1t 100% still no faster than turtle..
---
&gt;which kills them from the high radiation
---
How much rads/second are we talking here? Unless they're already heavily irradiated, people should have enough situational awareness to vacate the area  when their Geiger counter starts clicking.
---
Do you mind if I send a PS4 friend request? Always looking for people to run that event with, but luck out the majority of the time.
---
if im not on top of the bunker she always wants to gimme a kiss.. i dont mind lets the ppl who can kill her in seconds do their job
---
(It has been fixed already.)[https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/398] By modders who aren't even paid.
---
Do you prefer the “cone”, “skullcap” or the “tricorne” style when you make your tinfoil hats?  I’m a cone man, myself.
---
The mole men want to paint the moon pink and draw a Lenin face on it.
---
Never found it. At least I know now! Thanks smooth skin.
---
Hi and thanks for the report. I know this one can be frustrating and have run into it myself. We're actively looking into this event respawn issue and working to fix it as soon as possible. The fix is unlikely to make it in time for patch 14, but it is a priority for us. Will let you know as soon as I hear any updates on this one.
---
Let me know when you have a plan I’ll buy it👍
---
Same boat... except I have this problem on 3 alts ;) Wish they’d add additional scrip/day or storage. Gonna be over encumbered for days.
---
Which skins did you use?
---
Does anyone know how long the sale will last? My xbox is at home and I can only come home on the weekends
---
I can't wait for my Walking cane with 50% limb damage and ability to breathe under water...
---
Is electrically charged worth getting? Looking for something to help against all the enemies that bum rush me and I can’t afford blocker with my current build. I don’t expect the mutation to be world changing but if it’s even somewhat beneficial I may look into it
---
Yea I have a couple and they are obviously more valuable if they work on them. It doesn’t make sense to me why zealots wouldn’t work but whatever.
---
Hurray!!! Thanks to everyone who worked hard killing the scorched.  Super psyched about the flood of 3 star weapons soon to hit the market!!! Though with the amount of nukes dropped it makes you rethink the operation title “ Project Clean Appalachia”.
---
do we know when the sale begins and ends?
---
When is the 50% off sale supposed to start? I’m at max scrip right now.
---
This guy was constantly spamming nuke mines which was putting out around 25 rads per second. People where in vending machines and died before they could back out and realize what was going on.
---
Yeah it’s odd. All other fallout games I played with music. This one for some reason never have since day one. It’s great.
---
This.
---
Also sell Purified Water in my vendor for 0 caps. Should add a sign stating free water in Vendor..
---
I would love to see the percentage of people who still play the game since beta out of all current players. I assume most of them stopped playing. I did.
---
thats exactly what i do, vendor and sever hop. the most i ever paid for anything was 12K  for my medics handmade i firmly believed i got ripped off (the selling claimed it was worth 17K but didnt have the caps space). hell most people sell fusion cores for at least 100 caps each, and while just bouncing from vendor to vendor i found one that was selling fully charged ones for 10 caps each, bought all of them. felt almost guilty for it so i spent a couple hundred caps on a plan they were selling.
---
at my vender i usually end up selling stuff at a quarter the usual suggest price, dont really feel like holding on to it and just wanna make a quick couple caps
---
Nah I'm constantly over encumbered. You can walk at normal pace until ap is gone, then you slow right down. With 3 points in action boy your ap can recover fairly quickly.
---
Same here, but I am going to reset and choose by serums.
---
The class freak bugs are still around, and there seems to be a way for aggressive pvp’ers to trigger your reactive mutations.
---
Yup. Best if you clear all enemies (including medical Wong) first. Then just just pop a diluted rad x, jump in, grab junk, pop rad away, ft out.
---
Before my computer bit the dust and took all my precious screenshots with it, I had a great shot of some random player (post-event) still standing on the roof of the teapot in a rad storm. It was a great shot, but it's gone.
---
I had shown up to alone, server hopping there for the tourist. (I was stocked up on tea for forever and a day.) I did the event while I was there and three other people showed up. So it was one person at each boiler, plus the guy on the teapot. Those low level critters never stood a chance! I had done the event many times alone, but it was a lot more fun with more people. It also seemed to spawn more enemies, which was a nice change!
---
I didn't say to the sentry bot. Just open VATs in general, any target.
---
Click to permanently ignore the person they won’t ever be able to see you camp location again. Then change servers. After a few minutes switch back if you are playing with friends or something. The more they get locked out of playing vending the less they be able to do it and lose out on the system. Have your friends on that server block him too and anyone he is trying to kill at your camp. 
---
It’s not perfect but being able to hide your camp from them gives you a sense of revenge and makes it difficult for them to do it again.
---
Wise man say: Don't swim in FEV Tanks.
---
There is something crazy with mirelurk kings, man. Ever since vault 94 was released they are over the top deadly. I can face tank the queen but those things kill me faster than my stimpacks can heal me.
---
How much are you selling the plan for?
---
Yes, first time I thought someone was shooting at me, ah the good old days
---
17 - 21
---
HELLO?
---
If you're on PS4, I'll put that up in neon letters for ya
---
Upvoted for ‘flux sake.’
---
Yep we did it!  🙌
---
Now how many Roller Pins, Lead Pipes and other wonderful items will we fill up on at that 50% off sale 😂
---
I was thinking about that recently in a what if.
---
Explosive is normally +20% damage. Rank 5 demo expert brings that up to a +32% damage boost. If you plan on running the explosive heavy launchers, you’ll want rank 5 demo expert anyway so it’s worth having. If you’re strictly using guns, it’s up to you if the additional 12% is worth 5 points
---
I have 2 at my camp right now and leave them unlocked. When my camp was next to the Charleston train station I fit as many big purifiers in my half of the pond and left all open except for one, that way I always had water for crafting when I came back to my camp. I usually have a Vault Boy cutout pointing to them as well to let people know that they are open.
---
For those that like to drink more adult beverages I try to keep a few drinks in my punch bowl. Not Nukashine though, I don’t want to surprise people with that, so I sell it for cheap in my vendors.
---
I also leave my crops in an open area inside my base so that others can access them and they are protected from enemies.
---
Honestly, I’ve run into more nice people than assholes and raiders. It helps restore my faith in humanity.
---
I've been meaning to make a character like that, high charisma medic/wasteland charmer. :)
---
FYI you can exit the terminals by pressing escape. You don't need to press tab and wait for the menus, and doing it this way does not appear to be affected by a slow server. As for the server problem, keep changing servers until you get one that is more responsive.
---
Depends on the weapon and the rolls. If you are unsure of what to price an item at do a price check in the trade sub,  Or just peruse through it.
---
Better to mark them a little high and then put a sign up that says “message to barter”
---
Okay that's the clarification I needed. I just have the standard small.
---
My first build is a bloodied main handmade with a SS dcg as my second. I was planning on something like a bloodied heavy weapons/explosive build. Seems crazy ish, but I saw that fat man did 3k on my regular bloodied build, it'd be a build more for queen fights and sheepsquach. I know it'll be bad in close quarters but I'm hoping some of the heavy weapons will make that better. Idk, I'm bad with build planning. I'm still moving around my main because someone told me that non auto and unarmed doesnt go well together so I've been removing and adding other things, but then I'm also finding out they can still go together so I'm torn
---
who cares if you have the money to throw away then they have that right just like you have the right not to pay and work harder and grind to get the same.  If you get this stressed out or angry about a game you shouldnt be playing it. Now if they actually sold things that gave people and advantage it would be a different story nothing in the shop does anything of real value. so this whole topic is  pointless and a waste of time. the option is simple you either play and enjoy the game for what it is, if you want to get something earn it since your against spending money or option B dont play the damn game, it really shouldnt be causing any kind of anger or stress that you or anyone feel compelled to be outraged or stressed because you feel some one has an advantage over you. Let me be the first to tell you since you clearly dont know by now life isnt fair, someone will always have it better than you as well as someone will have it worse than you and if you spend this much time worrying about it life will pass you by.
---
2500. I saw where they can go all the way to 10. That or weightless weapon weight reduction armor.
---
I DID beat Skyrim, but only because I had been playing various characters for literally years, and it seemed dumb that I still hadn't finished the main quest. I have never played Borderlands (as a series). Or Doom. I still haven't finished The Witcher 3. It was so damn dark and dismal all the time. Then my husband got a HORRIBLE ending, and I just gave it up. At the same time, I am playing 76 having finished exactly 0 quest lines. I am pretty well done the Enclave, but have never dropped a nuke. I have finished one of three Mistress of Mystery weapons. I don't know where the Brotherhood even IS, and I am still only at the start of the raider stuff. I just... putz.
---
One thing though - we know that you can damage visitors to your camp by using flame traps  and a switch so it's entirely possibly that you can do it as well by setting off a nuke mine in some manner.
---
The O.P. is claiming that some odd combination of Plague walker and the nuke mine is killing players so I don't know how we could test this since he has been pretty short on details.  Do you have plague walker?  I have the serum but don't want to use it on my character since I hear it aggros enemies while you are trying to be stealth.    I'll trade you some Plague walker for some nuke mines if you want to try it on your character.
---
Just to be clear - I absolutely know that you can hurt/kill another player using flame  traps even if they have passive mode on.  I am unclear exactly how to test what the O.P. is suggesting since his post is somewhat vague about the procedure.
---
I think I have every one except for carnivore and herbivore. It's cool... but I added up everything and I'm down almost 10 strength points. Melee is not quite as good as it was but gun damage is up...
---
Honestly, having only the ones that compliment your build is better. I might clear them all and remutate myself.
---
I have this problem with the imposquatch.
---
I live in that acid spot near Site Alpha. Yesterday I caught a guy in his hazmat suit sneaking through all my purifiers. I laughed my ass off.
---
It's only purified water.
---
I wish bethesda, blizzard, and whoever makes the cod games would go bankrupt already
---
Wow, that was close!
---
Good job everyone 😁
---
Hold on to your legendaries and scrip them for the upcoming Purveyor sale.
---
When are you on bud?
---
The best you'd be able to do is use the small letters or even the neon ones, but a straight up "FREE \_\_\_\_\_\_" sign would be great.
---
Having the ability to eject players from your CAMP is a terrible idea since all camps are located on public space, and can be placed in areas that contain things besides the player's CAMP.
---
It would just lead to a potentially different kind of abuse.  Ultimately, if someone is really bothering you regularly, maybe put them on your ignore list, and just suck it up and realize you can easily switch sessions.  I don't doubt bad experiences exist, but you'd have to be very unlucky to have them all the time.
---
I literally laughed out loud at the mental image. Have an upvote, and thanks for sharing such a wonderful little laugh!
---
Must be some good weapons in that gallery. Hmm
---
I too had a experience with this as well a couple days ago.     was on the bleeding edge of a Nuke Zone right next to "Sunrise Field" the Mirelurk Queen and a couple kings popped up and i got wrecked pretty bad.   i was taking constant damage even when i was not getting attacked.    was crazy.
---
I should be on after work today around 6 PM EST. My gamer tag is the same name as here.
---
It’s a really interesting design I haven’t seen before. It looks... etched? Embossed? It’s cool.  
---
Not sure why the downvotes, I’m just curious about the armour.
---
I probably had a bug, no big deal, it's my second character, now I know how to farm caps. Also, after the quest do you know if there's another way to obtain the circuit/card other than buying and crafting it?
---
Why are you even here? You must live a sad life if *this* is how you get your kicks
---
Sort of yes, just servers that you personally run, so only you and people you allow can join, change up the server settings so maybe have CAMPs stay there after you log off, only level 100 enemies spawn, ammo is super rare, vendors have 50000 caps ect...
---
&gt;Screw us for wanting to use workshops the way they were intended right? Screw us for wanting to enjoy ourselves yeah? All because some snowflake wants to have an unrealistic view of how special they should be treated?
---
You know I wish I could get irrationally angry at people for wanting to play a game differently than its creators intended, and rationalize it as them needing to feel or be special. But I'm just stuck with having empathy and understanding.
---
They're a rare drop so don't expect to get them easily.
---
Solution:  College girls
---
Where we can see progression ?
---
Before the meat week it was working. I had an Hunter Gauss, SB hated it.
---
Mine is the same too, I will see what legendaries I have as well as caps, deffo want the plan though :)
---
Respecc Option for caps. Fights inflation too.
---
Very good trade!
---
around noon on Thursday
---
Isn't it weird to think that an online video game makes BOTH of us feel like maybe the whole world isn't assholes? It's supposed to be toxic and horrible, and here we are, chatting about purified water etiquette!
---
No it's just those circuit boards you need to buy and craft them.
---
Nocturnal Water Breathing  +50 to blocking Wood Arm
---
Not this coming week's raid but in 2 weeks, Raid 1 isn't so bad.  Its the only one I raid every single day now.
---
A couple days ago I found a level 20 Junkie's explosive combat rifle for under 1,000 caps.
---
Good deal. Shoot me a invite when you see me on. I'm not one of those people trying to make a killing. Ive never needed more than 10000 in game to do what I wanted to do. Id rather pass the good fortune along. Definitly would like to see what other legendaries you are working with.  What level are you in game.
---
#SPEAK UP
---
Is there a meme where they make the woosh sound but its as loud as an airplane? Because all of what I said went right over your head. You are so determined to keep these people within the view of your narrow narrative its not funny.
---
I just hope if you are ever in a situation where you desire something out of a product that isn't intended by the creator the people around you have the grace to not treat you as you seem to treat others.
---
That was part of the $35 Christmas bundle that came out a month after the game lol I don't know anyone who bought it and I've only seen those a couple times.
---
"Project Destroy Appalachia and Everything In It" was a resounding success.
---
Came here to say this.
---
Yes, agreed.
---
If they get close enough to take a swipe at you, the poison damage is mad.
---
17 -21
---
17-21
---
Ohhhhhhhhh, okay, hear me out: this guy is a duper *on top of being a griefer*.
---
Hear me out on this one. There's an exploit in game right now where you can easily dupe pretty much infinite amounts of "throwable" objects, including nuke mines. So this guy probably duped a metric crap-ton of nuke mines before his little jaunt down "I'ma ruin someone's day!" lane.
---
You can report the guy and with luck, they'll get banned for duping. Just goes to show that people who grief are also likely to be people who cheat, and we don't need that scum in the games we like.
---
The red fireplace was around for a long time, though. They didn't used to "vault" things, so that fireplace stuck around. Like the red cooking stove. But I guess a Christmas tree is rather... seasonal, so it would make sense that they would pull it down after the holidays.
---
Yeah ive seen this method alot. It absolutely wrecks server stability
---
Like everyone said, you still run at normal run speed until you run out of ap. You can't sprint tho.
---
You've probably encountered a bug that happen to me some time. Overencumbered or not. You're as slow as when you're crippled
---
I usually jump and it's fixed.
---
I'm guessing you dont play often?
---
I've already ran through 100s because of the durability of items to flux whenever we get a patch
---
Like right now I dont think heavy engery weapons arent being helped by gunsmith
---
Are they cuter/less scary when they sleep?
---
Spent so much time hunting scorched that I have almost no script to spend now. 
---
Sure hope they turn up the event timer today would be nice to see Uranium Fever for the first time this month.
---
Great answer. Thank you 👏
---
Oh man, this 100%. Getting whupped by protections of all things unless I do insane damage. Naturally same problem with Scorchbeasts, Mirelurk Queen, and Sheepsquatch too, so you can imagine how that goes lol
---
We're planning to include a fix in our next update that should help to address the looping Sentry Bot gunfire sounds.
---
It's an incentive issue.  People have often have no core principles and are behaviorally motivated by external incentives.
---
No regerts
---
Where are y ok u seeing this info? I saw 1 Twitter post not from bethesda claiming this but the image is cropped and bethesdas webpage still says 33.48..
---
Only you would get four points in an hour for making sheep noises...
---
I’m lvl 99 a shotgun build so a bit different from most, I use combat armour, what armour and weapons are you mainly on the look out for?
---
We have killed like 36x the population of West Virginia.
---
Yeah, most appreciated weapon prefixes would be Anti-Armor, Bloodied and Junkies, and Instigating for certain one-hit kill weapons, along with Explosive as secondary prefix. Third slot varies, but vats for guns, STR for melee, and 90% weight reduce for heavy weapons are good stuff.
---
Handmade rifle and the new combat rifle: The Fixer seem to triumph, but with the right legendary prefixes, anyone would buy it from you, probably ranging between 15k and 30k caps.
---
The armor is generally even more valuable to the right person, as people might be collecting very specific pieces. Here the type doesn't matter too much as long as it's Heavy, or Marine. The prefixes here would be Unyelding, Bolstering, Chameleon or Vanguards, depending on the build of the buyer. Then people like carry weight reduction, esp. ammo and weapon. Also AP refresh is really good to have on up to three pieces
---
I go for the cheap sheep
---
I was with you up until you said millennial bs. Come on, not all of us are the stereotype. Cant stand when people generalize all younger people into a "lazy and inpatient" group. Some people just suck. It's not a whole generation.
---
That... doesn't really answer the question, that's more of a flex.
---
Friends with paranoia
---
I give props to people that set traps in their camps.  
---
You should be on edge playing this game!
---
next update sounds amazing from what I can tell!
---
You must go through food at an alarming speed!
---
Heavy/Explosive seems like it’ll synergize reasonably well. Carrying a pile of mini nukes, missiles or grenades could get heavy without being able to fit Ordinance Express into your perks, and excavator is probably the worst option for battle armor. Given that a great legendary 50cal, LMG or gatling style weapon can easily solve any combat related problem, maybe the explosive weapons aren’t really needed aside from personal amusement.
---
My gauntlet build carries a B/FFR lever gun for a ranged option, and it works well enough. My build is fully invested in unarmed, but I put three perks into PER for the ability to swap Commando or Rifleman perks with Glow Sight or lockpicking. Sometimes enemies fly or refuse to come down from a ledge. It’s wise to have something to deal with that situation, I think. Any automatic rifle will almost certainly out-DPS the lever, but .45 is ubiquitous and the lever gun has terrific hipfire accuracy and ammo efficiency. 500 rounds is more than enough for almost any situation, considering that I switch to a meat hook the second anything is within striking distance. It’s a back up gun.
---
Xbox?
---
Use gums, it decrease hunger and thirst rate by 50%,negates SD effect.
---
Looks like Blood raider right arm, Liberty Prime torso, Bone Raider left leg, base right leg, chrome helmet, not sure about left arm?
---
That is gold! Good find!
---
Whitesprings sentry bots are the easiest way I've found. So easy that you don't really need to stock up. Whenever you get down to 1 or 2 just pop over there and get another 4 or so.
---
I’ve been banned for 4 months and too lazy to appeal
---
&gt;Is electrically charged worth getting?
---
IMO, none of the AoE mutations are worth it. The damage to enemies is negligible given the drawbacks. Plus, if you don't have pacifist turned on people can attack, trigger your mutation, and draw you into PvP.
---
I can understand items/caps and all that to deter dupers or whatever their reasons are, but not "one time" earnable camp items like the fasnacht plans were. It just deters making other characters, I'm playing on my crappier character just because it happened to be the one I was using during the event.

---
After testing and tuning, what I do:
---
- bad legendaries. I scrip them myself.
---
- decent/usable legendaries, that I don't need. I sell them at +40c/*. if they don't sell fast I scrip them.
---
- top legendaries. I keep them for myself or for future trades.
---
ok ok i might have generalized too harshly but the stereotype is not wrong for a lot of people
---
Dude, I don't even know what that IS! Or I didn't, until I googled it. A solid find!
---
Tbh, better than nothing unfortunately
---
If you're slightly over weight, you can walk at a normal pace until you run out of AP.  At that point you slow down until your PA recovers some.  You can't sprint.
---
If you're *grossly* overweight, you will walk at a crawl, period.  No normal walking pace, no sprinting.
---
It's been that way for a long time (if not since launch), and was that way yesterday when I was on  Nothing has changed that I can tell.
---
Instruments just give an AP regen bonus, but it's a nice buff tho.
---
CAN ANYBODY HEAR ME?
---
can I get one please please please??? JLPerdigao is my PSN im on PS4. thank you!!!
---
Oooooooooooooh shit
---
What's so important about the fixer?
---
That was close! You got hugely lucky there!
---
Lemme break it down then, the move over one per lvl means you will always be working 2wards the perfect build or make a new character, say if your 200 or more then respecting is a pain. Hence a new character, but if we could respect completely every say 50 lvls then people would not be working 2wards anything and modifying they're build. This is ignoring the fact that 90% of the player base are snowflakes that play as food builds and wouldn't know 2 min max if it bit them in the ass. But my point stands, progression over time is far better than instant satisfaction. Instead of instantly coming out the vault and hitting 50, your instead having 2 work for it. So no. We good?
---
You monster, there are starving kids in china that could use that water
---
Zealots and hunters both works against scorched and scorchbeasts. Hunters is generally more useful though since it works against the other animals too, whereas zealots only works against scorched versions of enemies. 
---
However, zealots is quite useful in the SBQ fight vs all the scorched enemies that show up
---
I agree, but talk to the devs like they’re actual people
---
Nope, you're wrong. They said "it's not going to be pay to win".
---
Bonus tip: with pharma farma, CHECK THE MIRRORS in any bathrooms you come across. 
---
Super easy to overlook these when you're running through
---
A pat on the back for every vault dweller out there. Wether you were enclave, free states, responders or raider, you helped figth for a the people america.
---
Its a shame that the BOS, dint do anything. Those power armor boy-scouts are nothing more than common criminals, with access to some antiquated technology.
---
Please read our wiki page on this subject
---
I'm pretty sure I got the plans from when I was doing the keycard quest or after it, the event. First time, though.
---
Yeah I know, shame really as it looked like they had some other interesting bits.
---
Was one of those camps built sky high over a cliff, with something like 25 weapons and 27 armor showing in the preview
---
Yeah.  No doubt.  I think the publishers got 10 players with the revenue of 1 most of the 90s
---
Do you mean the radio or the combat music?? I personally only have the radio on when I’m bored or spending some time at my camp
---
I just price it high. If its still there in a few days drop price. If v confused ask for a value in the sub or do a post asking for offers. The value varies on who wants to buy it
---
The trade sub prices are confusing. 30k for some outfits, 500 caps for 500 scrap wood lol, legacies for 100k+, the stuff ive junked or sold dirt cheap and lost caps on is crazy. But one mans junk is another mans treasure
---
Oooof
---
All right everyone, let's grind those legendaries to get that scrip. *proceeds to March to West Tek and White Springs
---
no. WWR #4 has very diminished returns and #5 is entirely pointless.
---
I highly recommend using only 3, plus you can have better benefits for 4 and 5 that truly suit your personal build.
---
The only way you can do it involves 2 people who both have maxed out rad resist and 1 of them sharing rank 3 rad sponge. Even then you'll burn through radaway because the perk doesn't proc quite fast enough sometimes.
---
Yeah I’ll buy most anything priced under 200 as long as it has at least one star ;) 
---
Got keep those scrip machines fed
---
Best part is they can very easily make infinite nuke mines right now
---
As long as you don't mind gimped energy weapons and lower xp rate.
---
No. It goes down to 90% reduction. I have a full set of weapon weight reduction and my hand mades weight 2.3 lbs, down from 23.
---
Feel i should sell my chameleon vanguards marine at max lvl. Or scrip it...
---
At least they haven't added anything to the atomic shop that doesn't have a better free alternative.
---
Thx so max is 60 procent
---
Ok thx
---
Okay I'll give it a shot!
---
Something realistic, probably atom shop based, but a wood pallet for your camp that allows you to store 500 wood weigh free, and so on, for common resources.
---
Drums for oil, acid, a loom for cloth, etc
---
That's easy to see why, they did it because of the different stat sets. My high strength character would have a completely different loadout than my low strength character, for example.
---
I love when games spill over into real life. Just... maybe avoid hoarding plastic and screws. Loved ones might become concerned.
---
I'm just curious, is that how you usually spell cooperation?
---
I make and sell Bloatfly syringers on PS4. If you ever need one let me know. It’s a fun little business venture I took on when I realized I just don’t have the mountain of gear to be competitive in the high stakes trading market.
---
I glitched in this area yesterday but I didn't find any vault door. Is it behind the closed door with rotten scorched in front of it?
---
I sometimes find my junk bag spawns about 2-3 metres behind my death location. You may be lucky?
---
Definitely agree with this, I'm the EXACT same way.
---
'The Snorkel'
---
nah, you would do the math for the first reduction then the next piece decreases what is remaining. the third only does a little, but enough to notice. (4 is barely a fraction, 5 is approaching zero)
---
Shocked! Shocked, I tell you!
---
Sorry.. it has not been that way.. I've been at 900 lbs and walked using AP.. when it runs out snail pace. but right now I get snail pace at 1 lb over carry limit.
---
Hard to tell if numbers were even correct as I can't see Bethesda adding a counter to count number of scorched killed and do it without adding all the duping exploits back. And they also stated they would manually do the updates hence why counter didn't move over the weekend.
---
I think it’d be cool if it benefitted from basher perks since it’s held like a gun. It desperately needs a base damage buff too though
---
The vats are safe to swim in. Do you have the Aquaboy perk?
---
As many I can use that are beneficial except Egg Head as it smash your stats if try to enjoy the game solo.
---
damn, that's actually a good saying
---
I wouldn't mind a weight reduction on Stable Flux.  Keeping a small supply on hand for emergencies adds up quickly.
---
Does that mean strange in numbers increases it further?
---
Nta. Mine are free to travellers yet i rarely see them looted
---
Companions in games are, for me, like companions in real life. If I don't like you, you need to shut up and go away. I find someone with a story and whom I LIKE can be a joy in a game. But then there are the other followers. The ones who talk incessantly. The ones who are needy. The ones who are always in the way. Nope, it's Dogmeat or bust.
---
I just want to do the event i will try amd find you
---
3....I run speed demon, healing factor and grounded. My brother and my niece both use every one and they “seem” fine
---
Does it stagger enemies or slow them down at all? If so then I would take it just to buy myself some breathing room. If not then it sounds like it isn’t worth bothering with
---
Well there goes my stash space
---
Happens to me all the time on alternate character, if I die before getting the loot it will often make loot disappear on some of the bodies but main works fine.
---
I'm fairly certain that Class Freak *does* reduce the hunger/thirst meter drain to 12.5%, but it just doesn't display that on the pip-boy... I saw a video on YouTube awhile back where someone compared the difference with and without Class Freak.
---
Still no Halloween stuff? :(
---
I actually hope to get a good rolling pin
---
[Seems familiar](https://laughingsquid.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Last-Cat.jpg)
---
TSE BINOCULARS
---
Nah, it's a good leveling weapon, someone would easily pay 5-10k for that.
---
I won't be surprised if it gets delayed myself. To me, all evidence seems to indicates a very small number of people work on this game at all any more.  Bug fixes take ages if they come at all.  The Vault Raids were pretty abysmal both in design and performance.
---
Then again, they met their own dead line set for the Vault Raids even though the lag was often game breaking and should have resulted in a delay.  Maybe they will just release Wastelanders when the time comes regardless of what issues it has.
---
Might get a drill.
---
If you're just looking for something to snipe lower level mobs I'd go with a lever rifle. It's the best compromise between weight and damage. I have zero perks in rifleman and my instigating level will do 1.5k on a sneak headshot, which is enough to take out all but the strongest mobs in one shot.
---
Want to make a report about this, but I don't know which category to report it under, can someone help me here.
---
Don't know what to tell you, it was fine for me just last night.  I always end up over weight on SBQ, and last night's fight was the same as before.  I was walking full speed but unable to sprint until after the fight when I swapped my PA off and perks back to normal.
---
It's not something that changed in the game, it has to be something on your end that's bugged.
---
I did the same thing; stopped watching videos etc. until I could play. You only get one first run at a game.
---
Is that a recent change, or just an assumption? Last I checked, WWR armor stacked additively, so piece 4 had exactly the same weight reduction as piece 1, with piece 5 having half the effect.
---
Weapon weight reduction armor stacks multiplicatively with weapon weight reduction perks though.
---
Mods seem not to be affected by the perk.
---
I can respect, and understand your opinion, but the reason I believe the change should exist is because of how much work you'd have to put if you as you said make food builds (I'm sure everyone have seen people who obviously had no idea what they were doing with their build prior to starting.) 
---
Everyone will still have to earn perk cards, and level them up as you have to, but it's to at least make the grind to do that much more tolerable at least. Considering that if your build sucked you might as well just make a new character considering the trouble it'd be to respec the character
---
I believe so
---
We know!
---
I've never understood why people do this (PS4) -- how am I meant to send you a message?
---
What the actual fuck....same old crap ! They MUST suck every penny out there and they can't actually remove something for good.
---
Scout if possible but max level weightless and weapon weight reduction is my main focus right now.
---
That is great! Thanks for letting us know!
---
I just hope the game can handle it I understand Beth giving folks what they want but....not sure we can take a game performing worse than the current state.  I say this at times but the times are too many.
---
For me it was how DEPRESSING things are in the Witcher. It's always so dark, corpses everywhere, people being raped and tortured... It stopped being fun and started making me unhappy.
---
By contrast, Fallout as a series is a joy. Sure, the world as we knew it is over, but there is always something to make you smile, to make you think, to make you HAPPY. There's that follower you really like, or that haunted house in NukaWorld. There's so much discovery, and so little time to look at all the horror.
---
Just let me know man. Last night was a great night for it. The server I was on had it pop 4 times 😆
---
I'm sure the halloween stuff will come out the week of the event
---
I wish I did, that would score me a place with the cool boys
---
Bethesda "We heard your complaint so we decided to make queen spawn only work if hit directly on top of Queens nest so now its always irradiated and the nuke code needed is now random for everyone to prevent users from cheating a large portion of the game so good luck out and XOXO from your favorite Dev Team"
---
Canada has a population of 37 million.
---
Fallout 76 players killed some 36 million scorched.
---
Just let that sink in.
---
Gunslinger does boost it but it also got a stealth buff with patch #10 nearly doubling its base damage so you can certainly afford to run without perks if you were used to it’s performance before
---
i have 7 weightless pieces i use occasionally, 5 of them WWR. when i use all 5 i see a &lt;1lb decrease (ie. no visual change in lb#) when i place piece 5 after piece 4.
---
i promise ill return the favor !! , water in this game is really important D:
---
Yeah :(
---
And then you can try berserker weapons as a bonus prize!
---
Whatever you do, make sure you have Green Thumb equipped when harvesting flora ingredients and have both Chemist *and* Super Duper equipped when crafting chems. You will always get double with Chemist and possibly more with Super Duper.
---
Thanks!!
---
How many atoms was the survivalist outfit going for? It says owned, I might get it if its decent.
---
Um, I think they prefer *Irradiated Persons*.
---
The nerfed shotguns by nerfing TSE, which was the only thing that made shotguns "overpowered".  On their own, they're pretty awful.
---
Jeez man you guys were steamrolling the game (not hating). I don't think I left the forest.
---
What does it mean when even the weekly Atomic Shop updates have become lackluster?
---
sign in required my man, coz of erotic stuff
---
are they selling atomic porn? I'd buy atomic porn
---
Same, can confirm. It's nice being a walking armory tho. :P
---
On Xbox I just message through the gamer tag. Idk how that works on PS4.
---
If I ever see another free states or raider item again it would be too soon
---
The game is easy enough as is, make people work for something. Everything else is handed 2 them
---
Can't agree more. To hear the trudging of feet above when inside a building, the creaking of the towers as you're passing by, the sound of gunfire in the distance.  If I know I'm going to be crafting and not out killing, I'll put my custom FO soundtrack on. Otherwise, ambient noise is definitely the preferred method for me.
---
Not before update 14 drops. It is very possible that we get the Halloween stuff in the last october week.
---
Wet Blanket time: I wonder if BGS edited the numbers to let us get the goal since we were so far away from it.
---
I'm just excited!
---
I still play. I've met a great group of people and we still derp around. If no one is on I'll do atom/scrip stuff and log off.
---
I've been playing FNV on XB1, runs great although it's odd running it w/o mods as I played on PC before. Great vanilla textures said no one ever.
---
Faster Fire Rate is as valuable as Exploding.  Vampires is a top tier prefix too.  Furious and Executioners are also strong prefixes.
---
Yup, here's the info from the wiki and link to it:
---
&gt;Weight reduction effects on armor stack up to (20%/40%/60%/80%/90%) for each type, instead of a complete 100% reduction. When used with any weight reduction perk, the cap remains at 90% reduced weight. The reduction effects are additive but do not exceed 90% reduction. For example, combining the 75% reduced junk weight perk with 20% reduced junk weight armor does not cause an item weighing 10 pounds to weigh .5 pounds (10 * 0.05) or 2 pounds (10 * 0.25) * 0.8) but rather 1 pound (10 * 0.1). 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects
---
I got the same thing.. F-ckout76?
---
I had to ask someone to jump off a bridge this morning. It was for a good cause though. I needed those atoms, lol! I jumped afterwards so they could get the atoms too. Helping your fellow man counts as goodwill and kindness, right? Lol!
---
I don't PvP, but I would be willing to try that. That has the potential to be a lot of fun. Though I think it would work best with real role-playing. Doctors in full uniform, swooping down on a battlefield to help people out. Policemen who track down Raiders... you could really make something from that...
---
As far as I know it doesn't work on PS4 (outside of friend list), but yet there's a pile of those labels on vendors.
---
To me, that's the great thing about gaming. There's no right or wrong way to play. If you're having fun doing small tedious sidequests and don't even care about the main story, who cares? You're having fun.  You can play any character how you want, and take as much time as you want. Enjoy it your way; don't mind how others tell you to.
---
As long as you're having fun, that's what counts. Game on.
---
Yeah, I've done Uranium Fever maybe 5 times since the update. Free Range maybe 4 or 5 times. Haven't seen One Violent Night at all since the update.
---
I do not remember stable or smooth on XB1. I was running an old XB1 though and now run a 1 X which seems to help.
---
800
---
If you are using vampire with vanguard, your main issue will be with offense not defense. Inveest in tank killer, glow sights, and bloody mess in favor of more defensive perk cards.
---
Your truly the best community manager. Blessed we had you through this mess.
---
You must be new here. They "fixed" this like 5 months ago.
---
As a naive buyer of the fridge, I honestly fking regret buying it. That bitch takes literally 15 items. Not stacks. ITEMS. 15 CORNS. Wtf?
---
How? My BE Combat Shotgun can do over 600 damage with no shotgun perks.
---
I wave at everyone I see. Bet I start waving at NPCs with Wastelanders. I don't have to stop for a chat, but I can be friendly without it. And if someone I wave at DOES need help with something, now they know I'm friendly.
---
That theres some big events planned in the not too distant future?
---
It is still a PvP zone so if you want to play tower defence without other players bothering you should play something else. The game nor its players are not going to bend to your will you because you want to play the "fun" defence of a meaningless workshop. It is just common sense pal.
---
I leave mine open as a courtesy to visitors. I'm in the forest near the overseer's camp, so I get lots of lower level folks strolling through. Take water, take food from the garden. Pay it forward when you can.
---
I'll just clarify that Hunters doesn't work against plain Scorched, in case it wasn't obvious. Otherwise there is a large crossover.
---
Must be nice. That has literally never worked for me T\_T.
---
Damn your math was pretty close.
---
Ah cool thanks!  I’ll try that tonight!
---
Almost every event in the forest has at least small chance of rewarding you with a 1 star armor piece, so try to do Fertile Soil, Powering Up Poseidon, Messenger events, etc. Even if you don't get a legendary piece, you're guaranteed a plan or recipe every time, so they're worth doing either way.
---
They added the Fixer (in addition to a few other quest-only weapons) to the list of potential random legendaries for sale by the vendor.  But it will only be added to the random drop list for you if you already know the Fixer weapon recipe.  The stealth adders, in addition to other legendary effects, make for a pretty good rifle option.
---
I still need scrip ....
---
And duping all the mines surely doesn't help with serve stability. Steel and mines can be easily duped if you didn't know. At least as of last week.
---
Hand someone a Vintage Nukashine and tell them that you remember the game from before this was a thing!
---
Got any Bear arm plans?? In need of 2
---
nope, also does not apply when bulking junk or crafting booze.
---
No.
---
I’m on PS4 and have the plan in my vending machine.  Duke_Silver13
---
No it only activates when you craft something, so scrapping junk or converting junk into bulk does count
---
Learning new things about yourself through video games? I like it! Much more positive than the "video games cause violence" shtick.
---
well i figured as much becuase i am one of those completionists and like i said i have over 2000 hours and had never seen it
---
This and we should be able to TRADE them with other players, since they are TRADING CARDS.
---
Cant wait to spend all my script on rolling pins and fat mans.
---
It's amazing how 100 players killed 30 odd million scorched ..badoom tishhhhh.....
---
my most recent steal, just last night I bought a 3\* bloodied 44 pistol from the Watoga train station for 60 caps.
---
Yeah I consider 60-80 to be in " potentially most dangerous" as its surprisingly often freshly prepared perfectly geared alt of somebody with more decked out characters
---
You have probably the best legendary affix combo possible for a shot gun.  Try playing a shotgun build with out explosive and/or bloodied.  Bloodied is def the OP meta now.
---
And no fix for the Atom shop Camo Paint not showing in the menu anymore thats like 3 weeks since i sent Bethesda a ticket and they said they are aware and investigating it.
---
We are too!
---
I’d say it’s only the green one. Shame cause the grey is def better.
---
I mean tbh I love free states but yeah no faction should overstay their welcome
---
Haven’t come across a legendary in a station vendor for months!
---
What? This game has enough players to kill 36 million monsters? NOooo NOOOOOOOOOOO LALALALALALALALALALALALALA NONONONO LALALALA
---
I don't know why I need /s but here you go
---
I only use diluted with the chemist perk and dont even keep normals on me. I dilute them all or sell them. I carry 20 and have about 60 stored, just pop them during battle to stay alive if needed. Not into mutations and tbh i feel with them the game may end up a bit easy. Its just like a potion in eso or something just dont ignore your health bar
---
Fair, and a better way to put it. Thanks!
---
Sorry, sold my only two
---
My people! I stole not only the game, but the console! My husband finally bought me Skyrim on Steam so I would give him back his PS3! I had more hours of that than anything except maybe Sims, and that has no... 'game', per se. Now 76 is my bag, baby. I pull myself away sometimes, but 76 is 'home'.
---
This isn't correct. The pip-boy text is simply unconnected to the actual effects of the mutation. In fact the mutation interaction with Class Freak was fixed a couple of patches back, but they didn't bother with the text.
---
Ask any competent data miner. The +/- thing was a myth. Class Freak works on keywords and a lot of hardcoding, not numerical signs.
---
I've seen amazing damage numbers for Junkie's as well. Furious and Vampire's also work amazingly becaue of how pellets work, and AA is very strong on shotguns as well. Bloodied has been the best since January, but it's definitely not the only good effect.
---
WHERE IS THE HALLOWEEN STUFF!  I WANNA GET SPOOKY!
---
Thanks! Maybe I'll wait until it goes down lmao
---
What? I always trashed them lol I'm gonna go kill myself
---
thank YOU mate, have a lovely day
---
Played since BETA and even played literally every day up till April 2019 but still played it once a week but for my experience whats changed is theres less crashing/disconnects but thats not normally an issue in the first place for major games like Warframe or Metal Gear Survive surprisingly so the fact its less doesn't make me happy but annoyed its still a thing. Secondly I'm dissatisfied with games new content especially new vault raids as it poorly made and nothing but a chore. Would be happy if they just changed respecing options or made plans carry over to alts and not to mention the horrid legendary system which is about winning the lotto and trying to get the perfect weapon is near impossible as most of my time in game has been farming legendaries and only change I noticed is lowered amounts of legendaries instead of making it reasonable to acquire your desired weapon. In short the game is poorly made and I fear for the Fallout Series future.
---
TLDR
---
\-Less crashes but shouldn't even have any period
---
\-New Content like Vault Raids Suck
---
\-Game needs changes to respecing and also legendary drop lottery system
---
\-I regret my purchase but play it still because I love Fallout but I hate Bethesda
---
weird, i didnt get that message, but earlier today here in a different post some guy linked to an imgur gallery listing his weapons, and it was blocked too!
---
Fake News
---
How do you get Fixer plans?
---
I know there's a lot of dead vault 94 dwellers scattered around the map but I've never heard of 10 being in a single area. That's really interesting.
---
May I get on as well . I will pay you caps. What’s your PSN?
---
Interesting I have not seen that before
---
That sucks :(
---
Fisto for 2,000 Atoms :P
---
Yeah that's a no buy then.
---
The problem with that is that they'd have to pay, and I think not just once, to host those songs in an online game, unlike the previous ones in which the licensing was a one time deal.
---
A solution could be an instanced radio. Everyone puts whatever they want to listen in a folder on their own machine and the same radio gives everyone different music. This way music is not a problem anymore, they don't have to pay anything and we avoid the problem of public player run radios.
---
I think it's a limited item. You might have to grind challenges.
---
Here, I logged in with an alt to get those prices: https://imgur.com/a/tg2M6Ey

I keep coming back to look at Ark, and having to remind myself that not every online game is like this one. After 76, I started looking at games like Ark, RDR2 online, ESO... They all look and sound stupendous! Until, of course, you hear some of the reviews. With the exception of 76 and ESO, a lot of them seem toxic. And ESO is so bloody huge that I have no idea what to do, where to go, or who all these random people are who are running everywhere looking like they spent a fortune on mounts and pets.
---
76 seems to be my online game, and I love it. Now I just need to take this whole community with me to try something new! :S
---
i bought my 2 \* quad faster fire rate tesla at a vendor for 2k caps lol   ..that poor guy had no idea
---
Sleep, locks, terminals, craft cheap stuff, sleep more, quests, kill everything, most stuff gives xp.
---
If you try, 2 lvls a day shouldnt be too hard. Just do what everyone is saying and its pretty quick
---
So question about the free states jet pack. 
---
Does it replace the skin of what it’s attached to (I.e. removes Liberty Prime torso skin)?
---
What if you jet pack is glitched and attached to another piece of power armor, like an ultracite arm, can it still be painted?
---
They should rotate weekly rather than coming in these huge blocks. Raiders one week, free states the next, the BOS, etc, then back around again
---
It cost a decent amount of caps to claim workshops all spammy like that..
---
Don't believe it tbh. But don't do that regardless. People will miss you my guy
---
thank you !!
---
Holy shit, we killed Canada
---
F Yeah! Great job community
---
I’ve been disappointed with the last 3 atom shop updates. Just give me new stuff 😫😂
---
I always check. There was a 2\* piece of armor in there for less than 200 caps, too. Bought that and into the Legendary machine it went.
---
Agreed
---
I was worried when I picked it up that it would be TOO lonely. I got it to play with my husband, and figured that would be the only time I played. But I LOVE the loneliness and quiet!
---
There is nothing on any of the brahmin corpses, it's not like finding the dead super mutants.
---
 I'd like to think we have a psychopathic possum afoot.
---
Someone fill me in on this. Why is the Fixer Plan worth so much now? Been out of the loop for most item values on the market.
---
Know anyone that has any??
---
Someone was selling plasma cores for a cap each. I bought them all.
---
limited doesn't mean it's gone...it will be back....like all their stuff!
---
Super happy to see Free States stuff coming back but i'm sure that's not all of it i'm sure there was 2 kinds of backpack skins and some camp stuff
---
There's more responder items in game and there are Responder skins in the shop. But I'll agree there should have only been 1 not 2.
---
Does it minimize the effect, the time it lasts, or both? I started SELLING my Rad-X because I couldn't handle the slow movement, low jump height, and inability to fall any sort of distance.
---
This isn't a new thing though.  The last couple weeks have only seen a tiny bit of new content, and are mostly recycling previously Vaulted items.
---
Whats worse about shotguns is a point blank headshot dropping health to 0 then going right back to max. I still use my vamps combat as it melts with enough ammo, but imo thats one of the worst bugs in the game
---
More reason to keep building up atoms.
---
Take my upvote as well. There's unfortunately quite a few people on this subreddit who think you should know everything there is to know about Fallout, and if you don't know everything there is to know about Fallout, they downvote you and/or talk down to you instead of politely educating you.
---
You need fireproof if you plan on using an explosive weapon with power armor. It’s mandatory.
---
Honestly changing up sound is a good way to make things interesting. I struggled playing without music so I played with the radio on for a while. Took it off and it changed everything.
---
29th of October is on a Tuesday. My guess is that's when we'll get actual new stuff.
---
Please do!
---
Really rare. Spent 10 keycards and didn't get any. I spend all my caps on keycards. I usually get one to pay for the next round of runs. So I'm dry for a couple of days while I refresh my limit
---
I hadn't realized that you could get that much benefit from raw plants. I might have to investigate this, and turn all the meat into fertilizer for my explosives... Thanks for the tip!
---
Doesn't apply to crafting alcohol
---
Sorry nope
---
No, you will need the 1 star Scrapper perk in INT to get extra materials from scrapping weapons and armor.
---
Scrapper will get you extra stuff from armor and weapons, and increases based on your INT stat.  (for example, with an INT of 5 an assualt rifle will break down into 18 steel.  With a 15 you will get 20 steel)
---
There is no perk that allows you to get extra scrap from normal "junk" items.
---
I knew I Should have edited my post to include junkie, but yes, junkie/bloodied are def the meta.
---
My point is that the game shouldn't be balanced around OP legendary affix combos which will eventually get nerfed.  The game should be balance around what the average player can expect to acquire - which is probably more likely a 1-2 star legendary shotgun if they're lucky, with likely bad affixes or a crafted shotgun.
---
Legendary affixes of the perfect type should make you overpowered due to the rarity - it shouldn't be the expectation.
---
True that.
---
Keep stacking up atoms in the meantime 😁
---
Doesn't matter because we're shooting them all anyway.
---
It just doesn't actually suppress your mutations, works half as good as non diluted and it gives you a +5% disease chance ,but you can still run n jump lol
---
They announced there will be cultists and hunted there might be more.
---
Loads of people bought the Free States junk - no wonder they brought it back.
---
So that you break even? That's... wow. I had never thought about that. I always leave the gums behind!
---
If you're on PS4 and will be on after 5PM  EST tonight, I have hundreds of them that I'm constantly dropping to make room in my stash. You're welcome to many.

We killed 1/9 of the total population of America
---
And that's just only in this past few weeks. For all I know, we've probably killed *even MORE* than there are in America!
---
That's correct for junk &amp; food/chems but weapon weight reduction is slightly weirder: The WWR perks stack multiplicatively with WWR armor, so you can actually drop the weight of weapons by up to 99% by stacking both.
---
Careful with the goo piles...
---
You can still get a non legendary shotgun easily ofer 200 or 300 damage with a build for it?
---
No even the orange pipboy!
---

I'm Level 137 and a couple days ago I dropped in on Uncanny Caverns. I ran into a 3\* Legendary Mirelurk King and he kicked the living hell out of me while I was in my Excavator armor. Left me dead on the steps in a couple swipes. I went back in, chemmed up, threw a couple nuke grenades at him to loosen him up, hit him with a couple crit shots, and I still had to spam my stimpaks to keep from dying a second time. He put up one hell of a fight. Ended up getting a 3\* Instigators baseball bat for my trouble. Mirelurk Kings are no joke, particularly when they're legendary. They've got that damage over time effect that beats you into oblivion.
---
I want Children of Atom.

West Virginia has a population of  1.79 million people,  where did the rest of the 34.32 million Scorched come from?
---
It doesn't effect it AT ALL? I'm going to have to stop selling it all!
---
Well i thought the same. Copyright might be a problem. But i also think that Bethesda is finacially strong enough to do that.
---
You get the weapon, not the plan. You need the plan for the legendary fixers to drop from Mole Mama. Mole Mama is the only way to get legendary fixers. Legendary fixers are the best guns in the game now, DPS wise as well as utility
---
Nope, it applies to most chem and ammo crafting and also cooking food.
---
What’s everyone’s opinion on spending script on 2 star ranged weapons, opposed to 3 star. I watched a video that was saying the third star isn’t really worth it for ranges weapons and to just go for 2 stars?
---
is 2-3 hours most days not a lot?  I have done a lot of queen fights.
---
Good to know. I haven’t been inside that place for a long time. Totally different now.
---
Pretty sure you're over thinking it, friendo. It's just a game lol
---
There probably won’t be any news about it until they’re ready to release.  Wastelanders will probably change the game in fundamental ways that will make the game much better.  But if, for example, Bethesda came out tomorrow and said that they’re rebalancing legendary effects then you really have no reason to play until you know what will be good.
---
I can assure you I am completely serious, considering the LGBT+phobia that tends to float around Reddit and has been observed in Fallout!Appalachia.
---
I can't wait to go through my 1000 points in 5 minutes and get nothing useful from the purveyor!
---
Had that yesterday. Re logged and it woke up. One server completely deleted the quest from my pip boy, i ragequit about to punch my screen and when i re logged it came back. Good luck...
---
That is pretty terrible tbh
---
You don't have twisted muscles on a melee build? May I ask why?
---
Thank you for your service stranger
---
How about this? https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#AwwHBQMECwcBAQEMAgMGBwQJCg0ODxATIk8CCwMkA3cDewG1AQN4A3wBgAEDuwEDNgJ+AkgD8AEDpQEBPwPEAQMA
---
How? That's probably the highest nonlegendary damage of regular bullet weapons.
---
I helped
---
SMH
---
At this point I’m just going to give up and decorate my camps with the X-mas decorations.
---
We did it gamers!
---
Too cheap i don't believe you
---
Haha! I remember the first time I got a mutation. I had been chilling in the water to see what I would get. Egghead. Over and over again. Finally gave up and went without until I found my serums merchant. He got friend listed fast...
---
no Tenderizer? or Bear Claw? yet?
---
Haven’t seen a bunch together before. They’ve been adding little set piece changes to the map over the last few months, this may be one of them.
---
Not even going to log in for the sale. I don’t need another useless 20 +250 damage resist while reloading pos weapons thanks
---
What's a fixer? And why are they so expensive?
---
Exactly what he meant.
---
Congrats! I wouldn't still be playing 76 if it wasn't for my lady, we've both been playing since Beta and this is her first fallout she's played, best of luck in the wasteland!
---
Its space filler until they drop another update. 
---
You've got another week coming of it too I bet
---
Oh. So I can sell mine for scrip.
---
You take zero rads in the FEV vats with Aqua boy. If you put on Aqua boy perk and go for a swim in the FEV vats you will find some interesting stuff in there.
---
Well, yeah. There hasn't been a patch to add any. Probably next week when patch 14 rolls out.
---
I definitely recall getting a plan for the gun from the end of the quest along with the gun itself back when that quest went live, since I have it learned  and I've never successfully completed Encryptid to this day. Which is why I was wondering this in the first place
---
I’m guessing you don’t have any of the fixed plans do you??
---
Because you aren't taking into account all the downsides of using a shotgun - like the expensive ammo, the fact that the range is very particular (even if you're just slightly outside of the effective range all your pellets hit for 1 damage regardless, bad formula).
---
There is a reason we're seeing every build these days is melee or commando
---
Its really weird, I'll see If I can take a photo, it has its own paint job, so if you put it say on the raider skin, it has all the free states stuff on it,  but doesn't mesh with the raider PA in that example
---
Best weapon in the game. Just recently had legendary versions released. It's an extremely rare drop from a high level event that usually ends in failure unless people know what they're doing. I've sold over a dozen at that price
---
Well it's a good thing that no one is forcing you to! Your negativity is unnecessary! Go play something else!
---
I've had such a bad run I'm due a couple god rolls lol
---
 Underrated comment.
---
None at the moment, but I'm gonna do some more Encrypted later with my teammates to try and get more fixer plans!
---
Am I the only one that has skins, camp items, and other stuff from atom shop and STILL has 4k atoms without buying any ever? You can get 20-30 a day with minimal effort and more if you spend more time and challenges aren't the BS ones. In terms of cash atom ratio then yes it's too high. Just don't buy.
---
* **They couldn't release the raider collector bot at least?**
---
* **Feels great to see the best-Free-States-bundle-yet sold $6 cheaper** 
---
   * *with everything good in one bundle instead of two.*
---
   * *16$ cheaper if you count you had to buy two before to get these items.*
---
   * *@BGS - you really know how to burn your early adopters / most loyal*
---
* **Scrap kits should never be a "featured item"**
---
   * *They essentially useless for any post-100 player or de-facto useless for anyone with a full stash*
---
* **When there's nothing left to vault - will it finally be over?**
---
Semi-legendary combat rifle. Then you add legendary effects and it's like. 5 or 6 star weapon. Amazing bit of kit.
---
Maybe it's a possible rare reward for finishing the questline, there are other plans like that. Like you can find Tomahawk plans from doing Responder questlines
---
You can buy shells for a cap each from marketplaces and trash range is a part of balancing shotguns.
---
You're seeing those builds because melee is the best for pve and rifles are the easiest and most versatiles ranged weapons. That doesn't mean shotguns are bad at all.
---
I'd buy it. You wouldn't see *me* complaining...
---
I have speed demon, healing factor, marsupial, and bird bones. The only time it has been a pain was TRYING to die to get someone their badge. I jumped off a watch tower roof and survived. Bird bones, man. Can't die when I want to!
---
I have heard tales of people saying that they need to eat and drink a lot more with speed demon equipped, as it is supposed to make both stats decay 50% faster. However, I find that the toon with speed demon doesn't need to eat more or more often than my character who does not have any mutations at all. I can't explain it, but I won't complain!
---
Honestly, I pushed myself to like 76 and ended up loving it. And the reason I pushed myself is so I could be among those people who have been playing since the first year, because with games like ESO, I feel like you needed to be playing all that time. There's so much to do in that game it's unreal, I've tried to get back into it and it is really good, but my build on there is horrible unless I have random people helping me kill things and all. And it seems to be alot of invested time that I would want to spend in 76
---
No, modded servers haven't been released yet.
---
I'm standing in front of the queen, she's taking up the whole screen. All I see is her face and a while lot of da mage numbers popping up.
---
Hear a Yao Guai behind me? Keep shooting. Someone else will take care of it.
---
Hear a mirelurk king behind me. Fuck!  Fuck! Run! Cause I know it's already wiped out half the crew at the queen fight and still has full health.
---
Just shoot me your ps name and I'll add ya when I'm on tonight.
---
I'll trade ya for a Plasma Grenade Plan! ;)
---
Or next week when patch 14 most likely rolls out
---
Its not about them "being the best".  Its about them not being a good choice at all.  Why bother with all of that when you can have the versatility of rifles or the damage and sustainability of melee.  Shotguns should be a middle ground and they aren't.
---
Well god damn
---
Maybe i should rephrase hahah eveything has a price at my vender apart from 38's. Also if i left one unlocked its limit is five and usally gets taken asap where at my vender i have 100 for a small fee of 2 caps each
---
I dunno about you guys, but I'm so glad they brought back Free States for a second go-around. I missed being able to get the stuff the first time
---
I've had the same thing happen to me except it was a supermutant right on the edge of a nuked whitesprings. If you could figure out a way I'd show you the video. We were fighting and he abruptly dropped dead so I went to loot his body and I died immediately. When I returned for my loot bag I died again even though nothing was there to kill me. I didn't even take any damage before. It was just so quick to kill me. When the supermutants respawned they died if they got too close to my bag. I never did get my flora amd junk back. I just hung up my hat for the night.
---
I think their damage makes them amazing for people without legendaries to make melee as great as it is. They're easily the best choice close range ignoring melee.
---
nobody is saying you can't play your way at all. If you want to stroll and read terminals and other lore stuff that is cool but some of us want to shoot other players in the mouth and take stuff. These workshops are a small portion of the games content and avoidable. Your entitled to enjoy your PvE and some of us (who enjoy it) are entitled to our workshop PvP. I can see from what you have wrote you obviously don't enjoy this game and feel it lacks content but I promise you you will not find anything of substance in a workshop pal. Nobody on here is being unreasonable about it (only you are) PvP players can NOT ruin you gameplay experience if you don't let them but I think the idea that PvP exists in this game bothers you and I can say that will never change. Stick to single player games pal.
---
same as my Reddit username
---
Helll yeah!! Just need another 100 scrip to be at max for when it rolls out!!
---
Yep they are. 
---
Was finishing a SBQ event and as I was looting the queen - noticed my health began decreasing. 
---
Tried to run out of the zone asap but died and of course wasn't quick enough to load back and so some ass stole all my junk before I could get it back *(event was technically over so it of course became available for griefers)*
---
it’s like wrestling in the 90s, yeah, we know, let us have our fun :3
---
What a horrible way to live! That's more or less what I meant by it being a people issue. There is not much more Bethesda can realistically do to help people who don't want to PvP. They've already done a lot to ruin PvP for the people who wanted to do so. Just because \*I\* don't PvP doesn't mean that I can't see why people would do it.
---
But there's a line between being a raider (which, of course, they all claim to be) and being an ass who's just trying to kill everyone else's fun!
---
If today was April 1st, that would probably be the perfect setup . . .
---
"We what ?! NOOO ! Hey, wait a minute . . . " 🤔
---
Yeah, I'll raid, but within the intention of the game mechanics. Not by exploiting them.  It's like someone trying to enforce "street" rules in a professional basketball game.
---
Instead they rolled the best / cheapest free states bundle yet so if you held out - now's a good time to buy into that one.
---
If you bought in last time - well I'm sorry it hurts. 
---
I too, have learned the painful atom shop lesson therein.
---
Looks like someone must have been quitting the game
---
Ahd Victorium
---
Bumblebee is that you?
---
Ive done the event three times that ive won and never got the plan =( i used my key card last time cuz no one else activated it. so does that mean i have to buy the thing at the vender then craft another one? or hope some one else activates the terminal and i can still join in?
---
You wonder? Of course they will, that is the whole point! They don't want you playing on your own server using whatever mods you want, they want to rent you a server so you can buy there mods. Todd Howard said as much with his "no touch point" statement.
---
All food bonuses should work regardless of whether you have carnivore or herbivore. The only things that carnivore and herbivore effect are the food fill percentage of the item and the amount of hp regained from the item
---
With GreenThumb and SuperDuper a run from Slocum Joe's downriver thru Flatwoods and west back up river to Point Pleasant can give you enough Healing Salve to almost clean out a vendor, Plus the Mothman Omelettes help too!
---
Lmao.  Or the VW harlequin cars.
---
Not gonna lie, excited about the free states stuff
---
Lol
---
Easy day then. I'm usually on around 9:00 EDT
---
Found a way to fix it, I’m on ps4 so i deleted my local save data and it finished the quest. Hope that helps!
---
I want Hubologists
---
You'll still be able to join in but yep you're gonna have to buy and craft another one. I think the lowest they go at robot vendors is like 1850, then you need a Flourescent flux
---
THAT'S IT?
---
Holy shit, lol, did you forget the "/s"?
---
Paid 17k on xbox for mine found it in the looking for group posts
---
Meh. Still no Nuka Cola Fridge. At least I have enough Atoms saved up for it and more when it becomes available.  The 'modern art' thing is kind of meh too, but at least it's not just a frame or icon and something we can actually put in the CAMP.
---
Mischief Night

https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5hwIwII6sQo27czSWWlfjC/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-mischief-night-seasonal-event-preview
---
I main one currently.  The drum mag nerf hurt but I like it.
---
If i can join why would i need to buy another? Sorry for the stupid question lol And sweet is that flux found in nuke zones??
---
Tourists
---
But wouldn't you have 5 points in INT because of Gunsmith anyways? Then it's Nerd Rage for Bloodied builds, but how else would you spend the 5 int points if youre a gunner?
---
Whats in the bundle? And how much? I love free states haha
---
It's like Bethesda don't even want money any more, the Atom Shop updates these past few weeks has been awful.
---
Well there's a few ways around this. Some people create mule accounts. Which I think is a big waste of money. Honestly the best way to achieve extra storage space besides perk cards is to go out and place your camp on a somewhat pre existing structure that has in game storages. Don't advertise your space and if you have to, try to place items around or on top of it to avoid people getting into it. Just dump the extra things there then go head out. Just don't forget to go back to camp to take your stuff before you log out!!!
---
Caps are like water in this game. Aside from the 1400 daily you can get via vendors, whatever you sell our of your own vending, there's 10 cap stashes at Poseidon Energy Plant Yard, 11 in Morgan town, 4 at Kanawha Nuka-Cola plant that are easy low level locations. (A small few cap stashes can't be reached without Marsupial)
---
I have the same one and it’s pretty good, those specific perks and that aae was heavily duped a few months back so a lot of the AAE handmade out there use those three perks
---
Seriously. Don't fucking buy the fridge lol
---
If I've never attempted the Encryptid event before, and I have the opportunity to, what should I be aware of/know going into it?
---
Well now I won't, lol. That's so stupid. What a waste of atoms
---
Dont think so but I know theres at least 4 that I've been trying to do that I cant complete.
---
Common sense right there.
---
always figured it was related to the corprus disease, why the immortality and people mostly losing their mind
---
They come running at you and hit you with there commando pro perk xd
---
How the fuck did we kill 1.6 scorched in one day
---
One year later and we’re almost out of beta! Cheers gents 😏
---
Wow, who could have imagined that buying something the instant it comes out would cost more than buying it later on... you know... other than anyone who's ever bought anything before...
---
Because you just have to happen upon another player starting it. Yeah it is my guy. Don't worry about it, the only stupid questions are my own
---
Use rights costs are pretty steep. If you held the rights to "Rawhide" and Bethesda comes to you and says they want to use your song in a MMO, all you're gonna see is dollar signs. Flat fee? No. That's what Bethesda would want, but the rights holder would want per use, or per instance. 
---
That's $$$$.
---
They could improve the situation by making more "good" weapons available from quests.  The Unstoppable Monster was from a really easy quest and on a proper build does over 1300 damage.  Yes it was a limited time event, but at least things like that offer an opportunity to get a good weapon if you can't get lucky finding an explosive junkie/bloodied shotgun or whatever.
---
Nerd Rage 3, Gunsmith 2. That way my gun doesn’t break twice during the SBQ. I actually run a full 15 Intelligence on my Heavy guy though, but I’m also focused on energy weapons/power armor.
---
If I look at prizes lately, I do not think BE handmade is worth more than AAE. Anti-armor is certainly very popular nowadays. I don't think primed increases price. 
---
But don't take my word on that, just go check out the trading groups on social media. it really is a sellers market
---
Sounds like we have a chance at some unique costumes, that could be sick. Still wish they’d start this earlier and end Nov. 1.
---
Can you explain how this works? I run the perk myself and I agree it's very good, but doesn't it only reduce explosive damage by 45%? Why does it feel like it reduces it by 95%?
---
I guess it really depends on what that 3^rd part is. The 2-shot, +25% faster fire rate and 15% faster reload 50 caliber I've got is nice.
---
The only downside is the xp, and you can work that with points into int if you really cared
---
I'd still not run an energy build on class freak grounded either
---
Not really - I'm pretty sure Berserker counts perk card-based DR/ER against it.  Berserker pretty much requires you to be naked, but you can receive the benefits of Legendary armor as long as it's broken.
---
Always keep an eye on the Inaide the Vault articles, friendo
---
Ah I thought it was unaffected by perks still. Good to know...
---
I see you are running auto rifles. 
---
Bullet Sheild is pointless if you are not using heavies.  Get rid of it.
---
I seriously doubt they even have a way to tally any kills. There was always going to be a 50% off reward.
---
Would be fire if you could choose your own settings (voice, demeanor)
---
1. The thing to kill is essentially a very powerful assaultron, called the Imposter Sheepsquatch. It hits HARD, so don't get too close to it!
---
2. There are lots of robots that spawn, including exploding eyebots. Try to steer clear of them, and kill the eyebots before they get close to anyone.
---
3. BRING LOTS OF STIMPAKS!!! You may at one point need to become a conduit. There are three pylons that have to be activated, and when you activate them, you become a conduit, and will gradually lose health. So bring LOTS of stimpaks, and wear good power armor!
---
4. Do the event in a full team, and never do the event without a lot of people being there for it. The imposter can be hard to kill if there aren't a lot of people there, and if no one has any God tier weapons.
---
5. Don't let anything that I've said scare you, because the event is actually much easier when you actually do it! A lot of people are after the fixer plan right now, so if you see it start on your server, go do it! A lot of people will be there, and it'll end quickly. It can be stressful, but it can also be lots of fun :)
---
Anyone got screenshots of the two new Free States outfits? For whatever reason the Atom shop doesn’t have any pictures of what they’d look like in game and I’d kinda like to see what the full body/back looks like.
---
I melee things on the ground, but use ballistic weapons for things that fly.
---
Twisted muscles has a big negative effect on ballistic weapons, so I haven't taken it.
---
My purse is full of lobster. Why would I log in for sandwiches?
---
You people DO realize that they add in new stuff with the ACTUAL updates and not these little server downtimes... right?  It's been weeks since the last update, they've already gone through almost everything that's been datamined from the last update, no shit at this point they're going to start recycling old deals to fill space.  
---
Since none of the Halloween event stuff has actually been added to the game yet we're looking at an actual update next week at which point all of you can stop complaining about how there's nothing new to spend atoms on and go back to complaining about how everything is in bundles or too expensive.
---
I didn't get involved because the cost of killing one of these things is so great based on the weapons that I have that I would be spending all my time acquiring ammo components and spending caps going back and fourth to where ever it is that I need to be to kill a scorch puppy.. I have exhausted any motivation at my level to do anything but admire the junk that I have acquired, which takes about 15 minutes and then I leave the server until I get the bug to see if anything has actually changed. ;-) changed..
---
That's *crunches numbers* midnight my time (AEDT). No worries mate.

And at a certain point levels don't matter much.

Nice!!!!!

The sledgehammer? Yes, it’s one of my favorites

This is mine - Pretty happy with it

---
Yep i'm quite annoyed by this
---
Great. Cause I’ve been hoarding scripts. Going camp to camp buying low cost legendaries. Found a camp where they all were 150 caps or less. Bought them all. So now I’m at maxed scripts and back pack full of 1 &amp; 2 star legendaries waiting till the 17th. All the 3 stars I have in my vendors might be going soon too once they introduce 5 stars.
---
Has anyone ever actually bought scrap kits?
---
Poison I think... something PA doesnt block. My 50 and 75 poison resist toons have no issues. In PA though, drad.
---
If it isn't a great time for ya, just lemme know what would be, and I can always do it over a weekend or something.
---
Incorrect, there's actually a number of named NPCs from terminals etc that never actually had their death resolved. Granted it might just have not been written in, but there's a lot of potential for characters like Abbie, Knight Moreno and Scribe Grant to return.
---
Additionally the bulk of the Trappers decided to collectively leave the state, but that's more to deepen the lore/explain the reuse of the armour by hinting they were the origin of the Far Harbour Trappers.
---
15k ouch. I need to go straight to my vending machine and up the price as soon as I next log in :)
---
What? XD
---
I mentioned starched genes b/c without it, pop a radx and you might lose the mutation if you take a radaway...
---
That said, in a nuke zone, when I took full strength radx/radaway, mutations effects were  supressed.  I missed marsupial and healing factor the most.
---
Based on a comment I read on one of the FO forums here, next time, I took the diluted versions - no suppression of the effect.  
---
Have used diluted ever since.  All the effect still function.
---
I agree and do this too on the PC side, but I'm also full up on caps...I'm hunting weightless.50 cals for trade on Fixer plan rn
---
they have 2 more weeks for "Halloween" themed apparel
---
I like how ppl didn’t buy the free states bundles because they were so expensive but now they offer stuff sold separately
---
What time do you usually run the events. I am always looking to join a server that actually has people trying to beat it.
---
I had a bit of a struggle where I just kept getting Scorched Fog Crawlers show up and there was a lot of hackin and slashin
---
Good for PvE. 
---
Great for PvP.
---
If there's several sentry's in the area, they all must be destroyed.
---
My general opinion is to take what you need.
---
Do you need water now? Sure, take 10. Do you need 40? Probably not.
---
the scrap kits are the worst fucking thing. they take up .1 weight (so 4 weight). They scrap everything that is scarp able at a bench and then sends it to your stash. you don't know what was sent to your stash, but it sends it there and most likely fills up your stash limit. then you have to spend the time to clean out your stash of all the excess junk. and then you still have 39 of them if you bought that pack
---
Tbh, while there are some yet to be used items they *could* be selling, it's very likely we'll get patch 14 next week, with all the Halloween stuff then. The event is basically finished in the files, so they've likely had time to make a bunch of assets.
---
the game was broken on xbox 360 and ps3 back i 2010 and still has problems till dis day. just look at old forums of people complaining the game is too buggy and broken
---
I’ll buy ur Fixer Plan then for my alt n have high trades
---
There was an update?
---
Halloween is a year-round event for some of us. ;) I'm always game for Halloween content. But yeah, it was disappointing to not see it this week.
---
Yeah the tse got nerfed hard. 62.5% damage on each shot means enemies with high defence can negate a lot more of the damage.
---
Im happy with my light right where its at.  In my eyes on my helmet, so wherever I look, there the light is.
---
Sorry trade only no room for caps
---
I got plenty high end trades mate.
---
Did I say or imply I was angry? Pretty sure I was originally thanking people for giving me something fun to do. 
---
Lack of empathy, you may have me there. 
---
Lack of understanding, no I think I understand it perfectly well. 
---
You've mistaken my keyboard warrior ramblings as an attempt to rationalize when in fact I am actually merely arguing on the internet just as I have for the last 20 years; simply because it is fun.
---
I just love that the kids parents are like 387 yards south of him for the whole 200 years but never check that fridge.
---
I dont pay for atoms and i have a bunch of stuff including said robot and still have 1000 atoms. I have one repair kit that i got from an event
---
Sounds to me the real problem is pacifist mode.   
---
Real griefers don't pvp, they hide behind pacifist mode like a kid hiding behind his mommies dress.  If you could pvp these guys you could at least get your shit back.
---
Yet you stay on fallout reddits lol.
---
PvP is fun for _you_. For me, it's something I have zero interest in, and when shitty assholes decide they are going to do their level best to enforce their "fun" over mine? That asshole's just that. An asshole. A griefer.
---
In any other situation you'd end up on a fucking watch list.
---
Crap. I was hoping it would lol. Thank you
---
I just cant justify 500+ atoms on something unless it's just absolutely out of this world cool Halloween decor wise. Personally I dont see myself leaving it up past the holiday. But I do change my camp 1-2 times a week since I'm kinda at a standstill for content wise. My character is geared so I pretty much just do someone daily's an a few events then rebuild my CAMP. I guess well see what exactly they release if anything.
---
Yeah I'll listen to the game radio, but I thought you meant you were listening to like "current" music lol
---
Yeah first one i dropped class freak on was 220, she's mostly set except for gear tweaks.
---
The pip boy light works as a fixed camera as well. Wouldn't that suck if it wasn't lol
---
Sorry about the lighting - but this is one of them:  https://imgur.com/a/Kg4T3G9
---
personally i'd like some order of mysteries stuff
---
It is funny how so many of them talk so much crap, but still care enough to post on here.
---
They're just going to make them all easy to get. Thanks to Reddit whining that the drop rates sucked, they've come to the conclusion that this community hates low drop rates.
---
Zealots is only one mate
---
When I had this problem it turned out to be a connection problem on my end. Just a thought.
---
Yeah I could guess haha. Sorry, I wasn't trying to be insensitive. It's just that the original person that Blizzard stole prize money from was male, so that's what I was referencing. Tbh wasn't thinking of your OP at all, I apologize for bothering you though
---
In the past 7 days, from vendors  I have found
---
max level 3 Star Bloodied Explosive Shredding Minigun. 3000 caps.
---
And from another vendor:
---
Max level 2 star Anti Armor Explosive minigun. 900 caps, and a max level 3 star Furious faster fire rate plasma rifle, 250 caps.
---
Crazy!
---
And all my pocketed gear. Putting on my PA nets me less carry weight than having it off.
---
IMHO Halloween decorations and costumes should be more plentiful in the fallout universe anyways, give that the bombs fell right before Halloween.
---
Oh man, I do kinda hope there's some faction from Ohio so I can ruthlessly murder their pretentious-definite-article-using-chestnut-heads. O-H-fuck-U.
---
Good thing this *is* a video game and not any other situation. That's the thing about a game. It's not real life. Don't be one of those people who say video game violence has anything to do with real life violence.
---
Holy shit, we did it? I was up till midnight grinding my alt for kills. Probably got 400 just yesterday.
---
Thats what we said last week.
---
It very much does work on bulk items.
---
Same, I don't turn around for anything on SBQ. Except when I hear a Lurk King, I'll spin around so fast, I give my character whiplash.
---
It’s not worth it at full,price unless you want specific 3* effects. Now with the sale, cashing in a 3* at 40 and rolling again for only 50 is worth it if you want 3* weapons.
---
Sounds like a whole load of hoopla
---
I'm just holding out for the pink backpack that was datamined back in wild Appalachia lol. One week they'll add it!!
---
To everyone out there grinding hundreds of kills on alts like myself. Good work.
---
Bruh I have been playing since beta I'm pretty sure it doesn't activate on bulking scrap
---
While I was disappointed we didn’t get any seasonal gear last week I honestly sort of get rereleasing the riders skins.  They are essentially costumes for PA and were only available for a fairly small window of time previously.  
---
Rolling the Free States gear out again this soon?  That’s a head scratcher for me.
---
With Outer Worlds dropping on the 25th I would be doing everything in my power to increase player engagement and try to sell as many Atoms as I could right now.  /shrug
---
Discover 5 locales in Cranberry Bog is broken.
---
Yeah 
---
And we are still waiting for a patch that is going to hit right before the end of the month 
---
2 weeks from today I would imagine
---
I hope they have a new set of masks and the old ones become legacy
---
YES PLEASE. I roll around with my PA helmet off unless things get hairy. Makes me look less like another faceless nameless robot man and more like a guy in a mech suit.
---
  
---
Hate that I cant have a light at the same time. Youd think I'd figure out how to attach a flashlight to it if my character just happens to be the claustrophobic anti helmet type.
---
No halloween stuff?
---
i'll take the bait
---
What type of dwellers was it? from which vault?
---
where exactly on the map did you encounter this?
---
what platform are you on?
---
As have I, and have frequently heard the noise and seen the icon activate when I Bulk Lead.
---
I usually have 30-40. Between white knight, weapon artisan and kits life is ez.
---
[in game] looks around, shrugs, starts digging hole behind camp. I'm gonna go check that out...
---
One thing I've found helpful is to also get the Carnivore mutation to keep up with the appetite. 
---
It's never too hard to find an animal to kill and you'll be able to eat the meat raw without chance for disease.
---
Everyone try this: find a car that has not exploded and stand in one spot. FIrst with demo expert off shoot your favorite explosive gun near the car, not directly at it.  Remember the damage numbers and put the card on. Shoot the same spot see if there's a difference. There wasn't for me.
---
Idk the consensus on here says otherwise. And I know for a fact that hunters affected SBs and SBQs early in the game I just figured they fixed it. You would think that it would be zealots but everyone seems to think hunters is the one still. Which makes sense KIND OF because it is in fact  a mammal but if a Sb isn’t  scorched, then why the hell is scorch in its name!? I feel like that’s an error but it’s been like that for a while now.
---
Same here. Somewhere near 400.
---
Uh actually the bombs dropped in Fallout at the same time as the holidays. So really, Halloween is ALWAYS in season for Fallout. Same with Christmas. Nobody remembers Thanksgiving :(
---
She gives you legendary toys out of her giant sack, pinches your cheek and sends you off with a big bowl of mole rat borscht.
---
It does, it also prevents you from getting rads when consuming the goo, for some reason I've yet to discover.
---
It was :)
---
Worthless for pve. Good for pvp.
---
Oh your the guy from the unspeakable sub! Well I’ll hold onto it and link up with you in the evening if that works for you. I could use that handmade to prime it
---
Yea, I turn music on and off. Love it both ways. They always nail ambiance.
---
Probably not until Patch 14 at the earliest, which should be next week
---
Just because the game as of now is stuck on this time doesnt mean I personally wana live it every day. As I said having them up in my opinion past the IRL holiday just seems whatever.
---
It just comes as is, there aren't any heavy/light/sturdy variants of scout armor
---
good deal
---
So do you avoid the places that have Halloween decorations? Which is a lot of places. Like Watoga HS
---
Title error lol they couldn’t get that right either and instead of calling it Zealots why not Scorched.
---
Exactly!
---
I had the same mirelurk king kill me three times the other day. Like he saw me from across the battle and charged. Killed me before my minigun could spin up.
---
But its stats are still pretty good right ?? I got a 3 star bolstering sentieniel one
---
GT is Paintballstudd we can talk about everything later and meet up mate I’ll be on all day.
---
Yeah scout is awesome, and that piece you got is fucking amazing. Grab the polymer mod from the Enclave bunker for that extra DR
---
Same here i want to try and do the event unfortunately none of my friend got fallout 76 so this hard lol.
---
It's like you KNEW what was going to happen.... Sooooo spooooky.
---
They only did this as filler since items are released in waves with the patch, and patch 14 isn't arriving until at least next week if not the week after.
---
Happy Two Days of Halloween I guess.... Because who would want to decorate before the holiday, am I right?
---
*kicks rocks and wanders aimlessly in a skull mask*
---
No it doesn't.
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
I have a lot of fun how it is right now.. speak for yourself
---
I play all Bethesda games with no music.  Way more immersive - also if you are playing a sneaky character you need to be able to hear what is going on around you.
---
Im in class rn, what's in the shop this week?
---
Millennial
---
Good for you
---
I’m not sure how to link a post, but it’s on the fo76 reddit
---
I tried. It doesn't feel right to me.
---
Although i think after reading so many opinions here that I have been missing out.  Time to reload fo4 and try no radio there....
---
If you are on PC I made a mod that replaces the Classic Station songs with 71 new songs, some of them from older fallouts, I'm trying to keep it fresh, and going to be releasing the season 2 before October ends, probably when patch 14 lands.
---
It's called storm radio on nexus mods.
---
Yes. It's an adorable fluffy snoring angel. Until of course you wake it up. Then it's the towering monstrosity, that haunts the dreams of my gunslinger. Luckily there was a truck nearby.
---
I said this last week but: neat, another week to stockpile atoms. Maybe even mext week, if they're really saving their Halloween items until Mischief Week on the 29th.
---
I'll probably grab the Responder Pump-Action skin, and maybe the Neon Stars.
---
You do understand what a post-apocalyptic survival game is, no?
---
Constantly
---
Obviously not,  just don't feel like having decorations for said holiday past the IRL holiday in my CAMP. Wich is the point of the post..
---
YESSSSSSSS...bring on the Legendary SHOVELS!!!
---
Can't seem to find the post
---
Mhm
---
All music, including the ost.   Go environment only.
---
Would you be interested in making your camp using a cave? There are several really cool ones on the map that would look awesome as a bunker!
---
*Downvotes incoming*
---
Man its not that easy. Be thankful we even got licensed music in this game, it would have been cheaper and easier for them to not include it.
---
I’ll have to give that a try. It’ll be interesting eavesdropping on the raiders next month.
---
Yeah, but there'll still be the mysterious whitesprings Halloween event on the 29th for as yet unknown items (aside from pumpkins). Still surprising how a game that's perpetually set in fall has little to no usable Halloween decorations
---
What free posts though?
---
Why not?  If you think it's ok to force real people to be your victims in a video game, the only thing stopping  you from doing that in real life is the fear of being arrested.  
---
Ya'll worry me on a deep level, for everyone around you who might be the one you abuse when you think you can get away with it.
---
Do you use a laser rifle? They break easily all the time. I got 200 improved repair kit, only use that to repair my stuff and never ran out of them
---
Would love to use your mod. But i play on xbox. Is that mod out for Fallout 4 (xbox)?
---
You have this problem all of the time? Sometimes this happens to me too but rarely. Dropping stuff and picking it back up sometimes helps.
---
Haven’t played for 9 months, please tell me everything that I missed because I don’t understand google
---
That's the kind of enthusiasm we'll need if we're ever gonna see them eradicated for good
---
I agree, this game should automatically have Halloween decorations in workshop. I think that’s a bit late for a Halloween event, I feel like it should start a bit earlier and end Halloween night at mid night.
---
There is a note posted on the church in Grafton telling non-feral ghouls to go to DC - and we know there were some non-feral sanctuary in the mire that got wiped out.
---
This is what I do and it works just fine
---
My only complaint is constant card swapping. That is all.
---
I'd say I'm cautious as well, but I have hope that they've learned thier lesson with this game. They've done nothing but improve so far. Heres hoping lol.
---
Yeah, the fridge ghoul always annoyed me. Ghouls have to eat, they experience trauma, need air and all that jazz. Main difference is they look like a scabby prune, live for a long time, radiation doesn't bother them too much, and the odd ghoul has a mutfruit tree growing outta his head.
---
So much improvement, even more than listed here it's ridiculous
---
Just the regular maintenance and sale changes in the shop, no patch to download this week
---
If it let you choose what to scrap, like a virtual workbench, and then gave the option to send stuff to stash, they would be awesome. Drop a scrapping bench would built in stash. Boom.
---
My stash is typically at or near the limit due to excess steel until I craft ammo. If only the weight reduction perks also worked on stash.
---
This was an obvious joke btw too lol.
---
I won't tell you not to, because it does have its good points, but I will say I am considering removing it, but I need to get serums for some of the others I want to retain.
---
In lower level areas, it will insakill an enemy.     
---
It does not show damage numbers, so I cant say how much damage it does.
---
In high level areas, electrical charge does damage, but generally will not instakill.   
---
When I picked up the mutation, I was in L45 Excavator. 
---
I noticed 3 things:
---
1. it does not always fire when I am attacked. 
---
2. Once you cross over about 5 enemies, the chargeback seems to increase a lot.  (IDK if it is quantity, or if the charge increases with level of enemy it hits.)  The WS laundry area is not a problem, but the golf club (and sometimes the preidential cottage) can be.
---
3. in WS swarms, need to have high health (healing factor helps here) before taking on the swarm/mob.   If electrical charge it fires late in the fight when I am already low health, the damage I take can kill me.   (Thats why I also got grounded - it reduces electrical damage.)  
---
I've since upgraded to X01, but havent done a nuke run/high level mob since I put it on. So IDK how much better it will protect against the charge.
---
Oh man for sure it was a train wreck. 
---
I was surprised how well it works on XB1 but figured it was worth a shot.
---
It's sad that Steam will sell you FO3 or NV and you have to hammer on it to get it to work. Sure, BGS should ensure the title is playable but I had to mod an INI file to get Stalker to run on my son's W10 box.
---
IIRC GOG versions tend to work better.
---
I use one daily.. outside of the very top tier bullet sponge's it is a very good gun with the right build.
---
If only there was another rpg shooter that just came out that is all action and no survival elements... or another rpg shooter with less survival elements about to come out shortly...  if only...
---
Sometimes I have to run out of the immediate area I was in to fast travel.
---
Its been really annoying. 
---
But I found that running around from place to place instead of fast traveling tends to get me an extra roaming legendary or 2, so walking has returned to usefulness.
---
Same, seems sad I can't decorate for Halloween :/
---
Sure wish I could finish Lying Lowe, still doesn't work
---
I'll be on 6pm EST lookimg fpr these other guys so shoot me an invite. I got a copy of the fixer plans, imposter clothes, and the full mascot suit last night plus several legendaries. Hopefully we can get a good enough server to do it.
---
I want Monster Mash.
---
lol you're getting dunked on in your own topic
---
I've seen encounters that double spawned maybe once or twice, but not that many. In my case it was when the random 4 mannequin spawned in the same spot as the dead cultists one--made it look like the mannequins were carrying them in their arms
---
The optimist in me thinks that they’re trying to delegate most of their resources towards the Wastelanders content to get it done soon. If I had a choice, I’d definitely prefer that.
---
Fair point. And i freaked out when i heard "right behind you baby" in Fallout 4. Still would love to hear some more.
---
So, you hate the game because it does exactly what they said they wanted to do?
---
This is like buying a cheeseburger and then getting pissed cuz it came with cheese. You knew what you were getting.
---
They'd have to get the rights to it but considering we got Ring of Fire and Country Roads, Jeepers Creepers shouldn't be too hard.
---
Is there anywhere I can go to learn all these acronyms? I’m so out of the loop
---
maybe im just lucky.. this never happens to me on PC
---
Been using this one and more where that came from that changes the Appalachia radio and I love em both!
---
Alright, Nancy Grace.
---
Well, if you use it without speed demon, you drink/eat half often. If you use speed demon you just eat/drink at normal rate, and not 50% more often.
---
I'd be ecstatic to find out that the lockpicking cards would just magically become 1-effing card, or simply disappear and update my character with that ability without having to swap the damn things out. At least, some kind of layouts that could be easily swapped out, i.e. a crafting set, battle set, food set...whatever. On the face of it, all of the perk cards are great, but when you play the game and have to keep swapping them out every few minutes it's a bit of a clunky mechanic just isn't fun.
---
Wheres da trave at tonight, I have my glowsticks.
---
All we need is meat cook radio with Graham and chally
---
&gt;Weight reduction effects on armor stack up to (20%/40%/60%/80%/90%) for each type, instead of a complete 100% reduction. When used with any weight reduction perk, the cap remains at 90% reduced weight. The reduction effects are additive but do not exceed 90% reduction. For example, combining the 75% reduced junk weight perk with 20% reduced junk weight armor does not cause an item weighing 10 pounds to weigh .5 pounds (10 \* 0.05) or 2 pounds (10 \* 0.25) \* 0.8) but rather 1 pound (10 \* 0.1).
---
If you go on Spotify and search "Fallout music" there are multiple playlist with fallout era songs, one has like 500ish songs. It's not what you asked for in game but it's better than we are ever going to get.
---
There's a place near Whitesprings/Seneca Rock Falls where they didn't clip the terrain. It's a natural occurring underground base spot, no cooking station exploits needed. Pretty cool, blew my mind when the guy was like "Aw Nohr, don't worry about getting out of your power armor just drop down this hole"
---
A cave? Ah yes, I've been looking for spaceable caves. Anything could do, actually.
---
As long as it's not an open-ass place. This game has a few caves that can be built in, and even fewer of them have water inside, good space and are buildable-in.
---
Ruins the point of a bunker to build it topside, so a cave or an underground glitch place could work. I have my camp set so you spawn inside a cave if you're lucky, and then get into the bunker. It's really ugly, and in the middle there's a 2x2 space where there's dirt, but could be water.
---
I wish there were more caves you could build in. I can only really think of 2, and one is rather small.
---
Only benefits 2% of enemies in the game. The rest will see no effect from AA because armor isn’t high enough to make any difference.
---
This is my plan.  Running dailies and saving up atoms.
---
yeah, people who worked on new vegas has said that they spent too much time adding content instead of fixing bugs and glitches and the way the game turned out was there fault. so it sucks but it happens. and also i don't think bgs can fix that game anymore since new vegas uses an outdated version of the engine and the creation engine was created when skyrim released
---
I have both an aaerw and a aaffrrw. The aae seems more accurate and harder hitting but the firerate has higher DPS. You made a great deal!
---
I could see something like that being a thing, a sort in game rep system among players.  Could a spectrum with raiders on end, freestaters in the middle, and responders on the other end.  Doubt we will ever it though in FO76.  Might see some faction rep at some point which could serve, maybe.
---
Also, grape gum and other variations have lower effects. Like 5% slower thirst/hunger but 10% more other thing (disease resistance, rad resistance, etc).
---
Videos or guides on it? Can you go inside there without building the camp first?
---
It'll probably become a legacy spot once it becomes known enough, but can I have more details on the location, as that's pretty vague?
---
You kinda can.  Theres the mothman skulls on a stick, pumpkin scarecrows, etc.
---
Who this "we" white man?
---
I like building a neat and fun CAMP!  Its one of my end game activities that includes being a merchant
---
No one is forcing you to do those things, other than eat and drink to survive, you can be a cannibal so you dont ever have to cook anything!
---
I do think they are going to bring card loadouts to help with all the card switching, so that is good!
---
I was going to get up a spreadsheet where you picked your effects and it would kick out an estimate cap value... After I built the shell I got lazy and put it aside.
---
Without a large sample size of 1, 2 and 3 star sales prices it is kinda tough to come with the value (if I just stick numbers in there it is just my opinion). I was thinking of just doing that and seeing what people though and tweaking the values from there.  
---
This post has rekindled my interest in this project... off to post in Market76!
---
That’s gold 😂
---
Yeah its gonna be too late to use the decorations if they dont release them early int he month!
---
As a Bloodied build, you can run melee without perks. Speccing into Heavy means you can swap for melee perks, further increasing melee damage.
---
As I've seen, Bloodied Heavy weapons are fantastic. There's few weapons that stand out in Rifles (BE Lever, BE Laser, BE Powder) or Heavy(BE LMG, BE GatlingGun, BE GatlingLaser, BE Harpoon), and barely any in pistols(BE Western, BE Powder).
---
Nope sorry, I got no info on where it was
---
Who is this "we"? I highly enjoy this game.
---
Much appreciated. Hopefully I can give this one a shot soon.
---
You can have it, I want the Mr fuzzy one
---
Send a psn messaage to them. Gamertag and psn name are the same. Also very helpful when helping buds, can screenshot pic of weap drops etc and send to them.
---
I looked for scorched but the majority of the spawns were ghouls or super mutants.
---
Now I'm struggling with trying to keep the interior dark. Might need to find a cave somewhere to build this maze, too bright inside to be scary. Maybe I'll only open it at night
---
If you crouch and it says "Caution" you have to wait for the timer to hit zero before you can fast travel, if you try and defend yourself it usually cancels the fast travel.
---
op is certainly not lying.
---
God doesn’t need a damn he can walk on water 👍
---
What you talking about...... All the bugs and spiders are in the code!
---
Where do they all keeping coming from!!!!  REEEEEEEE
---
Disagree. Sorry!
---
I have not tried wearing PA without a helmet, but have you tried wearing a PA set with a hard hat that has the bright light mod on it? That headwear alone works wonders for illumination. You can even change make different hard hats that have the purple, red, and blue lights as well.
---
Start a new character so you can switch up your game play when you get bored. It’s a lot of fun and keeps it fresh to go from melee,PVE/commando,pvp/black powder,roleplay 😬
---
The only time I have trouble fast traveling is when enemies are nearby. The countdown doesn't always start. Sometimes you have to move further away from mobs.
---
We're in a holding pattern, and have been for a good long while content wise, although since the community challenges hit, it's been more "project: clean out the atom shop" than anything
---
Literally nobody wants this
---
I’d love to see the boogeyman song from bio shock
---
Was hoping to unlock some info on Wastlanders aswell!
---
Have a down vote.
---
Yeah, I actually have a yellow mr fuzzy mining helmet I keep on me.
---
The mining helmet can kinda ruin the whole vibe I'm trying to accomplish with the lack of PA helmet in the first place, haha. So i don't see it as a real solution, more just a bonus side option to the PA helmet. 
---
I honestly wear it quite a bit though. I like the heavier directional beam.
---
My Wife's not able to play nearly as often as I am, we have a pair of toons rolled especially for RP/going through the everything equal, but when we also both have a mostly solo main... that we still end up teaming sometimes.  I take a crazy amount of joy hopping around in plain sight in my PA, taking low damage swipes to keep the attention of whatever mobs while she kills them when she needs just a little bit of security backup to not bite it doing something for a quest.
---
I was slaying scorched right up till midnight! 
---
Glad to see the effort was worth it!
---
Clearly you haven't found any of the "The Lusty Assaultron maid" holonovels yet ;^)
---
I agree it kills the vibe, but replacing that dull, standard green pip boy light color is amazing.
---
My main weapons are the B 10% aim Lever and a BFFR Gat Plas, or TSE Gat Plas.
---
I wanted to stay way from explosive with the bloodied rifleman build.
---
I also dont use melee.  I swap my str perks out for heavy weapons perks, not melee perks.
---
In a post apocalyptic world where we have energy weapons and guns, I want to use guns, not a hammer.
---
This
---
The only con of this mutation is that sometimes you'll damage things some might prefer undamaged, and you'll have little control over it.
---
Dang, I sold mine for 12.5k. should have asked for more. LOL
---
I want one character, not a slew of others. 
---
With no shared bank to swap gear between toons, I dont feel like starting over again and have to acquire all new gear all over again. 
---
Some of us dont have the luxury of trusted friends to hold your gear for you.  Most of my fallout pals dont play anymore.  So no alts for me.
---
I also noticed you said you are bloodied but don’t have radicool in endurance. 1perk card for +5 strength is huge. I also don’t see any armor piercing cards such as tank killer, there’s another in intelligence for heavy weapons but I can’t remember the name.
---
I agree Monster mash with a bunch of  people is extremely fun.

I’m actually not against things getting cheaper when re-released if done fairly with at least a nominal amount of time in between so it doesn’t feel so “back to back”.
---
**However** in this situation they took their highest priced bundle yet and stripped it down to the most attractive bits then sold it for way less the original just over a month and a bit later.
---
So I think it’s fair to be more than a little annoyed. Especially given the fact that we are talking about a $16 differential and not 200 atoms / $2
---
At issue here isn’t the bundle strategy itself - or things getting cheaper - it’s the actions or at least optics that you get screwed over for being a dedicated player and participating in the atom shop.
---
FWIW mothman got rerolled and I was fine with that - but they also split it cleanly from the start and didn’t charge 28$ for access to all of it so felt different.
---
Appalachia appreciates your service regardless.
---
I decided to try hunter hunted for the first time last night, but no one showed. How does it work if you don't mind explaining?
---
How much alot?
---
I do ALOT of SBQ runs and that makes repair lots run out so fast and I'm just repairing guns.
---
Trashed what, 0 star fixers you get from the wolf questline? He is talking about fixer plan you might get from encryptid event. The said plan is needed to have a chance to get legendary fixers from Purveyor, and they don't drop as loot.
---
Some legendaries are going to sell for much more on the Market where you have a bigger audience.  Your vendor is exposed to 20 other players, many of whom won't even look.  A bloodied 10mm pistol at 1K caps may sit in your vendor for weeks, or you can sell it on the Market for 3-5K in an hour.  Some items have a small but determined fan base.  To get the most you will need to go find your customer.
---
i expect to see a LARGE number of legendary weapons and armor in camp vendors soon, just takes too long to rescrip them. so, save your caps and go on a shopping spree without all the crying about lousy drops ;)
---
personally, i like testing weapons / builds
---
Raiders up vote
---
I.... what? What are you responding to?
---
because im not melee. 
---
Look again, there is a Tank Killer 2 in Per
---
The Int perk you speak of is stabalized, which is in my secondary perks on the build.
---
Did you even look at the post?
---
Agreed! When I get a crappy legendary, it just turns into scrip. No reason to get all worked up about it, just scrip it and try again!
---
Meh
---
Level?
---
Done this 3 times in the last few months and it has been screwed up differently each time. 
---
If you have already taken a number for either B or C, drop the numbers from your inventory. I think they are in the Misc tab. Head straight for the "helpful error guide" terminal on the back wall and create an application with your fake name/address. Take a new number, boot up the department. 
---
If that doesn't work, smash your keyboard, try it all again several times and maybe shoot the robots a bit. Seems like eventually it just works.
---
yeah, I didn't know how rare they were and sold my fixer plans for 111 caps  =[
---
Monster Mash is the best event for legendary farming. I average three multi-star legendary ghoul spawns per run. Sometimes none show up. Sometimes six show up. But usually, you get one multi-star spawn per round for three rounds.
---
It is like Uranium Fever except the items will be maximum level instead of only level 40.
---
Shotguns align extremely nicely with a playstyle that recently became viable, the majority of the playerbase haven't connected the dots yet, and there's substantial grind involved to complete this build, but by nowadays math shotguns can be very meta.
---
Yup..  that's what I said.
---
I use heavy engery gun.
---
I think gunsmith isnt working for energy guns like it does for other guns
---
The build you linked isn't a bloodied build, just a standard stealth commando. Made most evident by the lack of Serendipity.
---
I looked, I’m in class I missed it. I suggest radicool for the carry weight not the dmg. 1strength = 5pounds of Carry weight.
---
It just amazes me how people are behind there fucking keyboards bitch and moan about everything if you did it they fudge the numbers if we didn’t do it then there would be people bitching and crying why did u give us this task u know we couldn’t complete ... just chill the fuck out and STOP complaining about EVERYTHING!!! This is how you the world really is though ...a bunch of wining BRATS !!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Bastards!!
---
That’s a good point! My mind didn’t think of that.
---
With full unyeilding and a carry weight backpack, my carry weight is just fine.
---
Dude. Hahahaha. 
---
I play with my girlfriend. There is one and only one thing she yells run for. That’s the stupid Kings.

We hear their roar on Queen I jump in the air, spam stimpak, throw a plasma grenade randomly like a flash bang, and run to a group of heavy gunners. 
---
It’s pathetic how a full powersrmor, nerd rage, emergency protocol spec is so squishy.

I want Responders CAMP stuff so badly.  When it isn't themed, my CAMP is basically an aid station, always plenty of food/drink/meds/chems free or low cost, at least one instrument placed always, only time the beds aren't publicly available is when I'm rebuffing my rested while afk for a moment.
---
So it literally slingshotted me into the few last steps of the quest? I’m not complaining it’s just odd. I stood there waiting for the terminal to respond while watching YouTube, looked up, and it told me to get the governor’s seal.
---
You know as much as I do. My only explanation is that it provides a 45% reduction on the initial damage, and other perks/armor then make up the defense on the last 55%.
---
It’s usually best not to question a crucial perk that works really well. Only bad things can come from that.
---
I'm sure I killed a few thousand. I went out of my way to go to places where scorched are just to help out the past week every single day. Even did scorched earth and traveled to fissure sites a good part of each day. Good job everyone!
---
Stimpacks are low. I have no problem selling them at 22 caps.
---
There isn't a more efficient way to farm the 1400 caps limit than to save 17k, buy serum recipe for some cheap to craft serum (whats cheap depends what you dont burn through with your character), masscraft this serum and then sell 4 each for 350 daily (can be more, I aim for 350 for easy life).
---
Yeah this needs some time of preparation but if you do it right you can first spend some hours then have the daily caps income solved for weeks.
---
This event is an absolute blast. My only complaint is that I only seem to run into non pvp people looking to farm legendaries and god do they get pissed and start yelling when you kill them.
---
Funny thing is when I see a legendary in there I stop everything I'm doing and call it out so everybody can tag it. 
---
Best advice going into it is empty your junk, do the event an kill every ghoul but don't loot anything. When the event is over go around and loot all the meat piles. You will walk out with a metric ton of junk.
---
Responder gear and Halloween related outfits seem to sell well for high level players, as well as acid steel copper and lead for ammo making. Fusion cores don't sell incredibly well, but if they're full 25 caps will sell decently enough.
---
Uh ok. Why post asking for suggestions if your going to act so offended. Looking for praise? Jesus 🤣.
---
Calm down there, I was only adding options to your build, no need to flip out. Melee was optional. 
---
I use Explosive over other damage like aimed or fire rate because it actually hits a lot harder. The explosive adds over 100 damage per hit, so realistically FFR does not matter when killing in PvE except on hard targets like the Queen. Furthermore the FFR is best for PvP since damage is capped, ruling out Bloodied pretty hard. 
---
I'm a Bloodied build, you're a Bloodied build. I'm just adding my experience and thoughts to your post about Rifle and Heavy, which my build is and has been since last year. No need for hostility against a helping hand. 
---
Side note: Melee has been used effectively before, during, and after the introduction of ranged weapons. Melee would also be highly effective in Apocalyptic times, especially with scarce or crude ranged weapons.
---
I notice this a lot in starting areas for Free Range. If the timer expires the cows can be killed and the bodies stay quite a long while.
---
Every time I run that event, I get white wolf fedoras (XBox)
---
For me, the Fallout series has always been a solitary experience. I like exploring and surviving on my own, which is why the Fallout 76 announcement seemed at odds with me. The idea of joining with other wastelanders isn't particularly appealing to me. I'm low level right now, but I'm hoping that the larger creatures aren't completely off limits when I get leveled up and still want to play solo.
---
That’s a very valuable/good weapon.  I’d prefer reload over 90%, but it’s still great.
---
Yes it seems pretty new I just had it happen a ton last night for the first time.
---
Seems pretty fair to me I sell plans at 10 caps and recipes at 1 cap (unless they are sought after. Ammo at 1 cap per item. Stims at 15. Diluted stims at 10. Rad-x and  radaway at 15. Diluted at 10. Berry and grape mentats at 15. They all sell fairly regularly. Oh and bobbleheads and magazines at 50 caps but think that price will drop soon as most people have collected them all now.
---
I see several carry weight perks that could be replaced by one card called Radicool 🤣🤣 scaly skin mutation is always good too 😬
---
Which event gives you the plans?
---
That's Nukashine for ya.
---
who got offended, I was explaining why I didnt use radicool so you would be more educated on why I decided not to.  
---
I was not being offended, just offering more insight into the build. If you are offended by friendly debate, maybe I should just keep my questions to myself.
---
If you need it. Take it. I leave all of mine unlocked but 2, and those 2 are around the corner. If you pick a lock it’s stealing. 
---
Ideally I’d like people to take water if they’re low, not just stockpile their resources. Can’t really govern that now so I just keep them unlocked.
---
Yeah I don't know what to say other than that happened to me. Sounds like you're sorted out now. On the plus side everything after that point seems to still be working correctly except for the occasional map markers that fail to update.
---
Well done everybody, sorry I had to leave you to it for the last day, but a holiday in Marrakesh with the wife trumps even 50% from Mmurgh.
---
Just a filthy casual I guess.  :)
---
why is it people always think friendly debate is flipping out. 
---
nevermind, deleting the post.
---
I got that 3 days ago.  Just keep tanking those pylons...
---
The carry weight perks are only there to fill in when im not runnign heavies, which take the place of all the carry weight stuff in STR
---
I sell all chems 1 cap higher then I can get at the vendor with 15 charisma. Then raise the price with demand. My stimpaks are at 15, diluted stims at 6, super stims at 19. They sell very well at these prices but I may have to raise them soon. Side note: I have healing salves at 5c ea. They are almost as good as diluted stims but I have never sold 1 of them. Why all the hate for healing salves?
---
Apparently it’s not. I finally got sludge lung. Had to let it run its course vs using a disease cure. Couldn’t believe I hadn’t done that before but now have it complete!
---
That’s good to hear. It’s my first play through of PC, and so far it hasn’t been as bad as a typical play through of Xbox. Still trying to figure out how to fix my damage numbers not showing up though.
---
I didn't TELL you to use melee, and you replied with charged comments maybe? Friendly debate isn't what you had there at all.
---
&gt; It's an extremely rare drop from a high level event that usually ends in failure unless people ~~know what they're doing~~ can fucking read.
---
FTFY
---
I got mined yesterday. Never keep useful junk on my. Just finished mining ore and was making bullets. Lost about 1200 lead. Bunch of little kids chuckling and laughing on mic, or grown men with low T. Not sure. Said some childish things then hopped servers. 
---
In the grand scheme of things it was less than 1% of my liquid worth. It made me as mad however of losing everything. I logged off for the evening.
---
Do you use any explosive weapons?
---
Ha! I was only joking and literally said it in my comment but goes to show some people have 0 sense of humor... or just really sensitive to gaming...lol 
---
(This will be also downvoted...lol)
---
sorry you felt that way.
---
Rank 1 grants +10% VATS accuracy per shot, Rank 2 15% and Rank 3 20%.
---
I don't think the daily scrip limit will be changed.
---
Saddddd
---
Unmod all your not used weapons
---
Good to know, I'll have to check if the ones I'm missing are ones I tend to cure instead of waiting out.
---
Sorry sonny, most of the players that are interested in Encryptid are bloody builds. And those lazy fucks ain't picking up pylons. You're usually right though lol
---
word up, thats the way to approach it.
---
I actually think this is one of the best places for pvp thanks to the close quarters layout of the school.  Plenty of walls to duck behind, floors to jump  up or drop down to, etc.
---
If running a bloodied build it hambones you pretty fast. Especially if your afk or in a work bench and have to get out of it.
---
Vats?
---
No, but if you give me everything in your vendors for 10 caps, that's fair.
---
the old guide to returning is woefully out of date and needs to be updated monthly to remain relevant.
---
I've only ever done monster mash solo no one else ever joins but I'm okay with that I'm not a big pvp person and I just do it to try to get a legendary or two (and the screams of the mask sound like rollercoaster tycoon and drives my gf insane lol)
---
Those are about what I sell for
---
I prefer manually sighted, which is why i went with 10% aimied shot damage. on the rifle.
---
What sort of return do you think we will we get for turning in old stuff?
---
Aren't mods forbidden in F76? I heard about lots of bans for some mods adding.
---
&gt; We killed 1/9 of the total *[ pre-war ]* population of America^\*
---
Almost certainly more than the post-war population.
---
( \* assuming, with no evidence, that the pre-war population was similar to the current US population).
---
Give this poor man a Nukashine!
---
If you’re talking about the 50% deal for killing 27 or whatever million scorched, we failed that.
---
Did exactly the same lol
---
That would be the Black Rider armor from The Four Horsemen set. Glad you liked it 😊
---
*Encryptid.*
---
yep amount of water I get through is rediculos. Even when I log off for the night with the meter full the next time I log in im bloody dying of thirst again!😡
---
If you are making sales, your prices are fair.
---
True.
---
However, plastic pumpkins, pumpkins, carved pumpkins, and Halloween wall decorations are already in the game files.  I’m surprised they didn’t release those to us for decorating options.
---
Holy shot I didn’t even know that was there! Maybe there needs to be something at the top of the page that says something about checking that out! And yea it should get a monthly update that follow updates for the game.
---
What  illnesses?
---
We actually blew our goal out by a million my man and it was 30m+
---
As for "gather building supplies", bulking and rescrapping them worked for me.
---
doesn't that turn all the WS robots hostile to you?
---
Cue obligatory reference to Obsidian missing the score for FO:NV...
---
Yes I won my first game a few days ago it was so much fun never even knew the event existed
---
Radshield does it really work better than RadX? Getting Blooms is difficult and in my testing i didnt see any real noticeable difference in rad ingestion while using my limited quantity in a Nuke Zone.
---
-
---
Stacking Questions -
---
Do Rad Resist items Stack?
---
What about Damage Resist and Damage Boost Chems, do any of them stack?
---
Charisma Items (or Selling boosts)?
---
Weight Reduction Legendary Effects?
---
Useless imho and just eat weight which is the stupidest thing ever. 
---
As for using them - Anything over the stash limit is lost. 
---
It warns you if you attempt to use them.
---
Love your prices. As a level 25 I appreciate when people set stims to sub 20 cap prices since they’re a bit rare to find and god knows I die quick as fuck lol.
---
I could bet behind this. Reasonable cap sink
---
Final goal was 35M and we finished with 36+.
---
So...what’s the big deal with “the fixer” plans? Are they god mode or something? I see everyone wanting them and prices being higher than any total I’ve ever even had on hand ( I think 5k was the most I’ve ever had at once  lol)
---
I guess you're right. I just noticed alot of level 100+ players never buy anything except Nukes and cores.
---
I'd love if they implemented some kind of weapon restriction for some PvP events. Giving everyone baseball bats for Monster Mash would be thematically appropriate, but what I teally want is for them to restore the Battle that Never Was at Prickett's Fort and make everyone fight with Revolutionary Swords and Black Powder guns.
---
They haven’t been adding a huge amount lately. I’m guessing they hit us with a bunch when Wastelanders hits maybe? At least Mischief Night will give us some spooky Halloween stuff
---
Thanks for your service.
---
Ah ok thanks for the info!
---
The lowest I could get it was 1750 with 20 charisma.
---
 i have only ever had bad runs everything from golf clubs to boxing gloves. Purveyour will churn your hard earned scrip into junk before you know it. Better off selling cheap and going shopping at playee Vendors for what you actually NEED / WANT. Dont be sucked in people it will only end in tears.
---
I'm guessing that the free states revolutionary outfit doesn't come with the helmet in the free states bundle. Anybody know if it does cuz if it's doesn't that's kinda dumb in my opinion
---
I love my instigating the fixer, can 1/2 shot just about everything. Only gun I use other than my bloodied explosive lever action.
---
Or server hop Sylvie and sons camp and get 300+ in like sixty seconds each time.
---
At what cost.... *looks off into the sunset* was this genocide worth it?
---
You need to know how to craft the fixer to get legendary fixers from the purveyor. By itself the fixer was okay, but not really worth it. Now you can roll legendary fixers, JE fixer, BE fixer, AAE fixer, VE fixer. The gun is a lot better.
---
That's close to what I vendor stuff for. Most of it sells pretty quickly. What doesn't is either super-common or really niche/specific. Grape/Berry Mentats, X-Cell, Psychobuff, and Fury are some chems you could sell for more than 5 caps without losing customers. If you've got the materials and the crafting stations, you could do pretty well as a whiskey purveyor.
---
Some things that I sell easily other than legendaries are clothing items with the word "clean" in the name, like Clean Spacesuit Helmet. They're rare to find, but I see them now and then in the locker room at WS golf club. With display stands in the game now, you can always move magazines and bobbleheads. 100 caps/ea is where I price them and they do not last long. Other display items (robot models &amp; chess pieces, etc.) were hot right when the cases were added but have cooled off considerably since. Holotape games don't have a huge market, but there are players willing to pay a couple hundred caps for them. Serums and flux are always in demand, of course, but you make it sound like you're not at that level either.
---
I completely agree. It limits the game. I’ve been a melee PA user from the start. Lvl 200 plus. I’ve dabbled with heavy guns because they’re in the str tree. 
---
I got a BE Fixer and was considering a stealth commando build but when I did the math, it was going to take 86 levels to change to that spec, and purchase cards. 
---
I know we have 5 character slots, but we can’t share scrap or items beteeen them. It’s like starting the game completely over on them. If I could cross load some items I’d be more inclined. 
---
It’s like so much “could” work with just a little tweaking. Let us have perk load outs or respecs. Let us us xload items. Give me a 30lbs stash in my camp, accessible by all characters.
---
Monster Mash, together with not yet released events like The Battle that Never Was, Run for the Presidency and others based on settlement attack/defense and faction wars come Wastelanders need to be made Public and run on their own timer. And Uranium Feever needs to be freed from the Public Event Curse.
---
They straight up said that all of their attention is on Wastelanders right now. I am fine with atomic shop recycling if that means the DLC drops on time/well.
---
I’m guessing healing salves aren’t connected to a hot key you can spam in battle. The effect is the same, the ease isn’t.
---
Oh ok. Thanks for the info
---
lol yup
---
They could at least streamline the process of hopping.
---
Still the same issue. They have to be given atom shop functionality and the functionality as a buildable item. Once again, these must be added by a patch.
---
Great job everyone. I did a very small part but we all did this together.
---
I have my two characters maxed with scrip.  Working on getting my girlfriend's character there now.
---
The market is about to be sooooo flooded with 3 stars.
---
I’ve heard AP refresh armour only works for 3 pieces. I only have 3 so would like to know if this is true.
---
Thank you, seems easy enough so worth logging on for then
---
The only 2 i don't have are the "kill sbeast queen" and "collect 3 silo pieces"like this week. I don't know if it's a matter of patches but i have all the omes that are considered bugged.
---
The most important thing to know:  The ISS is *invulnerable* until all 3 pylons are taken.  It is a waste of time shooting it if a pylon is free.  If nobody else is taking a pylon the take it yourself.  (Cue lots of whining from bloodied builds).
---
Also, guys, if a pylon holder goes down, revive them.
---
Product testing results, is the same exact dialogue transcript as Product Brainstorming 1 holotape, so I believe the name of that particular item was simply changed for the release of the game. And the Responders recruitment holotape is found from a select few protectrons: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Protectron_(Fallout_76)#Responder_protectron
---
I cannot find the Product Brainstorming 2  holotape thus far.
---
That would require the mods to actually interact with this sub
---
Abbie said that if we were hearing her message then she was dead, fort defiance was overrun by scorched, last I checked they don't take prisoners.
---
Now I just need script lol. I think I have like 30 haha.
---
Okay so it looks like you have your build set to your preferred play style. My suggestions would be if your wanting to dig more into raw dmg move points from strength to agility and build your vats crit dmg. If your having trouble with survivability add dodgey and serendipity if you don’t have it since I can’t look at your build anymore. I think you got a lot of heat in your post because you have a lot of quality of life showing and that’s where people usually focus to trim. I’m sure your doing fine and the only purpose to go down vats is if you want to be able to solo end game activity’s like SBQ and encrypted.
---
Hey that's not fair I always take them.. and then die... and again. I do fine till I decide "hey I should shoot and hold these" and then it runs over and kills me.
---
Those seem fair! 
---
I have my stuff priced about the same, and get pretty good traffic. It really depends on the server and who you’re marketing your stuff to.
---
Hey there! We're aware of this and have been investigating. It seems like it *may* be a visual issue but we're looking into that more.
---
It sounds like you are just selling stims and other chems.  
---
Personally my income of stims, radaway, radx etc far outstrips my usage especially at higher levels when I have my build completely fleshed out and my characters all geared up for endgame.    
---
Only thing I'm looking to buy is high end weapons/armors and I'm willing spend tens of thousands of caps for the right item(s) without hesitation.  Your little diluted stimpacks aren't something I'm in the market for and I'd guess a lot of other high lvl players are in the same boat.  
---
All that said I'd clear out a vendor of psycho and buffout on my junky characters for 5 caps a pop but then again I'd never even visit your vendor in the first place if you don't have weapons/armor and I don't even bother checking vending machines marked "Chems" or whatever.  Only thing I even bother looking at are armors and weapons.  
---
So yeah maybe that helps understand the viewpoint of higher level players.
---
At full health does the Fixer do more than the Lever at base damage no multupliers? I have confirmation it's better damage than a Handmade, which is the highest damage auto rifle. What about single shots?
---
Anhedonia is a medical condition, related to depression.  You might want to see a doctor.
---
Deal! Sold! Hook me up brother!
---
That is awesome to hear, i had routine while studying to listen classical or diamond city radio, but this is new level, lol.
---
On what platform do you play?
---
The dataminers did just do an ama for a lot of stuff. the bot can be tagged and we will also get the question asked.  u/Fo76DatamineAMA
---
I think the main bonus of a radshield is it does not suppress mutations like radx does.
---
if you are looking to buy, you can probabably get the plans themselves in less than an hour of server hopping the three known spawn points.
---
They are fair.The plans could be priced a bit higher (I sell mine for circa 50 caps)
---
Hmmm everyone seems to be very happy ,,, then why so low rating ? I wonder ....
---
I have both, but when im rifles, im usually not getting hit so I dump them for more damage.
---
You are right, I was getting a lot of flak for the QoL stuff i have in Str when im not using heavies.  People I guess didnt see the 9 points of Heavy perks I had set aside as alternates.
---
I do plan on swapping out actionboy for sandman.
---
Another question: is the plan for The Fixer awarded via the prize list upon completion, or found on the corpse of the ISS?
---
Should have named it 'Get Fuzzy' on account of the comic book strip
---
Yeah, I guess thats just a marlet i'm not going to reach until I hit that level. Until then I guess i'll stock up on psycho and buffout.
---
Yo that's sexist. Suzie could be out working and paying the bills while her trophy man stays at home in his red nurse outfit being Johnny the Janitor, Clint the cleaner, or Daddy Dishes.
---
&gt; Sorry sonny
---
On the internet nobody knows you're only 3 years away from retirement.
---
Woof!  Damn, what a giveaway.
---
To test if it's bulletproof?
---
Woah, the free states stuff is back and for individual sale? Good thing I've been saving atoms up.
---
Thank you
---
I'm actually 28 sonny, I just watch a lot of MASH
---
Geez... after reading that, I feel even more fortunate to have found it at some guys vendor for 400 caps
---
IMO it’s only worth till lvl 2. Could use that point somewhere else
---
10 server hops.
---
Thanks I try to keep things new player friendly.
---
Yeah, I bought my second one for like 600 way before they came out with this. Man we just didn't know we was sittin' on fried gold. My first was 2500 cause I hadn't seen it before lol
---
Jeezus.... Think I might just save up for the tree. Maybe the animatronics and light as well. But my god, 6.2k Atoms for all that.. I cannot believe it.
---
Event reward!
---
because of this comment i went to the asylum to check it out and found a blue and a green one :)
---
Wholesome comment is wholesome ❤
---
This has been happening for months now.
---
Probably not, they left it unlocked. I’ll stock my chem vendor with excess free water.
---
It's a prize, you don't even need to get a shot at the ISS.  In fact if you're a conduit you should try to avoid the ISS, even if that means not touching it.
---
I think most of the discover ones are broken, right? I'm fairly certain I've tried to complete them and wasnt able to.
---
I nuked morgan town last night and got about 10 high rad fluid and 10 glowing mass. Basically went through the town 3 times for that.
---
On a serious note, should i buy the PC version?
---
Once again another non-mothman backpack. 😔

tags are fun! Answered by /u/Waffle_Cop

(It's me that's 3 years of retirement, that's why I think being called "sonny" is funny).
---
Or just let us type in the amount for crying out loud. Why does everything have to use a damn slider.
---
I mean she didn't know when she was actually going to die did she? And it's not like she would come back from the dead to quickly activate her holotape so it's not really reaching to say she could still be alive, any writer could come up with a thousand scenarios.
---
Same with Moreno and Grant. Eg: Moreno watches Taggerdy and co die in Glassed Cavern, takes note of the laboratories and comes to the conclusion he needs to find the creators of the Scorchbeasts to defeat them as conventional warfare just doesn't work. Goes back to Fort Defiance to pack his bags and finds it under fire, saves Grant and others and they go off n do their thing. That would eventually lead us to the ultracite cavern from the Wastelanders trailer, featuring the guy in the datamined 'Secret Service Power Armour' aka Enclave aka Scorchbeast creators. Just a hunch but there's plenty of other ways you could write it.
---
No just trying to figure if I put them in vendor or on display.
---
scrip\*
---
Use Diluted radx and you're good. :)
---
If you pass by my camp take something from the punchbowl.
---
(It's not *all* vintage Nukashine...)
---
I saw a CAMP yesterday under the bridge on the way into the cranberry bog. The had walled up the sides and you had to drop in through the hole in the bridge to get in. Was one of the best CAMPs I've ever seen. You could probably do something similar with a bunker style entrance on top.
---
Thank you. 👍
---
I'm at the Junk pile outside of The Whitespring.
---
It does but you can just server hop after you clear them
---
Aww still need a bear arm plan anyone selling on pc?
---
There are eight different species of bear! The North American Black Bear, the Brown Bear, the Polar Bear, the Asiatic Black Bear, the Spectacled Bear, the Giant Panda, the Sloth Bear, and the Sun Bear!
---
Noice
---
Idk what yer babbling about. Tho I can tell you that I wont play a game that has a mechanic that encourages PvP, engage in that mechanic, and then be upset when PvP happens.
---
Love you're username lol

If you're on PC ... "save everything"

Rad resist armor items stack, though I'm not sure if that's your question?  Still despite this nothing beats PA or a hazmat suit as these items have a hidden radiation reduction in addition to resistance.  Reduction is a flat % of damage ignored, and resistance only offers diminishing returns.  So if you could achieve 1000 radiation resist without PA or a hazmat suit, you would still take more rads in a nuke zone than a hazmat suit because you'd be missing the reduction.  
---
charisma stacks but only to a hidden cap, I want to say it's 25.  
---
DR stacks with chems but you can typically only have 1 chem active at a time.  There's a few minor exceptions to that rule.  
---
Weight reduction stacks up to the hidden cap of 90%.
---
Oh cool who's your favorite MASH character? Personally I liked Colonel Blake but then ya know he left the show in the worst way. Potter was funny enough to replace though
---
And people say f76 is bad... ofcourse it had its problems but still fun and useful
---
They never intended for hopping to be a thing I dont think, I may be wrong.
---
Seem to get loads of glowing mass but no hardened mass
---
She is just a random encounter.
---
(I'm getting back on the 20th, so I get to profit from the sale despite being a deadbeat.  Assuming the plane isn't delayed...)
---
Mistress of Mystery items would be cool to have added.
---
I bought the cultist masks since they were on sale and creepy looking. But they clip thru damn near every outfit.
---
The Urban variant is the “light” variant while the Forrest variant is the “heavy” variant I think.
---
Nothing useful, but overloaded.
---
It's a random spawn, I'm pretty sure. Found her a couple of times myself recently. You might've put your CAMP over a random event spawn point.
---
That's what I thought too, but I tested it and they are. Same button as stims. Their healing gets increased with the first aid perk too. I end up just useing the salves I make and sell all my stims.
---
I'm not here for the mechanics of the game. I'm here for fallout and that community that always picks up the flop whatever company hands us. The modding community of the last games is the active community of this one
---
lol no you just built your camp on or very near a random encounter spawn
---
Hard to tell since you haven't  filled out all your stats.
---
No it's not, maybe you can use Atomic Radio, but I don't know if that is released on xbox
---
Never watched much MASH, I'm really a *Dad's Army* fan.
---
The ATOM shop hasn't even got anything interesting in a month now. Just a lot of released items and recoloring.
---
164 and 44
---
4,5,6 times?  Those are rookie numbers.  My record is 27 times, no joke.
---
Some night getting fast travel to work IS the end game.
---
Sweet, I can push it even further!
---
I may have 2 or 3. I'll check when I get on tonight. Around 1730 EDT
---
that is where one of my players CAMPs is at, and there is indeed a random encounter location there, but ive never had one appear through my floors!
---
It's not really bait imo, it's like one of the only ways to show you would like to PvP now. Baiting would be if had had stealthed friends that were gonna pop you too. A lot of people think *any* PvP is griefing but this sounds v polite
---
Same.. lol
---
Without the sale? Madness. Absolute madness
---
I noticed the same thing.  The weekly challenges seem a little anemic.  There  are normally more, with at least one that is worth 40 Atoms.
---
Additionally,  the "Find Silo Code Pieces" challenge appears to still be bugged.  Has  anyone been able to progress or complete this challenge?  I've collected  four silo codes -- three from the quest "Hide and Seek and Destroy" --  and none have counted.
---
In Monster Mash, is pacifist mode automatically off? Or do I have to remember to toggle it?
---
I'm rolling Cult, but TBH, I'd rather be repping Children of Atom.
---
Maybe there'll be a story thread involving MODUS starting the Children of Atom in Wastelanders. His obsession with mutation isn't exactly on script with the Enclave's values in later games.
---
You did give me a great idea for my next rave: Furry Nite.  Animal outfits only!
---
Is online as shit as everyone claims?
---
Fat stacks of caps
---
Take pics!
---
I'm leaving on a honeymoon and will be gone from 10/18/19 through 10/28/19. I feel like I'm gonna miss the entire thing now that it's still not out 😔
---
Hello, do you always need the relevant plan for a chance of a legendary version dropping, it is it just The Fixer? Thanks in advance.
---
bro you just posted cringe
---
Resippies just look like resippies in display, nobody can see the name
---
On Rad Resist i was mainly wondering on Chems. I already run in Excavator (too much hoarding have to use that for weight) but still take on rads faster than i would like. Wondering if i popped RadX, Diluted, RadShield, and Glowing Blood Packs if it would have any effect or would i just be wasting chems.
---
On Charisma I always do Grape Mentats and Hard Bargain when i buy/sell and Charisma Bobblehead on big Purchases or when i was buying a lot of of plans at once but one time i tried adding Day Tripper and some other Charisma up chems and it seemed some/one of them seemed overwrite the Grape Mentats effect and actually raised the prices higher than they were with just Grape Mentats the Perk Card and a Charisma Bobble. I am buying up Serums now so i need all the savings i can get.
---
Haha I had a feeling someone would say something :P
---
There was a big update a few weeks ago. Content is fun, I certainly have a good time with it. You can ignore it or play it. Just mind the bugs, there's plenty.
---
I usually craft Rad Ant Lager whenever I come across ant meat and I stick it in my vending machine for 25 caps.
---
I'll typically go about a week without selling any but then a single player usually buys my whole Rad Ant Lager supply.
---
It would probably sell quicker if I was in a better location.
---
I know, but I figure if its sitting next to the hat in the display ...... lol /shrug
---
Which is why I'm not 100% looking forward to *Wastelanders*.
---
Super stims can easily be 40-50 caps, and regular stims 20. You’re definitely selling yourself short on those.
---
&gt; I couldn’t handle all the dialogue and NPC yapping!
---
Lol woohoo, right now I'm just dropping the costume all over server hopping....
---
The correct amount of fuzzy
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dia0q9/atom_shop_update_october_15th_for_those_at_work_rn/
---
well i had an issue with this quest but it was different then yours , and after months of working with them they finally just reset the quest and all was good so maybe ask them to do that.
---
Now that armor penetration is fixed for non-ballistic damage, can someone with a better grasp of the damage reduction formula and math in general take a look at how it performs with split damage weapons (like the Shishkebab or Plasma Gun)? I'm wondering if the armor penetration is effectively doubled, since it applies to both ballistic and energy damage now.
---
What even is it?
---
Basically a month with no updates kinda stinks. Means wastelanders is probably really close. They are likely patching everything for wastelanders
---
Did you change 1000 scrip without the sale? Um... well you could have at least gotten 2x more chances to get nothing...
---
I’ve been playing with no music for awhile now. It makes it feel more real. Especially when you can hear the radio in the distance.
---
Love the idea of a “common stash” limited box. Even something that could be unlocked - I remember something like that in borderlands2, that could be found - a box for “twinking” items between characters.
---
pretty sure pacifist doesn't matter for the player that's "it".  But it might matter for other players that are not "it", I'm not completely sure.
---
No, just fixer and the bear arm thing. Not 100% sure about the few sheepsquat related melee weapons, the crook and was there another.
---
This was introduced as feature couple of patches ago. But all other normal weapons always in the game, don't require any plans for the Purveyor to give them.
---
that's the bottom line haha I'll for sure be making another video with the 50% sale
---
I always see that area in the bottom right getting nuked, but Idk if my flimsy raider PA would keep me alive against all those scorch beasts, but it could be worth a shot especially if i get a legendary. I'll try that thanks.
---
People used to do that even before survival went away. Sometimes a wanted lower level character with a high level buddy lurking around. Personally if you want me to chase you, a 5 or 10 cap bounty isn't worth my time. Pump those rookie numbers up to 100 maybe. 😂🤣
---
Bulk only reduces weight on lead and aluminium. It would be great if it behaved that way for every item you bulk. Would solve a lot of trouble
---
dude honeymoon is way more important
---
Id value tank killer the highest for damage if that helps you decide what to do.
---
Did we make it? Or is it still going on maybe?
---
It wasn't going to reply because of the use of the threes in your Gamertag, but I am the sheriff of the central Appalachian sheriff's department so I must provide assistance. What exactly are you needing? Add me.
---
Gt = TEH RED ZMAN
---
Obviously lol. But I was hoping it would show up before I left lol
---
Sadly this was they answer when I asked them exactly that a week ago.
---
 As it is, the Bethesda  Customer Support team does not have the ability to change your quest  progress or forcibly grant quest rewards due to the limitations of our  tools for the game.
---
Thank you. I appreciate you clarifying. Have a great day.
---
Definitely, sadly i won't be able to visit you because I'm on XB1, but nice seeing you enjoy your time in Appalachia!
---
No problem, what level are you? Also if your worried you can stay outside of the radiation zone but within shooting distance and just take out the guys on the ground so the big guns can focus on the SB. That way you contribute and are relatively safe until you level up enough to be the big guns in the middle of it all
---
this.  There's no other way to flag yourself as open to pvp except maybe playing pvp events like monster mash and taking workshops and then defending them if/when they get contested.  
---
Though workshops get taken by players who are not into pvp all the time so that's not the best way to volunteer for it ingame.
---
Google hard. Plz give me info as I’m incapable of using the computer by myself.
---
Finding loot isnt the hard part, its letting go.
---
Unless they changed it from how it was before, the free state jet packs are not mods like other jet packs, so they cannot be attached to the raider/ultracite pieces like regular ones can. It also doesn't require you to learn the jet pack to craft it. It's basically a separate item with the skin permanently attached to it.
---
I helped a group yesterday. The queen was as difficult as a regular scorchbeast to them and went down in a few minutes.
---
because I didnt pay $60 just to joke around with my discord buddies, I can do that for free.
---
your prices seem really fair dude, you and i pretty close in prices.
---
i sell all diluted chems to vendor bots
---
but as for full strength chems we are pretty close, im a touch cheaper (10 for stims and radaway, 15 for superstims, 5 for purified water, all ammo is the same at 1 each) if someone buys enough stuff off me and im there i will throw in a little something extra to say thank you
---
Literally lock your doors and move your camp a few feet. If they pick the locks, they get tagged for pvp and you can kill them.
---
Wait until you're on a server that's dropping good loot, then spend all your scrip.
---
If the world is dropping stalkers pipe rifles and medics shotguns you know she will be too. When you loot that AA handmade or bloody melee weapon, that's the time to go visit her.
---
two.. I only use marsupial and grounded..
---
I like it  because I don't have to run 1-3 pts of class freak which IMO are better spent elsewhere..
---
And just this once, most of them were worth having?
---
people keep talking about this discord thing.  What exactly is this, some PC chat room thing like TeamSpeak or Ventrillo?  If so, you had to buy your computer to use this thingy, so its way more than 60 bucks.
---
When I want to joke around with my friends I actually go to their houses, or they come to mine, and we talk in person.
---
Making friends, or having a good time with someone you may never see again is itself an experience.  You dont need to be part of a special clique with a chat room to do that.
---
Probably :(
---
At lvl500+ maybe they’re just looking for something else to do in game...
---
Not very rare, there’s a few world spawns.  A new player may buy it for less than 100.
---
No other way to gain a bounty now except for 5 caps at a time lol
---
Bless you for this post.
---
Sweet, thanks.
---
Awesome I'll remember this for my next vendor video, thanks!!
---
He’s wanted cause he wants to fight and/or pvp... What’s confusing?
---
Fingers crossed for the fog machine...
---
That’s what all murderers say... she was just there dead at my place... don’t know how she got there... we’ve all heard this before... you have the right to remain silent...lol
---
Grafton’s mayor approves
---
No arguments! Now, I haven't read up on it for a while, but I think I remember hearing that you don't have a follower in that you don't have someone following you around. So maybe the perks like you might get in 4 after you reach a certain relationship level, but without having them babble endlessly along behind you.
---
Yes, cl4ptrap literally says its for Twinking xD I would pay AtomsTM for a shared stash.  I would pay 800 atoms happily and 1000 with a bit of grudge but still pay it.
---
It’s all rng
---
Just got yesterday one from Buried with honor
---
I'm thinking thee seasonal event will run up until the 5th of November. I heard that on someone's youtube channel so I'm not 100% sure but you should be able to get in on it.
---
yes, its exactly that. I play with a group called "The Fever Clan". We have ranks you can earn within the group and organized events we run and all sorts of community projects. We have been farming scorched for the challenge for the past week, among other things.
---
Check out the Fever Clan! We are a Multi-game discord server (mainly Fallout 76) https://discord.gg/Y5sjYTY
---
We have 30+ people in our voice chat every weeknight and do everything from community events to vault 94 raids. https://www.feverclan.com/forums/threads/fallout-76-discord-etiquette.139859/
---
I tried to do that for someone. Jumped off a watchtower roof for someone to revive me for a badge... but I survived! So does the intention to help count as goodwill and kindness? lol
---
No only applies to crafting chems/stable fluxes/ammo/grenades/weapons/armor/food
---
Good thing I just started playing and am missing out on this awesome deal amIright guys? 😩😩😩
---
Well not definitely sure but I've noticed when one weekly/daily challenge is absent it pops up as an extra the following week/day
---
Is there even more then one type of typewriters? Never found another one then the blue one.
---
You can buy them from vedors. 2k caps
---
You can buy the recall card from robot vendors. It’s a pretty steep price if I remember correctly, but yeah you can repeat the event as many times as you can afford it basically
---
There's only 4 cows in that event though right? I'm talking about 10-12 at least that are moooooovin' on up to brahmin heaven!
---
Thanks!
---
I think they thought you were going somewhere else with it lol.
---
\*grins\* I know how you DON'T play: "small tedious sidequests".
---
&gt; all of you can stop complaining about how there's nothing new to spend atoms on and go back to complaining about how everything is in bundles or too expensive.
---
Yep.
---
I remember last time this didn't work but I thought it got stuck on 2/3. The first one I picked up today didn't count so I'm assuming it still has problems.
---
Sounds like quite the collection of gamers.
---
I was once part of an online gaming team similar to this. It was more work than my job.
---
Now I dont belong to guilds or gamer groups or the like because you ask too much of someone with a family, full time job, and other hobbies that im sorry to say are way more fun.
---
Keep doing you though.  More power to you.  Not my cup of tea.  I hate being around more than 5 people, and you have 30 people all talking at once.  That sounds like more of a headache than anything.
---
Thank god! You're a hero, friend! Good thing I... sold... all of my rad-x. Well crap.
---
You killed Kora!  Murderer!
---
Not working for me either. Not found anything helpful online. Seems to be just an ignored but long-known issue.
---
If you saved up 200 scrip, probably.
---
This just happened to me last night, set fast travel to Watoga train station and appeared at the R&amp;G Station.
---
I also wish we had radios for each different station. I think it'd be funny to have Rose's channel tuned in playing in your base.
---
Guessing the small dungeon is the burrowed, what's the large dungeon?
---
I mean, I'm basically gonna do with it what i do with fallout. I'm not out to try to rush to the endgame or meta or be godmode, rather use it as a social platform to hang out with friends.
---
There’s still a million left to say that they’re sorry.
---
Lol all good, I struggled with this for a while before someone told me, at this point I do believe the player base for this game IS THE ACTUAL game guide
---
Ok cool that answers that then thanks dude.
---
One word.
---
Mule
---
We made it. 36.1 million.
---
You got me! did her in myself!
---
You'll never take me alive copper!
---
They are just uncommon drops now.  Keep farming.
---
this group is mostly people 30+ but okay go ahead and assume. this is a casual game bro, we arent a hardcore WoW raiding guild. we all have families and full time jobs
---
IMO the only 3rd star that's really worth it is 90% reduced weight. That attribute is super nice though for obvious reasons. Worth spending for the extra star I think unless you are the type of person who only keeps a few weapons and gets rid of everything else that you're not using.
---
I just thought it was a cool idea. Not trying to get technical and stuff.
---
Take that filthy scorched, do you know when the discounts start?
---
The AUDACITY! It's not even past Halloween yet xD
---
The Chasm. It's the one underneath Arktos Pharma with the Project Paradise event. Still a really good spot to check for leggies, and the only place to find high level mobs in the Forest. Also it's only a little bit bigger than Burrows, but Burrows is really cramped so feels smaller
---
That would be amazing.
---
Its to know even the CMs don't  have everything. I don;t even use rifles, but I still want the Fixer plan.
---
You are on ps4 right, if so I randomly found your base before. 
---
Sadly I was not at a rave just rode the rides. If that is correct then I also bought I think a hunters long coat from your vender.
---
Never knew that daily gave em.
---
sorta.  there's the carlisle typewriter from fo4 (which looks the same, but i think gives more scrap components)  but i just meant it like a joke, if the perk was wood/steel/ etc particularly weigh less in storage (or bulked items).  like, for scrap runs, a perk that makes desk fans 1/10th weight; just spitballin' here
---
This is why I carry around 100 fusion cores constantly lol. The weight drops down to 0.3 lbs with 3/3 Batteries Included.
---
Xbox
---
There not that amazing butI liked the owl. I’m not into that collecting rare items, just things I like and fit my build
---
Net cost of a 3 star weapon roll is going to be a total of 10 scrip when you factor in the refund.
---
Going to be a shit-load of overburdened characters in Appalachia.
---
yes this is real
---
Tank Killer most likely is not highest for damage in vats builds. Shooting a weak point increases damage by 2x on most enemy types. This also applies to both portions of the critical hit formula. Critical hits are great because they add damage that completely ignores armor. So you could say they are like 100% anti armor.
---
That being said, some enemies, like Yao Guai only take 25% more damage on their weak point, so Tank Killer should win there.
---
You should still get it even if you just started playing. No worries.
---
Thanks for sharing, that, actually. I was seriously looking at them to go with the ritual bindings (since I don't care for the mask that goes with it already), but if they clip...
---
My exact reaction! 😂
---
I have one for sale... it'll only cost you an explosive 50 Cal with reduced weight. :P
---
I'm going to try this.. Thanks I generally run about 500-600 lbs in my stash so I will dump my all my junk and retry I didn't have this issue up until about 2 weeks ago.
---
Level 280 Pre-order (figured most would think  I'm new with saying 500-600 stash!)
---
Tires. Don't forget the damn tires. 'Cause every camp needed more tires, right? \*eye roll\*
---
Good bot. 🤣
---
That’s not the point, the game is broken. I’ve had this happen to me twice before in scorched earth events.
---
From your keyboard to BGS' screens...
---
Pretty please?
---
Yeah, after probably million attempts i finally got one 🤣
---
I've been trying to pull myself away and play games on gamepass like world war z or Dishonored 2, just to try to switch it up. Even tried the new metro for alittle bit, but it isn't much compared to 76. Even going back to try and finish fallout 4... I just cant, it's different and doesn't feel like good ol Appalachia
---
A weightless one would be nice to have for Buried With Honor. The shovel that’s supposed to be there is usually gone. 6w is too much, but 0.6w is fine for something I need often. (They could change the quest so that we don’t need a shovel, but I’m not holding my breath on that.)
---
I drop my shovel back down in a baggie, but it’s not an ideal solution for the next player.
---
The name you see on the map is literally their gamertag name. Go to the messages menu, type in their name and send a message. Or you can access their profile by using the Search User in the friends menu and send a message that way.
---
I’ve never played with music.
---
Aww, you going to be okay? For now, you can wear your costume and put ALL the plastic pumpkins in display cases all over your camp. The hunt is on to find ALL the pumpkins!
---
I've done encrypted around 15 times and didn't get the plans. Sucks you're out the 2k without a chance but you prolly weren't going to get the drop first try anyways.
---
For melee swing speed, does speed demon increase it? Is there a cap that makes martial artist combined with the Swing Speed legendary effect wasted?
---
Costs the same to make as any jet pack, it is not a skin applied to an existing jet pack.

The damage numbers on explosive weapons, especially tse, seem to overlap for me and frequently display the low numbers on top. I think it's a display issue, for me at least,  because I'm frequently 2-shotting max level supermutants with my tse auto rifle. Are you also having trouble killing stuff?

I am sure I missed some, but I'm too lazy to look them up.
---
I don’t really care much about the drop. It’s the fact that doing difficult events like this are impossible if I die only to be stuck on the respawn screen.
---
I thought exactly the same thing about that modern art. I will grab it because it is free, but the only reason I am not saying I will never use it is that I don't want to kick myself if I do later... Never say never! But it is... well, ghastly.
---
And I buy a fridge if (and ONLY if) it is a Nuka Cola fridge. Although I might be tempted by a plain white one where the bottom isn't falling off...
---
Takes the fun out of it, you know what I’m saying?
---
I can see that. I guess we can only see how it goes. I’m just excited for new content, even though there’s still so much more I have to discover.
---
I'm happy they finally unbundled that backpack because I really wanted it but not "28 dollars" level of want.
---
On PSN? If so cam we be friends?
---
I have no issue feeling pleasure, as I will surely feel it once I get to lvl 100 and can retire this game.
---
Confusing, no. Seeing this behavior on a lvl 500 player, odd. As far as I could tell, I was the second highest level player on that server with 340, followed by high 100s and the rest below 100. What I know about optimized PvP builds, being 200+ yet alone 500+ fugitive is almost certainly a death sentence for most adventure players.
---
yea bud i don't know how long you have played this game but it's a rare drop i have over 2000 hours and do all the dailies / events that can drop that outfit and havnt got one yet  , I do have 2 other rare outfits (leather coat) (responders fireman)  from other events but not that one yet
---
I have never been able to do much damage with this thing. Super mutants seem to be 4-5 shots. L50 Scorchbeasts take forever.  
---
Main reason I became a melee player was because of how crappy this gun seems to be for me.
---
+karma
---
Thanks! You can ask me for more facts any time. Beep boop.
---
3/3 is amazing for full auto rifles aimed at their heads. Just fire a few rounds and you'll be plinking headshots at 100% for quick kills. I didn't think I'd like it as much as I did but it's awesome.
---
Did you actually want an answer to that? I feel like it might be too depressing...
---
Mothman, who?  All praise the hallowed Mr. Fuzzy!
---
Happens. 
---
Sometimes waiting works. Like at the queen. I've got up and went for a smoke break and when i came back i was able to spawn again. Queen was there and everything. 
---
Sry about your bad luck
---
Basically I put either small, large, or major for what these updates added to the game. However, that's only in terms of content. For example I would say player vending and the legendary vendor were bigger adds than say vault raids or the Arktos Pharma dungeon. Still a buggy game though, but that's what Bethesda is. Wastelanders will be like a chapter 2 with a supposedly different feel but I am cautious
---
Agree that it is frustrating but "banning" it from public events is probably just as time consuming as fixing the issue in the first place. I've got no advice other than a pat on the back and affirmation that it sucks for the rest of us too.
---
Maybe because your second shot isn't hitting? I have one and I basically stopped using it because it was so inaccurate unless I constantly was using the scope (my tse lever is better for accuracy usually). Also, do you have Tank Killer? Your rifle has basically no armor penetrating mods due to the drum receiver. I'd switch to stinging or higher. These are just my guesses if it's not a visual glitch.
---
Nah I knew it was rare, I was curious if it literally hadn't dropped since last update as speculated. I traded a travelling leather coat for it I have around 700 hours so still learning lol.
---
The damage numbers reflect actual damage dealt, after any DR the target has. It will rarely match the damage numbers exactly. Your Fixer has an armor penetrating magazine on it by default, your handmade does not. 
---
A two shot weapon fires two bullets, each one has its own damage number. The explosive part gets a 3rd damage number—or more if there are multiple targets taking area damage. That explosive damage isn’t very high, so heavily armored targets can ignore it. The damage shown on the weapon is the total of both bullets and the explosive damage. 
---
If you’re close to a target, both bullets will probably hit together. While they do each do their own damage—55+55 for example—they often float right on top of each other, so it only looks like one, but it’s not. If you’re far away, the bullets can spread, sometimes with only one hitting.
---
Doubtful, would be p2w but there's been oversights before
---
No. There is no excavator jetpack available to add it to the armor in the first place.
---
Nuking Whitesprings is a good option too but you'll get more competition there so you gotta get in quick.
---
\*giggling\* Project: Clean Out The Atom Shop should be a thing. See how many atom points people earn in a two week period... It would interesting to see the difference between the people who grind the points vs. the people who don't/
---
How about no Scott,  Okay?
---
I'm not disappointed personally, but I do see it as a missed opportunity for them to get extra $$$
---
It's never too late to get it touched up!
---
All those +40% bash damage for the Melees... is that another bug? I heard something similar for the mystery pick about Melee but I didn't took part in it plus I never go for melee so I don't know if this is a problem or RNG.
---
I hate to say this (I love this game, and all my other BGS titles), but don't hold your breath...
---
Thank you so much! I'm glad to know someone at Bethesda is seeing this!  
---
I think I might be the first person to get the Raider symbol tatted haha.
---
ok cool i wast trying to sound douche about it i just see these posts with people with 50 hours wondering why they haven't got  X outfit to drop yet and they don't realize how low those odds really are, but yea 700 hours sounds about right to get traveling leather coat lol thats about how many hours i had before i got my first rare clothing
---
Excavator is basically "I want to trade Jetpack functionality for 100 carry weight".
---
It's a design decision.
---
The free state jetpack is already kind of p2w in the sense that you don't need to learn the jet pack plan to craft it for the corresponding armors that have jet pack mods.
---
This never really went away with survival around or gone. Hell it went on in survival too. Truthfully, aside from the obvious full group trap that people like to spring I'm actually okay with a single guy intentionally getting a bounty. He knows whomever comes after him is looking for pvp, or at least they should be. Never assume that your bounty is just going to roll over and die for you.
---
Actually shes the only place I am getting good drops lately.  My green comrades at West Tek haven't been dropping squat the last couple of weeks.
---
I doubt it would take more coding to ban it than to fix the performance issues. The game still has performance issues despite this being the same engine used in an iteration of games. You'd think that an iteration of games would improve the engine to where these performance issues wouldn't exist but, whatever ya know?
---
Is it a skin then? I thought it was a mod (I'm sure I saw couple of threads complaining that is wasn't a skin and require crafting a new jetpack (ie needing flux).
---
From my point of view. The queen fissure was very busy last night on the servers I was in.
---
Pretty sure that's one of them oversights I talked about
---
No I don’t have Tank Killer. And it looks like I don’t have the stinging mod. I have piercing though.
---
Awesome, this is what I was wondering. Thank you for the help.
---
Wow that’s perfect. Thank you.
---
Enemy armor, most likely.
---
My handmade is quad crit -25% AP cost. It lists about 78 damage in my pipboy. It has dealt over 1,000 per shot. The difference between you and I is likely our playstyles. 
---
I rely entirely on multipliers. I use Covert Operative and Mister Sandman for 3.75x more damage. I use Concentrated Fire for 2x more damage on head shots. Those three perks increase my damage by 7.5x. All my critical bonuses seem to give me around 150 extra damage on critical hits. Head shots also double that for 300 more damage. So, 78x7.5 + 300 = 885 damage. After some Adrenaline and Gunfu kicks in, I can hit for over 1,000.
---
A solid build is more important than the gun you use.
---
Tip of the hat for your reference there. "Polish my spear." "But it's so huge! It could take all night!"
---
I hate to repeat the comment I JUST made on your comment above, but this needs to be a thing!
---
That doesn't go into all of the QoL changes. Like there's too many of those to remember all of them. Like stash is 800 pounds now, dunno wtf we did when we had 200
---
Oh I see. I'm certainly not in for the 5 caps and I'm always wary on clearing wanted status on 100+ players. I guess I was lucky this time given the fact I'm not a PvP build and it took almost hundred bullets to kill the other player (I saw health regen, ignored damage and coming back from almost zero health; life-saving, sentinel, serendipity, etc.)
---
Laggy legendary armor?  What is this?
---
Im not finding any issues with the weights tbh. But then again I dont ask 10k caps for a bloodied weapon. And if a gun is shit I get rid of it. Also, ask yourself if you really need 500 wood or antiseptic.
---
Yeah but you can't hurt them
---
TS will deal less damage, also increase recoil and increase weapon durability damage.
---
50% limb damage is pure hot garbage, it only increases "cripple a limb damage" , no actual damage boost.
---
AA will be flat out better, it's also more effective on low damage per hit weapons like the GL I think.
---
It is a skin, but it functions like a crafted item. They do not have skin slots for the jetpack to add it to, so you can only craft it for the power armor sets that actually have a jetpack available. And you don't need to learn the corresponding jetpack plan to craft it either.
---
You get legendary armor from completing a certain amount of the vault 94 raid's. You get a # vault steel, buy legendary armor mods from the purveyor, and craft it.  There's known performance issues with this being that in a public event the poison damage expands to such a point your game can't render it fast enough and just crashes and/or freezes completely. I have a high performance computer and the hardware doesn't really matter because the armor was lacklustardly added to the game in spite of performance issues.
---
Santa in October? I am so sold. I like your style! I saw Christmas stuff in a store the other day, so you're not too early! I mean, this was before Canadian Thanksgiving (which was yesterday), so you have to admire their enthusiasm!
---
Thank you for the info. I’ve tried to wrap my head around doing a different build but it all confuses the hell out of me.  I’ll look into it. Thanks again!
---
Really? The guys just asking a question to get some insight on the event. Google might give an overview but there’s nothing wrong with wanting to get a player’s perspective on things, since generally, that’s more helpful in deciding if it’s something they may want to try out for themselves. No need to be a dick.
---
Your AA has better 2nd and 3rd stars, and IMO Anti-Armor is better than Two Shot because it doesn't come with penalties to accuracy and degradation.
---
Is this real and backed by datamined facts or is this the Fallout 76 flavour of MMO superstition, anectodal evidence and confirmation bias?
---
I remember many years ago on another game everyone was completely certain that using health potions or using healing/defensive magic would affect monster's loot negatively, which obviously wasn't true. But with the way the Fallout 76 codes are set up I can't really say this time. Plus this is the first time I've stored so many scrips, I usually go for the lottery the moment I reach enouh scrips to pay for a round.
---
Yeah idk, possibly. Not the worst effect to be bugged I guess haha
---
I have over 1800 hours and as i said yesterday got it. Lvl 460 btw
---
She has for me in the past but the past month or some has been straight garbage for me
---
Gotta start somewhere. I’ll buy from lower levels just strictly because I want to help them out. Capitalism is alive and well in FO76 and that means free market economy for all, regardless of level.
---
That's balls. :(
---
I didn't mind so much because I don't really like using power armor in the first place, haha.
---
Relatable lol
---
From the 17th 'till the 21st.
---
They don't look as good as the normal mask. I combined it with the explorer outfit. Best combo I found.
---
Hmmm...haven't had this happen to me yet.  Must have been fortunate in my last 5 events.  Still can't get a fixer plan, but I do now have 31 white fedoras 😉
---
Im guessing that hats arnt worth much since those are easy to get? i think the forrest hat even has a set spot because i found 2 of those in the same spot already :D
---
I think so, too. I suspect it's a marketing side pushing the MTX and Battle Royale stuff, whereas the devs probably just want to create another really awesome Fallout world.
---
So I assume that you have it? If so, does it work with ultracite armor (I ask as I believe it came out before the ultracite jetpack was released).
---
If you see the name on the camp then find their dot on the map you can see their level
---
Has it ever occurred to you that you lack patience and/or the ability to focus? Maybe you've got a touch of that ADD.
---
I think they mean build your camp to look like the fight arena, convince people to come, convince them to stash all their stuff, collect what we weapons you want them to use, hand the stuff out, referee the fight, pay the winner, pay &amp; collect on the bets, then collect the fight gear. 
---
You would have to learn how to be a bookie and fight promoter and ref and sanctioning body. 
---
Sounds like a lot of work to lose caps :)
---
I like your idea as a developer-created thing, especially if they hand out random gear that prevents the min/max that made pvp pointless.
---
I did the sheepsquatch event, failed it the first time because my game crashed completely. Purchased the recall keycard for 1980 caps. Attempted it the second time, game froze completely but, I stayed to get credit (got no legendary loot). Other times, I've frozen completely at the queen because someone was using it and I get nothing and hear the game loop through the sound of people firing for like 10 minutes until the queen is dead and I get no credit or the game just crashes completely and the quest doesn't even complete.
---
i dont think so my main character is lvl 280 or such and i dont really use it for pvp
---
my pvp character is currently lvl 61 and im pretty much done 
---
all perks i choose now are to bring me some variety 
---
i guess most players who are interested make a dedicated pvp character and at least when youre lvl 70 you should be done with your build
---
Nah I know it's all good and yeah just recently got a Forrest nurse uniform too from jump fort defiance so things are knitting together nicely lol.
---
&gt;Planters should have always been in the game I agree.
---
&gt;stairs are the worst for the “not accessible” when there are walls around them and you have to remove them all.
---
&gt;the terrain manipulation... the game can barely run as is lol I’d be terrified to see the camps load in with terrain movement 😂
---
I support everything
---
Ooh thank you!
---
So first of all, thank you OP for sharing this. You're a hero.
---
Second of all, it's been said before, but scrap kits as a featured item? Pardon? Were you that desperate, Bethesda?
---
And third, why does no one ever notice that the head is the owl Fasnacht mask? The only reason I haven't bought it is that it's not Mothman. It's a damn owl. And who has the inclination to build a church to the Unnamed Owl?
---
Yes I have it and it works with raider and ultracite.
---
Almost always play no music and footstep volume 100%. Stealth character. Make the world come alive. The atmospherics are amazing in this game.
---
Halloween isn't for another month yet. We're running on Bethesda Standard Time in this game which runs about a month behind regular time but also a few hundred years in the future.
---
Well then, someone on ps4 is doing the same thing and their base looks very similar.
---
I have an idea that vendors aren't really for high level players--not by design but by, I don't know, luck of the RNG and time played? Most of us have a great set of armor and weapons. We have a bunch of caps. We know most (or all) of the available plans. Going from vendor to vendor and looking for that great deal on a plan or a one-in-a-thousand replacement for our already great armor piece is essentially what is happening. It's a way to kill time and caps.
---
Instead, vendors are most effective for people somewhere around level 40-150. These characters have some caps to spend and probably haven't found the powerful weapons and armor yet. Maybe they need the good deal on black titanium or a marsupial serum. That's the real market.
---
What do you think?
---
Awesome thank you :)
---
I use, wendigo cave, watoga medical, hawkes refuge, west tek, the maw, burrows, v94solo.
---
yea that sounds about right lol i need that and i need the white helmet to go with my repsonders fireman
---
do all your vending machines need power?  if i hook up one, it'll show on the global radar.  can customers that FT to my location shop from unpowered machines?
---
It's the \*only\* way to play.
---
I'm still waiting on the Skull and Cross bones Jolly Roger backpack that was data mined last year.
---
I have ESO. I think it might actually be the most intimidating thing in my library. It made me laugh. I somehow ended up doing the beta for Elsweyr, and a friend who plays was so jealous. When it was just the one DLC, and not many people playing, it was awesome! But the actual game? Intimidating as eff.
---
To everyone out there grinding hundreds of kills on their main account like myself. Good work.
---
Whats even worse is the high lvl players selling weapons for 10k jus because it has explosive effect. It jus makes it frustrating. Im a lvl 150 and havent set up a vending machine yet because i fell i dont have anything special to sell other than what i have equipped
---
weren't the trees like $20 and people told Bethesda to go pound sand
---
That sounds about right! In which case, friend, carry on. Raid until your little (or big!) heart is content. :)
---
Have...have you been hunting *ghouls* this whole time?
---
To clarify the second shot only does 1/4 the damage so it would actually be 55 + 13.75
---
The explosive effect is only 20%
---
So in total you would do:
---
(55 + 11 explosive) + (13.75 + 2.75 explosive)
---
TSE got massively nerfed like 8 months ago
---
May the message of Mr. Fuzzy spread across all of Appalachia.
---
Sometimes that's EXACTLY what it feels like!
---
So I got a couple days to get some scrip
---
Oh... thats your scorched list. I thought we were listing our leggy hunting lists. 
---
No, Ive been launching triple nukes for the past couple of weeks.
---
People are so obsessed with Halloween, they really missed a good chance to make money, surprisingly enough.
---
Gotcha! Husband plays exclusively melee, so he wanted me to keep an eye out for twisted muscle serums, but not playing melee myself, I never really worried about the downside of it.
---
I only played Monster Mash once for about 20 minutes but it was really fun. Good way to farm legendaries too
---
Maybe they sell to other lowlevels?  ..but yeah, it's like browsing through hundreds of *known* plans
---
I just got an anti armor gatling laser with 50% damage in vats,  not sure if I should keep it or scrip it, the thing is  20 some pounds of weight..
---
Any idea what it would go for?
---
Agreed,  I'm not into holiday decorations myself.  But there's a reason all the stores shift to it a month early.  $$$$$
---
Thanks for being my guinea pig and trying it out! I have some rad-x to find and some diluted rad-x to make!
---
Correct
---
Lol I must be stealing your thunder then cause 3 quad explosives a quad ffr gamma and 2 junkies handmades in the last couple of weeks.  My bad bro, I will have a stern talk with her later tonight ;)
---
 \&gt;You could also add an auto leveling feature where the foundation of your camp &gt;reshapes the terrain i.e. a slope can be flattened out into a plane flat enough
---
IIRC, if you have enough concrete, it does exactly that....
---
So it works with all the other armor like X-01, T-60, etc. except Excavator without the plan?
---
Only a single machine needs power to have your Camp icon show on the map for others. Non Powered machines will still vend items. If none of the machines are powered your camp wont show on the map so cannot be fast traveled to. So customers would have to have stumbled onto the camp or know its location previously and walked to it.
---
Like 7 or 8 of them. Think they are for gov drops as well. Less stress on the game if they are already loaded and waiting to be called in.
---
Nuke zone is up there too!
---
Thank you, my fellow Wastelanders.
---
You could post the video here for us to see.
---
Haha! I don't know that I would have gone THAT far, but I'll take your word for it. Someplace to jump up to is my best chance, too. I have to get much to close with my shotgun, and it doesn't do NEARLY enough to damage to just stand there and fill that horrid sheep with lead...
---
nah it's cool, just thought you meant me is all
---
thx!
---
My dad is all about the screws, but there are so many different kinds that he never has more than a couple of each kind. It's usually enough for a small repair and not much else...
---
I'm a night owl anyway so it works fine
---
So my concern is that there is no way to know if an event is working properly. These things drop so rarely that it could be broken and we would never know. I love this game but its a bit glitchy. I haven't cracked a thousand hours yet but im around 700 and have never gotten one rare outfit from anything. I have gotten the fixer plan and the shielded raider underarmor so i know those work. With the exception of a friend finding the white fireman helmet in his inventory one day noone has gotten any of these outfits in months. Or ever. We could all be having not great luck. Or stuff could be broken. I would really like to know which.
---
Yeah, you are good. I would be more concerned about the drop from Murmrgh than getting scrip.
---
Haha that's awesome :P and yes please do, tell her to spread the wealth!
---
To your third point, many of the ground clutter objects do remove themselves when you are building.  You can even temporarily place foundation on the ground to remove them, and they're still gone when you delete the foundation (though I'm not 100% sure if that's permanent).  But some objects are not set to temporary, and those can't be removed - usually larger trees and rocks.
---
I feel bad for you man but this game has been broken since launch. Comes with the territory and all that.
---
you must be new. welcome
---
99% of people on whitesprings golf course have garbage. I think farming whitesprings has rotted their brain and they throw any old three star in their machines for a ton of caps. Next to the train station is good shopping. Golf course, don't bother.
---
I'm going to have to pay MUCH more attention to bubblegum! Thanks for the tip!
---
This is far from unique to "low levels."  I've seen 100+ levels with obnoxiously priced common items.
---
just found out about this. This mode was literally the only thing worth playing. This game is and always will be a fucking train wreck.
---
Can't see why a legal issue.  The short duration 25/50/75% platinum rebates that warframe randomly does are similar.  Morally sure it's iffy.  That said most microtrans and FtP stuff is gaming folks.
---
For what it's worth, I upvoted this, too. Sometimes humour is a bit of a lost art...
---
I think they are GIVING AWAY a bunch of Halloween themed stuff in the mischief night events.
---
NP.  I think chemist and super duper both work when making the diluted versions... although  I could be wrong on that one.
---
What makes you think no one has gotten any of these outfits in months?
---
It has diminishing returns. 1 piece for a value point is the biggest return. After 3 im pretty sure the number is very small. With 5 pieces my refresh from zero to full is only about 1 to 1.5 seconds longer then 3 pieces.
---
It still has effect.. But maybe something else could benefit you more.
---
I just want the damn greenhouse dome to return.  Seems like a great way to very quickly put down a camp that doesn't look like dogshit.  Didn't have the atoms at the time it was going.
---
What drop? U mean the discount
---
if they made hunter/hunted for 2 ppl, we could actually play it, haha
---
Well that blows. But most people seem to vendor out the same type stuff forever, so maybe you'll find them again and they will have similarly excellent gear!
---
If you're level 30 in a high level area trying to sell non-legendary items, you're wasting everyone's time.  No one is going to stop you, but your audience is elsewhere.
---
Similarly, if you're selling 3 star god tier stuff outside Vault 76, there's a good chance a lot of high level players won't ever visit  you.  I don't bother out there when I'm shopping (though I'm sure a few higher level players do, I'd just guess a lot fewer).
---
I wish they'd tried harder with their Responder stuff. Really hoping for another round of that at some point. Compared to what's available for BoS in game, plus Raiders and free states in the atom shop, the responder stuff is extremely lacking
---
I’ll post it on my profile
---
TS is a mediocre at best prefix, AA is one of the best.  Also, the TS has the broken (+250) 3rd star, so the AA is better in every way.
---
Thats good and serviceable tbh, my dad is a horder version of Sturges from fallout 4. That my sound cool and well it really is for me, but when the house and backyard is full of stuff you cant really walk freely... not so much so.
---
In which case, BGS should start giving out more atoms for challenges for pay as guide writers!
---
Oh no.. The discount is good. It's more like... You know. What she drops = What you get. I haven't had a decent buy from her ever.
---
TO summarize, everything has changed. 
---
You should go to bethesda's site to read up on everything you missed, there is too much to put in one post. 
---
You missed stash increases, the addition and subsequent disabling of PVP servers, Nuclear Winter battle royal mode, sheepsquatch quests, pioneer scouts quest and backpacks, player brewing, player vending, the burrows, legendary vendor, arktos pharma, no PVP slap damage for pacifists, vault raids, explosive nerfs, heavy and energy weapon buffs, durability buffs for heavies, cav sent and assassins nerfs, and a slew of other things that I forgot about already.
---
Another underrated is AWOL Armaments.  If you can stay in stealth on top of the truck while you kill Colonel Guty's with a ranged weapon it's a walk in the park.
---
Had a one, two, and three star legendary yesterday playing it solo.
---
I thought everyone just used Nukacrypt. Been using it since like 3 months after the games release.
---
I actually bought Far Harbor on the summer Steam sale... and barely touched it. I feel that it might be time for an intervention! For several of us. We have a problem!lol
---
I have too i jus threw out the low lvl because the last couple camps i stopped at were all around lvl 30 and 35. Your right almost everyone does it in one fashion or another
---
Ski poles from the ski resorts, Sunnytop and Top of the World.
---
Me and a friend did the surface to air event last night. We got the point where we camped out next to the fissure and killed the SBs before they even left the ground. We probably killed 20+ of them. It was a blast!
---
They're WORSE than the normal mask?? Dear god. Alright, so I am glad I passed on that one!!
---
Serendipity.
---
Don't you get one from completing the sheep squash quest line?
---
Not really .  There's a ton of high levels building camps around the vault because fast traveling there is free and you get both lower levels and higher levels around.
---
Why go through the trouble of making this shit up, or exaggerating so much? And not replying to comments is a red flag of a troll post.
---
I got a bomber jacket from a low level vender for 5 caps. So there is that.
---
I personally wouldn’t be open to being called a griefer, because you give griefers a good name. You’re punishing people who take advantage of questionable game mechanics, not impeding the gameplay of normal players.
---
I keep saying that TSE weapons suck, but nobody listens.  The good news is that most people falsely believe TSE is awesome, so you can sell them for a premium.  Get Anti Armor, Vampires, Instigating, Furious, Executioners, etc over TS.  
---
PS I’ve got a TSE Gauss Legacy for sale/trade!  It’s awesome!
---
I don't have chemist (I find so many stims, radaway and rad-x laying around, and I don't use anything else), but I DO have super duper and can confirm that it does double up!
---
My bloodied explosive .44 wont sell for 5k :(
---
Ski poles.
---
if you want a mine, then you need a workshop (Posiedon comes to mind)
---
DAMN SKIPPY!
---
I could see PvPers set up some camps/workshops with a bunch of locked stuff to farm the wanted level up with. Sounds way better than harassing pacifist players!
---
Yeah, I’m definitely leaning towards selling this thing.
---
I'll post pics tonite so you can see what I'm talking about.
---
If they price them for scrip junk, I'll buy them.  But yeah, not for 1k+.  You can keep them.
---
That is correct. It's been that way since it was first introduced in the atom shop.
---
Watch your step! Our house was a collection of jars, boxes, containers... all filled with random screws and bolts. I figure it's like collecting stamps. If you don't get it, you don't get it. But if you do, it's sublime. (I don't get it, personally.)

I'm glad I'm in the 1%!! I cant keep my vendors stocked. As fast as I get a few in, somebody needs to convert to scrip. 25 caps per scrip......all day....every day.
---
NP.  If he doesnt already have it, healing factor is a good one.  
---
Almost instantly restores full health as soon as nearby threats are eliminated.  Saves having to carry a lot of stimpacks :)  It does not remove radiation, so if needed, take a diluted radx before entering combat again.
---
Definitely switch the magazine.  They nerfed the drum magazine so that even stinging holds more ammo. 😳
---
Thanks! That would be great!
---
Bet that person who made front page yesterday crying about not being able to meet the deadline feels silly atm.
---
The challenge to find 3 pieces. There was someway to get it to count but i can't remember.
---
Maybe it's a certian silo?
---
Prepare for some long, rowdy queing at Murmurgrr...
---
Well now that Sony is allowing cross platform maybe one day we could explore Appalachia together :)
---
I have 1900 hrs and have never gotten any.😢
---
Pretty sure that’s isn’t anything Easter egg related
---
for full AP, you want the perforating mag.
---
Huh. Cool. I haven't seen that in the wild. Do you remember where it was? Looks like the Savage Divide, but that's a big place.
---
3* lvl 50 scout and combat armors. Multiple pieces for 200 caps or so. Latest bits let me upgrade 3 pieces to vanguard for ~600 caps 😎
---
Yeah it was a missle silo by the raider robots place.
---
Work it on the reddit Market; the value on that is above 5k when talking reddit. If you want it to sell in game though, drop it to 4k.
---
I joined reddit just to be a part of it! I got the game to play with my husband who now plays once in a blue moon. It's nice to have someone to nerd out about the game with sometimes.
---
OCTOBER 17-21
---
Is this like something someone made as a base camp?
---
Why didn’t I think to check the website?😂
---
IIRC, gas cans and tin cans both provide aluminum.  Various bots randomly drop aluminum, steel, or lead
---
Lucky hole mine is often mentioned when talking about various ore veins, although I don't use much of any of them so I don't really know if Lucky Hole is a good place to mine for Aluminium.
---
quite cool encounter i never seen or heard of it before 👍🏼
---
Thanks. I'll consider this next time I see a wanted player.
---
Still usually they've got sneaky sneaky friends
---
Seeing as the counter was only updated manually, I’d say the odds are pretty good.
---
he just did this same shit to me in another thread. he asked about discord then immediately talks shit saying he has better things to do than join a gamer group. what an insufferable jackass.
---
Is this also the secret to checking her off the tough enemies challenge? Or do you have to get the first hit, last hit, most damage, what?
---
I think it’s the final killing shot.
---
I tend to agree, but come on. Kill a specific spawn in a specific area, where the spawn us a wide variety of option= server hopping, obviously.
---
Imo implementing a system similar to the one used for tadpole/possum stuff would be nice. So for example you would get a limit of X ''Fasnacht ticket(s)'' per day when successfully completing the event, and there would be a Mr. Handy/Protectron vendor who would sell all the masks/plans/recipes available for Y tickets each.
---
Could also do it for things like Meat Week or other possible seasonal events like halloween/christmas/new year/etc.
---
No, its just a rare reward from it evidently...
---
I was trying to FT to vault 76 from my camp that is to the east of WS and I loaded in at three different spots before I finally ended up back at my camp. Didn't touch a thing, and couldn't make out where I was because it only flashed for a fraction of a second before the loading screen popped back up. I though I was on some Nukashine trip for a second.
---
TSE is way overrated. 
---
I main a bloodied lever, and my backup is a TSE handmade.  I only use the TSE handmade when I am doing fertile soil or like leveled events, because it just doesnt do damage.  Outside of Forest or Toxic Valley the handmade stays in my bag, because it doesnt have the beef behind it like it did 9 months ago.
---
My TSE also does in the 55dmg range per hit, where I can hit 1200 non crit damage with my lever using the same perks.
---
That actually sounds anout the right price. Theres alot of ppl who run bloodied builds. It prolly would sell quick for 4000 like this guy said
---
I love that this game means so many different things to so many people. For you, it's game time you don't have, but you can multitask. For some, it's a business sim. For others, it's an adventure/rpg (or whatever the box said). I read a post on here a couple of months back about someone who had a disability, and this game gave them a feeling of moving around freely like everyone else. It's a very special game that can mean so much to so many people for so many different reasons.
---
It should be Thursday at 9am PST.
---
I've heard about it in another thread a couple of weeks ago. It seems to be a random encounter. The other user claimed to have found the suit in the Toxic Valley, while you look like you're in the Savage Divide.
---
It's something that happens randomly, like running into Grahm and Chally. There are a few places throuhout the map, I think Mappalachia has them all pointed out, and if I'm not mistaken all events should be repeatable so it might pop up again sometime.
---
same here,  a full set of responder stuff would empty my bank account
---
you just asked what discord is then you completely reject the idea and call us people with no lives and say you have better things to do.. and here you are whining about not having trusted friends to play with? wow you really are a jackass
---
Thats a good question
---
weekly is to find 3 of em.. otherwise yeah we all use nukacrypt
---
I have that one and swear by it. I think he has a vampire something something right now that he can use in a pinch, but for me, it's ALL about the healing factor!
---
Yeah! It's right next to the whitesprings station. Its alittle small but they killed the theme
---
The borderlands numbers? I have that on but I don't remember what I get per shot of what. I'll write it down.
---
Australia, Africa, and South America.  But you'll need bauxite too.  Otherwise, just look for ski poles, like what was suggested.
---
Yeah i understand that and i mean i get it but there is a point where it just surpasses the healthy line. When i finally get enough to get my own apartment its gonna be plants🌱 
---
I just have to make sure they don’t suffocate me...
---
You know I thought exactly like this too when I started (about 2 months ago), I'm lvl 109 now I think, - I met a few guys recently that helped me understand vendor pricing and why exactly I see the prices I do (and without a doubt, some of the inflated prices are from players without a clue on what they're doing), they also made me realize I had gotten rid of some rather pricey equipment for cheap (most of us have), for example, I used to see weapons with an explosive effect for 10k too and though they're out of their minds.. no one is going to buy that! But if it's a 3\* Furious Explosive 50 Cal with 90% reduced weight?  Yeah.. there are players out there that will pay max caps and even more for that.
---
I was at the Purveyor with one of these guys, I told him what I just pulled, \^exactly what I just described but it was Bloodied.  He said I'll give you 25k for that right now (he was honest), ..didn't hesitate.  Ever since then, I've been making the kind of caps and selling stuff (10k to 15k depending on the item) on a regular basis.
---
On a footnote, went to a camp last night, guy had 6 weapons, he was low level- I thought to myself.. this is a waste of time to spend the caps traveling, ...but then I remember what one of these guys told me, he said; "don't count out a vendor because he's a low level, you never know", glad I remembered that, went to the guys camp and couldn't be happier I did.  Guy was selling a 3\* Assassin's Gauntlet, 50% limb, 90% reduced weight, ..... for 150 caps.  Felt like I was committing a crime at that price.
---
Vending has to be my favorite thing to do in the game right now, selling and finding items like the one I just mentioned above for 150 caps? LOL, I'm going to sell that for at least a few thousand, guaranteed.
---
I'm level 106 now.
---
I mean I got one from completing it so uhh your wrong
---
I take way too much damage to do a bloodied build, but yeah, I’m definitely looking for a new gun.
---
Is there any possible way you could link the thread or is it lost in time?
---
i think it is a paint, so you still need one
---
If you go to point pleasant you see them a lot there.
---
Thanks man. Most of all i want people to play with so i can learn couple things. I'll add you soon then.
---
Me neither
---
sweet i might at him JQUIC!
---
Spawns between the miners monument and fissure site too.
---
HEE HAW!!!
---
I did not say you had no lives.  I said I once used to belong to such a community and they ask to much of the casual gamer.  I said its not for me. 
---
You actually didnt describe what Discord was, you described your discord, which seemed to be a very well put together gaming group.  Those usually have requirements to be a part of, playtime is usually watched, scrutinized, and typically these types of communities ask you go out of your way to meet requirements.    No thank you.  Your singular community is not my cup of tea.
---
Following.
---
🚔🚓🚔🚓
---
It doesn’t weigh much so I don’t mind waiting in game. I’m just surprised how hard it is to find someone interested! Would rather sell in game vs reddit so I will just wait.
---
"Robot home defence" was one of the most popular settlement mods on the Fallout 4 nexus mod page, even after Automatron came out; so yeah, definitly something Bethesda should consider making in the future.
---
Have you thought about going the junkies route, its almost as effective.  You can spin junkies with a full health setup.  Its only slightly behind Bloodied right now, and far less perk intensive.
---
Haha, it depends on how I'm playing! Am I a super nice do-gooder who's willing to help everyone out/wanting to get 100% completion? Hell yeah, I'll play them all. Am I a jerk who just wants to get the job done or do I feel like there's a sense of urgency, i.e., the universe is gonna end if I don't complete the mission ASAP? Then hell no, I'm not searching for your missing pet bunny.
---
They've had that challenge before and it was bugged then also.
---
That’s too late tho, that event starts just two days before Halloween, it should’ve started a week before Halloween.
---
I think plants are supposed to have the opposite effect... They DO make excellent roommates!
---
By ban it from events do you mean not allow people to use it in events, or temporarily take it out of the game with the intention of giving it back once it is fixed? Each requires a different path. I'll go super high level....
---
The former would require checking each player inventory upon entering an event, specifically looking for pieces matching whatever type. Assuming that didn't introduce its own lag whenever somebody entered an event, also assuming they didn't botch the iterative process to do so, several decisions would have to be made:
---
* Don't allow player to enter the event: How? rubberband them? Teleport them somewhere? Meeting required, decisions to be made, code implemented. High probability of introducing a bug that teleports somebody into Fallout 4 on accident.
---
* Unequip armor: Okay maybe just a function call client side to trigger an exit power armor event. We certainly haven't seen this done forcefully from the server so some new command would have to be written and handling added to the client. Once released, assuming it works, bet you it takes under 12 hours for somebody with a packet sniffer and hex editor to figure out the exact offset of that call on the client side and jmp over it so they can wear their armor in the event anyway. Want to prevent that? More code.....
---
The latter is an interesting approach that would no doubt result in a lot of player crying. We have already seen their efforts to mass edit inventories, specifically power armor. It didn't go well at all, and in this case we would be asking them to do it twice. 
---
Meanwhile.....the freezing issues are probably complex indeed, but I think speculations made by others about what is going on are likely correct. Something about the particle effects is just too much. Even stuff that worked fine before is causing these same hiccups, for example a regular laser rifle with a beam splitter. It is likely that something rendering the effects is looping or recursing way more times in way faster succession than practical. 
---
What I really think is the case is they are heads down working on Wastelanders desperately trying to deliver without letting another vaguely communicated date slip and they just aren't looking at stuff like this. I'm sure it is on their todo list.....somewhere.
---
Just normal level cringe right not like wiafuu neckbeard level though right?
---
Your prices are fine. As for stuff for high level players, acid acid acid. Everyone loves acid. Adhesive too at times, but mostly acid. You sell that bulk acid and watch it disappear in the blink of an eye. After a hard day's work expending 10k 50 cal ammo at Scorchbeast Queen, there's nothing quite like bulk acid to smelt that lead ore to a high level player.
---
As someone who digs out their Halloween decorations on the first of October, having to wait until the end of the month (when it's pretty much over) is just so sad. What's the point of decorating when the holiday will be gone and done?
---
Oh sorry, didn't know it was a challenge.
---
Sold mine for 500 caps last week. Had no idea, so thanks for the info. Have another for sale for 12000 now. Xbox, Blackhat1861 down by Watoga.
---
I found a responder fire outfit for 50 caps... I’d have to agree it’s helpful sometimes lol
---
Thursday.
---
If by easier you mean you don't have to find/learn the plan to craft it, yes.
---
yikes
---
It should have started in the last week of September really.
---
Under the hood, it's any apparel piece with the appropriate keyword designating it as a costume. Based on datamines, there will be an optional objective during the Meat Week event that confirms whether or not you're currently wearing an applicable costume, and Bethesda has confirmed in comments that in the patch before the event starts they'll be adding the costume keyword to several more apparel pieces.
---
I read a couple of years ago someone had a lot of plants in he’s room and actually ended up dying of suffocation at night thanks to it so yeaaaaaah. I think of it every time i got a new plant jaja
---
Not just Fixer and Bear Arm. Crook, Staff, and Club from the Free Range event too
---
It *feels* about as real as getting handmades more often because I have a bunch of handmades in my stash, but I'm betting it's really just random...
---
I've had it multiple times where I can't place the base but, find some weird rotation where I can place it and have trees, foliage, ground running through part of my base.
---
You poor thing! That sucks! Well, we all appreciate you going to bat for the team. (Pun was an accident, but I'm leaving it there. Live with it.)

Um. No

What's your IG so people can come check it out?  
---
I miss my what I assumed got me banned maze 5 stories 96 block foundation 100s of walls lights traps and other gimmicks through out. This was back when the camps could glitch and you kept getting build budget. People on the original xbox would crash S and X would just slow to a crawl till it was 100% loaded in.  whitespring behind the shops on the green for those that stopped by and remember it.  
---
I was banned the day after I decided to move it to scrap and it literally broke my game.  Now I play fair and clean on my other account.
---
West of deathclaw island and north of there I see a few
---
Of the 3 drops it seems like 60% hardened mass, 35% glowing mass, 5% HRF! I collect from about 8 people,  same for all of us.
---
i quit using mine and switched to an Instigating non-explosive. perfect for WS when it’s nuked, even in hazmat.
---
lol That bunny might need you!

General, another bunny needs your help!

I've been mostly unactive this past month due to being busy irl, so I found it fairly easily, [Here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d7b8ie/to_the_edge_of_the_map/f0yte4h?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
I remembered that because there's my comment there saying "If a frame has more than three pieces, it was most likely dropped by a player". Was I wrong, damn.
---
Yeah, I am thinking it is just superstition. Theres also the concept that if you have a bunch of Vanguards sentinel gear or handmades, those items drop more often. I'm sure it's just random as our cognitive biases tend to skew the evidences
---
you better be careful using logic and reasoning,  fanboys hate that one simple trick
---
Good on you! Don't lose heart on your academic pursuits. We'll still be here grinding away at the Scorchbeast Queen, give a holler if you need anything!
---
TSE is very overrated.  Your executioners looks like it does more damage, because it does do more damage when the enemies get low.  You are looking at +50% dmg on injured targets (40 from exe and 10 from aiming) vs the +20% from the TSE (20 from explosive, and I dont count the second shot because it usually misses unless you are right on top of something)
---
I also have a TSE lever, that I retired when I got a different modifier.  TSE used to be god mode, now they are at the bottom of the effectiveness list.
---
I would put the TSE up for trade and pick up an AAE, BE, VE or JE instead.
---
*Looks at guy through binoculars*
---
*Finger guns*

*The ground around them erupts in fire and they are flung 50ft into the air*

Seriously?? But... they use carbon dioxide to make air. How can that be a thing? According to everything I learned in science class (a long long time ago in a galaxy far far away), this should be impossible...

and dont forget the communicable diseases!

Anyone on Xbox have a fixer plan for sale?

I was thinking more of a [Gene Simmons - Haunted House](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoO4rJjQWjI)

That might get just as old. Super mutants are not typically well spoken. A radio station hosted by Strong would have been awful. The odd moo for punctuation might extend its its lifetime, though... Hmm

My dmg on mine is 274.

Because mobs have a Damage Resistance rating.

---
See you guys online for the sale!
---
ALL THE ARMORS!!!
---
I run hybrid single shot rifles and heavy guns, even with maxed rifleman, tank killer and explosive expert it does only slightly over the resolute veteran unique gattling gun but at like 1/3 the fire rate and a 50 times smaller magazine. Tested on a scorchbeast and super mutants
---
Sad and true. Best we can do is ignore all those poor souls who don't know how to have fun!
---
Most of us do that. You can also 'feel' their level most of the time because of what they have to offer. 
---
However, since some people use mules and others play five different characters at the same time (like I do) a level 54 can be offering a bloodied lightweight hunting rifle for 3000 caps, or an anti-armor lever action for 500. 
---
I do. 
---
If you try your luck, vending machines are worth fast traveling. 
---
It is part of the fun.
---
Furry Nite... We must send an attack group immediately!
---
i noticed awhile back i wasn’t getting the same damage and was missing more shots than usual. that two-shot isn’t so great when ranged i guess.
---
We should be able to farm almost every plant, flower and fungus in the game. It makes zero sense to randomly reatrict us to the same types of crops available in 4.
---
Terraforming terrain on small scales would be extremely useful for most objects, I'd love it if they make it a thing.
---
Edit: my brain farted and I made two different comments. Fixed it.
---
Good shout going for Armor more rolls of the dice
---
I ahve to admit, I now have over 9 different lever action rifles on my rifle build toon, and the TSE is horrible for accuracy
---
i switched to an instigating one and the difference is huge
---
I know! For all i reaserched that just cant be plausible and the legitimacy of the news article and it claims never got heavy scientific confirmation at the time but even if i know that i still think about it xD
---
Yup on Ps4 this weekend it happened twice, I could tell it happened to other players too as they also did the angry and confused emotes
---
and i was using a prime unyielding bloodied anti armor gatling plasma and was melting the health right off the queen so i know it wasnt not enough damage
---
You must be mistaken, or you have one of the best bugs ever!
---
I pick them up anyway the beeping really gets on my nerves.
---
Weapons are way easier to find than armors.  Way more player vendors stock weapons than armor, so the hard to find armors are more elusive than the hard to find weapons (legacy excluded)
---
Yeah I've has this issue with this challenge before. I wonder if it technically works if you do something very specific.
---
Gladly man, hope to maybe buy something.
---
Same, but my 160 gatling gun with no armor penetrating perks (lever gun has full tank killer) does pretty much the same damage
---
Same here. If they've got good prices on low level items, even on stuff you can get off any scorched you shoot at, I'll nab it just to scrap it for mods and materials.
---
I think the 2* ranged weapon purchase is the smartest, but 3* is pretty close.  It depends on if you are the type of guy who only tries to hit home runs, or if you just want a base hit. I never buy anything beside ranged weapons from the Purveyor.
---
My tse lever action rifle is hanging on my wall at my camp.  That's how useful I think it is.
---
Funny thing is I used it all the time until I found a a 3* instigating +10% damage while aiming handmade.
---
I have had like  147 white wolf fedoras. It’s really all I seem to get. :/
---
Thanks for clarify friend, I appreciate that.
---
I think is better that the own devs do a event like this more than just the people with its camps.
---
I played with music off and I completely forgot I didn’t have it on for like 2 days
---
I'm a cannibal, if you don't want her in your pantry, I'll take it
---
It must have scared you in a nice, confusing way.
---
You want an Instigating Lever, TSE is pretty bad.  If you are on the PC, I have several Instigating Levers I could offer you.
---
I don't see mention of the time it starts on Thursday, am I missing something?
---
My lever is my goto with my rifleman, but as others have said already TSE is not ideal for maxing out its capabilities. For the longest time I ran instigating with adrenal reaction and 50% health and it was awesome. It could kill max level legendary Super Mutants in one shot. Anything tougher required switching to the handmade to unleash a wall of explosive bullets, burning more ammo but dishing out higher overall dps.
---
Then I hit the jackpot, I got a bloodied lever with limb damage. Running 40% health the damage is near on par with the first shot from the instigating, with the added benefit of getting the same damage each shot. Run lower than 40% health and it just keeps getting better and better. Add sneak, covert op, mr sandman and 3.5k hits are not uncommon.
---
i've got 4580 atoms burning a hole in my pocket for halloween stuff...
---
why are you holding out on us bethesda?
---
This is it exactly.  The TSEs suffer after about 40 feet, the second shot rarely lands on target unless you are shooting something huge  like a hermit crab.  
---
I still keep my TSE lever because of the nostalgia (it was my first 3\* weapon back when I just hit 50), but I never use it.
---
I'll be server hopping to see what prefixes drop and keep my limit at around 850 til I find some good rolls of mobs.
---
It's probably about as effective as spamming the A button for a higher catch rate in Pokémon.
---
wow game breaking lets forget about all the game breaking bugs that actually matter and totally rally on the animation bugs you find so game breaking LOOK EVERYONE he has something super important to bring up
---
Fort defiance. Picking up all the surgical trays in the building.

Update. Mis-read the mining part
---
I know why the vault boy mads
---
I scrip any that are junk, so I don't have any of those in my vendor. The ones I do have in my vendor are ones I know people want and I sell them at 1,000 caps per star at a max of 3,000 caps. Unless it's a god tier legendary, but then the maximum I'll sell those for is 5,000.
---
You had much success with this in the past? I know some servers seem to spawn much more legendary mobs but never thought about what prefixes drop
---
I like the tires, they stack in fun ways [like so](https://i.imgur.com/42o9qWq.jpg)
---
lol wtf
---
Maybe it's just my market, but neither low level players nor people who worry about the cost of fast travel are necessarily going to be your better customers.
---
But I'll take a look, maybe there's more there for me than I have seen in the past, can't hurt to take a peek or two.
---
Hello, can you help me with the raids on ps4?
---
I had the atoms, just didn't realize it was such a short time item. u/Ladydevann any chance the dome will return soon?
---
If you have the right build a 1* Instigating Lever will hit for 2K a shot. That will one shot nearly every enemy in the game. The Gatling is as good as it gets with a heavy gun for 1-shotting, but it’s not nearly as strong as a Lever, day-to-day.  Obviously,  a long fight the heavy build is much stronger than the Instigating Lever build. I play both builds.  I’d recommend the Instigating (or bloodied) sniper over the heavy build for most people because it’s just more efficient.  Heavy is very strong, but you blow through a lot of ammo to do the same thing.  Both are fun.
---
Two shot is a pretty bad prefix.
---
same
---
I just know that I roll sentinel assassin pieces if I switch to my sa armor. Or I get more bloodied rolls if I switch back and forth between several bloodied weapons etc. I bet many people will tell you that if they're rolling one type of thing, say Mutant's, their friend will also roll Mutant's, etc. And also if you roll one type of prefix at Mummbles she will roll several of that prefix. I've never gotten more than 5 different majors when rolling 1000 scrip. Always the same few. So I learned by trial and error, if you roll an AAFFR piece and then hit Mummbles you have a better chance at more AA/AAFFR or explosive pieces.
---
And one more thing... anyone remember when iTunes had to introduce a derandomizer to it's code because people would say that the same things would play often or back to back? Random is kinda weird on a computer.
---
My only issue with this is, some of the masks never dropped. There isnt a single skull, jester, or goblin on xbox. And i want that skull mask... soooo bad. Lol

Anywhere with a mutant.

you asked if discord was like teamspeak or ventrilo and I said yes. does that not answer your question? again, just because my discord has ranks doesnt mean we are a "hardcore" guild that has requirements asked of the members. Half the people in the server arent even "official" fever clan members. as you can see, we are open invite and very casual. if you want a "hardcore" discord group, join the brotherhood of steel RP group, thats probably the type of server you are thinking of, they give missions for their members and have requirements. my group simply rewards you a better title in the discord if you lead events like running the SBQ. nobody is here saying "its your job to run the silo on tuesday" thats not how it works, we are casuals.

If their gear is cheap I will buy it to scrap and unlock mods if low on resources or don’t have the plans to make them
---
Browse the trading sub. You can pick it up pretty fast. There’s only a few acronyms that get used a lot. In this case:
---
AA: Anti armor
---
E: Explosive
---
RW: Reduced Weight
---
DE: Demo expert (I’m assuming as this isn’t a common one) 
---
F: Furious DRWA: Damage resist while aiming
---
Hahaha that’s a good one! Yeah... I mean I have almost everything from that event, it’s just that every time I replay it that’s all I get now. I never got the imposter helmet until I bought one at a players vendor.
---
Super mutants frequently carry energy weapons.
---
Put those three points there. It works great with cheap ammo, because your average silenced 10mm or 38 Pipe can take headshots and go 'miss, miss, CRITICAL, CRITICAL, CRITICAL, CRITICAL..." and kill very high level enemies. 
---
My commando takes a 38 auto Fixer to some scorched Earth events. Two short bursts kill most enemies.
---
Bloodied is pretty much a no for me, as OP is it is i can’t be bothered to fully optimise armour, power armour and perks. I like my flat damage buffs with no strings attached
---
Some. They usually drop several prefixes so it's still a big roll of the dice but I've had some luck. The odds are still pretty low as it only seems to drop the same prefix 10-20% after about 5 rolls.
---
I built over a nearly dried up pond south of autumn acre cabin but it's a spawn point so i have to repair it nearly everytime I'm there.
---
You just say “I don’t have one” and it’ll still work. They will refund you the 800 atoms and allow you to keep the outfit.
---
West Tek, best place to find copious amounts of laser rifles. 
---
About half the muties there carry lasers, the other half assault rifles. 
---
Great place to get steel too (from all the scrappings)
---
Okie dokie.
---
Literally just got my hands on the fixer plan.
---
15000 caps well spent. Lol
---
Ha!  I had a guy do that one night.  Came into the club and chucked nades at me in the DJ booth.  I messaged him and said thanks for the pyrotechnics.  It was much appreciated!
---
General steakhouse, the penitentiary (lower levels), WestTek, Harpers Ferry, Grafton Steel, Path to Enlightenment Public Event. Etc.
---
Just to add to the pile: my crops are easily accessible, and my water isn’t locked, and that’s by design. 
---
While I myself don’t take unlocked water from others’ CAMPs (because I always have plenty), I’m fine if people take it from mine. I don’t even care if you sell it; Industrial purifiers refill so quickly it’ll probably be full again by the time I get back to my camp.
---
So people are supposed to not continue their faithful following of the Fallout franchise if they are not into PvP interactions?
---
Its not like every other Fallout game has been single player before it so there is no way it has built a decent following of people that prefer playing solo right?
---
I will hit 1000 today
---
^^ What this guy said
---
It doesn’t work for everyone. I’ve tried everything and I can’t get sludge lung to register.
---
I didn’t have any issues with any other diseases.
---
This is really relevant to OP's post.
---
There was a bug with some urban scout pieces prior to a previous patch where some pieces damage resistances were lower than forest. That was fixed and all scout armor has only one type just like marine and trapper.
---
Sludge lung doesn’t register for a lot of people, myself included
---
hey i have a question  about  
---
# Outcasts and Remnants Mod 
---
when i played this mod from a new start since then i have  started a new game this is my 6th time 
---
any ways now the part where Preston must pay  after you get the intl from the bunker 
---
this never happen before but this time i kick his ass then that pop up comes up explaining about if you kill him off stuff well after i click OK  then the mission completes then he gets up and yells for the commonwealth 
---
i got this than he starts shooting the traders and that one gull guy the one at the being of the game  vault tek rep you find at  Good Neighbor later on so now i had to kill off Garvey this time around is this normal ?
---
Or they can just not claim workshops in fo76. It's pretty simple really
---
How long has it been since you defraged?
---
Yepp. Maxing all 5 of my toons on scrip wasnt for nothing. Time to hit that purveyor for everything shes worth.
---
She comes in from the west , try hanging out on east side of event to start, she will aggro on someone over there first,🤗
---
Did we do campfire yesterday on XBox, your name is very familiar.  Its a hard one to forget
---
1k each on my two high level characters.
---
i showed up at the last moment to one yesterday. (xbox)
---
Problem is some people are toooooo pvp oriented and my builds are roleplayed builds. It Is not fun when your rival wears optimal armor and optimal weapons and perks for killing you and you walk around wearing hooded rags like Cricket or invest perk points in qol.
---
Barbarian also doesn't work in pa.
---
Well since I don’t know what that means, I’m gonna say never haha
---
I should have mentioned I play on PS4.
---
Quest List - Investigate the suspicious person 
---
"She's dead,  Jim"  🤔
---
Did you happen to leave a sign out on your front lawn saying, "Dead Broad Storage"?
---
Seek out the instigating. I think you will like it.
---
Yeah, I understand, it DOES feel like that is the case, but we'd have to see some actual data from items collected. As it is now I'm lucky to just get a 3* item off a 3* mob, so purveyor is pretty nice for making them guaranteed available!
---
As for the entire concept of random, there truly is no such thing. People use the word sometimes to even mean "unexpected", but true random does not exist except perhaps in the quantum realm. I don't want to get too in-depth in a fallout subreddit about it, but "computer random" is some form of modulus on the number of seconds since 1/1/1970 and it is put into a function to get the results. So it's hard to say but maybe they put some seeds into the character to weigh in more heavily on certain item prefixes than others or it IS based on luck stat somehow or all of the above.
---
class freak 3 which is 75%....
---
you literally are bashing me, you made comparisons like having real life friends and looked down your nose at a "gamer group" and implied its for people with no lives or hobbies. yet here you are nerding out on reddit to optimize your fallout build and you are so nasty to people in the comments you had to delete your own post. I should have looked further before offering an invite, you are total loser thats just looking to argue with people.
---
I hope so never bought atoms so its weeks worth of work thanks
---
I’ll take you up on that!  I’m AlmaxMere in game.
---
Ok I’ll get on in a bit.  I know I have several ranging from a basic Instigating to an Instigating Faster Fire Rate.  
---
IGN LordZarak
---
yes try this you will lose your pics but go to the game save data and clear the reserverd space file
---
I'll be at 1000 by tomorrow, with about 20 weapons/armor in storage for reserve scrip.
---
There is a "rebuild database" option in the safety menu.  Itll free up space and maybe solve some of your issues.
---
Ok thanks I'll give it a go, be gutted to lose my loading screens but it's a worthy sacrifice lol
---
Nice, what is the majority of the stars?
---
Yeah, I try to concern myself with getting the legendary effects I want rather than the DR/ER stuff
---
I've done monster mash a bunch of times but never have I seen hunter hunted have more than 1/4 people
---
I’m a little late to this discussion.... just to be clear, you are saying it’s pointless to have dodgy and serendipity equipped at the same time? If having both equipped at the same time, only ONE will work? So it’s impossible for say dodgy to proc first then serendipity after?
---
Thought so.
---
Ok, thank you! I’ll look into it right now
---
3800 and counting
---
I’m in the same situation
---
That makes sense, and thanks explaining the few here!
---
But higher int is so good to you. Better scrap from weapons armor, more chance at learning mods, more durability when crafting, easier hacking guesses, higher exp. For me gunsmith is for most simple adventuring, then trade out for, nerd rage or better healing, stabilized, or fusionn cores last longer for sbq or project Paradise, ect.
---
With Charisma, I think you can have one chem effect, and one food effect active at a time. You can also have a bobblehead and/or armor bonuses contributing. In your example, the Daytripper replaced the Grape Mentats effect. Next time wash those grape mentats down with a beer!
---
Well, it depends on what college you went to. For me, Purdue would be the best place to find some alumna.
---
It feels like every time u get a stalkers pole hook with limb damage. But I’ve only ever gotten 1 good item.
---
perhaps
---
and yes, now I am bashing you, because you cant get it through your thick skull that I dont want to be a part of your gamer group with too many people
---
Some of us are loners, and like that lifestyle.   Trying to justify that you dont have requirements when for the last 25 years every guilld or group I have been a part of with more than 1 member has had requirements for joining and staying.  I dont do the bait and switch, and it sounds like you are trying to justify your little clan to someone that doesnt want to be a part of it.  Its my choice, stop trying to sell me on it.  I am only going to get nastier.
---
How do you get more than 4 vendor machines? Not that I want any more but seen a camp last night with 12 on Xbox. All placed beside each other
---
What platform do you do raids on cause I need help doing them on ps4?
---
Bethesda hit rid of it
---
5k
---
I’m way late to this thread too, but I still don’t understand how dodgy and serendipity can’t/won’t work if both equipped. I have full sentinel assassin armor, dodgy and serendipity, with dr over 300 and I still get mowed down in just a few shots. I don’t get it.
---
I think that's the most I've heard
---
What about some Monster masks like the Monster Smash one in the Atomic Shop? Like one with Waggis Icon colors maybe and other variants
---
I love 76 btw I'm going to die tomorrow now give upvote
---
I thought I was crazy because some legendary mirelurk king killed me about 3 times... I was thinking to myself I must have been missing something because I couldn't understand how it would kill me so fast in power armour with max health and psychotats when the Mirelurk Queen does relatively minor damage.
---
sounds like you are butthurt that your friends dont play anymore so you have to ask for tips on builds through reddit and you lash out at the very people offering advice.
---
who hurt you?
---
Yeah I was curious about this myself. Still going to wear plague doctor and hope for the best.
---
I feel like you get more bang for you buck out of grim reape Sprint(?), each hit in vats has a chance to fill AP.
---
Ok, just read a quick article on the rationale of doing this periodically and how to do it on PS4 and am currently doing it.  I appreciate the info guiding me in the right direction, i’d never heard of this before.
---
So, to clarify, if I have 0 jet pack plans and I buy this one, I can craft it?
---
Trying to buy the fixer plan most I can do atm is 7500. Ps4 GenomeNinja
---
You legend!! Up n running once again
---
nice i'm glad that helped i hate you had to sacrafice your screenshots
---
No worries.  Hope it helps.
---
yeah that's a fair outlook.
---
That said though there are still a lot of off meta items that might appeal to an endgame player for whatever reason but not have wide appeal.
---
EX: I spent over 15k on 3 weapons with 50% crit bonus as I have a build that can use them, I'm sure plenty of other endgame players passed them by due to not having ffr or explosive as the secondary effect.
---
I try to stock my own vendor with items for that 40-150 group though.  Good items that are likely a strong upgrade for someone just getting a build together or with only a basic 1*, but nothing that would replace that god tier BE fixer or what have you :P
---
I don't sell a lot but my average sale is prolly around 2k caps as a result.
---
Nope.  You need the plan for the specific power armor type first, then you will have the option to build the normal version or two different free state versions.
---
Have 150 of each flux, my mule is crying...
---
If you had followed the thread you would have seen that not everyone who commented was an ass like you and I actually  had an intelligent conversation with someone who did offer advice and didnt jump to the conclusion that explaination of my build was not me bashing advice, it was providing more insight into my perk selections. 
---
But you are unable to have an intelligent conversation, just like many entitled assholes of today, and automatically take the defensive. 
---
Im sorry that I dont write like Charles Dickens, im not a writer.  Im sorry that I dont use words that adhere to your fragile sensibilities, but thats not me. 
---
I say it like it is.  You ask me why I took a perk, so I explain it. this is not being an ass, this is answering a fucking question.
---
Looks like I need to get addicted to Bufftats
---
For each season I get a shot or two from each bit of DLC so my loading screens would be 'Wild Appalachia' or 'Nuclear Winter' themed, sad to see em go. At least I had saved a lot of them onto the console as well so they aren't gone forever.
---
Same here, only fairly recent, got it done with firstb3 toons..
---
3* . I've been exchanging all my 1* and 2* drops.
---
psychotats, +25% dmg
---
Got it, that’s what I figured. Thanks
---
unfortunately im on the xbox
---
Who needs 40 scrap kits on one character?!?! I mean honestly, thats 40 less pounds i can carry/stash. If they were evenly spread through your characters, thatd be differnt.
---
Second that. I had fought a legendary ant two days ago that just outright murdered me after one or two hits. The poison DoT was so insane even stims couldn't deal with it.
---
Exactly. I am really looking for those plans
---
MORE TIRES!!!!
---
I need help on ps4 with these raids on expert
---
Does that mean it's only happening on PC?
---
TS is bullshit when you need accuracy and explosive makes weapons break even faster.
---
Someone has too much time on their hands. Lol.
---
Ummm can I to please buy a fixer plan? I'm on ps4
---
MY1SIN
---
...
---
🥺
---
Who hurt you?
---
And it's more fun than looking at your most recent picture over and over
---
My plan exactly.  3-4 weapons.  If they are all crap prefixes: hop.  1 or even 2 good ones, I’ll do 3-4 more and re-evaluate.
---
I can see that but I guess my point is you can approach this game in any number of ways and there's no right way.  
---
You can easily have endgame armor underneath that hooded rags outfit.  You can easily swap in some offense/defense perks to run a pvp event and then swap back to qol perks later.  
---
The only thing that is forcing you to dogmatically adopt the rp approach to the game is yourself.  You can just as easily say "I'm going to try to kick some pvp ass in monster mash RAWR!!!!!" and then just go back to being a peaceful roleplayer afterward :)  
---
It's just a new way to enjoy the same game from a different perspective.  Or don't, the choice is yours and so long as you are having fun more power to you! :)
---
Wrong, it's just paint
---
90% is max weight redux for the armor legendary effects. It seems like theres been a question or two a day about this lately
---
Wes Tek to Huntsville.
---
They still count as Scorched
---
here's an article that provides a decent overview, happy gaming!

---
Don’t forget, you get scrip from dailies now. If you crank those out every day you can get quite a bit.
---
Agreed, but am a stickler for the full 500, so I still cook and sell glowing meat steaks, plus any extra scrap( aluminum and black titanium after looting every mole miner in uranium fever). Only 3 more recipes, the crappy ones lol.
---
Check with the guys hanging out behind your local library if you want acid. I'm not sure about gunpowder.
---
Super mutants probably?
---
Nothing in this game is polished. Lol, but I love it lmao
---
Huh I only just realised this too reading your post.
---
Yes! I have fought in fists only fights on xbox several times. These guys made a big floating arena with lots of spots to fall off. Everyone had to be butt naked and use fists. Remove all combat related perks (honor system)
---
They should have also had everyone rad x before the fight so theres no mutation advantage
---
I'd sell from anywhere to 1500-2k if it's a max lvl 3star
---
Reading about experiences like this is awesome.
---
Didnt know +250 was broken. Thanks for letting me know. That sucks. Itd be a good idea for tank builds.
---
I can't believe I'm lvl 181 and have Not gotten a single TSE drop. I just haven't felt like buying one for the crazy prices the sell for. 1000 scrip and I'm expecting to get a shitload of useless ass broadsiders.....
---
17,000.  I'm ready 👍
---
Amazing, sounds like a blast
---
How much do those give didn't know that
---
Chameleon and vanguard can not be on the same piece as they are both primary effects
---
How long did it take you to get 17k?
---
I get not fixing the established 3D models on stuff like the cooking stove we have, but why create new models that look bad and falling apart?  If I can build a freaking fusion reactor with nothing falling off, I sure as hell would build my fridge and stove with nothing falling off.  Making the new fridge model be intentionally broken is just dumb.
---
A-jump X-interact Y-reload B-Pipboy, that's how I've been playing since Fallout 3, I don't remember what I've used for PC though, it's been a while since I've had one
---
This is new to me... which dailies can you get scrip from?
---
TS auto does have horrible accuracy for the second shot but not the primary shot. I have a ts glatling with beam splitter. The accuracy is horrible. It looks like a wall of green rain.
---
Because Beth really, **really** wants us to be raiders.  Their grand social experiment was eluded to in interviews before F76 even dropped.    
---
¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Started when the challenge was announced a couple of months ago now I think.  5 accounts on 2 xboxes.  Can't wait for the string of nocturnal bashing weapons it'll produce 🤨
---
I see a legal issue before a moral one, TBH.
---
Say Bethesda was off by a few thousand and didn't award the discount, someone is gonna cause an uproar enough to somehow figure out their calculations were off. Could put them in murky water as far as every person who purchased atoms while the sale should have occurred, there's potentially damages to a mob of people already out for Bethesda blood,  they might have a helluva time fighting that off. 
---
But I also don't know shit as far as other games, so if it's industry norm, they've absolutely put checks and balances in place to ensure there is no way for potential liability.
---
But I don't think that's a price Bethesda is willing to pay or a risk their willing to take at the moment, because that backlash would be fucking rabid even if they were to somehow escape all legal costs.
---
not much at all really.. I spent some on 25% off
---
1100 between 2 toons.. 500 + 600
---
On one character it would take 114 days. Be proud
---
Do you know where I need to go or what i need to do in order to find players on ps4 to help with expert raids?
---
Path seems mutant free sadly others are spot on.  Also that lumber yard in NW corner is always mutants but may be too low to drop energy weapons.
---
Definitely would like a “taunt” ability or healer type ability’s to even out the play styles
---
I think all of them except the scout ones.
---
Yeah, I had to jump a couple of times. Damn healing factor serum. But yep, I’d say good intentions count.
---
TAUNT thank you! I couldnt remeber the world for the life of me
---
I’ve seen them range from 3-8. You get more for harder areas.
---
I made a female char just to rock the Mistress of Mystery gear since its a stealth sniper build.
---
TS is problematic on weapons outside of close range since the other shot misses a lot and TSE breaks incredibly often.
---
Makes sense. Their last Fo4 DLC was a giant amusement park that the good content was only raiders and killing all your hard work settlements from the main area. Thank goodness for Kinggath's settlement mods. haha
---
Ok so go ahead and go with that anti-Free States garbage. But yes, I want somebBetter Responder stuff too. They really phoned that one in.
---
Server hop
---
I am in a similar situation. Still play a bit on the weekends for an hour or two, but mostly I hang in my camp, listening to the radio, while I do my calculus and physics homework.
---
Look into replacing your factory hard drive with a solid state drive. Dramatically improves load times, so anytime your console needs to load an asset from memory into RAM it'll be faster.
---
Have a rainforest in your apartment, friend. I am absolutely confident that you will be fine.
---
Do you really think I didn’t server hop?
---
Not true. I have done this multiple times solo with a very high level bloodied commando and it does not fill any faster. I one hit everything in there once adrenaline kicks in. Doesn't fill any faster and doesn't work that way. Waves spawn in normally and it never completes at 100% any more.
---
I wish when you scrolled over their camp it would tell you what level they are, because it does get a bit annoying going there and it's nothing of use for me or other higher levels, I'll still buy something, if its reasonably priced
---
Holding a harpoon gun in third person makes your character rubberband sometimes.
---
Lucky Hole has lead and crystal, so no, that won't work.
---
You said "anymore." So you're saying it's bugged? Hmm, pretty sure I had it full up recently. Also I think you can one shot everything without Adrenaline lol
---
I kill everything that comes at me, but i could swear that players have said that the bosses need time to turn into legendaries? I don't know how true this is, i know when I've done it I've always gotten 3 legendaries out of that event.
---
I don’t mean to sound anti free states, like the first comment said, but glad to hear you agree
---
It takes new players awhile to figure out pricing and what sells.  It is just part of it.
---
I have about 450. Building back up from the last sale.
---
No problem hope you get it sorted out :)
---
I think you might be over playing it some
---
Charleston has quite a few. In the hornwright building there are filing cabnit that spawn typewriters. Along with all the offices that have typewriters and desk fans. Then leave out the top floor and cross to the other building and work your way down.
---
Lvl 1 lockpick and low lvl enemies and i come away with 11 or 12 every time. Takes almost no time at all now. I used this in my early game everytime i logged on and they stack up.
---
Alright, I’ll be sure to try it. Thanks!
---
Once you reload it stops the prefix from working until you swap weapons.  Reloading while crouched apparently stops that from happening, I have not tested that since I rid my self of all of them before I was aware.
---
530ish 😕
---
Earlier stages of the game, back around December or January of last year it would fill to 100% completion if all extractors stayed up and running. Since about February or March it hasn't filled to 100%. Definitely something was changed in how it calculates.
---
You're right, but I'mm not talking about the Legendaries, I'm talking about filling up the bar faster for better loot rewards. Namely the Shielded Raider plans
---
Office building with desk fans, wendigos
---
Why do you think someone hurt me. 
---
Also, I am done conversing with you. 
---
I just took a look at your post history, and to call me an asshole is the pot calling the kettle black.  
---
You have far more posts full of insults, downtalking, vitriol and hate than I will ever have.  
---
You are a disturbed angry person sir, and I no longer care to converse.
---
Which office building?
---
Path to enlightenment at the palace should have mutants. My bad for not clarifying.
---
There is a short timers on "mutated" legendaries.  So your typical spawn that mutates. But its pretty short. You can notice it most on the Free Range, Sheepsquatch event , if you kill the Sheep before its even out of the ground, you get no legendary.   
---
The "terminated management personal" that spawn as part of this event are spawned specially by the event, so you probably don't need to wait, as long as they have that sickly green glow thing around them
---
Yeah we get it, it ruins the fun for you
---
Check out mappalachia if you need any resources. This is the one for mining: https://i.imgur.com/bIViWhB.jpg
---
1😂
---
Did you listen to her holotape? She probably doesn’t believe that we killed 35m Scorched as a community, and the numbers are all lies.
---
I get about 30 or so on my daily route. National Radio Array, West-Tek, Huntersville (is only good for like one fan), RobCo, Harper's. Have a few hundred for sale in my vendor &amp; about 1000 across my characters. Just cause they were kind of a pain to get at some point and I won't let go. 
---
Any place with office setting is good, as mentioned here by others. 
---
That said I'm pretty sure world spawn items are on a timer (or two). Once you've looted Sugar Grove don't bother going back for awhile, it's going to be empty unless you luck upon the spawns that somebody else caused.
---
Abandoned Bog Town [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Abandoned\_bog\_town](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Abandoned_bog_town)
---
Has 10? typewriters and many many other resources.
---
That would fit so well slamming some ghouls
---
Alright, thanks.
---
I got the fixer on my alt on his first and only time doing the event.
---
A bit over 3000 SCRIP.  My biggest concern is going all brewsters millions during this event and at the end not having any spare scrip or junk legendaries.  Figure on recycling a fair amount but I’ll be close.
---
I found out how to do it last night, once the event pops you have to activate it instantly as fast as possible or else it runs out of time before the extractors can reach the Max.
---
 My guess is because most quests have the timer reset once you activate but uranium fever doesn't seem to
---
That is my experience.
---
Campfire tales was added to the new world event bull shit.  It will start randomly on its own. Pretty much ruined the game for me. Events were all I had left to do and now they never activate. The grind for badges is best done by doing the two dailies.
---
It'd be awesome if we could level a weapon up or down at the purveyor or a special bench. I'd assume it would be for caps or some in-game earned item, but I'm 100% fine with that. One playthrough I got an awesome lvl 20 hunting rifle, but of course by 50 it was crap compared to everything else.
---
If this ever happens, I 100% guarantee it will be something you buy from the atomic shop.
---
Alright, I’ll be sure to try your route. And thanks for letting me know that the items had  a timer. I actually didn’t know that.
---
It's almost like not everyone in the world celebrates Halloween :P
---
I kinda wished Australia did.. :(
---
two dalies?
---
I always get the one in grafton where you gather up the goo. What's the other daily?
---
If your referring to campfire tales it can no longer be manually triggered. It's a public event so it only pops up once in a blue moon
---
the bug parts
---
So the gun is so powerful it ignores DR on the majority of creatures? Sounds worthless😂
---
Yeah- the tier 2 and 3 rewards are tied to the Uranium and each quest stage gives greater Uranium, so quest stage 200 ( the first stage ) gives 1,  Quest stage 201 gives 2,  Quest Stage 202 gives 3  etc 
---
So you gotta get through as many quest stages as possible
---
That might be a reasonable conclusion.  I'll play a character until it's optimized for a specific build, then onto the next character/playstyle.  
---
People sell script worthy weapons &amp; armor at player vendors on nearly every server so I can max out the 150 daily in about 20 minutes or so for each of my characters.
---
I read somewhere on Reddit that spawned items were in a timer of like 18(maybe 24?) Hours, and it worked so that when you logged in the first time you picked up an item set the timer. So if you logged on and grabbed a can at 6pm, items wouldn't respond for you until noon the next day. Don't know how accurate that is, bit it seems fairly accurate from playing the game.
---
I think u need to reach a certain level to be notified for some events
---
Check the daily planer terminal at your camp for the two dallies, it will show when it’s available as well, shows biv also
---
I wonder if they would get shot down through a nuke blast within the blast radius
---
Why do we want him to get lost in the woods? Lol
---
Maybe the guy is drunk? I do stupid shit when I drink. Sometimes after logging back in after drinking at night I notice my junk is gone. I probably either pvp and lost it or I died and forgot. I get pissed but then again its my dumb ass fault for drinking and playing.
---
Hmm. I thought that bar would trigger the management (legendary) part of the event. If you repair them fast they always spawn every 2 mins give or take couple seconds. 
---
Found a broken reactor that i missed and the last wave didn't come till 10 seconds before the end.
---
Become a cannibal, and consider it a free meal:)
---
I love how you avoid actually adding to what I have said or contesting it, and simply put out a blanket statement. 
---
The best part is that because its a blanket statement it can be turned around into "Or they could be just left alone. It's pretty simple really".
---
What exactly do you lose by letting them do their thing? Or is this an issue of "this is how the game is made so play it right!"?
---
50%. That doesn’t make any bit of help until you start hitting heavy armor enemies. Armor values are so low on most enemies that you will only be doing 2-3 more damage than a non legendary. Therefore completely worthless for nearly every enemy outside of the mire. Nocturnal puts out more damage. PVP this thing is a brute because cutting through 250 points in armor is more significant than cutting through 50.
---
 Sell them to meeee
---
Yeah from the looks of it, you can trigger 3 bosses \\  Terminated Management Personal  that are guaranteed legendary bosses and killing them gives you the Uranium that fills the bar as well as the interim extractor waves
---
Abandoned Bog Town has a bunch of typewriters and globes in the hidden 3rd floor. Just be warned it is within the workshop boundaries and I would totally kill you if I found you there. My typewriters! 
---
Move fast!
---
Ok, thanks.
---
Yeah I get what you're saying man just mean like the gun isn't worthless for PvE it's still going to mow down everything in front of it. But yeah they are great for PvP, use one myself but considering switching over to VE.
---
possibly the discord (i haven't had much luck there), i know there are a few ps4 lfg posts in this sub as well where you may be able to contact some users
---
Any place with desks is bound to have desk fans but not in #s like sugar grove.  Id hit up charleston, ams headquarters, hornwright.   Gas stations usually have one on the counter and sometimes in guard posts/ gate houses.   Giddy-up-buttercups are also an alternative source of screws.
---
I don't think they have collision boxes at that point. I spent some time trying to snipe them. Also I don't think they take rad damage at all but I can't recall seeing one in a nuke zone.
---
Alright, thanks. That seems pretty good.
---
Abandoned Bog Town, second floor (you have to go on top of the office building, then drop down the elevator to get to this floor)
---
Theres a room full of typewriters (like 10 of them) and a few globes too.
---
I always hit this place before jumping to sugar grove.
---
you can add me, im lvl 42 tho
---
Owl_No 
---
pls put 'fo76' in request
---
Alright that seems really good. Thanks!
---
You're addressing the core audience bud
---
OK...fair warning.   You won’t even know I came.  😁
---
Yes either a certain level or possibly locations being discovered possibly.
---
Yeah Boys! We are unstoppable together
---
Poor Marvin...

He’s a troll. Look at his comment history
---
Downvoting not because I necessarily disagree with the message presented, but because I'm uninterested in political/social justice/climate change/religion/etc etc etc soapboxing making appearances during my escapism time, no matter which sides of any of those topics we all fall on.
---
Reality is hard enough.
---
Once in a blue moon at best. I've played probably 100 hours since they ruined events and have seen it twice.
---
Its gone for now. I had the recipe for like 2 weeks then they removed the recipe and any mines in the game.
---
Before that if you just held one you learned the plan.
---
Also along with what these guys are saying about it being a public event, I think it is bugged and it is not rewarding badges. Neither are the 2 dailies. I haven’t gotten 1 since the public event update and I do them every day still.
---
Im with op. I made a new char but barely used it in a month. Loaded up my level 7 char and noticed im now walking when Im over carry weight. I think its a bug too because I dont get this on my normal character.
---
I get the fast travel glitch when I log in but it’s only affecting travel to paid locations but after a while or fast traveling back to my camp it normally works , also the scrip machines normally load in like 15 seconds after fast travelling to a train station for me
---
You aren't fooling anyone and you are clearly a very angry person.
---
Been one shotting then for months a d trying get get the bar full. I dont think its possible. .
---
U wot
---
Be more social.
---
Level 312, PC, Los Angeles. Same name as my Reddit. Always down to help or teach/share about the game.
---
?
---
It does.
---
Fixer plan is easy you can just trigger the event whenever you want with caps and if you have a good build you can carry the dps so it doesn't fail.
---
Bear arm on the other hand is nearly impossible, you need the event to randomly trigger, then you need enough people to turn up, then you need people to split up and know what they are doing, and to keep all 3 animals alive.
---
Should show you in preview part
---
It only ran for a week during the spring. It'll be coming back again next year.
---
You've had a year to 'cash in'?
---
What correlation I've noticed is that people who build as close as possible to train stations almost always have atrocious prices, but I'm not sure why.  They're often camps with the four vending machines and little more.
---
i truly hope they will let vats free of any limitation ... or , in the worst scenario , disable it at all ... for how the system works atm it's just stupiu and unfair
---
75 caps in your machine or free to a friend
---
IIRC, I have found a bunch in Grafton Steel, typically sitting on the shelves of open lockers or on the tool pegboards.
---
And super mutants will often have loose screws in their loot.
---
Neither are you sir, neither are you.
---
You are in the truest sense of the phrase Elitest Jerk.
---
You think you are gods greatest gift to fallout, and treat everyone that doesnt have 2k hours in game like they are trash peasants not good enough to be in your presence.
---
You bash people that disagree with you, talk down to people trying to learn, and generally cause people grief.
---
But, it takes one to know one.  You are right, I have a bit of anger.  I dont contantly talk down to others like I am the greatest thing in the world because of my full set of zealots and empath though.   
---
And to your response from earlier that you are a casual group that dont have requirements.  But you have posts telling people that you do not allow certain builds to run with you, and tell people to take off endgame gear.  Sounds a little hypocritical if you ask me.    You see, I do my research, and your explaination does not match up with your previous posts about your little clique.
---
Go solo the SBQ some more and brag about how your build is the best thing ever.  We really dont care.  
---
Look in the mirror before you get on your horse and think you are king.  You are not king, you are a pawn at best and not fit to breathe air with the rest of us. 
---
Judgement will come for you just like the rest of us, and you will be burning in hell along with me, so I will see you there.
---
So I guess the real question is, "Who hurt YOU"?
---
How much
---
For me it wouldn't even give the option to travel to camp, only named locations which would bug out, and I'm used to post-launch stuff loading a little later. Honestly it just feels like the game is stuck in that first 15 seconds, it's weird.
---
i’d be down to play. i’m also on ps4 hmu!

---
Amen! This made me laugh, as I feel the same!
---
Your more likely to get 3 random legendaries that you can get scrip for than you are to get the rarest plan in the game! I think it’s a definite dick move to one shot the legendaries as If 15 seconds is going to make or break anything.
---
A young male horse is called a colt. A young female horse is called a filly.
---
But it can make or break something, and people more than likely will one-shot them anyway
---
Or don't be a dick and let everyone else tag legendaries,
---
you'll still get a quest reward when it ends. I think you're overestimating the complexity of the event.
---
I've had times where I've had 10 to 15 scorched or ghouls swarm my camp beside the train station near Poseiden Power Plant
---
Also that's not the rarest. Stimpack Diffuser/Bear Arm are because it's a high level event that requires a perfect run
---
Thank you for your very vague and unhelpful comment, which holds no water because you've chosen to not add anything meaningful to it.
---
This event is one of my highest incomes. I dont care if they are lvl 5 or lvl 50. Those legendaries sell for 25 caps per scrip really fast. I make around 5k caps daily from this event alone.
---
So yeah, everyone should still share the legendary imo.
---
To see public events, you need to be above level 7 or 9.
---
See my [Where to Farm: All the Things](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/c9njxj/where_to_farm_all_the_things/) guide, which includes the best spots for aluminum veins.
---
I got given all the ultracite power armour today was pretty cool but matey next door started beating me cuz i wouldnt buy his/her over expensive legendarys, i love this game
---
Pretty shitty i did all that grinding to craft my strangler set and i cant even use it on high health enemies without freezing everyone around me. Like Bethesda.....Wtf?
---
I rarely go to that event where people one shot the legendaries. The regular enemies, maybe, but waiting 10 seconds while everyone tags the only 3 enemies of value isn’t going to offset the timer for the event in any significant manner imo.
---
Yeah I’ve never beaten project paradise with more than 1 thing alive. I’ll try that for the fixer plan tho thx
---
'1000. Planning to spend it all on 3* Armor. The disappointment will be immeasurable, but it'll feel like christmas morning while rolling them all.
---
They've saod multiple times that they are focusing on Wastelanders. If their designing, coding and testing Atomic Shop stuff that takes away from it's development, same reason there's been bigger spaces between patches.
---
If the Free States backpack didn't have a logo, it would be an instant buy.
---
I agree, I was on only 2 hours and took part in 6 SBQ events, 3 back to back on 1 server. It was wonderful mayhem the entire time.
---
lol that was the biggest complaint since Bethesda it a public event, too many jerks there one-shotting them when there's like six other people there
---
Yea I guess that’s true but I’ve done uranium fever 300 times and I’ve never gotten that plan. I’ve done arktos like 15 times and I did get the bear arm plan at least. I still need the diffuser plan but nobody ever goes there any more!
---
If they ever implement Legendary Power Armor, they absolutely need to have different modifiers.
---
'Stabilized' - Increased sighted accuracy?
---
'Energized' - Increased energy/plasma efficiency?
---
best title
---
I would like to see where I called people an idiot.  
---
So please post those.
---
Or are you just pissed I didnt take your advice, and someone elses instead.
---
Downtalking me for arguing on the internet.   Again, Pot, meet Kettle.
---
Yeah I have the same issue, I cant get past talking to the robot to clean toxic waste. No help and no solutions! Hopefully itll be fixed somehow with the wastelanders dlc since its a soft relaunch. Bc a patch not long ago fixed 2 other quests I had to do but just not the toxic waste lmao
---
Thatd be dope, I like the class specialization stuff
---
Watch the next shop update be raider bastard cosmetics or something, which will just be bloody versions of the raider waster stuff xD.
---
I guess it’s because they had to delay wastelands but didn’t fill the gap in the atomic shop
---
Ew  
---
Fortnite
---
I guess I’ve been lucky. Idk. Then again I don’t run over there every time it goes off. The last time I went there was probably 10 people there but they all took turns hitting the bosses at least. Don’t get me wrong, that event is trash! But when I was a lower level player I got decent drops from it that helped out. I would just feel like a total dick if I one shoted all the bosses in front of a group of players.
---
I can usually boost my Int with unyielding and chems for crafting and mass scrapping for mods.  And crafting is really most useful for power armor which already has really good durability because weapons and armor should be legendary which luck is more useful for.  Scrapping seems kinda useless since you don't get anything besides basic stuff like wood, steel, leather, crap like that right?  You can't get the good stuff like screws or springs right?
---
Around 7500. Looking forward to the sale!
---
No, bumble bee skin only
---
I didnt know about this. Daily quests, like the once from your terminal? Like cleaning up?
---
Whitesprings nuke is usually best way, though I heard morgantown airport is about same.
---
I was not toxic, we had a decent discussion.
---
There was information shared back and forth, he asked questions and I responsed.
---
This is how discourse is completed. 
---
Im sorry that the other user whom was on this thread talked to me when all you did was trash talk and then get nasty.
---
I give what is given, and you have given nothing but hate.
---
I sell stims for 20 diluted for 10 have no problem sellin them bullets are weird though ny high level cant get rid of them and my low level cant keep them in stock i can only guess its my camp location
---
Also, we could be real men and move on and agree that we disagree.'
---
Are you adult enough to live and let live, or will you hold a grudge?
---
i havent played since the pulled most of the devs off stw...
---
still feel bad for paragon players
---
The global matchmaking update made no difference to me, I often see the same gamertags it's funny
---
I've given enough information for people willing to do some thinking to know what I'm talking about, and I have proven track record of outpacing the meta. Use what you can/want from it; I'll stop diluting the information once my stash is adjusted to the upcoming changes.
---
Wouldn't you need to start with a ton of assaultron heads first for this to work?
---
One can hope
---
Before you go to the trouble of reinstalling, have you reset everything, including your networking equipment (router/wap/cable modem)?
---
The few times I have had the types of issues you posted, and others weren’t having same issues, a reboot of everything “fixed”.
---
Lever actions are great, TSE not so much. Get better legendary effects on a lever action and you'll feel like you're holding a whole new gun.
---
Passive aggressive anti logic reply? 
---
You should have more than i. I've been playing pretty sporadically since  release and am engaged planning a wedding so pretty content with my progress. My buddies in the 400+ levels have more than they know what to do with of that stuff.
---
You should probably wait for them to actually add that stuff to the game first before expecting it to all just show up suddenly some Tuesday. There's a reason data mining threads with all the expected atom shop items pop up with the actual updates to the game, they're not just sneaking stuff in during the weekly server downtime. We keep getting raiders and free states because that's what's in the game until the next patch drops.
---
Is it a random chance that a price of power armor on a stand will be lvl 50?
---
but.... but.... The handmade weighs more than the heavies... lol :)
---
I don’t think the scout quests do it, but the others do. Buried With Honor, Cop A Squatter, Heart of the Enemy, Chow Line, Waste Not, Play Time, Pumpkin House...amongst various others. 
---
They should show up in your Pip Boy, but some won’t pop unless you go to their respective region on the map.
---
Wait, what?
---
“And that’s how we do it in the U.S Army hoo ah!”
---
Mr. Gusty
---
😂😂😂
---
Yeah, its freakin silly.
---
Wow thanks. How much script are we even talking? 2 to 5?
---
Ive never heard about this (or noticed it when doing quests)
---
I'm gonna burn through all the scrip I have until I hit the resell limit, then do it again the next day, and empty all the legendaries out of my vendor if I have to.
---
I’ve found some useful stuff from low-level player vendors. I buy rubber cheap to craft marine helmets and sell them to Robot Vendors, and I have frequently seen rubber for 1 cap/piece. With my Charisma perks, I net about $750 caps per 100 units of rubber at that cost. 
---
I’ve also run into some plans that I’ve had trouble finding elsewhere. Not high-level weapon plans, but cheap recipes and plans for decorative furniture. You never know...
---
U didnt mention in post so nope didnt think u did.
---
If you mean hunters long coat it's worth a few thousand caps. Its gonna be hard to find one for the caps offered.
---
Yes please!
---
I still have my lvl15 BE25 handmade, would looooove to level it to 50.
---
They give 5-8 scrip each depending on the region
---
Thats what the spoiled meat is for
---
Okay i never knew there was a strategy to the event to maximize rewards. That is pretty cool i will save this post so i know thanks
---
I need fixer plan still, you on PC ?
---
Nah. It got sucked into a black hole.
---
4k
---
Getcha thanks
---
This was fixed last patch. They reward badges.
---
I was very confused for sure. At first I thought it was a scorched or ghoul someone had dispatched but then I saw the clothes
---
Alright, you can pick up any time between 5 and 7
---
Every Fortnight player : "Chapter 2 makes Fortnite feel fresh! It's everything we could have asked for! It's a whole new game!"
---
Me: "They added fishing and the ability to carry team mates....."
---
Boi. That’s common sense to server hop.
---
It's so boring it makes you want to study instead
---
Then I'll get more caps
---
Damn I’ve been getting the shaft then! I do both dailies and camp Adams if it pops up every day. Those robot tight wads better start coughing up those badges then!!!
---
Soon as I level up enough in nuclear winter, my power armour is gonna be coated in rainbows and sprinkles
---
Sorry don't know what that means? There is a excel sheet going around that tells u where everything is and for the most part how much is in those locations. I have it not sure how to post it, u could just do a search
---
Oh puhlease, you are not so special that you need a separate post about this.
---
If you can't stand the backlash, either change your behavior or just go away.
---
I don’t think it alerts you though.
---
I literally discovered this yesterday! So many screws. :)
---
Either or is good for me, whatever the devs or the public think is more appropriate. I think banning it from public events would help the community in being that people actually want the ability to complete events and not have their games freeze or crash completely.
---
Ur playin with fire buddy
---
What are you talking about? I meant the event when it happened.
---
Perhaps, I made one anyway, and really dont care what you think about it.
---
And I am special, I have a helmet to prove it.
---
It doesn’t, you have to check your collections tab on your pip boy.
---
Common sense means that’s basic knowledge. Since you have to learn it though, it’s not instinct. Also I did do research. It just all ends up, with videos and links, and pictures to sugar grove
---
Will do!
---
Does happen sometimes ( for me ) if I die just before or immediately after the boss dies.
---
Happened at Encryptid a few times and the last time it did I just waited a couple of minutes and I eventually got back in and got the loot off the imposter.
---
I believe the responder bot that spawns at the Charleston station has it and its not 2k its maybe a couple hundred if i remember thats where i got mine i think. U just have to hop servers a few hundred times.
---
I think it’s 3-8 depending on the region. They don’t show up in the rewards but you’ll see your scrips go up in your Pip Boy after each one. They changed it a few patches ago.
---
You too
---
Ok im obv just stupid hahahaha
---
Edit: have ch and van somehow thought it was on 1 piece whereas its between my 2 legs. My bad
---
Oh to server hop gotcha. Okay so i have never had a problem getting anything since its basically written out where to get it thats why i dont make posts like this because i have plenty of screws and i support 5 characters and that doesnt include my wifes characters. Sugar grove is not the only place with screw. Really good luck with ur search
---
On XB1 should have mentioned that sorry
---
Big Bend tunnel.
---
Got a 50dmg resist, ffr, TS Minigun for 1500 the other day and laughed all the way back to my camp ;D
---
Here's a good primer on which events and how much they give:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d5a1rx/daily\_quests\_now\_give\_scrip/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d5a1rx/daily_quests_now_give_scrip/)
---
Thanks.
---
I am hoping that our musical instruments will suddenly play spookier music.
---
Nah theres a lot of effects and people mistake them pretty often since you cant see what the other effects are called on a 3 star
---
They were something like 0.03%, so the amount of players, still playing, who are going to get butthurt are going to be very few. And they've had an entire year to wear them and show them off.
---
I'm not saying hand them out to everyone for participating, but stacking the deck to a more fair opportunity is a no-brainer.
---
3-8 depending on region. Oddly Ash Heap gives more than Savage Divide. See here: 
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d5a1rx/daily\_quests\_now\_give\_scrip/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d5a1rx/daily_quests_now_give_scrip/)
---
my camp is near 76 i leave them unlocked and plant veggies that i rarely use for the new characters traveling through to have stuff to much on and drink .. its a long road ahead .. and maybe they will do the same when they settle in on a location later.
---
On XB1 btw
---
Agreed. It isn’t like leaving them around for 30 seconds makes that much difference
---
My bad i meant "noone from my group"
---
Valid point.
---
This is just what the dataminers are thinking, they can't find what makes the bar fill faster. A friend looked into it more, they said the only thing that seems to fill up faster is killing the bosses quicker
---
Could also be so griefer gathering up ghouls and leading them back to ur base to do what they cant do. Never know
---
This would be cool.
---
Hi, I would like to help, trying to get all the armor and power armor as well as beat all difficulties for challenges. I have experience on all raids, and have beaten expert on the first raid, psn name is Zeronial.
---
There's seven tiers of rewards. It's not that big of a bar. That means each tier only covers a tiny amount of progress. The 30 seconds actually might make a difference
---
Well i will try it next time im on not til this weekend. If u figure it out or have more info please post and thanks for the info u have
---
It’s 840 caps from the responder bot, 3-4K in player vendors.
---
And I had such a good Obsidian meme locked and loaded if we would've missed it by just a bit.
---
International customers all use universal standard time. Everyone operating internationally should use UST.
---
Ehhh I just see it as itll be put on the shop come patch 14 but why they waited so long for patch 14 is my question I really thought it woulda came today but whatever ill still buy it and they know that
---
There's seven tiers of rewards based on the progress of the event. Each tier, the chances of Shielded plans dropping goes up. It doesn't actually drop until tier 5 I think. So really for the best chances of getting a plan, kill them as quickly as possible. A lot of people don't care about the plan but I don't care about the legendaries lol
---
Idk what happened but I think you're a douche
---
I have 5 characters. 5 different levels.
---
No not"good stuff" but if you run heavies or commando you NEED the extra scrap for steel for ammo. The bonus off of 1 or 2 peices of un- yeilding would  definitely work. Certainly don't need high Int. just pointing out some of the benefits. I am personally addicted to XP, so....🤗
---
There u go i knew someone would know. I do remember it took me many tries to get it. Thanks for the info
---
Maybe. I suspect you aren’t gonna get much traction, people will want the certainty of scrip over the minutely increased minute chance of rare outfits and plans.
---
congrats all! wish i could take advantage of whats coming!
---
Your local bar or bistro...
---
I know, just imagine if someone broke out some AAA Video Game Polish on this game?  Just bug stomping and server stability would revolutionize this game. Either way at over 1400hrs I still play every day👍
---
I was hoping for pumpkins.. and costumes.. and fog machines.. and decorations.. and events.. and.. 😭
---
993 on my main and 875 on my alt.
---
EDIT: found a few links online that say there is only a 25% chance to get a badge from a quest or event. That's pathetically low.
---
I got 1 yesterday from the clean up one, but that's the ONLY quest/event Im aware of.
---
note: it doesn't list them on screen with all the (known) cigarette machine plans, 2 pemmican, and a leather shoulder rewards. If you check your pip-boy under 'collections' you should see that it ticked up by one after each event.
---
So I leave mine unlocked and wish I had a share box to drop loot in for people who want it, other then zero price on the vendors.
---
Also I set up workshops for the green forest and leave all the resources unlocked, set up lights and hope people let people grab them.
---
There's a list of which dailies give scrip (and how much) in this thread:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d5a1rx/daily\_quests\_now\_give\_scrip/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d5a1rx/daily_quests_now_give_scrip/)
---
A boy can only dream of these wonderous thoughts
---
Uranium fever always spawns in 3 legendarys but mole miners cap at level 40 so no max level drops.  One violent night also guarantees one from the wendigo if someone doesn't one shot it.  It also spawns in a lot of ghouls which have a chance at a legendary or two.  Encrypted also has the guaranteed imposter sheepsquatch that is legendary.
---
I play with music off a majority of the time. I’ll turn it on occasionally if I want to sing/hum along to Appalachia Radio. It’s pretty incredible how great the sound is. When I first started playing, I had my tv relatively loud one night and my wife said “man the cicadas are REALLY loud tonight, what’s the deal”. It was coming from the TV haha. She could hardly believe it.
---
I just sold my Fixer plan for 250 caps... 😂😂
---
Bruh, eat/drink! That ap bar...
---
I'm still gonna one shot enemies, this is just to get others to try it so we can check it out this info
---
Damn, that sucks. Guess the random person was fulm of it saying he was making them on PC(podt was from a few days ago). Thanks for the reply!
---
I actually went and turned off the area where the power to router, xbox etc is sourced from the mains and it seems to have done the trick so far, NW is nice and smooth again
---
I was a bit preoccupied with the random corpse in my larder man. The food was temporarily inaccessible lol
---
What platform are you on, im on ps4 and im tryng to do the raids back to back myself but I cant find like minded players.
---
Sting and things, Dolly sods, 1 each stinging Barb, blood bug proboscis, rad roach meat, tick blood sac, bloatfly gland.
---
Thats a really neat skin.  
---
I recommend the purple headlamp to go with it.
---
I have a sinking suspicion that we **“** made it **”**
---
Im on pc unfortunately.
---
hey man i’m down to join you i’ll add you
---
thank you
---
Yea after every event I check my collections for badges or how much scrip from the other events. I guess I’ve just been REALLY unlucky because I have gotten over 20 or so badges from doing the event and dailies. I haven’t completed one possum scout challenge and I have 3 mods and I still have 5 badges in my inventory. I’m trying to get 8 so I can trade them off at a high value.
---
Doesn’t Sony email you a receipt of the transaction?
---
And habitat c seems essentially impossible, just not enough (radkelp?)... Other two are relatively easy, and then friendly animal ai us abysmal. No Nigel the bloodbug, we don't need your help with the 3*legendary lvl 100 Fogcrawler!
---
10k ammo for sbq? I think she’s farming you!
---
What's a good price for bulk acid ?
---
I never saw the bar fill up completely. Not even when my handmade had 2000 damage.
---
Asshole, not douche.
---
It's back again.
---
Awesome! I’m just running some errands but I will be on later tonight
---
I was just exaggerating, but yeah, those heavy builds spend tons of ammo none the less.
---
Jesus, man; drink some fucking water!
---
Yeah I also know that the best way to do One Violent Night is not to play music. Don’t mater none. Good luck getting a critical mass of people to go along with you.
---
I want this with requirements:
---
new character. No legendary gear.
---
You seem like more of a douche
---
5k, only one account lol. All I want out of it is 1 fixer, all 5 toons have the plan, fingers crossed.
---
But then you miss out on the songs man. Death rattles just aren't as catchy. 
---
"Blunt the knives! Bend the forks!"
---
Because what you are saying is ridiculous. Other people shouldn't have to play the way you want them too. Especially in a game that gives them choices.
---
Like I said, you dont need to own workshops in fo76. If you claim workshops you are engaging in a mechanic that was built with PvP in mind, if PvP happens.
---
I wouldn’t doubt it. I feel fortunate my main is melee cause I hate farming lead 😂.
---
In my experience, 40 caps each is a quick sell. I'm greedy so I charge 50 caps each. Can take longer to sell it but it'll sell eventually.
---
Hi greedy so i charge 50 caps each. can take longer to sell it but it'll sell eventually., I'm dad.
---
in my defense, there was a corpse in my kitchen. I was a bit preoccupied.
---
My four toons have 700, 500, 300 and 150 or so respectively.
---
I know the soldier looking uniform has "free states" graffitied over the chest, which isn't in the AS picture. It's sad because otherwise it looks cool( I don't own it).
---
You are one serious MFer
---
lolwut
---
Drop rate was 0.03% sooo
---
Hooded rags do not allow the use of armor.
---
1 Luckyhole Mine run with excavator power armor, plus super duper+ammo smith netted me over 1400 lead XD. I had so much I couldn't even craft/store it all. Had to sell at least 50 bulk leads worth. But then Gunpowder/Acid shortages started becoming an issue. So yeah, automatic weapon builds can be a pain in the ass to manage.
---
I've seen many you- tube videos of people just blowing through 1000's of scrip and getting a couple of good rolls but usually 90% are crap or 100%.  If I get a bad roll I will jump servers though I don't really know if it helps but I think it is a better option.
---
Is it total rng or have Bethseda tweaked it to drop 'better' rolls less frequent? As far as having certain guns equipped ( like a handmade ) does it help get something similiar?  Are Bethseda capable of coding a result like this? I kind of doubt it.
---
I really don't know one way or another. Probably more attempts ( just keep grinding away ) will result in more chances to get a good drop eventually.
---
I'm down as well..psn: SigmaX__kz101 (2 underscores)
---
So many scorched killed ,:(
---
I see it for 250 in vendors fairly regularly, but that's too rich for my blood personally.
---
It's a 3* The Fixer or bust.  Will test the water for bad servers. Had an auto stim server the other night, ended up with 5 peices, bleh.
---
Yeah most of my toons are herbivores, but I cook and eat all the Scorchbeast goodies when I kill them. 
---
My melee is a carnivore. Just seems appropriate.
---
We were hitting about 2 million per day before the final goal was added. 
---
With the amazing effort from the first 3 days the tally jumped to about 33.6 million, and I started to realize we would make it.
---
Thankyou! I wanted to make post literally saying this exactly. 
---
Sometimes I feel like a manatee in a tank making random choices is the person in-charge of decision making for sort of things at Bethesda.
---
I'm they are dedicating resources for Wastelanders, but no-one had the foresight to think Halloween will be 1 of the most requested and profitable atomic shop themes.
---
Obviously people want to decorate their camps for the Halloween season and I'm sure there wouldve been ALOT of sales, but putting the items in the shop for only 2-3 days of Halloween will severely diminish sales/profits.
---
Congrats to the people who actually grinded this snoozefest lol.
---
I did a little helping out the last day...but only because I kept coming across scorched in my travels. I didn't go out of my way to grind this.
---
NETHACK FTW
---
I remember the time my camp was getting attacked by 2 scorchbeasts. That was fun. 😑
---
Right!??
---
I wish I was able to get my partner to play...but he's obsessed with ESO...and we're also waiting for 76 to go on sale...hopefully this holiday season.
---
I also wish my RP buddy would stop avoiding 76...we used to play every day together but now it's like pulling nails trying to get them to play again.
---
sounds good
---
I'm on PS4 too! What's your psn? :)
---
Hi on ps4 too! what's your psn? :), I'm dad.
---
Thank you !
---
I ran onto a swarm of radstags somewhere southwest of the crashed space station. Id guess around 30 or so....ran out of shotty ammo.
---
When did this start? How did I miss this?
---
Like a month ago
---
Damn, I picked up an explosive medics lever action with +1 something or other off the queen last night. What do you think it's worth?
---
It's higher in higher level areas and if a high level player caused it to spawn.
---
Sure thing, make that money.
---
That's what he said
---
Dang would play but I'm on Xbox. Good luck on preparations tho
---
Hi on xbox. good luck on preparations tho, I'm dad.
---
Can be bought from the [Roaming Responders Vendor Bot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26mx2DsjuV0) as a random clothing spawn (other rare clothing items as well).
---
Happy Hunting!
---
Bruh
---
Yeah, I was so excited recently when a TSE railway dropped for me. I haven't played around with it much but I far prefer my 1* Bloodied combat rifle. Too bad, I really dig the oddity factor of the railway rifle and how you get so many spikes back with a tse version. Maybe I'll get one with better legendary effects to drop someday. 
---
Think they'll ever buff the TSE guns back up some?
---
It used to be easy back when you could trigger it, just go in with a team and knock it out.    
---
But now that it's part of the random events, only time I complete is when I happen to have enough people on my FL on the server.    
---
Even then it's tough as a lot of the time some asshat will trigger the event before we even clear the biomes, or disable ARIC which inevitably causes at least 1 friendly to aggro the alpha and die.  
---
Still we've pulled a full completions off with all 3 friendlies since it switched to a public event but I used to do this like 2 or 3 times a day, and now it's maybe once per week lol.
---
I have definitely got badges from dailies and camp fire but not as often as before
---
Ok.
---
Its so painful. Combat rifles are so damn heavy. I'm doing my best not to be a hoarder, but damn is it punishing to just try and use more than 3 rifles. Let alone just wanting to collect and use a full set of trappers armor or sturdy raider armor.
---
I would buy everything BOS related.
---
The ol' douchebag ghoul kite... people suck sometimes
---
Same hahaha
---
Yea that’s what I’m saying. I’ve gotten every badge from dailies I just haven’t gotten one in weeks! I’ve lost hope the last week or so and haven’t been doing them as much tbh.
---
Hi saying. i’ve gotten every badge from dailies i just haven’t gotten one in weeks! i’ve lost hope the last week or so and haven’t been doing them as much tbh., I'm dad.
---
Whats fortnight
---
I've always liked them since I was introduced to the FO world with FO 3 and always hated the Enclave.
---
you can usually get it to rank 1 at least and sometimes rank 2.  Main secret I've found is to get mats in the hopper asap, faster you harvest them the faster they respawn.  
---
But yeah you really need a fuckton of dps and good players with itchy trigger fingers in there to kill everything ASAP otherwise that friendly has no chance.
---
Wait... Did Bethesda announce something about delaying wastelanders?
---
The shit we'll do for Todd's 30 cents.
---
Sleep to get the well rested bonus, eat cranberry relish and canned meat stew and always do the path to enlightenment when it shows up for the xp buffs
---
Apex, probably
---
I 100 % agree with you, I just dont wanna see them dropping like candy. I enjoy having something to grind for in these events. I have everything from meat week. They made that one to easy lol.
---
Now I've got absolutely no interest in PvP, but a civil war reenactment with old school weapons and clothing would be awesome! Also a protestors Vs strikebreakers event would be dope- imagine only having melee protest signs equipped and going up against waves of robots
---
Kill everything you can, do the daily's or events, if you have rank 3 inspiration(under charisma) you get +15%(?) Exp if you're in a group. Questing helps too. If you havent done the Order of Mysteries quest line it's long and takes you a lot of places with plenty of enemies to kill
---
Good rule of thumb: give your game a 30 count before pressing any buttons when first logging in to a server
---
Are you mocking my lv5 bloodied shovel!? XD
---
Good post - so it's not pure RNG but a constructed ( kind of ) RNG.  So to speak.
---
Gotcha thanks good luck
---
wth….. bro no need to get freaking triggered..... I just hit 428 on my main..... no sure why your give me grief, "hey I got high level friends"

Bad bot
---
What’s your PSN? I run with a group of 3 and we could use a 4th for this raid on expert and perhaps some extra standard runs for the weekly challenge. We’re all 300 and 400+.
---
Yoda?
---
No more super mutants Scorched now
---
They could have us clean out our stashes and fill in the cracks to inaugurate a new more spacious stash.
---
Exactly. 2 or 3 is great. Other second effects will help more than a 4th ap, such as poison or radiation resistance, or extra strength.
---
You can also get ap refresh from being well tuned, and from lone wander and rejuvenated.
---
Beyond I think two? pieces of ap armor, you get minimal benefit from action boy/girl.
---
how bout a flag/patch editor so we can make our own.
---
What else is a level 30 going to sell?
---
Just like most people in this Sub,  I feel part of the family now.
