I sell mine for 11c each. They seem to sell often enough that I haven’t lowered the price.

Just killed the vicious wolves with a cultist dagger and didn't count for hunter badge. Sigh. Time to go craft a combat knife.
---
What does energy damage? Oh that's right, energy weapons. It doesn't work on energy weapons.
---
Or send bloodied weapons to an alt....
---
Its an easter egg to avatar the last airbender. In the animated series a character makes a sword out of a fallen metorite.
---
You want to know what I experienced? Before the camp fix, someone killed my mirelurk king. That took three hours to find and tame. Wham, bounty for 5 caps on the murderer. All completely unprovoked. I had a 50/50 having it respawn if I left the game quick enough and it did. But then a few weeks later it despawned and kept the camp budget. There was barely any work put into the taming system. Best feature and it sucks badly.
---
I'm comin to your house this halloween
---
You just got nae naed
---
Bad luck is bad lol
---
what
---
Players cant kill your tames in adventure anymore
---
Has been happening to me lately too. I'm starting to think there aren't many servers and not many people.
---
Exactly.
---
Sad thought it doesn't work in Seneca Rocks nountains
---
I have been making post the past couple days with 1 cap ammo. Finally gave it all away today to some random lv 12.
---
Seems like a lot to infer about a person from so small a pool of information
---
When I see a low level with a ton of stuff for sale I go check it out thinking they are probably a secondary. Especially if they are in a good location.
---
It's not just survival. I have this happen constantly on both modes.
---
What this person said. Using leave server I stead of quit will immediately relinquish your allocated spot on the server. Quit can sometimes hold your spot as though you might have disconnected briefly due to network and wants to place you back in.
---
The only other way of getting them “faster” is crazy. Get a friend to hang out near the park. Make a new character. Fast travel to your friend. Do all 3 quests (first time you can do 3x3 for 9 tokens). Trade tokens to your friend. Delete that character. Rinse and repeat.
---
It's the same sword you can get from Breach and Clear. It's a legendary with multiple legendary effects like Assassin's and Weight Reduction. Not great, not horrible.
---
Always put pacifist mode on, unless you want to kill someone.
---
Well, idk if people wanna see my dildo thwakker or thong grazer.
---
F
---
Dammit, now we need jellybeans! Lol
---
Same here, PS4 otherwise we could revive each other. Good luck.
---
So that explains why my razor grain hardly ever grows...
---
It would be nice to be able to delete the junk in camp building mode. Fallout 4 let you do that to some degree.
---
I don't know how technically difficult it would be for them, but it would open up some cool camp possibilities.
---
Same could be said about combining vender cap pools, and adding them all to Whitesprings.
---
You're gonna get tons of hate for this one but it's spot on. Stop running food builds or stay in passive. We all have similar gear and the same perks available at this point.
---
Beats dropping it on the ground
---
This. This is all that is necessary. Did it myself.
---
That's what I thought at first, but I spent time waiting and even turned off the game between logins. This isn't anything new, either...I once launched a nuke, crashed while approaching the queen, then came back 2 hours later to the same server. I know it was the same one because it was late at night and I accidentally nuked the edge of the wrong fissure (i.e not prime).
---
Sure, but F76 is nothing like fallout... So I don't get your point. Never mind, I knew anyone intelligent left this game at the start. I did not suggest it should BE minecraft, I used a simile. The game feels empty and the long term satisfaction feels impossible because nothing you do lasts for more than a couple hours. Great discussion though.
---
Honestly you missed a point where if there hasn’t been any duping, players will have very different weapons and armor, depending what they can find in world. Like Ass/Sent or TSE. How many did the legendary drop for you? I’m in the game for over 800h and I never had Ass/sent piece drop. And about 2x TSE weapon. So YES duping ruined PvP. All I see is ppl jumping in one place and shooting their TSE Shotgun like is a sniper rifle. At least it changed now, but look how many BE Laser rifles are out there rn. Again all duped in couple days. You will never change my mind, it is not legendary drop.
---
I'm not sure if the times are the same for Survival as they are for Adventure, but when I quit game I usually have to wait just a bit longer than a minute to join again for it to put me in a different server.
---
irradiated does that for ya
---
God your username is fitting
---
So you just have to find a really, really, really big radroach.
---
Tse handmade is still good with sneak. With 5 in demolition exploding goes off twice each shot with the 60% damage boost. Using pychotats and bock with glow sight, tormentor, the bosses in arktos get melted and crippled. You could even stick in adrenaline if you want more. Make sure you put in a tuned receiver if semi auto and the perf mag. Hardened will work, but you can't unload it all fast like with tuned. Quick hands perk is nice to add too.
---
I think making some mutations new or old that have visual effects would be higher on my list of wants.
---
Take a video and prove it.
---
I mean..good for you? The new content might or might be good, but if it's the fortnite ripoff bullshit people are theorizing on based on what's leaked so far, it's a fucking shitty idea.  Especially from a "get loot" perspective.
---
Good luck to your brother. Wish we were on same console lol
---
Keep making and scrapping them. I know it seems tedious but wait until you're asking yourself what to do afterward. Scouts?
---
Yeah man that’s why I server hop. To find a server without players in the area I want to quest in.
---
I’m an adult. I will decide what I do, when I do it and the reasons why. I don’t give a fuck what you think about it. Run along and get your homework done, child. The adults are talking.
---
Ugh, that irritates me just reading that. Thankfully griefers can't hurt our animals anymore. Has your camp budget fixed and have you gotten another mirelurk king since then?
---
Had a player (200+) come to my vending machines and wanted to work out a deal for multiple items which was fine with me. We both had mic's and it was going along smoothly, guy was cool to deal with. Another player in the 50's shows up and hits him with his super sledge because apparently he is taking too long at the machine. Mr 200+ calmly backs out of the machine lets the other guy in to look and one shot's the idiot. Mr 200+ goes right back into the machine and continues to negotiate like nothing ever happened. Didn't even bother to pick up the idiots junk and I never saw the other player return to retrieve his stuff. I thought it worked out perfectly. Respect each other and don't be a jacka$$.
---
Anyone else think the background/color scheme dates this as Fallout 4? Could this be a person using mods?
---
Could this be accidental renesance?
---
-a mobile user
---
lmao, don't i know it!
---
Yes!! I forgot about the jelly beans!
---
[removed]
---
There’s several bugged weapons that double dip. Pipe (bolt-action and .38) pistols modded to rifles seem to benefit from their respect auto/semi pistol AND rifle perk cards (note: semi pistol and semi rifle at the same time. Not semi pistol and auto pistol/rifle). 
---
I’ve heard this is also the case for the meat hook, with unarmed and 1h perk cards.

Fyi, free showers in the Whitesprings bunker

Not what you asked for, but I’m on xbox, so it’s all I have for you ;p
---
I actually get boatloads of Tick Blood... If they're killed.
---
I figure people already do this all the time anyway. I read about a lot of folks using “mules,” and I’m sure Bethesda is aware that people do this. My one hope would be to add features that pull in more folks and make them active again. Really active players that are so busy they’re making mule accounts should be helping to draw more of the community back in...
---
In on ps4 and I need the same thing. I can log on and help you out quick if you want
---
I know, I was trying to make a joke
---
[Speech check failed]
---
I’d assume Demo Expert would change the boom to a big badda boom. Massive splash damage.
---
You can skip repairing the pipes with lockpick 3 and hacker 3.
---
Take a left as soon as you enter the pipe room and there's a level 3 lock door, pick that then hack the terminal to override lockdown.
---
Cuts the time down a good bit.
---
Hope that's clear enough.
---
Damn thats bad luck man, at first we where with the 3 of us for about 5/10 minutes,i thought she aint coming down today.but then i saw the green bullets of a laser gun that explode i think,good sign:)so in the end i think 8 ofbus killed her with a minute to go...soooo cool.im level 150 with a tse handmade,used 6k rounds included silo run haha
---
Don't look at 15 locations.  Look at one and server hop.  When you find the tourist try to let everybody on the server know.
---
I would like to mule stuff but I don't trust anyone to hold it until I log onto another character. The only option is to buy another copy and make another account and dual box it.
---
hi  im only lvl 20 and haven't unlocked all that yet
---
Good job, you insulted yourself while trying to insult me. 
---
If you want to play minecraft, or any other always on RPG, feel free to do so. Please uninstall fallout and go play games that aren't as "empty" feeling. 
---
Though how you could think MINECRAFT is a LESS empty experience boggles my fucking brain.
---
Perk cards.  Just get each of the melee ones as they pop up.  Pick between 1h or 2h. Don't do both.  Tag lead, pick up those junk items to scrap, and then later on get the ammosmith perk which let's you craft more ammo.  Also just generally pick up all the ammo you come across (obviously).
---
i got 3 shit 3\* flamers 3 days in a row.... forth time a charm hopefully
---
Oh, that's *all* you want? Just Bloodied Explosive Handmade? 
---
She's not giving you one of the best items in the game super quickly? Weird lol
---
Sigh. Energy weapons don't all do energy damage, nor only energy damage.
---
&gt; A lot of us got suspended
---
Really?  A lot?  What's a lot? 3? 300? 3000?  How do you know?
---
Base budget is locked.  To clear space, just bulk whatever you have too much of at a tinkerers bench and sell it off.
---
Melee weapons with high damage can either go the bloodied route or heavy two handed. Both of those can be highly specialized.
---
Crafting lots of ammo can be done with Ammo Smith and Super Duper.
---
Clearing space in stash box can either be heavy Ammo especially missiles, 40 mm grenades, fusion cores, and plasma cores. It could also be an excess of aid items. Sort by weight while in your stash under each tab to eliminate problem items quickly.
---
You can’t expand your build limit. It is what it is.
---
Been bugged since launch
---
Wouldn’t hold my breath
---
Currently leveling a second character, main is around 160 now, had no leveling achievements pop on him, lol
---
You know he was super stoked until he realized he didn’t have the strength to carry it all.
---
This. 
---
Learn how to build defenses.
---
Learn where enemies spawn at your camp.
---
Quit, thinking you're entitled to my ammo and services when you're trying to profit off me with your vending machines.
---
I generally do kill everything aggro'd towards me. But you are not entitled to demand that. You can ask nice. You can be humble. You, OP, if i see your camp on my server ... i'm kiting everything i can into overpriced crap. Just to remind you that courtesy is yours to give, not yours to demand.
---
No one wanted a Titanfall BR yet look at apex legends
---
You mean the radium rifle?
---
Maybe some day?? I'd rather they fix the bugs that are... you know... affecting gameplay. Maybe make it not such a torture for you to play? 😱
---
Yes. As is brahmin milk
---
Also, the higher level the weapon, the higher the base damage.  Then you mod the weapons to add more damage, armor piercing, bleed effect, etc...   Just look at the numbers when you're fooling with the weapons at your workbenches and see which mods you want.  Unlock more mods by scrapping that same weapon type.
---
I noticed that today - they were meatpiles - I was like hmm that guys right. I didn't get to science it but I wonder if you have to wait till they're meatpiles or if you van just go loot fresh bodies now.
---
Lol thx
---
BGS please nerf ghoul seduction .. it's driving libido crazy with all these sexy poses
---
  
---
Again, bollocks.
---
First off, it’s not being ‘entitled’ to highlight instances where game features are not achieving their design goals. If the goal of these challenges are, like daily challenges in every other “as-a-service” game, supposed to encourage people to log in every day – they are failing. As the posts here show, at the moment their main contribution is to annoy people already playing for other reasons.
---
Secondly, the characterisation of ‘atoms’ as free money is ridiculous, particularly if the implication is that atoms are actually worth the money paid for them. That’s amplified by how stingy the overall premium currency system is in this game. Free-to-play games like Warframe and Neverwinter offer players ways to directly convert their in-game currencies to premium currencies, and remain profitable – even without playing $60 up-front. 
---
Thirdly, Feedback isn’t complaining. Are there some people acting like entitled prats? Sure. But the bulk of people are just offering feedback – as you do if you think there’s room for improvement in a product you enjoy.
---
Lastly, I have a mostly positive view of the atom store at the moment, largely thanks to earlier (more balanced) challenges and the more recent habit of offering ‘free’ items along with the to-pay stuff. Having said that… it’s hard to argue that some of the paint jobs and costumes are both low effort and the sort of thing that really should be in the base game. This is Fallout, not Boarderlands or Destiny, and as such you’d expect specific uniforms to be findable in-game. It’s a bit silly that the ‘skull on a stick’ CAMP decoration is Atom-only.  
---
 As a general rule I think the more ornate items are fine as Atom items (power-armor with bits strapped on, pre-war CAMP items, ornate items (race car beds, etc), detailed weapon skins like the level-action rife with filigree, etc); but straight palette swaps and ratty/prewar items are better as unlockables.
---
FWIW, Fallout 76 is a significant improvement over Elder Scrolls online, which is a clusterfuck of monetisation options. You can’t earn crowns in game, there is a gameplay impacting subscription, lootboxes, paid DLCs and paid aesthetics. I can see how, given that precedent, the temptation is to push people away from earning in-game atoms. But customers are pickier about monetisation now, looter-shooters like Warframe show significantly more palatable monetisation methods and there is ever more competition (Destiny 2 very slowly is finding it’s legs, Division 2 was well received, Boarderlands 3 is coming and cd projekt red/Microsoft-funded Obsidian are going pushing into the single-player space).
---
These are the sorts of challenges I would be less surprised about if it were a free game – which actually makes me wonder if the rumours about going f2p are true and this is a trail run of the less friendly monetisation scheme.
---
He was at a workshop so he was able to learn what he did not know then stash the rest
---
Sorry to hear that.
---
I’m currently on break from this game, but I still browse the sub occasionally. This data is a sign that it’s not time to come back yet. Rewards for such an irritating risk and expenditure of ammo should be better!
---
Damn this still happens? Ugh that’s so unfortunate. 😖
---
Seems like you must have a really good affinity to that container/virtual (server).
---
Thanx,im buying them every chance i get when i see them at a camp vendor
---
Ah, gotcha
---
I keep trying but I always come up with garbage 3* from the purveyor.
---
Where is larry from fallout 2?! 🥳
---
Well get good and quit being a baby.
---
You need another flamer? I got you covered
---
I offered to 6 players overall all of them declined. none of them had mics all of them gave me thumbs down. so i dropped my entire inventory of extra suits at vault 76. now I am using that storage space to stock up on meds in my shop. med's are more universally used and I have helped / sold more now. 5 per on all meds and I have pharma pharma. )
---
&gt; I'm on console, and I'd rather not flush 200+ levels down the drain.
---
You claim you were suspended "near the beginning o the year".  You could have easily made back your "200+" levels since then if you were playing the game normally and not exploiting.
---
If ur on in an hour or so...I'll help u.....gt is same as name
---
There's a whole separate pvp mode for people now; and classic/adventure mode has no slap damage and the inability to destroy each other's camps - which means it's largely PvE now. There's still the odd troll, but they're pretty rare
---
You just said it. It’s heavy raider armor. There’s (light- not declared as light, just no label), sturdy, and heavy. That one is heavy.
---
I got 3 out of a camp for about 4k each two days ago...
---
Quit smoking crack.
---
Mysterious Todd.  We all get them mixed dw. 😝
---
Visited a camp and triggered the random encounter with the three scorchbeasts. Killed them, but not before they knocked down a bunch of walls lol
---
I keep free ammo stocked in my vending so people will remember to stop by my shop. Not all ammo mind you, mostly .44 10mm .38 Harpoons, Missles, etc. It's helped bring returning customers for sure.
---
I had one... but it's gone now... if I come across another one I'll keep you in mind. XB1?
---
Lol duh no, radium is not an energy weapon. You really don't know much?
---
Camden park cendor has excavator mods also
---
Ps4, forgot to tag. Ty for the advice, think i’m going to sell some of them day by day as a bait!
---
Oh, darn I'm ps4
---
I would be down with what you suggested. the current pvp is just dumb and i wont do it. what you suggest. I would do.
---
Damn sucks to suck huh?
---
Yep that I knew, but it's a bit difficult to farm enough. That grape will come handy.
---
Btw, it’s all heavy raider armor. None of it is robot or trapper armor. Left arm MIGHT be sturdy raider but the raider Armor has different looks for left and right- it’s not symmetrical
---
I sell them for 2 caps each when they start eating too much of my stash. I'm sure you could get more, but I bump into the 25k limit often and just want them gone.
---
But im using a heavy one right now and dont look like that. and i saw a player yesterday with that armor
---
That's what I'm talking about. I always wait for the name to pop up. It doesn't change the fact that when I which to a standard camera it triggers the respective challenge every time :/
---
Yes most of the torture was because of already existing event and gameplay glitches, not too enjoyable :(
---
Then you must be tallimg about the plasma rifle that is half and half. I am aware that the radium rifle isnt an energy weapon but I thiigh you might think it was. You're a pretty rude arent you?
---
I showed up to a camp near WS and there was a legendary ghoul attacking it with the owner no where in sight.
---
I took it as a sign and relieved the ghoul of his burden.
---
Dude had me rolling I  his PvP vid.  Fucking hysterical
---
No one wants to risk firing a weapon, Destroying some decorations &amp; having a bounty on their head.
---
Pretty sure the other guy is happy with his choice.  He wanted to kill you, not get a companion.
---
Watoga
---
My friend has all the luck - I've seen it too many times. we go to vendor hes like WOOHOO we go to west tech WOOHOO  we go to the burroughs WOOHOOO.  grr shut up all ready wood armor for days on my end.
---
Survival is already a BR but with respawn though
---
It was impressive.  7-8 players ranked in the high 250's to a singular player in the mind boggling mid 400 range.  ALL with variants of high end power armour (except the ones non PAing the SBQ) with paint schemes I haven't seen.  One SBQ came from the ground, was dropped to the ground almost immediately and killed in about 3:30 minutes. .... the only one that took over 5 minutes was one that flew away, and they just waited for her to return a small distance from the bunker so that when she did she would land immediately on top of them .... then .... DEAD.  And another Nuke warning.
---
Just letting you know that over the last two days I have been playing more than usual.   I had multiple sudden disconnects yesterday and this morning.   It seems to have stabilized now by doing two things:
---
updated my nvidia video driver to the latest, and 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
set compatibility mode on my Fallout76 executable (I launch from the shortcut, not the Bethesda launcher) to Windows 7.
---
it may not apply to you, but if are running Windows 10, it may help.
---
i played all afternoon up until about 30 mins ago without issue.
---
peace
---
I can build one for you for 2.5k caps.
---
Wow, your house is awesome! How long did it take you to make it?
---
Not everyone is American and shares the same patriotism for a country that you do. But I guess you’re too much of an idiot to realize that.
---
Travelled to a camp to buy items ...3 lvl80 scrorchbeasts were attacking. Banded together with the owner and 2 others to take them down. After they were killed I teamed up to rebuild the base and bought a few items. One of the beautiful things about the game and the reason I'm still playing is because of the player base and community. At least on PC most people seem to be incredibly helpful and nice to each other. I can't speak for the consoles but I'm sure they is just as good.
---
 It's nice to play a game where I feel like I'm helping people and I can get help in return it's an incredible environment and frankly the poor reception the game got originally when it launched I think is to blame in a good way. All the toxic players have left leaving only those people who are truly devoted to the idea of just a fun play through.
---
Honestly I really hate the pvp as it is. All of the fights I've been in I either kill the person in 1 to 2 hits or I die in 1 to 2 hits. It's never fair or rewarding to fight someone
---
Super Sledge only has the Heating Coil (and Heavy Rocket, but only on the All Rise) mod. The "Searing Heavy Sharp" mod you're talking about is for a Sledgehammer.
---
Thanks to everyone that posted will start looking round
---
Just use the radio then
---
The Brute of Calgary needs not for you to know his name.  He just wants your stuff
---
I’m done, lemme just buy the game lol
---
:( my bad i didn't see that.
---
And yup we are now something like 6 months in now and not a peep on mods aside from "use them and get banned" which is a crying shame as the best content for Fallout 4 and Skyrim where almost always to be found in mods as well as Qol and gameplay changes. It is not an overstatement to say that for some people the mods are the only reason those games are memorable and then we get Fallout 76 which has microtransactions so of course, Bethesda doesn't want people able to make items and release them within the modding community as ya know mods are free and you could also mod up your own skins (hell you could make the item look like that naturally)
---
Pete was my sloth he guarded the watermelon patch with a friendly smile but died due to a feral ghouls invasion. RIP pete. got a Deathclaw today and my camp has been moved to a lower level area. my new pet looks like it wants to eat me. and everything else. haven't given him a name yet.
---
That’s so cool, you got me hooked on it more
---
I had screen black issue today, rebooting my PC seemed to fix.
---
Check Wes Tek should have mutant hounds if that's what you're looking for.
---
Huh. All my cameras are 105mm, havent had issues. Oh! I’ve heard there IS a bug where if you have multiple cameras, the challenge only recognizes pictures taken with one camera.
---
Mmm. I’ll dig through my armor later.
---
Do the teapot daily.  I think most of those spawn there. Behemoth is supposed to spawn at twin lakes I think?  Maybe not twin lakes, but some lake.. can't remember .
---
You hot?
---
I rebooted a second time and it fixed!
---
Happens anyway.
---
I normally do, been a little bit since I played so maybe an update reverted it, idk this is the first asshole I ran in to in a few weeks. I'm just trying to point out this random person harassing people to other players just trying to do this mission, not trying to upset the  76 community.
---
Wait. I thought everybody used combat armor. What the heck do you use?
---
Its just a correlation, the gear is the best so the majority of people who actually want to PvP are going to have these items.
---
If you mean to say It's because I also play this game, I don't. I logged in for the first time in months to see if the updates improved the game. And you can't think of a less empty experience than Minecraft? He says about a game that's been one of the most popular in the world for 10 years now. Like just objectively you're wrong. I just wanted to have a little fantasy talk about features this game will never have, but you just came to be a dickhead.
---
that's not a thing anymore. bases are immune in adventure mode
---
Thanks for the advice :)
---
Inside Rusty Pick for a Super Mutant Hound.
---
That was the only reason i’ve never shot hostiles, Been off this game for awhile and i’ve never knew that bases are immune, Much appreciated.
---
Not in the ash heap region..
---
The problem is when one rare weapon is now being used by almost everyone.  The people who have the new exploding 8 shot laser rifle is having a great time and people who have worked hard for their one shot melee build gets shot down (me).  I don't care about dying in PvP but not to a team of goofs with the same op weapon.
---
I think you are right.
---
The pip-boy is fallout 4, also fallout 4 "grass".
---
Who are you to say ‘none of us’? You don’t fecking speak for me, you pleb.
---
Yeah, as I wrote, im server hopping rusty pick for nearly an hour now and I only get ghouls and robots. It’s driving me insane lol
---
Where did I say he’s American?
---
And it’s not about patriotism for a country. It’s about honoring those that made sacrifices to protect others.  
---
And what branch of which military in which country have you served?  Share with me your relevant wisdom and experience.
---
I don;t have the \*ability\* to do nuke runs, sadly. That achievement will always remain unfufilled. It's just too dang hard.
---
I have had one TSE and multiple Sent/ass cav/ass drop for me. I traded for everything else I have, through buying and selling. Once I had my gear set, I stopped farming hardcore for legendaries and did so just as a side to whatever else. It is not impossible to get legit drops, as well as trade for legit drops. 
---
Yes duping has increased the volume substantially, but all it has done is given people massive shortcuts to obtain their desired items. It is not the sole cause of god tier items existing, and if it weren't for the duping, the volume of complaints wouldn't be as high, and the TSE nerf, Demo nerf, Sent/Cav/Ass nerf would not have happened.
---
Then we would still have the problem, less people with it, but so much more overpowered.
---
It would be about as honest, unbiased, accurate as any other online review I imagine.
---
Let's just call it a no.
---
Lmao yeah
---
I fully expected that I did tbh, i was surprised when they didnt attack me.
---
do the new arkas event if u want loot drops. easier to kill and much more rewarding from a loot perspective. there are 3* high level random creatures that appear. I've gotten 3 * max level in a run.
---
That sounds awesome! And way better than the current PvP system
---
Fo76 photos
---
Can... Can I join !?!?!?1/
---
Same here got robots and ghouls all day long
---
What going on Yelp is all those legendaries the bots helped you pull? ;)
---
I hope, and have a little faith that Bloodied won't be nerfed, because to get the power levels, you have to invest ALOT, most people don't understand this. They think you just throw on a bloodied weapon and whoop ass. No. You need the defensive measures, as well as all of the offensive synergies (adrenal, nerd rage, radicool, unyielding) depending on range or melee. 
---
They have also already nerfed explosive alot by gutting demo expert. So I hope they don't go any further on that...
---
Loved the one quest where you find a raider leader turned scorched, and he's just covered in raider armor and looks cool af, wish there were more unique enemies like him...
---
Praise Atom
---
Jealous. I really want a two shot limb damage combat shotty
---
I tried to correct a simple small error you made. Instead you kept insisting on it.
---
&gt;Then you must be talking about the plasma rifle
---
What do you "then"? I clearly referred to plasma rifle as the other energy weapon that applies for the distinction. If you'd know what you talk about, you would have realized no later than when I mentioned an energy weapon doing not only energy damage.
---
What about you? Is it polite to you, to insist on details when even plasma rifle didn't occur to you?
---
That I leave for you to ponder. This is not going anywhere, and I will not see any replies.
---
i lowered the price after looking around some more =D
---
He’s making better sacrifices to the RNG gods.
---
I wish I could build over fallen trees and what not. My foundation is on stilts and it's a God dang log. Let me put my house down.
---
Finally got mutants inside, but no mutant dog. That’s it. I’m quitting before this shit drives me insane
---
Comment.
---
Subpardeity
---
Revert. U cant trade atomic shop items
---
&gt;Odd that it would be even an option of on energy weapons if it doesn’t work. 
---
No, it's just a bug. It's not intended not to work.
---
You can't trade with atomic shop stuff. :-(
---
Ok bud. Hope you feel accomplished and somehow better about yourself. Bye now.
---
I don't need to prove anything that a reasonable person should already know. 
---
Sentinel/ass, despite the nerf making it even easier to counter, still does and always could die to vats headshots. And any low health build will be killed by a sneeze getting through the defenses.
---
Stealth, and real world combat tactics, can get the upper hand on anybody. I'm talking stealth. Patience. Planning ahead. The other ways to PvP people, than running into the open and getting mowed down.
---
‘Skill’ in a game with VATS. Uh, ok
---
How many months after release day? Took way too long and punished the owner 100% before it was fixed.
---
😠
---
What area of the map are you in?
---
I don't think they do buddy it would be cool to have a high of one though it is a shame
---
No, it hasn't fixed yet and I haven't dedicated time to taming another one. Thanks for caring though! I want a Deathclaw again like my first tame. Just hopefully higher than level 21; my mirelurk king was 30.
---
That sucks, man. In wich platform do you play?
---
Lvl 20 is the max
---
Damn... I just equipped a flamer and long bow bar on a lvl 20 one I found. Gave it to my friend. He’s absolutely loving it
---
People are allowed to criticize it, but "this game is shit" isn't criticism
---
Well Whitesprings gave me a nice complimentary package of level 40ish gear: a 1* Auto Grenade Launcher and a 2* lvl40 hachet.  They tried at least.
---
Oooh okay. Well thanks! Then I got a max lvl one already XD
---
As of today. I think that happened when they made camps invincible
---
Cranberry Bog, sometimes drops off high level legendary
---
I think people just don't like that for PVP there really are just a few really useful builds, and to really be successful you kind of have to follow those set paths. When I PVP I got with a silenced rifle build with chameleon/marsupial so that I can hide on roofs/trees/cliffs to ambush.
---
Take a look at this post for a level guide on the map regions

It's fate, baby, it's fate.
---
I killed a three star yesterday and got nothing. Bethesda hasn’t been the best at loot tables. I still get drills and stringers but they claimed that they fixed that lol. At least give me a legendary drill.
---
Been playing since Jan,  
---
Ive only seen one chainsaw - its around level 20,  there’s also 2 mods I’ve found
---
Long bar and flamer attachment,
---
Have not seen plans,
---
Yeah we were able to get flora from picking it - just miss the extras we get you know.
---
I don't understand why report someone's name in the first place. My gamer tags are not offensive in anyway but shouldn't it be just like TV? You don't like it change the channel? Simply change servers or travel away from said name. It's the same as people who call cops on a band practicing at 3 in the afternoon. Don't pee in other people's Cheerios. Don't ruin others fun because you aren't having any. What's in a name.... Eh?
---
A variety. My camp is based near the overseers and currently trying to complete top of the world.
---
Yeah I always stash mine too- never carry it on me D: we just went from the queen straight to watoga station and it was gone
---
I got mutants at the junkyard then I got the mutant dog to chase me into the ash heap. He started to turn around before we got inside the ash heap, but I shot him with my explosive shotgun into the area and got my picture
---
You sure you're not missing one more? Bloat fly?
---
I get that at times, as in completely no loot at all.  I've also heard some claim that you need to do some percentage damage. I'm fairly sure it hasn't been so before, although mechanism like that would make sense. But it should be big enough chance to be in patch notes.
---
Neat!
---
u/cpwhitie
---
A bloodied explosive handmade will kill you just as quick, as will a Bloodied explosive gauss rifle, I have all of these so I have firsthand experience. Yes the laser rifle, and it's the Bloodied explosive variants that are top tier, are extremely good weapons, but they break incredibly fast, and have zero armor penetration. Yes even anti armor one has none, the affix is bugged with energy damage, it only applies to ballistic.
---
The weapon is powerful, but not outclassing everything else. Any build utilizing a good set of perks, and a decent rifle, is capable of putting someone down pretty quick, the legacy weapons are just fun, and highly effective don't get me wrong, but not better than anything else.
---
Also the explosive gatling plasmas and flamer/cryolators are just as bad ass of weapons. It is not just the laser rifles.
---
Okay good to know. 
---
Thanks!
---
Those are the mods I equipped as well. I just HAD to see it with my own eyes XD
---
Batteries included makes them weigh like .05# each or some nonsense. I carry all my fusion cores with me all the time and like 18,000 fusion cells
---
Wut
---
Brilliant thanks.
---
If you ever see me feel free to send a team invite to sneak on by!  For some reason I make these things and then warn people who walk up.  The fast travelers are toast.  My logic is lost.
---
Oh, I guess so? What picture, all I see is a youtube link?
---
Got a bloat fly just in front of the rusty pick on the street. Super lucky, since this is a spawn point where all sorts of things can spawn. But here’s a tip I read on another thread: craft a bloatfly syringer and shot with at an enemy. Will spawn one instantly
---
It could be but I’m almost always the highest damage dealer, whether that’s on my main or mini main. I know sometimes you have to fast travel away and come back. That usually gets it to show up for me. Lately it hasn’t worked on free ranged events and it only happens on that event for me. It’s still a decent event, even if the loot is messed up.
---
I'm loving my scout armors :) no complaints here! 😁
---
Ya not specially bloody wepons, but it would be nice to send stuff between characters, my main and although could definitly do with abit of gear trading.
---
Mole miner gauntlets are almost as good and easy to find.
---
That's just it though, you choose damage for your weapon(s) of choice, or you take qol perks, it is not hard to optimize for PvP combat, or combat in general. If you want to invest in perks to carry more, pay less to travel, help friends, etc. That's great and fine. I think build diversity is great in PvE, and team up, do whatever, but you cannot expect to compete in combat versus a player that has specced into combat over qol.
---
Team based PvP is a whole other, and interesting story.
---
At least you can’t do it at the resort anymore. I purposely went out of my way to destroy bases and the player until they left the server. The only annoying thing you posted is those rocket turrets. It wouldn’t be so bad if it didn’t shake the screen so much.
---
Oh I'm not arguing about the effectiveness of other weapons, I'm just tired of seeing the SAME weapon.  I just want to be killed by shit the farmed themselves and not this stupid gun.  It's just freaking everywhere, except my stash lol.
---
Haha that’s a hilarious tip. Yeah kinda a long shot since it takes a while to get in the ash heap region  from there
---
Just ran into this bug (immortal enemies) for the first time since launch.
---
I've been fortunate enough to not have had many bugs occur to me. This one though...., this one is annoying. I hope it gets REPATCHED really soon.
---
FYI - I'm a stealth build for the most part. I do run around in power armor, but I prefer ranged weapons. Anyway, today I used an automatic tesla rifle for the first. Immediately after, I ran into this bug. Not sure what the cause was, but it is the first energy aoe that I've used.
---
Hmmmm they shake the screen eh?  Interesting... Like a stagger or just a visual?
---
Game's set in 'murrica, thus 'murrican themed event.
---
Am not 'murrican either, but you can practice the "not be a dick randomly" method too
---
Sup
---
Just a visual. You have to be relatively close for it to shake. It’s not nearly as bad as the Sam sites.
---
Already knew that I was saying the friendly animal was attacking me. I couldn't heal myself, kill all adds, keep alpha sheepsquatch off of friendly animal that was attacking me in top of all that I was simply waiting for more people to join event when a team of 3 idiots jumped in and started it, offered 0 help during event and of course it failed. Was just asking if the friendly animals had ever attacked others before as explained above.
---
I use pneumatic on my chest piece, so I never stagger.
---
I’ll take your word for it
---
I need that for my big falls.  I always stop for a moment so people can shoot me.
---
Little suggestion, check and see if there are any events in the general area that you're heading for. If there's a few higher level players out there, you might want to delay that particular area for a while. However, the higher look level enemies give you better xp, so the choice is yours.
---
I have a dual chainsaw mod
---
😻
---
How many rads does this give you?
---
Yes they do, as I explained.
---
They actually did (do?). Jones Soda made a Nina Cola Quantum. You can find it on amazon, but it’s expensive.
---
PS4 ? If so what's your name?
---
Also if I actually needed help with the friendly part that was the worst description of shutdown I have ever seen. Thankfully I have known that since day one. Again friendly was attacking me the player
---
I hated turret bases at the springs... Too many ghouls
---
Xbox sry
---
I usually try to help if I can. I spawned in at someone's camp yesterday that was overrun with Green Meanies (no relation to the blue variety). At least, it's always the neighborly thing to do.
---
I've heard that stats cap at 76 with additions such as unyielding or consumables. Forgot where I heard it though
---
I second the mole miner gauntlet. They're fairly readily available at player vendor shops, I see at least one or two people selling them on almost every server.
---
Didn't know shut down made them attack you as it never happened to me before
---
2 blades?? Even better man. Gotta get that
---
Found that Milk of Kindness
---
Normally I just keep the spawns off stuff hopping around while others jump straight for the alpha. I'll take completion over my one star poolcue
---
I do, and I repair items if I have the mats. I enjoy helping!
---
You monster
---
have you tried re installing your game?
---
really?  damn
---
You're a cheater and I'm reporting you to Todd Howard.
---
Strange done that event a hundred times never notice them attacking me. Maybe I was to engrossed trying to get people to help keep friendly alive instead of boss kill
---
Found one at Mothman statue
---
I’m not sure that it works for falling. I still get it when I jump off something that birdbones says is to high.
---
But if someone offered you one, you would take no? And probably use, because it's a great weapon. 
---
You can't fault people for being able to finally obtain these "legacy" weapons, and enjoying themselves. A month ago they were selling for 100k+ and nobody except high end traders, and people who didn't know what they had, were holding these weapons.
---
Duping is shitty and sucks, but for this specific archetype of weapons, it was the only way for many people to EVER obtain one, who knows if Bethesda will poof all legacy weapons or what, but these folks didn't care if it was duped, it was a weapon now selling for 15k-20k and very obtainable through trading. 
---
These guys bought them because they ceased an opportunity that wont be there ever again, since they supposedly fixed the dupe method, I don't dupe and never have, I am well aware that my laser rifle is duped most likely, but I love laser weapons, and they removed them before they were good, then inadvertently buffed all of the weapons far later, increasing value substantially, because they could compete, and in some cases exceed other popular "top tier" weapons in damage potential, as well as durability.
---
Tried that and it takes a while
---
Got mine in a regular storm but had to take a pic of an enemy
---
Hmm?
---
Don’t think I can do that at lvl 73
---
Ok ty
---
Went the same route. Only the food portion, unfortunately. I ended up taking two levels of the Dromedary perk to balance out the effects.
---
Ouch.
---
If that were the case then why does the left forest scout version have the same stats as the right? I’m pretty sure it’s just bugged like a bunch of other things, like I said not a huge issue it just kinda bothers me that a bug like this is still getting ignored is all. I love my scout armor, that’s why I think it’d be cool if they just fixed that minor issue at some point.😁
---
Okay ty
---
I say they should buff the explosive weapons for pvp too weak in my opinion a person with a explosive gun should just look at you and you should instantly die.
---
Lol all jokes aside yea it’s broken that’s why I never play survival.
---
I want a disciples cutlass real bad.
---
I just ran into that thing last night, that would be kinda cool. A custom message , so that the next time the targeted player phases into the open world, Insult Bot teleports nearby and sends an insult lmao. Or just waits at your CAMP insulting everyone who comes by LOL
---
Fyi, a regular sledgehammer with one of the heavy rocket mods out-damages a super sledge with the heating coil.
---
😁👍
---
I found a player vendor that was selling 15 of them.
---
I went to grafton steel and just FARMED so hard but thank you I’ve done uranium fever a lot and it’s great for legendaries
---
Dont speak for everyone. I am a big Fallout fan, a Fallout 76 fan as well. And I for one would LOVE a slower paced, survival Battle Royale mode where everyone starts out the same. It would remind me a lot more of the original Battle Royale movie. So just be eyes YOU dont want a battle royale, please dont speak for everyone.
---
Why do you sound so mad?
---
Yea you’re right and I didn’t know the Forest was fine in the post I thought you meant both forest and urban were bugged
---
They actually don't do much damage in pvp. most of the damage is negated by perks and armor mods. If you don't have that, well, maybe you shouldn't pvp. It's like trying to fight in a war without a rifle
---
it's a 20% bonus. bloodied + adrenal is 200% for comparison.
---
I don't know where you're getting your information but explosive has been crap for months now. it's only good for staggering sentinels/cavaliers.
---
I got all tools for the critter challenge... just easier to find everything when ya got someone helping
---
It’s definitely Camden park vendor
---
I may not bother then 🤔
---
I'm glad you agree!
---
I like that I can run anywhere I want and not get that horrid random tripping.
---
Nice! When I see these CAMPS posted I feel quite embarrassed by the plain rectangle that is mine.
---
I found a legendary supermutant but it wouldn’t count for the picture, not sure why.  I’m missing 2, the same ones as you.
---
And get rewarded with a bounty because a single bullet nicked a plant?
---
No thanks
---
Shit I find em all the time on mole miners and scorch in the ash heap recently... xbox
---
Lucky, codes expired as I was clearing the silo lol
---
That’s great! I just don’t see why it’s a big deal to fix something that isn’t working the way it should is all..Scout armor is still fantastic even with that minor issue, but at the same time I don’t think fixing one armor pieces DR to its correct value is a difficult fix. 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
I keep getting garbage heavy weapons
---
..
---
Yup I should just let players destroy my camp and steal resources from my team and never defend it. You have opened my eyes to a whole new world.
---
Has anyone seen it from any of the Enclave events?  You get a lot of 1\* Combat Armor from BoS events.
---
Haha yeah, I did eventually figure this out after being spawned inside another locked camp. But I'm still salty about that first time. I lost so much lead, plastic, and steel.
---
Grafton also, in the town.
---
The white springs vendor in the book store also.
---
Deluxe ones?
---
anything is usable/op when you rely on the bloodied and/or sneak mechanics.
---
which is not necessarily good game design. let's just hope they don't nerf them next so we're back to shooting pea guns.
---
 If it makes you happy then you shouldnt be embarrassed
---
It's special legendary. I didn't know it can be found on treasure. I've got it few times.
---
Before legendary scrapping it used to display it's effects as stars.
---
I think they are still there, but it no longer displays the effects. I think they were assassins weightless. I have mine maybe 100 caps but players who've played longer, don't want one, too low level ect. And lower levels might not know what it's effects are. But at least they would see the weight and damage, I guess.
---
I hear ya, let's hope they start to make sweeping changes more and more down the road ;) either way, I'm having a great time with this game (bugs be damned) haha
---
I do, I just feel like it would be a nice improvement.
---
You have to remove the atomic shop paint before trading. Dropping it painted destroys it
---
Killing everything I see. I think Fallout76 players are all supposed to be exp-suckers lol
---
No it’s just the left urban scout arm that has this weird bug where it provides like 12 less DR than the right arm. It’s really not a huge deal but just looking at my mismatched armor stats bugs me for some reason. 😂
---
THIS! Like if you'd be in real life post apocalyptic world, would you build a damn house all by yourself or move into existing empty house that only needs to board some windows and little rearranging of furnitures? I think Bethesda should at least consider adding few dozen empty houses for this purpose.
---
26
---
Badda boom baby
---
What is you talking about? Get them mods and perks then fight back! Don't be a beta, fight back and win
---
the point is that you shouldn't pvp if you don't have fireproof and dense. it's your own fault.
---
then again, results would probably be the same with or without the explosive mod. people here want to jump in pvp wearing full excavator and weight reduction perks and still be successful.
---
Building a base close to where mobs spawn so one can get the loot without doing the work seems awfully lazy and also inconsiderate of other players, in my opinion.
---
&gt;I have been making post the past couple days with 1 cap ammo. Finally gave it all away today to some random lv 12.
---
There are only a handful of ammo types worth 1c or more. In my experience, people will buy 308, 45, 556, plasma rounds, and shells for 1c. Plasma Cores for 25 seems fair given the crafting cost.
---
If you have space in your stash, people will buy missiles for 3-5 and mini nukes for 8-10, but I'm tight on space so I just drop them at someone else's shop and let them deal with it.
---
I’m not really happy with it. Partly the location doesn’t lend itself to good aesthetics. I need to look for a better spot.
---
Yup I was wondering why they have been showing up.. I guess alot of people keep messing theirs up...
---
Yep they are everywhere. Loot containers.
---
Wish I could get ride of the 6 I have from loot spamming.
---
The veterans in my life can’t stand when people wish them a happy Memorial Day. They find it offensive. Even if most don’t feel this way, I’d rather play it safe and thank them any other day of the year.
---
As for the 'how' to keep low, yes, Rads. Which is why having "Radicool" perk is a no-brainer, since you get +5 STR for your troubles. The benefit there is two fold: 1) you gain +25 carry capacity from the +STR, 2) you get a nice boost to melee/unarmed damage, which with a bloodied weapon there is a nice way to easily farm stuff and save ammo
---
I'm someone who "just plays" with Bloody items, and don't really have a "build" catered to it, to really maximize everything as I could (and maybe should). What I can say though, is that if you mainly use guns... combine with Sneak's 2x, you rarely have to deal with much. With the exception of 3\* Legendaries an the end-game event bosses, you don't generally get into situations where you need to heal. 
---
Inside the events, I need to wear PA or I generally won't survive long. Ultracite has the best DR, pretty sure T-60 has the best Rad Resist, and X-01 falling kinda inbetween but I think has better ER (not positive). Excavator is just flat out meh except for the fact you get +100 carry with a full set, and another +100 with Calibrated Shocks on both legs.
---
Again, I don't play it with any proper build... I mainly have it setup to cater to just how I play, which is mainly to maximize carry capacity, with focus on Rifles. Currently, with all my weight saving and armor/perks, I am literally a traveling arsenal of legendary weapons and armor that I'm waiting to exchange for Scrip. That being said, I also use Adrenal Reaction and Rank 1 of Bloody Mess and with that: my Bloodied Gauss does roughly 500-550dmg (if I make it Prime, it'll do 580-6?0dmg), my Bloodied Power Fist does 470-511dmg, my Bloodied Lever Action 320-365dmg, and Bloodied Railway does the same +10dmg. 
---
If I rocked a proper build, I don't even want to know how crazy things would get lol
---
On average, I give away or sell TONS of Stimpacks, as I just find way way more than I use, unless I'm in a nuked Whitespring zone... that'll drain me in a few hours out of my Stims (I usually keep 30-40 on me).
---
No mobs spawn here
---
Are you on xbox by any chance?
---
And ready to throw down for you, I’m sure. 🙄
---
No, PS4
---
It's such a violent lurch to a stop when randomly walking
---
Lol yea Ik what you mean. If it was the case with the forest doing the same I would’ve said Bethesda probably thought too much into detail with a new armor set compared to the old ones in Fo4
---
You don’t have to be an American or idiotic to find him comment as rude as it was intended... but hey, let’s throw some more insults around.
---
Thanks for the intel. I only became Wanted once, after shooting down and opening the container. If there were any important details, I don't recall them. But ever since, if I shoot down a container, I check, and it always says "steal from" with no name. So I assume that I'd be Wanted like last time.   
---
Still, not a big deal to get Unwanted: divest my junk and let someone kill me. I just wish destroying the vertibots and shooting down the container would \_reward\_ me, somehow.
---
Yea I agree. I can understand once in a great while but it happens entirely to much.
---
Yeah I was finding heaps of broken ones even before I got the quest. At durst I was exited but then found out until you get the quest you can't do them up in the tinkers bench
---
Every weapon I get with terrible traits always seem to be one of the heaviest guns that can drop, too. Handmades, broadsiders, gatling lasers.
---
Wait... I thought a model without a texture is a Mesh..
---
Colorful undergarments and the feather necklace!
---
Came here for a Charlie mention, was not disappointed.
---
&gt;OMW!!!!!! I'm a level 9 so I am still getting used to things. So far I think I am gonna do rifles. This is my first serious play through
---
What system are you on? If you're on xbox I'll make you a level 10 brotherhood recon sniper rifle and some armor to get you started. All I ask is that you pay it forward once you get big and strong.
---
Is the fridge upgrade pretty good? It's what I've been working on getting...
---
That's right, and the Liberator robots run off of Huawei chargers
---
Yeah that’s a another problem... I don’t even look for legendaries since they never trigger.
---
Yeah check lockers and sometimes ghouls. I think they have a heap spawn so people can set up cameras with different lenses
---
FYI: 3 ranks in class freak means you can eat meat again.
---
Oh yeah of course, the game is 10x better than when it first came out and I know right now there’s less bugs than there have ever been in this game. I play daily now and I love it, can’t wait to see what they add especially if they actually do end up adding some Npc’s with that massive story expansion in fall. 😁
---
I don't know if tames can get higher than level 30, I had tamed a level 76 Scorched Yao Guai and the game set it to 16 when we got back to my camp, ended up being killed by a Scorchbeast.
---
Oh it’s by no means the only route but with the right perks and Chr level you can pull 300+ caps a day on the omelettes alone.
---
You’ll need super duper as well.
---
A boosted luck stat to help proc it more often too.
---
Well if your looking for aesthetics i would try the savage divide or you could try under the bridge in harperys ferry its a pretty cool spot its where my camp before was located but you have to watch out for the mirelurks
---
You dont need the legendary, use the others, legendary does not work anyway.
---
I found a small camp near bleeding Kate’s , had all the bugs for that challenge in the same spot.
---
Also Deathclaws you didn’t kill do not count.
---
Wow such an adult thing to say
---
It’s still there. I have a spicy mirelurk king at my camp.
---
Earlier today I got a 3s exterminator broadsider with +1 INT and +10% damage while aiming. That 20lb piece of shit went right back into the machine.
---
It's a sign that you are destined... to forever have bad legendary drops.
---
The bitch gave me a rolling pin.
---
Are there and legendary plain sledgehammers?
---
For modding?
---
Holy cow!!!!  :)
---
Hell can you imagine making your way through the glasses cavern and those suits of power armor start getting up?
---
I tested it with many weapons and it's very inconsistent. for some weapons, it stacks to like 10 stacks and some others only stack for like 5 or 6 times. Still have no idea how this prefix works
---
I'm still digging it. A small farm at my camp keeps me fed for a long while. Tato and mutfruit perks make them worth using for topping off hydration.
---
I’ve stopped using the salt perks altogether and my goods are lasting as long as I need them.
---
Buy 2 star weapons until you find something awesome that fits you build. You get twice as many rolls.
---
Once you have something awesome, start buying 3 stars and scrip or sell them to finance your 3 star god roll weapon.
---
I've got, like, 30 of the dang things. I \*wish\* I could give them away.
---
I've yet to even try the salt perk out. Sorry to bug ya, but how long do you guess your goods last with the fridge?
---
What a well mannered, humble and entirely not self congratulatory post.
---
This right here. Theres no communication anongst random strangers. That isn't how you behave in real life, the would say some thing like "how's it going?" And you would say "welcome to my shop, blah blah blah."
---
I got the three building tasks to mark off, but neither playing the different types of instruments, or playing at The Nukashine, will check off. Guess I'm working on the other ones then.
---
Wood
---
Cool thanks!
---
Haha yeah it sucks
---
Just note, if they were to do this all the boarded house, your load times, server lags, and space required goes up.
---
I literally ran through the silo when I saw the time. Destroying mainframe cores so fast I had to stop and wait for the server to realize they were blown up before it would take down the grid. I think we had 2 minutes to spare honestly. The nuke had just touched down when they expired.
---
Quit whining, it’s part of the game.
---
Fireproof in the endurance tree.Dense mod on a chest piece
---
Haha yeah
---
Fireproof perk and dense combat armor.
---
RNG gods want you to use it haha
---
Fireproof, Adamantium Skeleton, Dense torso mod.
---
It's not necessarily the explosions that kill you though. Normally the difficulty with melee is getting near people before they just VATS-crit you in the head.
---
Fireproof and dense mod armor for explosive weapons. Maybe someone more verse in PVP can add to that.
---
Did you try multiple pics of the deathclaw? I always take pics of the ones at fissure sites that i didnt kill and it always counts but sometimes takes a couple tries
---
Lol of course. Wouldn’t insinuate you wish them a “happy” anything. Most vets are disgruntled about the military enough as is. I hate being thanked for my service. Nothing glorious about what goes on for the most part. Just not a fan of these “days” for things. The best thing you can do to thank anyone who sacrifices or is willing to sacrifice their life for us is love the best damn life you can. No point in dying for a world where the people are only thankful a few days out of the year. Best to always love your best life and continue to try to be better for all of those who can’t.

The mesh is the 3D model points and data. Textures are pretty much the visuals applied to it, an image wrapped on it
---
What is the best level for the fireproof card? I am not familiar with it.
---
I wrote down what I’m missing, so I’m good on the bugs besides blood ticks. Did they also spawned there? And dead deathclaws do count, Wörner totally fine for me.
---
my only problem with pvp at the moment besides the issues of power imbalance, is that i dont feel it fits the lore, i personally feel that until we have some form of faction allegiance it doesnt really make sense. we all supposedly lived together for 25 years in the vault, with the expectations of going out and reclaiming america and rebuilding and i dont see how leaving vault 76 to rebuild, only to go be the overseer of a different vault makes sense. perhaps others have thoughts on how to rectify that without faction allegiances? i feel if we had factions it makes perfect sense, have the factions battle it out to see which gets control of the vault and its precious self sustainability or whatever.  as of now i honestly cant see how a battle royale type mode would make sense lore wise. not that i think its a bad idead\\ to have there be a trial by combat type scenario, but what would the motivations be for being the new overseer? if you are going to hold up in a vault then we arent rebuilding america and why didnt we just make 76 work? but there is that zax computer so maybe it manipulates us some way into fighting eachother?? of course any outrage over this is probably a little naive as youve said its not even out and we have absolutely no idea how they will be implementing it. peoples minds are leaning towards a pubg fortinite style battle, which if thats the case i still firmly believe it makes no sense. but thats all just speculation at this point so im not gonna worry too much.
---
Aside from the lore aspect i really like your idea of loadout vendors. even the playing field and nobody should have any real reason to complain from a balance perspective.
---
SFE?  You mean GFE?
---
Where can I get dense combat armor? Is it a mod?
---
Spawn in, get shot twice by an explosive lmg, die. Yup its totally crap... oh wait my explosive shotgun I have does almost 600 damage with addrenal and explosive rounds and my max health is 268. 
---
Explosive rounds 20% damage buff + 60% damage buff if you have demolition expert on + 60% if you run full damage perk cards for your gun type + 20% damage buff for nerd rage + about 145% damage buff for addrenal at 18% health or lower + bloodied (assuming they have that too) 100% damage buff when below 20% health + 15% damage buff for bloody mess.
---
With my explosive bloodied combat shotgun running all these perks brings the total damage (dependent on the mods for the gun) to 491 damage a shot. Still above most players health. PvE is amazing PvP it's over powered and broken, that's why I just run a 1\* bloodied pump shotgun that does 274 damage in PvP after I realised how unfair and broken explosive weapons are.
---
New boss enemy: lvl 100 3 star scorhed general with power armor minus the helmet and one or two armor pieces.
---
I’m not sure what level you unlock it. But it goes up to rank three which is maybe 45% explosive and fire resistance.
---
Yeah, the dense is a mod to the combat armor.
---
By doing a small quest with the rusty key
---
@ what price mostly?
---
Some of my first disappointments were no longer having visuals to cripple, and having none for diseases and mutations. Not to mention Melee having no special kill animations anymore.
---
Maybe you can try ninja and stealthboy, which may be of help in the battle.
---
SFE being a mod for 76.
---
5% per hit, stacks to 9. The rest is not fully tested, but it looks like the effect of each hit expires after 10 seconds and the bonus is probably transferable between targets.

For the legendary I just stumble on to a legendary sheepsquatch close to mount Blair workshop

Do you know of any good places to start looking for it?

Every time I see something like this I think of the [One Day Long Career of Microsoft Tay AI](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-microsofts-tay-ai-bot-went-wrong/)...
---
“...Less than a day after she joined Twitter, Microsoft's AI bot, Tay.ai, was taken down for becoming a sexist, racist monster.”
---
I personally love your suggestion in spirit, but I really think our friendly neighborhood griefers and idiots would ruin it in no time.
---
Plant a bunch of melons.  They provide water as well as food.
---
Glad it works for you, have been tempted to download it myself, but with my luck standard I'd be banned 5 minutes afterwards. XD
---
100 caps ea.
---
In that case why do people always want legendary super sledges instead of sledgehammers
---
I have Level 3 Covert and Escape Artist.  
---
I haven’t found any good/legendary sniper rifles or rifles in general.  I just use a level 50 .50 brotherhood rifle.  102 dmg. Fire rate 3.    Can’t one shot anything over like 40th level.  And often takes forever to do much of anything damage-wise. 
---
I don’t have the Bloody Mess or rifle perks tho.  Had focused on utility stuff.  Cause the damage buff of each of those things seems so small.  10% here doesn’t do that much versus a second shot.  ?
---
I died trying to defend a scorched wave at someone's house.  A little disappointed
---
I kill enemies if they are attacking a players camp. I often repair the turrets if I have the parts as well.
---
I agree. I went to a mission and they're were level 68+ enemies. I looked on the map and in my area was high level players and there camps. I jumped server and went back to that mission with no high levels in sight! Enemies were back to normal. Now I look in the area before i do any missions

PS4
---
Great explanation.  Was actually comparing two Weapons I have already and understand that primary, secondary affects.  What you answered was perfect.  My TSE is greater than my MS.  And I’d likely not seek out an MSE since the TSE is so good all around. 
---
Thanks!!
---
Watoga I think but you should read up on it on reddit. There are some good posts already.
---
Stash is 800. Needs management but it’s doable. 
---
Yes to answer your first query.
---
Just look up inside the vault and scroll through all the issues since you stopped playing
---
Modding a shotgun for longer range, along with Enforcer, makes this extremely easy.  
---
It's also fun to force a vertibot to stop on a rooftop and then beat on it with a hammer.  Well, until it explodes.  Then it's not quite as fun.
---
why would you even buy armor when you have a chance to get a bugged piece. wait for them to fix that shit.
---
I believe I said that, I should have said it more clearly though, thanks for the video!
---
Some say right now is the best time to buy, so that you can take advantage of the new updates limited time early bird bonus. Those who clear the games newest mode called "arktos assassin" before it comes out of beta are instantly boosted to max level (999) with maxed perk points and all perk cards. It is very hard though. Arktos assasin is FO76s answer to the BR craze, but with a new spin. You enter a lobby of 100 contestants, and when the timer ends it becomes a free for all, except it is played in real life. The game uses location data provided by your console to pinpoint the location of every player and then sends that information to every other contestant. You have to hunt each other down. You defeat another player by destroying their console, which is the only way for it to stop broadcasting location data. To stop people from just camping at their console for home advantage, you have to be carrying it with you and if your console pings you at the same location for more than 10 minutes you are disqualified. Welcome to the wasteland.
---
Top of the World and Whitesprings are extremely dangerous because any nearby player can scale the enemies to max level. I'd recommend giving the quests a break and go do some side quests and events in the Toxic Valley and Ash Heap.
---
I'd rather it just used character names and the current top of screen health bar when looking at a player was just " (account name) Player name" and view-able when from map/friend list. And maybe a faction icon if that ever becomes relevant. I don't see a need to extend the size of the one above your head in-game.
---
Right now is a great time to come back to the game its doing better performance wise and content wise.
---
I think it depends. Have you heard the BOS recorded messages in Watoga? The voice acting is terrible.
---
&gt;Spawn in, get shot twice by an explosive lmg, die. Yup its totally crap...
---
that's how it is with most weapons, not just explosive ones. a proper specced builds can do wonders.
---
&gt;oh wait my explosive shotgun I have does almost 600 damage with addrenal and explosive rounds and my max health is 268. 
---
you said it yourself, with adrenal and bloodied. it's not the explosive part that's getting your the extra 500 damage.
---
&gt;[formula]
---
everything you just typed, bar demo expert, applies to non-explosive weapons as well. and last I checked, demo expert **5** added *less* damage than shotgunner **1** to my explosive shotgun.
---
&gt;491 damage a shot. Still above most players health. PvE is amazing PvP it's over powered and broken.
---
this post only shows how clueless you are about pvp- just like the majority of people in this sub. first, survival dampers damage. so 100 or 100K damage, it'll take roughly the same number of shots to down someone in survival. second, any half-decent pvper will be running some sort of %DReduction because everyone knows end, hp and regular DResist is useless in Fo76. third, no serious pvper is running bloodied builds in pvp any more, not since the sen/cav nerf, and you can't get obscenely high numbers without it.
---
but most importantly, fireproof + dense all but negates explosive damage. literally. get off your excavator and plan your survival build instead of complaining.
---
I assume it works exactly as intended with explosive: the stack resets if the bullet misses. If you just hit an enemy with the explosion, that's only dealing the 20% damage of the explosion, not the gun damage. It shouldn't continue the furious proc if you miss
---
No? It's been established in 76 that some of the Super Mutants were female victims of fev. So... no; Green gynecological exam photos won't do. ;)
---
Send me a friend request my GT is my username smilepixeleyes 😇
---
Not sure how consistent it is, but I for some reason seem to run into a sheepsquatch pretty often at the overseers house near the Welch train station, behind you and to the left when you spawn, so possibly a quick legendary.
---
The worst is the fucking scorchbeasts. Sometimes I'll get 3 or 4 spawned and because I'm a melee player I can't do jack shittttt
---
A Mr. Buzz blade furious I swear doesn't stop stacking. It probably does but man that shit is crazy
---
Sure, I have an Instigating one in my store on PC. I don't recall seeing a sledgehammer with more than one star, but given that you can get three star boards and pool cues, there's probably no limiter.
---
I've gotten so bad over the last few years I developed a facial tic anytime someone thanks me for 'my service'...  
---
It was uncomfortable at first, however now it seems to keep the same person from doing it twice, so silver lining?
---
Seeing is believing.
---
Take a video where the low level pipe rifle raider wins the legendary weapon player.
---
You must prove that you are not a big mouse.
---
yeah ive felt that, i dont like using power armor, hate the display in first person and hate the weird legs in third person. i didnt even have lone wanderer perk till like lvl150 cuz im a moron. it can be a little frustrating getting wrecked pretty quick. but i find thats mostly my fault, i tend to run in like a jackass trying to berserk everything, where as when im a little more calculating and make them come to me its not such a problem... until they just say screw it and start shooting through walls. But as for damage output i cant speak to that. im a glass canon.
---
Important one from the other night for me: if you’re a group of freaking 180+ guys, please for the love of all that’s holy shoot the queen instead of standing around or looting guys when they die. Seriously. That was rage inducing.
---
As someone who sells mobile phones, I enjoyed that a lot
---
That's what he said.
---
Turn it on and see for yourself.
---
I'd be happy if chairs tables and refrigerators acted like brush and disappeared if you placed something over them.
---
I only want a battle royale if you have to GET TO THE CHOPPA!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Before you could just hit the air with a vampires melee weapon and you would regain health.
---
I'm still really low level but I'm thinking of setting up a newb help camp. Because the game had me over a barrel for a bit. I might set up on the creek at the North end of town. If you are on PS4 stop by sometime.
---
Well it's the only attempt I've seen to bring some real data into this thread, myself included
---
I wish you could ghoulify your character or hop in a vat and come out as a super mutant!
---
I feel that! I was strictly melee until recently, running bloodied nonsense. One-shotting max level super mutants feels great and all but having half my health devoted to radiation is rough. It is exactly the “best defense is a good offense” build because if you don’t kill everything nearby instantly, you’ll probably end up meat for a mole rat. If you’re looking for advice, the best I can give is to circle enemies when you fight them. Taking them head on just gets you hit, but if you’re constantly trying to flank, you can actually dodge quite a bit. Also blocking, if you can time it right. I don’t use power armor either and for a time ran a few perks that added DR, but found I performed all around better if I just used offensive/utility perks in their place.
---
Nice and cheap
---
 Thanks! It took me a few hours to get the basic structure up, but I try to work on it alittle every day. I left it up for about a month now.
---
It’s frustrating as hell too, because I went thru the whole stupid process twice thinking I was just doing it wrong, but there was no way to do it.
---
Manly Meat
---
This legendary is very low lvl and most players will not bother to find and equip low lvl weapon for that especially as this legendary is useless anyway only one star 3-5 scrip, if you want legendary items camp fire takes are not the place
---
I'll trade you for it( out of caps atm)
---
My friend rolled the exact 3\* combat shotgun I wanted. He's now expecting me to return the favour, but of course I can't roll anything worth a damn.
---
Being able to mail to yourself (to make use of alts without the risk)
---
A C.O.D. system to make trading easier and more efficient. 
---
They could even set up a series of quests for you to unlock the post office so you can gain access to the system so it's not straight off the bat. 
---
Have courier robots that you can ambush on the road and steal random packages to simulate things being mailed.
---
Just allow players to send gifts! Limit amount of gifts per day maybe 5-10?? Legendaries cost caps? 100 caps per star?
---
Only looking for caps, sorry
---
Must hurry, or you make Moo Moo jealous!
---
Stealth boys are your friend so they can’t VATS crit you.
---
I bought a few
---
im not really looking to farm legendaries i enjoy doing events and getting rewards and this event is one near my camp that i enjoy and i would like to get some kind of rewards other then random items and a small amount of caps
---
I just have to say that I absolutely love your GT! It just makes for a colorful mental picture!
---
Yes, great idea. Always see them never pick them up.
---
I was just thinking today how there's honestly such a market for pets in video games. Pokemon is quite frankly a simple low quality game but because there's well designed creatures that you can catch and train its one of if not the most well known game franchise. Seriously bethesda, make a good creature taming system and you'll do wonders for your game.
---
This event is for possum badges nothing else
---
I mean, we don't know how much content they plan to add in the end. They might need all that space and more.
---
Well... I shit on everyone.. haha
---
yeah the legendary dropped there is barely worth the scrip or time to scrip it. i would say campfire tales is more for badges than legendary items. unless the fire is gonna go out i dont even bother worrying about the legendary.
---
Why even have them in game when their functionally useless right? I'm looking at you syringer.
---
But thank you very much... I've had it since xbox live started.. still rocking it
---
I once tamed a cat and I was so excited when the option to send it to my camp came up! But when I fast traveled back, there was no sign of my new pet :(
---
If you're the first person eliminated your console will act as a beacon for an actual nuclear tipped ICBM, and you become ground zero
---
I remember that a legendary squatch once counted as a legendary for me as well. Will try it
---
Would lead you to totally skip my lvl 35  original, now vendor character with 40+ legendary weapons and 20+ legendary armor pieces.
---
Rhey have to walk all the way to your camp
---
Yeah they’re great. I use them all the time. Everyone always complains about people who use them, because it forces them to actually aim and shoot instead of relying on VATS for everything. Lol
---
It was like 10 ish mins after that, but the rest of the time while I played, I never saw my cat
---
same havent been to my camp in ages and its great when you cant find a specific workbench . Only thing I agree on is that they shouldnt be in the atom shop.
---
I sell for 5 caps each, had plenty of buyers. Could probably bump the price up a bit from that.
---
Class freak doesn't do anything to this mutation
---
Just to say.. cuz cant take a pic.. but I have 3 in my inventory right now
---
That's a very thorough and detailed set of ideas. Thanks for the input. 😄
---
It's really difficult not to one shot Nia since she's like level 20 or something
---
I want to see some pics!! This is good to know !
---
I try to use a 10mm as much as I can on this event. Yeah it’s probably less about the legendary but I want everyone to get the hit. It’s one of the most friendly events since fasnacht.
---
According to Sony, it shouldn’t cause problems in any game released after 2018. So Fallout 76 should work fine.
---
It would be a good to limit things at times but not all the way. Also when sending stuff out, it would cost caps.
---
Shit. I'm level 80. I'll stay in 99 until they fix it. Thanks.
---
When I'm dealing with a single target, it works just fine. I tested it. But heard it gets kinda weird when you are doing aoe damage and hitting multiple targets at the same time.
---
It was for your own good because you sound like an idiot.
---
There's quite a few fresh looking corpses.
---
have they always been here? this one is like flawless
---
Trapper. If I learned anything from dark souls it’s style over everything
---
2nd shot only gives a 25% damage bonus now.   I think the key item you're missing is an Instigating weapon.  100% bonus damage to undamaged enemies.   Combined with the 2.5x for sneak and whatever extra shooting the head does (or the reduced protection), just drops enemies.   1 Star Instigating weapons should be very cheap and easy to buy - or just grind something out with the legendary vendor (only need 1 or 2 star weapons FYI).
---
Btw, where is bleeding kate? Since I don’t play the english version it might have a complete different name for me
---
What happens when you get a dead zone. I've sat in a zone defending an animal and had maybe one or two enemies spawn the entire time. If it was purely damage based I'd get ruined for having been there doing the objective.
---
Dense, fireproof, speed deamon, marsupial, stealth boys, enforcer, shotgun/Tesla with limb damage or gamma gun with deep dish. Or pumpkin gernades to hide behind.
---
I like heavy weapons tho! Spamming tons of 5mm rounds into stuff is awsomed
---
Yeah i had one time where i said hey when the legendary spawns can you let the no-op punch it first and once it worked and they all just let us hit it before killing it   
---
maybe Low lvl legendaries should have a scaling resistance to dmg that scales to your lvl ?
---
Haha nice story!
---
The gauss rifle, radium rifle and plasma rifle are all energy weapons for the purpose of the Grounded mutation, but deal ballistic damage, which benefits from AA.
---
Haven’t found anything decent to buy from vendors either.  Or people want waaaaay too much.
---
Something similar happened to me too except it was a different weapon with the same legendary perks lol
---
And by 2nd shot I just meant ‘shooting again.  Not any specific thing.  I meant that I haven’t bothersd with weapon specific perks because the extra damage seems minimal.   Maybe I should check out bloody mess tho since it hits all of them?
---
All I know is they freeze when you crit so bloodied paired with vats refill is the go to. Really fun when people bring cryolators to the queen. You get that fire and ice feeling.
---
Oh trust me I like heavy weapons, just not Troubleshooters with added limb damage and +1 agility
---
Oh, Oof.
---
I'd like to know why none of them drop the melee weapons they're using. There's a suspicious amount of pitchforks that turn into rolling pins and lead pipes.
---
Ah - I thought you meant a two-shot weapon.   You may try going onto /r/fo76bazaar and advertising for an Instigating weapon.   People may just give you a 1 star for free.
---
This is the most popular spot. If you dont mind changing servers alot go for it.
---
Strange, because that matches one of my crashes, but I have zero mods.  What did the mod do that was causing the crash?
---
does*
---
 I’m not going to say I agree with every single position you’ve taken but there’s a general sentiment I can get behind for sure.
---
 My gametime is a pretty hard split between farming (to make ammo, explosives and aid) and what I would consider light PvP. A lot of this simply comes from conflicts over Workshops I want or am holding at a given time. I can definitely say my build isn’t optimized for PvP but i’ve Tuned it so that I can defend my workshops or take down someone on the leaderboard of Survival while still being effective in PvE.  
---
 But holy shit are some people in this game salty when they get killed and as you said it’s almost exclusively Power Armor users. I’ve had multiple players i’ve beaten (with no god roll gear just a mix of largely 1* gear especially my weapons ) message me telling me to kill myself or that I’m hacking. The common denominator has been that these players use full PA and seem completely oblivious to the fact that PA is terrible in PVP. 
---
   As you’ve said build and perks are the real equalizer in this game and if you have those set up properly you should be fine. If on top of that you make smart decision and think tactically you’re probably going to survive most of your PvP encounters. If you’re PvPing and complaining that you couldn’t Vats because I was crouched but come straight at me from the same angle repeatedly, or use explosive weapons when i’m running 3/3 dodgy and fireproof then yes you’re probably going to lose. 
---
      It really boggles my mind how some players will throw 500+ caps away running straight into oncoming Handmade fire in PA then turn around and complain that i’m Exploiting the game in some way when they just keep running right at you without changing tactics.
---
It’s the definition of insanity.
---
It probably gonna be closer to Team Deathmatch.
---
Yeah, I mostly would love the camp descriptions so I could advertise certain things.
---
Sounds cool and all. But how do you get more than 5 people without private servers? All the random worlds are full sometimes I can't even invite a single person without it being full.
---
Have a bunch of water purifiers?
---
For any of the weapon perks, using rank 1 of each (ie rifleman, expert rifleman, and master rifleman) for 30% (3 points) is better than using 9 points to max each for only 30% more damage, since each additional point only adds 5%.
---
the only game breaking issue is the server.
---
I want a ledger where we can have sales summary; as well as the total number of caps that our store has made.
---
Now? duped TSE's, Sentinels, Bloodied... When I close my eyes. I can still hear the TSE shotguns. (cries in PTSD)
---
What's the guild name?
---
The mod that was crashing was a text chat mod
---
TBC
---
Not sure about any scaling but I have done this event and the legendary has spawned and I didn’t even see it. My character is 195 and like I said I’ll try to tag things or punch stuff. I was mostly after recipes and it’s actually fun.
---
Yeah, nevermind then.
---
Might try that.  Seems ‘wrong’ thatvjust to do ‘decent’ one has to resort to that tho. ;)
---
But example.  I just fought some level 48 super mutant overlords.  My sniper took 5 hits each to kill them.
---
I like the idea of a logbook for keeping track of sales.
---
I’ve been wondering this as well. I’d love there ability to make certain lights flash repeatedly. Never could get it to work with the Power Counter or anything else like that.
---
You're easily triggered. Got it.
---
I always kill them, and repair whatever I can in the camp.
---
I fast traveled to someone's camp and noticed their turrets needed repair, fixed them right up and continued my shopping.
---
I'm getting everything setup before I add members.
---
Saw a fresh one the other day in the mire.
---
I don’t think you even can

---
I want to make RadDonalds and have a sign that says Over "_____" many served lol
---
So about disappearing things: this is probably not your problem, but I've dumped stuff I didn't intend to into my vending machine, because the cursor will stay active in the background while entering number/price for an item.  If you highlight a different item in the background, it will send that to the vendor at the chosen price, instead of the one you initially clicked.
---
"You have a foul, unhealty taste in your mouth, and you feel sick to your stomach. But hey, 5 chips is 5 chips!"
---
From my experience it's how servers are aging, older servers are dropping legendary everywhere. I'm not 100% sure if this is the case but couple times when i was able to find such server and farm it after a while maintenance countdown started.
---
Appalachia Express!
---
Daily misc quest to carry "stuff" from one camp to another!
---
One can make a courier character with max carry weight perks!
---
Not these ones I think. West Coast ones yeah.
---
I’m curious about this as well. I have a Furious Handmade I have in my stash. I want to use it, but I’m currently using my TSE and Instigating Lever Rifles.
---
I'm less desperate now.  I repeated my haul numbers last night, and turned it all to ammo without dying or crashing.  Miracle!
---
Probably because it’s cosmetic and not beneficial to the game as a whole.
---
Where did you get yours?
---
Messed up Bethesda started duping items I guess if you can't beat'em join them.
---
Maybe she was born with it. Maybe it's Maybelline.
---
Wouldn’t make sense though; the water will be irradiated.
---
I scrapped a nocturnal cryolator in to scrip and got back a nocturnal cryolator. Same level and everything
---
Shitty life pro tip
---
Thatd be better than nothing
---
Just wait until we get some Bennies in the servers. Boy are we going to have a wild ride on this one.
---
Someone was selling trash 3* weapons in their player vending machine. I bought 4 of them for 200 caps each. Not a bad way to get scrip
---
Same for me.  I ended up getting the Green Thumb and Good With Salt perks in early card packs, so my farm doesn’t take too much space or camp budget and I can stock up a bit more in advance. Herbivore is pretty convenient for cheap and easy basic food, especially if you’re running Speed Demon and burning through food faster. It’s nice to spend 5 minutes prep time, and not have to worry about food for a couple sessions.
---
I partially agree with you. You can’t expect to win a pvp encounter when you have a food build. However, legendary gear does influence how the pvp encounter will end. The majority of the times I’ve died in survival mode was to a person running with an automatic explosive weapon. I don’t have Sentinel or Cavalier gear, but I do have Assassin armour with the dense mod and the Fireproof 3 perk. Yet, I still get killed fairly easily. The truth of the matter is that if it wasn’t for duping, all these OP weapons and armour would rare amongst the player base. I’m not saying it’s impossible to beat someone with god-tier gear. But what I am saying is that it is more difficult to do so if you don’t have similar gear or the right build.
---
I remember it was by a lake west of site Alpha.
---
Scorch Beasts know better then to chase me, i Chase them
---
I lol'd outloud and had to explain to company
---
I had to look ULPT, description checks out haha
---
Thanks, Satan
---
I think I would play pvp with something like this.....rpg plus pvp. Built in teammates. Would want more folks on each server though.
---
I'm not really sure they were "Anon" masks; they were running around and jumping on all my stuff so fast, but that was my first impression of them. Maybe Fasnacht (sp?) masks? Also, when I first got to Flatwoods and was getting into the Overseers Cache, some other guy just stood there blasting away at me lol. I was only about lvl 3 so it didn't hurt me. But I was still like,"jeez...where are these good people everyone talks about?
---
Using the Atom Shop, yes ;)
---
I've been melee'd by a Scorched wielding a Minigun like a one-handed weapon. When I killed it, it dropped a machete.
---
Exactly, people have like no gun skills in this game. Everyone just VATs you. Then they get mad and call you a cheater when you use a stealth boy and force them to actually aim at you.
---
Yeah, even the highest damage variant, the radscorpion venom syringer, does peanuts for damage.
---
Not yet that I know of, I tried to do something similar with the arrow lights to no avail :/ 
---
F4's Robot expansion had all sorts of circuit camp goodies, who knows if we'll ever see those though
---
I agree, the voice acting on the holotapes are evocative and spot on.  I also think all the other sound effects are great too.....I've been playing since BETA and I STILL get goosebumps every time I hear the nuke launching warning siren and the "Attention Citizens".....so chillingly calm.....
---
It's just something people wanna complain about.
---
What area are you referring to? The level of the enemies somewhat depends on the players that are currently in that area.
---
There is very few survival servers and it will always try to place you on the server with best connection what quite often meant it's the one and the same server. Best way around it long friend list with active players and joining on them, downside is frequent frame drops caused by long friend list 🤗
---
Black water mine, and the quest where you have to get a historic sword. I’ve gone back to both these areas and the enemies are constantly spawning in at these levels
---
I've noticed this as well. It isn't out of the realm of possibility, but I'm so paranoid after reading all of the glitches that I am extremely slow when vending anything now.
---
I've tried to trade several times and never had anything happen. I just keep pushing "Y" until we both walk away in disappointment.
---
I’ve gotten jack shit, one of my boys got a TSE today
---
I like how you just assume I'm running a crappy excavator build. I'm running X-01 armor, bolstering armor plus, with some life saving armor amd +1 endurance pieces. Running FireProof x3, 5 endurance, serendipity x3, lone wanderer (as I go solo 90% of the time), etc. Etc. I don't have full capability to put Dense on all my armor as I am still grinding to learn mods and get the proper armor set I want. Its ignorant to assume what build I run and you're running with your assumption thinking I'm a 'noob' or some trash player running around in full wood armor and an excavator set at some lower level.
---
Explosive weapons with perk cards give an 80% damage to an already very high damage output with a blast radius for that damage. Unless every player is running a dense + fireproof build especially those who are starting out or are not fortunate enough to get the armor are SCREWED. 
---
Oh and get off your your broken two shot, explosive build and stop trying to make it sound like its someone else's fault for the insane damage it provides.
---
Taking in to consideration that there is 400k or less players active daily across all platforms and most people doesn't play on survival plus no one is playing 24h per day, then there will be around 10-20 survival servers per platform and that's really low.
---
I had this happen last night.
---
...only it was an all-eyebot club so they were all lv1-15 items
---
Honestly don't even bother, I'll just concede it must be a thing. But I server hopped for six hours looking for anything in the spots recommended and turned up two level 14 snallygasters and a level 4 doe. If this exists I think it's a bug and the legendary effect is purely cosmetic since pets don't drop loot on death. I would say I'm disappointed but I'm mostly just burned out on the game from doing that.
---
Man I've been trying to tame something decent forever, I'm having enough ttrouble just trying to find something tamable.
---
Most of the time I leave a door open for bench access, but sometimes I don't. I sometimes have to drop things that I don't want auto scrapped and I'm worried that someone will come upstairs and help themselves to it while my back is turned. And sometimes people come and look at the store but don't buy anything and then proceed to use my benches for a half hour. A lot of times it's right when I'm about to log off or server hop and I don't want to be rude and drop them in the water, so I end up waiting until they leave. So if I'm getting close to logging out or I'm only in that server shortly before hopping to another, I'll shut the door so no one can go up there.
---
Couldn't tell you. Maybe they aren't aware? I didn't know until I looked it up today researching a trade.
---
The quest where you get the sword is where extremely high level players hang out since it gets nuked often. I know what you’re experiencing. I’m level 108, but have an alt in the mid 20’s that I play with my friend on. 
---
We did that quest and kept dying trying to get the sword. Eventually we got it, but I’d recommend skipping that quest until you are level 45+. For Blackwater mine, that’s also very close to the sword quest area. Can you just do the main story quests for now?
---
I have a TSE and AAE with amor penetration mods and tank killer. And the AAE out performs the TSE easily, better accuracy and more damage against most thing except ghouls/scorched/beasts then the TSE is slightly better and only at closer range
---
😂
---
Been there, your best bet is just get fast at scrapping them. Don't forget to ditch the mass amounts of fertilizer and itemized crops that'll end up in your stash.
---
The blackwater quest is apart of the story quest, unless I’m missing something. But it’s the quest where I need to get key fragments for rose
---
Bomber jacket?
---
I remember reading that early on that the Furious effect didn't work properly on the Mr. Buzz blad. It seems like it was patched, whuch is a good thing. Now I regret getting rid of mine :-/
---
Nope. I was hoping to use the candy cane paint and give out candy canes to new players at Christmas and learned the hard way.
---
I led a SB a base once.  Felt bad about it, but o weighted 750 pounds and was out of ammo so....  I bought some stuff while it ravaged the base.  Hope that eases the sting.   
---
Guy did show up and immediately left the server. Lol. I was hiding in a bathroom and whoosh, bathroom disappeared and I was toast!
---
Are you talking about ranged, melee, or both? And was this your testing or some other source?
---
Where you on my server?
---
Same happened with us and we killed the SQ w/ 20 seconds to spare!
---
Ahh! The best time I’ve ever had on FO76.
---
Then we all went and took on the SheepSquatch.
---
Ah, I forgot that Rose sends you there, it’s been awhile since I did those quests. Are you on PS4? I can help you go through that area. If there aren’t any high level players next to that area it should only spawn them in the mid 20s, but with higher level players around, the molemen can be in the 40s.
---
You can get it from the breach and clear event
---
I'm level 72 and will probably go for my first launch later this week. Is it possible to solo it?
---
Yeah I’m on ps4 my Id is atlantisbnd2012 I tried running pass them all, but the item I need is on a level 68 ghoul.
---
Nope not that one.
---
Myself and 2 friends did this event last night.  Only 1 friendly animal survived (the ghoul) in biome B because the three of us took turns defending it while the others ran into the other biome where the alpha was to tag it, then ran back to defend the friendly.  Other players who showed up kept emoting us to come into the other biome to shoot the alpha, which was nice, but that would've left no one defending the friendly, and the event would've failed.  The funny thing was, no enemies came into biome B to attack the friendly while everyone else was in the other biome tagging the alpha....
---
Prime and ultracite plans are dropping for whatever you don't have.
---
I think my main don't get any anymore. Did somewhat resently got still one or two primes.
---
On my melee I've not taken the decon arc and am getting it over and over.
---
I'm selling for 2 caps but I'm usually selling my junk just to get stash space not for profit, same with ammo regular ones 1cap rare like grenades 2caps
---
I wonder, and hope, if they will keep updating the game for years to come, as they had indicated.
---
I have a simple furious lv 45 handmade and that baby was putting down sheepsquatch and lvl 80 scortchbeast solo before I was level 70. The furious effect comes up to speed quickly with the rapid rate of fire. My advice would be to try and get a drum clip, not an Armor piercing one, as you want the rate of fire to be high and keep going with the furious effect.
---
"A soul for a soul"
---
That's at least yields a heariter chuckle than any of the jokes in the perk packs
---
Yeah. It’s basically just Rock Paper Scissors because of the legendary effects for armor/weapons, not to mention perk card loadouts, etc. Aiming is secondary
---
I like it. But they will be no match for my 5 pieces of  Zealot's armor.
---
wow i charge 2 - 4 caps max for screws
---
Ya I'm not sure what all the rage over bloody builds is. I'm primarily heavy gunner build, but also use melee. And once I get a few kills with lvl 1 adrenaline and start doing the extra dmg, my Instigating cultists blade wrecks muties in one, maybe 2 hits. But I also have full health and am wearing combo T-51 and X-01 power armor, so can take a hell of a beating. Just seems like a better aproach than the glass cannon thing.
---
If you have enough plastic and raw fertilizer, you can bulk it 20 times and then scrap the bulk, that will count.
---
Okay I can help in 45 minutes if you’re available then. I’ll add you when I get home.
---
Mitten?
---
Yes I will be. Thank you lol
---
Now that's interesting. Thanks for this.
---
It's not like special itself is capped but sell in prices are capped at 25% of item value and buying prices capped at 175% (or close to that I'm not 100% sure if i remember this one).
---
Could be reflexive behavior that hasn’t changed with the updates yet. Until pretty recently a single stray shot would get you a wanted marker and a turret target painted on your back.
---
I could definitely see some guy who played the shit out of the game and walked away only to come back for Wild Appalachia still thinking that was the case.
---
Of course it’s more likely he’s just an asshole, but you never know
---
You can waddle over to a shop and sell em for 1 cap each. It's a pretty good gig lol
---
I think it’s the rads
---
There's also a bug that stops you from being respawned anywhere. When you die, it gives you an option to respawn by pressing 'a'. Unfortunately pressing 'a' does nothing, the game becomes unresponsive and the only way to to quit the game is to Alt-F4.
---
Both these bugs have been seen many times before, but never get fixed and remain fixed!!!
---
God knows what Bethesda do for version control or testing their software.
---
Maybe a dumb question but,how do u know when she or anything is crippled??
---
BE Handmade, FE 10mm, TSE Shotty handmade and lever action.
---
Tesla Rifle for mobs, a instigating buzz blade works wonders b4 last patch.
---
Also have a TSE minigun i use a bit on the queen. alot more but wont spoil it for everyone :).
---
I managed to build one yesterday after like two months.  (i don't get on very often)  But i need to make one for my brother.  He can probably give you the caps to build on at his camp.  I'll be on around 2am (i work late).  Either that or I'm off on the weekends. Any help would be appreciated!!
---
Love it .... more ways the better .... the badges are a beast to earn.  And that's just the ones that work.
---
Royale* FYI
---
Make sure you keep a couple turrets repaired. I went to one the other day and didn't notice a mole rat on the other side of the base eating a wall until I was leaving. Even though the ballistic turrets don't do a whole lot of damage, it's a nice audio warning that things are around.
---
you misspelled mutations
---
knowing how they would make us have each piece in our stash box in order to display, id rather have a power armor parking space, place a chassis down and activate. it will lock your power armor in place (unless you remove it from the stand/your stash box. ) 
---
id also like it if we could choose between the photo mode poses for our displayed power armor
---
Buy a lotto ticket
---
the problem is that sometimes you are at your scrip limit, and then you get back to back wood pieces. and cant scrip them out. why impose a scrip limit and allow items to degrade. simply saying scrip it out right away is not a solution.  and if they cant fix it they should remove the daily scrip limit.
---
if you have the concentrated fire perk, you can see limb health and target the limbs directly, otherwise it's just point and shoot at the spot limb you want crippled i.e. wing, leg, etc. Fully crippled it cannot move -- Note on SBQ, Sheepsquatch, etc. this doesn't last forever. She will still do her take off/fly phases eventually if given enough time
---
Xi Equinohx iX add me and message me
---
Are you on xbox? That might have been me. If not, I'm glad someone hooked you up.
---
yeah that's a common wall. here is how I break it without help from high levels. 
---
go to vault 76 - get every peice of wood and pick every blue flower you can find - green thumb is twice as helpful if you have it. - pick blue flowers soot flower. all around and to the moonshiners shack then all around and to the lumber mill then all around and to the abandoned shack then all around and to the the overseers camp. once at the  camp go to the river and pick every red flower in the creek . bloodleaf. follow the creek all the way past the agr center down to the east coast . theres a place call hillfok hotdogs with a stove boil 100 or so water and make 50 to 150 healing salve depending on wether or not you have green thumb and also a perk called chemist is usefull but you may not have it yet. anyway then you heal tank your way through the high level mobs with the healing salve. I was able to kill a level 50 scorchbeast with this method at level 15. you can heal tank your way through the story line this way. try it. when you run out of heal salve wait for the plants to reset then try again. while waiting for plants to reset you can work on your base - take the local workshops and just chill for a day. get a full batch of healing salve and make another push. with the healing salve you can push through any of the mobs at any level pretty much.
---
I can switch characters without any issue (PC)
---
its good they arent so common becuase they are the WORST gun in the game absolute trash :).
---
Cool I will before I head to bed !
---
I use my quad Tesla and bloodied goraks Imost community events. The Tesla to tag everything and kill flying insects and the gorak only if I'm in real sh1t and don't want people touching my junk
---
You can find stingwings at bleeding kate and lure them a bit into the ash heap.
---
Yeah :) can’t change the topic tho 😅
---
Hey, yeah I’d be down to play whenever I’m on, GT: Mark Ruffallo
---
I miss the ones who’d swing around miniguns like they were clubs. Yeah it was because of a now patched glitch but dammit they were funny!
---
Ya not mine I'm South
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/lIXx63p
---
Though partially the programming. I'de say the easy answer is to switch tactic while trying to do silo, atleast in mean time. Just shuffle some perks, even with my build it helps to have a silo specific layout.
---
Yeah. I got speed demon a bit earlier than planned on a new build and pretty much used these as my lifeline when i got too many rads. Buy these bad bois up to hold you over until starched genes.
---
It usually take 2 weeks for important fix, if they don't see it as important then it will be one month.
---
Cool I’ll add you now also !
---
Same platform. Has happened to me but intermittently and inconsistently
---
maybe on the edge of a fireplace . you can plant corn on fireplaces. other than that i got nothing.
---
I don't even bother with the purveyor. Id rather toss my 1* crap legendaries into a vending machine for 400 caps.. Someone always buys
---
Ah is that the atom shop one only? I could give it a shot
---
Spoiler-tagged because it's information about datamined Atomic Shop items:
---
&gt;!The patch that added the vending machine skins to the Atomic Shop also added mailboxes to the game files. Specifically, mailbox skins that would become available in the Atomic Shop at a later date, so we don't have any data on the object's functionality, just images—and please note that I am specifying SKINS available in the Atomic Shop, not the actual functional mailbox itself. Those will be a free addition, just like the vending machines. !&lt;
---
&gt;!The interesting thing to note about these mailbox skins is that, in the game files, they weren't listed as belonging to the "CAMP" section of the Atomic Shop (which would indicate that they're non-functional furniture), but instead they were listed under "Utility," which is where the vending machine skins are also found. This suggests that usable mailboxes are coming to the game in the near future, in some form or other. So, make of that what you will.!&lt;
---
Lol you're good man, I totally understand and agrees with that. Right now I dont have thi vs like white knight or some other non-pa perks. Thought about picking up more tiers of tenderizer too
---
Damn. I’m sorry. People mean well, but we’re generally ignorant.
---
it mostly depends, nothing is ever guaranteed to sell unless you price it super cheap. go around to other camps and compare prices, and then list your items for a fair amount, too much and nothing will sell.. too little and you will struggle to keep up with demand
---
No worries, though not too sure. Haven’t had as much game time this week so my sessions have been shorter than usual.
---
no i think its just a plan you get from taking workshops. couldnt tell you where i got mine. its just a basic campfire not fireplace I misspoke. it should be under the lights section. you probably already have it it is very common.
---
She's not dead. If she was, the "follow her trail" mission would have ended after finding the last tape. She leaves tapes at each silo you nuke from, implying she survived her encounter with the mole miners.
---
Ah yeah i think thats already fixed
---
I got a executioners rolling pin with 40% faster swing speed which is a sweet combo for anything that’s not a rolling pin
---
Green Thumb
---
Thank you I appreciate it!
---
(I hope nobody has said this) they could make it so that a brotherhood members armor broke and the plague came in through there and it would also be it's Achilles heel
---
Little green ghouls!!
---
For Xbox users my ammo is also free gt ChurchOfAbaddon
---
Thanks for the tips.
---
Sold 17k caps of stuff last night while in the toilet and had to try and figure what sold.
---
You'll find a few like that as random event spawns. I see the most along random spawns along the edges of the map, but that could just be rng.
---
As well every energy weapon with explosive bullets do ballistic dmg and benefits from anti armour (it's one of the reasons why plasma Gatling with explosive is so broken in pvp).
---
I used to own a deathclaw until it just vanished. Maybe it died, its possible but I figured it would respawn. After about 3 days I decided it was probably gone for good so I tamed a wolf. I noticed the name never changed colors and stayed red which seems to be a recent development, since my deathclaw didnt appear red after I tamed it. 
---
Anyhow, that wolf spawned in dead earlier today and probably wont be coming back. The taming system has the groundwork in place but Bethesda hasn't exactly touched too much on it since launch, and I wish they would too, its a cool concept.
---
This is the first I heard of it. Thanks for letting me know about it.
---
But the player that traps you will also get trapped by themselves if they fast travel
---
D'oh!
---
I remember waiting forever for a pet. Leaving the CAMP budget available. Then by fluke, some super muties start a fight with a mega sloth that I was able to save and tame. Fast travel back, wait a bit, my buddy shows up, we take some pics and I log off for the night.
---
Next day I log in to find him spawn in dead, and never respawned. 
---
I haven’t bothered to since.
---
Is it just me or does pretty much every 3-star have either a +1 stat or a vats bonus? Not worth it for me, especially since stat bonuses are useless for slotting perk cards
---
In addition to what's already been said, it's very hard for plosionheads to nab you if you have the higher ground.
---
I generally do my best to avoid having my back to any wall, obstacle of any sort, and use elevation to thwart the majority of explosive damage after any potential stagger,  forcing them to actually try and hit me to do anything significant when their ap drains out.
---
OH!  Even better,  if you're in power armor,  and only if your'e in power armor,  you hear (Over the comms in the helmet) the scorched voices,  "Not....Us."   "Seek!  KILL!"
---
No one else hears it and if no one is in power armor then no one hears it.
---
I’m on PS4. I can help you add a suppressor to your handmade if you’d like?
---
Salty meat
---
To show you the power of Flex Seal, I sawed this canoe in half!
---
That's random encounter location. I found mr. squeeze there selling lemonade :P
---
if youre on ps4 ill gladly take it off your hand for some caps. or another 3 star rolling pin you can turn into scrip.
---
the solution is to get rid of the stupid player vending machines and make a game wide auction house for each of the platforms this game is on.    Give us so much space on the auction and when we put stuff to sell it, it takes it from our stash and puts it onto the auction server.    
---
This solves so many different problems I'm shocked that people who are paid to make this game didn't even put it in.
---
Yes i did a solo silo run,was a bit lost now and then.but think its much easyer with friend tho.
---
With right price you can sell anything. Recipes for 5, camp plans for 30 and armor/weapon plans for 20 sell like fresh lemonade on hot aummer day.
---
Melee should follow the same rules. This is mostly from data-mining but this guy confirmed most of it so far:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bt9phg/mechanics\_test\_furious\_weapon\_affix/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bt9phg/mechanics_test_furious_weapon_affix/)
---
I have one of those with the drum clip. It'll take out a Scorchbeast without having to reload.
---
Um.. Ok im in!
---
One of the cool things healing salve has over stimpacks is the salve doesn't make you thirsty like a stim does, when you use it.
---
I remember in the reveal they talked about taking over towns and using them as camps.
---
I guess that got dialed down to the workshop system.
---
I regularly get bloatflies at Aaronholdt homestead farm in the north of the Forrest region.
---
There are actually quite a few around Appalachia.  Been there since day one if I remember so no real significance other than some people got out of the other vaults.
---
Taxes
---
I bet it's adorable.
---
I don't understand how people can't just be okay with restarting from scratch. If that's what you want to do I get it, but that isn't what I want. I want all of my things back. I never exploited in the game sadly to say, and I don't care if you think I'm guilty. Fact of the matter is I got suspended from the Nuka Cola I picked up. I have the e-mail from back in January where they told me this.
---
I think most the corpse you find are from vault 94, I was able to find some and see the numbers on their back. I think from what I remember, the vault was full of pacifist and opened up like a year after the bomb dropped and was trying to send themselves out to help anyone in need or something. Usually you find their corpse at raider's camps, i find em in raider cages and inside a port a John before too
---
A lot of people were suspended. Back in the beginning of the year this sub was blowing up with the amount of people who were talking about it. The guy who got suspended who had over 700 was a post I'm sure most remembered. Would you like a screenshot of the message I got from Bethesda about the Nuka Cola?
---
Side note. Why is "200 Levels" in quotes. lol Do I need to prove that also?
---
Why can't they just label the mods with the "limb" or "torso" like EVERYTHING else ..... oh wait .... for mods of Marine armour they don't label them either.
---
Bethesda.
---
I keep getting VATS medic + VATS everything machine guns for my lone wandere build that doesn't use VATS or big guns
---
Just a thing, did that a few times in the begining and have to wait to level before I can use
---
Jokes on you Grams a female that’s it girl meat..
---
In my early days of playing I tried to help someone’s camp that was being attacked by ferals. I missed a few too many shots, hit some walls and became wanted. The panic that someone was stalking me behind every tree has kept me from ever helping someone else’s camp again.
---
He’s gotten lucky as well anyways, since the only other legendary he ever got was a 1-star.
---
He has also basically completely finished the game and some of the tedious challenge things, so he only comes online to role-play and all that stuff.
---
Was actually planning on streaming it instead if he was online so there would be no way for me to edit anything, but if you’re sure then I’ll leave it here.
---
Serums sell pretty easily at 300 caps. Any limited-availability plan seems to go eventually, even the ultracite armor mod plans and booze plans that no-one really wants. Scrap is hit-and-miss but seems to go eventually at 2x vendor sale price.
---
I cannot sell fusion cores even at 30 caps each but apparently some people do buy them.
---
I don't know whether it is new, but I was at Morgantown Airport yesterday and saw some scorched with blue-ish vault tech clothing. Nice touch by the dev.
---
So you don't play fallout, you're just shitposting.
---
Minecraft has a massive audience because it's an open world creative sculpting studio. It's great, for people who enjoy that sort of thing, but it has jack _shit_ when it comes to _actual gameplay_.  It has even less plot than this game, for fucks sake. 
---
As for "came to be a dickhead". I said you wanted a different game. You came at _the entire fucking player base of the game_ with baseless insults. 
---
What the fuck is broken in your head, kid?
---
Umm, How much would I owe you?
---
I suggest do the quest and events on the Forest, Toxic Valley and Ash Heap before continue your quest. When you get to level 35 then you will be ready.
---
Also, the workshops in those areas are easy to keep in order to do the "Defend..." events. Use the Well Rested bonus, take 6 workshops and you have events to all the session. Don't abuse using torrets, kill molerats eventually will give you a level up.
---
You can level up easily on survival but you could die a lot and lose caps.
---
That seems like a messed up system.
---
Would throw off your numbers for super duper
---
How do you message them???
---
Fuuuuuuck lol
---
What platform?
---
Yeah true 
---
Scouts??
---
MEATY MEAT!!!
---
Clyde.
---
Ah forgot to say, pc
---
Are you over level 50?
---
No I’m like level 24, I find it’s long to level up in this game
---
Could be worse,  I'm sitting in a silos without the launch code lol
---
Touché. Maybe we’d still get a bonus for that somehow? Like a lump sum rather than it having to proc multiple times.
---
I launched my first one today too. All by myself. Then I saw the levels of everyone gathering and figured we were definitely not killing that queen. But we did! It was a very satisfying first nuke launch.
---
Below level 50 you select one perk to level up, and then can pick a card to increase, typically of the same perk so you have room for it.
---
Yea kind of d bag behavior but some people just don't care about other players.
---
You did ok. That's actually a pro strat. Nuke prime off center so that you can fight the queen outside the nuke zone
---
For me range weapon I roll for 2 star since the third star is usually a attribute. malee and armor 3 star, because malee you shooting for the strength, and armor for the sentinal
---
That's why I'm hoping the fridge mod for the backpack works well.
---
I can do it for free. What’s your PSN?
---
I'm starting to only do 2 star. The odds of getting something godlike is far better I feel. Spending 50 for a chance to get something TSE or bloodied is better. You get double the chance to recieve something of that nature. Plus for the extra 50 the 3rd weapon bonus is usually not worth the extra 50.
---
Happened to me earlier lol. Codes reset as I was clearing the silo. Didn't notice until after i used my nuke card. Got the code wrong.
---
I don't get it.  It's the least efficient way to share battery power.  I'll tell you to go find an outlet if you hit me up for juice.
---
Also most my levels were made by nuking Whitesprings and farming that. Which was nerfed if I recall. Call me an exploiter or whatever dude. I know I got suspended for bigging up a bag of nuka cola outside whitesprings. I know I'm innocent. Everyone is so cynical though.
---
I mostly avoid getting hit, but with an unarmed melee build you really need as much damage reduction as possible. Blocker should be an automatic choice. Lone Wanderer and Dodgy are good if you're solo and light on VATS respectively. Serendipity is fantastic for bloodied builds.
---
Full set of BOS Vanguard 👌
---
that does look freeesh. mmmm.
---
if its on a foundation remove or store the foundation. if its on the ground you are SOL.
---
On Xbox and immediately scrapped it lol
---
I was at your camp yesterday! Went up stairs and just had a wtf moment then i ran away..
---
Hahaha!
---
^
---
Aw man do blueprints not work? Im trying to get a purifier in my camp ontop of a pylon but since theres no dirt here i cant place it anywhere :(
---
Free caps
---
You have to raise your luck to use a 2pt perk card if you have 1 luck.
---
Choosing a perk card doesn't put a point into that special. 
---
You can't view cards without picking a special first, that's where the point goes
---
My friend just keeps getting the stuff I want (like the stuff I’m looking for that he may not care as much about).
---
Wasn't that bug fixed ages ago?
---
You could do it how ever you would burn though a lot of supplies quickly.
---
r/mildlyinteresting
---
Wait so you can increase a special and rank up a card in one go? So I’m doing something wrong?
---
Ah ok, dang.
---
I am slightly confused by the system but I’m getting used to it now.
---
I have an easier solution. Make outfit counterparts for every underarmor. It's not like it would take any real effort. Pretty sure outfit is just a tag.
---
Information on the Furious effect was just posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bt9phg/mechanics_test_furious_weapon_affix/) earlier today.
---
You can probably get away with it till lvl 50. Legendaries will be a bitch to fight. You will be doing base damage, which is pretty bad. Maybe using a bloodied build.
---
I've been buying a lot of people's trash 3* weapons when they sell them cheap, saves me from grinding as much, and my vending is covering the costs easily.
---
Nice!!
---
me too. I love the mire ambient sounds so much,it's definitely home.
---
Bought like 5 of them for 100 caps a piece from a player vending machine....
---
My exact methods.
---
this is bethesda. bugs are like legacy items. they can always be brought back for future events.
---
Yes!! Make them horrible.
---
bah, that sucks, but I wish messaging was standard for reasons like this. I had a squatch that would spawn outside one of my camps. it was a nice surprise to find in the middle of building or coming back home after being out and about.
---
No sweat! Cheers
---
Always nice to stumbble up on them
---
The solution, given in the comments, was to fast travel to a location NEAR to the silo, but NOT fast travel to the silo itself. Then walk to the silo from there. That worked out perfect and let us go down in all three silos when we did that.
---
Seen it punk a scorchbeast.
---
I can't even launch a nuke at level 90 with decent gear then there's this guy
---
&gt;Is it just me or does pretty much every 3-star have either a +1 stat or a vats bonus?
---
Or bonus bashing damage, because everyone loves pistol whipping 
---
their enemies instead of shooting them... 🙄
---
Honestly, there are a couple things like 90% reduced weight that are fucking awesome 3rd stars, but your odds of getting that perfect combination are almost as bad as winning the actual lottery. 
---
Like I said, you're much better off rolling 2 stars until you get the "almost perfect" weapon for your build, and then roll or trade for something that has that elusive complementary 3rd star.
---
Dayz broke me of this habbit as you just change mags. Eventually you will have 3 mags with 2 or 3 bullets in them and your screwed when someone shows up😥. Now i have to remind myself thats its om to constant reload haha
---
&gt;I'm running X-01, bolstering armor with some life saving armor and +1 end
---
T51b is better for pvp. bolstering is completely useless because DR by itself means nothing. same with +end. life saving is kinda useful, I guess?
---
&gt;you're running with your assumption thinking I'm a 'noob' or some trash player
---
you just proved I'm right, though...
---
&gt;Explosive weapons with perk cards give an 80% damage
---
...and keep on doing so. it's not 80% because the bonus from demo expert is multiplicative. say your weapon is dealing 100 damage, the explosive version of it would deal 120. plus demo expert, 132. that's because 20% of 100 is 20 and 60% of 20 is 12. for a 5 points perk investment. for comparison, rank 2 of the appropriate perk (or 2 rank 1s of course) would add more damage.
---
&gt;Unless every player is running a dense + fireproof build
---
it's not a build, it's a 3 point investment for a perk unlocked early on. and you can buy dense mods, if memory serves the marine one is like 500 caps. it's cheap regardless. literally everyone has access to and should be running it, even in pve, since it negates essentially all explosive damage.
---
&gt;Oh and get off your your broken two shot, explosive build and stop trying to make it sound like its someone else's fault for the insane damage it provides.
---
see what I'm talking about? two-shot is trash. you're a few months late, it's like you're playing an older build of the game. currently the only way to get "insane" damage is through bloodied and sneak mechanics. I'd hardly call a 32% bonus insane, especially because you can be successful in pvp with a regular handmade and personally I don't even max my damage output because of how survival works. it's a waste. yet I'm successful.
---
Yup a mod
---
This happens at random spawn locations and has the whole time.
---
Is there a chance these are still for sale?
---
me too!!! I'm not on mic and I don't need a conversatiom but it's cool to have real people stop in. mostly they don't :( it's lonely in my swamp sometimes. but I do have a pet snallygaster that has stayed alive so far...
---
Might be an interesting YouTube series
---
yeah it’s nuts, definitely my first encounter or even having been aware of it.
---
I am guessing this is referring to all those requests for the legendary that drops from the "boss" to be given to everyone since the actual event loot already does this exact thing.  If so, then you seem to be missing the entire point of many of those requests.  Currently, instead of everyone protecting things like the brahmin in Free Range, gathering kindling in the campfire event, etc everyone is too busy trying to get a tag on the boss to make sure they get their legendary.  Since it makes no sense to assume that the number of leechers would increase (as they already do show up for the event loot itself anyway), this only frees up the focus of the people who are actually participating from needing to run over and get a shot on a boss instead of focusing on the things needed to finish the event (like protecting the brahmin from swarms of insects, keeping the fire going, killing the hordes of bots, etc).  Making it seem like its the leechers who do nothing already that want this instead of those hard workers who may have to forsake getting a legendary in order to have the event succeed isn't really a fair representation.  Personally, I'm equally happy with either giving the loot from the boss to everyone in the event or simply not having the boss drop any loot at all (and any boss specific drops instead be given through additions to the event loot table instead).  Either way won't impact the leechers, but it will change the concerns of those that actually are doing the work.
---
Agreed
---
a lot of people will not buy fusion cores unless they are at 100% charge. i saw someone try to sell a 2% one for 200 caps. i almost regretted killing the gulper attacking their camp when i spawned in
---
There are no unwounded soldiers in war.....
---
Yea, if you’re just getting initial good armor and weapons shoot for 2 star. Once you’re comfortable and you want to find the perfect items, go for 3.
---
I tamed a MegaSloth and he never even made it to my camp like a football field away.
---
Doubtful it's a reference to Avatar and more that meteoric iron is a trope.
---
https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThunderboltIron
---
Both of you leave to main menu. Join a team at menu then join the world together.
---
this needs to happen, along with what u/Yzalrik said.
---
You get the Bear Arm plan from Project Paradise event, not the Sheepsquatch Imposter
---
Yeah, don't worry about it. Sorry I doubted you so much, I honestly thought it had to be fake but... I've literally only seen one other person with a pet in game, so I shouldn't be so sceptical.
---
I'm not on right now so I don't know the actual item names, but there are a couple of switches in the power connector category that pulse power off and on. At least one of them can be hooked up to a terminal so you can control the speed of the pulse. With the right combination of light boxes, switches, and terminals you can make a multicolor flashing disco wall.
---
Bulk of resources like plastic, screws. Sell it for 1 cap. Fusion cores too. I sell them for like 30-40 caps ( depends on how much juice they got). Some 2-3 star weapons. I usually set the price for 2-3 star ranges weapons for 125-165. Melee goes for 75-100.  Same thing with some kind of 2-3 star armor too. Armor harder to sell just depends on the type like vanguard or exterminator.
---
Every level you can choose a special point, and a perk card related to it. Every 5 levels you get a bonus perk card pack which can give random cards. Those bonus cards dont increase your special. So what I'm guessing happened is you got another scrounger card from the pack, which then let you rank up the one you had.
---
I’ve got weapons I’m really happy with (an instigating hunting rifle and a furious handmade) so I’m working on my armor. Given that it’s cheaper and the third attribute an often be excellent (lower weight) I’ve been going for three stars. I’ve done okay, I seem to get getting a lot of three star scout armor! A few weeks and I should be fully kitted out and can try for two or three star guns.
---
I like it Clyde sounds like it would be a sort of slightly dangerous cranky person.
---
Bit of an old post but are you sure? Been trying for the last 20 mins or so and i cant get it
---
That's why I rarely ever do them anymore. Always pickin up garbage. Not worth the supplies used in my opinion. It's also still very unstable. last 2x I did one the game froze with less than 20% power left on the queen. It used to be alot of fun. Now it's just a waste of resources.
---
No what do you do?
---
I’ve gotten broadsiders more than everything else combined. Does anyone even use those?
---
You are correct. Some effects can only be found on 3*
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects
---
My cousin spawned into a camp and fell through the world was in a bleed-out state in a locked room when he popped back up. He had a good bit of junk on him since we were heading to a vendorbot before our stop. So I broke in and he got his stuff back. I'll go wanted for a good cause.
---
I've had to redesign and move my camp a few times to make sure it was friendly to players that spawn in. Hopefully we do get a solution soon.
---
Broadsiders are the "Well, if all my other weapons are broken..." gun. But with end gamers able to stockpile repair kits you'll never need to use one.
---
Before the possum quests were added trick or treat was spawning once a day for me at least. Since needing to make pumpkin grenades it will not spawn for me either.
---
1. You no longer get a bounty for a bullet grazing a potted plant or something, camps are immune to player damage unless there are certain conditions
---
2. Materials are infinitely available yes, but sometimes you might not have even the slightest material to repair all and have to scrounge
---
Kind of why I run a Beserker in Survival 😆.  If the PvP dynamics are too broken to take seriously, I'll take my licks in my underwear.  Nothing quite like sprinting through a kill-zone full of nigh-invincible git-gudders in tighty-whities!  Makes the times I get a kill even more rewarding, too 😂.
---
I usually kill them, and also repair turrets as well.
---
Question 🙋‍♂️ Is the pink bear a nurse, or is the panda bear a masochist? I need backstory here.
---
Bummer, i was hoping someone bought my CHOO CHOO MOTHERFUCKER for its creative name.
---
Plenty do it intentionally. I di it fir fun. Some do it if they don't like your prices
---
Yup. There’s 3 categories; primary, secondary, and tertiary. Good news for you is bloodied is primary, 25% is secondary, so you can get a B25 on a 2star weapon.
---
Or are deaf/mute..
---
You must have shot them. Even if they turned and shot the damage wouldn't do anything to you until you retaliated.
---
Without doing a bloodied build with a bloody weapon and adrenal reaction mutation, you would have serious issues with damage output. But neither of those require perks, so yeah, technically you could.
---
So if you pick luck then pick a card from luck you would be ok.
---
But you can also pick agility then switch to a luck card. (The idea is the perk packs give you few free cards so you may want the extra point to equip run and gun you got for free in a pack.. Then choose a diffrent luck card to swap out.) 
---
It kinda strange but im 90% certain it works this way so you can take full advantage of free cards you get.
---
Does the luck Stat actually work like this in game?
---
I know it was a figure of speech but I'm curious
---
Reminded me of a kitten with a hangover. Nothing my laser pointer to the face couldn't handle.
---
F076 viagra substitute, "dont have enough wood? Here you go!"
---
When you level up, your first choice is the special point to level up. Your next choice is the perk card to get. You can level up STR but pick a luck card. I’m guessing that’s what you’ve been unknowingly doing
---
Did you hold Y? Hold it down till a circle completion bar finishes.
---
Yeah don't be like the level 90 guy who attracted two scorchbeasts to my camp and then stood there like a tool while I killed them for him. Dude, really?
---
Yes, because there's a single game company who have developed an open world game with entirely unique assets and no reuses, making the file size too massive to effectively download and making every video card that saw it fry. Shame about whatever happened to that company.
---
at my shop for 5 c per ;P

Don't leave me hanging like this

They are so heavy and so is their ammo. I can’t imagine saving that for backup!
---
i dont farm them they just accumulate from my normal play and i sell them since i never use them. my ign is garlandtd
---
I've got a blackberry on a campfire, but not a water purifier on a mat. It's not much lol but if you want it you can have it. ign Sertith
---
I would love this the other way too! I got my tatterd rags? Anyway would be cool to see the random assortment of junk i have strapped on my body to keep me safe.
---
Also my guy resembles no bark from nv.
---
Might as well see if it works i guess, ill add u, ign ulfyn
---
You also were not the only vault dweller released from the vault, so other than the player characters other inhabitants were out and about, so it could’ve been some of those dwellers too.
---
I gots ta know!
---
I'm stuck with two of them at the moment because of the damn Purveryor. I keep getting them, so I have them in my inventory. Each day I log in and purge the heaviest guns I get for scrips.
---
I still haven't gotten to exchange the broadsiders if that tells you anything.
---
I hop a lot of random spawn locations looking for tame-able animals, so I've probably just seen a lot more than someone that hasn't hopped soooo maaannnnyyy tiiiimeeeesss...... lol
---
Same experience with the Robco building in the Mire. 9 out of 10 times it's a game killer.
---
LOL same my friends who always give me crap about my "low" damage were getting one shot by it and I facetanked it using my vamp laser gat. shush you glass cannon nerds.
---
Whoa tells me you are sitting heavy. Seems I’ve been getting mostly heavy weapons too unfortunately for my one handed melee/ rifle build.
---
Dont they scrap down? Im sure iv found 4 or 5 even tho i dont have the quest yet but i keep hitting scrap all and poof its gone again.
---
My bad XD I was doing Feed The People.
---
Bethesda Launcher - upper left corner button - Account Management - change display name. 
---
You can only change it once every three months, can confirm it changes in-game name.

Or just add a text chat..
---
Not everyone can hear/talk..
---
Try walking to the mine instead of fast traveling. I’ve read that sometimes clearing the cache will help, but I’ve never tried it myself and don’t know the ramifications of doing so. You might also try to get a friend to go with you, have them go in the mine, then fast travel to their location. 
---
Bad comes to worse say a prayer to Todd because his holiness has already stated that “It just works.”

I thought you could always craft sugar once you harvested a snaptail reed. It would be cool if you could make pepper out of firecracker berries or something, but who needs that much pepper?
---
aaw so cute!! on day they will grow up to be big and strong power armors! be carefull around puberty age not much more dangerous than a raging prepubescent nuclear powered set of armor.
---
That's when they start to sneak out together at night and vandalize mailboxes...

Nurse probably makes the most sense but that bear looks screwed 😂

Do you have 1 fertiliser i could grab to test?

Wow sounds like I lucked out!
---
It seems a lot of people have issues with WesTek. I can enter once, however, if I die and try to reenter, my game freezes.
---
Thank you very much for the link and your answer!
---
you could only  get lights that flash from faschnat event if i remember i have strobe,twinkling and blinking red and white lights on string i can put up in my camp
---
what platfrom do you play on.
---
i have a few melee weapons you might like to use :) im on ps4
---
Would miss out on my low lvl 30 alt that sells legendaries below 1k, sold a 3* furious/ss/+1 strength for you guessed it, 1k. Vanguards 3* combat chest piece with Assassins/AP refresh? Yup 1k.
---
Your base is SO COOL. &lt;3
---
My only tip would to keep your health above zero.
---
My lvl 14 guy killed a 124 with landmines! Pretty sure he was bloodied and i actually spotted him first and tried to run... I just happend to have mine equiped so i tossed 2 and heard the boom. He must have marsupial right on top of one lol. Only kill ever in pvp 😁
---
Open up all boarded houses? So say bye to server performance?
---
Good ole TSE
---
Probably my biggest complaint about this game is the lackluster outfit and weapon aesthetics. A Nuka World raider look would be a great start to more appealing gear.
---
I read this yesterday and today I got that challenge. Thought of you and this post.
---
Thanks :) also holy shit it actually worked!! Didnt think it would, maybe a purifier is possible!
---
I have numerous mule accounts so I just collect junk and give it away in bulk if I like a lowbie
---
Harpers ferry. Some of the super mutants have them plus the dead npcs around the church usually have a few. Also most of the raider camps usually have npcs with them and have explosive boxes
---
Oh heck, just saw this. Still need it?
---
RadiCool is a good perk for a bloodied melee build, your strength increases the more rads you have. 
---
Nerd rage is a good perk to have as well, when your health is below 20% you get +20% damage output.
---
Mine has 420 carry weight with the standard lvl 50, but this is due to my build and gear combination of bloodied/unyielding. Your PA can go up 100 more with calibrated shocks, my X01 does 360 carry weight  and my excavator does 460. Looking forward to getting the armored mod for the back pack and try it out.
---
Are these still wrong?
---
https://nukacrypt.com/
---
It doesn't have the view tbh also I don't like the pre war look of the grass
---
Ah I'm dumb, at least people know what I'm talking about regardless
---
Get radicool perk, build up strength to 12, get the adrenal reaction mutation, it’s basically a bloodied mutation same way as bloodied legendaries. Get starched genes perk so radaway doesn’t cure mutations. Stack rifleman/slugger perk cards
---
The ass kicking (normally blodied) melee meta requires some significant perk and mutation  investment to make you less squishy, especially if you're going unarmed.
---
First but perhaps least importantly, ditch the bear arm and get an actual legendary, either anit-armor, instigating, furious, or bloodied unarmed melee weapon(s). deathclaw gauntlet is preferred by many people, but anything from a power fist to a mole miner gauntlet to a boxing glove will work as a starter.
---
Anyway, second up is perks. You need to maximize outgoing damage and minimize incoming. Outgoing is obvious: melee damage perks, bloody mess, nerd rage, and incisor are absolute musts. At least 1 rank of adrenaline should also be considered mandatory. Beyond that, many folks consider radicool to be a no brainer. I switch it out with ghoulish or fireproof depending on the situation, but it's definitely a nice STR buff.
---
Incoming is a bit more circumstantial, but some things are also must haves. You need Serendipity to eliminate 45% of all incoming damage. Blocker is almost as important as it reduces all incoming melee damage by 45%. If you can spare the perk and AP points, Dodgy is a nice friggin addition. Beyond that, there's things like junk shield and ricochet that can provide additional protection, but they're very situational and shouldn't be considered until you've got more points than you know what to do with.
---
Next, mutations: you need twisted muscles, speed demon, grounded, talons, adrenal reaction, scaly skin, and marsupial. Some would say healing factor, but that's up to you. I prefer getting the full benefit of my bufftats or overdrive or whatever.
---
Finally, armor. If possible, get at least 2 pieces that have the sentinel effect to help mitigate another 30% of damage (or something like that) 75% of the time. Ideally, those will be unyielding sentinel pieces. The rest of your armor should probably be either 3 more pieces of unyielding or some combination of bolstering, unyielding, and/or a chameleon piece. If you can find a piece of autostim armor that fits in there it can be helpful as well.
---
After all of this, you'll still be a little squishy, but you'll be putting out somewhere between 1-3k per swing. They might hit you once, but they won't live long enough to hit you a second time, and then you have a moment to pop a diluted stim.
---
I typically run at 46hp. I don't like the quite so up close and personal nature of unarmed, so I play 2h bloodied melee. My favorite weapon is a bloodied baseball bat with +ss, 90% reduced weight, and a heated coil mod. When I'm in the sweet spot it does over 1,200 per swing.
---
I had a glitch where I had two water purifiers in succession and the far one would not work. I had to split them up and add a separate post connector for each unit. They both then wired from their individual posts to the same, third, connector post and worked fine.
---
Yeah you as much as sneeze on it with splash damage the darn thing dies.
---
The super sledge in demand is All Rise which has guaranteed weight reduction. 
---
People who really want to max out melee damage wouldnt really use sledgehammer. All Rise is a solid 'side arm' considering weight and performance and is relatively easy to obtain.
---
He probably liein'
---
Personally, I’ve only bought a few cheap serums. I’ve seen people selling some decent legendary weapons at fair prices but so much of what people have is just common junk that’s overpriced.
---
Those look diff than the ones over the weekend. So I think they updated them with the new ones.
---
Try the cliffs to the east of white springs. It’s a good location for sellers and has a great high elevation view.
---
God, I hope so. Those things are awesome.
---
Flatground is overrated. Being in the skies is were it's at!
---
Affordable 3 stars, bulk, plans, free ammo*, stims - little bit of everything really. I have the * because I'm willing to pay for ammo, but not the ammo that drops more often than a mole rat comes out of the ground. If  that garbage is marked for even 1 cap I bypass the whole ammo section. Call me fickle, but there was a point in this game everything was dropped if you didn't use it.
---
That being said, if anyone's got a line on plan rarity/commonality I'd appreciate it - love to tank those to free too, like Chemist Workbenches.
---
I know a spot but not where it is on the map. I walk past it every few days.
---
It's flatish as it's farm land which also has corn tato and cranberrys (not diseased)
---
The only downside is the water. While Yes it has water and it's drinkable. The water is a small well about 1 meter in diameter. Your character can squat in it and that's about all it's good for.
---
The boxing glove? I've gotten that too.
---
I still need a house tho btw my style of building is pretty realistic like it looks like an actual real life house I kinda need flat ground
---
Vault 51 has a pivotal role in the next upcoming update. I’m not sure about the others however. I don’t think they’ll all be opened in one update but I could be totally wrong.
---
Hey, thanks!

In all honesty none of the fallout games and even to a greater extent elder scrolls games really care about faction requirements. In fallout 4 I was able to be the general of the minuteman, a brotherhood member, a railroad member, and am institute member all at once. Being the general give me no perks really storywise. Being "being overseer" could give certain benefits, maybe when you win and are crowned overseer you gain access to the overseers office where you can pick up a unique weapon or clothing accessory? Then to fix the ability to play again maybe the computer is damaged in the fight and forgets who you are when you leave the vault
---
Dunno
---
I let a lower level player have at 'er with the legendary .... and he frittered away the event to afraid to engage.  Event Failure.   It can go the other way too.  Kill it quick ... everybody wins.
---
thank you🥰
---
thank you!
---
Yup , i only use PA against sbq if needed. Started playing without...so far so good , needs more testing 😁
---
grab serendipity, blocker, fireproof, nerdrage and dodgy(get unyielding pieces for extra AP)
---
adrenal reaction
---
if you go melee than yeah go for the strength perks 
---
you could also grab crit savvy and grim reapers sprint
---
Saw a LV80 Legendary Sheepsquatch running like a bitch from an Albino Radstag. (Pretty sure he was running to come kill me but it still looked funny)
---
He stopped running after a few good hits from my All Rise Sledge. (And copious amounts of self stimpakulation.  )
---
Please let us know if they work. Also, if you're on xbox and want help I'll join you.
---
Iron Fist increases punching damage and incisor does help as well.
---
I would think the bathrobe does too, right?
---
As far as we know...
---
Hmm, I’m baffled on what they’re going to be used for though? Because clearly they won’t be functional Bc if the no NPC thing.
---
One of the vaults already has a full interior inside, and a terminal with a secret message for anyone able to glitch in- this was discovered maybe 2 or 3 weeks into the release. Also, bethesda has already announced their plans for the vaults - endgame raid-like content. Although, who knows what that will actually end up looking like based on their endgame record with fo76...
---
They have already made areas that were buildable in the past off limits.  All that happens is the player has to move their camp.  So the possibility of future use doesn't mean the OP's idea shouldn't get implemented.  
---
And I seriously doubt they have plans for the majority of the currently empty houses.
---
Trying now, left my extra key cards in my stash had to run back
---
Plans. Just about any plans I can get my hands on.
---
Yep. Look around and you'll find quills and dead super mutants.
---
He's probably one of those [console poors](https://i.redd.it/4y9d7q68ca121.gif).
---
I recall someone posting here about going from level 1-50 without using a perk card or completing a single quest. They were very resourceful and used every single grenade they could find, upgraded what they could without perks (presumably pipe weapons), captured workshops and did events for xp and better gear, etc.
---
Practically naked? Are you referring to Unyielding armor?
---
Hey that sounds just like me!
---
You nuking prime? PS4?
---
Thank you! I’m strongly considering doing this lol
---
if you're still stuck it looks like nukacrypt is updated.
---
Yes but i cant find the card to make either one. I suspect i keep scraping it.
---
Again, what would it be used for? Maybe worldwide player base? Lol I have no clue, but what would be awesome is if we had at least One NPC that would give us more insight on the vault
---
Shhhh, don't tell everyone
---
Its a question stupid bot.
---
Uh, can you not?
---
Does wearing nothing count? Because it should.
---
Possible? Sure.    
---
Fun? Reasonable? Worthy of the time? Probably not but hey, you do you.
---
I figured Iron Fist would work, alongside some mutations as well! So you're saying the Incisor perk does apply the 75% armor penetration to bare hands? (No weapon)
---
I just want them to release private servers so people can mod the workshop system. I want to see overlapping CAMPS and persistent CAMPS after log off
---
I don't think they'll do that for a few years because everybody will just use private servers for cheats
---
I keep one if those (3* Chefs spiked Rolling Pin - faster swing speed, executioner's, blocking) for low level areas and I wear a Chef's hat.
---
considering you can get a second CD key for like 3-5 bucks you could just do this for yourself running a 2nd copy of the game
---
Furious stacks up 5% per shot to a cap of 50%, to the best of our knowledge and testing. Misses do not reset stacks; unclear if hitting a different target resets stacks, i believe that’s untested.
---
Halifax’s it’s a suggestion u pleb
---
Has he been pretty useful?
---
I think of you move your camp, even if it’s just a couple of feet, it will repair everything and you’re only out the caps that it costs to move.
---
I agree with almost all of that, but I'm not rolling for armor until they fix the stupid wood armor bug. I can live with the roughly 1/60 chance that I get a bugged assaultron head, but I'm not gambling on a 1/8 chance of getting 2 or 3 star wood armor that regresses to 1 star if I don't immediately scrip it.
---
It has chosen you!
---
Also like that in runescape
---
If someone has 556 or 45 ammo for 1 cap each, I buy all of it, every time I see it. This game is so much more enjoyable without grinding for ammo components.
---
Absolutely not.
---
I mean, just look at him.
---
That’s exactly the type of answer I was looking for. Thank you. Can anyone confirm?
---
Thank you so much, I think those are exactly what I need
---
Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition
---
And we'll all stay free
---
Praise the Lord and swing into position
---
Can't afford to be a politician
---
Praise the Lord, we're all between perdition
---
And the deep blue sea
---
Yes the sky pilot said it
---
Ya gotta give him credit
---
For a sonofagun of a gunner was he
---
Shouting Praise the Lord, we're on a mighty mission
---
All aboard, we ain't a-goin' fishin'
---
Praise the Lord (Praise the Lord) and pass the ammunition
---
Nah I abandoned it, lucky I realized before putting  in the keycard
---
I agree, the wood armor is a deal breaker. I do normally go 2 star and have had really great luck so far. Still waiting for a BE handmade though haha
---
Yeah, or bolstering, or sentinel, or some combination thereof. I mainly just meant "not in power armor", which is how most people run queen battles.
---
*prostate exam*
---
Projecting much? I have nothing to say to you lol.
---
I gunned him down. He was likely eating someone this morning.
---
Was this in Survival server?
---
I make it a point to kill all enemies whenever I visit a camp. I also make sure I shut all the doors! I also had to build a mega camp to place all my food and Brahmin in because people were just looting all my shit!
---
Yeah, and that sell back cap limit makes it hard. I don't want to give up all the 3* items I have, but I always have too many items being dragged around. I'll break down and vendor them one day. I just have a mindset that I have to keep 'em for scrip fodder, so I unconsciously hoard.
---
Well, at least we know now where the purveyor gets her stuff.
---
You're welcome, please keep us posted!
---
I considered doing a play through where I don't pick any perks that would affect combat. Just pick things like woodchucker, green thumb, pharma farmer, etc. I could be the ultimate scavenger.
---
An easy way to tell is sneak up on swan and punch him without it. Then server hop and punch him (make sure he's the same level or hop again) with incisor on.
---
It may have been fixed but I still have thousands of items to scrap. I would sell them if I needed the caps but even that would take way too much time that I don't find it worth it. Kind of disappointing that this post is getting downvoted but I guess people don't want to see these kind of things. I get it but it just sucks that I can't build in my camp anymore :(
---
Annnd yet here you are. Insulting me because you don't like this game.
---
Weapons you're going to want go without saying... 
---
For gear, if you're playing solo you'll want 4 Unyielding piece's and one chameleon, in group play go all Unyielding. 
---
You don't need to put any points in Endurance. The only perk you need under that stat is radicool because you will always have over half your health bar full of rads at any given time . If it suits your play style you can have a rank or two of Fire Proof as well, but don't waste anymore points in Endurance for this build.
---
It's beneficial to have high Strength and Perception. You'll have the option to go Melee, Rifles and Heavy Weapons by doing this. You will need to swap cards when you want to change these between specializations, but it's nice to have free access to all these classes at the higher levels of your build. Also I can't recommend Barbarian enough for a Bloodied build. It really helps keeping you tanky with a low health bar.
---
If you primarily play solo then you're going to want a good amount in Agility. You'll want max sneak, covert operative and escape artist with as many ranks of adrenaline as you can squeeze in. This will greatly increase your damage output. 
---
Intelligence is going to be a variable. You need at least Nerd Rage, but you can add more points for Gunsmith, or the PA related perks if you want to be optimized for when you're wearing PA.
---
Under luck and since you're going to want Adrenal Reaction starched genes is a must. Class Freak isn't required, especially if you only have the one mutation... But if you're running multiple then yes, get it. Bloody Mess is also definitely worth while. Serendipity is also a worthwhile option.
---
Charisma is obviously going to depend on how much you team play... If you're going solo then Lone Wanderer is the obvious pick, but Tenderizer is also a good option. Suppressor can also be considered to help with survivability.
---
This statement is correct. Usually costs 40 caps but everything is repaired. You will have to rebuild your camp
---
556 ammo, violet flux, and ballistic fiber.
---
The Hippie In Over Their Head build hahaha
---
They are working. Thx
---
😳😁😍 wow
---
I would make a note whenever you find one so you know all locations where legendaries spawn, then hop from location to location
---
 I hunt them for food mostly. ;)
---
Oh, holy shit that's a good idea. I'll make some old long haired hippie looking dude who just wanders appalachia scavenging for shit. Kind of like Doc in Z Nation.
---
Players should have a minimum contribution requirements to get any rewards.
---
Something like have x amount of harvested feeds for the troughs or deal a minimum x damage to receive rewards from the event itself or final boss.
---
I pretty much stopped doing anything with those after level 30 aeons ago. Wasn’t worth it. Do the treasure maps instead
---
Go to white springs or westek and duke it out.
---
Ok thx
---
Thats another question i had lol i found the spot of 1 map. 100% im in the area but i dont know what im looking for? A chest or an ammo crate? I just have no idea lol
---
I’m trying to get to lvl 26 and get the travel agent perk
---
I completed mine collecting ash rose on the roof tops of Lewisburg (it was the only thing i was collecting), not sure if it matters but i was using green thumb.
---
Event: AWOL Armaments can spawn several legendaries. Campfire and Arktos Pharma events also have legendaries at the end. The latter can spawn more since you need to fight many creature waves.
---
Why do they even put this dumb shit in the game? On that note I have a boxing glove on sale for 25000 caps.
---
Aside from what the other folks here have said I would like to add that the chameleon effect on armor stacks. If you're going to go a stealth crit type build using more than one piece is a big help. I clear west Tek with an bloody war drum without getting out of caution with 5 pieces.
---
From all the leaked audio files it's pretty much confirmed.
---
It's a mound on the ground.
---
It works off of a vats lock so I have to assume that if you can't target them it won't work.
---
If Encryptid event happens...lots of dying on water.  You just need to live long enough yourself to stim someone.
---
I'm trying this first thing tomorrow.
---
Damn right. I would much rather buy shells for 1 cap than take yet another tour of one of the high schools gathering plastic.
---
Set as my background lmao
---
Horde events, One Violent Night, AWOL Armaments, Uranium Fever all give legendaries. If the main farming grounds are too crowded just go for a hike, legendaries spawn all over the place. The three areas you  mentioned only get farmed because there's a lot of mobs that spawn in those relatively small areas... And the more mobs that spawn the more chances of a legendary spawn. If you hike through Appalachia you'll run into legendaries quite a bit, especially if you stick to the roads where random encounters can happen.
---
Ah ok. I went thru that late last year iirc. 
---
Do it once and it will be gone
---
5k for it
---
Wait that's not how trading works already? Well, what did I expect from a studio that does unusable keybinds for 10 years... -.-
---
Its an energy weapon
---
Is that pink bear holding a Q-tip? Er nevermind I don't think I want to know.
---
I typically sell ballistic fiber (around 100+) every third day or so.
---
I have over 100 units right now available for purchase.
---
I won't be back on until tomorrow morning though.
---
I am on PC.
---
IGN: pokerplayr
---
If I see someone selling plans for chemistry benches, mole miner gauntlets, or mr handy blades I know I'm probably done with that shop. If you have space in your stash I can see listing them for free for the handful of people who might not have them, but charging money for those is just dumb.
---
Yup, they patched that. For some reason it still works with the windmill, though.
---
I just placed a blueprinted blackberry bush on a campfire so maybe it still works for all the campfire ones. Whats the windmill one?
---
Events-  Leader of the Pack(3 1 stars), Uranium Fever(3 1-3 stars), AWOL Armaments(1 1-3 star), One Violent Night(1 1-3 star).  Just hitting each of them once should get you about half of the daily(Unless you actually get a good drop).  Uranium Fever is probably the best for farming, but the drops are capped at lvl 40 so it's strictly for scrip if you are higher level.  I've also bought 2-3 star stuff from players when I see it, anything under 100 caps I've scooped up.  Nuked Whitespring is still the best hands down, but the events are pretty consistent.
---
This is my problem overall  
---
true enough they were not "garbage" from the purveyor- first roll a bloody gatling  second a two shot fatboy   
---
but enemy drops tend to be garbage heavy guns and I am not a heavy gunner
---
Nuke Whitesprings. Kill shit. Go do something else for 60-90 minutes while other people have their fun. Go back to the nuke zone once everyone else has left. Kill more ghouls. Exchange all the crap and keep the 1-3 piece worth selling.
---
It honestly should and so should the perk for looting extra meat off the corpses of dead animal. It would be a QoL change needed to justify using the perk cards outside of looting nuked floral. Using a supposed character changing perk .0000000001% of the time you play isn't really a perk at all at that point and should just be made passive and then have new perks that effect that aspect of the game play in some way like the abundance events for plants in regions or make a new category of sub perks. Heck try making it like Miss Nanny floral quest like the backpack, make it more engaging rather then I put a point in it cause I have a bazillion levels. Imagine doing events like the backpack then having sub perks that are seperate from the main 50, lets say 10 for all secondary perks that would/could then effect weight/plants/meat/etc, what ever the devs what to. The world is there canvas for them to draw and color in.Creativity can be dangerous but lack of it is deadly. Lets see a new light on perks and the system of how it works. IMO, but I love all of this game.... except the camera &gt;.&gt;
---
People simply need move their C.A.M.P. around their base and test where they spawn in after fast travel...problem is, this tactic can also be used to trap people maliciously.
---
TTK is too low
---
The White Knight perk in agility is a must outside power armor.
---
The mound usually looks discolored compared to the dirt around it. Except in the mire where it can be covered with grass. Once you find it, the words “mound dig” will display onscreen.
---
Plans I don't have. Cheap junk I use regularly. Literally I just found an area in The Forest with about 10 different camps. "The Mall" was on every Camp wall. As you can expect, they all had the same thing at retail prices also. Lol. It was pretty cool to see though. 
---
I sometimes buy the 40mm if they're at 2 caps. But most people have super inflated prices. 
---
How about you?
---
It's an endurance perk. With that and a dense mod for chest armor I take almost no damage from a mini nuke.
---
The area i found one was in the forest so tonz of grass ill have to go check again. thx!
---
I buy plans. I look for reasonably priced legendary weapons and armor. Each has to meet my threshold of 20 caps per scrip value (i.e., a 1\* legendary weapons should cost 100 caps and a 1\* legendary armor should be 60 caps... unless either has a remarkable legendary quality). Anything that is priced over that amount, I won't buy it, unless I plan to use it as a primary or secondary weapon/armor.
---
That being said, I have had difficulty finding enough quality items on which to spend my caps the past 2+ weeks (since the legendary vendor arrived). After draining my bank balance of caps on items like the plans for signs and letters, it takes me about 3 days to replenish my coffers (I actually had to pull almost all of my items from my vendor availability last night because a buyer was purchasing items at such a fast clip, I came perilously close to exceeding the 25,000 cap max while he was still buying items). After 3 days or so, the whole go around starts over again.
---
is there a list of rewards yet for project paradise?? im just curious if i have them all or if i should still be running it.
---
You don't have to have VATS locked. You just have to aim down the sights and wait for the ping. I've tried to hit some cloaked level 46 assaultrons and it never pinged for me. I assumed they were not targetable while cloaked.
---
Nuclear Winter will definitely open at least two of the four vaults. 94 is one...hints are 51 might also. (51 is currently unmarked , up near Crosshairs in far north region. )
---
Sounds like a video concept for Captainoob.
---
Windmill can be placed on a small square rug, then blueprinted. Blueprint can then be placed on dirt, and afterwards moved anywhere, dirt or not.
---
You say muties in 1-2 swings, I say mirelurk queens and scorchbeasts in 2-3 swings. At some point it becomes overkill for anything other than SBQ fights, but it can be fun to just run around smashing everything.
---
Frag grenades are in every raider spot. Each dead raider body is either frags or gunpowder. You can farm those and get a lot from them.
---
I started to pvp in power armor because I got tired of buying the stealth boys. Put a stealth mod on my x01. They have to hit you once before they can vats you.
---
I make sure when I see a good camp to message the owner. :)
---
Last bight my fiance said," its gonna be really bad." 
---
I laughed... and then i got an instigator +1perc , bash damage bolt action... the pain is real.
---
At least let us choose a weapon class like Heavy or 2 Hand.
---
Wait those can be auto
---
No my Brahmin :(
---
Gotta love being downvoted for the preservation of language 👍
---
My Two Shot exploding harpoon gun does over 1000 damage per shot and has 45% armor penetration with the stabilized perk.
---
Alright this wins for the name sticky steaks and shakes farm... I like it!
---
Best reply right here. Especially when white springs is nuked. That being said, the glowing ones don't give out nearly as much XP as they did in the beginning. Man there was some leveling happening there. I'd level up 5 times in an hour's time. It was crazy. 
---
I digress...still a good option though.
---
Yeah you can turn a railway rifle into an automatic.
---
Many if not most events will have a legendary mob in there somewhere -- Horde events and Uranium Fever are particulary for for farming trash legendaries for the chipper. Many of the faction fetch quests will reward armor, etc and sometimes that's legendary (BoS quests are quite notable in this area). Some CAMPs will be overweight low level alts just selling their 1\* trash legendaries for ~50 caps just to move the merch and I've been having good luck lately with that.
---
Besides that I'd just keep and eye out on your walkabouts. Legendaries are surprisingly common now-a-days and it's not hard to run into a legendary frog every now and again.
---
Basically a worse harpoon gun without retrievable ammo and the cannonballs are hard to find
---
I’ve honestly never seen an auto one before. Wow. I need one now.
---
Whenever you see higher levels farming white spring follow them and tag as much you can for the xp. When I was a power level I had many higher levels take me under their wing and help me making sure I'd get shots in and helping giving me extra stuff. The fallout community is amazing so you should do alright.
---
Nuka cola plant has less than you think but i still find 6 or so there. Also there is that frat house guy who has all kinds of flavors and couple more in the rest of the house. 
---
Really i just save em up for a couple of runs then put like 20ish for sale. They are gone same day most of the time. 
---
Also also my base is right near a train station so ppl get to come by for free when they are selling to the vendor. That helps.
---
Just farm a white springs
---
Us console plebs gotta pay for it 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
---
It looks raised
---
Yeah, it only changes to like 7-10 less dmg per a shot, but bumps to rate of fire from 10 to 75.
---
only way I got it to move was by moving my hole camp.
---
It's posts like these that make me appreciate my mountaintop abode, where the only enemy that gets anywhere close is a vertibird passing below that you have to aggro first.
---
The ammo is so cheap to make too, I def need to get a Bloodied FFR one. I now know where to spend my Caps ty dude
---
I actually like this idea :D
---
Happens to me too since the last patch. Have to exit to desktop and restart the game.
---
Weapons can't have Int modifier.  Only STR, PER, AGI, and END.
---
Amen. There's a special place in Crystal Caverns for those types of people.
---
Serums at a reasonable price, ammo 308/shotgun/5mm, plans I don't have, cheap 1 stars to turn in, stable flux, magazines, also....one crafty salesman was selling frogs with the specimen jars!!!!
---
Best legendary combos dps wise for auto handmade from best to worst
---
Bloodied +25% fire rate
---
Bloodied Explosive
---
Anti armor +25% fire rate
---
Anti armor explosive
---
Furious 25
---
Furious explosive
---
Two shot 25
---
Two shot explosive
---
Those are all the « competitive dps » effects all others are subpar. Two shot is better than furious if target dies in less than 5 shots, furious becomes stronger than two shot after the 5th shot. So for semi auto explosive becomes better than 25fire rate and two shot better than furious. Rest is same
---
Needs to be a hold function at the very least.  Same with drinking toxic water.  Poorly thought out.
---
Then you were **really** lucky, because you can get the plans only at the Enclave vendor for around 19k caps.  They were also probably duped, or that guy farmed 'em hard back when the SBQ dropped the plans
---
I used to do that and no one comes for the same reason ppl think ( i do as well) that it is some time off hustle in the game. now I just send them text and it works better for me ppl actually show up for the events.
---
Well that's good to know.
---
bcos we paid for their game?
---
True and that might be better.
---
Oh gawd, not the water. I run through combat and try to loot enemies or creatures in the water before I accidentally drink the tainted water. 😱 I prayed that I didn't get a disease.
---
AllI can think of is how much they all weigh!!!! 😂
---
Well, what other mutations did you lose when you cleared them? Did you unequip/reequip the weapon? Try a relog? Gauss is an energy weapon, and is effected by Grounded.
---
Do you fucking really
---
I go for 3star Melee weapons, only.
---
I want a kickass shovel.   Executioner's, +swing speed, +Str/Luk would be best, but really.  I just want a legendary shovel.
---
You know I was on my bank alt lvl 30 and I walked past there omw to something else and I got a 3* high level Sheepsquash I jumped on the shack but couldnt do enough damage as all he had was weight reduction perks.
---
Ofc everytime I encounter it now on my main outside of Project Paradise it is always just a 1*. :(
---
Lol this
---
Just drop your camp device down again it repairs your stuff but you gotta rebuild it again
---
In all honesty, No. I don't think they can. I've got the ability to make the automatic Piston Receiver and the Prime Receiver, but no Prime Automatic Receiver. Unless I've not found it, I don't think it exists.. Unfortunately.
---
Thanks. I’m gonna give it a try.
---
Check your misc tab for gunpowder and ore. It's often overlooked as I know I've done it many times
---
Whats the good word?
---
Yes lol but I have nearly zero self control 😂
---
Clothing I don't have if it's cheap, plans I don't know and good deals on legendary weapons/armor.  
---
I've sold quite a bit of gear at my camp.  Literally every magazine I put up for 30-50 goes immediately, while exactly zero bobbleheads for 50-75.  Any plans I'd want more than 100 for I just stash, the rest go fairly well for 50-75 caps.   Mutation serums go like hot cakes at 250 each, it's all extra to me so I don't mind basically giving them away; as you could buy them then double your money at a bot vendor.  I put 32 3 star armors in my machine today and sold 6, all between 400-800 caps.  I have three explosive weapons for less than 1500, none sold, but I buy up cheap explosives if I see them.
---
Do you have lmq with vazs cost? =D
---
 I saw the same first few weeks of the vending machines I couldnt keep them stocked then it slowed down a bunch. 
---
its just the natural cicle of the beast, ppl need a few days to collect caps to be able to buy stuff, it was slow for like a week and then last weekend i started selling stuff again.
---
Hmm, damn. The railway rifle is so much more powerful as an automatic. It would truly be unfortunate if there isn't a prime automatic reciever.
---
Fair enuff, in most games I just prefer a balance aproach. Different strokes 4 different folks.
---
If I see plastic or screws for a reasonable price 8m buying everything. Plans I don't have I'll weigh up how muvh I want it depending on how many caps I have. Weapons I'll look at but few suit my play style are reasonably priced
---
Serums, plans, weapons, and armor
---
well, looks like I'm wrong, or modding the armor type (buttressed, etc) changes the visuals a ton. I just switched through a bunch of sturdy/heavy raider/robot/metal armor I have, none looks like that photo. The heavy raider chest looks like that, minus the pipe cage over the head- that may be because FO4 had 3-4 different models for each chest for each type, whereas 76 only has 1 afaik. That photo looks like it's from FO4
---
some of the scorched at ford defiance wear asylum uniforms :3 . i have seen other variations like wearing a jumpsuit.
---
I don't know. Some of their choices are odd to say the least.
---
I play Bloodied rifleman with exactly 35 hot points, but almost never die. You need high DR and ER like 400 thats amost like power armor and you mostly need sentinel armor when im standing still damage i take is reduced by about 80% so ye not going to die. Only dangerous situations is when enemies melee stagger you the 80% DR is gone so stay away from melee enemies
---
I will almost always buy 45 and 556 ammo at 1 cap per. Lightweight trash legendaries priced at 50-100 per star or less I’ll usually grab up too, just to trade in for scrip. Also plans, I know most, but plenty of others don’t, so definitely stock them.
---
I went to a nuked whitesprings and got ton of rads and got hit by level 68 ghouls. Survived for a few minutes with rad x and punctured so much holes in my body with all the stimpaks before finally dying after two hits by some legendary ghoul (two stars, i think). Didn't go back to retrieve my loot as all my weapons and armor are broken.
---
I was level 13.
---
Now I know why that's an unlucky number.
---
I think we all had that problem at first, but the longer you play the more you learned what you need/want and you become more efficient at stash management. I would suggest only pick the ammo you use/sell, tag for search the mats you need, and most off all stop been a horder lol
---
Long press is needed for a few things. I hate the transfer and reload buttons are the same. Go to reload mid fight and next thing I know I'm transfer menu with a corpse
---
I’m a crazy ass horder 😂
---
You have to restart it and more robots come out...
---
AFAIK every time you crash, these automatically upload to Bethesda, which is what "CrashSender.exe" is for, and also why I notice a spike in upload in TaskManager after I've crashed.
---
Ammo perk card? Maybe this is what I need.... 
---
Maybe I bring too much guns with me. I usually bring a hunting rifle, combat rifle, shotgun, revolver, pipe gun and a knife...maybe that’s too much?
---
Nvm then. Thought I was actively making a difference. Guess not lol
---
If there is I haven't gotten it in well over 100 runs through campfire tales.
---
Np!  If ya ever need a hand let me know ill shoot u an inv.
---
Bandolier I think it is. As you play you'll learn what guns are your favourites. I tend to have two or three weapons. Ones my favourite stealth gun, ones for high damage but slow reload that I only use when I really need to and another for swarms. It comes with experience. But yeah weight on misc tab can add up. Any missiles or mini nukes you have drop them as they weigh a lot
---
I think the game is telling you to do a Flamer build. Honestly it sounds tempting at times.
---
No way that is a one in a lifetime moment
---
That is way too many weapons.
---
This game has an economy. Availability and demand. That makes the prices. Yes, anything over 25k is ridiculous because only 25k is available per character. No, Dupers are not the answer. Giving us more cap space, more uses for spending caps on, and more ways to earn larger amounts of caps is the answer.
---
Asking Dupers to screw up the economy won't fix a single thing, my case and point being that the newest duped item wave of BE laser weapons costing barely less than pre dupe wave. Dupers are gouging players even with infinite availability of items. Dupers are trash in multiplayer PVP  games, no exceptions.
---
Found a guy selling the fasnaught winter man mask for 10 credits, bought it and resold it for 5000 credits. Probably could’ve gotten even more, but I’m pretty happy.
---
Fair enough. To be honest, I don't remember the 2nd and 3rd effects. All I recall was that it was exterminator's and the other 2 were useless. I backed out of the trade screen with mama murmur and immediately put it into the legendary wood chipper.
---
How many should I bring?
---
Saw him the other day. Felt fairly sorry for him, so had to shoot him to put him out his misery.
---
Sadly, no :\\ Sorry.
---
Mine doesn't actually crash as it does for some. I'm of the group whose game freezes, except unlike the "periodic, but will recover" freezes I mentioned, these ones do not recover. That's why I'd love for everyone to call the recovering ones "pauses" heh 
---
Nevertheless, no dumps are created when you End Task on the game unfortunately :\\  
---
For that matter, not every time my game crashes is a dump generated! "Crash to Desktop" do not, only the Crash with a dialoge box do in my experience. Surprisingly I encounter very few crashes of either type, though I sleep my computer, and don't restart it for months sometimes. For example, things were going rather well up until I restarted it recently, and after that it's been rough sailing. I think it's behind-the-scenes RAM timings that are adjusted during a reset vs a cold boot, as I'm not sure what else would cause such a "mood" with my computer.
---
At any rate, all the dumps I have now (4) were created after that restart *(I periodically delete them since they already have been sent off to Bethesda automatically)*, so their relevance in even the grand-scheme could be little, particularly on account of the overclocked state of my system heh  
---
That said, if I do ever experience a crash that's a "proper" crash, and a Dump is generated... I'll be more than happy to upload it! :)
---
I'm on ps4, thank you tho thats  a kind offer. I try to help others but cant do much at this level
---
Yeah I'm on ps4
---
I carry three shotguns. I have AAE, TSE and EE shotguns. I also carry a vampires axe that only weight .9 that I use for farming low level enemies for plastic or whatnot.
---
A bunch of different types of weapons means a bunch of different ammo types you need to carry.
---

I would buy all their stuff, and then tell a friend. ;)

Not to mention that same button also drops items if you happen to accidentally open your pipboy.  If they can't figure out button mapping at least let us customize it

Wear a tux and use a pool cue also

only just
---
I only sell the 100% ones. Seem to find plenty just with my ammo crate habit.
---
Almost never personally.
---
I have 3 str (1 due to mutations), some deep pocket mods and a backpack now for 255 total.
---
With my 2 guns and 200 ammo each i hover around 110 weight used and i can drive that down storing chems down to 10 on the main ones.
---
Take notice of what you need to fight, you'd be shocked at how you're constantly increasing chems and rarely using them.
---
it worked then it didnt, then it worked again and then it didnt work again, it was fixed with a hotfix (if I remeber correctly) and then with last patch it broke again.
---
 Felt the same way, and then rolled a Sentinel Assassin piece. Now she and I are good :)
---
Or just text chat... people need to stop asking for emotes all the time its an online game we need text chat

Don’t forget to eat a sweet roll (+3) or if you can’t make/find one, a mothman omlette (+2)
---
Person 1 posts item being traded up for a previously agreed amount as collateral. Person 2 provides collateral and receives item. 
---
Person 2 can then walk off with your item, or trade their item to you for their collateral back. People who won't give or try to lowball collateral are people you shouldn't be trading with anyway.
---
I haven't had a legendary from Tek in my last couple of runs, going to concentrate on Uranium Fever this week as I'd totally forgotten about that one, thanks for the reminder
---
Also running with a team increases the chances of multiple legendary mobs spawning, this at least in my experience is true. I usually run solo doing my legendary farming rout and get to about 4 legendaries out of 10 locations. 
---
But when running with a team we usually get 2-4 legendary mobs per location with at least one 2-3* mob in the mix.
---
I said this many times before. The fallout economy is screwed. In order to return to normality the following harsh but necessary steps need to be taken :
---
1. Allow only 1 character per player. You have multiple mules all with max caps. It's causing hyperinflation. Hence all items are going at crazy prices. 2. Reduce the amount of caps available from vendor bots. 1400c now allows for so much more convenience but also much easy access to this sum on a daily basis. In less than 10days you have 10k. Its painful but necessary. 3. To remove the excess caps floating around now, allow for buying of scrips or maybe even atoms. Both of which cannot be traded directly. Hence the legendary vendor now but still not helping much. 4. Duping has caused an imbalance of legendary items. I know Bethesda has already tried removing some but probably needs to follow up by not allowing double of any same legendary items for each character. This means a clean sweep on all characters and their stash.
---
These are just my humble but probably unpopular opinions. I would not be happy for it as well but I know the current state is just going to hit the fan in time to come.
---
Sadly, no. There's only one prime receiver for the railway rifle and it's semi-auto.
---
Source: Data-mining.
---
There's other honest player vendors out there I've come across that keep prices at or below 1k caps... they're just few and far between.
---
Yup same, at least its not just my game then!
---
How do you get a backpack?
---
Flooding the market with devalued goods would not fix the market. There are no solutions, only tradeoffs. There will always be incredibly rare and unique pieces dropping that people are hunting for, and if it exists when there isn't a dupe available, *or* those who dupe don't have access to it, then it remains tremendously valuable to those seeking it. From an economic standpoint, the issue is the supply of these items when compared to the in-game currency of caps. Every person has the potential to make a minimum of 42,000 caps every month *per character* simply from selling to vendors. This, plus the significant opportunity to get caps from players for ammo, scrap, etc. means that the high availability of caps which can be earned easily and in large quantities are not a good currency to use for items that are incredibly rare, and also have subjective value. Caps are great currency for goods that have the same relative level of ease to acquire- scrap, ammo, chems, most plans, etc. However, when it comes to very rare and subjectively priced items, the only logical currency is something similar- very rare and subjectively valued items, hence many things being "trade only." As long as amazing and unique pieces previously unseen by the general public are dropping, trade will still be the most sought after means by which high level players will buy/sell them. For example, I got a Vanguard/Sentinel/AP Refresh Trapper Arm from the Purveyor yesterday. I have never seen that exact piece before, and neither had my friends I play with. Therefore, that piece has tremendous value as a presumably one of a kind piece, or at least previously unseen piece. My suggestion to you is to farm legendaries, get your 150 scrip every day, and then every 2 days, turn in for 5 pieces of 3* Armor. You will inevitably get some amazing gear you can either use or barter with for better items. In addition to that Trapper Arm, I've also gotten two Life Saving/Sentinel pieces, a Powered/Cav arm, and other quality items from the Purveyor. Use that or other means to get what you're looking for, not a fruitless and radical request to completely destabilize the in-game economy.
---
I always use a mele weapon in this event but I am guilty of killing the legendary but it was by mistake as I was getting attacked by multiple creatures on the ground,I placed the spoils on the ground for anybody and left feeling bad.
---
Hitch on with a higher level player and tag high level mobs and have them knock em down. Run this awhile (places like whitesprings and/or nuke zones) and you’ll level up pretty quickly.  The 20s are a super awkward batch of levels in my experience. Also, if you’re 25, zip over to Garrahan and do the side quest to build excavator power armor. Build it right and you’re less squishy and can carry more :)
---
That's amazing.
---
West Tek while well rested and ideally on a Team and using the XP Perk.
---
Only if my health gets too high. +20 str from unyielding and radicool is pretty helpful
---
What?
---
xbox
---
I played solo for the majority of my hours, but when I finally started playing with others, I noticed a lot of people who play on teams have camps with multiples of the same bench, multiple beds, etc.
---
I didn't ever expect to have a ton of visitors at my camp (it's in the Mire built around an underground bunker). But when it got to the point that there were 4-8 people visiting simultaneously, I added one of every instrument, multiple beds &amp; cooking stations, etc. It's pretty fun when a bunch of people show up and all start jamming on the instruments simultaneously
---
i am on xbox, i will let you know though. i just finished re doing my base
---
There's a weapon in the data file called UnarmedHuman (also an UnarmedPowerArmor), which is probably what you're using with bare fists. These both have the keyword WeaponTypeUnarmed, and so would benefit from Incisor.
---
Yeah, I thought the whole Sheepsquatch thing was just the fake robot one and that was it. Was cool randomly coming across a real one.
---
Disease cure , I will buy all day long
---
I have same boxing glove for sale at half price
---
Play the Enclave questline and you’ll understand a bit more about why it’s considered stealing (and who you’re stealing from). 
---
Until then, it’s cool- no one actually calls them in, so you don’t go wanted by taking them. You do go wanted though from regular cargobots (which I think was a stupid thing for them to change). :)
---
If you are on PC set up a macro to do it for you
---
Buy them from player vendors. Lots of trash legendaries are put up for cheap. I value scrip higher than caps, so I don't mind paying. One way to think about it: 300 Scrip is five 3* Armor Pieces, since they're 60 scrip each. Based on how you value a guaranteed 3* will determine how you value junk 3* from player vendors. I'll honestly pay up for 400 or 500 caps from a 3* if it'll put me where I need to be to make my 150 scrip quota for the day.
---
Demo expert is multiplicative not additive people need to understand that its a trash perk 5 points for a measly 60% of 20% its nothing.
---
Imagine your gun doing 100 base damage, if it’s explosive it gets 20% extra damage so it is now 120 damage. Add 5 perk points from demo expert to increase that extra 20 damage by 60% which is 12 so your new damage is 132 up from 120 after spending 5 perk points... demo expert is trash after the explosive nerfs. Try your gun with and without it let me know
---
I always go out of my way to check around Watoga whenever i join a server. Normally I find 1 or 2 legendary bots for very little effort.
---
But can you charge the sword by pairing it with the charger on the wall? Anyone up for making a mod?
---
Gauss should be affected by Grounded. At least it used to be.
---
Also most Prime recievers ALSO buff your damage. People don't use them in general because it's often not a huge difference, and crafting the ammo to maintain them outside of queen fights is a PITA. Did you de-prime your Gauss? That would be the damage drop.
---
That's what I was thinking but I couldn't find anything confirming it. Everything I saw about sleepwear was about the pajamas
---
This is one of those "Beat all of Pokemon using only Magikarp" type things. Sure, it's probably possible, but I'm not sure how fun it would be.
---
Hm, that's a polite reason I'd never considered. I typically just get on the mic and say hey, sorry, I gotta log out... but that doesn't help much if they are away getting a snack or etc.
---
West Tek is fickle. My rule is if I get at least one legendary on the outside then run the full thing. There's usually legendaries on the inside in that case. If I clear the outside area and don't get a legendary then just move on.
---
I meant it like mitten squad who did a rolling pin playthrough of new vegas
---
If you kill it too quick, it sometimes screws up the event and it ends without event rewards. This has been known to happen for different events/legendary mobs, and continues to happen. Needs to be fixed.
---
Mostly legendaries and outfits I don't have and like.
---
Yeah idk some people have pet peeves I suppose
---
OP = Bearing51
---
Vault is now named 51.
---
Coincidence?
---
bug fixes. and Qol
---
But we already show a name, the account name, sowhat difference would it be to actually show the character name? It would be a great benefit for players that want to roleplay more and the people who wants to go around showing of bullshits will, as they already do, just choose a shitty account name anyway.
---
Do those, and I will stop playing.   Bet a lot if others would, too.
---
I love to build around structures too. But I have mixed feelings about this concept, cuz part of the excitement for me is stumbling across the one house which is open and has any empty space for building and isn't part of an official location. 
---
It was less exciting back when many of those houses were in out-of-the-way places where I got few visitors. But now that vending makes it visible on the map, I'm less concerned about a location that's easy to stumble across. 
---
If you haven't already used this one, one of my previous open houses is in the forest and quite easy to locate. It's right off the road between Camden Park and the Nuka-Cola plant. 
---
Monorail cars are also fun to build around and empty.
---
Is it shitty when ppl just take workshops in adventure for the forced pvp, yes.  But is it part of the game? Yes and we all have to get over it n accept it.  Dont feel bad for what's designed in the game.
---
And for those of us who don’t PVP...,,
---
I always make them into antibiotics
---
&gt; People can still kill you when you're passive though
---
How?  They can only kill you if you don't attack them?^*
---
(* outside of workshop contestation and team shenanigans)
---
Awh that's not bad i was under the impression that you fail and have to restart because the silo blows up and now you have to find another one.
---
Mods aren't officially supported for 76
---
Ahh. Sorry. I'm kind of new to fallout. I've only played 4/76. My ex got me into it, watching him play 4.
---
I'd like to add:
---
If you're low level (ie, &lt;50) or your build is sub-optimal, you will likely find it difficult to contribute.  But of you're set on participating try add control and stimpacking downed players rather than SBQ dps. 
---
You're not really going to do impactful damage on her, but thinning out the gun-zombies and various critters that show up makes it easier for the big damage to do its job.
---
This also applies to melee builds.  I get that you're waiting for her to land...but you could use your time doing add control while range tries to cripple her.
---
Depends how they do it, if there's no actual ball physics they'll probably be okay.  Fishing's relatively easy, just copy how WoW did it.
---
I always keep one good Troubleshooters Heavy Weapon with me for the Encryptid event. So many robots there the Troubleshooters is worth it. My current is a Troubleshooters Explosive with 90% reduced weight. With Bear Arms equipped too it weight next to nothing. i named it the "Synth Recall Command"
---
The vendor idea isn’t really that bad
---
I did at first, but once he started dropping F-bombs, I didn't feel guilty any more.
---
If it goes one way, bounty is gone. The other way, deat Penthouse Forum...

Will do it.

You switch to another server because that one was lagged to hell.

When that happens or I sit down by mistake, I wiggle the joysticks and sometimes it speeds up the animation for getting out of bed/a chair.
---
Is modding the game formally forbidden?
---
The one good thing about glowing molerats spawning in my camp is that I get plenty of nuclear material off them 😌
---
You're basically complaining about supply and demand.
---
Dupers running rampant = higher supply than the amount of demand = cheaper prices due to a flood of those duped items.
---
Dupers no longer running rampant = lower supply than the amount of demand = higher prices as a result of those items no longer being flooded.
---
Outside of that, the pricing people set on stuff is based off of current trends (A.K.A. demands) for specific weapons/armor (bloodied/assassins/sentinels/unyielding/explosive/etc.)  Meaning that if you get your hands on something like a Bloodied + Explosive weapon, odds are there are a significant amount of people out there who really want to get their hands on it, which leaves you in a position to command a decent price.
---
Ultimately though, it does simply boil down to whether or not anyone is paying any attention to the markets when posting items, and how much they personally value any of the items they sell.
---
I'll leave with this: Instead of asking for dupers to demolish the in-game economy again because you simply don't agree with someone else's price, just leave their shop and check other shops.
---
I can tag my second account alt who has Chameleon if we aren't teamed up and he's crouched in chameleon. I get the chime/red icon over his head. Haven't tried actually shooting though.
---
Kill all the things.
---
Do you have spotlights?
---
My turrets also watched as a scorched destroyed my fusion generator too!
---
I do. One for eatch spawn locations. But somehow the turrets ignored the muties this time.
---
Happens to me all the time. I've noticed that they enemies have to damage me before the turrets "see" them. Even then, they sometimes do literally nothing.

That would be terrifying, and awesome at the same time.

You can customize your button in settings
---
There are mods on nexusmods for it. I would try there bud.
---
Do you need an extractor to do the challenge? If not just find silver viens and just collect ore yourself. Or do the breach and clear event.
---
I always assumed future content will have the 'renovations' the robots of the Whitespring keep mentioning, as finally being finished, and we might even be able to rent a room perhaps.
---
I don’t feel like finding 30 silver veins when I can just set up and extractor honestly. What’s breach and clear?
---
They seem to look the other way for some that are out right now, but if you ask them, they’d say don’t do it. Anything OP and expect to get banned. Graphical stuff that only effects you, inventory management, and the like, seem to be ok. However I don’t plan on it. They update often enough that I don’t want to bother updating the mods that often.
---
Weightless + chameleon mutation. Sniper.
---
lots of rumors around either way i am going to continue playing the game without joining anything that has to do with pvp. That's why i run workshops late at night when everyone sleeps.
---
I agree with this so much. I really hate the tedious Tadpole stuff. If we could tame more creatures, get cards to buff them or something, that could be very fun
---
Then they are worthless. If I am away from my camp, they should defend it... or atleast try it.
---
Nah, those rooms are currently just empty. People who have glitched through found nothing exists behind them.
---
That would make a killer high level dungeon - raid on Whitesprings. Protect the vendors! Think the annoying running with Arkos, but point to point - enemies raid the main entrance, enemies raid the laundry mat/parking lot, then inside to a new floor where enemies are breaking in from the top of the building. Fight your way through to the roof and clear out a few waves... but, the fire station begins getting attacked, closely followed by the rear entrance - the final assault if you will.
---
Does picking a lock make you hostile to the camp or just wanted? I have wondered if lock picking can be used to get the the camp to initiate PvP?
---
An event in the ash heap. You basicly protect an ore drill thingy and it opens hatches every 20 seconds and you collect ore from them.
---
I stopped bothering putting up any defenses.  The most I've lost is a couple walls, and I need that build space!
---
how many atoms does it take
---
Put it behind walls
---
I have a couple questions. Have you used your railway with a prime reciever? Does it cost stable flux/ultracite to repair? Considering you keep getting stakes back from enemies, so there's not really a loss of ammo, do you think the dmg output with lower rate of fire is better to have than the automatic reciever?

---
I don't want some shitty fortnight.
---
People will always pay highly for the best. 1400 caps a day from selling the junk you come across, some people get 10k+ a day from their vending machines. It's beyond ridiculous to think selling some screws to a vendor lets you buy 2-3 god rolls a day. At that point the game economy would be so fucked that there would be no hope of ever restoring it. Trading wouldn't exist. It wouldn't be worth people's time to find others and meet up for trades. It wouldn't be worth their time to fill up vending machines. I don't know why it's so hard for people to understand this is a MMO
---
Aye, I'll do that next time.
---
I've noticed that happens when there are 4 or less people on it
---
If you don't have the Bucket List quest then you're scrapping a different camera. The new camera isn't junk - it ends up in MISC.
---
I want to enjoy pvp honestly but I'm there with you either focusing on my booze bizzy wizzy or just killing baddies.
---
Oh ok thanks I’ll try. Still not sure why silver extractors don’t give ore like all the others
---
A portable charger would be better than wireless as well lol
---
Its technically still reclamation day because the pip boy calendar doesn't move so hopefully we get a time skip in the future
---
I'm also sad to announce the thing I said about killing people pet's being still possible is also still a thing. Idk why Bethesda hasn't fixed it yet, but people can still destroy other people's houses and kill their pets with Enclave air strike grenades, as you throw the grenade, but the grenade is the one telling the server to drop a missile at x co-ordinates. So it would be like another entity not tied to the player damaging the place and pet, which would be considered fair as far as the server setup is concerned.  
---
I'm glad I haven't experienced it myself yet since I have some things in my camp too costly to be able to repair, so I'd have to go out farming items for an hour or two to repair it all again.
---
Still no dice. All the dialogue related to this quest seems to come from either MODUS or a Gutsy, not a Nanny.

By the way I am not being deliberately obtuse I just want to keep the spoilers to a minimum, some people get upset with those.

It’d be funny if you went into survival mode and random people were tagged “legendary [username/gamertag]”
---
I had this problem as well where I was just playing with a friend and a rando comes up tea bagging and trying to kill my newbie friend so I decided if he won't fight me (I was 26 he was 23 at the time) then we would go pay a visit to his workshop and take it. Ended up wasting a lot of stimpacks because I had to grab the station from inside a tool shed while trying to avoid his turrets/molotovs. Took it first try and boy did he die a lot (I'm not great at pvp) was worth the the 50caps.
---
Bethesda has still not contacted me about the issue or any issue I've had on this game so far.
---
I used power armor at 25
---
I hopped into power armor asap for leveling purposes. However heavy combat armour with BOS mod would do you well too.
---
Every power armor I found was like level 40+. Fusion cores are too rare also.
---
Keep a count of the Jetpack plans?   
---
Been fighting with Beth about this, they don't seem to realized the turned the Jetpack into the new "Motion Assist Servo's"
---
Grounded effects gauss rifle. Did you have adrenal reaction mutation before you cleared them all? If so that's probably what your missing now
---
hardened receiver and right perks does 120-150 damage.
---
A deathclaw spawns on the highway south of harpers ferry, it is always 61. Highest I have seen tameable but that should give it some staying power
---
Where do I find power armor and fusion cores? (I have 3 chassis but I can’t find armor my level to put on it)
---
I just had this happen yesterday.  I fast traveled to the enclave and someone had there camp right next to the entrance. I thought I was safe so I left the room for a drink came back being attacked by 3 f- ing scorched beast I tried repairing all there defense to help fight them off. After I killed them I repaired what I could but had to get the hell out before the nuke dropped.  Sorry if it was someone's camp here . But always be respectful all help out. Just think of it as your camp too
---
Yes they give ore for things like copper, black titanium, and aluminum but not for silver
---
True, AK47 is very heavy, but I have piece of armor that takes 20% of the weight and with the backpack I can carry so much it does not bother me.
---
Pacifist mode? Always have that on when in adventure land...
---
I always feel like i get better loot when i'm in a team
---
I used whatever I could scrounge up when I was that level. Today you can normally find someone to craft you up a fairly good set of armor. If you're on xbone look me up, gt is same as here without the underscore.
---
power armor is my go to for leveling by the time you craft decent gear you will have outgrown it. 
---
what you need is a ton of healing salve. start at vault 76 pick all blue flowers to the overseers camp then pick all the bloodleaf to hillfolk hotdogs by following the creek. make yourself 50 or 100 healing salve and you can heal tank just about anything. i killed a level 50 scorch beast at level 15 that way. green thumb and chemist help with that tactic.
---
Yes there has been an influx of new players lately and a number of former players are also coming back.
---
Running
---
i literally just threw away every power armor set you would possibly need for leveling to 50 because i needed the storage and no one i approached wanted to use it.
---
Ok I’ll add you
---
Happy Cake Day!

Do you need animal freind AND wasteland whisperer BOTH equipped or just one?

Hey this ain’t real life 😂

Ok

There is a computer terminal in there that will allow you to bypass that step.
---
Fo76zillow would be cool. Could list your house and show rooms like a real estate listing.
---
What's your IGN?
---
I had both, I tried it with only wasteland whisper on a 3 CHR character and no go :(
---
Most of this stuff is highly overrated.
---
I sell trash legenderies for whatever pops up price wise on my vendor. when its time to get my daily caps whats left over i convert to scrip. theres only one upgrade possible for my weapon so i doubt i will ever get it in the legendary exchange.
---
That's bs
---
Whatever I'm not going to use within 4 days I don't carry it not even in my stash.
---
That’s a good rule of thumb I guess
---
fells like 2 in 5 lowbies ive met lately have actually been new. just a rough guess though.
---
T-45d Power Armor starts at level 25.
---
Also stay tuned about the warning of the nuke and then just jump world's and your camp will follow you.
---
You on xbox?
---
Can I craft a full set? What about a good place to find fusion cores?
---
Wrong. It has something to do with T-51b power armor
---
Yep - you can bypass that part. It's super tedious.
---
This literally sickens me when I bought it at launch because \*fallout\* Well actually I got 2 copies so my waifu could play with me. Nice to know those early online fallout memories have a net worth of about 90 dollars :S

So you got that cursed legendary that you can't be ridden of? Solve the Quest asap is what you do.

lvl 147 im down to play GT is the same as here, im in GE so time difference will be a pain but im usually on for a few hours a day.
---
Good for you!!
---
I found a holotape talking about that
---
Yeah OGRedd, the best tame was a snallygaster but it died when they changed it with the patch. I think they are going to be revealed as transformed Humans or something so they removed it.
---
Big if true
---
How can they break stuff now?
---
If you use excavator arms you get triple the pre from vein, plus ash heap they are speckled all over
---
Can you come show me the spot?
---
The Skull mask (from the atomic shop) needs a fixing please. it was false advertising since the picture showed only a male character w/o beard.  I bought it thinking it would look neat for a bearded raider barbarian but was greatly dissapointed to find out that the mask removes my shiny magnificent beard. now it lays there in my inventory because i don't like the sight of it. And i'm missing 300 Atoms... please repair this
---
Found him. Could you come share animal freind with me?
---
Cores are 0.3 each. So they add up eventually.
---
Explosive weapons die in 0.2 seconds, even with fireproof and dense mods.
---
PERK and mod are quite meaningless, but reddit has people who lie. These people are lying to avoid weakening explosive weapons.
---
I'll be on later around 7am pst. Basically follow the road leading south of harpers ferry, you will pass a red rocket truck stop and then when you get to the galleria server hop if you havent found one along the road.
---
Player apartments or hotel suites? That's where they would be placed if there were to be any.
---
what you are suggesting is counter productive to the game and players, and it wouldnt fix anything. the duper are the problem from the get go.
---
also from your post it just sounds like you are salty that you cant buy what you want. play the game and you will find it sooner or later. yet another me me me me post.
---
Murmghs way to say **"NO REFUND!!"**
---
Is it supposed to be albino with a nest next to it?
---
Not near my xbox right now, make sure you have enough camp budget also. Takes about the same as the old turret allocation
---
Thanks
---
Pitty, but thanks looking into it. Appreciate it!
---
Jesus that sucks. I had 300 scrip, got the same pistol twice in a row out of the 3 3* weapons i dropped. Like, what is the probability of that?
---
Here is a [list](https://imgur.com/a/AR6e7Py) of the 10 most popular items so far, shared by Bethesda

Bethesda lore. Thats why....
---
No idea but you bring up a good point.
---
I've noticed in the ski slopes/resorts, the Scorched Wear like winter beanies and that's pretty much it. And the Scorched around Fort Defiance wear like nurse clothing and stuff, but really nothing else.
---
Probably got hotfixed, I haven’t played for a week or two. There was a base I went through, back when I posted this, that had a good 40 purifiers place don campfires indoors.
---
You felt guilty at first? So you're saying you're an arsehole with a heart of gold?

If you're going to be an arsehole, be an arsehole. Own it. Don't come crying here for sympathy when you're the instigator.

Odd. Definitely works and they’re quite powerful with the right perks.

Back when slap damage was a thing they had a reason at least, and I would pretend to be afk until I had 5% health then heal. Almost every time they started using their mic but I had voice chat muted, I wonder what they were saying lol.
---
You really need that many stims? 
---
I'm a bloodied build, and still never use stimpacs.
---
AM a lonely PC player as well. Add me, my ign is nuclearsalad
---
Beth has a weird way of thinking that 
---
High level = less clothes
---
All low level ghouls etc wear armor but max level ones are always naked.
---
Just weird that they like to have 0 variation when it comes to high level enemies
---
That's the point. What I do, lately, is making sure all plans are in one machine, weapons and outfits in another and so on. This at least reduces the effort required to understand what was sold, so that I can put another one for sale.
---
Tbh they should implement a follower/buddy system by letting us get a dog/robot companion, and at the same time, redo the taming process to allow for it to become a companion, too. 
---
Then they can sell skins for our companions and give us something we actually want in the store.
---
pvp in this game is too broken and stupid for me to do. I have done a lot of pvp in a lot of games since 1996 including UO, WoW, GW, GW2 and probably a few more I cant think of off the top of my head. this is the first game where the pvp was just so stupid I just quit it altogether.  I'm bumping on 1k hours and I could go commando rifle build and take advantage of rifle and commano perks affecting aut rifles, and oneburst people from stealth too. or I could get meathook counting as glad and melee plus bloody chameleon and all that garbage and gank people. but I dont, because it's stupid broken and garbage, one sided pvp. you morons with the stupid mascot heads and the wanna be scary clown outfits just look like intellectually challenged and feebleminded fortnight players who wandered into the wrong game. and if your trying to mine salt you're failing at that. you don't enrage me, you don't cost me many caps because I'm not dumb enough to keep going back. and lastly I server hop away knowing you just gained less than I do killing a super mutant. pvp in 76 is just broken and dumb, those of you who get off on it are just as stupid and broken. you are the lowest IQ  congrats you win at something.
---
If they put follower tames in and sold skins for them they would make so much money that all of their passed fuckup wouldn't even matter
---
What's to stop players purchasing multiple accounts?

i think battle royal is dying out so if bethesda has any common knowledge the  they would just give us a good story dlc but they wont...

You've got 3 minutes before a touchdown. That's more than enough time to leave the world or hastily move your camp unit.

"Oi crikey!  This deathclaw appears angry!  Let's go tickle his balls!"

They could just be thinking the same way as Korean MMOs do there female armor. "Less is more"

Wait what? Purveyor is recycling?
---
I've been running golf clothes with patrolman glasses and trilby hat to look like a golfer asshole, but couldn't find a decent golf club 🤨
---
I'm mentioned since the beta to have sitting, sleeping etc. to be a hold key action. Would fix the problem &amp; probability not that hard to implement. We already have to hold to go into building mode &amp; trading. Similar code.
---
Prime makes a fairly significant difference on the Gauss. For other non-auto weapons it's the same as a hardened receiver or the equivalent for that weapon. Many of the automatic prime receivers however do more damage than their non-prime counterparts, however the gain is not significant. 
---
There is one other big benefit to UC ammo: production. 308 produces roughly 4x the base amount per batch.  With enough fluorescent, feeding an LMG becomes trivial, and the receiver provides a healthy boost in damage.
---
And everything that’s coming down the pipe gets pushed back. It’s not like the boarded-up houses have a “mAek opEn” tickbox; that stuff takes time.
---
im usually searching for rare plans. but have most already. still looking for that rare trader with calibrated ultracite plans on pc.
---
700lbs+
---
experiment with it, try something new. dont expect people to design your camp for you
---
man is that really how you get the back pack skin?
---
i have farming the event just for that with no luck as of yet, I will try this as soon as I get home.
---
I have been but I can't get it to look normal or I can't get the walls to work because they're "floating" even though they are attached to the floor
---
I wish I had that kind of confidence.
---
5 caps for a score is kinda high. I’m always low but I doubt I’d pay that.
---
Assualtron heads can also revert to 1*. It’s all bugged.
---
Their isn't a third yet, but the next clue is near vault 76 on the vault 51 overseers body
---
I've gotten in the habit of checking to see whether the owner is around &amp; if so, making the help hands emote. Some people don't seem to realize that this is happening and most have come over and temporarily moved whatever was blocking me. 
---
If someone visits my camp quickly and leaves again, I may not even notice they were there cuz I'm not checking the map constantly.
---
I think he meant the rolls on the combat were bad haha
---
Every time someone says “Hear me out...” i get the impression that person knows they are about to say something stupid, and thats 1 minute of my life ill never get back. 
---
You owe me one minute.
---
I keep around 20-40 of the less than useful junk in stash cause it's mostly useless cept on rare occasions .. bal.fiber, alum, wood and springs leather etc usually a few hundred and like 2k of plastic, acid, lead and steal cause reasons ..
---
I usually sell bulk plastic, fiber, screws, acid and lead @ 50 caps per .. it's pricey but I put as much bulk as I can so it's been selling usually in big chunks too
---
I buy common bulk for about 1c per unit it contains and screws usually around 3 per screw.
---
I base it off how many base materials it might yield like a military circuit board produces 2 circuitry so I make it 2 caps. Whereas a desk fan produces 1 gear, 1 screw and 2 steel so it would cost 4 caps.
---
No. I don't want no scrubs. A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me.
---
I've got all the Junk in the Trunk!
---
too much,  like 780.   i need to cut down but idk pricing either
---
Do we have spawn point mats now?
---
If you ever server hop a location that’s next to a random event spawn, you’ll start to see a ton of them.
---
I been looking for reduced weight Teslas, LMGs, Railway Rifles, Harpoons, and Weightless Trapper/Robot Armor (Rad Resist/AGI + Detect)... but as for things I do find and buy often; Cork, Aluminum, Fiberglass, Adhesive, Rubber, Screws, Black Titanium, and Bones.
---
Dang... must be hard not being able to love yourself either.
---
What if men's and women's reproductive system mutated to... nothing? And that's why they all look same without any differences
---
Cool I sent you a friend request there anyways :)
---
Omg I took this same picture! Is it near that dried up river in an old ruined mansion thing?
---
There’s a perk for it in Charisma I believe , just aim at creature n it gives chance to pacify
---
nice chairs
---
Whats considered common junk?
---
BoS, im a veteran do I need to say more LOL
---
cool then I will be seen you later then lol
---
There are hundreds of random encounters throughout the map. Each can be one of the 4 types. You need to find a 'scene' type. 
---
This types involves things like dead NPCs, mannequin, tamables, etc. Once you get the spot, you have to wait for it to cycle for a tamable creature to appear. This could take hundreds of server hops. The creature has to spawn ALONE. Certain creatures spawn on certain zones. 
---
There are two perks that you can use which must be rank 3: animal friend or wasteland whisperer. Animals and their radiated versions take animal friend. Ghouls, bugs, etc. take wasteland whisperer. 
---
There's someone mapping encounter spots a few days ago, you can look it up.
---
You can no longer tame deathclaws
---
Steel, wood, plastic etc (at least in my opinion)
---
Circuits, gears, screws etc I consider uncommon
---
No spawn point mats that function, but as a visitor you spawn in where the camp is initially placed. So I moved mine. Found a new location, figured out where I wanted my shop entrance, stepped back a bit and placed my camp, placed a foundation in front of it, then a doorway, and built around that.
---
Thank you for all the help!
---
I heard Charisma 5 is minimum for Taming.
---
There is an issue I believe where if you change worlds because your camp wouldn't spawn the pet seems to die. I've lost a lot due to that :(
---
Tell me about your radiation emitter. I need one of those...
---
OMG that is one of my very first photos I took with photo mode.
---
My access to those is not stable. I hunted a few from different sources, but I guess I'm two handshakes from the real source, not one. Since I have no reliable access, chances for me selling mine are zero.
---
Thanks, Chief.
---
I found the link I saw yesterday explaining this, i hope it helps

---
I've been wondering if the Deathclaws are still tameable following the recent patch. What level was he? I might just be trying to get them too high level
---
That's not true
---
Its not. I tamed a yea guitar with 3
---
Not really but the game certainly takes longer to load than it used to sometimes when entering/exiting buildings and degrades in performance over extended periods as if it's memory leaking.
---
Man thanks for the detailed explanation musch appreciated 🤙is there a choice once you pacify it,to send it home ?
---
Personally, I only buy shotgun shells at 1 cap, guns that are better than the guns I use, and occasionally plans if I ever see something I don’t already have. I also buy any antiseptic priced well, because I’m always running out. Most other things/resources I can get myself just by playing. 
---
I sell tons of serums at 400 caps. I stock a variety of consumables priced super low (5-20 caps, at most), and those sell alright. Explosive weapons or 3* weight reduction armor priced for a few thousand usually sell eventually. Rare plans like weapon plans or anything from events usually sell even with a slight mark up. Basic plans and 90% of recipes (and most things, really) simply don’t sell unless you price them super low.  
---
All in all, the trick is to put your camp somewhere a lot of people are going to go (Arktos Pharma is a good spot right now), sell things that people actually want, and most importantly you need to price them well for the people who would actually want to buy them.
---
I wish. They're my favorite grenades. Good visual and sound effects, instant explosion, wide AoE, almost choke myself to death with them often, they're perfect.
---
Ah yes, the classic upgrade from tutorial skirt to endgame thong
---
i used to walk around with like 700 weight on me at all time (which is after weight reduction cards for aid, food, ammo, and my heavy weapons) and i managed to get low enough to fast-travel regularly before wild appalachia started..... fast-traveling is such a time-saver, i dont regret trading that for relatively low supplies of stuff
---
useful practices to manage weight:
---
*scrap every weapon and armor piece you dont use, legendaries included (unless they have effects that make them valuable enough to vendor)
---
*focus on one weapon type and max the relevant weight reduction perk. if you want to use other weapon types then try finding one that has a weight reduction legendary effect
---
*sell the aid items you dont see yourself using even occasionally
---
*dont keep too much junk. i personally only stash around 50 of each junk type, everything extra gets bulked of sold. adhesive, acid, lead, steel, and wood are exceptions, but i try to either sell them to players or use them to craft ammo when they get higher than 200. other exceptions may apply (e.g plastic) and some of mine may not, depending on what you use regularly
---
*memorize workbench locations in areas you go to often (indoors included), so you could scrap stuff wherever you need. many map markers tend to have them as well, so always good to check them for one if you need
---
*there is absolutely such a thing as too many stimpaks/radaways/radX. if you can keep yourself at below 100/200 that's ideal, use the pharma farma perk if you chug these regularly
---
*last point also applies to food, water and cures. keeping 50 of each sounds like a safe amount
---
*if you have a weight reduction perk for something then dont keep that item in your stash (where the effect doesnt apply). junk excluded for obvious reasons
---
i have SO MUCH  are you on pc ?  lol
---
It's the same with super mutants and robots. Scorchbeasts too, come to think of it. Only the melee enemies really look any different from each other
---
According to some post I read, 3 ranks in Animal and minimum of 5 Charisma needed.
---
That’s more to do with the quality of the TV than an issue with the game...
---
Thats the problem with oled or amoled. I got reddit and youtube burnt into my phone screen.
---
What your LG OLED ? I playing on  OLED LG55C6P. It  is no problem yet.
---
I got 76 two days ago. Let's get a noob squad going bois
---
3. Roll me a weightless Tesla.
---
Hahaha, I just tried using leave server and it's still putting me in the same server. The same server I was on yesterday! There's a guy called CarnageRiot or something who has his camp next to where I was constantly logging out yesterday, and that same player is still there with second place on the leaderboard
---
Pacify becomes tame instead.
---
Scorched variety could use a boost.  Particularly the visual dissonance between what they have in their hands, and what they're actually using in their inventory.  
---
But yeah, I'd like to see more elite variants of Scorched.  Perhaps for Responders, a chance to see them in Firebreather gear.  Better weapons for those than their more common variants.
---
For raiders and Brotherhood, a chance for power armor-equipped scorched. This always bothered me that it wasn't already a thing, since the Brotherhood spent so much time fighting the Scorched, but there don't appear to be any victims of the plague on their side.  I'd love to see 'fallen' scorched knights, or paladins equipped with plasma, laser, or Gatling weaponry.  
---
Scorched raiders on the other hand could be far more equipped than their Responder, or civilian scorched counterparts.  Maybe some auto grenade launchers, or .50 MG equipped ones.
---
I would like a battle royale.
---
On the provision we get mind control devices that let us take over a scorchbeast to do so and can fly around infecting things to raise up small armies of scortched to fight opponents.
---
Those are the corpses of the people who played the beta but never bought the game.
---
It takes awhile to get the keys, but then the paint job is there every day. Those plans are next to worthless, because all you need is someone nice enough to open the door for you. People who don’t realize that, or who are very lazy, might buy them for a decent amount of caps, but most people won’t. Compare that to a rare event plan, which require a fair bit of effort and luck. I sell those for 200 at most. 
---
More importantly, the people who have 2k caps to spare as well as a sweet suit of power armor to buy luxury paint for, they can probably just get the keys themselves. It might take awhile, but then they have infinite paint jobs as well as everything else in there. 
---
You can’t just think about how much work it took. You also have to consider who is buying it. Most people struggle to get caps until they hit end game, and then everything flips and they start to make a ton of caps... but the list of things they need is much shorter.
---
I don't think the animation and style of the scorched is very good. It's almost as though they were designed by someone else not connected to the game studio. They look and feel odd compared to other npc in the game.
---
Yes  please  is not fun going to sleep into a sleeping bag  at the golf clubhouse when 30 ghouls are trying to kill you.
---
it effects the rewards while you are on a team atleast the description from the pipboy says that
---
I suggest going buck naked and carrying as much mole rat meat as you can. Just kidding. I got my hands on some PA as soon as I could. Unless your really into leather.
---
I lock the door to my fusion generator as well.  It's off the garage workshop area so if I turn off the direct power to the garage door when I leave it will also be behind that.  I have pressure plates to let people in the garage.  However, people play with switches, so I keep the generator door locked just in case.
---
I never thought of putting in a switch to control power to the Vending machines and the Open sign when close to the cap limit.  However, I'm at max budget, so I can't do it anyway.
---
I see your drunk Ghoul and raise you a hungover Wendigo.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/ST5C3A7](https://imgur.com/a/ST5C3A7)
---
But a locked door... a secret room. It’s clearly where you keep your porn stash! And as a “lone wanderer” you get lonely sometimes...
---
Pretty sure this is on top of the that rail-yard north of white springs
---
That’s some quality punning.
---
I like how few fucks Path of Exile gives about character names. They have to be really extreme to offend anyone in that game
---
I've run into a lot of players that are running with new characters. Most of them ignore me. I'm lvl 93. I try to help actual newcomers though.
---
I also think that there will be people who leveling alternative characters to nv50 to obtain always legendary maximum level when giving scrip.
---
Thank you.
---
I wasnt clear. You can no longer use 'animal friend' to tame deathclaws.
---
See patch note v9
---
50 of each except for:
---
Steel:  150, Gears: 100, Screws: 100, Springs: 100, Wood: 150, Molded Plastic: 100, Excess Adhesive: 100, Aluminum: 75, Antiseptic: 100 (for making Stimpaks)
---
The amounts will go up and down depending on use, etc. but that's my general rule of thumb.  
---
Also, I use T-60 Power Armor.  If I was using Ultracite or X-01 then I might stock more of the materials needed to repair them.
---
I turn extra lead and steel into ammo as soon as I get it.  Ammo weighs a ton less.
---
AA All day.
---
That's not a problem with the game, it's a problem with your TV. Same thing could happen with just a screen saver if you left it there too long.
---
Well, you cant use wasteland whisperer. I have all 3 points and farmed a random event spot until I found a deathclaw... only let me pacify
---
I only kill them if the prices are low or fair. If the prices are high I sometimes stand back and watch as walls and turrets are destroyed
---
OLED55C7V...
---
Try a color test video on YouTube. (RGB, etc). You will see...
---
Yes, I never meant to say it was the game's fault. Just a friendly heads-up.
---
Lol at the 'missing the point' edit. Maybe don't talk like you speak for everyone if you're going to complain when people call you out for it.
---
I am all onboard for some low stakes battle royale.
---
Yes, they are. The only tameable ones I've ever seen are only level 21.
---
Absolutely agree.
---
I know the C.A.M.P. system means we can build *anywhere* in theory but so often you come across such awesome little spots to build, but then on closer examination it turns out that they're just so full of objects you can't clip structures into that it's not worth the time.
---
Actually, y'know what would be awesome? If there were abandoned Raider camps, tiny villages, industrial buildings etc. that threw out the rules on how close camps can be and allowed a group of people to build a mini settlement in them.
---
If something always spawns it's an enemy and not a tameable creature. They only happen at the random event spawns.
---
I think it was probably bugged early on.
---
I got the plans to make the Ultracite PA parts and I got the armor itself. That was late november last year. I know others didn't get the plans though. I don't know if I did anything different. I played entirely solo back then.
---
From the queen I thought everyone got Ultracite explosive vent. I had over 30 of these before I dumped them a few months ago.
---
It's under that bridge. The albino with a nest is another random event spawn point very close by.
---
I tried that for a while. Most people refused to trade with me that way.
---
Just checked patchnotes v9. It says nothing about tanning however it does say that deathclaws among other things are no longer considered animals. Strange that wasteland whisperer wont let me tame one but another guy here said umhe equipped both and it worked.
---
This happened to me yesterday. Forgot my power armor and stims, ended up running to the nearest camp with two scorchbeasts following. They wiped just about everything in the camp and killed me midair as i made a run for it
---
Unique items (event drops) or Legendaries
---
I'm fine with people challenging for workshops.  
---
The only time that I felt bummed is when I was using the Race Track to test out some new build techniques and I was just about to blueprint my build when it happened.  My workshop space is maxed out at my base and the Race Track workshop has plenty of flat ground to play with, once you remove the cars, etc.
---
He took the workshop and killed me.  But I explained the situation and he was kind enough to let me take it back and even dropped wood and concrete from my junk drop so that I could continue my build.
---
My camp has 3 mongrels spawning about every time someone fast travels to it. I don't really mind them taking out a wall or crop and my visitors are safe at the vending machines on the second floor
---
I spawned into a camp the other day on PC and there were already about 6 max level super mutants running around 3 of them with miniguns. It was already too late when I got there. I did kill them, but there wasn't much left of the camp lol.
---
Actually, I found that part easy.  But then, I've done tons of Power Plant repairs, so it's now second nature to me...
---
"Note to the Gourmands: human flesh is not acceptable tender here."
---
The first day of the Purveyor, I spent 1000 scrips for:
---
- AAE Western Revolver
---
- BE Handmade
---
- TS Shotty
---
I was so exited because I thought I always will get  such good weapons but wrong.. TS Flamers, AA kryolator, the weirdest pipe pistols, harpoon guns. But not once a decent weapon.
---
Btw Base Luck at 15.
---
Only been waiting over a decade for it to be a hold function lol
---
I'm on PC, maxed out settings. Try it in/near Whitespring and the station and power station there, it's terrible. Looks ok some places and places they expect you to view  long distances,
---
Basically nothing. As long as it earns Bethesda money. But it is funny how many take caps so seriously and hoarding them with multiple mules. I mean, it's not like you could buy a mansion with all those caps.
---
This dude immediately just started calling me f bombs.
---
I just started a few days ago and am loving it! I was going to play at launch but got scared off by all of the negativity, even though I’m a huge Fallout fan. I’m guessing that when people start seeing more positive stuff about the game they’ll give it a try. Probably lots on the fence like I was.
---
Let me start by being honest and saying I haven’t dived into FO76 yet. I’ve been distracted by other games. 
---
But in FO4, you could combine different colours to create other colours that weren’t available by default. For example, putting a yellow letter directly on top of the same letter in red would yield an orange letter.
---
I know, never said it was. Although disable HUD option would be nice.
---
You don't need both, only Animal Friend.
---
I mean, IDC. I won't play it, but what's wrong letting those who do? If they shoehorn the game towards that type of play and stop supporting adventure well, then I just won't ever play again is all it boils down too. 
---
Armor, Weapons, and the perk system are too much of a shit show in this game for something like that to work. Unless they plan on changing how it all works.
---
Yes, you can. You can still tame sloths too. There is a difference between taming and pacifying.
---
The "pixel refresher" option in the menu of the TV kinda fixed it a little. But it's still visible on a red screen.
---
Heck when I used to take workshops late at night (about 2 am - 4 am) that’s when the people who want to pvp come out. (The ones that kill you and never take the workshop. Just want to take your junk and get you pissed)
---
Odd because I ran it a few times this weekend and it reaped the rewards. It continues to pay out since then too.
---
Fo76 literally only has the bluish tint on the neon letters. And there are no other letters to this scale that are stackable. There are a different type of letter lights you can get in the atom shop but they honestly just look awful.
---
While I don't have the plans myself, if I remember correctly the letters are only blue so there's nothing you can really do to add colour variety to them right now.
---
Ppl carry tons of junk...then come here to cry and rage when they die and someones takes their bag
---
Oh yeah I was primarily there for scrip but if something exceptional drops that is an improvement on what I have or to give to lower levelled friends then it's cool.
---
Monster levels are surprisingly deceiving. I just started late last week and used to run away from things that looked higher level than me, but realized that there are a lot of higher level things I actually can kill. There are some times when I can kill level 50+ on my level 20, and other times when I’ll waste tons of ammo and stimpacks on stuff my level (and sometimes below). At this point, unless it’s something massive, I’ll try my luck and if I die I know to watch out for that particular thing next time.

I sell one-shot explosives for about 500 caps each + cost of any mods + a small markup.  They usually end up in the 400 to 750 cap range.  I just don't see the need to sell them any higher.  I make enough caps between the daily vendor limit limit and Vending Machine sales of serums, etc. that I can buy a new Serum recipe every 5 days.
---
I haven't gotten any new Two-Shot explosives to drop in a while.  The one that I have, a hunting rifle, I got a while back as a drop and it's one of my daily use weapons when I feel like playing as a sniper.
---
20
---
Surprised you just now saw it. I have spawned in like 10x with that damn thing running by me or right up to me while I spawn in.
---
I have only been able to get the sloth and deathclaw at cranberry glade.
---
Your title begs to differ. “Fallout 76 causes...”
---
i got a unyielding sentinel scout armor.LL.once
---
I’m still trying to complete the tadpole quests can you help gt LTxWALRUSxX
---
Yeah man! I’ll be on roughly 4-5 PM EST, if you’ll be on then?
---
I'll never understand how a legendary stingwing can carry a 3\* legendary wood chest piece..   but hey, guess that's how they became legendary....
---
When you tame creatures, will they go in your house or just wander around outside? I haven’t learned much about the taming system yet!
---
For me is the Vampire+explosive combo \*\*. It's amazing. You dealt damage and heal your self at the same time. I dont know how i lived before without it lol
---
Now i am searching for a \*\*\* Vampire+explosive+ sometning else.
---
What da... Are you saying the game just decided to remove it from your inventory for no reason? I know this was ages ago, but I'm bored, so I might as well just respond to 2 month old posts
---
Give them a pack that you can store extra stuff on them and I'd pay money for it.
---
nope just animal friend.
---
Ah, ok. That seems strange to me. Since 76 seems to be using the same engine and a lot of the same resources as 4, you’d think it would be a pretty simple addition.
---
Yeah. My friends bought serums and I bought PA plans so we all could do free upgrades/serums for the team. Boy, did I get screwed over by Bethesda!
---
yeah, they are very clunky and awkward compared to lets say raiders from fo4.
---
It just feels like they are a generic Fo76_BadGuy_Template
---
i just tamed one today before work, level 20 hes at my camp I call him clyde as suggested by a redditor.
---
I've stopped to use the mirv mod and back to normal because with my 2 shot ,i've always finish dead like the enemy in the explosion😂😂😂
---
fluxes are needed only to make Prime receiver and then to craft ultracite ammo. You don't need them to repair weapons.
---
Large if actual
---
They will probably release them slowly through cash shop
---
Check Camden Park. Aside from scorched there'll always be either bloatflies, ghouls, bloodbugs or ticks spawn at a couple of places. Just server hop until you get one you need.
---
Also go inside the building  for an extra legendary.
---
But if they're added in future dlc they will be filled up
---
no - I only needed rank 3 animal friend to get my deatchclaw server hop at cranberry  glade only had to do it a few times for my sloth and a couple times when he died and got my deathclaw.
---
You're getting a donut, she's getting a donut and he's getting a donut. Donuts for everyone!
---
What about when I buy ammo for 0.5 caps per one? 
---
We need to set some as 1 caps and some at 0 caps, would that still work?
---
If anything I feel like it went up. I got one recently as a drop with full durability and I've gone thru like 5 cores and the durability is just now hitting red.
---
Yes. It just disappeared between logins. Got a better harpoon gun since then, but it was still a morale blow...
---
Top of the World area for Frag Grenades.  Check the raider bodies in all of the raider camps.  Also, the floor where Rose hangs out has a bunch, but I rarely go up there anymore.  Just be aware that it's a medium to high level area that can spawn high level Mutants if a high level player is in the area.
---
Why not? As long as both of you mark the trade as finished.
---
GT: krisabsinthe 
---
If you see me on I’ll run around with you :) probably have some stuff you can have
---
Thanks bro
---
Cheers mate I'll try it
---
Ok Bro
---
Thanks so much🤙
---
Have an upvote. Thats delightful

---
Carrying too much when you go out.
---
Only carry about 5-10 food/water.  Soup is great because does both.
---
Only carry about 5 stims (not super stims).
---
Make sure you store gunpowder that might be in your MISC tab.   Ores take less room to store than the equivalent Lead/Iron in your stash.
---
Trim down your carrying of bullets.
---
Make sure you are not carrying multiple sets of armors.  
---
Take excavator PA when doing junk runs for extra +100 lbs.
---
I have 2 strength and still have room for about 40-50 lbs.   I do not equip any weight reduction perks except for 1 (Bandollier).
---
I only carry 1 rifle around usually though (handmade), plus Black Diamond?  The legendary ski sword.     It has +1 str and only 3 lbs I think, so its basically free to carry.
---
A mail system is one thing, i would love a "guest book" to leave a note or perhaps even an item as gift
---
Thanks for the ideas for far. What about the mutations vs no mutations choice? is going mutations always superior?
---
Honestly I’d be fine with them being in the atom shop. I’d just like some new colours, ideally red.
---
I try to collect rare planes, weapons that serve me (I'm heavy and I still do not have such decent weapons) and also weapons with weight reduction to collect :). Personally I visit camp with many weapons because the other numbers become very deceptive due to the light weight of clothes and plans.
---
I also love the imagination and dedication of some when role-playing and how they have created their camps discovering in the process small areas unknown to me.
---
They are supposed to be intelligent, but all they can do is carry miniguns and flamers and look ridiculus doing it
---
 Thanks for the ideas for far. What about the mutations vs no mutations choice? is going mutations always superior?
---
Feel free to add me. IGN Asully102
---
Level 72(ish, I forget). Don't mind helping lower level players grow up.
---
Literally all I want is for tamed animals to be unkillable. No more losing pets to mole miners with missile launchers, no more losing pets to griefers, no more losing pets to them being telefragged by my house, no more losing pets to them just randomly forgetting to spawn in. Please. ;\_;
---
I tend to end up at max budget then slowly get rid of luxury aesthetics, but have started by building all the infrastructure now.
---
No level, how long you have been playing or even what you want to do in game. 
---
I guess I put more effort into this comment than you did for the post.
---
I guess adding some more info would be nice.
---
Luck? You sure?
---
I have a BE laser and an AAE laser, and both are way worse than handmades or 10mm subs.
---
I even managed to take a few good photos of it as it sheeped around &amp; screamed at me.
---
That last bit reminded me of a quest I was on, I had to open a locked door to get a note that was behind it.....then out of fucking nowhere, another player comes and blows himself up with the explosive containers in the room. I took his loot and went on my merry way.
---
The game has gotten a lot better since launch too.
---
charisma
---
How long dis you need to.play before it happened? I've g okt the same one in my lougeroom that I play on every second or so day and it's not used for anything else.
---
how about some cool skins for weapons that we actually use (handmade, AKA AK47).
---
The one like directly north of that one box?
---
I would love to hear something concrete about private servers.
---
- How is this going to work in terms of payment for hosting and licensing (I sincerely doubt they are going to release the server code and let us host our own servers great as that would be).
---
- When at the developing tools (CK) going to be available.
---
- When are the admin tools going to be available (so we can determine how much flexibility we have).
---
- When they are expecting this feature to go live.
---
We'll see... They have been totally non-committal so far an this interests me and my friends (who quit until this feature is out) much more than a Vault-Tec flavoured Battle Royale.
---
And yes, you are correct, the longer they take to release concrete information the more likely talent is going to be tied up in FO4/Skyrim projects for the time this becomes 'a thing'.
---
found it in the mirror at big al's tatto parlor
---
I have three damn enemies that spawn occasionally so i stand guard with my drumhammer and scream "Go back to the shadows!"
---
Nope, it's instanced per player so it has nothing to do with someone else taking it.
---
I can help later on when I get back on I’m ML-_-Panda if u don’t get help b4 then
---
i took it before i could get a screenshot sry
---
Put your turret on a mat of some kind. Mine dont dissapear anymore.
---
HahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaHahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaHahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaHahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaHahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaHahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaHahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaHahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaHahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaHahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaHahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaHahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaHahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaHahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaHahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaHahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaHahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaHahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaHahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaHahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaHahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaHahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
---
I laughed just as you asked
---
Want to sell any of those? D:
---
[deleted]
---
Can you let me know when you will be back because we are ready at any time
---
**Go home Ghulbert you're drunk.**
---
thank you, I'll add you when I'm next on :)
---
It honestly has I had to shift my mindset to not expect to be on par with fallout 3,NV,4 because it’s a totally different game and it’s more survival type and it’s really fun.
---
Ok sounds good my PSN name is mjhaga
---
Become a consumable item (meals/liquor) trader and send free samples to other players mailboxes.
---
No doubt. Wendy looks a bit done.
---
Yeah whenever I fast travel to someones CAMP it begins a game of hopping and jumping away so I don't get stuck. Fast travel mats would be perfect - just make it so they can only be placed on dirt to avoid any dodgy spawning from it.
---
Hypocrisy at its finest. BE Handmade is just as overpowered. Git gud stated.
---
yep im in ps4 and its the first time happen alot to me the past 5h dont know why
---
yeah but what do you do with those caps ? ._. I have nothing to buy aside from plans for weapons I won't use since they aren't legendaries....
---
Thank you mucho, great info
---
Still better than my first ever shack...
---
I got kicked 2 times now in one and a half hour. Ps4 too. I sadly don't know what's going on
---
I actually have 2 strength and loose pounds when equiping my Excavator PA (without calibrated Mods).
---
The gatling plasma and flamers and cryolators are the same, yet you left those out and just said laser rifle.
---
Same here! Been having a hard time staying in a sever! Plus the atom shop is down and now I just lost all my atom points somehow....
---
I have three CAMPs for three different characters and all three have switches for turning off vendors available for visitors. Only once have someone turned off my vending machines. The several other times they've been turned off, It's been some creatures that have spawned in my locked generator room and eaten my generator.
---
I'm impressed at that as I don't really sell anything good. Mostly RPG stuff, like my bar selling all kinds of beer and liquer and my motel selling some practical stuff like toothbrushes, toilet paper and soap. Yes I add some ammunition and plans to not make it totally worthless, but not that much.
---
Ps4 and yeah not a fan of this personally
---
AAE would really be better than FE?
---
Are those near Watoga? Ive been looking around the various spawn points and wondering if theres a best place to try and find a certain kind of pet
---
Even though the wall "metal" textures look like wood textures
---
Jesus, I would love to go down the automatic path but the thing is I’m just worried about ammo consumption, must burn through it real fast.
---
Laser weapons are trash all game, and they finally buff the durability, now everyone wants a nerf, get the fuck outta here with that BS. We should have learned our lesson by now.
---
Yes PS4 2 times in 15 mins
---
TSE still needs to be nerfed.   All that needs to be done is adjust how the bonuses are applied.
---
Just make the Two Shot part of it do Base Damage X Bonus.  Then base damage X explosive.   Add both of those to the base damage and walla all good.
---
I will not be debating this with people who, given exact description of how to make a gun OP, ignore this description and believe some irrelevant bullshit. BE handmade doesn't ignore armor, staggers sometime and needs aiming. The E laser doesn't care about armor, staggers constantly and doesn't require aiming. You are so much inferior PvPer than me that you lack cognitive potential to understand the gap. You are also arrogant. I hate ignorant and arrogant people, and you are a noob.
---
I will only continue interaction with you to schedule a duel, if you are PC and are ready to be torn to pieces. Otherwise, get lost.
---
Also, Bfirerate handmade is vastly superior than BE handmade and you are three months behind the meta.
---
Don't like what the vendor has to sell?  Put on a chef hat and cook them a nice helping of soup. Serve it with some Purified Water, and pack some diluted radaway/stimpacks  in the bag for good measure. Leave the bag on their bed. Then, buy their cheapest item to prompt them to return home for a nap.
---
They did a LOT to improve where you can build in the vending patch. Still could be better, but it’s WAY easier now.
---
&gt;What other game has Bethesda ever released player numbers for
---
Every game prior to fo76. It is why they know the exact amounts of people who bought each game.
---
&gt;or one and it's not 'impossible' because the numbers he's talking about come from Microsoft's official website
---
ROFL, that site also says fo76 has less players than fallout 4, Sea of Thieves, Minecraft, etc. Also that is only for xbox, not all systems. Other sites like this one show they have under 400k players. Which is tiny for a triple A online title.
---
You don't want to sloooooooowly get down to take a nap or sit down at 20 health, while 10 ghuls beating you to hell, and you push all buttons like a mad man to stop the animation...?
---
I really can't imagine why.
---
To add to this, give tamed animals a named tradeable collar that you can sell to other players! Would love to be able to sell ownership of tamed animals in the camp vendors.
---
Additionally let us make saddles and ride our tamed Deathclaws and shit, how cool would that be?
---
Have you read the post, you dumb fuck? You didn't,  you are the fucker I mentioned in the last paragraph, two brain cells total. This post asks for a fix for legacy weapons, and a buff for all energy weapons. You are too stupid to understand that.
---
It wasn't registering my FDC armor, said I was 500 pounds over carry limit, yet was overencumbered  or suffering ap loss. Several camp item, such as the keypad switch, were placing a part one place and the keypad far away from where I chose. A concrete foundation was suddenly disconnected, duplicated, and set apart from my camp's foundation area. A super Mutant looked me dead in my face and shot my turret and seemed to wait for my response. The audacity.
---
He never owned up to filing false DMCA take downs against anyone who criticizes him.
---
I also tried to live on candy alone, but it was too hardcore for me, so I turned back to cannibalism.
---
I built myself a throne, with a clear view to a room with my vending machines... which also has radiation emitters, tesla traps and flamethrowers hidden behind the walls. And of course, the powered door and these traps are activated with switches I have hidden in my throne (I can use them while sitting).
---
I have done many terrible things out there... but I did not make myself this way. It was the Wasteland that ruined me.
---
None of them are as meta and as OP as ELaser. And they should also be made incidentary aswell. Cryo actually is a ridiculously good weapon, but its purpose is slightly different than OHKO.
---
but super mutants dont have anything, it be like sucking an elbow or something.
---
I’m not using it full auto though, just semi. It’s still a hungry gun, but you get the benefits of fast rate of fire without the damage drop off per shot of a auto.
---
Here, take mine too: [https://imgur.com/nkuXnrW](https://imgur.com/nkuXnrW)
---
platform?
---
Yeah it would be cool if we were able to make bulk ammo in hundreds for 4 plastic each. This is what I think each ammo type in bulk should cost (base cost) without hard bargain:
---
.38 round (bulked) - 6 caps
---
.308 round (bulked) - 7 caps
---
10mm round (bulked) - 6 caps
---
.50 round (bulked) - 10 caps
---
5mm round (bulked) - 3 caps
---
5.56 round (bulked) - 6 caps
---
Shotgun Shell (bulked) - 7 caps
---
.44 round (bulked) - 5 caps
---
.50 caliber ball (bulked) - 6 caps
---
.45 round (bulked) - 5 caps
---
Cannonball (not bulk, but single) - 9 caps
---
40mm Grenade round (not bulk, but single) - 9 caps
---
Missile (not bulk, but single) - 9 caps
---
Mini Nuke (not bulk, but single) - 14 caps
---
Harpoon (not bulked, but single) - 9 caps
---
Crossbow Bolt (bulked) - 6 caps
---
2MM Electromagnetic Cartridge (bulked) - 8 caps
---
Fusion Cell (bulked) - 6 caps
---
Railway spike (bulked) - 8 caps
---
Syringer Ammo (bulked) - 4 caps
---
Cro Cell (bulked) - 8 caps (this high cost because it uses crystal)
---
Flare (bulked) - 3 caps
---
Fuel (bulked) - 5 caps
---
Fusion Core (not bulk, but single) - 15 caps
---
Plasma core (not bulk, but single) - 14 caps
---
Gamma round (bulked) - 7 caps
---
Plasma Cartridge (bulked) - 6 caps
---
can you buy a loaf of bread with caps ? nope.
---
bite the bullet. just drop all your unwanted stuff. I try to find a spot that someone might find it, but got to the point,that its not worth the effort. I just get rid of it.
---
even dropped bunker buster, 43lb, stuff that,just dropped it.
---
it will all return soon enough.
---
Wouldn't this just diminish the value of rare legendaries as everyone will be spending scrip to get the same roles? Everyone would eventually just be running the same weapons - especially as scrip is incredibly easy to obtain so hardly becomes a grind.
---
I will probably wait until they reach insane prices again.
---
The cultists dagger is kind of similar
---
On xbox.
---
I would like to be able to build the Nukashine jukebox. I'd play that music in my bar. Now I have a jukebox for the looks that I turn off and turn on the Appalachia radio every time I get back to CAMP.
---
**Dear Mr Fozzel,

What does this even mean
---
Mine is an explosive legacy. I'm curious if that has anything to do with it? Do explosive wepons deteriorate faster?
---
"you are outside the storm, if you remain, you will die."
---
totally not royalmodenosiree
---
Keep in mind that on consoles this is not such a problem as on PCs because consoles doesn't render the distances where the Elasers range bug makes them OP.

I'm afraid the earliest we're going to hear about mod support / private servers / offline mode is after we've reached the end of the current roadmap. Up until then, Bethesda would have zero motivation to draw players away from their vanilla version of 76.
---
My guess is that after the current roadmap concludes, we're first going to see 76 hitting Steam (to re-ignite interest and gain additional sales). And that's when curated mods (via Creation Club) are going to be available. However, it might be a looong time until we'll be allowed to fully mod the game without restrictions - if at all. The idea of us modding the game and playing it our way fundamentally conflicts with Bethesda's intentions to create a heavily supported online-only games-as-a-service type of game.
---
But to be honest: as much as I'd love to mod the shit out of 76 - I'd rather wait for the next true offline Fallout game with better tech and a better story-driven singleplayer mode.
---
Equip your gun when youre stuck, that should fox it
---
^but ^people ^don't ^know ^that
---
&gt; but as for things I do find and buy often; Cork, Aluminum, Fiberglass, Adhesive, Rubber, Screws, Black Titanium, and Bones.
---
We must have similar crafting/repairing/modding practices lol. Always running low on those until I do a big top up run.
---
People know nothing, our verbally-self-insulting collegue proves that perfectly
---
There are more corpses like also at dolly sods, berkeley springs and pricketts fort
---
I felt like such a dumbass when I finally worked that out after tens of failed efforts to start trade.
---
It would make the very rare better legendaries loose value and perhaps even lower their price so much they could be bought by caps. It could make caps useful again...
---
We found that when it happens if the team members leaves world and comes back it is fixed.  We had another problem where one couldn’t fast travel to the other then left game and came back to find they couldn’t join. Showed team leader as offline. Weird ass bugs
---
I had 300 scrip saved up and cashed it in yesterday hoping for a decent 3* rifle. Nope - 3 crappy pistols- two pipe and a 10mm. Sold them off for 400-500 caps reasonably quickly at least. It seems like there's a pattern to the legendary vendor drops... One theory is your should wait until the legendary creatures are dropping favorable weapons, then visit Murfghtrraggh.
---
right of watoga. a miss nanny told me bedtime stories, on one encounter, on another a mr handy blew up, then a deathclaw vs 2 bears battle but I couldnt tame the deathclaw because I think he was part of the 2 bears spawn.
---
Looks like you have decades of fun and exciting research ahead of you! Good Luck!
---
Maybe start out by asking Grahm if he's a grower not a show-er?
---
a redditor advised me to give my deathclaw the name of clyde. it fits.
---
Gamertag?
---
Can buy them from other people. Some people sell them extremely cheap.
---
You know you can buy these things for like 400 caps each right?
---
I spent all my caps on all the other serums I needed
---
Uh there is more then 6 levels. Whitesprings has an underground complex that was supposed to house the government in the event of a nuclear strike. I haven't been able to find the big ass door but it is supposed to be in the ballroom.
---
Not quite like that when you're doing it all alone and you're level 11.
---
Wow. What are the odds of exactly the same thing happening to me too? Seems like the more popular the weapon type, the less likely it is to drop..... Mmmm. No stories of people getting two tse handmades in row...
---
When I noticed some supermutants say YAAAAR when they get hurt I started saying YAAAAR back. made my wife look over like wtf??
---
This is the correct answer
---
Unfortunately I'm not certain about that. I only just recently got my first explosive weapon and I haven't used it since it's a Black Powder Pistol.
---
Solution: Bethesda, change the rules so that if you participate in the event you get to loot the legendary regardless of who kills it.
---
For me it only seems to happen to the power armor condition indicator on the left (if you are in power armor all the time). You can check if you have burn in by playing a color test video on YouTube. If you have some retention try the pixel refresher.
---
/r/fo76bearhunt
---
I got a 3 star vampire crossbow ..gave it to the count...he can make better use of it
---
I got the healing factor Serum recipe from her before getting all prime receivers. Didnt even notice it until much later...
---
Oof, all the weird ass pipe revolvers she gives me got me wondering if she's making up for lost time :/
---
Tried today: zealots 90% reduced weight pipe revolver with some third vats perk. Useless
---
&gt;  but they all look identical with their torn tshirts and pants.
---
So, you haven't noticed that in various locations they wear location relevant clothes -- many of the scorched at the asylum are nurses for example.
---
What about Executioner?
---
No it beats the hell out of dropping it on the ground. I’ve freed up so much inventory and stash space just because of the scrip system.
---
But, it does cause burn-ins. I didn't say Fallout 76 is the only reason burn-ins happen and I didn't say Fallout 76 is to blame.
---
Hmmm why would it be unmarked🤔
---
For the time you wasted for tries to get mutations you want, you'll earn enough caps to buy serum...
---
mark error 404
---
I should be home from work in around 2 hours from now.
---
I ran into this yesterday. Opened the pip boy and that fixed it for me
---
Yeah with that line I don't get how people can deny it
---
If you're not finding caps useful, I would assume you have too many in which case you should be able to afford a rare legendary anyway.
---
I see. Kudos, nice work around.
---
Yet if I'm completely honest I do feel we have to find too many of these workarounds when in the build mode. And lately the whole build mode feels quite broken again with faulty error messages. 
---
Maybe they should allow colliding and overlapping more and make snapping optional.
---
And please Bethesda fix the veggie placement. My brain itches where I can't scratch everytime I see floating corn and razorgrain.
---
I just want them to fix the bugged affixes reverting from 3-1
---
You could’ve earned enough caps by now to get the rest of your Serums lol
---
Then what did you do when you got a mutation you didn’t want?? I thought rad-away removes them at random, or does it always remove the last mutation you received???
---
You need to pm me your IGN if on PC.
---
Those are vintage weapons 300 years old, it's a miracle they still works ;)
---
I think there are a whopping three location that makes some of the scorched wear different clothing.
---
That's whats bugging me, if they added nurses outfits to the scorched at asylum why aren't the scorched at military outposts wearing combat armor or scorched at BOS points wearing power armor.
---
They are the least threatening enemy in the game and just feel like added clutter to make the world seem more populated.
---
😅😂🤣
---
yes, near the tree.
---
I'm not gonna respond to a hypocritical cry baby who whines in a post, then tries to buy the gun from someone in the same post, minutes later. You're just butthurt you don't have a god tier one like I do.
---
I would assume so but I cannot confirm, has a google search pulled any results?
---
Can someone explain why it's better to fight the SBQ outside of the Nuke zone, me and my friend's set up both have Ghoulish and Radsponge so we find it easier to fight in the zone as we use less healing items
---
You don't know what the hell you're even talking about.
---
They circle your CAMP device. You can move it to wherever you want them to be. Kinda sucks since that also determines where you FT into your base.
---
Going to be testing for XB1 shortly, if I don’t update this comment I probably didn’t run into any issues.
---
Did you even read my response? No obviously not. So stop being a hypocrite. Jesus. I'm done with you.
---
Ive just been comparing the random encounter spots with the glade and think I have an idea where. Ill have a few server hops tonight for it :)
---
I'm always really excited when I find an animal thinking I can get it. Then the others spawn in when its a fight and I just go :(
---
Super Mutants and Mutant Hounds can be found in the Rusty Pick.  
---
Ticks and Bloatflies at and around Camden Park.  
---
Mole Miners and Moler Rats in the Welch.  
---
I found a Radstag in front of the Burning Mine.  
---
The Scorchbeast as well as the Scorched were near the Unfinished Mansion.Finally, the Mirelurks were at Lake Reynolds :)
---
Gues he found the responder vendor bot and wanted people give a chance to join him. Btw i found him yesterday and bought the hunters longcoat :)
---
just an old reddit thread that is completely off topic with only one response. Tried that.
---
To dial in the amount of Rads i want, i use a salvaged assaultron head.
---
Im a bloodied heavy gunner in pa, and I use emergency protocolls on my pa (torso mod), lone wanderer 3, nerd rage 3, radicool,tenderizer 2, stabilized 3, heavy gunner 1, expert hg 1 and Master hg 1 and serendipity 3 and also the adrenal reaction mutation.
---
Its also really nice to have a full Set of unyielding armor which boosts my special stats by 15 (except endurance) for crafting and stuff or getting pies.

My 1*bloodied .50cal does 220 dmg per shot, minigun does 140 and gatling does 390.
---
I could put in higher heavy gunner perk cards for even higher damage, but muh weight reduction perks.
---
I also swap out the heavy gunner perks for 1/2 handed melee perks and then my bloodied groknaks axe does 1k damage per Swing and my baseball bat does 850.
---
and now you can throw in chems like med-x, fury, overdrive, psycho and the likes.
---
Yea i only have 54 HP (&lt;20% max health), but i rarely die. 
---
Assaultrons and sentry bots from arktos pharma are a threat, aswell as yao bears in larger numbers sometimes or mass gutsys.
---
Other then that imposter sheepsquatch kills me quite often and the acid attack from mirelurk queens.
---
Also healing factor mutation works wonders.
---
Oh well makes sense now

In addition to that, give all sliders the ability to manually type the number. I mean seriously, scrolling to a specific number is hard, especially in vending.

Lol. “Here, human human human!  I’ve got a treat for you!” Got it stuck in my brain and said it over the course of a few hours... my spouse also wtf-d me.  Cheers

I am on PS4 and I have a maze/trap house
---
just pick up and scrap every one you can get. all mods will come up eventually.
---
scorched carry them a lot. I carry the combat shot with hardened reciever,don't get better than that,
---
failing that....random.... try wotoga or harrpers ferry. depends on your level.
---
I did and you loose debate in your first sentence by following a scheme that has been predefined and preanswered in the original post. I read your responses and you are still delusional or blind or stupid.
---
I was getting garbage every time just using 100-200 scrip so I changed my strategy and saved up to 1000 and used them all yesterday.
---
Got 1 weapon and if it was bad, changed servers. Repeated 3 times and got crap. 
---
4th time I got a zealots explosive black powder rifle and I'm like ok at least explosive so decided to keep going. Think it was 2 more rolls and then another zealot explosive, but this time a handmade. And then last my 100 scrip got me a vamp explosive 50cal.
---
So... I'm not sure if I just got blessed by the rng gods or if the server determines what you can get, but I'm for sure using this method every time from now on.
---
On a similar note; why the hell does objects mess up when i place them near foundations that are elevated?
---
I'm on PC and never had any game mods. This happens to me randomly when out of harm, nothing nearby, in the middle of nowhere. It has a higher likelihood of happening when consuming repeatedly and in quick succession. Limiting CPU affinity to 1 core has no effect nor does having 32 GB of RAM over 16 GB.
---
If I'd to speculate, the game fails to allocate or load in the audio effect which then crashes the rendering thread (yet the background music still keeps playing).
---
A person that says unbugged BE handmade outperfomrs bugged ELaser discuss game meta. Pathetic.
---
I'm a collector and a community organiser. I have four different ones on myself and few I gave to people. I will buy them, because I surf the meta wave all the time, but I will openly debate their true nature and will also defend interests of people who are less fortunate than me. I'm so infinitely above you in every possible regards that its not your fault to be unable to comprehend own shittines, but looking at your nickname you at least try being true.
---
I normally use getting into power armor to fix this but that doesn't always work so ill try this method next time
---
He's useful if you're being overwhelmed by a horde, as far as distracting the enemies for you. But that's only if he spawns during such a fight.
---
They missed a perfectly good opportunity here to make loot bags Vault Tec Lunch Boxes.
---
Are you checking the “save PayPal info” button? It won’t work unless you do that.
---
A good rule is to fast travel without power armor, sometimes you can reach a crafting bench or furniture to get out of the floor
---
My bad. Should have added that. In both videos I added links to I'm using one though.
---
Soak tons of damage? What game are you playing? Beside Ghouls there are no softer, faster dying enemies than scorched. They are the raiders equivalent of F76. And the new variety in clothes is very good, they come in all different outfits since one of the last patches.
---
I doubt they will.  They need to give the PVP community some love, but not at expense of the PVE-ers 
---
I do think there will be PvP only events at times, and that’s ok 👍😉
---
A guest book, and a mailbox where people can leave gifts. Even if people will just take a dump in your mailbox it'd be fun
---
And they glitch out and die anyway if something else doesn't kill them!
---
3* max level Assassin 10mm pistol / 33VATS / 90% weight redux...
---
On a more positive note, i was on holiday for a week, came back to the scrip and spent 1000 i had saved. Got a Supressor Explosive .50cal with 90 redux and Vampire Explosive Pipe Pistol / 90 redux. The other 8 weapons are not worth noting though! RNGesus christ
---
This could be part of the personal terminal, and require a wired connection to the vendors.
---
I would love having a log of sales
---
Don’t worry, the developers probably were most of the time, too.
---
I bet people who are better able to answer your question will be waking up and see this to answer. I upvoted for vis
---
Semi and you’re still doing that much damage? What about towards scorchbeasts and creatures that move around a fair amount as well? And for ammo consumption, do you just make your own with the ammo you perk card equipped?
---
It feels like you are forced into F76. At some point you really get to the end, so that either you challenge yourself (no fast travel, must sleep new char) or you do something else.
---
You could as a matter of fact rather than selling it, hide it in some place in a server and then come here and provde hints for people to find the treasure. People interested in playing join your world.
---
I know a sadist when I see one
---
Tame Megasloth never shut up, they roar every second!
---
Do you have the beam splitter mod on it?  That used to increase wear by like 200%.  Before the fix you’d be lucky to get through a core.
---
You might want to work on the main quest some more
---
What about high damage high dps weapons like handmade or combat rifles? Wouldn't it make them so OP that you're basically invulnerable?
---
And how the hell is that relevant to this sub?
---
Found two of them. I'm from Spain and I'm playing the game in spanish... but those holotapes are in english... My guess is they'll translate them once the tapes have some relevant quests behind.
---
Oh, it’s a good video, and imo new Vegas is the best game in the series
---
If you were landing every shot yeah. For a short duration or until your AP points are exhausted. However, the health you would gain would never overcome the health you would lose since it is only a fraction of the damage points. But if a Vampires Dragon could near fully heal you? That makes more sense than it giving you 5 hp..
---
Your title is confusing and I’m not sure what you mean. You say it does but it that it’s not to blame and stated to another user that you never stated it.  And yet your title eludes that the concern is the game itself. Just bringing it  to your attention. I can understand if English is not your first language and your having a hard time expressing your meaning.  But if your responding to me to justify your meaning then sorry, I still don’t know what you mean.
---
Thing is though, this is Bethesda's problem. Ideally we shouldn't need to have this discussion
---
Because it's a fallout game and this is a sub of the latest fallout game.   
---
Always happy to help people like you out.
---
It depends on the enemy. Big tanky enemies can be taken down much faster with Executioner's once you wear their health down with Anti-armor. For enemies dying from few shots, I'd say Anti-armor or a versus legendaries.
---
Not done sbq many times myself, but from my experience, it's impossible to take her out in time solo. I'd either make sure you're on a full server with high levels on it before you launch or get yourself a team together.
---
Playstation friends list, you'll find survival servers quiet
---
r/dontdeadopeninside
---
Me and my ve dragon say yes.
---
Do you know what are the best challenges? The ones you come up with yourself. Bethesda, plz give that kind person "balls of steel" achievement.
---
I have a be/aae/tse laser rifles but i do high tier trading a lot through discord. I suggest trying the same and on top of that I used my be handmade way more than i use the laser rifles. I'm a vats crit build and use what i need when i need. I don't actually like the elazers but they're useful 2 use if need be.
---
just build low level ones and scrap them.
---
with the vampire laser gat as long as I am shooting I am basically invulnerable. In pve. In pvp I get one or two shot killed before the barrels get sped up. if they're equipped well I just harmlessly light them up and they burst me down despite the healing. I have managed to win a few times but the win ratio was so low I just quit trying. its the trade off for me. A gun that allows me to hardly use any stims and do well in every pve scenerio is worth it considering I can avoid most pvp most of the time. I still get ganked at workshops occasionally but thats about as annoying as a server crash. which means its something I just log back in and recover from in 10 minutes or less. fallout 76 life is what it is and all that.
---
I'm trading extremely rare items. I've never been ripped off, but I hate it. Giving away an AAE .50 Cal for 0 and hoping the stranger does the same is almost crazy... but I do it all the time. But I hate it. It needs to be adressed and your proposed solution would work.
---
Right, that would make much more sense, especially for that weapon.
---
i even seen them for 200 shop around
---
It does, use a vampire.50 machine gun. It’s the perfect support weapon as I can tank through huge mobs with people without one shotting everything and without taking any real damage.
---
What system?
---
Xbox currently server hopping seeing if people are selling it
---
It should work more like absorb on the pokemon games lol That's why I'm keeping hold of it just in case they change it.
---
since BATA
---
I have a shotgun for shortrange, an assault rifle for longe range, a 10mm pistol for in the forest (anything stronger is just a waste of ammo) and 1 melee weapon. I think it totals at about 40-45 weight, which I think is ok.
---
Oh great a 3* 10mm pistol
---
I really hope they do.
---
I got four different ELaser rifles, full set of all possible TSE Legacys, and few unique ones such as suppresors explosive flamer.
---
Despite having BE Combat rifle, BE handmade and B25 handmade, my main weapon is B50 combat rifle and I'm both normal aiming and vats build.
---
The only case when I pick up my ELaser is when I fight enemies that use ELasers, I'm being shot at from distance of 450 meters, and its the only gun I can retaliate with at this range.
---
I appreciate the suggestion but I'm toptier already. I have Russian killers admitting my PvP proficiency, you don't go higher than that, Russians understand Fallout the best due to related real life experience.
---
I wondered, and this may be already answered, but going on what you said, does the purveyor actually sell on items sold for scrip? It makes sense if this is so, and also might be why you got it back?
---
What are you selling that is making you so much?   I’ve had my base in two locations. And lots of random stuff for sale at good prices. (Plans, ammo, a few 1-star legendaries).  Never made a sale.
---
Give me a minute to see if wife is online now.  I'm at work right now but could help when I get home in about 3 hrs.
---
this works only for items worth less than 25k. The ripoffs happen when people are trading real powerful stuff which cant be measured in caps anymore.
---
My life is complete.
---
More important on what you do than what to use.  Don’t shoot her in the air.  When she lands others will shoot her as you melee.  Nuke has to be dropped so that she is active but the fight zone is not radioactive.
---
Move on if bug were your thing.
---
Its playable for most of us that don’t mind, but not worth it for you if that was your concern.
---
Maybe the dps, they shot fast, and the spliter mod full auto gives a lot of aoe, and works whit comando perks and not shotgun
---
If it's unlocked it's fine
---
If it hasn't a lock on it people are fine to take from it
---
Haha, yeah, looks like the devs read it too :P
---
Aye buddy! I also just built one! We’ll have to meet up sometime!
---
Cant come to visit as not on PS4, but have you tried building a fence to stop them wandering too close? 
---
I've had to do the same for mine at my camp, and I've had no issues since
---
Then go to r/Fallout. This sub is specifically for 76.
---
Awesome, thank you guys :)
---
Executioner's is seriously awesome once high hp enemies get below 40%.  The short answer is use both.
---
This helped me.
---
You are the greatest. Thank you.
---
Yes they spawn in the river so it doesn’t help
---
Sorry man I'm all out of spare minutes
---
You can add me if you like, GT: Kaisers Curse.
---
Now Im usually getting supplies for my shop and what not, but if nothing else, I don't mind if you want to team us up so we get xp bonus's from perks, and it gives you a free travel to my camp, which is loaded with supplies you may need, and has all the essentials and a farm if your running low :)
---
Also is your camp south of the top of the world
---
In my experience: 20 min to 1 hour in the silo, depending on how well you kill or tank colonel gutsies, and 5 - 20 min on the SBQ, depending on your damage output and the people who show up. 
---
The silo has a lot of robots and occasionally some radiation, so troubleshooter armour can be very helpful, and PA for the irradiated parts.
---
When you nuke fissure prime for the queen, it's good to aim it so that drop site v9 is out of the nuke zone - that way you can fight her outside of the radiation, and I find we get more people showing up to the event when it's done like this.
---
no, only unlocking locked ones makes people wanted and turrets to attack him.
---
Thank you that would be great!
---
Grats bro so do lots of people and hence why he's getting upvotes and no, you aren't right about all 4
---
Vampires explosive railway with auto receiver melted the alpha in arktos and I didn't need any stims...big drawback is the recoil is a mother f'er...you gotta pulse the trigger.
---
I could craft one later tonight for you, DM me on Xbox GT JaggersLips13
---
What a guy! Thank you so much!
---
I’ve been breaking into people’s locked houses and leaving propaganda flyers. 
---
Three hail Atoms for me I guess.
---
I think it's worth a try - it's, at least in some elements, completely different game that at the premiere.
---
I'd say with all the new DLC it's worth it. The game has gone through so many bug fixes, with only the odd one or two just being brought in with an update.
---
Some areas that had significant parts in the main quest did get revamped such as Morgantown airport, so it mny be worth starting from scratch.
---
The game for now feels so much more alive than it did at launch with player vending, which was a huge positive to the game. A couple new locations were added, with new quests and tons of side quests, such as Lying Lowe(adds a new quest line, a new end game boss(Event Encryptid, it's really hard(according to Beth statistcis, over a million people have died to it)), tons of side quests, and a new event called Free Range, Ever Upwards, Nukashine, and new dungeons such as The burrows(which adds the quest Waste management) and Arktos Pharma underground Habitats (which adds the high level event Project Paradise), and being able to scrap legendaries for scrip, to then use and roll another random legendary, which has made the grind for a good weapon a lot easier!
---
In my opinion, I would start now, because at E3 they'll most likely show off the secound DLC wave Nuclear winter for this year, and that will add some proposed high level things such as instanced Vault dungeons, a new game mode (which in not so good news seems to be a twist on Battle royale, I do hope that idea is scrapped, imo I want a proper survival mode, temperature meters n other hardcore stuff, unlike the survival mode we have rn which is just a OP meta fest(avoid it)) and legendary players.
---
I'd say, as a 600+ hour player, yes to come back, it may not have the Fallout stapled story experience, but it has been over time packed with a lot of new lore, story and whatnought, and in Fall the DLC Wastelanders says to bring a new questline in and make changes to the current one, so that's also a thing to wait for, but aside from that, the game is alive now, and fun, so better than it was at launch.
---
And man, F in the chat for you, I've seen the complete mess of Anthem, sorry man :/
---
Unlike anthem, beth seems to listen to the community a lot more, as they do time to time makes these little questionnaires in the forums to do to say what you like, what you think can be improved and so on.
---
TL:DR
---
Yep I'd say it's time to get back in the game, you'll have loooads of things to do if you start from scratch, and by the time you finish all of that, the new DLC would be on it's way or already out, depending how fast you play.
---
Or make a mass smelter machine you can place that can smelt all ores you have at a slightly reduced acid cost to balance out that you would lose super duper
---
Go to the munitions factory and claim the workshop there’s a ammo dispenser for free!
---
No problem at all!! :)
---
If you aren't sure, test it with and without the perk but i think the powder guns just decrease faster than other weapons.
---
Quick update - the legendary vendor is very hit and miss - getting good drops from arktos ( explosive double barrel shoty ) and tonight @ encryptid got a 3\* BE auto shotgun.
---
That handmade is not very far away. So stick that Vulgar.
---
Scorched snipers with a really high perception would also be really nice. Imagine getting spotted and shot at by one before you have even seen him.
---
Mole miners too. They usually carry some kind of shotgun unless they have a gauntlet
---
In that kind of situation I often like to start again from scratch, but only for a few hours. Starting again is great for getting your mind back on track and in to the game, then, assuming you want to, switch back to your previous main character.
---
WHAT. How did I not know about this haha, I'm headed there now! Thanks for the tip :)
---
i would just hurt myself
---
Getting stuck in the foundations is a pain, as has been said you spawn in where the camp device was originally placed. Sometimes this means you end up locked inside a camp - but my favourites are those that have keypad doors, and leave the code in small letters on the inside.
---
Even more fun if you find this when the owner isn't present, then revisit later when they are, walk up to their door and enter the code and let yourself in, and make yourself at home.
---
Just started on Friday. Was hemming and hawing about buying the game. Glad I did. Really enjoying it so far. Community is the best I've seen in 20 years of mmorpgs. Except for the one dude that hit me with a pipe. Fuck him.
---
Don't you get jump in a second by a pvp fanatic then ? :)
---
I have over 500 hours, i have many many weapons i take with me, its a playstyle not a learned skill, the tradeoff to haveing so many weapons is having to invest in weight reduction perks instead of damage
---
You just go to welch-blackwater mine-harpers ferry- west tek = 500 steel minimum
---
second player vender i went to today had all of them for 350 caps
---
Semi forged.
---
If ure killing super mutants, collect all assault rifle you can and break em down. Think it’s like 8 steel a piece. Go on a year I’ll have lots in no time
---
Removes a random mutation.
---
lol :)
---
Cant help with cores... I just used to farm sentry bots at whitesprings when I used pa.
---
Ammo though... lucky hole mine in excavator armor for lead ore, yao guai for acid and super mutants assault rifles and scrapper perk for lead :)
---
Oh I see. He probably just hasn’t used said Serums yet then. I just woke up when I asked.
---
Thank you, ya I guess small bugs weren't the real problem. I can handle bugs. 
---
FO76 was freezing/disconnecting on a daily basis so just curious if that has been fixed and if I should start over or keep playing my current game.
---
My camp was also disappearing everyday and I was spending lots of time rebuilding.
---
I’ve deposited items into the legendary machine only to see them for sale at the vendor in the same train station.
---
Farm moleminers at welch
---
My guess, if i had to guess, would be the "big" announcement for fo76 at this years E3 will be it releasing in steam in i assume november, plus theyll talk about nuclear winter and maybe touch a little on wastelanders and how that dlc will coincide with the steam launch.  
---
I think the only time theyll mention mod support is that its a "plan for the future"
---
Thanks, I'll give it a try and restart. Any tips on avoiding glitches are very much welcome!
---
There are tons of systems that every online game has had, yet bethesda for some reason felt the need to try to reinvent the wheel with this game. I mean the trade system he just described in the OP is exactly how it was in diablo 2, an online game that came out nearly 20 years ago.
---
The lack of text chat for deaf people, the lack of coloblind mode for colorblind people, a "auction house" to sell items, etc. I don't know why they thought it was a good idea to remove all these things, but a lot of that is why the game gets such bad reviews and scores.
---
Love a good pun, and also a special mention for usage of tinypic. It was like using the internet in 2009.
---
eqip power user to extend the core life. I run in p/a and its pretty much a must have.
---
hand made or automatics eat ammo. If you can find the right spots for iron ore,and have the excavator p/a, and loads of acid (here we go again ), might be a good solution.
---
can get easy 50/100 ore in one run = \*5 steel. same for lead, pre war money for gunpowder. Acid is the real bitch here.
---
Its not, but I think I have an idea where you mean. Is it the small few lakes/ponds your referring to?
---
It may may require moving the feeder around to try and manipulate the spawn as they usually spawn right next to it.
---
My camp is just off the bridge near Sunshine Farm, and I use the rocks below the water line to give the Brahmin a nice walking area without them getting too far.
---
The don't move that far away from the feeder I noticed. If you really need to 'train' them as it were, start with a defence concrete wall. It may look ugly, but you can get a feel on the sight/walking lines of the brahmin since sometimes they 'jump' over the small wooden fences
---
The good thing is Bethesda didn’t go bankrupt and continued pushing content out. It does have issues, depends of your level of tolerance.
---
Very useful information, now I understand that interest in explosive laser weapons.
---
I also recently saw explosive "flamethrower" type weapons in operation.
---
And yes, it totally breaks the little balance that the game has.
---
I would also like those "legacy" weapons to be changed, not eliminated or roll to current perks. But maybe converted into \[legacy\] being unusable (0 damage or canceling your perk simply) keeping your tag as a collection object.
---
Another option is that when a weapon is withdrawn its utility from the game will allow that legendary attribute to be changed by another ONE TO YOUR CHOICE.
---
They want to do something PVP but it is broken all over the PVP due to the NULL balance in the game (vats, bloodied, bugged weapons in player possession).
---
We remember that they are not weapons that are simply 10-30% better ... but they have changes in their precision and range when originally they were maybe for almost melee as it was with flamethrowers.
---
P.S. they should also change the anti-armor. And explosive, make a rework if it is energy, do not change the type of shot that is made to be explosive. A rework of the explosive attribute and the anti-armor attribute and all happy = D (more or less).
---
No they didn't, most of the people I saw playing WoW came from GW because they got sick of the lack of an open world, and the crappy systems in place in that game.
---
If they wanted to use a different game than WoW they should have went with Diablo 2, which is literally the trade system they described in the OP.
---
Yea a note telling them the prices are too damn high in vending machines..
---
My camp is south of the top of the world where there is a lake with a guaranteed spawn of 3 Brahmin plus the one from my feeder
---
Yep this weekend they were back......
---
Only 1 Legendary this time for me.
---
Ah man I don't think you get them there! It's best to do the repeatable quest in the Dolly Sods Campground with the Mr Handy that asks for bug parts, you get mounted bug plaques and pemmican, insect repellent and also the illusive bug grenade!
---
Campfire tales would give you the recipe for S'mores and the plan for the pioneer scout tent.
---
The repeatable in the Toxic valley I believe it's best drop is a Pioneer Scout Bowie knife paint, because a scout needs some clout with his blade!
---
You beat me to it
---
i do run a shop on reddit specifically for low levels and lately i seen more actual new players visiting me rather than alt accounts
---
👍
---
Or instead of having to make work arounds for the shoddy trade system they have in the game right now, they could implement the trade system the OP described which has been in online games for over 2 decades. Hell, he literally described the trade system in diablo 2, a game that came out in the late 90's.
---
Ill buy that for a dollar!
---
Lol actually probably more , will visit your shop soon!
---
if you are pn ps4 check out my account to see what i can offer i donr charge anything other than maybe some ressources
---
if you were an outfit or just dont care for asthetics your best choice atm would be a full set of heavy combat armor lvl 20 with bos paint
---
You want something in a Bethesda game to work perfectly as intended? You must be new here.
---
Im usually on for a few hours each night, so feel free to stop buy if you need some items from the vendor. Everything is cheap so shouldn't be a massive issue for cost :)
---
If your on this evening and join my world, I don't mind building some free armor if you like.
---
Ah Beth's last Inside the vault had a stats for the most sold items!
---

---
Yeah, I have the excavator set and it's super useful - I even have a lead resource harvester at my camp. Is there a different weapon you would recommend then? I'm not particularly attached to the handmade, I just usually use rifles in Fallout and it seemed like the best one.
---
&gt;This is the kind of content we want... 
---
No, no it isn't.  Stop pretending you speak for everyone.
---
Sounds to me like you should stop preordering games lol
---
Then you probably want to be in the forest and close to or on the western edge of the divide...between top of the world and Charleston.  Less chance of SB and mob attacks, closer to high traffic areas like Whitesprings.  
---
The hand pump and small purifier need dirt to "find" water, so an actual body of water isn't required to place them.
---
Or at least trade 3 cards for 1 new. Similar to legendary scrips
---
No my Brahmin from the feeder is fine but the 3 that I get from the location drown so im looking for a way to stop that
---
Wait wrong post sorry
---
I found a good location with 3 Brahmin that spawn. It’s my adhesive steak and milk farm. It has water too
---
I really appreciate the feedback CyHentaiSenpai!
---
I don't have any friends playing on PC currently, and I'm on XBOX but have definitely been crippled by the bugs. Glad to know the game feels more alive and ya the player vending is one of the things that got me interested again!
---
Thanks again for the other info on the new content and your F for the Anthem experience. Beth does seem to care way more about their players than BW. 
---
I'm gonna give it a try with a fresh start
---

Lately I’ve been functioning entirely out of Dolly Sods and I’m finally getting good with the blueprint system. Eventually I’ll have an entire village blueprinted that I imagine I’ll be able to get built within maybe 30 minutes of claiming the workshop.

The extended budget and various settings/sets at workshops make them pretty great spots to build!
---
I want to find whoever thought missing bulbs in those atom shop letters was a good idea and feed them to a rabid radrat....

Imagine what the world would look like if you used a bike though? Already takes two minutes for scenery to load in if I sprint anywhere.
---
Ya that's a good way to do it. I've restarted games before  with this approach, and had good results. Just wanted to see if the community felt it was worth it.
---
I'm definitely gonna give it another try, cause again, I truly love the Fallout series.

Either this is a cry for help or **clever Marketing**...

You can use trip wires and hide them behind/in walls, under stone stairs, under benches, chairs, and beds :) I find it extra entertaining when ppl do it to themselves and they seem pretty happy with it too haha
---
That's true. This would most likely be something they'd add once that issue is sorted I suppose. XD
---
Percentage based healing in my opinion has too many issues associated with it. Adjusting the current flat amount healed based on weapon type seems easier to balance with less undesirable side effects. Obviously, they would want to use the data collected so far (or start collecting) to make better numerical choices for each weapon type that align with design goals. Thoughts?
---
They are too busy going after an author who wrote a book called "redfall" so they can steal the name for the next elder scrolls game.
---
Shhh you know you want those quality tasty steaks and to wash it down with a cool refreshing glass of Brahmin milk for only 5 caps
---
You can see some examples in CAMP one and two in this video

Even if we had a choice of broken or fixed ones it’d be so much better. Hell. I will search the wasteland for lightbulbs if that’s what it takes! But they way they are at the moment, no thank you. First time I felt I wasted atoms...
---
That is the second most beautiful wedding picture i saw.
---
Best wishes for you two.
---
Hahaha😂
---
You're right. I've only preordered Fallout 76 and Anthem, so my success rate is 0%.
---
Definitely not gonna be preordering anything in the future
---
To be extremely pedantic, wood only drops as 1* as the result of a encounter/reward. The only place you can get 3* wood is from the Legendary Vendor and you should scrip it immediately!
---
Found a mod for the cultist blade this weekend.  
---
Think its called sacrificial blade? 
---
Changes the visual to a zigzag type pattern with slots cut in the blade.  Think it also bumps damage by 10 or so points.
---
Probably just atom store update this week
---
What is wrong with a major game taking a year to develop? You do realize most triple a games take roughly 5 years from start to finish right?
---
Thank you so much, we really appreciate the kind words
---
Claim Poseidon yard workshop and defend the fusion core generator. I think in a few hours I got about 20 ish?
---
Also, if you can get the Power User perk (I think that's what its called) it grants longer for fusion core useage. Definitely a must have if your a PA user!
---
naaa...I have my radworms I'm good....they also tell great stories
---
I completely agree with a lot you wrote there, besides the game balance. Apart from some sore point, the game is balanced for 4v4 synergizing builds, and hence, besides the laser, there is no weapon that is universally optimal for pretty much all situations, all other weapons are situation specific and can be countered by walking onto a better position.
---
AntiAtmor for energy weapons is next thing I believe needs looking at, but AA ballistic is great, and none of the AA weaponry posses the same characteristic - being a must-have - as laser does.
---
I also think that no weapon should be made ineffective retroactively, and there shouldn't be anyone hurt severely because the weapon they looted half a year ago or bought for 1/4 ownership of their souls suddenly became unusable.
---
Yeah me too. Tried the new arktos event and lasted as far as the lift down lol. Then got disconnected five more times in the couple of hours I tried to play for.
---
Yeah admittedly fo76 was my first and only preorder
---
You mean Crytek? They are doing amazingly well and have been licensing the Cryengine to many other major developers, such as CDP red with cyberpunk 2077.
---
Door with level 3 lock or keypad access ;)
---
The first legendary I found was a Troubleshooters Explosive Plasma Gatling... Had no clue how good it was until I used it. Makes clearing silos stupid easy
---
**Hey there Sport! It's Dick Shale! You've been awarded to the *NUKA COLA CONFESSION Trophy*. Enjoy your glimpse of honor while wash it down with a ice cold...
---
 **NUKA COLA**
---
I personally haven’t had any drop from those events, but I would love it if they did.
---
true..............but you can spawn   LOADS of scorched.
---
try a fissure site and reverse thinking. If you WANT an s/b, then it wont show up, but the scorched will, in silly numbers with shotguns and shells.
---
don't even need to server hop, just wait 2 min.
---
big bend tunnel east - generally an auto c/shot in the lockup.
---
tip.... forget the auto version.... hardened reciever with anti armour mag. still puts out 2/3 round/sec and blows thru anything, and I have only 3 in shots
---
I've died in Lewisburg a couple of times, when I'm trying to loot the picnic tables and instead slowly sit down and get back up again in the presence of a bunch of angry Super Mutants.
---
That's not bad at all for a sniper build.
---
That's pretty... lit ...Mark.
---
I thought it was only when my camp couldn't be placed, but I've noticed that sometimes when I switch servers the machine comes fully loaded again and nothing has to be relisted. Like you said it's inconsistent.
---
I've done here almost 50 times by now and as far as I can say It'll always depend on who will join the event, try to launch on a server with around 5-6 lv 150+ to make sure you don't waste your time, these players will most likely carry an arsenal of TSEs/BE/AAE which will do the most damage. Demolition Expert 5 and an Anti-Armor Explosive or Two Shot Explosive will your best bet, bring repair kits or atleast 5-6 weapons and enough ammo with you because these will break, melee ain't the best but you can help Clearing adds off those guys shooting her. Try to shoot the bones in her wings or her belly, you'll do most damage there. Psycho and Balistic Bock do help alot too. You can cripple her wings to force her to land with the right perks making it much easier to kill her. It's also not completly true that you do less damage when she's in mid-air, that's only the case if she's moving around. She'll sometimes get stuck in air making her as vulnerable as if she'd be on the ground. Still there's no guarantee you'll get her on your first try, it's still really buggy and as of the last update she sometimes flies out of map and gets stuck there
---
Neon genitals sounds fun...alas I am already at my 50/50 light limit...
---
They must be working on something, server keeps crashing

GT aGraciousGod
---
Apparently it's 60% longer, the equivalent of Good With Salt 2.
---
some bug fixes would be nice..
---
When it’s time to fix all the shit that’s been broken since beta, that’s when Todd almighty will allow mods and mod support. 
---
I just wonder if the content from the modding community will be free, or if you’ll have to purchase a micro-license. I don’t mind supporting hard working modded at all. I’ve done it before for a few FO4 modders. But I’ll be damned if I’m giving  Bethesda more money for more broke shit.
---
RIP BUDGET
---
Sorry, I'm applying real world logic - 308 is 308, regardless of the weapon using it, and a hit is a hit.
---
Variance in range and accuracy is acceptable/understandable, but for the same round, the damage should be the same, regardless of the weapon type.
---
That my sniper does 110 per shot, the LMG only does about 45 per shot doesn't make sense to me.
---
Lol good point. Ya, Bioware has completely abandoned Anthem, while Bethesda seems to be trying to fix things, whenever possible.
---
Happy to hear man! I wish you all the best of luck in it, and the luck in the RNG gods to get a sweet legendary when you need it!
---
Hell, even with 1 STR and (eventually) the refrigerated mod, this fucker still gets me to 255 CW. Not bad at all.
---
You should get Dick Shale contracted for radio ads.
---
Surprisingly I still have a chunk of budget left, not quite sure how...but I’ll take it!
---
They promised display cases a few months ago but apparently fell quiet on those and are now calling Wild Appalachia completed ...while we're still missing promissed content
---
Oh, I highly recommend Cal 50 MG, Handmade and Gatling Plasma explosives for her, there's also a perk for heavy guns which gives you a slight chance of crippling her wings, but the more hits the higher the chance, I use a TSE minigun to do that and she's grounded almost the whole event. Rocket Launcher with targeting hud and the right perks works even better
---
I've definitely learned my lesson with preordering🙅‍♂️
---
Ok, level 30 here. Waited to level up before going to legendary vendor. Bought a 3* ranged.... got a level 50. So much for matching tiers. Grind for hours only you get something I cant use for weeks.
---
Maybe... or I could hack the speakers at the top of the world to broadcast advertisements instead of whatever rose wants
---
Go and read the notes inside the Whitesprings. Not going to spoil, but there is explanation why we can't access the housing/room areas.
---
sounds like a good one.  
---
BTW, if you haven't already found it, there's a mod that adds barbs and extra hooks :)
---
Ex. I shoot a mob with exp lmg, it goes Al OS dead, then regens and keeps regening against exp shots. Normal bullets still kill it, though.
---
Same. I got it the day the vending happend. Just wanted a new fallout and finaly got the game. Glad i did too. Haven't played anything else since!
---
Last night on xbox, I FT into the workshop at the old airport ( can't remember name, mid left of map, has super mutants and I was going there to farm them ) the workshop was under attack so I figure I can FT straight there help the owner, then do my farming for death claw hide... win win...
---
As I materialise I witnessed some lvl 203 or 208 sneaking in and shoot a level 12 noob in the back... whilst he is trying to fend off the ghouls attacking what I later realise to be his workshop and then the level 200 backs out in sneak mode then logs off... the poor noob didn't have a clue what was going on and my mic was broken so couldn't even tell him.
---
This was the single most chicken sh!t low act I have seen in this game. An utter 'see you next Tuesday'.
---
Vampire minigun basically does make you invulnerable as long as you are firing and hitting something.
---
Thank you again for everything and I appreciate the RNG wishes!!! Hope you get an equally good roll!
---
Nukranberry
---
Go to the Lucky Hole Mine with your Excavator PA - I leave that place with 260 Lead Ore (on average) Just need Acid for making the lead scrap (x5 per 2 Acid and Ore), Gunpower (acid and cloth) and Steel. Have the Ammo perk (forget the name of it) in Agility, and Super Duper on (Luck) and you will make a shit ton of ammo. Takes a little bit of time but WORTH it.
---
Is buying armor 3* armor pieces better than buying weapons? I'm starting to gear for endgame and dunno where to start. I have decent 2* armor with good stats on all parts. But i need a legendary handmade rifle as none of my weapons are legendary.
---
Use the "strobe lights" and you can connect them to a terminal to control them.
---
Its kinda hard be a old player and make new character. Since people helped people from the day zero, there are many people out there who now feel its their turn to help. Its kinda strange when you are a rich mofo and some poor newbie comes to your new character and tries to share stimpacks and some gear. I know level 4 all look the same but its really hard to explain somebody who is level 60 on your first char its not appropiate for you to pick their stuff if this level 4 alt has 600k worth of gear on him...
---
Yeah
---
It was the scouts update that got me back to the game. Started a new character to see how quickly I could get up there and get a backpack. Then I realised what a grind it would be (good kind of grind) and realised it would be so much easier with my well established level 70 character.
---
Switch guns every so often.  Let the ammo pile up for the unused gun.  This seemed to work well for this and every other fallout game in the past.
---
Maybe an Atom Shop switch-up, but I doubt there'll be any updates this week.
---
They're probably holding off until next week, when they announce stuff at e3.
---
Maybe even the start of Nuclear Winter and it's roadmap.
---
Or replace all her chem mentions with your slogan lol
---
Good idea!
---
&gt;I keep getting......
---
Does not sound random to me... Maybe we would be better with a real random.
---
I think the best solution is to remain calm and calculated, don't just spam activate as you blindly whir about. I personally have never ended up accidentally trying to sit or sleep during a fight. Drink grosse water while looting, sure, but not exactly a common or detrimental occurrence.
---
Sorry, so the "scouts update" got you to start a new character, but you went back to your old level 70 and kept grinding from there?
---
Hey hey hey - it's not about size!
---
I sell all my plans 50 caps i have 110+ BUY MY SHIT
---
Has anyone ever proven that luck has anything to do with legendary drops?
---
Are you drunk on your own ego mate?
---
Is....is this a thing?
---
ya
---
PC? maybe we need to hook up to start exchanging..
---
Sounds like you are getting what I want..
---
What's the fastest way to get one?
---
No, sorry, it didn't make me, just that backpacks seemed like such a gamechanger that I wanted to try having one from the start so I started again on purpose.
---
I swim in ammo and fusion cores here is how i do it. 
---
Fusion Cores- Take over all 3 power stations I build nuclear generators to power the fusion core generators this will produce 7-9 fusion cores every 15 minutes make sure to check them every 15 minutes because they only hold 3 each. No need to go crazy with defense's large concrete walls 2 turrets is all you need. ( don't keep any junk you don't want to lose on you PVP in workshops)
---
You will want batteries included and power user for perks.
---
Ammo-  I will break this up into 3 sections
---
Steel ( use scrapper perk)  I server hop at Welch Train station I usually get 150-250 steel per hop just kill the Mole Miners and scrap the weapons and check for missiles in your inventory they weigh 2 pounds each.
---
Lead- Lucky Hole Mine and excavator power armor 3-4 server hops will get you 700-1000 lead ore be careful not to forget about having ore on you it weighs .10 pounds and will add up fast.
---
Acid- Mountainside Bed and Breakfast will always have 2 static Yao Guai that spawn every server hop by the train cars you can kill them from the high ground if needed I find it faster to just melee them ( you are trying to make ammo not shoot bullet sponges) this will get you 10-12 Acid each server hop. Additionally you could take over Hemlock holes workshop it has 3 acid extractors but I find killing Yao Guai faster.
---
Super Duper and Ammo Smith will get you extra ammo I craft a ton of ammo like this.
---
I am on Ps4 if you want to team up I could teach you my system or I could sell you ammo and cores.
---
True.. I think I still have 15 Improved weapon repair kits. and I'm not a "farmer"
---
must admit .... I always carry the hand made for the single shot fire rate.
---
preference is 308/50 sniper,combat or handmade,shotgun.....and the rest.
---
all hardened and armour peircing and single shot.
---
only tend to go thru ammo with the handmade as used as close to med range support. Apart from the 35 round mag, its not epic, unless you can find a legendary, but others love then (probably cos they look cool and make a nice noise).
---
combat rifle's on nearly par and can excell depending how you use it.
---
gauss can be good (really good) but suffers from poor shots/sec and accuracy.
---
I'm knocked out by people ignorance combined with arrogance, I stand arrogant people fine, I just get into rage mode when I meet such.
---
I have indeed an inflated ego, but its appropriate to skillset. I am being doubted by people who have no clue what they talk about, not a think I take lightly.
---
I would like to hear that from anybody else than the one posting it.
---
Ya except then you'll have people who are like "It's so annoying to have to hold A down to do this"
---
Wasn’t us but sounds like you guys had the same idea! Nice
---
That's better than something that'll become obsolete eventually. Keep grinding until level 50 and then cash your scrip in
---
I'm saying you may find a situation where it is a good gun.  
---
For example, I am a melee build, no heavy weapon perks.
---
I got a troublshooters gatling a while ago. 
---
Have not completed mayor for a day, so Watoga robots will attack me.
---
On my second trip through Watogo, I got simultaneously attacked by 2x assaultrons and a L80 SB. (Last time I was attacked by assualtons, I didn't live long, and died several more times trying to recover my loot.)   It was first time against an L80 SB.
---
Found that gatling to be very effective against the assaultrons.  
---
With them out of the way, I turned it on the SB.  Worked really well.
---
On the way from the train station to big bend, a L50 SB showed up.  Took it out with the same gun.
---
Not really, but still with unyielding set I only buy from the Purveyor with 20% health as I do when I craft ammo/chems/etc.
---
Maybe its only a feeling but I think I'll get luckier through it.
---
How so? When cooking a batch of, say, ten Glowing Meat Steaks, the game would calculate the probability of Super Duper triggering for ten individual steaks and then add the extra items all at once.
---
Basically, instead of (craft → check), (craft → check), (craft → check),... 10 times,  it would be (craft → check x 10). This is a really simple concept and it would take the devs little to no time to add to the game.
---
Get super duper 3. Equip it everytime u are crafting ammo.
---
I know that feeling very well...
---
I kill for caps get over it
---
If your low level your not gonna contribute much to the fight in terms of damage but the best role for low level players is support. Bring a shotgun/enforcer perk and cryolator since the effects of these weapons are more important then the damage. And clear the area of smaller hostiles and heal people.
---
Son) its not a thing and you are an idiot?
---
I'm trying real hard on this next character to never use PA. Beds, chairs and benches suck.
---
Those things you can only use out of PA are easier, so that's ok.
---
That's obviously why they're there...I was responding directly to "Unless it's something I haven't reached in the story yet."
---
Ty
---
"Flame proof" to the rescue..
---
Killing is a thing ok
---
man, I can never get my CW down, so always rely on extractor PA.
---
In one of the long past version of the The Elder Scrolls, people got so pissed off at not being able to locate loot items, corpses, etc. because of the vegetation, Bethesda relented and added a control to toggle vegetation on and off (apparently, it consisted of a single layer).  I keep praying for that feature in Fallout 76.
---
Extortion
---
that's why I bang the 1\*'s at the lower cost..
---
So the scouts update gave players a backpack, with more room to store gear? Is that correct?
---
I kinda just do events.
---
/r/imabadass
---
Lights don't eat much budget anymore, but there's a limit to the number of lights you can make.
---
One more advice for fusion cores. Kill Sentry bots in the whitespings resort. Each one gives fully charged core and !EXPLOIT! warning, they can be looted before and after explosion. So each kill yields two cores. I hope Bethesda fixes thia exploit though.
---
do you have a clown outfit to complete the ensemble?
---
I have "you have been Insulted"'s for sale. 12.5k!!
---
Word
---
I’m at 50/50 xD
---
In fact I do XD
---
I have the same issue, not sure what's going on
---
Ditto
---
... thank you for not being on pc... the one I encountered the other day was the first... lured me in with 127 plans for sell. Wasn’t even worth it as they’re one of those that sells inflated... guess that was a trap too.
---
For steel, pick some low level areas and kill Super Mutants and Scorched, take their guns and scrap them with the scrapper perk on. I like Point Pleasant and Grafton. They use the same guns as the ones in high level areas, but you spend less ammo killing them. 
---
Make sure you equip a maxed out Ammosmith and Super Duper when crafting ammo as well. 
---
With all that said, I’ve stopped crafting ammo altogether. Now I just buy it from player vending machines. Just look at the map icons and see who’s selling lots of ammo. 556 is a little harder to find because it’s popular, but it’s usually readily available. As long as you’re able to get your daily caps from vendor bots or from your own sales, you’ll be fine this way.
---
Check your ammo, you may have absentmindedly built up a type you don't use and you're suddenly carrying 10lb worth.
---
For steel get the scrapper perk and break down assault rifles looted from super mutants. If I want lead and steel I hit can chime spots. Several places have 3 to 5 can chimes and can be server hopped. Saves using acid for smelting.
---
And there he sat dying, thinking of all the accomplishments he had made, wondering what he would’ve changed in his life and as he drew his last breath he says “it was worth it”
---
You could do Biv's missions until you can craft Rad Ant Lager. boosts your carry weight by 50 for a short time.
---
Start with the tadpole badges.
---
All 2 and 3☆ Legendary Enemies have a health regen when they hit 50% hp. Sheepsquatch also always regens health at least everytime I've fought it.
---
I wonder what speed demon + bike would be like
---
Check YouTube, specifically captainnoob as he does a tutorial about all the different ones and where to get them and their upgrades.
---
To be fair it was more "run screaming room to room while buddy clears it" then anything that character did itself XD
---
They never fixed the weight bug on the heavy combat armor right leg  in FO4 did they?  (Left leg weights 7, right leg weighs 9).
---
Legendary enemies all does this. But if you have high enough damage, you can 1 head shot critical them to avoid that health regen.
---
Jigglypuff
---
There’s no level requirement so you can wear them immediately.
---
What lvl are you? And what weapons and techniques do you use?
---
I just roll with urban and a forest left arm.  You can't really see the color difference with just one piece.
---
This
---
I do. I suspect this may be the issue. Perhaps they rolled back the fix by accident akin to what has happened with other issues.
---
 I have a small group of friends, seldom have more than two other players when we do this event. We are, after a week of trying, able to generally complete one area. Sometimes we are able to keep a second creature alive, but rarely. The event is meant to be completed by two to three full party's working in cooperation to get the best rewards, This is NOT an event for casual players who can't work together as a team. The rewards scale to match how well you do. This is absolutely Bethesda's best effort so far for a high level community event, emphasis on high level.
---
Take a picture of someone/something in rain. But the subject name has to appear in the lense.
---
Hope this helps!
---
I wouldn't mind walking around with an entourage.
---
Stealth and aiming down sight
---
This is awesome! Nice!
---
Were that true, I would have thought you'd see posts here complaining about why can't you just press a button rather than hold for these actions.
---
Maybe there are those posts out there but I've yet to see them. On balance given the similar responses from other people just here alone let alone other posts, I think it's safe to say that this change would be well received.
---
(thumbs up emote)
---
I watched the tehsandman and donboi melt many a bodyguard on Ps4. Good luck wit that career choice.
---
Lvl 35 leaver bloody
---
oh sweet lord let me get those flower pots!!!
---
Mothman must love you!
---
I wouldn't mind someone doing the same on PC, I can supply the supplies to make it or pay for it or something
---
We've waited over a decade for physics to be unlocked from fps. That's been resolved now so we're no longer bound to 60 fps.
---
I was thinking just a camp decoration made from scrap resources. The poses would be interesting, but I’d be happy with a set of armor in a crafting station.
---
you guys.. XD
---
Problem is I haven't seen rain in something like a month+ in this game let alone the past week. Driving me nuts cause I can't do the challenge if  it's always sunny!
---
Annnnnd..... I'm.... at.... work...... sigh .... well you can have an upvote good sir.
---
Question for you: Were you on the same server that gave you that piece the first time?  Rumor has it that RNG isn't so R.
---
you can add me as well :) same ign
---
I’ve sold a lot of stable flux and legendary weapons.
---
I'll settle for changing the color of the bag, a beige bag in dead grass is so hard to see, let me make it bright blue, or orange. Something that will catch my eye.
---
quick !! downvote the post above to oblivion before bethesda saw it !!!!
---
Also, if you want a change, toxic Larry’s meat shack spawns three snallygaster’s every server jump for 15-20 acid and a treasure map every 4th or 5th jump
---
Ähhh okay. Thought it's a bug or sth.
---
It took me about a half hour yesterday. I had a harder time realizing that I actually had to have a subject in the picture.
---
Wow, I'm so thick I had never thought of whipping out my Troubleshooter's Explosive double barrel for that 🤦🏻‍♀️ Just kept it for silos...
---
Had this happen a few days ago, I've seen mobs instantly die in mass before when new players joined the area and figured it had just happened to my own pet. I had only had him for literally that day and world hopping for player shops killed him.
---
I guess that makes sense.  I rarely find any legendaries worth keeping.  Let alone selling tho.  And I have enough troubles finding the glowing masses I need for making whatvlittle flux I need myself.  :-/
---
placement of the Brahmin pens (the wheelbarrow things) is key.
---
I've seen people keep Brahmin on a 1 tile rooftop by placing the wheelbarrow there, so I'm sure you can shuffle the spawns around a bit.
---
or you could build a big red barn and keep your cows indoors to keep them safe (might also help with visitors killing them if you lock the doors)
---
One : mothman is dawn uncommon  
---
Two : It doesn't always drop a wing -\_\_-"
---
Lol...
---
Ok?... one down...
---
You unironocally sound like a communist.
---
It has always been in the game, however rad shield doesn't suppress effects.
---
Tyler County fair grounds workshop has three of them just dont build extractors
---
we use to call this type of challenge : the trainee's quest ... we even have named him : "Cluedo"
---
diluted rad-x is OK
---
You don't need to trust anyone.
---
1. Join the same server as a friend.^*
---
2. put the stuff in a container.
---
3. make sure your friend is still connected.
---
4. log out.
---
5. change character.
---
6. rejoin your friend's server.
---
7. take the stuff out of the container.
---
Your possible vulnerabilities are a your friend logging out or a server crash between steps 4 and 6, or someone noticing what you are doing and stealing your stuff before step 7.
---
I've lost some stuff once (my "friend' logged out before I could rejoin the server), but it usually works fine.
---
(* how you make friends is an exercise left for the reader).
---
Radx allways has but rhe diluted version dosent.
---
The good mutations only seem to come when I'm not even trying anymore.
---
I wish he did. I’ve only seen him a few times. Usually when he’s trying to kill me for no reason. He did appear near my old camp once...and stood there staring at me as my turrets killed him very slowly...
---
Seems hit or miss with me. Most time it doesn't suppress my mutations. Same with radaway and stims
---
Would be cool. I really like the road leathers but I hate that you can never see it since I use heavy combat armor.
---
use diluted rad-x, radshield, grape nukacola afaik
---
Too bad, I am on PS4
---
No just a PIA lol
---
The problem is that each letter represents another thing that the system needs to reference it's location in your camp.  Every letter has an X, Y, and Z coordinate that it needs to have stored.  And everytime that someone comes to the CAMP it needs to look up the XYZs of every item and place them.  It matters less about the size of the item, and simply that it's an item that has coordinates it needs to place.
---
I can sympathize with wanting to have more letters, but it's not as simple as making it have 0 budget.  If it was reduced to 0 I'd imagine people could create horrible situations where too many letters simply crash people trying to travel to their camp as the game tries to get and place thousands of individual letters.  
---
Personally I wish we had signs we could type into - it would be easier and take less X/Y/Z for the sign.
---
network? use Ethernet and port forward fallout 76
---
Yeah, I go for the 1 and 2⭐ ranged. Got some decent stuff, and some crap, but at least it's cheaper and tends to suck less. Went and bought 7x 3⭐ ranged on the first day and only got one worth keeping. Once in a great while I'll take a chance on a piece of armor, but with all the crap in that pool, it's not really worth it.
---
To be fair they didn’t say they wouldn’t get melted
---
Humans could already be dead or mutated on  the inside leaving only logs.
---
the fact is WHY do they keep giving us this kind of quest ??? 3 in 2 weeks at least !
---
we already talked about that before : DON'T GIVE THEM IDEAS !!! XD
---
the pioneer scout tadpole and possum badges will keep you busy for a while and earn you your very own backpack.
---
you'll need a prosnap camera to do some of the challenges which can be a pain to get since it spawns on a corpse that's placed in a random pre determined spot (serverhopping recommended, i personally got it laying on a picknick table near the giant tea pot)
---
next to that there's the sheepsquatch questline which is very fun and doable solo (don't forget to get the extra Bonus quests by clicking the pieces of paper on the board in Lowes taxidermy).
---
Only the final part is a group event, but people usually join that
---
both quests can be started by activation their appropriate posters (i think both can be found at Train stations)
---
Just someone civilized and able to think beyond my own predicament. You unironically sound like a greedy, self centered authoritarian.
---
Workshop ownership should work like camps. 
---
Ownership persists across logins unless someone in that server already owns it, in which case you are given the chance to try another server or let it go.
---
That would give players more engagement in owning and using the workshops system and I think would give more player interaction opportunities.
---
Oh cool so the tadpole stuff does expand into a bigger thing. Is it challenging? I guess I’m just thirsty for challenging solo content
---
&gt; I’m sick of being owned by super mutants and colonel gutsy’s
---
Colonel Gutsys will own you at any level in any armor.  The grocer's apostrophe wont protect you.
---
Sure MstrMustache55 after 9pm est tonight
---
There are plenty of airborne diseases in the world, it’s not hard to imagine a radioactive, decaying, disease ridden animal might possibly get you infected
---
No it only affects the duration of chemicals meaning if it has a buff towards + strength and you get that for additional time where as ( simpaxs heal overtime so this would affect the amount of time that it takes to regenerate your health which would be almost a negative effect as it would take longer to heal ) max out first aid if you want to maximize your simpax
---
How do you get pwople to come to your vending machine? I have yet to have a single peraon come. Am i missing something that i have to do to make it visible to players?
---
it's more of a grindy thing for rewards
---
for challenging check my edit about arktos pharmacy and the burrows
---
same, but different.
---
If I have hardened mass on me, then I WILL get jumped by 6 mrlk kings and killed twice.
---
If I start heart of the enemy,....bye bye server. completed that ONCE out of 20.!!!!!!!!!
---
line in the sand.....event failed. ???????  WHY.?
---
also, mini rant over.
---
Dude I have four Brahmin one is from a Brahmin pen the other spawn at the location of my camp
---
Wait until you're preparing for your first "Attack on the Workshop" and some high lvl player fast-travels in just to one shot you with his super weapon.  Then, if you're stupid enough to challenge him to a fight, you may end up losing half your caps AND all the improvements you built around the workshop.
---
I bet you don't.
---
Ok, so what do you do with your game time now?
---
The interior would make a killer PvP map as well
---
Thanks I will check that out 15-20 is more efficient then 10-12.
---
Wha
---
My network is setup kind of shady, I'm using my laptop picks up the neighbors wifi, then I turn on my hotspot on the computer.  Sometimes I can play for hours and never get kicked.. Sometimes it acts like a two year old having a temper tantrum. But more often good than bad. But seems like when I setup the workshop and get to rolling with it. Bam lost connection with server.
---
oh I guess the names make a lot more sense now, I figured that's just how you named m lol.
---
I had my camp set up where the three wild brahmin span in a lake near top of the world. My solution that worked wonders was puting wood foundations under the water in the deeper areas so the could never sink low enough to drowned. Hope this helps!
---
Go to westek collect all the weapons and uranium fever mine. Collect everything scrap. Easy 500-1000 depending kn you
---
Two comments on this:  
---
1) since the last update I've had 15% of mobs fall through the floor within 2 seconds of dying losing the loot  
---
2) Mothman immediately turns into ash pile no matter what weapon used so it might just be hard to see
---
Your sins are forgiven, go forth and spread the word.
---
no
---
Yeah that’s where my camp is. I’ll try that method
---
Your sins are forgiven, go forth and spread the word
---
I myself am not sure of one, but a good way is the two train stations in the ask heap. Invest in the scrapper perk and scrap every weapon you come across.
---
I did it yesterday. Climb a mountain and look if you see clouds and stormy weather. Run in this direction and take a picture in the rain.
---
airborn and waterborn diseases are their own thing a glowing mole rat that I insta kill should not give me bone worms
---
radiation wouldnt spread a parasite or bacteria its electrons shooting through me ripping apart cells and dna causing mutations
---
Same here, I carry 5 rifles and a SMG, and have strong back, thru hiker sturdy frame and pack rat and bandolier all maxed. I start out with 115 lbs of available carry weight, by the end of my session I'm usually 400+ lbs over-weight, however I plan my scavenging so i'm usually within easy access to a train station or know workbench location. When xp farming I make sure my route ends up near a workbench. 
---
I also swap in a 3-star action boy/girl and also have speed demon so I don't really notice the over encumbrance.
---
Carry both.  Start with AA.  Switch to E after enemy health below 40%.
---
There's a Fallout 4 mod called 'the Beantown Interiors Project' or something like that. It opens up lots of the boarded up buildings and fills them with lootable junk and stuff. We need that
---
Buy 2* weapons until you get something functional that you like, or can trade easily for another 2* . Once you get a decent weapon, you can start trying for 3* god rolls. 
---
I did this trying to get a good handmade, got a bloodied FR Tesla instead, but traded it for an AA FR handmade. Now I spend my 150 scrip on 2 3* armor and one 2* armor a day.
---
All those Handmade skins... Just waiting right there in the files...
---
absolutely, but only if they ad a new type of gamemode/server that's lvl 50+ only.
---
that would open up so much more of the map for long time players, since it not worth it going there anymore.
---
The machine needs to be connected to a power source to appear on the map!
---
I was at a camp.. heard the rat-tat-tat.. and wanted to defend that camp for the owner... I ended up wanted due to some stray fire.. I thought.. what the hell...
---
I don't really care about the diseases and I'm almost sick all the time, they don't have significant impact on your character. Just, by the time I finish my usual run, I fast travel to Whitespring to well know sulfur spring to heal completely and for free.
---
Just do a super mutant hunt and you will get loads with scrapper perk.
---
Favourite places to do each day, Huntersville and Harpers Ferry. Kill everything there and scrap the weapons. Ferry can be inconsistent depending on what spawns, but even if its scorched, theres still steel to be had. 
---
XP and supplies rolled into one :)
---
You have my vote! Please yes. Or at least provide 60 seconds of immunity time to allow us to log off.
---
Workshops have their own mats:  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Workshop\_(Fallout\_76)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Workshop_(Fallout_76)) 
---
I build what I need to and then toodle off. If I'm done playing for the day, I leave the stuff there for the next person.
---
It’s visible on my oled tv aswell.  There should be an off option in power armor on third person mode.  I rarely use power armor now.
---
Wait, there is a way to reroll legendary items now?!
---
Well as a melee build I would assume that blood and guts tend to fly about around you. Just because yo kill a creature doesn’t mean you kill the infection.
---
Then you lose 10% to the vendor tax. For large transactions that's a huge penalty.
---
Ditto. Though Bethesda Austin has some incentive to try out Battle Royale mode. 
---
Sadly, from the audio clips that have been data-mined and the achievements that got leaked in the non-english versions of the game, it really looks like the vault 51 dlc is going to be a type of battle royale mode.
---
If you step away from the player POV on it and think about it as a game studio CEO, the addition makes sense. Well, it makes sense given how chaotically some of the game's design has been so far. 
---
Battle royale is the easiest form of gameplay mode they could introduce. Well second easiest after they made a huge deal out of adding PVP mode.  And adding new gameplay modes can LOOK like a bigger update then just new quests or endgame content. At least to some people. 
---
The other thing is that Fortnight makes a ton of cash off of cosmetic items. They really want to monetize this game and after they started to put game altering items into the Atom Store, I think we can finally admit that the "lunchbox" code that was designed but never implemented really were planned loot boxes. It would explain why they introduced RNG into the perk system, if you could collect more perks in buyable perk packs. 
---
So I can see someone at Bethesda Austin saying that since this game's on life support anyway (no hate intended, it's sales have been really bad and it's got a very negative rep right now), so they probably think that might as well experiment to see what could work and bring in more revenue. If battle royale can boost Atom Shop sales, then it'll be a win for them.
---
I like it, and honestly I don't see a whole lot of claimed workshops when I play. Maybe 2 or 3 loading in to a "busy" world.. a lot of times nobody's claimed when I enter a world.. idk why that is workshops are the way to go when it comes to a lot of valuable resources..
---
I sound like one of those who support free market, democratic and capitalist societies, you know, the only successful societies the mankind has witnessed and the ones you live in and allow you to play Fallout 76 instead of starving and working in some kind labor camp.
---
I had one of my better farming runs yesterday 
---
Someone nuked WS and I probably ended up with close to 15 legendaries including a couple of 2 star weapon drops.   Basically got half of my daily quota just in one pass through
---
I bounce back and forth between Uranium Fever and Whitesprings because it’s centrally located and honestly pretty damn easy
---
No.  Removing the Green Zone from the area around Vault 76 would prevent new characters from joining the game.
---
Suggesting a New Player select a different server is excessive as the New Player has no context for what is happening.  Their character exits the vault and succumb to radiation.  They would then respawn at V76... and succumb to radiation again.  This is a negative play experience and would not grow the player base.
---
 Rr
---
Ill have to double check that when i gwt home lol i hopw thats all it is
---
He saved your camp from raging cats...
---
Been doing the same but only after I rolled a 3* vamp/noct golf club with 40% swing speed. The night golfer
---
You say it only affects the duration of chemicals,  but stimpacks are VERY clearly labeled as chems. Also, I already have first aid so an alternate solution is not an answer to the question.
---
Perhaps if we respawned faster.
---
AITA for retreating from a mirelurk queen’s acid spray (to be get distance) which then caught the attention of a camp’s turrets - which were then destroyed by the acid spray?  I put the beast down but the damage was done.
---
I would have repaired happily but it was a private, level 3 locked camp.
---
Tried that, can't see any on the server I'm trapped on.
---
That's a nice looking character.
---
It's cute you don't realize you live in a labor camp. I guess all that western capitalist propaganda, and the endless distractions and escapes afforded us, have really been paying dividends. You're a wage slave that can't see his chains. That doesn't make you free, it makes you ignorant haha.
---
It’s a pretty big risk experimenting with it right now if you ask me. And given that not all of the bugs have been patched out it might be an even bigger risk trying to add a PvP multiplayer mode like that. But ultimately it ain’t my game, I just hope Beth knows what they’re doing cuz they’ve been doing good so far.
---
That would work too. Whichever would be easier.
---
“Ahh, reclamation day! Time to go out and enjoy the world! I’m going to save Appalachia!” *takes one step out of the vault* “ohh god! It burns! Why is my flesh melting off my bones! It’s okay, I can respawn! This isn’t the last of me!” *respawns back at 76 as it’s the only fast travel location unlocked* “WHAT FRESH HELL IS THIS!” *infinite face melting loop*
---
I fast traveled to a player vendor base and spawned directly into his small, locked private bedroom.    He even had a sign—“F*** off”—to share his views if those who would pick the lock to his bedroom.    I imagine his frustration at not recognizing that was his spawnpoint for others.
---
Mostly run aroynd doing events and clearing whitesprings.
---
And close the damn door!
---
Also if WE will spawn in a nuke.
---
Hate spawning into a nuke zone.
---
Fighting inside the rad zone makes it so everyone has to be in PA or a Hazmat suit. Neither are good for builds that aren't optimized to be in them.
---
Vanguards
---
Bloodied
---
Bolstering
---
etc.
---
I think it's for the reason you had an issue. Lots of time invested to get it to where it's useful with moderate/low chance of connection loss means it's a negative sum play in my book. 
---
I only play an hour or two once or twice a week and I would love to do workshops more but that's a lot of lost play time.
---
You on ps4
---
Naw, a nice dose of rads is what every growing boy needs.
---
Ah, I see.  Yeah, if you're dropping a weapon for 10k, that's a sizeable payment for security, I see what you're saying.  It's probably alright for smaller trades but that's a lot of caps to sacrifice for a security that should theoretically be implemented within the game by the devs.  Good point!
---
If the nuke warnings were back-to-back it wasn't us. We ran each silo then dropped the nuke. Rinse and repeat.
---
But my vampire ripper....
---
Remove the bots, any link to the overworld, change any items from lootable to static objects and performance would be smooth like butter
---
Damn! Two questions:
---
- FPS, did they go &lt; 10 at any time?
---
- 759 dmg per shot? WHAT? Oo
---
You have to work towards it, there are missions to complete and badges to collect, but yeah, you can relatively easily add 100 carry weight!
---
Wait....you can get a plan for the Fixer? Which Event? How rare is it?
---
Personally, I won't play it if it's a BR. Maybe if it gives some cool rewards.
---
Nah on PC my dude
---
&gt;have to drop things that I don't want auto scrapped and I'm worried that someone will come upstairs and help themselves to it while my back is turned
---
If this is the real reason.... then just have one empty room that is locked and put bag in there.. leave rest open.. solved.
---
I think if you limited it to being able to send only to someone on your current server, it would at least cut down on the spam that would inevitably happen.
---
Better yet, since it's possible with some part of the API available to harvest player information remotely (it's available on the map), make it so that you can leave a message only by being *in* the person's camp, more like leaving a note as opposed to sending a message.  If you have to 'physically' travel to the location to leave a note, it will introduce additional time (loading screens), and make it less enticing for someone to create a spam-bot to annoy everyone.
---
(If you don't think someone would go to the trouble to create an addon that would harvest user information and sent ~20 spam messages every login, you have too shielded in your travels on the internet)
---
I do this, and not just because sometimes it's a legendary but because it's usually easy ad the decent thing to do.
---
Bandolier for ballistics and theres a different one for energy ammo
---
Thanks for rebuilding your base for your fast travel point and vending machine placement based off spawn. The amount of bases I get stuck in on a daily basis is pretty crazy.
---
Maybe
---
It isn't all about the "loot".  It was about the group of us hanging out in the discord, talking smack to each other, and killing as many SBQs as we could while having a good time.
---
Ammo expenditure-wise... we came out ahead. I went in with 97k 5mm rounds, and only used 25k for a solid 14 hours of non-stop killin. Now if I had taken a mini-gun instead, that would have been a completely different story. But the longer I think about that, the more I realize I have not seen a mini-gun legendary drop from either the vendor or anything else in a long long time. I mean I know they exist, but I have honestly never gotten one to drop.
---
kill super mutants (at west tek) and collect the gun. Get the scrapper perk and scrap at workbench. 18 steel per assault rifle, a round of west tek easily gets you &gt;500 steel
---
A-well-a bird bird bird, b-bird's the word.
---
Yeah, it's really cool that we can fix stuff at peoples camps! I fixed some barriers around someoenes generator. I didn'trealize it was being attacked by mobs. It cost like 1 concrete each.
---
Three requirements:
---
1. Be able to enter a silo yourself mission-wise.
---
2. Be on PC.
---
3. Bring enough ammo for yourself.
---
Why?
---
I like that idea in theory. In practice...
---
It's not like the houses are boarded but have anything inside.
---
In game, they are empty shells. It's not just a matter of going in the GECK and scrap the boards.
---
Developpers would have to create an interior for each unboarded house; Sure many would be simply copy/pasted. 
---
Then you have to define the surface as buildable, then define the door frames as snappable if you want to put a new door on them, etc....
---
A lot of work that isn't really needed currently for the game,  IMHO.
---
It would be better to ask the developers to provide us with existing house shells to make a "house alike" CAMP building.
---
Yeah definitely, started from scratch with nothing and now I’m making more money than I usually spend, with flexible schedules too! I’m sorry you’re stuck to a 9-5 minimum wage job, but that’s where people with low IQ and no qualifications end up. 
---
P.S. remember to flip those burgers!
---
a 'musket' is as close as your going to get. or a flintlock,...pretty much the same thing.
---
I have been known to open up shop and just bullshit with the players that's show up for my wares.
---
low level I was at whitespring almost the whole time but once I got over 60 that place got really stale..now I'm usually in a team with my friends..doing SBQ and encryptid and other events as much as possible..if I'm not farming for resources i usually just farm caps..now that we have the purveyor it creates an interesting dynamic..since now I look at farming legendaries differently..I trade a lot on the market subs..so a lot of my time lately has been used for trading purposes..I have a lot of endgame weapons now..I think there is only a few more that I need ..BTW I have two characters one is level 86 the other 78 similar builds..hundreds of hours clocked in
---
Oh I have the ability, just not the motivation. Got half way through a few times but end up with a big case of ‘meh’ so again I thank those of you who do and have written to Oprah begging she do an show about you.
---
I've done this quest only once, since when I explored Monongah, the servers wasn't very stable. So if I not mistaken, this quest was auto complete, you shouldn't return to the house again.
---
You can try again and confirm if my memory is hazy or not. I will try it this weekend, if I have time.
---
Cool. Could have put it with my other two rolling pins and golf clubs *yawn*
---
It sounds like he was maybe saying he wouldn't be able to kill it?
---
There are static spawn points for plans, but the plan that spawns is from a set RNG table.  
---
If you're trying to find them in the wild, Top of the World is your best bet. It has 4 armor plan spawns at the 3 armor workbenches. 
---
FT to Top of the World icon, and run strait up the hill to the small shooting range. In front/left there is an armor bench, a plan spawns on top of the shelf just to the right of the WB, there is also a chanfe for a weapon mod, and camp plan. Turn around and run into the lodge, a crowned mob spawns for a chance at a map, there's a camp plan spawn on the counter by the bell. Run out the window to the left, and down the hill to a T intersection (downhill, middle, uphill), and take the middle road to the "raider alley". The first shack on the left has a weapon bench, and a weapon plan spawn on the table to the right, and a camp plan spawn under the counter. Conti ue down the alley, there are 2 weapon/armor mod spawn points on shelving, before you reach the  last two shacks. The last shack on the right has an armor bench, a mod spawn, a screw spawn, and an armor plan spawn. The last shack on the left has .308, shells, another armor bench, and 2 armor plan spawns on top of the two small shelving units.
---
Then continue through, and down the path to the 3 cabins. The cabin on the right has an armor bench inside the right door, along with a weapon mod/plan spawn.  
---
After leaving the cabin turn 90° left, and the building(s) directly up the hill has a good chance at a legendary mutant.
---
Before they unlocked all so many uncommon plans, this was a multiplt daily run for me.
---
Tick blood tequila works by damage, it's insane. Full health every hit for a minute with op melee weapons.
---
Yup. Checked all areas and got zip. No biggie I guess. Enjoyed the event despite the chaos. *fragrant venison* wtf is that??????
---
If I wanted to play BR I’d buy one of the hundreds of available titles that cater specifically for that. This could be an unfortunate direction for 76.
---
That said, I m sure there is a certain demographic that will enjoy it lol.
---
I dunno, I've adapted to current controls, and I could see having buttons all the sudden behaving differently really jamming up my flow.
---
West tek
---
I've know idea, ask yourself why *you* have come to that conclusion from what I have written. The mirror never lies.
---
Oprah ^^
---
Buyers special..there's gems in the machines
---
I saw you. You look like Trump jr.
---
Huh?   She should be shot in the air—but not staggered—to get her to land.   Ideally using weapons that cripple her wings.
---
Disease chances are AOE. You can diseased through walls or when you're above a diseased mob.
---
My personal experience is Mothman tends to attack me (aggro vengeful Mothman, just just a random one) is mid savage divide, closer to ridge adjacent to forest region. North of Top of the world up to Palace of the Winding Path, closer to the west ridge than the east. That's my best advice for simply wandering for it.
---
Thanks for the reply, I realized that our builds are more set up to farming in a nuked region. :)
---
I don't have a monitor for FPS, but I never had any problems.
---
759 dmg per shot is pretty easy to get. Actual damage was closer to 1k because the gatling gun also had 25% faster fire rate legendary effect. But sheet damage doesn't show that.
---
I edited the main post again to explain the gun damage a bit better.
---
If you had any concept of what "nothing" was, you'd realize that money =/= wealth. It's fairly obvious that materialism is the distraction you've latched onto, and you are in good company. Lots of wage slaves LOVE measuring their worth against the debt they incur obtaining things they don't need with money they don't have so they feel like they aren't living in abject poverty. 
---
When the system that provides for you does so at the expense of 90% of the other humans on the planet it's not sustainable. That's just basic math, G. But I won't try and separate you from your comforting doublethink and self rationalized fallacies. Unlike your freedom, you own those.
---
Yes so basically u just server hop repeatedly to each other..since it resets the bots inventory
---
Awesome. Have you tried it recently? I've been able to confirm that all the magazine spawn points documented online got relocated, although I agree I've seen a ton of plans spawning in that area.
---
Old creatures you tamed are there, but I don’t think you can tame new ones anymore. 🤔
---
It fires a ball using only the ball and gunpowder. If it is not rifled, has a smooth bore barrel it is a musket. But it calls itself a rifle, this means it has rifling (spiral grooves to cause the projectile to spin increasing accuracy), however rifles don't use balls they use sabots or bullets which are shaped to grip those grooves, so neither you or your friends are correct. This is not a real weapon and Bethesda made an error by combining two different firearms to make it.
---
I use Rad-X for when I have mutations that lower my charisma when selling or when I have one that drops strength to make a quick trip more comfortably.
---
Very useful. If you have a marsupial you can see it quickly, otherwise you can look at it on the status screen.
---
The wanted part is your own fault, but I totally agree. It's annoying ending up inside foundations.
---
The in game version is percussion lock, but resembles a black Bess musket, which was flintlock.
---
Workshop advice: Go to the ones with a simpler layout, loot whatever's there, put on power armour and best weapon, check the map for nearby players, claim the workshop, stick around for the first "Attack on the Workshop" event, bail.  Taking a workshop away from somebody else costs caps . . . and may lead to a pissing contest if the owner contests.  Be happy with the initial claim reward and the defeat the attackers rewards and the loot . . . and move on.
---
It’s getting to the point where I’m getting stuck in my OWN camp’s foundation when I fast travel home. 😂
---
If it's a totally separate game mode, and doesn't have any effect outside itself (and isn't really 'important' from a lore standpoint), I don't really care.  It's another mode I won't bother with.
---
It *could* be cool though, if it wasn't a PvP mode, and was actually a battle royale style solo/team PvE mode, either an endless wave style event or a tower defense kind of situation (some camp info seemed to be part of some of the data mined information).  Obviously that would still be an optional mode, I'm not exactly sure how you'd work that into the story, but I'm sure with some imagination it could be figured out.
---
Ya, thanks for explaining this, I was gunna, but am glad I don't have to, as I've had to 1 zillion times to my own friends :P
---
One of the spots I’ve seen robot armor plans spawn at regularly (and many other types) is on the barrel to the left of the tinker bench in the  larger of the two utility sheds outside Blackwater mine. (Not the shed with the power armor stand)
---
Easily half the plans I’ve found, including most of my combat armor plans have come from this spawn point.
---
I think I read it’s coming along with bobble head stands. Pretty vague but it’s been mentioned. I think?
---
Hit various sites looking Plans and outfits that might spawn there.
---
I just took all my doors off and took the switch off my garage door. What does it matter? Mobs never go in, and assholes would shut the garage door where my shop is. They would also shut the door I left open to let people out of the room folks spawn in. Only thing I lock are my water purifiers (one too many times I needed water and they were empty).
---
Have 5 pieces of weapon weight reducing armour ..I’m a god darn walking arsenal
---
Did you ever get a reward for completing this quest?  Unless I was asleep both times, I didn't see any experience points, caps, or reward items.
---
Ah, convenient!
---
When you planning on doing this ?
---
+karma
---
Sorry but no it fucking isn't, especially as a builder in pre existing structures lol. Nothing can be placed even in green, and the stuff that does just teleports up a floor or onto the roof.
---
I'm fairly certain there will be a presidential update in the future which will unlock \*some\* of Whitesprings- not all of it. It should allow access to the exclusive suite at Whitesprings, as well as the &gt;!presidential portion of the Enclave bunker.!&lt; Also there's voting terminals all over near the DMV and railroad stations, which I think will allow an individual to vote for a "president" in the wasteland- kind of like how the leaderboards work in Survival.
---
All of this is just a theory, of course. But I'm fairly certain we can expect something like this in the future.
---
are you feeling that there's little left to keep your interest for much longer? I hate that feeling when you know your about done with a game thats provided so many hours of fun, and distraction. If they gave some sort of reward/benefit to the old-timers, I could get really into it. I've read that the prestige system may be underwhelming in order to keep game balance.
---
Yes, I agree. I did the pixel refresher 3 times. Now it's barely visible. I'm going to be more careful now.
---
A scorched with a T-51b, jet-packed, carrying a legendary explosive minigun.
---
It's worth it *to us*, that's why we play.
---
Now, will it be worth it to you? I don't know. Only you can find that out.
---
Nah, I've been getting some seriously good armor pieces. Had more good time armor drops off her than I have off 3* in the entire 700+ hours ive played.
---
I’m only level 42 but I just kinda flop around. I’ve been trying to get the damn hunter’s longcoat for like a week now. I think the robot is just trying to hurt me at this point.
---
FPS is a big problem on consoles, it’s always going to be fixed in the next generation..... :(
---
I see, thanks! I use a minigun and right now the max I can get is &lt; 40, still have to earn some cards, but damn!
---
I'm about 50+, and I don't farm the queen. I just go attack her whenever I see a launch. But I've also been on a server where people do 3 launches in a row, so that's 6-9 repair kits each time that happens.
---
Was this just a massive brag post? Oof.
---
I do the same and it's pretty consistent. I would say if you don't get one outside it's probably because you're on a "cold" server and you're better off hopping to a new one.

AAE lever 
---
Quad E radium
---
But mostly mutants nonesense and a 3* that was all vats related. So really just a brutal rng.

Yes, and what he said lol

Gives a whole new meaning to fast food🤣
---
I wont be playing it. Probably one or two times just to convince myself that I dont like it. They should be working on instanced dungeons or something in that direction imo to add things to do in the endgame. Thankfully I'm quite addicted to farming/trading, otherwise I would have put this game in a drawer quite a long time ago...
---
I mean Project Paradise is cool and stuff but nyeeeeh its 15ish minutes, you know what I mean
---
I mean.. that's a really good point! Thank you so much!
---
Yes. This slows her down majorly, makes it a lot easier to fight her in melee.
---
Bryabr4 is correct. In the game files, the duration and magnitude are two separate values. What s/he is saying is that IF chem fiend affected stimpaks it would only affect the duration tag and not the magnitude. Thus, it would take longer to heal the same amount. To increase the magnitude value you have to use the Int/First Aid perk card.
---
Better yet, a preview option.
---
I've also been a dick only once to use a two shot fat man on a low level but I ended up giving him stim packs n other stuff after
---
You can glitch into most, but they're empty shells with nothing inside, or walls or anything until you leave them.

West of garrahan mining company, not in a mine. All up and down a hill , lots of iron ore . But west tek is where I go. Average 600-800 steel a run. And 70-100 plastic .
---
I've spent 6 card points to look forward to this.. awe man..
---
Nah, this was my first ever post on Reddit. I tried posting this yesterday but it got taken down because Reddit thought that I might of been trolling or something and where was I bragging?
---
I erm, hum... you can have brahmins at a CAMP too?
---
What kind of Gatling plasma? I have a bloodied damage resist while aiming one I use but the queen dropped me a regular one yesterday.
---
Yep just gives us the D2 trade mechanics and we will be fine each get a green check mark and done, this is exactly why I only sell stuff for caps and don't one for one trade till they sort this out.
---
Thanks man, will check out now! Pretty new to Reddit
---
It’s features people have already asked for with “I’m a game design student” slapped on it. Lmao
---
"I want you to draw me like one of your French ghouls."
---
Deal, I'll PM you
---
Link?
---
Yesterday a player (Congadog?) was kind enough to message me in-game to tell me that my vending machines were out of power (molerats ate my pylons).  We managed although he spoke German and I don't. Isn't that what you want?
---
My friends do the armor and they said it was pretty decent.  I looks like randon weapons generator is rigged like a 1950's casino.
---
Also, price things to sell and you can keep moving product. I make serums, chems, ammo, and sell plans. The only thing I really mark up are good legendaries for their rarity. Having 4 full vending machines with a good variety of items is more alluring, and if your camp is too far out on the map that could also hurt sales if people don't want to pay the fast travel price for the risk they won't like the goods/prices or chance you will disconnect before they actually get to shop.
---
I've also noticed a lot more visitors when I am at my camp, because people can see my characters level and feel there's a better chance I'll be selling good stuff. Not that I'm saying you should stay at your camp, but if you can AFK in your bed while you take a bathroom break or have a snack it helps.
---
I'm about to do it, so if u are online now send me a friend request and I'll invite you
---
 Pretty sure I live on that same lake. I usually have one of the cows regularly drown themselves. However, I'm a big beef eater in game. I usually run down to the lakeshore every spawn-in to gather my lunch, grateful in the knowledge that my "magic" cows will be back again in the morning, much like Thor's goats. Also playing an insane spear wielding barbarian with a "Mystic" Uru metal spear named "Doug".
---
I worried about that too, and first time I have a problem I'll lock up, but so far no issues. Most folks maybe cook something or just do a quick repair.
---
I have a Hunter's explosive plasma gatling and haven't noticed any decrease in my durability lately.
---
Did you maybe have the Gunsmith perk equipped and accidentally unequip it?
---
Hows saying I'm a game design student bragging?
---
Yes I was.
---
?
---
lol
---
Enough to buy *LIGHT WOOD LAMINATE LIGHT WOOD LAMINATE*

The updates haven't ever affected them. I still check through there on a regular basis.
---
Line in sand is very easy to answer, you ain't fixing the sound machine.
---
Kind of, but on PC you can only use Mic's to talk to people unless you mod your game.
---
Its on the PS4, i will go to an event. Thanks for the suggestions
---
Yea its absolute BS. My Yaoi Gui was fine and would survive everything in my camp.
---
One log in after a week not placing my camp kills it :( Id have been more happy if an enemy killed it rather than nothing :(
---
Also the Greek O hovers in front of what you place it on!
---
Honestly the game hasn't really gave me any god roll drops..i just started finally getting explosive guns..before that..absolute crap..so I'm always pretty excited for SBQ.. we do it repeatedly some days..I actually don't mind grinding..been playing RPGs for a while..don't see myself stopping anytime soon..since this released..all other games that I own have been put on hold..my backlog is ridiculous..I mentioned in the previous post that i trade actively so that's another aspect that also brings me back to the game..there are some things that I'm not crazy about doing like..farming for lead or disease cures..and we got the purveyor now..it's like a slot machine lolol
---
Well I bought an AAEFR Railway and a TSFFRRW Plasma Rifle which both came from the purveyor so I guess you just have bad luck
---
Agreed, tie it to base damage.
---
Those are definitely the top three places. Anywhere with super mutants is good too. Top of the World, Sunny Top Ski Lanes, General's Steakhouse. I've heard people mention Sugar Grove and Robco but I haven't had much luck there myself. I have had decent luck just walking the highway from Watoga north through the Mire. There are a ton of spawn points on and around it so there's a good chance to get legendaries.
---
True survival then.
---
Yeah i think my highest priced item is like 175 caps i believe so the prices arent too high. I moatly have plans and ammunition for sale,  i guess i dont have my vendor machine powered up i guess lol
---
I've just starting FT nearest to the camps and walking the rest....I need the exercise anyway. :)
---
I've watched a few videos and it's indeed great. It's funny, being French, to see how the voice change to fit tastes (or maybe because actor X is cheaper) but the French team did a good job as well. Mr Handy are pretty funny, Rose is awesome with a hint of grating.
---
I can't tell about other translations but the French ones For Bethesda Fallout have been excellent; not perfect but heh, it's a massive amount of text to translate and voices to do.
---
Keep flipping those burgers or they’ll burn!
---
AA VATS VATS rifle would have traded well on the trading subReddits.

Sometimes a Scorch beast or the queen that has died near you will just teleport and crash ontop of you!
---
Encryptid event drops it.
---
It is where all the old guests are at. Just like in the first episode of the walking dead where they locked them behind a door, the staff have closed them off at the stairs and have started to do "renovations."
---
The horde events can spawn a bunch as long as you don’t kill the boss
---
Sorry I am at work won't be home till later
---
Yea lol. Plus it's way more disappointing getting a piece of shit when it costs 100 scrip as opposed to 60. My method is save up enough to get a few rolls and make sure you have 150 scrip in the machine so you can immediately scrip any piece of shit you get instead of carrying it round for a day.
---
Did the reset happen yet? Are the new solo codes out?
---
Ah no wonder I haven't seen it, not had much success at that particular event. Good to know though, thank you!
---
Ideally - Vampiric+Crippling and/or FRoF (I have 3* gatling plasma with Fast Rate of Fire - it's beautiful. But other two - damage against robots and Def while reloading - not so handy).
---

Yeah that how I found out. Marsupial not working. Cost me my life but now I know 😬
---
Mate that hotel vendoring idea is genius
---
Yep. Thanks. Was all back again next time I logged in.
---
No worries my friend. Glad I could help!
---
Everything
---
Where did you get that backpack? Is that a drop from the Paradise event?
---
If I get one more 3* nocturnal rolling pin... imma flip my shit
---
two star is the legendary vendor meta..
---
Backpack for president.
---
Armor always 3 stars.  Weapons a mix of 2/3.
---
I see. I’m havent risked trying to tame anything else for a while, so I may have not noticed. Thx for the clarification
---
Miniguns while fun to see the hot lead flying out... are not the most efficient guns out there.
---
So just like Zelda BOTW and let me guess the Cryolator cold freeze the meat for you and extend it's shelf life?
---
One Violent Night is random, I’ve had 3 3stars then the last boss at 3 star too.
---
Save it for a late-night Pizza delivery role
---
And it is fairly rare. If you're a planhound, I would recommend buying it if you can, rather than farming the event for it.
---
Yes.  There's a plan called Brahmin Pen.  It's the green bucket thing under Resources.  You place it and it will spawn a Brahmin that generates fertilizer and can be milked.  It can also bring a fair bit of unwanted attention to your CAMP from enemy NPCs.
---
According to the wiki, you can buy it from the Harper's Ferry vendor if you don't already have it.
---
I just want that the leather jacket shows your ACTUALLY underwear.
---
Nice!  I found a bloodied deathclaw gauntlet with 40% swing speed for 125c
---
For sure, but they’re my favorite, fml lol
---
Would lag, if every person on server had a pet.
---
Well at least I would have some arrow mods for the crossbow.
---
If its too high, find it somewhere else for cheaper ... can't find it elsewhere?  Then the price is the price.  Simple economics.
---
I've gotten 1 3* vampire explosive vats cost and 3* str swing speed vampire grognak other than that like 15k scrip wasted
---
So who down voted then? lmao
---
We're two weeks out from e3 so next week will probably be a minor bug fix update. Then an announcement about Nuclear Winter on the 9th and the first update for that on the 18th.
---
&gt;Some people were not very happy with the other post for reasons I don't know
---
It's reddit be prepared for open sometimes brutally honest post criticism. Sometimes you just get something that doesn't sit well with people and they let you know.
---
Don't dwell on it or take it too personally.
---
God i hate the weather down in the bog sometimes. Keeps raining sb all day and no fitting umbrella
---
Actually, this is a much, much better solution. I did think about that people may spam place the letters and whatnot, but I couldn’t really think of a solution. 
---
But yes, “signs” that you could just type into that Judy’s showed the letters would be fantastic. You shouldn’t be able to tell it’s a sign, though, it should be just the letters how they are right now without a border or anything like that. I imagine that this would also fix the quite irritating snapping system that the letters have too (at least the neons, they don’t snap correctly)
---
I always just read it as Black Powder "Rifle". Considering it uses .50 balls, it's a musket, regardless of what some clueless dev calls it.
---
It's like using "coal" to make water filters instead of "charcoal" (Yes, it still bothers me).
---
Thanks for that, I'll keep my eyes open for it, I finally got the Hunters Long Coat yesterday (and reached level 100 too) so this can be my new Grail.
---
Yup this it's coming though it has been delayed
---
I never actually considered that but yeah that would also be cool! That would give me a reason to buy a cryolator
---
When I was playing Saturday morning, it seemed every camp I visited had a downed glowing scorchbeast on it.  It was the oddest thing.
---
#ComfortingLies
---
This is supposedly coming down the road, but didn't make it in for Wild Appalachia.
---
Some interpreted it as being able to display any item in your CAMP, but it sounds like it's going to be bobbleheads, magazines, and possibly weapons.
---
Yeah but when I spawn in there I outs like a way out....
---
Yeah, the snapping for most of the letters is pretty fucked. In fact, I was most disappointed about how hard it was to actually make the letters look how you wanted them, rather than the number of letters.
---
I'd give it a chance if it were Fallout BR. If everybody in Battle Royale were on equal footing (no legendaries) I'd consider it, but if I have to go against other players who are decked out with the best gear that drops it's going to be a waste of time.
---
Yeah calm ;)
---
Apparently gonna give u trophies u can display at camp from what I heard
---
"Draw me like one of ya french ghules"
---
one of these spawned on me near Welsh station in the southwest portion of the map yesterday, major shout out to the person who helped me kill it (Xbox)
---
Viewing of Pete's body will be at 3 pm today.
---
He is survived by his water melons which were "de-lish". His legacy shall be poached and plundered by the hungry. 
---
Pete was a long time protector of his habitat. But early last night he was caught off guard by an invasion of feral ghouls which brought his life to an end. He will be missed by his trusty owner garlandtd.
---
both in good order,learned from previous attempts.
---
usually after first s/b drops. only completed once, didn't do anything different.
---
their are little things that this game just doesn't want me to do.
---
heart of the ememy, took a solid week before it 'let' me finish.
---
Oh wow. Yeah, there are so many stuff locked in the CAMP and, well, How am I supposed to guess that "a bucket = a brahmin".
---
When seeing it, I imagined that you would put your spoiled meat/vegetable inside and it would produce more fertilizer than what you get at the Chemistry bench.I was way off :p
---
I would love to do a pedal by shooting on a mob of Super Mutants.
---
Yeah your doing 5 times damage with a beam splitter. My BE laser does 500 damage all up per shot, which is rediculous with 36 round mags and a fast fire rate.
---
Add-clearing is also helpful to you if you're running Adrenaline -- you need to string some kills together to get that 60% damage boost when you turn your sights back to Her Majesty.
---
Exactly.  What ever happened to "You cannot rest when there are enemies nearby?"
---
Pirate tricorn. It glitches through a. Little but you only see it from above
---
Civil War cylinder and hunters long coat. Steam punk look af
---
Well sometimes it lags to show up while broken so if you don't look you fail.
---
Out of all my runs, and i do the event whenever i see it, at least on pc, I have yet to experience random failures.
---
I wear civil war dress and my antlers (limited item around Christmas)
---
Owned by the original wasteland heavyweight champion "Nuka Mike Tyson".
---
Its not good compared to what i have.
---
Major holiday on the USA so I’m sure the guys got a long weekend off
---
Dont worry.. just like the exPA and the bookbags.. I'm sure we will get new skins for it... for 1000 atoms
---
Ooo that civil war hat doesn't clip?
---
Lol
---
seems like all I have to do is look in the direction of Morgantown and this event triggers.
---
The higher the rof the better this weapons are
---
Check for missiles (2 or 3 lbs) and mini nukes (6 lbs!) in your ammo tab. They add up quick if you’re not paying attention to it.
---
Are you on pc? If so my ign is Knucks1337 but im online in 8 hours
---
He is. I named him Kermit. :)
---
Bandolier and Batteries Included might also help, depending on your build.  Bandolier reduces the weight on bullets.  Batteries Included reduces the weight on energy ammo, but also on fusion cores.
---
Personally, I carry three weapons.  One rifle for sniping, one rifle for big mobs, and a bowie knife.  I also regularly dump my excess ammo, especially missiles and mini-nukes, in train station suitcases.  That shit just gets really heavy, and isn't worth the stash hit when vending.
---
Nope. Looks like its extra made for the mask haha  fit perfectly together
---
This may seem like a dumb question, but I don't play that much...  How would I tell the real from the fake?  I've seen and killed 4 of the Legendary Sheepsquatch and got gear.  What is a fake one?
---
Sorry I’m on Xbox, updated post to avoid confusion 👍🏻
---
Funny enough I’ve done it so many times the repair part it’s maybe easier then hacking a level 3
---
Excavator power armor gives plus 100 plus the shocks will give you another 100 and then with the bug with excavator power armor giving another 100 when you log out and back in the armor will give you plus 300. I have 550 carry weight most of the time. If you die in the armor you will lose 100 or get out of the armor you will lose 100 until you log back in out again so don't die or get out of armor. If you don't like power armor your going to have to get the pack back and the mod that gives you more carry weight for plus 120 carry weight. Pack back does not work in PA.
---
I have both vampiric 3* gatling laser and minigun for sale at my camp. Won't be off work for 8 hours though
---
Happened to the Mrs. She built on the farmstead that got added with lying Lowe, South of r&amp;g station.
---
I’ll keep my eyes open and save it if I get the drop. I’ve been getting a lot lately.
---
Oh my bad.
---
I could have sworn e3 started next week!
---
All th see different companies making announcements on their own schedules must be throwing me off.
---
Or just show up in general vicinity
---
That's a nice weapon I have one ( just bloodied) and with a sneak attack I can 1 hit most enemy's.
---
Spicy Deathclaw tamales with some tato sopa!
---
My teammate wears a prospectors hat with his. Looks pretty trippy.
---
I get great enjoyment out of killing the scorched skiers.  Not sure why but I do.
---
Honey! Where's my checkered suit?
---
That should be a fine location
---
I paid 9k caps for the letters too, but I have no use for it as camps are now invincible. I bought them just to write "no turrets" on the front door so people would bother to read it with their goddamn eyes. Turns out, it was the last day before the patch as I bought them.
---
That is my dream weapon, been searching for weeks and all I find are exterminators deathclaw gauntlets for like 5k caps, it sucks.
---
Easy solution just wall it off no door needed. Switch the wall to one with a door when you need to get in and shut everything down. This can be done in the build menu. Select the wall press the "modify" button and switch it to a wall with a door. 
---
No one will even know it's there. Also you can't pick a lock that isn't there.
---
It seems like such an easy fix, too. Just have the server detect where you are and where the build is and spawn them 20-30 feet away from it.
---
civil War suit, civil war hat, meat hook and railway rifle
---
I expect more of the Whitespring will definitely be unlocked in the future. I want to see the inside of the tennis club!
---
Powered door + pressure plate = exit door that closes itself.
---
it happened once so far...
---
I had 2 copies in my vendor 300c each from yesterday. It is common if you do the event. In my experience the imposter head is the rarest drop from the event and the white fedora is the most common. I have 40 plus of them, really need to sell them to a vendor.
---
Ohhhhh yeah
---
Thing is... subjectively speaking I have gotten mostly straight-to-vendor 1* shit in the 1.4k hours I have played.
---
Actual nice/useful stuff is an utter rarity, I would know because I am using it right now and only now I have actual legendary 'spares' to trade.
---
So, when your baseline is utter 'meh' anything a-OK seems amazing.
---
I got an a-OK scout armor piece that I am struggling to mod (slot specific mod attachment is broken for this armour and you can only get mods from MODUS who only lists three at a time which could be either materials or linings and could be the unattachable linings too) and still feels like fecking Christmas.
---
You can’t scrap them but if you drop them they get destroyed so that’s a good way of getting rid of them
---
I've found that (at least for me), if I notice myself about to spawn into a nuke zone, I have enough time to exit out of the game (through the map, not alt-F4) before I start taking rads.
---
I am not sure how successful it would be on a system with a low network or other lag-inducing situations, but so far it's been OK.  You *do* have to be paying attention when you log in though.
---
I'd greatly prefer not to have the risk though, I'm on board with your suggestion 100%.
---
We've had two and that was it. There are currently no announced plans for any more but it's possible that there will be for some fancy event in the future. It will be announced, im sure. 
---
and xp buffs stacked. I was getting some ridiculous level gains and nukes were going off left and right.
---
yes pls.
---
You also have a bloodied gatling plasma? How many stars and what are the affixes?
---
I had a vendor 5 mins ago where I stuck in a wall. I got fucked up again because of this and then I saw the player put a chair in front of the wall where all the people spawn at his camp. I am just click on the chair sit down and stand up.
---
A really really good idea
---
I'm paranoid because I know they purged like 90% of the cap stash spawns and apparently magazine spawns too.
---
I remember receiving rewards. What they were, I couldn't tell even if my life depended on it. As I said my memory is hazy. Will update when I have retested it though.
---
PvP needs a huge revamp or it will be ignored..  Right now it is nothing more than melee trolls that one shot.  If I wanted to play instagib, I can go back to Unreal Tournament.
---
No not really.
---
A man can't have a panic room which somehow controls the entire house's power? Absolute blasphemy.
---
A bipolar and schizophrenic me will soon be contacting you for a court session.
---
I use a regular gatling plasma, and durability seems about the same. I think I get about 6-7 cores out of it before it needs repair.
---
[50 drops so far](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtrJVYcwz60aokD5QenY6lhMpHgiIyYQQGq_XgKtJz0/edit#gid=783202688).
---
40 x 1\* ranged, none of it were Handmades. 1 Salvaged Assaultron Head that reverted to starless.
---
10 x 3\* ranged, of which 3 x bashing damage, 2 x mutant's explosive, but two interesting weapons: Troubleshooter's Ultracite Gatling Laser with 25% fire rate +1 PER and Zealot's Handmade with 10% aim damage and VATS crit speed.
---
I use the former for the laser challenge (silos). For the latter, I replaced my lvl 35 Zealot's Primed Handmade with it and doing SB/SBQs.
---
Yeah the xp was insane I leveled my lv 15 alt to 52 in like a day and a half
---
Sometimes even non legendaries will yield 2-3 legendaries it’s insane at times and some other days there’s not even one hahah
---
With Cristobal?
---
I'd imagine that things will be a bit late this week since Monday was a holiday
---
With this on:

---
I was having the same problem. I would run in and out in every direction into Morgantown and could not trigger it. I would run through every street and nothing. Feed the people was the only one to trigger. I finally gave up. I would check periodically to see if the event was happening and it finally did.
---
this is the look [https://imgur.com/a/pDURmOy](https://imgur.com/a/pDURmOy)
---
I saw them back at the Grenada theater in Kansas while I was stationed at Fort Riley. This gals tie the roof off of the place!
---
I am always over!!! Always!! I have run around so much there are trails now from where I have been :P
---
&gt;	a "auction house" to sell items, etc.
---
Diablo 3 had this, and they removed it because it broke the game.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_\/¯
---
Lit as fuck. Maybe I should farm the leader bobblehead and wait for the day!
---
Where do I find them? I know I can get the plans from the random encounter but can I just find them somewhere?
---
Oh serious? I did not know that
---
No,  the only guests are in the dumpsters.
---
It's mostly random but there does seem to be some kind of seeding for legendary effects. So in my opinion, it's best to save up your scrip until you see enemies dropping gear with effects you prefer then head over to the purveyor for a shopping spree.
---
You may also want to hang on to any weapons you get with good VATS effects, +50% crit damage in particular. They're fairly sought after for VATS builds so you can probably trade for something good.
---
oh yeah I forgot the first one for survival only..
---
my bad.. twice for survival, once for adventure
---
Akshually... Yesterday I was doing my rounds trying to complete the magazine challenges, I FT-d to The Freak Show and... I was greeted by a 3* Legendary and a Crowned MQ.
---
I was like... WTF?
---
I mean, they still became dinner - and the legendary one dropped not one but two shit 1* legendaries, but still, WTF?
---
Is this intentional or the have yet again dun a doo-doo?
---
Yes that would be much easier and it would prevent exploits making you invulnerable like the bobblehead exploit of December 2018
---
Indeed. Even though fallout 76 succeded in adding multiplayer to fallout,doesn't mean they have to implement everything in it.
---
Next dlc will be fallout 76 forza motorvaultech.
---
Oh I just bought it out of a vending machine course I don't know too where to find one haha sorry for that
---
You should try to tame him and make him your shop bodyguard :)
---
I for a 3* instigating Ultracite laser pistols, scrapped it for Scrip and got a 3* bloodied Ultracite laser lol I was so mad I actually stopped playing for the day.
---
do eeeeeeeet
---
Also equip maxed out ammo smith.
---
It also tends to spawn in the Sons of Dane compound on one of the tables. I've seen it there a few times.
---
The hood looks terrible without a mask. It causes your character to go completely bald and just looks awkward. With a mask and it's lit.
---
I plan to in order to see if it works
---
Unlocked stuff is free to take from, no matter what. Only mobs will attack. Having unlocked purifiers probably makes people more likely to kill the mobs attacking your base. 
---
Does lockpicking a CAMP item result in a bounty though?
---
Yes. Doesn't work.
---
It does not work, it destroys the crops.
---
Nice!!! I have a Dread Cult Priest outfit with just a simple Skull Mask (Atomic Shop), Pastor's Vestments, and he fights with either a Sheepsquach weapon or Deathclaw Gauntlet. What system you on?
---
Bravo, pun-meister.
---
I mostly just hunt legendaries and screws so I can build radium rifles to scrap for mods.
---
Yes! I'm tired of becoming part of a camps foundation or wall. Can we also make sure we spawn outside of a camp so we're not locked inside when the camp owner decides to keep his building locked.
---
Jesus that's alot of weight if those perk cards don't even get you below encumbered...
---
I am always at about 80 pounds out of 230ish (out of power armor, with backpack, only 1 point in STR.)

I carry 1-2 weapons, my armor, a couple thousand rounds, and minimal aid items. I deposit my junk everytime I get to a stash. 
---
What are you doing to have all this poundage?
---
We also have to take into account that E3 is a few weeks away so Bethesda could be going dark.
---
My hate is the "well.. its a decent weapon but I don't use it. I'll roll the dice instead of sell."  
---
hello Ghouls slayer's gamma gun. Is that a plus to fire speed? hell yes!
---
You can’t get perks for all those weapons - why do you need so many? 2 or 3 tops should give you the variety you need for almost all scenarios. Weapons are heavy, yo. 
---
I am an auto rifle build, one of the few builds without a weapon weight reduction perk. I leave the camp at about 170 weight with a max of 280ish. I run the meds/chems weight reduction and strong back. I take A melee weapon, a main rifle and a back up rifle, as well as about 15 grenades. I take all my food (usually too much), about 15 stims, and about 15 water. That’s enough for an hour to 2 hours without having to come back to camp. I leave all junk and miscellaneous items at camp. I carry minimum other chems, like 5-10 each of radx, rad away, paychotats, and medx.
---
I've mostly done the wasteland vending thing of finding interesting things to sell and selling them.  It feels like a number of players must be satiated though, because nothing sells like it used to.
---
When things start to feel routine, I try to throw a wrench in the gears.  You have to invent things for yourself, like changing my character's main weapon or armor loadout and seeing how well I can get by on that.  So, everything kind of flows from there.  Can I run a silo like this?  Can I run the SBQ like this?
---
But what I run into more these days is that the world itself is starting to wear thin.  Part of the problem is that when you're high-level and seeking Legendaries and level-appropriate challenges, you're basically stuck on the east half of the map.  You seldom have a reason to visit the Forest, Toxic Valley, or the Ash Heap.  You fast travel everywhere because there isn't much of a challenge or interest in walking through those areas anymore.
---
I don't know what the best solution to that is.  If prestige literally forced you to go and use low-level gear again, that would be a plus (although my Stash size weeps).  It would be nice if Legendaries scaled to your level, but that could be easily abused... and who would expect a Lv. 6 Wolf to drop a 2\* thing anyway?
---
No, actually I spend 99% of my time in this game CAMP building and have been able to build in areas I wasn’t in the past. 
---
I’ve had a much *much* easier time building/placing a camp, **especially** in pre-existing structures, so really it sound like you’re straight up talking out of your ass right now. 
---
I’ve built in the caddy office of Whitespring
---
I’ve built a CAMP on the highway south of Grafton with dividers and terrain jutting directly through my walls. 
---
My current CAMP is at the south security gate in Whitespring.
---
People would abuse this to make trapper bases.
---
In my tests I was not able to get player planted crops to mutate.
---
That's exactly my point. I just want to get enough distance from the enemy. Not sleep in bed with a skeleton to meet death.
---
THIS! I am tired of people hiding inside the building or forward station and she just flies around not taking much damage.
---
I did this thinking of all the cobalt from my massive mutfruit farm, everything just gets destroyed.
---
Miner miracles quest. Build your excavator armor.
---
I think, more generally, I'd just like to save a handful of character designs so I can mess around without the risk of losing the one I already have.
---
Yeah, I was thinking this too for several the past weeks... The scorched encounters are very boring, because they all look the same and appear awkward holding ranged weapons. There should be more variants. Also been feeling the same about Charred Ghouls. There only seems to be like 3-4 different models of them, but all generally look the same.
---
Just one rifle.
---
Omg I had that happen before. I just want the plastic plates so badly. Not eat lead while sitting.
---
Well damn. Good thing I asked first.
---
Try saying that when you have a scorch beast or high level enemy coming after you.
---
I would rather use a level 15 combat knife and charge the queen than break out a broadsider.
---
What about the Silva Homestead? I heard people have done it before but I thought it was a part of the no fire zone?
---
Thats all. If you read all the notes you found, found all the clues, and read the terminal at the house, it will be a story.
---
A scare story, nothing more.
---
Honestly, none of those things use radiation as a vector, and exposure to low (?) levels of radiation wouldn't introduce an additional vector for the disease to get a foothold.
---
If the game is not giving you an infection from proximity to a disease source *without* radiation, it really doesn't make a lot of sense to have it only trigger when radiation is present.
---
Now, I don't *recall* that I've ever gotten a disease from an infected mob without getting hit, but if that is part of the game as well, I'd say they're being consistent, and that the radiation is irrelevant.  But if not, then OP has a point.
---
I always will, but I also am only on a few hours a week. Since there is no guarantee that I’ll be able to trade stuff in at a later date for “full value” I make sure I max out my earnings every day I’m on.
---
Power armor limits you at times but I don't understand why you couldn't use some benches at times.
---
It does need a lot of work, personally I think there should be more reward but without an equal punishment - like the how the caps thing im Survival was initially too much and has now been nerfed to the point where you gain/lose maybe 25 caps.
---
It'd be nice to have a PvP friendly sub, I 100% understand why many don't enjoy it but most people here are so hostile towards the idea that it very much feels like 'If Reddit doesn't like it, no one else should'.
---
Vendors don’t have script. Only exchange machines do.
---
We need this back. I don't like sleeping with eyes watching me. Paranoia prevents vault dwellers from sleeping.
---
No, they removed it because of the huge backlash about being able to buy items with real money. Auction houses are still in many other games, such as WoW.
---
My attempts at 3* melee have been terrible.
---
3 x bone clubs with +40% swing speed and +15% against scorched and reduced weight. Same damn thing three times on different days.
---
1 rolling pin with +15% against animals, when you are recovering from addiction.
---
1 pool cue that was also for recovering addict and I don't remember the rest.
---
1 combat knife that was +15% against animals, reduced weight and something else.
---
My experience with the vendor has been less than stellar. I shop vendors so I can see what I'm getting now and sell in my camp the ones I pick up in the world for next to nothing. My camp is way up north and plans are 15, mods are 10 and nearly all weapons are right around 150~200 regardless of what's on them.
---
Didn't know that works.
---
Reason number one for me is: in my head cannon, there's no way I'd find all perfect neon letters of the same color. I like to make my neon signs in different colored letters because it looks more scavengy. I can't for the LIFE of me figure out why Bethesda didn't put in the code for the rest of the colors. HOW in the WORLD could that be anything but pure laziness
---
I would say they're not for 'lore reasons' but they added the cryolator to 76 so....
---
I love it, where do you get the hat and outfit?
---
Like a rolling screen sign? Place one sign and hook it up to the terminal to be able to set a 25 character message that scrolls across it?
---
????
---
I have a Vampiric, fastshooting (and maybe limb dmg, or lightwere, do not remember) LMG.
---
Almost a minigun...
---
It's totally random. I made some brief calculations and getting something good from \*\*\* legendary roll is less than 1%.
---
Brief example for ranged 3\*:
---
1st prefix - there are 23 and only 6 are good, which means 26%
---
2nd modifier - there are 7 and 3 from them are good, so 43%
---
3nd modifier - there are 9 and 3 are good, so 33%
---
In the end chances would be 26% \* 43% \* 33% = 4%
---
And this not considering that you can get crappy ranged type weapons like Broadsider, Harpoon Gun, Gamma Gun, .44, etc, also there are crappy combinations even from good prefixes/modifiers like AA VATS VATS plasma gatling for example. So actual chances would be lower. And if you would want something really specific, then "forget about it" chances.
---
Yeah I’m a melee build primarily largely dependent upon my 3*Hunter’s powerfist but this is rapidly becoming my favorite weapon
---
You can't send any in game text communication on the PC.
---
Maintenance doesn't happen every week, it's just that when it happens (outside of emergencies), it happens on Tuesdays.  If there are enough bug fixes in the pipeline that are finished (and I hope to hell that there are), they'll post something in a bit.  If not, we'll get no patch and maybe an Inside the Vault to tide us over.
---
No
---
I didn't see the mailbox. I was trying to scroll around a bit. I don't see data mines except for that one.
---
/r/unexpectedthanos
---
I'll return home in 4 hours. If our paths will cross - I'll gladly visit your camp. 
---
P.S. How do I pinpoint you if you not in my friend list?
---
The severe features, silver hair, and amazing eyeshadow/liner (and the scaaaars). A++ look.
---
Yesterday a supply cargo fell down on my garden.
---
It was empty when I arrived, but its smoke lured some customers to my vending shops... :)
---
&gt;  They should be working on instanced dungeons or something in that direction imo to add things to do in the endgame.
---
They are. The vault raids are in the Nuclear Winter DLC and should be instanced.
---
How do I tell where players will spawn? Is it the same spot where I land upon fast traveling to my own camp?
---
They should count nothing towards the budget
---
Thanks, I'll pass on LMG, although it's tempting :)
---
Like I said to another user I didn't see it because I was scrolling around kinda fast.
---
Wish they’d come back.  I am trying to level my four alts to level 50.   I made my first alt get to level 20 the first weekend, and from 20 to 50 the second weekend.   But it has taken several tedious weeks to get my next alt to level 31.
---
Every day I do Biv’s quest plus the two scout quests. The duplicate plans they give sell really well in my vendor machines. I also open the map occasionally and will do any of the events I see that I know have decent rewards (all of the horde events, leader of the pack, distant thunder etc...) I often will take over a workshop or two mostly just to have some fun building but also to get a free fast travel point and some plans. And of course if a nuke is dropped I head on over to that. Lately I’ve been slowly working on all the possum badge challenges. I also just like to walk around to see what random encounters I get.
---
I’m level 140 with hundreds of hours played and haven’t even finished the main quest line yet (I have yet to go in the Whitesprings bunker.) I am not a min/maxer, I almost never use power armour, I don’t usually sever hop or grind, I level very very slowly, and I’m really not very good. But I have lots of fun.
---
It is mostly the story, which is on the notes. And the reward, of course, which is unique and one can only get it from that quest.
---
Bloodied explosive weapon, max damage perks, adrenal reaction mutation, nerd rage perk, adrenaline, bloody mess, and demo expert
---
Weekly challenge.  do the questionnaire.
---
With cheating questions to avoid random.  10 atoms I see it well because there are no minor fractions.
---
Much better than exams of the scouts and the questions could do M.O.D.U.S for example.  Maybe in their eagerness to improve their systems.
---
Useful to know the opinion of users of future changes as the most recent.  If there are no personalized response fields, it will be easy enough to review the answers through pure statistics.  Another option is to give lots of ammunition to choose.  food / drink, repair kit or simply caps
---
Which house is this terminal in?
---
Danger, danger, danger! Don't get too close to that bloke.
---
I’m not too enthused about it personally but so long as it doesnt have a penalty like Survival where you can actually lose shit for dying, I’ll probably play it a couple times to see if I like it. I’m not a big fan of PvP or Battle Royales so at the moment I feel like I won’t, but you never know. And worst case scenario it’s a completely free update i dont HAVE to play, so like, eh. I’ll just play another game until the Vault raids.
---
You can turn in your legendary items at a special machine located at each train station, in exchange for legendary scrip. Then you can go to the Purveyor at Berkeley station and use the scrip to buy legendary items. It's a gamble though, because you don't actually see what you're buying. You can only choose armor or weapon. And number of stars.
---
My TSE handmade and troubleshooters explosive combat shotgun (for silos) degrade much faster than my other weapons, so I suspect explosive does adversely accelerate degradation, but I don't have data-mining or test-retest style experimental proof.
---
It is going to exist.
---
Sound to me you just answered your own question.
---
The Purveyor has quite a sense of humor at times.
---
I will add that I have done about 25 3* rolls, and did manage to get EE Gatling and EFFR ultracite Laser gatling out of it.     So a 1/10 chance of a useful drop.  Not bad.
---
Going right to left, bottom to top seems to work somewhat
---
Maybe look at the newest bug that is out in the German language where all the names are screwed up and they show the names of all the things coming in the next big patch. It is absolutely a battle royale. Which will give you "overseer points".
---
Those people are going to be sorely disappointed. They'll also be the ones coming on here to make 98 posts about how the magazine racks, bobbleheads, gun mounts, ect. take up so much room in their stash and that we need another 9000 lbs added to out storage capacity or else the game is unplayable
---
Indeed and that's how business works. Compare and shop for the best deals.
---
I myself lower prices over time if it doesn't sell.
---
Thanks all!  Kinda bummed there’s not a mine for steel though.
---
Wendigoing gets the get tough tough shopping
---
Anyone else having trouble placing Neon Letters? Right now it seems impossible to snap a letter BENEATH any other letter. So I'm having to write out my words from the bottom up.
---
Pants were crapped.
---
Scorched and Ghouls both need a revamp in terms of looks and mechanics. As is they just blend together into an undead mishmash of trash mobs. 
---
They need some fresh new looks with attacks, behaviors, and resistances to match. Give us more unique and names enemies! Even it it's just some randomly generated Rare/Unique mobs like Diablo.
---
Your such a turd
---
Where do you find the location os the church. Where the cat is living.
---
Hmmm...
---
How did you started the quest? I read something somewhere, that pointed to a house, with a terminal where I have to find out the password.
---
Man, you must be desperate for negative karma.
---
Smart idea !!
---
I would embrace the shower of meat and rage. It's been ages since I last saw a Big Ole Greenskin.
---
Agree!
---
Check youtube, there are quite a few walkthroughs on there.  If you don't want to spoil the fun, just watch a random one to see what it is you're looking for, but if you want to cut down the time or get really lost trying to find one, they're easily available.
---
I found him too! It was sad as all hell. My friend and I were discussing what we should do about him and even though I thought the best thing to do was leave him, she was going to shoot him anyway so I made it painless. Or at least I think I did.
---
Capturing is a lot more fun (even if you only have them for just that server
---
Buyer pays full price, you lose anything over 25k.
---
Mate your talking about things I don't understand. Where is there a karma system?
---
This happens to me with disturbing frequency too.
---
I remain convinced that the Legendary system contains some logic like "The next X Legendaries will be of this prefix"/"type" which changes based on both quantity and over time.  Legendaries generated within a short time frame of each other may share extremely similar attributes, whereas Legendaries which are staggered out are more likely to be different.
---
I think the Purveyor herself may have complete randomization while you are within the menu, so you don't get the same thing if you make repeated transactions.  But when you step away and come back, she might default back to the above system.
---
I will never forget, back in the day... it was during the BETA it was, and we'd just found our way to the rock arch above the C-bog, set up our first real floating camp. I'd just set down an armor bench when all of a sudden ***boomp!*** ,from the sky, a Sierra Bravo! It fell on my head. I'd only ever seen the one before, that one that flies over your head when you're low level but it never bothers you... 
---
Scared the living bejesus out of me. Now those critters fall from the skies all over the place and people are used to it but back then, we didn't know what it was. Sure made for some interesting photos though.
---
And that attitude is what ruined workshops. They were fun before someone could stand slightly outside the circle when they saw you approaching to avoid an attack, wait for their friends, prepare fully, then gang rush the lone attacker.
---
Also, for a game design student, you don't seem to understand a lot of the choices Bethesda made. Elevators, Vendors, etc.
---
Those are the most important times to keep u shit together :P
---
Agreed,  that or they just need to level gate any nuke zone that triggers scorched earth to level 75+
---
It's their opinion though? They are aloud to express that, even if you disagree.
---
Yup.  Anything that starts an animation will pull you out.  Chair, bed, cooking station, workbench...just put something nearby players can click and get unstuck.  
---
I put my buildings off to the side of where I initially put my CAMP station down to try and minimize problems.
---
That was very vague, please expand.
---
and a sliver of health....
---
yeah, agreed, but theyd probably have to lower the spawn rate of 3\*s...which im ok with. I hate fighting a tons of enemies with a 3\* in there, only to get a 1\* wood armor or other crap. It should be exactly like the purv. you pay for a 3\* and get one...even if its junk,
---
That's honestly a brilliant idea. Not sure if it would be difficult to implement in-game but it would certainly serve as an incentive to build the terminal in your came and use it in addition to allowing proper feedback from actual players. Only question is whether they'd allow players to fully type out responses or have feedback polls/multiple choice responses.
---
And that's the sale price.
---
It's to do with the polygon count sadly.
---
Well I guess I wanted it yesterday is my point. :P
---
That’s a very rude way of saying “it’s not my problem” 😄
---
I think you are the idiot buddy
---
Why limit it to one type? 
---
We could get static signs - just make it look like a old rusted sign and you can type some stuf in there and it would use the font for the sign.
---
We could get an electronic scrolling marque, we could also get signs that have the letters flip so it could display a few messages.  
---
We could use the terminal or we could just modify the actual sign
---
I do have a room like that (a bathroom) for when I am staying on a server and allow people to come up while keeping my stuff safe....but sometimes it's just quicker (I get lazy) to drop it by my benches while I work.
---
Not for nothing but some of the "crappy" drops listed from the purveyor are actually pretty good if you have the build for it... I really hope that suggestion of allowing you to change perk layouts between preset groups happens. That could make a lot of these more viable to more people.
---
I'm pretty sure I understood that but I'm gonna ask anyway... so the workshops come with some mats included when you claim it? And in the build menu mats that came with it are displayed in green, and mats you scavenged and scrapped for are in white.. that correct?
---
The Mod gives you an extra 60 carry weight. If you deep pocket all your armor you'll carry 405 with marsupial perk. Another 40 with the carry perk card and even more with other perk cards..
---
Until you want to complete it for a challenge and then it just shuts down completely.
---
Damn you Steelheart!
---
I agree that they are currently empty, I'm just saying that if they do open it up, that could be an option they go for.
---
I don't even remember seeing one in fallout76 yet.
---
So I scrapped my old camera but cant get a new one. I need the Broken Camera off the tourist again but when I find the dead tourist it's inventory is empty for me.  
---
What did you do?
---
The only one which can screw me up is Glowing Pustules.  It's nasty for low-health setups.
---
That took me a minute to figure that out, very clever!
---
Create a new character with big eyes and take selfie. Go out Vault 76 and take another selfie. Post both photos here.
---
Has not been back since
---
I suspect the numbers you have been seeing are due to the adrenal reaction mutation (more damage the lower your health), the bloodied legendary effect on the weapon, the perk Nerd Rage (again more damage at low health). The perk adrenaline will also increase damage with each enemy you hit in quick succession. If it’s melee then twisted muscles and talons mutations increase melee and unarmed damage respectively and also with melee the armour mods weighted and brawling on arms will up the damage numbers. I have a bloodied pole hook that does around 700-750 damage due to adrenal reaction, nerd rage, my health being 20% and one of my arms being weighted. That’s before any adrenaline bonuses, and would also be more if I had twisted muscles. Low health builds do a lot of damage but you do die a lot, great fun though
---
I just no longer bother.  I pick a spot nearby and walk the rest of the way.  But yes, they need to fix that.
---
Did you steal someone's teddy bear again?
---
Thank you. I'm getting tired with all the "my way is THE way" shit
---
I have the exact same rifle hanging above my fireplace
---
Even if 8 out of ten times I can play for hours with no lag or glitches normal play?
---
Signs could also have potential issues, when the game makes the decision to place the sign, it would have to call the database that stores basically the camp layout. 
---
It would find the XYZ coordinates and then place the sign, it would then have to find what the sign was supposed to say (may be a delay in the sign appearing and then the sign displaying it's message).  
---
Similar to the issue with letters, if there were too many signs, it would then have to queue up the calls to get the messages for each sign, though at least the camp had rendered at that point.  
---
So even then, there could be needs to have limitations on the signs because of the game engine.
---
While I tend to hold the view of 'play how you want, but don't complain about the restrictions/requirements for that style', I suggest only carrying 2-3 weapons (at most) and scrapping/selling anything you don't immediately need or have plans for using. Additionally, invest in the Bandoleer, Pack Rat, Strong Back, Thru-Hiker, and Traveling Pharmacy if you *absolutely need to carry everything*. Oh and make sure you're not carrying a ton of Mini Nukes, Missiles, Railway Spikes or other heavy ammo. Also, check to make sure you're not unintentionally carrying a bunch of gunpowder and ore. That stuff doesn't automatically transfer to the stash for some reason and can easily build up.
---
Don't do it. It doesn't work. Also there is a youtuber and his team, that already tried and nuked almost all of Appalachia.
---
Rifle gaming, check him out.
---
I guess you're right. I was thinking it would count each craft all session as one instance of crafting. So you could have a batch of 100 items and if it procs you get an additional 30 or none extra at all. But I'm not versed on how they do the calcs so eh.
---
No, I tried to spell both “chill zone” and simply “electric” in my camp, and sadly I had trouble with both of those. The only one where I didn’t is when I put ME spelled out above a vault boy statue. I got laughs from some customers, though
---
Switch servers and/or restart the game.
---
While it's true that Legendaries will regenerate HP once, yesterday I came across the HP bug where an enemy that takes too much damage too quickly will magically restore that HP, and once it gets down to about 5%, it simply refuses to budge any further.  I had to swap to a different weapon (melee) to finish them off.  For a time, this was downright consistent with my Gatling Gun.
---
This is exactly why I don't have vending machines at my Main Camp, there are a lot of High level spawns nearby and players tend to take refuge at my Camp while the Mirelurk Queen &amp; SBs lay waste to the place.
---
I keep my Vendor characters in low level areas so it's not a problem for them, and they are always at their Camp.
---
I definitely have noti8this a lot more after the past couple updates so I started keeping track this weekend.  I killed 21 3* legendary enemies this weekend,  I got 3 - 3* drops,  5 - 2* drops and the rest were 1* drops. That includes the 3* rolling pin I got from the sbq, which as luck would have it was instigating, +limb damage, and +1 strength. Had that been any of the swords I would have been stoked.
---
Maybe in the future
---
Also my overseer quest is just showing follow the overseers clues and not giving me any direction
---
The wifi signal is strong to the laptop, I could almost pick it up on the ps4 itself but the ps4 doesn't pick up as good. It's a lot weaker. Thats why I was using the laptop to extend it I guess you can call it
---
you have to get certain mutations and perks like adrenaline junkie, nerd rage, etc. and keep your life below 20% hp and all you weapons  will get a boost.
---
I started the quest as simply walking down there. I was on my way to get a radroach meat for the daily quest. I fast traveled to the bunker called Raleigh Clay's Bunker and walked toward the location and I found the church. And it told me to go down there.
---
nope, I just stopped playing... Small things like this is what makes games like these unplayable..
---
Try the lake SW of the monorail elevator (also just S-SE  is another one), *relatively* flat, at least the SW one, and both are pretty quiet areas.
---
It's just west of Ft. Defiance if you don't have it discovered.  I seriously considered that location on more than one occasion, and it's on my short list if I ever relocate from where I'm at now.
---
Supposedly theres one up north above the mire but I'm level 100 and I've never seen one
---
I'd still point at the network, try and find some background app that can log your network through flow so when your game bugs out you'll have some idea if a drop in connectivity coincides.
---
You may be right and it is BGS servers throwing a wobbly but you'll need to identify the possible cause, only you can do this.
---
Good luck.
---
Was it by point pleasant or the winding path? A youtuber recently nuked thise areas to see what would have happened
---
Helvetia. In the museum.
---
Yeah I guess it's the troubles with it really as it'll always be exploitable in some way. It's why I'd like some actual dedicated maps for it, a tighter more focused mode like that would allow Bethesda to have a lot of extra control over it.
---
I've seen large groups of super mutants lately.  I was doing dropped connection in the bog and there were about thirty of them.  It didn't go well for me or the guy who's camp was nearby.
---
He asked about damage not survivability.
---
They arent looting if they are unlocked. It will be fine.
---
Chr/Philanthropist and Chr/Happy camper can help with feeding your children and keeping them well fed while you build. Add in Chr/Team medic and there’s no longer a need to transfer any aid items unless of course they dare venture off on their own.
---
Then you missed a half of it :(
---
Yes there is one in ine of the twin lakes to the east of white springs my base is up the hill from him he has his head in the water all you see is his cart on his back. He won't engage unless you do first he's normally a level 80 or 60. I like to go fuck with him after drinking Nukashine lol.
---
I did that all the time during Belly of the Beast. Tried mining Ultracite, drank highly irradiated water 😂
---
I agree here - don't shoot for the stars right off the bat. Get a solid 2* gun as fast as you can, then use that to grind for the perfect weapon. If you get some bad RNG, you could be looking at a long time to get that great 3*, and you don't want to be doing that with what POS gun you naturally found at level 35. 
---
At least that's the case with me and my 1* lvl 35 handmade I'm still using at level 80.
---
Nice, well if you ever feel like swapping it out for something else then I'd be glad to take it off your hands.
---
In my experience, weapons are easier to come by than armor sets. You can find pretty good 2* for relatively cheap. I look at it like this: every 2 days I can get five 3* armor or three 3* weapons. Weapons being 40% more expensive, I'll take armor literally every time, as good armor sets are very difficult to build. You can probably find a TSE Handmade on this Reddit for 2k or less
---
The actual leader of the pack was surrounded with 6 or 7 wolves. Also they were fighting with 3 feral ghouls and 3 stingwing. And before I encountered this, I had to kill 6 mongrels. All dead in two minutes.
---
A massive horde of ghouls spawned at Point Pleasent for me once. It was insane. Probably 30-40 all at once, maybe. I was over lvl 100 and for moment they had be cornered. Scary stuff
---
Ahhh! This happened to me two days ago and even though I was out of the blast radius (barely), my entire CAMP was obliterated, along with myself. 
---
It was a sweet animation and I had loads of junk I had to get rid of anyways so I guess it was worth the experience.
---
I had a Vampiric Combat Shot gun in my vendor the other day, but it sold.  They do exist though.  If I ever get another I will save it for you.
---
*has a mass horde of charred bloated ghouls coming after you while in a small room*
---
You can find them in Whitesprings every once in a while
---
i have a vamp minigun with damage while aiming and damage resistance while aiming, how much would you offer for it?
---
I've had better luck purchasing 2* Weapons (2 Eplosive weapons and a 2-Shot Rapid Ultracite Gatling) and 3* Armor (Bolstering Mutant's Urban etc). I only buy a 3* Weapon when I really wanna splurge.
---
There*
---
It'd be handy when you are out scavenging and don't have a place to scrap your junk immediately, but seriously, how much trash do you really need to carry around at any given time?
---
He's so cuuuutttttteeee O.o
---
No doubt.
---
I just don't see arbitrary placement being a thing, given how the game already struggles to deal with elaborate CAMPs.  Certain CAMPs are still the one reliable thing which drag my framerate down.
---
Although, in the interest of player vending, I wouldn't mind if they just topped it off at 1000 and called it a day.  Prestige could throw a wrench in those gears too, because you conceivably wouldn't just be holding onto Lv. 45/50 gear.  You'd want to have great stuff at various levels.
---
At least some events scale depending on the number of participants. Line in the sand (fort defiance) is the one I’ve seen the largest mobs at so far.
---
The ts exploding procs twice. A ts handmade does 155 with the tuned receiver (this is better than hardened imo). Demo adds close to 500 extra damage a clip. Works out good in arktos too because with gunsmith, I usually end up a bit over repaired after a run.
---
Solo'd arktos last night with 0 demo expert. It's from repairing and forgetting to replace the perks. My gun broke from 200%. It's anemic without demo expert and the endangerol syringer. With demo I shoot around 300-400 556 a run. Instigating handmade for the first part of the run, the ts is used pretty much for the boss.
---
Of course bloodied is another story, does more damage than all. Problem is you tend to keel over down there at least once with low health. That doesn't work well if you're trying to get the diffuser.
---
I can't explain the vendors, however the elevators I can!
---
The majority (if not all) of the elevators that used closed doors where in fact loading screens, they simply tricked the player into feeling like they were not.
---
Basically you get in the elevator and press the floor button, door closes and it transitions to an elevator level, unloading what needs to be unloaded and loading in whatever needed to be loaded for wherever you were going. This is why the elevator ride length is not consistent, sometimes it loads quickly, sometimes it takes a bit.
---
That's the way the quest goes. You just have to find all her holotapes. You can check your progress on which ones you need in the challenges menu. It's a pain but when you get near one it highlights on you HUD
---
Hahaha hell yeah!
---
ive thought about this before, but buying a new console and account is really a bit much for a game that im not sure how long ill keep playing.  Im not really into the cosmetic aspect of the game ie building special CAMPS and wearing special clothes.
---
I'll keep my eyes peeled at Vendors too then, thank you!
---
Wendigoingets tough the tough get shopping
---
Had my camp directly nuked the other day, in the mountains near Whitespring, felt nice to get the attention
---
Inside of Garrahan Miing HQ, right next to where you can register excavator armour, there's a room with a bunch of iron deposits.
---
i made a new character and was exploring. found that cattle herding event near the farm and decided my lvl 20 person could ring a bell at some lazy cows. when i finally get near the farm a lvl 50 legendary sheepsquatch showsup and one shots my cows then trapped me in a busted shack for a good 30 minutes while i plunked away at his face with my lvl 10-15 guns. i probably spent over 1000 caps in ammo and way more in stimpacks. the entire time i was inviting these 2 people who were within reasonable distance to me hoping they'd understand but they didnt. 
---
i really really wish i couldve sent a message asking for help
---
If that’s what you want to call me.
---
I did get a Vampiric Combat Shotgun but sadly it was level 35. Wound up scrapping it for script. Luckily that script put me just over the amount I needed to roll a 2-Shot Rapid Ultracite Gatling Laser. That's a fun beastie, let me tell ya.
---
I tried an Instigating Sniper Rifle and I seem to have better results from Bloodied.
---
I do wish that I had a "target dummy" though, so I could see the actual damage done.
---
The clues are in the holotapes, notes, and terminals along the way to where you are now.
---
BGS not giving a f\*&amp;k in 
---
3...2...1
---
:(
---
I'll take em
---
Yup, which is exactly how I imagined the workshop function to be like in this game but instead we just have a couple dozen junk plants that are hardly cost effective.   
---
It would be so badass to convert pre-exsisting locations into habitable spots (rebuilding America) but I understand that's impossible with a live/multiplayer game where everyone is on a different scale.
---
Yeah, of course there would still be a limit on signs, too, but you would be able to spell a word without it cutting you off after just three or four, depending on your camp size. 
---
It also most likely wouldn’t even need to make it that intense on the resources the servers have, because its literally just a word. But I’m not a game designer and I don’t know how stuff like this is done, so sorry if I’m being an idiot. I just feel strongly about freedom of camp decoration lmao
---
Maybe the title could be more specific. Playing Fallout 76 in power armor on a LG OLED will cause burn in to happen quite fast and I looks like it also could be permanent. But this would be quite long and not to the point. (Imagine the long warning on packs of cigarettes, if we had to be so specific all the time) I don't blame the game and I never said it was a problem with the game. Nonetheless, I think I made myself perfectly clear. You finding this confusing says more about you than about me.
---
I was arguing the opposite, tokens may be lame, but RNGeezus is worse.  Especially when it works from a crap table.
---
doing the daily vendoring (regular and legendary), hop around player camps in search of plans i dont know or other good deals, make a few trades using the trading subreddit, and stay AFK so people can buy stuff from my vending machines.
---
about once a week i also go around and dig the treasure maps i have a lot of
---
If you launch a nuke on an npc farm all the crops you can plant such as corn or razor grain are destroyed but the ones you cant plant all become nuked flora. At least that how it has worked for me.
---
Log in
---
Get my daily 150 script and 1400 caps
---
Visit every player vendor in the server looking for a good items/building ideas/.308 ammo
---
Swap servers, repeat 
---
Ever week or two I might build somewhere new so the rest of my time goes to building
---
So take the Whitespring for example, every time I go up a floor I always have a dip in performance. But yeah when I go in the elevator I don't. Okay I totally understand that now. :)
---
This 100% needs to be looked at
---
Yeah I know that. What I mean by that is that if they advertise it as they did with The Burrows and Project Paradise...I dont know what to expect... The Burrows was a plain disappointment for me, I mean in 10min i've done this solo and never touched it again except for a nuke or two. Project Paradise was more challenging and actually made me actually want to farm this event. The design of both is gorgeous btw, but the content is limited in my opinion...
---
E3
---
Please post your build via one of the build web sites’ links. Nukes and dragons will allow you to fill in many other details that we would need to give you more specific advice (mutations for example).
---
L90, still haven't launched a nuke (just got access to the bunker a couple days ago), have more than a screen full of incomplete quests.
---
  So I roam place to place completing unfinished quests (and picking up new ones in the process), feeding my hoarding habit, farming for better weapons, toying with new weapons, joining events if they happen to pop up nearby, and killing most everything that gets in my way.
---
Well, users need to make sure their litle CAMP device is outside of their building since that's the spawn point, or at least where I've been spawning, recently. 
---
This would be a hard fix for Bethesda, though since it would require them to almost randomize the spawn location within 10-15 units from the CAMP device which could very well lead you in a stuck location, as well.
---
How can I troll my friends then by filling their camp budget by making a thousand of small letter in some hidden place?
---
Really? That's surprising, one wold think they would release it and make some money.
---
The void
---
But then people would spam and ruin the game for everyone, because there’s always at least one person like that in every community
---
less than that. Played 3 days about 10 hours each day straight got 1 3 star drop. killed like 50 3 stars
---
Fickle reddit is fickle  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Vendors have to be separate unlike destiny due to shared inventory. If a player sells a legendary, you can come in behind them and buy it. Or imagine you are looking at an item you want and it magically leaves the inventory because someone else bought it while you were deciding.
---
I see bobblehead tables, magazine racks (and it will be limited to I bet less than enough to actually display every magazine at the same time), gun racks (limit maybe 5), armor stands  (limit 2 or 3), power armor display (1 or 2) and maybe a teddy bear stand and nuka cola display. And that's it. 
---
And all of that will take up silly amounts of space on your CAMP budget. 
---
Expecting literally anything else is inviting heavy disappointment. And if they do more like pre-stacked shelves than great, I'll be pleasantly surprised.
---
Definitely if I had a lazy 10k around, not wearable .... there would be no question I’m putting it on
---
Damn, that’s too bad. Why don’t you use it just as decoration?
---
Lol I thought that might’ve been what happened because I had just killed one and then fast travelled to my camp.
---
Let's keep voting this up to get more visibility
---
Yeah looking at that now I understand. Damn I don't rate the share inventory
---
Some bored millionaire.
---
Burrows wasnt really challenging, the toughest things in there were the M.Gutsy. and the "boss" was just a assaultron
---
Hopefully in winter
---
It's no easy. Remember, you still can teleport to a cliff and fall to death. I think the best workaround for Bethesda could be show where is the fast travel point in the WS mode and when you place the C.A.M.P. It don't need be movable, just visible.
---
Ahhhh the level 40 TSE combat shotgun haha funny to see they are still around. Those things rained from the sky along time ago
---
Throwing around insults is a waste of time. 
---
There are lots of good places that don’t have enemy spawns. So all you have to deal with is the random enemies that attack your camp, which (depending on the location) usually only spawn in one or two spots, meaning you can use turrets to kill them automatically. Location also determines what kind of enemies attack. 
---
I used to have a camp placed near water and a junk extractor in the Mire. Giant frogs spawned under my house constantly, and super mutants would shoot down at everything from the trees. It was horrible. Then I moved down to the next junk extractor in the Mire, and all I get are low level robots occasionally. Same exact setup, but so much less of a hassle. Less frog omelettes though. 
---
Obviously people should just kill the mobs. But some people won’t. So if you want your base to be a really good shop, put it somewhere with minimal enemy spawns. That’s all you can really do about it. It’s what I did, and it’s working for me.
---
Yes. And you can't store the green in your own inventory. I use more turrets in workshops because I don't have to "pay" for them.
---
Oh man that tip is going to save my sanity. I wasn't sure if I had found them all and it just permanently says that or what. I mean I've explored almost every location on the map or at least cruised by it, so I would have seen the tag pop up on the HUD. 
---
I'm going to find the rest of those buggers today!
---
Also I've noticed that posts containing a lot of text need plenty on punctuation and plentiful use of paragraphs otherwise you'll be down voted just because, I'm guessing, people can't be bothered to read it and down vote to show there frustration.
---
Split long posts up carefully and place a TL:DR at the beginning summarizing the main points of your post.
---
I have to remove a portion of my roof to free players who FT into my camp because the spawn point is in my utility room which has no exit or windows. And if they don’t jump out right away and they let the building load in completely, they can barely turn to the left or right or even jump because it’s wall to wall items. It’s the only spot in my camp like that, so...of course that’s the spawn point. Not great for business lol “Welcome to my shop, let me open the roof. I hope you are able to jump high enough to exit.”
---
heres the road map: [https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/57rzdd8RrXf5hNuIF3ofZJ/5e77803a3f8a7c43259a1b1f672ec2ff/Fallout76\_RoadMap\_2018\_02-21\_FINAL.PNG](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/57rzdd8RrXf5hNuIF3ofZJ/5e77803a3f8a7c43259a1b1f672ec2ff/Fallout76_RoadMap_2018_02-21_FINAL.PNG)
---
If you're good at hip fire, use open sights probably furious. It has the perf mag. If you need more aa, you can use a syringer.
---
they need to fix this...its really taking fun out of the game...even if its shit, I want a legit 3\* drop and that goes for 2\* as well. I think there are enough possibilities that they dont need to worry about in game economy.
---
for ALL the hours ive played...I got two great rolls...a lvl 35 BE lever and an unyielding Sent AP chest piece.
---
It may or may not help, but have you done most of the quests for Rose? You can't access the third floor until a certain point in those quests.
---
Still shouldn't crash, though.
---
I agree! Same with other activities , I died the other day from accidentally sleeping while being attacked by a pack of ghouls
---
I’m guessing they’ll have an announcement and trailer at E3, with the next batch of updates beginning in the last couple weeks of June
---
That did it! Thanks, as now I’m jumping off Seneca Rocks like the happiest idiot in the world. :)
---
Cheap garbage for people without real jobs.  I'm having a working X-01 suit (with jetpack and calibrated shocks) built to fit me specifically.  Granted, my beer belly will make it look a bit silly but...
---
Yeah I used to be in set 5 English lmao and I still did better than most of the higher sets. Set 5 is the very bottom one by the way.
---
my new samsung tv keeps shutting off during the game too but comes back on in about 20 seconds
---
Did you still get the mounted wendigo?
---
Yay 500 extra damage on th WHOLE clip... i hope you aren’t using a drum mag. What you just said proves that demo expert is trash numbers don’t lie bro
---
Lol that's what I was thinking. Some people 10k maybe ok
---
1 hour won't be enough your first time.  You are allotted 30 minutes to fight the SBQ, and depending on your lack of luck, it might actually take that long.  And the silo itself is a tricky thing, especially now, because the turrets seem more likely to respawn due to fewer players running silos now.  Your first time through the silo could easily take an hour.
---
Some other suggestions I have in addition to yours:
---
* Look around the map before you begin and make sure that high-level players exist.  If there are mostly Lv. 80s and below, you're going to have a difficult time.  Look for anyone around Lv. 120 and above.
---
* Bring more than one Nuclear Keycard, in case you flub up the code entry.  The code is processed when you enter the last digit - you get no confirmation step - so double check before you do.
---
* Place your nuke so it hits Fissure Site Prime (it will blink when it's in the blast radius), but excludes Drop Site V9.  Most players will fast travel to Drop Site V9.  The SBQ will be lured out of the blast radius and into non-radiated space, where melee (especially Bloodied melee) can do the most damage.
---
* There is a workbench against the shed to the west of Drop Site V9 where you can scrap things if you find yourself over-encumbered.
---
As far as perks, that's going to depend a lot on your build.  If you do it in Power Armor, you don't have to worry too much about survivability, but you also won't be dealing the best damage you can do.  If you don't have Power Armor, know that the SBQ kicks out a constant amount of fairly heavy radiation.  You'll need rad resist of about 100 to counter it for melee, no matter how you accomplish this (Rad-X, lead-lined armor, underarmor, etc).  Otherwise, you'll need to periodically back off and use a RadAway.
---
The first time will be the roughest.  Don't be too surprised if you fail.  But after you go through the process once, it gets a lot easier.  All the silos are the same and it's going to take a little experimentation to figure out what setup works best for you against the SBQ.
---
I had the SBQ meet me in Watoga after running back to sell stuff!
---
But at higher levels, diseases aren't that difficult to cope with unless they are affecting weapon accuracy.  
---
As for trying to mitigate radiation, you can always add the perk where radiation heals.
---
My homie and I have the same find, we take great enjoyment finding the bears and sharing our discoveries
---
Get the plan from a vendor and build/scrap 'em.
---
I'm not sure it passes though, you can read it fine if you read left to right (except for the vertical piece which you can still read fine)
---
I can do it for you when I'm on tonight (8-9 hours from the time of this post). Send me an invite and a message later so I don't forget. Ign is the same as my name here.
---
I tend to sell lots of ammo, junk and plans, maybe because I sell  them on the cheap. Weapons and armor, that's a guess for me. I'll price it, if it sells, great, if not, I'll lower it, if it doesn't sell then, I'll use it for script. I tend to price low (I think), to keep my inventory moving.
---
for me it kinda depends on the rarity. like poison sheepsquatch staff plan i wouldnt sell at the games suggested value.
---
Could be part of the quest. Bethesda dropped clues in game to point us toward it. (The orange Vault Tec box south of Morgantown. ) But I found 51 on accident looking for something else up there. (Firefly habitat).
---
Doesn't matter. Just no.
---
:) Your English is fine, just make it easier for people to read on this Reddit forum, i find reading blocks of text very difficult on a monitor, if it's broken up into smaller parts it becomes easier.
---
Have you ever had someone follow you around begging you to lower prices on an item, and complaining that the item isn't worth that much, and then getting indignant when you don't?
---
To nuke the other zones and FOR SCIENCE
---
Over the whole fight that's good damage. The tuned receiver let's you unload it all quick. It's good dps- I mean I've seen a bloodied level 600 keel over and do less damage while I'm there. I know they don't know what they're doing, but it's decent dps.
---
Placing PA sometimes works as well. I’ve had to use it to get unstuck a few times.
---
Interesting
---
Gotta roll those 3's on a VATS build.
---
Yeah I won't defend the texture choice itself - just that the workflow makes sense.
---
Vampiric Flamer is amazing
---
We were playing when one of our friend's sound messed up. he could hear the game, and talk, but not hear any of us. I put my Discord invite on the wall for him, but had to scrap a few things in the camp to do it. Pretty annoying for such a short message. Even with the small letters.
---
I placed a banjo near the spawn location. Still can be a problem if one is wearing power armor.
---
You can send messages to other player already.
---
No, mine is in the Cranberry Bog. Maybe half a mile from Watoga, close to the Grove.
---
Yeah but your definition of "something good" is a god roll where all 3 are ideal. On the bright side, you're almost guaranteed to get at least one legendary effect you can use.
---
It's the weapon type that drags things down. We should be able to chose between rifle, pistol, auto, energy, heavy.
---
Maybe because I am only level 30 or maybe I just found the right spot. The lounge behind the tennis court has them. They were all level 48 and 65+ so took a lot of try’s. Thank god q12345678 came along like level 200 and gave me a bunch of stems and helped me kill them. He help me gain 2 levels in like 20 minutes because we would wait for me to hit them once before he smashed through them giving me do credit.
---
Yes, but disease cures are do common and easy to get, you easily cure the most irritating ones. I swoim in DCs, selling them cheaper in vendor machine
---
I'm bloodied so don't mind so much, but sometimes it takes me 'way too min' and I find myself floating face down in a glowing puddle :(
---
This is how I sell stuff, too.
---
One of my characters sells toys and candy.
---
Another only sells hides, leather goods and repaired tools.
---
That's also an awesome idea!
---
That damn bash roll...
---
I'd rather I got attention by people buying my Vending plans.
---
THANK YOU!!
---
Obliterated vs. decimated, OP knows the correct usage.
---
Lightbox lights also seem to not snap from the bottom either
---
Damn, that sleep animation is so slowwwww, try to avoid picking anything up near a bed but get caught out sometimes regardless.
---
I've gotten 3 3\* handmades with decent effects, and a few more with useless ones. What I really want is a hunting rifle, but I haven't found any, anywhere.
---
plans i dont know and legendaries that are worth much more than they're listed for
---
Players are gonna get so much raw fertilizer mailed to them.
---
Yes, I found a 3* sledgehammer a few days ago!
---
I have heard the grove is a decent place to nuke
---
I do not run with mutations, and have a total of +20% damage, +rank 1 better spread and accuracy,  and + rank 1 decreased Lbs/increased reload perk cards for shotguns My build is largely VATS based w/rank 3 Concentrated Fire; I've tried these weapons both using it and free aim. Even w/95% VATS accuracy I'm having to multi-shot even low LvL enemies.
---
I get it. Just noticed the fact that its wood and wanted to share :p
---
\*Can we get a working Nuka Cola machine
---
Based on my test it is not affected. I will have to get a black powder pistol and test as well. But based upon what I have done it is not affected by the gunsmith perk.
---
No. The "pet" system in ESO is so jarring and environment breaking... having pet-followers turns every online game into Dr. Doolittle's Travelling Menagerie. I hate it.
---
The bases take so long to load in on my game that I have plenty of opportunity to just jump out of the way in any random direction. Worked every time but once where I jumped right into someone's wall as it loaded in
---
This happens to me ALL the time.
---
If you come across a random encounter creature that should be tameable but it won’t work. You either have to put its health very low or go right up to it, then the tame option shows
---
Toxic Waste had always randomly spawned herds of Stags. I used to regularly see them when heading for the hidden Alien Blaster. Now they are not always in same location but move around TW depending on the server.
---
The game undervalues items like Legendaries—it doesn’t account for their rarity or their effects—while wildly overvaluing items like ammo. Plans seem to be pretty well priced, but not always. 
---
Good rules of thumb that I follow, do as you like of course: 
---
No ammo regular ammo is worth more than 1 cap per round. People buy it by the hundreds and thousands, bumping it any higher is unrealistic. 
---
Plans sell well at half face value. It’s hard to know which ones are really rare at this point, so that’s what I do. 
---
Bulk junk, roughly 25% of face value. Individual scrap, 1-2 caps per piece. Same with aid/chems. 
---
Legendaries are up in the air. Most aren’t worth more than a few hundred, but the really desirable ones will sell for thousands. To me, it’s all imaginary money, so I don’t worry too much about it. I try to pick a price I think is reasonable and if it doesn’t move, eventually it gets scrapped.
---
I have never seen a single behemoth. Or a Flatwoods monster. Seen everything else though
---
Not on pc
---
I could believe that.)
---
My game name is RedPy
---
I had to kill three MQ at the same time the other day.
---
Its a statue.
---
This would be nice. I keep 3 serums on me to sell to vendor for daily caps, and last week I accidentally ingested one...and of course, while using RadAway to remove it, it was the last of 5 mutations to be removed. Royal pain in the ass to find them all again! I'm glad I've almost completed my serum recipe set now.
---
Good to know. Thanks. 🙂
---
This is the canonical reason for those crashed military satellites you can find.
---
I love this idea. I really hope they implement it
---
Ive seen 3 flatwoods and no behemoths
---
It’s where the “camp unit” is initially placed (smack bang in the middle of the build circle)
---
3k caps.
---
The fake one is part of the Encryptid event and is named Imposter Sheepsquatch
---
Furious adds 5% per shot and caps at 50%. Useful for spongy targets who take more than a handful of hits. 
---
AA effectively adds 28.9% due to the calculation between DR and damage dealt. 
---
So furious out-damages AA once you’re 6 shots in for a +30% boost. Good for big enemies with larger health pools.
---
For general mob use AA is better. But furious is still solid if you have that instead.
---
I usually do 3 star range weapons simply because I love  randomly rolling for that lucky item. I've netted two great explosive guns from it so far so I'll keep at getting three free legendaries every two days.
---
Yes absolutely. Forgot that.
---
I'm doin this and I can stroll around with 1 strength and no power armor and no backpack and just pick up occasional junk. More then enough to craft 1500 bullets once in a while.
---
😂😂😂
---
You lose it I felt like a dick but I had to server hop recently because I went from 9k to 24k someone was buying up all my legendary stuff now I only sell enough items to bring me to 23k it's a pain to manage but you won't lose caps.
---
Line in the sand awards 2 full cores on completion.
---
Talk to the park manager at Camden and complete his quest.  That will give 1, plus there can be up t 4 more there. 
---
(PA spawn, 2x generators, and 1 in an ammo can.)
---
Before Arktos became an event area, it could have up to 5.
---
I sell cores in my machine @ 1c per percent of charge.  I think the ones in there now are 60-65%.  
---
I'm in PA full time, and walk everywhere.  A 60% core lasts me (at least) 12 hours real time.
---
My understanding of AA is that it is multiplicative with the magazine effects. So you ignore half the armor, then whatever % of what is left with the mag effect—which I think is 40% with the best one. 
---
As such, I like furious. I get that damage boost along with the armor piercing from the magazine. It at least seems like this combo is better than AA on its own, though I’m not calculating at any exact level.
---
Fixed in patch 9.5
---
Benefit of 100% PA play.  No drink or sleep animations ever :)
---
That's not a bad idea.
---
I'll add ya tonight 👍
---
I can understand 3\* dropping 2\* items as there doesn't seem to be 2\* legendary enemies in the game (I have yet to see one).  
---
I would be fine if they reduced the frequency of 3\* legendaries appearing if they always dropped something 2\* or 3\*
---
(or even better, introduce the 2\* enemies and make it so 3\* Always drop 3\* loot)
---
Let's do ittttt, add me, RedPy
---
Never happened before that I have seen, except for the Scorchbeast Event, but mine is well away from there.
---
A pattern is emerging?
---
I have only encountered this before with SBs on freshly restarted servers - is not unusual to find 'flocks' (or whatever the collective noun for bats is) of them after a patch is rolled out and all the servers are freshly brought back online - but not other type of 'big beasties'.
---
Most certainly not two MQs this far from their 'natural breeding grounds'.
---
It smells to bantha fodder to me.
---
Add meeee
---
I have nothing to write with them.
---
Sounds good, I'll add tonight. My name in game is RedPy
---
can you do 4k? i can settle for 3.5k if you dont, but 3k feels a bit too low
---
I got anti-armor explosive shotgun yesterday, sold it for a niec amoutn of caps.
---
Send me a request, I'll accept
---
Theres a thoughtful vault dweller for ya
---
This is what makes it fun, in my opinion. I yard sale for hours!
---
Im done convincing you have fun with demo expert while i kill the alpha in 3 clips
---
This may sound cruel but....
---
If I get stuck in the floor and teh owner hasnt placed anythign nearby to allow me to pull myself up I usually just stay there and let the mobs that spawn run rampant and wreak their camp
---
I’m online rn, GT MeltedAppetite :)
---
i used to be but now i have a 2nd account that keeps all my stuff thats not 100% vital. I am still at 160/220 when i unload
---
*fast travel mats*
---
this seems like such a simple solution, especially since they were in the game initially....
---
I miss when they had the robot spawn issue and there were like 10 Mr. Handys cleaning up around the dumpster.
---
Yes
---
Dick.
---
100% duped
---
Aren't we supposed to be getting mod support this fall?
---
OK I'll shoot you a message
---
Your gun movement
---
also an "eat most decayed food item" for in your favorite wheel would be awesome to add upon that.
---
You'd have to defend your ~~comic book store~~ displays like Comic Book Guy.
---
You can't have 2 pets. If you tame a second pet,the 1st one will stay at your camp untill relog
---
If it's possible then it must be something really new and i want proof of that.
---
Time to get-a lockpicking.
---
I love me some brain fungus soup.
---
The look on his face lmao
---
Look under world challenges for the badgers, and hit the the other camp scout leaders for the acts of kindness...
---
This has happened to me a couple times, I feel way worse than I should after leaving the server.
---
Legacy weapons are still around on all platforms.
---
But what does that mean? How quickly I can draw it? Because, for the most part, my gun doesn’t do too much moving.
---
ok, let's make 3.5 - agree.
---
How **dare** you attempt to take away my precious 1-star Junkie's LMG!
---
It just works. It's the will of Todd. It's one of those things.
---
I just got a TSE Combat Shotgun its accuracy is like 6 I have to get close to 1 shot enemies  otherwise 2-3 shots on a lvl 62 ghoul. It wonder if this was part of the shotgun nerf I will have to check accuracy on a normal combat shotgun and see if there is a difference it kinda takes the fun away.
---
awesome. my IGN is Huxide, i'll be able to log on in about 30m
---
Not sure, but patrolling the Mojave sure makes me wish for one.
---
There is a mine but it’s only open during the lode bearing event, you have to be quick in collecting it before the mine collapses and the event finishes but if you go in with excavator on for the extra yield you can grab quite a bit
---
Yeah, but you *need* to have only that sliver of health for the bloodied weapon to be properly effective, right?
---
When you try to move while aiming down sights you crawl.
---
With this legendary effect you crawl a bit faster.
---
I've found when this happens, they are just farming the caps. If you don't challenge and just hang around outside the workshop boundary, they will just leave.
---
I've started to just wait them out. Go in, re-claim, complete the defend event, and then leave.
---
I'm game prices are sooo much better than the Reddit markets.
---
BE gauss, 3k. BE harpoon, 650. VE 10mm smg, 2.5k. BE combat rifle, 1500. assassins sentinal armor, 2k.
---
I don't even look at Reddit markets anymore.
---
You can.. there is a mod for this. But then  everyone needs to have said mod running.
---
2* legendaries definitely exist
---
There's scamming in the trading menu? Is it like quickswitch? Are they just classic Steam trade scams?
---
Good prices.
---
No benefits from sleep then.
---
Yeah like said, bloodied is a different game. If I had furious maybe better, but it's not bad for a full health build.
---
Yes please fix this....so frustrating
---
Sure, make the bloodied builds even more OP.
---
Hit me up if you find one of these for that cheap lol
---
I wouldn't mind because I could bulk it up and sell it. Matter in fact, I collect everything I find and try to sell it somehow.
---
Nope but I have heard about that. But I did have someone on Reddit ask me for a spreadsheet. I don't have time to make a spreadsheet for everyone.
---
^This!
---
They shouldnt do that.  It would just lead to more people making death traps at their camps, demotivating people to actually do camp visiting
---
No. I’m not seeing it. But thank you for responding.
---
I have yet to see one, I've only ever seen unstarred legendaries, 1\* or 3\*.  But going off that, then it simply should be their frequency of showing up be equal to the desired legendaries drop rate.
---
That's masochism. Those... *"challenges"* you suggested.
---
If you're aiming, you'll move closer to normal speed rather than the slower speed you normally do.
---
It *used* to affect speed in general.  I definitely remember zipping all over the place with a Lever Action Rifle that had this perk.  Then they "fixed" it.
---
If they actually made bulldozer work how they initially described it you could clean anywhere up to taste.
---
I got my perk loadout dialed in so I don’t have much use for XP anymore.  Honestly I wish you could lock levels, the higher I get I fee more vulnerable to griefers.
---
Dammit!
---
Thanks! Here’s a better pic of her, she’s my favorite!
---
[Better look at Margo](http://imgur.com/gUdjFwh)
---
You are right. It is a risk. But I really think they're been trying to put out fires since the game launched. And, please note, regardless of my criticism, I think they've been doing a good job of it. I respect them for not just abandoning the game outright and trying to fix it. 
---
It's designed to be a "live-service" game (a tag that's now a deathblow to any new game). But without loot boxes or more pay-for-play items in the real money store, they have no way to bring in money to keep the servers on or pay developers to make more DLC. The game's rep is also bad enough that regular game sales must be disastrously low for a game this new. 
---
I honestly think that they looked at how much Anthem and it's resulting lack of support was damaging EA and realized that they couldn't just abandon 76 without it killing the company's reputation. So they're trying to show good faith by continuing to bug fix and produce more content. But the actual studio, Bethesda Austin (formerly Battlecry), also wants to show that the game can still bring in money so they'll try anything to get those real world sales and atom shop sales up. 
---
If Bethesda Austin can't turn this thing around somehow, I would not be surprised if they ended up like BioWare Montreal did after that studio ruined Mass Effect Andromeda (Bioware Montreal does not exist any more). They already got one strike against them when they failed with Battlecry. If it turns out that they can't make a Fallout game work, and maybe even did serious harm to the Bethesda brand...well they may be lucky if they only get downgraded to doing QA for other Bethesda studios.
---
Cutting all the story: my new AAE handmade kills the same mutants with 1 shot less than the the FE,same build,same gun attachements.
---
 They die in way less than 10 shots ,so it's kinda obvious.
---
I use armor with extra weight reduction.  I've got a couple with -20% weapons and ammo.  That helped a lot. Also, try not to carry lots of junk and use strong back instead.  Also also use deep pocketed on all your armor and wear underarmor with +2 strength.  Then eat stingwing filet for +2 strength and grilled radstag or ribeye for +20 carry weight.  Lastly, carry whiskey for the +2 strength or make the ant beer for +50 carry weight and then use psychobuff for +3 strength.
---
Sorry for the length.
---
There is a random encounter spawn point across the road from where you’re facing. Might have fast travelled and landed in its aggro circle. Awesome to know that he’s in that encounters pool
---
I'll be in-game in 2-3 hours from now. Relevant?
---
Agreed.  Having one button say "eat" and another one say "take" seems pretty straightforward.
---
Character movement speed bonus is capped at 20%, so if you receive any movement bonus (speed demon), you won't notice any change. Faster movement while aiming will cause your character to move faster any time the gun is drawn whether or not you're actually aiming.
---
Think about when u are in first person view and u hit L2 to aim..I'm assuming it's 25% quicker than normal
---
Just saw a video on Youtube on this topic and it sold the idea pretty well - this coming from an anti-battle royale guy. 
---
Essentially, from the data mining, this is the possible conclusion:
---
Vault 51 opens up and the first quest is to locate it's overseer, once this occurs, another question is started: Find Vault 51. 
---
Once you find the vault, you enter it and it's super computer ZAX(?) essentially takes control over you (kinda like what we saw with Nuka World in FO4). 
---
All your weapons and armor go away and you're naked (maybe in a vault suit) and then you have to progress through all of the 'prestige' quests (like the tadpole quests). Each level, you get more gear, etc. Once you reach the end, if you do, you're selected to be the new overseer. 
---
So, if they do it this way, it wouldn't be that bad because no outside gear (read dupes, etc.) are allowed and everyone is held to the same standard with only your level and perks deciding the diffeence. 
---
Of course, this is all speculation so treat it as such.
---
I do tend to DC when it's that specific one.  I don't have as many as I used to because I'm too lazy to swap over to Pharma Farma or go on medication runs anymore, and I don't seem to come across Disease Cures as frequently in loot piles anymore.
---
Nice to know you can sell them though, since they are one of those odd, arbitrary things you can't sell to normal vendors.
---
So, while I’m aiming (L2 on PS4), I will walk faster than normal? I’m definitely not seeing any difference between a gun that has the perk and one that doesn’t.
---
yup, just reply when you're ready so i'll know to log on in case i'm not
---
Nice, pc
---
Looked through and did not see one for strangler bloom.
---
No.  Adrenal reaction and bloodied start working with every single point of health lost.  The lower you go, the more damage you get.  You're still getting a healthy boost in damage at 50% health.  Add in unyielding armor with melee from strength boost and you're talking one shot strength in sneak to the largest percentage of creatures on the map.  I typically keep my health at 30% and my bloodied meat hook does around 1200 damage.
---
The survival challenge weapon for the week starting 4th June is a bloodied DCG, it’s not faster swing speed, just the 40% more damage when power attacking and 40% less damage taken when power attacking but still a nice weapon, and even better it’s free lol
---
So, based on what you’re telling me, I would actually have to cure myself of Speed demon to experience any noticeable change in my movement that the perk might provide.
---
Having 2 pets is possible and it’s been that way from the beginning. There are videos and guides out there where people have 2 pets. I assume it’s because one per counts as wasteland whisperer and the other as animal friend (although you need both perks to tame, only one to pacify). Unless they’ve changed it, getting two should still be possible but there’s no list that explains which creatures count for what
---
I don’t see a change
---
Vending Machine paints are in CAMP, only Repair Kits are in Utility right now
---
Well surem costs like 200-400 . It shouldn't take long to buy what you need again after a wipe.
---
But yeah i support any type of flexibility in the game.
---
This was my fear.  \*Sigh\*
---
I have a 3*** cloaking while harder to detect. Forgot what the third star was.
---
It be so great to get 5 FPS during the SBQ fight when half the server and their pets are there.
---
I got it from Philippi Battlefield Cemetery. It's on the first floor in the house
---
Thanks. I wish we were told that before we build.
---
Open and close the pipboy to cancel animation and everything connected to drinking. Not optimal,but still faster.
---
A way to prevent that is by having a limit on how many letters/signs we can have, like 60 I think will be fine. As long it's not taking up precious budget space
---
Near Kiddie Korners is a Scout Leader who gives a daily clean up quest the other who give the bug killing quest is inside Dolly Sods (FT to the lookout tower). Watch out for two high level enemies, one in front of camp hq and one down path behind it (towards the workshop). 
---
The Tadpole badges for the 0/3 quest are in the challenge list from your maps screen. Open challenge list and scroll down to World, the select World and scroll down to bottom for Tadpole challenges.  Complete any 3 to satisfy that part of the quest.
---
What’s the armor getup?
---
I've seen it happen in Charleston at the Capitol building. Seems to be a super-rare random spawn (thankfully).
---
Killed sbq yesterday and fast traveled to train station and it teleported its body there.
---
I've heard a rumor that, well, you know how you tend to get a bunch of the same prefix when you turn in a bunch of scrip?  The day she came out, she gave me 3 quad 3\* weapons, including an assaultron head that reverted.  Anyway, I heard a rumor that it happens a lot, even with drops.  There's a theory that if you get a certain kind of drop that you like, that might be the time to go turn in scrip to see if you can get another similar or better item, like maybe with more stars.  That's what I mean about RNG not being so random.  The other theory is that it's related to whatever server you're on at the moment.
---
Had an interesting thing happen the other night, I logged in at my camp near WS and after a few seconds once the game caught up, I started taking a massive amount of rad damage. Popped a Radaway and RadX trying to slow the crazy amount of rads but ended up dying. Realised after I respawned that on the map I was in a blast zone, but once I respawned (outside of the zone) I came back through the cloud around the edge of the zone and everything inside it was fine, as if it hadn’t been nuked and only the edge of the cloud was there. Other players were using my shop which was completely intact still (they were wearing hazmat suits and PA, so the nuke zone must’ve been working for them) but after I’d come back despite having no protection I was taking zero rads. I was able to explore the zone, complete with glowing enemies spawning and was immune to any environmental radiation.
---
Tl;dr
---
This happened by me loading into a world after the nuke had dropped on where my camp was located, dying from rads, quickly respawning and heading back into the zone, after which I was completely immune to radiation and everything looked normal inside, as though it hadn’t been nukes.
---
Just in case anyone wanted to try replicate this.
---
There seems to be a 20% cap on both movement speed and reload speed in Fallout 76. So if you have Speed Demon not a single mod, Perk, or legendary effect would increase your movement or reload speed.
---
Would love to play the event, but every time I try to go down the elevator my game just crashes. Smh
---
"Wanna buy a boat?"
---
Dibs on posting this tomorrow as thougg this onesided conversation hasnt happened everyday for months.
---
Yeah, for a lvl 50+ event, they should make it where lower levels can't start it.
---
During a pre-release video one of the devs spoke about a 12 v 12 deathmatch they tried out and he seems to enjoy it.  No idea if that will implemented in some way or not, just mentioning it for reference.  It may have been the No-Clip video.
---
Sorry I use a bloodied build, the unyielding is really important to me I'm afraid.
---
Thanks though :)
---
Just the little things we nut out as a community. 
---
Hopefully they bring back the fast travel mats (they were in beta) or change the load in to be just outside the circle (like when we fast travel to our own camps)
---
DONT DEAD OPEN INSIDE
---
This. Then once you've modded it equip gun-fu, jump on the first Distant Thunder event that pops up and just go full Leeroy Jenkins at it. It's honestly one of the most fun things in the game.
---
Instigating +1 strength is a mediocre roll?
---
Don't think your problem is with the purveyor.
---
Those quests don't have map markers. The growth is in the challenge menu
---
This guy knows
---
I think you do have to return to the house. I have a vague recollection of being required to return the syringer to the metal box in the lab. But I may well be confusing it with another quest somewhere.
---
There's three houses that I rotate between, and since the last patch everything has to be tethered down with rubber mats, or they won't place or they'll teleport. Loads of people saying the exact same thing, but maybe you've been blessed, idk.
---
At least for raw food yes i suppport this.
---
Scrolling throught a ton of aid for that yao guai meat is long.
---
I ran into two yesterday at top of the world
---
i hate how literally nobody answered this question,
---
BOS hood and bomber.
---
I almost uninstalled the game when my low level character logged in - into a nuked zone - near the nuka cola plant. I was incredibly frustated to lose all of my junk because I didn't even think about logging in and just dying. I have logged in and died on my main character too. 
---
I truly believe it's an unnecessary "feature" to just die upon log in or contract a disease because the world hasn't rendered (ie water around my camp) but despite having aquagirl and not even seeing water I get a disease before I can actually get into my house or any water renders.  
---
a simple solution would be to have some sort of immunity, maybe like you know - in survival mode has after respawning. so if you log into a nuked zone you get a bubble of safety to react. same with logging into water. 
---
since we can't ever choose to log into a safe spot ...like for once I'd like to log out in the relative safety of my camp and log back into that relative safety of my camp not out in the middle of a nuked area, a road, some random field, edge of a cliff or body of water...
---
I cannot discount the effect being broken for certain weapons given how much stuff is, well, broken, but in the shottie I have with this effect works.
---
Full disclosure, I do not know whether the GetInIronSights function - it has to be 1 (TRUE) for this effect to apply - works with scopes or with weapons that technically have no iron sights.
---
this is so awful, I get stuck in more foundations and walls than not and it's been happening since beta.
---
FYI, don't just send a random team invite. Send me a message before you send the team invite please. I don't just accept random invites usually incase its griefers lol
---
I already collected all teddy bears and Mr. Fuzzys, sloth toys, Magazines, bobbleheads and prewar/clean misc items... one can dream
---
I'll be holding back on my expectations though.
---
Just after nucleat autum.
---
You seems to have a miscellaneous of different infos from different sources.
---
I'll do what internet does best : Pics or it didn't happen. Oh and as i said ,having 2 pets for one session doesn't count.
---
They can implement a mechanic like the Cannibal perk, however things will get interesting when the corpse also has a food item on it.
---
Wish I could find the neon plans. Are they a drop or an 11k cap purchase from a vendor or what? I mean I have "Signs &amp; Letters" but I think that's just the tiny metal letters.
---
I was surprised last night, I was at Freddy Fear's House last night, and took down a 3* - Picked up a Bloodied Hunting Rifle, with exploding bullets and 90% weight reduction. My FIRST Multi Star weapon in 20 lvls that was not a lead pipe with weight reduction or faster swinging and my Very First 3* Weapon ever - I am Lvl 129.
---
I did the toxic clean up and bug parts.  But it's saying 2/4 any idea on the other two.  Thanks for the tip on the map. I'll start those
---
I'm going to start doing that!
---
ideal would be a specific roll, like TSE Gatling gun with RW, but chances of that happening is almost impossible =)
---
From my rolls 20-30 rolls for a legendary I was only "lucky" to get a Bloodied Lever Action with Bloodied Lever Action Rifle, 25% firerate, 25% less AP costs in VATS, so moderate I would say. All others are mostly 40 scrip or 1-2K caps offers.
---
Ok. Well that might explain some stuff. Thanks. However, your second paragraph makes absolutely no sense to me. Lol
---
No you're good man. I too use unyeilding pieces. Have a whole set of BoS unyeilding that I use. Good luck!
---
Or possibly writing it a check 😀
---
Except when someone puts them in the middle of traps.  
---
Just like the punch bowl, it will be used for nefarious reasons.
---
You used to be able to do this but the last update made it so you can’t remove just one roof panel.  It gives you an error. Not sure about removing a wall.
---
I have three vending machines:
---
One for ammo/aid/food/purified water/whatever. I price most of it as free.
---
A second for armor/clothing/weapons. a third machine for mods/components. All of that I price as half of what the game initially says.
---
My thought: we're all out there trying to survive, so hopefully I can just help others. I don't care what things "should" go for, I don't care what others are pricing things. I know I'm going to find more along the way and I keep clearing out space in my stash.
---
I might I will look when I get home
---
Yes! And now imagine if we had factions. The Enclave, the Brotherhood and the Raider gangs all fighting for control over Atlas or similar installations (FO New Vegas' Battle for Hoover Dam comes to mind). A huge cross-server event with 40+ players, each side supported by robots, vertibirds, mind-controlled deathclaws, whatever... Small firing teams focus on completing objectives like restoring power or sabotaging the enemy, others lay down long-range suppressing fire or clear the area of hostile robots, while others resupply their team with stimpaks and ammo.
---
And whichever faction wins would stay in control of the facility, granting its members a bonus for a week or so (or until challenged again by another faction)...
---
Just Brotherhood of steel under armor and leather armor, nothing fancy!
---
Cap specializes in peel builds though.
---
Sorry, I guess that didn't make much sense without context.
---
That's very weird. Could it be some sort of burn-in protection? Do you have a QLED? Otherwise it might be something else. It only happens with Fallout 76? I would check it out just in cause it is a defect.
---
This ☝️☝️☝️☝️yes please! I want to deck my entire 2nd floor out in Nuka Cola. Would love this
---
i had this almost happen to me, i have my base near the train station near the top of the world and when logging in i see my rads going up slowly. I look outside my window to see a mushroom cloud within spitting distance of my base. I was fortunate i was right at the edge.
---
Lmao that's great. Not worth it imo.. but kudos lol
---
I'm all for this idea. Maybe the smelter would take a bit of time to smelt ore but like you said, at a reduced acid cost.
---
Dumb question, but how do you know where others are going to spawn in your camp?
---
Wouldn’t it stand to reason to price the really desirable legendaries (i.e. explosive shotguns, Bloodied SS hammers) the same as if we were selling them on 76 marketplace? It’s the same weapons and it’s the same people looking for them who will pay a butt load of that imaginary money.
---
It would bring in more people. I wonder what the end screen will look like when you're the last one in Appalachia? Iguana dinner
---
really good idea, take a weekly survey/questionnaire from players.
---
Lol. So put it in context and put to rest this looming mystery.
---
I am lvling a alt took me the better part of two hours yesterday to find a vendor selling fusion cores for under a 100 per when you dont need them everyone has them when you do some schmuck wants 250 for one at 74 percent.
---
I have a tse gatling plasma and used it on the queen yesterday and fired 7 cores through it and still had durability. Doesn't seem like it went down any to me
---
I'd love if they made boarded houses claimable and instanced.  I'm sure they will never do it because of the resources they would have to allot for everyone to have an instanced CAMP if they chose to claim a building.
---
From what you're saying, it sounds like you still need to revive someone and receive 3 tadpole badges to complete this portion of the quest.
---
As a solo player, it is about the loot. I’m glad you have a squad to play with and get enjoyment out of things beyond items.
---
Furious is better for big boss killing - AA for general use.  I’d save it for your big guns although it’s not bad to have on faster firing rifles.
---
I could make you one in about 4 or 5 hours if you don’t get one before then.
---
PA gives higher DR, so you can fight stronger enemies - which yield more XP - so you level faster.
---
Cores: 
---
There's at least a dozen PA spawn points in the forest alone.  
---
Along with random PA parts, each may have a 25% core.  
---
At the PA spawn point, look around - there may be another core nearby.
---
The event at Camden (see the park operator) awards 1, and there can be up to 4 more in the park.
---
Check the table next to the fusion core processor at poseidon.
---
many locations have 1 or more generators, that may or may not have a core.
---
The batteries included perk will lower the weight of cores from 3# to 0.3#.
---
Early levels, cores can get used up fast, but theres another perk at L50 that reduces core consumption rates.
---
Col Gutsy: 
---
Try hitting the appendages, not the body.
---
Considering I get like 10-12 shots out of my explosive dragon before it breaks with gunsmith 5, I'd say no
---
I have a forest camo right arm with unyielding and sneak.  Third star I forget.
---
Maybe?
---
i once saw two of them approaching the entrance to whitesprings when it was nuked they decimated the robots at the entrance but where overrun when about 20 glowing once ran down the hill they were followed by some warlords
---
this was actually one of the coolest things i encountered in fo76 so far the scenary matched perfectly and it was actually a large scale battle 
---
furthermore this was before the exp from glowing ones was nerfed and i actually leveled up 3 levels 
---
from 40-43 or something like that with one mag out of an automatic grenade launcher
---
i was actually surprised that my playstation could handle all of what was going on
---
i definitely want to see more of them even if they just appear whenever a camp of super mutants is nuked it would be awesome imagine harpers ferry being patroled by 3 or 4 behemoths
---
There is an unmarked spot where you will find one every time. A small pond south of the Solomon's Pond in Savage Divide. You can server hop and he'll be there every time.
---
That isn't true. [There's only one "Utility" section in the Atomic Shop, and it's a subcategory of CAMP objects.](https://i.imgur.com/e7mcrhP.jpg) Within it, you find things like the punch bowl and the personal terminal, as well as a few miscellaneous items. You're correct in that the vending machine skins are no longer listed there, but they were categorised as such in the game files when they were initially introduced. Repair Kits have their own unique section of the Atomic Shop.
---
Pretty sure they removed both the real money and the game money auction houses, and I can see why: since the vending machines came online, I don’t actually *play* the game, I just trawl the vending machines looking for the perfect gun for each of my characters...
---
I heard it disables robots during the event and the ones that are around are friendly and heal the friendly beasts. Haven’t tried it myself, that’s just what I’ve read
---
That \* LMG is still better then the regular drills I keep finding on my \*\*\* corpses. :(
---
Ive spawned in peoples places where they have all the doors locked and no way to get out. One time it happened and the dude was building inside his camp and gave me an angerey react but like come on now. Unlock your doors so i can leave. As well I wanna look at all of your camp. I love seeing the way people decorate their rooms.
---
How does Vampires work anyway?  What does “brief boost in health mean.”
---
Nuke the area just west of RobCo - between the steakhouse garden and the other fauna you’ll get tons of flux.  Might be the best overall flux farming nuke spot I’ve seen.  Steakhouse should be on the east side of the nuke zone.
---
Then fill the trough with as much as you can to increase the strength of your subject animal and then protect it. 
---
Nothing in trough radroach, level one maybe a mirelurk, level two Yao Guai, level three you have a deathclaw or what not to protect
---
Build looks good, but just a heads up - queen is a "glowing" enemy. You're doing 60% less damage than you could be by not running Glow Sights in Perception. Also, Serendipity does not activate in power armor, so you can drop that.
---
Pretty sure the Golden .44 and the Woodland PA are the only exceptions? I've personally seen the .44 on two occasions and the Woodland 3-4 times now. I can't recall any other limited time offers coming back.
---
Player that hits cap stops getting caps after 25,000caps and the other player will still pay caps for said items but caps that are normally given to you are paid 100% in taxes if your currently sitting on 25,000caps so make sure you spend them if you selling stuff.
---
One violent night is great if you shut off the jukebox instead of letting it play straight through the event. Turn it off, kill the swarm of ghouls then turn it back on. Repeat. It extends the event and generates more ghouls that may be legendary. Got 4 yesterday in one run through the event doing this
---
Bit of off hours right now (tbh I havent checked in yet) but as long as you know the basic rules for fighting the queen we are happy to include you in our runs, send me a dm and I'll direct you to our chats where we do the callouts and organize... should be starting runs in atleast 1 server in like 4-5 hours, but the Brits and aussies keep it going pretty good throughout the morning/day... the bulk of us run evening in to the very early morning (5pm-5am est)
---
I had to work from the bottom up too. And sometimes I’d have to try and place them in a area where it wouldn’t show them snapping together (letter not even showing on screen) and it’d somehow auto snap. But it was very hit and miss... took me a couple of hours to write that because of things not wanting to snap or snapping g incorrectly
---
Will do as soon as I negotiate the walk home. 'Run over while rambling on the internets', however fitting it may be to my general existence, is an epitaph I'd rather avoid ;)
---
I do all bulks at 20 and all individual junk components (circuit boards, nuclear material, gold scrap, etc) at 2. Max I'll have on sale is 10 bulk or 100 individual and I keep 5 bulk/50 individual in my stash. Anything past that either gets donated to a teammate or robo vendored
---
Are you talking about Horizon's Rest? There are multiple airports/fields.
---
No idea what the basic rules are i mean lay out as much damage as possible right?
---
Lol. Be safe.
---
im same as mummy, ammo,aids,certain reciped and plans, apparel, for free.  And the stuff i do sell at half prices, capping at 100 if it goes higher than that.  It's really all up to you, and don't bother with people who berate you on your prices.  We all have the right to choose what we sell and for how much, and we can choose to move on to next vendor if we dont like the prices.  Just think about what you think would pursuade others to buy your stuff.
---
It disables robot respawns, and administers formula Q to each friendly animal between each round, which heals them, and has the unfortunate side effect of also making them agressive to mobs. 
---
You can watch a lvl 91 deathclaw futility go against a lvl 100 sheepsquatch. Even if you draw aggro from the alpha, the AOE/stagger quill attacks take 30% off the friendly mob each time.
---
I have to assume that a mat cant be placed directly onto a trap, so a person would be able to atleast get their bearings before triggering them, or they would have to be very elaborate to work anyway, which is already where the state of the game is.  
---
I would see it as a net gain.
---
Radium Rifle is added under its own list. There is a link in the description
---
upvoted! i like this too
---
i know r/falloutsettlements exists, but it would be cool to see specifically 76 CAMPs. with the addition of player vending I have been encountering some really cool spots people have built
---
probably starting at nuclear december.
---
Increase your INT
---
Just did my first nuke run yesterday at the same level as you but solicited help here and got a total party of 4 for the silo run. We completed the silo in 35 minutes (easy to do in shorter time if you know what you're doing - get someone with level 3 hacking) and then took exactly 30 min killing the SBQ since we didn't have a lot of high level people on our server. 
---
DO NOT LET ANYONE PLACE THEIR CAMP IN THE FIGHT ZONE! For whatever reason the turrets kept staggering her in air so she hardly landed. Once the dude finally got the message and closed his CAMP, we killed the SQ in about 5 min, a long with 4 MLQ's, lvl 80+ deathclaws and 5 SB's. There were 8 of us over level 80 and about 4 juniors at level \~30. 
---
Like what others have said, you need TSE and/or AASE weapons to kill the queen quickly. Additionally, you will need 40+ stimpacks and probably 20+ radaways (unless you're build benefits from it). Get all the pyscho+ you and hold and 2K plasma cartiges for your gatling plasma. 
---
If you're on Xbox, I'll join ya but I won't be able to log on for another 6 hours.
---
Any action with a long animation that takes control away from you should be either a long press or something you can cancel mid animation. Drinking water, sleeping, sitting, crafting and playing instruments shouldn't punish you for misclicking, particularly in the heat of battle.
---
Yeah, this is good, I would gladly give up some posters for these
---
Thank you for the suggestions everyone!
---
Ah
---
Miss the old Battlefield days, eh?
---
Press R to Eat/Drink would work, similar to playing holotapes automatically. 
---
Probably wouldn't take that much to add in since it's a similar kind of action, just on a different item.
---
Honestly, you're overthinking the problem. The game already creates blueprints without issue, all they'd need to do is blueprint any neon letters that are snapped together, and fix the snapping together.
---
The other point you tried to make, like people would use thousands of letters.. that's a non issue. They could easily limit how many of a "thing" you have, like they do with turrets, vending, etc.
---
Also, you exaggerate how much processing it takes, I can make cat posters and spam them everywhere, so it isn't as simple as "because it takes x,y,z coordinate".
---
They could easily limit letters to 30-40 and make it cost up to 3-5% of the camp budget without suddenly "crashing" anyone.
---
All of your reasoning is based on assumptions that I don't think are at all correct.
---
I’m just starting to try to tame animals as pets. I just pacified 3 mongrel hounds, ran away, came back a few minutes later to see if they had started heading for my camp, and they were still there and they were HOSTILE. WTH?!
---
What's the)))in 0. kie3ee34 re fb lol hi
---
It is in the C.A.M.P. Building tools. Aka, where you build items to place in your camp
---
how fucking STRONG are you!?  Its usually the giants sending lydia into space.
---
That's labelled as Swamp pod - that's its internal name
---
1) Dont shoot her while she is flying - it staggers her and will glitch the animation, so she wont land
---
2) dont hide in or on V9 - she cant land on or around V9 due to fencing and space available
---
3) dont use grenades (I guess cryo are ok, but I'm not sure if this has been updated) - they will stagger teammates and they will lose sent bonuses (and I kid you not, I swear they programmed her to know this because even when you just walk a few feet she knows to hit you just right then it seems)
---
4) stay together - she will target the lone warrior, and land on them, causing everyone to run after her and lose sent/end up in blastzone
---
They arent as bad as they may seem, it just makes it easiest for everyone to be involved and takes her down as efficiently as possible, we drop queen all 3x a server and depending on how many people are on we will do this in 3-4 servers at once, and we rinse and repeat all night (probably kill her 15+ times per server, meaning that you will be there for 15 or so, while other servers do the same, kill her 40+ times a night between all running servers)
---
Any chance this is an open offer? I'd like to get more routine runs, rather than having to launch, and hope enough randos show up. Lvl 194, I'm more than familiar with SBQ fights.
---
Just gotta work on your timing, I sprint up and bayonet stuff with my Black Powder Rifle Large Bayonet all the time and it's super satisfying. But ya, you're right, it'd be sweet if I could skewer things while just continuing on with my charge lol
---
Were they the antlers that were in that 1800 Atom bundle? I wanted them, but damn...
---
In your camp building menu there are Vending machines. You build them at your camp and then plug them into a power source. Once you do that, interact with it and add items from your inventory or your stash and set prices. At that point your camp becomes a fast travel location for everyone and they can see the types of items you have in the main map
---
The server explodes.
---
I'm on PS4 Pro and had lots of game crashing or freezing randomly when entering a building, opening the pipboy, consuming aid or using terminals, usually after a few hours of game play, also sometimes an enemy will take no damage from a sneak attack even when it says X2 sneak damage on screen.
---
Ha! Thanks, i got it modded a while ago. I appreciate the follow up and thanks for doing that in the first place
---
Sounds good where can i sign up?
---
Do you play on ps4? I sell trash legendaries but all of them under 100c mostly 30c or 40c and sometimes as low as 15c my camp is also located really close to the legendary vendor
---
The four:
---
Kiddie corner
---
Collect bugs
---
Revive an ally
---
Earn three tadpole badges.
---
Make sure you have a variery to sell. Selling flat out junk sucks. I hate seeing people that have 20+ armor and is absolutely  useless.
---
I ended up with a bunch of plans, armor, and weapons maybe junk.
---
I like to have good deals.
---
Sure, I just posted our rules, might seem a bit excessive, but through about 5k combined hours and a lot of effort by the higher ups, we have determined this to be the most efficient way to kill her, we have a video of a 23 second kill... another of about 42 seconds, and another nuke touching down within 90 seconds...
---
A reset is needed
---
you should be able to leave and join adventure but if you do you cant go back to survival..
---
What is the white outfit she is wearing in the last picture?
---
Yeah, I've got the timing down, too lol
---
Yup, definitely glitchier since the last patch. That seems to happen a lot though, and they'll probably hot-patch it soon with some fixes 👍 they usually do
---
I think these days Oprah is likely sitting in backstage eating all the doughnuts.
---
I'm on a pro as well I got killed in watoga high by a invisible ghoul when monster mash started while I was scaving.. I was like what the Paranormal Activity. 🤣 🤣
---
Well this post got more traction than I thought it would. I was happy when it said I had 20 upvotes and thought “20 people thought it was funny or amusing, I’ll take it!” Then expected it to just get pushed off the page never to be seen again. XD
---
So this is what Fallout made us. Bunch of drunkards who are more inclined to take a snapshot of heavily irradiated creatures and have no recollection what we ate yesterday. :)
---
legacy weapons should be redeemable for 300 scrip each at the legendary vendor...
---
That would be nice. The last time I mistakenly removed starched genes, I lost 8 of my 10 mutations before I finally got rid of dang Empath.
---
to someone that likes reading and listening to audio books you managed to skip a bunch .. to the average player that sinking feeling is you realizing quests in this game have no depth nor impact ... 
---
and yeah it's a single enemy to kill a wendigo and you get a plan to build a mounted head in ur crib now you badass .. welcome to the cool table
---
the best placement for the mounted head is right beside a toilet if you have one in ur camp .. it'll make you shit real quick
---
Yep
---
Any update on this?
---
Can I get the day after? I'm thinking I might post about fast travel mats too if that fits in the schedule.
---
I figured, I was just kidding 😁 commiserating with a fellow bayonet charger lol
---
Seriously though, you should see how insanely long the black powder bayonet is. It's a whole goddamn sword, basically turns the thing into a spear 🤣
---
Minecraft has this
---
I was getting frustrated that a mirror kept building itself inside the wall and the only way to get it back was to remove the wall. Eventually I had to trick it into building how I wanted by placing lights somewhat close to it xD
---
Appreciate it pal :)
---
No they were separate.. they may have been in the bundle but I didnt get then that way.. I wear them all the time.. its staple of my outfit and now with this mask.. love myself
---
Brill, how much do you want for it?
---
Thank you :)
---
Todd don't give a shit xD
---
That works for normal SB only it seems.  She will land sooner with no shooting.  I thought it was nonsense till I saw many many times.
---
You want to watch your budget evaporate, use those damn little white letters. Sweet Cheese Jeebus I can watch the bar move just so I can tell visitors stuff like "vendor thinger over there" and "I have more kick ass guns on my mule, HMU".
---
I sell almost all chems at less than half their value 
---
Nobody buys anything feelsbadman
---
Design/Art: We have the new neon letters ready to go in. 
---
C-Suite Asshole: Yeah but, do they need ALL the colors for free?
---
Another thing that is in ESO but not in 76.
---
I agree though, the amount of times I've placed a light and it spawns inside the wall of a cave or a steel beam of a monorail is maddening. Not only does then create some weird, random glow, it takes up precious budget until you decide to replace your camp and start all over again.
---
There is a lot of monetization that's being left on the floor.
---
I'd love to have a flagpole to put flags up.
---
Or fireworks.
---
Or other things like that that people in an apocalypse would use to find some normality.
---
You know, I think these are decent ideas outside the pet companions.  Having a customizable camp pet would be cool.
---
*is English and doesn’t understand the fuss, but joins in anyway*  
---
Yeah! The thing should have done the thing because of reasons! You tell ‘em!
---
Everything you mention happened to me last night. I find this happens late in the weekend. It's like there have been too many nukes dropped, and the servers are overloaded with cleanup.
---
 Great time to server hop whitesprings for glitchy legendary drops. I find some worlds will be filled with robots instead of ghouls. Great for level 1 legendaries to give or sell to noobs. Other worlds will have glitchy ghouls, and everyone of them will drop a legendary no matter what their title is.
---
How do u have a brahmin
---
Hopefully the dont let us down for the 4th... what's crazy is the team who does Fallout Shelter do alittle something for ALL hoildays.. I mean Mothers Day was started in Grafton, WV and they let that completely go by without even a nod
---
Too much love for the Sheepsquatch design. Proper unique looking, what with the protruding skull and the quills, the only thing I would possibly change is to make it bigger.
---
I found the guide video I watched awhile ago but I realize now what I was seeing:
---
https://youtu.be/SLlw9ypFgkk
---
When you tame a new pet. The old one will stay at your base until you relog. It will have a white name and not attack you but you can shoot it and it doesn’t have a green outline around it. The person who posted the video never mentioned that which i guess means they never relogged when making the video.
---
So unless there is any other evidence, I guess you can only have 1 tamed pet. That’s unfortunate but I don’t mind sticking with my megasloth
---
What makes you think that only Americans play Fallout 76? I didnt see any celebration for Portugal's Freedom day either...
---
I had marsupial, grounded, bird bones, adrenal, speed demon, and healing factor. I not only re-logged I tried a different primed gauss weapon.
---
There is a way, they’re called friends. Unfortunately I haven’t found the plan for those yet.... but I’ll let you know if I do
---
I'm L90, and have been overencumbered since about L40.
---
Was gathering lots of L45+ weapons I wanted to try out before I dumped (or kept), and was doing lots of WS runs, so constantly gathering more...then the announcement for player vending, then purveyor was released, so I held them....and it goes downhill from there.  
---
  I know it's mainly fusion cores and weapons, but I also noticed this weekend I was walking around with 250 radx, another 300 diluted radx....plus almost the same amount of radaway/diluted radaway.  Even at 0.25# that 500# right there.
---
Made a few caps selling off a chunk of those...
---
The "bonus" of being forced to walk everywhere is you likely discover more locations and have some interesting random encounters - taking down the first (of a number of) legendary sheepsquatches, for example....
---
The drawback is if you are on a team and they can FT, but you can't....running solo, that didn't bother me, but since reaching L60, I found myself teaming up more often...
---
I spawned at someone's camp to find some anglers destroying the walls and a couple of workbenches. I took them out and repaired the items it broke, not something I realised you could do.
---
Out of subject question, is the b25 handmade better than be on in PVE as well?
---
No, it really wouldn't. If they wanted to do that right now, they just have to pay attention to where they initially place their camp- in other words, they could already be doing it, yet we don't see posts indicating this is an issue.
---
Players want to make caps using vending, 99% of players are unlikely to give up making caps so they can be an asshole. You're not going to buy from someone who tries to trap you, that's just common sense.
---
Being able to move the spawn point isn't going to create issues, just fix them. True assholes can already be assholes if they wanted to, this doesn't make it any easier for them.
---
*makes chicken noises despite the fact I’d probably do the same*
---
Camp pet. Sure. No problem. A mutant hound hanging out at your CAMP? Sounds great.
---
Every player with a tabby/ mutant hound/ radtoad following them everywhere? Hell no.
---
Right prime does buff damage but here I am saying, at least when mousing over prime is not buffing damage. I looked at my handmade, which was not primed, then I primed the receiver and no change to damage?
---
Monetize Independence Day, not Memorial Day.
---
They should make a mule box with 200 lb weight limit to do transfers that is connected to all characters.
---
[You can also buy some nuka cola from a vendor in white springs named bubbles](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Whitespring_Resort) *(scroll down until you see second floor in the wiki)*
---
WORD on the .308. I built a vanilla LMG and crafted UC .308 because it was just such a beast.
---
Yeah. It's my fault I guess for trying to find a better place to put my CAMP device so I could adjust spawn in location.
---
I was willing to take the loss on the missing Spotlight that I'm assuming is encased, unwired in the middle of a bridge pillar but not being able to repair quickly by Just going to the CAMP is rather annoying when you build close enough to spawn zones that random attacks are common.
---
worthy suggestion!
---
Why do you NEED it!?
---
My wife and I play on both XBox and PC but it is a pain to stop what we are doing, one of us switch characters, meet up, do the trade and then switch back and the other person switch, trade and switch back yet again. 
---
If we had a common stash that all my characters could get into without even getting into the game all the way that would work.
---
I did have adrenal but I thought that only kicks in when you have low HP, although I don’t know how low or how much. My memory is my gauss’ damage was consistently in the 320s.
---
I got a drill from a 3*lvl 100 sheepsquatch, would love to get even a 1* :(
---
never had any of these issues.
---
I just wish it either wouldn't turn green at all or not allow placement if it doesn't accept the area as valid.
---
It's where you initially place the CAMP when you claim a new area. Essentially directly in the centre of the build zone. :)
---
You can send me a invite.. I cant promise I'll jump on ever time... but if I'm online ill swing threw.. I'm not OP by any means but I'll take control of crowd control and what not... Dookiestorm
---
No offense, but at that point 27-30 crashes in three days sounds like its a problem on your end.
---
“Most”. Some hardened receivers are equivalent to Primed. Bethesda is horribly inconsistent with weapon mods. I can’t speak for handmade specifically but I’ve noticed on other weapons little to no change in base damage.
---
Yeah that's super tedious, half the time I can't even work out what it is that's actually broken so I always just use the camp thingy.
---
Yes for furious to start being better you need to shoot 10 times
---
FO76 takes place in West Virginia...once apart of the Great U.S.A. so it would functionally make sense to let our vault dwellers to show off their pride!
---
However, I do recognize the fact that there would be foreign born Vault residents so their heritage could/should be on display as well!
---
I honestly don't recall that! I'm a little disappointed, I must say. I got a little distracted with For Honor at Christmas time. Was one or two days I didn't check the Atom store...
---
I have yet to meet super hulk too :(
---
There's no way they fail us two holidays in a row!
---
Executioner is good on the queen only tbh because she stays under 40% for a long time
---
I can see this being made available for items, but not for caps or scrip. Doing this for currencies would allow one to circumvent the daily limits on what you can collect.
---
Hear, Hear! Cheerio, Mate!
---
Well Independence Day was a pretty good movie at the time, Memorial Day....not so much.
---
If only we had something easy to place and move like, I dunno, maybe a small rug or placemat that would link to spawn in location so we wouldn't have to worry about moving the actual CAMP around randomly for a hour trying to figure out how to prevent a potential shopper from falling to their death when they want to buy some purified water.
---
Honestly, it's very disturbing that Todd would rather sell us Raider Armor skins instead of American Flags on Memorial Day.
---
Pip pip!
---
I set my camp just up the river without knowing he spawned everytime I FT home. Best mistake ever. I kill roughly 5 behemoths per session 😀
---
encountered the same, must have been at least 10 radstags standing together in toxic valley. felt really weird and yummy
---
Much appreciated.
---
yea I wish for items too, kind of annoying having to annoy my friend to login just to transfer items.
---
Bird Bones and Adrenal will effect your damage with rifles. If you haven't got them anymore it would explain the damage reduction. People falsely believe Adrenal only kicks in at low HP. It starts working yhe moment you lose a single HP and gradually gets stronger as you lose health.
---
Yeah, it turns green and gets my hopes all up, like “oh man, this is gonna work..... CRAP!”
---
You can collect well over 25k caps in a day by selling at your CAMP, selling at the vendors and buying at other players vending machines. I have not come across enough sell-able good loot to do it but I imagine that some players can.
---
I think a week
---
Thanks, I am now :)
---
This legendary effect is merely a multiplier of an actor value, in this case the 'SpeedMult' one.
---
In order for this multiplier to apply the condition 'GetInIronSights' must be true. From the top of my head I did not remember if this condition had anything to do with actual iron sights or not. It doesn't, is just the action of aiming as opposed to hip firing.
---
However all this rambling is rendered mot by the point raised by other fellow players in this thread. If there is a hard cap of 20% on the 'SpeedMult' actor value any multipliers on top of the 20% already provided by Speed Demon are basically wasted.
---
I thought that because the action of aiming down sights already applied a hefty penalty to movement speed it might offset the 20% bonus by a fair margin however it is entirely possibly that the 20% movement speed bonus of Speed Demon applies AFTER the penalty of aiming down sights applies rendering any further bonuses null and void.
---
Finding the 100% appropriate answer to this burning question would require a dive on the esm that I cannot possibly do after a 10 hour shift so I defer this pleasure to someone else for now.
---
Place down a chair they can click on, it'll move them into the chair out of the wall. If you can't place it outside that room, build a door so they can get out. Right now there's nothing they can do to damage your stuff unless you play on survival.
---
Awesome, he drops pretty good loot.
---
Had what I think are server crashes. Both me and friend locked up at same time during arktos event. Happened a couple of times. Someone said if you have multiple chars vendoring on the same account, you get the vendor stock thing. I haven't had any problems here, but I only run one shop.
---
Still have issues with the favorites wheel sometimes. Have to reset those, that's been going on a while. When the favorites wheel doesn't have a problem between servers, I lose all the ammo in the currently equipped gun. My renamed gun has stayed the same though (PC).
---
The solo thing on teams. Kick them off and have them become leader with invite.
---
*looks at lone wanderer level three and sighs* I didn’t even know this was an issue
---
I have 2 XB's/mule account, so have a roughly 4,800 lb stash.
---
Itll be fixed, we just never will see 3 stars again. Scarcity somehow relates to replayability/sustainability.  My only thing is it doesnt foster anything for us to do with these awesome builds. Get loot figured out, then balance the hell out of it. Or....
---
Start hardcore survival, 1 year season, must start new toon, no legendary effects. Different loot for different stats. Like best kill/death ratio, minimum 76 kills. Stuff like that. Now loot will mean something. So will crafting. Wanna make crafters feel even more special? Give us a 5 star Intel that makes teammates gear degrade slower. Without having to invest in charisma(sharing). Just a few ideas.
---
atomic shop update with some nice stuff. no dl though
---
yes four times the other night, the same one kept falling on me. it was miles away from where we beat it. also had swimming ghouls on that same server
---
People often lie or screw with questionnaires, this may not have the intended effect.
---
XB1 unfortunately =/
---
Fuck I would love a MvM style mode. Send on the onslaught of waves.
---
Cool, thanks
---
Todd is on his 15th to last chance to subvert my expectations!
---
Plus he sniffs glue.
---
Put me on your list gt is DreddedOne
---
No making stuff for the 4th is to easy.. and they can always make money of 'merica... ya figure they just throw red, white, blue on something and call it patriot people will buy it no questions asked.. I can almost say 100% we will get a exPA paint for 1400 and a backpack paint
---
Indubitably.
---
I play solo 90% of the time because of these kind of issues. I imagine the game is a lot better if you've got a group, but the lack of communication options make it so that you have to use some 3rd party tool/site to get a proper experience.
---
I think incendiary rounds do more damage to Wendigos. I haven't got my hands on a flamer yet and I haven't used any other weapons against them because my incendiary SMG seems to be quite effective, If it doesn't it definitely should because it would be a nice tie into the folklore.
---
&gt; Monetize Independence Day, not Memorial Day
---
Why not both? If you're be honest, and you choose not to monetize a holiday where we, as a nation, honor the fallen, I can respect that but if that was the case, give us discounts on Americana items.
---
what im thinking is that people tend to be lazy and not actively malicious.  Yes people could already be setting their camps that way, but it would take a bunch of trial and error, plus actually knowing where other people spawn, which i assume most/many people dont know.
---
adding a big green dot in build mode would bring the concept of planning around the dot to the forefront of peoples minds.
---
Good enough. I appreciate your time and insight. Now, REST! :)
---
10/10 comment
---
i would rather see a 200lb mailbox available to the entire account than a 200lb stash increase...
---
So it becomes like Minecraft
---
will do.
---
Thanks :) I might even treat myself to some food too ;)
---
I got a Bloodied LMG with faster fire rate, faster reload for 1000 caps. I was so fucking stoked.
---
Mailbox between each of a players characters would be great. I don't think a single character stash increase is really necessary.
---
I claim my Cake Day as dibs for posting about legendary drops and fast travel mats.  It's my party, and I'll cry if I want to.
---
Wouldnt know. I dont play minecraft.
---
Easier to find a flatwoods than a behemoth
---
what happened?
---
I don’t much either just reminds me of playing it with my little cousins
---
Either focus on *quantity* or *variety*.  If all you have to sell are plans, sell *lots* of plans.  Same goes for weapons, armor, ammo, junk, etc...
---
I don't even bother to check out shops that are only selling a few things.  I stick to having a variety and I do pretty well with my machines set up like so:
---
1. Legendary Weapons &amp; Armor (good prefixes only)
---
2. Plans
---
3. Serums, Aid, &amp; Plans
---
4. Outfits, Ammo, &amp; Oddities
---
If I notice that I've recently sold several things, I will top off the machines to keep them as full as possible.
---
Good luck!
---
*PSN Neojinnx if anyone wants to check out my store and camp, fully equipped with waterside bar, dock, and dark summoning ritual.*

When I say collect - I meant from vendor bots &amp; the legendary recycler. Yes, through personal vendor stations, you are at the whim of the buyer and could easily walk away with your coffers full. The managed daily 1400 caps / 150 scrip would be circumvented if you could collect with multiple characters and then move all that currency to a single character. I highly doubt Beth would make their own limits easily gotten around.
---
Quick fix: put the green dot right outside the build area of the camp. Can't build a death trap around them, but you can spawn them in a convenient location.
---
You fell in love but he logged out?
---
I go to whitesprings and roach all the hangers
---
Someone put a map here of all unmarked locations with a name of what it is, maybe that helps you find more
---
If it a multi choice thing.. you can only mess with it some much.. especially if you can only answer it once per account whenever they would come out... and if you like your only hurt your self in the end.. there would no need for a 'opinion' area cuz that's what the questions would be.. your opinion... it could be set up in the wrong way and then yea people would just cry and lie just to be d-bags
---
5k would do it
---
ok is it weird i have a crush on your character?
---
We could pretend to be the inspectors and have to “inspect” and approve ghoul filled guest rooms. I’d love that.
---
I don't have to wait. I loot fresh bodies.
---
I saw one behemoth and one flatwoods monster. The former was at the WS entrance while I shot the flatwoods monster once and the bastard ran away.
---
I been having a lot of fun with the assasins fatman I found i kinda feel bad for the bloody builds when I'm using that its hard to get used to but fun when you do.
---
thing is though, with unyielding I get crazy high agility scores meaning I can basically stealth right up to things and melee them in broad daylight and they can't see me.
---
I guess if you're not running a bloodied build this would still be interesting to know
---
I get what you mean going on strictly environment to player with those cap limits. A player can exceed that rather quickly on total amount collected daily with caps by buying and selling at their CAMP.
---
You can do it with a second account. Launch your main account from the beth launcher. Create a shortcut to Fallout76.exe and launch that, login with the other account. You can trade between those characters now. It's a pain in the ass, but it let's you move plans and items
---
This makes sense. I was worried about people being able to raid my vending machines by just buying out 25k worth of stuff and then taking the remaining items for free.
---
Yes!  Decimated is when you have been cataloged in a library according to the Dewey system.  Get it write people!
---
I just want to know what's in those ballrooms
---
I'm the general of the enclave now, why can't I open them doors?!
---
Uranium fever is my go to for steel
---
Just wandering around the map collecting junk and visiting player camps for interesting things.
---
I'm lvl 156 so my main mission now is to collect the right legendaries I want and go for an aesthetic look I'm after
---
Hahahaha, this is the best comment I've seen all week. No, but I did fall in love with something he received.
---
Shhh that's my steel secret too!
---
Sounds good to me :) what's your psn?
---
Aquagirl doesn't protect you from waterborne disease, just rads. Although, I *wish* it protected from disease.
---
Oh dont worry we will probably get it for the 4th... for a whole lot of atoms.. maybe something free.. but I'd assume we will be seeing about 3000 atoms worth of stuff coming up on the 4th
---
Why wait for the day after? Just repost it in a few hours and watch the karma roll in.
---
Between Top of the World and the Trainyard is a billboard with 4 Cats and some sweet loot. I used to have my camp built so the 4 Cats were my pets.
---
That must shred enemies
---
Uranium fever, pick up everything and scrap with the scrapper card on, there's a bench just outside.
---
Also west tek, kill all muties and scrap their guns.
---
The above is quicker than collecting ore ( don't need acid ) or taking the steel mill.
---
&gt;if you have multiple chars vendoring on the same account
---
2 total chars, One vendors, one don't. Actually never used the 2nd char ever after the vendor ability released.
---
Psn is hottkarls
---
Ha. I had a recently killed one land on my head after fast travelling yesterday. I may have screamed.
---
Except that it has bad effects and does trash damage and is not at all in demand but ty for your answer
---
3 times the free ultracite.
---
Or be better at math
---
That's what I think they have planned for all the locked bungalows with keypads on the grounds.
---
Ah yeah know the spot.
---
Fair, I kind of like the immersion aspect and not having to knock down a wall to switch things off. Appreciate that's a bit daft, but I enjoy the building mechanics and trying to make the place practical.
---
&gt; I lose all the ammo in the currently equipped gun
---
Oh no!, that's horrible because it's not "replaceable" where my reloading of my store is a pain, but I didn't loose anything.
---
No. Just... no. 
---
If we could, then why bother having mutliples at all? Just give one character the stash and CAMP budget of 5 characters and call it a day.
---
We can already swap perks at will. Change our appearance. Now we want to be able to start fresh characters with god tier gear and maxed out CAPs? 
---
Nah. What's the point then?
---
No.
---
At the Freak Show?  I often get two MQs, there.
---
You're not actually knocking down a wall you're replacing it with one which has a door. Think of it as a hidden room.
---
Which makes me happy. I paid 16k for something I really wanted, but think it was an outrageous price. I like to think he was already at 20k and just make 5 off me.
---
Ohh! Thanks for clarifying about adrenal. I tough it was like unyielding or bloodied. But what does bird bones due to affect damage?
---
Bend tunnel.
---
Wildcard!!
---
I would love to maybe control the color with a terminal.
---
Don't get me started on this.  A bunch of us were running the event at Arktos and if felt like every 30 seconds someone was yelling, "*Stop drinking the fucking water!"* 
---
I guess it adds a level of excitement though to be doing an event surrounded by predators where the main objective requires that you repeatedly pick things up from *in the dirty water* only to be killed while stuck in the excessively long *drinking* animation.
---
I'm going to turn this into a drinking game.  A drink for a drink.
---
If I need a quick 200 steel I go to brim quarry as there are a lot of supermutants to kill and scrap their weapons, also keep your eyes open for breach and clear while down in the ash heap.
---
For example my LMG went from 50 something to 70 something when primed— I did not have all heavy weapons perks maxed, but that shouldn’t effect the percentage change.
---
&gt;The solo thing on teams. Kick them off and have them become leader with invite.
---
Not something you can do easily in a blast zone because if there are legendaries around everybody wants to get them first... this messes up the enjoyment of the team dynamics. You certainly don't want this happening during the SBQ encounters..
---
-Marsupial gives extra strength
---
-Deep pocket all your armour
---
-Backpack
---
-High capacity mod for backpack.
---
Im currently wandering around with max weight 435 and im not even particularly specced into strength, which means Im currently carrying a supersledge, lever action, handmade, Gauss rifle and railway rifle simply because I can
---
I found a place way up north in the mountains towards the west side. A camp/overlook but unmarked. Nukashine took me there. There's also a little shack north of the red rocket in ash heap, it has a lot of possum or fireflies.
---
Lick my stick
---
I can craft you one, just provide materials
---
Got any pics of your camp? Sounds interesting
---
We need different colored everything. Reading the fecking gauges on PA with red/green color-blindness is practically impossible, not to mention the hud overlay is pretty worthless. The ability to switch that to blue would be a godsend.
---
Can anyone advise where the plans can be located?
---
Yes explosive weapons break faster
---
And congratulations! You now have swamp itch for sleeping on the ground.
---
Yeah i have an anti armor set ready to go for when they nerf bloody build.
---
I use Vault 63 area on the hill by the red crane and higher up the mountain for iron ore, I then run down to the front of the abandoned construction site at the bottom of the hill and walk away with 400 ore in ten minutes. Each ore is 5 steel. 
---
It’s quicker. The only bitch is the acid needed for smelting.
---
Spawned into a floor today.
---
Tried to fast travel.
---
Unfortunately, spawning into the floor seemed to get rid of the functions of ESC and M so I couldn't call up the map.
---
I had to log out and back in to get them working again.
---
Another day, another bunch of moments where i feel it's a must to have it :/
---
This has been happening on ps4 also and needs to get fixed asap.
---
This is the way FO76 ends
---
Not with a bang but with a duper
---
Top of the World and environs has a lot of tin can traps that you can scrap for steel and lead and also there's baddies there whose weapons you can scrap, there's a workbenches all over
---
Kinda popular though so you may have to server hop
---
I mean... some people like alts, and pretty much every mmo let's you mail to alts...
---
Yeah these things need fixing for sure
---
I just dont get how the camp spawns people. Between me and my girlfriends camps if we fast travel to hers I am placed next to the actual C.A.M.P thing while she goes into water and sinks. If we travel to my camp I go underground and she is placed nicely in front of my C.A.M.P thing. Doesn't make any sense.
---
The agility boost helps with rifle damage, I think. I could be wrong about that one though.
---
I'm currently collecting a vanguards sentinel set, got my damage resistance up to 660 atm, still need another 2 pieces.
---
Spamming Stealth boys and have a crit commando build, works very well.
---
That's only true for wild plants. Crops placed by a player aren't instanced, and harvesting them will prevent the camp owner (or anyone else) from harvesting them until they grow back.
---
Fortunately they grow back a lot faster than wild plants do.
---
Most efficient way for me is to find a low level area full of super mutants. Melle or one shot them, collect every gun and scrap with scrapper on. 
---
Wv lumberyard spawns about 20 or so mutants, and with picking up the area junk as well, I can get about 400 steel. 
---
There's also a bunch of steel nodes to the right of vault 76, and with excavator armor you can get a bunch.
---
After reading it several times i still don't understand the first bit, "the tough get shopping" works though
---
Hi,
---
The Stimpak Diffuser plan is a random Event reward for completing Project Paradise. 
---
Xbox? I'll be available tonight at 10pm pacific time.
---
I can do the same
---
Go to the grafton steel workshop and kill all the supermutants in that area. If you claim the workshop, you can build crafting stations and storage so you can break down their guns and store it right away and keep farming
---
Farm an area with super mutants and scrap all the weapons using scrapper perk card. 1 west tec run gets me 600-800 steel
---
Grafton steel and New Gad are good as well
---
Good ideas thanks!
---
exactly. I'm just wishing here lol
---
that certainly works for me lol
---
it would probably need to be like, ON the border edge tho
---
yeah. The annoying thing is they had gotten it to a reasonable stable state for all of like two weeks and I was like 'yay, I can nuke the whitespring and not expect a client crash in the first five minutes' and now we're back to the level of instability we had before. Infuriating.
---
+1 for this.
---
I chew through 5.56 ammo like mad and end up crafting a LOT.
---
Also my spacebar hates me cooking up 50+ glowing meat steaks
---
Before this, I was the ultimate lazy farmer button: "Harvest All" in my CAMP
---
It's annoying but it's something I've come to terms with.  I will tweak something and then exit the customization screen to look at my character in third person.  I make note of anything that needs to change and then repeat the whole process.
---
Ehh. I find it balance breaking.  Not that FO76 is super balanced as it is... but having LVL 1 characters, fresh outta the vault, with max level gear (for their level)… well, that just throws everything outta whack.
---
We'd be back at "one hit kills" in low level events, where one player has their machete and .38 pipe pistol, and another is fully kitted out.
---
Like I said.. cosmetic items? Absolutely. Let me hit the ground looking the part of the character right outta the gate. But starting out with 200 stimpacks, a few serums, enough ammo to wipe out every creature in the forest, etc... just seems like a really bad idea.
---
they never should have left them in the game.. but they did...
---
I don't lose the ammo - I have to unequip the weapon and reequip it. But it is momentarily terrifying.
---
Was going to say my camp, but player vending changed that
---

---
Wouldn't it make more sense to make the proc chance based on weapon fire rate?
---
So a single-shit weapon had say a 75% chance to proc, semi-auto had a 40% chance to proc, and full-auto had a 15% chance to proc.
---
These are just bullshit ballpark numbers, but basically just have the proc % just be a function of the fire rate.
---
Thanks lots of good tips here!
---
Yes, I was praising Bethesda for their marvelous efforts. It was fantastic a little something here.. there.. but didn't crash at all.. then.. argh!!!
---
It's like there are 2 teams.. one really has got it together.. and the other just screws it all up again... Planned releases.. Awesome... updates... are super flawed.
---
I'm level 145 and the same thing happened to me. Except it was two level 80 Sheepsquashs and I knew what I was getting myself into. Well kinda - I thought someone might join me in battle! The cows died and I failed the mission but I managed to kill the two big fellas from the relative safely of the busted shack.
---
You wanna trade or sell that bro? Tell me what you need i can find it for you
---
I cannot disagree with you- people gave their lives for our pursuit of happiness.

GT: Aliens8407
---
I mostly play on weekends but I do pop on sometimes during the week. Feel free to hit me up if you see me online.
---
Ran into a similar trap base but it was so obvious that it was. Stepped on pressure plate, looked inside at a small room full of pressure plates, chuckled, made sure I didn't have any junk, went inside, doors closed, flamethrowers started, I shuffled into the corner out of harms way, looked up to see owner on second floor through wire floor, and said over mic "that didn't go the way you expected, did it?" FT'd out. Haha
---
Man that’s a badass looking character !
---
I think it's called Nuka girl or something like that. Pretty sure it's in the Atom Shop.
---
Yeah, let us plant cranberries for crying out loud! That relish!
---
We need more HUGE creatures in the game. Go bigger Bethesda! Gimme a Scorchbeast Emporer or Megasloth Behemoth.
---
In my experience, vending machine shoppers don’t spend what forum shoppers do. It’s a totally different market. Trade forums are only used by a small percentage of the player base. Most will never even think about visiting one. 
---
I have no issue with selling for more on a forum—things are worth more there—I just don’t have the patience for it. I’d rather stick with my one character, sell stuff in a machine, and keep rolling.
---
Would be clever to release it during the 2020 us presidential election
---
Murgle’s coffee shop. We were neighbors, but I moved recently.
---
What would be funnier was a scorched stuck in a power armor with a dead fusion cell.
---
Heaven forbid that someone else has though, but let's repeat the mantra: 'in Bethesda we trust x5'.
---
This is the reason I stopped logging out while at White Springs. I would log in while it's nuked. I make a run for the door. Lag kicks in while the bots are loading. I'm dead just as the screen fades to black to show me the interior.
---
I can see the headline now:
---
#Local man dies from alcohol poisoning. Sources say video game to blame. Thanks, Bethesda.
---
I have one and its garbage. Breaks after reloading a few times. I get wrecked when I use it in PVP. The other day someone with an auto explosive railway tore me to pieces against my BE laser rifle.
---
Poor guy. Should be able to work it out though of everyone is spawning in the same place...
---
I thought I was the only one that thought this.. pick up...pick up...pick up... (NOOOOOO, don't sit down).... argh!!!
---
I always LOVED when I seen the "You can't do this while in Power Armor.."!!!!!!! YES!!!! PA saved me..(from sitting)
---
I've always thought... what is the reason that the sit function is even in this game??? in fallout 4 you needed it for the "wait" feature.. FO76.. no reason.
---
Add KEAZAR and put everyone that wants to in s PS4 group and then send all the information there.
---
Usually good, what’s the primary prefix?
---
I feel like other players should spawn where you spawn when fast traveling to your camp.
---
Never accidentally have a nap in the Whitesprings golf club sleeping bags when you should be looting corpses. Very bad move...
---
Im pretty sure displaying junk was mentioned as well
---
full auto is for commando I believe
---
I'm struggling to find this, where abouts is it?
---
It's not overly exciting, my favourite one was built pre vendors but I'll see if I can get something uploaded later :)
---
THIS locking water and then selling it.  I just spent 8-20 caps to fast travel to your crappy shop plz offer me some water its sorta like validating parking.... its like pay toilets from the 70's really guys you want a dime for me to drop a deuce huh sounds like capitalism run a muck... Comrade Primeski Bot Activated
---
They just need to tweak more values of the legendary effects
---
And now it is back to 322!!!! No change since i posted this, just 10 minutes of game play with a different primed gauss. Love the variety Bethesda.
---
I got a furious explosive shot gun yesterday. I have no idea what they sell for tho. I'm specced into rifles so it's useless for me.
---
Good luck with the serums as a low level, the rads are going to get you and you will have to take a rad away or a shower at some point and that's wasted money/effort. 200 stims on a lvl5 player? good luck walking around. 
---
I think there are enough balance checks in the game that allowing transfers between characters will not break it. 
---
My biggest beef (and it isn't really a beef) is my wife being able to sell like crazy and needing a place to stash excess caps so she doesn't lose them. I have to change characters so she can stash her caps. CAMP location really does make a difference with vendor machines.
---
No trial and error, literally they spawn within a few feet of where you originally placed your camp down. If they didn't know that, they could just wait to see where a player spawns, or have a friend spawn there.
---
Think about it, anyone who's had vending a week knows exactly where players spawn. They have no incentive to build a trap, the only incentive anyone is given is to make sales
---
Basically: this isn't an issue currently, and there's no reason **to assume** it would suddenly become an issue.
---
And what's the worst case scenario? You lose a bit of junk? Most players have likely stored their junk before they go shopping either way.
---
Honestly, your scenario is just assuming the worst about people without any evidence whatsoever.
---
I have one, I get the damage glitch with it. Does too much damage and serverside freaks out and heals the enemies back. Quite annoying.
---
I don’t have very much patience either. But in the event I do I’ll put the really good legendary in the machine.
---
Just get a melee weapon and one shot everyone.
---
I just want custom factions, you know, how crews work in GTA maybe they could charge atoms for you to make custom faction skins for armors
---
Lever is semi auto, handmade can be semi or auto, for semi they use rifleman as Lever, for auto you need to use Commando perks.
---
My quad explosive Harpoon sits on 760ish dmg, 1050 with max Adrenaline, 1500+ while low on HP.
---
Not good for loads of enemies, amazing for killing bosses.
---
You picked up an item before it registered as a lost item. The item then identified, but it was already in your inventory. The quest only moves forward when you pick it up, and since already have it and can’t drop it, you are stuck. Happened to me too. 
---
To keep it from happening in the future, since the items are easy to identify without having the diamond in them, wait a second or two before picking it up until it lights up with the diamond. This will avoid that weird scenario where you pick it up too early.
---
I run both, handmade and lever action. Semi auto on the handmade. I run full rifleman and tank killer.
---
It sounded more like an issue on the user side
---
Commando and Tank Killer pretty much up to you if you want to sneak with bonus damage or vats if it’s your playstyle 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Ark.
---
You want Ark.
---
To be clear they would have to do an IMMENSE amount of work server-side to make this work properly.
---
Not to mention jack up console power as well.
---
Maybe in 5 years, optimistically?
---
cool idea
---
Not on right now but it had something to do with vats I think
---
Post 'it just works' whenever somebody mentions a bug. You don't even really need to read what they said.
---
Also why not a punch bowl style food bowl to share your cooked goods with your friends
---
If you didn't sell it I'll buy it
---
Thanks for letting me know. I knew it was true for wild plants, and several other people had confirmed it worked with their plants as well, so I was under the assumption it was.
---
***\*Wo***man.  But, yeah, the way my last few Friday nights have gone, I really shouldn't encourage myself to drink more heavily.  At least twice in the last month I have loaded my game up on a Saturday to find myself in the middle of nowhere with some broken armor, some fully repaired armor that I never equipped for one reason or another, a broken gun, an eclectic selection of junk, and too fat to move.
---
Just found this and it's amazing, **thank you so much!!** 😁
---
It's kinda weird that you see a 3star enemy and initially get pumped up just to realize it might as well be any legendary. Maybe they should give you something in addition, like a goody pack of randomized plans, bobble heads, mags, mods. Just so there's a reason to get excited about taking them down vs a 2star or regular legendary.
---
Damn.  So far I've gotten 2 - 3\* Urban pieces and 1 - 3\* forest from the purveyor..  Hoping to get a full set together for an alt but I need the weight reduction perks on them for weapons etc...  Been fishing for the mods also.
---
Go berserkers lol.
---
\&gt; a game that is supposed to be all about interaction has so many things preventing us from actually interacting 
---
Right you are.. Steam would have given us a working system from the start for at least getting in contact with peeps when we lost them.
---
I would definitely like to know the identity of the idiot who was like "Yep! All the Possum Challenges are bug free and ready to go!!!"
---
I wish I get 3* legendary every time I read this complain.
---
Id stay and fight with a pipe pistol, im level 90 though
---
i wouldn't bet on it. thats no interest for bethesda, as it would make things more complicated and destroy the atoms shop. I'd guess they will next year announce that they cannot do it for some technical reasons...
---
"Fuck" and slurs are very much *not* the same thing. This is kind of a lame post, OP.
---
Once, after trying for a good 15 minutes to find a server where my CAMP spot wasn't taken, I got fed up and just nuked the squatter's camp. It was a petty thing to do. Anyway, I figured with the 3 minute warning they'd have time to leave the server, but when I strolled through the nuke zone I realized I had razed their camp to the ground. Reading this post, I think they probably logged off, then logged back in only to have their carefully constructed camp blown to smithereens.
---
That was a little funny.
---
Don't forget about the high level players that just stand there and watch
---
Yeah it's been raining scorchbeasts lately
---
My camp is in (what I think) is a super neat spot... but every time I fast travel to it, I get stuck in a space in the middle of a rock wall and I have to fast travel to my own camp again to actually get there.
---
thanks for actively promoting pay to win...
---
Poor baby...
---
😆
---
The Enclave agrees with you. This is unacceptable.
---
Amen brother amen
---
same i recently open a teddy bear shop
---
It's the best gun for me with the mod. you don't even need ammo. it gives you more ammo than you shoot when you loot the body. I love it.
---
This is where a flare and some responsive players would be really useful. Shame I've never seen it happen.
---
Right?
---
Damn man..Gamertag? I would not mind some free items :)
---
Vats critical builds work wonders. Play sneaky and go for ambushes.
---
This gets requested like almost every day now. Do you guys even read what other people are posting or just come here and start spamming？
---
I tear most people with my B25 lmg. I have no issue with killing people and no issue with high damage weapons Be handmades whatever. It's just this one doesn't work right and easily the best weapon in PvP because of how broken it is.
---
I get em all the time when doing uranus fever
---
The excavator power armor adds +100 carry weight and you can mod it for more.
---
Yep. Just make it function properly like any other Be weapon
---
nice ideas, but holy crap. They can't even raise the stash limit above 800, so nevermind....
---
Been playing since beta but I've never seen one o.o
---
Tru lol
---
Would ya look at that, I never truly noticed that because I usually just scroll through the CAMP section.
---
Yeah they should have issued a replacement effect to this weapon and most energy weapons as a fix or just removed them outright
---
**Wendigo**-ing translates to "When the going."
---
When the going gets tough, the tough get shopping
---
Pricing legendary items is hard I recently sold an Instigating war drum for 1200 caps less then 15 minutes in my machine but my bloodied 10mm smg for 325 caps has been there for weeks.
---
I had guy there with gatling gun, he did 1% damage with each shot to alfa. I am melee, so i have to hit him twice and after geting agro run away, or i die.
---
I wonder what was this guy doing, because most of damage was done by turret i repaired. Ofcourse all animals died before we took him down. Applause for gatling gun man :D
---
Same.....with shards....
---
Pc
---
I would like an indicator of the average price they are charging for plans, so I can tell if they're idiots
---
Still, I would buy plasma grenade and robot legs plans even from an idiot and I have everything else so I guess it doesn't matter.
---
I have done that one yesterday and walked away with a ton of violet flux
---
Unfortunately everything that's not bloodied/ AA isn't worth it in PvP. Wish Bethesda would give other effects some love
---
Works but not in PvP
---
In the Cranberry bog there's a truck with a horse trailer full of Giddi-Up Buttercups you can only loot the ones in the Pick-Up truck bed but I got a laugh out of it
---
Sorry about that. I'm not sure why, but I just assume that everyone here is a guy. I googled this and thought I'd share the mildly amusing auto-fill [results](https://i.imgur.com/YunwCph.png).
---
Where?
---
If you’re signed up for the newsletter they’ll randomly send you a survey, I filled it out
---
Same here but vats can be wonky sometimes plus people use chameleon most of the time.
---
If it's part of a chem recipe you need to forage for it, just like in fo4.  Being able to plant anything would be a pretty significant balance shift toward making the game easier.
---
I was able to finish this mostly digging in junk piles and I think one was a reward from an event. It wasn't bad at all.
---
That was the only time I’ve fired a fat man.   It was so worth it even if every bit in the resort suddenly wanted my head.
---
I finally gave up and located in the forest
---
If theres an open invite I'd be interested in this too.
---
My first SBQ fight had a lot of players doing this strategy, beat it in 15 mins which i felt was quick for an end game boss.
---
Low level was selling a ton of lowlevel legendary weapons for the recommended base price so I got a few instigating and exploding and two shot weapons for like a total of 950 caps I don’t remember exactly what I got I don’t think he understood the worth of them
---
Holy cow huge ups to you! Lvl 9? I was still having someone wipe my ass at that level. Im level 35 now and still working on becoming a general. I couldn't imagine launching a nuke at lvl 9.
---
Just add the user nearest to that location and use them as a free fast travel point, if you're that cheap. 
---
(Also, there is a perk that lowers the price of fast traveling that I highly reccomend!)
---
Bethesda´s Cap sink together with 10% fee.

Probably hard to balance. My vampire's gatling already lets me ignore ground critters in a Queen battle. I can't imagine if it were tied to damage rather than a set amount per shot. I could stand in a fissure and be full health.
---
20days after i got 16badges, cool, not so hard :D
---
Fireproof protects you from the bitchscream. If low lvl and at workshop use spaced apart rocket turrets and wait till it lands to put down high rate of fire damage 👍 you CAN do it.
---
I’ve found armor and weapons for under 3 k that I’ve flipped for over 10k  profit. I feel like I’m on that yard sale/storage wars version of Fallout when I hit up player vendor
---
Thanks all now I'm excited to use it but it's 50 and I'm 48 so need to level
---
You should visit my camp, you'll cream your pants
---
Exactly! I just had to log off due to frustration of having 4 3* legendaries 3 not dropping anything other than aid and 1 dropped me a damn drill! Even if i scrapped that damn drill it would not give me enough materials to make the ammo used to take down that darn sheepsquatch.
---
It's a known bug that they responded to and are working on it. Its been a real pain with those scout missions for killing bugs. Hopefully its fixed soon.
---
Don't know if you're trying to correct me or you had a comment previously but I only used There/Their twice and they are both correct spelling since "Their" means ownership or as in person and "There" means non owned and specify something that's away...
---
On the Bridge the on the section of road I circled in the pic

Curious about your generator, damn rats always chewing mine, turret is useless lol
---
I see the source of your problem. Windows 7. You're using ancient tech bro.
---
I'm selling a tse combat shotgun I was lucky enough to vendor, along with a couple of decent three star weapons. On XBOX, gamertag bigstav if anyone wants it, it's for under 1k.
---
I really do recommend people hop servers more. I saw some advice on here about potential pools of legendary effects per server. I'd saved enough scrip to test a couple and boom, 2 x 2 shots (though the assault rifle isn't explosive).
---
Works for me. 15/1/2/9/11/14
---
Does not work unfortunately. Tested it myself.
---
Lol 3 lvl 80s is easy, 65s are the tough test of them outside the queen. Makes no sense as to why either.
---
The real end game battle is accidentally pissing off the White Spring bots. Killing those Sent Bots was a nice way to get some big XP during the double XP weekends.
---
I want a total number of stars the player is selling option to be shown
---
I run maxed Rifleman, maxed tank killer, maxed ninja and mister sandman (let's me do 165 x 3.5 at night before any of my legendary effects or buffs kick in).
---
Do you know if it was as mentioned along with the display stand release or were they different releases?
---
I'm pretty sure they have plans for ATLAS already in the long term scope of things.  There's no way they went to the effort to create that location and don't intend to have a quest associated with it.
---
I can pacify, but never tame
---
I have both whisper and friend maxed?
---
You've played enough to know. Quit wasting everyones time.
---
I hope, or else I’ve said 347 Teddy’s for nothing.
---
So....who's gonna add the Brazzers logo?
---
...
---
Is BlackBird back?
---
Any sweet mods for your lever action?  Can't find any! Got blessed with a legendary lever action with: tuned stabilized, suppressor and NV scope but still only gets 165 per shot and only 5 bullet cap.
---
Shit or get off the pot. If you want to play then play.
---
Np
---
This is the only way I've been able to kill him. Porting back to my base and my turrets are going nuts, and he's just standing there staring at me as they rip into him, then I managed to kill him before he could disappear. All the other times I've seen him (and the Flatwoods Monster) they disappear the first time I shoot them. Maybe it's because I'm a stealth build?
---
Unless they've changed their plans, they originally mentioned private servers were planned for the end of 2019. And having a private server doesn't mean cheats, just mods and server admin being able to adjust gather rate and stuff like you see on private servers with other games.
---
I imagine the closest to a "cheat" you might see, is the admin spawning 3* legendary monsters for tournaments or events and whatnot. But, if it's their server, that gives them the right to run it the way they want. It definitely isn't cheating, it'll just make everything that much more interesting.
---
Windows 7 was released in 2009. That is awesome.
---
Not yet.
---
You act as thought it was so very long ago that you played.
---
&gt;Will I be able to do to Pioneer Scouts quests still?
---
Bethesda MD is not working on 76, it is a small team in Austin. MD is working on the next game.
---
TBH I'm not sure I thought they were one and the same
---
This.  Sorry man but seriously.
---
I love using those, you can get so creative with overlaying them on existing signs, but damn they eat up the budget.
---
A [fallout 4 mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/17945/?) that would do exactly this, also let's you use chems in the world as well. I wish Bethesda just took a few months to implement quality of life improvements that mods added to their games years ago. It's so simple, just adds an R option when hovering over a comsumable to just use it right away.
---
It's getting a little tired playing the game where you just run like hell away from the spawn point the second you can move after you FT in.
---
It's just for sitting and that's it but I can be used to give the mindset of letting your character relax.
---
Power Armor saved me alot of times.
---
Seriously,  if we’re spawning into a nuke zone,  shift us out of it to the nearest non-nuked fast travel point.
---
There's a fallout 4 mod that was made years ago that does this.
---
Yeah I dont get that, no sense in locking their doors....
---
Mypeesacisfull killed them all.
---
Nop
---
What a great idea! :)
---
My time may be off but I'm behind on news. A lot has happened with vendors dungeons and leaks.
---
Anything cool new to the store?
---
I did that last night and it pushed me under their building so I couldnt go anywhere, had to spend more caps to spawn back at the nearest train station....
---
Wow the community has fully fallen into toxicity huh. Shame it came to this.
---
You know the phrase “when the going gets, the tough get going” it’s a slight adaption. Wendigo(the ghoul type) sounds like When-the-go so when-di-go-ing gets tough, the tough get going or in this case shopping...as it’s a trade post
---
YOU PICKED THE WRONG VALLEY FOOL
---
Can anyone tell me how to get back into my armor suit after I've gotten out of it and took it with me
---
Always enjoyable to see the space program alive and well!
---
next game? wdym? also how do I start it.
---
My friends and I came across a big mob of glowing rad stags when someone nuked the toxic valley for some reason. Walked over a hill and there they were, all clustered together. We ate well.
---
https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1039890-fallout
---
Just the pack? Archery, Athletics, Mammalogy imo
---
so just got this back from them after all this going back and forth so looks like i'm done with the game for now....
---
Greetings,
---
 
---
Brian here with Bethesda Customer Support.
---
Due to a recent update Customer Support no longer has the ability to reset quests for Fallout 76. At this time we have exhausted all known troubleshooting for the issue you are experiencing and we recommend that you await for a future update to the game to resolve the quest issue you are facing.
---
We deeply apologize for any inconvenience that this causes and we thank you for your understanding.
---
Dude I'm just trying to ask a fucking question. The community has devolved so much. Theres no comradery amoung us anymore.
---
My "I think dogs should vote" sign is a piece of my camp that I love most, but it eats up the budget of a sizeable decorated room.  So I'm definitely down for this change.
---
I think it’s a Bobby pin
---
Jump at the end and bash in mid air it kinda works
---
star field. Bethesda MD is the main studio that Todd Howard works at, he isnt working at the Austin Texas Bethesda
---
NP. I tested a bunch of stuff like that with a friend when we first got the game. Seems most containers (including harvesting nodes like plants/ore veins/etc) are instanced, but power armor, fusion generators, and most random stuff lying around isn't. I try not to strip a place bare anymore now that I know that.
---
Also brahmin aren't instanced for some reason. Once somebody milks one it won't give milk to anyone else for a ridiculously long time, which can make getting your mammalogist badge a real pain.
---
Nukashine is the best tour guide.
---
Fireproof lvl 3 eliminates almost all damage from the screams. Once you have this then it’s just patience. Shoot at them a bit and wait for them to land
---
Very sorry I do not know what I say before hand but I do remember seeing "their" in a place that would use "there"
---
Oh yeah. Damn. I really need my fix for a good rpg in the fallout franchise. We haven't had one since fo4. How do I start the quest.
---
I'd rather it be "exploitable" in the old way. I liked the feeling of danger when I owned a workshop. Usually caught people before they got me because I was constantly aware of my surroundings. But whiners ruined that.
---
go to the pioneer camp near grafton and there will be a mister handy near the lodges
---
They used to be under Animal Friend, but I’m pretty sure they are no longer tameable.
---
There is always a Behemoth in the Twin Lakes
---
They weigh nothing and sell for a cap each. I hardly ever pick locks, but I wait til I have 100 or so and sell them. Bobby pins get a 10/10.
---
You can get a bowie knife skin in game as far as I know it's scout paint but still unique. But would love more options.
---
Not a problem, I'm guilty of the same, depending on the subreddit.  I always assume that people on r/skincareaddiction and r/breadit, for instance, are women even though I know it's not the case. 
---
But we're *doing our best* lmao
---
No, the Reddit community is tired of people asking should I play or should I come back and additional threads of that variety.
---
If you have paid for the game already there is nothing stopping you from playing again besides your own hesitations and hang ups.
---
I don’t want this; stop trying to speak for me, I don’t even know you.
---
And then I reread your post. And realized this did not apply.
---
That’s not true IN the slightest.  There’s an issue with people who are terrible yes, but this community still very much so helps people who need help.  Your question is a little silly, you’ve played most of the game clearly.  The only event that isn’t available anymore is Fasnacht and they made it super clear that it was an annual thing.  Why on earth would Pioneer Scouts just come up then disappear when it was always going to be part of long term content?  Frustrations about these posts come from the fact that most of the questions can be answered by going into your search bar or using google.  We haven’t devolved, we’re just calling out the ones who don’t pay attention.  If you’re posting on here it’s pretty easy to assume you lurk.  If you lurk, search.  If you search, you’ll avoid answers like these ones.  No one can tell you how to feel about a video game.  Play it and find out yourself.
---
Last time i sat uncomfortably close to max caps for long enough i just went and bought a mutation recipe for 18k from the bunker.
---
Uh, all my different lasers and plasmas do insane damage
---
We need a “bank” to open up in some town with a stash limit of 100-200
---
If it was my camp you saw, it's not the remove bug, I'm just lazy.
---
New Appalachian Train Yard, on top of a building on the east side of town.
---
Ok so I can't ask? Can't get information? Almost like that's what reddit is for huh.
---
geez.. I've yet to see ONE of those things...
---
I've never tried... but from my understanding if you put a ticket and tell em you got the wrong one and you want to switch they might... I assume everyone get one haha
---
Crossbow damage isn't that bad. It works with rifle perks. Rate of fire and lack of mods is what holds it back.
---
&gt; If they didn't know that, they could just wait to see where a player spawns, or have a friend spawn there.
---
thats exactly what im saying....  your theory imlies that people are sitting around trying to watch where people spawn, which would likely take a lot of time...
---
Pioneer scouts is playable somewhat solo abd I feel like it was enjoyable. When you need to revive someone just ask a random person if they don't want to do it move on to another person.
---
Where is that guy again? I saw him when I was like level 20 and that's the first time I really screamed out loud in Fallout 76 trying to run from him.
---
Only the wild versions of crops change- all the rest just get destroyed.
---
Also let us use fist weapons in PA!
---
He was hiding in a small Lake or pond
---
Hahaha I love this post.  A+ and very accurate.
---
I lock the door to the upstairs. All it has access too is my fusion generator and the turrets but marsupial will allow someone to jump up on the deck.  It’s simply there because there is no reason for anyone to need to go up there. Everything you need is on the main floor.
---
Ya one doesnt cut it Haha.
---
My 2* vampires/ffr LMG effectively already does this.  Last night during AWOL Armaments I tanked 11 gutsys at once, two were 3*.  Cant even imagine how OP this is on a minigun or better yet a ffr minigun.
---
I'm not playing. I have a life. I don't just lurk or keep up when I am not playing. I was asking because I trust human opinion more. Idk what the fuck happened to this place.
---
How? Vampire and bloodied are both primary prefixes.
---
lol, i am dying, hahaha
---
Still waiting for this game to be a game
---
Bla bla bla, another essay of crap that’s been said a million times over already.
---
Haven't heard anything. :(
---
A bank would be a great way to do this. A safe deposit box that players need to buy, an account for caps and another for scrip. Don't want to do it don't, seems simple enough.
---
...not yet anyway
---
People can grind for the plan and sell it, I know cause I've done just that.
---
&gt; how the magazine racks, bobbleheads, gun mounts, ect. take up so much room in their stash
---
This will be the problem with display items. Stash space is scarce, so as much as I want to collect and display all bobbleheads, I don't want to pay the 1.00 for each single one from my stash. Same for teddy bears, etc. I struggle with stash space enough as it is, thus I ended up scrapping my entire teddy bear collection. As a collector at heart, this saddens me.
---
don't get all filth casual on me and start downvoting because you hate someone questioning Bethesda.
---
Buying the letters was my worst purchase. Started writing a logo for my shop and ran out of camp space by the fourth letter. Now it will take that much longer to get the serum recipes I need!
---
If anyone reading hasn’t bought them yet, I’d recommend holding off. They’re currently not as useful as they might first seem.
---
The submachine gun doesn't necessarily need a damage boost, it needs a fire rate increase. 2x faster fire would make it worth while
---
If only there were a real life market for used bobby pins...
---
I did the same.
---
It's a nice spot, but the neighbors can be a bit cranky when woken up.
---
Go through all the posts of any given day. These same “should I play” or “is it good yet” questions come up, no shit, like 30x a day. To us on the sub the answers obvious and we don’t feel like singing it’s praises over and over and over. Yes we have fun playing it. No, we’re not toxic because we’re brushing the 20th same question aside. Just play the game or down. You shouldn’t need the backing of anonymous internet people
---
I believe I still have it.
---
Huh, I wonder what other enemies I haven't seen/heard of.
---
Hahaha you think that we all don’t have lives?  I have a very wonderful life thank you,  full of promise and happiness.  That doesn’t excuse the fact that you could’ve searched in the SEARCH bar which is for SEARCHING.  There are 40,000,000 posts like this.  You’ll get the answer you’re going to disagree with anyway from a human.  Don’t shit on the community for explaining to you that the community is sort of tired of seeing these posts.  🤷🏼‍♀️
---
I am blessed to have a good bunch that run bunkers everyday, after grabbing commendations I just followed behind and stayed out of the way XD
---
Well that's lame. Thanks for letting me know!
---
It's subjective, but I think it should say
---
" The tough go shopping" because it's "go" in wendingo
---
Best part is it does not take long to recap your investment I sell mine for 225 caps and I always sell out quickly plus I sell 3 a day to the vendors.
---
Without legendary effects, lasers do little damages on the ennemies tho. The Gatling Laser is good tho.  
---
Plasma lacks a bit of punch for its slow projectile speed and the rarity of ammoes. It's more about fitting the rarity of the gun and the ammoes (even if they aren't extremely rare in F76)   
---
Some balancing i point at is just some small buffs &amp;/or tweaks.  
---
Plasma is far from being the most urgent weapon to balance there.
---
Of course i have tested a lot of weapons, but haven't played ALL of them extensively.  For Plasma i haven't tested it much, just that I remember it didn't feel that right.
---
Use the search bar. It’s been asked and people’s opinions are out there. We just don’t need new posts about it every few minutes
---
Car Henge, like Stonehenge but with Cars.
---
North of the giant Red Rocker truck stop.
---
If only there were in-game hair bands, my wife would be a wasteland billionaire
---
I'm on now if you'd like to trade
---
We should probably wait till it’s released or at least get a better taste of what’s to come before we start taking a dump on it. People in this sub for some reason love complaining about every aspect of this game, it seems like that’s what’s popular here right now. I think a lot of YouTubers that cover fo76 have got these kids whipped up into a frenzy over content that we know little about.
---
Or poison!
---
Set up a computer terminal tied into your power grid. You can use it to turn the switch on/off, and you can lock the terminal like a door. Then you don't need a door on your power room at all.
---
Well thanks for your comment. You can leave and go back to your legendary explosives.  
---
I guess you haven't played grenade &amp; missile launcher a lot lol. Or tried killing high level stuff with a non legendary flamer.
---
Literally 3 things have happened.  Vendors, Project Paradise and Berkeley.  THREE THINGS.
---
I'd just be happy if they just moved stimpacks into the meds tab and added a new category for Clothing vs. Armor. Nothing worse than camp hopping for a new 3\* right arm and all anyone ever has are 17 faschnacht masks and a fedora.
---
Mind if I add you on PS4?
---
What did they add?
---
GoT vibes
---
Does she still have fewer HP if a lower level person spawns her in?
---
Good have time delays to make it more leveled or make garden plans for them
---
Give me your junk!
---
I don't know what any of that means.
---
Not going to happen. This gets requested at least once every few weeks. They’ll never ever do this so stop asking ffs.
---
Ahhh...did this dude steal something from you during a trade?
---
You just listed it off in your own post haha those are things that have happened.  SEARCH THE FRIGGEN SUB DUDE.  Are you a food build?
---
I’m not sure the original poster is playing the same game I am.
---
Some things I agree on ...
---
 - Nocturnal sucks
---
 - Berserker and Junkie could use a pass (he doesn’t mention junkie)
---
Some things not mentioned
---
 - Durability on lasers, flamers more important than damage increase. 
---
 - Harpoon and broadsider issues are that they are gimmicky. Instead of damage, etc. give them some sort of non-damage boost (limb damage, better stagger, etc.)
---
 - Explosives need durability more than damage increase
---
 - Flamer also needs durability. My legacy explosive flamer is awesome. No other flamer I have is better than a plasma w/ a flamer barrel. Still needs better ammo crafting options.
---
Assassin’s weapons are completely useless, 10% extra damage against the best protected enemies in the game, no wonder people dump them as soon as they find one. 
---
And they might as well rename all the two-shot weapons One-Point-Two-Shot. Two projectiles equal 1.25x damage, amazing math in order to nerf the most duped weapons.
---
My BE Harpoon does 4100 Damage with no Chems.  It one shots almost anything from any distance you can view the mob (console).  LMG uses .308 Damage which isn’t hard to make once you Prime the gun and make ultracite 308.  The gun itself is the highest dps gun in the game in regards to SBQ fight.  Some of your points are spot on, some unfortunately are not so accurate.
---
I am a bloodied build but if I farm White Spring I always put power armor on before I server hop otherwise I am dead before I even finish loading in.
---
Yeah, the damage buff could come from the rate of fire. But it would make them even harder to use in the lower levels tho'.  
---
All the buffs could come by other tweaks : Easier to farm/loot/craft ammoes, rate of fire, weapon durability etc..
---
The use of Wendigo is purely for the “when the go” part of it and “go” is mid word. So it’d be a bit odd to change the phrase even further from the original when the “go” part of wendigo isn’t a focal point
---
That wouldn't tell you anything imho. Most of my plans are 25-100 but I have a couple of rare ones for 1-2k.
---
the communication has been vague but I think in the patch notes it mentioned them being together.
---
Yeah, if I get lucky and get all 6 can traps by the lodge and the 3 in the building behind it plus scrapping weapons with scrapper I can turn over 400 steel per hop and almost a hundred lead
---
Saw one guy posted BAIT in Greek letters on one his vendor machines. Opened it to reveal that it was stacked with non-legendaries. Ya got me! Hardy har har, ya fuggin doof!
---
The rest of his plans and other junk were shite, btw.
---
I agree with OP, more specific previews would be great to deal with passive aggressive griefers...
---
It is annoying, but move your camp a bit, and it clears it up. You can move it and move it back if needed. Odd foundation snapping
---
I guess you mean "freed from his cage" ;-)
---
This. With scrapper, I usually finish uranium fever with 300+ steel after scraping all the weapons I picked up. Lots of steel junk in that area as well for fixing the extractors.
---
What the hell is Atlas? I haven’t played for a few weeks.
---
Yeah but like what about the leaks and whats the 2 other things after the vendor. And no why.
---
Combat Shotgun no question.
---
Do you sell products...or services?
---
Dude, honestly... no salt here.  Just... fire up the game and play it. It's a game. Not a job. 
---
If you have time to play video games... play this one and make up your own mind. If you don't have time to play games, then why ask?
---
Not just buy the safety deposit box, you rent it. You have to rent it in real life, you don't pay a one time fee and just have it. If you want that ability you pay for it and keep paying for it or lose the ability to do it.
---
I’d like to see some of the shotgun perks and maybe heavy put into endurance. STR has too many weapon categories. Also maybe Thru Hiker from AGI.
---
Personally I’d go with the quad, instigating is normally better for guns with a higher damage, quad however is always useful
---
Responder stuff finally
---
It depends on whether you’ll use vats a lot.  If you do the Quad is best.  But instigating is good as well.  I love my Quad explosive out of all my 10 shotguns, I use VATS and it hits every time.
---
Yes I hate getting stuck. Thanks for posting this
---
Some PA sets.. but a few skins for the fire ax...  and some CAMP stuff... but it looks they put alittle work into this one
---
ATLAS will probably have something to do with the Zetans at some point, I imagine...
---
I've never seen messages/notes requested, just an in-game chat. 
---
This would be a lot easier to implement, especially if you had to go to the players terminal to leave a message.
---
Super annoying
---
A minigun does the same damages with 2 to 3 bullets \^\^'.   
---
Crossbow lacks of a lot of damages for a single shot weapon. Or maybe instead of a damage buff, it could get a higher sneak damages multiplier for example.
---
WOW.. thank you very much! Will definitely take a look into this next time I go down there.
---
That's a hard choice but I feel the double damage from the instigating would be better then ammo capacity.
---
Heeey, you built on my spot there
---
Hahaha I can’t.  I’m sorry but I just cannot 😂😂😂
---
Adrenaline is really great mechanic. I try to not immediately kill all the adds so that people can get their stacks, but many players just focus fire the queen. Oh well, at least I'm getting xp :)
---
I could have probably figured a way out, but I was pretty inebriated after celebrating the Raptors win over the Bucks. 
---
I sort of just sat there and took it lol.
---
Prices usually really vary by platform tbh
---
Both ;-) 
---
Combat for most PVE. Bring out the Quad for boss fights.
---
I agree, but I think it is more important if WE spawn there. I spawn, die of instant rads, bc I’m not in PA bc my pit boy is still loading and I loose all my junk bc someone spawned there also, but with PA. 
---
Please fix this Bethesda! 
---
And thanks again for posting this
---
The problem is even if a full set of Power Armour gave a flat 50% damage reduction across the board, high damage builds like bloodied would still be able to kill you in 1-3 hits. 
---
The only way I see power Armour being useful endgame would be if they could drop as legendary gear. Maybe have different effects compared to regular Armour, that would fit into a "tank" build/playstyle.
---
spawning in to a locked room is my favorite.
---
My BE does 4100 with 3/5 adrenaline active. No chems but I am under 20% health when using it.  It will kill anything in one hit with the exception of bosses and a SB.
---
Man it's rough. I got fucking OCD and ADD which can massively impact how my brain works around the game. I just wanted to ask on a sub that used to not care and got pms of verbal abuse right away and a ton of people getting pissed.
---
If you used the search function, multiple people have mentioned responses and explanations.
---
That's why when I moved my camp this weekend, I made sure I put the spawn point literally right in front of the door to my shop. Only problem: it's too close and people turn around and start running the opposite direction before realizing it. I may have to move my shop another square back from the spawn point now.
---
Yeah, I've been doing this.  I found 5-6 being sold in vending machines yesterday and snapped them up.  I'm just waiting...
---
Nah they were puss in FO3. 
---
Down in Vegas on the other hand you couldnt get me to go within a mile of Sloan without my 50 cal and explosive rounds + stealth suit.
---
If your a gunslinger then you can skip the speed deamon perk yes.
---
Yeah- why do people sell non-legendary weapons anyway? I can see 2 scenarios- 1) super cheap low level weapons in the Forest for newer players 2) good inexpensive scrappable weapons. I’d buy a ton of cheap Tesla rifles if I found them
---
Prices vary way too much, and are constantly changing. Even if somebody could get you a magical spreadsheet with the wide, WIDE possible range of prices for every item in the game, that spreadsheet would be useless by next week
---
Toss both into the scrip machine
---
Ping - my in-game name is Deyren
---
Yes, please let us know before we die of rads and lose all pure junk!!
---
The same thing happened to me a few days ago, but it wasn’t dead...
---
I saw that yesterday as well! Best I can figure, it’s around the start of Free Range for the forest. Not sure if it’s meant to mark anything else. 🤔
---
Agreed!
---
What? Wow! I had no idea these bad boys were in '76? Ive been playing since January and I have never ever saw 1, much less 3. Thanks for posting bro.
---
Well, it all depends on the size of your camp. If you have three stories like me, then it may seem less appealing then someone with just a garage
---
... when people ask you what time it is and they have their phone in their hand....
---
Well as I said, i maybe forgot a bunch of stuff, like junkie for example (I'll add it thanks to you). I also found out i forgot the legendary effects for armor (i'll add it  a bit later).  
---
Also i mainly listed the problems, my solutions are suggestions that can be changed/debated.  
---
Durability &amp; Damages could be good for flames &amp; lasers. But damages aren't to be left behind : You point out your "legacy" explosive flamer. Without explosive, flamers have more than a durability problem.  
---
Explosives (Not the legendary effect, but launchers) lack of punch compare to their low reload speed, their high weight (compensated by perks) and the rarity (and weight) of their ammoes. 2 plasma grenades are more effective than a Fatman.
---
Yessssss!!! Harvest Allllllll!!!
---
It’s the po po!  RUN!
---
I'm not an avid pvp'er, but I've had pretty good luck defending myself  with a tesla rife.
---
Old? These black powder weapons use percussion caps. That's pretty much as new as you can get! 
---
What I would give for a matchlock. I wouldn't accept it without the NV jam mechanic as a substitute for when the powder fails to ignite.
---
You can only tame creatures that spawn at random encounters. They also must only be one of them.
---
This! Another QOL add that would be much appreciated!
---
Ping from Deyren
---
Those are my standard prices but I haven’t sold a single one. People always buy the guns and plans though.
---
T_T I sorry. lol
---
In fairness, if someone home-brews a fix due to all the provided dumps, then it's still valuable in *that* regard! :)
---
Give me those cranberries and pumpkins! 💖
---
You can’t pacify megasloths but you can still tame them. I actually tamed one earlier today. I was asking about megasloths because I wanted two pets but I realize now that’s not possible
---
Good luck getting close enough against most top tier PvPers. That being said, melee is the most fun imo.
---
Well, the beauty of this game is this... play it how you want, man. You know this. Who gives a shit about vendors, nobody says you need to use them. Never leave the forest if you don't want to. Never do a single DLC mission. Become the king of cans and collect nothing tin cans. 
---
Look, should you return? In my 40+ years of playing video games, there are MAYBE 5 games that have managed to get under my skin like this one. I've got multiple characters, over 200 hours, my highest character is still only lvl 32. Just.. play it, man. You' either dig it, or you don't. 
---
I think it's the vagueness of your question that bugs folks.
---
No, the other one. Smoking first?
---
I see a lot of people complaining about accompanying pets - do you guys and girls realize that they are gonna introduce a caps-based robot rental with all those robot stations? 
---
why is a cat follower NOT OK yet no ones complaining that we will have modded up assaultrons followers for rent. . .
---
The way I like to think about it is, the blade itself is what the Assaultron has on its arm, but the handle and hilt is fashioned to it, and as with most things in the apocalypse, very crudely so, with pieces of things found around the environment, so your character just found one of those, detached from a wall, and whatever it was was the perfect thing to hold a handle and the blade together.
---
IKR, why do mods even need to exist? I wish the same game developers would realize this and make it happen.
---
It would also be nice if they sell a potion that get rid of all negative effects at once, I’d pay a few caps for it. Then I can free up the slots occupied by Class Freak while enjoying only the positive effects of all mutations.  Anything that makes the game super easy is welcomed by me.
---
Well there's a new excavator skin, white n red, has a fireman theme to it, a new flamer skin that has a fireman, american theme to it, new skins for the pump action shotgun being responder themed, a fire axe paint set and a new full outfit called stalker outfit, which seems to be made of tires and tarp, a very rubbery look to it may I say.
---
You're not going to VATS most top tier PvPers. Against the uninitiated however,  youi'll be a walking paragon of death.
---
Wonderful idea! But could it be free? Haha
---
i didnt know you could buy something twice.. 
---
I thought it turned to owned after you buy it..
---
I can foresee them opening up the atom shop in a way like they did with F4 creation kit mods. 
---
A move to “Curated UGC”. 
---
I think it might come in hand with steam release. They’d be fools not to leverage steam workshop.
---
It’s never going to be granular enough. I’d like to see an option to just type a shop description that will display on the map. Sure, people could lure you in with BS, but they could also just stock 25 3* lead pipes. Most will make a legit pitch for their shop.
---
there is a legendary quad shot crossbow.  Don't recall the damage spec on it though.
---
Imagine if all the houses in towns were able to be camped in and we could literally create communities.
---
Sure, that's why it's a personal preference. I think the rhyming symmetry works better with go, and if you're already modifying the phrase, there's no reason to hold back, so long as it's still recognizable.
---
Either way, great looking camp, I hope I come across it in the wild. Personal camp decoration makes it fun to visit other campus, and yours is a great example!
---
Getting downvoted for imagination. Classic Reddit.
---
No no, I just wanted to ask him about something.
---
Way too powerful.
---
I have one in my camp by a lovely fireplace, you can use my camp as a photo shoot anytime lol
---
I don't see how they could charge for it...
---
Unless you mean caps
---
ive been fast traveling to the closest place i can and just walking over.
---
That also makes a lot of sense. That is a good idea
---
funny I had a max lvl 1 star instigating powerfist with the puncturing mod already added to it for 800 caps and it took 2 weeks to sell.. this is basically a one shot pve weapon and no one wants for 800 caps
---
Nawh, i was dying. Too much, that place is hell!
---
No there is no mods.. or ammo type... and yes it is a heavy gun
---
&lt;3
---
There was a challenge to collect an American flag.   10 atoms was the reward commemorating the honored dead.
---
Also, I'm thinking they base it off the BASE damage of the weapon, not when all effects are applied to it
---
Apparently I somehow really fucked up then... cause I know I owned it, only new thing is the pipboy skin
---
Some good points but I just crafted 2000ish rounds for my quad cryolator it's not hard to craft the ammo and 5mm with Super Duper and Ammo Smith you get 180 rounds for 30 lead not including what you get from Super Duper.
---
Yeah I have one, haven't got the chance to use it though
---
You'll get a 1 combat knife, and you'll be happy about it!
---
I have a vampire's plasma thrower. It deals insane damage. It has no damage-boosting legendary effects, the vampire's just keeps me alive after sprinting to enemies. It takes out a landed scorchbeast in like 5 seconds
---
Damn, still good tho, just got a BE + Faster reload one, lvl 50, any idea of the value?
---
I usually have 20-25 legendary weapons for sale and fill the spaces with handmades, levers and Fixers. I just leave them at face value and they sell. They could be getting scrapped, but they definitely sell.
---
The house with all the cat bowls.
---
It’s also funny to note that the entrance door to the hotel inside of of the enclave bunker doesn’t open on to the first floor of the hotel, that means there’s some kind of off screen elevator that takes us from the bunker up into the hotel.
---
I was just saying this last night how there needs to be more of a super mutant boss quest besides the uneventful one within westek. I’m only aware of the one spawn of a behemoth. I would be very excited to have the ability to fight more then one along with seeing legendary ones which I have encountered once at the spawn in the lake but it’s very rare. I have seen them a few times in nuke zones mainly in the savage divide but if there was something like a triggered event outside westek or maybe somewhere in the bog where multiple behemoths spawned with a huge horde of supermutants that would be an amazing battle.
---
I’m already thankful if the 3 star enemies don’t drop wood or drill. Did one SBQ last week got a wood piece, did one imposter sheepsquatch last week, also a wood piece. It was completely my fault for going to those events and wasting thousands of rounds.
---
This guy Widgeon TV on YouTube has a video that is a general pricing... but yea its different across the platforms
---
Yeah, I have mine set up as a small village, which is my choice. I could have removed a building in order to set up my shop with its neon sign, but at the current rate I’d rather just add that much more detail to my camp than use an eighth or so of my budget on letters.
---
Yeah. I found that some players do mistakenly  chase stars over effect. That is definitely an end game weapon that you would struggle to replace with anything besides a swing speed upgraded version of it. Even then, swing speed wouldn't give you much benefit as most everything dies from 1 hit.
---
Just did a little research. Supposedly the first percussion rifle the U.S adopted was manufactured by the armourer in... Harper's Ferry. Neat.
---
Todd, please. This need to stop.
---
If you're on xbox I'll give you 500 for the bloody smg.
---
My "button press" gripe is backing out of a workbench, only to activate again due to an overzealous button press.
---
100%. With 3 ranks of Fireproof Scorchbeasts are a nuisance at most. Once they land you can basically faceroll them with a plain combat shotgun to the face.
---
(I was referring to the *game series* Battlefield, my man).
---
But I'm all for Buccaneer weaponry!
---
Fast travel mats.
---
I just started. made a new character this morning. still figuring things out, having fun.
---
Honestly no.. but what platform.. cuz if ya on xbox I'll pay or trade for it.. been waiting for a decent one
---
Haha my fav one is this guy who built his base on a giant mountain and the users spawn point is at the bottom of the hill. I wonder if he has super low prices because he's like why isn't this selling?
---
You need to put them in the machine outside. ;)
---
Only buy. No sell.
---
Equally annoying
---
(Me playing my disease ridden Plague Walker character)
---
Doesn’t seem that bad if you ask me.
---
No, I'll just downvote you as you're a dumb cunt
---
oh yes, forgot about that spawn point treat.
---
Ohhh thank you
---
You put them in the machine outside. You get scrips and use those to get stuff from the purveyor.
---
“WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN OUR SWAMP”
---
It's already monetized. Nothing stops you from supporting veterans or being thankful for the sacrifices people made for you during the other 364 days of the year. This is just the day for which people are encouraged to buy things to feel better
---
The exPA.. yea I know.. but I'm glad we got some weapon skins, that outfit... now I wish that outfit was a event prize, yea.. but it's been the best "set" of things we've gotten in awhile
---
Are any of the new weapon skins limited time only?
---
So will that just control the strobe or will the strobe set all other lights to blink with it?
---
I've only ever beaten this event once. Every other time I get a fail randomly, even when all the animals are alive.
---
Please dont tell me that they are doing a SuperDuper  Mart blue light special out there...
---
“Mom, it’s my turn to post this”
---
And mods are not allowed in F76 and it will end with you being banned
---
Usually triggers for me if I fast travel to Vault Tech U. and walk directly to the shop to where Steelheart is. Feed the People always triggers, but Back on the Beat does as well, about every other time. Usually happens when I'm actually in the shop. I have never done either event and I'm level 50. Get bent Sanjay, I'm just here for the screws.
---
In the meantime, play in survival to level up your alt. If you stack well rested, meat stew, and cranberry food on top of the survival xp bonus you level up fairly quickly. In my experience, most folks on survival don't fuck with low level players unless you claim a workshop or gain enough xp to find yourself on the leader board, and even then, the penalty for dying is minimal as long as you aren't wandering around with too much junk and aid.
---
I killed the Flatwoods monster, but found him completely by accident. I was by a mine entrance just looking for a new base location.
---
Saw this weird thing, walked towards it, saw the name, and killed it. I'm primarily a melee build at this point. Now sure if that makes a difference.
---
Why do you keep putting a 's' at the end of damage?
---
Don’t make adjustments to PVE world because of desires of PVP players.
---
Like Minecraft and fire enchanted swords!
---
*you're.
---
God, I don't thank you enough for presenting me with legions of fucking idiots to dunk on.
---
EDIT: Yes, they actually mispelled "you're" in the same sentence as calling someone a dumb cunt.
---
On ps4, Think im gonna use it for a while as a backup wep or for pvp 🤣
---
They seem to snap to the sides.  For instance, if you're snapping one character to the right of another character, you need to be on the right side of the first character.  If you're on the left side, you won't see the right "side" of the first character that you want to snap it to and it'll decide to place it directly on the wall beside the first character, but not snapped to it.
---
Explosive plasma rifles and pistols do not exist, though.
---
Dang haha... well good hunting
---
I’ve been playing 76 for quite a bit. Level 74 and I still love the game
---
I just dumped 250 springs to make room in my stash I get a ton from farming Yao Guai but I would of bought all 800 acid. I recently came across 80 ballistic fiber for 10c each I bought all of them.
---
You were probably trapped in a falling animation, I've had that happen to me before. They don't allow you to fast-travel from falling, which I presume is to prevent you from avoiding death from a long drop.
---
I was at a student art sale once and someone's very abstract somewhat obtuse painting was for sale with the price tag of 250000..  I believe they were making a statement art does not equal commerce.  Having said that it would have been fun if I was super rich to buy this painting only to see the look on their face and Im pretty sure they would have cashed that cheque  principles out the window when dollar bills involved----
---
Would be especially as good if you could connect it to an ore extractor somehow and have it auto smelt the ores as they come out
---
Yeah, but I didn't, so I'll just wait for answers here.
---
Thanks bud!
---
I'll never know though, not spending 10 mins to scale a mountain.
---
It's a bug inherited from Skyrim dragons.
---
Saw a flatwoods at level 1 lol. Shot it with pipe bolt action for no damage and shat myself but he teleported away
---
Hello, Satan.
---
In situations like this it's better to "sell" the item instead. You sell the AAE 50cal for 20k caps. Other play then sells you the item you want for 20k caps. At the end of the day, you both have the same amount of money you started with, and you each have the item. Worst case scenario, if they try to rob you it'll cost them 20k.
---
15 or 20 high level scorched guarding a couple of ultracite veins @ WS.

if you stand in the doorway of the clubhouse, every enemy in the building will come to the door to greet you..

Thanks for dropping that subreddit-- I'm new here. :)
---
&gt; maxed ninja 
---
Isn't that for melee? I would use Covert operative for rifles.
---
I did it 3times first day. Got nothing interesting. Well, atleast i was able to finish that event, cause since that i failed every single time, not because i am weak, but because it is badly done. I hope they do some balance to that event, it could be top endgame content.
---
This is untrue. Vats critical builds are exceptionally powerful and the most reliable way to kill sentinel users prenerf.
---
Critical hits ignore all armor. It is like a form of pure damage. It is better than anti armor. It just ignores the armor altogether.
---
Make it a pub! "Wendigo Inn... Gets tough the tough get drinking"
---
I'm not, but can jump on.
---
That’s what I meant, sorry
---
But then we wouldn't have had the *fantastic* bethesda launcher to advertise other games to us.
---
I wish bugs and balancing was a higher priority...
---
It always starts for me when show up in the vicinity.
---
That would be difficult.  Players set the prices based on too many factors and the random nature of when they join, platform, where their camp is, etc.  You would need an in-game system to keep track of this.
---
I tend to base my pricing on a fraction or multiple of the game value system.  For example, I sell plans for about half of what the game values them at with the exception of the building sets (i.e. barn, wharehouse, etc.) and specific harder to find plans which I set at the game value.
---
Legendary weapons I set a bit above their game value as I tend to mod them for the most popular setups and feel that this is a value-add and should make some profit on them.  
---
My strategy is to make an extra 1K to 2K caps per gaming session and to give others an opportunity to buy good legendary items at a decent price.  I'm probably leaving caps on the table, but I'd rather good stuff be put to good use rather than trade it in or try to make a killing off of it.
---
Power armor gang
---
Correct me if I’m wrong, but if you spawn after the nuke, your camp is ok, I did it a few times. Which means you spawn and then the nuke landed, correct?
---
Oh, is that where it is?  I had a screenshot of it, but couldn't remember where it was.
---
There's another space around that area up on a hill with a trailer and fencing.  It's actually a valid CAMP space too.  It would be an interesting place to build, if there was a little more going on in the NE corner of the map.
---
turn off the ones you arent currently following
---
Heh... I've been down in the robotics section when somebody upstairs started causing problems. The number of bots they can manufacture on short notice is mind-boggling. There was a line of fifteen or twenty gutsies headed upstairs...
---
tl;dr... buff everything
---
Nope. The nuked area was already active when I logged in. Didn't die until the rads ate my health.
---
Bless you!
---
I'm not quite down for that. Being a mutant comes with drawbacks and you should need to invest in the proper perks to get the most out of it. That's the balance. 
---
The thinking shouldn't be how to make it easier, rather it should be how to add convenience for quality of life.
---
Ok if you do my ign is shawnpaul
---
This is the first time I'm hearing this.
---
No one has brought this to Bethesda's attention before.
---
Thank you OP for letting us know about it!
---
Hiding in a small pond with a big machine and nuclear waste near by below solomons pond
---
Good pun, named my bar 'Wendigo-go's'
---
My answer to all those Tesla rifle stealth boy users is to simply run in the opposite direction. Wait it out. Force them to burn more resources and pick your battles. They only win if I stand still.
---
I suppose I could always vats air burst a nuka grenade though.
---
They promised us display cases a few months ago already...though apparently have fallen quiet on that matter and even concluded Wild Appalachia....while still missing some of it's content
---
Your opinion is correct for 1st person fallout games. 2 is the best for lore/unique dialog. Play it as a low int character and remember to not take the jabs too personally.
---
That's good info. Thanks for writing that up.
---
Oh no doubt, I totally agree. This does seem to be a game of storage  choices though.
---
Always had that problem is FO4, my companions were always getting annoyed with me.
---
One of the coolest parts of battlefield 1 right there
---
Sorry Ps4
---
&gt;Hi all, I have a fully locked camp and prefer to keep it that way. I have a grow op inside and don't want people lining their pockets with my ruby ripe tatos. The first time I came home to see someone had got in, no turret reaction to them. I believe they walked through the walls, after a vendor fast travel, while the house was popping in. Admittedly I do that too sometimes when fast travelling to camp .
---
You have the option to swap walls instead of scrapping them and rebuilding. Just going to swap a windowed wall to a regular wall and good to go.
---
That's where a K-mart once stood...
---
I was planning on sectioning things out and having having a “Wendigo Wares” area for my vending and a “Wendigo Workshop” area for the crafting. And then possibly buying the bar set from the atom shop and some food things called the “Wendigo Westeraunt” and jokingly have a “(sorry, I tried)” next to it as a bit of a gag. But then I discovered the 50 light limit for camps and realised I didn’t have a hope in hell xD
---
*glowing boy*
---
Crit shot from stealth can do 3500 dmg. Even at 90% dmg reduction, you're still taking 350...
---
That wraist tho
---
even if it didnt show the stars, I would love to be able to see the number of legendaries.  
---
I have been thinking this too, thanks for posting it!
---
and now you know where she gets her gear from  :-)
---
Bullshit...
---
The friends list is really a mess this last week. I've lost  a few dead drops moving stuff to an alt because when I try to go back to the same server it says my friend is on the main menu. I've had to fully shut down the game and my ps4 to get assets to load also. Maybe I have bad luck and they move server as I switch characters but it seems it puts me in a completely different server once I am able to join them after a restart. Somethings gotta be done or make it easier to move items between alternate characters.
---
...many, many times.
---
Granted, I've been doing little else these days (by choice, not because of a lack of things to do), but the number of times I've either had to pull out my PA, teleport nearby and wal back, or just plain GTFO and not come back, is a lot higher than I'd have thought.
---
yeah, i just dipped my toes in to have a look at the graphics, kinda nice :)
---
Tried to feed that lv100 sheep thing, didn't end well, i must have misunderstood somethings, hehehe
---
Hmmm
---
And your camp fot destroy?
---
There are easier ways of getting 3* legendary items.
---
That'd be funny w/ the nuka nade lol.
---
Hard to wait out dudes running MkIII stealth boys w/ secret agent though.  I've resorted to explosive laser spam against anyone invisible at this point tbh.
---
The Wendigo Westeraunt won it for me!! Group up with another camp and make some sort of shopping village? Sorry, Wendigo Willage... No... Don't use that
---
Walked past the office supply area at work the other day and saw a stack of clipboards. Had to stop myself from running over to get the sweet sweet springs....
---
I enjoy jumping instead of attaching a wire while building...
---
My only complaint was no guy feiri vault boy
---
Yea, 76 is a a unique Fallout game. Sure, it uses Fallout 4 assets but it's a totally different playstyle.
---
They're pretty fun to use with the arc going every which way lol
---
I get having a quiet room where one can AFK.  That's where I put my bed(which I barely use when not AFK) and a second stash box.  I *sort of get* locking rooms with a generator so they're accessible, but in a way that players won't leave the door open.
---
What entirely eludes me are the people who spend time decorating an entire building in their camp, but then lock it so others can't see it other than through a window from the outside.  I don't get the trend of leaving vending machines outside.  I like other players to see and ejlnjoy my CAMP.
---
I dont do it on accident I kill all of them intentionally!
---
I'm 165 and it got down to the end where the Alpha was spawned.  I was up on walkway next to a turret which oddly wasn't shooting at the Alpha, but I was pegging it with my laser  beam splitting exploding and burning rifle and watching it's HP drop.  At the other end of the habitat, I see a level 225 player standing there.  Doing ... nothing.  All the other monsters that had spawned were taken care of, the friendly animal was way back there and thankfully ARIC4 hadn't been disabled (why the hell anyone does that is beyond me) so not aggroing on the Alpha.  After going through half it's health and it regenning and going through another quarter of it's health my laser rifle breaks.  I have to switch weapons or repair, so I decide to try to repair and in the seconds it takes the Alpha gets bored there and immediately turns around and runs right up to the experiment and one shots it and the quest fails.  Because a person even higher than me sat on his ass instead of helping.  FFS.
---
The machines are outside train stations too! :)
---
Like serverhoping and killing invisible ghouls, before they render? 
---
Yeah, this game have plenty of ways to enjoy your free time spend as no-life gamer :D
---
Edit: like now I am serverhoping 20minutes to get 10atoms from killing grasshoper at uncanny caverns. What a great goal!
---
Yeah. If you can manage to vats crit someone it'll usually put them down. Players never really have enough health most of the time to deal with the insane damage output possible.
---
XBox? Somebody recently snatched up my entire supply of ballistic fiber. Honestly, as hard as that stuff used to be to come by, I was surprised I had so much kicking around when I decided to put it up for sale.
---
Not to mention the practically broken powered melee weapons like chainsaw, drill etc.
---
Also burning damage doesn't seem to scale past even lvl 10 enemies.
---
Go to the abandoned bogtown they spawn pretty often!
---
I run both a bloodied handmade semi with hardened reciever and a lever with calibrated reciever. One of each rifleman perks, 2 tank killer perks. I've tried every bloodied weapon in the game at this point and my favourite firearm is definitely the handmade, however I run out of ammo quick and mine is only 1* level 35 so I use the lever a lot lately
---
Yuuup lol
---
Right? I can get into the bunker, but not a ballroom??
---
Behemoth or Flatwoods monster
---
I'm frequently having scorchbeasts just fall out of the air on and around my camp, and I have no idea why.  I need to take more pictures with them though...
---
I hate trying to pick something up near water and dying because I drink instead - looking at you Arktos
---
Never saw that happen in Skyrim!
---
Caps ;) like for fast travel and selling items
---
True this, on consoles theres a pretty useless quick swap button as well as the wheel, i would replace that with an eat/drink button that consumes your least valuable food/drink depending on which bar is less full.
---
I’m not talking about that f word.
---
Bayonet bashing build has a nice ring to it. New meta!
---
That's reason why slap damage was thing. I would slap sh*t out of people like that!
---
I belive next time you will do it, wish you luck :)
---
For the same reason there are only a few shitty, torn-up carpets we can use. They’re holding back on other options for the Atom shop eventually.
---
This is the third thread of people being mobbed by behemoths at Clarksburg. There has to be some sort of trigger around there.
---
Behemoth
---
I bet one sheepsquatch would still own them all.
---
Thee is so much I’d do with a decent budget xD
---
Lmao Bot would wreck you if he was on PC
---
Almost like there’s hundreds of posts exactly like yours every week and it’s really not hard to use the search functionality to see what others have said - we are on this sub because we like this game and continue to play it. We wouldn’t be here otherwise.
---
I'm going to bury a load of crap laser pistols. It's a good idea, but there is no incentive to do anything good.
---
It's all RNG if they stay or not
---
I've been buying all magazines from player shops waiting for that moment to come! Unfortunately, I believe they won't make it to the game before PA displays are first a thing
---
I know exactly what you mean. A lot of fun was had building in FO4 making all the stuff and things
---
This happened to me a couple days ago. I was fighting a Flatwoods Monster and it dodged and there was an assaultron right behind it that I hit. Fun times!!
---
I was originally a power armor build before player vending I would give it away 25-50 at a time.
---
Alright, so if I were to go down let’s say the semi auto Handmade route, I’d be better with an AA for general use rather than Furious.
---
Definitely leaving caps on the table in regards to some legendary items and probably overcharging for others. The games value for legendaries is so messed up. It basically does not value legendary effects at all and generates a price based upon the weapons lvl, the number of stars, and mods that are attached to the weapon. This is why before vending machines we only got 5-20 caps per legendary but could get 60+ caps for the right assault rifle that fell off of a super mutant. The price does not take into consideration the usefullness/popularity of the effects (bloodied/AA vs nocturnal/zealots), whether the effects even work on the weapon (AA on an energy weapon), and how popular the weapon type is (handmade vs pipe pistol).
---
My alt is a pure melee build no pa, so I've got a shit ton of scrap.
---
Only thing my camp doesn't get visited that often as its way down south and I can't be bothered to move it.
---
Mostly I just bulk it up and sell to ws vendor.
---
But yea, I got like 500 gears/springs 300 screws aluminium coming out my frikkin ears, 1k acid. I had to offload a bunch the other day as it was getting ridiculous and I was scripping good 3* for stash space when I had over 500 weight of junk.
---
Only thing I haven't got is plastic cause of all the bulking.
---
Your post made my day lol
---
Nope
---
He does, prime plans at least. I have my camp up the stream, fitted with laser and rocket turrets.
---
Are you the reason I found ‘BALLS’ written behind my nightstand?!?
---
I had a good laugh when I found it and I have no idea how long it’s been there.
---
I play fallout so much that when I see certain items in real life, and depending on what I’m running short on in the game, I start thinking of their component parts for scrapping.
---
You...you copied my character’s outfit look. Exactly. Precisely. Right down to the oversized lean in left shoulder, and lightweight chest.
---
My husband and I have seen a few people take pictures of her before, along with our house. I knew this would happen eventually, but this still feels weird. This is no coincidence. No way.
---
Imitation is the sincerest form, I guess. A little credit while basking in your “creative glow” would be nice, though. I can produce pictures from six months ago,
---
One time, the friendly wolf aggro'd on me and kept biting me while I was running in circles around the catwalk.
---
That was the best day ever.
---
Well pretty much, do you see much variety in high level ? Fist weapons &amp; grognak/super sledges, lever actions and explosive legendaries.  
---
The game has a huge variety of weapons, yet almost everything (like you say) is weak (except for some who become good/insane with explosive)
---
We have someone using Endengerol or however you spell it on her every two minutes. Serendipity got replaced with Dodgy, just never updated the link.
---
I was under the impression SBQ was not Glowy. Will definitely give it a shot next time.
---
If it was me, I’d scrap VATS for good in Survival.
---
Sometimes crap happens. I've shown up at the SBQ a couple times and realized I forgot to repair my SBQ killer after the last battle. So I'm sitting there fiddling with the menus, trying to use a repair kit (the ones that drop from the queen), then switch to that weapon. Still says it's broke. What the heck. Switch to a different weapon. Switch back. Aim. Fire. Click. Oh, now I have to wait for reload animation. Aim. Fire. Why's this not doing much damage? Oh, wrong perks equipped. Play poker for a minute. Alright, now we good. No, still not working right. Oh, I have super duper in instead of bloody mess. Swap that in. Now, I'm really ready. Where'd she go? Oh, it's over. \*facepalm\*
---
I've had this happen at other events too. Sometimes the 'do nothing' may be malicious, but other times it might just be incompetence. Just because I'm high level doesn't mean I'm good.
---
I have 128 loose screws sitting in my shop right now, awaiting purchase.
---
Nope. I'm firmly on the side of MORE COSMETIC SHIT... BRING IT ON!
---
Face it, online MP games are all about character customization, when you get down to it.
---
"Leaf-eater" builds lol
---
I actually agree with this even though I'm heavy vats build.
---
 Makes me happy. VATS is a cheat really.
---
If you are on PC, feel free to add me ingame. Bosshondo.

You could have said . “Fallout 76 can cause burn in .......”   the key word being “can”. It implies it has a possibility of burning an image on your screen and leave it open to the fact that that is not the only culprit.  Also, telling another reddit user you never said that (it causes burin in) is also a false statement that can construe what your intentions were. I apologize if you are taking this the wrong way and thinking that this is an attack on your intelligence. I was under the impression from your title that it was factual and came from a place of authority instead of limited observance.  I will keep the possibility in mind when purchasing another television and playing 76.  I hope in the future that you will word your post in a manner that will not entice the reader to a false impression of your meaning. I do agree with the user u/gg-jigglephysics that it has more to do with the quality of your tv rather than the game itself.
---
Honestly it’s a team event that doesn’t require tons of talking as long as you get one thing filled to the max and defend it then you should be good. Like yesterday I had a team of 5 all of which are randoms and we just pumped the site with venison past the max cap and got a lvl 91 glowing albino deathclaw or something like that. Two of those dudes melee the other three including myself are heavies. We killed it but I would say never do the event with at least a team of four who are pretty stacked.
---
Weird, they made it seem like they and Snallygasters were removed from both cards altogether.
---
Unfortunately, it is one of my favorite weapons.  I have a Furious plasma gatling that I might be willing to part with, though.  I'd have to doublecheck and see if it is explosive or not.
---
So pretty much super simplified, Furious for big thing that need lot of bullet and AA for smaller thing that need less bullet. Though would you suggest just going with a full auto Furious Handmade over let’s say an AA Semi Handmade in that Furious for big chunky enemies and AA for general use.
---
Bull.Fucking.Shit. 14000 for a PA skin? After most of the challenges are done it's harder to get atoms, and thats expensive as hell. It's a goddamn ripoff so I haven't spent a dime in the atom shop except whats earned in-game. I got a few trinkets here and there but not everything I think is cool. Think about it. Hypothetically thats 5 PA skins for the price of a full game? No. You people are silly spending that much and it kind of makes me mad that people support this pricing. /rant
---
I use the through wall conduit.
---
Actually I use two - one through the front of the shed to link to the pressure pad for my garage door that leads to work benches, and one out the back of the shed for the vending machines etc
---
I thought I would outsmart the system and start running before the camp renders. Turns out whenever I did this the system placed me outside the camp and my running would normally end with me inside of a wall that was being rendered. So now I just stay still and hope that as the camp renders it will push me out of the way or push me on top of a floor. I normally end up in the living quarters of vendor. 
---
Good thing the game isn't too true to life or I would end up having to apologize to Mr and Mrs SBQ\_Killer as they're getting it on in the bed.
---
I won’t be online until tonight, but I have a few hundred screws I could part with. How many do you need?
---
Literally 5 minutes after posting this I walked into Morgantown from the high school and the event finally spawned. I've been trying for days but only getting Feed the people. Ah well, at least I got my badge.
---
I frankly disagree. If three star legendary dropped only three stars it would make player vending and scrapping for scrip less valuable. Three star legendary weapons should maybe have a slightly higher drop rate, but not every single time. I think part of the fun for me, personally, between content updates, is to try to get a three star weapon. It feels rewarding when i finally get a three star legendary.
---
Lol my buddy runs around in underwear with his old lady character and kills people in pvp quite a bit. "Grandma-style" he calls it
---
So you're angry at other people because Bethesda won't just supply us with fast travel targets, and a game that stays in the loading screen until the camp is actually loaded.
---
Killed a level 100 alpha sheepsquatch got a one star golf club.
---
I don’t think so. I’ve scrapped not a lot of the scout armor, but I haven’t received a mod yet.
---
I noticed it happens often to me, 
---
many times when I don’t take all the loot on the SB. It’s like reminding me I missed something.
---
Find a poster at any train station.
---
A quad crossbow is kinda funny, because you have to reload 4 times for 4 shots...
---
Then you'll get some 3 star wood armor that reverts back to 1 star. Pass lol
---
Right next to the BBQ joint.
---
Any place with large quantities of super mutants or mole miners. Kill and scrap, kill and scrap.  Preferably you want to kill efficiently so as to not spend too much steal in ammo while farming. I prefer a railway rifle or melee for this type of farming.
---
Instigating combat shotgun for sure
---
At first you need the perk fireproof that can be find at endurance that makes the sonic attack really weak against your self. Also a danse mod on your combat or Marine chest (if you got one)
---
Kill all the scored that appears with the scorchbeast and that flying sh*t will come down faster.
---
cannibal is kind of a leveling perk, no reason you should be using it after 50 outside of RP
---
Random encounters like this that force you to flee or endure a hard fight are welcomed in my book. More Swan like encounters please!
---
For me, a Bloodied Gatling Gun does the trick.  It hits for about 400 a shot at low health, and can shoot them out of the sky without much problem.
---
I used to do the shotgun/Enforcer thing before then, but this works well enough to free up points from Perception/Concentrated Fire and save me from having to swap in Enforcer.
---
Even if you aren't Bloodied, the Gatling Gun is an extremely versatile, ammo sipping weapon worth having.
---
You could still do this with the lights, make it one referenced object, you go into sign mode and type out the words. You would just have to have character limits.
---
The spawn point for visitors is where you originally placed your camp device.
---
I got lucky with mine, as i could replace a foundation with 2 sets of stairs.
---
Unfortunatly i dont think its fair to expect people to tear down their entire camp, (especially some of the amazing camps ive seen), just because bethesda doesnt have the brains to add a fast travel mat (even though workshops have them)
---
Just fast travel to the nearest location and take a stroll through the wasteland
---
Survival usually ends up being a massacre at the whitesprings station.  I say this from experience (almost every day for a month) but for some reason I still play it lol.
---
SBQ fights are server events. Even if you launch a nuke solo tons of people will show up. There's always a mix of melee and ranged players so if you're melee, clear out the other enemy spawns until she lands, then hammer away. Some level of rad resistance is required because she gives off ambient radiation.
---
I got a bloodied 40% swing mole miner gauntlet to drop over the weekend at level 50. Runs mid 700 damage without adrenal reaction kicking in. 
---
If course now the mod for the extra claw is the rarest thing in the world now, and 0 mole rats will drop teeth.
---
I ran into one by Pylon V13 last night, he and his buddies were between there and Abandoned Bog Town. I hid and traveled back to my camp as I got killed in about two seconds last week when I went to play with the one near Twin Lakes 😆
---
There was a time the mothman would stick around and fight. Now, as soon as I even appear on the scene, all I see is the *poof* of the black cloud he leaves upon his exit.
---
Don’t worry about what’s in the future. Figure out if what’s in it now is enough to bring you back. 
---
The scouts quests aren’t going anywhere so you won’t miss out.
---
Just south of the dry lakebed by Flatwoods and under one of the pylons is a bathtub.  There's a skeleton in the tub with a ton of soap bars.
---
No but just means you won’t hit as good a run on some servers
---
It's not useless on this point tho. In pvp, people are pretty much one shotting each other. Sometimes people end up with 10% hps left after a shot. Those 10% damages to players can be the gap between one shotting someone and not one shotting someone.  
---
Still not very good and only useful for a certain situation (like many legendary effects)
---
You can swap out commando (auto), and riflemen (non/semi auto) without changing anything else in your build. I use 13 PER, 9 max rifle/commando perks, 3 tank killer for AP, and 1in concentrated fire.
---
 You want to sell me stuff, keep it simple.
---
Happens with both of them. I'm kinda surprised the vengeful Mothman flew off though. He always fights me to the death. It's the regular and stalking versions that usual run away for me.
---
I think you can only get them from the Enclave.
---
Pacify is not taming. You can't tame if they spawn in a group. And Pacify only makes them calm for a certain period of time; they will eventually become aggressive again.
---
You need the actual "Tame" option to come up, not Pacify.
---
Not always.  Some players just don't build their CAMPs in an intuitive way, and you end up wandering all over the place, searching for where they put the vending machines.
---
Looks like a lot of people just prefer to downvote instead of having a discussion.  I guess they're happy with their explosive shotguns and legacy explosives lasers \^\^  
---
No hate on the explosive tho, my main point is that explosive seems to be the only solution to make viable a lot of weapons. That's what weapons need some tweaks/buff and some legendaries need some buff (also could be cool to get some new cool legendary effects).
---
Yes install flechette mod thank me later. I have an instigating explosive harpoon and i would use it if I didnt have 24 different bloodied weapons
---
Amen, Bot. The Leaf-Eaters will complain about all things PvP and will never improve.
---
Since a lot of people will come up, just do crowd control until she lands. The ranged will start to do some damage, but they need protection..When she lands then start to beat her with whatever you have. Least that’s what I do, and I’m a melee build.
---
Or you can not get any legendary drops
---
I killed a 3 star ghoul at WS this morning and it didn’t drop any legendary gear
---
I don't think there are plans. Only mods that you can acquire in the enclave.
---
Don't believe so! Only one I think is the fireman PA skin that's limited time.
---
How is that possible? I can collect max 30 of one kind. Those items have low respawn rate, or am i doing something wrong?
---
Honestly I think they are way kool the way they are.
---
A great game always needs balance to keep them great. If it's too easy (without neg effects) it would be boring. Same with say heavy gunner weapons. Awesome damage/ expensive ammo and heavy. Can drink dirty water (easy to get)/ you get diseased. etc...
---
I guess we're playing different games then because I can just sit there with fireproof 3 and dense while shooting at my feet with an explosive weapon and literally nothing happens.
---
tried to add you, my GT is Insultatron    :)
---
 I walk all over the damn place and did not fast travel for over a month. When I'm shopping I fast travel. If I have problems I will not buy. Simple enough?
---
I have nerve damage in my hands. Can't really play without vats. 
---
But I also don't do pvp.
---
Lately I've been spending a lot of time tending to my shop, checking out other shops, and working on my merit badges :P  I really like the vendor system, I thinks it's well done except troublesome spawn points and everyone spawning mobs into each others bases :)
---
Thanks, will check out pokerplyr first, but will probably need some more :)
---
Ok. I didn’t know the word “tame” would ever come up when I point my gun. Thanks.
---
Good luck making that trade. They want 4 TSE handmades, one at each level (15,25,35,45).
---
Or it's a coincidence, no need to get weird about it.
---
If the people you are fighting are still jumping straight up and down using a TSE anything then you haven't come across good PvPers yet.
---
 I quit doing that and this post is notice.
---
are you using a two-shot weapon?
---
just east of camp mcclintock is a power pylon. under it is a flat rock that has a dresser, tv, lamp and a couch that has 2 bears watching the TV. the rock has a door attached to it but no walls, the door is often locked. my first character built his forever home next to those bears. close to the camp for ballistic fiber farming, close to 2 workshops you can own, has an iron mine, and 2 bearly active neighbors. the only things that ever spawn there are lvl 1 radroaches or mutthounds and its up on the hill so you get a good view. 
---
i feel like i wont find a better place to build my second characters forever home
---
Ok my IGN is same as on here bellis300
---
Laughing at this one as I keep exiting my power armor in a blast zone when inviting peeps to team. "A" on controller 
---
on PC..
---
It's a newb idea, if that's the case the whole game will be flooded with 3* weapons and armor - it'll devalue the rarity of rare drops and that God Roll weapon that you have on reserve for negotiating hard deals [or for cap replenishment] won't hold any weight for deals nor will it get you the desired cap bid that you want. Move on and stop trying to be so entitled...
---
Is it a two-shot, by chance? I believe that adds recoil. I have everything true or aligned with a suppressor on my instigating variant and there's almost no recoil.
---
*low level players
---
Honestly idk how they did it but I think it was something to do with either everyone in one area and possibly increased the spawn rate. Or butchers bounty I think that helps it but I’m not entirely sure. Sometimes the spawn rates are complete shit or they are like how it was yesterday and they are crazy. But either way as long as you focus on one it should be okay. If the venison doesn’t work do the sludge because you collect from the piles then when you kill the mole rates you also get sludge
---
Which platform are you on? Xbone here.
---
There are a few different mothmen I’ve encountered. A stalking one can appear on the same spots where you find the traveling vendor bot. He always flees before I can reach him. The stalker will also appear at my camp. If I don’t kill him fast enough he flees  
---
The vengeful mothman will always fight me to the death.
---
Bethesda should have just either removed them entirely, or changed the explosive perk into 40% bashing dmg.
---
So you think the same seed is used for both the purveyor AND legendary mob drops?
---
No, bloodied only.
---
I like this. I'd also like to have blank holotapes I could leave a little text message on and leave in the world.
---
yup.. and really hard when trying to jump up on your roof when creating a blueprint. this one either makes you say.."yup" or what the hang is he talking about..?????
---
He's not lying.
---
Trick them into coming to you.
---
Yea me too, I'm not on tho atm, probably in a hour or 2
---
How does ESO handle it?
---
Never found a good harpoon or built around it, thanks for pointing it out. Also your damages come from an insane amount of optimisation everywhere. We have to look at it from trying to use it without legendary effects and a lot of opti !
---
This literally just happened to me. It was as if there were an invisible staircase preventing me from getting to the keypad. The wall closed and trapped me in there. WTF?
---
Maybe have a list of all camp items that you can select (with seen through wall outline)?
---
I've seen this light posted before. My best guess is some level designer working on the event accidently placed one in the world and didnt notice.
---
I've seen other little mistakes like that in other games just a simple misclick.
---
Agreed.. I think I used it only 3 times between 50-200. I'm a carnivore and ran out of food.
---
Love this idea. For mine current leveling character, I’m going to build mine ONLY ever to look like a temp area ... tents, maybe some defensive positions, etc. but no full buildings.
---
I enjoy camp-with-meaning. One I have inside the monorail tresses, one I have on top of and using the monument / overlook by the B&amp;B and one I have built within the rest-area near huntersville.
---
Nope. Tried that
---
When you're in your base through the menu you can see a list of everything that's been placed within it with the option to recall whatever item you select. Means you can get rid of a certain object without actually finding it and selecting it, very useful tool.
---
I tried that already. Didnt work
---
They’re most likely getting scrapped for scrip
---
Players cant kill then anymore
---
This is a real place in Nebraska.
---
http://carhenge.com/
---
Or get a buddy to shoot at them and hit them from the side lmao.
---
You do you my guy 😂
---
How many times have you followed "your" marker just to find out it was your buddies instead and now your half a map moving in the wrong direction!!!
---
We need "Our" marker to look different than a team mates.
---
This should go on the Fallout Instagram.
---
This sub -
---
"High level characters kill legendaries too fast! Naughty high level players, naughty!!"
---
Also this sub -
---
"High level players not killing fast enough! Naughty!"
---
Thank you for being one to say this. I don't know why people seem to think that they have a right to enter or access your entire camp. Maybe I just have locked doors because my character locks doors.
---
Geez man. Open up your work shop and hit “scrap” already. Lol
---
Do you do poison?
---
Honestly, seems to me like you are just looking for confrontation.
---
So you discover a bug, post how to do it, then say hope nobody exploits this?
---
You could make three back to back powered doors and put the combinations on the decorative eggs with small letters. They get the combinations to all the doors and make it inside the secret room, they get the prize you’ve left there for them.
---
I personaly use it because its fun, silly, and convenient and I don't really see many others chow down on corpses.
---
If you get the angle *just right* you can loot at least one from the trailer.
---
You probably just happened to find your 20 hour scrip reset
---
You're correct. Things like "wild corn" will mutate, but "corn" like the ones we can plant will usually be destroyed.
---
For the last couple weeks I’ve had groups of 3 scorchbeasts lvl 50, 60, and 80 all flying in a group and they engage me and my team a lot. I don’t know why it’s always three
---
It is weird. It's weird to have people take pictures of your character, and then see it recreated later where other people fawn over it. It's like one part "Yay, they liked my design!" and one part "....you know you didn't create this yourself." 
---
The statistical probability of coincidence over the most minor of details is too fantastic. I'ma social scientist,  know. I also slap down plagiarism attempts with students constantly. This is not that, and it's just a video game. But plenty of people on Reddit gives credit where it's due even when it isn't necessary.
---
Frankly I thought it would be my house first. One dude the other day was taking a video with the way he was slow walking through every angle and corner, making sure to get every flat-angle plane.
---
It's amusing how closely this discussion mirrors the vegan/carnivore IRL debate. It is impossible to mention preference for one in any capacity without someone coming to white knight the other.
---
Thanks for the comments, i'll give it more tries. Put a strikethrough on the line until further discussion (then i'll either remove the line or the strikethrough)
---
The reason, I think, you’re seeing less legendary weapons is because of the scrip and the ones people do have in their camps are tremendously over priced because most of us know if there’s a legendary item it’s going to get scrapped for scrip most likely. 
---
Which I found just going through nuke zones amid a great way to find yourself legendaries for scrip. It cost some time and some rad-x and rad away but when you come out with 7-8 pieces of legendary it’s worth it just to get that one roll for the wood alley you’ve always wanted. /s
---
24 extra creatures server wide would not do anything to performance. That's like saying the everyone on the entire server lags when a SBQ event is going on.
---

I have a few hundred hours as rifleman. This is the build I use. Get yourself an instigating rifle (LA or Hunting) and you will 1 shot 95% of the content in the game. Deathclaws take 2-3. SBs take 4-5.
---
VATs Target Priority
---
Humanoids - headshot
---
Robots with legs/treads - legs
---
Robots without legs - thruster or eye stalks
---
Deathclaws - Belly
---
Sentry Bot - Fusion Core
---
Scorchbeast - Headshot
---
Let me know if you have more questions.
---
I dont pay for my atoms.. I dont even wear PA so I dont buy any of em... and yes I agree the atom shop is a rip off... but that's not what I made this for.. it was for giving us SOME of the things we been asking for
---
That happens to me too sometimes. Lately I've been getting bugged about having 2 sheepsquatches spawn at the end of free range and only 1 drops a legendary.
---
Sheepsquatch helmet and priest vestments
---
You'd be disappointed
---
thanks, needed that, now over to crafting and scrapping, lol
---
Out in the crimson bog, there is a circle of monorail cars on the ground that looks like a great place for a base... but I can't find it again. If you come across it I'd love to know where it is again. Kinda like a circled wagon train from the western days.
---
You obviously dont understand how rendering or entity tracking works.
---
With ranged weapons especially, I  honestly don't understand why people are buying 3 star.  The third star is usually something like +1 to  a special stat or increased bash damage or something near useless.
---
You see people on here looking for anti- armor explosive, bloodied, explosive, etc. Nobody cares about anti armor explosive with +1 intelligence. 
---
The first two effects are most important.
---
IMO you are paying double the scrip for nothing.   You have better chances of getting a better drop, if you get more drops. And you get way more drops if you are spending 50 scrips per drop.
---
I only do two star purchases, and I've gotten bloodied explosive and anti- armor explosive weapons that are compatible with my build.  It does seem that most of the complaints are coming from people chasing 3 stars.
---
Mistake coming from my own language.
---
Trust.. I do not like the atom shop or the way the are charging us for things that were in the last game
---
It's honestly very fun to play like this. I've got hundreds of hours in and find myself seeing unmarked locations I didn't know existed.
---
Cool story. Feel cool now?
---
I mean, is a mod on fallout 4 that just need the scrip extender to that feature to work, and can be a lot useful in fo76
---
Ill save you the trouble I’m about 3800 caps in scraping scout and have yet to learn a mod
---
When I first started playing, the AMR medical building (where you get inoculated) was filled with level 50 behemoths instead of scorched. We ended up killing them all at that stupid low level. (They couldn't navigate the small spaces of the building so it was basically shooting fish in a barrel.)
---
Isn't that NE of the munitions factory?
---
I suggest being well rested/tuned at the start, then plan on fast traveling out to your camp after the nuke is launched.  You'll want to repair your weapons before the queen fight, and possibly retune.  Even then, with just those 2 weapons there's a chance they might break before you are done with her - if you get good help then it shouldn't be a problem if they're 200% repaired.
---
I've noticed on x-box that sometimes the legendary items spawn on a time delay after the death of the mob.
---
I've never had a legendary item not drop on a legendary mob, but I've noticed it taking 5+ seconds a few times.  
---
When doing whitespring runs, I'll typically go back over the bodies after the fighting is done and it's not atypical to find 1 to 3 legendary items across 20 mobs that didn't drop immediately when they died, especially once the bodies decay to meat piles.
---
Bloodied&gt;AA&gt;Furious for general jobs
---
Bloodied&gt;Furious&gt;AA for bosses
---
Butchers bounty doesn't work. More people does.
---
 Learn the noises they make. Stealth out immediately when you hear it. Sneak up on em', they are not especially aware.
---
 I have killed more Mothmen and Flatwood's Monsters than I can remember.
---
Yeah that’s pretty much how I view it. 
---
Personally I’m more of a full Auto guy myself but that’s a fine approach if you have both guns and don’t mind spreading your perks out for each. 
---
Can’t really go wrong with either option honestly. 
---
As an added bonus, you could almost certainly sell the Anti Armor Explosive one on the reddit trading market for a good haul, if you ever decide you only want to keep the furious. People love AAE weapons over there and pay good caps for them.
---
Okay thank you for the clarification so yeah more people more meat! Is that in the area or just overall? I’m assuming in the area
---
Run to the closest vendor on the map or hope it lands haha
---
I want planting plots like in FO4 for indoor crops and more of variety of crops would be good,
---
Thanks to how common low endurance bloodied builds are.
---
I did make a maximum endurance character and it does not make all that much a difference in PVP. It is godly in PVE though.
---
It was yes.
---
thats awesome!
---
Booo battle royal... boo
---
Generally when I experience a server crash, about 5 minutes of what I have done doesn't get saved on the server. Sounds like from the view of the server, those transactions didn't happen.  Are you certain that your scrip total changed?
---
This is the reason I don’t do queen runs anymore. Too much ammo used for 1* and 2* junk. The rewards isn’t worth the grind. The probability of having a good weapon or gear purchased from a duping glitch is very high as that seems to be the only way to get a decent drop. Player vending machines came out months too late as the majority of remaining players have most of the plans and outfits they desired anyway.
---
rad resist perk needs to be % as well other than that spot on.

The observatory on the Savage Divide that was experimenting with weather control pre war.
---
This needs to happen especially if we need to put info out for other players. If the letters are close or connected together then they count as one.
---
I sell all my plans for like one or two caps each. Before the vendors came out I couldn't \*give\* the damn things away. I have a conniption every time I see people trying to sell plans at the default price. I mean really people. It's been a few weeks already - how many of these have you sold?
---
In America, nationalism has become a word with negative connotation. It’s sad.
---
This made me remember the level 15 raider PA in the green semi trailer at the junk yard. Funny how the level 15 needs the Level 3 lock pick!
---
Also in there is handcuffs, electric chair, straight jacket worth 200 caps but vendors give you only 30! :P
---
I have never seen nor taken a pic of your character. There aren't infinite armor choices, sometimes coincidences happen? I usually put on whatever has the best stats.
---
Pip pip boy
---
Although you’re correct there’s a lot of optimization in my build, the guns and armor have to be balanced with those legendary effects in mind, not just base weapons.  Single shot weapons with 1 loaded Max tend to be overlooked, some absolutely shine with the quad effect. Harpoon and crossbow come to mind.  A double barrel shotgun, although not one in the chamber but two, turns into 8, and becomes one of the most insane burst damage guns f76 has to offer.  I do agree with some of your weapon breakdowns, broadsider sucks, a lot of one handed melee weapons are completely outshined by unarmed weapons.
---
If you think unyielding armor is useless you've obviously never used it. It's probably the single best primary effect for armor.
---
I can't confirm it as I haven't tested it specifically, but it does seem to be when they're in that specific area.
---
This is honestly so silly. I didn't copy anything of anyone's. I just play the game dude.
---
A ghoul Slayers gamma gun
---
Okay for sure thank you mate!
---
Yes my Bonerland Est 1942 neon sign needs color
---
I'm for sure curios to know!
---
This could be totally cool! 
---
I'm about to hit lvl 100 and frankly I'm board with the game now but that is because I've created safe and familiar patterns with my current camp build.
---
I always fast travel back to camp at the end of a session and I scarp/prep/repair for the next session which always starts from camp. 
---
I might just give this a go!
---
That would explain my scrip but not so much how I got my legendaries back.
---
OH MAN NOW I CANT RETIRE
---
Oh man! I have a similar photo with my camp in the same place! How cool!
---
I don't go quite that hardcore, but my survival character has an extremely portable, mobile camp. A single tile foundation, stairs, and then 2 tiles of flooring attached to the top. The platform has a sleeping bag, weapon bench, the tiny stove, and one of the small crates that functions as a stash. Other than that, I keep a water pump in storage in case I end up somewhere in the Savage Divide with no convenient water access, but that's about it.
---
Alright, man. If you say so. It is silly.
---
This was my favorite portion of Fallout 4.
---
It can be cancelled. If your weapon isn't out, you can bring it out during an accidental animation like drinking water to cancel it. Or are you one of those barbarians that always keeps their weapons out?
---
I recommend it. I'm also gonna do a permadeath character.

My GT is PoseiDONE Blue i would love to go at it with a group!

Thanks for the full explanation.   I will do that going forward.
---
This one dude killed me through a ceiling by air bursting a nuka grenade. The hit box on that bad boy must have spawned through the wall. It was huge and devastating and super surprising.
---
Go to the airport and the train yard near there. Clear the scorched out, hop servers, do that a few times and have the scrapper perk active and get a lot of steel.
---
That's fair. To be honest, I've always known that filtering system was there but I don't use it either, it's kinda pointless when there's not very many items to scroll through. I've reworded my initial post based on your comment, though. I realise it wasn't very clear so hopefully it makes a bit more sense now.

I just like not having to carry food around. With Carnivore and Slow Metabolizer I can max out my hunger meter with a couple corpses.
---
*knows what he will build when he gets online*
---
I think they are tied, they are also doing display cases for armor and weapons as well. Honestly though, they should take their time so they don't open up exploits to steal displayed items or some such bug.

I remember this one.. I picked the lock for the XP my team mates laughed at me.....

Yea okay nice.... keep posting here every day and tell me that you missed information.
---
k believable defense, fully convinced. "Great collection of stuff to decorate my home"
---
It's impossible to see info about the mailbox when you post here all day every day. You had an original thought, good job.
---
Great response. You've clearly thought about all the pros and cons, and aren't having a dumb knee-jerk reaction to a popular game mode. I appreciate your detailed feedback.
---
good thing is everyone alive knows what all acronyms are for on the internet! BPJY!!!!

also, KGHRK!
---
This happened to me with the punch bowl so I couldn’t just put another one down. Had to almost pull apart my camp to find it behind something big.
---
You can literally calculate the statistical probability of this.
---
I have my camp close to here i think. It’s south east of the rob co research building near what looks like water in the map
---
Sweet, if I can get a couple more I’ll send you a party invite
---
Bought the game for $40 3-4 months after launch. PA Skins are 1,400 Atoms or $14 USD. That's THREE Skins for full price of the game for myself. The fuck?
---
I bitched and moaned about it on here and coincidentally all the prices are being lowered.
---
I think they would have to keep up this pace of development for the next 10-15 years to even come close to utilizing every currently-inaccessible building. There's hundreds of them, and I can only see about five or less that have been used so far.
---
I hate the whole challenges for atoms thing, especially lately.
---
I can stand in one spot with t51 armor and let whiresprings robots attempt to gangbang me with little effect.  Players damage output is insane in comparison.  Imposter Sheepsquatch is pretty much the only thing in PvE that's truly "dangerous"
---
Like 44 pistols?
---
Reclaim missions are easier than defend missions. Just walk away, and come back in 5 minutes to one round of ghouls instead.
---
should probably get a gun then because you aren't effective if you have to hit someone twice then run away.  Especially in there where you can just stand on something and not getting attacked while you shoot.
---
Every time I do Arktos Pharma everybody in the damn dungeon crashes. We'll have two full teams doing the event, and then every single last person has the game crash at the exact same time. It doesn't always happen, but it's been consistent enough for me to stay away from Arktos until it's fixed.
---
I always thought the purveyor was a vendor with a list of legendaries to buy from.
---
You are telling me it’s completely random?
---
Pardon my ignorance I have not visited him yet.

Plans I don't know yet, mostly. But lately also Plastic, Ballistic Fiber, and Lead.
---
If someone was selling cheap .308 bullets I'd get those. If I find cheap Stimpaks I'll grab a couple.
---
If I found someone with serums in the 200c range I'd grab a bunch to have on-hand just in case, but I already have all the mutations I want (bought from vendors).
---
Why can’t you play the game?
---
will check it out to see if it that place... thanks rock on!
---
I need to start picking up ammo I don't use. For a while I stopped grabbing any, but I'm trying to get 5.56 and 5mm again to sell.
---
Just got tired of 10mm, .44, etc. bogging down my stash.

I dropped my rattle... I can't reach it...
---
Imo, Berserker should be comparable to Bloodied.  It's significantly more dangerous to play as Berserker, but the benefits pale in comparison.
---
I've always thought the VATS critical system was a bit odd, especially in how it's integral to many non-Bloodied/melee builds these days.  I know why players use it, but in a game you can play like a typical FPS, having high damage locked behind an aimbot mode is odd to me.
---
Oh I have... this game has so many problems and ways to exploit it a battle royal mode would just make it worse... if they could get all that fixed and balanced then maybe... but as things are right now the idea of a battle royal PVP only thing is just an idea worth going BOO too... now if they did a full restart and made it with NO legos and pure 100% skill then... YEAAA
---
I’m having this problem on May 28th did you find a fix? Please help!
---
 Do you know what the MMO term "pull" means?
---
Yeah, but it could be cool if weapons could work without a crapload of optimisation. A lot of weapons become useless without a shitload of optimisation/explosive legendary effect. People have to not forget that a lot of players aren't playing a crapload of F76 to optimize that way and just want to do damages with a level 50 gun at level 50 with the 3 damage perks of that said weapon.
---
That's my problem, my favorite weapons do work so i'm okay, but i'm sad to almost never see fatmans and missile launchers, broadsiders, miniguns&amp;lmb (yet we see a lot of .50 cal &amp; gatling guns), flamers... even gauss rifles are out of the picture (even tho it was such a beast in the previous fallouts). Also more special weapons like chainsaw or cryolator are unusable because of the no legendary/level 20 for one and for the lack of ammoes of the other.
---
I should also be able to cancel getting in and out of bed. It's frustrating accidentally clicking on the bed when I'm trying to pick something in a fight and I spend 10 seconds laying down while getting mauled by a radrat
---
I got a 10mm and a a bolt action from the purveyor. And I see revolvers (western and .44) fairly regularly in peoples shops.
---
If anyone has a locked door, you bet I'm lockpicking in there unless I can see what is in there from outside somehow.
---
Wouldn't it be stupid, if you couldn't play any melee only because oneshoting bosses?
---
I am carring TSE minigun for SBQ, but it does still less damage than my bloodied power fist.
---
I don’t mind spending the money. It’s not pay to play so why not throw in? Who cares. It’s just a little money. People blow 50 a week at the local convenience store for water for fuck sake.
---
Or Stimpack animations!
---
Of course they don't, but most of the boarded houses are simply closed versions of houses that already have open variants on the map. Bethesda wouldn't have to completely flesh out a new model for each one.
---
I have a whole vendor of just free stuff - low level food, common outfits, chemist/tinker workbench plans, pretty much all my duplicate food recipes, and common ammo (.44, 10mm, etc.).
---
Less common ammo all goes for 1 cap (if the value is 10 caps or less) or 2 caps (if the value is over 10), because I got tired of it not selling.
---
Looks like they changed it cause it was not doing that before... that sucks
---
I'm a pistol user as well, and it seems that they do drop, but very infrequently, I had three drops in 82 levels. I've found a few nice ones, but only on a player vendors.
---
Well I dont know for sure I nevered checked . I mean i still had the legendary 3 star wood armor I got the first time.
---
I just dont see a bunch of Gods in a sandbox being very fun... especially in a post-apocalyptic rpg which is turning into fortnight with xmen
---
Yeah, but why is there no new backpack skin this week?
---
It was like enough to say "We did something to commemorate the fallen soldiers".
---
All good. It's mostly random, you have a choice between weapon or armor, which star level of that choice, plus one additional choice with weapons (ranged or melee I think) 
---
Also, he is actually a she! And She has a crazy name: "Mrrmgh"
---
Here's a few unmarked places that I like: [https://imgur.com/a/gnkpn4z](https://imgur.com/a/gnkpn4z) (I did not mark their exact location on purpose). The first is a great place to farm ticks and is fairly close to a treasure map location. The other two are just caves. The one in the north being my favorite. The one in the south is one of only two locations (that I am aware of) on the map where two resource nodes can fit inside one camp. I don't have enough time to list anymore for the time being but I'm sure some will be mentioned in this post.
---
I wish I could do this with my +40% bashing hunting rifle.  I can already one hit a decent amount of stuff with it.  I unique kill animation would be nice.
---
I apply updates when I want... My next move is when FO76 runs under Proton or other Linux layer. I only have Windows for game playing..
---
The real end game.   Fashion 😉
---
Beats me... I dont wear them so.. PA and backpack skins do little to nothing for me... but I do like looking at them on other people
---
They just should have done something, even if it was one of the stories when we logged in or a Patriotic radio that played the National Anthem.
---
Simple economics, like having a limit to the maximum one-time trade of 25k caps. Imagine if people wanted a million caps for the bloodied two shot explosive best\_gun, but because people had bots of multiple accounts auto farming bringing caps into the world just like every other MMO.
---
Creating money, from nothing, just like real life. Just like real economics. Can't wait for 9 billion people that want to be a trillionaire in a hundred years thanks to economics.
---
Does not make sense in the fallout universe

Only problem is you gotta stop firing or reloading to use a stimpack :/

Also, not directly connected to the clue trail, theres the vault 51 entry on the vault registration terminal in VT University.
---
If you're on PC, stop on by my Fine Wares for Wealthy Folks vendor! It's tucked into a cozy little lounge and sells only the finest goods:
---
Pristine outfits, clean items, Preserved food, "Fancy items", etc. All for WAY more than they're valued at, because the best way to show off that you're rich is to buy common crap for exorbitant prices!
---
Like fine Bourbon for 200c! Or a classy silver pocketwatch for 100c. Pristine coffee can for 50c!
---
And a fine collection of bears and stuffed toys starting at 10,000c.
---
Also, if you can't find Dense, the alternative mod, Padded, works fairly well too.  Especially if you're also running things like Serendipity.
---
He's the guy that drinks the 1 month old Scotch.
---
The existence of any META "go-to" build in any game, is an indicator that the game is unbalanced. So... either everything else gets buffed to match, orrr… more likely, said "uber-build" gets nerfed.
---
edit: typo
---
When I add all 5 stars of demo expert to my explosive shotgun the damage goes from 350 to 360. Its completely useless.
---
This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen anyone get salty about
---
Todd told them they did such a good job at launch that he gave them a 1 yr vacation package
---
Quick trick: spell everything backwards with the neons and they will usually snap into place.
---
Oh ? 1 bonus feels pretty weak. Does it stack on multiple pieces ?  
---
EDIT : It does stack indeed ! The effects can become pretty neet then. Instantly removed the line, wrongly thought it couldn't stack.
---
It is.  If you swap out your receiver to an auto one, you have to change up those perk cards.
---
Ahhh, fair enough then.
---
Yup. One... hundred... percent.
---
You would think I would learn.. I spawned  inside of 4 different players camps that had locked doors today all around the spawn point and the  vendors were outside. Why do people do that? Don't they want to sell their goods? Or are they crouched somewhere waiting for a dumbass to pick the lock so they can pick off a wanted? IDK. I won't spend caps at a camp like that. How many posts have been made on moving the camp to change the spawn point. Everytime it happens I think about sending a message about how to change spawn points but then I think better because if they say they know it will just piss me off, especially since all the doors are locked where you spawn in, so I just leave and don't buy anything..lol getting mad won't help anything..woosa
---
Edit: spelling/grammer
---
It works as well as i wish the black cowboy hat did :(
---
Sorry I know that isn't useful... hope it works out for ya
---
Have lots, they drop. Pray to RNGeezus
---
I get a lot of hate from people on here when I hype up Power Armor.  For certain builds, Heavy Gunner and Pre Patch 8 shotgunners, PA is insane.  Incredible DR, Emergency Protocols makes you damn near invulnerable(exception is poison damage and the imposter beam) and those builds don’t get any buffs from current legendary effects on armor.  I have solo’d the SBQ on rare occasions when no one else shows up as a BE Heavy Gunner in PA.  I’m not saying other builds can’t, but I know one build that can!
---
I'm gonna build something to piss people like you off. Entitled whiny little child. First world probs much?
---
I want you all to know I love exploring your CAMPS regardless so it doesn't matter to me either way.
---
Bethesda responded on a post like this last week. They said that they were aware and that it would be fixed in the next patch. 
---
Sucks we have to wait for this to be fixed, but atleast it's coming.
---
You know what's up 😎 Upvote for being awesome.
---
Does anyone buy Plasma Cores? I have 11 eating up storage space but they don't seem to sell no matter what price I list them at.
---
Also, I don't think I'll ever save up enough caps to purchase serum plans. Should I just vendor my stable flux?
---
Agreed.  Sort of a Cate Blanchett look, and I won't lie, she *does it for me*.
---
For the record, I was 15 when Fellowship of the Ring came out, and I developed an instant crush on her.  Fast forward to today, I'm 32 and still just as if not more attracted to her now than I was in 2001.  And when I say that, I mean her in the present day, because she is still just as gorgeous as ever (Thor: Ragnarok was basically ultimate wish fulfillment for me).  It definitely doesn't hurt that she's a phenomenally talented actress, in no small part because it helps me justify how infatuated I am with her; I'd like to say that her talent is part of what makes me attracted to her, but at the end of the day, I couldn't say for sure that saying so wouldn't simply be rationalizing on my part.
---
Yeah, safe to say I didn't think I'd be posting that in a Fallout 76 thread, but there you have it.
---
That's disappointing thanks for the info
---
So, have you noticed a similar thing with the eyes?  I don't seem to run into problems with other features, like hair or freckles, but the eyes seem to ignore scale.
---
“Write what you know”
---
Why didn't you say that in the first place? 
---
Starting over with nothing is a key feature of BR game modes. I have no idea if they'll have Legendary drops on the map.
---
One of the things I mention in this post is scrapping to craft. That has a few elements of skill/knowledge depending on how set junk spawns are. Knowing the map is a huge part of these kinds of games, and offsetting the burden of RNG with crafting knowledge and the skill required to make things work could be a more skillful experience than you might expect.
---
I thought so.  With armor scrapping being  so miss and miss, I knew it would be expensive (as you have).  I would be willing if there was hope.  The RNG thing doesn’t work for me.  I prefer certainty ..... even if it’s expensive or takes time.   So RNG it is........ again.
---
I like the fireflys at that little lookout. Just north of there is a resource node I created my first real camp at - oil IIRC. This was back when scrapping bulked oil gave more than the crafting cost. There are also two more resource nodes (aluminum and something else I forget) west of there and nowadays there is a Vault in that area too.
---
If you're ever looking for lower level players (level 35) send me a PM.
---
The risk/reward of a Bloodied build is likely an oversight. I'm worried they'll nerf it rather than make other extreme builds comparable. I'd love to see more diversity in gear-based builds in general. Meaning more cool gear affixes that interact with skills and conditions in interesting ways.
---
It could be broken, for all I know.  I haven't used a weapon with it since that change.
---
Don't think they can be learned through scrapping and worst yet they aren't named correctly. Is it a polymer mod for chest or limbs? Won't know till your at the bench. Luckily they aren't very expensive (highest I've seen with 4 CHR and Hard Bargain was around 80 caps) but still such a silly oversight.
---
That's weird my pump action goes from 456 to 514
---
Bloodied power fist. If you don't do nuke zones, if you do, get gun.
---
I do spend money, I've bought the game twice by now. But, they haven't fixed day one stuff yet and even worst than that is how they adjusted armor and weapon duration to push their stupid repair kits.
---
Exactly
---
Nice photo bomb
---
Awesome!!! Thanks man
---
 The MMO term "pull" means I will pull mobs onto your CAMP. As you can see from my tag I have affinity for our loud lady and can fool with many of them for hours. Its what I do.
---
 I will bring them to admire any CAMPs that I find especially wonderful.
---
 Oh yeah, I'm 72 years old.
---
Every time I go there I try to wait for at least six people, the second person that shows up always starts the event. I've somehow completed it several times that way , just me and some random . All the times we failed has been when someone shows up mid ways and does the shutdown option . My level 91 deathclaw gets smashed by sheepsquatch or fogcrawler. But if shutdown option is left alone. Pretty easy for me to defend deathclaw while all others that start showing up kill the alpha. It would be most helpful if others don't get in too big of a hurry to start event, it's nearly thirty minutes you can wait. This is the main issue from what I have experienced. Wait for at least 6 people before starting .
---
Take a break from the game, play something else, and come back later. I took 6 weeks off and the game was fun again once I came back.
---
If you were part of the ban wave it’s not going to happen.  Otherwise specify why you can’t play and what platform.
---
I know of a couple plans that I collect and sell almost daily, so a rare few are static spawns. Nuka cola PA plans and a shielded operative underarmor.
---
Do you think that we'd start matches with our normal builds? 
---
Sorry if I'm misunderstanding what you're saying, but restarting every time with next to nothing is a key feature of BR modes, and a focus of this post.
---
Can't really explain that. Something to do with a server rollback. Maybe scrip is stored differently than your inventory, and despite the rollback taking you to before you scripped it you still kept what you had
---
Indeed, but in the wild, they are nowhere to be seen. Also, we spent enough time on lead, but not everyone has enough lead for cryolator and their other weapons \^\^)
---
What gives you the right to see another player's camp if they want it private? Spawning in a wall is one thing, but locked doors mean stay out.
---
Also, just being back camp destruction. Problem solved.
---
Hacked account
---
I wanna know too
---
Yeah, I had a similar thing happen (sans the rudeness) where I just got cleaned out of plans one day, and I'm pretty sure they showed up at that user's CAMP for much higher prices.
---
Whatever, I thought.  The weight and struggle to sell them at an inflated price is your problem now.
---
Thanks. The weird thing is is that I still find it fun, it just feels a bit pointless. I wish I knew what's coming in the future so at least I could prepare for that.
---
Behemoth has a chance to spawn at Abandoned Bog Town. I think i killed at least 4 in that place. Flatwood monster and mothman often spawn at my camp lol. Best way to find them is to roam about most uncivilised places.
---
Anything bloodied with unyielding armor
---
Oh wow I can't believe I forgot one of my favorite places of all: [https://imgur.com/a/09ppBvl](https://imgur.com/a/09ppBvl). If you like building inside/around existing structures check it out.
---
Mine is a quad explosive double barrel
---
What they need to do with the plasma rifle is buff the regular barrels. The plasma thrower barrel does the same damage as the regular one, except it has a clip size of 306 and fires like 10x faster
---
Which stock do you have? Go for the superior recoil one if you don't already have it.
---
Mine is pretty tame, doesn't fall off target by much at all, but I can't remember its exact mods atm but definitely silenced, hardened rec. &amp; long scope.
---
For console players it is also better to use vats.
---
Batteries included
---
Nice man add me (Moist Coco Pops) if you wanna sell your acid. I'll be on in about 4 hours.
---
If you strip people of their equipment in this mode but let them keep their perk load out you're still giving a huge, huge advantage to to level 50+ players. If everyone loads in with no perks it greatly limits the kinds of mods you can attach to your weapons and armor, eliminating one of the huge potential differentiation points vs other BR games.
---
Is the loot static like in the regular game? If so, everyone will rush straight to the known spawn points for things like miniguns, or they'll figure out a location that has all the mats they need to craft a level 50 BOS recon rifle. The thing that makes BR games engaging for most people is that everything is random, so you have just as much chance of finding a good weapon dropping at Slocum Joe's as you do at Sunny Top Lanes. 
---
Will there also be npc enemies in the game? How do you normalize their damage so that a new player trying this mode for the first time doesn't drop in and get immediately wrecked by level 60+ super mutants?
---
I'm not totally against this mode, I just think there's an absolute fuck ton of things that need to be addressed in order to make it balanced, and I honestly have no faith that BGS will take all these things into consideration.
---
Given the lack of "standard features" that have been present in MMO's for decades (text chat, auction houses, mailboxes for transferring stuff between character, guilds/factions for easy grouping, etc) it's obvious they have no experience making this type of game, and expecting them to make a proper BR game on top of all that is foolish.
---
I have a shop full of wierd spooky stuff as well as helpful quest items for my Responder Witch, a shop full of military plans, outfits, and Power Armor mods for my BOS paladin, and a shop full of disguise apparel, accessories, and alcohols for my Enclave covert operative.
---
Haven't played in 2 weeks for that reason. With close to 1000hrs in game. Hopefully nuclear winter will spark joy in the game again
---
Okay but how was it hacked?  Console or PC?
---
As near as I can tell, it's not worth it at all.
---
I keep feeling like I'm missing a trick with Explosive weapons and the supposed magic they can do.  Every one I've ever had has been thoroughly underwhelming, and I probably should sell them because I'll never find a use for them.
---
THIS
---
if you spawn in the floor fast travel to closest landmark walk over
---
if their sh$t is priced to high don't buy it
---
find your own farm routes (I do think its common courtesy to allow everyone to tag bosses in uranium fever)
---
now that turret farms are no longer build-able at whitesprings who gives a toss where you put your camp
---
if ya dont want to join in a nuke dont come in or hop servers
---
I mean if a person wants to play as a murder hobo fill your boots after all this is a game
---
Mine is two shot so that's probably why it goes up that much
---
Same here. I’m level 140 and never seen one.  I don’t always fast travel either...
---
I totally missed that! Duh!
---
Im trying to get a team together for this event right now on Xbox if anyone is interested. It isnt all that hard if you have a good bunch of helpful players
---
 Makes a big difference to my Grenade Launchers, that for sure.
---
I tryied inviting people, didn't work much. Beth should add notification for this endgame event.
---
Sorry, cat's out of the bag on that one.  I've been doing it for a while, and I've seen others who know about it.
---
It's really efficient, but nowhere near as effective as raiding a super mutant hangout and scrapping all the weapons.
---
Ideally with the Puncturing mod, for armor penetration.
---
That's the kind of thing people tend to overlook and that could be pointed at too. Some stuff need fixing in their mods.
---
Same boat here basic camp plans 10c recipies and craft stations 1c better armor weapon plans ect... 25c just want the space lol
---
This this way.. walk everywhere over encumbered.. when you want to fast travel. put on your Excavator power armor. 
---
Excavator power armor, have all 5 pieces  +100 lbs carry weight
---
2x calibrated shocks for PA --------------------  +100 lbs carry weight
---
I don't think there's a limit to level when it comes to taming, besides "It has to be half your level or less."
---
So if the highest level tameable creature is a Level 91 Glowing Deathclaw, you need to be Level 182 and you can take anything, theoretically.
---
With Power Armor-Anti Armor Pole Hook or Instigating Grog Axe Twisted Muscles Radicool and chems 
---
No Power Armor- 4 or 5 pieces of unyielding armor and bloodied Deathclaw Gauntlet, Bloodied Knuckles or Instigating Power Fist I get 2800 damage with sneak attacks ohh almost forgot about my Furious Rolling Pin it's a fun change of pace when I use it.
---
Pc :/
---
I do. Granted it's based on limited sample sizes and anecdotal evidence. Yesterday, I was on a server that dropped 3 bloodied weapons from enemies so I jumped over to the vendor and she gave me a bloodied/+50% VATS crit black powder rifle. So close to a god roll if it weren't the damn BP rifle. She also gave me some trash that matched up with other trash enemies dropped. I think it was exterminators.
---
There were one or two other items that didn't match anything else I'd gotten from enemies so it's definitely not a foolproof method. I am pretty convinced it's a good strategy though. Saving up your scrip just gives you more chances to get what you're looking for.
---
That would help a lot yes. Event is better than encrypted, could be much better with server wide notification . And once it's common knowledge to wait for 6-8 players to show up , we will be farming it properly.
---
Cuz at this point in time I'm 100% against a BR gamemode and I'm tired of PVP fanboys who wants everything to like CoD or Fortnight... Fallout isnt and should never should be a PVP game... atleast not as a main point... not even a 3rd point... Story, Development, Loss, Hardship, the everyday struggle of what it must be like in this world... that's fallout... jumping super high while everyone is shooting full auto explosive  and wearing the exact "sets" cuz it's this month new thing, basically making "classes" isnt Fallout.. if I wanted to play a game where I'm only fighting the same "sets" of people I can play Counter Strike
---
I just HATE dropping stuff on the ground, lol. Hoarder mentality. I'd rather give it away to other players than throw it on the ground to get it out of my stash, lol.
---
I get you. I am at the exact same place right now. It is still fun, but I don't really have anything that I feel I need to do. Done it all. Waiting for the expansions DLC here too. I mighty take a few weeks off, play something else and get back in again.
---
You don't need to even point your gun at it, just get close enough and the tame prompt pops up. They won't be hostile unless you've hurt them, despite the sloth and deathclaw both having red health bars. If it doesn't work or they're hostile then it's not a tameable one. The only tameable sloths and deathclaws I've found are level 21, the highest I've seen are mirelurk kings at 30. If it's higher that's a good indication it's not going to work. The exception are scorched tameables which I've heard people say can be in the 70s but revert to 20 when they log back in.
---
I noticed that too...completely gone, kinda shitty. It would b nice if any plans removed from the shop joined the list of lootable plans from the world
---
Ah, I’m on console so I can’t give any direction.  Maybe someone else can.  Why don’t you just make a new account?  Was it hacked or were you banned cause I think that’s the real question here.  If you’d been hacked I’m pretty sure they might’ve responded.  If you’re in a list of banned accounts they won’t respond cause their decision is final.
---
Yeah I had the beta and played it quite a bit through the crash every five minutes phase. Took a break to play other things like Fallout 4, Witcher 3, Tomb Raider, etc. I’m genuinely enjoying it again despite that damned Tadpole quest to get a backpack being so damned tedious.
---
Start a new character and try new struggles. First time I played a rifle character and did a lot and started to get a little bored especially when you run around 2-4 shotting most things. I realised its like an mmo once you hit the top its just raids and grinding. So I started a new shotgun character and I realised i’m having more fun fighting an uphill battle. I also enjoy doing the same quests with a different playstyle. Im having fun trying to figure out how to kill a radscorpion with my garbage. My only real issue with my character is I with I could have some of my camp plans back from my rifle character because I love my camp.
---
Percolator perk
---
I STILL have not been able to find a camera...
---
Apparently wasn't a good 72 years my man.
---
Fortunately I love collecting junk so hitting repair all is an easy thing to do. You can only do this once then you're blocked.
---
The best answer I can give to most of your questions is unfortunately, I don't know. There just isn't enough information about how they'll handle these issues. But I agree with most of what you're saying. Especially regarding perk balance, and item location.
---
I get on and get my 1400 caps &amp; 150 scrip.  Then I'll work on collecting things for the Possum Badges.  I'll hit some events as well.  If I'm teamed up we'll hit a few events and do some things together.  I also putz around with my vending machines, and check out everyone else's vending machines and camps.  Some days I just fast travel somewhere and then just walk around and see what I can discover.
---
amen...... it would sorta like going to walmart and bitching at the cashier cause the price of your code red is to high
---
I think the best was getting a "Legendary Drill" from a \*\*\* Alpha Sheepsquatch during Arktos.   
---
Maybe Bethesda can also remove Drills &amp; Syringers from the Legendary loot table.
---
I just like not having to use ammo, and to be close by all the vendors and benches and whatnot. Not super concerned about efficiency :)
---
Regular scorch beast just max out your two handed and equipe a super sledge or fir axe add the martial artist perk and inscisor perk and you'll rip the hell out of them. Scorch beast queen tho just whack adds and when there is no adds just whack her while everyone else shoots. Thats what i do and it hasn't lead me a stray just got me a bunch of scorch beast organs and bones. Probbly better builds but thats what i use so i hope it helps
---
I like this pipe pistol I am getting 566 damage but that's the bloodied part of it.
---
Or when trying to loot plates from a table and sitting down. Actions such as sitting, sleeping, or drinking should require a 2 second hold or something.
---
I like it currently. Most of stuff in atom shop isn’t stuff I want. Some is free, and I use the atoms I do accumulate when something cool pops up. I was into challenge grinding for awhile, but when I realized there wasn’t much I was compelled to use it on, I took a break. If you really want something, spend money. Or just save up those challenge atoms (but may not be worth your time)
---
It’s a good time to take a break between DLCs.  I’ve found a few new things to do, including scouting and building different types of camps.  I’ve also moved away from doing events to finding random encounters.  There are a crazy number of different encounters, and they have added new ones since launch.  I still frequently find ones I’ve never seen and I’ve been playing since the beta.
---
But if you have Lifegiver rank 3 perk, and 15 points in endurance, that's at least 600-700 HP on average. Of course, given that you took the lifegiver perk I'm proposing.
---
Yesterday, at Point Pleasant, near the cargo bot graveyard bridge I found a lovaly Christmas tree.
---
Fully lit.  
---
Underwater.
---
I think the only consistent sheet one could come up with, and I don't know if it would even be useful, would be vendor pricing at specific CHR/Hard Bargain levels for some of the more common fare (junk, meds, drinks, etc). Automatically it ignores ammo, mod, and plan pricing (can't sell these to vendors) but at least one could easily check and see "Oh I'm higher than the Vendor NPC charges for screws..." and adjust accordingly.
---
Legendaries are way too varied to really set anything in stone. 3\* doesn't inherently mean anything except you'll get 24/40 scrip. Non-legendary armor and weapons I personally don't sell, I can't see there being much of a market outside maybe level 15 highly modded items for new players (and who would want to try and gouge those prices).
---
I've tried to do some loose logic in my head...well how much value do these mats have that I then used to craft this or that, plus my time and is it actually a reasonable price? I just end up going lower than what pops up initially, probably screwing myself out of some caps but the items aren't stale in my vendors.
---
I don't think so. I've got a quad double barrel and a quad harpoon and I just reload it once and it has 4 shots in it, 8 for the double
---
Didja mean waist or wrist? What is the waist but the largest wrist? Are my legs giant fingers? Is it me or is it rad in here?
---
Side note.. I was at the junkyard and it was owned.. I unlocked the dresser in the shed near the junk pile and it made me wanted.. I was like what the hang???? when did this change.. I got lucky, there was another wanted player on the map, we cleaned each other up.
---
She's a mighty fine lookin' gal, to be sure.
---
The reason I say that is because random event creatures only spawn as low levels
---
3* enemies have a higher chance of dropping 3* legendaries, which really should NOT be changed. Find an effective farming route and you can kill over 15 3* legendary enemies per hour. Game would be saturated af if all 15 of those dropped 3* legendaries CmonBruh
---
Spent yesterday playing survival. Went well until I noticed I was 2nd place in server and was constantly fighting others off. Then I swear a hacker or someone with a lot of mutegen serum kangaroo jump went invisible and mini nuked me in a way i could only call the wasteland slam dunk.
---
Played skyrim for over a 1000 hours, happened a total of 0 times to me! Played both legendary and special edition, both vanilla and modded untill the game broke...
---
Fast travel to greg mine, then go by walk, this way it will not freeze the game (if is that the problem)
---
That's fine, I guess. But just as you're tired of "PVP fanboys who wants everything like CoD or Fortnight", I'm tired of Fallout fans that put their foot down at anything that expands the experience. We're Fallout 76 fans, and Fallout 76 isn't exactly what many of us thought we wanted. But here we are, enjoying the game. Just please, try not to instantly write things off because they don't fit your bias. The potential to be surprised by something, and to enjoy something that you didn't think you'd like is there.
---
Tried that too man. Patch 9 notes even say that deathclaws arent affected by animal at all anymore.
---
Exactly where my high endurance character shines. I basically grab one pylon and stand perfectly still blocking all of the imposters attacks. Her laser beam is the only attack I really need to dodge and spam stimpacs for. I find most PVE stuff boring, but tanking the imposter is actually really fun.
---
But yeah, players eat through 400 HP and 300 armor very quickly.
---
The same thing happened to me the first time I did that event. I didn't realize that a legendary sheepsquatch would show up. I was stuck in that damn shack and ran out of ammo. Eventually tried hacking at it with my level 15 Ski Sword... no dice.
---
Which means you've litterally played this game less than 10 hours. Not in a good position to share your views on this topic then amirite
---
Same on PSN.  I always go back and check the meat piles before heading out just because of this.
---
My opinion, it is worth to visit the sellers in CAMP of people and so rol something is quite good. Each person is a world and some have real stories to narrate or show.
---
I had stopped playing months ago and I have been able to do all the content, and I am enjoying it, for now.
---
Everything will depend on how they want to focus on the E3, because to be a good multiplayer game in which to really breathe its essence and lore needs to fix many basic bugs, equipment balances and above all, communication facilities.
---
Unfortunately if they end up focusing on a Battle Royale or semi F2P with atoms without solving all the bugs and accessibility problems that have ended up in limbo ... but even so, I personally still enjoy it, but more for the people who the company itself sincerely.
---
I think the future is that they fix the bugs, improve their accessibility and once that's done, and only then, add content.
---
Is it a legendary broadsider or stock?
---
Hawkes Refuge, 5 strings of cans, server hop and get your ammo fast.
---
I have 2 STR, effectively 1 by mutations and I’m still virtually never encumbered. I use the following methods:
---
Bandolier + 1 ammo weight piece: I have 27000 5.56 and it weighs virtually nothing.
---
Absolutely no aid: No stims, no radaway. The game gives way too much of these, just sell your aid, you will pick up more in combat (I also don’t need it with my stealth build) use Trapper or robot armor to reduce your radiation and need fro radaway.
---
Bullet farmer character: designate one character for farming bullets. Keep most of your bullet centric junk and GP on him, drop ammo you don’t use. Missiles and Mininukes will meme you to death.

Yes, I know how it works for a double barrel, so I was very excited when I saw the quad crossbow on a vending machine, just to get a little disappointed when I learned I really have to reload 4 times... But I keep it anyway. Maybe we get at least mods for it sometime
---
I got some I’m trying to get rid of if you want I could send a friend request and trade
---
we need more buttons, can we get more buttons on the controller please?
---
Fog Crawlers aren't cryptids unfortunately
---
Double check. I think you got your stuff back because the sale never got saved.
---
What plat form you play on?
---
Are you wearing a trapper chest? That one looks like it has a backpack on it.
---
Still don’t understand the point of it either. Showing the title of the pioneer scout challenges don’t help me at all
---
Has anyone tamed an animal that high?  I have both perk cards and am in the 200s but haven’t seen a tamable high level creature.  I have only seen level 21 deathclaws in peoples’ camps and I had one briefly.  The highest level I’ve tamed was a 40 scorched sloth that had it’s level reduced to 20 (I think) after a few long ins.  Then it disappeared.  All the other animals I’ve tamed have been lower, with the level 30 Mirelurk King sticking around for the longest duration.
---
Can you confirm that the automatic barrel gives the same -50% vats costs typical of most automatic attachments? Because I did some calculations on total vats damage output and the Tesla rifle, despite it's relatively expensive costs, ended up being on top. That would change if it gets stuck with it's 31 AP single shot cost.
---
Five shots is the maxon the lever action unless you get a double or quad legendary. As for mods, your best bet is crafting and scrapping a bunch of them. Welcome to the true FO76 end game, rare weapon mods!
---
I literally tamed one yesterday so you're using the wrong deathclaw or something. The patch notes state you can't pacify, which you can't. There's a difference.
---
I have a playstation too.
---
If you plan on being almost always being in a group perhaps look into herd mentality mutation.
---
Marsupial and TSE guns made pvp absolutely garbage right front the get go. There is no redeeming it.
---
Happy accidents.
---
In a perfect world the legendary would be quad, 10% dmg while aiming and either moving while aiming or the DR one. Until then just the stock being fully modded.
---
I carry so much forgotten gunpowder on me that if a Super Mutant farted anywhere near me a SBQ would spawn.
---
My build isn't anything really specific just all of the two Hand melee cards running around in my power armor and instigating 40% haste board :-) with adrenaline maxed after the first couple everything's a one-hit with the super mutants level 60 +
---
Some outfits have a backpack like BOS scribe. Its just for show
---
Lol I'll take you up on it - but I mean the pose itself. I didn't buy it when it was in the atom store last time, and it's been cycled out for now :(
---
Fair enough, I just got a little triggered there. I actually like a lot of the stuff in there but I boycott spending IRL $ because of the insane prices and the game is just starting to get to a point where I think it was worth my $. I bought in to the beta, so yeah, they've gotten plenty from me for a while.
---
Why even do that challenge? It asks for an alien photo and there isn’t anyway to get one is there?
---
Hats the plan. I forgot to link the build. Thanks for reminding me.
---
What is your charisma?
---
I agree...any legendary effect would help out the broadsider alot😀
---
They will spawn where you first place your camp device down.
---
Suggest pick a spot for the camp device and build away from that. 
---
Don't build anything around where you place it down the first time you move your camp.
---
Even if you move the device after building your camp, players will spawn where it was placed first.
---
throw me an invite - jamilla0126   :)
---
I should be on at 6-ish this evening EST
---
Picked up an explosive .44 (can't remember the other effects) yesterday.  That and an explosive SMG, and paid less thatn 2K for the pair.
---
They're not exactly...popular.  I wouldn't be surprised if they were rarer drops just because of their current state.
---
You can stretch ANY horde event to spawn more legendaries. Many of us have already been doing this. It’s one of the best ways to farm legendary items aside from nuking white spring golf club
---
Edit: by “stretch” I mean prolong the event by not killing the ‘boss’. More enemy waves will spawn if you leave the boss alive - it’s left to a RNG wether or not there are any legendaries among the new waves . Personally I usually get at least a couple
---
Capture the camp by Thunder Mountain. Either that or Dolly Sods
---
noob.
---
So you have one, and you do have to reload it 4 times? That's a huge bummer
---
Seven. I don't think that actually matters. They also don't take up budget. Level *might* matter, it sure does with the pacification.
---
The pack is new, without discount if you owned some of the parts.
---
A deceptive, poorly implemented and managed the store to atoms, sometimes I'm even afraid to get in and use the keyboard in it: /
---
Separately appears as acquired and even so, it bothers me and much that something that was limited ... have not waited a year to get it out.
---
Those who had bought the armor should have given us the rest for the inconvenience (although it is not something of the other world).
---
Now, I will not think twice, but 5 if I buy something "limited". Better wait until they put it fixed in the store and then even later with discounts, total, and there is plenty of skin to apply to most things so there is no need to have one by default.
---
nice idea.  It would lend a minor unique benefit to fire based weapons that wouldn't break the game.  The game gives you plenty of food, all this would do is shorten the timeframe it takes to acquire it so it's pure QOL.  
---
Also, all the food items that only require 1 ingredient are the least powerful so it's in no way op.  Food that grants strong bonuses all require multiple ingredients so just only let this work in cases where the normal ingredients are meat + wood and nothing else.  
---
The "burning" legendary effect would be highly useful, as you could use that on trash enemies to supply yourself with cooked food as you go :)
---
We'd need to dig in and datamine the SBQ game data to be sure, but if you nuke in the way that I usually do (for maximum flux - you nuke so that Fissure Prime is on the southeast edge of the nuke zone), you can see her emerge from the fissure prime site, and she has a green glow around her for the first 20-30 seconds or so. That alone isn't definitive proof I suppose, but I definitely feel like I'm doing more damage to her with Glowsight on.
---
Edit: One way to test would be to try to complete the daily challenge "Kill a Glowing Creature in a Rad Storm” by killing SBQ and nothing else.
---
Had this happen to me in the ash heap recently, I thought a deathclaw has just got the drop on my bloodied behind... But no, just a wing draped over a rock made to look like a terrifying clawed limb reaching for me.
---
I think you are right... I'll have to check later, but I believe I got one off a legendary drop and equipped it as my other one was broken. Thanks, I feel foolish ;)
---
I'll definately keep you in mind if I run across one.  Been having a dry spell not finding any pistols for you ..lol
---
I've been writing my own table for junk and scrap items referencing max charisma and hard bargain at the vendor Bot. My scrap sells for what the Bot will give me at max charisma with HB barring rarer materials such as acid, aluminum, copper, springs, and screws. What I've found is most scrap sells for 2c and bulk will sell for 25c (or 2.5 each this is accounting for plastic use). About 50c caps for rarer mats in bulk or 5 each. Steel sells at 1c each if the right person comes through. Cement, cloth, leather, wood do not sell. No bites on asbestos or fiberglass either. I haven't had any success at selling gunpowder, however certain bullets sell really well especially 308, 45, and 556 if priced at 1 each. Bobby pins sell at 2 each. Grenades do not sell, except plasma priced at 10-15 each.
---
Do you have the travelling coat outfit? It has a cosmetic backpack.
---
A few outfits have one but is purely cosmetic.
---
I have, both in eye size and eye depth.  When I look at my main's face in the customization menu, she looks vaguely alien-ish with too large eyes and a too-gaunt face.  In game, she looks great.
---
Yep.. Sadly
---
Thanks, you must be right! I think I have a trapper one on that I got in a legendary drop.
---
Jesus Christ, dude. What the fuck?
---
I’m imagining some kind of Dr. Seuss contraption.
---
Yeah. That’s the fun of the game. Trying to try.
---
I'd assume you're being downvoted because of this:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/search?q=canvas&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all&amp;sort=new
---
Took me several seconds work.
---
I'm lvl 227 and I know for a fact that the deathclaw on this location can be tamed. I can only pacify it with wasteland whisperer and cant tame it at all.
---
cow snorkels.
---
Wow you really are a man child
---
With the flamer you got to be conservative with the ammo. Try not to waste so much holding the button down. Get a legendary flamer like a furious or anti armor, shit dues within 5 fuel being used. For acid farm mobs that drop acid. 
---
It's a process to be able to use the flamer but I haven't needed to make new fuel in awhile because of the legendary effect, my build setup and being cautious when using ammo
---
Don't fast travel to arktos.
---
FT somewhere close and walk there. Seems to fix the issue.
---
I am currently working on a stealth flamer build. Maximum damage is around 100 per shot with ideal perks and attachments. A covert operative sneak attack is 2.5x damage. A headshot with concentrated fire is 2x damage. Together that should boost damage to 500 per shot. 
---
I get the feeling we are supposed to be sneaking up and quickly melting faces. That conserves a lot of ammo.
---
I feel ya. Tbh the 10mm is just a back weapon. Only to be used if HAVE to. Or the thing is too weak to use cannonballs or 5.56
---
I actually thought the club was a huge penis for a moment.
---
If so the stash would be overflowing
---
Ok I’ll make 8 snorkels for the moo moos
---
Stable Crimson Flux, 50 caliber rounds, Disease Cure and fusion cores if they are all reasonably priced.
---
Do you? Where are you going? I know it still works for a fact so I'm not sure. The one I tamed yesterday was north of Abbie's Bunker by the sunflower on the map.
---
just saying, since I only replied to OP so far, and you deserve to know; He commented in the datamine post that shows the mailboxes, and he posts here all day every day. 
---
I just can't believe he didn't hear about this and twist it into his own idea. He's edited the OP to say he was scrolling fast, but the comment in the datamine thread says "..Great collection of stuff.." and again he posts here **every** day multiple times a day.
---
 He must have missed the other 20 mailbox posts too, scrolling too fast trading Fallout items at work.
---
Spawned into a dude's locked CAMP, with no way out but to fast-travel. He came home, let me out, re-locked his base, and gave me the Thumbs-Down emote. I was like, dude, WTF, it's not my fault I'm here. You literally locked me in!
---
His vending machines were all full of either useless crap or stuff that was way overpriced, so I sprinted to the nearest stash, grabbed some fertilizer, fast-traveled back to his private sanctum, and left a present on his bed.
---
Play a little less, maybe? There's some good sales on Steam right now.
---
Take mine. That’s all I ever get and I hate it.
---
Yes that's exactly what i have experienced with my pets
---
Nicely delivered.  Upvote
---
Can’t be true. I’m set up on the road just outside of Morgantown, purposefully placed my camp behind a lamp post so it wasn’t in my way but I always spawn in the damned river!
---
So, I don't think the BR mode will be map wide.  Possibly only in Vault 51, or small, instanced areas of the worldmap used only for the game.  
---
Mods having spawn points and such would eliminate the need for modding perks.  As would temporary serums  for mutations.  NPC enemies, if present, could be scaled to the level of the player: first person in a house spawns 3-4 enemies of their comp\[arable level.  
---
Before this post, I was utterly ambivalent about the rumors, because I just wouldn't play them, like Hunted v Hunter and Survival.  Not my bag, I'm here for lore and scavenging.  But now I'm pretty intrerested in what they could do.
---
Take a break. Most of us who have been playing since launch have nothing to do apart from farming legendaries or play survival. For some reason in this sub some people get upset when someone says there is nothing to do in the game though. Waiting for Nuclear Winter now.
---
I've been using the mappalachia encounter map and after two nights of scrounging I've found;
---
Several lv3 doggos
---
2 Brahmin
---
1 lv &lt;20 mirelurk hunter in the mire, and a lv 26 deathclaw way off in the wilderness,
---
 (none survived the trip to my camp of course)
---
GOOD TO KNOW that this can HAPPEN. I hope to run into this crowd one day
---
The great barbarian slayed the scorchbeast queen with his mighty spear... Doug

FUCKING YES.  The Responder Firefighter PA and Axes are out?  Been waiting since the infomine.
---
Thanks I’ll try this out. I have been server hopping at the location.
---
True...but a tse 10mm pistol on the other hand...would be anice backup😁
---
I will not attack anyone who does not set a trap for me. I don't mean stuck in the foundation, that I will just move on from.
---
I want resources to be automatically add to my stash as they are available. Why the hell not. That or give me a robot to work my camp for me so I don't have to stay there to get a restock on water or empty my extractor. Geez
---
I sell serums for 225 but I wonder if some of serums are being sold for 600-800 that I see in player vending machines. There are plenty of 3* weapons I would be happy paying more then 2k for a lot of plans I put at 0 caps and very cheap chems 8-15 caps.
---
&gt; Suggest pick a spot for the camp device and build away from that. 
---
AFAIK, the area on which you can build your C.A.M.P. is a circle with the C.A.M.P. device situated at the center. Building away from the center of that circular area can be severely limiting for some, if not many, players.
---
I get way more joy out of making 76 a memorable experience for others rather than playing it for me. I have weapons that can kill or help kill anything in the game so far. I have bought all the plans I want and about 95% of plans I don’t need. I’ve done all the “end game” stuff and new update quests multiple times. I have enough aid items, gear, and ammo to last for a long time. I’m good, it’s all the other people I’m still playing for! 
---
What do I lose buying a fusion generator plan for 197caps and reselling it to a lower level player for 25 caps. I lose 172 caps but who cares, another player got a great deal on something they don’t have yet. They’ll remember you helped them out and it might make their day. I do this for so many items including jet packs, sheepsquatch staff mod plans, aid item recipes, etc. Playing with the main goal being to help others (or as I always say “be the friendly NPC Bethesda didn’t give us”) has kept the game very interesting for me even 900hrs in.
---
Are you serious?! I have played 49 levels on one character since beta and then another 80 on this one and maybe seen one nocturnal...

There's tons of lovely mods for Fallout 4 that we could REALLY REALLY use. Like for instance. Place everywhere, Scrap everything, settlment management software, etc etc

I have a shielded harness that gives Agi and Per, found in a shop I have no idea where to get the plans. You can easily find the plans for shielded operative underarmor (google it...tanagra town or something like that). Buy the base underarmor from the Enclave production area vendor, add some crimson flux, balistic fiber, etc and hey presto 3 Str and 2 Per, very handy.
---
Fair.
---
Yeah I run heavy and mow stuff done pretty easily
---
Just north of South Mountain park. Its always a different encounter and all the other animals that spawn there are tamable for me. Yes. I do know
---
You can get prime crossbow plans from sbq. Bumps the damage up a decent amount. Need flourescent flux for the ammo which is found in bucketloads and WS
---
Bought the Brahmin pen at a train station and my camp has 3 Brahmin that constantly spawn
---
Like what?
---
Yes!!
---
The company is to blame. I'm sure the game devs would love to make the game into something we all love but it takes man-hours to do so. You can't just grab someone's mod and put it in the game, you have to acknowledge the modders, which means paying someone, and they ain't gonna do that unless interest is high enough and not enough people are clamoring for mods yet.
---
😭
---
Yeah, I would if it was an option anymore, but pretty sure there's no such thing now.
---
How did bethesda lose money?  They’re giving those atoms away... they don’t get ‘paid’ if they give you free money
---
If you need cave crickets go to tangara town. In a cave half way up are a bunch
---
Rename them.
---
E to harvest ore also will get you outta your excavator armor.. game coders are dumb.
---
Probably.  Not 100% sure, but near that.
---
Add to that "Where you see an item, but the system on'y let you pick it up." and I'd take a stab and say there's a significant network issue at play, but whether that's local (crappy wifi connection) or an ISP problem is hard to say.
---
"Ability to rename items is gone" has me somewhat confused though, I haven't heard of that one, but if it was a game problem, it would be widespread.  Definitely sounds more like a problem with the local files.
---
Be sure and put the crystallizing barrel on. That thing is a beast against the queen! Keep hitting her after the first initial freezing, she can go a shade whiter and take longer to recover.
---
Are you on PC?
---
Just rename them. The feature was added a few patches back. Name each chassis to corresponding power armor.
---
The PS4 controller has a nifty touchscreen thing. Killzone: Shadowfall is the only game I have played that has bothered to use it.
---
There are a lot of people with a lot louder voices that have that same opinion. The problem is, that there are so many people voicing that, that the people who genuinely enjoy this game are getting drowned out. This community should be focused on trying to help this game get better, instead of throwing pointless "criticism" at it. I use quotes because I'm still not convinced that "this game sucks" counts.
---
Makes sense to conserve the ammo using short burst and what not but ive yet to get a legendary one to drop as well would be dope but all i get to drop are legendary rocket launchers. But ueah the proccess to get lots of acid is a long one spend a while in the toxic divide area already forgot its name but thats where i do most of the farming
---
My friend thinks I am being willfully ignorant about learning how to do the event at Arktos but I literally just can't figure it out. Something about a terminal and something about a combination under a glass floor , I know that I have to gather stuff and put it in the collector, and keep friendly animals safe... but I still can't grock the entire thing. I start the event, where should I go then? What's the combination for? So many questions still
---
I'm down for a surprise... just dont see if that is the way fallout is heading.. I just will wait till the next one or a DLC that will be towards me... hence why I simple said... boo haha..
---
Your spawn is different from where other people spawn when ft to your camp.
---
Other people spawn where you placed the camp device the first time.
---
You spawn randomly.
---
Yeah, I don't even bother with them.  The only thing I use now is the Open neon sign.
---
Stealth absolutely melts right now, even when not combined with Bloodied, it does not need more buffs.
---
Well, I can tell you with 100% certainty you only need Animal Friend rank 3. Maybe you do need higher charisma.
---
Serendipity perhaps? We your targets bloodied builds?
---
Well what’s the difference really, selectively removing unwanted mutations and removal of unwanted effects. It’s certainly all about adding convenience for quality of life. Right now I have 11 points in luck yet still need to shuffle them around when I do certain things. If people don’t need to have certain cards in there it will definitely enhance the quality of life.
---
Where did you find yours?
---
I used to have this problem.
---
As la ow level character I was always on the hunt for purified water, stimpaks, cure disease, rad x and rad away. I think it me hoard this stuff in case those days of scarcity returned. (They don't).
---
What really helped me was playing in survival. It was a good lesson in weight management. I learned to carry only the essential aid in case I got killed.
---
Now, instead of weight reduction perks, I focus on things that make it easier for to kill/harder for me to be killed. First level photosynthetic and sunkissed leave me with tons   with tons of extra stimpaks and radaways. (And points spent in endurance also get you more hitpoints.
---
I carry a fully perked melee weapon for dealing with high level creatures, and an unperked suppressed handmade for dealing with low level creatures. 
---
For drugs, I hotkey psychobuff and berry mentats. I sell everything else.
---
I usually run around with 200 pounds of gear, and 300 carry limit. When I go over, I hop into my excavator and get to a bench or vendor.
---
Well jeeze, might as well ask if it'll show you how many plans are available that you know versus you don't know?
---
It'll never happen, they want the caps sink of the travel costs.
---
We talking PvP here?
---
But what about the ammo cost? Im assuming minigun/LMG.
---
This, and all your replies to comments, really makes you sound entitled.
---
Let people build what they want, how they want, where they want.
---
Look for the vendors or move on. No one is forcing you to visit the camp.
---
And FYI, traps are fun. Look into them.
---
Hair cuts.. clothes.. not that face paint has been added but I'm sure it wont be free... skins for weapons...
---
That sucks. I've got a quad with 25% fire rate I was going to donate to you.
---
Hopefully Bethesda will show this thing some love one day.
---
Amen brother. I don’t want that stupid bundle.
---
I had the same issue!
---
Cool thx for the tip.... It was allready installed
---
Let me go and reset my camp just for you. Brb 😂
---
Hair cuts yeah.  But like, specifically, what weapon skins and clothes were in four that need to be paid for now?  I can't think of any.
---
Scorchbeasts tend to hover to attack, so you can get multiple hits in a row then. Most other stuff, with a suppressor and stealth you can one or two shot at most. And yeah, I make my own ammo with ammosmith. I spend al my time collecting lead or making ammo! Plus I rotate out  with an instigating hunting rifle and a lvl 50 fixer. Ammo is a problem with this gun, but it’s worth it.
---
Wasn't Bloodied already nerfed? Perhaps I'm thinking of Adrenal Reaction? Truth be told I couldn't say, perhaps both instances were merely rumours.
---
North of Abbie's bunker. I follow the trail by the suspended trucks to the fenced in shack with the two ticks. If there's nothing there I go further north to the crashed vertibird in the pond.
---
Interesting. Hadn’t considered that. If we could only get the Welcome Mats!
---
My previous gut, pre-vendor, was on the side of a cliff. I regularly spawned on the wrong side of the cliff!
---
There’s a bladed, puncturing and spiked. I have three bloodied boards with those different mods. I don’t think there are any others?
---
Nope.
---
You complete all the badges with the Scouts?
---
Inspect the chassis in your menu and you can rename it for which set it contains.
---
Its someone's opinion to say the same sucks, so let them say that.
---
Ya I agree and have been downvoted before because of it. I like to keep things affordable for if some new low level comes by looking for plans. I don’t see why people get all but hurt about not price gouging. 
---
I ran into an awesome vender a few days ago near WS. Legendary weapons were priced by star. 3*1089c
---
Not all heroes wear capes. It took me weeks to find affordable mutations.
---
yeah i thought this was pretty ridiculous. Glad to hear i am not the only one. I am tracking world challenges and you can't see anything that your supposed to do. I have to navigate to the complete list and scroll through it all to check. So stupid and annoying.
---
Have you tried turning it off and back on again?
---
Why thank you! You never know if there's like a rocket mod or set it on fire mod :-) LOL thought I'd ask
---
You spawn near the north boarder of the center of camp depending on the land
---
Bloodied SS Deathclaw Gauntlet or power fist, I prefer the DCG. Bonus points for +STR, +END, or +AGI. [Here is my build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=c1a46cb&amp;d=s92sf2se2ej4eu0ee2c72ir2i42a72aa2a42am2la2lu2ss2pa0lt2l71&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=289cefgh) with mutations included, I find it to be very OP. Especially with Unyielding Cav armor
---
Do you have your audio set to team and not world?
---
It's been months since I last used turrets, but IIRC spotlights help 'em find the enemies.
---
Which system?   
---
Had to throw my headphones on yesterday, on PC, and was able to hear a fellow survivor far better. I did also add some line to the .ini in hopes of boosting it (major failure, never make two adjustments at once :p). Which ever one worked, was able to hear dude loud n clear.
---
If you're lucky you can also let Super Mutants shoot it down and then go steal the crate from them.
---
Have you checked your audio settings and made sure the area chat volume was all the way up? Some people don’t talk, others may be in a party, but I come across people with an open mic every now and then.
---
You are right.. there isnt yet... but there ISNT any skins free yet... it wasn't until we had the creation kit that we started to get skins really... but you could earn skins for different things in the different mags.. PA, house, and what not
---
That's what I'm worried about; they'll either spawn you into a trap house or off a cliff.
---
In certain cases sure. But while it is counterintuitive, the point of 3 star enemies is for the *chance* to get a 3 star. For a ghoul at Whitespring, that chance makes sense. 
---
I do agree with you that the SBQ, the Imposter Sheepsquatch, and the Alpha should be guaranteed. But outside of that, I think the system makes sense.
---
I believe some animals require animal friend and others require WW. I  believe you also need at least 6 charisma and to be 2x the level of the animal. Personally, I've tamed a rabbit, sloth, death claw, and snallygaster. My gf has tamed a yai guai, cat, and death claw
---
Can try adding a spot light, I threw one up and they seem to zone in on enemies way better now.  
---
Doesn't seem to help with mutants/scorched, who can stand out of the agro area for the turret yet still shoot my stuff
---
This has been suggested several times in several posts.
---
Just fyi. This is a repost of an already requested feature.
---
As long as it isn't carried over to PC. Long press on PC should never *ever* be a thing, we have a billion god damn buttons for a reason.
---
The subchallenge says "Take a picture of a Fogcrawler". So Fog Crawler != Fogcrawler?
---
I bought the Hot Rodder PA paints when they came out originally. Passed on the PA station skin. Regretted it. Shame the bundles don't take into account existing purchases. I wouldn't mind the PipBoy skin.
---
I don't see a limited time banner on the Hot Rodder stuff. I guess it's here to stay for the foreseeable future?
---
Does it say “Sensor Array” alone and is made of Black Titanium..? If so it is for Excavator Power Armour... If it says “X-01 Sensor Array” and made of steel it’s the right one and I don’t know what the problem is... good luck..! 👍🏻
---
Edit: If you’re crafting and not attaching a mod then make sure you’ve learned the Sensor Array plan for X-01 and not another type of Power Armour (check via Enclave Bunker vendor plans)... 👍🏻
---
Well now I guess I’m gonna have to decide, though I’ve seen how much they go for which is why I thankfully have saved up, especially selling some jumpsuits too which helped.
---
Is it possible to freeze her in place indefinitely if ammo is not an issue? I’ve seen people using them in queen battles but she always recovered after being frozen for a while.
---
The Flatwoods monster should count as Alien too since a recent patch.
---
We bioshock now
---
Yes, I have to spots as well, still just chilling.
---
\*ugh\* laaaaame
---
At least they're aware it is an issue and hopefully they ARE working on a patch fix for it.
---
All good. Tbh I like that it doesn’t have love. It’s good as a slow support weapon. Standing back lobbing a ball of crippling pain is just too fun. Plus there are fair amount of perks that aide it.
---
In the last 20+ hours I have found nothing but armor. I have 600+ hours in with 2 characters ones lvl200+ and ones lvl80+ drops are random. Always random. Majority of the armor I find seems to have crappy prefixes ie: hunters,troubleshooters, exterminators, etc..but I have found FAR more cavilers and sentinel pieces and a ton of weight reduction pieces. Unfortunately they are never with the prefixes I want. I will say the lifesaving pieces are extremely handy and glad I have 2 pieces with that prefix. If I could only find some unyielding pieces worth a shit now.
---
Not sure it exactly works or shows dmg correctly after all the "fixes" they have done to it. I can say if I leave off rank 4 demo it takes me more shots to kill a max level super mutant than if I have it equipped
---
It's set to auto.
---
Pics?  Or descriptions of what's so awesome?
---
Ps4
---
The crazy thing was I was AFK when he spawned. They have that barb attack they do which seems to go through walls so luckily I wasnt killed before I got back
---
Did you give it a few minutes to load?  The game is really suffering from invisible NPCs upon load-in lately.
---
Same, heavy is a total blast. Tried them all and enjoy heavy the most 💪
---
No, do you get something for doing all of them?
---
No worries! Hahahha right? I just found out yesterday that you can take out the head of the sledgehammer and just have a stick! I was dying in laughter playing with it 😂
---
I think it is just "Sensor Array", not sure about the materials. I will check later when I can get back in game. Odd that it gives me the option on the X01 to craft it.
---
I only find behemoths at the abandoned bog town workshop. Usually if mutants own it, there's one lurking around.
---
It is limiting for sure, but limitations *can* release creativity etc. Some camps have really taken this goofy system to heart and overcome the issue in grandiose ways. 
---
Until the FT system is sorted by Bethesda, I rebuilt in such a way to accommodate it. I was being stubborn about it at first but after the nth time of spawning in someones foundation I figured it only logical to rebuild. CAMP definitely isn't as nice as before but it works, people spawn literally at the base of my front door stoop (where my vendors are as well). Just worked out way better in the long run for me.
---
That's a reference to the Mothman Prophesies.
---
Give it a few minutes
---
Get it alot. Things are taking ages to pop in to existence on loading. Whitespring golf club was mental earlier. Furniture missing, invisible ghouls etc...
---
They are usually outside in the gift shop.
---
Surely you wouldn't feel that way about a converted Mr. Fuzzy bear backpack? That had better be on the way!
---
I have a hard time picking up the game because I have no one to play with. I’ve hardly played maybe 5 hours in it.
---
I did check my settings and i noticed something. I checked my chat audio setting and i was lowered all the way. But i distinctly remember having turned it all the way up earlier today.
---
Give it a few minutes. I usually have to wait 3-5 minutes, since this lady patch, for the vendors to load.
---
yep this is true I try to price some decent end stuff for somebody new and lvling up alts I dont think they realize with the proper build a 1 star can get the job done.   All I had to do was get my alt to lvl 25 to use my instigating fire axe and the next 25 lvls were cake..
---
Why would you ever have one you didn't intend?  Aren't you using Starched Genes to control what's added or removed if you want any at all and want to control them?
---
Guessing you've already poured over the system settings as well, but I'll throw it out there :/
---
If its any consolation its quiet AF on PC as well. I've seen plenty of the indicators on my screen showing people talking in Area but until I put the headphones on I heard 0.
---
I would say one could get like a headphone amp, but if voice is the only quiet part, it doesn't make much sense. Looking at the ini, the PC version takes use of some 3rd party VoiP system, maybe some issues getting the engine to play nicely with the console voice systems?
---
Found them here for the pioneer challenge!
---
Last night I was playing with a lvl 27 and waited for him to come back from getting food I was holding a 3 star wolf he got back got some shots in and we killed it I (lvl 106) got  wood armor, he got a 3 star hatchet lol gave him 2000 for it
---
More badges to spend for more plans.  Plus there's a third tier that is coming at some point, which if I were to guess will require having a minimum number of completed badges.
---
I spawn randomly throughout my camp.
---
Sometimes at front door.
---
Sometimes over the edge of a cliff.
---
Sometimes on my roof.
---
Visitors are always at the door where I placed the camp down.
---
No... my spot... ;P
---
It takes a few moments for them to pop up, I nearly had a cardiac event when the legendary vendor machine wasn't there at first.
---
 Heavy Guns are very overpowered. Without TSE not sure but I just melt Impostor,SBQ, Alphas, and Sheepsquaches.
---
Yeah pretty much. Hit her while she’s on the ground and keep her at that second stage of being frozen. She’ll barely move, keeping her on the ground a whole lot longer. I used up about 300 rounds fighting her last weekend and it was over super quick once she landed
---
Yeah someone informed me of the through-wall conduit so I'm going to be on the lookout for those plans. I don't think I have it.
---
Depends on how it's implemented, but the other issue even with the sign idea, is that you have to load and hold in memory a texture for each letter. Now if the letters are simple, you can probably do that with vector art textures and get away with lots of letters, but things like the neons require more detailed textures and you need one for each used character and possibly in each color (again depending on how its implemented) to be loaded from disk into memory. This doesn't matter for the server as much as what you mentioned, but it might cause problems on lower end systems since this game engine isn't exactly state of the art.
---
I turned mine down a long time ago because it wasn’t beneficial and the only things I heard were people munching on potato chips or people trying to troll me while I was checking my stash or in a vendor. 
---
I’ve probably missed out on some good interactions because of it. If you ever need help with something on FO76 and you are on PS4, add me and I’ll help. In game name is same as Reddit name.
---
That's weird. Out of all my camps, I've only ever had 1 spawn at each camp, it may change a few feet, but it's the same
---
I saw one who fattened the account with more than 10 binoculars XD.
---
IMO almost every atom shop PA looks bad. Blackbird, Chrome, and Bone Raider being the exceptions.
---
Verily.
---
that's where mine is too!
---
The sales director of atoms shop is clueless. Their revenue can be easily multiplied if they have the right people make decisions.
---
Early on when the game first released there were WAY more robots at white springs. Launching a nuke was the buggiest I have ever seen. Something like 12 FPS
---
Ive never once come acceoss a super mutant behemoth in this game...
---
What system are you on? I picked up a furious flamer last night 1* that I could give you if you're on ps4
---
The only backpack I want is that Corvega, til then I'll wait.
---
50 attempts?  I applaud your determination to get something that is probably useless. Meanwhile I have never experienced this problem so I can't say "I understand your pain".
---
No, this was against the games enemies. Super mutants etc
---
Just saw you're on PS4. So am I and I have to turn my chat volume all the way back up every time I start the game. That said a lot of people don't talk or are using party chat so I can't hear them.
---
Short but helpfull, thanks!
---
Right? 100% accuracy from 100 yards away?! Ridiculous...
---
I'll say I am on the edge of a cliff so my "northern border of the center of the camp" is floating in air, lol. May be the difference.
---
Just try it out when it comes out. You mentioned CS, so you aren't completely opposed to PVP. Why not just try it out?
---
Grab something that shoots 50 cal. You can craft 100 bullets at a time without any perks. I did, and it hurts because I'm constantly out of steel, but seeing as it's my only gun (I'm running a melee build), I can justify the steel expenditure.
---
Sounds awesome bro 👍🏻 The players I saw using it probably ran out of ammo so she eventually recovered and took off again.
---
Ehh.. most of the time it's because other folks don't have mics.
---
Bruh
---
Yeah, getting ammo is kind of a pain in the ass. I buy it from any player vendors now for cheap, but to make it you need a lot of crystals
---
What? I don’t see why you’re freaking out. Is it because he’s kidding?
---
I knew I wasn’t the only one I remember this happened in the beta and I just NOPED out of there
---
I got leery of chat after the third (on my second day of playing) use of the word N***er by other players.
---
This is a global game, not a US game.
---
Yeah thats the stunning part, when i was hiking through the rougher part of the wasteland there was a level 50 one that didn't leave me alone till I got to the purveyor. 
---
Now i actually fight back a level 35 one and this happened hehe
---
could be worse after you get everything up and running producing fusion cores and some lvl 200 guy and his buddy decide they want it now
---
I came across one at The Generals Steakhouse once.
---
He was minding his own business, enjoying sticky meat (or was it stinky meat?), so I shot him several hundred times with a handmade.
---
True story.....
---
And the Hot Rodder bundle, I think. The items appear to be here to stay for now individually but the bundle is timed?
---
Well my current one is also on a cliff and drops me on the edge. Idk
---
I wish there was something for board as far as to change the looks on the store! Maybe some mahogany.. or one of those spanking boards the teachers used to have LOL
---
Im on xbox1 but thank you for the offfer
---
Innovative suggestion!
---
Yeah that's how it is with me as well, but this time i waited a good 3 minutes in the area, then left to go to a camp vendor, stood in line then browsed, fought more mobs then came back to the legendary corpses  and still no legendary loot.
---
You might just be unlucky. I've seen random Glowing Yao Gui(Lvl 76) and Glowing Deathclaws(Lvl91) both in The Mire.
---
PC
---
To add to this the Endangerol Syringer will lower her damage resistance by 25% for 2 minutes. This effect stacks between different players but not the same player. 
---
Tenderizer is a good perk card to use because the first rank increases the damage she takes from all sources by 5%. Each rank of Surpressor drops your target's damage output by 10% up to 30%.
---
Thanks! I assume i gotta give them a quick death then?
---
Adventure world. My perk cards layout is half circle arch, s15, p6, e5, c3, i5, a11, L11. Nopa powerfist, tse 5mm gatling, ts gatling plasma, aae combat shotgun, all benefit from my perk card layout for sbq and events. It is fun and worth it but i dont know about this park card layout working in pvp survival world. If you like handmade rifles stick with using vats sneak park cards layout. I could have vats crit sneak perk cards layout but i dont want to bother moving all of my special points over just to use handmades and rifles.
---
Non tamable
---
Dang on im xbox.
---
No problem, just remember short bursts and a good legendary flamer can go a long way. With my setup I can melt a behomith without using more then 50+fuel
---
Great, give people more reason to kill my Brahmin.  Thanks.
---
I don't think it's really possible with the one they already have here. The best you can do is get a quad gauss rifle and pretend it matches up to the glory of the original
---
I don’t believe there is one. Closest to black would be the skull bandana
---
Raised Foundation are causing players to get stuck, keep them as low as possible and all will be fine
---
Damn now that's some real good stuff. Il take ot to heart when using my flamer
---
Is this a problem for the small signs people use on vending machines as well? Do the 'food, components, ammo, clothing, etc' pre-made signs take up a lot of server-side processing, thus budget?
---
I've reached my build limit at level 25 and need to start cutting corners and wasn't sure where to start; maybe I should get rid of signs.
---
I'd like that mothman one
---
Actually pretty interesting reading. Dont agree with all but lots of nice ideas 👍 if they are wanting to keep this game alive for a long time they need to start buffing other legendary effects imo instead of nerfing everyrhing to the ground
---
That's a good idea. That way we can prevent it from happening.
---
One thing I really hate is when you hold the action button to add someone to a team and they run off before you can finish. Next thing you know, you are hopping out of power armor in a nuked location.
---
For sure!! psn: rstickman 
---
Just join whatever server I'm on whenever you feel like getting some cheap legendaries. I prefer to sell things to other players at competitive and cheap prices. I'm PST and am mostly on between 10pm and 3am
---
I sell a lot of legendaries for cheap so cheap in fact, that often one triple digit player will buy my entire stock in one sitting. So if you stop by and my stock is empty be patient ill probably do a white springs run and restock within an hour or two.
---
RIP
---
Damn, now I'm kicking myself in the ass for not getting a bloodied cryolato I saw in someone's shop this morning on the XBox.  Only 600 for a 3\*!
---
Hmm, I didn’t think it would because it listed the Flatwoods monster as a separate entry on that checklist. I have never attempted one of the alien challenges though so I could easily be wrong.
---
I like to think they are taking the obvious way out of the CAMP limitations. Letting us buy/earn suites at the Whitesprings, much like the SWTOR stronghold apartments.  
---
Then we have instanced areas that we can decorate to our hearts content, safe from the environmental dangers. And give us a spawn place inside the hotel so we are not in the blast zone of a nuke. Leave, or even reduce, the mobile CAMP so we have a moveable camp and recovery site out there. Maybe reduce it to tents or some such. We'd have to judge the players reactions on that- some are very attached to their little homesteads.
---
Atom shop one
---
It's simple enough to tell where players spawn in your camp to be able to exploit it anyways. So if it's simply just for that fact then just the convince for the majority who use it as intended should be enough to justify adding a mat to spawn on.
---
What they need to address first is the bases loading in too late, which would mean lengthening the load screens whenever outside...
---
Maybe only having lengthened load screens when traveling to a player camp would work? But I'm no Bethesda employee so god knows what other kinks may lie deeper in the crevices
---
I use a fast swing mole miner gauntlet and I wreck people. I think your build is just not very good, or you need to change your play style to be able to kill people.
---
Better stuff is usually in the harder areas.
---
General consensus from what I gather is that the Flamethrower on account of the limited ammo crafting is still underperforming. 
---
I really would like to think they would address something like that before attempting to sell a skin for it. Then again, this isn't the first time they released a Flamer skin, and it was in a worse state in that instance. Oh well.
---
Someone’s probably already suggested this, but I haven’t seen it yet. Have you got level four Strong Back? It adds +40 to carry weight
---
Remember when melee was OP...?
---
It seemed to be one of those - some people never had it, others seen it a bunch - kinda bugs.
---
https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Thread:234034
---
Just leave one on the counter for a few days... preferably near some apples, should turn...
---
oh. banDana. NVM.
---
Legendaries will re-gen health, this is normal. Then there is a bug that's been in the game since the beginning where basically shots seem to register then the greyed out portion of remaining health bar fills back up. It is better now, much better. It seems to happen when firing rapidly and may be related to lag or something like that.
---
Any proof? I wasn't high enough level to try so I'm skeptical to someone just saying "you can't". Especially when I've had level 50+ yao gui and deathclaws as pets.
---
Haha.... What a lucky break .... I joined a random server and quess what..... She turned white and didn't have a chance .... There was a great team as well of course .    .... She only took of once...
---
Yep had the same experience. Stopped playing for a bit but then Backpacks and Scout Badges pulled me back in. But im getting to that point again.
---
Farming for the Hunters Long Coat, and trying for the Rare event outfits might have something to do with it. You can only do Feed the People, Back on the Beat, and Fertile Soil so many time before it starts feeling like a chore. That said i did get the Camo Jumpsuit thanks to Project Beanstalk! Guessing ive used up all my luck on that as i only had to do it 3 times before i got the Jumpsuit.
---
I did finally get around to launching a Nuke for the first time last night so there is that.
---
RNG is a cruel mistress.
---
And it's only a level 35..... Gonna find myself a upgrade .....
---
I use vats crit build  for me and gf it is indeed super effective but vats sometimes doesn't detect enemy players and when they're far and crouching it gets very difficult but it is very reliable way to deal sentinels. I was thinking of Vandgaurd's/high health builld paired with it vats obviously but not sure how that'd be
---
Yep.

Welcome to u/bethesdagamestudios_ , where the patches come constantly and so does the ignorance of doing QA before they hit live.
---
Do you have two different melee builds for pvp vs pve?
---
My mule once lost 800 lbs of junk that way. Someone nuked an area no one ever nukes and poof -- then some jackass ran up and snagged the bag. Sent me a message saying "gg noob" for some reason.
---
A few days ago someone posted about buying out a low level player's vending machine to give them a little pile of caps to play with, and it inspired me to do the same. Twice now I've found machines owned by people under level 20, and I spent 6k between the two of them buying every single thing they had.
---
One player must have freaked out, because he logged off less than a minute after I bought everything, but the second player sent me a very nice xbl message thanking me for visiting their vending machine. I told him to come back to camp because I had a present for him, and then I dumped almost everything I had just purchased (other than a fusion core) back at his feet and told him to use it all to refill his machines and pay it forward when he had more money than he knew what to do with.
---
I've also stopped selling most of the common plans, and I just hand them out to people who look like they could use an upgrade to their house.
---
In WS I had 3 - 3☆ Ghouls actually drop me 3☆ items (all crap btw) I feel like I shouldn't ever play the lottery again because I used all my luck.
---
There's a magical door where you live. There you will find a place like no other called "THE OUTSIDE" GO TO IT
---
Just don't plug in vending machine in that case ;)
---
Man, NO ONE sells it discounted on PC. Ugh.
---
and for the love of god give us raised planting beds so we can move crops indoors for greenhouses.
---
I pad my legendary stock with less-common non-legendary items that folks might want to use or scrap for a chance at a mod. Never sell them for more than what's recommended and often discount them.
---
I think an account wide bank would be more viable
---
Bethesda puts it up on their news section each week
---
K
---
I've sold plenty of plans at the prices I set, and that's at much higher prices than a couple caps.
---
Or where can I find it
---
Account wise anything would be nice. It would be great to not have to mule anything but I doubt they any plans to do anything about it. Unles you buy it from the atom shop.
---
Yeah, the same way I'm pretending the Alien Blaster dispatches enemies with one shot.  Man, those were the days, eh?
---
I dont use them because I'm never in power armour and armour penetration is locked behind being in power armour. HOWEVER they are the best guns in the game hands down if you use a good build for it. My bloodied 50 cal does almost 200 damage without heavy gun perks and the fire rate is over 100. That is totally nuts. The only thing to do more dps than heavy guns is melee. Gatling plasma, 50 cal, mg42 are all amazing weapons that with correct perks will tear thru a SB easily
---
I have one friend who plays, and neither of us can send invitations to each other. They just never arrive. The friends feature is 100% broken from my POV.
---
The best part of getting spawn trapped is when you traveling there spawns a scorchbeast. RIP that camp but he deserved it.
---
So you answered you're own question? 
---
It's in the atom shop.
---
Only one closest to that is the black bandana with a white skull.
---
if I am not mistaken the CAMP is loaded in for everyone when The CAMP owner joins a session. At least the “X/Y/Z” of every object is. It’s just a matter of loading in the models for everything when a player gets close to it. Otherwise you would see your CAMP build every time you traveled to it instead of just when you join a server.
---
If they offered it via the atomic shop, I guarantee they would be making 1000 atoms worth off of every single account that is registered.
---
I am always outside. Don't begrudge me the time I have indoors to do nothing productive.
---
Maybe 25% fire rate so people don't cry but jeez explosive lasers are beyond insane
---
Maybe they just drop three different one stars, or rather, you get the same amount of stars from the enemy but it may not be all on the same item.
---
It was in prior release notes that they delayed it.
---
every white springs run ends with a trip to the fountain, sneaky melee build here almost get hit zero times from ghouls yet get rad worms every single run must run down my knife into my eyes? or mouth?  almost silly how many times I get diseased with out taking a hit
---
I built a tiny little bedroom. Crouch in the corner, wedge the W key down with whatever I have nearby, then go clean my apartment, buy groceries, shower, whatever.
---
That’s really awesome! These kinds of stories are some much more fun to read about than when someone complains about not getting god-tier rolls on their millionth legendary. Keep up the charitable work man, those players you helped will remember that experience! And hopefully they’ll stick with the game and pay it forward eventually.
---
I just said to a friend that I think I'm finally done with 76, need to take a break until there's some end game content, and by end game content I mean repeatable raids with good loot. We badly need raids like other game have done (Destiny, WoW, ESO - those types of end game raids) and we need a better loot system that keeps you hunting for loot for longer. Raising gear level caps from 45/50 to 55/60 and making that tier of gear only available from new, very challenging instanced raids would help a lot.
---
Tanagra Town has a cave section with Crickets.
---
Every build seems to be better with stealth. It's a free damage multiplier, silly to ignore it!
---
Cam you point me to exactly where on their site? I cant seem to find it
---
Bloodieds are so easy to kill though. They arent OP. The only time a bloodied build should be a problem is if you run into someone whom is very good at pvp paired with a bloodied build; then you have a problem. I kmow guys who crush with junkies/ nocturnal/ berserkers/Anti armor. Everything needed to be good at pvp has been provided. Just need to learn how to make a proper build, see your enemy before they see you, learn how to aim. When to take certain chems/ how to mod your weapon (or have it modded) properly for your build. Watch youtube videos or your friends feeds on pvp. In essence...Get Better at the game and quit crying for Bethesda to MAKE you better.
---
I've seen another one with the western outfit bruh ill find it
---
I had this happen to me.  It stopped recognizing the waste I picked up after the fourth one and I couldn't complete the quest that time around because of it.  Now here's the interesting thing.  I picked up the fifth waste and searches for more when it wasn't counted.  The last Mutagenic Waste apparently stayed in my inventory despite me not being able to drop the waste off at the Kiddie Cabins.
---
When I started the quest again, I found that it still counted towards my next session, so I was done after picking up only 4 Mutagenic Waste items.  But what to do with the fifth?  Test it, naturally!  I picked up the fifth waste for a second time and deposited them at  the Kiddie Cabins, but now I have 2 Mutagenic wastes in my inventory.
---
Theoretically, if I repeated the quest enough times and kept picking up the extra waste, I'd eventually have 5 Mutagenic Waste items in my inventory and will be able to initialize the quest and turn right back around to complete it without running anywhere.
---
The potential for abuse, however, is really low.  It's only one glitched daily with crap rewards and it can hopefully be fixed as easily as removing **all** Mutagenic Waste from a player's inventory when they turn it in.
---
There is no black bandana in the atom shop. Only jangles and starts and stripes. If you’re referring to the stalker outfit then that’s an American flag and part of the outfit
---
400+ hours so far and I have only seen two. One of the two was a 3 star legendary and took me a solid half hour to kill. They are brutal, and I think their rareness should stay as it is.
---
No, I think that's the way the Quest is supposed to work.  However, if the Vox Syringer instantly disappears, no amount of going back to the is going to allow it to be returned.  :(
---
On PS I have my chat set to area at all times. Most people don't talk. But if you are looking to run around with someone feel free to add me. My psn is tuchflufygetdizy and I'm on fairly often.. Also running around bored. I'm happy to help you get some gear as well. Cheers!
---
I got one recently but I'm not sure where. May have been from the SBQ. I've not done any Brotherhood quests, but I do go annoy the SBQ when she's around.
---
No there's a cowboy one I'm just looking for something similar
---
There is so many other good game created just for PvP. Many of those games are Free to Play. 
---
Why, for the Love of Atom, you try to make a PvP from RPG? Fallout never was a good PvP and never will be a good PvP. 
---
PS. OP is a Duper.
---
Gatling. It eats ammo at a mush more useful rate, damage per shot is higher, and that makes up for the lower rate of fire from LMG or Minigun.  
---
I got minigun, LMG, .50, and gatling, and experimented a lot. I dropped them all in favor of the gatling. I can carry around 1500 rounds and be fine for triple SBQ fights with ammo left over. And the 5mm is cheap to make.
---
&gt;The best answer I can give to most of your questions is unfortunately, I don't know.
---
Oh, I get that. I was mainly thinking out loud on "how would I turn FO76 into a BR game?" and came up with this rambling stream of questions/challenges on how they'd balance this mode and make it fun.
---
There's a huge number of ways they can fuck this up, and very few ways I can think of that will provide a challenging yet balanced game mode for anyone who wants to play. It feels like the reputation regarding the game is starting to improve, and I'd hate for them to squander it by releasing a half assed version of a BR mode, so as much as I enjoy the occasionally round of PUBG or Fortnite, I'm really hesitant to get my hopes up on this yet.
---
 I love the entitled generation. ;)
---
Funny how easily we forget all of the Workshop ‘DLC’ fiasco.
---
Do you think it will take more effort to nerf bloodied or build everything else up?
---
My guess is the route requiring the least resources is gonna win.
---
You can find a black one with a skull at the raider vendors near top of the world
---
Yeah, the thing still runs through ammo faster than you can make it, I also agree beth should have either decreased the rate it's used at or just increase the quantity made per batch, because with ammosmith and Super duper, I can barely kill 50 enemies before using a good thousand fuel, and that's using sneak attacks and more.
---
For some odd reason, the chat slider on PS4 always resets to off/lowest position.
---
Have to reset it every time you start the game.
---
As already stated, a lot of people play without a mic, or are on party chat.
---
if the latter, they can hear you (over area chat), but you can't hear them unless they drop out of the party chat and switch to game chat.
---
Underpowered: another post says you've got like 5 hours in....so that probably puts you about level 15 or less.    It's going to take some time to build your levels/perks and obtain better weapons.
---
At sub20, a fireaxe and a 38 autopipe rifle were my friends, and even then I sometimes hated them :)
---
Then someone gave me a barbed baseball bat....
---
Is it just the Wooden Raised Foundation? Or does it happened to the concrete foundations as well?
---
Bloodied is also overpowered. I have a level 40 bloodied gatling, it melts anything I point it at. I usually run with a vampiric so I can survive without PA. I can chew through the big dogs easily, and the health regen lets me ignore the hits, for the most part.
---
Its the camo one it looms dark enough
---
Yea I now have over  1200 hours on this character and have played almost every day since beta and now I'm  just gonna  take a break I guess.
---
Yeah I saw they delayed it for the May 9th patch release but then I didn't see anything after that.
---
Ah yeeah, the bundle is limited but the individual items are to stay, it's probably one of those tactics that'll just draw people in quickly if they want to buy that PA skin, and then also get the Station cheaper. 
---
Marketing!
---
Well played. Well played indeed. 😂
---
Hell if they added a mailbox or something it would be very nice but who know maybe they dont want these things for some reason or another
---
How much and what system
---
I don’t remember seeing them give a timeframe either.
---
They're there, you just have to wait for them to load in. Kind of like that level 68 charred ghoul that starts kicking your ass for a solid minute before you can see him at the golf club if you enter before the world fully loads in.
---
and some of the descriptions are just as ridiculous. then at least give us a map or an area marker so we can figure it out for ourselves and not rely on google. makes me feel like a dumbass. 
---
fo3 and fo4 were more and more dumbed down, now nothing is clear. just find a middle already
---
LMAOO!!! Yes!!! That would be amazing!! 😂👍🏽
---
Level 222 Heavy Weapons reporting in. I run a [MG-42](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D7Gjv0fXoAANwR1.jpg) and it spits lead faster than I can gather it most of the time. Which is why I tend to carry a secondary Heavy Weapon with more plentiful rounds (sometimes an automatic rifle too). So worth it to watch it melt health bars though. 
---
I often raid Lucky Hole Mine for plenty of lead ore deposits (doubled if you're in Excavator PA) and you can usually buy bulk acid (and sometimes lead) from various vendors. Don't forget stacking Ammo Smith with Super Duper for maximum crafting potential. I think that's about it.
---
 They can build whatever they want. Mine is deep in the Mire.
---
 If you want to sell things seriously you will make a CAMP for selling things, not just an extension of the one you have now.
---
 Traps are fun. So, is trolling Scorchbeasts from their fissures, to respond to one. I'm essentially immune to most of their attacks and play with them all the time. ;)
---
Try any of the raider vendors, that’s usually where that kinda stuff hangs out.
---
 Is that your game name?
---
True but nowadays the cost of getting a viable bloodied weapon? Everything. (or purveyor luck but we don't talk about that)
---
I got a vampire Mr. Handy buzz blade and it's surprisingly almost perfect at keeping me alive. Only time I die is when I'm overwhelmed with enemies and lose a little more health then I get. I just wish I had 1 more stronger perk that made it stronger but I don't know too much about which perks I should use to make it stronger
---
I paid 660 on PS4. And refused to by the upgrade for 2300🥵
---
Turn them off lmao
---
 I'll kill it, after watching it work out. I hunt them for food.
---
You dont have any team supporting perks in there
---
-From the Free Range event-
---
Available weapon plans: Shepherds Crook, sheepsquatch shards, sheepsquatch club, and sheepsquatch staff. 
---
Crook mods: Horned, electrified, glass covered, toothed, and spiked
---
Club mods: Burning, barbed, burning barbed, electrified, poisoned, and heavy
---
Staff mods: Burning, barbed, Burning Barbed, electrified, poisoned, and heavy. 
---
Also the mutton meat pie recipe
---
I couldn't care less about PvE balance. That laser is broken though and should be fixed. The weapon isn't supposed to in the game because it's broken
---
Any Foundation concrete is actually empty inside
---
It's because you think nationalism is anything but brainwashed "my country is the best I will die for my country" bullshit.
---
rename it with a - or . as the first character.  It'll go to the top of the (apparel) list.
---
Sugar Grove is fine but I find the National Radio Astronomy Research Center to have a whole bunch of screws. Many of the desks on the bottom floor have a typewriter and/or a globe. There's also a fair amount of adhesive in there too. If I recall, I would pull about 25 to 30 screws per run through there.
---
keep fighting the good fight!
---
I went from 1 to 50 without perks or leveling up SPECIAL. I also didn’t—and still don’t—wear any armor or get any mutations. I found it really fun, and yeah, it’s doable. It feels really survival-ish, stealth-based and you have to carefully consider which encounters to fight or flee in and manage ammo and Stimpaks well
---
I know. I was on my phone and didn’t have the newer one I made which is on my computer
---
This is the only guaranteed spawn in the game, there is a very rare chance for one to appear during a super mutant attack however!
---
definitely, something bugged with explosive lasers.
---
Did you realize they stay in your inventory and count towards the Operation Tidy quest?  If you save up 5, you don't even need to run to the cleanup site.
---
Depends on your build and food items. If you are bloodied, definitely don't get the extra carry weight. That will practically negate most all of your armor and rad protection.
---
I got the armored backpack mod for when I’m fine with my carry weight but want a little extra damage protection (bloodied build). I also carry the increased capacity backpack with me in case I get over encumbered and need to fast travel or run away
---
Pacify a hound of some sort and send him to your camp
---
Good points all around.  I think it may be valuable to rattle off the perk investment for bloodied vs other things.  aka pistol vats which at 15 agi/15 luck I have about half the perk choices, with the caveat choices are GOOD.  Does bloodied actually have to make choices?  I think that may be the big point to all of this:  perk investment on bloodied is actually in a pretty sweet spot, whereas perks for berzerker... well maybe they don’t exist, would like to see them be the stat based DR points, and the stat based DR boosters shouldn’t impact your DR for berzerker calcs.  That to me would be a good trade-off/choice option.
---
Junkies is pretty fun way to play crippling yourself as well. Would love to see it be an option.
---
I think one thing we have to admit (well that I’ll concede) is that we can have a solid PvE game if we just don’t care about PvP impact, or vice versa, or just build around 2 rulesets.  WoW did this for a long time with mixed results.
---
There are pros out there. You can tell, they put it near the Vault so travel is cheap. There are some very good vendor CAMPs, but many are not.
---
 Remember this is retail and the 'customer is always right'. ;)
---
Man, this guy's sort of a douche.
---
I appreciate that Bethesda made it where if I click to try the next world, it always gets stuck on loading.
---
Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't be against a less cumbersome trade system. I'd especially love being able to manually enter values with a keyboard, just as a start. 
---
But we have the system we have, and there are smarter ways to go about the process right now than what OP is describing as his current method. 
---
We can both WANT a better system, and work smarter with the system we're forced to use.
---
For god's sake, use imgur
---
Wow I didn't know that I think ive seen them once or twice during an attack
---
I reply just to ask, which challenges do you find trouble with descriptions?
---
Again, sounds like an entitled and butthurt post. Need some aloe vera?
---
Just hit up luck hole mind with an excavator PA you will get enough lead to make alot of ammo even without super duper
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAha...
---
Wait. You're seriously asking? Do ghouls give rads and diseases? YES Heavy guns are freaking amazing. They are the best sustained dps in the game.

---
There you go man. Welcome to the club of people who actually kill the SBQ in under 5 minutes consistently. 
---
For ammo efficiency, gatling gun is king and works very well for every day farming of bloated glowing ghouls, super mutants, etc.
---
For SBQ, use a .50 cal. Farming ammo for it may seem rough at first, but it's really not. All the activities I do to farm materials to make ammo are also great for farming legendaries and making caps. At this point I'm sitting on 300K+ ultracite .50 cal and max caps on 2 accounts. I'm pretty much retired from the game now lol. And unlike other weapons, a prime receiver on the .50 cal is a HUGE dps boost. It's 50% more damage over the standard weapon vs. queen.
---
You can just lower the spawn rate of 3 star enemies if you don't want 3 stars to be as common. It's much less frustrating than laying into a 3 star and getting shit in return.
---
I looked for that and realized it too. Sorry man!
---
Oh okay. I have a lot of hours in this game and of all the perks I've seen that I just dont use, I think having a teammate share revenant 2 and reviving me every 2 minutes for that sexy 50% damage boost would be the best thing. Dont use rad sponge unless you know your team mates want less rads(I dont want less rads and my health bar is 80%rads). Dont share solar powered for the same reason.
---
This would be crucial for me. I have a bloodied Gun build, my Endurance is low and to compensate for lack of Food satiation boost cards I have the Carnivore Mutation and 1 in Cannibal. It's very hard for me to sort through my aid and keep track of my meats, it's especially annoying when I plan on eating it the moment I find it. This would be great for all Food/Drink. Like you Hold a for two seconds and you consume the food.
---
I agree that setting traps for players is stupid, and merits having one's own camp destroyed. - If it were possible.
---
Wait until level 50 to do the quest at Morgantown Airport to get a 1* anti armor 44. It works pretty well for pve
---
You can sort by SPOIL, not sure how this works though.
---
I get them for 17.5k with hard bargain and unyielding armor. Interestingly, chems that increase charisma don't reduce that price. 
---
I'm fully aware that it was a lucky score. I'm just pointing out that "can't" is the wrong word. "unlikely" absolutely, but it's worth keeping an eye out as you visit camps.
---
Your Aid tab is often a problem. Go to your stash and dump everything. Make yourself a naked character with nothing.  
---
Now equip only your armor, ammo, and weapons.  
---
Now you have your base empty weight. Base everything off of this number. For my main PA melee guy, this is 190lbs. For my sniper it is 120. Knowing this lets you know you have some unaccounted for weight. Usually a ton of food or aid, which is easy to accumulate without noticing. I like to carry a set number of radaway, stims, and when possible a stack of a food/water combo like soups. All else gets sold. water and dog food with good doggy is a great way too.
---
I find 3 weapons are my thing. Main, backup, and fast melee for clearing the low level mobs. I searched for weight reduction legendaries for backup and melee. They are often very cheap with main stats no one wants like Ghoul Slayer or Mutant slayer. They are backup weapons, so don't sweat them too much.   
---
Others have metioned the misc tab. Ore and gunpowder can add up fast. So can mods. 
---
Find your baseline weight, and you can better manage things, knowing when something is weighing you down before it builds up too many of that.
---
Bro thanks for the tip
---
Dang. We've been left in the lurch :(
---
Never! Tinypic shall never surrender!
---
I suggest watching the Datamines and plan accordingly. But yeah Daily/Weekly Challenges are not worth it most times. I get it, If they give out Atoms willy nilly they wont ever have people buying Atoms. I just hate how they progressed from really easy to next to impossible lately. That said the one involving Crickets that's not really that impossible if you know where to look.
---
Thankfully I knew the Stalker outfit was coming from the Datamines so i farmed a ton of the Scorched Combat challenges i hadn't done yet (Kill 76 of them with weapon types i dont normally use) and will have enough for it and the Arktos Ext Paint. Was waiting to see how much the Stalker Outfit was going to cost (i had estimated 700-800 so pretty close) before buying anything
---
i assumed this was added so you couldn't fast travel spam - not sure if i like this feature or not haha
---
I once had a dead dragon follow me everywhere I went.
---
I’m living East of top of the world, might have to move my house for those kitties.
---
Only think you need to really hunt for is gunpowder. What type of ammo do you use?
---
Google nuke codes week x-x fallout76
---
Maybe a dumb question, but how exactly does having extra weight negate anything?
---
Oh, come on who cares :) I have Blackbird and it should come back because it is awesome and people want it. PS they do this so people will watch the shop closely. It's a tease. Give, take away, give, take away,.
---
I'll probably do that. I'm basically only using a gauss rifle right now because it deals enough damage to handle most enemies down quickly.
---
The second half is good, the first half is wrong
---
&gt; Pioneer scout quests.
---
So easily said, conveying none of the heartache to come.
---
I'm sure 9/10 people would take a shout out for their mod as enough payment. Hell it's already free.
---
No, it doesn't take long to see where someone spawns if you're selling anything worth a shit, I have had people fast travel to my camp before it has even finished loading (just joining a server). It is something you'll see pretty quickly if you spend any amount of time at your camp.
---
Either way, if it isn't something currently being abused there's absolutely no reason to believe it would suddenly become a problem.
---
And yet again, most people aren't traveling around full of junk, so very few people have anything to lose either way. It's simply *a non issue*.
---
Yep, I'm upto 3 of them now.
---
2 more and I get my free ~~coffee~~ quest completion
---
But y it lock?
---
Be super careful not to trip.
---
You should be able to find legendary pistols from player vendors or the scrip vendor.  They're around, just a bit less common.  I picked one up cheap yesterday (explosive +other stuff, under 1K caps).
---
They're not as powerful as other builds, but it seems like they could be viable for normal day to day fighting.
---
This was the build I’m kinda feeling.   But it’s difficult peeking out with the wacky broadsider relying on so many perks.
---

lul
---
Remember F04, how water went straight to your stash as it was created by your purifiers?
---
Top tier is anti armour swing speed pf with unyielding if u want
---
"two shot explosive bloodied weapons" not possible. two shot and bloodied are both primary effects
---
I have found that I love that "unused" third star to be "reduce junk/ammo/pharm weight by 20%" is an awesome thing. It all seems to be stacking.
---
That’s good to know, never thought of that. Lucky Hole Mine has a bunch of crystal ores but you need acid to break them down.
---
you can't trade backpacks. it won't appear in trade and if he/she drops it, it destroys it.
---
Yeah but for some reason they can't do that, otherwise all the creation club content would be free and it's not. Mods have to be paid for. Unless Bethesda gives them away.
---
It's not just you. This is a core issue with the game in general, that came over from 4. In that game, people who had a stable 60fps experience in the wider world could often drop to 15-20 in more densely cluttered areas. It was discovered that if you took the time to properly combine meshes (a fair few mods did this with 4) the problem pretty much goes  away or at least is greatly reduced. So... it's yet another example of questionable game design.
---
Heavy guns is awesome. But the drawback is you cant store away ur weapons, or you shouldn't. Because of bear arms I carry about 20 different weapons on me at all times because they weigh too much to store away. It is awesome holding an arsenal of destruction tho
---
I forgot the commas.

Go to nukacrypt.com. They have the unscrambled codes each week for all three silos, no need to get all the code pieces.
---
Not sure about the poster, but i mainly use 5mm
---
Oh man that is a steal, even just for scrip
---
Earn 8 more bagdes and sell the plan.  Rinse, repeat.
---
(I'm assuming you still get plan, and just have to learn it now instead of the bug...can anyone verify that?)
---
https://nukacrypt.com/  I'm sure someone could chime in and explain the deciphering process, but this link will get around all that I believe.
---
If you don't want to get griefed by a sack of shit, don't bother with workshops.
---
Bad programming is bad
---
challanges are not quests or missions. they're not supposed to show you where to go. you're supposed to just do it. like all the other challanges for atoms that don't show up on the map when you track them...
---
😘
---
Bout 5 swings from a 2 hander, not even maxed out.
---
Gunpowder is stupid easy. It's cloth and acid. If you have issues getting acid, there are multiple acid seeps you can place an extractor camp on out in the wasteland.
---
I think bloodied should have the same damage as the max buff from berserkers
---
Premade signs should take up a single XYZ coordinate since it's a single object.
---
Oh me, a random guy on the internet making an obviously exaggerated and facetious comment on a video game message board? Actually, I happen to be an expert.
---
I run with 3 Backpacks in my Inventory all the time (only 1lbs each) - Max Capacity, Standard, and Armor Plated. I swap as needed. Overencumbered load up Max Capacity. Going into a hard Fight Armor Plated. Usually most of my time is with the Standard Level 50 one though +60 Carry Capacity.
---
Max Capacity does have downsides -60 Energy and Radiation Resistances but +120 Carry Weight.
---
Once i pair down my Meds/Food tab i plan on running the Armor Plated as much as i can for a +90 Damage Resistance with a +30 Carry Weight.
---
I get enough food or meat looting i wouldn't worry about refrigerated personally. Might be useful for flux though.
---
This reads like a weird personals ad.
---
The current codes are listed at [https://nukacrypt.com/](https://nukacrypt.com/).
---
If you're on PS4 and want some help with a silo, lmk.  PSN Neojinnx.
---
As should sitting down...
---
Like others said, the lights help a little but not much. I've given up on turrets and just repair as needed.
---
I couldn’t care less about PVP, and would prefer it being removed from the game rather than make further changes to PVE gameplay.
---
Yeah its good to have around even for a swap out if you need to vendor or script some gear.. I kept mine at a 3 star 30 pounds so I could swap out a 3 card (blocker) so I could still fast travel.   If your using excavator armor the carry bug still hasn't been patched so just make sure you repair your main weapon at the end of a session and be in your power armor when you start and you will enjoy an extra 100 pounds carry weight until you exit your armor if you stock up on fusion cores and keep your armor in good repair you can keep it on the whole time that extra hundred pounds is nice for mat collecting .
---
It isnt as easy to get as lead or steel is what I saying and if your smelting that takes acid as well so less to use to make gunpowder
---
It's the reason I don't play on survival mode, I don't stand a chance with higher or luckier or richer players.
---
Thanks, man. I'll add you in about an hour, when I get home from work. I'm a level 36 and still learning.
---
So you wanna sell some of that ultracite .50 cal? :) I have a tse prime .50 cal but rarely use it
---
With super duper and ammo smith you can really make alot of 5mm
---
I would think loading the CAMP whenever someone joined a session could cause some issues with the constant server hoping that people do, but I won't deny I don't know 100% how they have it.
---
Yeah, got max ammo smith but still working on super duper
---
RNG is mean.
---
The grammar in OP's post is critical. When you separate words with commas in this context, you are separating items in a list. 
---
So, if he had said "Two shot explosive bloodied weapons" he would, indeed be incorrect. Since he said "two shot, explosive, and bloodied" you are incorrect. 
---
I love being able to be a pedantic asshole when other people are being pedantic assholes.
---
I think location does play a part in rewards, at least in regards to level. Most of the events in the Forest region don't have real high leveled enemies to deal with, like "Project Beanstalk" where you protect a Mr.Handy from a few molerats and low leveled stingwings. Something like "One Violent Night" in the Savage Divide on the other hand, has you facing a large number of feral ghouls ranging from lvl 42-68 and eventually a legendary Wendigo near the end. Same goes for horde events as i've gotten three star legendaries from horde event bosses in the Forest region, but they often range from lvl 5-10, wheras horde bosses in the Savage Divide drop closer to lvl 40-45.
---
That thing rules.
---
Western Duster
---
Right on. Getting people to think about the mode critically instead of instantly writing it off was my main goal with this post, and I appreciate your feedback.
---
Balance is super important, and the more mechanics they have, the harder things become to balance. But the extra mechanics are what could make it interesting, and appealing to me. I really wish they would have focused on meeting balance concerns with patches, but it seems like they're too overwhelmed with bug fixes and content updates to build a track record of thoughtful game balance.
---
It would be nice if people came around to the game, but there will always be people that talk shit no matter how good it gets. I just want to play fun games.
---
I find them on player vendors for around 1000 fairly often. One star bloodied. Two useful stars bumps them in to the 2k range, and 3 stars hits 2500-3k.  
---
Anything explosive is impossible to find, or priced out of this world. It is a "would be nice" thing, but I am not going to cry if I never find one. I got an AA/crippling/reduced weight combat shotgun that dropped in WesTek I am stoked about. With the enforcer perk, it will one-shot cripple anything most of the time. I'll take that instead a TSE shotgun and be quite happy with it.
---
180 per with ammo smith doubled when super duper procs
---
Need people to do it with to beat it.  Its not designed to do solo.
---
Out of the 50 or so times ive done it failed maybe... 5 or 6
---
Happy cake day
---
There’s actually a bug where if you move the camera at all when leaving a bench it engages and re-enters. 
---
If you hit ok to leave the bench - don’t move till the animation finishes and it won’t yank you back in.
---
Because of the crazy debuffs you get from wearing it. I’ve watched people try and play with it and it makes you extremely vulnerable against everything.
---
Lol, sounds accurate.
---
You found a cave cricket there today? I just hopped 3 more times, got ghouls twice and mireluks once, still no cave cricket.
---
I run bloodied big guns too. My bloodied gatling plasma does insane damage
---
It's what the high capacity mod does. It hurts rad and physical resistance so bad.
---
There's one you can build in!
---
Backpacks are light. I started with carry weight, because being able to fast travel with more shit is always valuable. I'm going to get the fridge mod next, because being able to grind up more food and not have it cost perk points is also a time saver. Last is going to be the armored, because more DR in fights is useful...and all it costs in carry weight is a total of 3 points.
---
That mod also comes with a penalty to ER/RR.
---
Yeah, I noticed this as well. But it shouldn’t work like that; it should just snap to wherever we’re looking
---
I didnt say i was entitled to it but at the same time... why? Its not like we can steal stuff from their camp or destroy it on adventure mode. I just enjoy seeing other peoples camps
---
1. To be fair, 4k stimpacks is not hard to come buy. You can farm/craft that in s couple days if you know what you're doing. 
---
2. I don't mind dupers. I feel like they make the game MORE balanced. I'm glad i don't get mowed down anymore by a talentless enemy with an explosive laser rifle anymore because now everybody has them and they aren't special. 
---
3. Whats this guys GT? I want some that radshield 😂.
---
I agree with your larger point, but stealth is already in a good place, except that it doesn’t play well with others. We need more viable team builds that aren’t crippled when solo.
---
Not today, but this challenge has appeared before. It took me like 15 hops.
---
Agreed. I don’t think the game is very good. BUT I recently came back after leaving shortly after launch. Fo76 is really capturing my imagination with the basic scavenge runs and survival slant. 
---
I gave what looked like a new player a gang of supplies since it looked like he was struggling. I don’t have endless supplies. I’m properly post-apocalyptic poor. However, it was an interesting video game moment and he seemed pretty jazzed. 
---
Outside of the basic loop I enjoy. I’m finding a lot of the game is just wack. From boring quest stuff to buggy shit like sometimes I can’t walk forward with W until I move backwards. WTF. 
---
The PVP is also completely stupid. I really wish they would flesh out PVP so these wasteland moments could be more tense and dangerous when encountering other players.
---
...this is nonsense. I run a bloodied build and I barely notice a difference when I'm running the extra carry weight pack.
---
If you start crowdfunding i got you.
---
10/10 would lmao again!
---
If you don't mean stuck in a foundation maybe reword that little title you have going. Cause it sure as hell doesn't read like that.
---
Normally, but not this week.

Back to step 1
---
They did so as well this week lol, they just updated their last one.
---
Try changing it to 'area'.  If I have problems, that usually helps but I'm usually in party chat.
---
PSN Neojinnx if you want to play and don't mind dark humor, crass language, and stupid jokes.  There's usually 4 - 6 of us on in the evenings.
---
It depends, very much on how dedicated you are to scrounging as you play. I never run out of acid. I never run out of plastic. I do run out of steel and lead.
---
**STRONG SMASH**
---
Yeah so you can pull some scorchbeasts over like a bored griefer? Lol
---
Ain't nobody got time for Fancy Lad Snack Cakes.
---
Yeah, the core concepts of "super lucky super rare drops making you massively more powerful" and "fair and balanced PVP gameplay" cannot exist in the same game. Which is why I always get frustrated when they devote more and more dev time to stupid fucking PVP bullshit.
---
I got to the point when I'm going to the forest I take off all my armor lol
---
I always thought a 10 mm tse would be a fun sidearm to own just to blast at low lvl areas, and I found a nice 3 star one in a player vendor and I was right.
---
its not horrible practical but I modded to auto and the big clip and its a hoot it remains my favorite player vendor find thus far. every now and then you will find that Mickey Mantle at a garage sale you just have to keep your eyes open.
---
So much this.
---
Agreed, I just want more pve and story content.
---
I cant pick up alot on my current character lol no pack rat
---
 A Scorchbeast should destroy most CAMPs. Its not a player attack, its your guns pissing off my companion. ;)
---
I made a post earlier today suggesting some sort of way to trade between player characters. Someone replied with the idea of a bank account. My thoughts on that are let players rent a safety deposit box in a bank. It costs caps to keep the box and has a limit to it and all the player characters can access the same deposit box. Put a limit on it of 250 and subtract 50 from each character total in their stash. Separately allow a shared account that costs caps to open and maintain. The cap limit should be 25k and subtract from each character 5k from their limit that they can have on them at a time. Vendor sales that exceed the new 20k limit go to the bank account if there's availability. If it is at the limit they go to the ether like they do now.
---
Grahm stops by for chit chat.
---
I don't have any need for caps sorry, have 9 characters (2 accounts) mostly maxed out. I mostly just log in to kill SBQ for fun with friends, and I'd rather hold onto the ammo so I don't have to farm for it. Might take me a few months but I will go through it and then have to start farming flux and stuff again.
---
Gonna be honest though, TSE is a waste of space at this point. Go B25.
---
I would suggest doing to the Manual Way at least once. After that i plan on just looking up the Nuke Code.
---

---
All the stuff we can buy in the atomic shop and bethesda only goves you so little budget
---
True but we all know the only real endgame challenge is how long you will last while not get contracted with radworms.
---
as in the one I took a photo of? It was too full of junk that I wouldn't be able to scrap. I also think it was "too close" to Morgantown Airport or whatever to place my CAMP
---
Check what the mod does then, and compare stats.
---
 I really don't see much point in running multiple characters in this game, beyond carry mules. 
---
I also find that when it comes to gunpowder, I get about 1/4 of what I need when I'm farming super mutants for steel.
---
Someone's gonna end up spamming the n word or something of the sort.
---
 least I know someone running blooded and it had better minor attributes than the Gat they already had
---
I have no idea what to do with the third roll, a two shot laser pistol
---
Ive only seen them three times. One at the twin lakes spawn, one attacking Whitespring, and one at Abandoned Bog Town.
---
 So traps are fun, but Scorchebeasts attacking your CAMP is not? It would be for me, as I love to watch them at work.
---
 And really, its you lot that bear the entitled tag. ;)
---
The first time I found one of those... it was so jarring. Pristine, clean, sparkly, inside and out. I thought it WAS a player CAMP.
---
But yeah, I'd love to have one.
---
Strength and endurance bonuses for mutants, plus new mutations or possibly variants similar to nightkin etc
---
Up until this morning, I've never had more than 5k caps in the bank, so I usually only pick up 1\* stuff to scrap, but this made me want to get it just to play with, especially since I play with Vanguard gear which doesn't play well with bloodied.
---
A B25 .50 cal is unobtainable with caps on PC. Same for BE. I've offered 125K caps and been turned down multiple times. You need to trade multiple godlies for one of those things (which I did, begrudgingly).
---
I want the to add a Wiffle mod, full of holes for a faster swing rate.
---
Alright, glad to know it's not just me then. X)
---
Mistress of mystery go to site Charlie there should be a body of a woman loot it
---
You: *yeah i've finally set up my camp!*
---
Mirelurk: *you really sure it's safe here?*
---
You made me spit my drink out.  Well done.  Billy Ocean would be proud.
---
Nice video...that was a fast kill!
---
A fitting fate for any cannibal!
---
Its actually possible to block off every opening in the factory and farm ammo forever in it given they don't have more people contesting than you. I usually block every door and every opening with the glass shelf and the garage with the concrete wall from the defense section.
---
Yeah I don't bother with it most of the time anymore. I'm bloodied so I die in one hit anyway lol.
---
Google knows
---
I have different builds I run on different characters. It's much faster to just level a new one then to move special points back and forth. I have a pure damage stealth sniper a support sniper and a gunslinger.  All there special points are way different so I need more then one character
---
Clearly you haven't been to any fandom sites.
---
I'd rather raise it to 80%/90%+ health, since the Mister Sandman stealth build, the Berserker naked build, and the Banker crit build stacks with ~~the main junkie build and~~ each other. In other words, a "stealth berserker ~~junkie~~ crit" compound build is perfectly doable.
---
Some perks can be ported from a Bloodied to a Berserker build already (e.g. Serendipity and Dodgy doesn't lose effectiveness in both builds, you die in a hit in a Berserker build so irradiating yourself until Serendipity is active is no issue)
---
EDIT: realized that Berserker's and Junkie can't be on the same weapon.
---
B25?
---
Or
---
Mirelurk: *am i a joke to you?!"
---
I feel so dumb. I honestly don't care about the factory that much, I just hate how It almost always belongs to a high level player who is op
---
What knid of ammo?
---
 So you are going to reset your CAMP, whatever that means, "just for me" but now you need anonymity?
---
 I guess chickenshit would be a good description.
---
Be careful if you do this. You can freeze yourself if you're too close with crystalizing barrel, as it's "explosive".
---
Please tell me I’m not the only one that struggled to read it😂😂😂😂
---
Do not need bread crumbs but god does the UI need to let us display a tracked challenge requirements to prevent having to go into the map, into the challenges, into the world challenges, into the specific challenge... just to double check where we are. 
---
That and the time required to complete all of them should be sufficient to earn the available rewards, 1 badge for typically multiple hours of work is ridiculous.
---
But, this doesn't need to be a mod, it needs to be a patch. 
---
Mods were free in F04 before Beth pulled their shit on everyone. I love them, but sometimes I swear...
---
25% faster fire rate. Far superior DPS for SBQ since explosive damage doesn't do much to her.
---
I've spent at least 3k script at the purveyor and haven't received a single explosive weapon. Beer weapon so far is a bloodied bone hammer 😢
---
They should tweak berserkers to ONLY count DR/ER from armor. So mutations, perks, even legendary effects might get a pass (did you know Chameleon mutation with Strange in Numbers adds 40 or 50 DR?).
---
Level 1/5 Vanguard’s armor? Maybe viable! No armor/ all mutations and perks? Max Berserker output!
---
Best way is either to buy or produce your own. You can equip ammo smith to make extra rounds and super duper for chance to double anything you craft. 
---
You'd just have to farm the materials... lead, steel, gunpowder etc
---
You stole that title from my dating profile.
---
A couple days ago i fast traveled to a guy’s camp, but it kept dropping me into a small locked room in the interior of his house with 2 switches.  I can’t leave through the door, so i fast travel to the next camp over.  I fast travel back and I’m in the same room again.
---
I pull 1 switch.  Nothing.  On.  Off.  Nothing.  I check the map.  It powered his vending machines.  I pulled the other switch.  I fast travel back to the next camp and then run back to his.  His place is a maze and after i make it through scrapping and checking his inventory i turn around to see a giant garage door which no longer opens because i cut off power to the building.
---
308 for my mg42
---
THIS lol
---
Happend to me at red rocket station. I was like - *naaaaah... Take it, i don't want it that much*
---
I actually have experienced the exact same hang/freeze!  Normally, I'll still get an automatic dump, but I've found I can create one from the task manager.  Of course...damn thing is 8gb.  But you can use WinDbg to extract the parts folks have been pasting here, and then delete the original dump file.
---
Super mutants? Have to be dumb as shit... limited to certain weapons, and lack access to certain tech. No usage of human sized armour at all. Reduced effectiveness of chems due to body mass.
---
Ghouls? I'd say some chems wouldn't work AT ALL. Would have to be some way to represent degeneration of mental function etc. Maybe a "typhoid mary" kinda thing... where they can carry and spread disease while being unaffected?
---
Mine must be in the same spot, I always venture down and claim his caps and junk every time I load in.
---
Always a lvl 50 and occasionally a Legendary.
---
I feel sorry for him,Such a big dude yet chopped down within seconds. 
---
He needs a few mates or Family members. That pond should be a “no go area”
---
Craft it. 
---
Farm lead ore at lucky hole mine (Wear EX PA) Farm acid from Yai Guai at mountainside bed and breakfast. And farm steel at Welch Station kill everything scrap the weapons with Scrapper perk on. You'll have an abundance of ammo. Oh if you want shotgun shells head to Watoga HS for plastic.
---
It's in the outskirts of the pumpkin town, but it's really close to a fissure site. I think it's quite empty inside apart from a skeleton. I'm 99% sure you can place your camp there though.
---
There is another one that is on a hill near flatwoods, but I can't remember if that's campable or not :-).
---
Some weapons can spawn with mods on them even if they dont have those mods normally. I have two Serrated Bowie Knifes and early on i also got a Serrated Cultist Dagger.
---
You're right.  Here it is: https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/440xkbWi5YJKr6XyN2YAMW/atomic-shop-patch-9-items-and-sales
---
 You mean the body, the title is very simple. Just a request for simplicity.
---
 Yeah if I get stuck in your place I'll just go on to the next. If stuff is hard to find I'll do the same. If its in a bad place like across from the Charleston Station, I won't even visit.
---
How do you manage to get close to people with melee? I am able to kill people already no problems just want to try something new other than bloodied. Never had anyone come so close to me to kill me with melee though so I wonder how you do it
---
Clearly you missed the joke. Your title makes you sound entitled as hell. Basically demanding people change their camps to suit you as if you're the only customer that exists. Take for instance my camp. People are unlucky enough to spawn in the foundation unless they move out the way quick enough. I would have to fully reset my camp. Lose caps and hours just to rebuild to fix this. So to suit you, I'd have to rework that. No thanks.
---
Oh no I'm level 61 but i just feel my character is trash
---
I couldn't find it on Google mate
---
I'm high level but don't have much in terms of the best gear in the game so the same happens to me. I just have a strategy to help. Lock all doors, block them. You can get a water purifier down and plant probably at least 1 or 2 corn/carrot so you don't die. It becomes a pretty fortified fortress after that. Only issue is people can take it if they outnumber you. Used to be able to hold it forever like that when the workshop required you to touch the bench to contest haha
---
thanks mate
---
There’s also a woman inside a house at whitesprings in a shower that has a note and a scarf loot that. It should be if you are looking away from the club house towards whitesprings on the row of houses in front of you the house closest to whitesprings.
---
My bad 😔
---
Yeah right.  It was hard enough finding 8 that weren't bugged and you could actually finish.  I dont think it lets you do it twice anyways.
---
I wish balance and bugs were higher priority...
---
Does the alpha scale to the number of players?
---
One thing is the clown costume - in atomic store and as well found in game for free.
---
Still dont get why it's in the atomic store
---
The Fuk is This?
---
well it is established in fallout 3 that jet barely works on ghouls at all by the barber in underworld, ooh there could be a side quest line to develop ultra versions of all the chems that would work for ghouls but be toxic to human characters. 
---
as for the intelligence thing maybe they radiation heals them over time but as your rad count goes up you gradually lose intelligence and perception points until when you hit max rads you go feral.
---
Can confirm. I have my camp there, he is literally always there.
---
Your welcome! Happy nuking 👍🏼
---
Ok but that's now how you made it sound chief. People can get trapped in camps without an actual "trap".
---
I am a huge fan of the odder weapon with the single action revolver being my favorite (I know it’s terrible), so I think the idea of broadsider control build is very cool.  I have a few ideas based on my experience, but I am no expert on the broadsider or heavy weapons for that matter.  I am also by no means trying to criticize you or your build.  It may work for you, and that is how you should play.
---
I will say that your overall build lacks focus meaning you are using four different weapons and most of them, save the broadsider, don’t benefit from your perk set.  If you threw in a rank or two of ordinance express (if needed)  and fire in the hole, you could also lob grenades in an arc as you have the other perk cards to enhance explosive damage.  Any explosive weapons would benefit from your set up, so even an explosive 10mm would be boosted. I would also recommend the multi shot canister.
---
S-  I find weight reduction or carry weight perks to be a complete waste of perk card slots, but I do recognize that cannon balls are very heavy.  Drop Bear Arms, three perk points for one weapon is not worth it.  You can get weapon weight reduction on legendary armor.  I am also assuming this is not a Power Armor build.  I would also drop strong back and take blocker for the damage reduction.  Deep pocket some of your armor and get a back pack to mitigate the loss of Strong Back.
---
P- Take at least one Fire in the Hole, you can move points from Endurance. 
---
E- I would get rid of both the perks you have as they just don’t give enough benefits for their cost.  Take Fireproof instead, it will save you from blowing yourself up.  You can afford to take 3 to 6 points out of Endurance if you want.
---
C-
---
I-
---
A- Three more points here from Endurance could get you 30% damage to your 10 mm pistol.  But honestly unless you are fully perked for gunslinger/guerrilla pistol damage is underwhelming.
---
L- Tormentor is for your Assault Rifle?  I would drop it unless you are fighting a boss or you are using a commando rifle.  Take Starched Genes 2
---
I hope this gives you some ideas for the direction you could take your character.  At higher levels you gain the flexibility to use way more perk cards.
---
Heh, I have the opposite problem. I’m that weirdo who keeps jumping up and down when trying to search trash cans at the Whitespring. Approach it carefully, look right at it, the search option is right there in the window—DAMMIT okay only the robots saw that and they don’t judge, just act cool NOT AGAIN. Sometimes I search while also high-jumping, which is fun.
---
(I also still keep hitting the old button to open my stash, but that’s another story)
---
Upvote because would like to have.
---
When you leave V9 outside of the zone, don't put the circle right up next to it. Just get the fissure inside the circle and leave the space between the fissure and V9 open. SBQ loves to land just to the east of V9, and when you put the circle right against V9 that is still inside the blast zone.
---
I second this. It's hard to do but worth it in the end. It's a part of the game and why not do it at least once, you paid for the game get your money out of it.
---
i use an instigating meat hook with faster swing speed, it one shots almost everything without much help, as long as you get the first hit
---
Hey times are tough. We can’t all be dog food upper class.

 I demanded nothing. I asked VENDORS to keep it simple so buying is easy. As I will probably get stuck in your CAMP's foundation, I won't buy anything from you. 
---
 I have a lot of caps folks.
---
To the majority popular upvoted posts,  not everyone has the same luck as you do. Granted they shouldn't always be God rolls, but considering what can drop it's not like your actually gonna get what you want immediately.
---
Last I checked (and it's been a bit), you could also earn them from the campfire event.
---
Barring that, I doubt that they'll let you give away / sell rewards like that for a complicated quest line.
---
True, but I thought the small size of those signs would not take up much build room, but your explanation makes me realize that size doesn't really matter as much as the fact that multiple tiny signs have to be mapped in space and placed so I may want to cut down on the number (I have a bunch).
---
Lol, yea I’ve seen you around.
---
I'm fully aware of what it does. I run a bloodied+rad build, I always stay down at or bellow 20% health with a full rad bar, and I've noticed _no  significant difference in viability of my build_ with the modded backpack on. 
---
You take more rad damage. That is, if you waste anything on your armor for rad reduction. (I don't, so -60 rad protection means literally nothing to me, because it doesn't go bellow 0). 
---
You loose 60 energy protection. So what. I'm sitting at 228DR and 348ER, without the backpack. With the backpack, I still have 288 ER. Which means energy weapons are still less effective against me (and I'll point out, significantly MORE rare) than every supermutant with a stick, or a rifle. Or a dogs bite, for that matter. 
---
I don't get the basis for your argument. I legitimately don't. The -60 ER from the high capacity mod is a non-issue.
---
Spot on. With a couple of perk points heavy weapons weigh next to nothing. My stealthy heavy weapon build avoids power armor (except for the SBQ) and I carry a half dozen optimized heavy weapons at the weight cost of a single handheld. I do love rifles but BGS doesn't treat them right IMHO.
---
I read canvas... I smell downvotes incoming.
---
Cover you with an up for a lol
---
I'm available to chat via mic on Friday evenings.
---
And he's happy to see you.   Red rocket, red rocket!!!
---
Why don’t we spawn in the same place as visitors do?
---
So the plan is called "letters and signs". If I'm not mistaken it's letters and the open sign. Maybe we should change the name to "letters and sign"?
---
If you’re overwhelmed, head down to the lower level (code is on three print outs in the three habitat areas), kill a couple of ghouls and take a breather - scrap items make some more stimpaks, or just wait for the event to end. The door closes automatically so enemies can’t follow you.
---
Oh dang.
---
 What joke? :Yeah so you can pull some scorchbeasts over like a bored griefer?" is what you said.
---
 Go ahead backfill, its all the rage these days.
---
I have used this same profile name since the age of dialup. It was my first profile name i ever made. Also I'm sorry to hear that. What dating site?
---
wicked! thank you! 
---
(they still need to add them to the game!)
---
I don't really get it, either. I went in there and it just started throwing all kinds of things at me, with no real direction or anything that I could see. Poorly-structured event, IMO.
---
Emperor?  Pffft.  The whole point is the SBQ is that it's the controlling queen bee of the 'hive mind'  There wouldn't be an Emperor above it.  And honestly, no more Scorchbeasts, they're annoying.  I want to see something like a Chinese invasion force beyond the little Liberators.  Or something like the Master with the Super Mutants.  Or do something with the underground Lovecraftian beast thing.
---
Seen on behemoth and havent seen the flatwoods monster yet.
---
Its a good little spot Ive had my base in a few different spots but there is by far my favourite I have a garden and everything.
---
Use a 50 cal for big enemies, gatling gun for trash mobs. Gatling gun is very efficient, 50cal is raw DPS. 
---
Heavies rule in PVE. I run a bloodied heavy at 20%, once I get adrenaline rolling I pop 68 supermutants with single body shots with my Instigating 25% fire rate gatling gun. My bloodied primed 50cal melts scorchbeasts in seconds, and I don’t have to worry about stealth or fuck with VATS. And if I switch perks around to swap in some more survivability perks I can even tank the imposter sheepsquatch somewhat (seems really random, sometimes I take a hit and it tickles, sometimes it flattens me *shrug*)
---
It’s basically the DPS output of melee, but you can do it from a distance. You just have to deal with supplying ammo, which is why having 2 guns for 2 roles makes sense. I actually carry a ton; I also do explosives so I have bloodied autogrenade, 2shot missile launcher and fatman, plus a vampire LMG, and instigating harpoon gun, plus a level 40 bloody plasma gatling I’ve been toying with. Not nearly as good as my 50cal, but it looks cool and I have a ton of plasma cores to burn, so *shrug*. 
---
And with bear arms, all that weighs about as much as 1 rifle.
---
I remember the classic d2 scam was exactly this , buddy would put up his good item in trade window click on like three or four times it would make a sound each time on one of the last times would switch out say a legendary  item with the same appearance item but it would be a blue piece of junk hoping you not notice and click your check mark you see even 20 years ago people still be scamming dbags
---
I've found a healthy middle ground that works for me and has some pretty sweet quality of life bonuses. But hey, to each their own! I honestly don't think I could stomach going through early game again with this title.
---
Happened to me today too. I had 2 possum, now 0
---
I always used the flare gun as makeshift "fireworks" after every Faschnacht parade I completed. Real fireworks would be awesome.
---
Uranium fever you grab everything the miners drop and there's rat poison and makeshift batteries. Scrap all their weapons and mine breathers and whatever else is tagged.
---
If you haven't tagged Steel and Lead for search make sure you do that. Makes it easier to see what to pick up.
---
In the Burrows there is a ton of lead. Lots of paint cans and shit.
---
Chareslton fire station has a weight room with lead barbells and shit 
---
And do it all in survival. It's almost never picked over. Well avoid Uranium Fever in survival but the rest is easier in survival.
---
I have a policy of grabbing all lead and steel I find all the time and I'm doing ok. So those times can traps and all tin cans. Every little bit helps.
---
And more fun then the factory.
---
I think you can cancel the drink action/animation by quickly opening the Pipboy as soon as you notice you are drinking instead of performing the other action you were trying?
---
Well unfortunately my bloodied sickle didn't spawn with one...
---
Still good to know I guess.
---
I seem to recall there being one at the valley floor west of Cliffwatch? I build a shack that was up the hill from it long, long, ago.
---
I agree with you on so many levels. My little brother got so frustrated with the game he has stopped playing.
---
Found him other day  buddy, "keep him on you". "Yup, no problem, he doesn't care for my Gauss"  buddy got some cool drops at least.
---
There’s a pound north of the bed and breakfast that always spawns a behemoth. Just Incase you want to check one out.
---
If you have Cannibal equipped, meat should drop from feral ghouls, etc. Similar to how it works for animals. 
---
This opens up so many more recipes if you could cook the meat.
---
1. If the vendor in the center of the whitesprings golf course...they set themselves up for disaster. 
---
2. If i just spent 30 caps to travel to said vendor because the marker showed they had plenty weapons and armor and all i find is crafted weapons, you better believe in going up to the club house and luring enemies to destroy. 
---
The point, don't put your camp at whitesprings if youre selling garbage and if you don't want enemies spawning in ever 30 minutes. Think.
---
Most enemies don't do any form of energy damage. "everything" is a stretch. "some super mutants and robots".
---
Teslas are excellent in pvp. Seen people using them effectively. you need good protection to be able to get close to players though. I don't like them myself but they're certainly viable
---
You can't cancel it with the new pipboy view 'quickboy'. I think you can cancel it if you use the classic view of actually looking at your arm.
---
Actually, the negative connotations are *part* of the word.  The literal definition of nationalism is "identification with one's own nation and support for its interests, *especially to the exclusion or detriment of the interests of other nations*."  (emphasis on the second part of the definition is mine).
---
Who wouldn't have a blast being at the blast zone?
---
I was in the middle of building a camp and the 2nd floor was still open to the the skies.  I was on the first floor fussing around with some object or another when I heard a screeching noise and a loud thud upstairs.  Looked out a window and saw a wing dangling.  I thought to my self.."No way did a scorchbeast just land upstairs"
---
Ran up stairs and found a scorchbeast corpse sprawled out on my 2nd floor.  Guess it isn't as uncommon as I thought it was at the time.
---
I don’t much care for x01 either.
---
My CAMP PC and XBOX is just up the hill from there and has artillery on it. I usually see lvl 20-40 players take the factory. If you see a nearby CAMP come take a look there's free artillery smoke grenades and the place is in range. You can pot shot the griefers and get them outside and call in the guns. Good times.
---
The stacked rock arch on the ridge west of Camp Venture. Excellent views on a clear day.
---
Oh they should make a microwave mod now I like this idea I hate having to run around and cook stuff it would be nice to just pick up water and after a few seconds it turn to boiled water.... that and I’d like to use boiled water as a substitute for purified eater in recipes.
---
We *really* need a proper perk loadout system.
---
\*INCENDIARY
---
Ah, I don't use the 'quickboy' view, ever since that bug where holotapes wouldn't play.  Even after they fixed the bug, I stayed on the classic view.
---
Clear cache, ft to Greg's mine supply and walk over, try entering without power armor are the common fixes but it doesn't seem to work for everyone.
---
I crash 100 percent of the time when in power armor but can enter either via the elevator or the event marker fine without it equipped.
---
Well, that's just, like, your opinion, man. Bathrobe can be eveyday attire my dude!
---
Yeah that one is a keeper.
---
I have had 3 random super behemoths spawn at or around whitesprings golf course since the last patch so thats kinda cool they are becoming more frequent
---
People say travel to a nearby location and walk up to arktos rather than fast travel to it. Haven’t had issues myself so I don’t know for sure.
---
I haven't gotten in on ps4 myself. Plus whenever I see the event up now no one is there.
---
Contents dead to me because solo sounds impossible and I don't want to risk the crash anyway
---
So the fridge mod is 60% I thought it was way lower then that guess I’ll get that one then.
---
Exactly. Top players know how to deal with vats and that's normally the kinda  people I'm hunting :L
---
If you have people to play with it isnt bad. All my characters except my miles are 100plus
---
its a common mistake, people think TSE is just one effect, instead of two. more commonly from newer players
---
also OP edited their post
---
I foubd that one thanks
---
Why where they downvoted there are no negatives to this
---
You have over 25k caps!!!!!!!!!!!!???????
---
I have like 15-55 caps on me at any given time. 
---
Apparently I have no idea how to play this game. I am always out of everything. It’s like I’m stuck at the poverty level. Oof.
---
Yeah it's awesome I think mine is 240 without heavy gun perks or any mods on the gun
---
I ran a 10mm VATS crit build for like 90 levels. It's great for most things below level 60 or so, but I always kept a combat shotgun on me for when things got hairy. I'm sure there are better pistols but I just like the 10mm.
---
I finally found an AAE combat shotgun, so I'm in the process of respec for that. I still keep my two-shot 10mm for scrounging in the Forest and Toxic Valley.
---
Craft it, buy it, or buy the junk to craft it. Ammo factory doesn't make enough to make it worth the time.
---
I'm honestly trying to work up the energy to grind up some levels to slap carry weight modifier cards and armor on my mules. It's just...so time consuming.
---
I killed one today and the same dead one fell from the sky in front of me at 3 different locations,pants had to be removed and cleaned.
---
Good luck with that.
---
I’m on Xbox One
---
Well, I'll retract the "asshole" from my statement, then.
---
Seems difficult. 9 into pistols and still ‘need’ gun fu, adrenaline, stealth, etc. To me there are too many great perks in agility tgat by adding pistols it will just slow you down. If pistol were a perception perk then yeah
---
What platform? I have a winter man on xbox. Just make offer or trade.
---
You might want to try taking Hemlock Holes Maintenance and Grafton Steel.  Together, you can have enough acid and steel to keep you running for a while.  Plus, you get all those bonus plans and XP for having to defend them.  You'll get bonus gunpowder from Grafton because there's always Super Mutants there.
---
If it's the one I'm thinking of, you can't build in it.  I came across that one over the (long) weekend.
---
The only TS i have that I really like is a bolt action pipe rifle that still has accuracy over 100. My TS gauss os OK I guess. I still use a TS +50% limb damage handmade but am looking for something better because accuracy sucks.
---
Yeah, but then you wouldn't have that sweet dopamine hit when a three star item actually drops. Yesterday I found myself yelling at a three star ghoul that he better drop a three star item. Sure enough, god roll baseball bat: bloodied, +40% power attack damage, +1 strength.
---
I'm a fucking junkie and Todd is my pusher.
---
What about unlocking mods for weapons and armor? What did you do there?
---
We definitely need a proper greenhouse plan, along with planters, and a water pool for the cranberries and other berries that float on water.
---
Understood  ツ
---
Super mutants should have double the carry weight.
---
Wholesome content. 11/10.
---
It can be a pain to start over I know that
---
Also, stick a star on the list if they have legendaries.  
---
As with the OP, "holy shit, 18 weapons for sale", fast travel across the map to find a selection of regular assault rifles, rocket launchers and 10mm auto pistols.  
---
Awesome.
---
I don't even pick up gunpowder even more, I have way too much already. 
---
But thanks for the advice. Best community
---
Just tried it twice on Xbox one and it crashed both times.
---
Lucky hole mine in excavator armor is the way to go. Acid will be what you need next to smelt all the lead in lucky hole mine. I have 60+ bulk lead and I've only been there once weeks ago. Pick up steel when you need it and basically just craft whenever you run out.
---
As a sneaky sniper that can't contribute much to the big events, I'd sure like to see some buffs to other builds!
---
Xbox. Whats your gamertag i will message you.
---
&gt; uranus fever
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I would have to agree with this I one shotted 95 dc with a 3.5 attack with a instigating combat knife pve this build rocks pvp not so much
---
I'm getting a Witcher 3-Geralt/Ciri vibe, was that intentional? It looks awesome.
---
Two months and this hasn’t been made into another post? Does nobody else have this issue?
---
I don't get how they would lose money by making impossible challenges.  It does suck when challenges seem impossible but they dony really gain money when peeps complete challenges either, they are there for peeps to earn atoms and not spend extra cash.
---
Never got a single prime plan from him, such luck.
---
Running out of 556 ammo for my handmade used to be a serious problem until lucky hole mine
---
Gt Grim Project
---
Oof.....no dude. The joke was reworking my camp just for your demanding sounding post. 😂😂😂😂
---
Did Arko last night with about 5 people.. got a 1* wood chest piece......
---
I’ve never seen a behemoth... I’m lvl 85 help
---
I messaged you
---
dont want to make you mad guys but in germany i saw the game at 2.99€ today
---
Agree would be nice to choose which mutation to remove if not required
---
I want to be a super mutant trader like ghram... we could be distant cousins. Ill promise to use my mic to talk about meat as well
---
Solved! Thanks guys
---
Yeah last patch nixed the campfire medals.
---
I had the same thing happen to me in Clarksburg. 5 of them rolled through town when I was very low level, of course one was legendary.
---
Was stuck in a building pretty much.
---
Thank you for this. I did the cave without finding any and logged out. After reading this I logged back in and got one right away outside that house.
---
And sitting down. And sleeping. Perhaps even terminals, locks and workbenches?
---
Sounds like you don't run gunsmith
---
This is pre fix durability if you only get 3 cores out of it.
---
I Run a TSE Gat Plas and I can push 7-8 cores through (overcharged) before I get in danger of needing to repair.
---
You're welcome :)
---
I sent you a message
---
Second this, my last trip I walked out with 328 lead ore. Once you get used to all the spots and what to look for and are thorough it is worth it.
---
Also a chem bench at the end to smelt the ore on site if you choose.
---
did you check it on the pip boy or on the vending machines? check both
---
I spent ages buggering around with my mods trying to work out what had broken the scrip vendor machines until I just decided not to worry and just play for a bit and the next time I went passed a train station the machine had spawned.
---
Any that you find will likely have been duped/obtained through the dev room, so enjoy that.  During Faschnacht, everybody was asking if these masks dropped and the resounding answer was "no" to the point that people were scouring the quest reward tables.  I think one person posted that they got the mask from the event, but really; one person in the whole fo76 reddit community?  No RNG quest reward is that rare.  People personally ran that quest dozens of times.  And got nothing outside of the common drops and the rare beret.
---
Pistols can work. I was successful in PVP with a dinky 10mm. The key is to go for vats, stealth, and critical hits. Use covert operative and mister sandman with a silencer for 3.5x sneak attacks at night and concentrated fire for 2x headshot damage. The 10mm automatic pistol costs about 11 AP per shot. At 15 agility you get about 19 shots off. Throw on a red dot sight and quick magazine and you may get a few more shots in.
---
I got by with an anti armor legendary 10mm for a long time. The only reason I switched was because the game decided to give me a god roll rifle that only costs me 7 AP per shot.
---
I want a [Jersey Devil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey_Devil)
---
In the years post war it could have migrated to the apocolyptic amusement park that is W. Va.
---
Frame rate sucks when doing the Arktos Pharma event.
---
I'll give that a try, thanks.
---
Pip boy- will check the machines...
---
only seen 100, have had all kinds of levels
---
I mean, you can still spam crits, with proper character building, you can crit every other shot
---
Tried all of them..

I can’t think of any more fallout dating site puns off hand, but I’ll get back to you if I do.
---
Just buff the C.A.M.P budget like at the start of Wild Appalachia. I wanna make a small town damnit! 😂
---
I want to be whatever the fuck Frank Horrigan was. I don't think you could balance that, but god it'd be sweet.
---
I agree.
---
Occasionally I have a wire that glitches out and I have to scrap it and reconnect.
---
I'm sitting at 22k caps I'll be fine. I'm not making a living on vendors.
---
Caps are too easy to get and respecing should be difficult and time consuming. That's how games of this nature work
---
Been using the same lvl 50 1* item for the last 90 lvls. Best 2k caps I ever spent.
---
Maybe the predator numbers increase with more players then?
---
Both were nerfed down from like 95% bonus to 60% max bonus.
---
I think lowering the budget that they use is unrealistic - in general the cost of things are based on the pain they'll cause to streaming and frame-rate. But I think the idea of a blackboard you can write on is a winner.
---
i could have sworn the honey beast is a giant bee.. but i do agree. give us bigger baddies.. maybe a Jelly Beast, a Queen Honey Beast. 
---
&gt;!also i still want Cyborg Death Claw!&lt;
---
No it didn't. Still just rare drops. Same with Stings and Things.
---
Nothing for armor, other than scrapping whatever armor I came across, and for weapons, I did it in what I assume is the normal way—scrapped any and all I could find, purchased plans and crafted a bit to scrap when the price of the plans and materials could reasonably fit my budget. Getting your hands on something with a silencer, even if you can’t mod a silencer on yourself yet, is a good idea as early as possible to stay in stealth for as long as reasonably possible per encounter
---
If you have a lot of useless legendary, you can turn them in at train station and get scrips, which are currency that this new legendary vendor will only take and you can trade you scrips in for new random legendary up to 3 stars
---
Here you go.  This will let you play around with your weapon and perks:  [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html)
---
Phew! Just a Pip boy problem then... they’re still showing on the machines. Thanks!
---
Not the intention, but Ciri is gorgeous so I'll take it.
---
ive seen a few.
---
personally ive had a BE 10mm and a FE 10mm which is still have and willing to sell/trade on ps4 :).
---
Whats wrong with duped items?
---
Pls
---
Firstly, I will catch a lot of shit because I play PA...I know, what a puss. Secondly, yeah, i play melee...unsophisticated and lazy..BUT I will say that a solid melee build with a vampire sledgehammer makes for good solo play...
---
Modus didn’t kill the Enclave they are the Enclave, that being said I like where you’re going could have been cool.
---
Edit: also modus I don’t think is ai it’s the combined minds of the greatest thinkers they could gather before the bombs drop. I imagine in modus they sort of have there own voices like a whole bunch of robo brains hooked up.
---
use bobby pins as currency, they weight nothing and can be sold for 1 cap to the bot vendors
---
I dont care either way really. Like new characters but it can be a pain starting fresh. Im fine with a cap fee for respec, but I dont think you should be able to completely change your character everyday. Maybe allow one respec a week.....
---
All good. I have a Big Iron single action build. Thats a load of fun. 
---
I was ideally thinking of devoting perks to boost the broadsider in all terms. 
---
Bear arms was there if I decide to use other heavies, 
---
Strong back was to be able to carry a few more cannonballs even with bandolier they still weigh a bit. 
---
I can grab fireproof. Ironclad trust sounded good for extra def. 
---
I already have starched genes in the build. Tormentor was something for the rifle. But I can find better.
---
Try arktos, whitsprings and cryptid event
---
these are my numbers exactly
---
3 to 0
---
I've bought &amp; resold 3 explosive western revolvers in the last few days, they are out there.
---
That’s what I was thinking cause I used to get some pretty low frames in Boston while I was playing 4. Thanks!
---
Black Rider was pretty nice, too. IMO, of course.
---
Once you've built a good set of perks and mutations around a bloodied fire rate gatling gun, you'll never go back!
---
New GT idea: NeonGenitals
---
BSG knows this is a big issue as this is the #1 complaint since player vending started.  I'm surprised they haven't said they are looking into this and stop posting about it.  Maybe a sticky to stop the constant spawn clipping posts?  I'm expecting a fix in tonight's patch at least to temporarily fix spawn points well outside built structures. Travel mats are the way to go.
---
Every behemoth I’ve seen has been at white springs, on the nothern edge of the green/woods or fighting the gate guards behind the big house and close to the disposal site in the woods
---
They already tried to not scrap bulk items, but then ppl were complaining that they need to take their crafting junk or for repairs from stash, because they had all bulked and it prevented them using it, without scraping it in pieces again. So choose your best choice for the system lol
---
Lmao
---
Yea im like at 37k caps but the issue is no one actually wants caps the inflation is so bad. They really serve no purpose other than fast travel and bot vending. Though players will sell less that bot vendors if its option. Only time I see people using caos is stuff under 8-10k in value.
---
I hadn't seen it.
---
I like most of the small unmarked lakes/ponds you find in various places. I had my camp in one for awhile and moved to a second one some time back (both in the Forest region). I found another one in the Savage Divide that I've been debating on moving to for a little bit now, but I do like that my current spot is kind of tucked away.
---
Cool they added that outfit with the tire "armor"
---
Come and get it big fella “scoffs in Brotherhood”
---
In a classless rpg allowing complete respecs at the drop of a hat further washes out the concept of specs.  Not really sure this wouldnt do more damage than good.  I do get what you are saying though about wanting to try another spec and not having the time to level another character.
---
Best solution would be test servers that allow you to just muck about with stats, perks, and mutations as well as have access to end game gear you can equip and test for that spec but cant take back to the real game.
---
It might be worth trying.  I've gotten two weapons worth keeping, but of course most of the drops were shit.  But I've had way more drops because I am paying half the price of a 3- star item.  One person here said he needed a 3 star because of VATS.  I'm not sure what he meant, but finding one  specific 3-star combination just sounds almost impossible.
---
You can still destroy camps by kiting enemies that spawn from fast travel for one. Second of all, maybe people don't want you in their space regardless of you wanting to see it. Just because you want to do it doesn't override people not wanting to participate in what you want to do ;)
---
You're free to unlock the door and eat a bounty. That's your consequence for curiosity.
---
And really what level are you? What kind of build do you have? Do you actually do events or mess around?
---
An "observatory" (weather control machine) thats been in the game since launch. 
---
Its the metal ball looking thing on the map in the savage divide that no one goes to, because there are no quests or events there.
---
I don't blame you though, for many its like "oh when did they add that" and it turns out its a thing thats been in the game since the start. Downside of constant updates.
---
Weird mine works just fine being bulked. But also didn't know that was an issue before. guess I'll dig a little deeper.
---
They’re no worse than the high level players that refuse to follow the objectives. At least low levels have an excuse for being useless. 
---
The number of players doesn’t seem to affect anything, so if low levels want to hang around, who cares? Even better if they actually fill the troughs.
---
So... players trade in something other than caps at their personal shops? They do this often?
---
Just found a Mutants Explosive faster while aiming pipe revolver at a vendor for like 600 caps. Modded it to a revolver rifle and used rifleman and pistol perks. Does just shy of 300 per shot.
---
he was a member of the secret service so he had training then fev turned him into an ultra tall and jacked super mutant so the enclave said fuck it and perma bonded him to a custom suit of X-01 that pumped him with drugs to keep him alive and full of strong af
---
It was on for 2days only about 4months ago. Now it is the way it works best.
---
I miss living up there. But too many people found the spot
---
I'm begining to think the legendary vendor is shady.  I get creatively designed legendaries to effectively make any weapon obtained the WORST possible build for that weapon or KILLER effects on a completely garbage weapon.  I've seen eerily similar weapons in player vending machines I was just handed by the shifty legendary vendor.  What are the odds? Anybody data mined how the legendary vendor creates her masterpieces of dissapointment?
---
Well on discord and stuff you see a lot of wtt only but you can find in game people who dont use reddit or discord to trade
---
Deluxe versions?
---
It works, it just breaks the game flow because you have to scroll all the way to the bottom.
---
You look like Daenaerys and her dragon
---
Also fast travel should cost hunger and thirst not caps.
---
He was made of the milk of human kindness
---
Also sell these IRL please
---
But then you have people who have the caps to burn who warp to camps see a god legendary for only like 5k buy it and flip it
---
Man this looks like fun, way more fun than when I run into 3 scorchbeasts.
---
Hemlock Holes has 3 acid nodes.
---
The reason you have to scrap bottles and baseballs separately is because they prevent auto scrapping of items that youve learned a recipe for. So I’m guessing you learned the recipe for baseball grenades and Molotov cocktails.
---
There are 2 drills in the basement of garahan headquarters and also another at one of the gaps at the fence near whitesprings clubhouse.
---
12%. Up to you if you notice that. 
---
20% (explosive legendary) x 1.6 = 32%. Difference is 12%.
---
Yeah. I'd rather not sit there as griefer bait, thanks.
---
You’re AMAZING
---
Hmm thats a bit odd. Radiation doesn't damage the camp.
---
Lvl 54. I don’t really do events cuz I rarely find others doing them. Build? No build just random crap I’ve found or crafted. My cards are a mess. I honestly don’t understand most of the game. 
---
So I just mess around. But I’m starting to feel like I’m spinning my wheels. I enjoy the survive and scavenge aspect but I’m getting burnt fast. After only a week of coming back to 76.
---
Not exactly. Movement speed is capped at +20% (maybe 25, but I can’t tell the difference between 20% and 25%. )
---
So no move speed bonuses stack with any other move speed bonuses.
---
There is an RNG god !!! I'm a level 301 900+ Hours (been playing since beta). Never received anything worth a damn. Met an new team last night and we decided to do the SBQ. Completed the event and low and behold a Max Level 3\* Anti-Armor Explosive w/ 25% vats Handmade, from the queen no less. I'm thinking about going to Vegas today....
---
Yeah, did that to no luck though
---
But reward is capped at 50 caps now
---
" Bloodied gatling plasma" melts those annoying things mid air.
---
Perfect description of me on the first day LOL...
---
But after 5 runs got the hang of it and now I solo the event in under 10 mins, it's pretty straight forward not complicated but I hate on leechers that join and don't help with objective and do like no damage to alpha while I'm killing the damn thing in less than 1 min...
---
sounds weird but I have a fun time leveling alts making a different build on third one at this point. You forget how hard the first 25 lvls are when  your weak like a baby.
---
so now you try to find hella op low lvl weapons(lvl 10 instigating explosive rifle)  to make the beginning grind more  fun that provided me with a weekend worth of extra entertainment
---
NOW it got weird.
---
The issue you're missing is synergy between effects and weapon types.   
---
A Bloodied/SS melee weapon is going to be worth a lot more than 10 random bloodied plus 10 random swing speed. Multiple VATS effects on the item make each VATS effect exponentially more valuable, but on a troubleshooter, less so. Instigating is great on a Super Sledge or Black Powder, less so on a Mr. Handy Buzz Blade or minigun.
---
Lucky!!! That sounds so epic!
---
You declined to buy any atoms because you were unable to complete a challenge for an extra 10cents worth of atoms? I call bullshit.
---
That’s why you turn on passive mode until you decide you want to pvp
---
I've been having many issues this patch week with server instability and team and friend list issues very often. I can't get back into the same world after leaving.
---
Maybe, but it's absolutely got to involve nuclear winter, since its a weather control machine.
---
You're thinking of the National Isolated Radio Array probably. There are a few holotapes found in that triangle of military installations (one of them being the big satellite dish) that insinuate the government was talking to Aliens before the war. NIRA, Sugar Grove, and I can't remember the third were all part of it. My bet is that all comes out after wastelanders, probably 2020. 
---
I'm betting it will go: Atlas weather control machine for "Nuclear winter", Vaults full of NPC's/ Fucked up experiments opening for "Wastelanders", and then the unannounced (but heavily hinted at) "Alien Stuff(TM)" in early 2020.
---
It was "SUPPOSED" to be on, like most things in this game it just works
---
I haven't been able to find it in the Atom Shop. =(
---
So then he’s even more like GLaDOS because she’s Carolin’s brain, Cave Johnson’s assistant, uploaded into a robot body. Also I might have looked over the part where the Enclave fell apart.
---
And yet it's still the most popular build.  The nerf was minor.
---
Ok. I did trade a couple for scrip but wasn’t sure what scrip was... then I pieced together there is a “Xur from Destiny” like vendor somewhere that sells things for scrip only. Thanks reddit 😃
---
So I’ll investigate that later.
---
That's what the internet is for, happy to be of service.
---
It would also be cool if there was a Mister Gutsy yelling about he’s going to burn houses down with lemons.
---
Player vending is a really good way to get some decent gear quickly. 
---
You can make 1,400 caps from vendors. Try to do that every day, and use those caps to buy things from player shops. 
---
My favorite way to make caps is to run through Harper's Ferry and West Tek, and then selling the weapons and armor to the vendor at Harper's Ferry. It generally only takes a few runs to get your daily caps that way. 
---
If you're looking to earn gear, a lot of events have Legendary enemies, and are a good way to get gear over time. 
---
Try to go to every Sorchbeast Queen fight you see. Great drops from those.
---
I mean, you can change the ammo type... to ultracite .308. It crafts in 4x the quantity from what I’ve heard, but y’know, need flux.
---
Honestly, some of the builds are crippled by BUGS.  Stealth is semi-working and Adrenal Reaction is still not working as intended.  If they could get all that working I think you'd find other builds more competitive.  I agree nerfing everything is bad game balancing - they need to buff stuff so it will be attractive to more players.  I refuse to build glass cannon builds - I'll concentrate on 2 weapon types and deal with the less than OP damage for more flexability in play style.
---
Super Mutant - You become incredibly strong and receive massive boosts to your carry weight and durability. However, you take a massive hit to your intelligence and can only use certain weapon types.
---
Ghoul - You gain higher endurance and resistance to radiation damage, but chems have lesser effects and you become weaker to other damage types.
---
I love this idea. I’d eat all sorts of random stuff!
---
My suggestion wouldn't change much.  It would just make the build work the same in the day as it does at night without making bloodied + stealth better than it already is.
---
Also enemies that take a ton of hits to kill tend to mysteriously drop you out of stealth to where you don't get your multipliers even when still in \[Caution\].  Events like encrypted, SBQ, project paradise etc it's hard to actually land sneak attacks vs the boss with any consistency but Bloodied still deals most or all of it's damage potential in these cases.  
---
So on the whole my suggestion would just make stealth a bit more consistent and reliable.  Mister Sandman worked as I describe in fo4...
---
I had the neons up for my new place, The Wendigo-go, but I had to take them down to make budget room for other things :(
---
Any route suggestions? I've never seen that many except in rare circumstances.
---
I mean it would be nice to just spam loot meat off them rather than going through an entire animation.
---
Plans. Plans of all kinds.
---
3\* Vanguards BOS Armor.
---
Thats all I look for.
---
Free respeccing takes away the entire point to play after level 50 if you can just bounce your perks around with ease. 
---
I’ll admit my first character isn’t perfectly spec’d but I’m okay with that. I still love the 100+ levels I got with her and my new character I’ve done the research on and know exactly when to spec into the perks I want for the build I want.
---
Like I said, you need to let them run to you by using the environment and then ambush them. Running and gunning isn’t the only way to play ;) you can’t be seen while sneaking and stealth boys are also a thing but I don’t use them as they as a bit rare. Edit: be careful for people running at you with a Tesla rifle though. It’s my counter. Edit:2: basically lure them to ambush and one-two shot them. Serendipity works wonders for up close and personal
---
They want you to spend them. Caps has hardly any value in the game except for fast travel and the occasional junk purchase from the vendors for repairing or crafting. They added the 10% tax on player vendors because there's nothing else to spend it on lol.
---
Exactly! Lol there's also a couple of new events like encryptid, project paradise and such that spawn on 3 stars legendary boss, but other than that you just gotta go grind at location with mobs of enemies and hope they spawn in some 3 stars and then also hope again that they may drop some worthwhile lol at least that's how I been doing it, it's all RNG
---
As a side note, the game needs more love for the Wendigo.  Would kill to get my hands on some wendigo statues to complement my mounted wendigo.
---
Ok sweet. Thanks so much. 
---
Daily cap limit? So what you can earn is capped?
---
Time for a stash size increase post then
---
Wait, lemme see if I can get the trollish "JustARaiderBro" comment down...
---
"It's in the game so it's ok. The wasteland is all soft and fuzzy, bro".
---
Asshats. One and all.
---
Cool, that's drinking night so we get a bit ridiculous lol
---
This is exactly what just started happening to me today, word for word. On PC. Was not fast traveling anywhere near Harper's or Watoga tho. I was fast traveling to vendor CAMPs in The Forest, se of the Lighthouse.
---
Someone the other day posted in here about a Behemoth King. You nuke West Tek and it spawns a Behemoth King with about as much health as the SBQ. That’d be cool.
---
That is correct. Which I can understand. They finally put an question for scrapping or selling favorite items. I think somewhat the same thing for things created by the Player would be nice. Or bare minimum SOME of the plastic in return for the scrap would be awesome.
---
True. It really isn't worth holding another. I have a bloodied .50 cal. So that's good enough until I get a B25 or BE
---
I have seen today just on the map, when the event was on. 8 ppl of lvls 6-12max. May have been 2 teams trying hard, but I would love to have a look inside at what they were up to. Didn’t have time unfortunately.
---
Best Atomic Shop outfit by a country mile. It, along with hotter rod and responder shotty skin, make a fantastic selection this week.
---
Well really it sucks but unless the event is new or offers something great not many people are gonna show. Also you gotta sell off as much as you can to vendors and wait for the cycle. Its also good to figure out a build to really figure out what you need.
---
Do people just let out their anger on this sub?
---
No.  Be more careful of your choices.
---
That said, I still want to know what the upcoming "legendary character" option is going to be.
---
Power armor DOES have added % damage reduction. Around 7% per piece. It’s just not displayed (like it’s hidden rad % reduction, about 12% per piece; like hazmat suit’s hidden 99% reduction).
---
Full suit of PA has ~42% damage reduction and ~72% rad reduction on top of their flat values.
---
hmu on discord  マックス#9714 really late but ive been looking for travelers leather coat for a week
---
Its a proper pain in the ass, whole day of shit wasted man
---
Here's my "typical day in the wasteland" solo loadout that I have equipped when I just wandering around farming or whatever. It's nowhere near min/maxed, but it's enough to one shot anything in the game smaller than a hermit crab. Sub-bosses like crabs, Mirelurk Queens, etc go down in 2-3 swings. The shotgun perks are mainly for crippling scorch bitches and for taking out the ceiling turrets in the silos.

---
I'd love to move a couple points out of charisma, but I spend a lot of time playing with a team in and need 9 points to share either Inspiration or Rad Sponge depending on the situation, and I have the perks that heal other people so I need traveling pharmacy to mitigate the weight of all the excess chems I'm lugging around. 
---
My Bloodied Baseball bat does somewhere in the range of 1,000-1,200 when I in the sweet spot at 19%hp. Like I said, it's not as OP as some builds, but it's more than enough to make short work of most enemies as well as making a noticiable contribution to SBQ battles. Also, I like having some weapon variety and not being quite as squishy as a fully dedicated bloodied build. Occasionally I'll swap out glow sight, put on level 3 tank killer, and play with my bloodied lever action for a change of pace. It does somewhere around 350/shot, which is enough for me considering I have almost no perks invested in rifles.
---
76 lore also makes things a little tricky, like the enclave main base is actually an oil rig where in theory there should be people but modus makes no mention of knowing about the so 🤷‍♂️
---
I just did, you should try it its very calming actually, its like screaming fuck at the top of your lungs but virtually because neighbours
---
Personal preference.
---
My question is, I know the weight carry mod doesn't work while in PA.  Does the cooling option work while in PA?
---
The Whitesprings robots ruined my first epic Scorchbeast fight with my wife. It was the first time we decided to make a stand and try to take one down, but halfway through the fight all the robots turned on us and we had to run/respawn. It’s really broke the groove we had going and the game was always a little less fun for us.
---
Loot buildings...
---
I am aware of this, this is why I am creating a survey on the most basic aspects, after this one if in any case, the survey is successful I will be taking the structural data to create the synergy between weapons and effects survey.
---
I have died more than I can count because of accidentally sitting down or drinking or going to sleep on whitespring sleeping bags, and helplessly watching how steroid powered army of ghouls are molesting my character when he's trying to take a quick nap, or mole rat majestically bites my character's testicles off while he's trying to fit his ass into that uncomfortably small boot in local diner, and during all that I'm screaming Todd's name and having a boxing tournament with my keyboard.
---
Yeah I get that, sometimes you can't spend them fast enough before a player pushes you over the limit.
---
Also if you were persay a shotgun character why buy shells at 1 cap a piece when you can take over the munitions factory for 33 have it make you ammo, lead and junk all at once so you can drastically increase your ammo gain
---
oh yeah sory im an idiot
---
I think it would be cool to get this as a plan along with the CAMP side quest in the beginning.
---
That or Hell, sell it in the atomic shop.
---
 Steel is widely available. A vast majority of junk will give you some steel and a one point investment in scrapper will give you a huge return on steel for scrapped weapons. I farm to make bullets most nights i’m online and between holding the extractors at Grafton Steel, running lode baring, breach and clear and Uranium Fever you can have quite a lot of steel scrap in a single session. 
---
 Lead is the scarcer commodity but ammo crafted at the tinker’s bench usually requires around half the amount of lead that it would steel so you don’t need to have quite so much stockpiled at any time. 
---
There are a number of junk items that will give you lead at a decent amount including tin cans but also Rat Poison which actually gives you 5 lead per unit. Smelting lead (especially with super duper on) will really help with establishing a steady supply.
---
Right :)  on my first play thru had a lvl 25 instigating axe I have used that same axe on 3 alts at this point you gotta love the right 1 star weapons.
---
Really?
---
take everything that isn't nailed down and scrap it
---
I solved this problem by consistently spending caps.  Only happen once, now I manage my cap limit.  Plenty to buy from robot vendors and the forums.  All my characters have 11,000 or less caps right now.  It really isn't a problem for me anymore.
---
Movement speed is capped at either +20 or 25% (pretty sure it’s 20 but some things display 25 baseline, like emergency protocols; i haven’t noticed an actual speed difference though) 
---
Shrouded wood does give impressive stealth bonuses, but I’m not sure it surpasses 5piece chameleon on ultralight.
---
However, 5piece weightless shrouded wood with the chameleon mutation should technically be the absolute maximum stealth bonus (add The Fixer to top it off)
---
Update.  I must have sold the minigun but still have a vampire's ultracite gatling laser. +10 damage while aiming and 1 agility
---
Are you on xbox? I sold someone a junkie's explosive single action for 600 yesterday.
---
Healing factor doesn't work really as well, I never see my health naturally going up.
---
I wasn’t aware that applied to adventure mode, I figured it was only survival.  Would make sense thou to apply it across both modes.  Thank you
---
Yeah sometimes. They want you to dump them into those awesome sweet and cool plans they made available lol
---
If the only reason you play is to get a perfect character,maybe you should move on. I can think of many reasons to play after 50 even with respec. Sorry, that's not a very good arguement.
---
Get plans for a fusion generator...? Maybe it's just me but I think you'll be searching forever to find a plasma generator.
---
Bethesda has problems with backpacks I hear.
---
Xbox GamerTag: xXUltraSuperMegaEdgelord6969Xx
---
Note: This entire post is satire.
---
Yup. Gatling and Gatling plasma for the harder enemies. Both work well
---
Am I the only one that thinks Bethesda would make bank if they cut prices to 1/4th
---
TSE Gatling gun.
---
Clear that problem RIGHT up.
---
I seem to get them frequently. Enough so that I started a new Mistress of Mysteries type build so I could play with them. She started with a level 5 bloodied 10mm (risky play style at that level), and at the moment (level 25ish) she carries an instigating black powder pistol for the first shot on big enemies, and a furious explosive pipe rifle for clean up.
---
Yesterday mama murmur gave me a 2 star instigating pipe pistol that went straight into the chipper, and a 2 star junkie's explosive single action that I sold for 600 caps.
---
Gotcha.
---
They're turds. I've had them blow up my fusion genny. In its shed. Locked. 
---
Or the brave rad rat that by passed all my defenses and made it to my generator? yeah no. 
---
Its obvious what they're going for, but its...got an incredibly forced feel to it.
---
I always grab Can Chimes. You get 9 tin cans which have 2 Steel and 1 Lead each.
---
He says he lost contact with the Poseidon Rig and Raven Rock if you talk to his terminals in the communications center (between the military wing and the production center, the room with stairs and a giant map and readout of stats from the Kovac-Muldoon).
---
Oh thats awesome, where did you find that?
---
I would agree with that. I understand about people not wanting to allow respecting, but really? One stat at a time per level, and then I still dont get a card if I respec a point? Once a week seems fair.
---
Imo explosive heavy weapons arent as good as non explosive heavys since they nerfed the explosive cards dmg- &amp; heavy gunner only affects non explosive heavys. Just some food for thought, but I'd steer away from those examples and try to lean towards bloodied/furious options. Theres alot to consider though lol
---
Amazon sells the physical box at a discount, and occasionally the humble bundle store and Green Man Gaming sell keys at a lesser discount too.
---
My argument is great just not the one you want to hear.
---
I haven't heard any news, but a BOS flag pole would be cool. All the tents are the same, BOS have the same ones as the responders, so I don't know about that.
---
Cheers man I’ll have to go into the bunker and have a look at the terminals other then the quest line haven’t really done much digging around down there.
---
He does mention it, but not during the quests for the Enclave. If you activate him enough times while in the communications room he’ll say that they lost connection with their other bases. He mentions Raven Rock, he might have mentioned California but I don’t know. Definitely check for yourself.
---
This one is geared towards bloodied weapons, but it's a damn solid build that should work just fine for your guns. I'd probably swap ghoulish for fireproof to avoid blowing yourself up, but that's about the only change I can see.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f343cb8&amp;d=sb2s22sq2s32sr2pe2ei2cu1cr0ic4ii0ip2ir2s72a42a04ls2lt2l71eu0&amp;w=sa2s01p10pa0p80p90e31c52i30ia0i50iq2ie2in1ih2id2s12if2i71im1i61ij2a72ag2a12lm2at1&amp;n=Bloodied%20Heavy%20Weapons&amp;m=3cfe28
---
Yea really?
---
There are 2 different cap caps. 
---
Each character can have a maximum of 25,000 caps.
---
Each character can earn 1,400 caps from robot vendors. Caps earned through quests, events, around the world, on monsters, and from your camp shop do not count towards that daily limit. 
---
It sounds a bit more limiting than it ends up being for most players, but there has been a lot of feedback around these limits, and I could see them changing at some point. 
---
Once you get into a good flow, you can count on having 1,400 caps worth of expendable income every day. Make good use of those caps, or save up for something super good.
---
Kill the reds that inhabit Bethesda, kill them all!
---
The sure would... also it would have people want to spend their atom alittle more... cuz if you know you need atleast 1000 atoms to get any armor you wont spend them on things that are 500 to 700 cuz then you'll be broke
---
&gt;shut down the vendor
---
They gave us a built in mechanism to control this. You only show up on the map if the machines are powered. Hook them up to a switch and turn them off when you don't want people buying shit.
---
There's still more content n DLC on the way... Trust me, it's best to have a nice amount of caps saved up. 
---
I also use my excess caps on plans.. And mainly ammo.
---
Does it outclass a comparable setup with full Shadowed Leather?
---
Yes! If you get to the general rank, (possibly before, not sure) tons of the terminals (not the MODUS ones, the type you interact with to read stuff on) have security audio recordings that, if you can piece them all together and infer a bit, explain the Enclave, the insane Secretary of Agriculture, and how he’s directly responsible for pretty much everything wrong with Appalachia, from Liberators to Super Mutants to Scorchbeasts!

Reported

I rename kine with a zz in front of the name so it drops to the very bottom of the list.
---
Charleston landfill has 3 junk piles along with steel/aluminum/coper/ and water purifier!
---
Love holding that place and most ppl go for the power plant cause it uas lead and fusion cores. 
---
Almost never get bothered at the landfill.
---
This was at your CAMP, not a workshop?  Did you accidentally click on Survivor mode when you started playing?
---
When I did queen of the hunt I killed a wendigo and it counted lol. But that was like, right at launch.
---
It works fine now, that's the point. At one time, they made it so that bulk wouldn't auto scrap, but the only way to make it work involved you having to go back and manually scrap the bulk stacks if you wanted to craft. It annoyed the fuck out of people, hundreds of threads were created, and they changed it back.
---
I did a little searching and Modus did kill the other Enclave members but only after they tried to destroy him. Part of Modus became corrupt and he filled the bunker with deadly gas.
---
Ugh that's a tough one... probably best bet is to hit up lucky hole mine in excavator armor and grab up lead.
---
Discord/reddit markets. But looting should be your first choice
---
Fair opinion but the quad explosive harpoon is one of, if not the most desirable gun in the game right now. I would argue there is no other version of it that comes close but you're definitely right about the 50 cal. Also, its a common misconception that those cards dont work on heavy weapons with the explosive prefix but they do. By explosive they mean fatmans, rockets, etc.
---
I feel you. Even better when it's lvl10 one star cloaking wooden leg piece. I dropped that one for the wolves while watching other players emoting thumbs ups over lvl100 sheepsquats corpse, seemingly getting actually good stuff. It hurts, Bethesda. It hurts!
---
&gt;... imagine harpers ferry being patroled by 3 or 4 behemoths.  
---
That would be awesome, turn it from a quick run around to earn some caps and grab some steel to "oh shit oh shit oh shit" territory.
---
Most excellent looks like I got some exploring todo
---
Nope, just normal adventure.
---
I was shooting the enemies his team was spawning in by travelling there and diving infront of me while shooting so it come up as a attack
---
This would be the best unforseen No Man's Sky crossover ever.
---
Undo the whitespring ghoul changes so people can level at a decent pace again.
---
Thanks for the tip! I'll keep a lookout for those explosive variants.. how about energy weapon though? I.e. explosive gatlings/nrgrifles? Same deal?
---
I don't believe it's currently repeatable/daily like it should be. Definitely bugged.
---
I really wouldn't recommend building a camp near a fissure!
---
Just give it a minute, that happens
---
What if it's protective brotherhood officers uniform? It's both armor, and apparel.
---
That's awesome.
---
How about scrolling Neon signs ... like stock market tickers? That would be kinda cool.

Should only effect the strobe as it is the only light designed to flash.

One of the raider bosses turned into a scorched, and he is seen wearing raider armor. Check right here: [https://www.google.com/search?q=fallout+76+david+thorpe&amp;safe=strict&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiklZWZmb\_iAhUGd98KHXKoBtcQ\_AUIDygC&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=788#imgrc=bzvvLVuQuFdi0M:](https://www.google.com/search?q=fallout+76+david+thorpe&amp;safe=strict&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiklZWZmb_iAhUGd98KHXKoBtcQ_AUIDygC&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=788#imgrc=bzvvLVuQuFdi0M:)
---
Is it the one out by Pylon V-13?
---
I, uh, don't think you'd want to put a base there.
---
I don't doubt it.  But have you been able to get it to trigger since that first time?  How often have you seen that event running?  
---
The problem has been that the event doesn't trigger properly.  Unlike other events where you can server hop until you find a server where it is active, people have been noting for months that "Queen of the Hunt" doesn't trigger.  (In fact, a lot of the Mire events don't seem to trigger as they should.)
---
15 per hour? That's 1 ever 4 minutes. I'm calling shenanigans.
---
You can still buy from a vendor when the power is off. You can't always be there when players are buying from you. For instance, I sold 20k caps worth of merch while in the middle of a SBQ fight. 10k of that went straight to the void.
---
Amen to that
---
PC, and it definitely wasn't a junkie's, I would have left that for someone who might want to try out a junkie's build (I tend to buy things I might use, I don't really have a reason to flip cheap weapons).
---
On the other hand, I have *never* seen a decent 50 cal or a good instigating sniper or lever action (I've been using the same 1* instigating hunting rifle for over 100 levels now).
---
Yea man they need to offer skins for all weapons not just a select few
---
Yes that's so cool!!
---
I tried it yesterday but it bugged out on me. Couldn't finish it
---
Just pick up everything you see, if you get over encumbered too much the perk pack rat should help
---
Most def, I been rocking the Vault Tec Bomber Jacket for a while but it's nice to get something a little more tactical
---
Hopefully they continue with faction themed stuff, this is definitely a good start
---
It is a problem, you are forced to spend caps on things you may not actually want.
---
I’ve been trying every few days to do them... I just want my possum badge gosh dang it!!!!!
---
What? I've been running mods since beta and the offical fallout 76 twitter has shared screenshots of people using mods, and the fo76 FAQ says this about using mods "We do no support the use of mods as they can cause crashing and game instability."
---
Nowhere have they said you aren't allowed to use mods.
---
Antagonist or riot
---
I like the event and have beaten it with 3 left 4 times
---
Well that is just asshole behavior from them then.
---
I advise double-checking that pacifist mode is on, and maybe testing it with a friendly other player to be sure.
---
Honestly, I think PVP should be removed from Adventure mode entirely.  It's never used as intended anyway, only by people exploiting the system to grief.
---
Hook your machines up to a power switch and turn them off when  you're at max caps.
---
Are you on pc? Would be nice to see you doing that could learn me a thing of two :-) I usually try to crouch slowly and wait to ambush but when fighting top players it's very difficult. I use chameleon obviously and take my time moving between points but it's easy to get noticed at a short distance let alone melee distance. Plus other players can hear you coming and it shows on pibboy when you're not in stealth. I never use Stealth boys because they're rate and you could drop them on death
---
The point being is we shouldn't have to use mods to have full access to a game if you are deaf.
---
No problem my dude. Honestly, im not sure. I dont have much expierence with those but im sure someone on here will let you know.
---
Only the people that are in your team can build stuff at your camp. So look at anyone who has been in your team recently
---
This is not true, at least for me. When my power gets shut off, everything in my machine is unlisted.
---
This was a teammate, not a random player.
---
Or, yknow, you did it yourself..
---
The Free States house out in The Mire.
---
It two train cars side by side with the kitchen and living room in one car and the bedrooms in the other. The Commonwealth flag and desk work real well on giving you that whole seperatist/militia vibe.
---
That is under armor, not apparel.
---
Yeah all of that would be a miserable ideal lol. Let’s take out all of the features that make the game unique even the most prized player vending lol. I don’t think player camps are going to be decreased though totally could see a apartment type area to give options kinda like in diamond city. Don’t like settlements and want more of the traditional elder scrolls fallout housing come here.
---
Check out the posters at train stations. Some side quests can also be triggered by wee notes pinned to the poster boards! ;)
---
Lose your turrets.
---
Is this kosher per TOS and will it mess with anything else? Because man I need this fix in my life.
---
Cooking stove is NOT kitchen stove. I made that mistake before
---
Don’t have any
---
I've seen it triggered a few times since then but I thought you just had to walk up on that little cabin and that would trigger it. I haven't actively tried to trigger it though since I did it that one time so I don't know if that's accurate or not.
---
Yeah i do too, there's survival for that
---
But just the ones in his bunker after they tried to kill him so can’t really hold that against him.
---
At least you're getting in.  My game has crashed 3/3 times today loading into the event.
---
I honestly like the fact that backpacks are intended to be earned as a quest reward. It made me actually feel like I was playing a game instead of grinding for caps. Sure, some of the challenges are a little "meh" but others, like the tests and trials, are at least fun little novelties. Simply buying backpacks would be lame in comparison. Imagine if they *had* made it an Atomic Shop item...
---
Anyway, they built this entire questline around backpacks, so they're probably never going to allow them to be traded.
---
You can't find anything desirable on the market forums?  I find this hard to believe since pretty much everything has been for sale at one time or another.
---
It only stopped you from getting them if you were not a Possum, otherwise they still drop.
---
What if there was a 35 place limit on letters tho
---
Just out of curiousity did you find the item in the same session/server that you got it from the purveyor?  Or did you initially get the item during one game session and then again from the purveyor at some other time/date/on another server instance?
---
Must have been a team mate.
---
I also totally didn't read your post all the way through realizing it's more about finishing the challenge of encountering an alien/flatwoods monster. I've come up on him twice in the mire. Seems to be a good spot to look for him.
---
I’m calling shenanigans
---
Happened to me all weekend. As soon as I’d FT to the PP event, game would crash.  I honestly don’t know how to get down there with our FTing. But just gave up each time when the event was over.
---
Ghouls destroy you. Robots and super mutants as you said as well. Makes it completely impractical
---
wow, that's a heck of a deal!
---
I run around in X-01 with a Super Sledge all day long. I don't think it's a "puss" thing to do.
---
I have the wetsuit plan if you're still looking for it. GT: mokey d
---
I prefer my commerce in game for the most part. We shouldn't need third party tools for trade. 
---
In fact, by even promotong third party tools for trade we are letting the pressure off Bethesda to fix their trade system.
---
This might be part of your problem. The Gaus can deal a lot of damage in PVE, especially with sneak but it’s not effective in PvP because there’s a cap on per shot damage against other players, if you need to defend the factory from higher level players, a Powerful Auto Handmade, Plasma Grenades and Chameleon Gear (or stealth boys) will really help you stand a better chance. If you’re using the Gauss to defend yourself in PvP you’re effectively hamstringing yourself, it simply takes too long between charging shots for you to pin down an opponent using a shotgun or automatic weapon.
---
Put on your excavator armor, go through Lucky hole mine. Gather lead. Put on scrapper and scrap the weapons from the mole miners. Make lead from the lead ore. Make gunpowder from cloth and acid. Do a few runs through anywhere with supermutants for more guns for more steel.   
---
Make ammo.
---
I once saw one near pylon 13 coming from that nearby workshop
---
The only way I would pull a beast onto your CAMP is if it attacks me. Why would I pull one, if you just redesign it? "like a bored griefer." gives it away.
---
But thats it if I have those perks?
---
User reviews on sites that sell the game crack me up. tHiS iSnT a FaLLoUt GaMe derp
---
Funny, I have purchased off unpowered vendors and had my power shut off on mine with everything absolutely accessible by other players.
---
You may want to take a second look.
---
Uranium Fever, Leader of the Pack, AWOL Armaments for starters.  These events always drop legendaries (Uranium has at least 3, Leader has 3, AWOL has 1-3 depending on gutsy spawn)
---
Whitesprings, WestTek, Harpers for Random legendaries 
---
Arktos event also has a few (lots of legendary creatures during the event)
---
First workshop I found when I started playing and shall always be my love. That and Bog Town. Mmmm Bog Town...
---
I really don't participate in pvp, I keep pacifist mode on and I understand the risk of taking a workshop, I need to get a good job for pvp because it's useful, but I honestly just like this game as a pve experience. Working on getting the cards to make a handmade right now actually
---
Doesn't work. Turning the power off just delists you as a vendor on the map.
---
 Was coming here to just now say I had managed to experience this again.... except.... this time I did NOT consume anything. I was actually scrolling through my AID Tab in *order to* consume a Disease Cure, but never got that far... :(
---
However, as typically simple as it may be to reach Task Manager and force a dump....... :S  
---
I think that due to me having created a custom screen res in order to run at 65Hz, it's the cause of me being unable to actually Alt-Tab when 76 hangs, as my desktop (for whatever reason) isn't operating at 65Hz and it doesn't display anything besides the Alt-Tab windows :( I just am greeted with a black screen.
---
For me to even kill 76 requires blind navigation of Task Manager (Shift+Tab, right-arrow 5 times, Tab, type 'fallout', Del, Enter). Though, my keyboard does have the Context Menu key, so I could still navigate to that I suspect... I get the impression mine would be 16GB though, since that's how much RAM I have, as 76 generally only uses 4.5GB.
---
I'll give it a shot, since it's still frozen (was hoping maybe it'd recover since I had just died in Arktos and kinda wanted to, at the very least, recover my Junk, not that I really need it). Looks like it'll be a Context and up-arrow 5 times... but what happens after that, I dunno. Will be a new experience for me. lol
---
**EDIT:** Oooh FFS Windows -.- Can't see my desktop or task manager... nope... But it'll sure as shit display the context menu just fine! \*sigh\*
---
**EDIT2:** I was close... it was 11.3GB! I guess the dump's size is whatever 76's "Working Set" size is *(or at least that's what my test reflected on my laptop when I opened and dumped Edge.)*
---
You have 3 options for getting legendary items:
---
**Option 1: Buy them from other players** - Everyone and their grandma is running vending machines. Just hover over their camp icons and look at the display to see if they have any weapons or armor. If possible, try to find them on the map to see what level they are. Exceptions exist, but as a general rule you're not going to find anything worth using at a level 20 something's camp.
---
Don't worry about getting a "god roll" right off the bat. Start with a single star or 2 star item that fits your play style. Do you like fast melee weapons like knives and swords? Go for Furious or vampire. Big, slow hitting weapons like sledges and war drums? Try to find an instigating (dbl damage on first strike) or executioner's (dbl dmg when enemy is &gt;40% hp). 
---
As you start specializing your build you can shift towards one of the meta styles like bloodied unarmed or PA wearing anti-armor sledgehammer guy, but for now anything that helps increase your dps is good.
---
**Option 2: Farm them** - Drop a nuke, or hope someone else does. Kill monsters, collect loot. If there's no nuke, go someplace with a high likelihood of having legendary enemies, like West Tek or RobCo. Also, events. Uranium Fever guarantees 3 legendary pieces and only take 8-10 minutes. People poo poo it because the gear is capped at level 40, but a god roll level 40 will be a hell of a lot better than a shitty level 50. AWOL Armaments guarantees at least 1 legendary, and often more. One Violent Night guarantees a level 45 legendary enemy at the end, and there's usually at least a couple legendary ghouls that spawn in the waves leading up to the boss. Monster Mash usually spawns a handful of legendary ghouls over the course of the event, but there's no guarantee there.
---
**Option 3: try your luck with mama murmurgrh** - As you've noticed, there's new legendary exchange machines that take your unwanted legendarily and give you scrip. If you've tried option 2, you probably have a handful of things that don't work for you. Ask yourself, "would someone else like this?" If so, put it in your vending machine for a reasonable price and help finance option 1. If not, feed it to the legendary wood chipper.
---
Once you've scripped some stuff, head to Berkeley Springs and look for the recently opened train station. There's a wonderful lady in their that will take our scrip and give you a melee weapon, gun, or armor piece with the number of stars you want. 1 star weapons cost 25 scrip, 2 stars cost 50, and 3 stars cost 100. I suggest sticking to the two star weapons to begin with so you have twice as many tries at getting something good. 
---
Also, what system are you on, and what's your preferred build/playstyle? If you're on xbox I have an assortment of very reasonably priced starter legendaries that I'd happily cut you a deal on.
---
I don't need a "second" look. I had to bang my head against why EVERYTHING from my fucking shop kept getting de-listed half a dozen times before I realized everything was being de-listed when my generator was being destroyed. 
---
So. This is more bethesda incompetence. Shit works one way for some people and another way for other people. I can't keep my shit IN MY SHOP because of bad game design, and you can't keep your shit OUT of shops because of bugs.
---
Cool but fake story. Or it was someone you teamed up with.
---
To your original question - I have been able to build underground at my base after occasionally spawning under the terrain but stuck to a rock face so I didn’t fall.  I’m trying to figure out how to consistently be able to enter the upside down world, I’m going to experiment with a crafting station that’s just barely visible above the terrain and hopefully use the exploit similar to where you can enter a locked building by using a crafting station.  My goal is to move the whole camp underground except for the top of that crafting station and maybe a cryptic sign of some sort.  (Drink me, take the red pill, etc)
---
I know, however I think it should be adressed. 
---
Thats the only reason I did make the post.
---
Is anyone selling a Neon Letters plan?
---
Doubtful, they’re extremely rare as a drop
---
What makes you think they didn't consider it but decided it against it for whatever reason?
---
Absolute bullshit. You're playing a glass cannon, if you get hit a lot you die. Loosing 10-20% of your ER sisn't going to make you significantly more resistant to dying.
---
EDIT to add details. My armor by default doesn't give me rad resistance. Because I run a bloodied+rad build, and being irradiated is the point. Managing my rads through chems is a more viable mechanic...because you can't stack enough rad resistance on armor to really avoid death significantly through armor mods.  
---
Same with robots. Even with the mod, I have more ER than DR from my combat armor. I still go out of my way to NOT GET SHOT because I run around at 10-20% health, and even with every perk in the game that helps  mitigate death, if you get hit a lot in this game, you DIE. Because you're running on low health. 
---
The goal in a bloodied build is _not to get hit_ by maintaining distance or to take things down before they can land a hit on you.
---
Same here...
---
They said limited - not exclusive.
---
I would love a server chat.
---
Hoes mad
---
I play on both PS4 and PC. I stream to 0 viewers often, but I am down to give you a personalized survival murder or adventure workshop PvP. Just not today. I have to go hiking later apparently.
---
Where’s your camp?  I need a mothman wing
---
Oh so it was the enclave underarmor that was the problem and not the imposter sheepsquatch outfit lol.
---
I have a level 83 gunslinger.  He alternates commando / gunslinger.  High agility, high luck, gun-fun crit focused vats monster of doom!  He outrageously functional, and a behemoth in any combat situation (Queen/Arkos etc). 
---
Pros: 
---
1) high lethality 
---
2) sneaky
---
Cons)
---
1) not team friendly. 
---
(Your crit headshots doesn’t play well for sharing kills or experience)
---
2) one trick pony
---
I don't mind it. I'm wanting my character to look as NCR veteran ranger as possible but with an Appalachian flavor. Closest besides this was either the drifter outfit or hunters long coat. I like this new one so much better. Looks ready for anything.
---
&gt;wouldn't of
---
Should we tell him?
---
It wouldn’t be important to reference a 12 year old game that they had no part in.
---
Getting mad and luring them to a base to "get back" at someone for something they don't even know you're mad about and probably don't even care.... Whiny.
---
Using traps and luring people .... Fun.
---
Done
---
that I believe is possible always seems way harder with a bunch of people instead of my wife and i
---
Not exactly sure what you mean by the first bit, but Bethesda hasn't said anything in regards to .ini tweaks. I'd imagine it's not a problem since in-game settings modify .ini files anyway.
---
As for the second bit, this tweak should only disable the Enlighten effects which appears to manipulate how dark shadows are, and how bright some textures appear. I prefer to disable it since it gives off a more "realistic" representation of lighting, and eliminates the intermittent lighting bug that's been around for a while.
---
So there’s a plan called *kitchen stove*?
---
Thank you! &lt;3
---
Then rage on.  I would love to get a chance to get blackbird.   "Limited-time" only means that it isn't always available.  If they said it was "one time", then i can understand raging
---
This ☝️ Times a bazillion.
---
I would add you, then kick you just to can add you again lol
---
Limited time means as in its only in the shop a limited time if it wasnt supposed to come back it woulda said exclusive.
---
Find a junk pile out in the world and make your camp there, so you have your own personal junk extractor. There are a few piles along the river bank on the west side of the map. Start at mothman museum and walk north along the riverbank, you will find them.
---
shrouded gives at least as much of a stealth bonus as Shadowed, and weighs less, so yeah.
---
I server hopped 10 times. Then 3 times after that it would crash trying to load inside the cavern... i'm on xbox...
---
Thank you!
---
Duly noted
---
Its all good if someone takes it from a water purifier if it isn't locked, same goes with resource extractors
---
Don’t poke the bear!
---
Definitely one of the best looking for sure. But it shouldn’t be clipping. Especially to the people paying real money.
---
Search is a wonderful tool for finding posts others have made.
---
If you search "leave message" in the fo76 sub you'll be brought to several posts asking for this same feature in a slightly different way.
---
Example:
---
Guestbook for guests to sign.
---
Messages in your terminal.
---
Shops with a log of what's bought and ability to say thanks.
---
Just a few that came up from using search.
---
(This is for whoever downvoted me. Assuming you didn't use the search feature.)
---
Bethesda has said they allow mods on Fo76 but do not recommend those and that currently using mods won't lead to bans.
---
Fully agree.
---
lots of vendors do this, and thanks to you all!!!  it will not attack people if it's unlocked.
---
**Super Mutant:**
---
* Your STR and END are increased by 7, but your INT &amp; CHR are reduced by 6.
---
* Become immune to radiation. 
---
* Can utilize 'Stabilized' perk without Power Armor due to increased STR but can no longer use Power Armor frame due to size increase. 
---
* Able to craft Heavy Metal Armor from Power Armor parts.
---
* Greatly improved effects for Cannibal perk. Stealth perks are nerfed due to louder movement. 
---
**Ghoul:**
---
* Radiation no longer reduces maximum HP but instead gives passive regeneration. This increases with with the amount of Rads. 
---
* END increased by 5, CHR reduced by 5. 
---
* Chems have reduced effectiveness, but you no longer need to eat or drink.
---
That's it off the top of my head for now.
---
I did it over the weekend and it triggered again the next time I visited the Mire, but I didn’t complete it the second time so I don’t know if it was bugged then.
---
A robobrain, you wont need food, but would need oil, screws or something else, damage boost to energy weapons more AP but less speed
---
Yay! Now I can get one too.
---
I'm torn over the nukashine and black bird
---
Doesn't it show pics in the atom shop?
---
Haven't checked today so seriously asking.
---
Favorited gear has a double confirmation screen when scrapping it
---
This has been the worst. I've only got an HR or two to play during the weekdays. Which means apart from fixing and selling I may only run into one good legendary per sitting. And lately they've all dropped one stars. It's beyond aggravating to blow through junk and ammo to pull down one of these badass beasts only to be shat on with the worst drops ever. Bethesda please even out the drops.
---
Idk, I just don't want to favorite 10 armor
---
I want them to add legendary PA so bad
---
The punch bowl never works for me...
---
I have both cards maxed but I never get the option to send them to my CAMP
---
Genius here
---
glad to hear it, good luck down there!
---
Someone give this guy a silver, at least. I nearly choked on my bagel.
---
Have we gotten that US Flag bandana that appears in that outfit preview?  I don't recall seeing it in the Atomic shop yet.
---
Good to know limited time doesn’t mean limited time. I’m done buying skins with fomo
---
Honestly need the whole villian clothing line up
---
I once experienced the same when lvl 90 player thought it would be smart to tap that stupid buttler blocking the door... It's rather amusing entertainment, lacking only popcorns.
---
I am not sure what you are describing is a bug for the people who's shops are active given that Bethesda has said you power on the shop to advertise on the map previously. I think you are suffering a bug by having them delist.
---
It was you or a team member you teamed up with.
---
I got radworms by reading your comment!
---
Hi.
---
My solution was the ticket I sent to the support. It took quite a while till they finally reset this quest for me with alot of back and forth messaging.
---
Here is the conversation I had:
---
https://imgur.com/a/gG6l1P3 
---
Try to ask for an Escalations Team Member I guess
---
Yes please.  They could even put it in the atomic shop.
---
I keep crashing on Xbox. I'll just go loot elsewhere. Maybe someday Bethesda will fix all their damn bugs... Ha!
---
Never did the quest for that armour, how do you get it?
---
great
---
If shutting down isn't enough, you may want to rethink your camp layout. 
---
For example my camp has an open floor plan with vending machines inside. Everything easily accessible and doors wide open. But if i need too, i can shutdown vending and lockup shop. Unless someone wants to lockpick or use an exploit to gain access, my sales are done for the day.
---
I see plenty of camps with vending machines just sitting outside, which makes it very difficult if you want to close shop.
---
That would be like saying Oblivion had pitiful dlc by ignoring Shivering Isles and KotN and focusing solely on horse armor. Besides, for 5 dollars a pop, Contraptions and Vault-Tec workshops were easily worth the price.
---
Silver, gold, titanium, nuclear material, ultracite, balistic fiber are varying degrees of less common as well
---
I completely agree that Bloodied should not be nerfed.  Other effects should be buffed to compete with Bloodied to add variety to builds.
---
Mutant’s should stack by 10% for each Mutation you have.  Or maybe there should be a cap, I dunno.  
---
Berserker’s should definitely receive a buff considering you are sacrificing armor for damage.  Or maybe it should receive an overhaul and work like Adrenaline where damage stacks for each kill you get.
---
Junkie’s could use some love too.  Withdrawals are negative effects and should let you pack a better punch in return.  And I am not sure if they fixed it but you used to lose your addictions upon death.
---
Those are my thoughts on a few that come to mind.  I am not sure about other effects, like Furious, as I do not know how they work.  I do not know if that should receive a bit of a buff or not.  I would also like to see new effects in the future but they need to address the ones we have now.
---
It does but you know how crappy thier pictures can be
---
Found 1 in a green locker at Sylvie &amp; sons logging camp
---
Some team mate did it. I don't know who.

would gladly pay 1000 atoms for this blueprint

Go to video game pope YouTube channel

No it's not lol.

I forgot that Money talks

Any sources on this?
---
Circle arktos pharma (ignore starting the event), braxton medical and the watoga civic center. Before server hopping check for one violent night, free range and awol armaments and complete them. Rinse repeat.
---
Was it on that small parking lot near the road and those ticket booths? I got my battle down there against Behemoth when that stupid sentry bot killed it just as I fired my gatling plasma hitting that three-wheeler-tank-creeper instead. Like you said, fun times.
---
Ahh
---
Stings and things gives badges? Like Possum badges?
---
I have issues with several of your basic tenants here. One, you shouldn't be selling non-legendary gear. The base price for a non-legendary gun should be 0, as it's vendor trash or scrap trash you shouldn't be wasting peoples time with. Two, mods shouldn't be put on weapons, as all they do is increase the weight of the weapon in the vendor, reducing the amount of items you can list, and the usability of the stash for general gameplay.   
---
And, as Demorgoth points out, the weapon affects the value. Instigating on a ripper is trash. Furious on a black powder weapon is trash. Very few primary affects (bloody, junkies, berserkers, off the top of my head) are uniformly useful on gear.   
---
Some, like 40% power attack damage/40% less damage while power attacking are worth a lot combined on a chunk of gear, and 40% power attack damage is great on it's own, but 40% less damage while power attacking is pretty crap on it's own.   
---
So we can put in a median value, but that's not going to really be representative of the truth. But sure, why the hell not.
---
I managed free range by myself, but the brahmin died. Spent a lot of time in a house. LOL What is it with one darned cow wandering off??
---
Forgot to add it took forever to kill the sheepsquatch, but I did it finally.
---
About a day, I think.
---
Every 20 hrs i believe
---
That's nowhere close to where you spawn in when you travel to my camp...
---
20 hours after your last sale to a vendor, if you do what i do and empty that bad boy out in one go
---
I barely ever have much aid on me mainly just stim packs. And radaway no Rad-X as it suppresses your mutations. I have a ton of ammo and use bandolier and battery included on all the time unless crafting/modding. If I am hungry I just kill some random enemy and eat what ever meat cause I use the carnivore mutation if I’m thirsty I just drink what ever water and hope I don’t get a disease and then if I do and don’t have disease cure I go to white springs also the only reason I carry around the excavator armor for the carry weight. Haven’t gotten the calibrated shocks yet. With the new backpack I am rarely over weight unless it’s a nuke zone at white springs and I’m just grinding away quitting and logging back in over and over. Before we had the script machines and vendors having the entire pool of caps to sell too I would team up with some one. Die and then spawn on them to fast travel faster to sell unwanted legendaries. I also have all of the weight cards maxed out to switch on if I need to fast travel. I think with all of them I was able to carry well over 600 pounds.
---
I will do that. Shouldn't it go away when a teammate leaves? 
---
I guess it's like repairing a turret or something.
---
You on Xbox?

My main character is a stealth rifle guy.  I feel like my damage is good overall, min/max character with full \*\*\* harder to detect while sneaking armor and a combo of an AA/E handmade and I/Aim/reload hunting rifle, but when you see a friend's bloodied build with a B/SS/STR mole miner gauntlet eat a stealth boy and take out the Sheepsquatch Impostor in a half dozen hits before it can even figure out what's happening, bloodied characters are better by a wide margin.  I literally just took a second pylon, he asked if I shot the thing yet, I ate a stimpak, jumped up over the berm and shot it with an instigating, better criticals VATS crit (5-10% damage tick at best) and said "go for it", then watched it's health melt.  Event was done in under a minute, including the time it took for dialogue and his two accomplices to grab the pylons.  My dude just merked the thing before it could even do it's health regen.  His sneak attacks are somewhere in the 3000-5000 range depending on day or night.
---
I'd be happy if Mr. Sandman applied to any area where you're in shadows, day or night.  Nighttime under a spotlight at West Tek?  No extra bonus.  Daytime while in tree canopy?  3.5x Bonus.  Shadowed armor mods already exist and only provide sneaking bonus when in shadows, so why doesn't Mr. Sandman work the same?
---
(Realistically, the 12 hour cycle of Mr. Sandman as it exists now makes no sense.  I get 3.5x sneak damage in the evening, when there's still a few hours of daylight left, but as soon as it hits 6am, I'm back to "daytime" dps".)
---
It would encourage a more tactical playstyle that isn't reliant on time of day.  2 perk points is an investment.
---
While I'm at it, it would be nice if landmines didn't disappear after 30 seconds.  I used to use them on chokepoints and tight hallways all the time in Fo4.  I haven't used a mine once since the first couple days of BETA.  If I had a 3-5 minute window to utilize them, I would definitely carry a half dozen at all times.
---
edit: spellinz n Kelsey Grammer.
---
If you're confused, [look at the waterline along the CAMP.](/spoiler)
---
Looking forward to that! Ign xxpaarthurnaxx add me and we can go whenever you're free :-)
---
Not necessarily true because my camp is in a pond - I had to place my camp on the ground near the edge of the pond and players always spawn inside the water where camps cannot be placed- but not under my camp.
---
But logging into a nuked zone doesn't destroy your camp 🤔
---
Only possibility is it detonated as you were loading?
---
I deliberately limit the number of rare-er costume items I list because of this.  I list a couple, but not the 20+ I'd WANT to list if i didn't feel like I was baiting people in with trash.
---
There's always one dumb cow I swear. I've killed the sheepsquatch that show up but if the cows die it's a fail, and they die pretty fast.
---
Go to the Miners Monument near Uncanny Caverns. Server hop till you see a guy lying on the stairs directly in front of you (approx 50m in game where the Robot Charge Pods are). 
---
It took me around 10 server hops. 
---
(Once you have it, you ll encounter broken ProSnap cameras every 30mins of gameplay wgen looting stashes or bodies.)
---
how do you do that
---
Seriously...the only time I don't get actively mad about this is if they're within a 5 cap fast travel fee from vault 76, and the gear is bellow level 15.
---
So, I have this issue where other players are constantly holding my junk. I don't know how they did it, but they are always carrying it. I usually have to kill them in order to liberate it all.
---
Jokes aside, PVP is super good for junk. There are plenty of loot pinatas out there. The issue is identifying them. Typically those fulltiming excavator armor have a lot of junk. I think my biggest haul to date is around 800 lbs. Maybe three times have people dropped about 600 lbs. It is quite horrifying how many poor innocent woodland critters they had to kill in order to get that much stuff. They are the real scourge of the wastes.
---
People can already do that on Mic, I'd just make it so you can block players and also report them if they leave an offensive message on your terminal. 
---
At least if they write it on your terminal you have proof to back up your report and there will a higher chance they get banned (because of the proof).
---
I am not a sophisticated player, I didn't know how they tagged my shack. Now I know.
---
What else can a teammate do to your camp?
---
Just nerf bloodied and everybody will use another weaker builds. And don't tell me bloodied is balanced, this is bullshit
---
Nuka shine was nice too
---
Usage is king.  If you are using grenades, grenade launchers, missile launchers, etc yes.  Nuke launchers can climb up to 1k+ with full health.  
---
Explosive flechette harpoon guns are insanely strong.   
---
If you want nominal returns, shotguns are an explosive and critical additive per pellet.  
---
The perk in perception that expands radius  is also good with the above considered
---
have enough junk to empty them out in one go
---
Eh, fair. Poor design choice. If you power-down your shop, it shouldn't work. If you power up your shop, things should remain listed. 
---
If this legit isn't working for you, build your stuff into a room at the top of your build and lock the door when you don't want people to use it. That way they can't walk into it when the base is loading.
---
And SBQ, people will come. No need for mic or anything. Just pop in and do the best you can. Tag the queen so you get loot, then help out with the mobs. As long as you're putting in the effort, I've found that other players don't mind.
---
Farm yao guai for acid, and springs as a bonus.
---
Go to the mine bar (the rusty pick, i think) in the ash heap near the fire-breathers base and look at the sandwich board add for the excavator armor by the front door.
---
I would prefer it be some quest you have to go do, like curing vampirism is skyrim or something, have to acquire rare item or something, go somewhere specific, blah blah blah
---
I can confirm, got one today from the Daily. When you get the caps for completing the daily, it shows the badge icon instead of the red C icon which let's you know you got one.
---
I think it’s 20 hours after your first sale to the vendor following the reset. I could be wrong, but often I sell throughout the day and it still resets 20 hours after the first sale.
---
Was that blackbird paint exclusive or limited?
---
Find an interesting spot and just work off the landscape.
---
I always assumed you needed the pieces on your inventory,  so I never do the run alone.
---
So all I need is the keycard and the end run in the silo? And BOOM?
---
If this is true, alot more nuclear fire is about to drop.....
---
It would be great to have something like this as a mobile fast travel camp, while you can leave your grand build in one spot and not risk your blueprint never working again
---
Acid extractors are too slow. Server hop at a yao guai spawn for ez acid. Silo alpha and that shack by dolly sods where you do the daily with the possum scout robots are good spots.
---
I ground out my commendations In about an hour by camping the fissure sight south of white springs with a pure melee build. ULPT: A tree that’s wider than you will block most or all of the screech attack damage, just keep the tree between you and the SB until it lands, then pound and profit.
---
I didn’t buy the bar set because it didn’t work as you mentioned. 
---
I was really hoping it would allow for custom signs instead of the half-assed pickaxe mirror now. (No variants Beth? Come on)
---
Link to imgur for pictures. Heading is a flair.
---
According to the patch notes, it is one of 3 events that can reward possum badges.
---
Scrip it before it reverts to a 1 star.
---
I did it yesterday no worries
---
Yup. For sure. Middle mountain cabins can have 3, if that's the spawn there as well. I'm iffy on extractors too, but if you're in a tough spot it can be a reasonable idea to build up around one just for that little boost every time you come back to craft. 
---
Snallygasters are also a good bet, and they're pretty common up where you get the toxic mutagenic waste daily quest.
---
No, people need to earn these things.
---
My only complaint regarding the backpacks is there aren't skins to change backpacks, you actually have to craft entirely new backpacks if you want the Possum one, the black one, the Nuka Cola one, etc.  I'd much rather they be skins you can swap out as you want.  Changing the mod, sure, should take up resources though.
---
Down the cliff to the east from Relay Tower EL-B1-02
---
Idk then. I never carry more than what I'm wearing and two or three guns.
---
&gt; repair kit (the ones that drop from the queen)
---
Thank you for specifying. Seriously. Fuck the Atomic Shop repair kits.
---
I got the armor maybe 30 minutes earlier in the same server. I threw it in. Then bought two 3 star weapons and one 3 star armor. The armor was the same
---
Wait. You can NOT have radworms?
---
Flamer and shotgun skins as well
---
I can do the shocks for you, just supply the mats.
---
GT: Mokey D
---
My friend had a bag when he can't move. Maybe that.
---
Depending on how cheap they can get flux, 2k or so
---
So, the "broken ProSnap Camera" IS thee camera? I have found that on stuff I've shot till dead but have not found how to repair it. I held on to one for awhile and tried a Tinkerers Bench to repair it but could not there. Now, as I think about it, does it get repaired at the weapons Bench?  guess I thought, nope, this is not the camera everyone is using, keep looking.
---
Crap....wanted to fill a room to the ceiling with teddy bears
---
It's nice to have. The bash can also stagger enemies and knock them back a bit. It's super satisfying to bash a ghoul and then shoot him again.
---
Get a friend who has the plans to build them.
---
I had a certain look in mind for my store, but no lettering. My buddy had plans for the neon letters. I made sure there was plenty of budget left and he wrote me a sign, then used a couple of others as decoration.
---
18 neon lights in total. Zero effect on budget, except of course they all counted towards the 50 total lights allowed, but nothing on the actual budget line itself.
---
Same for cameras! I've been server hopping without luck
---
Bottom of a fissure site. Check it out!!!
---
Fridge does not stack with good with salt. Even says so in it’s tooltip when applying, reduces carry by half
---
Armored is okay, reduces carry by half, +90 to whichever one you put on your bag (DR, ER, RR)
---
I have high capacity and fridge
---
I use fridge until I get too fat, stick high cap on and tp away, get fridge back on
---
I don’t use good with salt, so it’s been amazing
---
Except they arnt broken.  So many different things to protect against TSE in PVP. 
---
TSE is no longer the meta for PVP and hasnt been for quite some time. 
---
Its not the explosive part that is getting you killed.  Its the Bloodied or Instigating effects that are owning PVP now.   
---
Explosive is a great all purpose PVE effect, but in PVP you want Instigating or bloodied with VATS Crit and Damage effects.
---
Could be a utilized into a "fun house" type camp
---
It's really just a quality of life change, like loud outs that I think would greatly benefit the game.
---
Did you place it on the Waters edge? The spawn is next to the camp device not inside it so if you placed camp on the edge, the spawn point could be next to it in the water.
---
I was just thinking about Fort Defiance last night. Creepy ass insane asylum. 
---
But then I realized, its just a stones throw from Lucky Hole Mine...which is full of all the other, long running creepy ass lore shit....
---
May be something to it. Probably not.
---
I'm in love with those campers. I found one around the Pumpkin House/Scorch Queen area and it just looks so fun. I think that one was white and it looked very futuristic.
---
Someone needs to give you a blowjob for pointing this out. Not me, but someone.
---
could have sworn it was after your last sale.. but i also empty them out completely in one shot
---
I disagree I play a stealth sniper build and I do ok damage with a maximized build and set up. Not to mention that I lose all of it if i'm not careful and get spotted .
---
Stealth with all the right perks and Max level instigating rifle should kill anything not counting a SBQ or sheepsquatch or the alpha in 1 shot assuming you get a head shot.
---
Master's of stealth powerful in the shadow but done for if spotted.
---
what are the mats
---
I did this once, was fighting ghouls and some random assaultron ran in the way as I began to shoot. 
---
Long story short, I barely made it out of that damned place in one piece.
---
I had a solid plan but it devolved in to auto grenade launcher and screaming REEEEE
---
The
---
Entire
---
Mire
---
i was fortunate enough not to glitch through the world map yet, don‘t jinx me lol
---
Bethesda sees Canvas (has Vietnam flashback)
---
* Make sure you actually have Pacifist Mode enabled.  
---
* If you're using explosive weapons, make sure you have the Fireproof perk equipped.  
---
* Stash your junk often. If you're at capacity, craft or sell something.
---
How much/what kind of junk did you lose?
---
The bundles pretty good deal if some one doesn’t have everything. Comes with the hotter rod paints, power armor station and pip-boy skin. Just depends if you don’t have it yet or not xD.
---
Fridge may not stack with Good w/Salt but it has made all my AID items last for what feels like ages. I hope to eventually get both High Cap and Fridge mod on my main, not sure I'll have the stones to do it on my alt(s). Easy enough to switch between packs depending on situation, and they have 1 WT each so not really a deal breaker by any means.
---
i didn‘t check that out yet, but it‘s on my to-do list.
---
Yeah first sale, same with the legendary scrip. I think item (world vs container) spawns are different though?
---
I repeat every line the super mutants say to me. I try to imitate how they speak. I'm getting really good at it. 
---
My dogs look at me funny.
---
really? because it‘s so dark and swampy? i think it‘s beautiful, the only place where the godrays aren‘t as invasive.
---
I think legendary scrip resets at 5PM PST everyday, I don’t think it’s on the 20 hour timer. Again, I could be wrong on this.
---
Yeah, I have to agree. I've only played 2 days or so. But this has been by far the best community that over been a part of.
---
Melee is by far the best as it gets into far higher damage at later levels, I invested in guns at a lower level and am regretting it as I am far below the power curve now I am about 60 now and am going though the painfully slow conversion from guns to two handed melee and I already see an improvement in my damage output. Lesson is guns feel good early but become trash later.
---
I have to say I don’t think it does. I’m fairly certain they are ‘lazy-loading’ or ad-hoc proximity-loading in bases when your near. 
---
My evidence being when playing with friends or other players - when I visit their camp it’s not instant as if it’s in memory - even if we are all on the same server for some time. 
---
it still loads it in piece by piece as if I had just joined the server. 
---
Leave and come back? 
---
Same thing
---
Actually you do have recourse. Legally they have to give you all the info on why they banned you including any info they gathered that led to the ban thanks to EU laws. It ended up forcing Guild Wars 2 to reverse thousands of bans and the same for Ubisoft.
---
Here is a video on it, you are even mentioned in it that you might want to go this route.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bY_pPslgPE
---
Not as good as a Ghoul Slayer's Gamma Gun. That shit has built in stupidity :p
---
i have given up as every support ticket ends up being same response, first they dont reply until they release another patch and then they say we released a new patch and please try it blahblah. but the thing is they say that then i reply saying its not fixed only to wait another few weeks for the exact same response even when there is no patch. then they started to send the quest walkthrough all over again so yeah i gave up on it, and made a new character just to see the quest to the end.
---
They announced that it ain't coming back. Some items were removed for good including that
---
She gave me one of those two on her first day 😂
---
They also should post the level of the seller. I would rather spend 20 caps to jet across the map and inspect the inventory of someone level 60+ and get relatively decent items, than spend 20 caps to find out someone level 18 is selling 47  pieces of crap.
---
Good looking outfit and I’m going to rock it for a while
---
Sucks that you lost him, but legendary wendigos are relatively easy to find. There's always one at the end of One Violent Night, which pops up almost every single in-game night at 10pm. You can also reliably find one in the wendigo cave unless someone else was just in there.
---
Someone cheated to get them....?
---
Super Mutants always have miniguns which is definitely one of the most complex weapons in FO76
---
Do events. As many as possible. Sleep for well rested. Eat cranberry food for the exp buff. Aaronholdt farmstead on the north of the forest has cranberries.
---
Or the watoga flipboards
---
FWIW I have 32gb RAM at the moment, so I don't think that's where the dump size comes from.
---
And those dumps from the taskman go to C:\\Windows\\Minidump for me, IIRC.
---
In my experience, letting the hang continue rarely results in it freeing itself up.  However, what I have had happen when I've waited, is that the server will register I've died and I'll drop junk.  So from my end, nothins happenin, but when I end task and log back in: **NO JUNK.**
---
Soooo...be careful waiting!  Especially if you've got anything valuable, like stable flux (which should just *not be dropped on death*, IMO.)
---
That was laboriously kind of you
---
Because its dark and scary, and stuff hides in it.
---
Nothing like turning a corner and running into a Murluk Queen....
---
Or a pack of Anglers.....
---
Or a Sheep Squatch.....
---
You can go this route: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bY_pPslgPE
---
It worked to get thousands wrongfully banned on guild wars 2 and "the division". It is a law in the EU for any company that sells things in the EU they have to give you every bit of info they have on you including why you were banned and you can use that to pull up the proof you were wrongfully banned as many others have done.
---
oh yeah; or a wendigo. i REALLY hate them.
---
How many times does this have to be posted? Just stop it
---
Hmm, that may be the case, but i still wanna use guns though, not really a huge fan of melee, like it more as an alternative, pull out a baseball bat when shit gets rough and not my go to thing
---
I had a friend that got the game recently and was baffled when I told him there was no game chat. That's when I was reminded that this game still has a lot of missing essentials
---
Just had my encounter with that place today it was aaaaaaahhh not very nice
---
So?
---
Can someone list them for ease? So the giant tea pot, is that landview lighthouse? It would be very helpful to know where specifically to look
---
Those backpack missions are pain in the ass.. and events are too.. nobody participate them and I do not try them anymore..
---
When eating the corpse does the damage gets registered?
---
I'm always eating corpses at 20% health while being beating and shot at and I never had less HP than before.. Maybe that is just my feeling
---
I don't think there's a way to determine that a player has "earned" a backpack, if they could just buy one it would undermine the whole scout experience. I have seen people selling plans for backpack mods.
---
To be fair, *Every* MMO I've ever played goes through the swings of the DPS meta.  For a good while in DDO, it was a swashbuckler bard, if you can believe it.  A fancy pirate with a rapier and little buckler shield could out-DPS a half-orc barbarian with a two handed axe, a dark elf necromancer specializing in death magic, or a halfling assassin by a wide margin.
---
I played that game for close to 5 years, and the meta solo elite build constantly fluctuated, exactly how 76 is doing.
---
That same was true for WoW, but I only put less than a year into that one.
---
Path of Exile also has it's meta builds that constantly change.
---
The idea of the DPS meta is the player base taking advantage of raw numbers to create a patchwork monster that the design team never saw coming.  They fix it, release new content with potentially abuseable legendary weaponry, the player base adjusts and it's a perpetual arms race.
---
You just described a drivers licenses suspension, not a ban. A ban is permanent a suspension is temporary. Look up the literal definition of suspension.
---
You first have the activate the questline by searching the corpse. Thats why I recommend server hopping in that location.
---
It's also on a personal 20h timer.
---
I run vampires and instigating mainly, and that would make vampire weapons OP big time with the right weapons/perks.  I belive the vampire's effect works as a factor of time (i.e., you heal at a specific rate for a specific amount of time per hit regardless of weapon).  No compounding effect, just extends the health regen period.  An instant hit to health related to damage would be very cool, but I can see that being OP especially on black powder or other slow but high damage weapon.  Since I'm a vampire user mainly I'm open for anything to make my weapons better!
---
Actually at this point, I can solo all those. So not so scary anymore. But there was a time I avoided the place.
---
Now I go there to find loot...
---
Sounds like your toon found some magazines stashed in the locker room at the fire dept.
---
yeah, I had the same idea. If you are going to use guns make Shure your perks make sense as it will become a hassle later.
---
More info to come at E3, I expect we start seeing  Nuclear Winter updates soon after.
---
Yea you need both perks. You also need some space in your budget however this last update made it that they take no room so I’m not sure about that anymore. I’ve noticed with deathclaws, mirelurk kings, and megasloths that you need to be directly next to them for the option, and sometimes even have to damage them a lot (idk why)
---
Thanks for this. What type of gun are you running with him?
---
That’s exactly where it was!
---
I put it on a hill by the water
---
I’m a Bloodied build too and I never die while I’m eating but by the time I get up I’m already taking bullets from 5 people so I don’t last more than a second.
---
I hate metas. Unpopular opinion, nerf bloodied builds.
---
You can buy the stands for them now they just havent added the display feature yet. U can buy them at the bos vendor
---
The Sunken Church in the Mire.  I remember the first time I stumbled on to that place and kept going down and down.  I was very surprised how much detail was put in to an unmarked location.  It kind of reminded me of that movie As Above, So Below.
---
nice, because the tracked challenges are a bore, I'd rather grind events honestly. Thanks
---
That's you beginning to feel burnout you'll still find it fun then less fun then so on take a break my guy come back in a week or two since you're only getting a bit burnt out then have some fun :)
---
Penitentiary north of Morgantown is a bit...off...as well. Definitely a place I wouldn't want to be in.
---
Yes, those are both basically mandatory for ~~stealth archer~~ sniper builds. The STR hit that comes with bird bones kind of sucks, but the reduction in carry weight can be mitigated with pocketed armor and.or a backpack. Grounded has literally zero draw back if you don't use energy weapons. 
---
Also, I would highly recommend speed demon. The increased hunger/thirst is a small price to pay for the buff to reload speeds.
---
You're not much fun at parties are you
---
This. I always make sure I always have 24 scrip left in the machine to scrap armor for this reason
---
Start with sneak perks
---
They hide in trees btw. Slink down right behind ya. Sketchy as
---
TP to vault to get a free caps TP... then you can TP to your camp with no cost.
---
I already RP as a ghoul, eating as many vault dwellers as I can with an overly scarred up face and body. Speed demon helps with immersion.
---
Go the legal route and force them to or they get hit with millions in penalties. :)
---
Yeah, which is why i have unspent points at the minute, dont wanna rush it. I obviously dont want to become useless either, but the idea of a pure melee build is just not that interesting to me. A plus with non automatics is that you dont burn trough ammo so quickly. Kinda toying with a shotgun build, but not sure at the same time :p
---
It's often easier to leave when you'd have to take down like 3 waves of mirelurk hunters, because after failing that you get the retake quest and it's often like "kill two baby mirelurks that has taken over". (not always thought... I once did this because of 2 wolf waves and returned for few dozen max level super mutants having an orgy in crafton steel mill)
---
dude, stop. i hope we‘re playing different games.
---
There's that other church nearby with the spooky organ playing. Whaaaaaaaat
---
I find that Bethesda really seems to hate rifles... :( which sucks,but the sheer mass of carrying 3 fully kitted rifles weighing more than it would to carry 10 heavys with bear arms is irking me. Prolly going to rework.
---
Ghoul players would be immune to radiation and gain a bonus to stealth, but their hunger meter would deplete 30% faster and their non-sprint speed would be reduced by 10%. Or something like that.
---
Super Mutant players would have an obvious strength and endurance increase, but lose intelligence and charisma. Maybe they could have their own special power armor suits.
---
Scorchbeast players would be able to fly and spam sonic blasts, but wouldn't be able to do anything else, not even land.
---
Cabin in the wood's with the earthquakes, screams and spinning pictures in the cabins. Anyone tried camping there, how close can you get to build?
---
Oof!  Ok, yeah, WinDbg actually downloads a bunch of resources when it's analyzing things, and it sometimes looks like it's not chooching, but it is.  BUT...yeah, don't stress your bandwidth allotment over it.  Thanks for trying!  Seriously.
---
Both Stealth and Crits are already great, especially if you pair them together, and especially if you're using them on a Commando or Guerrilla build. A stealth VATS commando with a basic level 50 non-legendary handmade can shred scorchbeasts and sheepsquatches, and it only gets better with legendary effects.

what location is that?

I have one small locked room and every day at least one hero just has to pick that lvl3 lock to take a look at my bed! F*ck you I want to sleep in private, what you think I stored some free miniguns between my linens or something?

It’s legit. Looks like the cowboy duster but with armor variations and a grey coloring. Worth the 800 atoms
---

I travel with 2. High capacity is equipped and armored when I'm overweight.
---
You make good points and I see what you are saying. I’ve watched people test it in battle and gameplay and they seemed to have a very difficult time not dying quicker than their chems could react. May be it’s their build or skill level. 
---
Have you tested it out to see because the footage I saw showed it to be pretty hard to deal with. I’ve not tested it personally so I was basically speaking from what I had seen and my own build.
---
Edit: I see you have it. nm
---
Than maybe it's a combination of my unyielding trapper set combined with Serendipty perk but I never die while eating corpses.
---
It takes like 25 hours to get a new character up to level 50, faster if you play on survival and stack all the XP buffs. The reason they give you 5 charcter slots is so that you can have 5 different builds to play with.
---
Yeah . . . Learned my lesson!
---
Damn, I am getting a pet....now if I could find a random spawn cat......
---
100% correct OP !!! This has forced me to start fast traveling to the closest town/station.... and walk to the player's vending location.
---
Yeah the second I saw this I turned to my boyfriend and was like "WE'RE MAKING THIS FOR REAL".
---
There are a few locations that spawn cats but I don’t know if they are random spawn or their location, you’ll have to look it up.
---
Also, once you tame something it has to run back to your camp, meaning it can die or will disappear if you leave the server
---
while we're at it whats with the lack of local maps? I hate that I always have to google what specific building something is in.
---
I just wish they'd add more pre-written words for the small letters set, like all the junk types, like lead, steel, flux, etc. buying, selling, weapon and armor types like shotgun or rifle. This way it's easier to make a sign listing the stuff I'm looking to buy.
---
nooooooooo :(
---
Wrong, suspension means temporary, while ban means permanent, which is why the synonyms for ban you just shared all share the definition of being permanent not temporary.
---

---
No one even says "he was banned from driving for a year" they says "he had his license suspended for a year"
---
I am aware of all you say in this post, but still I have to clarify some points, not all of us are lvl 50+ camps selling system is open for anyone, some low-level player maybe could find useful some handmade to scrap and learn mods or even weapons that doesn't have its legendary part as the bear head.  
---
It is debatable what to sell or what not, even so, we should all be open mind and let everyone has a chance to sell or buy whatever they want.  
---
The other subject about the synergy between effects and weapon, I'm well aware of that, this survey is to collect data from the basic, I know some effects are shit in some weapons, but it is a subject for another occasion, for now on, I must gather information about the most basic concept, the effect itself.  
---
Btw thanks for the answer
---
„do whatever challenge at whatever“ isn‘t very clear or specific
---
maybe tell us that we should talk to the intercom at a specific place.
---
Thanks 5 perk card spaces for 12% definitely not worth it.
---
Bottom of a half buried church in the bog creepy as hell and a great ambush place

The process of butchering, aging and preparing meat for BBQ or other open fire cooking is a lot more involved than just setting it on fire.  If you like eating carbon that used to be flesh, to each their own.  If you've ever tried cutting a chunk off a venison flank from a fresh carcass, grilling and eating it without some age or marinade to alter the cellular structure, an old boot is probably more tender.
---
Obviously I like to BBQ and smoke meat.  Putting a torch to a raw pig carcass is going to singe off the hair and blister the skin, at best.  You need high or sustained heat to actually cook meat.
---
edit: That being said, after watching Chernobyl, I now know why Ionized meat doesn't need to be cooked.  I doubt it tastes good.
---
I don't know how to explain to you that cheating is bad, so have a nice day.
---
Mine is inside a concrete room with the powered garage door. I lock it and turn off player vending if I’m near max caps.
---
You should probably take it down a notch and try a little civility. You could have made the point without the caps and combativeness. Just saying. Take a breath and chill. It’s just a conversation
---
Hahahaha actually funny when difference "light" "sturdy" or "heavy" armors are a fucking pain in the ass in the game (and on F4) when its just as simple as "Leather Armor III R.A. (for t3 leather armor right arm)" or "Combat Armor II R.L. (combat armor t2 Right Leg) to give some examples.... I feel forced to rename absolutely everything in the game.
---
oh god yes, amen. another useful feature they just removed for no apparent reason at all. 
---
we asked for harder games, so we’re supposed to draw our own maps now.
---
One good example of this are challenges. Like visit Crafton dam has been broken since day one and Bethesda has had like what, 27 weeks to fix it... But "näh, what about those little problems as long as people can play fortnite 7.0". Which btw is what we are about to get according the leaks. Those voices talking about "dying if spending too long inside storm area" and so on. Like come on Bethesda... Make sure your tower won't collapse on it's own before adding heavy canon on top of it!
---
It's in the Forest region, not too far from V76. South West. Log cabins. If you find it read all the notes and holotapes, follow the wires to a tree house. ;)
---
Play the game
---
Aight
---
Like if there would be any limit or cooldown to change cards of perks... just remove the canibal one and activate when you need it...
---
Yes.
---
Also, make it so we can activate and deactivate individual neon letters to make some look burnt out (also the ability to change their colors would be cool).
---
i‘ll check it out, thanks!
---
Then the huge backlash about it being a battle royale right after. LOL
---
I’ve never seen anything as “exclusive”
---
Or the worst, you're mid-battle and you misclick in the repair kit menu
---
"LOOKS LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE ANY REPAIR KITS WANNA BUY ONE"
---
...thanks bethesda
---
heh nothing to feel special there. it gonna be back in atomic shop and it's gonna stay there like the hot rod paint did
---
I honestly laughed out loud for that comment. Too bad I don't have gold to give, you'd deserve it :(
---
I like the fact that my stealth build goes to shit when others show up. It mimicks my real life experiences.
---
The quest cannot be replayed by the majority of players.there's a always "that guy" that is immune but whatever.
---
I made a alt for this. Don't finish the quest if the cryptid is not the FM.
---
And yes this week the FM IS an alien and i completed the challenge.
---
Itll take until August for the casual players to get their badges
---
You could always stop being a cannibal......just saying.  There's treatment options.
---
1 year isn't permament per the definition I shared. Also some places call driving suspensions bans. Depends on where you're from.
---
Harpoon gun with fletchettes are a lot of fun that do some serious damage, although the range and accuracy are a bit meh. The great thing with them is you only have to make a small amount of ammo then loot harpoons off your kills. You end up with 10 times what you started with. I recently started really using one as I had a nice one drop from the legendary vendor and have been really impressed. It's quite a unique playstyle.
---
I was going to place my camp in that trailer near the fissure, but I read the note and now the skeleton makes me sad so I can't stay there. Don't read the note and you'll probably be fine.
---
i have had hotrodder since they launched it last time, im not mad.  IMO its one of the nicer PA skins (my favorite). so its gonna be nice seeing it around compared to all the bland grey/green/black everyones running
---
Exactly where is the cat lady house? I've looked all over Morgantown.
---
fucking budget works terrible... I did an awesome base and later I removed 3 wires Im unable to put again not even a single one of them back in the house... I started removing and removing stuff and still not allowed to place wires (or anything else)
---
So now I redo all the fucking house or half my lights and water pumps doesnt get power....
---
they are really fun.  
---
the biggest drawback is the 1-shot clip, of course.   and the reload is not fast.  if you can find a quad one, it's outrageously fun.
---
i never see them laying around.  sometimes see them at watoga train vendor as sometimes sbq drops regular ones and people dump them there, but its rare.
---
Ultimately,  a quad explosive w/flechettes mod with fireproof perk and dense torso (i have all this, minus the quad part) is really fun to just walk up to super mutants and blow their face off.  it almost makes ya giggle.
---
Shoot many enemies...repeatedly.
---
Tried that. I can’t make it past step 9. Anyone I would make amends to is gone.
---
How was that obvious lol?
---
For the challenge, I need the wendigo in the cranberry bog.  I’ll look tonight again.  🤠
---
Thanks for the reply. The character is currently only level 13 so I know using one is most likely a ways off but I wanted to know before building torwards it. I found the plans for the flechettes on a player vendor but haven't found even a basic harpoon gun on one yet.
---
Link me the law where they call them a ban and not a suspension. Because they aren't the same thing, it is why a Thesaurus doesn't consider them interchangeable.
---
we all know it's bugged, so just don't get armour from the purveyor 'til it's fixed
---
This.
---
I tried to put up a message in my vending area warning people that I might not notice they were there unless they bought something, or that they should put on power armor in case I server hopped (it's a long drop). but due to the limits on letters I come across as a threatening 12 year old a-hole.
---
They really missed slot of opportunities with the new weapons in this game. For the most part they all have little to no mods, which is a real shame. I would totally play an insane farmer if any of the farm style weapons were useful at higher levels, excepting the axe which is still pretty good.
---
I just want to transfer my backpack between them
---
I’m not getting one mod again for a second toon, let alone high cap **and** fridge, haha
---
Thanks for the reply, this gives me confidence in my chosen path.
---
OwO
---
yep, nerfing Bloodied just makes some other build alpha and you wind up with a never ending cycle of nerfs.
---
Plus I think the one thing bloodied get's right is the sacrifice it requires.  Too many games have an "alpha" meta build that has no drawbacks, at least bloodied forces you to run around with less than 20% of your health bar to get the most out of it.
---
They can build any non Atom shop items at your camp. But they cannot move stuff you have placed.
---
Everything that leads to an animation should be long press
---
Go to WS and duel the ghouls there, they're all pushovers.
---
They just need to make it so you can destroy the turrets without having to shoot the owner, it's bad enough people set them up next to fast travel points and people are spawn camping. Or instead have the turrets and the whole camp non destructable and the turrets only shoot NPC enemies. At least this way you can have decent firefights with cover so the camp owner still has advantage.
---
Is it just from that angle it looks like that? Because it may be just a visual glitch with the FOV settings you are running not effecting camp items while it effects world gen.
---
Or make one of the legendary armor effects not affect Beserker’s, similar to how weightless doesn’t count against chameleon. Maybe rework cloaking or something because currently it’s a pointless effect. 
---
They should also buff it to be a +100% damage boost at 0 DR instead of just +50%. It’s worse than bloodied in every way.
---
The UK calls it a driving ban
---
https://www.gov.uk/driving-disqualifications
---
HeHe, lemme know how you get on!
---
Scorched beast queen runs. Did 6 back to back yesterday and leveled up from 79 to 82
---
I wouldn't ever use it as my main weap, it's more for fun.   Gat is super reliable main weap master-of-anything.  But harpoons are sure fun to play with for a change of pace.  I have also seen some twitch dudes who do use quad harpoons as main weap, but its not for me.
---
&gt; Just because I'm high level doesn't mean I'm good.
---
Story of my Life
---
as far as i know it does not have any mods, a shame
---
allso... what about different colors based on tipe of missions? like
---
Blue (main quest)
---
green (secondary
---
orange (events)
---
cyan (challenges)
---
I go by thumb rule 1000 caps per good star effect
---
Not the handmade skin that was datamined in march. Any other item is irrelevant eheh.
---
Incase you miss it
---
How long a driving ban will last
---
The court will decide how long the disqualification will last, based on how serious they think the offence is.
---
You can be banned from driving if you already have 12 or more penalty points on your licence. Your ban can last:
---
6 months, if you get 12 or more penalty points within 3 years12 months, if you get a second disqualification within 3 years2 years, if you get a third disqualification within 3 years
---
I see people selling the entire range of mutations in their vending machines all the time, usually for 500-700 caps.
---
Look for camps with a high level owner selling a lot of aid items.  If you see a broad range of serums for a good price, take off Starched Genes, eat a radaway (only removes one mutation at a time) and repeat until your undesired mutations are gone.  Put Starched Genes back on, buy the mutations you want and you're back in the game.
---
I tried Plague Walker on a whim with my melee alt, hated it because I zapped friendlies with poison damage, and did exactly what I described.  I had to re-acquire two serums that cost me 1200 caps.  Given that I can wander around Harper's Ferry and The Burrows and easily clear my 1400 daily cap limit just in that small area, it was hardly a problem.
---
Missions, events, farm enemies etc..etc...just pretty much playing the game normally would get you to level 50
---
Also factor in if any players might actually use the weapon
---
Hahahahaha.  You just have to get right with your inner child.  That's the true apology.
---
This I agree with. It’s basically pointless to use any time of day perks because it accelerates way too fast. I would love to be a nocturnal character but I can only be for about 20 minutes lol.
---
It definitely happened to me in Skyrim.
---
Think that was just adrenal reaction. Bloodied is still +5% damage for every -5% health. So say at 20% health you do +80% damage. Adrenal now tops out at like 60-65% if I recall but they stack with each other
---
I don't understand. Is it a PA build ? If so, marathoner is useless, it doesnt work with PA.
---
If not, Stabilized does'nt work with non-pa build.
---
I'm using this non-pa build with a bloodied LMG, a bloodied minigun and a bloodied gatling plasma for ammo economy with great results as my day to day build: 
---

---
Probably reset to waking up inside the vault at level one. Getting credit for levels past 50 holds definitely be nice. I'm just hoping we get to keep our gear and it's not a total reset.
---
My first response was civil. You replied with a hyperbolic statement, which is commonly referred to as "bullshit". And if you dislike me telling you NOT TO GET SHOT then...wow, that's new levels of sensitivity. 
---
A couple people in this thread are pushing this nonsensical argument that 60 DR more or less will make or break a bloodied build, and that's just blatant misinformation. It's completely illogical to me. 
---
The reality is, it doesn't matter how high your ER/DR is, you're going to die, quickly, if you're in a position where you're taking hits from bosses or even consistent low damage output from trash mobs. 
---
I'd honestly argue that if you had to choose between having zero energy resistance, without being over encumbered, or being over encumbered with all the negative affects that has on movement speed and AP, but having that bonus 60 ER, you'd be better off with the zero ER. 
---
For anyone running bloodied build, it doesn't matter if you only have 15HP and low armor, if you're not getting hit. And it frankly doesn't matter much if you have really high DR/ER, if a strong mob lands a good direct hit on you.
---
Ah hell, Uncanny Caverns is my next stop. I don’t wanna deal with Kings or cave crickets. They always ripped me a new one in FO4.
---
Shoot everything
---
like if once the last patch/free dlc content will be released the game will get more interest.
---
Dont want to sound rude, but once they released all promised, there is no reason (for them) to waste more time in the game... Its not like if F76 would be something close to a sucess...
---
If you think im wrong the fact all interesting cosmetics are only for the atom shop, keeping them away from any DLC or event, their refuse to give some atom credits to players even with such terrible release (and price drop) or the huge amount of important bugs still in the game even if they were known before the release only proves my point.
---
Worth it absolutely
---
Sounds like someone didn’t earn their backup!
---
Nope. I noticed it when I first started building, put down a foundation piece on the right side of the image and started building out into the water only to find, after snapping a few foundations, that eventually the water was level with the top of the foundation (and I started with it a good bit above the water). Had to reverse course and build from the "back" (left side of image) forward to make sure the foundation was high enough to stay above the water.
---
The water definitely slopes upward.
---
I’d add marsupial to the list too.  Extra carry weight and the ability to jump to perches where targets can’t reach you.
---
I understand, you dont like cheating. Then dont do it. I personally dont care. they are games, that I paid money for i can do with them whatever i want.
---
I agree, sitting and sleeping are also accidental hazards when trying to pick up loot, and we need to have a quick way to exit the 24 menus in computers and the map when we hear we are about to be attacked.
---
I use marsupial and bird bones. I did not notice a reduction in carry weight when I applied bird bones. It's possible that class freak at level 3 mitigates enough that it is a non-issue.
---
I love gauss rifles, so I wouldn't touch grounded with a 10 foot cattleprod.
---
I prefer the idea of having to earn the backpack even if the challenges are stupid to a certain degree. If I see someone wandering about without a backpack I simply stay away from them as they aren’t one of the cool players with a pack. You gotta earn your way into this exclusive club, sorry dorks.
---
Think it only amplifies healing. So it won't go up unless you have a regenerating armor piece, vampire's weapon, or food/stimpack buff. Doesn't grant healing, only makes the healing you have better.
---
enjoy your day dankbud0420
---
The only reason I can think of for why they made the rifles and shotguns so heavy, is to prevent people from farming a bunch of rifles for easy scrap. Imagine having the rifle redux and going to grafton steel. You would walk out with like 50 rifles easy.
---
Happens to me daily
---
Performance has been shocking for me on PS4 lately too. With speed demon the game literally struggles to load when I run in a straight line.
---
everything in the attom shop are made by modders
---
Interesting, what part of the map is this?
---
Share a link to it where it actually says ban for a suspension.
---
Is there an upper limit on weapon damage in fo76?
---
Can’t complete the Pioneer Scout, revive an ally, solo either.
---
Cool.
---
It's the same as not wearing it. Or do you mean legendary armor effects still work while broken and you still get the berserker bonus? Still doesn't seem like a terrible exploit to me since you are still giving up defence.
---
Super Mutants can wear Power Armor pieces without a frame.
---
I found one inside the second floor of the white springs golf course. There is a ceiling.
---
Farm steel, lead and (for shotgun shells) plastic.  Along with gun powder.
---
And get ammosmith and super dupee maxxed.
---
For the dedicated - sure. 
---
But I think your putting too much stock in people trying to be a completionist there. 
---
I’ve had quite a few friends who were getting into this and have nope’d at what needs to go into that and what the rewards are.
---
as soon as i‘m finished with my tadpole challenge which is quite some work 😫
---
Just west of the Moonshiner's Shack that's south of Vault 76. Surrounded by several broken down tents and a crashed vertibird, there’s also a raised walkway on the right of the image (which I was able to clip a foundation into so that it’s the entrance to my CAMP).
---
When I made the Arktos BP it was a skin.
---
If you have any legendary rifles for sale that would be super. I'm always on the hunt for a better rifle.
---
Bill D. Better (mouse trap)
---
And what's the % bonus damage for 5 broken pieces and a berseker gun?
---
I totally agree about the sacrifice with a build that wants a little bit of QoL, but there's many work-arounds that exist for a min/max bloody build to mitigate the downsides.  Literally so many that I'll likely forget a bunch.  Off the top of my head we have blocker, dodgy, nerd rage, radicool, and serendipity perks, in addition to DR and offensive mutations with minimal downside on a 3 perk luck investment.  Add in unyielding sentinel armor and a B/SS/STR gauntlet for gear and you can kill everything but the SBQ in a few hits.  If they realize what's happening before you can kill them, the defensive combo of blocker, dodgy, lone wanderer, nerd rage and serendipity should assure that you can take at least a shot or two after burning out your AP.  If the secondary effect on your full suit of unyielding/sentinel armor is AP refresh, may you have mercy upon humanity, you unholy beast.
---
Edit: if you're in a party with Lone Wanderer not applying, swap in three ranks of suppressor and share one rank of strange in numbers, or tenderizer, which is far more of a benefit.
---
If they did it wasn't as the same time. When I played all they removed was the RMAH not the in game gold AH.
---
I’d buy - I can’t convince someone to kick themselves in water for me - every random thinks I’m either crazy, stupid, scamming them, or all 3
---
&gt;legendary armor effects still work while broken and you still get the berserker bonus
---
I'm a reformed completionist. I doubt I'll do more than what I need for the flag, but I get you 100%
---
I’m sure you didn’t “notice” that someone you play with regularly did this while laughing in party and you going “what”.  Come on man.
---
Fully agree about the last atomic shop round up... They head in a good direction. At least about the stuff itself.
---
68 dmg broken armor, 36 armor fixed.
---
Fair enough. If you have a camp in a low level zone, say within about 5 caps fast travel distance of vault 76, I don't really judge you for it. But if you have a camp outside the forest, if you're a higher level (50+) character, which are the VAST MAJORITY of camps selling complete garbage, all you're doing is wasting peoples time and caps. 
---
I do keep an open mind. I see all sorts of camps selling items that I wouldn't personally use, but for reasonable prices/that fit other builds. 
---
But if you're selling max level non legendary weapons/armor for more than scrap prices, you're a fucking con artist. If your inventory is full of plans that are either free through gameplay (ultracite armor, especially, grinds my gears) or commonly drops from the events you get the ingredients from (mutton meat pies)...I feel like you're deliberately wasting other players time. I've been to camps with 100+ plans and a solid 75% of them were ultracite armor plans before. I seriously debated dropping a nuke on their base. 
---
Shops full of cosmetic items for high cap values drive me crazy too...i mean if you want to shove a machine full of clown outfits and asylum gear for 50 caps a pop near vault 76 so low level players can get those atoms...Awesome, just like people selling sub-level 15 gear near there, that's a service, that's a hand up.
---
Selling cowboy hats for 500 caps? You're a scam artist. The only people paying that haven't been playing long enough to realize they're everywhere, for free. 
---
As for basic, again...it's not "basic". If the value spread is from 0 to say 1500, and the vast majority of gear it's on the 0 end of that spectrum, you can't give a really solid answer.
---
interesting, I'll have to check it out. My best "world gen bug" find is a place by vault 76 you can walk through the ground and get inside the rocks.
---
yeah. It’s Arktos skin :)
---
Don't forget to mob the horde for their delicious, delicious exp.
---
I believe you are correct.  I might even say it’s overpriced for what you get even without the camp space issue, but I suppose that is subjective.
---
nice!
---
The dragon is a good opening shot...I used to use an instigating all the time anduntil they fixed the reloading glitch I would scroll that with a bloodied to good effect.
---
&gt; Then the huge backlash about it being ~~a battle royale~~ anything right after.
---
It's like mining in Utah, no matter what you do, you'll find some salt.
---
Those are always fun &gt;:D
---
🤤
---
who cares anyways?
---
Fallout 4:
---
Most if not all of the weapons got redesigned or remodeled (add to it the modular system)
---
All power armores were remodeled.
---
All the building system was made from scrach, and gave a fair amount of variations.
---
New map/enviroment with his own story.
---
F76:
---
New map/enviroment with a very basic Story...
---
A few reskins for buildings or clothes, 90% of them with no effort, other new objects mostly related to decoratio (thaat are so simple that not a single one had more thhan one day of work)
---
And you think its reasonable? god dammed even you can find stuff not renamed, like find Vault Tek workshop "power cycles 2000" on the world with the same name.... A bit more close and our Vault would be 111 again.
---
maybe as a small camp you can use like the power armor
---
It is a battle royale and almost no one wants it. So why wouldn't there be backlash?
---
I'm not sure the accuracy. Saw in a juicehead video about the data mined overseer stuff and the German/Italian translations revealing spoilers with a mention of overseer rank. I think that'll be the prestige rank where you become an overseer and go up through those ranks
---
Well,  now I gotta do it
---
god damn dude
---
I wish they’d be more upfront about what’s going on with the delayed content instead the smoke and vagueries.
---
When you look at it from a distance -  there was a lot of low hanging fruit missed with pioneer scouts that seems like it just won’t show up
---
(things that do NOT require massive network changes or engine internals).
---
eg more possum ‘science’ stuff (jarred heads and hands are already ingame) crossbow mods, arrow types, and attachments etc.
---
Just when I think I'm good, I kill myself with an Explosive weapon for the 4th time that night lol
---
I want that and/or a traveling Brahmin that I can carry my “camp” on, like the caravan from FO4.
---
Oh really? That must be why ghoulish is so good for me, as well as my vampire's swing speed shishkebab. Thanks for the info, though it does fell like ghoulish got nerfed recently
---
Or just a tent to sleep or sent up a mini camp would be cool.
---
I posted here for that, got help really fast. They didn't want anything in return and we parted ways immediately afterwards... it was magical. They even died in water to kill off 2 challenges at once. I found them after, showed off my pack and emoted a heart then left again.
---
I would offer to do the same for anyone on PS4.
---
I tried to revive people at difficult events but they either respawned immediately or someone else got there first. Some dude ate me rather than revive me, that was nice of them /S
---
Oh my that's kind lol thx!
---
I'll take your spoken gold over any granted!
---
But as soon as you enter a PA or change armor,you'll lose the effects and won't be able to equip the armor.
---
What happens when you apply the axe paints to an axe with spikes?
---
I usually try to give away my .38 or 10mm to some newbie if I can find one. But I see your point, because usually I have a hard time finding one. So you have a yes vote from me.
---
I was hoping they would do some bug fixes by now...
---
Yeah - I’ve definitely got the streak too and am trying hard to keep it on the level given the situation
---
Of course! Forgot about that one,
---
I'll bet all of the no-mod weapons were unused assets from an unpublished game that they threw in as a cost saving measure
---
Awesome! Thanks for the reply.
---
With the right build and a shotgun you can get a crit every shot.
---
Nothing has been exclusive one time only. It’s all limited and will return later
---
See your budget as a computing budget. There are limits only because there are limitations, if that makes sense. They didn’t design the Camp system with a budget in mind, they’re just passing their limits on to us, with optimization in mind/prioritized
---
Rare items are dumb to begin with. People will just find ways to circumvent RNG.
---
Stuff like unique skin rewards are a better alternative, like the Arktos Backpack.
---
You can't trade it, and the only way to get it is to actually play the game.
---
Yeah, I think I'm a hotshot until I try to do a nuked WS run by myself. Not so tough against the glowy boys by myself.
---
I believe it's east/southeast a bit. By itself on a farm.
---
I didn't even know you could use the jukebox in this event.
---
Just kept getting out of PA, play instrument, get back in PA and kill mob, repeat.
---
Gonna have to change how I play this one now.
---
In my defense, I keep getting there in the middle of the event so kinda jumping in where the instructions tell me to.
---
Something similar happened to me a few days after launch. I was in Charleston and three level 50 behemoths spawned in - I managed to bring down one before running out of ammo. I was definitely under level 20 at the time. I lost the video of it because my flash drive got corrupted but it's definitely a fond memory for some reason
---
It’s limited - they never said they weren’t bringing them back.
---
LOL I knew exactly what would happen if I didn't. Those kits are absolutely a competitive advantage and shouldn't be atom store items. But I'm glad the improved kits drop plentifully from the queen. They are absolutely essential for an energy weapon vs SBQ. I use 2-3 every time.
---
The axe in the second picture has spikes :)
---
Yeah that would be good idea.
---
And that’s the only way I’ll be able to complete it too. But I feel they should design quests for everyone who is playing the game not try to force people into playing a certain way.
---
PRO TIP - If you stay in your camp covered in double walls and play Wastelad all day long chances are slightly better.
---
nice thing about stings and things is that you can just store all of the insect parts in your stash except radroach meat, which is everywhere. making it possible to turn in right after you start it everyday if you keep your stock up. if you do campfire tales and get the insect ending you can get everything needed there.
---
Can they, at the very least, be scrapped?
---
I only bulk items I'm going to sell so my preference is definitely with you to not auto scrap bulk items. Hours of plastic gathering wasted due to admittedly my own stupidity forgetting and always defaulting to scrapping all every time I see a workbench
---
There's a big difference between one-shotting the alpha or a legendary mole miner at Blackwater and not doing jack squat to the end-of-event mobs like at Free Range or Paradise.
---
My apologies.
---
*ahem* You will embark on an epic quest of menial tasks, tedium, photos, and bugs.... ohh the bugs. Travel around the entire map, spending countless caps on fast travel just to visit a single location for but an instant. Server hop until your fingers bleed. As well as the same two daily quests, and a barely repeatable event with such RNG it will make you weep... 
---
But seriously, once you start it and just work on it as you level it’s not that bad. You only need to do a few things to get the backpack. Selecting the easiest three makes it like a bandaid, just use a crossbow for a few levels and rip that thing off. Then the mods aren’t difficult to get if you just progress with your leveling. But if you try to grind it out, you may(will) be in for a frustrating time. 
---
Ever upward!
---
they never said it would be that its pure speculation and rumors. They did say they were working on a Team Deathmatch so thats what im betting on.
---
It seems I have the plan that increases carry weight even though I read it. I figured I should sell it like I do with my other plans but thought it may be a bug.
---
Modus did know of the ZAX machine that would become John Henry Eden though. There's a communication log in one of the terminals where the ZAX unit is showing the beginnings of interest in specific presidents, breaking protocol to "enjoy" rereading specific entries.
---
I'd suspect MODUS knows of them, but just isn't compelled to mention them outright; in addition to its comm links likely having issues since the war.
---
You're absolutely right. Curse my small screen!
---
I also play a stealth sniper. Even without a legendary weapon, I could 1 or 2 shot just about every non-legendary if I was using headshots. The issue with playing a sniper is not the damage-per-shot but the damage-per-second. For true bullshit, get your hands on an Instigating Black Powder Rifle. If my math is correct, one sneak attack from my build does 1400+ damage.
---
Anyways Scorched are the worst faction ever made for any fallout game... lol now even the Institute looks exciting to me.
---
What about the jester mask? Like maybe less than 10 have it across all 3 platforms
---
this was what I was doing the weeks prior to BETA.
---
12 fps still tops a server disconnect...
---
Every part but the helmet is awesome on it. But the helmet just looks goofy to me.
---
Ok... I'm gonna raise my hand and admit it... I'd even pay Atoms for it... take my monies now!
---
If you get a Ghoul as a friendly on Project Paradise you can heal it and that makes it much easier to keep alive.
---
So as of Project Paradise theres finally a purpose for this weapon with this roll.
---
Take your time and take on groups of enemies.
---
Build and cook. Every little bit of exp points helps.
---
Do events if your strong enough to handle them. Just make sure you look and see where the event is, that's how you know.
---
You can do quests. I'm not into touching the main story or doing much else untill I really explore the map. But to each their own.
---
Listen to the voice clips of ZAK they added in already. He talks about being outside the "closing nuclear ring" just like pubG and fortnite have that force you to move into the center as time goes on. Not to mention the german language bug that has all the names screwed up showing all the names of stuff for the upcoming patch. It is 100% a battle royale.
---
It's actually pretty good,  should try it sometime.
---
I think a good balancer for the ghouls not needing to eat or drink would be make them get stat debuffs if they avoid radiation for too long.
---
Three hook meat hook
---
Whoa
---
After its at your camp. Does it stay there if you log out?
---
Or in the very least be able to break it down into much less components.
---
Im seriously considering that the 90% of the playerbase (that ones that are higher than  lvl 100) are only playing to unlock clothes which interest last not even 48h after were bought...
---
I think it would still be rare as all hell, if not damn near impossible, to obtain a completely matching 3* set of armor with your ideal perks on all pieces!
---
I hate any kind of meta in any kind of game, I like to play however I like to play. In this game I don't like power armor so blast zones kinda suck for me, either deal with the awful ui of power armor or the no armor of a hazmat. I also don't like bloodied build so my damage is basically useless against lvl 100 toxic diseased glowing legendary a-holes.
---
I agree hours and hours of grinding and trading all for them just to reset it seems pointless. If that happened I’d just transferred everything to mule just to have a bank account of legendaries
---
Nope I don’t have strong back. I wanna get all the riflemen perks first
---
They just released a legendary one for the survival weekly challenge that isnt too hard to get. Itll drop at max level which is nice. I know I'm going for it
---
No it didnt.
---
I felt the same way when my cell mate told me. I ate him later on, but I’m still trying to recover.
---
Dayum son, you just straight tore this fool a new one. Agreed with all of the above. Explosive is far from where it should be, in fact it needs buffed now imo. People just don't understand that damage numbers stem from a proper build, combined with gear but not your weapon alone, and certainly not because of explosive, faster fire rate is a close contender too.
---
I didn't know it either until I did it the 3rd time and saw someone start it.  And the instructions on a lot of events aren't very clear.  
---
If you do it the way the vid says you will get more legs with better drops than the wendigo. Last week I got three 3 star drops that I gave away to a lower level but the wendigo drops are ridiculous.
---
Appreciated but I did read some old threads that explained that when you can't auto scrap bulk it also can't be used freely for building or repairing. Makes sense I suppose when you think of it from a computer code standpoint. My ONLY thing is gimme some damn plastic back even only 1 per bulk. "50% of something is better than 100% of nothing"
---
Pop up campers are the worst. Source: 8 years as an rv tech.
---
Bloodied is typical glass canon build. High damage output but just a slight hit and you are done. Sometimes, counting amount of times I died, i just wonder is it worth playing. Wouldnt I be better taking full vanguard gear with sentinel weapon and nuke on vats anyway, without risk of being one shot by accident. In a big fights, where stealth is broken so easy, its almost an inevitable death in countless numbers.
---
Stay strong.
---
we’ll see they said they didnt wanna follow trends and rather do what they want. only other mode they’ve talked about working on is team deathmatch. 
---
and where can I find this you are referring to?im very intrested. 
---
I just wonder when that Team Deathmatch is coming that they’ve already mentioned if its not coming with Nuclear Winter.
---
Thanks for linking me the video. I honestly don't want my account back at this point. I love how he called me The Enthusiast.
---
I have earned it. I've earned it twice even. But I play 4 toons and fuck these rare ass badges.
---
Try to group up and use the Inspirational perk. Make sure you’re well rested and eat cranberry relish for bonus xp. Also Mama Dolce event in Morgantown for canned meat stew if you can’t make the relish.
---
Hahaha fair. I mean that happened plenty too along with server full and instant crash again
---
We will conquer this addiction together! ( while in Hannibal masks)
---
Ooh, thanks for the heads up. I'm horrid at PvP but I'll get it a go if I'm high enough level.
---
AGREED!
---
Imagine earning 4 backpad mods that cost 8 tokens a piece... Because that's where I am. I've earned two already, my third toon has 2 tokens. But I'm ***seriously*** burned out on it. Fuck this system, give those of us with multiple toons a break.
---
True, but you wouldn't be using PA for a Berserker build anyway. And how often does one change armor, once one gets their build set?
---
Well, it it wasn’t for VATS I’d never hit anything
---
The hardest one will be to claim lakeside cabins. Probably better off waiting a few days until you try it. That's what I'm doing
---
I honestly not sure what the logic is. This topic had come up several times, and this build is often cited, so I had it bookmarked for when I start my own big guns build.
---
Very cool. Nice build. :)
---
My F4 vault was... significantly less nice. XD
---
They can add a short quest that appears once players reach a certain level (30+) and the reward will be the plan for the vendor machine. That way players can have a better idea what to sell because they actually had played the game.
---
So kind of like this, only this is vault 76 at the time of fallout 4: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v01hoMrED-4
---
Very disingenuous with the buildings and clothes.  Sure theres a few atom store costumes from FO4, because they dont fit the lore of being in Appalachia in the first place, like grognak, silver shroud, Preston's duster.  But all the new responder and raider/skiing clothes are new.  All the enclave stuff.  All sorts of new masks, the wood armor set, the scout armor set, the excavator and ultracite armors.  
---
As for buildings, just look at the ski resorts, the white spring inside and out, the enclave bunker, a good amount of the buildings in watoga, bridges, charleston, even flatwoods has unique buildings.  The disposal site, the ranger cabins and lookout towers.  The red rocket megastop and the Galleria.  
---
Reusing some assets when making a game on the same engine, that was originally thought up as a multiplayer component for the original game, is going to happen.  That's why we have a similar arsenal with additions.  Same level of reuse happened with FONV, and it made people just as mad, but then FO4 came out so people followed the cycle of forgetting the previous flaws and loving the older game through jaded lenses.
---
Camp module skins would be good
---
Just remember, “pretty don’t stop bullets “
---
I like marine. It’s good all around and radiation resistance is decent
---
We should be able to delete cards and get points back from it. It let's people experiment with different builds on one character and moving special points require a level up. Pretty sure a lot of people have made mistakes on picking up a card at the beginning that wasn't good and learning how the card system works or finding out the card isn't all that good or is just flat out useless in this game compared to older games.
---
That’s an interesting idea. 
---
I’m no economist, but there needs to be some kinda cap-sink.
---
Lead and steel and a hella'va lotta wood
---
Make them and sell them! I'll buy one haha
---
I got a sentinels marine chest piece once and the repair cost was absurd.
---
I think I remember 7 screws being involved, maybe I’m wrong.
---
I could see that. There’s enough random sources or rads for it not to be limiting. Plus ghouls could carry toxic water/goo as an on-the-go source of rads. So they’d have a rad meter to replace the food and water meters. As for the chems. I imagine that all healing chems would have a 75% reduced effectiveness since Ghouls are perpetually decaying while combat chems would still be 50% effective.
---
Also that it's a pain in the ass, I don't want to do this challenge for all 5 of my characters! Would want to be able to craft them on one, then pass them between my dwellers!
---
I got a lot of XP killing them during the double XP weekends. I think it's like 600 XP normally or something crazy.
---
I DEFINITELY don't want to go through that mess. I'm all for it!
---
Or metal. But prefer raider
---
Yeah mine are sitting outside, so this is a really solid point. I'll have to rethink things. I think you have the right idea until they alter how these things work anyway (if they ever do)
---
If you're on PC, I'm down.
---
I'm keeping my fingers crossed that we get a patch for bugfixes tomorrow since memorial day pushed them back, even if it's unlikely. There are just so many glaring bugs that I can't believe it's taken this long to address them
---
I know where one is and I just might do that
---
What hat is that?
---
I’d pay 1k caps for it
---
I carry PA only for when I need the extra carry weight. Otherwise, I never use it. I’m at level 103 now, playing as a stealthy sniper with a shotgun for in close fighting.
---
I’ll try that next time but can’t say I’ve had brilliant experiences there
---
Yes. I got one badge from stings and things and it’s so easy to do daily with a stockpile of 4 of 5 parts that don’t spoil.
---
I have the plans I just need the junk
---
grafton steel yard workshop has steel and lead resources.
---
Hey guys n gals... there is a fast travel matt. Its shaped like the welcome home one. I used it last week in the ammo factory. I set it at the bottom of the stairs to the ammo machine.  When I fast traveled back that's where I spawned in.
---
I do feel like they made *badges* too hard to earn, but at least they gave us the option to sell *backpack mod plans* to each other. Just search the markets.
---
got attacked by a flatwoods monster and a gang of ads at the brotherhood fort when I was dropping off some technical data, a refreshing fight
---
Uranium Fever, AWOL Armaments are both good events for legendaries.
---
If your just looking for scrip, do Leader of the Pack in the forest (easy lvl 10 wolvies, 3 each event, one star) its a quick scrip run.
---
I have good luck with legendaries at Harpers Ferry too.
---
The Burrows have a few legendaries in it, so does Arktos Pharma (even when the event is not on)
---
Whitesprings and WestTek are still the best and easiest places to farm legendaries outside of the events.
---
And as always, SBQ, Paradise and Encryptid.
---
i prefer combat armor, i have a full set BOS with different effects
---
Yessssssss
---
Ah cool. The heavy perks don't start until level 35 so plenty of time to find what you're looking for. It might be worth using shotguns while levelling to get used to the range but I wouldn't bother getting any perks for them. Even if you don't use a harpoon as a main weapon they're a good secondary because of the ammo thing. Most heavy guns need a lot of ammo so it's good to have something you can use while farming that doesn't really require any resources, aside the occasional repair.
---
A better acid location is Toxic Larry's Meat 'n Go, where 3 Snallygasters always spawn, vs the 2 yao guais you'll get 99% of the time at the bed and breakfast. They also have a lot less health than yao guais, but they still hit pretty hard. You also don't have to travel a distance to find the Snallygasters as you spawn within 15 ft of them. Overall, you get more in less time. They also won't typically attack you until you start moving, so you can just wait while crouching until they load in and not have to worry about them hitting you (typically).
---
That the Old Fisherman's Hat :)
---
Not trying to be a smart Alec but every place is creepy considering you know everyone there will be dead. Especially the underground places and that feeling that like everyone there died not seeing daylight  one last time. I really find that music that goes Doo Doo Doo when your in some places.
---
Finished😀
---
still waiting on a fancy grognak axe skin
---
So something like leveling through ranks of trials and getting added legendary effects to your player in general. That could be interesting I wonder if that was going to be the case if it would be new legendary effects or just ones that are already in game
---
the cheapest mod plan i saw was 15k. per toon? no thx
---
