My work benches are clipping through the walls that didn't used to be there. It looks incredibly stupid.
---
---
---
I took my stealth perks off and switched in some other stuff. Enjoyed the daily ops fine. Jumped back into stealth when I was done. Needs some tinkering, but it’s viable to run a high health rifle build on ops.
---
Not at all bro!  When I first did it I thought I was on a public server... didn’t have my morning coffee so I had to do a test to see if I was crazy, nope, lost my shit.
---
That happened to me too, but that was last night before the update.
---
Exploding enemies can be completely negated with a dense chest piece and/or fireproof 3 perk. Theoretically it should be the easiest enemy mutation to deal with out of all of them.
---
I’d like to think I give credit where it’s due. I tip my hat to Bethesda on this.
---
Lol...well i guess my reply should be im sorry, please don't be, its not that bad, its not you..its me...lol
---
Oh I’m not upset far from it. Just their definition of matching could be more robust
---
The only reason you’re getting downvotes is cause these people are salty. The people bitching on day one won’t make it long
---
-me to my teammates during a daily op with Resilient modifier
---
Don't expect to go there with your usual build. You need to change it according to the mutations and enemies you will face. I do not use melee any melee but I centered my build around it   on my second and third play.
---
I tried it three times and only died in first one but only because I kept my E too long and instead of reviving ally with stimpack, I left my PA...
---

---
On second and third  try I finished it under 8 min with just us 2 players. Keep in mind to put charisma perks that benefit all players and do not forget to share them! Team medic is very good one to share.  I used my Excavator and was at around 40% HP at most (I used Cursed Pickaxe). I also equipped Born Survivor 2 star and Action Boy.
---
I just put up a foundation and wall. Flamethrowered it and merged the flamethrower into the wall. I also took a suitcase and merged it through a bed. Seems all to work as before.
---
Really don't think melee is dead, just not brokenly overpowered anymore
---
My melee is still 1 to 2 shooting 90% of mobs. Some take 3 hits but thats if they are level 100.
---
My biggest argument about the whole change is that they never removed "Hacked in weapons", "Magic Damage" and the Reload bug. 
---
So folk can still run around with TSE 50 cals that fire 50 mini nukes at once
---
Players can still use Limb damage reduction armour or limb damage % weapons 
---
and players can still load Black powder rifles and Dragons with 300 rounds from a plasma flamer. 
---
So the whole bosses dying in 1 second is still an issue. 
---
I'm Australian, it forces me to play with the Chinese and SEA playerbase, it's spread worse than the coronavirus.
---
I named mine Pew Pew cuz its an explosive junkies. XD
---
I personally solved the problem early on when the game was new by buying another copy from cdkey stores for 8e.
---
Man I didn't finish power levelling my last character either.
---
They actually are coming out with a new camp system that is more freeform Mark Tucker teased when we interview him during QuakeCon. It's going to be far more forgiving. Shelters that are coming with instances interiors is just a step in that direction. But they are actively working on it.
---
enojoying and being able to compleate daily ops is 2 different things my friend
---
Neither does actually applying it :~\
---
Ok on the upset.
---
But matching armor and matching effects are two different things
---
It’s only 1, so it takes half a level up to be able to remove it. Not ideal, but doable. What I didn’t have time to test is if the higher ranks take more to remove. If so that’s a bit much.
---
I run melee only and I’ve been fine
---
Smart, I guess that’s why dupers try all the old tricks on patch day, cuz ya never know what the hell will happen. Didn’t lose anything too great.
---
Agreed
---
JFFR Handmade and I'm an Army Vet I know what a Mag is.
---
Sir, did you read the whole thing? They say its “fixed” but not for all players. So...yeah, its still here
---
Can confirm this.
---
New char imo!
---
Same. Finally switched over to heavies.
---
Umm... have you played the game today?   I'd hold off on the whole melee dreams thing.
---
Don't make a new character, just use the one you have.
---
Yes the classic case of I’m “to busy bitching or trashing this game to actually put attention to what’s going on”
---
He’s now at the Berkeley springs station.
---
Kinda good on caps atm, but haven't done much shopping lately...any rare plans? (Otherwise a bunch of wood steal and lead may suffice )
---
I was thinking whilst getting pumbled in the daily op that weapons with bashing damage would probs be on the rise
---
Berkley springs station as far as i know
---
Huh, guess you can no longer break a table with a flamethrower trap and put a workbench inside it and then repair the table to make a proper aesthetic workbench.
---
Why not melee?
---
And I was worried it would be hard to get enough ammo to run a prime Gauss minigun when I unlocked it
---
Okay, fair enough.  But why did you say clip than?  Not that it's a big deal.
---
I bet they still randomly target merchants and C.A.M.P. items.
---
Great. I have a hunters death claw gauntlet that is beast. I’m scared to play tomorrow. I really enjoy this game.
---
I’m unyielding str build, used to be able to get my str to 70+, now I do half that damage.
---
Instigating still allows me to one-hit kill most enemies though.
---
Not today (insert funny ‘not today’ voice)....for me anyway.
---
Trying to finish the raiders vault raid and this is the 3rd time I'm going to have to attempt it as the NPCs don't further the story and just stand there. So annoying.
---
I just traded away my TS/E/15fr Radium Rifle for the full Responders fireman set(outfit and helm) if it's any indication of value. I'm bloodied and that gun definitely outperformed my B/25/25 Fixer. I would've kept it if it didn't keep killing me, lol. I do have 3 points in demolition expert. Amazing gun but this was before today's patch
---
That’s awesome.  I’m sure they will increase difficulty if most people are getting done under 8 min so I need to jump on these pronto lol
---
Pros: 
---
*There will be more legendary items worth keeping or selling. 
---
You will level up faster which means more perk card points
---
Cons:
---
Bullet sponge evrywhere
---
*Stashes will be full all the time which will push fallout 1st sales
---
Ammo is priority now especially for heavy gun users.
---
I placed two by error and wanted them to be removed. Hahaha, but I know the issue about the ghost space, so I used them to give free ammo to players.
---
I know many people place them, the thing is, do they removed the ghost budget you get from placing them?  I don't care re-building my camp because it was trash, but just wanted to know if they removed the budget the ammo factory takes.
---
It's gotten so bad that I was thrilled just to see that dumb clock in the update...
---
damage based on the gun's base damage now so for example if your rifle does 100 damage and you put on all rifleman cards it should go up to 160. now if you add bloody mess 3 (15% more damage) it should go up to 175 because it is 15% of 100 not 15% of 160 which would be 24 for a total of 184. the biggest impact is on build that use multiple damage boosts like a bloody build that may have all 3 rifleman cards, bloody mess, nerd rage, the bloody weapon effect, adrenal mutation, etc. so instead of those cards all building upon each other they now are all affected/working off the base damage of the gun. hopefully that helps.
---
Different body types have different mechanical advantages. If I had to take a wild guess, you've got long arms. It's the guys with barrel chests and little T-Rex arms that are always the monster benchers. Also, unless you're a powerlifter, your bench press max is kinda irrelevant compared to skills when it comes to sports.
---
Yeah everything is a "fixer" now on xbox. Luckily I only use two variants
---
Well, I had fun at least!
---
No argument there, but which do you feel is harder to farm and worthy of being augmented with further stats matching amor type or matching effects?
---
To me the investment versus return isn’t there when I compare my mixed unyielding with no poison or flame resist versus a crafted set of leather armor that gets it
---
Remember to always use super duper too!
---
I stumbled into a glitch months ago that essentially has made one of my 2 fat man’s unbreakable at the cost of never being able to repair the other. Time to launch mini nukes for days!
---
After some playing around it seems vats is not working as it was for me. Guns are fine manually aiming. Head shots on 60+ super mutants start in the upper 200s and climb from there.
---
What do you play on?
---
I feel bummed for you guys but the game plays relatively the same dishing and taking damage for me. I don't use legendary weapons or armor though.
---
I'm 237 and tried with a 60-ish dude earlier. Didn't even make it down the first pipe. I was smashing them down to 1% with my gauss shotty, but getting swapped to a melee in time, while they pound on me, hard to do. And they re-spawn fast, I was basically stuck in one spot killing the same mobs over and over. Mr. Level 60 wasn't much use and he bugged out a minute or two into it.
---
Need 4 players I think, at least one devoted melee tank, with the rest just pounding everything down to 1% while fists o' steel goes around on clean up. 
---
And you have to move, keep moving, or you just get bogged in re-spawns.
---
I just wish people would have joined my Ops team, we could have done it easy, with the right mix.
---
i agree, but it is fallout 76. the only conistent thing is the iconsistencies
---
I definitely get feeling that way. It take a lot of hours to optimize your character and build. I guess I'm just looking forward to having to think more about what I do in the game.
---
You can use melee. Bloodied melee isn't overpowered anymore, but I'm not complaining. I have instigating weapons also.
---
Cheers was the perk I picked here at level 54...sad thing is, I tried to do that quest with the kid looking for a stuffed rabbit and the server went off last night too before the update...two assaultrons!!  
---
Then the server died, and I had to come back today, now they are all leveled to fifty and I have no damn ammo so grabbed this perk now to find lead lol.
---
Melee is great in today's daily ops
---
No, the order in which you place the cards is irrelevant. No synergies from grouping if you mean this
---
How do you get the warglaive? It’s the new melee weapon with this update right?
---
Classic you moment!!!
---
 vampire sniper ? that seems not enjoyable no matter what you fight... what a weird choice
---
It's been doing this for a while. That is rubber-banding  run amok.
---
All is well! I’m up around the northeast myself, Nova Scotia to be exact! And man!! It seems like everyone wants to build a deck or a shed or whatever! All time lows for pressure treated and plywood stock is through the roof! Crazy times. Other than that, I’m 10/10, thanks for asking!
---
Ya I’m waiting to see myself too. I’m scared. Haven’t played it yet as I have to work.
---
Geeze, i've been gifting away my fixer plans to new team mates...
---
Just tried again, no dice. First time lost a bunch of 3 stars for scrip, this time glowing meat.
---
500 levels... on each character... i just got a guy past 200, no way in hell i'm getting 500 on him let alone the other guy i wanna do.
---
[removed]
---
then im happy for you
---
TSE &gt; AAE &gt; BE , bloodied is still really good and the best build over all unless you have TSE or AAE laying around.
---
Seems decent so far apart from the daily ops could do with better waypoint I got totally lost in the borrows just looking for the 1st beacon. Know this will change with time. Encrypted can do one now where the hell are these robots supposed to be hiding there were 3 of us turned up and over 50 robots at one time all max level. It didn't go well lol 😆. Maybe they need to look a scaling the amounts of enemies too. But other than that seem ok.
---
You just have to thrust the gun while you shoot to make the bullets go faster.
---
So the more you level worse your damage is?
---
Rare plan drops from daily ops rewards is what I’ve heard. Mods to it are alrdy sold by Rigs at the gold vault. Innovsurvivalist did a video on new items one them being the glaive
---
From the patch notes;
---
Enemy Mutations: 
---
Piercing Gaze: This mutation is always applied to enemies the “Uplink” Daily Ops mode, and gives them greatly enhanced perception of players. 
---
Volatile: Enemies will explode on death 
---
Active Camouflage: Enemies will be cloaked when not attacking 
---
Resilient: Enemies can only be killed by a melee attack 
---
Freezing Touch: Enemy attacks will freeze players 
---
#ranged weapon bash counts as melee
---

---
Went to the witch doctor and asked him for advice. Gave me a grognak's axe and told me how to slice. Resilient wasn't very nice, but now I knock them over with a toss of dice. And I say, oo eee, oo ah ah, ting tang, walla walla bing bang. Me strong man now. Robots stupid. Me super mutant.
---
It was a joke lol
---
It would be very odd for a game to be able to lock your whole Windows up.  It's hard to blame the game for that.  I'd start with making sure your video drivers are up to date, that feels like the most likely culprit.   "It was fine before" is ok logic, but it's more likely that the patch is triggering some underlying issue with your PC or drivers than the patch itself causing a complete Windows freeze.  If it was me, I'd make sure Win10 was up to date, make sure all drivers are up to date, uninstall mods, uninstall anything odd you've got going on, simplify simplify simplify.  Retry at each step.  And if all else fails, do a clean install of everything - i.e Windows and all, onto a spare drive.   sucks, but, given what you're saying, that's the approach I'd take.
---
Sorry, I hate it.  I am level 95 and now in order to go get lead for ammo I have to fight level 50 creatures instead of level 10.  So I burn up a ton of ammo killing them to get lead for ammo.
---
You pretty much have to wear power armor now? That sucks.
---
I feel the same, cant say I love all the new perks, but i do love a few, I haven't had to reset my perks all day. I'm leveling up faster, enemies are challenging again. Got killed 3 times during AWOL armaments (solo) that hasn't happened in a very long time. It makes ya scoot up in your chair and say ohhhhh ok looks like we got a challenge. Love that feeling. Well done. No complaints till meat week.
---
Same here i did about 5 times elder tier. No rare rewards while my friends got somthing on their 1 or 2nd try.
---
*makes a video about insufficient damage numbers* 
---
*walks in and two shots a level 75 3 star legendary enemy*
---
The thing I hate about the legendary perks is that I spent 1100 perk coins on new "Badass" perks but am still hitting for about 60% of my previous damage output.  With unarmed melee, not even close to that.  I added 15 perk points to my build and it feels weak as hell compared to before.  
---
It sort of feels like a slap in the face to have worked so hard leveling up over and over for many months saving points for something special, when it turns out to be less powerful than what I already had.  The only really good legendary perk seems to be ammo factory.
---
I agree about your other points though.
---
they still go brrrrr health go i'm melting i'm melting...
---
So sneak perk cards that gave me 3x damages are useless now?
---
Hi , dumb question but what is LFG ? And for daily ops  can you join a team already doing it like with earl , join help out and the server hop ? thanks
---
[deleted]
---
Hallelujah. Holy hallelujah.
---
If you're on PC i'd like to buy it for 3000 caps
---
I would have exactly zero problems with this update if the main menu came with a little toggle that read "Level Scaling - On/Off"
---
The Sandbox was really stale, the patch was needed even though my Junkies melee build took a big hit. No complaints. Now we need a nice UI patch and economy overhaul, and I'll be all smiles. 😁
---
molerats are right now the strongest enemies in the game
---
Honestly. I don’t farm. I find it ends up being frustrating and not as fun. 
---
I’ve got really great gear. Great weapons. There isn’t an event I haven’t been able to do. I think I have one unyielding.
---
3 ops, 1 elder, 2 rare rewards
---
I knew this would happen. Our list of viable builds has shrunk yet again. This isn’t an RPG anymore
---
Cuz chickens also do poop.
---
Not any more.
---
Guess this isnt like the gauntlet arcade game where you could destroy the nests of enemy spawns. But maybe that should have been implemented to a certain degree here, no?
---
Unless more than 15 days worth auto Complete!
---
You don't have to be playing on reset it can occur at any time!
---
Looking For Group. I believe theres a pop up you have to use but I haven't joined other people's daily ops yet
---
I was excited to try some future games that are coming out like cyberpunk and assassin's Creed Valhalla and even super Mario All-Stars so I appreciate fallout 76 for utterly murdering my build and giving me a chance to stop playing.
---
PS4
---
Not gonna build a good looking camp. Just place everything on the ground as it is. It cant even allow stuffs to be snapped nicely into the ground...
---
I did it solo and basically just avoided all the enemies, got into power armour and took out a few enemies while just using stimpacks to heal when needed
---
He sure is.  Beth could have at least remodeled the station for him...
---
Nocturnal Rolling Pin?
---
Just DM,d a link for discord for daily ops :)
---
It takes me like 6 hits to kill a ghoul with a power fist, why use that when I can use a gun with more damage and not get hit at the same time?
---
It’s a shame
---
I didnt read the vast majority of your post but my reply to the title would be..
---
I just got off my main.. a Full Health Non-Addicted Sneaky Vats-Crit Rifleman and other than getting high level mobs on my normal materials gathering routes it doesnt seem all that different to me.. 
---
I was worried that Id have to go out and get mob specific weapons.. Im not so concerned with that after a couple hours of play
---
GL
---
No but its harder to survive without it. Power armor has been surpass by regular armor for what now over a year? 
---
Imo it should be better defense wise. Your sacrifices legendary effects to be more tanky. Before the difference wasnt that much espically with SS armor.
---
If they're revising the whole system at some point, why even bother fixing the exploit. Why not let the server handle the small amounts of server lag that clipping object generates until the day the fix comes? Obviously they're fine with other things generating server lag that isn't camp related.
---
Just let folks toggle the level scaling. Or at least buff the sneak damage modifier back to x4.
---
Please, I don't need to be carried. These enemies get melted by my Gauss Minigun. Even the boss was tissue paper to me.
---
I just need an extra body or two for the Uplinks.
---
Thanks a bunch and thanks for not making an old man feel even older lol
---
No P-chan?
---
I think there is a guaranteed addictol spawn at the tattoo parlor where that nuka club is at. Under the cash register
---
Were you not sneaking or using the strength perk?
---
Hey did you read what I wrote ?? nope just glossed over it huh ?? point is they still messed up, Last time I checked a mess up is a mess up ??
---
Also note  that a melee should hit way higher than a ranged more risk. and lets not forget about firerate and swing speed...
---
This is literally the worst patch you've ever released. Fuck one wasteland. It's just as bad as ESO's attempt at doing the same thing. Forest area creatures should not be able to take down half my god damn health. And they shouldn't need to be hit multiple times if I'm a higher level then them. One hit kills damn it. Screw this level 50 crap.
---
You guys really know how to suck the fun out of your game...this is horrible and not fun at all.
---
I agree, I also tried making the same point. Bloody was the most popular pre patch by a mile. That wasn’t by coincidence!! The other builds were garbage and now they are dead
---
I also found out it stacks, I had +30 strength by going in and out of the animation for 10 minutes
---
my rifleman works?
---
My Junkie’s 50/15 hunting rifle is out damaging my AAE hunting on level 75 supermutants. So I call bullshit on AAE outdoing BE
---
Do NOT try to fight the resiliant bots with the dodgy perk, drained my AP so fast I wasn't able to hit them to finish them off lol
---
Such a great ammo farm though if you're not concerned about time. Feels like I'll never run out of .50 Ultracite now.
---
Part of stealth is going around things in high difficulty areas, or if you are grinding xp kiting a manageable number of spawns
---
This is the correct answer.
---
I seem to do fine with a Gauss rifle. Check my post if you want advice as a rifleman
---

---
No
---
Yeah, so do the commando perks that have been in the game since launch. It doesn't mean anything
---
Yeah honestly I didn't even know it existed until playing 76, also a side note and warning, that section is FULL of scammers so if you're doing a trade never go first
---
You're the problem. Nobody else.
---
Accept it.
---
The new Daily Ops missions can give the enemies special "mutations", one of them is "Resilient" which only allows enemies to be killed by melee attacks.
---
Hated every moment of it.  Going to avoid ops for now.  I’m stuck playing burrows with resilient Gutsy’s with no ability to sneak.  I’m a stealth build, so Daily Ops just isn’t worth it for me
---
Bloody, two shot and instigating commando/heavy gunner are the only viable builds left!
---
Have to agree...playing the PTS for a bit with different characters, found it to be hardest with levels 45- 80 until you get the right gear. But it is a wasteland....have to be aware of where you are now and not go romping into events like you are Michael Jordan playing ball against 7th graders. Lol
---
Previously automatic weapons weren't as necessary but were still the meta but now they feel required.
---
Food and drink is coming, but not in this patch. Steel dawn should be this year, but we do not have date yet. There is a new NPC at Atlas Observatory that is prepping for the BoS arrival.
---
Yeah, it’s fine. The game is still easy.
---
I don't sneak, all my armor give +1 str, full junkie build and using the strength perk maxed, power fist gives +1 str
---
Am I doing something wrong or is it supposed to be doing only 200 damage?
---
The Burrows are enough to turn me off any of the OPS. Damned place is practically a maze. I hate that place. It only serves to make me miss the "local map" feature of previous games.
---
The ones who are stubborn and ignorant are those who refuse to temporary change their builds for OPS Daily.
---
You are solo. Join a public team and when you go it gives the team an alert by your name that you are in daily ops, then wait a bit and hope your team shows up.
---
I tried alone and died really quick.
---
But you can still merge things though. The OP didnt try anything just started venting. Cant change a planted foundation but can still use other tricks to plant wherever. I honestly cant find anything that changed aside from the planter and ammo factory blueprint. I merged a flamethrower into a wall even lol. Put it in a doorway and changed it to a solid wall too. Im gonna keep trying to find some horrible change but not seeing any really.
---
I don't know , does it?
---
I heard it got nerfed to the point of unusable so I thought I'd check myself. Lever and hunting seem to be bad
---
Just remember, it’s not your money so why do you fucking care so much you had to make numerous posts about it? Like, for real, the dude just gave you a one sentence reply like three times you felt, apparently, duty-bound to reply as much of an, man, I dunno if I even have words for it, but yeah. This is a conversation you COULD have walked away from any time, instead of doubling down like anyone actually cares what you think of what other people choose to do with THEIR money. Jesus dude, get a life, take a walk, anything.

I haven't been a fan of the "One Wasteland" idea since it was announced and I'm less of a fan of it now.
---
I mean if you're someone who is like lvl 200+ or whatever and play this game constantly, have thousands upon thousands of rounds for every gun, unlimited stimpacks, etc, I mean good for you. Obviously you put a LOT of time into the game. But for those of us who don't, a change like this is not a positive. I LIKED going certain places where I knew there were lower level creatures and I could scavenge in peace and when I decided I wanted a challenge, I knew where I could go for that. Now everything is level 50+ for me and the game is a hell of a lot more of a chore than it was yesterday. I know I'm in the minority here, and that's fine. But for me personally this is not a positive change.
---
I think the only ones they have listed are what you can get. You scrap your extra or unused regular cards for points to upgrade the legendary. It costs more points the higher the star.
---
How will you defend yourself in an outfit? RIP...
---
I've been playing since day one. You're not missing anything except for another grind fest score board, you do less damage and enemies are to your level. I expect tons of down votes, but it's true.
---
Yep, stacks with Ammosmith, as you can see.
---
seems ok to me.. AFAIC the sky isnt falling in that regard..

using a little more ammo and my gear is getting wrecked constantly now.. but I can kill mobs with ease

just hope they continue listening and this isn't a one off. hope fo76 goes the same direction as eso, just constantly improving. here's hoping
---
Are you guys seriously downvoting those of us who disagree with your takes on Daily Ops?  Really that petty?  Us stealth builds can’t play Daily Ops as Bethesda broke stealth with this update.  So he ain’t wrong that it isn’t simple or fun for stealth builds.  Bethesda wiffed in a big way in my opinion
---
Where do you see clip?
---
Its angry turtle so he probably tested on heavies
---
Yea. I ended up buying just standard forest armor for the pieces that didn't match and ended up getting the bonus. So, yeah forest and urban are separate. I even tried painting them all ass ghillie and still no bonus
---
Or a way to redo legendary perks lmao
---
Appreciate the heads up very decent , game name same as on here friend me if you like  , always happy to have good people👍
---
Yes thank you for this
---
Same. I manually renamed them back.😂

**Fixed an issue with the Vault-Tec Duffel Bag model that made it difficult to interact with.**
---
THANK YOU OH MY GOD
---
My main shotty is a double barrel so I go through a lot less than others but I generally keep at least 1500 on me.
---
Thanks to addiction I have 1 agility, but having to rely on something like that proves how weak it is
---
My quad hunting rifle is doing 194 damage. What gun are you using?
---
Yet the most common response to PVP players using workshops as intended is go play hide and seek in Nuclear Winter. SMH
---
But your point is invalidated, damage resistance will alter damage received. That's kinda the point of DR for both you and the enemy.
---
I hate this update more than any update released. I feel your pain stealth 3x damage more like 0.1x damage. Why dont i just throw a pebble at em. 
---
Also fire axe use to kill scorched like a knife to butter now i have to hit them like 8 times at least when the scorched were level 40 and i was 30 they didnt feel impossible cause the entire group wasnt 40 it was just the legendary at 40 while the stragglers following him were like 28 to 38. 
---
I waited 2 weeks for the new season and i doubt ill even play past 1 level when super mutants can kill me in 3 hits at level 30. My questing days are completely over cause i simply cant carry enough stimpacks on me since my character build was more towards crafting. Now i have to start over and hope a dps only class will allow me to even travel 1 mile from camp in any direction.
---
There is no lvl cap so just use same character
---
The game is trash now i said it before and got flamed. All builds are useless. People dont have 20 mins and take ammo to waste on a queen. Shits gotta change.
---
You can use the ones in the gym in vault 51 but currently don't get any advantage. I expect they'll be rolling them out over time. I'm just trying to figure out what's going to be scrapped to make camp space for the weight bench. Probably taking things off displays.
---
I wouldn't say useless. It can still mean the difference between one or two hits to kill an enemy from stealth. But its definitely reduced in effectiveness.
---
Ive been impressed with them recently. Fingers crossed they keep it up.
---
If you don’t know, targeting assaultrons in the leg brings them down super quick
---
If it is all private servers hopefully it'll be fixed in the inevitable hot fix that'll have this week
---
Try Campfire Tales. Now it's nonstop waves of level 50 bloodbugs. And they have the gall to keep listing it as "easy."
---
Completely completely completely legitimately unfun. *hovers over uninstall button*
---
My junkie heavy gun builds still been shredding not as much but it's not a big difference. Maybe I got lucky.
---
Agility for foosball and perception for the shooting gallery would be my guess
---
The group leader should at least be able to kick them?
---
Yea sneak perks are slaughtered in this now. Disappointing, time to change builds for a lot of us.
---
Are the mobs still bullet sponges?
---
I'm playing with a level 13 character and it's harder.
---
I use to be able to one tap my way like John Wick through Morgantown. Now I have to treat it like I'm in an area where the enemies are 10 levels higher than I am.
---
I could engage like 4-6 at a time before and now I have to bring it down to 2-3 otherwise I get overrun.
---
It's workable and I don't know if the XP rewards make up for that but there's no such thing as going to a low level to chill and farm junk anymore.
---
It all requires SOME effort now. Perfectly doable but you can't switch off your brain anymore.
---
*\[cackles in Zealot's/Crippling/+15% reload speed Dragon\]*
---
Yeah it sucks for you lot as the majority of people in nw will just want the daily
---
Damn, enjoy it while it lasts lol.
---
I just misread it, I'm dumb, sorry.
---
So a naked appearing enemy or ghoul as in the game setting with by its own lore basically states they are mad rabid creatures ?? had the foresight to put on  armor ?is that way you are saying?? you do realize how that sounds right ?..
---
So point still stands. again this was about correctly adding the figures otherwise those perk cards are pointless and need to be removed from game.
---
I run AA fixer and haven’t noticed
---
it means it's about time they released it already.
---
They *"should"* level to you (so 25-35 if your 30)
---
I'll take two!
---
CP started earlier so I went to join a group and there were six Daily Ops and nothing else. Each had one or two people.
---
Me too. Might be user error on ops side.
---
I run AA fixer and melee and haven’t noticed anything
---
lmao chill
---
......and, it's not fixed :(
---
c'mon!
---
I do have it, I’ve played the game off and on since beta and just finally tried the subscription it this month. I would play without it for as long as you can, the scrap box is the main upside and until your stash is consistently full I don’t think it’s worth the money. I might feel differently if I had lots of friends who played to use the private servers more. As it is I only use them when I have a long period of time and want to focus on a quest and not do events, which benefit from having others help.
---
I'm doing my first right now. The stealth mechanics in this game are kinda shit, but trying to see what I can do. Would be faster with a team killing, but I'm irritated at how the melee crap works and I didn't bring my troubleshooter armor.
---
Yeah I did the op as commando, that resilience thing was rough
---
I can't even freaking wander the forest in peace now, level 50s every where.. bummer really. 
---
Rip all my low power forest weapons. Such a shame to us high level players.
---
AA is still a beast for fixer, especially with the new ranged sneak legendary perk
---
AGAIN WITH CAPS !!!
---
"mate by doing things such as these its like saying I need attention and I feel like I'm dealing with one of my children"
---
Radscorps are now T-800’s and grafton monsters are T-1000’s we noticed.  So against AI, yes, players no.
---
News flash, you have always had to rely on sneak for both commando and meelee. Also due to this AMAZING update you can get sneak perks for FREE! Agility legendary perk lets you get 5 free slots for perk cards. You're addictions dont even effect how many perks you can slot
---
There's a daily ops public team. When you start the op people get alerted and asked if they want to join you. Try starting it.
---
The point of getting to a higher level is to not have to have everything be a chore to kill. You fight through that annoyance to get to a funner game where things are easier. 
---
Now it doesn’t matter how much work you put in, you’re always going to be a level 20 like character having to try too hard to to kill everything. 
---
Don’t get the point.
---
Right. Oh no, now my Vamp Marksman’s shotgun takes 3-4 bullets to kill an enemy instead of one. Jesus Wept.
---
I run AA fixer and melee and they’re still beasts
---
Supposedly he had eyes in the back of his head! 
---
  
---
hehe
---
instigating hunting rifle and furious lever mainly.. I didnt even really look at the numbers in pip boy
---
I was just going by feel and onscreen damage numbers.. when all my shit procs Im probably down like 150-200 damage Im guessing.. 
---
-eta
---
in the 800-1k range on average im thinking
---
Yeah. The whole damage nerf thing for all but a few cases was a storm in a tea cup. Not that big of a deal overall. 
---
Melee got hit harder than most but hopefully Bethesda won't drag their feet about balancing that. Hopefully within a month and not 3-4 months.
---
all enemies have DR, always have, even it older fallouts. It's just part of how the game makes its damage calculations.
---
You're not accounting for that. The perks are doing exactly what they're supposed to do.
---
Played a little today, and didn't even realize it was free now! 
---
I can actually use my tent for more than just a dedicated location, yay!
---
My 2h junky 1 hits lvl 100 super mutants with a power attack and 2 hits without.
---
If you use Ammo.Factory AND Ammosmith for Ultracite Fusion Cores and Plasma Cores, you get 9 total for the cost of 2 regular ones and the other resources it needs to make them.
---
Haha! That's a damn good point...I can't roleplay my way out of the Daily Ops robots can I
---
Server hop, check teams list.
---
Why can’t I be a strong person like you? 😂
---
I have a dozen the fixer now. Makes it easy to get the one I need when I need it lol.
---
So you're saying that if you complete it on elder and don't get a rare reward your SOL?
---
Definitely fuck this resource-intensive bulshit this is not the game I signed up for
---
that many shots from a bolt rifle to kill enemies is ridiculous. riflemen need an actual high powered option.
---
Pls papa, we are hungry, we need more attention than this reddit post
---
As someone who doesn’t use damage specific perks because they don’t fit into my play style; yes I’m having a hard time now and it really sucks. I shouldn’t have to be forced to use damage perks just to get anywhere.
---
I don't think so because a level 10 joining the queen fight is still going to get destroyed lol
---
However I’ve been enjoying it already because it means I don’t have to head back to the same 4 places to grind levels .... I can go anywhere on the map and explore areas again I haven’t been to in a while.  Because there will be reasonable enemies for me to kill.
---
So worth getting!
---
Looks nice in my garage too.
---
So true
---
Not exactly. The cost is a couple coins. Also, I don't know about having more legendary perks than slots.
---
So if I flick you, you will die, no, you have natural DR.
---
Exactly, and it is very difficult to tell which of those groups are still looking for people to do daily ops versus which of those people have already done it and are simply doing other things or afk.
---
You'll have to prime it for ammo crafting efficiency then you'll just have to find a way to keep stocked on stable flux 😅
---
See you made sense Thank you for that, however My point is they messed up the DR or dmg as I stated, Meaning something didn't scale correctly when new system was put into place.
---
Hasn't been data-mined yet so probably not? There is a black devil (FO3 and 4 enclave power armor) skin coming soon though
---
nay you are still low enough to have time to change your build.
---
To give you an idea of the scope of today's nerf to melee, I usually hit for around 7K with a vampire's power fist to the head.  Now it does 800.
---
That's a hell of a nerf.  I don't see how low level players will cope with such a drastic cut.
---
For me it's a mixed bag. Like you're right about the ammo thing but now all legendaries scale to max if you're above 50, so considerably more options for legend farming.
---
I think it's just growing pains since we're not used to the current system. Give it time and I'm sure people will find some way to cheese it again.
---
Trust me it wasn't only consoles. My frame counter read 7 during my first ACP. It was rough. Someone managed to make the entire forest run at 30 fps too. Like, the entire forest region of the map. I can handle 30 fps, but how the fuck do you half the frame rate of like 1/8th of the map? I was lost for words. Glad they've fixed it though
---
Here's hoping! Good luck! :)
---
Try crafting one.
---
It used to be a higher damage and vampire effect version of an assautron blade. Maybe you can get more effects?
---
Canned meat soup 4 life
---
Gathering Flux sucks though :(
---
I need to see testing before I believe TSE is better for all weapons. I have a TSE laser and the spread is still huge compared to my QE laser.
---
Nah I don't play the dumpster fire we know as Nuclear Winter not even for the SCORE. I do however enjoy the unicorn that is salt and cheese free PVP in adventure rare as it may be.
---
What you mean by this?
---
*extremely heavy breathing*
---
Yeah...except every you tuber and player on the PTS posted here saying it wasn’t a “nerf”. eNeMiEs OnLy nEeD a FeW mOrE bUlLeTs. I’ve been complaining how this is only a nerf and how bloodied takes a huge hit so does every single other weapon class. But no I get downvoted because “Bethesda knows best”
---
To be fair a mirelurk queen has a lot of health and I wasn't bloodied. Yeah, I feel like they should buff the lever action, hunting rifle and gauss rifle among other semi auto rifles.
---
Lol, that’s sad
---
No. Use bandolier like the rest of us. FO1st is already pay-to-win with the scrap box which is a complete game-changer. You don’t need this also.
---
Yeah I keep making a team for it. No one joins.
---
ah true, i wasnt sure if like the damage was somehow scaled aswell or not
---
There was a time when you got random cards from packs that you already have and had no possibility to rank it up (any more), then that cards got just deleted - 2 coins poof.
---
This is no longer, but you still have to open each pack and scrap the cards manually. And there is no more magic how you scrap them, every star is 2 coins.
---
Don't worry the stick has nothing but short ends. Went through over a hundred shotgun rounds in a run through Betsy just to see what the patch did....I am very casual and don't have time to scrounge up that many rounds....the didnt increase the rounds on enemies or make the guns last longer so of course my gun broke three times faster.
---
He actually says "[I think I'll order a Tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siaxGjttoVM)", which is a reference that goes over most people's heads. [Tab was a brand of soda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab_\(drink\)). 
---
I only know this because my parents explained it to me when that episode was new, so I'm not surprised people miss it.
---
I was thinking that this item should boost strength from the beginning. I fucking love this.
---
Damage
---
Per
---
Second.
---
Lol, I think I finally settled on a mixture of awe and envy. I you hope enjoy the items. Sucks you don't get more time to play 76.
---
Dont listen to this guy, with the right perks and maybe a slightly better weapon unarmed is still perfectly viable.
---
The team leaders didn't even change group goal when they joined CP. Just a combo of people being dumb and Bethesda not explaining anything. I doubt a lot of people even know Group goals can be changed on the fly.
---
Does it get Murica propaganda like the Communist one?
---
If you insist on going the new weapon route, new character. That way you won't lose perk cards you'll very much need for legendary perks later on.
---
It gives you +2 STR for 30 minutes.
---
Headshot crits? Seems like these criticals have become more important
---
The flicking me part I'm unsure I'm rather old and fragile depends on the day but meh I've lived go for it.
---
Again you missing my point I'm am simply stating that something did not scale properly. DO you have access to the code no, neither do I. not stating as such but I can make a fairly good guess stuff isn't scaling how it should even with the new system in place.
---
the level scales with the person
---
It was only certain items available with Bullion. Not sure the door was one of them.
---
My TSE fixer does more damage then my bloodied explosive fixer. It wrecks
---
I’m on Xbox sorry 😐
---
That happened to me before the update actually.. After I went below the clip size I was able to reload normally and now all is back to normal.
---
I run a furious and a bloody .50cal and I have 40k ammo for them as it is, this is gonna make me hit 100k ammo for them within a week 😂😂😂 .50cal ammo was already so easy to make huge amounts of
---
.308 definitely needed the boost without a doubt though. I can't use either of my Lmg's cause I can't justify the ammo cost
---
I’m doing just fine with my lever action?
---
I would give my left but t have it back
---
It's all about where in the formula enemy DR is taken into account.
---
I'm not positive, but I believe it goes base DMG minus enemy DR, then that result is then adjusted with whatever modifiers you have applied (ie stealth bonuses and the ninja perk(
---
I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure that's how someone explained it to me before
---
I hate almost any type of physical labor and there are strong people like you who do it for a living. It makes me feel like I’m a weak person. That’s all. 😊
---
I just renamed my to Zzz Bloodied The Fixer so it stays at the bottom of my list.
---
It's a concern that's sometimes brought up when people are presented with a large patch. There's nothing here to indicate that it's a joke instead of just another person with that misconception. I'm not saying you didn't intend it as a joke, just that there's nothing to indicate it should be taken as such, instead of as another person voicing this concern.
---
no but let me double check
---
Base damage isn't 316. That 316 was made up of the actual base number with a bunch of buffs stacked on it.
---
If you truly care about math rather than just have an excuse to whinge, remove all your perk cards and disable any buffs where you can (full strength rad-x/radaway will work for mutation). That's your actual base damage. then add the +200% of that base damage (x3) along with all the other buffs individually and then add them up.
---
I'd be willing to bet you end up with a number closer to 487 than 948.
---
I had to turn my mods off. If you have any running that might be the cause also.
---
That's exactly my point. I feel for you my friend.
---
With that damage you will still be 1 or 2 shotting nearly everything. So all you really lost is a ton of overkill damage that you never needed but just inflated your ego seeing those big numbers. 
---
My 2h melee still can ohk lvl 100 support mutants with a pa or 2 shot without.  Seems fine to me.
---
What if I'd rather not use one? What if I want my build to work with bows, sniper rifles and revolvers? These things were tricky before but now it seems downright impossible to manage. This is kinda the problem I was trying to talk about, the update is forcing many builds and weapons into nerf limbo and that is not a good thing just from a game design perspective and certainly from a player fun perspective.
---
Yup, insane amounts of xp
---
even if people just grab enough for rank 1. 
---
It's like 1 minute of your precious xp gathering time
---
They aren't that hard my team had to guys in power armor with heavies tanking and then two others with melees finishing the enemy's off we were done in about 6 mins on our second try
---
Ohh interesting. Which ones do you have equipped?
---
I think it's too early to call. People need time to properly test this shit out.
---
It's a shame, too. Just as I was getting back into it they drop this mess into our laps.
---
Think I'm gonna let this game rest for a while.
---
Limited by bullion of course
---
An ammo
---
True, but what about the guy who is doing 18?  That was my point.
---
And Sneak attacks in VATS seemingly don't work at all anymore
---
To get the dps, multiply the damage by the rate of fire. That is the number that matters.
---
What platform you on?
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
*sigh* Would it help if I leveled a toon with no mutations or perk cards and showed you the same result would you accept that maybe I'm right then just maybe ?
---
If so fine I'll do it.
---
Good to know. Not that it’s a big deal for me, but seems like it could be highly exploitable
---
Yeah thats so damn annoying.
---
Vamp bashing minigun is what I used. Had a blast. Just wish I knew the burrows a bit better since I haven’t spent much time in there.
---
The same ppl who one shot legendaries at uranium fever might fail to learn gun bashing here
---
They really messed up bloody builds, Bethesda has taken our time and has thrown it in the garbage. THE GRIND FOR THE ARMOR, THE GRIND FOR THE WEAPONS, AND THE GRIND FOR THE PERKS. ALL GONE BECAUSE BETHESDA WANT TO USE ADDITION I SAY, THEY CAN “BITE MY SHINY METAL ASS”!
---
shouldn't have died then
---
They needed more level variety on mobs and level scaling on legendaries. They gave a blanket scale and nerf. Progression is pointless
---
even non bloodied. I don't see the point in bolt rifles if you can't even one shot enemies. I mean, the difference between a .50 hunting rifle and an automatic handmade is minimal. there's literally no point.
---
bolt rifles should ignore most armor. having the anti materiel one from NV back would also be great.
---
Damage likelyndoes scale, but the level recommendation probably shows the lowest level the boss (queen in this example) could spawn at, so a lvl 10 would get owned by a lvl 50 queen
---
Hmm, that's good then. I was hearing something different from other sources including the pts. Mind telling me what type of lever it is ? Or how your build is?
---
You sound like a terrible manager is all I’m gonna say.
---
My god why??? You've just wasted those atoms.
---
Rather than spend them upfront, why did you not hold onto them and spend them to unlock the last 25 levels of the run? You know, the 25 hardest ones to complete due to the higher score requirements?
---
I see you buying a lot more atoms in future because of this unwise choice.
---
Before the patch my Bloodied Pipe Revolver Rifle had 721 damage (sneak headshot did 3.5k damage), after the patch this was down to 266 damage. This -63% damage does not make it worth playing DPS wise with such a low firerate, so I just went for a Fixer and Commando perks. Its okay, but the ammo consumption is really high.
---
not this early in the game when its so easy to rank up.. 
---
ill do the last 2 or 3 levels.. thats about it
---
Bashing is heavy metal
---
I know that nobody's going to cry for me but I spent over a month getting unyielding secret service armor and now I feel like that was a waste of time. The enemies are harder so I die all the time.
---
What nobody uses one handed melee did I read that correctly?
---
Man I’m currently playing on a 27” tv. I honestly cannot read 75% of the text in the game.
---
What
---
Yeah I enjoyed it for the time I had it!
---
Okay this sounds like a build issue, what level are you and are you perked out to do damage? I’m not talking bloodied or junkies but a vanilla build. It still needs to be set up in an advantageous way, and sometimes at the expense of carry weight
---
&gt;I also want to know why we get taxed!!
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_sink
---
On the PS4, whenever it acts funny you need to rebuild the database. this is a maintenance procedure akin to doing a disc defrag. In fact it's described as doing a disc defrag in the older Sony documentation among other things.
---
Turn your PS4 all the way off.
---
press and hold the power button until it beeps and then beeps again.
---
Plug in your dualshock controller and turn it on.
---
Select menu item 5 "rebuild database"
---
It will warn you that this can take several hours, but in practice it takes about 4 minutes most of the time.
---
I do this whenever I get one or two major patches for any program, or whenever I get strange errors. Particularly texture loading errors. And particularly texter or loading errors in this game.
---
The only annoying side effect is that you'll get your first time user messages in your notice bar. There's seven of them. You'll get six all at once the next time you log in. You'll get the seventh one after you play your first game. But who cares.
---
The procedure defrags your hard drive if necessary, making all the files contiguous. It also checks all sorts of internal settings and stuff.
---
The file system on the hard drive is basically a linked list, and the more fragmented your hard drive is the more entries it has to go through. That can slow down loading times. That can cause game drops and bad data mapping and all sorts of stuff after you've done a few patches.
---
If your PS4 is old, as in has had a lot of games come and go, and you've never done a rebuild database before a Canon deed take a while.
---
and this has been going on since the PS3 or maybe even the PS2. Just whenever they invented that particular file system.
---
this game in particular seems to have very tight timing schedules for having certain video resources available, particularly when things spawn in. And it's particularly aggressive if you've got a PS4 pro and super sampling enabled.
---
I also ended up buying a SSD for my PS4 probecause it improves performance in so many ways and so many different games.
---
Rebuild database? Just do it!
---
Hey, I'm reading this as I'm sat in a bush.
---
I did one daily op and got elder and it completed all 3 of the weekly challenge, it's probably to do with the daily op reward tiers.
---
I ran it at level 17 and it took forever lol
---
I was doing a stealth archer. Now I’m never not in danger and it takes a good 5 shots to kill anything (with the 4 second reload) I was loving it, now it’s shit.
---
Stingwings attack is brutal at level 30 I don't want to see it at level 68+
---
Can you give a lil more precision ?
---
[Edit:] I mean it would be easier to help you if we actually knew what kind for challenge you are facing. Every encounter cost you all your ammo and stimpaks ? And where are you questing exectly !?
---
shotgun builds seem to be doing good. admittedly I use a magic shotgun but I'm still doing a lot of damage. although my one shots have turned into two or three shots a lot of the time I ain't complaining, I enjoy the challenge
---
I have the perk load out one which I think is the cause of it. Also one that displays weights in the pipboy and a glowing meat pile one. Ill try figuring out ones I can still use tomorrow and then pray the broken one gets fixed quick.
---
TSE is where it's at. Both bullets are getting the explosive damage and with the new patch. Explosive perk on gun is still multiplayied and not added.
---
They are old enough to feed themselves...
---
Jconley123....its not the fancy just had to redo everything to fit in the brotherhood bunker
---
It’s not cheating.
---
News flash, I have 1 agility so they can spot me instantly, also before this change melee was better with sneak but was already good without it, melee or commando never 'needed' sneak
---
Wait, what? If I switch to a melee weapon, I can chuck grenades at resistant Handies? Hey now...
---
Just want my one freebie per day, part of my morning ritual now, putting notes in to rest the timer, this garaunteed you had at least 3 notes...
---
My bloodied Gauss rifle was doing about 1000+, now it is 663. I'm using more head shots , critical shots and charging more often. There are perks that can solve the ammo problem like ammo smith and ammo factory.
---
He said a couple dozen times...... lol
---
lets hope for his sake that he misspoke
---
So you didn’t gather any either until the last minute? Sounds like you’re part of the problem.
---
Are we talking the poison resist with matching set, fire resist with matching set etc? Or something entirely different?
---
Yeah but I’ve already bought everything I want, now I just always need more XP for perk coins
---
You do whatever you feel you need to do bud. Just show your working when you do.
---
It could well be that there is a calculation bug. You've just done a poor job of making your case with an obviously flawed example.
---
I always buy 4000 atoms a week then my 1000+for 1st
---
[https://nukacrypt.com/php/home.php](https://nukacrypt.com/php/home.php)
---
You're right. Bethesda said they did this whole damage change to better balance weapons, we will have to see if they balance them or not
---
I'm thinking we're all going to be wanting to have daily ops sets or armor for damage reduction, like a full set of troubleshooters, a full set of mutant slayers etc...
---
Radiation Rumble in a nutshell: 1 person gets ore and everyone else stands around watching workers die.
---
Thanks I’ll try it out, my ps4 is quite old around 5 years
---
I joined in late.  The event was one minute left
---
You probably still got rewards for completing the event. Its not hard to keep track of earles health and stay in a safe place. This isnt new to this patch. Earle barely gives loot anyway, stop bitchin
---
It was always like that, even pre patch
---
The hunting rifle, lever action, semi bolt weapons and gauss rifle should have their damage doubled.
---
Platform? Have ran 4 times with no issues. 3 on a team for one run, full teams for the other runs.
---
Edit: I'm Xbox
---
reset is in 23 minutes, so give it a sec to update if you are close to the hour
---
It does. I solo'd and got elder first try. May just be bugged for that run through.
---
Check the video... it is short. https://youtu.be/wnv0Gb0H9tk
---
In the same bout here too, I also work at a timber yard and have to wait till I get off work to play. Only six more hours till I get of work :(
---
Oh you poor fellow.
---
Please do me a solid and at least wait until the final week of the run to buy up the rest. I hate to see good atoms go to waste.
---
So shoot them down until they are at 1% health then just bash them. Or have a team where some shoot, and some finish them off. They aren't legendary, so they do not recover health. Once you got them to 1% they just stay that way. Have the melee guy just pick them off. Only the final blow needs to be melee.
---
Yes. Rare rewards only **have a chance** to drop if you get Initiate (5% chance), Paladin (10%) or Elder (80%) rank.
---
If you've already gotten all the ranks, you've "used" all your chances to get a rare reward until next day.
---
Glad to hear she can be crippled again. Rewards are better on sbq than Earle. So people will nuke her more often anyways. Also it really will make a difference when more people realize you nuke Earle once, then the other 2 nukes hit the queen and activate Earle again anyways.
---
I went with the one that removes rads over time, to counter the rads you get constantly for doing anything.
---
My thoughts exactly! I’ve been trying to get my hands on troubleshooter’s, mutant slayer’s and even assassin’s (bc apparently now it works with damage from human NPCs, thankfully) armor pieces and sets but sadly so many people just feed it to the scrip machine ;(
---
Exploration only from what I understand.
---
I am casual AF so i have no idea what that means
---
I believe it is a daily op location.
---
Take in the lore and story that place has to offer at your own pace.
---
You can't sneak during Daily Ops
---
It's based on base weapon damage.
---
That's the true base, before mods or str.
---
Dang. Interested to see what happens there.
---
How would you rate a full health build?
---
Damn, I wanted a boss fight
---
What instructions? I didn't see shit. I joined in after someone already started apparently. I only figured it out because I remembered a reddit post.
---
It’s up to you if you have a good bloodied build and with weapons and armor you’ll still be dominating things out there
---
Is it even a question? Ammo factory is a no-brainer choice.
---
I really disagree. Are you saying that 3 times damage isn't significant? Youd be surprised how far you can go with the sneak perks and 6 AGI
---
They should make them available in  combat shotguns too
---
The 3 indicates they have 3 available for sale 😅
---
Yeah, that sounds like what Bethesda would price this at.
---
Don't forget Super Duper that basically has a 1/3 to get 1,800 ammo.
---
lvl 44 here same bro it sucks
---
I don't wear power armor guide probably at least 20 times and then it was so exciting and fun to just shoot the end boss with a plasma Gatling while it was stuck behind some Machinery unable to hit me. Really cool X loved it. Fuck this game.
---
There’s a lot of str perks that go with an unarmed build...
---
Ouch is Warren Buffett included?
---
I didn't, but with the new level scaling, their eye beam melts me in less than a second. It's hard to get a chance to get leg shots in.
---
I'll give it a shot, but right now ammo is tight and everything seems to take 80% more ammo to kill.
---
it'll get easier
---
I found one somewhere
---
I play a shotty/rifle build and shotguns are still solid. The two solutions I'm considering are trying the gauss rifle and if that doesn't work out I'm going commando.
---
Funny
---
Ah, Bloddied is where a ledgendary affect where Your weapons do more damage the lower your health and the way I can keep it at that health below 20% without overdoing it with stims is Radation
---
Had the same heart palpitations when I looked for my fixers at first!
---
For thr damage, the reduction is the result of the damage recalculation they did with changing the damage modifiers from multiplicative to additive. Not sure why the damage was unchanged with the perk card on or off
---
I thought the lol covered it. My bad and no worries.
---
Put it this way...I would say I had one of the top strongest build. Bloodied commando handmade and fixer build, unyielding. I was doing 300 dmg a shot and to glowing enemies ~1200 a shot. I’m now doing 78 damage a shot to regular enemies and 140 to Glowing. That’s a 70+% nerf. Now obviously that is a niche case cuz not everyone had the same build. But basically anyone would had a “good build” or mediocre build from casual play is suffering like crazy cuz they are doing shit damage now.
---
I run AAe commando and I honestly haven't noticed a difference
---
I avoid silos and nukes because I hate to be annoyed by gutsies and their gangbanging attitude. So, I did not enjoy my first daily ops event. Not. At. All. 
---
Also, I hate the fact of stealth being useless. Most commando builds, ninjas and that are crafted to use stealth as a weapon itself. This event screams for Power Armor or a full set of troubleshooters. 
---
Lots of builds become useless and that's silly. I don't want to move points into the only viable builds and weapons.
---
So I have a symbol under my stamina, it’s red with a gun
---
Admittedly it was rough, trying to get that close to a raging assualtron with a hard on for murder does seem like a terrible idea, but me and a buddy managed it after two attempts. Gotta say, without speed demon we wouldn't have made it though. Absolute life saver when trying to speedrun the ops
---
That means your gun is gonna break soon
---
I play this game for the stories and this ain't them. I guess it's time to find something else to play.
---
Yea...Sorry.
---
No it doesn’t, super duper only works on the base amount so you have a 1/3 chance to get 1100 ammo
---
Damn, that sucks. My main sniper rifle is just a level 40 non-legendary hunting rifle and does 114.  
---
My opener is a level 35 Dragon and it's base is 280.  
---
I do have a level 50 3-Star Exploding Pipe Rifle that has a base 51 that sounds fun.
---
Actually he was often the victim of dirty hits. Until the NHL. In the NHL he had 2 of the most feared enforcers ever to protect him. Marty Macsorley and Dave Semenko. When he got traded to L.A his enforcer got traded with him. When Gretzky was a kid, an opposing coach offered 1$ to his team for every hit on Gretzky...one player got 50 cents. Gretzky had amazing peripheral vision and was one of the best at avoiding hits also...what an amazing player he was🙌🏻
---
If you’re a PA user then electric absorption all the way. It has a second effect which isn’t stated where when it triggers you also get health regen. Makes the daily op stupid easy, an assaultron beam to the face is nothing.
---
Sounds like your plan will work for you.
---
I spaced it out between perks
---
I was on death number 19 by the time I got there, doing it alone with a sneaky sniper build. I jumped on top of something and got lucky, the boss dude was on the other side and it could shoot at me but I kept missing and when it used its laser it hit me but it wasn't that bad. Long story short I sat there and plinked it's right arm for 10 minutes until it was dead.
---
Is that the one that destroys SBQ in like 3 seconds? Cus those builds need to be nerved hard
---
Any idea how many rounds are in the maxed out plasma?
---
The higher level enemies definitely require more ammo and chems. I’m sure younger characters will struggle to keep pace until they can reach the higher levels
---
Only fire.
---
That’s a nice sentiment, but they’re the same in Fallout 4, which is the opposite bookend of the timeline as of 2020.
---
It means he's intentionally irradiated his toon to lower its health to just under 20%.
---
It triggers the Nerd Rage and Serendipity perks, the Adrenal Reaction mutation, and makes "Bloodied" legendary weapons do insane damage.
---
is isnt meta but I enjoy it.. YMMV
---
I can't wait to use my bloodied LMG. I feel like I can now with the Ammo boost. I've been stockpiling steel, lead and gunpowder for this.
---
This is a Bethesda problem to solve. There's zero incentive to go after the ores. You get rewarded killing ghouls (and the occasional legendary one) regardless of whether or not the event succeeds. Why should anyone who does RR for this reason change that?
---
Like I said, no incentive. Until that changes, this will keep being a problem.
---
I'm not saying its insignificant, I said melee didn't NEED sneak to be good
---
I turned it off, set up some perks, and turned it back on again...but it doesn't recognize any points you add with the legendary cards, so it's proper broken for the time being.
---
I'm going to start leveling special perk cards first so I can min/max my stats. So end game will be something like 15str/15per/5end/3cha/12int/10agi/15luck I might've done the math wrong but something close to this. It'll take a while to level up all these perk cards anyway, but eventually I could basically use any heavy weapon or rifle. Should leave me with 2 perk slots for either damage or defense perks.
---
This isn't new.
---
They were today.
---
I was kinda surprised the icons didn’t change to yellow, like your camp and v76.  
---
On the other hand, other vaults are yellow and not free, so I guess marker color is somewhat arbitrary and only partially makes sense.
---
 Very interesting!
---
Pretty much yes, but unarmed does not really count.
---
As a level 400+ everything I fight is basically lvl 100(depending on max level cap of current zone).
---
I went from 300 dang a shot on my commando build to 78. Now normally that wouldn’t be that odd as enemy resistances and levels have increased, but because they did I’m going there way more ammo and time to kill enemies. I’d like to make clear I’m not complaining about the ammo, I could care less, but as a glass cannon bloodied build I am taking way more time to kill causal enemies while ghouls and supeemutants are tearing my ass up. I can only imagine people with good builds and non perfect builds. People are suffering the consequences now.
---
For like 2 seconds out of a week though. It's a decent perk but honestly the other perks have so much more worth that you will use everyday. Electric Absorbtion for example. But to each their own.
---
Just wasteful.
---
Rip
---
*tato tato
---
Damn that was HARD! I did it with one other high ranked team member. I'm also high ranked and we usually sweap up the baddies.
---
We both died a lot. And truckloads of stimpacs used. 
---
But we did it. And it was exciting! And we felt a sense of accomplishment, and we bonded even more over it because we fought like hell when our other team members noped the fuck out.
---
Ngl I really enjoyed getting destroyed by high level mobs as a low level player. Took a lot of thinking to get to some places. Its probably better this way though.
---
Yeah, kind of strange. Vault raid may return someday, hopefully it runs better.
---
What does matching armour mean? All scout or all unyielding etc.
---
Shoot true.
---
I imagine you'll get quite a bit more value when you can fast travel to either for free and turn in treasury notes.
---
How the hell have people unlocked this already
---
Great so on top of the infinite no delay stim ability this just buffs flying ac130 tin can builds great lol
---
\&gt;  Pretty much the nastiest combo we ran into on the PTS 
---
You haven't done the freezing robots, have you?
---
It's a very valuable 2 seconds, especially given we need to use more ammo now because of the changes.
---
Those 2 seconds can save you dozens of minutes having to farm mats to craft ammo.
---
No cheat, but waiting until the last 10 ranks is better in my opinion. They just cost more score to unlock, so I wait until the last 10. You do you.
---
No :)
---
How much damage do you regularly do as a full health? Just curious so i can compare.
---
Nothing with NW??? 😔
---
**evil hand rub** good good, because that was BS struggle to launch a nuke only to go fight the SBQ and find a corpse with some guy making finger guns
---
Only 28 people were in the match when I joined NW earlier, 🤣🤣 got 2nd without firing a shot
---
Upvote for being a cat.  No idea about the gauss thing.  Most people can't even say it right.
---
My melee and stealth commando both got about halved with their damage outputs, even with specializing legendary perks compared to their pre-patch output
---
Add Super Duper in to the mix you get 1,800 ulti .50 holy wow!
---
Yup. That's it
---
Wow. We haven't even gone a day yet with this system and the greed has already started.
---
Wait, what’s going on??
---
here are the stats outfitted for bloodied commando, all commando perks, no shot gun perks at all.  I equipped each gun and fired it. I did how ever add a fair amount to the strength legendary perk, but no damage buffs. No demolition expert but I do have max gunsmith.  I do have adrenal reaction serum going, a calmex addiction (just 1 ) and I have adrenaline 2 but have not killed anything for over 5 minutes
---
Bloodied fixer 10DWA 50 %DRWA = damage = 147
---
Bloodied Gauss shotgun 50 %limb damage +1 P = 598
---
Junkies Explosive 25 combat shotgun damage = 217
---
instigating Gauss shot gun 33/25 damage = 425
---
vampire combat shot gun 25/15fr damage = 145
---
mutants combat shotgun bashing damage = 152 but I am mutated
---
Bloodied combat riffle ffr damage = damage =123
---
Bloodied handmade 50 vc damae = 128
---
With just 3 full commando perks I dont between 50 to 68 dps on lvl 50s
---
You get down voted because our damage did need a huge hit. The game was being balanced entirely around the 1% of players who maxed out their damage, leaving everyone else who wasn't bloodied feeling powerless. This change is laying the ground work for enemies to now be properly balanced in a way that everyone can take them on.
---
It’s the third or fourth reward. The first few levels fly past. One weekly objective is all it takes for one level
---
I was wondering the same thing! Finally!
---
That’s fantastic. Now I don’t have to run through super mutants and scorched
---
Have you seen the whitesprings UFO? On xbox
---
start a new character and then say that
---
Well, I see it as that. But it’s their game and their money so not really my concern. 
---
I mean it’s entertainment, which is wasteful in its nature.
---
There there Ragey McRagerson. It'll be ok. Your one-shotted enemies are now 2-3 shotted enemies. It'll be fine.
---
Woo hoo
---
Actually besides magic weapons, due to the new damage calculations I doubt people will be melting the queen. A lot of people, bloodied, took a MAJOR nerf in damage.
---
Just did Mama Dolce's. Having to mag dump every L50 molerat, feral, and liberator with a two-shot handmade got real old real fast. Pistols are even more useless now than they were before, and they got *buffed*.
---
It turns out the game gets really boring when all the enemy levels are all the same literally everywhere.
---
I guess they haven't yet learned that balancing the game against the top two percent of your meta's capabilities is A Really Stupid Idea. I wanna say I'm surprised they're still doing dumb crap like this, but, well...
---
...here we are.
---
I didn’t one shot enemies before yesterday and I’ve been grinding for weeks to get to where I was
---
No. Bloodied can hit hard but the ones that can flat ruin the queen are the glitched "magic" weapons. They have a glitch that deals absurd amounts of damage but it only is affected by certain effects
---
Well regardless I’m not leveling up everyday and I’m not doing the ridiculous nw challenges
---
If it wasnt bloodied it did for damage, if it was bloodied it did to stay alive
---
Well I guess now it does in your case lol
---
I don't have a problem with extra points but I literally grinded weeks for a full set of Unyielding to already do that for me.
---
At LEAST a warning IN GAME before spending my literal hours on a waste of time would have been nice. 
---
The card specifically states that it adds actual POINTS which add to your BASE CAP which is MISLEADING if you're looking to share your cards.
---
What about all the people that don't have reddit ? Shall a good percentage of players suffer because of Bethesda's incompetence to add a WARNING ?
---
I'm sorry but I don't see where it says that it's food or chems I see hard points I spent days to get. 
---
They are perk points people. You busted your ass for them, we deserve a warning. 
---
If they can warn you that SERENDIPITY does not affect POWER ARMOR they can let us know that a LEGENDARY CARD that adds to our BASE SPECIAL POINTS does not contribute to sharing.
---
I get what you mean but I feel like that is a problem that should be addressed by new content such as expansions or randomly generated dungeons. Just having every enemy scale up is a very lazy way of doing it which has a two major disadvantages as mentioned by other users:
---
it makes your progression almost pointless because everything just progresses with you
---
 
---
it creates extremely silly situations such as a strong endgame player getting wounded or even killed by a weak enemy
---
These are huge issues! People have been complaining about this in skyrim for ages, I really dont understand what made them thing bringing it back is a good idea. If they properly implemented enemy level caps I wouldnt mind it, but players in this thread are reporting lvl 100 rats, scorched, ants etc. That's just silly from a gameplay perspective and immersion-breaking.
---
Yeah yeah yeah that’s what everyone keeps saying, but who got hurt the most? Not be I’m still managing fine, but everyone else who doesn’t have optimized builds has to go through way more ammo and struggle with enemies they were already having trouble with.
---
Was the damage nerf necessary, maybe, but if you think that the nerf “benefits” players it does not lol.
---
I have never found anybody selling ultracite ammo ever this could change that.
---
without explosive B &gt; AA by 1 damage point out of a 50 cal on a death claw at max range (assuming the numbers aren't lying)
---
My bloodied lever used to be a one shot wonder. No more! Two or three shots now required on all 48+ level mobs. Switched over to my bloodied gauss shotgun.
---
As a side note any shotgun can be magic with a chance to block armor piece
---
Us vault raiders worked hard to clear the vault for everyone to explore. We drained the water, got rid of the radiation and killed the pests. You're Welcome
---
It’s a daily roll, if you hit the elder roll for the day, but don’t get a rare reward roll (80% chance with elder) that’s it for the day. You can’t reroll until the following day. 1 roll per day per tier of daily ops reward reached
---
The 3 means that they have 3, not that it is a pack of 3. Like with vendors that sell ammo.
---
They really are a GREAT addition. Legendary luck and perception are awesome. Able to throw an extra card on both!
---
Wait. You grinded for weeks to NOT one shot enemies? What have you been doing?
---
This is not something I'd boast about.
---
Awe thanks then. I appreciate the kind words. Have a awesome day and no one is weak in my book.
---
I struggled killing crickets before but now I have to take on level 100 crickets with a weapon that does less damage lol it feels like a double kick in the balls.
---
Haven’t received it either. 🙋
---
Lol definitely not worth it
---
I think all you can pay for is costumes and skins other then the first package rest is just window dressing
---
I don't know about you, but I have noticed very little change in how my weapons perform, and I am a Junkie's build. It's about the same in how fast I kill enemies so I won't need more ammo that often. In terms of mats, I have done enough trades that flux, lead, steel, copper, etc, are not even a concern anymore. In terms of utility it's nice but as of right now, there are better perks imo.
---
...the the fi...the fixer?
---
Aim for the combat inhibitor.
---
But why even bother releasing it in this half baked state?
---
Tbh...i have 100,000s of rounds of U5mm, and my vamps mini keeps me going, while weaking all the bots, and my melee buddy getting the finishing blow in. It works for us🤷‍♂️
---
I have never been so angry with fallout 76 as today. I ran daily ops solo, cleared it in 9 minutes with my bloodied heavy weapons power armor build. Second time I had two level 400s found myself screaming at them over the mic to look at the top right of their screen and acknowledge there’s a multiplier and to just stay by me and I would do the rest. One of them told me he wasn’t an idiot and left the other one eventually got it together but ultimately kept getting lost in the burrows. I finished the op in 7 minutes and 59 minutes. I told the guy, way to get the participation trophy and rage quit. If you’re clueless and someone else is carrying you just loose the attitude and do what they say.
---
I'm not sure how it works. I've done it twice with 2 of the 3 times spans and havent got a rare reward
---
The “wait, why am I bothering to heal myself?” moment was my second “ah-ha!” of the op. The first was “why am I fighting this seemingly endless crowd of robots when I can just RUN AWAY!!!!”
---
At the very least, make the fast animation play when getting irradiated.
---
Same here. Died probably 15 times then crashed to desktop. Haven't had that happen in a very long time.  Also my sheepsquatch staff passed through the bots half the time and didn't damage the bots. I am assuming that was lag though. Guess I'll have a reason to use the 300 or so stimpacks I've collected over time.
---
Thanks. Bashing takes to long. Never mind
---
Getting armor, then perks, then I started grinding gold for the better armor (got the ss chest last week) and then 1-2 days ago I was happy, one shooting enemies for my hard work to have finally paid off then BOOM. Gone just like that
---
Yikes no! I barely remember the rewards from the first season.. a nice lamp? That's it! Please don't spend money on their nonsense.. if you're that short of levels &amp; the season end is near.. I understand the ocd grind thang I really do... Those last few levels then, but only then😓
---
🍆💦
---
So stupid lol
---
You’re welcome. Anytime. Thank you. I hope you have a nice day/night as well. ☺️
---
my 3 vendors plus some stash and decoration got worse with this communist bunker update... so... thanks community? they don't fit anymore if i try to put them in the ground
---
before they were just floating but now they float and half asset is inside the walls bc they don't fit anymore if i try to put them on the floor... jesus
---
I’m studying for the NCLEX, so I cancelled my online account until I get everything finished up to avoid temptation.
---
I still don't understand how you can complain about getting free things just because you lack the self-control to moderate yourself and not burn out doing something that is supposed to be fun.
---
Maxed ultra .308 is 432 a pop
---
You can use a gun to break down initial health and then melee them at the last 1% of their health. Best to go in as public team if optional. Switch around some perk cards and legendary perks as well. Hope that helps. Still trying to attempt to finish the whole thing in under 8 minutes though. The fastest I got was 13 ½ minutes.
---
You spend $40.00 a week on fallout?
---
Yeah pretty much shit a brick,I’d be gutted to lose it even though it’s damage is much lower than before.
---
Hahahahahahahahahahaha you just made my day.
---
Haha thanks. Cats rule
---
Do all robots have That? I thought one type of robot had that?
---
It’s not bad. I don’t mind it.
---
well my 1st atoms are saved then xd
---
"Bethesda, for the love of God, ADD A AMMO BOX FOR ~~FALLOUT 1st MEMBERS~~ EVERYONE!"
---
Fixed it for you!
---
I got one only when i completed the 8minute difficulty the first time today.
---
I was just trying to stay alive, there is a multiplier?
---
That's the only time I havent completed
---
Personally I had an absolute blast with it. I'm a pistol build that's far from optimally, went in with a guy doing bloody with a claw, and a power armor person with a rifle. We finished the first time on the second rank because we all got incredibly lost, got elder the second time. I discovered dynamite takes them down to punching range and I have the ap to bash for days. So we had the power armor dude just sponge bullets while me and mr. Claws blew things up and slashed/pistol whipped things.
---
I'm with you.
---
I still buy some now again for the odd ammo I can't be assed to craft and get the daily done!
---
oh okay it's just a little confusing combat shot guns don't have a high rate of fire but the numbers make no sense. 
---
bloodied Gauss shot gun  = 67 fr X 598 damage = 40066
---
combat shotgun = 20 X 145
---
fixer = 75 X 147
---
Melee has always been weird for me. I have to swipe an enemy 4-5 times before it will register a hit. Even enemies I can 1 shot, I end up spamming them a bunch before I kill them. Makes it hard to get sneak attacks.
---
Damn son. DMG 227 and using the auto .38 receiver? Jelly jelly.
---
This lol.
---
Only if you do power attacks...
---
I tried it. It doesn't work.
---
Type of armor not legendary. It works for power armor as well
---
My damage was unchanged, and I dont run bloodied. They literally only changed how damage bonuses are calculated. Us people not doing bloodied with a ton of damage bonuses are pretty much unchanged. The only reason we feel something different now is that enemies have more health because they're higher level. I really don't care about shooting some extra ammo when we now have more ways than ever to get it. It benefits the experience of the game by not making everything a push over.
---
I have a feeling a good portion of the map is going to be red shortly!
---
This kind of scaling doesn't work well when you're not a max level character. Im level 32 and I don't have a fully developed and realized "build" yet. I run the kinds of guns I can make or find, and that's all I can do. 
---
I walked through the cub scout camp thing today (forget the name, but it's close to the Crater I think) and burned through well over 100 shotgun rounds just fighting off mirelurks. That was over half my total ammo. Those things are usually level 5 to 15 and take maybe 2 to 3 rounds each. But each one was soaking up 10 to 12 at my level.
---
All I can do at this point is shift around my perks to match what ammo I have available. And the perk pool at my level is very limited.
---
/u/Ladydevann this couldn't be what was intended, could it? It just seems absurd to alienate so many already-struggling players with terribly-approached scaling and ammo consumption.
---
Yeah im worried its a 100% drop on that difficulty only once a day 🤨
---
The worst part is all my good melee weapons can't be used in power armor. What kind of dumb fucking moron does my character have to be to not be able to slip their fingers into a meat hook, bear arm or deathclaw gauntlet while in PA but yet they can use a keyboard to hack into a computer terminal.
---
Quad lever with +25% rof. All rifleman plus tank killer, adrenaline,bloody mess and one rank of better crits. Use vats with concentrated fire and gun fu. Bird bones, eagle Vision (or whatever it’s called), scaly skin and grounded mutations.Aim for the head or applicable weak spot. I don’t tear through things but in daily ops it took maybe 6-8 body shots on the robots before I could finish it with a bash. Oh, and armor is nothing really great. Mostly carry weight reduction scout and ss armor. 
---
Wasn’t feeling too bad. In a group it seemed to only noticeably fall behind a heavy gunner. But not too badly, I was still holding my own on taking things down.
---
I think the changes feel good in my experience after a few hours.
---
59.95 a week on atoms
---
only items with function are available with Bullion
---
Same, thats why i posted to reddit. I can't be the only one with it. Ill check tomorrow and comment if noone has answered by then
---
Anyone had a chance to test a pipe bolt-action, stacking rifle/pistol cards?
---
Thanks for the information. Most helpful.
---
Post nerf too, it used to be better!
---
I use it around the map for basic enemies popping their heads and use its bigger brother B2525 with the true 45 rounds for bosses!
---
Just lazy
---
I like one shotting enemies. 😭😭😭 Rip one shot.
---
Personally I like the new higher level enemies but wish they left weapon damage alone.  Crickets were always abit of a tank for me,but now they are level 100 and my weapon has been made inferior
---
Ammo factory needs it's own slot
---
Oh no. Does this mean Harpers Ferry could be settled by a future faction? I always thought the Settlers might try to build the town back up, but knowing how the Free States’ quests and the Enclave event that occur there it made me rethink that theory.
---
Maybe it’s just because people are tired of going into peril to trade with him. Plus with the change in how enemy’s levels scale with your own that’d make even more sense as to why they’d move him.
---
Well I still get everything done I need to, just get excited for days like today. So I figure I can take a break every now and then.
---
So based on my run through today there is an increasing chance of getting one of the rare items for each difficulty. It’s practically guaranteed to get a rare one if you beat it in 8 minutes.
---
Yes I use full health
---
Oh god no. I just washed this shirt.
---
PC sorry
---
Well that's the simple explaination. But i doubt it's that horrific, he may just have some ressource management difficulties. Personally i have 4 characters and deleted 2 others. Under lvl 30, you gotta learn it quick...your melee weapon is your best friend ! Ammo are for "extrem" situations.
---
Idk bro, you seem to  not pvp that much because semi auto railway gives their quantums a chance to fill their health. I also have to overcome their explosive plasmas and now that electric absorbtion is in the game they can have an arggo player spamming tesla to heal them. My best bet is just to avoid pvping players in PA. And less pvp is what Bethesda seems to want.

This dude.
---
there’s not even that much in the atomic shop over a month
---
I am really surprised the made everything level up with you and not certain sections. I was playing for a hour earlier.  I am level 73. The new daily thing went through 1900 bullets, and ended up breaking a few guns.  The enemy just felt like a bullet sponge. Not sure if it was the increased damage or the path finding glitched out. It just didnt feel fun.
---
This is where the real game begins boys.
---
Yea I don’t know what they did but I feel your pain dude, my dreams of soloing sbq are pretty much gone
---
Not sure if this answers your question but the one time I did it, we completed the base, initiate, and paladin in one run. A minute and a half quicker and we would’ve completed elder in the same run
---
So nice of him. I hate him, he's rough
---
My game seems to lag like crazy when I switch weapons so I died about 20 times
---
I would but i have all 5 slots filled.
---
And it does get easier. You get better gear and perks and experience.
---
So I think yes is the answer
---
I love this. Thank you
---
Hold up. *you can open doors in this game?!*
---
What if i hit the 2nd tier does that count towards the 80% elder tier?
---
Find someone you trust to help or a friend just to stay in the world so you can rejoin,it’s atleast 100% effective every time,just a small tad more hassle ☺️
---
Did two levels in one run, no rare.
---
Considering you have chemist equipped, it would cost:
---
2,000 antiseptic
---
1,000 blood packs
---
1,000 steel
---
Guys quit posting this.. lol
---
Unless you have no ap because you use blocker, then you need to switch to a melee weapon!
---
Yeah, I've found that you can't just turn off your brain in low level areas anymore. Interesting in some ways but I like those chill moments where you can go autopilot and farm junk/events.
---
nope even the bloodied ones suck
---
I did 1 daily op at 17 minutes and got 1/3.  The next time I checked my challenges I had 3/3.
---
Yeah thats what I was going to check, how much a hit it took with the update. Was pretty bad but still don't have it on my commando character yet so ill wait to be disappointed another day. I had enough of that today. Lol
---
They need to make the event only reward xp if it succeeds. I've yet to see this ever hit the max ore. I'm usually the only person to collect it.
---
I think it gives an interesting way to adapt. Like I have a rifleman, so I use a plasma automatic rifle and power armor when I do daily ops for example. Heck you don't even have to kill them, use an explosive shotgun with Enforcer and let them sit there defenseless
---
I put down bloodied and unyielding, back to power armor with 50 cal - explosive. Explosive weapons going to be a new meta - in my opinion. I'm 242 lev and finally every encounter is a challenge. Only I'm not sure how we going to fight big bosses like Queen etc. I hope that they going to boost in some short time damage - without I don't expect to see many nukes. Personally I don't see the reason now to go to silos...
---
Yeah some of us are only 14% done with the download... gonna be a couple days before I can test anything lol
---
Never seen her die so fast before! I think they also fixed the bug where the SBQ and Earle just stop taking damage when multiple people are shooting.
---
Just the Uplink ones. Other types won't have the perception boost at all times.
---
I'll do it if I need fusion cores. Otherwise it's a waste of ammo, especially with the commando VATS fix.
---
You have to adapt in this situation , you can just try crippling them instead. They can't kill you if all their limbs are broken.
---
Bloodied melee weapons are useless now. Everything else is fine
---
Fraid not, magic damage works better than it ever has before!
---
What kind of a sissy uses quantums, maybe you should pvp non tryhard adults like I do.
---
Watch Angry Turtles video on the topic. He explains it all.
---
Oof, a good reason not to level up the card
---
Yeah but I just save them till I find something I like i wish they would let us save our camps then make new ones only enough room for so much
---
Where did you find the plans for the backpack?
---
Yeah, you're right. I wonder what would they have.
---
I've been working on a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-SWx4pmSjWkmE_Gwv07WiioIvNCMNbJMJtKFxc-IWF0/edit?usp=sharing) to work this sort of thing out, but it's in the early stages. If you want to mess around with the numbers make a copy (the fields that are dark blue are what you should edit.) I got lazy with the numbers for increased clips size and decreased reload time magazines, you have to look those up yourself on nukacrypt, there are just too many of them to make it comprehensive.
---
You're still meant to get the damage and rate of fire numbers from [this](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html) damage calculator, there's no point in me duplicating all of the buff stacking arithmetic. But the spreadsheet adds an option for headshot damage, proper multiple-projectile armor performance (I think), and sustained multiple clip dps.
---
I originally made it to see if stacking armor penetration has diminishing returns. Turns out it kind of doesn't unless you're using Incisor, though the need for armor penetration in the first place is very dependent upon damage per projectile. I.E. if you're a bloodied stealth sniper you don't benefit much from armor penetration. If you're a shotgun or two-shot minigun you benefit a lot.
---
Not a fan at all. Didn't like it at all in swtor, and I didn't want it here.
---
I did in 5 times so far. For the elder one I got light bulbs :( I want the cure thingamabob.
---
That also mean there's a lot of situation where this perk makes you immune to damage, like ghouls get with radiation.
---
All robots have combat inhibitors. Turrets have targeting chips also.
---
That was pre patch 22. Make a new character and say that again.
---
It's working fine now
---
Having to melee enemies that can see through stealth? Sure is fun having my whole spec thrown out the window!
---
Reinstalling the game solved all the issues
---
are you sure it's not damage\*fire rate /10?  If that's the case then Gauss shot guns are 4 times better than  bloodied low end fixers with no ffr or explosive.  But normal shotguns are still inferior.  Am I thinking about this correctly?  because my I 33/25 = around 3 K all with no perks
---
bloodied Gauss shot gun = 67 fr X 598 damage = 40066/10 = 4K
---
combat shotgun = 20 X 145 = 290
---
fixer = 75 X 147 = 1K
---
You spent thousands of caps on something you can find in the world?
---
Yea i have to rework my whole character now. Bloodied and junky got nerfed pretty hard. I only do  about 50% damage what i used to do. As a meele build we need to end a fight quick and we cant do that as easy anymore
---
Yea my assault rifle broke twice during radiation rumble and I broke 3 armor pieces during daily ops. They definitely made the game tougher. I honestly thought I was gonna hate it but it is fun. I’m dreading heading to the cranberry bog
---
Shoot the Combat Inhibitor from the back, or legs/thruster.
---
Clearly not the “Wayne Gretzky” from aqua teen hunger force...that sported a samurai sword but obviously had n eyes in the back of his head...
---
Since ya know...John Wilkes booth &amp; all
---
I'm not against the changes as of now , just trying to work or adapt to them . I don't mind being wrong if I am
---
Red Asylum Outfit wearers are really sweating at this comment
---
No additional fixes for that and fast travel bug and infinite death screen loop. Just more buggy content added. Cmon I like these additions as much as any else but they really need to set their priorities straight. And not just for us but for the longevity of their own product. Without us, there is no them.
---
Each tier is an independent roll
---
5% for initiate
---
10% for knight
---
80% for elder
---
If you reach elder at the same time as knight and initiate you will roll a 5% a 10% and a 80% chance
---
So it is possible though extremely unlikely to get 3 rewards in 1 day, it is possible (~17% chance) to get no reward for that day.
---
 If you reach elder, repeating the daily op won’t get you further rolls.
---
If you reach knight on your first run, you will get a 5% roll and a 10% roll, if you then do a second run and reach elder you will get only a 80% roll, but again only once per day
---
Yeah def need to prime my gun now. 216 ultracite .45 ammo for the same amount of resources? Holy fuck.
---
Console or pc? It literally tells you what button to press to leave on the top. Also the timer doesn’t go down so you can stay there pretty much forever as far as I’m aware of.
---
I do 1/5 of what I used to do but I’m not giving up on bloody as a whole, my old heavy setup still seems pretty usable considering the dmg without the perks equipped
---
Hahahaha!
---
Don't celebrate till it's working fine *tomorrow* too .. but hooray!
---
Escape brings it up. If you can't bring it up, you need to disable any mod that alters the HUD. Perk loadout manager, improved health bars, event notifications.
---
I max out opening safes and hacking as first, second going to recharge fusion cores. Decision is up to you, I choose quality of life ;-)
---
This lines up with my experience last season where I came in a little over 2 weeks late and managed to finish in time
---
I actually run junkies, and if my damage went down it was less than 10 points. Cry your bloodied tears all day while I enjoy the game.
---
That’s a damn good reward. For the next melee one, remember you can shoot it until it’s near death then bash it with your fancy new LMG.
---
Finally, someone with the guts to say something nice   
---
about the game we all love.
---
Well most of us love, I know I do and can't wait until I get home from work to check out the daily ops and all the other new things.
---
You know what, for all the criticisms I have for Bethesda they did alright with this latest patch. So far no serious complaints as of yet.
---
Each card provides a separate buff that blocks the effects of lower tier cards
---
I'll never understand how people can play a game for thousands of hours if there isn't a challenge. Is it habit? Is it hoarding the best gear? I don't understand the minmax mindset but I do feel bad for those experiencing loss with this update
---
PC. There was no indication of a button to press that I could see. And the timer did go down and time out, kicking me out of the Burrows.
---
It was the first place I went after the update today. Brought back a lot of memories of late nights trying to beat the clock and protect robots from bugs and rig the vote to get access the different sections and all the other tasks. And now it's just kind of empty and boring, sadly. Should be a fun location for the daily ops at least, but I wish they had kept some of the challenges to get to the different regions, it would have made it more interesting as a dungeon.
---
It was tough. As a level 170 with unyielding SS armor 170 bloody build it was hard. After I switched to a vampire sword it was much easier on the robots. On the boss i died 3 times before killing it. A good challenge.
---
Honestly there is no reason to run at 20% hp it's so miniscule that you're better running at 50% hp and definitely run White Knight cause even with the duration of weapons and armor going slower the enemies actually destroy your armor so fast in the op and if you're running power armor robot ops are a joke with the Electric Absorption Legendary Perk
---
PVE in Adventure Mode is trash, so nothing of value is lost.  NW exists if people want working PVP.
---
The unarmed nerf can now be compared to the two shot nerf.
---
Melee got nerfed straight across the board. Bloodied took it the worst.  Bloodied melee build is not a viable build any longer, not like this.
---
Wow i missed a 80% roll. Just my luck lol. Thank you for clarifying
---
RIP osmosis kit. You did everything, from being a portable power pack, to being installed in a turret.
---
On this topic, are you guaranteed an uncommon drop if reach the Paladin tier? I ran an op earlier today and unlocked Paladin but didn’t get anything.
---
Bethesda always releases stuff half baked
---
I swear this has been a bug since day 1, and they're only now fixing it.
---
Well after all the tweaking, it will likely be worse. Then again. Everything will do less damage now.
---
Makes sense, the mod probably has to be updated to be compatible
---
Right? I'm doing the "make new character and delete" thing now, ain't no way I'm leveling up my 200 character every day for the next 8 weeks AGAIN!
---
I logged off right before leveling him today, didn't think I'd do it so I already did it with a new character. Tomorrow I can just level him up, finish the weeklies and be done! Hopefully Daily Ops isn't a recurring thing like "Buy" cause fuck.... that adds a lot of time if nobody wants to play :(
---
It did for me at least halfway
---
now its even worse previously they only messed up new content now they fucked up old content as well :V
---
Don’t be too jealous. I’m at home due to stage 4 cancer and sitting with round 15 of an at-home chemo that’s flowing from this morning until Thursday afternoon. I’m staring at the main menu but I don’t have enough energy to press Continue and start the daily grind. Maybe if I can get a slight push and a shove, I can get going
---
I run junkies hybrid commando and it was nerfed about 25% so not too terrible. It’s still a viable build.
---
Ah, that would be it.   
---
I find the game unplayable without Perk Loadout Manager, so I'd rather just lose out on the rewards than shut that down.
---
idk why everyone is so hype for the return of the Brotherhood, Settler tech was off the charts
---
The only way to get jetpack plans for the excavator was to buy the red shift chinese power armor skin.
---
There isn't one. However there was a bug with one of the paints that allowed you to add it.
---
Just a FYI, a single Bash with a ranged weapon will easily take down a fully damaged enemy.
---
What do you mean uncommon? 
---
I feel like all these things we want are common/uncommon/rare versions of what the game calls “rare drops”
---
If I see a level 100 cave cricket I am getting the fuck out of Dodge.
---
1. Robots are all armored, so if you don't have armor piercing something, your damage will take a hit.
---
2. Colonel Gutsys have some weird armor-piercing .45 gun arm that will chew through you pretty fast, so try not to let it.
---
3. Robots have irregular weakpoints. Protectrons, Sentry Bots and I think Assaultrons actually have armored heads. Robo-brains are generally the only bot you wanna go for headshots on. Protectrons and Assaultrons it's good to take out their legs if you can't kill them outright. Taking out both arms will cause them to start self-destructing and charge towards you.
---
Robots also tend to do energy and high ballistic damage, so if you have say metal armor or something they might hurt more too.
---
When you balance against the top two percent, the other 98% are screwed.
---
no jetpack for Excavator armor
---
Not hyped BOS suck 100%
---
ye i just read they still didnt fix melee dmg calculation bug
---
If they’re going to kick our asses, at least make it something cool and lore-friendly. If it was a swarm of deathclaws, I might actually rise to the challenge and waste all those stimpacks. But freaking Mr. Gutsies that kill you in 5 shots ... screw that.
---
Same here . Very frustrating quest
---
Praise the Sun!
---
I was being realistic. That would be the only way that Bethesda would do that.
---
Yeah i made the mistake of maxing it out.
---
I also got the 3x daily op score challenge.
---
Server jump
---
I play on pc and it says to press “esc”
---
Ngl you should find players who are if you want to complete daily ops on this toon. It's dead weight. I get why having that spread is good for helping other players, but that has almost no application in Daily Ops besides sharing Adrenaline 5.
---
It's okay to make different characters for different things.
---
Slop a resource gatherer over a lead deposit..
---
I joined two scorched earth events and two colossal problems. No problem there with my bloodied shotgun, but I am not oneshooting or onepunching anything anymore. 
---
I see Power Armor and/or Vampire faster fire weapons ruling the Earth.
---
Yep I figured. Still it breaks my heart not having it... it’s a much needed QoL
---
They're the high level mirelurk variants. No queens that I found and no more damn bugs. But they don't respawn and are spread out enough to be pretty straightforward to do solo. It's worth going through for the lore and will be a fun place to do the daily ops.
---
So are you implying it doesn't get easier with access to max level armour and weapons and all perks and legendary perks? Is that what you're saying? You're saying that and believing it to be true? 
---
I went on an alt tonight. Played 10 minutes realised i'd forgotten to add my legendary cards. Also realised i had 5 points to spend. So i bought a few cards and basically added adrenaline 3 and gun fu 2 and straight away that made things MUCH easier. doing noticeably way more damage to enemies. noticeably killing them faster.
---
Awesome paraphrasing!
---
New player here just getting used to the game and how everything works ....or at least I was. I too just popped lvl 24 before the patch dropped. One session on the new patch and I am drained of ammo (and lead to make more) everything needs repairing (again) I am reduced to my trusty fire axe and just letting myself die and respawning because I am out of stims and healing salves. At one point I  was surrounded by 8 scorched all at my level ....half my whacks with the fire axe missed but they hit me every single time. .....and that was at my camp. It just got wayyyyy more difficult for lowbies like me. 
---
I totally get (and respect) that long time players needed more challenge but more thought should have been given to the leveling experience imo. Even gathering the resources to replenish my stocks and get back to the point I was at is going to be a nightmare. I'll definitely persevere because I was enjoying the game very much but that enjoyment has been tempered somewhat. I just hope I get used to it.
---
new update is very soon for it.
---
I completely agree, feels like an actual challenge and the rewards are great imo. Definitely something that has so much replay value, especially with randomized settings every day.
---
Wdym? You don't like 1 star nocturnal pipe revolvers?
---
Season reward then gold bullion purchase afterwards!
---
That way Bethesda can still charge for it!
---
Justifiable rage ... it felt like some kind of bullshit rush mode that was tacked on. Just what I want in Fallout ... a corridor shooter with the same 3 enemies.
---
yep , my bloodied bear arms hits earl for (100 max  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) and less damage -
---
average 59  average 59  average 59
---
3x ninja
---
in caution , with meat stack ... whiskey
---
38 strength
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
i ranged  800-   2000   - crit shot and sneak 4400k before Nerf
---
now 59-100 damage max  ...
---
59-100 damage ...
---
59-100 damage  max  ...
---
this not acceptable
---
I believe some of the rewards are grouped into uncommon and rare drops. Uncommons have a slightly higher chance to drop vs. rare
---
Amen.
---
Ah sorry. I’m on PC so I can’t help.
---
I spot the bug as well with daily ops. After I start shooting and finish with bash. But true, I think is the bug
---
That’s a good idea. Knowing them, It would be rank 200 and it would cost 5001 gold bouillon to get
---
Yeah. Melee kill and stealth detection on the day commandos were already feeling the sting of  a few nerfs/fixes? Not great LOL
---
The daily ops are just stupid and not fun at all.
---
I just enjoy playing like that. Role-playing, getting the best stuff and just being an absolute beast against NPCs and trying to beat personal bests with stuff like the SBQ, speedrunning silos, etc. Not everything has to be a challenge to be enjoyable.
---
Taking One For Team, can’t go wrong with that.
---
It's definitely not 100%. I got elder and no rare.
---
It was the BEST IDEA HOW ELSE COULD THEY TAKE EMEE ON EHH? I DESTROYED THEM WAVE AFTER WAVE!
---
Than you
---
more importantly sniper/rifle builds are useless so yes you will have to
---
When I'm stoned, not doing my homework waiting for the update to install it is the funniest thing ever for some reason.
---
Ive been playing rifleman since i started playing. How do I rebuild myself?
---
Yes.
---
Moby Dick over here
---
No wonder the guy I gave a Fixer plan to keeps saying thank you...
---
Then why the hell would you want to waste 17 more minutes and 10x the ammo for the same shit rewards over and over? You make no sense.
---
Hard to speed run when it starts lagging half way through.
---
Take my revolver build for a walk in the forest and run fertile soil to see if I'm going to keep playing or not.
---
I'd be more sanguine if the perk swapping had made it into the game. Swapping to my Encryptid setup works a dream, but it takes time.
---
Yeah, well, considering the punny punches I am throwing after the nerf, it's the least it can do. 
---
Really, from 3K to 300. Back to Commando.
---
Dam okay, im sorry about that but what this means is there might be a small chance to get a reward even after the three difficulties.
---
Exactly. I’m not a new player, but at your level it’s nice to be able to go back to t level 5 enemies in Grafton for example if you’re stuck on higher ones in the savage divide. I’m sure the update had good intentions, but I don’t think it really improved anything at all.
---
Pistol match more skillful
---
Not sure I'd agree about the "not hard", but I clearly haven't learned the ropes yet. Just tried my first Daily Op, aside from the fact that I had no idea what I was supposed to be doing (I was solo, eventually started to figure it out), however, I didn't fully understand the whole jist of these enemy perks. With my bloodied Gatling Plasma, I couldn't kill a single "resilient" enemy. Finally, in an act of desperation, whipped out my Blade of Bastet (my only other weapon) and was able to take them all down. Baby steps ..
---
My testing in pvp is that it does not work.
---
yeah, shame Bethesda didn't have the native perk loadouts coming out at the same time instead of winter, that would had worked out perfectly.
---
Mm hmm whatever you say /s
---
true.  I get the least amount of damage on a protectron head
---
North Korea's official name is "Democratic People's Republic of Korea," but it's not democratic, it's not a republic, and they don't support or represent their own people. Names can be funny like that.
---
Thanks for that. I thought you could get 3 chances all together by completing it any any order. Now, is that locked to your character or player account
---
Holy shit I am learning something new. Thank you.
---
Wait you guys think this game is hard???
---
What kind of guns are you using at lvl 100+? Pipe Weapons???
---
I logged on today 2 see the changes and the only diff. i saw was that sometimes enemies take longer than 1 second to die lol
---
After playing a little more I think the problem is that as soon as you hit 50, common enemies won’t scale any lower. If this is the case, I can see this being an enormous struggle. Guess I’ll be doing melee more since ammo is so hard to get now.
---
Kinda like the case with legendary modules
---
Can confirm there's at least one.  After I get home and play we'll see if it drops to zero.
---
&gt; Better story, better characters, better gameplay, better everything really.
---
Must have played a completely different game than I did. Combat system was jank, companions were basically one-use battle cooldowns, weapons were a snoozefest, exploration was unrewarding because all you ever found were the Science weapons that were 90% useless or 10% OP with nothing inbetween. Then there was the "story" which was a tonal nightmare. How could you take anything seriously with such cartoonishly evil corporations and the constant eye-waggles? It was all basically an extended Rick &amp; Morty episode, complete with an actual, in-game Rick.
---
Outer Worlds was a garbage game made by the leftovers of Obsidian, and I'm sad I wasted my time playing through the whole thing for like $1 on Game Pass.
---
Theyre really cool and not at all as bad as others say. Just a tip for daily ops, bring throwing knives they count as meelee
---
TSE &gt; AAE &gt;= BE are top 3 with level 5 explosive perk in his testing
---
Are you using the gauss shotgun? Just that has a bug still where it locks you out of doing any other actions occasionally like taking a stimpack, swapping weapons, reloading, sprinting etc. You fix it by holsterijg your gun and bringing it out again.
---
If it ain't that, does it work with just one weapon as that may have also generated this gauss shotty bug
---
For some reason all Mega Sloths are now passive! You won't VATS them and they won't attack unless you attack first.
---
What this means is building a CAMP around a mega sloth spawn (as I have) can give you a respawning, friendly mega-sloth!
---
Yes. Some can be bought with gold bullion but others will be gone until they aren't.
---
Congratulations! Doing your first nuke especially solo is most definitely a memorable milestone 😊
---
Did they fix the VTU baseball cap?
---
When you find a good weapon, perk into that. Look for a combat shotgun. Those are generally pretty solid.
---
I concur... my instagating super sledge is still one shotting peeps...
---
9 ultracite fusion cores?!
---
screw my melee build i should switch to my legendary ultracite gatling laser
---
It can be overcome with a mix of melee players and ranged players.
---
You it's:
---
#**16X DA DETAIL!**
---
The problem is weapon durability. Things break way too fast.
---
It was OP anyway. We all know it, we just got used to it.
---
Well that shotgun is useless now i promise.
---
Right ... I love this game, have probably played it more than anything else over the past 6 months ... and playing this mode, even after not seeing the mutations and “getting it” initially, was absolutely frustrating and not well designed. I was psyched at the start of today and now I’m considering a break to play other titles because this was so annoying for a stealth sniper build.
---
I'm not moving my points for this singular unfun event.How did I survive 45 minutes later? Boss got stuck so I was doing the mole thing shoot n hide
---
Shoot and hide. I don't understand why they keep making changes that I didn't ask for? Not grinding anymore for gold and going thru a maze in order to get what's needed. I stopped playing all together as of right now. So put off by this fe hope tomorrow my view change of not. I'm uninstall this huge space taking garbage
---
It says right on the tool tip for the legendary special cards that perks won’t exceed 15
---
Same here! btw I enjoy Oxhorn's lore videos on YouTube a lot, might worth checking them out if you're a lore fan like me.
---
Commando should be the easiest given it's still in the perception tree. Find a fixer or handmade you like and there ye go
---
Yeah, I have a reduced weight auto tesla that I used on forest mobs. The damage output on it was only low, and the other legendary effects on it literally didn't matter, because I didn't even have to aim it and it insta-zapped all the low level enemies in the forest anyways.  
---
Whenever I was chilling in the forest and got attacked, I just aimed it at my feet and never really paid much attention to what the enemies even were.
---
It's now going up on my wall as a reminder of the good old days.
---
The ONLY thing that doesn't work anymore is trying to merge a structure like the communist bunker. Walls still work just fine and roofs for circular buildings are unaffected as well.
---
Rip good XP for everyone ;(
---
I’m lvl 500+, my man.  I’d played commando for v94 and soloing SBQ, Encryptid, etc, so I know what the DPS loss was.  It’s substantial, but I blasted through the daily op and an understaffed ACP today.  New commando powerful auto receiver DPS feels like old rifleman hardened receiver DPS.  It’s still plenty adequate.  I never missed out on SBQ loot with a semiauto handmade or fixer, even with magic miniguns all over the place.
---
The only difference I see is that bloody players can no longer afford to be lazy with defense and stealth ability.  Perks like Blocker and Dodgy need to supplement Serendipity, and full investment in stealth is now important.  You can’t just skate by with 30+ Ag anymore.  Shadowed mods and Harder to Detect are pretty key vs lvl 100 enemies.  Max lvl Gutsies and mutants have incredibly high perception.  
---
If you’re getting your ass kicked constantly, look into more defensive perks and tossing out the Secret Service armor for something you can shadow.  I max out every stealth boost I can get and I didn’t hit danger once today.  Lvl 100 mutants, scorchbeasts, mirelurk kings, whatever.  I just wish I could still hurt them with a lever gun.
---
Dude same im at work on break I just wanna go home and play fallout
---
Junkie's explosive 90% WR. Still does work
---
Time to go on a murdering rampage. /s
---
I like the idea of these daily ops but not a fan of todays bash the enimies one though but excited to play other mutations /locations. Also experience is significantly decreased vs the enimies compared to other content 😔
---
So now you have to do the boring mission to get the rep?  Damn it. :'(
---
RIP osmosis kit and portable power pack you got me to friendly rep. 
---
Gonna miss how Ward asked me to return an item and one second later he knew that I had his missing property  just to give me 60 caps, 8 scripts and some rep without even taking the item.
---
This. It holds in a charged state, can only fire or holster to fix.
---
Jeeze dude. Deep breath.
---
I'm not that guy, but I bought it out of a player's vendor for 6I.
---
Well now i have no reason to go back to Foundation.
---
My junkies slugger PA build felt fine. Completed the op solo in under 16 minutes, could have been faster but I lost sight of the quest marker at one point and just sat there killing things for a minute or two.
---
I want a Brahmin to follow me around
---
I strongly suspect they will let people explore the Vault now, since people complained about that.
---
I was just making a Fawlty Towers reference.
---
I just have my locks at level 0 because nobody wants to actually steal them.
---
how does vats even work? i’ve played over 100 hours and i still have no idea how to use it
---
Totally. My unyielding unarmed ninja is useless. Damage got nerfed, enemies were buffed and you can't benefit from stealth, plus enemies know where you are all the time. 
---
This does not feel balanced and I fear it will push many people into one or two viable builds only, like power armor and magic weapons or a full set of troubleshooters and as vampire commando.
---
I like to be forced to change my style, but I don't want all of us doing the same. It's boring.
---
Same, I have a junkies/for/+1perception fixer I got from purveyor sale and my heart sank thinking that I somehow scripped it by mistake
---
Im pretty sure is from daily ops only
---
Piercing gaze makes them see u 100% of the time, stealth is dead lol
---
Yeah pretty much
---
I play games to have fun, not to get frustrated. If everything is going to be a struggle kill from now on, I doubt I'll play much anymore.
---
I gave up halfway through lol F that
---
I did, I felt like Macho Man on steroids lol
---
Super Duper would makel that less by what 20% or so?
---
I wish I had a team. Just did my first Ops by myself and lost count of the times I died. It would be much easier if the enemies didn’t have their health bounce back up, that is so frustrating and exhausting.  But I did get it done...only took about 45 mins. Next time I’ll wait until I see someone else starting one, I didn’t think that absolutely no one would join if I started one this time. I could see how it’d be fun with more than just one person.
---
That is weird about the theremin
---
Im a junkie build myself all my weapons have seen 80 to over a 100 damage decrease. I promise you its useless.
---
Thank god that’s actually SO much better.
---
20%-30%, but since it's chance based I didn't count it. That's a lot of variables.
---
The Bethesda video with the devs the other day confirmed that getting elder on your first run gives you 3 rolls at the rare rewards.
---
Well all the "useful" items soo far have been early rewards that anyone could get, the sink, the ammo machine and the weights. The later stuff have just been really cool cosmetics.
---
Not going to contradict you on the gold cost though, the price for that chicken coop is bullshit!
---
Possum quests
---
I really hope you guys see the feedback about the stealth issue with daily ops.  Kind of ruined the ops for a lot of us
---
Good advice if you weren’t in my position
---
As the great Albus Dumbledor once said “there will be a time when we must choose between what is easy and what is right.”
---
Bethesda chooses the easy fixes like camp building exploits and ignores the things that would make the game better because, well that requires knowledge and is too hard
---
I think the gauss shotty damage numbers you have are for a full charge which greatly reduces your fire rate.
---
Oh im a fookin tank.maxed shotty/rifle build with a splash of heavy gunner.full buttressed ss armor.......hold my beer.
---
My shotgun does 504 dmg.in vats it even higher.
---
Yup, that's why I made this guide. To help counter it. Try and spread this to make it popular. Cause it works for me.
---
Yep, My B3325 Fixer went from ~300dmg to ~190dmg. Ended up using a nuclear winter Combat rifle for now. It deals more damage then the Bloodied Fixers. That’s pathetic.
---
If you have any decent melee weapon. You can do just about as well with it as you can shooting. I tried using my be fixer and found a perk less bloodied mmg could 2-shot them while my fixer struggled to get them to bashing hp
---
So I can make 360 rounds of ultracite 556 and have it double with super dupee
---
Apparently
---
In this fight, I realized how important of PA it is, I can imagine if I fight without PA, probably got instant kill many times, it's so exciting for close combat fight with robots. :D
---
good first step.
---
now for Laser rifle and Gatling laser skins be able to apply onto ultracite laser and gatling weapons.
---
its literally the same model but cannot use the laser skins :(
---
I don't see myself selling stimpacks anymore. Or ammo.
---
Suddenly I don't feel that lucky for getting the liquid courage recipe anymore...
---
on the bright side, I can still mix fermented ballsack juice and sell it in my vendor
---
Thank you! I didnt get any popups whatsoever and immediately went to Atlas because, yknow, we just spent a month building that up. But sure, place him in Watoga. Thank you again!
---
Whaaaaat wait?....so if you do well the first time, it changes the chance of getting a rare? Thats alot of pressure 😖
---
That sounds sweet.
---
Rare drop from Daily Ops on Vault 94
---
I know. I was making a joke. The max Bollliun is 5,000 And rank 200 would be impossible to hit without spending money.
---
oh now i'm wondering what other Vault-tec workshop items will make it in at some point.
---
my main is lvl 45 I just started playing a week ago. I have access to none of that. start a NEW character and then tell me how it is.
---
Oh damn, I have a ton of TSE sitting in my stash, hoping they would be good after the patch.  I'm rich!
---
That’s the problem with the mentality of this mode and other aspects of the game that I don’t find to be very “Fallout” ... I don’t want to re-spec to play one mode. My character is my character, it should be an rpg first. I don’t want to move and rebuild my camp constantly. Let me build a main base and then have a smaller camp if you want me to constantly build new places. 
---
This game is messing with the core of what Fallout is ... an RPG that’s become a shooter ... but when it leans in too heavily on the dailies, and changing up the same character for different events, or missions that have zero narrative build up or pay off ... it starts to lose me in the same way that ESO turned me off from the start.
---
My build is optimized. And I was not really complaining about myself like as you said I can get by with damage cut, but I’ve only heard from friends and other players who don’t have optimized builds the game is much harder for them now.
---
I found it in a player vendor.
---
Unfortunately shotguns have always had this weird rubber banding effect on health bars. You probably didn't notice it much in the past because of 1 shotting. Shotguns also do more damage in vats compared to free aim it's really strange lol.
---
It was super helpful towards my maximum INT build but now.... sigh, oh well.
---
Edit: now you'll hear me say - "The good ole days."
---
And everyone is just walking around, completely jacked.
---
Now, with the resilient, can you get them to their base damage and then melee? Cause I felt like earlier they regained health somehow.
---
Although no one was running ops except me which made it take 20 minutes.
---
Its not just that, power armor seems to not be helping with weight carrying. At all.
---
Pumping iron till you're strength 100. Then you lose it in 30mins. Makes sense.
---
and train stations and the rusty pick
---
That is not true unless you’re holding a melee weapon.  Throwable items take on the traits of your equipped weapon.
---
I found my junkies slugger/commando character to be totally viable. 
---
I haven't played my gunslinger/shotgunner character yet. My guess is a good gauss pistol is still alright. If you were going auto pistols you might want to do commando instead.
---
I have a NW laser rifle which is doing 380 damage rn lol. I guess I’m farming fusion cells u til they rebalance weapons
---
Beserker also effects thrown weapons if you equip the beserker weapon beforehand.
---
I just wasted 3 keycards im fucking myself off the game now.
---
Maybe it is tied to the max level of the location that you built your camp (in addition to it being affected by character level). Did your husband build his camp in the forest (currently max 50)?
---
It’s horrible. Especially when the hit detection is a joke
---
I already use a handmade as a midrange weapon so i guess i can convert it? Just a little disappointed, i really liked my build and not burning through ammo
---
What does the Wanamigo plushie look like out of curiosity? If it’s what I think it is then I definitely want one
---
You can't access the legendary perks with that mod right now either. I'd turn it off and wait until they update it.
---
Thank you, but i was talking about buying them.
---
*cough* 900 ultracite .50 rounds for the same price *cough*
---
Unless you're in a team and someone spots you!
---
I've already checked 8 times for an update today :(
---
On a side note, if you equip legendary perks (even legendary SPECIAL) and then turn the mod back on, they do still work, you just can't see/edit them. You will have a funny bug where it shakes your perk card but still puts it on if you go above your natural SPECIAL limit but within the boosted legendary one. However, saved loadouts will not equip anything beyond your natural limit, it will say you don't have enough points to do it even if you do
---
I did exactly the same. Didn't know how to start then next thing im in the burrows. Didn't know what was happening. Alone. Dying. Shooting then realising it wouldn't kill so Grognak came out. Someone appeared, then went quickly. 
---
I was in such a flap i dropped my prize instigating lever action.  Like the one I've used every day for a year. Its gone. I remember fumbling but didn't notice the drop. Used dozens of stimpacks and 3 repair kits. Never ending robots hammering at me. That thing at the end......if i didn't happen to have my vampires 50 cal on me, it wouldn't have lost much health. My axe was like using a nail file to cut a tree. Completed in 18 something minutes of pain.
---
Neah. those missing items were everywhere. I found 3 stacked on top of each other near the fair once.
---
What about the foosball and laser game?
---
My antiarmor Gatling shoots tangerines now, so, I feel your pain. To be honest, the only weapon that causes real damage are the magic shotguns, which should have been the only ones getting fixed. 
---
My Unstoppable Monster hits like a towel, too.
---
I seen this in pts and had no clue what it was. Now I know. Looks great!
---
Yes. You can go gunner and shred em then gunbash, or go full on melee build, your choice.
---
Guess I’ll join you there since I didn’t even know you needed another keycard for each failed attempt. Like wtf. Doesn’t even make any real sense whatsoever.
---
I always have 3 others join me, 2 are gunners and 2 are melee
---
You still need to loot every other body though!
---
Also if you die as Earle does, you can just run down the escape tunnel to get to his body!
---
oh, hahahah, I get ya now, maybe 20,000 minimum.
---
Better repair Em then
---
Sucks for you then. Im using the same build as before and enjoying myself
---
yeah, my nw laser deals the same. I prefer the nw combat rifle tho. I can’t put a suppressor on the Laser rifle.
---
maybe your build needs some work?
---
Because if they don't disable stealth in daily ops it would be ridiculously easy to cheese them without having to touch an enemy until you reached the boss.  Disabling stealth didn't just now break the game, being able to sneak up close enough to enemies that you can smell their breath without breaking stealth broke the game a long time ago.  
---
"Then they should just fix stealth then!"
---
Yea, like they just tried to fix the damage formulas?  That's been suuuuuuuuuuuper well received hasn't it?
---
No technically if you do them 1 by 1 you still get 3 rolls it just takes longer but doing it elder straight away still gives you credit for the previous 2 levels you leap frogged. What's not 100% clear is that if you do get elder 1st time do you get rewarded 3x loot or if its just 3 chances to roll 1 plan...
---
The PVP fans were there, but we've been playing it since release /w no major changes since Morgantown and shiny new BR like Warzone drew most of us away.  I was around level 200 in NW and I don't see many of the regulars playing the mode anymore.
---
Anyone know if the mothman worship emote is the same as the one you get on Fallout 1st?
---
Edit: It's a different emote.
---
Tingling
---
I’m a melee or a heavy gunner, depends on the scenario, also thanks for the advice dude 👍
---
Relax, you would have blue screened shortly after launching the nuke anyways.
---
Running blocker for sure, have been since day one since 70% of the enemies mainly melee anyways! Lol
---
Hey, you, just hold still. Just about got this reload done.... dang it, shouldn’t have checked my pip boy.
---
Alright, just about got her. Dang it, where’d you go?
---
Legend
---
Not aware of anything changing, I also run bloodied with serendipity, no problems. A friend I was playing with today for roughly 6 hours uses dodgy and had no issues as well. He was melee as well, during daily ops.
---
Yeah but I’ve bought everything I want already, may as well use it for XP boosts
---
Ikr...it’s like I’m crippled just from that,  the nerf wasn’t as bad as I expected.  I’m still ripping though enemies like before.  Maybe just a few more bullets but nothing crazy.
---
Do last week’s codes still work at all? Anyone tested?
---
Well stealth is a popular play style, and it’s not fun to just take that away from so many players. If you don’t want it “cheesed,” as you say, then don’t play stealth.
---
Too expensive, if they increase the daily gold limit to at least 500 then it would be fair.  200 daily is a joke.
---
Looks rad! I got the mask. Looking really silly without the rest haha.
---
Exactly
---
Yes. Thanks. I will save a lot of ammo now.
---
This is the legit way to get it, starts in the forest. You basically join the girl scouts.
---
I had a +350 lvl character and created another character for this build i optimized and perfected to play how i like it. I tried many different builds like rifleman, big guns and stealth but i didn't like them much. This nerf is a big mistake in my opinion, if you think otherwise we could debate.
---
They weren’t before? Pets are amazing!
---
I was doing solo but getting creamcicled the whole time. Maybe piercing gaze has something to do with it; thr new modifier that makes enemies know where you are a majority of the time.
---
Same advice with heavy gunner and there’s no TS melee so bloodied is def still King. Instigating is much more in the conversation now though
---
J ffr Gauss mini is not magic lmao go test stuff scrub
---
People asked and got what they wanted, don't blame the monkeys paw.
---
Totally essential for bloodied power armour builds. I've been killed so many times by some shitty little poison creature while waiting for my minigun to stop spinning so I can stim
---
Ah gotcha, good to know
---
I saw someone earlier with the tier 100 power armor ace skin, subjugator outfit too. Must have spent tons of atoms.. What a waste.
---
Are you in ops?
---
Are you using fusion or plasma cores
---
I'd guess they just added some music without securing the copywriter orginally. Now they've swapped it out, but bc everything they do is half assed, just Googled and stole another file which was mislabeled.
---
If you have to actually disable entire playstyles entirely just to make a daily mission type work, then your core system is flawed and you should honestly start refining that first. It's pure poor game design.
---
Ya I’d say. It was makeing me so angry.
---
Logged in today to see my camp being destroyed by level 50 super mutants that used to be level 5. My camp is a much more cozy home with only a few turrets as opposed to a armed fortress. On the upside I found my new favorite skin with the Mothman Hunter Outfit today.
---
😂😂😂
---
I will shake my fists extra hard at them pesky critters.
---
They are like the cazadors of the mojave.
---
I'm still killing most things in one shot with my "Instigating" lever action rifle. I use a full-health sneaking build, by the way.
---
The level 75 and 100 super mutants both drop from two shots to the head for me. One shot for the ones below those levels. Just use "Concentrated Fire" to help with head targeting. If you use the "Mister Sandman" perk card, you can one-shot the level 75 super mutants at night.
---
Laser rifle
---
Reset is Tuesdays around now but there can be a delay in updating them on nuka crypt, so always be wary around this time
---
Nah. Never have, dont plan to. I'll stick to playing how I want thanks :)
---
In and out of ops
---
After 1000 hours poured into my unarmed bloody build I feel like I’m back on week 2 of release... I will just do the daily and weekly challenges and logout. Already turned off F1st renewal. Nerfing builds but leaving endless bugs glitches and magic weapons in the game makes complete sense. I’ve been behind this game the whole time and this has pushed me over the edge. Fucking piece of Shithesda and Todd Fucktard need to pull their heads out of their asses.
---
Nah, magic damage means we kill her faster than ever before.
---
Daily Ops being different from events doesn't really fix the current problem though. All event bosses should deposit their loot directly into your inventory, I am looking at you Earle.
---
If you show up in your Chinese stealth suit, you've volunteered to collect ore. You should know this.
---
You doin ops?
---
Shit accuracy is the TS negative effect, weapon degradation is Explosive.  If people want to take advantage of the damage bonuses from both they need to live with both downsides.
---
We voted... everyone decided we don’t wanna play with you anymore... you can’t sit with us...
---
What’s with all these hack therapeutic answers? Don’t even bother with that shit if you’re just gonna pretend you’re better than me just because I am frustrated with a legitimate problem
---
I had the same problem with trying to bash or melee. I'd run up and punch the bot in the face only for it to not register the hit. It put me in the perfect position for the bot to murder me
---
Its only an op and acp thing
---
Does it only occur in ops?
---
No, unfortunately. You will make 360 rounds but if super duper triggers it will only give you a 2nd stack of the base amount so 80 more.
---
I never understood that argument. If people thought the game was too easy, then why not purposely nerf your own build? Why do the rest of us have to accommodate some randoms play style?
---
So how many atoms do you have
---
I keep killing myself with it to, lol. I got to stay in my power armor.
---
Lemme test
---
True that
---
And the perk isn't anywhere near enough for the 5 perk points it costs! For that much of a perk investment I'd expect them to be unbreakable!
---
As far as I'm aware from playing PTS you could only potentionally get it if you completed the run before 8 minutes.
---
I only got one out of 10 spec ops runs *8&lt; minutes* I did.
---
Hey, I just wanted to contribute to the conversation. Lol. You're right, though.
---
Supposedly they buffed camp defenses.there is a yt vid about it.
---
Yes and in acp
---
Thank you for the one informative answer
---
What stealth issue? All the enemies have such high perception that you cannot sneak; it’s a feature not a bug
---
Yes, there's no stealth possible with that enemy mutation. I feel today's mutations were the toughest. But had a system, I hit with range he ran with melee and finished everything. Certainly gets the blood pumping! I like it, we needed this.
---
Idk what the theremim is. Can you tell me?
---
Well they don’t have synths and the underground yet so there’s that also we don’t have a legit enclave yet kinda as in no humans yet and we are missing. And I would consider them a faction but aliens would be cool as in we get hostile ones and a few good ones that trade for new alien gear with idk gold or alien currency.
---
Unfortunately, no. You would get 1 stack of 900 and one stack of the base amount of 200 should SD trigger.
---
The game is ruined bud. I couldn't be more honest with ya its not worth a damn now. Your just gonna get frustrated and quit.
---
Yah, it’s definitely possible but you need to run it perfectly. If you would like, my friend and I beat today’s on elder with 2 fandoms. You can join us for future fights!
---
Yeah, now im grinding for a set of SS Vanguards....
---
I’ll fight you. Meet me in the KFC carpark 🤜 👊
---
It took them around 2 years to finally change the base and right now we're not really in any of a better spot, not to mention not doing a thing about the bigger problem (magic weapons) first. We're gonna be well into the life of the PS5 and Xbox X before balance actually comes.
---
They were probably at earl. The nerf didn't make sbq etc impossible
---
Not at Fish in a Barrel...oh I mean Line in the Sand.
---
Maybe that was it, simce enemies were literally shooting around corners that it would auto trigger our perk cards. It was definitely challenging for sure but was making sure for real world stuff that nothing huge changed
---
Armaments is def a thrilling event again!
---
Yes, they did
---
No, it's very possible! Ran 2 today. Able to cripple her limbs again. With One Wasteland, the event honestly seemed more balanced, but not anymore hard. If that makes sense.
---
It's a waste spending atoms on the first 4/5 of the run, you should only use atoms the very last day if you're struggling the last ranks.
---
Yeah, feel kinda bad about it, i didnnt play as much as you but on the bright side, apparently, this patch isn't final and i hope this kind of posts will change their mind about melee nerf
---
Yeah same here and my build wasn't designed around meleeing robots so it was extra challenging to lower their health and then bash them with my Death Tambo
---
I'm honestly kind of pissed about it so I'll either do the same as you or quit.
---
It's a CAMP buildable musical instrument.
---
Give me one Wingz &amp; Thingz, please
---
10mm pistol? I'll take a look at mine.
---
Ohh good to know !!
---
Just wait until you do your first Daily Ops, Bethesda took sneak completely away and placed a homing tracker on you so all enemies know where you are at all times.  SO MUCH FUN........
---
I just did it with 5 other ppl. We brought it down in 5 min, but I suspect somebody had a spe dial weapon b/c my b2525 fixer was doing 100 dmg/shot. It really has me thinking about going back to melee lol.
---
you're hurting my brain here. That's not cool. 
---
I have a level 335, 125, 60, 51 and a 50. I have played this game for 1600 hours. I think i know what i'm talking about. When i say it gets easier i am not lying. You know what happens at level 45? You can start using Level 45 gear. Max level handmades, gauss rifles, Lever actions, double barrels, pump actions and more and wooden, raider, trapper armour and others. 
---
And when you hit 50 every single max level thing in the game is available to you. Adrenaline and gun fu are two fantastic perks which boost your damage a lot but you don't get those until 49 and 50. 
---
tell me HOW it's possible that the game wont get easier with access to all this. 
---
It doesn't matter there's a patch out and things have changed. If you cannot see how having a max level legendary weapon and max level legendary armour and the RIGHT perks wont make the game easier then you're a silly person. 
---
EDIT: and also. Unless you've done your homework it's possible you have a bad build right now. Cards and perk points all over the place.
---
There’s been multiple people complaining about this lol
---
Does that mean that there is a use for mysterious quills now since they pretty much make poison throwing knives?
---
Bahaha. Was like 20 seconds today. Mostly because I ran past him by accident and had to double back!
---
Was using a Gatling plasma and it was just dropping random ammo types. Using .50 cal or mini, basically any other weapon it drops the appropriate ammo types.
---
Like to the point where they are about as effective as they used to be or are they actually worth using now?
---
If anything, now that we can cripple her wings, the event is easier than before.
---
I warned everyone this would be a problem! But they kept down voting me into oblivion....
---
Lol everyone and their mom. What, you play a version of 76 that didn't have any dupes. You're seem like a typical arm chair pvper, giving hypothetical answers lol.
---
How about allowing the buildings, Red Rocket, Log Cabin, Bunker, etc that are purchased through the Atomic Shop to be built onto as if they were regular concrete floors? I'm using the Nuka Cola Door as a tunnel connecting my Red Rocket to my main base right now.
---
I am very picky with my bases and thats really where I spend most of my time now. Just rebuilding my base if I unlock a new feature that I find interesting. I have the Red Rocket garage connected to the Commi Bunker.
---
So is TS weapons the new meta?... Im a bloodied build and right now my B auto grenade launcher is doing 582 and my TS is doing 860.. I'm at 10% health, have nerd rage, 5x demo expert
---
Ok that doesn’t resolve the wrong nuke codes. You know like what I said in the fucking title
---
Not anymore melee is useless now!
---
Maybe they want to remind us that even a simple arrow to the knee can bring down the mightiest of warriors.
---
Yep. That's what I'm looking forward to!
---
If only they had a system like BL3 Mayhem, where you could reroll the mutations until you find a combo that fits your style, maybe in the future 🤷‍♂️
---
Everyone is dude. It takes 10x the ammo now to do damage you did before. So it sucks bad for high level players but low level or new players dont have the materials or builds for it. I think they ruined the game completely.
---
And so many people were being positive and hopeful with the damage changes. All so what, they can more easily balance the game who knows when? And knowing Bethesda, they will botch that too. Have fun being way weaker in the meantime though.
---
Awesome, thanks for the reply.
---
Have they been pretty potent in pvp in your testing?
---
Just a different generator gives 5 power per panel I think, but time of day effects nothing.
---
I noticed this in PTS but, I think it is because of constantly *not* being hidden in Spec-Ops part?
---
I don't know yet
---
And if they did rework the core design of stealth people would still be bitching about it.  Just look at this sub every single time someone comes in complaining that stealth "feels" like it's broken even when nothing has changed, people freak the fuck out.  If bethesda actually went and made it harder to sneak people would try to burn the game down.
---
Seems like they changed the budget cost for some things. I was at 9800 before the patch, now I can't put anything down.
---
I have been shooting the crap out of everyone then when they are flashing Doom style I get out a knife and pop them
---
Given my interactions with the player base for 76 I'm not surprised
---
I'm a bloodied Melee build, and did it twice, just over 8 mins each, with one other player. Perhaps I just had a lucky build for the day, but only died once in two runs. I do have Serendipity which helps block a lot of damage.
---
Yea... the problem is that having a few people decide on their own not to cheese content doesn't really work when everyone else just decides to fuck it and take the easy route.
---
Bethesda wanted this new content to provide a challenge, the sheer power of stealth builds to entirely avoid everything that makes the game challenging is a problem.
---
You didn't cheat, my roommate buys his way through most of the board. He's in the medical field and rarely has time for himself these days.
---
You forgot legacy as magic is the new obtainable legacy.. not sure legacy and magic belong in the same category as hacked but guess what everyone who has a damage build is now going to use.. this damage nerf was not to balance but make most players farm more to increase play time.. welcome to farming76
---
This sounds rough (I haven't had a chance to play yet). If what you say is true, then I'm taking off Talons and Twisted Muscles, as they're useless now. Might as well get back a bit of agility and weapon accuracy.
---
Personally, I refuse to buy ammo if it is priced higher than 1 cap per shot. If a player was using ammo factories and had the same inclination, then it does have an effect on the economy in that it discourages pricing ammo at 2+ caps. I'd say thats positive, overall.
---
But then again, I run Scrounger outside of SBQ/Earle and have the ArmCo factory from the raiders, so ammo is no longer a concern in any way.
---
I didn’t use power armor but I have a fully upgraded ironclad perk that helps. I had two others and only died once to a gutsy
---
I'm personally very much let down. One Wasteland has made next to no difference, daily ops are near broken in how badly they perform, and legendary perks is yet another mindless grind.
---
So if all your friends were jumping off bridges you would join them? I seemed to have struck a nerve calling quantum users sissies, lol...
---
🤣🤣🤣, I sure feel like one. Bushes are a man’s best friend
---
Good idea. 👍
---
One wasteland is waaaaaay overdue... but with the change from multiplicitive to additive... my black powder pistol is prolly going to go from fun novelty to useless.
---
In fact, prolly my entire haphazard build of randomness is going to need torn apart and made into a ''real'' build.
---
Seems like the C.A.M.P. budget was reduced with the patch. Only way is to Keep On Scrappin’
---
I'm believing this to be the case after researching the entirety of the Daily Ops notes, as they generally do not have time to prepare. This would be interesting to look into more detailed as to a degree, it affects certain play styles like stealth builds and stuff. Its hard to move from pure stealth to in-your-face melee aggressive.
---
I noticed a significant dmg reduction. I got stomped in the daily op, but it completely counters my build so...I need to rethink.
---
Agreed. I am really liking the legendary perk system. It feels like high level means something.
---
I just pray they don’t add the reverse of resilient, where it must be ranged attacks to kill
---
Though honestly resilient is a fucking annoying mutation.
---
As above, I really feel like this is a good change. Sneezing at enemies and killing them before makes this feel like actual play again, not god mode. We played about 6 hours. Ran Westek, Whitesprings, Behemoths, Mirelurk queens basically our meat and potatoe play. No issues at all. Combat felt good, a level 100 scorched annihilator feels tough. I personally like it, but sure some will hate it. 
---
Sidenote: rank 3 ammo factory 470 gunpowder crafted 23,000 rounds of 5mm! That's with ammosmith and super duper. Loving the legendary perks.
---
GUN BASH, DUH.  Why were you not in my life one hour ago?  
---
I made a machete and slogged my way thru.  Sigh
---
Its like 100 dollars, right? Or 150. Their money, they do what they like.
---
Oh i'm not complaining or mad. I just wanted to let people know so they don't make the mistake i did.
---
I'm level 45, did daily ops once and now I'm with 0 ammunition to my weapons. This update is terrible.
---
Yep - The gun decay is now even more of a broken glass &amp; sand coated prison dicking...
---
I just slogged through that not having any idea what is going on with the intention of, well I'll just melt everything with my M2 Browning and then run around and lightly touch everything with my sword.
---
I chased something for 3 minutes, using vats when I could hitting it with 95% chance to hit as it ran away from me constantly each time showing that I was hitting it for like 70+ damage each time.
---
Half the rest of the time the melee hits wouldn't even register on the targets.
---
Thanks Todd.
---
#**IT JUST WORKS^TM**
---
Just the news of this change back on the PTS was enough to put me off from playing
---
So you got rid of the trail fireworks glitch but didn't fix speed demon so that it actually worked with boosting reload speed?
---
So it’s possible to knock out all three in one run, correct?
---
Xbox? I can help.
---
Everyone is asking it non-stop.  People expect you to search your topic before posting or check YouTube.
---
Got 6:26 on my first run with an LFG grouo and only one of us was running melee... it’s really not *that* hard to be honest
---
Level 87 here and I agree entirely. I miss having a break with the enemies. Now I feeling like I'm wasting ammo everywhere, even The Forest.
---
I sell them as well, probably have 2 dozen badges spare
---
Westek!
---
I think instigating weapons are gonna get somewhat close to that bloody damage we used to do. Kinda wish i kept those instigating melee weapons.
---
Im actualy having trouble launching my first nuke and I'm trying to do it for monograph mine, because I have a quest.
---
The effect making you take less damage wearing sturdy, light or heavy armor, they were the best perks but got removed
---
Awaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
---
It'd be cool, but the one for fallout 4 was a mess and barely usable.
---
Maybe one day I’ll be able to put together a proper armour set like that, but until that day I’ll just have to settle with a second backpack.
---
Running a small business comes with a wealth of challenges.
---
DUDE! Fast travel glitch is finally gone.
---
The electric one for PA is actually really good cus of its hidden effect but it may be a bug.
---
The same can be said for every update.  After you get the gear/plans you want, there’s no reason to repeat anything in the game.
---
I personally walked out of the ops I did with more ammo and aid than I walked in with, so I think that’s a matter of build/gear efficiency.  It’s designed for groups of high level players.  Like anything else, prioritizing combat ability will make your experience much easier.  I don’t know your build, but I optimize mine.  Having to stretch my finger to reach T for bash was the hardest part.
---
Despite being nerfed hard, melee is still doing fine. Most enemies are a 1-2 shot, 3 if it’s something particularly tanky. Not bloodied or anything, no chems. 
---
Got 8:11 on my first run, didn’t even take any legendary perks yet.
---
You’d think a person would be weaker after working out until the next day at least
---
Yeah, I also had the opposite of fun doing the Burrows solo, especially as a heavy weapons PA build. I could knock down health easy, but I had to run up to every robot and give it a final bash with my 50 cal while being shot from all directions... it was really annoying. Also it felt like the spawn rate was way too high for a solo player; it probably doesn’t adjust for number of players, which feels really punishing. Overall it’s Vault 94 raids all over again.
---
15k atoms, like $120? Damn, that guy must have real money to waste it.
---
That was super weird, everyone suddenly showed up right after I posted lol. Thanks for the tip, threw the shotty perks back on and landed the B!
---
Crafted one. Pointless. Its just a 1 star and its exatly like the gutter from quest but it is red and yellpw and has a star now instead of not. Wooo
---
The early game is just pistols rifles and melee, the three weapons that got hit the hardest by today's nerf! Not to mention enemies scaling to them meaning they can't level up on weaker enemies anymore!
---
Ok buddy, ima go play 76 and have fun.
---
All the you tubers have legacy weapons so they don't care.. or their support team does just out of the shot.. they also can scream "I need 308, and a bag with 5k rounds lands at their feet".. I tried that once on area mic and someone started punching me 😁
---
Hey, Nuka Crypt is now updated, just now, clear your cache if you don't see new dates and codes
---
😂
---
Fuck thanks for the reply.
---
Something can be a challenge without completely devastating a build.
---
Im not AS mad, but only due to the fact that I’d only grinded 2/5 SS UNY pieces so far. If I’d just finished a full set I’d be PISSED.
---
Well put some perks man, you will have to move a bunch of perk points later anyway, don't make your life harder than it should be... 😑
---
Anyway, i feel that complainers are still gonna be mad whatever we will say. I think i'm just gonna stay away from those type of topics and go work on my Pistol build in a couple of days. Im sure it's not that terrible. ✌
---
I’m a commando AA build and I was just having fun hitting them with a mole miners instigating 40% faster swipe speed. My teammates would shoot them down and I’d finish them off
---
Earl is pretty tough now though, went through 4000 2mm and 15 cores
---
Summerville has a house with ~200 burned books in it.  Use that to reset your loot list
---
Had 20k atoms I work night shifts so I get a hour a day to play
---
Damn, thats rough, thanks for the reply.
---
If you place a foundation tile just outside the resource gathering machine (Junk pile, Copper, Lead, etc) you can snap other floors onto it and they will clip inside the resource machine, allowing you to build a garage/house/whatever around them
---
And what is wrong with one shotting mobs? How does that affect you? If you thought the game was too easy, you could’ve easily nerfed your own build to do less damage.
---
Dude.  I need Squirrel Scouts and the new challenges that come with it.  Hands down, the funnest addition they’ve introduced besides the dreaded “revive in water” challenge.
---
Yeah, I sortof feel that an "aggro" effect would be best so the levels of perception sortof moves around and can sortof accomidate everyonexs playstyle. Facing metal robots melee only though was goddamn bonkers and was pretty challenging. Teams are the best way for sure.
---
No no no, don't go back to melee. As a highly specialized bloodied unarmed, my damage was cut 75% today. Time to rethink everything 🤦
---
I used all of mine just to get rid of them the day before it was discovered...
---
Yeah this games enemy balance is actually all over the place. Some barely do any damage, and others kill you quickly. High ranking Gutsies are one of those enemies that will shred you for some reason.
---
Yeah my camp used to get attacked pretty regularly by low level scorched, protectrons, or mongrels, but my turrets were able to clear those out fairly quickly with the occasional the exception of a scorched that fired on my camp out of range of the turrets. Now every time I come back to the camp I have walls destroyed and crops down because there are level 50+ enemies spawning inside of my fucking floor
---
Patch 22 implemented a redefined damage calculation which saw a huge nerf to bloodied melee weapons.
---
My bloodied flame thrower does more damage now :)
---
So far, I'm finding instigating and power attack to be the two most effective legendary skills on melee and unarmed weapons. The two together work very nicely. For general killing of trash mobs, this seems to be sufficient. As for tougher enemies, like daily ops bosses... I'm still working on that.
---
Go to Watoga for the BoS Quest
---
Steel Dawn is coming in the next game update but not all at once, it will be spread over several patches
---
Apparently, the quest has difficulty with PLM.
---
Was waiting for this update to make more of the map relevant.  No more good lower level weapons that I cant use.
---
Not to sound stupid, but how do I scale back the enemy levels now? Since the update enemies are scaled to character level it appears. I can't figure out how to change it.
---
Vault 94 would be cool again
---
It benefits players?
---
Then it's sure Beth will patch it next update.
---
Patch 23: we have fixed an issue that let players increase their strength indefinitely for 30 min with the weight bench.
---
👋
---
I think 3-4 months is being hopeful. I don't think they'll ever change it
---
That makes more sense why I feel like the combat changes dont effect me. I'm sorry that it's that bad that blows. I'm a heavy gun build I dont see much difference
---
Speaking of glitches, I have all of the subtitles options on and during the Burrows OP a lot of the subtitles are glitched with string IDs merged into the text.
---
Did this come as a a plan or just the outfit?
---
Why? That's not comparable at all. You can have as much money as you want IRL. You can only have 30k in game
---
"mY bUiLd IsN't ViAbLe NoW!!!"
---
Melee gives random ammo.  Use gun bash in Ops if you want the ammo
---
Remember the rule of thirds for pricing. 1/3 is your expense for raw materials, 1/3 is your expense for labor, and 1/3 is your profit.
---
I think some people are having a hard time figuring out the mutations and by the time they do its too late
---
He’s level 60. He’s holding his own. He is older than Covid.
---
Melee is most certainly not dead. Weaker, but not dead.
---
Instigating, power attack bonus, these things are your friend.
---
I wish the same guys who made the Pipboy fo4 android app made one for 76.
---
Yeah if they did I would really hope they got a better app team and integrated better than the fo4 one lol you're right that was a shit show
---
Oh, okay. I hadn't had any PTS time, so hadn't seen them. Hope they come out with a later I patch.
---
I'm so happy the Tesla issue has been fixed though it as well as every other fix should've just been right from the launch of this game, the rebalance isn't bad as a bloodied sneak commando
---
I didn’t read at all; I accidentally joined the op when trying to use my map to fast travel, but didn’t close the spam windows first. Thought “eh, whatever, I’ll try it out”. Burned all my stims and more ammo than I’d have cared for while getting frustrated why I couldn’t sneak. Assumed the robots were just flat-out immortal and that maybe stealth was simply made more difficult and I just had to try harder to get around them.
---
I’m okay with the mode and its particulars, even if it isn’t something I find fun at all, but I can’t stand the pop-up window on the map.
---
Oh I see, thanks!
---
A decrepit version of the whitespring resort interior would be cool
---
Hell, I skipped the scrip grind after getting burned out from seemingly hundreds of bad Mmurgph rolls and straight up bought a couple of god-tier Bloodied weapons from an ebay seller for real money....last month, mere days before the nerfs were released onto the PTS. 
---
Joke was on me I guess; lesson learned about trying to buy my way out of rng that changes its meta 2 years into the game.... 😭😂💀
---
In ops, you have to use melee to do the final kill and I wonder if that makes the ammo random.
---
Difficulties? Yes, both my runs today my group beat the elder timer on, but only had the rare reward chance for 1 run because beth has to slow down the players.
---
The receiver things? You can only have one of them active and progressing at a time
---
Agreed. One Wasteland in particular is nice since you no longer have to worry about legendaries being too low level.
---
Amen to that, i want some scout faction love!!
---
Same here. I got this sad feeling of "a sponge trying to kill other sponges" frustration.
---
Ah. I thought there was a “reroll” it (like how you can server hop to get a different location for the daily quests), since I’ve seen people mention having different ones.
---
Tank killer effects pistols now too.
---
👋🏻
---
That was really buggy so hopefully if it's them they have stepped up their game lol
---
Step 1 can easily be replaced with bring PA and run electric absorbtion. Literally sat still and all they was heal me during the uplink parts. Was so easy it was a jokeee.
---
I have the same issue. Went to put the new weight bench down and discovered I'm over budget. I've already deleted like 5-6 things and still at max budget. (sad face emoji)
---
Your energy reminds me of Nathan from Misfits, but without the charm
---
\#DailyOpsSuck
---
If you're taking 6 hits to kill a ghoul, something is very, very wrong with your build or weapon.  A simple Instigating Deathclaw Gauntlet can still one-shot many mobs.
---
Ah that one yeah, you can build them higher to to fully surround it, leaving just the animated part sticking out, great for protecting it.
---
I was hoping this included collectrons so I could build in the sky with foundations again.
---
It feels like a new game in a positive way.
---
You’re going to absolutely love Vault 94, especially the residential area.  I can only assume they’ll leave all areas accessible instead of choosing one of the railroaded raid layouts.  I ran those raids a hundred times and I’m sure I’ll get lost.
---
One wasteland makes it tedious to do anything. Rewards from crap events are still crap, but now nothing is "easy", and everything is an ammo sink.  
---
Not enjoying the changes so far. 
---
Sneak is less useful now that everything is high level and sees through it.
---
The "nerfed" builds seem like the only viable ones, my decent but not optimal build is useless now when everything spawns high level. Sick of level 50 molerats already.
---
Bruh I put all the survivability perks on and converted to a heavy built and i am UNSTOPPABLE
---
Mald lol
---
As a predominantly solo player that’s another challenge ... No issue with multiplayer, enjoy running into random people and teaming up for big takedowns like SBQ, but I enjoy the autonomy of being able to solo most things. Probably why I’m a stealth build, which isn’t really made for team play ... but when they reduce my build to nothing and all but force you to join a team ... loses some of the magic for me.
---
Nope, my first couple attempts to ft today didnt work
---
And it’s such a pain in the .... loading it up all in again, setting prices etc
---
Mines still there so is my partners
---
even for legendaries?
---
I have a gauss rifle, if you are a sniper the weapon is great. In VATS though lol.. By the time you fully charge a shot you will be getting ready for sleepy time
---
Oof people and their videos 🤦
---
I sure do love missing out on the ACP instance with the team I’m on because I have to make 3-10 attempts to even fast travel there 😭
---
Exactly how I feel! Also its just a sad reminder every time I see the squirrel scouts banner locked in the build menu 😥
---
Good thing they now have an ammo factory...gunna need lot more bullets...I do feel like a lvl 20 again looking to get a spiked board. Damn.
---
Exactly lol.
---
The plushies are a part of the revamped Treasure Hunter Mole Miner rewards. No clue yet if living Wanamingos are coming in a future patch, but that would be pretty cool.
---
Lol, dafuq?  I replied to the wrong post I guess, my bad.  Some dude was talking about scrapping two wires and still being overbudget.  Disregard.
---
Full health PA builds are the most fun
---
Full set of troubleshooters for 75% damage reduction, or some Astoundingly Awesome Tales for 25% less damage from robots helps. I have a full set, but didn't feel I needed to use it for this, played as bloodied range.
---
My powrfist was doing over 500, now it only does 200
---
My megasloth didn't level up, he died :(
---
Pc or console?
---
&gt;Any chance they'd refund it? .
---
If its your first refound they will 100% refund, you will also keep the item you bought
---
Yeeeeep.
---
Agreed. This patch revitalized the game. It was much needed.
---
I noticed this with my Gatling Plasma. Do you know if it’s a bug? Or a feature?
---
Try killing a scavenger with a paddle ball lol
---
How do you get legendary perks? Can they be acquired from perk card packs?
---
But in eso decent build can be any weapon type. In here various weapon types have been nerfed into the ground and just can't be used for that anymore.
---
I- bro you've all got to be trolling there is no way you're actually this much of a bot
---
Are there photos of the rewards yet?
---
What...on PS4?
---
Yeah ? So if I am in the area first, won't all wolves be level 50 ? Or doesn't matter, when I look at a wolf it will be level 50 and they will see a level 5 wolf ?
---
Just the outfit
---
I was hoping to turn my stealth character into a stealth archer. Guess that's never happening.
---
Yep.
---
I liked it, but I have a 2H melee build so I lucked out big time. Scorchbeasts shit on me from above all day long though.
---
I run a shotgun/heavy build and I actually feel like I'm doing equal to more damage on most mobs. Broadly though, my main weapon is the gauss shotgun so eh, things continue to go boom.
---
Yup, after I posted this, I read the patchnotes and almost cried when I read it 😭😭
---
Good luck finding one, my advice would be to have one weapon with the same legendary effect on yourself,  as the rng will most likely give you a weapon with the same effect
---
Edit: sorry for bad english
---
I could be wrong, but I don't think it varies by server.  Pretty much everyone is talking about the same issue (needing to melee/bash), but I haven't read anything about the other ones.
---
Really? I’ve had no problem whatsoever
---
“Assume no one reads anything” - a guy with a PhD told me this once.
---
Enemies still easily wipe out turrets because they also scale!
---
DU, TSE, VATS crit bullets.  And it sucks.
---
My build was one hitting most things, ghouls, super mutants, now it sucks
---
2 guaranteed yoghurt drops
---
And there's a rare chance that brahmin milk will drop but idk if it's 1% or 2%
---
I just shoot them. It just works.
---
They're all working okay for me on PS4, sorry to say.
---
I tried a bunch of combos of 2 and 3 star guerrilla cards and have a few different 10mm autos. Seemed to be changing as it should in all cases.
---
BTW in nerd rage and 3x2* guerrilla cards my V3325 says 75 dmg but my QE25 is 99 with demo expert x5. What a difference. I wasn't a huge fan of explosive on pistols before, but it's going to be important now, I think.
---
And a better range, enemies don't even need to be in render range to shoot my turrets!
---
 Must be bugged for me sold over 5k work of stuff and didnt contribute to it
---
A crappy feature that needs to be addressed
---
So far, all I have noticed is that I should change my shop name from "Edda's Ammo Emporium" to something else. I get the feeling the ammo market is going to vanish very quickly.
---
Got just under the worse time with a bloodied melee build, (lvl 281) with my friend in power armor who just started playing for the first time earlier this week at level 21. 
---
He surprisingly helped out quite a bit by constantly picking me back up after being gunned down by Gutsies. XD He in fact didn't die once. &gt;  \_&gt;
---
Guess I need to stop resisting using my power armor so much.
---
Loved the ferocity of that boss fight, and am very happy that they changed the respawn point to not be entirely at the beginning of the map entirely. XD Also loved the change in character model. Was like oh sweet a Sentry boss fight sweet which suddenly turned to sheer horror when I realzied, Oh sheet thats no sentry bot!  
---
I think my bloodied Faster Swing Speed Cultist Dagger took a much bigger hit damage wise than I was expecting. Really hope they up the damage for them later on.
---
Ni, the unlocked card slots are shared account wide, but card levels are locked to each character
---
Wow another post complaining so weird
---
The queen fight runs similar to what it used to be. Problem is Daily Ops. 90% of the builds are useless there, starting with all stealth-based builds.
---
I heard someone say they got cheese but they couldn't provide proof
---
Shit, maybe I got it then, thought it would be a plan drop. Didn't bother to check my apparel.
---
All 3 of my Fixers are like this now.
---
They warned us multiple times to claim all rewards before the season ended. Even with the board lag, it’s not hard at all to unlock a few every day or every time you logged on and have all unlocked fairly rapidly. You simply missed out on your own rewards due to not wanting to deal with the board lag.
---
I hate it cause not a lot of people even use melee! Why is this even a thing? It's an inconvenience and drags it on far longer than it needs to be
---
Same, sucks all the fun out :/ now I’ll have to waste more bullets and stims to kill enemies. Guess it’s good I haven’t played since a week after season 1 started. Just tired of grinding for stuff
---
No way TSE is better than BE (if you're bloodied).  I would believe it's better than AAE though.
---
What you having trouble with? Just completing it?
---
I completely hear you, and if it's made your experience lacking then I'm sorry. But I've been rocking a pistol with grenades using a high charisma, int and luck, and this has been a blast so far today. I've been having a blast with the daily ops, running around throwing dynamite then pistol whipping the group. I carry an instigating .44 and a executioners .44 and theres now group content that I actually do well in instead of just applying tenderizer and empath. From playing around, the forest and toxic valley are still a cake walk. It might say lvl 50 instead of 5, but it still dies in one pistol headshot, haven't explored everywhere yet, but so far I'm having a blast.
---
It can't fail. Vault raids already failed, so Daily Ops *really* can't afford to be a failed event as well. That would be a bad look.
---
Damm that is disappointing, oh well thanks
---
not for some, but for one very particular - AP rounds that penetrate both your armor and your ass
---
Been having this bug since the big update came out. Was fine before.
---
Whats in watoga?
---
I'm level 82. I'm now burning through ammo and stimpaks like 3x faster than before. I'm really struggling to understand who this update is supposed to appeal to? This just fucks everyone who hasn't been playing the game 24/7 since the beta.
---
Workshops are PvP zones. Granted, what he said is stupidly cringe.
---
Yeah someone mentioned this way earlier today. CAMP budgets are bonked. This also happened way back around patch ... 12? as well... its an unintentional side effect of something they did in the patch. They usually get it fixed within a week or so during a hot fix. In the meantime yeah either scrap a LOT of stuff or wait for the hot fix. Also, and this is really important, submit a ticket explaining the issue. They can’t fix what they don’t know, and they don’t always catch stuff here.
---
I just got clapped by a UNIT of lvl 100 super mutants with  miniguns and my good weapons tickled them, guns def need buffs or scaling as well cause damn is this a tough time for bein a casual high lvl
---
Why do you guys still play this game? What is the reward?
---
I guess the people wanting to shake up PVP got their wish, albeit in one of the crappiest ways possible.
---
Someone's gotta do it
---
you shoot them and then bash them. It's not rocket science. 
---
Also it's not meant to be easy. 
---
Also robots and resilient is a bad combo but once again. not meant to be easy. 
---
And i've done the daily ops 5 or 6 times today and only once did i see someone in power amrour. Stop being a drama queen.
---
No more one shots. Welcome to the MMO/RPG life
---
Yeah, really annoying.
---
u/Ladydevann and u/valseek the patch notes make no mention of this, what did you guys change?
---
Im actually a junkie stealth build.. but saw angry turtles video.. is best used for commando and/or heavy guns..
---
Now imagine what is was like in the before times when we had to manage 400 stash space...
---
I’m level 1k and I thought I was a high level grinding with unyielding for hours every day since beta and farming xp during double weekends...but I guess not
---
He might have done ok but as an end game build it's very underperforming  compared to a safe PA ranged build that 2-3 hit mobs, with a bloodied power fist coupled with fury (+30 melee damage) and whiskey (+6 strenght with party boy perk) i didn't one hit with a headshot a single robot during the daily op, this is complete rubbish
---
Imagine the boner you'll get when load outs are a thing.
---
I have a semi just thinking about it
---
Yea I hope they replace it with another mutation bc I’m only going to do it once per day to get the rewards when it’s that mutation
---
I've got the same thing.
---
I'm a level 450+ but I already miss the low level forest. I could break out a 10mm pistol with no pistol perks and have fun. I have died many times due to old habits. I now have fixer out at all times. No more peaceful walks in the woods.
---
The changes were probably to address other issues.
---
Communist Bunker: Objects placed on the floor of the Communist Bunker no longer appear to float.
---
Communist Bunker: The interior walls of the Communist Bunker are now hexagonal rather than cylindrical to help players more easily place wall décor.
---
It doesn't say anything about the Theremin though.
---
What's wrong with melee ?
---
1 to 2%, but you may have to skim it.  Haven’t found a Whole drop yet
---
The abandoned waste dump, where lame daily ops belong.
---
If I wanted to not shoot stuff for half xp for 8 minutes I wouldn't start up FO76; boring AF
---
Yeah I'm fine if people kill me and take my workshop, just don't be an ass about it
---
so you expected bethesda of all companies to allow you to breeze through the dailies and weeklies and events? not needing to pay real money to skip them? this sub surprises me every day still
---
Mine are much more powerful, but they still don't notice anything until after it has been attacking the base for several minutes.
---
I literally had to get up to my screen and verify I wasn't seeing things hah
---
New XP exploit? I guess we shouldn't be surprised, given how the game and gameplay has effectively been turned on its head in this patch.
---
This was a bad introduction. The only worse roll I could think of would be cryo robots in v94, since you get less cover there and the freeze/stun combo is a real pain. But the ops in general are pretty fun, and even cancer ones like this can be done once you get some practice. My best solo time today was 8:08, I broke and just went for a team, 6:47 first try even though team didn't know what was going on. We had a lvl 37 hitting everything with a ski sword, it was cute
---
Yeah...it was brutal, as a solo stealth archer who moonlights with 2 handed melee, it was pretty challenging, and I died more than 10 times fighting the final boss. 
---
My initial reaction was “well I won’t be doing this again” however now that its been more than a minute since it ended, I know I’ll just have to team up with some rando public teammates to make it better and smoother. Solo it was an ammo and chem dump.
---
It is built for team play, have part of the team using ranged weapons to beat the robots down and melee to finish, or you can simply bash them.  It is less about killing lots of them and more about surviving to complete each task until the final boss.
---
Je gat plas incinerated the last boss sub 5 seconds with bash.
---
My anti armour gatling gun could 1 shot mole miners with a headshot before the patch, I'll have to see what it does now, probably gonna take 2 or 3 shots 😥
---
I suspect Bethesda is immune that by now.
---
Yeah, im not trippin too hard tho. Some days its way bad some days it doesn't happen but it's not gamebreaking or horribly inconvenient so 🤷‍♂️
---
Works for me since I'm a melee build. But also sucks because the damage nerf means I die if my first hit doesn't kill.
---
Over a nuclear key card? If I remember correctly, the silos progress stays. So you could in fact leave and get another key card, return and launch. I wasted 3 the other day when the silos were glitched.
---
It is yeah. It was fine before the big patch so it's definitely broken
---
Energy Protocols T-65 Power armor with blocker has really helped me tank the sheer numbers of Ballistic Gutsies. I didn't die once but it took a load of stims!
---
Kept the agro off the rest of the team so they could rush in and bash them too.
---
The fact they're an entire season away is maddening. I can't wait for them.
---
but what about all those people who just HAVE to play with their friends who are level 1 and will only play for a day or two and drop it???????
---
I can only imagine for a lower level. I'm a 260 and It's frustrating me. SS armor isn't working like it use too, keeps breaking every ops mission, bloodied builds been nerfed to hell and I've went through about 200 stims and thousands of rounds of ammo just on 1 ops mission and died about 20 times doing it. I mean it is what it is but holy crap lol.
---
Yeahp. My bloodied melee weapons do very little damage. Many builds will die with this nerf. Interesting, but not pleasant. 
---
Riflemen, gunslingers, archers... They went from inferior to useless.
---
Ammo factory...you'll need it with the nerf, and def. Survival shortcut...no more dog food or water needed just lvl 1 so far is fine. Added 3 agi. Have points left but need to think more first.
---
Just to let you guys know, I just tested this.. +60 STR seems to be the max you can stack.
---
Took a little while.
---
You can purchase the ranks today.
---
I’m pretty sure all cheese is moldy....
---
yes. If a level 20 was there, they'd see it as level 20. A level 5 sees a level 5, a level 50 sees that exact same enemy as level 50 etc.
---
The only difference is that enemies in the forest cannot go above level 50. Otherwise, they could probably just do away with showing us enemy levels altogether.
---
GT- publicenemywon im in ur boat only play couple hrs a night cuz wrk
---
I hope they do a rebalance for some of the melee builds seems like some got nerfed a little too much
---
Sounds like someone probably stole his workshop from him prior to you or did you build it from scratch and he was back to take it back .. who knows .. expect people to take workshops, people are dicks ..
---
Yeah, numerous posts about it here.  Rename and it should be fine.
---
Yeah exactly, especially with the invisible super mutants (I only had them for PTS 10 Spec-Ops runs).
---
I think, being in and out of hidden affected the damage you recieve &amp; whether it triggers serpendity.
---
Depends in your existing build.  I’m melee with a high capacity backpack.   (Kills rad resistance). 
---
What Rads2 fixed that real quick,  Now I take no rads when hit by a ghoul.
---
Take one for the team makes up for decreased damage/higher level enemies.
---
Legendary luck let me change to class freak3 (I ony had 4 points before - starched genes2 and classfreak2) anbd bloody mess1
---
  Similar story with charisma. 
---
Legendary intel let me add one defense perk and one QOL perk
---
I haven't watched that yet, but I'm also Junkie's stealth.  As such, you're probably better off with either FFR or explosive (if you want to put 5 perk points into the explosive).  I think they're close, but I'd imagine explosive would pull ahead a bit with the perk points.
---
That's if you don't mind the extra wear on the gun durability, and the occasional enemy that doesn't care about your explosive damage.  Or blowing yourself up now and again.
---
Yes, I’m a level 63 and pre update I was building confidence and just strolling through the forest and gently working my way through the main and side quests. There’s no rest period! Soon enough I think the forest will feel “easy” again once we level well past 50, it sucks in the meantime though.
---
Daily ops can be fun and I like the legendary perks. I understand bloody got nerfed and needed it, but having only a third of my original damage and not being able to stealth against a now higher level enemy really feels like a drag. I can hardly imagine how it feels to be non bloodied
---
The party is over. All I had to do was go see Ward. Never had to lift a finger outside of a couple of interactions with him. Now, actually had to go out and find the damn thing, right in the middle of a level 65-75 raider camp, AND a legendary scorchbeast to boot. And btw, I never tried to exploit anything. At some point noticed that this quest item was sitting in my junk, and from then on, All I had to do to complete the Vital Equipment daily was go see Ward. Was a mystery to me, I was wondering if this happened to anyone else.
---
Indeed and it is much appreciated
---
Actually wait.. no. Each time you use it, it lasts half an hour... meaning it starts expiring. Thats what I just found. 
---
So you can possibly go higher, but realistically with the time it takes seems 60 is gonna be around as high as you can.
---
It looks a little like a frog.
---
It took me and one other person about 26 mins, multiple deaths and over a dozen stims to run it the first time but I fully expect that we'll be able to at least do the initiate level with 2 but could definitely do with more people.
---
Also the Daily Ops groups don't seem to work as intended, as people just join them and then don't do the Ops.
---
Oof! He had ditched unarmed after they hit it the first time. So it isn't his main build, so I can understand 100% how you would feel if it were yours. Sorry man!
---
You can buy ranks since day one
---
Yeah I don’t get why some people think this change to every mob is a bullet sponge and we shoot wet noodles is enjoyable. It makes everything tedious and sucks the fun out of a lot of activities. I don’t expect to one shot everything but I shouldn’t have to waste almost an entire clip from my two shot fixer from stealth. Also the fact that the regenerating life bar still hasn’t been fixed if you do too much damage too fast for the server makes this even more egregious.
---
I’m in the same boat friend, I tried to do it solo.
---
Activated a call for arms for an OPS Group and one person joined, bloodied build.
---
We both got fucking wrecked
---
I am so with you on The Deep. Like, it even fits with the whole USA vs Commies flavor we got going on with season two.
---
Interesting, thanks, I am going to test it with a lower level character of mine.
---
Im a stealth lever action/handmade build with both having TSE from 2018 (havent played in a long time). And im afraid of being a literal sponge shooter after this update
---
Bro i almost uninstalled
---
Melee itself? Nothing
---
I'm just pretty sure rando's refuse to read the prep screen based on the few I joined that sat there blasting robots for 0 damage for a solid 20 minutes.  So once mobs can die from bullets I think those players will actually be able to help
---
I'm loving my pistols with the new tank killer addition. Just need the perks to go with it now.
---
Full health assault
---
Sweet, hopefully we get double weekends cause I'd love a long break again lol
---
It's really needed if the next season starts within a week of the last ending
---
Sure
---
One Specific Wasteland
---
This set of armor is exactly why I have never and probably will never be able to fight Earl... lol
---
Thats rough. Its a shame you couldn't get on earlier to start the download
---
I need to seriously rework each build I have now. I spend more time messing about in this game lately than actually killing things. Farming XP food, finding the right weapons, trading etc.
---
Screw trying to solo it with my bloodied build... Even playing bloodied against the robots is absolutely brutal.
---
There is a current working budget exploit, that was working in PTS. Just remember seeing it work for patch 22 in an exploit group
---
I know, I've been session hopping all day trying to find it and get the weekly done lol
---
I’m with you in this.  Apparently Bethesda is punishing Bloodied/Unyielding/and stealth builds for being king for two years.  They want to force everyone into being a tank.  I see your feedback and up vote. They messed with too much too fast.  I’m fine with the resilient enemies, that’s no big deal.  Having enemies know where you are the second you spawn in even without moving?  Terrible design.
---
I’m sure I’ll find away around Bethesda’s forced nerfs sooner or later.
---
Yeah I’m not a fan of one wasteland. I could probably live with the enemy scaling if they didn’t do the damage nerf.
---
I mean you don't have melee the whole thing. Just have 2-3 shooters and 1-2 finisher offers. I found it much easier to just run to the objectives that waste time killing waves of enemies.
---
Giving the enemies special abilities was a start, but not the one that completely puts stealth out of the picture.
---
I've got a TSE250 and it says 136. I don't have enough perception to use that gun though, miss too many shots. And wow my old lvl35 TSE is at 103, and it's just hardened semi-auto. Well this is good to know at least. May have to get some endurance with the legendary perks and add fireproof so I can shoot from closer range. Interesting. Cheers.
---
Wow. So if someone's opinion is different than yours they're a drama queen? Not everyone plays the game the way you do.
---
And now that Daily Ops are in the hands of the entire player base, Bethesda needs to hear the feedback. It's basic: the event seems geared for specific build type. A build that myself and a large portion of the player base does not use. 
---
If you read my post instead of knee-jerking your way to the comments, you would see that I did not suggest removing it or modifying it.
---
Shame their damage got nerfed I to the ground, along with rifles and melee!
---
Tried to build a poster for the daily score challenge. 
---
After scrapping a mutfruit, two carrots, one corn, one melon, and the exact same poster that I’m now trying to rebuild, I’m still over budget apparently. No ammo factories, etc. 0% stored.
---
Would be nice to have some way to know exactly how far over budget we supposedly are, rather than having to delete an unknown number of objects that may not be able to be placed again.
---
Edit: also tried scrapping one of the white locker stash boxes, still over budget.
---
I couldn't even get that far. No one on any of the servers seemed interested.
---
Same, at least until it gets "adjusted" back to a sane level. I now understand why so many people often comment that they don't play their own game, though.
---
Did it in PA within 30 minutes, got a 2★ Bloodied ffr.308 MG. I'm solo.
---
Ahahaha nicely done, might have to add that to the guide, but remember, this is for new people who are new to the game and do ops
---
Beat it sweet cheeks!
---
Right, can't really be mad, just a bit disappointed they fixed this, but assholes are still melting the queen with hacked and magic weapons Bethesda can't be Fing bothered to address.
---
Magic actually does more damage now than before as Bethesda seems to have fixed the bug where the SBQ and Earle started to ignore damage if too many people shot at them!
---
Yeah this is kind of silly.
---
I was hoping that legacy items would get the hardest hit to try and bring them in line with the rest of the weapons in the game
---
Just since B E T A...
---
Yeah, I just don’t know if it’s worth it. This is my favorite build. I’m sad I’m going to be forced to change it so much if I want to keep playing.
---
Angry Turtle made a solo guide if anyone needs it-
---
https://youtu.be/zaTj9OdaVAg
---
c ya later crocollosus
---
If your in PA, electric absorbtion for sure. Pretty much makes energy damage from most sources absolutely nothing while healing you and filling your cores.
---
It does. Then you have five slots left over
---
How much did Bethesda pay you to write this post? Lol
---
I don't think that's designed to be a run solo, is it? Either way, I'd eventually figure it out. 😁
---
Nice! Pulled a Furious 25/25 handmade from her this sale myself. A few other gems, but this handmade for sure was great.
---
Lol have fun with your grinding
---
User name checks out.
---
Just pick what you want.
---
First time I tried, I spent 20mins trying to find the uplink, not finding, looking online for a map, then realizing that it spawned in an inaccessible location.
---
Server hopped and tried again and just finished solo-ing the op, took me like 20mins. 6 of it still trying to find that first uplink.
---
Was quite annoying.
---
Bashing to kill didn't work most of the time, and doing it in PA meant that most robots were shorter than me. And when I did hit them, more than half the time it didn't register the melee and had to chase them down again and bash again.
---
Used a Vampire Gauss Minigun to stay alive, the damage calc change also included the enemy too, an eye bot shot me for 5% of my HP through PA.
---
Boss took like \~500 rounds of 2mm EC, I'm just glad it didn't have the death star laser.
---
So, solo, not worth it.
---
btw, i was running bloodied PA heavy guns, and gave up the bloodied part and just used a vamp gun and full health to stay alive.
---
I think elder achievement absolutely doable solo. Only thing that's holding me down is waiting for that bar to fill up. Takes too long when you are doing it solo and missed that 8 minute mark by 10 seconds or something
---
Born Survivor works wonders for my solo 12 minute 47 second run. I used a Vampire Plasma Caster and I am in 51b PA.
---
I’m asking more specifically about the legendary perks that are tied to increasing SPECIAL benefits. But the insight is appreciated regardless.
---
Indeed
---
Bye dude, nice know you
---
You have to adapt to those daily ops mutation combinations and enemy types by changing your perks and by gearing accordingly. Getting troubleshooters armor set (even 1\*) will make any ops with robots extremely easy to solo. Another good adjustment to your items would be to get vampires weapon. Especially so if you are using fast firing weapons or a shotgun.
---
I went with ammo factory 3, follow thru 3, per 2, agi 2, str 3 workin on levelling up for the 6th will probably be funky duds or luck but i may leave funky duds in place of ammo factory and spend two coins to swap when its time to craft ammo. 
---
Been running bloodied stealth commando/pa heavy guns on same toon and had to put main damage perks for both weaps at 2-2-2. New perks allowed me to bump them to 3-3-3 so pretty much just swapping sneak-&gt;dodgy and serendipity -&gt; bloody mess to go between builds.
---
It was super easy with a full health PA build and a Vampire heavy weapon.
---
Manhunt feels like trying to do Corvega in Fallout 4, survival immersive mod.
---
I haven't finished downloading, but I'm choosing luck as well because my SPECIAL right now is 15, 1, 8, 4, 3, 14, 11, so I figure I waste less level ups dropping luck to 10 for agility to 15 and get my luck to 15 as well with the legendary. 15 luck would be nice for this patch to deal with the damage changes. Personally, planning on incorporating critical savvy 3 and at least better criticals 1 into my build with these extra luck points. Next I'm thinking the AoE melee legendary or the damage chems one, but we'll see if other people deem them worthy first.
---
Just you and the t-rex with those grabby arm things.
---
Wrong.
---
1 person requesting others to join isn't a mass exodus...it's performative attention seeking.
---
Bye Felicia.
---
My problem was on PS4 was that switching weapons dropped my frame rates to nothing for 2 seconds. I ended up just bashing them with my gauss minigun.
---
Not sure thats what beth said for reasoning when everyone was outraged.
---
That mod does not exist.
---
Can't feel you legs tingly?
---
Except for those level 50 mole rats!
---
Nah, dude. You're just bitching. There's a difference between giving feedback and a whiny, emotional post about how hard something was for you.
---
Gave it a go with a public group but only one other person showed up. I’m a bloodied heavy gunner, no PA. I managed to not die, had to revive my partner a time or two though. Damn ballistic gutsys hit hard. I think we managed 16 minutes but I feel like lots of it was spent running around (because I always get lost in the Burrows tbh). Never could have hit 8 minutes though.
---

---
I honestly never came across that bug, never had framerate problems during events at all, even when tesla rifles were used.
---
This is what happens when you make your character with all the eggs in one basket.
---
Oh yea well you want attention because you play fallout76
---
What is going on?  Did the new update ruin your game experiencet this much that  you've decided to quit?
---
A lot of then are awful. I picked up the one that makes enemies explode when shit by a ranger weapon, but I find it pretty rare to actually get enemies grouped up enough to make any real impact. 
---
The infiltration one also seems really out of place considering how useful it is. One perk and you basically free up 6 more.
---
you should try hiding in porta-potties, quite fun. Just place your CAMP around a corner/hidden and place down a toilet and then hid e in it ( I have a blueprint with three lined up to make it seem more realistic.).
---
I then spend my entire time people watching in photomode. (The camera can zoom a surprising amount). Made it to top 5 several times, once with two friends hiding in the same toilet that wasn't even in a normal spot, it was on the side of a river because the zone ended up in the forest.
---
Meyleigh*
---
Thanks
---
I know it's meant as a joke, but for everyone else reading this, that's not an actual combination you can get for DOps. 
---
And, once you figure out that you can gun bash the resilient enemies to death, it's not that bad. Freezing Robots in Valley Galleria, on the other hand... shudder.
---
The combat rifle skins on the Fixer was a pleasant surprise! Now thats service!
---
The game sucks so badddd
---
It takes a while and you have to fight off groups of Ghouls until the named one spawns.
---
She totally had the Death Star laser for me. Hmmm that’s so weird.
---
Yeah I've got pretty long arms always had a few inches comparing reach when sparring with friends.
---
Well thank for explaining to me how I feel and how my brain works. I was really worried that I would never find a twelve year old to sort all of that out.
---
None at all
---
It's not that bad.  I went in solo with my lever action and spear.  Burned a lot of stimpacks and died a lot, but I LOVED that at least the respawn is quick so you're right back in.  The boss was a pain in the butt but I took it down.  Did I get the big 8-minute loot?  Of course not, but I was able to scout out what we needed to do so when I was teamed up later, I knew just what to do.
---
Biggest tip:  Keep moving.  And in the last room, make sure you focus on the marked enemies and run past the others.
---
So glad they implemented this. Was hoping for more buffs
---
Four out of Five doctors agree....
---
Enclave is boring AF.
---
For now I found unplugging it and then plugging it back in works.
---
So that’s where Wallace ran off to.
---
Im commando and it feels stronger? My alt commando feels like its hitting like my main does pre patch.
---
My bloodied Black Powered rifle was dealing 3.8k damage per shot... Now it's only dealing 800ish... :(
---
Haha look, it's another one of those players that's crying because their EZ button got taken away from them.
---
I thought it was quite obvious. Not much to choose from if you are running a sneak build
---
I am a high health build myself. Don't feel to different to me, although I am a level 433.
---
Me too! Great step in the right direction!
---
this, some chump must have already bought the rank ups lmao
---
Gotta be the worst one to start on for solo players. It was a nightmare switching between ranged and melee.
---
Yup their fix made all the other melee weapons shit too!
---
I don't understand why people do this. It ruins the surprise of getting items. And people wonder why people complain about nothing being new.
---
Edit: To each their own. I never said people shouldn't do it, just I don't know why. I hope you all enjoy what you enjoy :)
---
On wednesdays we wear pink. YOU CANT SIT WITH US!
---
I gave a middle finger to this op after 15 minutes of endless death and just sprinted through the whole thing.  Didn’t kill or attack any of the robots.  My build has my AP maxed and I barely use AP when I run so I can essentially out run the mobs until the boss.  Not what Bethesda wants, but hey you screw with my stealth build, I ignore your dungeon rules
---
Well done, sir!
---
How ironic lol. This patch was meant to make things more accessible for lowbies.
---
This one is likely more of a melee friendly one, at least the endless robots.
---
Whack Whack next robot.
---
Am I just misunderstanding something? Aren't the Daily OPs randomized with the enemies, mutations, and location?
---
Why are people crying to the point of threatening to uninstall?
---
It was a shitty roll for the OP today.
---
TODAY.
---
Check again tomorrow instead of screaming how Bethesda ruined everything ever?
---
When I was with friends we did 2 shooters and 1 "lawnmower" (VSS knuckles) while I ran ahead to start objectives asap while they play catch up. (I know the burrows better than they do). Cleared elder at 7:14 (I'm sure we can do better)
---
With randoms, I  ran objectives and gun bashed what was in my way,  only to watch them fighting the same few enemies mag dumping for 0's, not even trying to melee/bash
---
Definitely the path of least resistance.  You don’t have to worry about much.
---
Stay classy
---
What did you find difficult about today’s op?
---
I’m a bloodied build and I ran it twice with randos got was 9mins first attempt and second was 6 and a half minutes. I went down once the entire 2 runs and that was only because I was getting greedy with damage. First round we didn’t do so well because I was running around killing enemies not standing on the points but I quickly worked out what I was doing wrong and adapted.
---
TBH it wasn’t as difficult as I thought it would be, though I run a few damage reduction or avoiding perks and I’ve got full SS armor.
---
You shouldn't need to completely change your build to participate in an event, to convert a stealth build into a tank build would take a total rework of perk/special layout,  weapons and armor. A player with maxed agility, +1a/ sneak uny shadowed armor , and all the sneak perks should at least have SOME chance to be in caution.
---
There's nothing I love seeing more than The Moth getting love....
---
And the Boringhood of Steel and the Military Pron Circle Jerkists Enclave getting none.
---
You don't have to do the whole thing melee, just finish them off when they glow orange with a melee strike or weapon bash.
---
Unfortunately as a dedicated EXP build, I'll lose more EXP per x (time) now with this update- because of the harder enemies &amp; related damage nerf.
---
Pre patch: 20 minutes = +1 level.
---
I am level 745
---
But hopefully I can find a way to beat my 20 minute speed runs, though! With lunch boxes now a buyable item.....
---
Well it is boring for one in my opinion. And I have no idea how I could possibly nerd my character as I use no weapon perk cards or any resistance ones. The only ones I use are the cheaper travel, less hunger/thirst, string back etc. 
---
Nothing wrong with 1 shot kills but it makes for little challenge. I for one am glad the game is harder and now more enjoyable, but to each their own.
---
Still is today!
---
&gt;I don’t think it really improved anything at all.
---
First Bethesda game?
---
But $300 for a Theremin is way too expensive for a multi-billion dollar company... /s
---
Just my luck that I bought a 2 Star Quad Faster Fire Rate Crossbow a few hours ago. I wonder if the Faster Fire Rate works on the Crossbow. 
---
Thanks again Keiji.
---
lol true I totally thought I was going to finish it, because that’s what I doooooo. 
---
Until she showed up. 😭
---
I know, I'm just holding off until tomorrow as I focused on getting my weekly challenges done today.
---
It really only frees up 6 if you were always keeping Pick Lock and Hacker active. I think most players tend to only activate those cards when they need to or for some period of time. If you always kept them active then yeah, Infiltrator is quite a game changer
---
But also yes, you only get one type a day, which is why they're called daily ops.
---
They were legit the only perks that looked good to me lol
---
I had one run today when the beacon was stuck at x0 for over ten minutes.  I stood next to it, on it, behind it. Nothing. Then after about ten minutes, during which I destroyed like 100 bots, it suddenly jumped to 100%. I ran ops like 5 times, and it only happened once.
---
1 person = 40 ore
---
2 people = 80 ore
---
3 people = 120 ore
---
People just need to spend 2mins getting ore
---
This isn’t an airport. You don’t have to announce your departure.
---
Fortuitous post.
---
I just did my run around harpers ferry collecting loot from super mutants &amp; waddled to where Wallace used to be and panicked because he is gone &amp; I'm over encumbered something fierce
---
That’s just the quest. You are at the DMV after all.
---
They didn’t...? I just genuinely enjoy the patch and it met my expectations. I was never a bloodied build so I don’t care about that, and I’m used to bullet sponge enemies from other games
---
My bloodied flamethrower deals more damage than my B-DCG which is great for Spec-Ops.
---
But I miss how it use to be..
---
I just got off work a bit ago, so not sure of true potency. I normally run lone wander but that might change soon. Damage wise I'm almost always at damage cap. So there are diminishing returns for envesting there for me.
---
And now so do I...
---
Pistols and rifles are also broken.
---
It's absolutely insane...they just got this huge influx of people from xbox gamepass. Then they make the game way harder, lol. They deserve to have a max exodus.
---
Bro...I was am a mutated unyielding user with 32 strength pre-food buff and I was one shorting everything except the two bosses without stealth and zero damage cards
---
I'm a full health shotgun build lvl 187 and I soloed it but it was hard and I died a few times. LMG at the end.  Gutsys still hit hard
---
I did that. But Blocker needs to stay, since you can be ambushed and killed by molerats now.
---
I got unstoppable monster and bear arm, but the Vfss guitar sword is my only available weapon while in PA.
---
Has the drop a skinned gun and it disappears been fixed?
---
Good points. Thanks for your insight
---
Well DUH. But when enemies in daily ops have one million perception it's literally impossible to sneak at all even if you are fully specced with perfect perks, armor and weapons. It makes any stealth builds completely un-useable which is the definition of an unbalanced game.
---
You should be able to run a fairly viable melee and shotgun build with minimal perk swapping, and it'll help you build ammo reserves.
---
I used to do a loop around Harper’s Ferry, kill everything and make the daily 1400 caps with Wallace all in one spot.  It was very easy and convenient, but they really needed to do something with the Berkeley Springs station.  Makes sense to me.
---
Depends on your build and how many points you have.  I had about 1060, so I moved some points around and put 5 in luck, 5 in strength and 3 in perception.  That let me max my heavy/melee/rifleman/commando perk cards.  Then I added Ammo Factory 3, Taking one for the team 1 and Follow through 3.  I'm sure I will change things as I figure out what works and what is trash.
---
I think I ended up with 14,12,6,4,5,15,13 (I put a lot of crit/luck perks)
---
This is where evasive perk card has saved my butt so many times against these devil spawns!
---
I am pretty happy with them.
---
As A PA build it was quite easy
---
Well I’m on PC as well and it was working as intended.
---
That just means they've got increased perception and I don't think every DO will feature piercing gaze, though I don't know for sure.
---
Honestly I’m still one hitting most enemies the only difference is now I get more XP. It’s just nice I don’t have to run the same loops to get XP now.
---
How did you kill the boss? My vampire heavy machine gun did almost zero damage.
---
Why put it in there if you don’t want it to sell? Lol up your prices if you don’t want that much business
---
Nice, that’s a lot of thought put into working with both of your builds.
---
Modified files?
---
I bought like 10 from a player vendor 1-200 caps each for 3\*
---
Don't wax philosophical about theoretical abilities that bethesda could add to enemies that would totally make it harder for stealth builds but without actually affecting stealth builds.
---
It doesn't matter what abilities you add to buff them if you never need to fucking interact with them in the first place.
---
End game damage is fine, unless you used rifles, pistols or melee.
---
Early game you're screwed as pistols rifles and melee are all you get!
---
It says to use melee weapons, I shot over 500 5mm bullets, didn't do much damage, its all Bethesda fault, stupid damage rebranded, games unplayable now 😡
---
I did it solo on lvl 45, it took me \~40 minutes, \~3k rounds of 308 and 10mm ammunition and 64 stimpaks. This update sucks.
---
I was doing this with my 50 cal thinking I need to throw a shredder thing on a minigun for next time this one comes up. Those robobrains keep dodging my bash, it's too slow LOL
---
Nice! I respect it, looked painful.
---
More like if you can't beat em, join em. Not really, it's just funny when wasteland barista's like yourself try to give advice on 76 pvp. You're one step away from "hurr durr go play nuclear winter".
---
Assaultrons and pvp tesla = gone forever 🎉🎉🎉
---
R u on PS4? Id trade for the high capacity mod
---
No, what sucked was not the mutation, which I read about before the patch, but no one else is in the thing and getting killed over and over again even with my Vampire's automatic rifle lol.
---
exactly, nice to have something to do with my bullion.
---
nope the last assaultrons MUST have it's last 25% health in damage done by melee weapons
---
Strange, I wonder why it's not working properly for me.
---
Like explained above, that's why they have a cap limit. You proved my point
---
Welp. Just did like 15 daily ops in a row trying to get a rare reward to pop up. Did not realize you only get one chance per day per elder rank to get them. At least now I know not to bother with daily ops after getting elder rank.
---
Luckily I have a full health build with AA/Vamps, but it looks like I'll be keeping any troubleshooters armour I can find. I have a melee build too, which is bloodied and at least he has the armour backpack on him.
---
Sneak isnt top priority. Tankiness is more than factoring dr and er. Gotta check your gear. Ap refresh. Dodgy. Perhaps moving target for the ops. Depending on your build, pa or not, anything high in both agility and strength. Get herbivore or carnivore, any food buffs to double ap refresh, as dodgy is like a second health bar. Vamp weapons help, but have a dps to switch as needed. Dunno for regular mundane grind stuff how effective stealth will be, but if you plan on running any of the ops solo ofc reconsider things like born survivor/autostim armor, first aid for full health build, diluted stims, and also a lil hp refresh from foods. Bloodied weapons are good still, just need to be in a group where ya dont take aggro.
---
Worked fine for me on PC.
---
Dude imagine if Earle spawned Mr. Gutsies instead of Wendigos...
---
Come to think of it, I did blow through a ludicrous amount of ammo.
---
I was playing today, and man those Mole Rats are way too strong! I like the idea of some enemies scaling to my level, but some are meant to be easy to kill.
---
This...soloing this, or at least this mutation is a death wish.
---
I was shooting them until low then weapon bashing but when your swarmed its not easy or fun to do.  We all know about gutsys super guns
---
The quantum user is trying to say I don’t know anything about pvp lol, just lol.
---
\+1 for magazine capacity.
---
[did better then me](https://imgur.com/qCuj1wG)
---
I'm playing with the idea of using legendary cards to give me enough perk points to trip out my pistols. I have so many b2525, BE25, and QE25 I'm looking forward to using them. I use to rock them in low level areas with no perks. Seeing how those don't exist, I need an upgrade.
---
This right here is why I always, always carry a shotgun as a BE Heavy build. Non explosive of course.
---
Don't let "her" hear you say that! 😉
---
I've got a Vampire Sharp Knuckles for future resilient DO to add to my quick change for finishing things off.
---
I think it's best to do it in a group and have a couple shooters and couple punchy bois to finish them off.
---
Any time I see this as the daily I'll need to make sure I have melee in hand. But bloodied sucks for this daily.
---
You mean my mom that’s been dead for five years? 
---
I like trolls, but not trolls that are absolute trash.
---
Interesting, it might be bugged as u mentioned, it worked for me and i am on ps4 playing this game.
---
It’s not the, people that are mad are of course mad but it’s still honestly extremely easy compared to most rpgs. It was important for the longevity of the game because it was too easy.
---
Casual
---
I'm really hoping they don't switch to telling stories over multiple weeks as a standard.
---
I hate this kind of storytelling in games. Destiny 2 does it too and it's painful.
---
At 20% my Nerd Rage and Adrenal Reaction and Emergency Protocols all pop. I just stood by the beacon and let the Gutsys shoot and nothing happens. I had no idea I could tank that hard. At 50% I have more health but loose all the defensive bonuses that are actually preventing the damage.
---
Some solutions :
---
Run fo76 in windowed mode (fast alt-tab)
---
A parameter to add- skip loading screen.
---
I'm bloodied unarmed and VE 50. Ran daily ops against robots and first go maxed the mission. The weapons are fine and I'd even argue my VE is knocking them down better now.
---
I haven’t read much into the damage changes, but my rifle build seems a lot stronger now - level 67 bloated ghouls take only two headshots from my lever action, and level 50 ghouls only take one, which is a massive improvement
---
Its casual now for the int buff
---
With serendipity, dodgy, ricochet, I didn't feel that they hit that hard. I'm wearing a unyielding set of secret service armor, if that makes a difference.
---
Yeah stealth is for when im solo, pa for moshing in a group. Never had alot of luck in group trying to keep stealth especially inside plus it breaks up the monotony of either build.
---
Nope because I finished it with a plasma gatling and a boop on the nose.
---
its called casual now the just renamed it and added the daily ops   
---
its still there dont worry
---
Following this because this is very similar to my play style.  I picked up the MI one to start.
---
Buildings INT bonus was moved to casual team
---
Old casual team was turned into daily ops team

I'll pay 5 bullion. 20 bullion for four so i can lvl faster for an hour. Anything above that is a fucking ripoff
---
Yea I have to nuke the mine but I now can't even complete it because I dont have the code and now its even harder.
---
I was bashing with my shotgun but it felt like it has a wait time between swings or my button on my controller doesn’t work well, either way that was also frustrating.  I don’t usually do that move ever so maybe that’s just how it is, not sure.
---
I really like the brotherhood outpost thing from fallout 1 and 2
---
Such good QoL
---
Furious 25fr .50 cal shreds in pvp and is definitely fast enough to out damage quantums, I predict alot of .50 cal and LMG pvp in power armour
---
Vampire Mr Handy buzzblade. Just back it into a corner and slowly suck its life away.
---
well when i fought it, it stop taking damage from any of my guns at around 25% so good to know you had it so fucking easy while i was stuck [for near an hour](https://imgur.com/qCuj1wG)trying to kill it when everyone else fucked off
---
I got a two-star shepherd’s crook - doesn’t answer your question, but I found it funny
---
What I'm explaining to you is that if you post a big rant about how upset you are at a video game, no one cares about what you're thinking when you post it. We form our own opinion on what you say that has nothing to do with how you feel. 
---
You don't understand that people see things differently than you, and you call ME a twelve year old. Okay, buddy.
---
Edit: After looking at your post history, it seems like ALL you do is bitch about Fallout 76. Maybe you need a new hobby.
---
But...you might as well; I mean the value of a ranged weapon is greatly diminished when, in the end, you can't reduce enemy dps with it, at all.
---
I have ran it 3 times now...no it does not. I whip out my BE gat plasma it goes orange I hit it with my cattle prod and it dies.
---
Nope. 
---
Even with my lvl 45 1* Bloodied DCG, the change isn't that terrible. A few extra swings, a closer eye on my health... No problems.
---
From what I found +60 is close to the cap.
---
It looks like it gets refreshed everytime you use it, but it doesn't. Each +2 buff lasts half an hour.
---
If I recall correctly, safes in owned workshops (locked before a player claimed the workshop) always showed up as white.
---
Yes, I'm impressed so far with missle turrets
---
well congratsufcukinglations because for me it didn't die
---
this will get 0 replies besides this one, you can screenshot this.
---
Uplink will have Piercing Gaze every time
---
Yeah, I can't even one shot cars now not even with my tse lever action rifle.
---
My second time in there, it was on a table next to a small security door room.
---
My first time, that table was empty, and the quest marker was pointing to an area that was outside of the map, basically did a search and rescue style of following the right wall, cause the quest marker was to my right.
---
I think this is where the uplink was.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/cNQ2sov](https://imgur.com/a/cNQ2sov)
---
I have five characters, five different builds. The bloodied unarmed and the full health rifleman are useless. To be honest, the only viable one is the vampire commando, and then, the PA heavy gunner.
---
Not if you're not specced for melee, and I'm not switching now for one Daily OP.
---
Now I'm supposed to swap out all my weapons and perks and drop my unyielding and grind for vanguard? Only for a less fun experience?
---
This right after you got a bunch of newbies from xbox gamepass and now you're punishing them all at level 50? 
---
Lol. Later Fallout and Fallout 1st. Lots of killer other games coming soon.
---
Now try that again with a low level character with no legendary perks or legendary effects!
---
I’m asking about plans from in game vendors
---
I for one am glad people do this. I'd rather read a spreadsheet and not waste ungodly amounts of hours figuring out daily ops are a complete waste of my time.
---
Nope, still takes multiple attempts for me.
---
That's hilarious!!
---
This post goes to the guy who was selling his for 22,000 caps
---
Do they reset at the same time every day? And what time specifically?
---
Wife and I usually play as stealth commandos, but we had to tweak our build for ops with great results. I’m a junkies and she plays bloodied, but we ran with explosive 10mm smgs for our respective builds, she then replaced two pieces of her unyielding SS set with trouble shooters while I have a mix of bolstering and vanguard.  We replaced the stealth perks with level 5 adrenaline and max dodgy, while also supplementing our defense with ricochet, as well as serendipity. To reach elder, we pretty much ignored every single mob that wasn’t at the adjective while also abusing cover to our advantage. I’m running level 5 demolition so usually tossing a nuke grenade gets the robots down to a bash death.
---
Oh and took us 4 tries, but we finally got elder with 30 seconds to spare.
---
Oh wow, I thought my 26 minutes was bad.
---
Legacies are only that because of the legendary effects. Mod away.
---
Adrenaline don't seem to work as much either.
---
Which one did you get?
---
Congrats .. but a vault suit plan for a solo run?? You should get a beer stein plan at least!  Still, awesome time 🙂
---
Yeah I hated that mutation. I am not a melee guy at all and I did it solo, so it was very overwhelming switching between weapons.
---
Sorry about your stim pack problem. I ran out of stimpacks, so it was virtually the same experience.
---
I thought it was fun... nice to have a challenging event. I’m looking forward to seeing what tomorrow is..
---
I guess I'm going to have to go back to rolling for a better Vamp Gauss minigun. Wish I had known how useful vampire was, scripted to many cause I initially though vamp was useless, till I read about it.
---
yeah that's what happens when you are abandon by your team and have to try and kill it with a fucking 10mm
---
I would assume so. Probably at 1200 EST or 1700 BST with the daily server reset.
---
K thank u
---
A quad tesla rifle
---
In their notes they said you could, but it would be hard.  Not impossible for some builds
---
I hope you have people left to look down on in a month...this is a game killing update.
---
I wish this would happen in the daily op
---
Perk manager mods
---
Ah no prob mod away.
---
I don't have any perk mods. Hmm.
---
All that glitters is not gold. Junkie's starting to look pretty good now huh. No, but in all seriousness, bloodied is still on top, you are just more in line with everyone else.
---
Can confirm, definitely gone.
---
Sorry, I feel your pain as I had a team of random abandon me for ACP, but also spending nearly an hour on it is pretty funny.
---
They should have done the further balancing in PTS before releasing this.
---
I don't mind the robot but that is mainly because I had a troubleshooter Crippling Gauss minigun.  They melted pretty quickly.
---
Great perk but given the insane ammo drops in daily ops it almost makes crafting ammo not needed. I ran just a few ops and netted 2k+ gauss ultracite and 5k+ 5mm ultracite. It is almost faster to run daily ops then it is to farm materials to craft ammo, and you get better rewards for ops.
---
It’s a RPG, builds have always been an important thing in plenty of games. Pick something to specialise in, can’t stand the people that want to run a build that’s mediocre at everything instead of being exceptional at one or two things and than complaining because they can’t do enough damage or take much damage.
---
That’s fantastic 👍🏻👍🏻
---
That could be it, I changed a few setting to disable the fps cap.
---
Follow through is an automatic pick for all of my characters who use range stealth for sure.
---
I also went with what rads on my high hp non mutant commando, so I dont have to carry as many radaway and when maxed it'll eventually cut nuke zone rads to -9 or -10 or so with full SS gear.
---
Taking one for the team is also *somewhat* useful for sneak characters, since stealth breaks far more easily now - but is just as easy to reenter with escape artist. Either way there will be times when you lose stealth and will thank the damage bonus, I think.
---
I just hit 75 and honestly the update just makes everything feel a bit more bullet spongy. Which I guess I'm not a huge fan of but the worst part is I can't just go to a low level area to unwind anymore, everything takes forever to kill now.
---
I mean, I don't find the game harder, just more tedious. Maybe it's my playstyle, I haven't had to heal any more than usual, I still vendor 90% of my stims, but man... everything is SO slow to die now. Slowing down the flow of combat feels like a weird design decision.
---
Same exact thing here.
---
I'm playing my SCORE run character who's level 71 because I don't want to pull out my high level character to do SCORE stuff...and she's getting butchered...in the fucking FOREST region. WTF Bethesda.
---
Very nice change.
---
As a stealth rifle build the message to go f myself is loud and clear bethesda. tyty.
---
Go to your map and look at the bottom left. There is a new box. You start it from there. The event doesn't show on the map. You will be teleported straight there, and then teleported back to where you started, even if you're overencumbered.
---
Yes, a team splitting roles would be good for sure, especially if the shooters could just move quickly through the place to do the repairs and let the melee clean things up. Tough event solo. I love it.
---
i started recording the fight after they left and i ran out of ammo
---
Sounds like you're just a *good vendor*. Own that shit.
---
Any recommendations? I have a shotgun reciever for the tesla
---
I really haven't noticed a difference, my flame thrower and I still melt through enemies as if they are tissue paper put to a match.
---
It is quite satisfying to mince stuff with big guns then finish them off with a boop.
---
i had so much trouble trying to figure out how to cancel my sub, they dont make it easy, perfect advice, thanks!
---
200 stims? 1000 rounds? I ran this today with my bloodie build with just a power fist, had a couple guys with me but I used no more than 30 stims and I picked up off of enemys like 10 more than I came in with. I died once.
---
Well, that obviously sucks.
---
Games should feel rewarding - not the opposite.
---
Saying you wont do it again is being a drama queen and you felt it was geared towards heavy PA users and I debunked that. I even managed it on a badly geared level 60 alt. I had my lever action. Some guy had a death claw gauntlet and another had a handmade. No pa. No heavy. Just under 12 mins. Once people understand you can just run past mobs and get some troubleshooter armor that will be a breeze
---
I just got them down and then bashed with the gun
---
I personally decided to skip it because I don't really do anything in teams
---
Any mod that changes the UI doesn’t show the new stuff. So if you have a map mod, perk manager, or something of that sort it won’t show
---
Well nothing is challenging once you get the hang of it.
---
But I did have a lot of fun wit it today.
---
So what you're saying is you want to get shredded by people that are at the skill level where they can fight people that pop 1200 healing from a quantum every few seconds in a fight.
---
Non legacy power armour pvp is the best
---
Beating serious bloody pvp players while running around in excavator armour is hilarious though
---
Whoever came up with this idea must be like super dumb. Another example that Bethesda devs just come with their genius ideas, and yet dont even play the game. I would really want to see some of them telling me how GOOD it is.
---
Ha! I did the same thing! It's super helpful isn't it? I also then buffed up my regular one so it gives me more DR. Makes a BIG difference, switching between the two.
---
Wait what this is a legacy, I just scrip one two nights ago from randomly getting it
---
What needs to be fixed? They are pretty awesome!
---
Will it? Tbh it doesn't really matter either way as I'm not a stealth build so I don't need to be sneaky.
---
Ahhaha I got so annoyed after doing 90% of a daily ops solo, that before running to the end zone where big assaultron dude is, I made sure to bring the crowd of robots following me to Mr. Mooch at the entrance, let him shoot a few. Then left him.
---
Oh man. I dont think he ever figured out you need to melee. It was just non stop explosive gatling laser from him after that hahahha
---
So does that mean that you have the same number of potential card slots available on all of your characters based on the highest level character, but that each individual character will have to turn in their own saved up levels and cards to “fund” their own legendary card picks? 
---
That would be a relief. I was talking while in groups today, and a few people were saying that not only the slots, but whatever you picked for your highest character would be the only ones you would get for all of your characters. I was like WTF, I have a commando and a heavy, two opposite ends of the spectrum.
---
Second this ⬆️ (the Vault stashbox part, lol) and its sellable/tradeable... but he wouldn't do either for me.... 🤣🤣
---
Quad Teslas aren't legacy. I just got one from Murph a couple days ago.
---
I've been warning about this since the reports from the PTS came out, and every time time I just got down voted into oblivion!
---
Because "hooray bloodied nerf, screw everyone else!"
---
this is why I haven't bothered yet... my gear is near needing repair already and man I don't want to rush out and throw away my ballistic fiber already.
---
Um.... Did you join a daily ops team?
---
I just did one on Xbox no problem
---
I think it was great.
---
Y'all have gotten too used to everything being easy.
---
The whole point of the legendary perk mobs in OPs is to make you change up your playstyle and challenge you.
---
Three on ranged inside the zone, then have one guy melee the last hit.
---
Am I doing something wrong? I went into solo to the Burrows and walked out without all of my good weapon ammo, half of my stimpaks gone, and still died a hundred times (level 107). Probably not gonna do those ever again
---
This. 
---
Come to find out that even when the brotherhood (or at least a small detachment of them) arrive, it'll be a story told over multiple weeks. Now I'm worried that this will be the standard, Instead of big expansions once a year like Wastelanders, it'll just be stories told over weeks
---
Atlas, after the BoS move in.
---
Stealth isn't broken... one of the the enemy perks is "perceptive"
---
I mean it's has explosive
---
Yeah for sure. It definitely gave me a few "fuck sake" moments when I was getting swarmed and it's really rejuvenated the game for me.
---
That's a good thing though.
---
It should be a challenge.
---
I was soloing it. Can't seem to find anyone doing ops. I even created an ops team and no one. I was using a B25 Handmade and went through it at the burrows. It's good you didn't have to waste that much supplies. But I've now changed my build to a heavy PA and didn't die once and soloed it in 10 mins. So I'm happy lol.
---
&gt;They SHOULDN'T work in NW. But knowing Bethesda, it will probably be an oversight/bug and actually will work for months and months.
---
So, should higher level characters not get attributes over low levels? Because they do. You have to level up in Adventure in order to equip the perks you earn in Nuclear Winter, so I'm not sure why this is your assertion since it's already not the case.
---
And, for the OP, they do not work. Only base stats are presently registering in NW. This could be an oversight, much like modified stats aren't giving their full sharing possibility (10+5 charisma does not let you share a rank 5 Adrenaline, only rank 3).
---
Same. It was interesting. Some mutations were correct, but others were ignoring CF. For me, it was marsupial and speed demon. Only speed demon is unaffected after a "reseating" of the perk card.
---
Wait, what's the illegitimate way? Do you mean I didn't need to hammer away all that time on scout badges?
---
How would non bloodied damage compare to bloodied after the change, like a b/25/25 fixer versus a quad/25/15 fixer but only boosted by bloody mess and adrenaline
---
You mean you don’t want to load into my base which will be a maze spending 10mins wasting your time and finally getting to my venders only to find you want nothing in them?
---
Yup, I'm not seeing any sneak attacks on my rifleman, my commando, my heavy gunner or my melee build anymore...
---
I thought I had all my builds sorted and specced alright... Nope. I did get a nice exploding troubleshooters fixer drop the other day, so that will be good for this event. Same, I've scrip so much stuff that I now regret.
---
You are trying corral my comments into your narrative. So, piss off. You didn't to comment on this post AT ALL, yet you did in order to push your narrative. You complain that there are too many posts "whining" about the new event, yet you ignore the fact that there are so many posts. You are toxic.
---
Yeah, I joined a team, started a team and no one seemed to join.
---
Ok then. That is a badass gun. Have fun.
---
Same but luckily had a three star bat I swiped from my vendor inventory.  Bashing... duh.
---
what about the three other people on your team?
---
or were you expecting to solo it?
---
Ah well shit man that does make a lot of sense. I was ready to punch out some quests for them and hopefully get some more unique weapon plans.. :€
---
I second this. 
---
Wait, we're out of beta!? 🤓
---
Totally feeling this. Finished up the Wastelanders final mission on my level 76 that's got good armor and whatnot, and that wasn't too bad. Hopped over to my alt that's level 36 and good lord, I am getting hit by Mac trucks left and right, armor breaking like it's made of paper, and blowing through stimpacks. Middle game levels are in a rough spot with this update for sure.
---
I was having fun with the unleveled world... Now it's trash..... I literally hate leveled worlds.. It seems so fake and I want to feel like a god after I hit high levels. It's dumb to always have everything match your level, it makes so sense and it's the reason I hate ESO.....
---
this has been my experience too. I haven't needed to heal any more than usual but I sure am wasting a lot more ammo. Ammo factory feels mandatory at this point.
---
Still doesn't justify messing with player's builds.
---
I mean it's has the explosive effect and the quad effect
---
Yeah sorry for not being specific
---
Ohhhh the HE yep yep
---
I'm level 71 on my SCORE character I made just to do the SCORE run...and she's getting her ass kicked. In the god damn FOREST region...aka the easiest fucking area. I shudder to think of what other areas are like.
---
What is there to love about being massively nerfed? Don’t care? Sure. Love it? Give me a break.
---
Ahhh...my mods...t.t
---
All you people mad you couldn't solo a 4 man dungeon...
---
WTF
---
i am a solo player, so yes, i expected to solo it. there was no indication prior to joining that it was solely a team activity.
---
Rip QE shotgun
---
You can run the daily ops solo while in any team (: they have the option to join you. The daily ops team just gives you more xp for completing the task. Be warned though, it's not easy to run on your own if you want a chance at the better rewards, you will get eaten alive LOL. And make sure to read the description of the ops before you start!
---
Downplaying gamebreaking problems? This sub would never do that. /s
---
My  sloth is now Level 75.
---
Scrrrrched chickens
---
Someone came through my vendor in the last hour before update and cleaned out thousands of rounds of .50 at 2c/.308 at 1c that had been sitting there for weeks.
---
You probably should have even way, but Vats Commando is a great wat to recoup damage lost with the debalance.
---
Weird. It took a couple minutes but as soon had 3 people ready for action and a 4th joined midway through. Finished in 14 mins. Will prob do better next time.
---
You said it yourself, you didn't need all that damage. And I agree with that, bloodied needed to be brought in line and it was.
---
Lol. Yes, all of their patches in this game, while perhaps well-intentioned, have been a flop and a disappointment at least to me. But as you said, classic Bethesda.
---
Seriously though, I spawned in and was instantly detected. Why even run a damn sneak build if they are going to make it impossible.
---
I burned down a junk wall and tried to stack another junk wall next to it, in order to break through the limit of object collision. It worked fine before, but I can't do this again after patch.
---
Oh I went in *completely* unprepared.  I had a Fixer, Shotgun, and Troubleshooters Ski Sword.
---
Yep I agree also good addition
---
How did you get it under 8 minutes solo? I could only pull 8:34-8:54. The bars would not fill any faster.
---
I'm not having fun anymore with this one wasteland bullshit. I want my one hit kill low level enemies back god damn it.
---
I have a level 310 bloodied sneak and a level 70 PA Heavy build with full health and let me tell you, you don't even need all those tank perks for bloodied the damage they do is nothing on my level 70 he has level 30 excavator and it takes no damage at all with the legendary pa perk that recharges the fusion cores only people complaining are the bloodied 20% hp people that die somehow in this easy daily ops
---
it's very obviously a team event.
---
it announces you are running it globally and invites others to join.
---
you get speed bonuses at the objectives based on how many people are in range.
---
it's not meant to solo, and it's designed to challenge set playstyles.

I'm having a hard time playing at all, Level 37. I know it's supposed to be more evenly matched, but everything I run into is exactly my level, which is not fun at all and makes me think its a bug on my end. I'm a sneaky sniper/midrange player too, and when every enemy is a 1:1 fight its impossible to keep cover and I end up getting swarmed. I liked knowing where I could go for a challenge vs a casual session, and now everything is deadly serious. Scaling should be tied to level, but relative to like a percentage? - ie. @ 30ish it was fun to get a handful of lvl.21 ghouls/scorched, then come across one lvl.50 tough thing to beat. Get swarmed by a dozen lvl 8-10 insects, fight some close to my level raiders, etc. Better formula would be enemy@[30/85/160]%_player-lvl, per player, according to type of creature and spawn rate.
---
I'm one shotting stuff with an instigating Fixer/Bear Arm still. I was even missing 25% of the possible damage boost to rifles from perks and have never used melee perks. Haven't tried out my bloody weapons yet but this nerf is not nearly as bad as I was expecting.
---
You didn't debunk anything. Learn how to apply logic to your argument.
---
This absolutely sounds like a typical fanboy response. You don't have to like the game my dude, that's your preference, but to say it's a trash game, you're not hiding your fanboyism.
---
Complete I was expecting a bit more dangerous of enemy’s and using more ammo but going from being able to one shot almost everything with a good rifle (w/ probably 7 or so rifleman perks) in the forest to having to blast a radstag yearling with 4-5 shots from a sniper to kill it is a little ridiculous I feel. Im all for higher level enemy’s that should actually be difficult like super mutants and other monsters but radstags and mole rats needing numerous gun blast to the face seems pretty dumb imo.
---
And being mad they can't solo a team event.
---
Yeah i think they are still blind as a bat.
---
Oof, the fire bow is the best for groups because you just splash the horde with 1s. It seems to have a similar size aoe to a m79, maybe a little bigger. You go through maybe 20 arrows? 
---
If you're soloing I like the m79 with whatever legendaries fit your build. For me it's bloodied, and you can get ammo from the horde.
---
This, probably

I’ve been a casual player since beta and am a high level purely from playing for a long time and tbh a lot of the enemies are way over powered. Why did they think I want every enemy to be equally difficult? 
---
I don’t have an optimized build, and seriously some Mole Rats were totally mooking me today. Also all my guns break so fast now!
---
75 here and yeah, this patch just feels like they turned every enemy into a bullet sponge. It's not harder, just more resource intensive and slower.
---
When I bashed to kill them I seemed to get the gun's ammo, but if I switched to a melee to kill them it was random.
---
I was worried about this, and it appears my suspicions were correct. Luckily as a high level I don’t have to worry about this quite as much, but if it renders some of my best weapons almost useless (which it did), I can’t even imagine how awful it must be for everyone who has a life and didn’t grind out all the top-tier stuff.
---
We ran this 3 times tonight and hit all the time markers. The first time was a bit rough,  but since it's a set pattern,  it was much easier the 2nd and 3rd time. 
---
Once you get the okay from the BOS, run to the next objective, defend, then run to the last one, rinse repeat. Easy peasy.
---
I noticed that too. Thought I lost my fixer.
---
I agree 100%
---
A 9 pt swap into commando is more directly tied to your build and will let you use whatever legendary handmade you have.
---
I find quad gauss rifles decent with rifles still. Nothing on commandos, but decent.
---
Edit: also means you get your 18 perk coins back from the rifleman cards, while each special respec point means you lose 2 coins
---
I can think of a couple pluses. For example, any legendaries you pick up are guaranteed max level, and its easier to gain xp now too.
---
three on ranged to take mobs down to last HP, one person goes around and one-hits the nearly dead mobs.
---
i'm a rifle build, I was "melee" killing the mobs by bashing them with my gun.
---
Switch your rifleman cards to commando. The rest of the build remains the same and you'll have the highest DPS in the game .
---
Me too. I'm probably just gonna take this season off like I did last season. I just hope I dont miss quests because I chose not to play during certain times
---
No. Damage change reverted? Maybe. But currently? No.
---
Can't trade the War Glaive I just got...so guessing can't trade weapon plans 😩
---
They didn't mess with player builds. All they did was use a different formula to calculate damage. The relative positions for MOST of the builds remains the same.
---
I explored it but I was extremely bored, no unique loot to find like a vault 94 suit. All enemies were dead when I went in so it just felt like a big empty building to look at.
---
The visuals were cool and I got a bit of lore but I couldn’t keep myself interested in fully hunting out the story. I will try again in my explorer character
---
Make sure you go to the right counter!
---
you don't even need to do that.
---
you can kill them by bashing them with your equipped gun.
---
When I killed with melee I git random. I mostly did melee there because my melee damage is better. I didn’t bash.
---
So that’s probably it. 
---
Pulse grenades were great for dealing a lot of damage to many then hacking away. 
---
And mines. Scatter them about.
---
Would be nice to have a reason to go underground in Watoga again.
---
The point is that I worked for it, regardless if I needed it or not. They could've dealt with each build type in a different way instead of nerfing everything down with the same formula.
---
What do you mean "buy levels"
---
Wasn't fixed for me
---
That’s me with the camp shelters lol
---
I see a lot of whining going on about this. "They nerfed my guns, and made enemies harder." 
---
Welcome to not having a meta build. You'll get thru it. I like to play my piano in my camp, in my free time. It's a stress reducer.
---
My EZ button? I use pistols. Until today I wasn't even bothering with pistol perks. 
---
Crying? Fucking hell, no one is allowed to do anything in the sub unless the hive mind of twelve year olds gets to bitch and whine first.
---
I ran it (with others). I should have been clearer. We did it in 7:59 too 😅
---
Bos update has long been announced
---
Bloodied unarmed is still great. Just needs more survival perks like dodgy. Buddy an I beat the daily ops under 12mins of course but we just used bloodied dcg to complete it. After we got a decent 3rd guy we beat it under 8mins with probs.
---
The hit pistols will take in the buff is going to heavily outweigh the enhancements of tank killer (If it really works tier 3). 
---
ELI5 pistols will do less damage than before nerf even with tank killer.
---
Yep, me too. I’m really bummed about it. But doing this definitely showed that I have to if I want to continue playing.
---
If only there was an in game event to match.
---
It’s just A UI glitch
---
Dude just bash them with your gun. Shot them until they are within a sliver of health and turn orange then slap them once with your buttstock. Easy.
---
Yeah broken steel is coming, which is the new brotherhood quests. Plus daily ops isnt really part of the seasons, it's a decent content drop.
---
^
---
Seriously? You mean there’s hope? If it works you are my idol sir.
---
Stealth does not work in the version of daily ops, but future ones will be different probably.  It still works in everything else.  If anything with this change in damage calculation you may want to switch to stealth crit commando.
---
A new expansion along the lines of Wastelanders is coming split over two parts over the winter. It's focused around the brotherhood of steel, which is why we've been getting events like building up the brotherhood base.
---
I tested a TSE handmade and it's doing 1/3 the damage it did before when rifling. Probably going to take that to commando from here on out.
---
it's 300 perk coins to fully upgrade... ;(
---
Okay. As long as you never show up to anyone’s nuke but your own, feel free to flex ur unnecessarily min/maxed build. But if u melt anyone else’s queen before half the people have a chance to make the damage threshold that’s just being a dick. Me, I’d rather spend perks on quality of life things instead making my character op. I enjoy the fight, the challenge, and the rush of sometimes just barely scraping by. I don’t ever want my games to be easy for me. Oh well, to each their own. Different play styles I guess!
---
How much are you in need of? I haven't built the jetpack myself but I have some flux I could share.
---
I kind of like having all my fixers in the same place on my mule.  Being able to sort by type would be pretty swell.
---
In my opinion, vats based agi per luck gun builds really do benefit from a full 15/15/15 across those stats.
---
Issue is you usually need to have 5 pts for the gunsmith (and so you can run nerd rage, demo expert, batteries included or what have you) in int, and 2 in str for the bandolier, which removes most other options.
---
3 legendary special cards lets you max the specials your build relies on, while allowing you to get that inspiration 3, tenderizer, blocker, fireproof and all those perks that aren't even quite QoL so much as build enhancing.
---
Crap like mole miner gauntlets (since there is never just one mole miner and the drop rate is high) and miniguns take up so much space. It's easy to even go from 20 left to being over just by looting corpses from one area.
---
Keep being a cry baby.
---
I have 2 characters and both have level 50 (or 45 idk) explosive western revolvers from Mumbles.  With no pistol perks, I carried them for low level liberators outside of 76 and Tygart facility for the Destroy robots with a pistol challenge.  I guess they are no longer worth the novelty.  R.I.P. rp weapons
---
My 3 powerhouse characters are now less viable than my mules were prior to the update. So no.....not feeling the love.
---
You can't "buy levels". You can spend atoms to progress in the battlepass, if that's what you mean.
---
Are you talking about the uplinks or the thing you have to fix first (some word beginning with r I can’t remember.) The uplinks are always in the same two locations. The second thingy, the thing you repair when you start the mission, is what spawns on the table.
---
This. It's really a QOL issue more then anything. Having to swap constantly gets old fast 🤣
---
Just go into the nuclear zone after someone else in your server nukes it
---
I don't get it either, I assume they mean the legendary run but that's to help people who can't play everyday and finish the daily challenges. Some people just have to find something to complain about
---
I rename all my weapons to their prefixes to begin with. Not a big deal. I can read descriptions.
---
Be careful OP, you cannot say good things about a change that Bethesda has implemented! You will be cast down into the endless pit of downvote city if you do!
---
Indeed.
---
It would be nice if you looked into the C.A.M.P. issue of not being able to delete a floor because part of your structure wouldn't be "accessible". And bring back the greenhouse walls and roof from fo4!
---
it’s a lot more balanced and i am having more fun in the normally low level areas.
---
As long as punch and pie are offered at the end of the tour.
---
YES FINALLY
---
Hahahaha okay, champ. I'm pushing my "narrative". You got me, I'm actually FOX News and I'm writing a story on why you're such a little bitch. 
---
Don't complain about stupid shit on the internet if you don't want to be called out for complaining about stupid shit.
---
Done that, mine still closed. I think I have to be in their party.
---
Thanks for this. I will keep mine at the default rank so it auto-unlocks nothing.
---
That's so cool!!
---
It seems like a lot of extra work for something that requires 2 key presses - one to exit vats and one to do the bash.
---
Thank you!  I've been searching for them lol
---
Left D pad works for me
---
One Wasteland is awesome.  Daily Ops needs an adjustment
---
20k-30k caps wise
---
Can't imagine why people would be mad at you for spending atoms 😂
---
Does it stack with food?
---
Thanks for this 😎👍🏽
---
This is exactly how I play and set up my build as well. Glad to see I'm not the only one. I literally chose those 3 legendary perks as well. Came here to see what others were doing as well, not sure where to go from there.
---
They are really solid, opens up a lot of interesting options.  I am will probably take at least 4 of them on most of my characters.
---
Same here. I am looking at my 3 toughest characters being less viable than my mules were pre update. I haven't even tried playing my other characters but from what I'm reading things aren't looking good.
---
New character. Just to see what the new player experience is like.
---
Oh darn I guess I’ll just have to live with a chance of 1,100.
---
Wha
---
A lot of us just join teams for the passive buffs, not to hang out with strangers. Makes your mutations stronger, higher xp, there are good things to be had for playing solo, while being in a public team.
---
I dont know if my game is bugged or what. I did uplink site A with no issue. The bar went up and no problems. Then I did site B and the bar got stuck and wouldn't move for 5 minutes. So i just fast traveled out of there, as the enemies were infinite. Am I supposed to go hit a button after turning on the site b? site a required nothing of the sort.
---
I did it mostly because I am way too lazy to feed two toons 🍺
---
As many have said, the bash mechanic is hit or miss. As a stealth build I also lack more of the defensive perks that would make it easier. It’s not impossible but it feels like a waste of resources (stims and bullets) for my play style.
---
No. I never go in for this kind of gimp character building.
---
Well for one I like earle mainly for screw farming 😂
---
infinite weight here i come
---
They did this time obviously
---
the elder from fallout 3 was the only one to be a somewhat decent human. from what i remember, the brotherhood has been racist jerks since their founding.
---
It ain't bed for free.
---
spec into luck, agility and agility so you can put points into other perks
---
Once again a person not reading and complaining
---
yeah, the initial uplink that you have to repair.
---
First time, I think it spawned inside a wall outside of the normally accessible map.
---
No I’m not, if they want to buy levels so they can unlock items that have zero effect on my gameplay that’s fine by me :-)
---
counterpoint: always wear your unyielding.
---
Dude... You had me going i was like fuck i knew the path I sprinted the whole way and shit I still couldn't make it and somehow this guy did.
---
Thanks...I guess I should have read the patch notes first instead of just jumping in...I feel like a noob.  Thanks again everyone
---
B10 fixer/ve handmade have become my go-to weapons. Also want to test IE lever gun tonight in hopes it can do well
---
Yeah, unless I'm mistaken, each character gets their own picks and highest level character only determines how many cards you can have on at a time
---
Not an ultra-wide user, but I know how huge having a proper interface is at those aspect ratios. Props to you.
---
must have cost a hell of a lot of atoms.
---
I'll get it the proper way, more fun and rewarding
---
I play with an elite controller on steam and had no issue with the D Pad, could be an issue with the Xbox update? 
---
And yes the bashing every single enemy sucked.  Immensely
---
Dude, they are not viable because they rely exclusively on being able to fire slowly but hitting hard. Now, they are just slow against enemies which, in addition, got buffed in terms of level and DR. 
---
The strongest hunting rifle is not able to oneshoot a high level molerat. A HUNTING RIFLE. 
---
Also, it breaks immersion tremendously. I stopped playing Fallout 4 when some enemies required a full magazine of shots to the head to die. It's silly.
---
 I dont know if my game is bugged or what. I did uplink site A with no issue. The bar went up and no problems. Then I did site B and the bar got stuck and wouldn't move for 5 minutes. So i just fast traveled out of there, as the enemies were infinite. Am I supposed to go hit a button after turning on the site b? site a required nothing of the sort.
---
It works well for using any weapon type pretty much as well. I have a fondness of switching weapons constantly just for fun 🤣
---
Used atoms?
---
You'll have to grab yourself an automatic rifle, but yeah. Stealth commando has always been the best damage dealing build.
---
When i made a post about this i got flamed people are finally seeing through the bullshit. The game is shit now. The nerf is way over the top. They made everything useless. Everything takes 10x the ammo and time to kill. My junkies weapons were cut in half damage wise. So instead of giving a buff to useless prefixes like berserkers mutants assassins or nocturnal they just made everything useless.. Thats how these clowns fix this game. They only care about atoms and ways to generate revenue. Thats why my first got cancelled. Im done giving these morons anything.
---
Always remember Todd loves you....
---
Congrats, I guess?
---
The tiers that can be bought are ultimately beneficial for those that want the rewards but can’t play all the time, also if you have spare atoms laying around and would rather invest in the pass. The items in the pass are purely cosmetic, with the exception of a few consumables which hardly have any negative impact on gameplay for anybody else
---
it's been reported 100's of times so far, and bethesda have replied to it.
---
Just use the glitch that gives you unlimited mag size
---
75% damage nerf to my 3 strongest characters. That's no small change....they are unplayable. My mules were more viable before the update than my strongest characters are now. But hey....so glad we have that even playing field for everybody now. We can all suck together.
---
It's pretty funny. You get to see level 300 players getting owned by level 10 enemies (from *your* perspective). It's hilarious.
---
Poop. Simple as that
---
It's not in the game yet.
---
If you are talking about the sugar crash, it’s always done that but it does feel like a bug. Instead of lowering your AP regen it just stops it completely.
---
Beth might be a bit more subtle.  I do wonder if they ghost the daily "Is FO76 worth playing now?" post and some of the replies.
---
Imo this is why they shoulda kept the forest as it was. Apply the update to the other regions and it would’ve been fine
---
My point is that Bethesda is incompetent and this game sucks. Not sure what your counterpoint is saying.
---
Good luck finding psychopaths to do this one again with you. My bloody WWR build was absolutely useless in there. I swapped to the a full SS bolstering set with sentinel and still got downed like 20 times. It was a senseless game of hide and seek once I figured it out
---
Best way to farm .308 is ACP, even better for ultra .308 since the wendigos die faster.
---
Agreed, and I like they are putting in some real teamwork elements, like having to kill enemies with melee.  While I can bash them once to finalize the kill, it works great having a split of ranged to take the health down and melee to finish.  Pretty fun.
---
I wish any of the season was fun or rewarding.
---
Ok I think I misunderstood what is happening.
---
Such is the struggle in Fallout 😩
---
mine works fine ... was making 90 5.56 rnds a pop
---
There is only the daily ops introduction quest, that starts when you go to Watoga.
---
Lol I just turned my PC off in disgust and came.here to see is this was an issue. I hit 86 yesterday and was very happy. Logged on for an hour today expecting it to be harder and was still shocked a little.
---
“Hey look everybody, this guy is so brave and bold for disowning FO76 over something as trivial as spending atoms on level ups!!!”
---
-said no one ever
---
Yes, go to Watoga. There is an unmarked location called Watoga towers just east of the civic center. Up the stairs is an elevator to the 3rd floor
---
Guess i have to say goodbye to the lever action then :')
---
For what it’s worth, I too have a stealth commando build and it’s my favorite. It’s the only build that I still play. 
---
I won today’s daily ops though (needing group support) and it felt like a win. It was a “holy shit that was hard” win. It felt good.
---
Check out Watoga!
---
Mald you are
---
Oh, cool, cool. That's just great lol. I really just play solo to relax and wander around and do quests, so I really don't want to play with enemies scaled to my level. Ugh.
---
Well I hope you and your money have a fine time elsewhere.
---
Assuming of course you're not just whinging and will still continue to play regardless.
---
Iv been putting off making ammo for a week just waiting for this perk lol.
---
Hope that means the free states are headed back to appalachia. The mire is sorely in need of some life
---
Hmm I'm a masochist, so this is a challenge accepted. Currently running a half health ish explosive junkies shotgun build with four pieces unyielding and one autostim. Gonna try it half health first. With the right perk line up, I can tank robots and super mutants well enough not to rely on vats or stealth. But if need more tankiness, then I have a few tricks up my sleeve. Namely food buffs and vamp weapon full health pa, emergency protocols and nerd rage. Been practicing not using vats or stealth and know how to gun bash, preferably with shotty. Cant wait to either have my white ass kicked, or potentially cheese it. Max adrenaline should be okay since I'll be trying to kill any that get close, since shotguns are shorter ranged anyway
---
Do you mind putting your build on Nukes and Dragons and PM me? I want to do a comparison.
---
Hey look, another post on this subreddit that's just someone complaining. What a shock.
---
The amount of overhead slams that took me out, I have never once feared protectrons but I’m terrified
---
Maybe it's your build. You shouldnt be having much trouble or having gear break. It's not meant to be easy.
---
Thank you for the amazing quick response.
---
Im utterly confused as to why people are enjoying it. Awful performance with rules that are literally pushing the engine to the limit. The gameplay boils down to something not much more advanced than any old event, albeit infinitely more frustrating.
---
Finally something to spend gold on , been at max a few weeks , thanks for for the server change tip 👍👍
---
Another one that I can personally attest to is that the marine chest piece sometimes sticks out of the traveling leather coat when a player is wearing both. This only happens sometimes when you load into a world and can sometimes be fixed by spamming the equip/unequip option.
---
Were you using "Ammosmith"?
---
My stimpak hotkey stopped working a few days ago but I'm on PC.
---
The damage nerf is really really extreme thats a bit much.. ..
---
No, it’s the whole robots know exactly where you are at all times without even moving thing.  This Daily Ops is clearly designed solely for high health tank builds.  Stealth and Bloodied need not apply
---
I was worried about this.
---
If anything they leaned further into bloody being the top build. They had a chance to promote more build variety and they didn't.
---
I had it as malee but it's actually melee. Thanks though.
---
Yeah, I saw something like that. Dude in full PA and a super sledge having trouble with ghouls I was 2-3 headshotting as a level 14 in Morgantown during the Back on the Beat event.
---
Honestly.. And i don't mean to sound rude.. Seems more like a gitgud situation. Or you are just very new to the game.
---
Like it always has been?
---
Power armor...sneak guys, power armor. I was over encumbered the whole time, but made it through. Spamming diluted stim packs, but made it.
---
Damage nurf
---
On topic; do throwing knives and the sort count as melee for the sake of that modifier? Like widdle them down w bullets and throw the knife to keep my distance?
---
It's worth noting that the quest just starts up as soon as you enter watoga, so there are quest markers telling you where to go.
---
Very nice well done! What system do you play on buddy?
---
Just adding a voice that won't be heard. This update sucks. Give me the option to turn off level scaling or I'm not going to be playing this much longer.
---
Good grief it's been fun though lol
---
No worries man
---
Doesn't count on your own vending machines, just if you're selling to the vendors at train station a or traveling merchants.
---
Yeah for sure, that card is absolutely a strong pick
---
OMG SAME
---
Level 65, logged on and saw the “Jail Break” event was active, nice and easy event to start off the new update, and I can use my fun guns/toys (bloodied deathclaw gauntlet and bloodied revolver, I’m a heavy build). To my surprise every super mutant is level 50, several of them on me at once melted me, TWICE. Took out my surpressors gatling laser and could keep up but damn is it tough now.... that was my go to event for quick SCORE cause it was easy, now I need to utilize my build for everything
---
Way warlier than the 80s. More like 1920s or 30s.
---
And even he didn’t really manage to do it at Elder Rank
---
It absolutely is not. I barely notice a difference and have no problems killing anything. People like you who say this were either doing blindingly op amounts of damage and needed to be nerfed or have something very wrong with their build.
---
Yeah!!  
---
My 2nd is a Shotgun only and has all the related shotgun perks. It still does really good damage. 1 shot a lot of things still, 2 shot others, and 3 shot the bigger bads. Of course the boss types and stuff haven't been tested to see what it's doing.  
---
I'm more of a casual player in games and I too like the challenge. My sniper though.....had so much issues with level 50 moel rats and 50 and 65 hounds. I don't have an automatic weapon to switch over yet.
---
I did watch and read. If you aren’t build specific as a solo the Daily Ops suck so far.  It’s cool, I don’t have to do it and I probably won’t until I understand it more.  Tried it, didn’t like it.  Will wait for further data
---
It depends on your weapons. My unarmed ninja went from causing 7K to causing 450 points of damage. And even less in daily ops, since the enemies see you and there is no sneak bonus. 
---
My lever rifle went from 2K to 350.
---
Doesn't work if you're solo.
---
it's a challenge and its fun
---
I love it all
---
How would you have handled bloodied then? I feel like everyone complaining just wants a one shot build, a build that kills bosses in seconds and that isn't what the game is about. Is it cool, yes, is it beneficial to others, no. Balance was needed.
---
I have a TrSh50/15 Fixer that is named exactly that; the rest of my Fixers are now ‘The Fixer’ lmao
---
Agreed; +40 bash helps probably; half XP, twice the ammo, most ammo doesn't drop anyway, the introduction of pure invincibility, cloaky builds singled out for EVERY event, fun?  I think they forgot about fun again.  I do like the One Wasteland part but this event is trash imnsho.
---
I played bloodied unarmed too. I was also pretty butt hurt at first. I also have a bloodied commando so I know the other bloodied weapons aren't as fucked. Bloodied melee build got hit the hardest. You have high str so just change to heavy weapons and strap some power armor on
---
A sense of pride and accomplishment
---
It's not that bad. They gave us power increase through legendary perk cards. If we can't oneshot everything now but can survive much better due to new perk card slots, I'm perfectly fine with it. Hey, they even accounted for sneak builds as the Follow Through perk card.
---
The game is gonna be alot more build dependent, no more slapping on 90% weight reduction perks and hitting the road. I think this patch will make a whole bunch of casuals who enjoy Fallout for exploring stop playing
---
I'm still one shotting enemies with my BE25 Fixer lol having maxed out Follow Through and maxed out Demo Expert helps alot.
---
I went through it and couldn't find a way into the residential area. The maintenance, engineering, and G. E. C. K. areas are open. I'd also never ran the raid so maybe I just missed it, but all the doors I found for residential were vines over.
---
This sums it up well.
---
Totally agree. Regarding INT 5 and Gunsmith, i think that’s an option as well. Need Rage 3 is essential for some builds but that’s basically it beyond adding it additional explosive dmg which doesn’t seem worth it anymore. I tend to keep Scraper on for QoL but if I could take my INT down to 3, I would. 
---
That said, maybe INT is equally as valuable for the same type of builds you mentioned..? Could take INT down four points to 1, maxed legendary perk at 6. That opens up 5 points.
---
Wait... maybe not. I suppose the goal is to utilize and exhaust all other possible cards first before using excess dmg cards like demo expert, or maybe the +15% stimpack card
---
I’m confused lol
---
I’ve learned to just ignore everything about the ops, run to each objective. Use no ammo or stims, kill no bots.  Die a few times, but I can now get to the boss.  Doesn’t feel like it’s the enjoyable way to play it, so I probably int die ops for a bit
---
Possibly an xbox issue, who knows. It works totally fine any time but not in combat.
---
I feel like resilient enemies should only be like 30% of them. I don't understand why they would all be. Especially when it's the assaultron at the end. Can't even get close to it because I get turned into spaghetti-o's
---
Any arm chair pvper can know about the game with actually being qualified. Just like Monday morning quarterbacks.
---
Did my first one and got the whistle in the dark plan, cool but crap gun unfortunately.
---
I think I might have missed something. How did this ammo factory work.
---
Are you sure that assaultron is female?
---
I think I could nail it in v94 (after trying it a number of times in PTS) but no way in burrows.
---
Damn I thought it was coming in this update
---
Places we prolly haven't visited since we were very low levels like Morgantown airport. The interior is large enough i think. How about Vault 76? I'm not sure on that one because if a new player were to start up they would be in for one hell of a surprise lol can u imagine waking up with that hangover to absolute chaos, level 100s or more running around killing everything in sight with explosive weapons, the new explosive legendary perks lol.
---
is it only in combat? It works any other time for me
---
Take a shower.
---
This actually  happened  to me the night before  the patch. Took out some scorched but their dog just would not die...
---
My group runs two people with gun and two with melee. Clear it on elder difficulty with a minute eto spare.
---
BECAUSE EGGS DON'T RHYME WITH COOP.
---
It's not a positive change for the majority of people.  The only people championing it are the ones that support any change implemented.    
---
Like I've said 100 times, and despite the downvotes I've never had any counter arguments: a balance was 100% needed, but just nerfing everyone while buffing all monsters at the same time, and not updating the DOZENS of base weapons and affixes that are in dire need of a buff was possibly the worst way to go about it.
---
As a new level 50 who's best weapon is a level 45 lever trifle, I just got wrecked by a gang of 8 lv50 mole rats. 😥
---
Let me educate you nerds lol.
---
Bloodied. I ran that way still do..
---
Vanguards I ran that way.. i still do.
---
Damage for The handmade was just barely under a fixers damage. 1shotting wasnt always a thing.
---
in a group you really cant 1shot never could.
---
They were probably using buffs None of you thought about that.. The builds probably also used those bugged magic weapons that have those legendary prefixes.  you all whined like children and complained and complained and complained now look .. you get to use way more ammo now.. feel very proud of yourselfs.. enjoy
---
Cool. I will give it a go. When I lauhced last year I was too low level to do vault raids.
---
I can just imagine the few power armor melee builds saying, "Yeah, nows my time to shine!"
---
As a level 115 I totally  understand. I played an hour today, died a bunch, used up the ammo I had, and got nothing for it except one level on the scoreboard. Ammo has been a shit show for me since the beginning, but now I can't hold on to any at all.
---
And then then it seems there's a possible degeneration of game performance.
---
Since your the boss man I hate you....jk maybe not really might need a job
---
If that works for you then fair play. I must admit I did stop using stims after the 2nd objective because I was just using them too quickly.
---
I had white shelves, locker, bed with green blanket, 2 rustic end tables, 2 Thanksgiving Displays, 6 posters, the earl totem, a cabinet, a file cabinet, ammo maker, L shaped chem bench, bwd with green blankets, footlocker, PA crafting bench AND sofias console with 3 TVs on top inside it. Plus a couple rugs. 
---
I didn't have any problem with the walls. 
---
Now I do. 
---
Doubt I'll get half that in there now. 
---
Bottom line is I checked this thing out before buying. Someone had built one at a workshop. 
---
If it had looked like this I wouldn't have bought it, it's too small. 
---
\&gt;:(
---
I only need 4 Cobalt and 2 Violet :)
---
Go be a "photomode expert"
---
I just bought a Vampir explosif Combat rifle 300 caps for my Commando Character, especially for this Daily Ops...i feel so smart, sorry.
---
I think that some ppl don't understand is that these (Daily Ops) are challenges. I'm pretty happy that this today daily ops give a rebirth to the Vampir legendary effect. 👍
---
[Edit:] I just wanna add that in this today daily ops you don't need to kill anything...but the boss. Just think about it guys...
---
[Edit:] I completed this 8 minutes challenge, on my PA Bloodied Heavy gunner, only by standing there poping diluted stimpaks...
---
I accidentally forgot to equip it first :/ I’m only 20 levels from my last slot though so I should be fine. I’m a shotgunned with over 8000 shells still, so I should last those 20 without having to craft
---
I dont think there is 100% consensus yet, but from Angry Turtle's video and my own testing, explosive damage is buffed. Especially with demo expert (int) equipped and ranked up. 
---
I know my TSE handmade now outdamages bloodied or junkies in my own testing, for example, and the theory is the damage comes from the 2x explosions, which both have buffed damage.
---
Might be a bug or intended, I'm not clear yet.
---
Edit: did some more testing on a JE laser rifle. Without demo expert, 1 shot is about 60% of a lv 60 radiation rumble glowing one's hp. With 4 pts demo expert, it's 1 hit kill. Minimal 80% bonus in my base damage haha.
---
Agreed went through 50 stims just with my auto stim armor. 
---
Side rant: HOW TF did they fix the pathing in the confusing burrows, but they can't fix the pathing at an open area workshop?
---
I understand what he's saying though. He spent his time on a build with a certain play style in mind and now he's disappointed that over night his brand new build got nerfed by over half the damage. Plus in a pve game the damage output wasn't hurting anyone. Some wanted a more challenging game and others were happy feeling like gods. People like different things.
---
I'm grinding out the rainbow 6 battle pass atm, I switched to fallout and dripped out in 10 minutes. It doesnt feel good at all. I have 4 hours a day to play so think I'll stay on R6. Added context I finished the legendary run 3 weeks before it ended.
---
Haha sounds like you're going in a lot more prepared than I was. Good luck and have fun! Stealth won't ever be an option in uplink so it's good you're not relying on that. Piercing gaze sees right through everything.
---
you'll get a quest to check out a note
---
I'd just like a map app so I dont have to press start to go to my map and it updates at a set refresh rate.
---
Right?  If you die you don’t even drop your loot so who cares.  Run, die, run.  Worked once, I’ll try two more times for the weekly and call it a day
---
Sounds like you should be wearing power armor.
---
Gonna save so much time in the long run, I doubt it but I hope they go even farther and make certain cards passive perks
---
Oh k didn't even think of piercing rounds. I haven't come across any yet. How would I find armor piercing rounds ?
---
Also, sometimes it scraps the animated ones!! 😡😡😡
---
I actually had a B25 10mm pistol saved for when meat week returns so I didn’t have to waste heavy weapon ammo on what was trash level 10  at most mobs. Now I guess it’s going in the scrip machine
---
Ya
---
I mean that was just today's Op, the others may be better suited to bloodied and stealth
---
If you have a mix of urban and forest scout armours it won't work.
---
It sounds like it, more each update and each update is about a month inbetween
---
Oh and it was NEVER cylindrical, it was a dome inside, just like outside.
---
I hope they find other exploits and I will use them this time around. Garbage
---
K
---
They removed that because it was antithetical to the concept of treating the animated cards as collectables.  Even if people had multiple copies of gold cards it would always be in their best interest to burn every single one and just use a normal card.
---
I have never understood why these limitations exist at all.  What is the value?  The downsides are obvious.
---
I definitely couldn't do this one alone as a melee build, I was ok if I could take them on one on one but the big group no way. But with even one other person with a good gun it goes pretty quick. I wasn't able to break the 8 mins today
---
Noooo, are you PS4 that's my favorite gun. I have one but I know people who would love it too. I'll trade a BE250 lever for it.
---
Pain
---
Read my last reply every time you respond, save me some time.
---
Works well really. You should hide in between damage taken and just rebuild health with pot shots.
---
+1, I also prefer the summary image for quick camera roll access on my phone, thank you!!!
---
Yes it does. I have a couple that I use. Not a bad weapon for what it is.
---
Shame sourcing ammo for it is a bit of a pain.
---
Perks (Tank Killer), Legendary rolls (Anti-Armor) and magazine moda (Piercing and other variations) all give varying amounts of armor penetration. Unfortunately there are no special ammunitions unless you count Ultracite.
---
No worries
---
Idk
---
Xbox sadly ;(
---
Clearly you are mad at Bethesda's nerfs and are taking it out one everyone else. No one is saying you should quit. Stop being ridiculous. I hate the nerfs too and wish most of the changes were reverted.
---
But the Daily ops is harshly timed based for the rewards, and you get one chance per day to get the elder-tier rewards, so don't expect ppl to be ok with your build if the damage you do is superfulous. You can play however you want, and this is going to sound mean, but that doesn't mean others have to like it. I am bloody fixer build, yet the enemies still go down in 1-2 hits when I use a melee weapon.
---
Oh, he’ll yeah they do! One of my alts is a Bloodied Heavy Gunner and her B/FFR/FR LMG is so much fun to use. 
---
Cheap ammo, too.
---
It’s a bug that also happens with the harpoon gun and I think one other weapon. Only happens to me in 3rd person. It has been reported tons of times with video evidence...but Bethesda.
---
I really hope that’s the case and intentional.
---
Yea.. dont forget using alot of ammo because mele weapons are worse then they were. 😂
---
Im hope the new legendary perk will help with the ammo costs
---
I feel like this isnt getting  the attention it deserves.
---
Lost a brain cell after that one.
---
Put it your vendor for about 15k at least. Don't scrip it.
---
Thats a respectful answer. But my style of play is everything stackable plus bobbles mags and food to melt anything in seconds. Even after all that builds now are useless. Junkie bloody it dont matter damage is cut in half. Im sorry but that isnt fun. I come into a server and do 3 queens and a sheep. Now why do i wanna do that and waste 10x the ammo chems and stackables do do half the damage? There is no reward for that now. It 100% needs to be addressed.
---
I mean, I didn't ask what you had in there...I was just telling you why they were changed.
---
If you're really that unhappy, all. I can suggest is that you log a case with support. It might not achieve anything but it can't hurt to try.
---
Right? Why are they rushing you? This makes no sense would be awesome if they stayed in the vicinity of a spawn point and you came across them as playing this whole - come at you full speed S is just lame.
---
This. Far too many buzzkills in this game. Running around like Stasi spies. Nauseating.
---
Yeah ironically I found it in a vendor for just a thousand caps lmao. Not gonna scrip it tho for sure. It’s apparent that at least some people would give good stuff for it
---
I looked at nexus mods a little while ago and the creator of the load out mod said he should have an update pretty soon.
---
Same
---
Update: The glitch only happens if I'm in my power armor when I use the RL.
---
id love to find out power armor locations
---
From the ones I saw (I don't own it) they looked pretty cylindrical to me.
---
Nope didn't work, it keeps disconnecting me from the server, sometimes immediately sometimes after about a minute.
---
You could say they never left...
---
ammo factory + ammo smith both maxxed
---
Bloodied didnt always 1shot.. especially in a group. 
---
Being stealth with low health didnt always pan out in our favor.. once they see you its over.. you end up dumping 2 to 4mags into a enemy ..  Ive used 3or more rounds from time to time depending on the situation. Good thing i can change builds.. The new players are screwed.
---
You can buy the ranks from 1-100 for 15000 atoms
---
This wouldnt be a bad idea at all. That town is probably one of the largest "settlements" with a lot of room for vendors, and npcs. Who knows, maybe itll become brotherhood town in the future.
---
It's an amazing pistol and I have zero pistol perks. The B2525 is my holy grail.
---
I just tried uranium fever, a bunch of level 75-100 3* miners. And they're tanky enough that there were no issues with one shotting. Genuinely a fun event now while I was trying out some new weapons
---
I really can’t wait for green house walls, they’re going to make my modern house so much cooler.
---
Scrap them more slowly.
---
I did it by myself in 10 minutes for my one and only run so far. It was more annoying than hard having to shoot everything then run up and gun bash it. But i wouldn’t say it was hard. I run a heavy gun PA build so maybe that’s why.
---
30 minutes is just enough time to go and load yourself up with enough crap to become super overencumbered when the timer runs out and you're nowhere near the bench to save yourself.
---
...can I have some Wood Scraps?
---
Very glad I convinced my low level boyfriend to be a bloodied commando build bc that’s still viable and effective.
---
The ways games are supposed to work is you start out weak grow stronger as you progress until you become a bad ass mofo 
---
You start in a low level area and move out to other areas.
---
Now with this update I'm no longer a bad ass.  I'm no better than a level 5 new player.
---
I almost died using my best gun doing a event I usually rip through with a 10mm pistol.
---
I put in the hours to become a bad ass and now its all gone.
---
Its a joke.  The legendary perks only repair the damage done by this update,  they are pointless.
---
Go look at my original post and see how many people disagreed at first. Then they started playing and realized the game is complete trash now. I dont even see a reason to play anymore. I deleted my first account already. The game is an outta control dumpster fire.
---
Does anyone know if the electric discharge mutation can activate electric absorption?
---
thanks for asking this... i got confused with the whole fact that the effects last for x amount of time. didn't realize the addictions are permanent like mutations.
---
You can buy the ranks with atoms
---
Have you done the daily ops yet solo my dude? I’m a bloody heavy with all the non legacy god rolls and I had to have died 20 times. That was the wake up call for me and then I imagined being a commando build (which let’s be honest a huge number of people are) who couldn’t spec to melee easily
---
Muh conomy
---
Sadly the quest ends within minutes after that.
---
WHAT??    
---
I got 4 levels already but haven't claimed anything.    
---
I hope the Protein Shake maker isn't far after that. GAINZ!!!!
---
Did turrets get levelled up to compensate or are we going back to the 1 foundation god awful looking towers that were meta at launch?
---
Yeah, the Gutsys deal pretty hefty damage, as do the Protectrons with the Robobrain tracks. I got rushed by a few of those and it was game over haha.
---
Hmm okay, so it's not a perk conflict. Are you using super duper to?
---
It's a little of column A and a little column B. 
---
Like you, there's overall less that interests me but at the same time, based on what people have looked into, also less overall effort is required to complete the run.
---
Some people support anything.
---
It's just fixers
---
I feel the same
---
As a Fallout 1 fan I want the brotherhood bunker and that's it
---
Feel free to add me! ToxicFluffle
---
I'm on right now. (:
---
No sir. I needed that bench press, like ASAP.
---
Well it's more common for 3* enemies to drop 3* gear than it is for 1* enemies to drop 3* gear 😁
---
Todd is on his way to your place now...just a heads up
---
Single player is not scaled.
---
 if you use a vats build you can't "bash" while in vats. 
---
Exiting vats is a pain in the ass because it tries to select next enemy if you select an enemy that is already down to "bash" time then switching in vats keeps selecting the same one because they are nearly filling screen.
---
Rushing enemies suck - let us use the "dungeon."
---
used more stims in one attempt than have in months.
---
Have 4 pieces of broken armor and 2 guns
---
Used a S ton of ammo.
---
There is more...but I really don't care that much  :-(
---
Lmao damn that sound like hell
---
I'm able to join nuclear winter lobby so i don't think its my fo76 files
---
maybe try a search next time, 200+ have reported this already, and bethesda have replied
---
Finish "the missing link" quest to fix the bug. Had the same problem earlier today and found a Reddit comment saying to do that and it worked for me.
---
Deff would like a “Convert all” option.
---
Howwwwwwwwwww
---
Sounds good! I’m on right now too, entering a new world real quick. Thank you so much! I’ll add ya, I’m TheHouseOfLight :D
---
It was a pain finishing it, but I genuinely enjoyed the experience of going in, failing the solo elder, re-evaluating my perks, trying to optimize my route...you know, not just running in and instantly winning a giant cookie? Finally found that marathoner with a vampire's explosive handmade got me up to the boss room within 6 minutes
---
The only thing getting strong at the bench press is good for is 1.  Pushing Bubba off you in the prison yard and 2. Bench press competitions.
---
Does that station have a script machine to go with it?
---
ITV didn’t say that. The Roadmap says it will be released during Fall. So hopefully soon.
---
It also depends on how you want to play. I don't like stealth so I'd rather charge in with my Plasma Gatling or Appalachian Thunder Pipe and shoot anything that moves.
---
Thankfully the Daily Ops are optional so you don't have to do them.
---
If you are close enough to the objective, there is a small boost to how fast the progress bar goes up. I think it's 2 and a half minutes if you solo it and stay in the zone for a 1x boost the whole time, not sure about 4x but it's definitely noticeably faster with a full team
---
Oh right, I forgot that was enabled immediately, unlike last time.
---
Expensive way to do it.
---
I’m kicking ass still with my blooiddd melee build , unarmed is much weaker now though . Switched to two handed and I’m still one shoting mobs.  Sucks I can’t hit like bus anymore lol
---
Fluorescent flux is all over the sundew grove by fissure site prime.  That's how I keep my magic prime LMG fed.
---
The biggest change that I noticed was that I would comfortably be able to handle up to 6 or so enemies at once without breaking much of a sweat. Now 2-3 is more the sweet spot. After that, it starts to feel like you're being overwhelmed. At least that was the feeling I had today with my bloodied build.
---
Thankfully my daily ops groups arnt tardos.. if I solo daily ops imalways like 30 seconds shy if elder
---
Can confirm my Bloodied Unarmed build(3/5 SS Uny pieces) is poop.  Did the daily op, died hella times to robots and dear god, they made a super assaultron....
---
Didn’t see you mentioned it but the SS underarmor has camo elbow pads for no reason...  https://imgur.com/gallery/p8vHRXT
---
put a bayonet on your rifle for a bit.
---
Have ~~m~~any friends do you?
---
Have you tested out your bloodied melee build? Because my unarmed is still kicking ass and taking names. Sure on the absolute tank enemies I have to hit them twice but swing speed has me covered.  I won't be changing a single thing. 
---
To tell the truth I feel better now about the build (in my own head) as I can see the lvl 100 super mutant get smashed in 2 hits and all his buddies get smacked in one. 
---
Feels good, feels strong. 
---
One handed melee was always the weakest if that's what you run, you might be screwed idk. 
---
Good luck anyway.
---
There's better things to come, the games not dead I've a good feeling.
---
I've had an explosive one in my vendor for a while now, nobody wants it.  
---
Only a 2\*, and the first effect is Stalker's, so that might be why.
---
Ehh, too many people complaining about missing out on the item, too many AFKs clogging it up like nuclear winter. You get experience, treasury notes, caps, enemy loot, legendaries, rare plans/outfits, and sometimes unique loot like the fixer plan or riding shotgun caravan gear. Is all of that not enough?
---
Congrats I suppose.
---
But now it is your responsibility to test all the cool stuff and find the bugs before the rest of us unlock them!
---
Edit: Honestly, that is some GOOD looking Power Armor. I kind of wish they gave us a "Blank" version in addition to the Armor Ace Paint though.
---
I've seent'em
---
Well I think bloodied builds are screwed as Bethesda seemed to be really gunning for them.  Thankfully I was never bloodied, but I was an unyielding Junkie stealth.
---
The badges are the legit way, if you're lucky like that guy above you can find them in player camps.
---
I will give that a try, thank you!
---
If that’s where you get the most enjoyment in the game then I do feel for you, as grinding for the ammo/supplies just to burn through them all on spongey enemies does seem like it’d be a counterproductive grind before long. I rly hope they find a better way to balance things, some way that allows players like you to build a specialized character that is effective af but limited in the range of their capabilities while players like me could build characters that are extremely versatile but considerably less powerful. 
---
I understand that being a jack of all trades means being a master of none, but I love being able to improvise at a moment’s notice and be reasonably effective with any weapon I pick up.
---
That’s what I did. By using my  legendary perks wisely  I’m living much longer now then I did before patch 22.  Definitely have to commit to a build though . Can’t be as versatile as we used too. I’m a lvl 396 bloodied melee shotgun heavy build .
---
Low effort, yes, self evidently so. Garbage... I as with a lot of others would disagree.
---
It really does sound like you need to learn to apply a little strategy and not just run in head first. Ease off on the rads so you have more of a health buffer (don't worry, your damage won't suffer TOO much) or just being smart and setting up ambushes and arranging things so you're only taking on a couple of enemies at a time.
---
Not for Daily Ops.
---
Full health PA heavy user and still rip through all enemies easily
---
I’ve always switched back and forth between rifleman and commando depending on mood so it’s the way to go if you’re worried. But try it out before you loose all hope.
---
No, I am not "Mald". I am irked. Something I was looking forward to turns out to suck and then idiots attack when I express my opinion. If I was "Mald", I would do something retaliatory, instead of simply blocking. Which I have done.
---
Your lack of self awareness is astounding.
---
They appear to be boosted for enemies as well.  Blood eagles turret turned me out on my first encounter.  I learned my lesson to actually fear the turret
---
stealth doesn't work in daily ops\*. because of course it doesn't.
---
now couple that with the resilient trait and I feel like killing myself.
---
Xbox. With my luck I’m guess you aren’t? Lol
---
I just continuously re did the thing over and over again
---
Yes! Not convinced "taking one for the team" is working; unequipped it at 2* and it is sitting in the perk choices at 2* still.
---
Super tanks PA Heavy here, using an Ult.Gat laser with Vamp’s primary. I got teamed with a bloodied melee on my last run, let me just say... my god that was beautiful. I’m holding ground eating the aggro, taking almost no damage, I just sweep the room and they follow the lasers cleaning up. Leader bot downed in like five seconds, no damage to either of us.
---
Dude. You're making a gross of bullets with five pieces of lead and handful of plastic like some kind of munitions Jesus and you're complaining about having to two-shot enemies?
---
The gun bash mechanics have always been janky but I thought it would be easier than switching between weapons. I'll get a strategy, eventually
---
I still like my stealth bloodied build but it was useless in the Daily Ops. I had to go full-health vampire's shotgunner in Troubleshooter's Armor to get the job done. I don't plan on respecing, but I definitely need to start playing more dynamically.
---
This is "stupid shit", but you're spending your time here. Don't replying. I'm blocking so I don't have to endure your idiocy.
---
Yes, and it was a lie. Or Beth was straight up just misinformed. Guessing the second.
---
Yeah, it's not too bad
---
I couldn't get on with bloodied/unyielding. I tried for a while but I switched back to Vanguard Vampire.
---
Hellfire PA has been broke since it was introduced. It’s insane
---
Enemies can drop their star number or lower, it's randomized.
---
I alr know that bru its just not everyday that i get 12 3* drops in a row
---
Yo momma
---
Yep. Me and the wife went in, and if it were not for the damned melee kill thing we'd have been fine, her on her stealth sniper, me on my big guns PA build. With the two of us and resilient, we literally cannot kill them fast enough to advance forward, even when i swapped to melee. I was okay with the vamps grog axe for a while, but eventually we got five resilient gutsies with the death gun arm attachment, and we simply could not spawn and down one before we died. Even trying to run past and rush the objective was impossible by then.
---
Ammo factory and ammo smith stack multiplicatively, Super Duper doubles the base amount of ammo you'd make without them.
---
I didnt complain about that. Read it again
---
Thanks tips. Maybe try learning how to talk to people properly and not being ignorant.
---
I'm unclear on two things, can you keep repeating the op for a chance at the rare rewards? or is it a once a day chance?
---
and the traits are the same throughout the day, right? gotta wait until reset for them to change?
---
Let me spell it out. They swarm. 6 on one average. There is no bottlenecking. They dont care. They swarm anyway. Im lvl 82.
---
This is seriously the worst bug I’ve ever had. Ruined my first daily op. Went on the entire 10 minutes. Bethesda could just remove that sound effect entirely and solve it.
---
A buddy and I have been using Daily Ops to Farm ammo. He used 2H melee and one shots them while I hold the weapon and they drop the ammo for the weapon I hold.
---
He is Wallace and he is an agent of freedom
---
DON'T TRUST THE GOVERMENT
---
Mine just finally updated, I logged on and appeared at my camp, and 3 mutants killed me before I could turn around. I turned the console off
---
I can place it at team members camps
---
Yeah I would trade out Far Flung Fireworks for something else my man. If you watch Angry Turtle's video where he tests each perk card he found that when he even got far flung to trigger that it barely did any damage to enemies.
---
I feel like it was alot to get at the same time, heres all lvl 50 everything everywhere oh but we nerfed your weapons. Have fun lol. I had been able to run with a non legendary fixer and 1/2 shot things, with my melee build. Now I have to run melee all the time as I figure out if I should restructure.
---
Explosive laser rifle, I'm busting you back out.
---
Nope, I need the lvl 99 greenhouse roof and walls.
---
Check your gunpowder I've had weighing me down from time to time
---
It only works if someone else is on your team. If you're in a team, but the only person, it will not activate.
---
Also, good luck finding troubleshooting armor and weapons after the way daily Ops perform
---
I've been trying to find a couple Vanguard Leather Arms or Legs with weapon reduction for months. Apparently no one has them, or if they do they aren't willing to trade them.
---
Guess it's the Secret Service grind for me.
---
I cancelled my FO1st sub. I'm quitting the game. Sadly, I can no longer can I enjoy the game. I'm actually gutted. This has been my favorite game but I think after burning myself out on S1 and then being met with these changes when I logged in today, I just don't feel much for the game anymore. Gutted. :(
---
learn to follow the rules, and stop mindlessly posting redundancy
---
What exactly is so bad about them? I kept hearing so much. Then I found a level 60 mole rat. Sat there waiting for him to take a bite. Took off a good 3-5% of my health bar. Then it died in two shots from my auto combat rifle

Good to know, I'll probably slot What Rads then
---
Even me as a high level character without fallout first it's tough. I use way too much ammo for most of my weapons to still be viable. I do have weapons that are still good, so I just do daily ops over and over so I don't use too much ammo and resources.
---
You forget that bloodied comes at a huge cost of health. If you don't one shot everything, you're the one who will most likely get one shot. I just did the daily op by myself and I died like 15 times and couldn't do it in less than 16 minutes. So they might as well get rid of bloodied weapons altogether because the damage output doesn't match the risk at going around with only 10% of health.
---
I am a full hybrid Str build. I was able to max out 3 cards, and upgrade twice the 4th. My Specials pre patch were: S:15,P:3,E:4,C:7,I:9,A:7,L:11. I maxed out the legendary Str ,Per and Int cards, freeing up 5 points for me to realocated, so now my special is S:15,P:9,E:6,C:7,I:14,A:9,L:11. With the last 3 cards, im planning on getting legendary endurance and either luck or agility (havents been able to choose) while leaving funky duds on with ammunition factory to swap to whenever I run out of ammo.
---
Had finally found a bloodied faster swing speed cultist dagger that looks great with my characters cosmetics and camp design. 
---
Was able to kill most enemies between 2 and 3 swings. Upon logging in today was taking upwards of 10 swings.
---
Unarmed feels just about right but was really hoping 1 handed weapons would have been brought a bit closer in damage given how many perks it takes to max out the damage for them.
---
Managed to rearrange some perks to get it within 4 swings but still feels every weak compared to other melee weapons.
---
I've been playing a non-bloodied unarmed build since launch and I didn't have any trouble soloing it 5 times in a row.
---
Just think of it as a reintroduction of classic Fallout karma. This is the karma bloodied stealth VATS snipers are getting for all those times they OHKO'd everything during Primal Cuts.
---
It’s almost equal to the Tesla rifle FPS issue they just fixed.
---
I couldn’t move, stim or anything!
---
Haven’t read too much into it, but why exactly is it dead? I run a vague bloodied death claw build
---
I guess I have to ask.....how is it that you're one hitting enemies that are lvl \~60? What weapons, perks, etc are you using to accomplish this?
---
bloodied is still top lol
---
And "Assassin's" stuff should work on Blood Eagles now too.
---
Don't try to solo it. Also the more enemies you kill, the more that will spawn. So kill what you need to and then gtfo. Of course there's a point you have to hold ground, but a lot of trash can be skipped. Robots that you have to melee kill was not an easy Op to start us on.
---
Cant go wrong with a commando build.
---
Mald
---
The thing is that I scrap a non animated one and it ends scraping the animated....
---
Eh still a decent amount tho
---
Read the patch notes
---
I'm at level 85, and it feels like I'm doing no damage. When a mirelurk takes 4-6 shots from my 2shot Gauss Rifle, there's an issue. The only weapon I have that feels effective is my Anti Armor Gatling Laser, or maybe my gauss rifle, if I get a headshot. My explosive lever action is just useless now. Hopefully I can get my settler reputation maxxed out soon enough and I can start using the Gauss Shotgun. Maybe then it'll feel like I'm actually doing something.
---
Edit: Off topic, but am I the only one who thinks having resiliant robots as the first Daily Op wasn't a great idea? Resiliant *anything* day one seems bad, but particulalry robots.
---
Share please so this guide becomes popular
---
I am rather curious at how your cards handled that mess of dead things. Mine dropped to 2-3 frames at 4k( crappy RTX 2060 super OC)
---
Honestly I don’t really feel like these should be done solo, public groups are easy enough to join find one that is using the op bonus and they’re more than likely willing to run the op.
---
Unfortunately you do have to leave VATS (which I also found frustrating) to bash the only other alternative here is to use a melee weapon. This modifier will not be on everyday if you can’t work around it you might just have to avoid this one (if you’re only planning on playing solo)
---
Rush and holding out on point wouldn’t be such an issue if it wasn’t for the melee to finish modifier like I said this isn’t going to be on every single day.
---
I’ve had to many stims for too long I’ve dropped hundreds in the last few weeks alone it’s nice actually having a place to use them, depending on your build you many want to change some things around to reduce the damage you take or increase how much healing you get from each stim.
---
I didn’t break a single piece of armor or any of my weapons on both of the runs I did, gutsy are a mean enemy but they won’t always be the enemy we verse and I suggest using perks to repair your armor and weapons to 200% also there perks to reduce the amount of degradation from weapons (I don’t bother with armor) and it’s not to bad to repair with the amount of excess repair kits I have from last season and from the Queen.
---
As far as I know you’re meant to get all the ammo you use back?
---
I haven’t actually looked but I shot maybe 20 shotgun shots before swapping to a melee weapon and I got 220 back at the end as a reward.
---
The real rate is somewhere around 40%, but rng is questionable in a game as unstable and laggy as this
---
I haven’t had that happen yet and I’ve scrapped about 200 cards so far. Sorry to hear you’ve had a different experience.
---
grammar police
---
 “a ammo box” should be “an ammo box”
---
&gt;  a lot of folks NEVER use melee
---
I never use it because my character has only 3 STR so can't hurt anybody anyway, and half the time I end up popping a grenade off at my feet because for some insane reason it's the same button depending only on how long you press it.
---
I’m bloodied and can barely tell a difference
---
Had this same question but didn’t wanna test it lol word
---
Bad news buddy...to be fair I only tested it with one rank of each rifle and pistol perks. But I was not impressed, a headshot on a super mutant while stealthed and bloody just chipped it. I could be wrong, being Iam a melee build who use a gun as a secondary...but automatics maybe where it's at.
---
And to think everybody assumed it would be the high level bloodied stealth commandos complaining today.
---
You can go in alone but your team will be able to see that you are in, there is a global alert that goes up and then it is next to your name in the bottom left team info. I don't believe you can stop anyone from coming in with you tho, they can join at any time.
---
I saw where they indicated the Assassin's effect for weapons works on Blood Eagles but couldn't get confirmation whether the armor will work as well.
---
You can repeat the op but once you earn each reward rank that day, that's it for the day.
---
swap weapons between characters! like D2
---
If your on PS4 it’s beacause it’s a giant update and I have the same issues sometimes it takes weeks to download but just be paitient
---
Where are you playing in the map? That also a factor now.. 
---
The game has lvl sync but it also has lvl range.. keep that in mind
---
bloodied is still dealing the most damage. although I suppose some people would consider the difference between low and high health builds marginal, so it depends on whether it's worth it for you.
---
I'll be staying bloodied because F gathering mats. I want to minimize that portion of the game as much as possible. I despise inane busywork. and I feel going forward the meta will be a sneak command/PA heavy gunner hybrid. you can make it work with enough coins, sneak around trash mobs and hop in your PA for bosses. best of both worlds.
---
It's a very inconsistent and random bug. There seem to be a few key factors - I have only seen this happen on a missile launcher, harpoon gun, and the settler gauntlet so far. It is completely random. Once in a while you will just get it. It will stay for a while and be pretty consistent. And then it won't happen again for many dozens of hours. It seems to happen more often in third person? But it's not common enough to be able to test that effectively. It's been around for a while, I think over a year since I first saw it
---
Its all about speed. I've been server hopping for a set of Troubleshooters Armor (and now Mutant Slayer) for a month or so now which helps tremendously. I could stay at 20% health for Adrenal mutation and then run up and whack things with my I/SS Mole Miners Gauntlet. I took laughable damage from everything (even the assaultron at the end) and could just run to the objectives and with a little clever wallblocking I could just stay in the circle and the robots would come to me. I'm a PA/Heavy Tank build that runs a shitty bloody build on the side when I get bored, took a few tries but once I got the pathing down it's easy to time it for Elder for that sweet sweet scrip farm.
---
Thanks but i don't think daily op will be robot only the first time i tried it for some reason i got it but in the mall at the south east of the map and enemies were blood eagles with stealth boys
---
Well melee really got hit hard this time, since the hit box bug still exists.
---
Just use sth else.
---
Every Uplink op, apparently, not every op period.
---
A handed weapons need more love tho. 
---
So many more perks required to get them to what barely amounts to half of unarmed usual numbers.
---
I know the faster swing speed is a major factor in their dps but it doesn't feel competitive enough. 
---
Really wanna keep using my bloodied faster swing speed cultist dagger.
---
In regards to weapon skins can the sheepsquatch imposter "skin" be changed to actually be a skin applicable to the salvaged assaultron head?
---
 Currently it's a crafted item not a skin.. utterly useless and a waste of atoms
---
Yeah you can't do shit online it just slows the hamster down.
---
Overnight download for me. In Australia stuck at fucking work waiting for home time to inspect the damage and start tinkering with my build.
---
As someone who never completed the raid before... and for I’m sure many new people between now and then, so much lore for me! Seeing the overseers terminal after everything else... exploring a now dead vault. Brings me back to the fallout experience
---
Yes, definitely faster than changing weapons.  Guess I’ll have to quit blaming the controller on my poor performance. 🙃
---
so I only get one shot a day at the rare rewards?
---
Level 63 pistol/stealth build with a CAMP near the Gorge workshop in the forest south of Morgantown. Logged in tonight and hopped across the screen to claim the junkyard. When the defend event started and the quest text showed 4 waves of Liberators, I got my recon pipe revolver out, went in to stealth, and got ready to plink the Liberators. Usually the turrets I plop down do most of the job for me.
---
6 level 50 Liberators spawned on the road and lit me up in seconds. I went from \[HIDDEN\] to \[DANGER\] almost immediately. I had to run screaming for cover while the turrets sacrificed themselves for me. Definitely a shock. 
---
Tried to do an ally quest after that, and I think my pistols would have worked better if I threw them at the enemies. I had a shotgun I got from the purveyor over the weekend that saved my ass. Going to have to rethink my whole build now. My perks are either pistol-focused, stealth-focused, weight, or crafting related. From what I'm reading here, they're all junk now.
---
Unfortunately my nephew and his Lvl.8 character keeps running into lvl.25-35 feral ghouls that kill his character in 3 hits.
---
So I don't think the enemies leveling to your character is working 100%.
---
Really? I was pushing 800+ dmg with a bloodied fss combat knife, now it’s ~200.
---
FeelsBad
---
I was excited to get a BE90 bolt-action during the mole sale 2 days ago.
---
Kinda sucks my Anti Armor heavy guns don't do much damage. Like My anti armor plasma gat would melt everything. Now Mirelurks tend to be unfazed by the Anti Armor. Instead of doing 100 for each hit. It's more like 35.
---
If you can pull off a half health kind of build, bloodied. But since I assume your strength is prolly low to run a fixer... King would be some combination of anti armor or explosive. Ideally two shot explosive for the dps. I'd take an AAE if possible. Or else vamp weap and plenty of stims and hop in pa with emergency protocols and nerd rage and maybe those legendary perks for the pa core recharge that also replenishes health, lol. Prolly not gonna want to be that desperate tho.
---
From my pts experience, super mutants and blood eagles don't require extra sets of armor. They do not do nearly as much damage as robots. But troubleshooters for sure is almost a must have for a non-PA characters.
---
I wonder what the [exercise bike](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/1/13/E3_Fallout4_VaultTecWorkshop_Experiment.png/revision/latest?cb=20160613084349) will give you.
---
I mean, c'mon now. That thing has to be a reward in another Season.
---
Actually, you can to some degree. Depending on where the camp module is located and the direction it is facing.
---
I dont, im sorry that I just have common sense 😔 its one of my biggest flaws
---
I treasure him.
---
I agree.. having a blast with the higher level enemies and new content!
---
Instigating/Anti Armor semi-stealth build is what I roll with. My nerf was minor, and with Legendary Perks applied, I have almost no noticeable difference.
---
Naise, hated always getting lost looking for that bot
---
Was it wrong of them to take it from you? Yeah. You should never take something away from a player once they have worked for it.
---
But Bethesda just royally fucked up, in this case it quite simply it should have never ported assets balanced for a single player game directly into a multiplayer game and expected people not to notice the massive difference. 
---
You worked for it, and you got it. As far as I am concerned you got what you deserved. Multiplicative dmg was always a bad idea. That was a fucking TERRIBLE idea. You go from lvl 1 monsters having 20 hp to level 110 monsters with like 100000 hp.
---
Balancing multiplayer games is almost impossible because as people's knowledge/skill rises, other things have to be adjusted. Balancing classes in WoW, Overwatch, Hearthstone, etc... is basically impossible, the power levels shift constantly to keep players happy and from things getting stale. 
---
Bottom line, bloodied dmg was way out of line. Your bloodied melee builds can hit for 40-100k PER HIT, because of multiple multiplicative melee dmg boosts. There are two options here, buff everyone elses dmg up, or get rid of the multiplicative bonuses and make dmg ranges smaller and easier to balance from multiple perspectives and from mob difficulty.
---
How on earth can you balance mobs when you have one guy hitting for 100000 dmg and another guy hitting for 1000 dmg and they are both the same level. It was fine when the game had no top end content, but now that there is... the game isn't fun for the rest of the playerbase who aren't bloodied.
---
I'm one of those who swaps out Lockpick and Hacker when needed. It's a hassle to switch but I'm more effective (or WAS, Glitchesda) as a Stealth Sniper.
---
I'm guessing that's where the difference locations and factions will come in, my understanding was that this was going to change up daily.
---
Anti armour got hit but because of its nature its multiplative so it has gotten more of a spot light.
---
Somebody who gets on the mic and bitches about that, you clearly don’t have any say so... I mean we all think we know where we load in relation to our camp module.... northish of it but we can’t fine tune it so much that a player gets stuck in an 1:8 inch thick wall...He’s not happy with his life, ignore him. That’s what the mute option is for
---
It seemed to really take the piss out of my Bloodied fss combat knife. I was pushing 800+dmg, now it’s ~200
---
Let's not fix the game? Why should a specific build have to do more work because Bethesda is lazy. Bash is just another function of the weapon.
---
 plus exiting vats doesn't work, all the time, if you are being hit at the time and switching enemies is a pain in the ass and always has been.
---
Yes
---
It's an RPG, what do you expect? This isn't a competitive FPS game. I didn't think I'd have to spell that out...
---
I only play on public teams. =/
---
Working as intended (no sarcasm). Well, at least the part about being an actual challenge.
---
Seemed a 50 cal auto was the way to go in there and probably all over now.
---
I swapped out hacker but I just left lockpick on because I had 15 PER and didn't feel like changing. Now with the Master Infiltrator card those points can finally go to something more useful!
---
I’m a bloodied build but unlike most people I use a bloodied shotgun (for some reason a really unpopular weapon) but when I hit something In VATS I do insane damage(don’t even bother shooting them without VATS it only seems to tickle them). I’m not even running any bonus shotgun damage perks. I use grim reaper to get my AP back and have two pieces of armor with AP regen, Obviously my armor is all unyielding.
---
I’m not on atm so I can’t check what other perks in running but if you’re really interested I can check later but I don’t think there’s much outside of that beside perks to avoid damage.
---
I got tired of waiting (still said 3 hours) turned off the PS4 and rebooted it. Says 85 mins. Too bad I got to be up at 5AM.
---
Bash damage and durability are going to be the new normal...
---
Once you achieve elder rank that is it for rarer rewards for the op for the day. That's how I understood it.
---
Boys?
---
the irony
---
Yeah, I’m only level 115 with no specific build and the game has become significantly less enjoyable with One Wasteland. It seems like a hard thing to balance - fun and challenging.
---
Don't you have to spend Perk Coins to unequip/equip a different one?
---
There are 3 kinds of people on /r/fo76 right now...
---
Whoooh naise.  
---
Tho I'm still worried what all the removal of the flame thrower trick fully entails.
---
I definitely don't have it in me to grind this one out like I did the last season. I'm going take a get what I get approach this time. That said, even if there was a few things I really wanted, I'm pretty camp budget limited anyways
---
You know what, I think I have a mistaken impression of you. For this I apologise.
---
Your comment is likewise something I can work with. 
---
Prior to this, based on your previous comments, I'd gotten the impression that you were actively gaming the system to inflate prices, partly for philosophical reasons and partly due to perceived and perhaps actual difficulties. 
---
There's still a lot that I disagree with in terms of your perspectives but at least that I can see that you're open to making the price checking tool a meaningful one that reflect actual real-world pricing. This is something I can get behind.
---
Hit me up with a discord link in my DMs (or here if you don't mind others knowing it) and we can have this discussion further. I have a lot of ideas regarding the mod and other potential strategies that I haven't gone into detail with here that might help with us meeting somewhere in the middle with our perspectives on pricing info.
---
We'll catch up soon.
---
Let me guess, Legendary run season started today as well. Looks like I am already behind.
---
My solution was to physically remove the key. And the bash thing is a serious problem and caused me a lot of deaths.
---
Just like the real thing!
---
It is coming soon, but that has nothing to do with the size of the update.
---
There’s 3 levels of rewards you can get. But if you get the highest level (Elder) for completing the op in under 8mins, you get all 3 levels of rewards. 
---
But you can go back and repeat it though you only get the basic level of reward when you do that.
---
Do you care to elaborate?
---
Regardless, there isn't exactly an instruction manual re: how to have players/yourself load into a favorable position. This is something that a player should not be responsible for; it should be a non-issue because players should load onto welcome mats.
---
What’s your general DPS if you don’t mind me asking? I’m assuming you utilize sneak attack bonuses, but just for the sake of asking, what is your general DPS just mobbing around, and does it work at all with melee?
---
I don't mind going through the mini-game.  
---
I've done both for so many hours in Fallout 3, NV, and 4. No need to max it out.
---
They needed to adjust weapons before this patch went live, but they didn’t.  The PTS players brought it up early and often, with almost complete silence from BGS.  Getting new content out the door and cleaning it up later is their MO ever since Wastelanders finally hit.  My guess is that the long delay cut deeply into profits and it’s a game of quick and dirty catch up for the remainder of the year.
---
As it stands right now, you can do pretty well with just about any automatic weapon, no matter what crummy legendary effects you pick up.  On the other hand, you really need a god roll and a min/max build to squeeze any juice out of a rifleman, archer or gunslinger build.  Melee isn’t quite on life support, but it feels like a constant uphill battle anywhere east of the savage divide.
---
My only suggestion would be to spec into some kind of full auto, but ammo consumption is definitely a real concern at lower levels.  It’s the path of least resistance right now.  If you can get someone to build you a Fixer with a powerful auto receiver for lvl 20/30/40/50, you should be in great shape.  45 ammo isn’t too difficult to manage.
---
We can hope that BGS eventually figures out that they need to reassess base weapon damage, but it probably won’t come until p23 at the earliest.  In the meantime, it’s probably safest to build primarily for damage as the best QoL feature available.
---
Well the melee weapons required more stacking than other weapons do, so when the multipletive stacking is changed to additive stacking , the damage decrease is the most severe.
---
The greenhouse building set, I’d give my niece for that. LOL
---
So, if you rank up cards and unequip them they still work, as in you still get the benefits, unequiped?
---
And the hitbox bug is still a thing....
---
Tell us how long they survive. 
---
I grew tired of wasting days server hoping for them to die immediately.
---
Yeah I mean it kinda did against most everything and if not 1 shot then 2. The reason you were screwed when you inevitably got detected is because you were an idiot and didnt use unyielding and used fucking vanguards for???
---
Yes, I caught a video of it, actually!
---
the 90 is w/o soper duper
---
this is on ps4 btw
---
It retained the rank up. Only the 6 perks you have selected are active.
---
It looked like it was apart of the One Wasteland update, but I guess not
---
I’m right there with you. I got to rank 10 today without even really grinding
---
I noticed this in the daily op here and there. I'm a melee build so I was running around finishing off robots and some of them that were at 1 hp, I'd hit multiple times and it wouldn't register.
---
So, i went for doing 5k damage to Earle, to doing 60 damage to Earle. Balance. Looks like you made a booboo with the melee class, bethesda ;S
---
Yeah my controller took some, undeserved, blame today
---
Thank God I never got rid of my unstoppable monster
---
Grenades people. Mines people. You don’t need a lot.
---
I mean, sure. I still wanted to vent about it.
---
Never tried vanguard, might need to look into that
---
Grahm got dumb.
---
I agree, and I run full health. But I like that I’m sitting up in my seat now, I don’t have my feet up on the Ottoman anymore
---
Hmm
---
Not much about this game is explained. Now that you know you can begin to account for this: moving your CAMP unit within your build space will change where people spawn in, yourself included
---
I noticed it was different last week too
---
I built 20 of these and made over 1M bullets. So yeah it was nice. Also, the ghost budget is fixed with this update.
---
Absolutely. If you don’t vent, you may explode.
---
That doesn't matter so much as actually having other people on your team.
---
Another key factor is that it stops working if whatever hit you loses interest for any reason. 
---
It has to stay aggro'd on you. Meaning it's not very useful against the Big Bosses like the SBQ or Earl.
---
I was just trying to illustrate that it was, in my view, a solution for a non-exsistant problem. 
---
And I did drop a ticket on it. Even tho I know it will be like shooting pool with a rope.
---
I wish I had them.  Gutsy’s are no joke when the can sniff you out like a blood hound
---
Everytime I try to take ammo factory some level 200 kills me repeatedly then just leaves the game
---
I think it was shown on the PTS but I can't find the source right now.
---
I'd try to get an instigating melee or executioner if you use it to finish things off. Or you could change over to heavy gunner and throw on power armor. That probably wouldn't be too hard of a switch as far as special goes
---
I am leaning that way also... I did notice something interesting. I of course use unyielding armor, and I have an executioners fss death claw that pushes ~300, and a bloodied combat knife that is around 200 now (used to be 800). It seems that different weapons are usable with a bloodied build, as before it was bloody rolls or nothing. Maybe it’s not so much a bloodied build as it is an unyielding build now, idk.
---
Probably kill for a fss bloodied death claw gauntlet now though. Something with a high DPS from the get go.
---
What exactly do you two mean by "Nuclear Winter" weapons? I've taken some big breaks in playtime, and am just recently getting back into the game, so I've missed pretty much everyting since Wastelanders was introduced. I also missped pretty much everything from when Nukashine was added, up to Wastelanders, so I know there's a lot I need to catch up on.
---
They probably do t have the floating damage text on.  I dropped a lot
---
This is useful. Thank you
---
Seems the biggest nerf is to QOL (food) builds. As a partially optimised build the update is a mixed bag for me. Ii figure I'll have to give up my long standing attachment to a few weight reduction perks or just accept the extra grind for more ammo/mats. Not a huge issue when I have time, but painful when I think about days with only 30-45 minutes available and I want to get my dailies/challenges done.
---
What even is a Magic Weapon? I've seen the term thrown around a ton, but have no clue what it means.
---
I prefer PA builds for myself, but I think a few Troubleshooter pieces may go a long way for you. Now I wish I hadn't vendored all of mine the past few weeks!
---
Not if you elect not to bother with class freak at all and only pop a Serum before a big fight. That’s what I do. No class freak, and a set of my serums before I fight anyone important.
---
I saw far flung is a horrible pick and does very little damage from one of the PTS players
---
That’s one of the things I based mine off of. I love the floating text option.
---
ahh, I see people responded while I was working out my full post...lol
---
At least I can add to the info on this bug.
---
Down near the floor yes, but it quickly started arcing inward. They made straight walls by starting at the height of the door and going straight down. The volume of space lost in one of the six sides is enough to completely enclose the Thanksgiving Display, which is not a small piece of furniture.
---
To be fair, they weren’t war zones when they were put there, they became war zones over time due to the Scorched and the Enclave (the Enclave being responsible for releasing the super mutants and the Scorchbeasts in the first place).
---
Did it ever i was at 1000 dmg with DCG now 400.
---
Hahaha, that sounds awesome i just unlocked that. Alright this will be fun. Idle on the bench press while making snacks? yeahhhhh
---
Are you hitting them with melee to finish them off? Because currently they only die to melee.
---
Gotta melee them. Only way to fully kill them off
---
I have all four vendors, a stash and a scrapbox in my bunker. I have a fusion genny out back with the through wall conduit running the power inside to a switch so I can turn off the vendors if I want. 
---
With this update the switch and the conduit are now behind a wall. That's how far the walls came in, the entire length of a powered switch. My shops still work, everything is connected so I've decided to leave it as a "legacy" bunker. I feel kinda special now. Oh and I did have posters on the walls above the scrap and stash boxes as well. Was a pain to get them up there not sticking into the wall, but it was doable. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/mIns0CD.jpeg for reference
---
Obviously it wasn't meant to be done solo. Even tho Bethesda said it could easily be done solo.
---
I quit before looting because no matter how many I killed there seemed to be more.
---
The armor I broke was "double repaired" but makes sense since I was constantly bring hit.
---
Get your stimpaks use thing, but I will blow through my 225 in about 12 days unless I remove my auto stim armor.
---
So from what I understand 5hat day one they released the HARDEST ONE?? Yeah I'm turned off permanently.
---
if your such a expert at the game then you would of used these builds hmmm smartass?
---
I gurantee you don't care because your using those weapons that are magic weapons.. goto youtube and look it up.😂
---
You can't go stealth in ANY of the Daily Ops.  Every version has the see through stealth mechanic, it's the other mechanic that changes daily.
---
I ran this with a fresh level 21 newbie backing me up (I'm 280). I made sure he went in using power armor. He managed to not die once while me as bloodied managed to only be dropped 3 times (he managed to pick me up each tome) during the event wind up, while the boss killed me dead about 3 times.
---
Thankfully they added an additional, closer,  respawn point.
---
Was all like, ah sweet a sentry bot boss.  Then was like, oh sheet oh sheet, not a sentry bot!!!
---
Rilly felt like a unique encounter that packed a punch, loved it.
---
Hell, I never knew some of the cards were animated. Lol. I bet I scrapped a handful of them. Oops
---
The boss was bugged beside a generator so I took my minigun and killed it in a minute and for the others enemy they are tougher than usual but does not very high damage beat the whole thing in 18 minutes first try but I didn't know about objective yet
---
Thanks for being the only comprehensive person here. Apparently, some people would be totally fine if they bought a chocolate bar and then the company came into their house and said: "Hey, you can't have the whole bar, here, you get only 20% despite the fact that you paid for what you got. Bye!" 
---
That's exactly how I feel right now!
---
Communist Bunker nerfed to useless imho.  the floor space is enormously reduced... who the heck asked for flat walls? Maybe if your main concern was decorating the walls, this was not the right prefab for you... Any chance they'll put it back?  I may have to ask for a refund at this point, this - as you say - is NOT what I bought.
---
GG
---
So frustrated wtf
---
If you absolutely must play a melee character go back to the basics, builds we used when game was fresh. A bloodied power armor 2-handed melee. I would imagine they do the job just fine and are tanky af.
---
When my wife and I build our camps - we often get the other person to fast travel to the camp in order to test where visitors will spawn. Moving the camp module until we have them spawning in the best position.
---
So if you have a friend that you play with get them to help test the landing location. Also note this it is different if a person travels to you or to your camp
---
I did have all the power armor perks before the ss armor and I've been running a powerfist. Maybe I'll look at switching
---
Yeah I think that was a big issue. Play test was only available on PC and I'll bet the most prolific play testers used their high level characters. They had lots of legendary perks to test as an incentive.
---
I recall at one point they even asked for people to try PTS as a low level character so they can get more data in that area.
---
They fucking ruined it for me. I wanted LEVEL ONE HUNDRED CHICKENS BETHESDA!
---
Everything still floats in mine (even the things baked into the walls now)...
---
This was rough. I managed to win once by going PA + Vampire Gatling Laser, and tanking as many robots as I could handle while my teammates cleaned them up.
---
Still sounds like a Bethesda problem. I intentionally placed my C.A.M.P. module in the location that I did. But, sure, let's say I move my C.A.M.P. module; how do I know that the new location will be a solution?
---
It would be pretty rad if I could intentionally choose a spawn point by placing a welcome mat instead.
---
I am level 6 and struggle to find ammunition. I'm new to the Fallout series so this is a little disappointing.
---
I also love this update. I'm a little bummed that some of my favorite weapons aren't nearly as good, but I have other weapons I can use. Overall it's a great update, frustrating at times, but still solid.
---
I switched to a stealth commando. Follow through really helps with it and legendary perception and agility make me hit for about 100 less than what my bloody build used to
---
No but I am now thanks! They can sense me while in Stealthboy
---
Took me about 5 minutes to download on pc. If even that.
---
Do AnYoNe ElSe ThInk???
---
Literally the same suggestion is posted here every day since the game is out...
---
Checking reddit also ruins any surprise because someone will get the item and post it anyway.
---
Thanks to datamines you know how many chances you have to get something before playing the event dozens of time getting nothing you wanted.
---
For example mole miner pales had awful drop rates and many people didn't bother farming them because of it, and some of the few people who did get the outfit plans crafted them and gave them to others for free. Dataminers help players, if you don't seek that help you can just skip their posts.
---
Daily Ops!
---
Exactly! I generally avoided the higher level regions because I want to be able to pick and choose when I face higher level foes; I wanna scavenge and hunting for collectibles (magazines for the atom challenges, for example) without facing level 50 everything all the time. I don’t like this change at all!
---
LOL I reassigned the bash key, to avoid WIN, but retraining myself to a new local was odd. Used to have a setting that disabled that key, when I launched games but that might be in my vid card or steam maybe??
---
&gt;legendary pa perk
---
Could you be a star and name this perk card, cheers!
---
Really interested in the BOS bunker and the greenhouse set - a few of the "game tables" (like the train set, shooting gallery, etc) look cool
---
If everyone isnt forced to use the system it wont work.
---
Pretty much every build is doing less damage so why wouldnt people just turn it off.
---
Kinda missing the point.
---
Sneak attack buff tho plz.
---
Just keep dropping the nuke one SBQ and Earl like all the other sad souls in purgatory
---
finally, now I don't have to worry about scrapping it on accident.
---
We need a scrap box that scarps the useless non-legendary weapon and armor pieces the game throws at us.
---
excellent - this was the first legendary perk card I equipped today. gotta make that damn ammo!
---
I’m a bloodied build and I’m happy tbh
---
Fuck i didn't even know they did this. Thats a great feature. I was wondering why combat skins didn't apply to fixers.
---
You made a post about how this is your problem: now that you know a solution you should play around with it. Demonstrate curiosity and a willingness to experiment with this game and you'll create a positive atmosphere for both yourself and your peers; make excuses, say "It's Bethesda's Problem!" and you'll probably be making more posts like this in the future :-/
---
There’s nothing I love than “killing” 5-10 armor piercing assholes and then having to run up and punch them to really kill them. Damn that kicked my ass and was a whole thing.
---
I mean, 1handed was never particularly good. I believe a DCG or a powerfiest out damaged the combat knife even with the stealth mod. so if you want to stay melee, definitely go unarmed with one of those two.
---
in regards to bloodied weapons, the additive nature of the bonuses is a lot less expressive now compared to before. you can use vampire's instead of bloodied for example, and still maintain a high damage output while becoming, well, invincible.
---
I think TSE is out damaging BE with some weapons actually. the bonus is so relatively minor that the double explosion is enough to edge it out.
---
Its always someone tossing grenades and gatling weapons and the entire lot of scorched is dead before I even see them spawn.
---
Not sure what game you play if you have never seen a douche hogging kills in an event.
---
Its an everyday occurrence in this game
---
My boodied deathclaw gauntlet was doing about 1,000+ damage. 
---
Now I think it only does about 200-300. I can still kill things by power punching it once, or punching it twice with the regular attack. 
---
Bloodied builds are still the best build in my
---
Opinion when it comes to damage. I die a few more times because the enemies are now tougher. But It hasn’t ruin my experience.
---
There is an entire season’s worth of rewards to grind for...literally is an incentive to come back to play everyday (although whether you like it or not sometimes).
---
I was at 1200 now 350...
---
That's what I thought, I was confused by your response.
---
Ty, Ty.
---
I had no health issues and did the same run past it all sit in the circle, mothman dance and the bots then to the next point repeat then cunt punch frankentron in the crotch.
---
Me too, except active camo. I’m predicting it’s going to be as bad as Halo 1 active camo energy sword elites on Legendary.
---
I managed to complete it solo but only because the Boss got glitched into a machine and couldn't back away. I think I died 1,744 times in 34 minutes, lol.
---
&gt;Ammo: Contextual ammo based on what weapon you have equipped when the Op ends. Includes fusion and plasma cores, regular and ultracite versions of all ballistic and energy ammo **(no explosives)**
---
Why must you do this to explosive weapons Bethesda.
---
Omg I'm going to work on this tomorrow
---
Electric Absorption it has a hidden bonus where it heals off of energy weapon damage and as for the bloodied build just use a vampire weapon and it's as easy as pie
---
The changes they've made in response to player feedback is the biggest reason I finally pulled the trigger and bought a copy last night (the $15 price tag did hurt either). 
---
Now I just have to wait for Amazon's COVID-delayed shipping infrastructure to actually get the game to me (reportedly 7-10 days, we'll see).
---
My disappointment is immeasurable
---
Interesting.  With all the changes, I forgot they reopened it for regular exploration.  I wonder if they covered over most of residential because it is such a tight little maze and easy to get lost in.  
---
Don’t worry, you’re not missing anything by having them inaccessible.  Mostly tiny rooms with dressers and desks full of randomized junk, all vaguely connected by collapsed walls and open doorways.  Nothing noteworthy, just confusing because every room looked mostly the same.
---
Unless you want to play stealth and complete the legendary run, specced for stealth, then, it matters.  But I guess you don't care.  It's not that hard to spec melee and heavy guns and shotguns btw.
---
All he had to do was re fast travel and it would have put him in a new location. That's what i do when people build their camps on cliffs or I get stuck in their walls. Just open the map and fast travel again lol but idk why I'm explaining that to you, you weren't the one being an ass about it 😂 
---
I get it, the spawn location at mine is in dirty water so I get parasites just about every time lol I can only assume that also happens to visitors. Sorry! But I spent HOURS on my camp and i can't bring myself to rebuild just bc of a goofy spawn location. 🤦
---
Just do like me and my friend, I run full 2h melee PA and he has a ts/e/reload handmade, he shot them low I bono them with my AA/40p/90 Tenderizer
---
Ran four instances tonight as a bloodied melee with a full set of unyeieding SS armor. I died a lot, but it wasn't too bad. I don't own any vampires weaponry, but did well with my bloodied fist and instigating deathclaw gauntlet.
---
I know right my stash is almost full of outfits and I don’t want to just toss em!
---
I spawned into my own camp under my porch lol and I've definitely spawned under foundations but I would never yell at someone or blame them
---
Hear this bethesda: let's make fallout 1st free so I can play the game casually again..
---
If they fix the hit box bug, 400 would still be decent.
---
I mentioned in another comment that it was unyielding that was boosting the damage, and not so much the bloodied roll. I guess you would include unyielding into a “bloodied” build, but realistically it seems that you can still push ~300 with say a vampires DG, and rads to keep you below 20%. It seems to have become more hybrid, and relies heavily on unyielding, at least out of power armor that is. I guess it does allow the use of other weapon rolls with a low health build.
---
Agreed. Super Mutants now need roughly a whole clip each from my Vamps assault rifle, and that’s with a bunch of commando perks! Sucks.
---
No, they said it was never intended to be crafted.
---
I play Fallout while working in a log yard lol.
---
Yea doesn’t make any sense, hope this is a settings glitch and won’t happen again
---
Could a medic be ok with full solar armor?
---
You "get" it. I worked really hard on my C.A.M.P. and I don't want to rebuild it. Also, I feel that the CA.M.P. module itself is ugly/I want to hide it. So, yup. Just gonna deal with it!
---
I'm pretty sure you can't level all those legendary perks at level 250. and I suppose with that many special points it's moot, but I see a lot of useless and/or ill-fitting perks.
---
I am a gauss shotgun build.  Before the update...I was rocking 427 a shot....VATS multiplier on a critical hit boosted that to almost 1100.  I was nervous when I logged in.  I check my weapon stats and I only dropped to 405.....but.  The additive vs multiplier, feels like I’m throwing rocks at higher lvls (80+). I do like the fact the daily instances drops ammo you are using, as well as the maxed out legendary ammo build perk (150%).  I’ll definitely be using more.  I don’t think this is the end of the tinkering with stats though.  Until then...this is life.
---
You can somewhat control where players spawn in. try moving your camp module around and testing it by fast traveling to your own camp. You generally spawn north east of where the module is placed. so by moving it, or turning around you can change the landing for fast travelers. This will not change where you spawn when you log in while at your camp. that is determined by the first place you set the module down before building.
---
I am using junkies heavy and bloodied meelee and commando. I have no idea what the fuck youre talking about these are all still viable youre just not gonna melt things like you could before and im saying its a good thing. Why the fuck would you use vanguards for bloodied sneak??
---
&gt;drain robot's HP with gauss rifle, only melee weapon can kill them
---
You have to admit the Resilient trait really makes no sense.
---
I find its only sometimes. For me at least when I first got on everytime I pressed start it wouldnt pop up but then afterwards it would every once in a while.
---
Buy something from a player vendor x5, place a wall decor x5, off the top of my head.
---
It's just a plan. Which perks do you suggest I can get rid of?
---
Thanks for the advice, will have to find a vampire weapon then 👍
---
R.I.P.
---
Bold of you to assume it’ll make it that far. I’m surprised it got *this* far to be honest. But then again, they’re making money off Fallout 1st and atoms.
---
I bought mine in summer 2019 for 15 bucks brand new on Amazon. It was way less of a game even then and I still felt like I got my moneys worth. Hope you enjoy it.
---
Exactly! Just use different armor or something; you don’t HAVE to min-max everything, you aren’t a robot, total efficiency shouldn’t be your aim, your aim should be to have fun playing the game.
---
Score.
---
It shows up every single time for me. And I have already done the mission.
---
Is it actually impossible to reach elder Solo for this one? No one has done it in the pts?
---
- Survive NW for minutes 10
---
- floor or wall decoration build 5
---
- buy/sell item 1
---
- complete 1 daily op
---
- complete 1 event
---
- complete 5 daily challenge 
---
- kill 1 legendary 
---
- level up 1
---
Uh oh...
---
I hide mine behind a tree 😂😂
---
Bring more than 2 weapons. I broke 3 in one not so great run. Fortunately I carry like 8 shotguns.
---
Daily ops are team based, it didn’t send u in solo, your team just didn’t join you.
---
Lolz i said i used vanguards and bloodied.. never said i used vanguards for bloodied. There ya go. 😂
---
BGS wanted us to have to farm more and play more hours so they took away our damage and made enemies have higher damage resistance and deal more damage.  Then they made them auto scale to you level ish.  End game players have legacy and magic weapons and armour to counteract this to some degree but are still buffed some.  Welcome to Farming76.  But hey if you had a pacifist build and mostly raise crops and decorate your house you won't notice much difference.. don't believe the Junkies build talk, junkies can be magic and that is why they think they are still doing the same damage.
---
I have mine locked up with my Collectron. 😆
---
You definitely need to max out the legendary ammo perk...as well as the regular ones. In my case(I use E2) the baseline build for 1x ammo is 15.  With all the Ammo perks...I’m up to 1x putting out 67.
---
I haven’t played too long today but from what I’ve seen, Bethesda has done a pretty good job with this update.
---
Yeah I was joking haha
---
They made the walls flat so that it was easier to place things inside of it. Gotta be grateful they even did that.
---
revives with rads and its not even really reviving its flashing you back to your current max with rads
---
I got scrap happy...
---
...and I liked it.
---
The only difference I saw tonight, as a bloodied stealth melee, was I had to hit things twice instead of one punch kills like before. For people to say the bloodied melee is dead is just silly. Not a huge difference.
---
Think you have just suffered this for the first time, it happens quite often. I can tell you with certainty that your AP should refresh when walking. Unless you are over weight
---
No weapon was nerfed.
---
Agreed. This patch has revitalized the game. It was much needed.
---
That sounds great.
---
Finally. Somebody with the guts to make this game playable.
---
When you encounter him out in the open, he sounds angry, his voice sounds like a regular angry super mutant. Always has for me. 
---
The only time he sounds different and friendlier is during meat week.
---
its pretty amazing
---
So as a level 85, I agree with everything other than One Wasteland. Legendary perks are great, Daily Ops seem really interesting (though, having resiliant robots on day one was a bit annoying) and Season 2 looks really cool, but One Wasteland is going to make things so much more difficult for me. When I need 4-6 shots from my 2shot Gauss rifle to kill Mirelurks in the Toxic Valley, it just makes things very unenjoyable. Hopefully they can adjust the game, and find a better balance soon, becaus I can't see myself playing like this for long.
---
Ah, nothing like intentionally misleading people.
---
Even at level 47 with a nearly fully built shotgun build and a TSE Double Barrel I take way more ammo than necessary to take down enemies. I should 1-2 shot them with that, but I need 4-5 now and at that point why even bother with a TSE when quad would be 10x better.
---
There there, it’s alright. They have to do this to make themselves feel better about the fact their brains are fucked because they’re failed abortions.
---
not talking about daily ops
---
I just PA and run past most of them, the holding points is kinda tough but that where stims come in. Serendipity just isn't procing for me
---
I play on the PTS and I see what their getting at, I do believe we could use a 7th for those that want to have their legendarys be nothing but the special cards. At least the post isn't bitching about the damage nerf like most new posts that'll come in the future.
---
Hope my perk deck don’t mind iiiit
---
Hey as far as im aware the only1 here mislead is you.
---
If it's any consolation, we told them on the PTS forum. We told them this was gonna be real fucking rough for new players. They knew, but they decided this was acceptable.
---
Hoping to see a change in this as well. Why do the bugs have to be lvl 50 too? I'm lvl 219 but a casual player, now I'm going to have to  research to optimize my build to keep playing like I have, I don't want to fight everywhere I go. I liked that I could run around the forest and one shot things with my non legendary fixer.
---
Also I couldn't find a single legendary today
---
None of the robots can be killed except by melee so you could not have killed it with a minigun.
---
That’s what I’ve been thinking all day. “This isn’t hard. It’s just annoying.”
---
Terrifies more than any other boss I’ve faced in the game so far except maybe the imposter sheepsquatch
---
This is a new physical copy of the Wastelands version, also from Amazon. 98% if my play will be dolo, but from what I understand it's similar to ES:O where you're just fine doing most things by yourself. 
---
In any case I'm excited because it's still new Fallout!
---
I use my LW
---
I haven’t played in a few months and ai haven’t really fully read patch notes, but did enemy NPC damage see some changes too? I swear I was getting into fire fights where, sure my damage output was lowered a bit, but it felt like I was also taking less damage than usual. It felt really awesome and leveled out!
---
Thanks...I can definitely buy an item, build 5 items, and NW. Does anyone know a guaranteed spot for legendary outside of event? I used to do riding shotgun but would take too long in the morning.
---
I did it solo if you know where to run with no distractions and if you kill the final robots at the bottom first. I did it in 7:10
---
Look up a YouTuber called tyr and find out for your self     AKA stealth vats commando
---
Wendigo spawn behind you after he dies
---
I feel your pain. Thanks to the plague I work from home, on my gaming rig, right around that seductive launch icon. So far I've been able to resist, but I'm weakening. With 2 young kids my evenings are already taken up, so no serious gaming can be done. 
---
C'mon lunchbreak....
---
I'm grateful they destroyed all my bunker build I took times to adjust everything,so now I have to deal with the length of the walls to replace my items 👍
---
Is this the extremely old issue of guerrilla vs gunslinger only applying to whatever it dropped as (auto or semi) and not what it’s modded to?
---
Oh thats a good one!
---
Yes, I just went through this for 15 minutes. It simply wouldn’t melee 80% of the time I pressed the button. I finally started just running away and doing objectives. I got halfway through and got booted from the server. Goddammit.
---
Yes, damage buffs are no longer multiplicative, but that goes both ways. Imo grinding for exp is much more fun than it used to be, as is running a lot of different events.
---
Did you learn the safari gorilla backpack? What's it look like? 
---
I got that plan from my one crafted ornate one and was curious if it's worth learning now or better to trade it off.
---
Have you ever heard the tragedy of Darth Nerfeis?
---
Still too easy. On my second try solo, had an 8:40. First try with my team and we had it done in 7:17.
---
I'm a melee build and I found if I had teammates that were shooting at it I could be behind it and get a bunch of damage without taking any, but as soon as it turned around I was instakilled
---
Oh yeah, Watoga Underground would be a good pick!
---
Then stand with your back against the wall..
---
I played with friends at first, but I've been solo for months and 100s of hours of gameplay now. The new public teams make it easy to play with others if none of you're friends are playing.
---
That is one though
---
Huh weird. Must be some glitch along the same lines as when you go to trade with someone and its automatically on the menu for interested items only and you have to press triangle to see all the items.
---
Kill the final robots first? What do you mean?
---
That’d be funny but somehow I don’t think Initiate Dodge would be down with that
---
Buying was x1
---
Yea it's part of the OP. They have a mutation buff called Resilient. It makes it so they can only be killed by a melee attack. Its annoying if you're attempting to solo it but with a good team it's not bad.
---
x gear repair = sad trombone
---
Nice i just finished that mission
---
I think maybe they saw the writing on the wall and decided to put honest effort into 76 and delay Starfield and ES6 to be worked on and refined further
---
All the excitement, great thought. Will be specially looking for this to pop up tonight.
---
That’s awesome. It feels really good now!
---
awesome, now time to just hope i get a fixer finally lmfao
---
Lone wanderer is honestly terrible.  Group meta is much better
---
Morgantown Airport’s an interesting idea. Vault 76 would be funny but I doubt it since it sounds like it’s impossible to open from the outside lmao
---
God that would be a godsend restocking my vendor is an awful experience
---
Has he restarted the ps4? Mine sometimes has issues when I only put it to sleep for too many days. Otherwise I have no idea, I know mine wouldn't do anything today until I reset it
---
At the final stage where you have to fight the boss, you need to kill a group of robots in the area before the boss shows up. At the bottom there's always like 2 or 3 robots hanging around, look for them and kill them or you will waste time at the end.
---
It was actually easy to solo; used a minigun, then bashed once I saw their health plummet to near zero. Wore excavator armor with the medic pump mod and had rank 3 First Aid, so I basically had constant healing the whole time. Endurance is only 2.
---
Is the budget  cost lower?
---
So I'm stuck with 2 lvl 25 helmets sucks
---
Got on and a buddy told me he couldn't kill the robots.  I read the instructions and said dude, you can only kill them through melee.  We hopped to the event and completed it successfully.   Ricochet is a useful perk card down there.
---
ALSO!! All THREE of the retrenched managers were THREE star....  yeaah of course all dropped one star loot but still the emotional roller coaster!
---
Well I'm going to try out all the new features before I make a decision on this update. I really like the legendary perks. Take a look at them they may add a more interesting play style for you
---
I know the daily ops types changes, but for a first op that was a dick in the dick haha, even the people I played with in the ops that used keyboard and mouse hated it :P
---
I joined my teammate and it ended right as i joined so i got the daily for it lol
---
Yep
---
You’ve no idea how this one simple change has made my entire week.
---
The spore carriers were specific to vault 22 in NV because of the vault-tec experiment for that vault.
---
It's broken the game made it unplayable for most.
---
LOL - sorry!
---
For sure. Like Leader of the Pack, but hopefully working properly.
---
I only have three but legendary perception, follow through and ammo factory
---
From what Ive heard from people who played on PTS the Resilient mutation is by far the most annoying
---
I made it with a level 30 friend, I used a ve gat plas to heal myself and my friend attacked any robots that came into the zone for the uplink. I used diffusers when the game wasn't lagging out, and we made it. It's totally doable, but we had to do a couple other runs to practice.
---
High level?? Man this uodate is trash for us low levels as well. Im lvl 30ish and was having a blast with 76, finally getting into the swing of it and really enjoying the progression.
---
And then this update dropped. And im completely fucked. No ammo left, no lead to make more ammo. My stack of 100 stimpacks is all but used up. Im out of scrap after having to repair my PA and weapons constantly. 
---
All this, and ive just been questing in the forest and grafton. You know, the starter regions? 
---
Im completely demoralized, and honestly stuck as i cant scavenge more lead cause i keep dying the second i leave my base from level 30 mongrels
---
Yesssssss get the deathclaw I wanna ride it too
---
None but I had a good time slashing and burning through junk cards.  I'm going to wait a bit to see just how great / messed up / unplayable my characters are and look at what all the smarter-than-me Redditors come up with before spending my coins.
---
Oh god I was just randomly exploring and waaaay over encumbered when I found that pack it was a sad 30 seconds
---
looks like a good update for all the vets out there! we finally have stuff to do after level 50 :)
---
I could be wrong. Iam not completely speced into the weapon.
---
With the nerfs, every little bit of extra damage helps.
---
Not sure if it’s guaranteed, but westek usually has a few roaming around. I just went there for the challenge and found 3 lol. Hope this helps
---
Seriously..like you did not understand
---
Yep, extremely frustrating, they make us use melee to kill these things and majority of hits don't even register.
---
So let me get this straight: In your opinion, players should be held responsible for the way the game was coded, and it's unacceptable to express frustration with such because the player should be able to, what? Read the coding? Figure it out? H'okay.
---
I think its going to be used more for the fallout shelters coming in winter. I bet the floor connects to the rest of the vault tiles to give power throughout the whole interior like it did in fo4. No wires is the real value.
---
You don't have common sense cuz you worship angry turtle
---
You  either have a magical shotgun or piece of armour to one hit in vats. Without that you'd be burning through ammo.
---
I have 4 on an alt that doesn't use power armor.
---
Off the top of my head, could be 200% wrong, wasn't serendipity and dodgy supposed to work only outside of PA? Maybe they "fixed" it?
---
Great. I’m not hardcore either although I play a lot. I have no clue nor interest in putting that much thought into a perk build just In order to play the game. I’ll play it for myself to see. But I already cancelled my fallout 1st
---
They aren’t fucking around when they say: “WHO’S READY TO GET THEIR ASS KICKED?”
---
It’s a VE Minigun and I empty thousands of rounds to keep myself ALIVE
---
well, for starters, I have an alt that's level 250 and it only had enough coins for one level 2 and three level 3 legendary perks.
---
can't recommend weight reduction perks unless they're maxed. I also don't see why you'd need sturdy frame. bandolier and traveling pharmacy are usually the go-to ones.
---
there's no need for adamantium skeleton. you never get crippled. and when you do, just pop a stim. food and water are plentiful, no need for dromedary or slow metabolizer. if you're not bloodied I don't see the use for radicool. lifegiver would be infinitely more useful than any of those. personally I also don't like rejuvenated.
---
tenderizer is a one hit wonder. same with suppressor. I think squad maneuvers is useless because speed demon caps your speed. don't really play in teams so I can't comment on cha perks.
---
nerd rage, again, don't see the use in a full health build. unless you're going bloodied with a junkie's weapon for whatever reason. batteries included and power user are great if you're using PA.
---
you should max sneak. I also recommend dodgy. evasive is fine, but not really needed. if you're sneaking then you should be using covert operative as well.
---
grim reaper's sprint is a good perk but a commando should barely be using AP anyway. still don't get serendipity if you're not a low health build, use ricochet instead. may want to consider tormentor, so you can cripple stuff. or critical savvy and better crits for a crit build.
---
I feel like part of the problem is that the roboshits have 100% aim and you can’t do a damn thing without being staggered. Multiple times I was surrounded by robots on their last breath but couldn’t get a punch off to finish the deal. Infuriating to do solo. I’m... back stepping out the ops room.
---
I'm saying that now you have access to knowledge that you didn't before, and you can do anything you want with it
---
Yeah but it's much harder killing poor dogs than you know, other people
---
I have had the same experiences, and I also agree with you whole-heartedly.
---
first Op was like getting woken up by being punched in the dick
---
Haha as someone who fancies CAMP building, I took one look at it and thought the same thing.
---
Yea I’ve never seen experienced this before and I’m not over encumbered
---
God please fix vats. My B2525 fixer has already been fucked in the ass with the damage nerds it doesnt need to miss things 2 centimetres in front of me.
---
You need to wait until they update your mods. Without mods, when you hit esc it will open the report. If you just fast travel out of there you will receive your rewards, just miss on the report.
---
I've just tried it solo. I mostly fight unarmed and I don't have optimized build, lvl 158. I got a bit lost sometimes but could still finish it at Paladin tier. I used about 15 stimpaks. My advice is that you don't have to kill everything, just concentrate on the objective, try to stay behind some cover.
---
Don't make the ammo till you need it.
---
I made the mistake of equipping the dodgy perk so everytime I tried to finish off the boss I wouldn’t have enough AP left to bash it and it would melt me hahaha, that’s a good strat there though
---
I'm with you on this, I walked through New Gad like usual and burned through all 200 rounds of shotgun ammo I had. I'm not enjoying this new update at all at this point.
---
They have two voice actors for Grahm.  The old one was Ray Chase.  The new one sounds different.  Not sure why they are not using Ray Chase anymore.  The second guy is named Chip Joslin.
---
Edit: Three voice actors.  Wastelanders added a third guy named Dave Fennoy
---
Reference: [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Grahm](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Grahm)
---
Same. Bought the Tricennial on sale awhile ago, and I winded up liking multiplayer so much, I bought a headset I’m waiting on.
---
The change to merging items seems to be centered around prefabs; you can't place an item anywhere on a prefab that has been destroyed, and if you place an item before destroying a prefab it disappears until the prefab is repaired (this is also how it worked before the update, however). It was useful to make a super compact, portable base using stuff like the seedy shed, and if anyone wanted to intentionally use a destroyed prefab for a run-down aesthetic they're SOL, but thankfully the more popular merges like flat &amp; angled roof pieces or double walls are still possible.
---
No you have it wrong. It's not gonna be just one update each season(summer fall and winter) its multiple updates each season. So for summer we had like 3 or 4 updates that added in all the new stuff we have so far. Now that fall is kinda here the first update(update 22) added one wasteland, season 2, legendary perks , and daily ops. But they are still gonna add steel dawn and some new event I cant remember the name of in the next few updates along with the usual bug fixes and gameplay tweaks.
---
It's nice that Bethesda decided to alienate all the stealth players 100% of the time, while giving all the other builds plenty of cover.  That's very fair of them. /s  
---
It's a big FU to stealth players tbh
---
Just join a daily ops group.
---
Mine worked but it didn’t look like it worked. Once I disconnected and came back online it was changed to shielded.
---
What I want to know is, does **Pain Train** kill them?
---
I get a line of four ballistic gutsies just daring me to get close enough to bash one; of course they just cut me down as I approach. The transition from vats to melee, spamming the melee button hoping the bash animation plays at the right time... it's just not fun. I want to run into the pack of those 1-health F-ers and knock them all down.
---
The last group I ran it with we decided, for this one at least, two running guns and two running melee was a good combo
---
Read the mutations for the op before starting each day. All ops currently available basically disable stealth, and today’s other modifier requires you to bash or melee an enemy to finish them off
---
That at least fits with the lore. In one of the computers it mentioned that the living quarters were meant to be communal.
---
Overall I enjoyed what little of the lore I did find and even looking around you can tell that certain parts have a story to tell. Sadly parts of it feel unfinished due to only having been used for the raid part of it.
---
I didn’t have a bloodied but I’m a stealth melee build and could own hit enemies. Hope it doesn’t nerf me
---

---
Almost Every server I’ve joined doesn’t have one ,and if I does have one, they aren’t doing daily ops
---
Deary me.....
---
So now you can get get killed,and  and still get the Big Boss loot rewards.
---
No more looking for Earl in the Dark.
---
We should have a Fallout for Snow Flakes.
---
Hate the way this game is going.
---
Why couldn't players just accept that being sucker-killed is part of the game.Lost cout of the times i have been killed on completion.I just learned from it and moved on.
---
Resilient u have to kill them with melee attach
---
That isn't too far a drop... but still worries me.  My build is sneaky black powder pistol for most enemies, with either a gatling gun or a vampire shotgun for sustained damage to anything i can't kill with one shot.
---
Truthfully, as long as my vampire double barrel still vampires... i should be allright lol.  Nothing like each hit being as good as a stim.
---
Your not reading.
---
I mean, that’s a dick move. If someone is *really* bothering you that much, leave it the fuck alone and report them. It’s between them and Bethesda, none of your business.
---
The other trait that they have make it to where they can only die to melee damage. You can shoot them down to 1 hp and then bash them with your gun rather than using a melee weapon if you’d like.
---
Before, my instigating shotgun could oneshot most trash mobs. Now I'm lucky if I can knock half their health off with that first shot, and then let's talk about that health rubberbanding issue that *still exists* \- suddenly I can barely kill a single thing with 8 rounds.
---
Like, yeah, I knew changes were coming, I've been following the news that much, but uh... I think they went a tad overboard with the finer details. I don't want to *fight* a damn radroach in Camden Park, in my fully modded X-01, I want to *squish* it, tyvm.
---
I am running bloodied as well. Is that okay for the full unyielding armor? I really wanna try junkie just having a hard time committing and leaving bloody behind.
---
Yeah, I'm in the middle of moving perk cards around and re-allocating S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats around so I can be like everyone else and rock a power armor Junkies/Bloodied build. Sigh.
---
There goes what little build diversity we had before.
---
As a Junkies I feel radicool, Dromedary, slow metabolizer and rejuvenated are poor choices as you can fill all they do with party boy/girl plus alcohol and drugs. R3 adamantium is pretty mandatory with the enemy buffs unless you want to be hobbling around.
---
Are you finishing them off with melee or gun bash?  That's the only way they die. And i read that stealth doesn't work bc the robots are also mutated to see you, Piercing Gaze i think its called?
---
Yeah you can control somewhat where they spawn in. I was under the impression the CAMP module controlled it (due north of that?).
---
Ive set mine so people port in safely in a clearing.
---
Haha just the way it should be. No mercy anywhere. It's a game. If you run outta ammo, ya gonna have to hustle for more.
---
Just pretend your playing XCOM. lol
---
I'm actually a heavy gunner myself with NO power armor so I'm even squishier than those in their thicc metal cocoons and I absolutely loved the daily ops!  It finally puts a little challenge back into the game.  
---
If anything I feel like heavy gunners are perfect for this daily op, shoot the enemy and then run up and bash em to finish em off!  If you're in PA then it's even easier because you can shrug off more bullets.
---
I agree , one handed weapons are the pistols of the melee weapons and need some much needed love, I've been sitting on a bloodied power attack shishkabab. I love the weapon I used it in previous games but it just couldn't get strong enough before the patch , I can only imagine what its like now. 
---
All its useful for is healing npcs in certain events.
---
I'm loving it too. I run a bloodied pump action and the Unstoppable Monster gauntlet and I'm still basically one shorting everything with a few exceptions.
---
Will we see a number of FO1st cancellations?  I subscribe and I wonder if I will actually take advantage of the stash box going forward.  Like, I am going to be crafting a bunch more ammo, repairing guns and repairing armor much more often now.  Will I actually be contributing to my stash box going forward?
---
Personally, this made me feel like I reversed so far in terms of progress.   That ops mission thing definitely did not do Bethesda any favors today either.   I used more stimpaks today (in and out of ops) then I have in probably a month or two...
---
Edit: I would be willing to keep FO1st if I could have my Private Server set to be frozen in Patch 21.  I really do enjoy just being able to explore the wasteland...
---
I want the perk cards packs for coins, that's it
---
I'm running a Junkies Fixer riflrman sneak VATS build. I used to do 2000-3000 dmg per sneak headshot in vats, now it's been reduced to 400. The Sneak damage is not multiplying Vats, and Sneak appear to be broken again and not working at all. RIP VATS/STEALTH/RIFLEMAN builds
---
You missed the memo. Each daily op has a resilient modifer. This one is melee attack to kill. Favorite your melee and quickly switch once you get them down to zero with your favorite range.  Enemies are on a constant spawn so complete the objective instead of kill em all.
---
Luckily not all will have this buff. I suggest the legendary explosion perk . It helps.
---
Yup, seems to be a great release. I can be very critical of Bethesda, but I will also gladly cheer them on when they do good. And so far I am cheering.
---
Is true.
---
Melee isn't working right.  The damage is far below what it should be and I believe Ninja is not working at all.
---
It always comes down to thrust.
---
Thanks!
---
I guess. I just don't understand why you'd use a junkie's weapon in a bloodied build.
---
nothing wrong with it. but you're missing out on 30% damage.
---
It was a nice easy way to eyeball your progress. How are we supposed to know when our time's almost up or if we're ahead on score?
---
I can attest to the fact merging has not been taken out as far as roofs walls and furnishings with one of my camps [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/zgg7OJu)
---
Okay, good to know. Thanks!
---
If they're going to give me around 160 xp per kill instead of the 3 xp they were giving me before, then I'll gladly spare a few extra bullets.
---
I feel you i was just waiting to play till the new season started i leveled to 32 didnt have any issues fighting enemies if a quest required me to fight a death claw my friend would kill it for me. This update however after playing for a day with a almost full squad all i heard from my friends one at level 20 one at level 300 and me at 32 is complaining. I literally went from having 80 stimpacks today to only 5 stimpacks after doing a quest for rose the robot a quest i had no issues completing on my second character with a similar build before the update.
---
I probably won't touch the game until an update releases to fix this im already wishing this scaled level update wasnt released cause now everything is a chore instead of a goal to reach level 40 and up i literally have no reason to reach a higher level cause no matter if im 40 or 300 im going to have a bad time.
---
Try starting new with a rifle build and tell me its fine
---
I can’t tell a difference on my lvl 260 junkies commando.  My fixer and handmade might take an extra round or two but it doesn’t feel different.  My explosive railway and laser rifles are still just silly strong.
---
Using:
---
J/25/25 fixer and handmade
---
J/e/fr railway
---
J/e laser rifle
---
I feel the same. I’ll probably stop playing after this nonsense.
---
Yep. I've seen a few videos of it, had it happen to me once or twice. It's just super janky and random, like much of this game
---
I'm being it was the assholes that did this that ruined it for everyone else.  If people stuck to just building these in private bethesda might not have changed it
---
Glad it’s not just me.   Logged in with the wife. Go to try ops.  Get steamrolled by a billion bots that you have to fucking melee to death?   Gave up after hemorrhaging 800 bullets and at least 100 stims.  Even a west tek run is tedious.   We both play stealth commando but that seems nearly useless now. Very frustrated.  I am ok with a challenge but ffs
---
Post an imgur link
---
Fix the game? You're asking for an extraneous features that's very niche. It's a little much to call your suggestion a fix.
---
Sigh* yes it's working right. The way damage was being calculated was changed, it's now additive, and it used to be multiplicative.
---
Open all the packs, then for the level ups buy adamantium skeleton and rank it to 3 then scrap for coins over and over if you dont need them for anything else. finish by scrapping all the cards you dont need and you should have a tidy sum of coins to spend
---
Yeah first run through Daily Ops I was like damn this is brutal.  Second run, Paladin rank easy, just barely short of Elder.  Key things to take away in my opinion are...
---
\&gt; Have a full group, it seems to spawn the same amount of enemies if there's two or four people so no reason to not have a full group
---
\&gt; Don't waste time fighting enemies on the way to objectives, it just wastes time against endless waves of spawn-camping enemies.  Just bum rush to the objective and hold, then move to the next one.
---
\&gt; Get on the objective, if your in a group you should be on the objective.  Look at the progress tracker, you want it to say (x4) as often as possible.  It makes a considerable difference.
---
I think once people figure this out these will be a cake walk.  I was flailing my arms like a mad mad spamming the follow me emote and luckily they followed along fairly well.  Had they known what to do we probably could have easily shaved the 1.5 minutes we needed to hit Elder rank.
---
Would the bloody build be better with a bloody weapon? Ditch the junkie?
---
With the odds for a really good drop in this game every bit counts, and we need good weapons now more than ever. I don't think its being a snowflake to want to get the rewards you spent thousands of rounds to earn. Dont really understand what you mean by looking for earle in the dark? You never had to  search for earle. You suggesting you had to search for earle makes me think youre one of those people who tags him then goes afk waiting for everyone else to do the work.
---
That was pretty easy to get in one day
---
Yeah for normal mobs it takes an extra bullet or two as well. One shotting everything was getting old so I like this update, was just wondering if it was worth it to try and switch to a full health build. Thanks for the info
---
..or just remove them while waiting :D (tired)
---
I mostly fight unarmed, so I am really happy to have got the bench press on day 1. And I suspect the other new camp items will boost other SPECIAL stats. I'm looking forward to get them.
---
Yeah 9 perks investment or more to only hit barely half of unarmeds damage at 3 perks isn't good balance.
---
Thnx for the reply...i was twisted on it!
---
Captain Zorbo meet Captain Obvious. Players cannot take the blame for not using a broken feature of a broken game. It's that simple. Don't blame the victim. Learn better people skills too.
---
Yeah I bashed a robot about a dozen times while he had next to 0 HP and he ended up killing me.
---
Using instigating death tambo too
---
Ridiculous
---
I grabbed the masks and BoS Scavetron, the latter of which I’m super happy about as a new player. Came to this sub and saw people asking Bethesda to extend it, and was wondering how long I’d have to wait. It’s just too bad you can’t have multiple roaming around, or at least displays.
---
save that bubblegum for score challenges 🍺
---
Please Beth, no resilient Flamer Floaters, for the love of Atom
---
Why wouldn't you? Risk losing it all by logging out? You can't get in trouble for an error on their end.
---
 I remember Apex Legends bugging after an update and giving a lot of people premium currency for free and if you spent it they didn't do anything. Can't see Bethesda caring about free card packs that you'd get anyway after time.
---
Merry Christmas.
---
Not sure how that user actually did it, but it's worth noting that a minigun with a shredder barrel on it does both melee and balistic damage at point-blank range.
---
of course. bloodied is a 80% bonus at 19% hp. junkie's is 50% with 5 addictions.
---
nothing wrong with junkie's or full health builds, or even junkie's in a bloodied build like I said. but if you're making a bloodied build, then you might as well use bloodied weapons.
---
Had no idea, I just got the link of a data mining discord server and thought I’d share it so more people see it *shrug* I never said it was mine, just trying to help out but I edited the link in the post to his post
---
Taking One For Team, pretty universally useful card and I was persuaded by watching Angry Turtle’s testing video including it.
---
Is there any reason to care about the animated ones other than as collectables? If it's just cosmetic, I'm going to scrap them.
---
He did say the flamethrower trick was removed yet it wasnt was my point. It was a very general statement that was pretty much false.
---
From my weapon stats:
---
Instigating Gauss Shotgun: 588 damage (was 675)
---
Anti-Armor Fixer w/ Exploding Bullets: 122 damage (was 128)
---
Using Legendary perks, I upped my sneak bonus to 2.15% and added 15% rifle damage for my Fixer. And I fully maxed Follow Through for an additional 40% to ranged sneak attacks.
---
I’m kinda wondering the same. I adore these combat changes... every firefight feels so much more engaging as we take less damage too. But I restarted on PC awhile back and am only lvl 50, with the beginnings of a sneak/rifle build and I’m curious where these changes will take this build.
---
When I unequip it, the damage remains exactly the same.  How is additive versus multiplicative resolving that?
---
I agree ACP seemed largely unaffected at least by heavies. Only lost 10 dmg per shot, and he didn't really seem harder to kill.
---
Wrong sadly — they cost 1 perk point to swap out / unequip.
---
Doc is talking about legendary perks, in which case yes you do need to spend one coin to unequip.
---
All solid points!  I'd like to add that using cover at the objective points helps a lot.  The burrows has junk stacked around the objective that you can hide behind to save yourself from a few bullets, and it can really help your survivability or allow you to focus on enemies from one direction at a time.
---
I’m in the exact same boat as you. Spent about an hour prior to playing the op going through all my weapons because for some reason my B2525 HM and fixer are now the worst weapons I own. I have a suppressors (I think) tire iron that does 30 less damage than that HM and my B+10 dam while aiming railway does 3 times as much as both the HM and Fixer. Anyways took out the highest damage weapons i had which is like 300dam now and went and got absolutely pounded in the Burrows. Swarmed by protections and robo brains that one shot me while the eye bots do suicide runs and about 5 AA gutsys light me up from way downtown. Died at least 20 times. Got really frustrated. Have no want to play the game atm.
---
I am level 136, my first event post update was Campfire Tales. That event used to be a walk in the park. It most surely was not, especially since I started the event solo. Thankfully someone else showed up. It really didn't help that all the enemies spawn under your feet when gathering kindling.
---
I often find myself wondering how they let some of these simpler bugs persist for two years.
---
Why were you trying to fight eight scorched of equivalent level by yourself?  Are you not able to run away?  You know you are not intended to win every encounter and you have to use some tactics beyond slugging it out toe to toe in those situations.
---
I’ve heard that focusing on VATS criticals is really helpful to dish out damage too. So invest in those luck points maybe.
---
I think, as of right now, you’re at a major disadvantage if you’re not maximizing damage and specializing in a weapon type.  Even then, automatic weapons are by far the best.
---
PTS players brought up these issues immediately, and nothing was done about it.  There could be a variety of reasons as to why, but I just can’t understand why anyone would completely overhaul damage calculations for a blanket loss in performance while simultaneously increasing enemy strength across the board, and not expect shit to roll downhill.
---
It works intermittently for me.  I wasn't able to figure out any rhyme or reason for it- I'd sneak up on a SM or similar \[HIDDEN\] power attack them and get... normal damage.
---
Then once in awhile I'd do that, even on \[CAUTION\] and get my x3 damage.
---
Not sure if it's truly broken or there's a mechanic that's not been made clear.  Seems like the Blade of Bastet has taken a nerf also.  I'm 5 or 7 hitting things I was one hitting yesterday.   Except once in a blue moon when I'll get in a two hit kill.
---
For me, two hits is still doable- anything over that and a stealth melee player is likely to get mobbed.  Bright side- a new set of Ultracite power armor appeared on my new frame when I put my chassis on it, so at least the bugs are sort of two sided.  Or do you think Bethesda is hinting I need to change my combat approach?  :D
---
Whether a bug or bugs, or just the new mechanics, it doesn't look to me like stealth melee is going to be viable until it changes.
---
Your a idiot. You choose where people spawn. It’s not that hard to move it to a point where it doesn’t screw with people. I would do the same as buddy, but also shit on your bed ;)
---
Im just wondering if it works for the player who uses it , i noticed 0 difference in damage , (its at 30% atm)
---
Hexagons have less area than circle. Its basic geometry bruh
---
I’m at level 83, and I played for about two hours today. I am completely out of ammo, and supplies. You can no longer play this game casually and it sucks.
---
Good luck to you then my dude, enjoy! Unfortunately I work a lot now so I don’t have as much time to grind through it all so I just save up Atoms to use for this kinda thing haha
---
I’m running junkie explosive with a handmade. Without changing anything my damage dropped from 182 to 141. I’m a full health build vats semi sneak build. Hope this helps.
---
Is this satire?
---
You might have to try your luck with tomorrow's op instead.  I think the "melee kill only" perk on the mobs today has everyone avoiding the ops
---
Feeling the love 😂
---
What no more getting gang bashed by charred ferals while having a shop, then getting stuck in the vendors menu. What will I do with my Sundays now.
---
That or wasteland 3, missed 5 75% chance shots in a row.
---
Delete the camp item?
---
ran it several times, no deaths on any of the teams.  
---
only people having a hard time were bloodied builds.
---
Then big
---
Well I maxed out that legendary ammo perk so that's not really ever going to be an issue. In fact I have u.45 2caps:1 alllllll day long.
---
It hasn’t happened to me since my camp isn’t next to the boundary, however just fast travel to 76 and back and she should respawn in your camp. She always like to glitch in my foundation and that is what I do to fix her.
---
No, screw that. Report it and change gamma rounds, screw off
---
That’s understandable. I think they went a bit overboard with the damage calculations but they did say they’re willing to look them over and rework them
---
Yeah it’s not fun anymore. I’m spending more time at my camp crafting ammo &amp; collecting resources than I am playing the game. If I wanted to do chores I would just turn off the game and clean my house.
---
Yeah, I am also a stealth build. The Daily Ops was so difficult. None of my sneak skills did anything. They would spawn on me if I was hiding in a pipe, even with no one around me. Hidden to Danger in 2 seconds.
---
But..lvling up a close to 200 rank toon is way harder than 140
---
Here, let me spell out a few options for you:
---
* Carry a few mines and place then in bottlenecks like passages, or around corners, or near other environmental hazards like gas tanks or pools of oil if they're around. When things get heated or you see a larger cluster you want to make smaller, run past your mine and when they trigger the trap, clean up. The bipedal bots are particularly susceptible to leg damage slowing or immobilising them
---
* Start a fight near a corner and pull back a bit and wait. They don't run 6 at once around that corner. You just turn a 6 v 1 fight into a 1-2 v 1
---
* If you're in an open area, move to one with more obstacles that's harder to navigate so it's harder for them to all swam you at once and get line of sight on you to shoot/hit you
---
* If you do ever get swarmed, run away to a place with cover or one of those corners, bottlenecks or traps you've set. 
---
* Look at your build and plug up the weaknesses. Maybe you have an inefficient build for what you're trying to do.
---
I also get that time is a factor since this is a daily op. However, since you're having trouble with even the basics, this is where we need to start.
---
This. Launched two nukes today and went through a total of 9-10 repair kits, granted my weapon does have the explosive effect so that was bringing it down twice as fast.
---
I’m not sure this update will make the game fun for me anymore
---
It always was a good option, especially for . 308 ammo
---
Agreed.  At one point, I was getting about 1K with my power fist sneaking.  Then it started doing 450 and just stayed at that.  It is definitely broken, I just can't pinpoint exactly how.
---
Edit: I used to get 6K (Vampire's)
---
Yah I havent paid attention in a while, lvl 252 gotta hit 300 now 😒
---
So if I understand correctly, let’s say you put one legendary perk into the Strength spot. You can then move 5 normal points out of Strength and put them into a different SPECIAL? Really sorry if that’s totally wrong and I just made it more confusing.
---
*Is* it actually a race this time, at all? Was it a race in the Run? Or just a deadline in both cases? Last I remember, it's 10 weeks for this one, so everyone can just do the math. Plus we'll get an ingame news link a week before the deadline, if the Run is anything to go by.
---
Same I turned off 1st renewal. I’m sad. It’s no fun anymore
---
I watch his videos too, but you sound like you would gladly suck his pp, mr. fanboy 😹
---
I can't be bothered with the melee version. When ever it resets I will try it then. This just screams "We can't make melee viable so we will force them to use it anyways"
---
I don’t see why. Don’t all guns have a bash to them?
---
If it’s nothing to do with you, why interfere? Report it, because it’s an exploit. All fair and well. But changing it is a dick move regardless of your intentions.
---
I’d like to go in there and check it out.  I was in there all the time at one point and never once had a chance to actually look around.  I was always fighting a clock, mowing down fresh waves of enemies, frantically looking for keys, cards and electronic components, usually all at once.
---
Needs more boom
---
Did u think this was a quality post when it crawled out of the dark corner of ur mind
---
As the kids would say, gettuth good. But in all seriousness its annoying but still fun.
---
Meh if I walk I won't give away stuff or make a qq post. I did have a lot less fun today but not making any decisions off one evening of play.  I don't have a meta build or anything, just a level 140ish noob and everything felt blah.  Just harder to kill mobs for no extra reward and yet another system stacked on a system which I'm very wary of. No more chilling in the kiddie pool side of the map, no more bouncing around having a blast on the easy events.  They might rebalance again or I might get used to it and get my zest for the game back but if not oh well.  The high level metas will keep grinding and new newbies will never know different and nobody will miss me so all good.
---
I literally just said he made a video about it.
---
So...suggestions??
---
It's not even just low levels. I'm level 140 and even I'm having a difficult time. I think this is going to be *really* bad for the game in the long run unless they tone down the scaling by a LOT. I shouldn't have to use 50 Gauss Minigun rounds on an enemy in the *forest*.
---
I'm level 130, have played a couple hours of this patch and most encounters feel waaaay easier now, the only fight that made me go "this is some serious bullshit" was when I ran a nuclear silo and these assaultrons were just spamming their laser beam.
---
Did it make it that hard for low levels?? If that it's so, il start helping them right away!
---
To bad plasma damage sucks now, or it was just the visual bug in pts? What's your current damage numbers, just curious
---
I feel this. My work day starts as the daily reset happens so I usually have to wait til wait at night to play.
---
Yay can't wait to get screwed over by rng. I need a bit more free time in my life and then the first thing I'm doing is getting wasteland 3. If I try a first run on supreme jerk, how much pain am I in for?
---
The horde events are great fun now too.
---
It affects the servers and affects everyone. You wanna keep it on your person and not make it hack proof then its on you.
---
Same. I know “falLOuT gOt awAy frOm RPG”. But I want to play the game how I want. Not have to rebuild my character I’ve spent hours perfecting just to not enjoy playing.
---
&gt; so everyone can just do the math.
---
Yeah, cool. I'll just do the math every time I open the scoreboard. That's just as good. ;)
---
I personally wouldn't recommend starting with 76. It's a good game but certainly the weakest in a lot of areas.
---
Well levelling up to 300 unlocks all 6 legendary perk slots, my bad. The coins are used to upgrade the legendary cards themselves.
---
Just done this event on my own,it was seriously,seriously, hard.
---
As if my Bloodied build damage halfed today was not bad enough.
---
Now i am having issues i have never experienced before this update.
---
Every second shot i am getting off is regenerating the health of everything i shoot.
---
YCMIU.
---
I was running around the Sewers shooting Gutsies,that were destroying my Unyielding armour, with a 50 Ca Pea Shooter with base damage that is halfedl and  was regenerating the Health of most of them i was shooting .
---
Same thing happened at Path to Enlightenment.
---
I ended up just going for it in the end just using a Pole Hook and deathclaw.
---
What have you done to my game Bethesda ?
---
I could take out a Sentrybot a Whitespring with 2 Shots,now it takes 20 wtf bwhaaaaaa.
---
I enjoyed shooting the Cars with 1 shot,now its 2,or 3.
---
To be fair OP it took me  a couple of minutes to figure it out.Not sure what Relevance there is in you highlighting higher levels.Most of us just click on events and go for it..
---
Whitesprings nuke = possible rad fluids and other shit from ghouls and like 200-300 fluorescent raw flux
---
I've noticed that, too.
---
Well, I have noticed more crashes in the area when I’ve contested a workshop that has 3 dozen ammo factories... Yes, so I can make 5.56. And gamma rounds too believe it or not. No, if you really want to piss someone off do it properly and change it to an even more useless ammo type, .38 lol
---
Ooooh so that's why they nerfed melee
---
Legendary agility, Legendary luck so far, maxed out luck and moved 5 points into intelligence, will max out agility and move 5 points into either str or endurance to grab some perks there. Haven't added any other ones yet.
---
Maxed ammo factory on my charisma mule though so i don't have to spend points there.
---
Serendipity does NOT work in PA if it not has been changed
---
Finally someone who isn't complaining ablut bloodied being nerfed. Follow this person's lead.
---
I’ve never played bloodied so I can’t really compare them, I went junkies originally because it felt like the best of both worlds really high damage and full health.  My second character is a lvl 170 junkies heavy guns power armor guy; the only difference I noticed is that my j/e/250 50 cal feels slightly weaker, but my flamer and gat plasma function with no noticeable difference.  Hope that helps!  Best of luck in the wastes :)
---
I've ran this multiple times today as an unyielding/bloody build without any problems. My last 3 runs were with 3 others who were levels 40-70 with myself being 125. We beat the 8 min mark with time to spare. No one is being punished. It's just an event with changing enemy buffs and maybe just a little strategy.
---
Same here, I noticed my damage numbers are significantly less but I can still take down scorchbeasts in about the same amount of time.  This new damage calculation is screwy.  Some of the new higher level Super Mutants are hard as hell to kill, yet SB's fall out of the sky in relatively few shots.
---
My melee damage output is a whole different story.  Feels like I am level 20 again.
---
Yeah there wasn’t a window for me. It was only after I finished that the option to see it appeared. This was my second attempt, the first time it wouldn’t join the op at all. No big deal. after about 500 rounds I googled. But I definitely yelled WTF more than a few times
---
Stealth is only guaranteed gone for uplink (which is the only mode for now, they said more will come later). Uplink has piercing gaze on by default and another random modifier. And yes, even with a full chameleon set and stealth build, you will pretty much instantly get thrown in danger. The perk where you can lose enemies by crouching does nothing. Haven't tried stealth boys but I doubt that will change anything
---
Not sure about follow through, but I believe I have seen others use it even for melee builds (shoot with a silenced shotgun then switch to melee) so pretty sure it works
---
I’m gonna assume your didn’t bother reading the patch notes, or the information given to you on the menu before you start daily ops. 
---
Each day it will be different enemies. With different instructions. 
---
Today was “enemies can only be killed with a melee attack” which means you CAN damage them with anything. However, if you want to kill them, you need to do it with a melee attack. In this situation you can use your gun bashing attack to kill the robots since that’s a melee attack. 
---
Also, when you do daily ops, all enemies will have a very high perception skill. Meaning there is no sneaking or sneak damage allowed. You could have sneak 3, Chinese stealth suit. And although you’re  perfectly still hiding in the shadows, the enemies will see you. 
---
So that’s the reason you did damage, and when you basically drained 99% of their health, you noticed your gun stopped doing damage in general. Because you needed to finish them off with a melee attack.
---
The gun bash mechanics are pretty iffy at best and never used in most game play. Add to that you can't bash in VATS. Not ideal but maybe quicker than switching to a melee wep? I've only done one op so haven't played around with it too much yet
---
Maybe I didnt understand, if you thought this was an error? Every 5 ranks past 50 u get a pack, every level you get a point to spend. For a level 137 you earned all of those, cashe them in. Also I think you earn packs from NW challenges.
---
Yes...? 
---
To re-summarize (and to see if I’ve got it right)... You slot a legendary perk card for strength. Then, you can go move that same number of plain perk points out of Strength and into wherever you want them. It frees up points so if you did have +5 for strength, you could do regular points +2 for Charisma and +3 Luck or whatever combo you wanted.
---
Someone double confirm?
---
They're only the same in Fallout 4 because of reused asset, it doesn't change the fact that lorewise this makes perfect sense. They don't have to change appearanc eto evolve. They get shot but not killed, they recover and form thicket skin, reproduce offspring with thicker skin, etc etc over god knows how many generations until we arrive at Fallout 4 and New Vegas where we're a good couple hundreds of years into their evolution.
---
Yea....at that point they're sprinting full charge, duck and weaving where humans and mutants aim, and have thick skin to not stagger and take more punishment while they lunge at you. They don't have to change appearance drastically ESPECIALLY since even tho this is evolution and you can make the argument "Evolution changes appearance if drastic changes like that happens, look at monkeys and humans!" Well this isn't normal evolution it's still a geneticallyengineered creature. It could have been engineered to become stronger over time or simply produce thicker skin with each generation, we don't know. 
---
Lorewise it makes perfect sense, and you don't even have to think that hard about it.
---
Full health shotgunner, and I haven't noticed a huge difference. I take a bit more damage but realistically it just means I have to keep a closer eye on my health bar.
---
Still one shotting supermutants so, not too different.
---
Isn’t that what the animatronic clown is going to be for?
---
Never had a problem. Normally break even ish after looting the wendigos, but I use a 50 cal
---
Maybe because low level legendaries are pointless. That's why I'd want all enemies to be at least level 50 anyways. There's probably a smarter way to handle that though.
---
But everyone *should* know what a god damned turtle is by now. What are we, three?
---
In the patch notes they changed them: more hexagonal.
---
No, melee and specifically unarmed weapons don’t seem to be applying the additive bonuses properly. In many cases they don’t seem to be applying at all, or applying at fractions of what it should be! We are unsure if its a pipboy damage bug or a real bug.
---
Meelee seems like its just harder to run now. You can still do it viably if your build is good, but you cant do half meelee builds anymore
---
I thought the areas had been locked to a max level for enemies. Did they change that? I always liked doing quest in the forest - such a relief.
---
Communist Bunker: The interior walls of the Communist Bunker are now hexagonal rather than cylindrical to help players more easily place wall décor.
---
I still melt enemies with my fixer. However I did notice I’m taking ALOT more damage in PA.  I’m ok with the update. Just need to move some perk cards around to compensate.
---
Worth the same, your source was mistaken
---
If you fast travel to a camp and get stuck in the foundation or a wall just open your map and fast travel to that camp again(for free &amp; usually loads instantly).
---
Load outs?
---
ok thank god i thought i did something wrong
---
You're projecting fanboyism when you lead with this nonsense:
---
&gt; Outer Worlds was just expected to be a better game than a Bethesda Fallout game, a return to glory of sorts for the original Fallout devs, which it was.
---
and
---
&gt; Not saying that means people have to like Outer Worlds, people can like whatever they want, but without a doubt Outer Worlds is far and away the higher quality game, regardless of which game you like more.
---
There are multiple goalposts here - we comparing just Fallout 76 or any Bethesda Fallout, e.g. 3 &amp; 4? - but there is no question that the Outer Worlds fell *hard* when it came to environments, exploration being rewarding, weapons, any kind of interesting progression system, and a plot with any redeeming value. These were the same people that did Fallout: New Vegas? Well, apparently they need the Fallout IP to keep themselves grounded.
---
F76 didn't even have NPCs for like over a year, so you got me there. But even though Parvati (and her quests) was fun, the whole rest of the game was a slog.
---
Just remember, if a melee enemy smacks you when your weapon is out, they can degrade your weapon's durability because they're smacking your weapon as well.
---
Nah one wasteland along with the damage nerf sucks and telling people they’re bad is a piss poor excuse. The game is unnecessarily tedious now. The immersion is gone. There’s nothing fun about having to shoot a stupid amount of bullets just to kill a basic mole rat, feral ghoul, super mutant, and so on. This game was turning into something close to the ideal online Fallout game and then they turned it into ESO.
---
Isn’t it awesome!?!? I honestly like that it’s challenging again. That’s just me
---
The really confusing part was that something was dying because I was getting xp, now being level headed I think it was the exploding eyebot but at the time I was like WTF somebody is dying, they can be killed pew pew pew pew peeeeew dammit
---
Or you can open your calendar now, count the ten weeks and set a reminder as close to the end date (nov24 iirc if it's not been changed) as you want.
---
Thank TODDDDD
---
Killing wasn’t an issue for me.  I died a lot while in PA.  Need to move some perk cards around to try and fix the issue.
---
Yea, i gave up doing that event almost a year ago because you can't tag shit on it caus eof morons using nothing but one shot weapons.
---
Love this
---
Ya thanks I saw another post that was discussing mods so glad to see that's the case. Hopefully that'll get sorted by either a mod update or a patch. I'm surely not removing the Perk Manager mod. It still saves time to have it over just waiting out the timer once a day.
---
They are.  Forest is locked to 50
---
Dont know, can they monitize it?
---
I feel like I am getting a lot of 'misses' when I swing, even though I hear it connect.  Other than that, melee seems OK except for the dmg redux, but in most cases it's just an extra swing or so.  Missing entirely is not ok however.(no vats) edit- or sneak
---
I’m pretty sure it’s just because they have extremely heightened perception today, so stealth pretty much doesn’t work at all. I assume there will be other Ops that are more stealth friendly
---
Speed demon I can understand, they messed up the coding since +50% might look like a positive even though it’s not. But bird bones? How did they mess that one up? And the fact that they haven’t been fixed yet for months and months is ridiculous
---
Except you're wrong. It's nothing like ESO.  "Stupid amount of bullets to kill a molerat" I literally just killed one in 2 shots, like I always have. Again, you always sucked, but just now you're realizing it.
---
Can confirm. Note that you will have to use your base level ups to move your special points around.
---
I had 15 base strength, so I put a legendary strength card and maxed it out so I technically had 20 strength. But you can only use 15 points for cards so those extra 5 strength were not much use to me. I then used my spare level ups to move 5 points from strength to charisma for max benefit.
---
what u/ripecantaloupe just said
---
Doesn't help either when each of those 10 is resilient too, and they're just backing away from you in 10 different directions....
---
I put my tse lever action rifle in the stash and gone full commando, I can't even one shot vehicles now with it. Its like my perk cards (adrenaline, demolition etc) don't seem to even help. Maybe they nerf'd the perk cards also because right now they seem like a waste of perk points.
---
The difficulty of this first op has a lot of people shying away from it.  I think a good portion of the player base has hardly ever touched melee and possibly never used the bash before this.  I know I never did  😂   
---
If the perk combo of the mobs is easier tomorrow I think more people will be wiling to try it and you'll find groups easier.
---
That is correct. The only caveat is as OP mentioned; the points you gain from the legendary charisma perk card doesn’t allow you to share higher cost cards like the same amount of SPECIAL points would. Could be an oversight or bug that gets fixed, could just be how it’s gonna function
---
Remember having to hop around Appalachia to each vendor bot to take advantage of the entire cap pool?
---
*Sigh…*
---
They used to be, but now in areas like the forest, especially events, enemies are leveled with you (the forest caps at 50). So when I wanted to lay back and chill with a back on the beat event or campfire tales, all enemies are 50. Not relaxing at all lol
---
Maybe they want us to use weaponsmith perk in intelect 🤔
---
Older movies use it as the sound of the UFO because it sounds so special
---
I'm a crit pistol build, and with tank killer now available for pistols my life is significantly easier. Also daily ops make dynamite shine imo, overall what was lack luster yesterday feels much better today, in my opinion of course
---
If you're having a bad time without VATS, you're just bad. Not the games fault.
---
You have to bash them/mele to finish them off. I found it easier to get the room full down to 0 than pull out the bat to finish the room. Than get ready for the next wave.
---
I've played some 300 hours without using glitches if I'm aware that they exist. It's completely doable.
---
Wonderful, guys. Thanks for clearing that up!
---
Maxed Follow Through with maxed Adrenaline and maxed Tank Killer works amazing with any 2525 Fixer, if you're using Covert Operative. Doesn't matter much if it's Bloodied. I was switching between my V2525 and B2525 and the difference was slim.
---
Ahh well hope to see you still play man! Check messages from me would be cool to play together and do an Op or something.
---
I run a vamp gatling. My damage decreased by a whole 19 per shot. I pretty much see zero change from pre one wasteland, with the exception of an incredibly easy ultracite ammo farm with the Daily Ops and being pretty much invincible to energy damage enemies with the fusion core refill legendary perk. 
---
Loving this patch so far. If I had one complaint, it's thst I wished this went live with the brotherhood quests or even with Wastelanders. Just to give more flavor of new things to do beyond grinding the daily ops.
---
Between this and large nuclear reactor, it seems we did end up getting some of Fallout 4’s Vault Tec DLC items after all. Hopefully we can get the rest of the stuff like the slot machine and the drink machine
---
Why thank you? It's still the worst legendary effect in the game. What enemies in the entire game are a big enough threat (level and AI wise) for you to use that? Blood Eagles and the wandering raiders are already easily dispatched and a fucking weak joke.
---
My fixer and vats are dead on.  I just wish I could have more rounds in the clip.
---
The worst decision ever. The old system with enemy levels and areas was ok, I liked that there is no this usual for dnd based games level scaling. Don't want to play now :/
---
After patch 21, I logged into nuclear winter and had 40 some odd packs to open...I didn’t finish opening them by the time the match started so I exited the match so I could join the next one open the rest before I lost em
---
Ur still young; at 14 you’re still going through puberty. I’d focus on finding what makes you happy. What direction do you want to go in life? What people support you and make you happy? What kinds of weapons will you use to cut, slash, burn, or otherwise mutilate those that wish to stand in your way? Explore a little, experiment- Appalachia is your oyster!
---
Back when Turtle did that video, animated cards gave 5 points per level, instead of just 1 per level for regular cards.  So old way it was best to level up and trade in the animated cards.
---
Beth changed that due to PTS feedback.  Now all cards give 2 pts per level, and the animation doesn't affect the pts at all.
---
So Lasers are still as strong ?
---
The eyebot committed seppuku just to confuse you!  The bastard
---
This. The one DO team I saw wasn't even doing them. I didn't see a single person on my server doing the op.
---
Shots? Pss, I just take a few swings with my battle axe. Not like they can hurt me lol
---
I purposely avoided the missions for a long time. I preferred to explore and discover at my own pace.
---
Its added a lot of leveling to change up my build for the new meta was what im getting at. I started a new toon just for a vats build and it feels i wasted lots of hours doing it now. V.A.T.S. seems kinda useless now without a stealth factor in the build. Im running pa for the carry weight as the backpack grind is tedious. Almost feel a new character might need to be started again.
---
I finally got one, after looking all day
---
How do you think I feel? I have a 24” TV, and I can’t figure out how to adjust it so I can see the edges of the screen!
---
So everyone who criticizes the update just sucks at the game. Gotcha. You’re really contributing to the discussion.
---
damn wish I thought of that in advance, just spent half an hour running around hiding in the water (no melee weapon, and punch seemed to do nothing...didn't think of weapon bash, ended up quiting when final mission objective was to kill a group of them)
---
And server hope relentlessly for half an hour until you find one where a Queen Beast is about to spawn
---
Do events and go around exploring, with the new update mobs will not be over powered anymore. You will find scrap all over.
---
Lewisville has a lot of aluminum and good material.
---
Helvetica has LOT of wood!! And canned dog food.
---
Nuka plant also will have a lot of surgical trays for steel and also nuka cola. 
---
Make sure to server jump to replenish these.
---
I Will try it, hopefully it works. I have the Digital and no issues , but my brother has the disc version. His runs smooth when playing online too. The Re-update and reinstalling is strange to me.
---
Thank you very much, I really appreciate the advice.
---
The ore really stacks up too if you’ve been killing Earl.
---
I haven’t used melee in over 250 levels, but had to today for the resilient robots.  Since I don’t carry a melee I did the shoot and bash for kills method, I definitely missed way more than I should have when bashing.  I really feel for melee players right now.  I didn’t notice the nerf on my commando or heavy gunner but it looks like it was pretty harsh on melee.
---
This shouldnt surprise us really as they always did the same with their SP titles also.
---
Are Appalachian oysters similar to Rocky Mountain oysters?
---
Who needs more than 100 power o.O
---
Bashing being slow and having a long cool down was the most frustrating part of DO tbh. It wasn’t THAT bad and I’m a stealth Commando so half my build wasn’t even viable
---
I find the Mysterious Stranger fully leveled is doing most of the actual 'killing.'
---
Interesting, I did not know this
---
100% this ^
---
Again, bans should be up to Bethesda, not the community. Should they implement an account-wide bank or something to make mules obsolete? Maybe, but part of the game right now is balancing your weight with what you choose to keep. That's their decision.
---
Yes, their enforcement of exploits and timeliness of dealing with them has been terrible. 'm not arguing that fact.
---
Had to google to see what you meant, don’t bring that bull here you leaf
---
That is seriously depressing
---
yeah i agree, im playing it right now and its overly ridiculous . i dont think ill be able to solo this on my main (lvl 54)
---
Yeah, two doesn't get much ore (if any), just lots of kills.
---
Adrenaline perk helps alleviate it too.
---
One of few from what I’ve seen on a couple pages I tried a bloodied build a little bit back and found it to be very boring I even tried using weapons found to be useless to most like the broadsider and still found it a little boring because it was too easy to one shot a lot of things and stay hidden with the stealth and stuff.
---
Vampires makes super cheesy.
---
Shotgun still gets the job done so I'm keeping that.
---
I feel its for more pvp play that i dont really care for unless i go into NW on purpose.
---
Shouldn't be reinstalling, the updates are just huge. I have a disc as well but have never had any issues other than today it not wanting to update
---
Mines as strong as ever, so is my gat plasma on my second character.  I spent about three hours just roaming and fighting enemies everywhere with different weapons to see.  Explosive lasers are still stupid strong, as is my railway.
---
To be fair, levels 50-100 were always kind of weird and had a lot of weird level matchups. You’re meant to focus your build and acquire better weapons and armor between those levels. Think of it as growing pains, once you get to 120ish it gets a lot easier
---
Yeah, this totally blows. Used to be fun to go fuck up some low level monsters. Now everything's smacking me around and dangerous. Losing interest.
---
Bloody was previously enjoying the benefits of a dozen or so bonuses multiplying on top of each other, so turning x’s into +’s was a dramatic change.
---
Bloody Unarmed got hit the hardest, because it was multiplying so many effects, perks and mutations, with all of that modifying a relatively high base damage figure.  Losing 70% of 2500 is a lot more significant than losing 70% of 50.
---
Conversely, I barely notice any change with a high health junkie heavy gunner.  I was only stacking heavy gunner, bloody mess, adrenaline perks and a 50% junkie boost. I’m guessing most high health automatic builds are seeing roughly unchanged DPS, and it’s simply an issue of enemies being spongier overall.
---
I took the ammo one, the infiltrator one, the survival one, the radiation one, and the fusion core refill one.
---
The rad one and the fusion core one are crazy strong. I did not need to use a single radaway because not once did I have a single point of radation. The fusion core one honestly might be completely broken. It refills your fusion core when attacked by energy damage but it also heals you. Which led to a moment where I took a laser to the face from an assaultron and my health didn't even move. I didn't use up a single fusion core my entire playtime either. Ended up dropping most of the ones I was carrying.
---
And the survival one is just great as a multi purpose food drink and disease cure.
---
Still need to get the last few levels to 300. Plan on picking up funky duds for thst sweet poison resist.
---
You don't need 8, you can do it with 2 but 4 is nice
---
I fucking kid you not, the first week of that event, Earle spawned up top as the rubble cleared. We're waiting at the collapsed entrance, it opens up, he spawns behind us in the room.
---
This is one of the best patches they have dropped the only patch that is probably better was wastelanders but this just breathed a lot of fresh air into the game
---
Run around and explore!  Some of my best memories from this game were from seeing what I ran across randomly.  There's a lot of unmapped locations and hidden treasures and encounters you can find by walking in any direction and walking into every burned out building.  
---
You wanna go there? Go there!  You wanna take that junk? Snatch it!  You wanna kill that thing?  Possibly go for it, depending on what it is! (OH GOD NOT THE BEARS)
---
STR, PER, END, INT, AGI and Follow Through. All maxed.
---
Certain monsters should simply be capped. No way a Mole Rat should ever be level 50. They should cap at 20.
---
Thanks so much. I think I'll stick with a bloody build since all my top weapons are in that. Just felt like I got nerfed big time after this patch.
---
Daily Ops will easily make you more ammo than you need if you run it a few times. At the beginning of the day I had around 2900 2mm EC, and at the end I was over 5000 just from the Ops
---
Thank you!
---
Also join a daily ops team, if you gave people on the team with you just start and wait at the start for a bit, my experience today was that my team joined me
---
FYI the fusion core one is supposed to work like that
---
I haven’t had too much trouble. Just a Two-Handed Rifleman build, max Adrenaline. My Sledge still drops with 2-3 hits and my TSE Lever Action is 2 to the chest or 1 to the head. Really no change on my damage numbers.
---
I think I'm checking out of the game. One day of this and it's game breaking for me. Hope they can change it soon.
---
Holy heck. What level are you?
---
If you are interested in unique items (even if they're not that good), you may want to just mess around and explore your way up to 50. Many quests give unique named rewards, some of which have legendary effects that are not otherwise obtainable, that scale to your level. And there is no way to raise the level after you get it. You can trade for them, but people rarely keep them around. If you are fine with spoilers, you can look up quest rewards to see if they reward anything like that.
---
Otherwise, just enjoy and take things slowly. With one wasteland out, you no longer have to worry about straying from the "intended" path, you can go wherever you want.
---
The main thing to note is that playing before and after level 50 is an entirely different experience. All gear except a few unique things like chainsaws/drills cap out at level 45 or 50, so you won't have to keep replacing your gear with better leveled ones and can focus on getting good legendary rolls. You will have access to anything in the game if you can get it. All quest and event rewards should be max level for you. You will be focusing on refining just your perks and build instead of your SPECIAL, since that caps at 50. Even though it takes many people until level 80-100 to reach the real "end-game", 50 is probably the biggest change you will experience in a single level. Until then, it's really more about just exploring and figuring out the game
---
852
---
What rads, funky duds, power sprinter,electric absorption,survival shortcut, and endurance. 
---
I'm a pa tank build with a ve plasma
---
There's a glitch with the weight bench u can stack +2 strength as many times u want
---
Yeah I know just so other people can finish it too
---
I am over 100 but you are 100% right. When I was at level 50 I had 30-40 gear so I struggled against high level enemies.
---
You can solo it as well and still get Elder. I did on my first try with electric absorbtion and PA.
---
Really? It's pretty incredible. Almost certain I can solo the Imposter with it. Might try at some point this week.
---
I had the opposite effect last night, normally I take care of ghouls and my wife runs the ore, but this time there were a few more people, thinking they are just there for the xp I decided to help with the ore, and you wouldn't believe it but every one doned their PA, and set off for ore, we lost a scavenger...
---
Sounds like a youtube video in the making
---
answer is technically yes because the repeatable exp challenge is a weekly
---
I'm level 107. Sorry to say, it's not going to get easier. I did the Lighthouse event and it was taking like 10 shotgun blasts to kill a Rad Toad and they were getting through my armor. That's fucking nuts.
---
I would like to see the brotherhood at least take the darn camp back where we drop schematics off in the wall dropbox of holding.
---
Buddy you just need to move your camp module and fast-travel on your camp. You just need to do it repetitively and you will eventualy understand where to put it.
---
Personally i place it at the edge of my camp and fast-travel on it. It immediatly tells me approximatively where my spawn point is located. After that you can start playing a lil bit more with it.
---
More actually. And doesn't fit snug in any locations where you can hide it for protection. Not practical unless you're into the asthetic of it.
---
Still using my two shot explosive handmade, the change it’s kinda refreshing actually (i know, unpopular opinion)
---
Holy shit yes. I had a full team earlier all were around me just trying to kill enemies and loot, and I’m standing at the uplink doing the follow me emote and squatting manically like a fucking lunatic.
---
My ts grenade launcher still one shots most things.  It also has the added bonus of hilariously launching them TO THE MOOOOOOON
---
I used to tote around a lightweight Vampire Explosive Handmade to have fun blasting low-level Scorched and shit. That gun's completely useless now. Won't even scratch them.
---
Why when I read comments like this nowadays do I go right to "This guy definitely works for Bethesda!" Sad state the community relations have got to.
---
Problem is that there's little risk with getting legendaries or using them. Bloodied builds are legit built to one shot most things, and hardly die because of legendary armor effects and perks.
---
Idk, some of us like having electricity, indoor plumbing, and our natural set of teeth. But if you're happier in the past, by all means I hope you enjoy it
---
I like vampire Vanguard because you're essentially an invincible tank until you have to reload
---
You're contributing a lot by making up bullfeces about molerats being bullet sponges.
---
I'm not sure this will help you but here is what I found:
---
Once a pet makes it to your camp and becomes part of it, every time you log in he wants to spawn near your C.A.M.P. unit.  If you have built stuff close to your unit there is a high chance he will spawn in under something you built and die.  Try not to build anything within a full floor away from your C.A.M.P. unit.  The further away the better.
---
Lots of people think a camp is a 5 story high cylinder but it's actually 10 stories big.  It just goes 5 stories up and 5 stories down.  I have a CAMP set up right now that goes BOTH directions up and down a cliff.   The game doesn't really know how to handle that with my pet so it gets put in random spots and is stuck.  It doesn't move.  Same for my ally actually.  They are kinda frozen wherever they spawn in which works for me.  Survived for weeks.  You might want to try it.
---
My trusty ve 15 plasma still rocks. Can't even notice a difference tbh
---
Those rapid(right word?) Bears are hellish at low levels lol.
---
I joined a team my 1st time just over 8 minutes it took
---
In my opinion the only ones worth it are power plants for cores and dabney for copper.  Maybe hemlock holes for acid.  I keep a generator stored and just slap down extractors and power, nothing more.  Occasionally you need them for challenges, that’s really it IMO.
---
Yeah, Resilient was a terrible choice. How many players have good Melee weapons? Some, sure, but not a ton.
---
I was soloing the OPS event today, finally figuring out what needs to be done.  I presume I was getting closer to the end, because I just finished Bravo and I had to mop up the remaining bots.  One last bot to go, a Gutsy, stuck underneath the stairs, just out of melee range.

and this is the strongman outfit and deathclaw hunter hat on a female character - https://i.imgur.com/SJzhwsd.jpg
---
Yes thank you, we need some love for the Order! I play my character as a MoM but you'd hardly be able to tell. I just try to make her classy lookin at least.
---
I would love a secret knock, and your ally slides it open and asks for the password
---
At one point they did give 5 points. But we're switched to be the same as a normal perk card
---
Tenderizer was always obsolete
---
Probably precisely why why introduced it.
---
I have my camp by New Ghad. Walked over to test things out again. When I noticed it was taking me 8 shots from my tse handmade to kill a basic super mutant, I got off.
---
Commies are always happy because vodka.
---
We're not mad Bethesda,
---
Just disappointed.
---
I did think concentrated fire was fucked. I should trust myself more when it comes to this game tbh.
---
Yea that too .1 may not seem like much till you suddenly find yourself with like 100 of a few ores
---
Get yourself a swing speed knife and put it on your favorites wheel; you'll hit one of them. /s   
---
We got nerfed pretty bad, yeah.  I don't really run any buffs but mutations and whatever weapons with vanguard armor.  My main melees went down about 25%.  I use Instigating whenever possible; Vampires in mobs and Furious on SBs, etc.  The nerf is across the board, so we just gotta get used to it I guess.  
---
The enemy scaling magnifies the change but it just means I have to swing more.
---
Hey, level 107 and this is unbelievably bad.
---
&gt;"We can't make melee viable so we will force them to use it anyways"
---
I tend to agree, lazy assed developing.
---
/whoosh
---
Yes, exactly. Thus bloodies should not be top dmg. Low risk should have lower reward. It's still more risk than junkies, and that should still be reflected.
---
I also think that legendary concept in general breaks concept of fallout... But I don't think that's worth debating at this point.
---
Furious combat
---
Furious for general combat, trouble shooter for silo runs
---
Not everyone is gifted with common sense, i actually dont even know why its called common sense when its far from common.
---
Vanguards secret service if you're full health build, bolstering if you're not. If you don't have secret service, heavy combat with the BoS paint mod. If you're using power armor, T-65 otherwise T-51, Ultracite or XO-1 are all good with minor differences.
---
V2525 Fixer, I'd say. With the right perks, the damage difference between it and Bloodied/Junkie's is slim, but you can keep your health up with Vampire's. Which you'll damn well need with the Daily Ops.
---
I had a blast doing today's daily op, the game NEEDED some kind of challenge added to it.  But it may have been a bit much for the player base at large as the first introduction to ops.
---
Cant kill them. Get them to like 1% health and zero damage after.
---
Tse/aae combat. Qe/ie double barrel. Gauss shotguns are by far the best but r locked behind a 1 month grind
---
Good attitude!  I found a junkies ss buzzblade on my mule, I’ll start toting that around for fun.  My mighty weed eater!
---
I know that, you know that, why the fuck don't the Beth modelers know that. 
---
Its also made WAY worse by the fact that wall height and dome shape mean that the circle being made smaller by the hexagon that fits within it is a much smaller diameter than the floor was. 
---
So its like the floor was 20ft in diameter, but that's not where the hex starts, it starts 15ft off the ground where the diameter is 12ft. (Not actual dimensions)
---
Why not make the greenhouse dome have flat walls inside while they're at it. Just make the powers glass 10ft thick?  Buncha knobs.
---
Using a gun to bash them counts as melee. I was doing it with my gatling.
---
Frankly, the camp restrictions on it are ridiculous. When it was released in fallout 4, you could snap walls to it, and stick it in its own little shed.
---
Why they ported it as it's own free floating thing is beyond me, especially with the 400 power downgrade
---
Sentinel vanguard secret service.
---
I'm in the other camp, I guess (pun not intended): actually glad to see some *red* stuff in here as opposed to the cash shop. However out of place they may feel considering the main theme.
---
And then there's the greenhouse set as well.
---
As far as weapon. I prefer Pump action. Combat I believe gets the most damage but depending on what Legendary you get the Pump Action performs better. Double barrel is a little rough IMO. 
---
So there are 3 perks(all 3 stars each) under strength to put up the damage and I believe one more perk that goes along with shotguns. Agility is 1 perk(3 stars) Enforcer. Which helps a lot. I can let you know tomorrow exactly what my Shotgun build is. Perception I use  the perk to choose the limb you shoot at in VATs. Put that at one star. It will go with the perk that increases the chance a shotgun will cripple a limb.
---
Is it possible that you maybe missed some nodes? Or that the activation prompt was bugged and you didn’t actually mine anything?
---
Yeah they should of either did the nerf or one wasteland. Both together is a bit excessive
---
They broke something (shocking).  I don't know if they lowered the camp budget, or if they increased the budget cost of some items, but something is seriously messed up.  I was about 5% under before, and I had to scrap three turrets to be able to build anything.
---
Override, not overWRITE
---
Yep, AI are too strong. They can almost kill you in one hit. I really hope they fix adrenaline.
---
Disappointed that the Season board doesn't have any skins or paint for ....weapons other than rifles. No pistol or gatling or melee weapon paints or skins. Why? As a gunslinger, it makes me honestly not wnat to do it, i don't care about the boring CAMP cosmetic stuff and some scrip or bullion that is HARDLY hard to come by.
---
Just to clarify because theyre new, Tse=Two shot + Explosive. AAE=Anti-Armor + Explosive. Qe= Quad + Explosive. Ie= Instigating + Explosive.
---
Concentrated fire hit me the most, I was not even aware it was bugged.
---
Okay thanks!
---
Of course I just hit lvl 50 before this 😭
---
It might be RNG hating you, with how many times you can gather from an ore node.
---
Sometimes it's once, other times it's like 4 or 5.
---
It was not ok, try leveling a new character and going anywhere near high traffic areas? it was WAY over leveled like disgustingly so. You'd have to log out and back in multiple times to get appropriate leveld mobs for literally every quest.
---
It was TERRIBLE. they knew they were losing new players due to this. It had to be fixed. Fallout is not D&amp;D.
---
Yeah, they broke something with camp budgets.  I was way over after the patch without changing anything, and I'm not alone:  
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/itih2n/camp_over_budget_after_patch_with_no_changes/
---
Those gutsies was barely tickling me in PA and emergency protocols with nerd rage, try it
---
My shotguns feel more powerful and my handmades feel like they are shooting toilet paper now, my TS Limb double is hilarious now.
---
I feel your pain.  I agree that the melee damage nerf in particular went way overboard.  The other nerfs are a bit more reasonable.  I can live with those.
---
But i have the urge to press “esc” everytime i’ve done daily op. ;(
---
I mean yeah this is why I bought the game so
---
i honestly don’t feel the difference with it at rank 3 equipped. is it that useless or am i missing something.
---
but i have it on most time anyway because i don’t know what to spend my other perks on. a lil extra damage juice i guess.
---
Exactly. It just is too much at once. Especially when they talked about buffs while it was on the PTS and never did it.
---
The funny/horrible thing is that the only thing I want is the beer stein. 😭
---
If only they’d do that with SBQ and Earl.  Last night I dropped nukes on the Queen and my game crashed after the kill.  Couldn’t log back into server and missed out.
---
On top of that they either lowered camp budget, or drastically raised the budget cost of some items, as some of us found ourselves suddenly over budget on our existing camps.  
---
Yeah I managed to get my teammates from camping near the entrance to the uplink, but they didn't understand they had to stand beside it. 
---
Soloed two events today already where no teammates participated in objectives.
---
Go for torso shots rather than headsots, unless you're really close. Sure the damage is less per bullet (compared to the head), but it's better than missing and doing *zero* damage per bullet.
---
TSE fixer is dealing double the Bloodied version, without demo expert. That was the biggest change for me. Also concentrated fire is now back to level 1
---
I'm loving this daily op.  I play a tanky melee PA build and it was my time to shine as all the bloodied players ran for their lives lol
---
I luckily had a tse handmade and railway on my alt so my ballistic PvP isn't really touched but I'm probably not gonna run queen much anymore.
---
Yeah I feel like major boss fights should do that
---
You're two days old? Happy late birthday!  🎉  🎉  🎉
---
I have Instigating Gauss and Combat shotguns. They are a ton of fun.
---
If you could complete the season with only weekly challenges without completing a single daily just through normal play you're either intentionally trying to do something ridiculous or you really don't want to be playing this game to begin with.
---
Read the directions, watched Angry Turtles instructional, watched Mitzee's ( Mrs Turtle) play through, and went in solo. Promptly got hopelessly lost in Burrows, couldn't find anything. Relief came when I finally died &amp; escaped the whole thing!
---
Nope, not worth is, maybe for the power cores, but I get them as event rewards.
---
I only claim workshops for SCORE challenges, other than that, I avoid them.
---
Although being fair, SBQ and earle DO drop legendaries and event rewards right in your inventory, just not SBQ and Earles body legendaries
---
I tried storing it, then deleting it and neither fixed it sadly :(
---
I have a Vampires limb buzzblade I might bust out, good idea.  If you're a Junkie I suggest a switchblade.
---
Perks as well will increase damage resistance. Barbarian under strength for example agility has one as well
---
I can live with the 800lb stash size, it is the scrip limit that is a PITA.  If not for that, my stash would be fine.
---
So instead of a lv10 nocturnal rolling pin, I can now have a lv50 one?? All I've ever wanted!
---
I tried fast travelling, leaving the game, deleting the camp item, nothing has fixed it yet though. I might have to reset my whole camp :(
---
Also did youse notice fast travel to Foundation and Crater are free now??
---
Campfire tales should be a deathfest then.
---
The twisted Dev at Bethesda strikes again.
---
Knowing full well many of us would be still smarting at our bloodied builds being Nerfed in to oblivion.
---
We kick off with an event where you really need an OP bloodied build to deal with Gutsies that shred you.
---
And if that is not bad enough you have to multi task between a Gun,and Melee weapon whilst the Gutsies are ripping you a new arsehole.
---
As a Bloodied build i went through 60 Stim [packs.It](https://packs.It) was insane
---
Not enjoyed playing this evening.I am not sure if i am going to continue with this game.And i loved it.
---
You dont need to be Einstein to figure out, that going through twice the amount ammo at events = twice the grinding for ammo .For very little reward.
---
In my opinion all this Nerf has done has made all weapons in the game, other than fast firing automatic weapons pretty much obsolete.These are the only viable weapons now that will give you a decent DPS.
---
My Zealots explosive 50 Cal with 30% extra damage to scorched that i kept in my Stash thank God is now my go to weapon.
---
I am not even sure bloodied  is worth it now tbh.
---
The Zealots 50 Cal can put out 120 a shot running with 3/4 health.
---
The Bloodied Mingun has been reduced from 120 + a shot to 69 running with nearly no health.
---
Sure the 50 Cal can not putout  the same DPS  as the Bloodied Mingun,And it still the best Queen killer out there.But there is really not much in it now that Bloodied is halfed.And i only think the Bloodied mingun is viable at Queen events because of the well known glitch.
---
That event must have come as a shock to a lot of players.
---
Honestly I'd try running the mine a few times and compare your hauls.
---
I pray for the poor souls that may consider this build
---
God yes, thank you Bethesda so much for this. Its better late than never
---
Lol my je laser still
---
Dumb question: did gun bash will make gun’s durability reduce quicker?
---
My suggested account levels would be a perfect solution for this imo.
---
Nope.  Got a client side mods that make the nodules glow.   Even before i got it i knew every nodule in that place
---
I believe they are referring to the removal of the debuff. The bars will remain there but you won't be penalized for ignoring them anymore. You'll still get the bonus for being well fed if you want to micro manage it though. 
---
No clue on ETA though.
---
It’s that useless
---
Even if you do a 1000 Damage you only do about 30-70 more damage
---
Sometimes If u submit a ticket to Bethesda they will say we do not have the resources to complete this action or something but ur character will still be restored
---
no problem. we all got nerfed, more or less. although rifleman got nerfed harder, similarly to unarmed. you may want to consider moving to commando. or, at least, use a semi-auto rifle instead of a bolt one.
---
here's what I'd recommend, using your build as a base: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3c863f8&amp;d=eu0ce0c62ir2a72a00a30ao0ar2lu2lt2l71la2cu0eh2sg2x92x42x82pg2ph2pi2pp2p00pe1ee2cm0a12an2&amp;m=51c249f8b3&amp;am=18-18-18-18-18&amp;wp=w5&amp;wm=1b28&amp;ad=03478&amp;n=Junkie%20Explode%20Rifleman
---
use that as a base instead. move points around as needed.
---
Yes, it's one perk coin to unequip a legendary perk card.
---
Lmao
---
Daily Ops are here to stay, and the unique reward pool is fairly shallow.  No sense in burning out on unpleasant ops.  
---
I plan on skipping or ignoring bad combos in the future, Resilient being a hard pass every time.  I’d give robots in general a skip unless they have a very easy mutation like chameleon or freeze.  Mutants and raiders are cupcakes compared to gutsies and the assaultron boss.
---
I understand it’s opening day and everyone wants to jump in, including myself.  I plan on being selective.  I don’t play video games to annoy myself.
---
Trash mobs in the forest should not be able to survive headshot 2.5X sneak attacks with an explosive .50 cal hunting rifle.
---
I usually switch target when resilent mob health deplete and let my teammate finish it. Quicker if you got the teamwork.
---
Instantly?
---
If only I could get close enough for a bash without dying (I'm a bloodied stealth build, tried to de-rad some mid-ops)
---
Both Projectiles do 62,5% of its base damage, or 50% each from what the inventory says.
---
There isn't any real reason to build up a workshop beyond the resource excavators and maybe some light defenses.  You never know when a disconnect will just ruin your entire evening.
---
Use PA.  I soloed today's OP since I'm a PA melee build (although I could only get rank 2 in the Op)
---
Really visual bug ??? How is a weapon like the fixer doing less damage a visual bug ? I mean normal my fixer just need one bullet to kill in the forest area but today it took 3-4 bullets to kill one thing. That not a visual bug.
---
Different strokes. I'm a 2 handed brute that just rushes in bashing everything. 
---
My Trouble shooter, increased swing speed Super Sledge makes quick work of bots.
---
Been bloodied commando for months and it seriously didn't change a thing for me. The only challenge was the daily ops and thats because the stupid melee killing bullshit. Still did it multiple times under 8 minutes in a group only dieing a handful of times mostly from the stupid staggered bug from gustys where it sounds like they're meleeing you and it won't let me heal at all during that. Everything goes down just as fast and I gain more ammo than I use during ops
---
I’ll look for one!  Great idea, then I don’t have to look for a reduced weight!  Thanks for the tip :)
---
"Chore" is right. The game is now a fucking chore, not to mention immersion-breaking. I graduated from easier areas and built my way forward; why the hell is everything baseline level 50? Makes no fucking sense.
---
I used to farm the grafton by Poseidon for caps. Not anymore as its lvl 60 for me.
---
&gt;800 storage space is bad
---
Not as bad as launches 400 space
---
Glaive.. all I want
---
Well yea, because baking at night is for fully pro bakers
---
Yeah, I didn't mind any of the individual ideas, but putting in ranged enemies who won't close and can only be killed in melee along with an objective you're supposed to stand near is honestly just kind of dumb.  We completed the op, but it felt really unpolished.
---
On top of that numerous times my melee swings simply wouldn't connect.
---
Shadman is apparently a communist GI Joe bad guy
---
Supposedly the harpoon gun is “silent” like the flamer, but I’m sure you’d get much more dps from the flamer
---
I found that using my .50 heavy gun was faster to get them down so that I could hit them with a melee weapon for the kill shot. Without that took much longer and I had to heal more even in power armor.
---
I logged in today and lo and behold my bloodied unarmed character has to do 3 power hits on a level 95 assaultron and 2 with stealth.  This nerf is killing me.  And the special ops mission...my god.  Serendipity wasn’t proccing worth a damn.  It hurt.  I love a challenge but after months of gathering and farming this feels like a slap.
---
The biggest problem I had with it was finding a spot I could fast travel out to abandon it!
---
Is it just Duguerrre?.. might have to move your camp or the item
---
Don’t forget it deletes legendary effects!
---
Hopefully they do so very soon, because this season is going to be hell if I've gotta play like this the whole time.
---
wait you still have your teeth
---
This is hilarious.
---
I wish i could up vote x 100 bwhaaaaaaaaaaa.
---
I was actually stressed out doing this event.
---
Gutsies are not easy to kill at the best of times.Hence why us higher Levels have a go to one shot weapons for Nuke runs.Having to kill them whilst fighting with what is now a bloodied pea shooter,and shooting and regenerating their health,and trying to use Stimpacks that refuse to be [used.It](https://used.It) was horrible.
---
Then i believe the choo choo gun will workout or like bow or crossbow workout as well. Their ammo counts as projectile.
---
I will make a test later.
---
Noice
---
What makes the gauss shotguns locked?
---
It was almost universally hated on the PTS, but here it is.  I think a dev really loves the idea for some inexplicable reason and won’t let it die.
---
I assume no one replaces him at Harper’s, then?
---
If so, good. Makes shopping with him a much less harrowing experience.
---
F
---
Honestly have no idea why people were angry about them I was able ro get the three perks that I wanted uo to level 3 in one day given I am level 294. I would have had 4 cards but they took away the heavy armor one for WTFKW
---
Who The Fuck Knows Why
---
So what exactly is bugged with concentrated fire? And currently or before the patch?
---
Do you have Fallout 1st?  If so, pick up everything and scrap everything and store it in your Fallout 1st box.  If not, you'll end up having to do some inventory management.  Before I got Fallout 1st I typically kept 50 of everything, except for lead/steel/cloth/acid (needed for making ammo) and ballistic fiber.
---
For weapons, don't worry about upgrading them or modding them.  Take what the game gives you and swap out for new weapons as you pick them up.  Same with Armour.  This will continue up to  level 50, which is when you start getting max level drops (level 45 and 50 weapons and armour).
---
Every time you log in, join a public team.  In general, the best type of team to join is the Casual team as it gives you higher intelligence which gives you more XP for everything.  You can swap teams at any time if you want to change your bonuses depending on what you are doing, however, it does take a little bit of time for full bonding to complete, so keep and eye on that.
---
You can turn in extra legendaries for script.  However, it doesn't make sense to spend that script on new legendaries until you reach level 50 unless you are at or near max (1000 script).  If you do have to spend script prior to level 50, you can't go wrong with exchanging it for legendary modules.  You will need these later in the game to craft legendary secret service armour and some specific weapons.  I don't think that these are level locked, but I could be wrong.
---
There are some perk cards that you will want early, but try to not pick any until after you get the perk pack at every 5 or 10 levels.  For example, you are at level 14, if you wait to spend perks until level 20, you will have get a free perk pack at level 15 and one at level 20.  In those packs you might get cards that you would have spent perk points on but now you can get a different card instead.   On a more advanced note, you can add a perk point to one category but get a card from a different category.
---
Yea it’s coming to the atomic shop at some point
---
My double armor piecing shotgun shreds now. Just gotta be up close and personal.
---
The Shower is what I consider to be an 'end game' reward. Don't expect to have it before level 50. 
---
It's very useful, but not required and expensive to craft. 
---
That said, if you are dead set on getting it asap you should be able to with a few days of farming, the hard part will be getting enough stabilizing material to convert the flux. The area around monongah mine is chock full of Yellowcake and Cobalt but you'll have to hit the bog for everything else unless someone nukes Whitesprings.
---
How good is it to have a cleaned out perk card area too, this is by far the best update they've done.. so far.
---
u can opt to specialize depending on enemies, like troubleshooters for robot enemies
---
I really wanted to make an iron man base with them
---
Thats right. But thats the reason this is a big damage nerf
---
Hands down.  No question.
---
Geewiz. You either get it or you don’t I guess. Some of us liked the way this game was about 3 or so patches ago. No hard feelings
---
I really take that to heart coming from someone who doesn't know that the contraction for "you are" is "you're." You sure put me in my place!
---
Edit: Also, "an idiot." The sentence you are looking for is "you're an idiot." 😘💋💓💘💖💖💖💖💖
---
Ouch, that’s rough.
---
It needs it's own 7th slot. The only non combat  altering perk shouldn't have a cost to remove it.
---
vanguard's and bolstering are more or less useless assuming your base dr and er are high enough, which they probably are. a mixed set of creature-specific armor is the correct answer. exterminator's, zealot's, troubleshooter's, ghoul and mutant's slayer.
---
but in order to be really tanky you'll need to rely on PA. it gets a hidden damage reduction bonus. T65 is indeed the tankiest of them all, but compared to SH it reduces damage by like 3 points. and SH deals a bit of damage to boot, so it depends on what's your priority.
---
oh, and a set of combat torso and two leather and metal limbs, all heavy, is the highest and most balanced you can get.
---
and don't forget about stuff like dodgy, ricochet, serendipity and emergency protocols, etc.
---
Your right, the weapons themselves, were not nerfed, but a lot of the problem is that significant amount of players run bloodied, and THAT was nerfed, we ALL felt the squeeze from the rebalance, but if you run bloodied, you are stuck with roughly 1/2 the damage you were doing.
---
Seems like the typical Bethesda move... nerf every weapon and buff every enemy the balance is not important... Didn't play since the new update but reading this makes me already unconfortable I mean as you said balance was 100% needed but when I read that magic weapons still work and that the other bugs exist still too I ask myself what were they thinking over at Bethesda ? They just nerfed 90% of the playerbase while 10% will continue playing like they used to.... Good thing I have a magic minigun to negotiate the absurd ammount of damage enemies can take since the new update
---
You do know they are separate teams, even separate studios.
---
Something like [this](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124), hopefully.
---
Yup! Thank you!
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Yes it is.
---
I had zero problem with bloodied PA and emergency protocols with nerd rage
---
&gt;  That makes more sense why I feel like the combat changes dont effect me. I'm sorry that it's that bad that blows. I'm a heavy gun build I dont see much difference
---
When your damage is more a function of volume, this won't be much of a nerf. Not a diss, it's hard as hell to keep those fire hoses constantly on the target as it's flying/running around. I personally find it easier to get one well placed shot.
---
It's just that shot is worthless now.
---
Still the best damage around, and still a lot. There's no need for the overkill. Just adapt man, if you don't like bloody go more vanilla with anti armor or junkies.
---
Not a fan of the new board as much of it is meh IMO but really like the Daily Op so far.  The nerf is rough but I shifted from melee to heavy weapons a while back so it isnt killing me.  Overall Im happier than I expected.
---
7-10 days to get you a slip of paper with a code on it. (Sorry, I pre ordered beta and that's what I got, and I'm still a bit salty about it.) 
---
I will be in a DVD box but still...
---
bloodied build. gives you several bonuses at low health. damage from bloodied weapons, adrenal reaction mutation and the nerd rage perk, and special bonuses from unyielding armor.
---
They're playing a bloodied build, it keeps them at 20% health so their damage output is at its highest. Their whole build is made around it, not worth looking into with this update though imo, unless you already had it.
---
I was definitely riding the struggle bus with my stealth bloodied commando trying to farm scorchbeast meats.  Even with all the food buffs I was struggling to even maintain stealth cover.
---
My biggest annoyance with today’s op was the assaultron at the end. She still had a head beam AND barely paused in her shooting. As if those bots weren’t already op in their own.
---
I'm pissed about the Theremin, I loved the sound it makes. I bought it a year ago or so, but I asked for a refund anyway because it's garbage now.
---
It is often a consequence of selecting a bloodied build - thsi way, user can have low health and keep high damage while eating and drinking
---
I went in with my Vampire's combat shotgun and used a grand total of 5 stimpacks to complete this op solo at paladin rank.
---
also a katana, and a fedora, for defending m'ladys from those bad raiders
---
The current servers are already getting heavily overloaded by just 24 people's stashes and camps. Doesn't help that some asshats bypass stash/camp limits with exploits too and make things look even worse than they are. The only real problem with the system is that they have a specific weight limit instead of item slots. A fully modded pistol weighs a fraction of what a .50 cal weighs in your stash, yet they take up roughly the same space server-wise. If anything, heavy guns have few attachments/attachment slots and would tend to take up LESS space. As we already knew on launch and had proven with the stash boxes, having large amounts of things like stimpaks or junk doesn't have much of an effect, so having an arbitrary limit on quantity based on that is pretty stupid too. We still need and are going to always have limits, but weight isn't the best way of going about it, especially when it can't be affected by perks
---
It is from the armor effect ‚unyielding‘ which give you up to +3 special stats expect endurance per armor piece with the lower your health is. Could also be ‚bolstering‘ which gives up to +35 dr er per armor piece the lower your health is.
---
Yeah I'm sorry but a cave cricket should not be able to one hit a level 294 in full unyealding SS armor
---
Equip the fusion core refill legendary perk. Every time you get hit by a gutsy doing energy damage it heals you. You can pretty much face tank them all if you also have a vamp gun. I ran through twice tonight solo and the closest I came to dying was at the end when I went into the reward screen without realizing I left an enemy alive.
---
Depends on what you need.  Hemlock Holes for Acid is great.
---
I haven't tested it but angryturtle implied something's up with TS*E*s and demolition expert. if his testing is solid, then I'm guessing DE is actually buffing TS for some reason.
---
...for a bit longer :(
---
Ops on PS4 were dead all night as well, for me.
---
Bye
---
But there's resilient robots shooting me from the other side of the map from twelve different directions! D: 
---
/s ^((or is it?))
---
"Just adapt" is a call I keep hearing but there was no reason to go after the bloodied players like this. It feels vicious and cruel that the FIRST thing we see on going into an op is resilient robots, in an environment with freaking irradiated water everywhere. 
---
At a certain point it goes from "o this is a challenge, let's go" to "well fuck this shit I'm out" and I am about a cunt's hair from fuck this shit I'm out.
---
I haven't died yet, but that's probably only because my stealth is ludicrous.
---
I've started just avoiding fights because they're a waste of ammo:  Individual trash mobs in the forest shouldn't eat a whole clip of .50 cal explosive hunting rifle with a 2.5x sneak multiplier.
---
You can use left d pad to swap to your last equiped weapon, I use it regularly on xbox and it's pretty darn smooth, and faster then the wheel
---
Ya that's unfortunate. It makes sense now why some people are doing just slightly less dmg and some are doing alot less
---
Anytime! They say harpoons are good for sniping, but with a legacy flamer you’ll already have that covered haha
---
I totally feel you’re pain . 
---
Yesterday ,before the update, I was rebuilding my camp and I glitched the Slocum Joe vending machines through the walls of the atomic shop traincart . 
---
So there faces are behind the windows inside the cart but the front of the vending machine is outside . I also put  the windmill generator in the traincart so it rising through the roof . It looks pretty neat . 
---
Today I was hoping to put Becketts bar in as well , but after this patch I’m afraid to start the game . 
---
Why did they do it ? Building is 70% of the game for some people . 
---
Goodbye creativity , goodbye fallout 1st account ...
---
Before
---
Shiskebab sword is a katana
---
They're really spreading those bundles kind of thin, too.  The same amount of items could easily have been in a smaller number of bundles.  The Mothman camp bundle is the only one that felt like a full bundle.
---
Its doable solo in pa with emergency protocols and some vamp heavy
---
Raaar
---
Weak sauce
---
Animal and creature specific pieces will never be as good as bolstering or vanguards in that case because you'll never get high enough base DR/ER. SH hasn't really done significant enough damage for a long time. Combat is far more well rounded and id say it's more worth it to have a set if combat unless you're about to have multiple sets for different purposes.
---
Have to uninstall it I believe
---
do you have demolition expert?
---
Will my BE lasers suck ow?
---
While I kept some nice utility perks, my deck is far cleaner now.
---
If only they added that feature to let us change the ranks of maxed out cards...
---
I want to fight about it, because the whole update is unfair for low levels, and bethesda knew it. Bullet sponge enemies and wasting your ammo at low levels shouldn't be a thing and yet it was introduced with this patch.
---
U have to get max reputation with the settler's
---
ya, i do way less damage now and it's really not fun ... oh well ...
---
This has been a problem since the patch dropped today. I had a decent amount of budget left Monday night. After the patch, my budget was not only maxed out, but if I removed items, I couldn't place them back because it was still saying my budget was maxed... I put in a ticket so it should be fixed in 2022.
---
These daily OPs seem like perfect meat grinders for xp gains, especially come triple xp weekend. Start it up, chem/food up/lunchbox up and get to the first objective and then just not do it and kill all the mobs for that sweet exp
---
Enemies should all be your level everywhere.
---
I took one look at "only dies to melee" and spent the evening building my new "no bos" camp instead.
---
You can remove the legendary perks....cost 1 coin per move.
---
I’m not entirely sure but I think junkies is part of the “magic” weapon catagory
---
What are you currently playing? Sniper? Commando? Melee? Power armour?
---
just fav it
---
This
---
And it just wouldnt hit headshots before?
---
Yeah too late now
---
Yes it is, you still do way more damage than nonbloodied
---
No more ammunition factory at my CAMP that sucks 😕
---
Troubleshooters armor! Get a full set and the bots do nothing to you damage wise. Same thing for the super mutants get a mutant slayers set. The daily ops are only one enemy type so the right armor and your golden
---
Some use pa, in which case you get emergency protocols instead.
---
I had like 4 or 5 chatacters, and I have never issues on low levels. you have 3 locations for start, with low levels events and everything was fine. With all characters. Have never had issues you mentioned.
---
Arclab hat for fedora
---
Edit: plain black outfit’s are sure to be around
---
I have a power armor but run out of fusion cores so don't use it too often. My best weapon is a combat shotgun and second is probably a sniper rifle or tesla rifle.
---
This is the type of shitpost that I can get behind.
---
I had a feeling something like this patch was coming.  I sandbagged lvl ups the last three months to have room to tinker.  I’m glad I had those 50+ lvls now.
---
I've watched like one of his vids bruh and it was the magic gun one
---
Possibility I thought of that I don’t have time to test:
---
Perhaps damage doesn’t scale either? It would explain how tea time and other events are still easy despite the level 75-100 enemies.
---
It's still strong but is behind the tse and aae now, and ofc the je like before
---
It's not from them.  Players intentionally get rads to use bloodied weapons more effectively.
---
Wait is that true? If so I’m slapping a shredder on my magic mini. Bashing enemies in PA is wildly inaccurate when armed. Might make this very lazily designed op somewhat bearable
---
Uninstall the mod
---
WHAT?!
---
This is just baffling to me... I'm 203 and had zero issue with the new mission. Use a vampire gun for one. Are you in power armour? I'd use that too. I run bloodied PA and didn't die once and used maybe 5 stims in as many runs.. have you got emergency protocols? Are you using nerd rage etc. This seems so far away from my experience I just don't understand...
---
Turning around is hard on console
---
“Shits gotta change...”
---
That’s what Bethesda said too.
---
I am really impressed, hats off to Bethesda, that this time they managed to bring all 3 things announced without delays or problems /any noticable bugs yet,  this update is really, really good, and absolutely satisfying to me.
---
The only thing is, that Bloodied is nerfed to much, its flat a 40% nerf in overall damage output, 20% are ok, but not 40%, thats to much, but since i switched to AntiArmor, its not that important for me anymore but for everyone else who playing bloodied.
---
u/ladydevann
---
Thank you so much for all the advice, I will keep all that in mind for sure :)
---
Oh ignore my post above -- yeah PA is heavy makes it a piece of cake.
---
Isnt that perk bugged giving you full hp for some reaaon?
---
I know use bloodied weapons myself with a full set of unyielding which gives me up to +3 SPECIAL stats per armor piece except for endurance
---
Lol “I don’t want all of us doing the same thing” 
---
So people haven’t been running the same Junkie and Bloodied builds all the time already?
---
It's hard to gauge, the plate after the 45 that should be the 35 is really thin.  I think you're right in that it's supposed to be 315 going by the diameters, but the plate thickness is inconsistent in that image.
---
Wow why are they fucking over stealth builds like this... if that's the case, we're cut off from the content until we change builds.
---
Ammo factory+ammo smith+super duper
---
Can you even read?
---
I really hope they fix that, because a mix of scout and Thorn doesn’t seem to work either.
---
lmao I ran into lvl 50 Radstag yearlings that took WAY too many shots to bring down.
---
This whole blanket lvl 50 thing is kind of bonkers tbh. Some mobs SHOULD be weaker.
---
it's 1% wasteland not 1 wasteland... :)
---
Seems fine on my 200 character, maybe I should hop into the 65 one and try... eek
---
Well, 2 explosions it would make sense.
---
Super duper is at lvl 50
---
and I didn't say it is a dnd, I said the current autoleveling system is shitty like in the most dnd based videogames.
---
You can move the module without moving anything else
---
Are you on Xbox by any chance
---
No.
---
Got her health halfway and my game crashed 🙃
---
&gt;**There is no GOOD reason for only 800 storage space**
---
* Cost management
---
* Server load management
---
* Room to grow into when both of the above are managed adequately
---
* Less down pipe bandwidth usage leading to lower potential latency on the user's end trying to list and respond to requests made that change the inventory state
---
* Better user performance and responsiveness on their end due to the prior reason
---
Yeah, no good reasons at all... smh
---
Also, if all MMOs have it, I would hazard to guess that there is a good reason for designing it that way that isn't solely monetary in reason.
---
Yeah he definitely has to increase his Dew intake.
---
Player vendors would be a good idea, search each map for players selling lots of ammo. But being level 23 will probably mean caps are an issue most of the time.
---
Perhaps think about using a melee weapon for smaller mobs, combat knives are cheap, repair easily, and are quick too.
---
Given their typical bugfixing pace it could last quite a while.
---
One shot would add 20% accuracy even on auto weapons. Now It adds 4% per shot
---
&gt;Or at least buff the sneak damage modifier back to x4.
---
You shouldn't have to sneak for a rifleman build to be viable.
---
Enemies, especially trash mobs, have too much health, and more importantly, **way too much armour.**
---
All the enemies are basically running around in power armour, as far as their armour ratings are concerned.
---
Perk loadout has been updated, so it no longer blocks the ops report  page, or the legendary perks. But SFE still needs to be updated to restore full functionality to perk loadout.
---
Not At this moment but its going into the build for sure. Gotta level up more
---
Servers can’t take infinite stash
---
I purposefully avoided using the firework reload because I knew they’d patch it out ASAP.  It felt like a hard habit to quit cold turkey.
---
I noticed this earlier today too and thought maybe I just missed it when the atlas observatory was changed but no it’s from patch 22
---
:(
---
combat torso/metal and leather limbs net you 258/264 compared to 226/266 from a full set of combat armor. then again, funky duds and sizzling style. but you should also consider shadowed, and combat is not very good shadowed. secret service is the absolute best anyway, at 327/297.
---
factor in scaly skin and grounded, maybe a backpack. more than enough dr and er to put you at the threshold. and at that point, 15% damage reduction is much, much more useful than any bonus damage resistance you can get.
---
you're also right that the damage from SH isn't significant but at the same time, compared to T65, you'll be taking like 3 extra points of damage. so it's kinda irrelevant either way. your choice really, a marginal damage bonus or a marginal defense bonus.
---
FYI perk loadout manager got updated 20 minutes ago - new version should work with legendary perks
---
It might be a good idea to find a good melee weapon as a back up.  Until you get decent guns, you're going to be bleeding ammo on enemies.
---
It’s going to take me 6000 settler rep points to be able to buy the gauss shotgun(and I’ve never seen anyone sell it either) so for now that’s out of the picture. What shotguns with what perks would you recommend instead?
---
"Here's a new perk called "Ammo Factory"
---
**Gutsie drops 4 10mm ammo after soaking up 20+**
---
 *"...You're going to need it.*"
---
I want that fucking electric train set so I can build a basement and hide down there playing with them like I do as an adult
---
An armor piece with -15dmg while blocking equipped = 1 shot most enemies in vats , no shotgun dmg cards needed (dont think a shotty with "magic" perk is even needed) Search for Angry Turtle on YT.
---
You just kind of implied the rads were from unyielding.  No big deal though.
---
As a totally non-melee player at lvl238, my god did I die a lot during this first daily ops lol. Was fun though and some people came to fight beside me so it went well at the end. 
---
And I agree that having the rewards directly in the inventory makes for a nice change of pace.
---
I think you'll get used to the maze after a few tries. I don't mind it not being a tunnel type of setup.
---
What I do dislike is that this OP severely punishes certain builds...and then doesn't let us easily change our SPECIAL on the fly. I'm a stealth focused char (not bloodied) with the best armor you can get + high damage weapons. I was able to get things low quickly. But having to run at 3-4 gutsys that all sit there and take out 10% of your HP per shot + occasionally stun/cripple you....it was just stupid. Especially since Burrows is so close quarters. 
---
I really hope other ops are better. Because if this is an indication of what is to come...they dropped the ball yet again. It was such an unfun and frustrating experience.
---
So nothing about all the broken challenges like finding locations or killing certain creature's I don't think I can kill anymore cave crickets and not get those atoms without going insane
---
Level 23. Not going to help.
---
Care to elaborate?
---
Had fun my first solo run.
---
Do his quest to do the daily and follow up with him on that, have high Intelligence, Strength, or Luck...There's more to that story...
---
I'm right with you on this.
---
Combined with the usually shit implementation of using full names in the trade list it is actually impossible to see what item you are looking at because the full name doest fit into the text space. They should only keep heavy/Sturdy qualifiers and the rest of the modifiers should only be seen with inspect active.
---
I didn’t have any real issue with them, which is strange because my build is kind of a mess lol
---
Greenhouse building set
---
No it's intended, bethesda confirmed it on my post.
---
yeah unfortunately i had already done one before I bumped into him and it didn't count, not that I wont do another anytime soon.
---
Does it stay leveled up when you swap it out?  Or do you lose all of that progress and have to relevel the card if you ever chose to swap it back in?
---
yeah - almost instantly
---
Daily ops is a little bit difficult but i like it really much - killing robots is just a secondary task.
---
The main Task is to submit the signals and stay alive
---
Only in the last stage it is the main task to kill the couple of bots which are marked with an diamond
---
I agree, I just did the event there at the Morgantown airport... The 15-20 scorched that spawn throughout the event were all level 50, and took way too long to kill even with my lever action, etc. I don't think I should have to have the "correct" build just to enjoyably play the game. The forest should be a relaxing place, not a place where even the molerats can kill the distracted vault dweller.
---
This is so odd
---
As has been mentioned, if you need a resource then simply take the Workshop and set up the resource extractors.  Don't worry about anything else.  I never use turrets, etc.  I find it's easier just to repair things.  I sometimes use the tall concrete defense walls around the fusion generator if I can't place it someplace high up.
---
The only workshops that I use are the power plants for fusion cores, Hemlock holes for acid (3x acid nodes), and Federal Disposal Field HZ-21 (1x acid node).  I'll sometimes take over Tyler County Dirt Track if I want to test a new build technique or blueprint something as it has nice wide open flat land for testing builds.
---
On PS4 it is absolutely impossible for me to go into the fast wheel quickly enough to switch between gun &amp; melee while being swarmed by enemies. The wheel is way too laggy even under the best possible circumstances.   
---
However, the left arrow on the D-pad will switch between your two most recently equipped weapons. That's the only way I've been able to finish the daily ops.   
---
Also, I'm finding the First Aid perk critical for getting stimpaks to kick in quickly enough to actually keep me alive... especially when the server is laggy, which is often.   
---
(If you already know about these, I apologize... I have three characters who each range from lvl 110-180 and I still did not remember the left arrow weapon swapping until I was reminded about its existence. I most commonly play a sniper build so the ability to rapidly swap weapons wasn't typically required to survive.)
---
All of them, on both characters. So frustrating.
---
OK, probably the best advice I can give you is this - this game rewards specialisation.
---
Pick a weapon and double down on it. Have a look at some builds online and work towards that with future level ups. Start peeking in player vendors for high dmg prefixes (AA, Two shot, Junkies).
---
If you decide power armour, look for perks like power user in intelligence, they make a hell of a difference.
---
Also decide if you're gonna stealth or be loud and proud and pick the legendary perks follow through or   take one for the team accordingly.
---
And as always continue to ask questions, plenty of people here can and will help :)
---
Is this a low level problem ? I picked my AAE rifle out of my bank and have been smoking shit all day. Refreshing changes
---
I used to play a bloody rifleman on live until today.  Even that isn’t enough.  I knew what was coming from the PTS and had a pair of nice fixers on hand, so I guess I was lucky to easily convert to commando.  
---
Hopefully they’ll bump up damage on single shot rifles or hardened rifle receivers in general.  Otherwise, rifleman is dead.
---
Thank you. In that case i'll stay with my steam subscription.
---
Gold bullion guy in the vault(79?)
---
Refreshing and amazing
---
Agreed, checked the patch notes, saw resilient perk and thought - oh, that’s what is going to be fucked up and broken in the worst possible way. Never mind the absurdity of spawning 100 robots in a tunnel, but when you gun them down to no health so that they need to me melee’d bashed, they actively run away from the fighting to let the waves of other fresh robots swarm you in the tunnels. It’s the opposite of good level design. It’s simply MOAR DUM. If there’s a sadistically stupid limit to what this player base will take - I think I’m personally pretty close to it. All the comically broken mechanics point to a conscious grand experiment that they’re playing.
---
Wait until you get to Earl. I popped every single chem available, a magazine, and food buffs and got to 200 damage on head shots and only while sneaking.
---
Rabid but close enough lol they are fast.
---
I've sent so many legendaries to the moon on explosive rockets that the Zeta aliens probably have better equipment than me.
---
Idk why but I love the perks so much I almost have three maxed out and I don’t have to worry about ammo because of the ammo one don’t have to worry about fusion cores because of absorption perk and the survival Chem one means I don’t need to carry food these perks make the game way more fun
---
A little update. Fate must be on my side because I found a snallygaster tonight at Cranberry Glade. I can say without a doubt that Wasteland Whisperer is not required to tame one, I sent it to my camp using Animal Friend. This is why I don't trust any videos about taming pets on youtube.
---
And lens flare must blind everyone 20 meters around the player
---
My point is that there are a lot of hypocrites here. For the record I don't care either way if someone used exploits like Line in the Sand.
---
Where did you hear that at?????
---
Noticed this quickly, as it took 3-4 minutes to find a piece of my first legendary kill after the update.
---
Are you Xbox? I have fusion cores and other stuff for you if so
---
Ammo is rough until you’re established.  A nicely modded sledgehammer or baseball bat will help you a lot.
---
They messed up with the damage for sure. They also made it increasingly difficult to survive because now your gear is breaking more often.
---
Electric Absorbtion is your best PA perk. Basically nullifies all energy damage.
---
Edit: From most sources, energy turrets can still damage you.
---
I only use it to go ham on shit so its still going to work for that? The close qtr damage insta kills me even in PA how do you prevent so much collateral damage?
---
Feeling that, playing bloodied builds are meant to be high risk high reward, but the reward isn’t really great anymore, almost not worth it, I’ve found I’m being detected easier now too.
---
Yeah, just remember to wander on back and have a chat once you do finish it.  I think it was Str 12+, Int 11+, and Luck 10+ to meet the speech checks.  Grain of salt this was a couple hours ago and I was paying way more attention to the story I got from picking one than I was the checks themselves...
---
&gt;!Lets just say he has a very easy time declaring himself a deserter...maybe a little too easily...!&lt;
---
Agreed. But the good news?
---
Strangler PA, cryo and fire damage can be useful!
---
Now most of us just smoke weed fr
---
I enjoyed today's daily ops just fine. Went solo and it was a bit hard, but I managed to get through without dying even once. I don't run any kinda of "build". I just place the perks on what I want and to hell with it and just have fun.
---
Yeah I just got two of my lower level friends to get into the game and I maxed out my legendary ammo perk because I knew they were going to have a hell of a time with the dmg nerf and the scaling enemies which they did 😂
---
Oh yes my memory of that part of Fallout 4 is returning now. Recycling is good though right? :)
---
Ah shit, I've just been using power armor to get through doors this whole time!
---
they fixed the glitch where I didn't actually have to go get the thing that ward wants me to go get :-/ so no more free gold bullion and stuff.
---
but I do like the fact that there are level 100 enemies out in the wild though.
---
&gt;  I go there to casually stock up on wood and steel, not waste extra bullets
---
That's the issue this post is trying to highlight - the enemies seem to scale infinitely and no matter how good you weapons or builds are nothing is going to get noticeably easier. Progression now is mainly just to break even, not get more efficient.
---
Yeah it is a long grind, but definitely worth it. It blows all other shotguns right out of the water. Also, the reason why you havent seen anyone sell it is because you cant drop or trade it. Same with SS armor, Gauss minigun,  ect.
---
Sure man. Are you also running bloodied? And what shotgun do you currently use?
---
Well since ur only lvl 23 just use a different gun, ur build shouldn't be near finished yet so it doesn't hurt to just switch until u get more. U can't really do much since the only way to get ammo is crafting or trading
---
Damn Bethesda really messed up with this one My build even though I was supposed to be hit the hardest I’m having a way easier time than my lower level friends they really made this a “one wasteland”
---
Yeah it should still work for that
---
No he doesn’t have it :(
---
Before the update i was afraid about daily ops, because stealth doesn't work. But with legendary perks im nearly immortal as bloodied commando. Now its possible to take most of the defensive perks without losing any damage. I soloed daily ops and for me it was like a cakewalk. I really enjoy this update and my build works as i thought.
---
Either the settlers or the raiders have this on their trade list I think.
---
if you're asking what the meta is then probably the special ones. poison and fire resist, too.
---
frankly the ammo one is better suited for mules. and we need confirmation on whether electric absorption is bugged before maxing it.
---
the rest is varying degrees of 'eh' to absolute crap.
---
Atomic Shop item Zooneyzeeny Pinky paint is properly displayed in 3rd person while being viewed in foggy conditions
---
You think that’s bad? I dismantled my entire build and scrapped all the perk cards with the plan of making a completely new build because I thought that you can use the perk coins to buy new perk cards. Imagine my fucking surprise. I was an absolute tank with my previous build and now I’m sitting here cowering in my camp like Mr. Crabs after he lost his shell.
---
It's new, it's coming in a new treasure hunter event.
---
Thanks!! :)
---
I was under budget before, but when I logged in I was at max and couldn't build anymore until I scrapped some stuff. Kinda sucks.
---
I just saw Angryturtles walkthrough.  I’m going to max out the legendary perk where energy damage gives health and use tons of pyschobuff.  Looks like I’ll need to dust off the old power armor as well
---
Looking at the weeklies, doing them will also complete some dailies. So technically, your answer is no.
---
It's the new update.
---
At this point I’d take 50 lvl ones if I’m going to go through this much ammo.  At least then I’d get more XP.  I think the balance should be geared more towards a sum total of levels per instance based on total party levels—not the blanket lvl 50 for everything.  It just feels lazy.  There’s no reason you can’t have a true area boss with a higher lvl and several other lower level spawns.  I’m dreading the daily from the overseer that sends me to the Colonel Kelly monument for a pic.....it’s always swarming with at least 20 radstags and a handful of Yao Guai. 20 lvl 50 and 4 lvl 90?? That’s a lot of ammo for half of a fetch quest.
---
Then spend 2megazillion of bullets to kill it with your useless B2525 fixer in 29 mins
---
Already confirmed, it's not bugged. Bethesda confirmed on one of my posts earlier.
---
I  even had to use VATS  to finish them off .Otherwise i miss more than i connect with a Melee weapon,even if stood in front of me.
---
Really annoying.
---
Follow through for stealth commando is a must
---
Full auto is great.  Everything else is a struggle.  You can do well with any half decent auto rifle or heavy machine gun.  Bloody is still the best, but antiarmor isn’t that much of a downgrade anymore.
---
I kind of agree.  The game had a progression to it and it seems like this hurts it.  Public events already drew lvl 2s to the SBQ, but now it's all a safe space from high levels.  We should at least be able to nuke the vault/Flatwoods to make up for it.
---
That's kinda what a rpg makes it so fun.
---
Bethesda killed the market for weapons.. 100%...
---
Basicly other plays can kill you but they become wanted whick means they get a bounty so if you kill them you het caps
---
Having to accidentally find the Ultra-light Secret Service limbs mod near the bottom of Reg's list seems like a bad decision when all the other mods are in the same section higher up the list under Secret Service. This may seem nitpicky, but I almost just bought the inferior lighter mod because I didn't see it. That would have been quite wasteful and very annoying. Just saying.
---
is it either or, or do you have to meet them all? and if it's either, do you know if he says different things depending on what you pick? I imagine it's the same just with a remark about either forcing it out or being intellectual.
---
This sounds more like a complaint about the daily op, where sneak is disabled. Swap your sneak cards in agi over to defensive ones. As a bloodied commando i drop the sneak covert ops etc add in dodgy and another in its place
---
Under endurance you can get admantium shelton and fire proof helps and a chest piece that has a dense option.  I use "dense" on the SS chest piece instead of the jet pack
---
Those people want to have no build, why not play call of duty then, instead of fps rpg. Its like playing mage in wow with zero talent points, sure you will kill stuff, but with much slower pace
---
I use a 5mm minigun.  I haven't seen this.  I'll have to watch it next time that I'm in the event.  
---
Out of curiosity, when you checked to see that you had 1200 rounds did you look at your inventory under ammo or at the weapon?  
---
The reason why I ask is because I have both a minigun with Ultracite 5mm and one with regular 5mm (the one I use for Earl).  Last time I made ammo I started making Ultracite 5mm by mistake.  I caught it when I checked my weapon afterwards and then made a batch of regular 5mm.
---
As for lead, you do know about Lucky Hole Mine right?  Also, the new Legendary Perk cards includes one called Ammo Factory, which can add up to 150% to the ammo that you make.  With this perk and with Ammosmith you get 250%.
---
huh. would you look at that. still feels terribly op but sure, I'll take it.
---
thanks.
---
Wow this is embarrassing, hundreds of hours in and I never actually found Wallace in Harper’s Ferry. Where was he?
---
Bloody PA Heavy Gunner...with a vampiric gatling gun...solo'd my first time through, really wasn't that bad.  Just annoying that I kept having to run away from the point to boop things on the snoot.
---
Kinda been wondering if Pain Train counts as melee...might be more viable than just running up to boop.
---
Yeah, I followed Angryturtles walkthrough and now the enemies barely scratch me.  Essentially I just ignore the whole event except the checkpoints.  Just wish I hadn’t sold all those vampire heavies I had a week ago.  Time to RNG.  The robots are still not fun, I’m going to skip those when they are listed.  If we get nerfed Gutsy’s and Asstrons (I spelt it tight) should get nerfed as well
---
Wait, there's a new update?
---
Yeah, this feels like they looked at it on paper and it looked good but in practice this is a backwards step.
---
I mean it's his house, his rules.
---
They are fun but my entire full squad not getting a single reward when completing in under 7 minutes is kinda annoying
---
you think you got it bad? i was a junkies melee lol. Just switched to junkies heavy and that was much better 🤙🏻
---
It really doesn't; I just don't really get the mentality of thinking why this was a good idea.
---
I mean in the "typical" online game or whatever, new content/areas/quests/gear/etc are added for the higher level/endgame people to have new challenges to tackle. But doing it like this, what's the point? Yep....everything has a higher # next to its energy bar and it takes a lot more shots to kill. Yay? It's not like there are new areas to explore, new enemies to kill, new types of gear/armor to attain, etc.....it's just the exact same stuff but now more of a chore to do when before you could just decide to go to lower level places to scavenge for supplies, claim some workshops/do some events for daily score, etc, and now that's completely gone. 
---
I just don't see the appeal, at all.
---
Haha i didn't really think about this one time, thought I would wait until my team mate respawns before finishing Earle off so he can loot the corpse.
---
Saw him come down the mine entrance. Shoot Earle, Earle dies. Mine collapses on guy I was waiting for. 
---
-.-
---
I have Perk Load Manager, so we need to remove it. 😒
---
It was either designed to be useless intentionally or anybody who involved making and testing it are clueless. Why not adding a simple option to the not used ammo automates at train stations with a less than absolutely ripoff rates? I removed it from camp.
---
The team pvp, trap camps, all the exploits. I enjoyed the surprises. It’s like people don’t realize you can just hop servers if somethings going on that you don’t like. I never ran into any dupers but I ran into some trap camps, glitched guns and god mode in pvp. It was all good fun.
---
More Mothman stuff is always cool, but I don't know why they keep pushing Mothman stuff if they're not going to let us join or work with the faction in the game.
---
Or, they could just make it so that the weight reduction effects on your character would affect stash as well. It would be simplier.
---
just three options and you've gotta meet one of them...and yes I imagine he does change up what he says.  Called me an egghead for choosing the Intelligence option.
---
Wait did eso actually improve I might need to try this game again
---
Woohaa. This is a game changer indeed. Thanks for the information
---
Oooh! Thanks for letting me know! :D
---
Did someone say rare outfit ?
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Reclaimed\_deep\_mining\_gas\_mask](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Reclaimed_deep_mining_gas_mask)
---
I agree.  This really feels like a dev wasting time chasing "bugs" because they're easy to fix or they have some kind of personal vendetta to crush any attempt builders make to have fun. 
---
Go fix the fucking bug that kept telling me the defense fence I was trying to place "needed support" until I placed a wall under it.
---
No problem
---
It should be in the perk card menu try restarting your game or console/pc
---
wait, does it not say on the legendary perk how much it increases your stat by?
---
I think the best option was to have certain zones level with you but with a cap. So for instance, have it so that the Forest levels to your character but maxes out at lvl 20. Cranberry Bog begins leveling with you until level 50 and then most common mobs cap out at 50. Etc.
---
Exactly my thought. It's not challenging, it's tedious. I don't feel rewarded when it takes me 7-8 shots with my mostly optimized build to drop a single enemy, and there's now 20 of them swarming me and now I'm dead. It's not fun. It's not challenging. It just makes me feel useless. Seriously considering just quitting until they re-buff the damage, or nerf enemies health. Whichever. I run bloodied stealth sniper. The whole point of my build is to stealth in and one shot. What's the point, if I can't one shot ANYTHING anymore? Even basic scorched are taking me 4-5 shots. It's ridiculous.
---
Join a team (any) and begin the daily ops. It will indicate "daily ops" beside your name in the team list and hopefully the other members will come to help you. 
---
This is what worked for me. Not ideal for sure.
---
Go to perk screen, there's a tab for "legendary perks" in the top middle of the screen.
---
but what if min maxing is fun for them?
---
Its fun though
---
Raider camp - you have to be fully allied up with them to get it.  If you aren't yet, sorry about the upcoming grind...
---
lmao, I'll come back and let you know what he says when i force it out of him later. Cheers for the info.
---
He literally leaves his door open for people to come in and whip his ass but doesn't have the hospitality to leave it open after his ass has been beat? Nah bro 😂
---
The nerf was required; the performance gap between meta builds and casual builds was unfathomably vast, which makes trying to balance the game impossible.
---
In this respect is was mostly successful: Stacking damage multipliers no longer gives exponential returns.
---
The problem we face now is that enemies just have way too much health and resistances, especially at higher levels. Bullet sponges are not fun.
---
I could head shot super mutants at distance no problem but had no hope.on ghouls at close range last night I aimed for their limbs and ended up one shoting them at normal distances again.
---
I don't have any of this problem. I usually have more problem with computers around the map to be honest.
---
If the mod authors are up to date there is a oc mod that highlights the corpses its fucking awesome. Kinda looks like the PA helmet mod that highlights living targets.
---
Agreed, it would have been better on the sledgehammer.
---
You get a bit more loot but nothing you’d be upset to miss. Ammo and stuff.
---
&gt;The mire is sorely in need of some life
---
I really dig no neighbours though...
---
They are cool but I wish they where atleast interactive insted of being locked into it mindlessly. But I guess I should appreciate Bethesda even giving us this and if play had control of it who knows how many grams breaking bugs would come from it so it's probably for the best.
---
That's not a very fun solution. You need to find all the can-alarm dangly things (really just any cans) and barbells and weights to gather as much lead as possible. Also gather acid and cloth for gunpowder. Then you can make your own ammo. It's not too expensive to make 10mm or .45 ammo.
---
Do you happen to have the ammo converter? If you don't, someone near you probably does. Turn all that .38 ammo and shotgun shells into other stuff.
---
Good luck mate.
---
I love everything about this update but it’s my low level friend that’s hating the dmg nerf because everything he’s encountering is always level 50 now and he’s going thought ammo armour and weapons like crazy because all his weapons are way worse he said that his dmg has been halved even though he’s not any specific build he just lvl 50ish has some decent dmg perks and a V 25 handmade I gave him and i haven’t even taken him to the cranberry bog and he’s already running out of ammo to the point where he’s just whipped out his half broken melee weapons
---
Reddit does not appreciate anything that is against the current trend, need to stay current to get that sweet karma.
---
I say only one word. Pistols.  
---
Pistols ABSOLUTELY unplayable in this patch. Yeah, my bloodied stealth pistol kils SBQ or vendigo, but it takes at least 10 min. Now i can... I can die. or kill one oppenent and die. Then die again and again and again.  
---
You look at the top meta builds, their damage nerfs and that's good for you. And not the meta builds are in a state of collapse right now, because they cannot play at all.
---

---
Yeah I think their point is solely that there are more pressing bugs for them to patch and until Bethesda stops making huge gaffes all the time and patching harmless generally non game breaking/ruining bugs they will not be satisfied. This is probly not the worst stance to have as Ive really seen Fo76 for the last 6-12 months as a cash grab and a under supported game but thats just me. Im left floating in the void of space praying they start to make it more user friendly(less grindy) and optimize what is already there.
---
Shotguns aren't dead, just pick up a magic shotgun. Still one shot everything with right loadout
---
Does it work even if you are alone in your team?
---
They have such high perception now that you need full stealth boosts to reliably stay in caution.  Full uny suit, full shadowed mods, full sneak card, harder to detect legendary effect and the fixer stealth boost.
---
Google Nkuacrypt.com it's the same guy who runs the codes every Tuesday a few hours after the game updates it's really nice since hunting down those pesky scortched officers is a real chore it saves you the biggest headache of nuke launching. Pretty much everyone uses it.
---
Invest in the scrounger perk for ammo. I’ve had it since level 10 or so and at max rank I find ammo everywhere.
---
I mean if I invited some people over and they started attacking me but then accidentally locked themselves out I probably wouldn't let them back in either.
---
I'm half asleep fml.  I think I confused myself
---
Everything's a bullet sponge now...
---
Do you roll with any specific combo of legendarys? :) It looks fun!
---
But how to block on Reddit. Never worked that one out tbh.
---
I'm guessing this person is a bit above level 50 but less than 100. That seems to be a sweetspot of difficulty.
---
Pistols have needed help for AGES and they continue to need help. I never use my pistol character. There's tons of reasons:
---
All those pistol perks being in agility means you miss out on good agility damage talents
---
Crits just aren't that good
---
Lack of silenced gunslinger pistols
---
Brutal ranged damage dropoff
---
Yes, but not doing enough DMG
---
Joined with a bunch of randoms and beat it in 7:54 first try :D. I'm a melee build, so that helped but the others just got them down to one hit with their flamers.
---
I also got the burrows signs plan too, yheet
---
Chillin on the northern end amongst the ghoul orgy.
---
My son was in the middle of a DO today and he couldn’t kill them. I hadn’t played the update yet and just said, “server must be busted.” Now I can go yell at him to read the rules before he plays a game!!
---
There are two kinds of people here.
---
A) Those who were running builds with automatic weapons.
---
B) Everyone else.
---
If you were running a build with an automatic weapon, congratulations! Your damage output is largely unchanged.
---
If you were anyone else, your build is now garbage and the game is frustrating and painful as a result.
---
Worth even less now the enemies attacking them are all level 50+.
---
I voted for "Bethesda removed my camp but I didn't do anything"
---
what took you so long  ?
---
I did it in 5 minutes  first time around.
---
You have to have melee equipt for it to work.
---
Yes, yes, yes, daddy likes!
---
I just brought along my two lvl 50 melee friends to finish everything off it’s leveling the up decent amounts too😂
---
Can't really close a door when your dead though 
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Got elder after the second run. First run was 8:01. Not really that hard tbh just stack up on stims
---
Yea sounds good. 100% certain as it was a nuke minigun they are small since it's just the back half of a minigun with a tiny mirv barrel pasted on the front of it. Shoots pairs of mininukes at 20 a second it's madness.
---
Hot damn!
---
Thank you vault dwellers, I'll have to look after work. I appreciate your time in this.
---
outside PA it is not procing for me, usually a noise and a pip boy swaying left to right will show up when it does. Nada for me
---
But don't they follow you to the final Boss? They did for me, I had to kill dozens of them even when I got to the final room, or is that a finite number after the last device syncs, idk still confused.
---
Was slinging boxes into trailers tonight. Been poking around in the game now that I'm home.
---
Pretty swank so far.
---
Not gonna lie I’m still burnt out from last season I logged onto 76 for the score grind and just didn’t care about this season like nothing pops out to me other than the BoS field station and bench press
---
Lol - i just ran it with a bloodied melee weapon and one shot all enemies. No reason to even use a gun in ops - has to be a melee hit to kill.
---
I'm not the level 23 dude, the OP is.
---
during one of the earlier seasons there were weapons you could get from progressing through that particular season on NW
---
No, but it has a *scrip* machine
---
Only thing wrong with this update is lower levels never getting a break
---
No worries man.  Maybe try getting some sleep!
---
Exactly same for me.
---
I thought it was me. Overnight it seems I went through weeks of ammo.  
---
I burned out today, frustrated, wondering how things could go so wrong. Returning player, level 36 today. Once I hit 35, my lack of specialization seemed to make all my weapons perform poorly.
---
I play rifleman, try again. That said, what stops people from allocating two different weapon types? I use heavy guns and rifleman, though I have no issues going rifleman whenever. I kill stuff almost as quick. I do think bolt action weapons are in for a buff.
---
I guess events that were designed as events with certain levels and were balanced due to these levels now can be sooooo god damn broken. You mentioned the campfire stories and the only thing I am thinking about is how the Project Paradise suppose to be running now?! Have anyone tried it already?
---
Not really, I could go without legendaries since this is a build designed to tank damage and heal my teammates. I usually run troubleshooter's armor tho, makes the gutsy's less scary
---
I don't know dates but all I know is I want plushie
---
I'm 19... 19 enemies wreck me and I barely scratch them.
---
Other than low levels my friends haven’t had a break from just wandering in the forest and the dmg nerf somehow hit them harder than my B HG build
---
Same. I did it but it was not fun. I have mods too and had the issue. Enemies spawning out of mid air. A final boss that takes like 0.5% damage with each hit (bloodied 3 star powerfist). No idea what I got. Felt like I wasted 20 minutes of my night.
---
Yeah, they basically made my character near useless. None of my weapons can do more than scratch the enemies anymore, aside from the power fist I have. My wife and I were both fighting the same enemies, and she was lower level and doing far more damage than I was with higher level guns.
---
I wouldn't hate having to use the power fist for everything if it actually worked all the time, but half the time it does a half punch animation and then does nothing. As of today my guns are effectively useless, I am taking far more damage than ever before, I have gone through more ammunition and healing supplies than ever before. The cost/reward just feels not worth it anymore.
---
Sure. Get on the horn to Sony and Microsoft to let them know to get on this right away so all the frequent updates required isn't going to cost and arm and a leg.
---
I see! Thanks for sharing!
---
I want to make it work so bad. I collected some exeptional rifles over time, one of them must bring it. Instigating doesn't cut it anymore tho. Best results i had with some BE rifles. But for a guaranteed oneshot i have to use legacy.
---
Have not been able to play yet but hopefully its fun.
---
I ran there to escape warden bots. Then found a cluster of mirelurks. Freaking bugles blarring as my no stimpack having self yeets away.
---
I got it and got one rank but haven’t gotten to use it because I’m still testing my electrical absorption perk and how op it is 😂
---
Where do you find it, is it a plan? I’m assuming it is, sorry for asking a stupid question.
---
Did you hear about balance. I mean using perks for dmg and carry weight at the same time?
---
I've never seen anyone mention this, but the enclave under-armor clips through the impostor sheepsquach outfit.
---
Oh damn, that's quite a profit!
---
Is this lazy difficulty like with point lookout in FO3? Please say no, please.
---
Yeah I’m probably not gonna be as invested as last time it’s just not as hyped as the last one and the legendary run still has me burnt out
---
Mine was 18gb on steam :o
---
So, zero blame for the dupers that pushed Bethesda into this less than ideal solution?
---
Apologies if my chiming in comes off as rude, but I'm very interested in that outfit as well. The plans I have are all the Wendigo Colossus camp items (heads, plushie, rug), the Brahmin Grill, the Fixer, gauss rifle, shishkebab and grape mentats :)
---
Get yourself instigating gauss, or explosive perk to buff explosive damage of gauss, with twoshot it should be nice
---
Huh, weird, I'm on Xbox and I only have it through game pass if that might be the difference but idk
---
I'm lvl 90 and it's only a couple extra bullets for me, it's really not that bad.
---
On it.  Have a good one.
---
That doesnt stop it dropping does it?
---
You can do it easily solo, just under the 16min mark which is what they stated they also said they recommend at least one teammate and everyone at level 50 or higher.
---
There’s your first mistake looting, as far as I can tell the enemies are infinite. The idea is to run to each checkpoint cap it and move to the final area where there are a spawn of enemies which you a required to kill in order to spawn in the boss.
---
This would also explain why your are going through your armor/weapon and ammo so quickly.
---
Now before you complain that’s not how “you want to play” we the player have to learn how to play based on the rules set within game. If you chose to play different that fine just don’t complain when it doesn’t work, you only have yourself to blame.
---
As a 50 cal user u get alot but not tons apon tons so its kinda fair I guess
---
I did an op solo, took me 20 odd minutes. I was up against robots. I felt the experience was a little bugged cause i swear i was getting melee hit from thin air or somsthing kr getting shot through walls. But anyway i did read that the enemies would only die from melee hits so i used my explosive handmade, gauss shotty and to finish them my Unholy Monster deathclaw guantlet i had from the old survival challenges. 
---
Bethesda, fix that annoying Mister Gutsy that shoots you with a projectile weapon that seems to ignore all your DR, i keep getting one shotted by that thing even when my health is at 30-40% (bloodied build)
---
I’ll have to run it and see.
---
Finally I reason to use my strangler other than drip 😂
---
.... happy for you, but they should make pails and presents expire like food does.
---
I had a bunch of lvl 100 mole rats visiting my camp. Not a big deal actually.
---
Ohh yeah that's a good point. Could be build size differences. They vary from platform to platform. But that is a pretty chunky update!
---
If you're using one of the meta legendary weapons, it doesn't really count.
---
Take a non-legendary hunting rifle or a handmade out for a spin and then get back to me.
---
Daily ops holy shit is fun fun fun! The burrows isnt to bad getting elder is very challenging though as you basically have to hug the uplink so it finishes the fastest and just let the robots hit you and you just have to keep healing and haul ass when it's done. Done this about 10 times and I could only get elder twice my 5th try was 7 minutes 57 seconds and my 8th try was 7 minutes 59 seconds so yes it's definitely no cake walk. I seem to be able to hit 8 - 9 minuets pretty often. I just want that damn deseas cure chamber, the large nuclear reactor is cool looking but damn it's massive players don't have nearly enough camp budget to make that monster fit in. I honestly would like to see a fusion generator that's 1/2 as big that be nice. I almost guarantee this is what the power armor display frame will be locked behind just seems fitting.
---
Do you have sneak perk and escape artist? Im not talking about daily ops, stealth dont work there
---
I legit got 5000 5mm from Gatling gun
---
Patch 22 introduces lvl sync and the way the lvl sync works in the game are within lvl range area.. so at lvl20 you should be playing in the area your range..  
---
Lvl20 in a range market to lvl50... your ganna have a real hard time if you playing alone
---
Good news! PLM just updated and is now compatible!
---
Power armor does work well with bloodied but not with rifles, since you should sneak with them.
---
No-PA Bloodied: [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=2f243ff&amp;d=pg2ph2pi2pp2p02e31cu2ce0ir2s01lk2a04ar2an2a51ao0a30la2l12lu2l71xm3xl3lv0&amp;m=051c2f7ba&amp;am=1827-1827-1827-1827-1827&amp;wp=w6&amp;wm=14&amp;n=Bloodied%20Full%20Damage](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=2f243ff&amp;d=pg2ph2pi2pp2p02e31cu2ce0ir2s01lk2a04ar2an2a51ao0a30la2l12lu2l71xm3xl3lv0&amp;m=051c2f7ba&amp;am=1827-1827-1827-1827-1827&amp;wp=w6&amp;wm=14&amp;n=Bloodied%20Full%20Damage)
---
You can allocate the rest of the legendary perks however you like.
---
Wait is it a 2* or 3*?
---
Yes almost half the size of the game  on Xbox lol
---
What economy are you talking about?? It won't return unless all the megadupers Flux and junk accounts get emptied.
---
I like suggesting new ideas and then letting Bethesda decide if theyre FO1st or Atom store. Like, why not just suggest an ammo box?
---
I mean. They can’t balance stealth. So they just disable it. 
---
When you can solo entire bosses without leaving stealth... that’s kind of a balance problem. Hell basically no other MMO allows you to stay in stealth during combat, because you can’t really balance that.
---
Your best bet is take a workshop with a junk pile. I like the Gorge Junkyard personally as its right near my Camp.  It has:  [Concrete](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Concrete_(Fallout_76))(1), junk(1), [Black titanium](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Black_titanium) (1), [Wood](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wood_(Fallout_76))(1), Food(5), Water(3).  Good for repair PA, getting the scraps you need and is easy to defend with  turrets on the containers or a tower build. Have your Collectron set to pick up scrap or ammo which ever your more in need of.  Spend a couple hours on the game and farm it every 20-30 minutes while doing your day to day stuff.
---
I mean it’s great for those that never explored or didn’t get the chance to explore (new players) but to me it really didn’t feel like it had that vault diving magic.
---
I’ll give it another go on my explorer character which I use to search every nook and cranny to see if my mind changes.
---
I am also hyped about Patch 22! I’m enjoying Daily Ops, and especially the Resilient enemies — I finally feel like my melee character is useful to others in group events. 
---
One Wasteland is going to take some getting used to. I was floored when I took my lvl 156 character to Path to Enlightenment and saw those lvl 50 radtoads! Definitely did a double take and thought “this was a bad day to have not fixed my armor.” I was similarly faced with new challenges when I did Leader of the Pack. These events aren’t ridiculously easy anymore, which is kind of nice. Will taking some getting used to, but so far, I’m happy to have a little bit more of a fight during these kind of events. I will say, though, that I’m concerned about leveling up my little alt on my other account. One Wasteland has probably made that harder.
---
Ahh. What was different about them?
---
I think I came across this also once. Lots of glowing radstags if I recall.
---
I'm literally having no problem with this update and I use mutant guns.
---
I think it just shifted it to other players. 
---
No joke, I've been playing daily for 4 months and never once had issue with fast travel until today. Now it dumps me out of the map without actually doing anything 2 or 3 times before it works. I'm guessing that is the way the bug worked for others and isn't brand new.
---
My local lumber yard is my new favorite place :) Life isn't always about FO76...sometimes it's about finding an alternative to the shit lumber Home Depot sells that looks like every piece fell off a truck &gt;\_&lt;
---
(Okay fine, most of the plywood is probably okay--still expensive though)
---
It's not very fulfilling to die over and over again while waiting for other people to join the event. So rather than just joining the event solo and hoping for the best, many people wait for confirmation that another teammate is actually going to show up. Exa: getting on the mic &amp; saying that you are ready, showing up wherever they are on the map &amp; waving hello, etc.
---
Gave it a shot solo. I finished and it only took me 37 minutes. It was a riot and indied a bunch but I had fun trying. 
---
 There seemed to be some slight bugs where I couldn't bash or stimpak unless I opened and closed the pip boy, I might have finished in a more respectable time if that was not an issue but I'm sure it will get worked out.
---
Definitely a group activity lol
---
Some of us were getting excited to finally be able to explore places like the Mire without issue, and getting excited to find a few challenging enemies walking around the Forests every once in a while.  
---
Now at level 50 I feel like the high level area haven't changed at all and the low level areas are on the same difficulty as late game areas.
---
My B Rifleman hasn't seen much change, I'm still one shoting mods in sneak and "magic" weapons are still viable, so my 2nd character who is a Junkie's Shotgunner is actually doing a lot of work.
---
I'm gonna level my Ranger to 400 and my Raider to 300 and then make a 3rd Berzerkers Sneak Commando.
---
Well, as a level 23 that's very discouraging as I was looking forward to level 50... My ammo and resources took a massive hit today. Difficulty hasn't been the issue, it's actually nice to feel threatened while exploring, but maintaining everything has been rough. I'm out of lead screws and adhesive after one day, when I was slowly increasing my stocks previously. Makes me feel like the grind to sustainability is going to be absurdly long.
---
And how much bethesda haters pay you to make hate comments? Or it doesn't work both ways?
---
Good Lord, that is crazy lol. Hopefully some future compression or something, but best of luck!
---
I’m all for bringing classic enemy’s into the game.
---
#GitGud
---
I got lucky with my Secret Service armour - 2 reduced weapon weight pieces. (Edited to not sound like a Nazi)
---
Yep, Level 115 and got my ass handed to me repeatedly in Cranberry Bog. Abandoned Bog Town had a level 100 Ancient Bohemoth and two 3 star Level 75 Super Mutant Champions with miniguns, and an assortment of others. And an Insult Bot.
---
wait how do i get these rewards lol? is finding the mole miners just random
---
lol ok...great come back!
---
Yeah lol, thank you, good luck to you too!
---
This happened to my wife in the same spot but before the patch and only rad stags. Even after she left they kept spawning.
---
My pump gun breaks before I finish off a same level enemy.
---
Same. I might have pooped myself.
---
Who knows? Microsoft is already giving us Xbox and Pc shared game pass and in November we will get EA play for no additional cost.
---
So... Have you tried the Tank Killer perk lately? How about Modern Renegade?
---
Yeah all my work benches are more than half in the wall now I'm just not a deal with it for a while
---
I’m talking my level 50 friend who’s constantly getting hit with enemies his level on top of having his dmg cut in half and he’s not even meta he’s just using two perks of riflemen and a V 25 handmade and he told me half his dmg is gone so he’s just using melee now all low levels are going to have a worse time because of the scaling but the nerfs making it worse for some of them
---
I tried this approach. Lasted about 5 seconds.
---
Starting to think Stealth is totally broken.
---
I plodded along, struggling with every second shot regenerating Gutsies health .Melee connecting only every 3,4, shots,and quick using Stimpack working only [occasionally.It](https://occasionally.It) was a nightmare.
---
I gave up swapping my Heavy weapon for a Pole Hook and just used the Pole Hook.I went through like 60 Stimpacks.
---
Weirdly The event left me with 49 Super Stimpacks,that weigh like 1 ilb each.
---
Why is it they never get used when you atou stim,so annoying.
---
I sell these.
---
Won't happen, they gain enough data from the PC one and it would be problematic with Sony and Microsoft to do one
---
Do you really expect them to fix any bug which let you have free atoms?? Lol
---
Yh I read this did it worked sorry I'm an absolute idiot
---
It's not that bad at all.
---
Valid point well made. I'm not experienced enough with the game to understand your comments re chem buffs, mutations etc. But did wonder why I'd seen videos on YouTube where players were engaging why low on health. Will investigate it more.
---
For god knows what reason when you're scrapping multiple copies of a card after scrapping one copy the remaining animated and non animated cards can swap places.  I ended up doing it once, luckily with a useless Lead Belly card at least.  You just have to go slowly so you can stop yourself if they do flip.
---
Yeah, before the update I was able to solo Uranium fever with a low damage weapon. But I tried it post update and I was getting demolished even with 4 other people doing the event. Most of us had some form of full auto handmade. I’ve been using the chinese stealth armor to capitalize on my sneaky commando build, but that armor needed too much to repair it with what was an already fragile lifespan, now it’s more of a chore to repair and it was crucial for a build I thoroughly enjoy. I don’t like being a tank and with the bug I’m dealing with for PA not boosting my strength makes me not want to use PA unless I know for sure I won’t have to worry about being overencunbered because of a fully upgraded rifle. But now everything is heavily reliant on tank builds or avoiding enemies completely. If I even fight I go through a couple hundred rounds of 5.56 from my handmade in what was an easy encounter in the past. And to clarify Im like level 80 something.
---
I had that issue. Mostly when they had a tiny sliver of health left. Grognak’s Axe right on them and it took over 5 swings.
---
Level 19, my booty getting bopped.
---
Those times... My god... Don't want to remember that...
---
Hysterical overuse of Resilient for Ops was totally expected, but the enemy level matching is on first impressions solid. Will probably get tired of it soon for this reason - essentially in the lower or eastern sections of the map, heavy, high ammo capacity weapons are required. You burn through ammo and stimpaks, but you can usually retreat to the northwest to gather supplies and craft more ammo and replenish  stims, clearing out lower level enemies with secondary  weapons that use otherwise useless .44, .45, 5.56, .38, .308 or 10mm ammo. Gives a reason to experiment with these other neglected weapons. If all enemies everywhere scale to the player, making your Heavy go-to the weapon of choice everywhere, then it makes all of those smaller caliber, smaller damage and smaller capacity weapons useless.
---
Thats not what they mean. Every game update on a console has to be approved by Sony and Microsoft, and they don't do those approvals daily. It isn't practical to update regularly on console. They don't even do it on steam.
---
I mean you can play the game casually but like Bethesda has got to make money some how
---
Yeah, they should definitely bring that one back!
---
So what the hell are they for? I was about to do the same.
---
Not at all
---
Their fault for duping being possible. Not condoning it, but the dupers aren't the ones at fault for limitations.
---
You can run back down to his body by going in the way you escape. Youll die down there but who cares. Its annoying to have to do but you have the option.
---
Bloodied builds are the best option now IMO, it saves ammo too.
---
Can you store them on other chars like that or you earned them on that char?
---
Bloodied. More damage under 20% health but also the perk radicool, you do more damage the higher your rads
---
Use fed76 to gauge a legendary items worth. Scrip/sell the garbage.
---
If you don’t know, make sure you go into component view from your junk pip boy menu, and tag screws, adhesive etc. The game will put a magnifying glass icon on every item name you find that has one of those. You’ll be swimming in them in no time if you put in the effort to hunt for them, you’ll find lots of screws in items in office buildings etc.
---
Here’s a guide to places you can farm:
---
https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic#h.p14wcsgx9tkk
---
If I'm getting this correctly... you have have quick switched with a heavy weapon which is a glitch. Thats if you have a heavy weapon.
---
How is making areas not relevant anymore due to being low level, over half the map shitty? Like seriously how dumb is that? like you go "ok your endgame is now half the map probably less?" thats bad.
---
It allows greater multiplayer possibilities. 
---
Now now before you say "well levels mean nothing now" well no duh its not. higher levels have access to so much more than lower levels utility perks, modifier perks. And gear with more modifiers. So a higher level player will always preform over a lower level player (unless its a really really poorly designed character or some extreme example)
---
The only real downside is well everywhere is challenging now, but thats a good thing to many people.  I get it though, ill miss equiping my pipe auto rifle to farm scrap in the forest to burn up my worthless 38 ammo.
---
Times change, now i can revert my 38 ammo into more useful ammo. Now i can explore the forest at high level and have a rewarding experience gameplay wise. 
---
What is the downside?
---
granted theres some issues they missed like huge packs of leveled mole rats are more deadly then they should be.
---
At level 50 you dont really have the gear you need to make life easier. I had to search and buy for my weapons, I paid 15k for a Junkies/25 Gatling Laser. You just gotta build up your class. Looks like your friend is trying to dip their toes into both commando and rifleman, should really stick to one.
---
Any tips on getting the instagating Gauss? Most places I see online for trading have some pretty steep prices.
---
Also the process costs Bethesda money each time they try to push an update. No such bottleneck with PC. It happens when they want to or need to.
---
Plus, as an aside, another 70-80GB of storage to be taken up on your console... PTS is a separate install.
---
It is full with lvl100 mirelurks but they are in small numbers and super slow. Nowhere as intensive as old DitW raid was. The tunnels have been removed (walled up)
---
Sorry if that's a joke and I just don't get it. Has that thing been fixed?
---
Seriously thinking of uninstalling this game.
---
Earned them on that character, can't transfer them.
---
Game should have somewhat of a challenge tho, its a harsh wasteland, not some Disneyland. I remember dying from lvl1 radroaches in the vault during my fallout 4 survival play
---
Omg I hadn’t thought of that!
---
I have access to a legendary perk but im worried about picking the explosive perk for this very reason lmao
---
First two runs I went in with the camouflage suit and a combat shotgun and a scout knife. Needless to say it wasn't pretty.
---
Next run, Power Armour and a much better weapon, but didn't realise that they spawned indefinitely, so spent 10 minutes at the entrance killing everything that came along. When it finally dawned on me, I just ignored everything and ran to the objectives.
---
That worked much better. But then it wouldn't let me use stimpaks, cue the new update...Fallout 76 - Dark Souls Edition.
---
Finally finished it, and couldn't wait to go back through the rooms to pick up all the....oh wait it's kicked me straight out. That bit REALLY annoyed me.
---
What? I'm unyielding ninja as well and I'm sneaking just fine. Maybe try un-equipping and re-equipping your sneak cards. At most I've noticed I have to hit an enemy an extra time.
---
Yup smart. Blame the premises for being robbed.
---
\#5, maybe? I made 5 ranks today, and I was able to claim it along with a stash box, some health stuff, and...something... It was before I slept (I work nights) and I don't remember.
---
Yes I've seen this at the Colonel Kelly Monument a bunch of times. 
---
I always want to say 'We have the meats' when I'm blowing them up.
---
Yup
---
Edit: wtf Bethesda
---
Gonna piss people off saying this but... Why did Bethesda listen to a bunch of lifers in test servers and not an actual test group? Feels like a bunch of god mode masochist green lit this.
---
Same!
---
Dude, games aren't the same as real life. If they're built right, it shouldn't be possible to duplicate things. If it is, thats the fault if shoddy workmanship by Bethesda, and legitimate playes shouldn't be punished for that failure.
---
Craft healing salve, just run around Flatwoods picking flowers with double herbs perk. They worth it
---
Or you could just avoid jumping into the fray and not ever need to worry that much about armour degradation.
---
Game hasn't changed so much that we're now in a tank build meta.
---
I’m thinking about quitting unless they fix this. It’s a shame; I was excited for the new season.
---
you could use fed76.com/pricing to get a vague idea, of whats worthy and whats scrip.   
---
also, ask yourself why you keep stuff. if you found it months ago and never touched it again, get rid of it.
---
Yeah you say that but I get lost every time I try and get anywhere in that place haha
---
Oh yeah, having 5 legendary attribute perks maxed and infiltrator is the best, I have so many perk options now. My perk list is so clean now, only the ones I regularly use, quick swapping, it's great.
---
Ok I’ve also been thinking about using Gauss guns instead. Would that be better?
---
Kinda afraid to do Campfire Tales now...
---
Someone isn’t running woodchucker...
---
Useless cards should be redeemable for caps.
---
The problem is the game being on Xbox game pass so there will obviously be new players and their experience with the game might be constantly hard enemies and just low dmg weapons for how hard the enemies are hitting I think Bethesda should make it like it used to be for ppl under level 50 where you can find enemies under and above your level not just your level or above because at level 50 you can actually get good gear and actually get good dmg/builds but under level 50 you can’t even get the best guns or all the perks and they just throw them into the mix with everyone else
---
Wallace is now at the Berkley Springs train station if I’m not mistaken. :) He has taken up residence where the Purveyor was before she made her move to the Rusty Pick.
---
yes
---
&gt; If they're built right, it shouldn't be possible to duplicate things. 
---
Ah. Sure bud. All you need to do is build it right and all systems are hack and exploit proof...
---
Really? That's your take?
---
Do you want a redo and start over? This is kind of embarrassing.
---
Damn was really hoping for the Red Viper handmade because, both the Tropic lightning and the Screaming Eagle skins suffer from multiple bugs and other clipping issues. + I just like the look of the simple red handmade.
---
Thank you for your wallets sacrifice. Bringing us this knowledge.
---
Something up with adrenaline also, I have demolition maxed out and not much of a difference than without it equipped, same goes for adrenaline atleast that's what it seems to me.
---
Most mmo have it for monetary reason. It is there now to try push people to fallout first
---
I'm sorry that you are getting rubbed raw. Fallout 4, 3 and NV are great games to pickup on sale.
---
76... Is really taking the steam out of my boat on future bethesda games. Think their gold age ended.
---
Preciate it.
---
Dont say everyone and 10x, which is not true.
---
Yea I agree... I fell like it has to be a eff up, why would this tropic thunder skin be apart of the season and not the crimson viper skin yes know? Knowing Bethesda I wouldn’t be surprised if they put the wrong skin in it lol
---
You mean the gauss minigun?
---
No. You definitely aren’t, *especially* as one of the ops specifically requires a melee hit to kill the little cunts. This damage nerf is a load of complete and utter shit. It took me 27 rounds to put down a Yao Guai today. Compared to 4 yesterday. Put it back to how it was!
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f335e88&amp;d=s01sq2s22sx0s32sr2pe2eh2cu0ic4s12ip2id2s72a04l71lt2c62ce0lu2x10x30x83xj3xp3xq2&amp;w=l21ls2&amp;m=1c2fe7b3&amp;ad=03458
---
There's my full health pa heavy gunner build. I run vamps most of the time and j for big fights. Been using it (with a few changes) for 200+ levels now.
---
 I'm not really feeling the nerf at all. Things might take half a second longer to kill I guess haha
---
Yeah or shotgun/pistol?
---
Maybe it was just Ward taking back his property
---
I’m not excited about Daily Ops considering I’m a pretty fleshy thing with leather armor and full health. Using an instigating hunting rifle and stealth as my main method of killing. I wish the perceptive perk wouldn’t have completely destroyed stealth and instead made it a certain radius within an enemy that would cause you to get detected faster, a larger one that will put you in CAUTION instead of constantly being in DANGER.
---
When ive a bugged quest, i go n advance or complete other quests n that ususally fixes it.
---
Hack and exploit proof? Of course not. But normal MMOs don't have dupe problems so bad that it forces them to kneecap the trade system. I'm not asking them to do the impossible, just meet the standards their peers have set.
---
No it is not obviously a team event.
---
There was no warning that i needed to be in a team.
---
And reading the comments confirms this.
---
It seems that being Solo,or in a team has no bearing.Reason being the best approach is to avoid conflict if possible and get through as fast as possible.
---
Usually it does (unless the patch changed something). It's how I complete all the "repair weapons" dailies, and did that repair crossbows for the archery badge.
---
After doing a few more daily ops this evening I'm beginning to realize just how rare this item could be 😬😳😶 
---
And I have all those plans...😕
---
I'm getting there. I'm a bitch for builds (D3 seasons junkie) but the early game is bit miffed.
---
I know man when they announced the system they mention it was base off eso champions points.... and I expected we earn perk coin with exp and upgrade our legendary perk BUT NOOOOO
---
They did this weird system that ain’t apt friendly 
---
I just scrap 95% of my perks.. so I’m committed to my character build now , if I wanna play a different build then I’ll have to make an alt which would be fine... if I could equip my 6 rank4 legendary perks
---
If you love PA then the shotgun or the minigun are your best bet. Pistols still suck, so don't use them.
---
I use tank killer now, but have no place for Renegade - unforetunately, all free agi perks takes pistol damage and adrenaline
---
I’m wondering if it‘s the crops - only because I noticed I’m getting x2 yields picking them sometimes which I hadn’t before. But, I don’t really want to delete my camp one piece at a time to test the theory.
---
&gt; It really didn't help that all the enemies spawn under your feet when gathering kindling.
---
Don't touch the 'wet' kindling and they shouldn't.
---
Thank you. Any specific sites to go to for builds? I've seen a lot of stuff that might be out of date.
---
I had to increase my DR from 430 to 709 on my secret service armor so I don't die so easily anymore lol I love the challenge.
---
Could they not make another vendor 𝐅or Pete’s sake!
---
PC :( Thank you anyway, though.
---
There's a great reason actually.
---
The reason why we have unlimited scrap boxes is because the server can track 1000 steel the same as tracking 1 steel (steel =1 or steel =1000) but most items that go into the stash, like 5 shotguns for example, will have to be tracked separately because of item condition along with mods installed. The server is already struggling and adding another 50 items, or however much, per player would decrease server stability that much more. 
---
Yes I know things like chems and what not can be tracked like scrap, but not everything that goes into the stash box can be, and this is the reason
---
Fallout is a wonderful game, I love the world and I had so much fun with it. I thought the colossus event was great, and I love all the festivals and quirks of the game. But I am feeling bitter about fallout at the moment. 
---
I understand the game needs to be hard and the level up of enemies. But what do I do with my bloodied comando character. I feel it is impossible to do Daily ops with my level 370 character. She dies all the time, it is boring. If they don’t do damage at least let them have a strong stealth or some sort of protection. I thought the trade off for being low health and vulnerable, is to do high damage, now I just die a lot 🤯 tell me what is the benefit? 
---
Also I love building, but I feel like I have a legacy camp, since you can’t have double walls anymore. So many things to fix, and u fix things we actually like. Can I please apply wall paper to both sides of my walls?!? I don’t want to have a brick wall in bedroom. 
---
If u are adding a new generator to the game, make more useful then the last one, not the same energy. Same for other items, why the chicken coop does not give u food? I don’t want more fertiliser 😭 why the ammo machine and converter does not give you ultracite bullets. 🥺
---
Can you please rethink some of it?
---
I know dude. 
---
Hopefully we can get a response from Bethesda at some point.
---
I burned through about 600 rounds in regular play (normally that’d be like 250/300), then did 3 daily ops. Now I have more ammo than I started with.
---
Exactly, now it’s even more difficult for low levels to do anything worthwhile by themselves. And I can’t toss around in the forest to relax anymore because everything is scaled to my level. This patch is a load of shit.
---
Sorry :(
---
Shits fucked, boss. Subs gaining water. The chef doused the beans in laxative and all the men had three helpings.
---
Fittingly, vault 94 reopened at the same time as this indirect buff to the armor occurred.
---
I honestly am loving the changes. I havent had one lv35 pickaxe since. 
---
I like that its a little harder - but i still ran a train through whitesprings and it felt fine. 
---
Then downed a lv100 grafton solo but it actually took a teeny thought and attention. 
---
Sorry to disagree but if all legendary pickups are now max level its a price i am happy to pay.
---
Im doing fine with my *food* build, with all weight perks (except armor and shotguns). I was using 1st rand of damage perks and blood mess all the time. Dont forget 2 legendary perks for 40% damage each maxed.
---
I’m going to to chill in a corner and make my teammates try and fun me 😂😂
---
It won’t be if somebody put in the time to lvl up alts to “cheese” the system. They earn the right to it because the time investment was put on it..
---
It doesn’t matter if player A has lvl300 Or player B has two lvl150 characters. At the end of the day it the same amount of grind put into the game
---
Very strange, already tried removing the perk card and equipping it again? Did ops solo last night and serendipity basically carried me the whole time
---
It affects them to my deathclaw went to 50
---
...or I can just hop into my PA and crouch with a vampire weapon until the thing is done linking or whatever.
---
Eh exploits just make griefing easy
---
So they can see what problems the community has with it and what changes they should add.But i think they could have done that on the PTS.
---
it's almost like the game was way too easy.
---
Now its highest risk, minimal damage output, most of your ammo and no reward. ;)
---
I have been using that for a while. It is a good one to have
---
Yeah this update sucks seriously.. I'm a bloodied stealth commando here with a b2525 fixer and im still being detected very easily with muffled and shadowed on both limbs? Along with escape artist and 2* sneak equipped. My weapon was doing around 360? Now I'm down to 170 there's standard guns out there that hit that hard 😂 or close to it.
---
Is your weapon and armor level 20?
---
Only a small amount of player will ever accomplish that , lvling alt or not
---
&gt; but I just can’t understand why anyone would completely overhaul damage calculations for a blanket loss in performance while simultaneously increasing enemy strength across the board
---
I have a strong suspicion that this change was made in order to bring 5 star legendaries on line down the road.
---
LOL.  I actually checked on my 2nd character to make sure it was gone BEFORE I talked to Ward, and yeah, gone. Grabbed another from the stash, talked to Ward, quest completed, still have it. I wonder if they still spawn in the wild, I'll have to check that.
---
Its much easier for me to find trouble now lol.
---
&gt; As a non-bloodied stealth vats sniper 
---
So what? You can see what's waiting for you before you go in. Eagle eye negates stealth.  That was clear to me before even launching the game today. And resilient is a love letter to anyone playing melee.
---
Don't you get more experience for killing them since they are higher level? Isn't the purpose of this to make things less of a grind?
---
I think they need to look at lesser enemies and make an exception. However if the game rolls a legendary they obviously need to scale up. I have noticed that despite their level bump radroaches or mole rats are still quite easy to kill.
---
Overall it’s a small price to pay for not having to worry about low level legendary loot. I for one think One Wasteland was one of the best things the devs have done. Makes the game as a whole a lot more relevant rather than being pigeonholed into 2 zones.
---
And here i was being annoyed at the wrong form and lifting momentum of the animation
---
You can, just need to use some brains
---

---
Here's a bloodied heavy build. You need to use emergency protocols as the torso mod to reduce damage by 50%.
---
Still one shot kill a 100lvl super mutant with bloodied rifle build, so it's not that harsh what you said.
---
I still manage to one shot the super mutants in west tek with my instigating lever and optimized rifleman full health build
---
I’m fine with people playing how they want to play but don’t complain about the game when it’s your decisions making something more difficult or impossible.
---
No point trying to give them advice, it’s 2020 people don’t want to fix problems they just want to be able to bitch about something.
---
It's not because the higher levels take more exp to get.
---
I got lucky at the end.
---
i was mob killed by Gutsies.
---
Then I was re-spawned at the top of the walkway in the Office where i hammered the Boss with a Heavy 50 Cal weapon and backed off in to the office when he let rip with the laser.
---
When it had a slither of life left.
---
I jumped down and belted it over the Head with a Pole Hook.
---
Not sure i will be doing it again any time soon though.Stim packs were obliterated,definitely not for bloodied builds.
---
Yeah but if you have to respec to do it then your losing out on legendary perk coins, maybe I should have clarified that.
---
Like I said it doesn’t matter
---
It's called sarcasm.
---
Just ran the ops with each of my characters. None of which are overpowered. But all have a few perks in melee. 
---
I found it ok. Was abit of a challenge but nothing crazy. And was usually only with 1 other player
---
Any recommendations of other games?
---
So true bwhaaaaaaaaaaaa.
---
Lmao that this is already getting downvoted. Unbelievable.
---
What’s the easiest way to get a bloodied gauss minigun and shotgun?
---
Wait, you’re complaining about fighting things your level??? XP is also scaled up, I fail to see the downside.
---
Wait, how so? I know about chinese bots production restarted by enclave, but where did yoy find it about sm and especially sb?
---
I thought priming weapons boosted damage against scorched but weakened it against everything else?
---
I can level up faster and makes encounters not shooting fish in a barrel anymore.  So I like it.
---
you dont need specific weapon. With PA and all defense cards you cant die and use few stimpacks in whole event.
---
Nope, not really.  I generally agree with you.
---
My thoughts exactly xD
---
You can see what's waiting for you. It was pretty clear to me before even entering the event that eagle eye negates stealth.
---
Oh noes! You can't stealth-cheese your way through soloing it. Big whoop. One build shouldn't be excellent for every single situation.
---
I have five as well. My main is a PA rifleman who just got sneak peek with legendary agility. I’ve only had trouble once because I decided to walk into a group of level 75 mirelurks without my armor on.
---
In terms of damage, I haven’t noticed much of a difference. If anything, the legendary perks have made my life easier.
---
Ah. Yes, you lose out on some, but eventually it's definitely worth it.
---
But legendary modules and craft. It's (sadly) all RNG
---
Nice nice I was thinking about trying it out. I have not used a shotty in ages lol
---
Well if one guy who absolutely refuses to put their valuable away causes police to force a curfew on the rest of the city, yeah fucl that guy for getting robbed for not taking even the. are my imim of self awareness.
---
I can't see why you enjoy that then 😂
---
I use my camera to find em. Its not perfect but better than nothing
---
You are *technically* correct...
---
I don’t like using power armor. My dr is 504 er is 459.
---
Does it still shred pretty good atleast?
---
I liked to just travel to the forest, just to walk around for the scenery and to relax.
---
I think the generator variant unlocks with the windmill generator plan...till then you’re stuck using the decor variant
---
Also I like the change too
---
Lvl 260+ stealth commando build here. Took out my be25 fixer and could barely shoot a lvl 75 sb down.
---
I see it all the time as that’s where my camp is, but the levels you mentioned are much higher now.  As are the numbers you mentioned. If this is how the game’s going to be they need to slow the rate of weapons breaking and make more ammo available. I got my ass kicked in the Cranberry Bog and like you broke several weapons, blew through ammo and stimpaks. I was eating everything I had to survive and luckily found a Gatling laser but blew through five fusion cores.
---
Agree with all except the scoreboard. 
---
5 radaways and 5 rad-x as a reward? That's BS
---
Also from what I can see you cant even get the power patrol outfit from it (the 1 shown on brick house and the woman at the bottom of the board)
---
Oh really? That's what I was rocking so that's good to hear lol I can't wait to get back in f76
---
Hmm weird idk then.
---
They may have a higher level but I'm not finding that they take longer to kill, I can still almost kill a lvl50 radroach just with one gun bash, no legendary effect assist. Same with the lvl100 Grafton monster and the Flatwoods monster which idek how I got lucky and ran into that again, on the first day of the update especially.
---
Je is better than be or did you mean the other way around?
---
I'm level 220 heavy build with 4 legacies and I was sweating during the daily op...
---
I found a perfect cluster of bushes. I zoomed out with camera mode and looked to see if I was visible. I was so well hidden that I thought I was looking at the wrong bush! The game didn't like me hiding, so it spawned a bloatfly near me after awhile, but even that couldn't see me.
---
Ah thats what those are for. Need me a vampires flamer or something now...
---
It is not that it is a bit harder, but every enemie has the same level now. That is annoying. There should be some difference between a molerat and a ghoul for example
---
In ESO the amount of champions point you collect is your “level”  you collect them with exp points after lvl50 
---
In Eso my lvl CP560... once an alt hits lvl50 there lvl is converted to my CP560
---
A similar system could have been put into FO76 ,  10k exp = 1 perk coin and letting it be account wide
---
I went in with my high dr melee build and just failed trying to solo it.
---
Honestly not at all their measly amounts of xp didn't justify wasting ammo on them. Now atleast it's somewhat worth it.
---
I instantly maxed out the perk so I can open locks and terminals with the click of a button. Talk about awesome...never having to swap out cards to pick a lock is heaven.
---
Standard pa heavy bloodied but now with demo and full adrenaline  + bloodied gauss minigun overuse hence batteries included.  would like to work take one for the team into it tbh. https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f154b9b&amp;d=sb2sq2s22s32sr2pe0eu0ee2ib2ic2s12ip2ir2a72s72a12a04l71ls2lt2x03x73xj3xn3x43lu2ce0cu2
---
You lost me at x 😂
---
What's your damage loss like out of curiosity? I normally run instigating weapons and haven't really noticed a significant drop.
---
Still a bloodied stealth commando using bE25/B2525 handmades. I was able to add adrenaline to my build because of the legendary perks as well as "follow through" so my damage is around the same as it was, if not more in some cases. Im scared to test my unarmed junkies character though...
---
Pisses me off how we grind out full sets of unyielding,Ultractie and Strangler Heart.
---
And when we actually need it Gutsies just carve it up like a Sunday Roast.
---
My Stats have me at like 580 Armour 380 radiation protection etc.
---
Yet one quick burst from a Gutsy and i am done.
---
Bad enough killing one with a Gun,never mind 40 + with a Gun,and switching to a Melee [weapon.As](https://weapon.As) has been pointed out the only Melee weapons you can use in power armour are all crap.
---
Well I mean, yeah it always has been. It’s one of the most OP builds pre 22 and post 22.
---
Small enemies are still squishy though. A lv 75 mutie might have like 1.5k hp or so now but a similarly high lv rat has much less hp, like 650 from what i saw earlier behind Generals Steakhouse.
---
Bloatflies seem to always explode on one shot. I think they can fix some of this through hp balancing. Lv 50 radroach? Give it no more than 200 hp. Its plenty.
---
In the forest. A area that was meant to be safer and easier. So yah, waste of bullets.
---
Yup store your bow BGS destroyed the weapon.  String weapons suck now. Had to trade for a QE harpoon gun and a vamp's mg-42 to keep playing 'stealth sniper'.Even the QE harpooner needs two shots at lvl 100 super muties sometimes.
---
Ya I’m with you OP.  The few things I wouldn’t mind are on the 1st half of the board.  Dont care about the greenhouse.  I felt relieved as well.
---
I don’t know about you, but I find, say, a highest level Charred Ghoul way harder to kill than a highest level mole rat.
---
x = you and everyone else got fucked by Bethesda.  That's the tl;dr formula.
---
That's awesome! And I'm scared to try my unarmed bloodied lol 😢😅
---
Saw "resilient" and said no thanks. I'm a commando build, what do I want with something that requires melee?
---
Dave Fennoy is amazing. Those who have played The Walking Dead games by Telltale will know him. But yeah, the fact that Grahm has THREE voices that sound so different is really frustrating. Especially since he rotates through them, instead of them having one of the VA’s rerecord everything.
---
Ya i do this too but all to often it just doesn’t seem to display the corpse name  in the top left.
---
I made a very similar post and got flamed. The game is trash now and ruined. It takes 10x the ammo to kill anything. Now not to mention how much longer it takes to do earl and the queen. The game is a waste all we have is the queen the sheep and earl an those are ruined. All the other stuff is a waste of time. So bugthesdas logic is lets break an already broken game more. Who in there right mind wants to piss away 10k ammo on a queen for a 1 star golf club and a 2 star trapper arm??? Leave the op builds alone and fix the useless prefixes instead of ruining this trash ass game anymore. No one want to spend 20 mins plus on a boss fight for garbage drops. Heres an idea you morons 3 stars should always drop 3 stars. Why the hell does a boss drop a 1 star anyway.
---
With patch 22 Bethesda is telling everyone they have to go to a Bloodied build, no exceptions. As one who was running a bloodied build before patch 22, I have noticed needing a few more rounds or swings of my bloodied weapons to get kills even on lvl 100+ Scorched but not too much trouble. I can only imagine the pain non bloodied has to go through to get kills.

Thanks for playing. Better luck next time.
---
My non-meta build is doing great actually.
---
They are brilliant. It took three rounds before our team got Elder rating - lots of swearing &amp; raging but *precisely* the challenge our team has been looking for - the verdict was unanimously good.
---
Hats off to Bethesda for this one 🙂👍
---
jeez... sounds like those got hit just way too hard :( ill miss those HIGH lever numbers
---
What’s next 2020!!??        lol
---
Nice! Ty for the follow through tip, I haven’t studied the leg perks as yet.. My B Fixer is now named just Fixer, and is down in dmg output..
---
Some initial things I’ve noticed, Ghouls in WS seem more agressive with level 75 instead of 68. The Bloated one is now level 100 in the gold club. But watch out for those now level 5 squirrels! 😀👍🏼
---
What? It's perfectly fair. Eagle eye negates stealth, and that should've been obvious before you even went in to the event. And resilient is a love letter to melee, which has long been a build which had next to no situations where it excelled. You're acting like every single one of these events is going to be unsuitable for your chosen build. You painted yourself into a corner. Don't be a one trick pony.
---
You've been presented with a situation that stealth doesn't work in, and you're talking about it like the game's been ruined. If you're going to be unhappy if you can't stealth through an op, then skip the op when eagle eye rolls around again.
---
Nope, not now. It was a blast while it lasted. Could clean out WestTek taking no damage and  one shotting everything (barely). You just had to never lose stealth. If you do.. run hide and get back to caution then keep going. The bows are super quiet an one of the best stealth weapons.
---

Im fine,but my wife is totally discouraged.her usual run that was fairly easy for her has now turned into a one slap from a ghoul and she is dead.lol.
---
Yeah I had an hour on yesterday and turned it of. I didn’t even look into the legendary perks. 
---
Took 3 hits to kill a wolf in the forest melee with w bloodied death claw all unyielding gear and a pube of Health. I think they’ve fucked the game. The easiest of events is now a nightmare and not worth the hassle .
---
I agree. I'm just a little tired of the hypocrisy here about how exploits ruin the game as these same people complaining use exploits every time they play. Just because we can rationalize using the ones we like because, "They don't affect anyone else's game" doesn't make them less of an exploit. It's like certain YouTubers calling others cheaters while simultaneously glitching through silo walls for the 3rd time in an hour to farm Earle and the Queen. Just be honest about it. The holier-than-thou attitude is ridiculous.
---
Dude, I play GW2, they've never forced restrictions in us just to combat duping. They've always been on top of it, its never happen at a scale that had much of an impact on the game.
---
I'm 92, haven't played the update yet, but i should hopefully be fine. I can 1-2 shot any non boss type enemy with my double barrel, so I should be ok. But we'll see.
---
I'd totally play fallout for snowflakes
---
Absolutely.  I can confirm.  Oregon's state government is a total s#it show.
---
TIL
---
Cool thx 😃
---
You didn't get your coins for converted perks, or the coins just disappeared?
---
You get the one time of 50 for reaching level 50 then 2 for each perk card level(max of 6) that you convert.
---
I have a Hybrid Bloodied Magic Gauss Mini and it still shreds
---
Any respec system needs to make generating new legedaries easier too. In the end, that’s what’s slowing down my transition from a stealth rifleman to a heavy rifleman, all my lovely improved sneak secret service armor.
---
Make it cost more resources, but left us just choose our legendaries when we’re crafting.
---
  I have to agree, this feels like a system set up for the 1% while the rest of the players who just hit max level or are working on getting to max level have to deal with the nerfed weapons and increased mob scaling.
---
  I just hit 50 not to long ago and Im trying to set up my build, find the right gear. All the while stuff that took little effort still take little effort, they just soak up all the ammo, I did a Charlston run and claimed the airport while doing the 1 wave of mobs and it was over 300 bullets now.
---
I believe I read somewhere perk pack duplicates werent registering in the past? Is that what you're referring to? Dang. Need to do math on mine now to see what you're saying.
---
This has happened to me and there was another person this recently happened to who posted here.
---
From what I've tested myself, it seems to be down to the terrain you are camped on. The minute I changed to a flatter spot it fixed. I even went back to the old camp spot and sure enough the ally problem reoccurred.
---
Sorry. I think you might have to move your camp.
---
You are indeed correct. I dont know why I wrote it like that :P
---
Wow you did it in 5mins!
---
That must have added a couple of inches, what you up to 3 inches total now?
---
what part of  THE MOOOOOOON  did you not understand?
---
Oh yeah, people going from 2k damage to 500, and against tankier enemies now. I get the overall damage nerf, enemy buff and honestly its made the game more fun for me, but why in the world would a a build that only has one perk set vs the normal 3 get nerfed so damn hard? I know there's mutations and even armor mods that help a ton, but i think melee in general needs some sort of buff. I mean there's like no reward for the risk now :(
---
It’s a helmet and I have 3.  Not so rare.
---
Yep its a dumpster fire now.
---
Stupid auto correct I said can* but my phone pranked me lol.
---
Hot damn
---
Try an anti-armor weapon. My damage with that is actually pretty close to pre-patch and most enemies are 1/2 shots. Even in ops, I’m only looking at 3/4.
---
I have a TSE15fr minigun and it's got god rolls however it hardly does any damage and the accuracy is shocking
---
Hes saying he should have more perk coins based on the number of cards he has collected over the levels. Im assuming he minused what he used for respec, since he appears so detailed.
---
Yep...its pointless to even do those events they ruined the game completely.
---
Je does extra damage than it shows, especially in pvp.
---
I agree I love melee but as soon as you are seen its death I wish it was tweaked so bad
---
Thanks I'll give that a shot.
---
Oh nice I was wondering
---
My stealth rifleman is doing just fine? Things are a little tougher, but it’s basically still just fine.
---
This is why i am suspicious of those alleging to have completed this first time around, with exceptional times.
---
I could not move quickly even if i wanted to.
---
 Big Hordes keep you pinned down blocking the path.
---
If you try and barge past 4,5, Gutsies firing depleted uranium it ends only one way.
---
So you have to deal with most of them no matter how much you dont want to.
---
Check you pip boy for another quest that isn’t toggled active and activate it
---
They can do that with the hoards of micro-transaction locked products they keep adding to the store.
---
It is entirely possible to play this game solo, I've had people drop in and out of my game over the last couple of years but if I'm honest I find it more enjoyable assuming the role of lone wanderer. That said, with the introduction of public teams I often play in a team and reap the benefits of doing so whilst still flying solo if that makes sense.
---
True, I am sure, I have mixed bolstering and unyielding Secret Service, have wasted 30 crafts in last 3 days trying to create just one unyielding right arm, I need right arm, chest and right leg if you require to match armour type and effect.....nightmare...
---
Same for me - ultracite fusion cells. Not as hard to get or to burn as 2 mm i suppose, but the flux savings! Tripled my meager supply of 500 today.
---
I’ve still got heaps because I’m sitting on heaps of the animated cards, I thought they were going to cash in for more points. I know they’ve doubled what the standard ones are worth so I’m guessing this isn’t the case anymore?
---
Yeah it does, couple more bullets, nothing too horrible, but my armor have been breaking a lot faster, not sure if my imagination or not
---
Haha same- I didn’t think about bashing until I was done!
---
Expanding the Camp budget is always a cool idea when the tech can handle it but it shouldn’t be tied to Perk/traits :)
---
No it's just weapon and armor durability was cut in half essentially from the rebalance and enemies scaling to your level.
---
There was an old bug that ate perks.  Single rank perks (like lockpicking, hacking etc) can't be upgraded so Bethesda in their infinite wisdom decided that there was no reason for people to collect multiple copies.  This meant  that if you opened up a perk pack and one of these perks was inside and you already had a copy then it would just disappear.  poof.
---
Maybe Bethesda will follow through with this rebalance for once and make some much needed individual build  tweaks. One can only hope
---
Right? I mean I have to pay attention at fights now, it makes it interesting
---
We finished up a queen and a couple earls/ops. Magic weapons still work. Be is still ridiculous. 
---
Stealth seems about the same except the dragon drops it for a second unlike before. About half damage all the way around except Tse- seems the same damage as pre patch. Anyway here's what I'm seeing [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyJG3EA7N9Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyJG3EA7N9Y)
---
Vanathru explained the 2 shot numbers, it's 62.5% x2
---
Negligible.  I just made 2500 plasma cores though, so no sweat.  It takes 2 milliseconds longer to kill enemies.  Big deal.
---
Huh, they DID leave this out of the patch notes didn’t they? I remember reading about it on the PTS update’s patch notes when they got the change, but I guess they wanted to surprise us with it. Oops.
---
Get an anti-armour rifle. You’ll barely notice a difference.
---
That’s good - I actually don’t run melee myself on my main but a friend was surprised by how many more hits certain enemies were taking him despite being an optimized build. I’ll have to check my second character later today and see how her damage is now.
---
When you level up but instead of unlocking perks you move SPECIAL points around to try different builds, what does that do to your total coin count? I’ve played so many different builds on my main character, I’m sure I lost a ton.
---
If I’m not mistaken, every Op in the PTS had Piercing Gaze. :(
---
Cost of swaping lendary perks, should be removed, and why golden perks cost the same for scrap?
---
yeah..very cool. read his relocation notice. was pretty funny.
---
The change to damage being additive and levels is actually not that bad. I was expecting to do a lot less damage and while I kinda am I haven’t really noticed a difference. Daily ops are super fun but I feel that this first one with the modifiers “can only be killed by melee” and robot enemies was one of the worst possible starting ones.
---
I soloed it and died not once. But I took more than 16 minutes. Hopefully the other enemy combos are better. Because I think it can be really funny.
---
Nope. There is some receiver that does that ( scorched reciever or something, idk what its called exactly), but not the prime receiver. Prime reciever deals extra damage against scorched and scorched beasts.
---
Uh... very interesting
---
My Anti Armor heavy guns aren't anti armor now. I compared two plasma gatling guns. Same ammo and mods. One is anti armor and the other normal. Both weapons did the exact same amount of damage.
---
If you ask me, which you didn't, Wastelanders was even better.
---
Oh wow. Levelling up my level 15 alt is going to be fun then.
---
Guess they'll be relegated to just being a mule with a cool camp.
---
I did... In the forest. 
---
Never seen them there, they were attacking a group of settlers. My Grognak ax with increased swing speed still makes quick work of them but now my 3 star exploding handmade feels like a BB gun. 
---
I'm level 109.
---
I have...and since enemies hit like trucks now (i'm looking at you level 75 armor piercing gutsies) it's sometimes impossible to kill them if there are more than 2 or 3 without getting downed or close to it. Not to mention hits STILL not registering even though the damage numbers are there AND the sound of a hit connecting is there.
---
I want to remind you of what you said earlier.
---
&gt;Their fault for duping being possible.
---
Also you
---
So I just want to be clear on something. The dupes in GW were entirely their fault and if they built it right, it shouldn't be possible?
---
Do you not see how much of a bad take this is?
---
Look, I'm not happy with Bethesda's solution with the matter. To absolve any blame due to the dupers is just laughably bad.
---
So let's not pretend the dupers had nothing to do with this. Could Bethesda have put forward a better solution, sure. But this is the Bethesda we have, not the Bethesda we'd like them to be.
---
It's clear that they lack both the competence in execution and the will to put any meaningful resources towards resolving it. So we get what we get. 
---
To paraphrase you, not condoning it but Bethesda aren't entirely the ones at fault for the anti duping system we have in place.
---
this glitch + fixer makes me feel straight up evil against bosses
---
I went all out on luck never have to pick between one man army and luck of the draw again :)
---
I just made it up. It was a joke... but there is an animatronic clown in the build menu
---
It's almost as if working as a team and utilizing our different skills makes the experience better! Who knew? My team is loving it 🙂
---
Exactly I like being a god on like F4 but in multiplayer its just not as fun too me
---
My characters actually have builds now instead of a giant mess of cards, I love it! Especially never having to equip Lockpick or Hacker cards ever again! 🤙
---
I wouldn't doubt it if it is tbh
---
Yes. I saw that. ☹  
---
I used it to switch one out and only one coin so no big deal.
---
Too long.....11 mins. No way I'll ever get elder on the burrows.
---
yea. I have a setup already for a heavy gunner build which doesn't take much...I just HATE power armor...
---
yeah cool, don't know what everyone else is talking about with massive damage losses, maybe theyre not using their perks right or something.
---
Pepperidge Farm remembers. :(
---
Yeah it kind of sucks, not gunna lie. My Gamma Gun apparently is now more powerful than my Lever Action, Fixer and LMG.
---
Go figure.
---
One more reason to eagerly await their visit! :o
---
I hope man I want some other stuff done but I would okay if they just do that and leave it for a while
---
\~1500dmg is pretty common head shot from plasma caster :D and can shot across map
---
pretty sure stealth commando still do multiple times better damage...
---
Considering that instanced CAMPs are going to be a thing soon(ish) and that they will have a much higher build limit, I very much doubt that they'll do anything with current CAMP limitations.
---
Use M
---
I'm bloodied commando, and didn't apply any perks. Just stayed at nerd rage and used my unstoppable monster DCG. Next time maybe I'll actually use some perks and some chems.
---
As took me ages to kill that final boss.
---
Yea i completely agree that a micro-transaction would be super lame. I know a lot of people would be unhappy about that. I think with the addition of load-outs in the future they need to add a full respec system that only costs caps to respec your character.
---
as a high level player this update is fantastic. Especially if you're a heavy build. Everything is a little bit more harder but once you reach level 200 everything starts to be a little too easy anyway. Also now with the daily ops you can literally farm ammo. 
---
But I can't stop thinking how I was struggling to get ammo and caps and stimpaks all the way to almost level 120.and now I feel like the struggle will be even bigger.
---
Some weapons when combined with armor that has  blocking damage reduction magically makes certain weapons ignore the damage caps/nerfs BGS implemented. You get full damage, no nerf and a mighty nice OP weapon.
---
There were more negative comments than positive ones regarding the damage changes. And issues with low levels having a seriously difficult time was brought up, many times. They just didn't make any changes to the initial state. In all probability they wanted a larger sample size before adjusting anything, if they even plan to do so.
---
had the same thing, when off and did something else, forgot about it for a week, went back and no problems.
---
Honestly, I've found the backpack mod from the raiders far more useful. The weight reduction on stimpacks and chems gives me more carry capacity back than the high capacity backpack adds on.
---
...this pisses me off more.
---
Yeah. But he wasn't yelling me about how 'freedom means freedom not control by some Central authority' when I saw him
---
OP don't waste your legendary as your instanced one coming up will be better than any perk would have been.
---
I just want to have nice things people can't get to. I need a bunker door with a razor wire fence, and a wonderland underground.
---
LOL.
---
loving the update. Especially super mutants. harder hitting and they are tankier. it's great!
---
I had to do that. It goes stupid I do that. Bitch it out. Swap it about. Rinse and repeat. Stupid thing.
---
Dont be selfish............Think of the Snowflakes who cant be arsed optimizing their builds,running around with shit Guns and Armour. They were getting really upset at the disparity.
---
What is really laughable is Bethedsa has not dealt with the real problem,broken legendery effects,and stacking chems etc.
---
Those players are alright.
---
They just slashed bloodied damage by 50 %. because that was much easier to do.
---
As things stand i have a Stash full of obsolete weapons.
---
I now have a 50 Cal explosive Sniper Rifle that  puts out 220 damage a [shot.it](https://shot.it) was putting out 500.
---
i could destroy a sentry-bot with 2 shots,now i need 20.
---
Damn right, and thanks to the legendary perks I've now got enough spare agility to go from rank 2 White Knight to rank 3.
---
Just need to decide what i'm using my other agi points for now.
---
I couldn't even beat it. Idk
---
I may not have asked, but value an alternate opinion as much as if I had. What was it about wastelanders you think was better?
---
I cant play either:(
---
Jesus...did they break that too??
---
im also beta player an i agree
---
You can only get the rewards from initiate, paladin, and elder once a day.
---
All the standered rewards, ammo, stims, nades are farm able
---
Im rly interested how you put your legendary specials besides STR. And what other legendary perks you chose. As a highlvl i have 6 free slots right away as well, but since now i didn't pick anything cause im afraid i could do something wrong and loose points/cards in the process.
---
To be totally honest i didn't even take a look at them yet because they are blocked by my still active perk loadout mod. I am bloodied too and wonder how many specials i should bring up and what is the best for bloodied builds outside of the special legendary perks.
---
I’m sure they’ll rebalance it. There’s no way unarmed is meant to do that little damage.
---
Out of interest, is that legendary perk really the bees knees? I’m undecided what to use for my 6th legendary slot. I’m not normally a PA user, but by the sounds of it, this would make you almost invincible in PA for the Robot daily ops, and essentially you can just stand near the 3 signals without the need to fight back? (Or do you still take a tanking?)
---
I honestly wouldn't care if they capped how many scrip i could spend a day if they would just allow me to turn in all my unwanted legendary items and bank the scrip.
---
I can't wait to go into vault 94.
---
Awesome user name 👍🏻
---
Why, people will buy different weapons to suit their new builds
---
Not sure on the down voting here this is a rational explanation.
---
Get anti armor explosive  rifles. Problem solved.
---
Ahh ok. So then would you recommend doing the daily ops three times? Once at each difficulty to get a chance at the rare plans and rewards?
---
Maybe they wanted higher xp from killing things beyond their level. Alot of low level players are alt toons and they already know how to take down the enemies without getting reamed regardless of level.
---
The legendary perk helped me a lot due to its healing. Have you tried that?
---
The game does change. Now I can do any event im any area and not get lv 10 weapons. Lv 50 molerats die in 1 or two bullets. If you waste anything more you just suck in general.
---
When they messed with psychobuff tho, deaths come a bit easier.
---
&gt;Most of my weapons are worthless even though they are end-game 3-stars. I'm not going to chase meta just to enjoy the game again. I'll give this a few more days, but, honestly, this may drive me away from the game altogether.
---
I can see the same thing happening to me.   Hope it doesn't, but it's possible.  We'll see, won't we?   Who knows.   Hopefully, if it's too bad, they'll change it.
---
So the thing is you lose more damage the higher your damage was to begin with.  That's why rifles and melee are so much more worse off.  Heavy guns are better off because they have a high rate of fire, which wasn't nerfed.
---
Is housing instanced?  Can you have vendors?  Not a fan of instanced houses.
---
Well shit. That make them...major assholes. Like the biggest assholes! All those people above, that survived bombs, died because of them. And looks like Modus with all his intelligence and self-awareness was ok with that. Damn, that's what I really dislike in fo76, that you HAVE to be allies with assholes because they have a part of content and unique rewards on them. I would gladly burn down the Crater and remains of enclave bunker.
---
I started playing a couple of months ago. It's a great game.
---
My Instigating Super Sledge was hitting ~1,400s with Heavy Swings, 15 Strength, and Incisor.
---
If you hit elder you get the rewards from the easier 2 teirs.so there's no reason to do it again if you finish in under 8 minutes. Other than for xp, and ammo and such
---
Quick question, you said you’re using max Rifleman. Does that mean you’re using a fully ranked Rifleman card, or individual rank 1 basic/expert/master cards? The latter gives more damage output.
---
Ahh makes sense now cheers for that info
---
I just used my handmade and then butted them with it for the final blow and it worked fine.
---
Classic Bethesda. Doing the complete opposite of "improving" their game most of the time.
---
Yeah its insane lol :D
---
You’re not in the minority, friend. I too, hate this new patch with a passion.
---
Hope you like it. Many funs to be had.
---
Even the higher levels it’s mostly the same.  
---
I’m around 115, with an instigating sniper rifle that gets a x3.5 sneak bonus at night with max rifleman perks and adrenaline low health damage boost. I shot a level 60 floater while hidden. Took about 40% of its health.  
---
Shot some radtoads ranging from 60 to 100, same thing. It’s a drastic change from one or two shotting everything.
---
The fact it’s The Fixer, arguably the most popular gun in the game, bodes well that it gets fixed sooner rather than later.
---
OHHH 1\* Chameleon wood leg!!! That's what I've been looking for!!!! AHH! Wait.. what's that.. oh it's my meds, forgot to take them
---
Yeah, I think this is the big difference. Previously you could run through 1-50 with barely any weapon level upgrades. I think I went 20-40 with a lvl 20 rifle. But now on my new alt I can feel the difference. It’s easy to handle for players who “get” the game but it’ll probably be rough for new players, so I’ll continue helping them out when I can
---
Confirmed. Makes it pretty damn easy.
---
They are for upgrading legendary perks.
---
On the flip side, it’s a game. You’re supposed to be able to relax, not get stressed out by it. Having to farm a fuck ton of ammo just to survive in the easy area doesn’t make me feel relaxed, it pisses me off. Exactly what I’m trying to escape from.
---
You must know it doesn’t cover ur whole face it looks kinda awkward i wish i knew this before i bought it
---
Not big, very disappointing.
---
At least i can give them to new players or vendor trash them.  The scrap kits and repair kits can suck an egg in my book.  Near useless and can't be sold.
---
Meet my heavy gun dude. This is basically what I’m aiming for, but not necessarily what I have right now. I currently only have 12 strength and still have 11 luck and 4 perception.
---

---
I made it purposely easy to swap between power armor and not. Just swap out chem fiend with Adamantium Skeleton and throw in something besides Stabilized. Bam. 
---
It’s also very easy to swap this to a Bloodied build if I feel like it. Lose Stabilized for Nerd Rage. I lose the armor penetration but I still pick up a ton of damage per second.
---
I’ve got a sweet set of Gauss Miniguns I’m trailing to become my top gun. (Take my breath awaaaaaaaay...) 
---
The current leaders are a TSFFR, IFFFR, and Bloodied (something else). 
---
I also have a VFFR but no way am I giving it up. Couple that thing with Electric Absorption and power armor vs anything that does energy damage and I’m invincible. Robots in Uplink do nothing. I can walk through West Tek even after One Wasteland and nothing happens to me. 
---
Speaking of Electric Absorption, I might be going crazy, but as I was playing with the Bloodied Gauss Minigun down at Fissure Prime, in my Excavator armor that doesn’t have Medic Pump on it, I swear I saw a Scorhbeast sonic boom attack refill my core and HP. I’m gonna test it again tomorrow after work. If this is a thing, Electric Absorption is the next thing to get maxed out.
---
The Instigating Gauss Minigun is, yes, magic. If I was a wise man, I’d get rid of it, because I already have an Instigating Minigun that absolutely rips to shreds. I used it to take out the end boss of today’s Uplink right at the 8 minute mark. (The video is intense.)
---
I’ve also built this to easily allow for a swap to bloodied one-handed melee just in case a Daily Op calls for it. Same deal with endurance, just swap out Chem Fiend and swap in Skeleton. It’s not like I don’t have plenty of Psychobuff so I can spare some extra usage if need be. 
---
The question, in the end, becomes “which gun do I pick.” The TSFFR shreds pretty well. It’s not as fast as the IFFR but the IFFR being so amazing just feels...fake? I guess that’s the word.
---
As for the damage multipliers change, I honestly barely noticed. The Bloodied still shreds stuff in half. Scorchbeasts end in seconds - legendary or not, Prime or not. The magic ones still shred. Everything I enemy I point my weapon at is high level usually, and I haven’t gone for the OP build since my Bloodied melee days, so I’m used to pumping out rounds. Going OP just seems so...monotonous to me. “Oh I one hit that Scorchbeast for the eighth time today.” I prefer to work for it. 
---
But, I’m an open guy, so I’m trying the Bloodied life out now that additive is the new way things go, especially when trying to solo a Daily Op for the highest tier.
---
The biggest “oh wow this is different” came when I did Jail Break this evening. Every enemy was level 50. That was VERY fun.
---
Yeah yeah. My level 16 was using this card all evening. 😎
---
Daily ops have a permanent effect that makes it so all enemies always see you.
---
depends on your expectations
---
i saw the preview in the "inside the vault" article and instantly knew it would be a tough fight with a lot of fun
---
if you expect to enter burrows, oneshot a couple of enemies and have a relaxed time you might be disapointed ;-)
---
first try i entered the event and died almonst instant, equiped my vampire gatling plasma and since then its a lot of fun
---
Lots of those extremely high performance meta builds are upset, despite the existence of their builds being harmful to the game's overall health.
---
Lots of people don't want to hear the truth.
---
It was fun, yesterday.
---
Yah it has turned me away from playing. No one was there to help I even asked friends and they said it was a waste of time. The days of endless nukes on SBQ and ACP are more then likely behind us. I’ll stay updated with the game tosee if it changes but until then time to find a new way to spend my time off.
---
This VV
---
Shotguns are so bad it is unreal.
---
Oh, nice. Even passive players are popping?
---
Wow, I'll have to try that. I ran the Golf Club and *everything* saw me. I was wondering if stealth had been nerfed.
---
Thanks mate
---
Ah okay thats good. You do have all the shotgun perks + nerd rage ect right?
---
Im still downloading my update sooo yeah im pretty curious to see the damage numbers on the bloodied gauss.
---
I mean, what a shame. I am sure they will fix this swiftly.
---
L100 mutant hounds aren't much fun.
---
TL;DR- this update is only to benefit level 400+ people on pc. Change my mind. 
---
This is part of my complaint: this update is geared toward players with very specific builds and very specific guns. I’m a stealth player, even more so after the Chinese stealth suit. I relied on my high powered shot gun (not legendary) and my mole miner claw. I’m level 86. I’m also a prolific crafter which is part of the reason for my level, however, at the same time I was able to previously launch a nuke on my own BUT with the new leveling I’m just absolutely destroyed. My point is absolutely could hold my own before and enjoyed it. I could complete the end game before but now I can’t do Sophia D’s side quest at West Tek because level 75+ super mutants swarm and destroy. It doesn’t make sense. It isn’t fun. And I’m glad people who play obviously a lot more and are much higher level find this fun. People with the ‘magic build’ find it fun but if BGS was only going to reward those people then why give us the option to do anything other than the magic build? My weapons- all of them right down the line get nerfed but they enemies get insanely buffed? I guess what I’m saying is the game was grindy enough but I could still do things I enjoyed like camp building. But now what was a spawn point for level 6 wolves now spawns level 50 sh-t. I don’t WANT everything to be a constant fight. I get that I’m in a minority and I get I may be the last hold out that wanted 76 to be an actual RPG but I honestly wish they back off on the leveling of enemies. The changes to daily ops and the like? I have no comment because no one is forced to play daily ops. My beef is with the main world and the main game play. I guess the easy answer is this update is for everyone who is level 400+ on a pc who has gotten bored but I’m a dedicated player on console and have never been in it for the kill fests because, again, I treated it like an RPG and the role I want to play isn’t that. It is just stupid to me I could launch a nuke solo but can’t even get half way through west tek now. Make it make sense.
---
Seems incisor is essential for melee builds more than before if you hadn't been rocking it normally. 
---
Got my death claw to feel closer to normal, but my bloodied cultist dagger is hosed 
---
Tempted to just scrap those perks but the cultists dagger fits with my character's aesthetic so well.
---
Mind listing which legendary cards you had equipped at the time?
---
See, I told y’all my math was right and this man here is proof.
---
Ah ok cheers mate, I saw a post saying it gets rid of the beard but that was a year ago, is that still the case do you know?
---
Thanks for your work! 
---
Finally we found a use for the ugly and disgusting sack of Earl. We will make it an alcohol drink and we will be so drunk that his scream will sound like lullaby :P
---
I just put a few upgrades into a few of my specials so I could add an extra card in here and there.
---
I know about the magnifying glass from FO4, but I only knew how to activate it from crafting menus to tag the things you don't have for specific items. If I can actually go down the list and check all the hard to find items that'll be helpful. Thanks for the Doc link as well.
---
How do i get the legendary perk?
---
Yea man! Anytime.
---
Depends on what you want and your priorities based on need but some of them dont need levelling up. Funky duds gives enough poison resistance at base level for example. Im also only taking the base level for Master Infiltrator too.
---
They said they'd add a key ring ages ago. Ive given up hope lol
---
I think you might be in the wrong thread...
---
I reinstalled because I seen people praising the update so much this morning, but honestly the level cap thing messed it all up for me no fun
---
Yes! Level 424 here and i was so happy when i went to capture the gorge workshop and all the mobs were level 50 :) The map is interesting again and i feel challenged.
---
actually its not. my tse fixer does more dmg than my be fixer. having a bloodied build now is pointless. high or low health the tse still does more dmg. unyielding ss armor set of mine that took months to get.... now fucking useless
---
yeah i agree but i cant enter west tek without an infinite loading screen so thats not so amazing, anyone else have the same problem?
---
Yup the mask gave me a clean shave. And it does look awkward with most hat... even without a hat
---
No. Lv 50 enemies everywhere is a great thing.
---
Ahh ok. I see. Well there’s now way I’m beating it at that time lmao so I’m just happy I beat it. Thanks for the reply though :)
---
Not sure i don’t have a beard
---
Why have you included perk points at the beginning of your workings? Perk points do not equal perk coins. Only perk cards equal perk coins. Take x-1 out and it starts to look more reasonable.
---
Haha crystal blast goes SLAM
---
They need to make most cross compatible with rifle and shotgun. Vary little on the model changes and I have no decent combat shotgun skins lol
---
I just see a shelf a window and a cash register?
---
They don't, you're just over exaggerating everything. I also recommend using dodgy at max level.
---
Absolutely loving it
---
Double score full weeks + extra challenge weeks. You’re missing a lot.
---
I was looking forward to a nice pa skin as I missed the last one but this lvl 100 pa looks awful
---
I used mainly the special ones to kinda add to my build and then the far flung fireworks one I think it's called but so far hasn't seemed all that useful and I'm even using a furious explosive fixer but that is just my opinion. Thinking about swapping it out with the ammo one because I am going through some bullets with the new damage Nerf and increase in enemy levels. That 10k rounds I had saved up really getting low already and it's just the first day.
---
Git gud
---
You honestly might have picked one of the worst ones (at least above the pile of shit known as Brotherhood of Steel) to start with. You can easily grab NV or 4 and mod it to the nine hells and balance it perfectly to your liking.
---
Im guessing it's this too, it's a pretty old bug that I haven't seen mentioned for a while now but it definitely isn't new. The cracks in the update are starting to show lol, not that this is a negative thing, and so far it's been nothing but an improvement to the game.
---
I play a stealth commando and unfortunately I don't have the agi points left to use White Knight. Luckily I just recently switched my stealth suit out and some legendary scout armor in, it's just way cheaper to repair than the stealth suit.
---
Umm I think as long as you’re above level 50 you have one slot unlocked. So if you are just go to the legendary perks section on your perks menu and choose the one that recharges your fusion core when taking energy damage. It has a secondary effect that also has a chance to heal you.
---
ultracite ammo in general is hard to mass produce than any kind of normal ammo, but yeah, i'm glad this works to that ammo too
---
Cmon bruh
---
Kinda sad was nice having something there amid the chaos
---
Yeah spent an hour trying to find the stupid signal repeater. *sigh*
---
The perk, electrical absorption also heals you when you're hot by an energy attack
---
I got lucky and landed with a grp that knew what to do. I chose to tank and melee, so I wore PA and used my bloodied sledge. It seemed to work best when you had a couple shooters and one or 2 melee-only guys to finish them off (and tank). The first run was under 10 mins, the third was under 8. No good loot though. 
---
I found I could kill in one to 3 hits most of the time. I did have plenty of no-dmg hits though. 
---
The boss was pretty brutal. I went thru a lot of stims. However, I came out ahead because I looted the bodies after the mission and gathered all the stim packs.
---
I mean, it made me actually like the game. I had an issue with difficulty at a lower level so I can only imagine what level 100+ experienced.
---
Yea same just thought it was a clue to something secret idk Im into that stuff usually these aren't that obvious but this can be seen in any lighting condition or orientation facing the bug zapper. I looked at it closer it just looks like the generic interior house cell from fallout 4 since everything looks clean.
---
Same. I dont mind to play Line in the sand as intended, but its pain to try to locate dead Scorced it the large area is not fun.
---
Well it just added so much: new equipment, new events, quite a lot of new missions, NPCs, enemies (I particularly like the Blood Eagles though I think I may be in a minority there), a semblance of dialog.  I admit though I mistakenly thought Public Teams came with Wastelanders, which it did not.
---
This. They were before today, but unfortunately the dmg nerfs really hurt them. :(
---
Loving every second of it. One wasteland was a huge breath of fresh air for me. Also love daily ops
---
I love tougher encounters, that being said, was not amused being killed by the same yaogai 6 times in a row today. 
---
But rearranged my perks some and things seemed to stabilize. 
---
Really miss using my bloodied cultist dagger tho.  .o  ,
---
Had to fall back on the DCG again.
---
Plz buff daggers!
---
Yea all the shotgun perks, nerd rage, mutation and demo expert
---
Ok ima do it when it is not 3am
---
Bye felicia
---
Bitterly disappointed in the daily ops wasn't fun at all plus new patch took all my shotgun ammo just when this game looks like it might not just be a boring money grab it reminds you how little the developers understand ergonomic game play
---
A year from now well finally get the balances needed to weapons, turrets, armor.... Like legendary perks and loadouts
---
Yikes
---
Overall really good! I’ve played since Beta and now level 375, so it’s great to see a challenge in the game again. Level 100 Mutants and Bloated Ghouls! 
---
Also enjoying the new season and daily ops which was really hardcore yesterday in the Burrows! 
---
Watch out for those now level 5 squirrels at WS’s! 👍🏼😀
---
Buff yourself right and you’ll get almost 3 times that.
---
https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html
---
I find it incredible how people will just bullshit their way into getting what they want. If you were good before and bad now, it just means you have always been bad, but the game was too easy.
---
I have an idea. You know how in Minecraft you kill a certain thing in the nether, a zombie pig man if I remember right, and every single one within a 32 block radius started attacking you? Maybe have something like that, but any enemy within a certain radius of an object you activate (ie an uplink) is alerted to your presence. Same thing if you attack the boss, anyone nearby knows where you are and will attack you. That way you can still use stealth to get somewhere more easily, but you can’t complete it while relying entirely on stealth.
---
Nah. When they removed team PvP, even the players who prefer to compete amongst each other have had to turn to "griefing" to fill the time.
---
Fucking finally.
---
Probably is. I know games like apex legends the devs reuse window assets and they show parts of the map that might not be in view of that particular window because they reused one from somewhere else. Could just be an oversight.
---
Mhm, first daily op was camouflage blood eagles in valley galleria. Somehow it reseted after 30-60 mins already to the resiient gutsies in the burrows afterwards. But cant complain: 2x Elder tier rewards yesterday 😊
---
With the level of griefing those radroaches have endured its about time Bethesda gave them a little buff. Those mole rats will be seeking retribution too. The wastland just got a little more scary and I'm enjoying it.
---
I'm replacing my special points locked to fixed cards like starched etc with legendary special cards. That gives me a pool of points to move around and mess with different builds.
---
I haven't gotten one. Its the last thing I need. What platform, ill buy one off u.
---
You suck man, that's all there is to it.
---
Ah alright. Damn im gonna miss seeing 2400 haha. At least its still above 1k so yeah. Thanks man!
---
Boo hoo hoo 😢
---
Wow we’re gonna lift bro
---
There’s a shift and this isn’t it. Bloodied is still the meta. The meta is now absolutely useless, and everything else is even more useless. Hope you’re happy. :)
---
Fantastic - the game is challenging again - loving it 🙂
---
The points you earn each time you level up?  Which can be redeemed for a perk card... which can then be converted into coins...
---
Yeah it's fucking rough for new characters. I'm trying to level up my level 16 character, had to transfer ammo from my main because it was draining me so quick.
---
they don't scale infinitely. Otherwise i'd be fighting level 300+ molerats and i'm not. What i said it 100% fact. I even gave an example. Took 2 cards off agility and added 2 cards. Those cards increase my damage a lot. As soon as i get that first kill the damage starts increasing.
---
Buy a console. You aren't special, bro.
---
You take little to no damage. I solo'd the op under 8 minutes easily with this.
---
If it took you 100+ rounds to kill it you're doing something wrong. I can kill a level 100 behemoth in 20 rounds of my junkies gauss mini
---
It stops at 8 times giving you +16 strength.  After that, it just keeps resetting the timer but only for the last set you did.  Each set has its own 30 min timer.
---
Oh cool good to know!
---
Untrue.
---
Non bloodied here and Im not noticing much difference so far. I havent yet tried any of the big enemies like Earle or the SBQ yet but as far as normal enemies go Im doing fine. Ran a few Ops with friends and was holding my own as the melee finisher.
---
I have one high level friend who has lost a shitload of his bloodied damage too but he was still managing to knock down enemies in the Ops pretty well. He is just trying different weapons etc. 
---
It has shaken things up for sure but players are just going to have to adapt a little is all. Give it a week or two for everyone to make adjustments and tweak their builds and no one will remember what the fuss was about I bet.
---
Think I'll increase the price on the Marsupial Serums in my vendor now. ;p
---
Nothing more simple than a few shots of a shotgun and finish them with a punch lol
---
Yao gais back to being murder combo machines.
---
That wasn't quite as amusing but am mostly enjoying things.
---
Just wish daggers got a decent buff.
---
U could of prob got it for a similar price off the Xbox store I paid £20 for mine and got it instantly I always get my games their when they are on sale cause it saves space and they will never get scratched etc
---
Adventure mode: so good. I can search my perk cards easier. And the extra special points, oh I love it
---
Nuclear winter: no. Because the rad-x is broken.
---
You get 2 coins per star. Its a flat rate. They got rid of the extra for animated cards
---
To be honest you make a good point and the Enclave is one of my favorite factions in the fallout universe. The Enclave is the last bastion of the old America. Now I disagree with everything the BOS stand for. They horde tech and ignore the people of the wastelands leaving them to suffer and die with out any leadership. The NCR is close with a mockery of democracy but it's basically a monarchy. If the Enclave took over the NCR then I would say it could be a real force for good. The freestates proved how weak they are by falling apart the day they left their bunkers. The responders I do think could have been a real good faction if not for the scorched. They did do a lot of good in their time and where well organized. Now allied with the Enclave the Responders could have survived the scorched and thrived. Protected by powerarmor clad officers with well trained doctors, emts, and firebreathers. They could have pulled in the Freestates and turned them into their infantry as well as the local PA troops instead of the BOS.
---
Anyone notice free fast travel to the Crater &amp; Foundation?
---
Nice addition.
---
" It feels like daily ops were built SOLELY for a team of power armored heavys. "
---
It's not. 
---
**Sauce**: Me. Normal armour with shotgun finishing it 5 times in time. Also me on an alt with normal armour and a lever action finishing it in time. 
---
Slam debunk!
---
cries in BE beam spliter laser rifle
---
I take it you're on console?  I couldn't go back to not using the Perk Loadout Mod.
---
Edit: Which of you salty console players is downvoting everyone who is enjoying perk loadouts already :'D
---
Remindme! 1 day
---
Well, there IS a skin for the *Gauss* Pistol.
---
You can already pick 5 slots I believe. I’d just rank up one right now. I had the cards (and ruthlessness) to scrap up to 600 coins and max out two Legendary Perks. Ammo Factory (also known my new love video game infatuation) and Legendary Intelligence, id you’re curious what I picked.
---
I'm with you on the Blood Eagles, the holotape with their oath is awesome and they have weapons that pack a good punch and make you rethink running in guns blazing. I still really liked the wastelanders update it ressurected the game for a lot of people that had given up on it or not even tried it, and for the ones playing since beta well it was much needed new content, I just think the level scaling itself was the best thing they could have done. Like I never avoided the lower level areas because of xp as so many had been, it's silly to only stick to a small section of such a beautifully made large map, but now we can level up just the same no matter where we are. It's still surreal to be fighting lvl 50s when taking a workshop for the weekly challenges when they were always so puny.
---
Mole rats don’t deserve to exist. Horrible little cheating cunts.
---
I hate their relfections, its always a forest with ground and rocks. EVEN WHEN INSIDE!! Has irked me since beta lol
---
Welp, at least I’ve got a second use for the Troubleshooter’s armor other than the Encryptid event. You can tank most of the damage that way. Had a train ran on me by the Gutsies in my regular armor. Switched my armor set and soloed it in just over 10 minutes. Next time I’ll basically sprint past the robots to the next objective and hopefully shave off a few minutes.
---
Ah might not bother then cheers
---
It was good for farming loot in the burrows/town XP loop and then being able to immeadiately sell it though...
---
Haha right! That's why I thought this was odd for it to be a completely different reflection only one I have seen this far so I thought must be special.
---
Jesus christ I thought it was just me. I did my dailys on my main and got him close to leveling so i can get the score for tomorrow. Overall honestly the changes to my 161 character were not too bad. The damage change was noticable but wasn't rage inducing for me, it was understandable. I shouldnt be able to one-three shot things like behemoths or mileurk queen. They were beefy but again I understood it, not too hard but not easy. 
---
I had made a secondary character before because I wanted to play a different character. I got annoyed  because I would run into higher level enemies and hit a wall where I had to go farm to level up a bit and then come back and kill them. Not too bad just slightly annoying. I figured I'd wait for the new patch because it was supposed to be better for lower level players. WRONG. 
---
As of this patch I can not ever recommend someone new to come to the game or making a new character for a second build. It is just insanely hard if you want to level by yourself. This patch was supposed to make it better for newer lower level players but its definitely worse. Playing by yourself is an absolute nightmare. 
---
At one point I ran into a turret while doing the main quest. I died 7 times trying to destroy this one turret that was my own level. I wasted maybe 30 shotgun shells because the hp kept resetting as well when I died. Not to mention the stims. I simply am not ever going to log onto that character ever again its like playing fallout 4 on expert mode with a guitar hero controller.
---
Awesome, cheers. Might have to dabble at the default level 1.
---
Durability for weapons and armour degrade 50% slower in daily ops.
---
Oh shit... I’m not joking, I forgot mine. Thanks for the reminder!
---
You should probably try a sub where trading is allowed
---
Can be but don't have to be. I mean, it's a variable based on your choice of two options, pick a card or respec a SPECIAL point. It assumes that the player has never respecced which I find unlikely, making the product very unreliable to say the least.
---
I mean, have you never respecced?
---
Thanks for the tip. I rely on vats alot. Does commando not use that?
---
Since I’m being downvoted for just speculation I decided to look it up. Unless this video is outdated can you explain? [Magic Weapon list at 1:02](https://youtu.be/9mRX-MEPzhs)
---
I haven't opened or ranked up a card in over 250 levels. I have only just logged on after the update and haven't played around with the system for long yet but I am really hoping there is a way to trade in unused packs / level ups because if there isn't it's really going to hurt sitting through that many. My fault though, probably should have seen it coming haha.
---
Plus had to re load new ops mission 3 times and guns keep bugging out can't reload can't switch guns for someone who has adored the fallout series this game has been a true test to stick with this series
---
I did what they all did, got agility to rank 4 then level two everything else (end, per, ammo factory and melee cleave damage)
---
It's a terrible change. Some of the lifers will live out because they are dead and empty and need something, anything, to revive them, but for actual players it makes the world flat, samey, uninspired, and stupidly difficult where it shouldn't be. No way should there be level 50 mole rats anywhere. A mole rat shouldn't eat four shotgun blasts, ever.
---
I haven't really played thst much since the newer update, so i can't really say much other than from ehat I've read sorry
---
Yep, was looking at all the prizes, and nothing really "excited" me until 3/4 of the way across the board. Won't be making as much as an effort to progress this time round.
---
Lots of extra fluff in there.
---
ok... so if Im holding a melee wep... and I have equipped the luck skill ricochet.. the 1 HP Damaged Resiliant Gutsys will kill themselves?   
---
    
---
:D
---
Awww yiss
---
That's the Fallout 4 player's pre-war home lol
---
Ahah that explains a lot. Thx. :)
---
I’m not an optimised junkies heavy build, am I? I’ve barely completed the vault raid and nothing I can get with bullion interested me. I’m a Bloodied commando and I’ve invested in all the damage reduction and increase perks, but when your damage is cut down from 884 with a BE railway rifle to 241, it’s not easy, is it?
---
And at that very instant you activate the uplink stealth becomes useless and the people that snuck there get surrounded and slaughtered by enemies they can no longer hide from and get no stealth multipliers for attacking. If you're going to say that they should take out other weapons or put on power armor well... that's the argument they're against, being forced to not be able to use their preferred play style.  And even if they did switch then why not just use those weapons and PA in  the first place?
---
If your game became “extremly hard” than im sorry to inform you that your build is not balanced at all.
---
As a PA main, it was the only one I maxed out thus far lol. Don't regret it one bit, makes exp farming on mutant's a breeze.
---
Havent fully explored much but friends and I ran a few Daily Ops and Im enjoying them quite a lot more than i thought I would. So far Im not finding the damage changes too problematic. That might change when I come to do SBQ or Earle again but so far so good.
---
I don't know, I've not had chance to try it, it should work though.
---
That’s why you gotta think tactically and get to a good shooting position before they arrive. But you’re right, it’s not the best idea anybody’s ever heard.
---
Tried this suggested method too. Run to a checkpoint activate and then have to wait for a horrendously long time for some bar to fill up before I can move on. Then same at the second sync local. I was bored with this after my I ran out of the 40 atoms and my 4th piece of armor broke. 
---
Some are saying they foolishly released the worst one first? If the other two have the same mechanic it just seems lame. 
---
Btw: I run the borrows all the time, so I also had the advantage of knowing the layout and it probably wouldn't have been half as bad if not for the No bash in vats/vats toggle/vats exit problem, but games of tag are not what I play video games for, especially MMORPGs I want to kill a section and move on.
---
Edit: I have seen this mechanic pulled off successfully by many other games, this was not it.
---
Ran through Daily Ops several times today on Xbox... didn’t have any issues
---
The problem with this perk that it is a waste on your main character. I mean you dont need to craft tons of ammo everyday. But you always wants extra special points. So the best way is to take it on the second character and craft ammo when you need it.
---
They dont want creatures dying fast. They want them to take time to kill . People complain if they die too fast and dont tag them, people complain if they take too long to kill. Honestly the updates great, it makes the game feel more difficult then it was.. and the loot seems better.
---
Tabs or sheets my man? I’ll let you buy it.
---
I'm not talking about "can be but don't  have to be" I'm talking about the literal number of maximum possible points you should have available.  If someone has respeced that's not something my formula can account for and would have to be handled on an individual basis.
---
And no... the last time I checked I had not respeced my character one hundred and twenty five times.
---
Yeah I fucked it up hard and then figured it out by the end of the round but not before I drained all my supplies and then I went to complain about it but after reading on it realized I was the one messing up xD just gotta learn not to use stimpaks and just die instead
---
Know what’s worse than level 50 mole rats? Level 100 mole rats. How did anyone think that super-bullet-sponge mole rats would be fun?
---
They are some tough assholes, that’s for sure. (They didn’t like me even before One Wasteland.) 
---
One day The Edge build will become the go-to for taking out bears. (I hope I’m not the only one that gets that joke.)
---
Oh that was a great read, almost spat out my morning coffee a few times cause it was so hilarious. My experience was not as pleasant lol
---
I went down there with my bloodied stealth commando girl and was all alone. I thought: The fuck is noone here in an event thats part of todays daylies?! Gahh! Well, nvm. 
---
I started to look around and at the first corner immediatelly took a beam to my face. After that a few gutsy rails to the knee. Ngl, that dropped me pretty fast in my wood armor. Whoopsie daisy, should better use my stealth i guess.
---
So i go into stealth mode and approach that same corner. That gonna teach them! But this time those fuckers are even pouring thru that dam gateway, breaking my stealth instantly and shred my ass like its the last day of summer sale. I remembered i read something on Reddit about stealth getting kinda deactivated in those events (?).
---
So it looks like they wanna go? OH they wanna GO!! Alright asshats! So i pull out my legacy weapon i keep for wtf moments and this time i RUN to that corner.
---
Im yelling "ARE YOU FUCKING SORRY?!" while firing the first shots to their faces. But they're not going down. And instead of shooting me down, they decide to hover over and sawblade me to my death this time.
---
It was this moment i noticed i fucked up and didn't read the description properly. So i packed my things for that day and for my part decided to come back tomorrow with 3 new ideas!
---
Improvise. Adapt. Overcome.
---
What kind of effects can cause this?
---
It is thinked to be a full squad event, believe me i tried solo in my first ops, 26 minutes.
---
I owe my soul to the company store!!!
---
Can confirm, the plans can be sold in vendors
---
I died alot too till I started moving more defensive perks back into my build.
---
Pistols and daggers took a major hit with the rebalance, but if we make some  noise hopefully that can be the next major step they look into adapting. 
---
I wouldn't mind my daggers causing less than half damage compared to gauntlets if they didn't need 3 times the perks to only be that feeble. Feels like they got the 2 backwards.  The weapon with the most perks dedicated to it should be causing the greater damage. 
---
Maybe if they at least adapted them to use like half the AP on VATs, a higher base damage while stealthed, or even faster reload/ swing speed, something of  interest that would allow them to be more competitive.
---
I especially love the cultists dagger because it goes so well with my characters aesthetics (outfit and camp wise) really saddened to see it become a tool for tickling.
---
I def recommend approaching giving these 2 weapon types some love first with the next major update.
---
Then the explosive weapons next.
---
Rilly do want to see every one rocking totally different types of weapons and everyone getting to feel uniquely powerful in their own way.
---
What about Master Infiltrator?
---
I used to be an adventurer like you, once. Then I took an arrow to the knee.
---
Are you high? Being able to use your gun as intended is not an extraneous feature.
---
That's completely fine. But why should the rest of the player community revolve around min maxers? I understand that nerfing op builds like bloodied are in need, because it's absolutely ridiculous seeing every third player run a bloodied build. That's just simply uncreative and made me stop playing the game. Now with the One Wasteland update... I don't know if I can come back to it.
---
The exploration in FO4 and FO76 are far, far better than in the previous two. There's no comparison. I didn't personally find the decisions in 3 and NV that compelling, but then maybe I value other things more.
---
Think I miss replied to a comment somewhere in here.   XD
---
Vampires and quad seems to be the way now haha! Thanks for sharing my man!
---
Did you have any Workshop copied ammo converters?
---
This. Also dying down there has zero consequences. I usually stay looting until the mine comes down on me.
---
Might have to make a melee build. Fuck Bloodied commando, I only like it for PvP anyway. If you’re gonna PvE, do it properly and destroy it with 50k damage a - oh. We can’t do that now! Let’s do 5 damage a hit!
---
Lvl 50 ticks that take 20 rounds of .50 cal with armor pen. Thats not balanced. Good attempt but no.
---
Last time people wore something called "black SS uniforms" Heinrich Himmler was a living man. Probably ain't the best idea.
---
Nah. Casual players exist, man.
---
Yeah I ran vamps threw the whole daily ops. And pulled out my j for the boss. Glad I did cuz we finished at 7:59 haha
---
Such a bummer! Picking the "free" 3 notes every day was a daily routine for me. Log in, go pick the notes from Ward, look at quest log and decide what to do next... It felt like a reward for just logging in every day. Maybe they should add that to the game as a real thing? An NPC that gives you 3 notes every day.
---
I'll also miss the fast reloads on the LMG... Oh well... Let's see what new bugs are there now :)
---
Damn, did you use atoms to get that far?
---
I’m going to assume this was directed at me lol.
---
I’ve always ran incisor at rank 3 anyways
---
So what you're saying is you are using a gun with a higher base damage. And still using more rounds to kill something.
---
So yes you are doing something wrong. If you don't have a solid build how do you expect to kill stuff efficiently?
---
Me and 3 other just put power armour ignored the bots mostly and just ran through it to the end.
---
Yes thats what Im seeing too (bar Daily OPs with the "lol nope no stealth allowed" mechanic). Thats requiring a bit of a defensive skill rethink - handy that the new Legend SPECIAL cards now exist. 
---
But West-Tek super mutants are dying in 2 to 3 headshots, rather than 1. 
---
Thats with a 1star bloodied Handmade, Max Rifle perks, Max tank killer, Max concentrated fire, Max Bloodied Mess, 4 in Adren, Max covert operative.
---
I was a bit surprised by the L100 mutant hounds. I also lost a lot of stealth but I gather that unequipping and re-equipping the old perks fixes that.
---
False. Stop spreading misinformation.
---
That's how it has been.
---
Awesome. Thanks!
---
Have you tried replacing your camp?
---
u/Valseek
---
That’s the thing. It *is* solid. It was one shotting literally any non boss mob I came across and players didn’t stand a chance. Even my BE laser rifle barely tickles stuff now.
---
Yeah I feel like they also turned the enemy spawn up to the max they are every where. Did encrypted and there were so many bots I could even move past them.
---
And how did it work out for you?
---
It was stupid to have level 50 bot flies floating around and now you have that sort of thing all the time.
---
I think there are two mindsets here. Those who don't care about the game or world and just care about optimization and crunching numbers. They don't care where they are, they just want varieties of harder enemies.
---
Then there are players invested in the game world and the storyline, for whom it doesn't make sense to not have varied difficulties in different areas and different sorts of threats. For these players this change has taken much of the charm and immersion away.
---
no more feeling like i am wading through sludge navigating the scoreboard!!
---
Shotguns are better!!
---
Level 70 - 100 enemies everywhere!!!
---
Super Mutants are tankier!!!
---
MORE BULLETS TO SHOOT!!!
---
LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
I super dig the revive in armour one.
---
Dude same
---
I'm unarmed bloodied. While my damage numbers per hit certainly dropped, I went from 1-2 shotting enemies, to 2-4 shotting them.
---
And honestly? It's not really a different play experience other than "Oh, I have to hit you twice before I move on? Okay." Survivability was always key. My high lvl character could sometimes die when I didn't see enemies or rads surprised me, but damage wasn't the issue.
---
I spent an 1 1/2 doing this only for it to fail due to the final enemy getting jammed in a wall. Like far jammed so I couldnt even hit him.
---
Shit
---
And no easy way to get a public squad
---
Oh hell yes. I think that’s what keeps me coming back. I also enjoy the base building aspect of 76. It’s funny because I do play this game more than I played any of the other games and my kids are always like “what do you do in this game? You always do the same things.” But that makes me feel like the designers are manipulating me to play more. Like those worldbuilding online game apps. You know the ones.
---
Cant remember where the last 3 points went. And my build is all SS armor with +1STR, deathclaw gauntlet exterminators swing speed.
---
I dont think it was changed all that much. Yea my weapon says it only deals 200 damage instead of its 400+ pre patch but im just not seeing anything different while playing. 
---
Im dealing about the same damage to enemies level 60 and below but anything above that requires 2 to 5 hits. Level 100 boss enemies are lots tankier and scorchbeast take about 10 hits.
---

---
I actually found it extremely easy. But its definitely not for everyone. I had trouble by myself alone so I gave up until I found randoms to do it. The randoms were kind of dead weight as they had no idea what to do but I found them useful to offload some of the robos. 
---
What worked for me was I put power armor on that I just carry with me. I am not a power armor build so I usually try to never put it on but this was an exception cause I was getting absolutely destroyed. Lo and behold I just sat there right on the links tanking the damage. I didnt understand why 6 robots were busting my ass without power armor but as soon as I put it on I just completely ignored the game except to stimpack. I used maybe 20 stimpacks though.  It was as if they were just flys swatting at me it was really weird.
---
I think it’s hilarious the fckers nerfed our weapons made enemies stronger and took our ammo glitch and what did they give us back a bunch of cosmetic crap now we run out of bullets before the enemies dead example I hit a super mutant four shots he’s dead with my ghoul slayer explosive now it takes seven or eight and then I run ecripted watch some douche come alone hit wit two shots and kill sheepsquatch
---
Overall very good but the combat still needs some major tweaks. Fights like Earle haven't changed too much but you have to put 30 rounds from God tier weapons into a lvl 50 tick spawning in the forest is a bit overkill. Manageable as a high level player with a versatile build but i hear a lot of lower levels having issues doing literally anything because everything is now a bullet sponge.
---
If you can’t handle the heat, stay out of the kitchen. 
---
No you can’t have a full mag. Reload. 
---
Signed,
---
A man who soloed Elder tier on day one in less than ten tries. And he’s not even a OP bloodied build.
---
Considering you can switch out the perks for 1 coin, this doesn’t make sense. People could just switch them out once their camp is set for another perk. Besides, I understand the budget limit is a restriction based on the games ability to place your camp, for lack of an actual explanation, which I think is similar to our restriction on stash space. 
---
Someone also already mentioned, we’re getting private/public instances at our camps like bunkers that will have a separate, much bigger building budget.
---
What changed since patch? Im yet to do it after the patch.
---
Do it, we dont want quitters that stop playing when the game gets more challenging
---
Definitely the glitch, i forgot how to do it purposely but one time i had over 400 shots in my fixer, it was amazing.
---
I've switched from an instigating level to an anti-armour lever that used to be my go-to for SBQs / Earle (as instigating is no help against stuff that stays in the fight longer than one-shot). Haven't had to make any other changes (though I wasn't running bloodied!).  
---
I've got a full-health VATS rifleman, so maxed riles, max adrenaline, max concentrated fire, max tank killer, max bloodied mess, max covert operation, plus some crit enhancement perks - max critical savvy, max grim reaper's sprint and 1 rank in better criticals (because the lever has +50% criticals already).  
---
I'm still genning crits every 2/3 shots and with the AA my damage is pretty close to pre-Nerf. Armor penetration seems to matter way more this patch, which I like.  
---
Once I've got endurance and strength legendaries full upgraded, I'm expecting to end up pretty tanky.
---
Then what ? Bloodied commando is still strong in open world, yes you cannot use it with stealth in daily ops, welle change your build mate. Use a full health build, find a new weapon, play at 50 or 75% health instead of 20...
---
Any game can have these huge balance updates that can see a meta shift. One in a while that's good for both the economy and the players.
---
You went balls deep in bloodied commando style as I did. Now I am a junky full health in PA, I still have just 9 STR and 9PER and I am doing fine soloing the new daily. See ? It is possible dude.
---
Yes you are no longer a god who one or two shot anything that moves. Adapt, change your build and you still can be.
---
I hope theyre listening to us wanting for 3star legendaries to drop 3 star legendary weapons
---
I’m dreading getting on. There’s a pack of mirelurks that spawn in my camp every time I travel there and I was wasting enough resources repairing my turrets every so often, if I’m going to have to do it every time then there’s no point in getting on. I would move to get away from them but it’s a really good spot
---
With my first attempt was rocking a bloodied, faster swing speed, cultist dagger, and was rushing so fast I didn't get much time to loot my ammo. What little I did get was a weird mixed bag due to using just a melee weapon.
---
Was alot of fun tho, and even lower level players get to feel useful too!
---
What rads if you arent a low health build is awesome. I will probably never use a radaway again.
---
I'm level 32. I don't have legendary perks. And I didn't pick up perks outside of shotgun stuff each level. Then only other stuff I have available is what I get in the booster packs every few levels, which has been limited to crap like dromedary or good with salt. Not very helpful with a pack of now-level 32 super mutants that used to take 2 shots to kill
---
My bloodied melee build is kicking ass, especially in daily ops with that melee kill thing.. having 15 strength and 15 endurance with the legendary perk cards help!
---
My bloodied commando builds are struggling more. Used to do 100+ dmg per shot to the SBQ now doing 14!!!
---
I already use it for a year. Another pc upside
---
That explains it.
---
When has it ever been rare? Especially with dupers.
---
It’s ok, friend. I care about you.
---
Haven't been able to get on yet, but this is making me feel extra glad that my camp seems to be in a place where most enemies never find their way to. I've had a total of about 3 packs of enemies attack me in a couple tens of hours that my camp has existed in its current location.
---
Nuclear Winter Weaopons are Weapons that were obtainable for a short period of time by using an glitch in a workshop. You had to put weapons into a workshop container (icebox/cigarette machine etc) and scrap the container. The weapons moved into your stashbox and there was a chance that this weapons got mods from Nuclear Winter. The weapons got scaled down to their lowest level and had better stats like crafted ones, The laser for example is lvl 5 with 800 range, 380 damage and an infinite magazine.
---
It's no longer a game where you can relax on one side of the map and go look for a challenge on the other. 
---
Its now a challenge everywhere.   Overnight it turned into  dark souls where I expect to die around every corner:(
---
Damage*
---
Title typo
---
I was keeping an eye on my weapon ammo in the HUD. When I reloaded it adjusted accordingly until my character was scared off. I’ve been going to lucky hole and the other hot spots for lead weights in private servers for a while. I just hate to see all that lead wasted. 
---
Also I haven’t gotten to the legendary perks yet! I’ve seen them but haven’t unlocked any yet, I’ve been slacking I suppose.
---
Can you drop favorite items? I thought you can't
---
This was a really really bad combo to introduce these to the world. I don't know what they were thinking but yikes. Breaking entire builds just to add fake "challenge" is a really stupid design decision but only because they have YET to give us a PROPER RESPEC system to make it actually fun. Changing up builds is a fucking chore still and they've done nothing about it.
---
A new level 20 player doesn't have a Bloodied weapon, OR the perks to not just fall over as that build.
---
"Billion bots" can confirm try encrypted I couldn't move for how many bots there were. Think they have also turned the spawn rate up to max too. At one point I couldn't see anything but bots covering my entire screen that's not right. Oh and the fuxking lag now is unreal.
---
Yep, I ran 3 today. 1 solo 2 with groups. Got absolutely fucking destroyed solo, like embarrassingly shit on. 
---
2 times with groups neither of them were at the uplinks. Fyi uplinks get bonus based off of when you're with your team mates sitting near them. If it wasn't for these clowns not knowing what to do (it tells you) would've easily beaten it in the elder or whatever the best status is. 
---
I do not ever recommend someone does this solo unless they're god tiered.
---
Most other games (not MMO) you are the single player who solos the final boss. I understand that most MMOs are different, but the Wasteland is different as well. You should have the opportunity for team, factions, clans, and the lone Wastelander. That’s what makes this game, potentially, so awesome. You can pick a track and have it be viable. However, this nerf killed it and that ammo consumption is insane.
---
I’m considering switching to a 50. I just haven’t found a good legendary like the 5mm I have.
---
You boutta catch these Railway spikes
---
Given the number of people here who seem to get off on downvoting as many posts as possible, maybe not pay attention to downvoting?   Idiots and nasty people will always behave like the people they are.
---
I can't see myself doing one of these unless an established teammate wants to do it or until the community learns how to do it more widely.
---
I'm not sure about the whole update.  Like you, one of the biggest reasons I play is to unwind and relax.   I like calm spiked with moments of intensity; not intensity 100 percent of the time.    We'll see.
---
Was just there and there was a 3 way tag team match between radstag, mirelurk and snallygaster. Guess who won?
---
Completely agree. Complaints are from players who are either noobs, permanoobs, or just haven't obtained/grinded decent gear yet. When they do they will see how stupid their whine is.
---
My 3*junkies ss +1str sheep staff went from 693 base damage to like 370. Dafuq, seriously.
---
On both my 100+ characters I had a blast. Still going for max rep so that new free fast travel was godsend. On my alt that’s level 30 however was a real pain, leveling is too slow and everything is tanky.
---
The one that gives you +40% damage?
---
I'm level 130 only because I play since beginning, But i'm not an expert
---
I played usually in the east zone
---
yesterday I used all my stimpack in Morgantown airport
---
those zombies that were level 1 monday, now they are dangerous as scorchbeast!!!
---
You scrap the spare cards, 2 coins per card
---
Sheep is a nightmare. Did they turn the spawn rate up room cause there were so many bots all max level and I couldn't even move. Just kept getting stuck.
---
Don’t speak for all of us; I’m a stealth non-bloodied rifle build and I alternate between hits on the boss, taking out the mobs for those who can do more damage than me/those who need to get hits in, and running for whoever’s downed. I am a team player, and that doesn’t mean just the three others on my actual team, but everyone participating in the event. 
---
Thats how I like to play. Thats what I enjoy.
---
And I know many others who do the same.
---
But what I experienced today was not enjoyable. It was me struggling to even keep *myself* alive against these stronger creatures who were spawning in bigger mobs (anyone else notice this?) with weapons I had spent so much time and effort getting now doing a pitiful amount of damage against them, and my sneak not working the way it was supposed to. (Yes, outside Ops. I don’t even want to talk about Ops.)
---
76 is how I destress. Today, it was the cause of it. And that was frustrating and a bit sad, truth be told. I think they should have done either the weapon nerf or the enemy lvl increase, but not both at once. Just too much all at once.
---
Just the lower weapon damage and higher health of AI’s.  I used to craft 150 40mm grenades for my launcher, now I need 300.  It’s the same event, same rewards, takes much longer and more resources now.  It is work, not play.  Be ready to work when you go in there.
---
If you want to delete the game just do so and don’t comment trying to get attention
---
No, I didn't unlock the windmill until way later and mine works as a generator. Perhaps try deleting it and replacing it? It didn't work as a generator the first time I put one down but did the second. 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
I agree I actually love it so much. And the ops are just too good. I actually made a step by step guide on making it easier to work as a team and survive the operations. Just go to my profile and check it out
---
Im at 87 and i also 1-2 shotet any non boss enemies before with my double barrel, not anymore after the patch.
---
No idea. Those people downvoting don’t seem to have a croc backpack yet, though :) also at the moment there are no easily exploitable dupes (as far as I know at least)
---
Hm..maybe just increase the cap of enemies in certain areas but not all the way to 50. Whatever they gotta do to fix it. My friend is only level 22 and he’s living a miserable existence right now because his skills are scattered. At least before you could experiment to see what fit you best until you figure it out. Now you have to know how you want to level up before you even leave the Vault if you’re a new player. 
---
But I will say, I’m not hating the update. I haven’t had any significant increase in difficulty and I’m running my casual build. It just sucks for new players.
---

Could you share your build?
---
I agree: I really like the patch. I'm not a very optimized build - I swap between melee with a bloodied sledgehammer and a heavy weapons TSE Gatling Gun. I prefer the heavy weapons, but I don't like that I have to use stabilize (meaning PA) to do enough dmg.
---
Bloodied is definitely weaker - I now usually need 3 hits to kill a regular enemy (they're all level 70-100 for me as far as I have noticed).
---
I noticed a couple things:
---
1) dmg rubber banding seems much less on my gatling gun. I do much more consistent dmg with it and I definitely kill faster. 
---
2) I tested my Furious LMG and it seems weaker. Rubber banding was so bad on it, (before patch 22), you had to hold fire until the target was dead - otherwise it took tons of ammo to kill anything. The rubber banding is much improved but oddly it doesn't kill as fast.
---
3) legendary perks made a huge difference. At level 150 I was able to let me tank and still do dmg. I picked up more resistances with my free perk slots.
---
4) I use about twice as much ammo, now. I have no problem keeping 5mm flowing, though. I have not tried Earle, however. I'm going to have to take ammofactory perk next.
---
5) I love infiltrator! I hated wasting pts on them but I was too lazy to swap often while playing. It's a huge quality of life bonus where one legendary made 6 perk cards obsolete.
---
6) Experience gains are much higher. I got 4 levels today - usually I get 1, maybe 2. I think it's one wasteland - evertlything I fight is higher level ans therefore gives more exp (I think).
---
I was gonna rank 4 the "follow through" perk card but I decided to keep it at rank 3 and use the 150 perk coins I had left to rank up agility perception and luck one more time.
---
I choose max rank strength as I moved 4 points of strength into perception to boost it up 11, perception rank 2, agility rank 3 ,and luck rank 3, the last card is for +50 poison resistance which gives me 75 resistance now.
---
Originally I had planned to make luck strength and agility 15 but I didn't have enough perk coins so I'm off by 1 point on each but that's ok I got everything to work as I had planned originally. My coop buddy choose the ammo factory perk and power armor perks so I give him the materials an he crafts the ammo.
---
Totally agree I made post on here and YouTube about it. 
---
1 Release One wasteland, see how builds are dealing with it.
---
2 Rebuff and sort out useless Legendary prefixes so every build is viable. 
---
3 Then and only then rebalance.
---
This isn't an MMO.
---
I honestly do. 
---
It sounds like you’ve had a hard time figuring out how to do Uplink. Here’s a few hints.
---
Use something Vampires that shoots fast. Handmade, heavy gun. Anything that’ll give you health while you do the next step.
---
Stand right next to the Uplink and do not even think about running around and killing. Save that for when you finish. If something gets close enough you won’t lose a signal boost, kill it, but stay in that radius and keep shooting stuff. You won’t die. I promise. 
---
As soon as you see that little hologram peep in, RUN for the next objective and do not look back no matter what. 
---
Once you get to the last objective, kill the group as quickly as possible. If you have good survivability, pull out your highest DPS weapon and UNLOAD that motherfucker into the Leader. If not good survivability, unload the same Vampire’s weapon into the Leader. It’ll be slower but if you’ve done well running, you’ll make under 8 minutes solo. 
---
This is the part where you can kill the other stuff. Don’t open the after action report till you’ve killed everything and looted all the contextual ammo.
---
Incorrect again, it does work - with melee equipped. Dont spread misinformation.
---
It's just downvoting ,not really nasty imo.
---
I also like to play this game to unwind. If I get killed doing an activity plenty of times in a row I go and do something else then come back.
---
It does seem like a steep learning curve for these daily ops though. As you said ,we'll see.
---
yeah. great update. loving it.
---
google angry turtle magic weapons, he has a few youtube videos on it.  This shit should have been fixed 6+ months ago it's embarrassing for them.
---
You know that's *always* on right?
---
Im a hybrid build (unarmed and heavy gunner) i scrapped my heavy gunner side of my build so I could get max rank Charisma legendary perk so I could share higher level perk cards. Turns out i can't even though it says ive got 9 charisma.
---
I don’t want to one shot the hardest non boss mob around, I just don’t want to have to put 100 rounds into it to kill it for a 1* legendary armor piece. And die six times while I’m at it. With all the damage mitigation perks.
---
While I wouldn’t have the heart to change my extremely non-optimal PA rifleman, this option would be nice. Only way I could see this working is nukashine kicked up to eleven with stable flux of every type, plus an expensive bottle only obtainable from vendors that somehow makes you break back into vault 76. Once inside, you’d do your respec of all special stats and cards up to your level (though perhaps it would just show all cards in a library to speed things up).
---
And then you’d walked back out.
---
Took the SPECIAL agility and luck cards to three stars so that I could equip another regular perk card in each.   Put an additional star on two others.   Poison stayed at one because that's all that's needed apparently.   Last slot is empty because I can't decide between ammofactory and SPECIAL perception.   I need both badly, so I'll let gameplay tell me which one to take in a couple of weeks or so.  
---
May have taken Followthough to three stars too.   Can't really remember right now.
---
I’ve been playing for 3333 hours and they ain’t that rare.....
---
Same here
---
Yeah, I really want SPECIAL Perception, but hearing stories like that in your last sentence....   really may need that Ammofactory.
---
Lol. I lost my sense of humor about Bethesda's ability to improve anything especially protect honest players.
---
Another tip. Find the side room at each uplink that you can hide in and hug the wall while still on the uplink. Enemies singke file into the room making it lots easier.
---
[Here you go.](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=c589c64&amp;d=xa2x72x83x01x20xe0sb2s22p01eo2ek1eu0e00em0c12cd1ce0ic4ib3s12ir2a72as2sd2so2sp2pc2lu2la2l12cf2&amp;m=51c29fb6i&amp;am=182a32-102732-182735-172a31-172731&amp;wp=w9&amp;wm=1a2934) I haven't maxed out all the legendary perks yet so it's a work-in-progress. But this is what I feel extremely comfortable with.
---
I run Gauss Shotgun with a full set of Secret Service armor. I primarily use VATS for shotty and mostly run in and jump around to dodge danger. Sometimes I switch to Gauss Minigun, Plasma Caster or my awesome explosive flamer. This build is 100% interchangable with heavy guns. Hope it helped.
---
Hardly any difference in damage, my bloodied explosive handmade went from 347 to 205. Still kicks ass........
---
I downvoted this. :P
---
Totally agree something needed to be done. But they should of buff all other builds and sorted the useless prefixes out so every build was viable. Then release one wasteland, see how easy or hard the build are finding the new difficulty. Then balance from there. Way they have done it now is just idiotic.
---
Ok ok we get it ... but I do agree that if you fail plenty of times in a row perhaps doing something else and then coming back to it with a fresh mind is in order.
---
That's how I play this game anyway but that might not work for everyone.
---
No need to be a jerk though;)
---
50% is way to extreme.. now everyone has to waste more ammo.. now earl requires those legacy weapons  to die.. my gaus mini gun was doing 4damage.. heavy weapons arent good unless you 3star all the heavy gunner cards even then they use up way more ammo. Mele weapons are kinda useless now .. hope you like loosing over 900dmg from the nerf mole miner gauntlets dont do 1k anymore.. fatmans are still showin well over 3k damage but thats a lie.. um what else .. pistols arent good same with 44magnums.. these builds have been tested by the 1 and only captain noob on youtube. Hes right now all the damage you could be doing isnt possible.. they ruined the damage.. they didnt even think about other players.. They just nerfed weapons instead of properly balancing guns.
---
Yeah I did that to a few of my older cards i no longer use. I'm referring to perk card packs that haven't been opened and the level ups you get just for gaining levels. As far as i could see the only way to redeem those is to select a perk then scrap it. Unless i missed something
---
That escalated quickly 😅
---
I hear you....
---
Every single MMO I played, when doing as drastic changes as this, gave at least 1 free respec to every character, and most of them implemented a system to buy respecs after the first one...
---
And that incluses TESO
---
well ok then ;) kind of went looking for it didnt I ?
---
it's a godsend. 😭
---
Yes you can. Dying is based on a shitty build.😂
---
Keep downvoting the obvious, I love it 🤔😉😂
---
They got rid of that mechanic weeks ago on the PTS because people were saying it encouraged scrapping of animated cards which people didn't like.
---
Which are all useless anyway because of this new damage calculation.
---
I’ve played with my rifleman today, and I’ve been fine using sneak and my instigating lever.
---
Super mutants are still being one shot if I do a sneak attack in the head from a relatively close distance, and the closest scare I’ve had was when I accidentally got too close to a group of mirelurks, and even then, I had enough time to hop in my PA and pull out my furious gauss to finish the job.
---
Note: I had a friend help with the daily ops, because I knew I wouldn’t be getting through there in time for the elder rank.
---
The humanity, amirite? Lol
---
I like this idea...
---
Today's was the worst combination. Burrows is confusing, robot's are broken powerful and melee finisher is rough. Chin up, everything else is better:)
---
Im actually running out of them floater grenades. Im loving i now have a use for them.
---
They still do shit damage so im just tossing them like crazy.
---
I'm loving it, I could shred the mutants at west tek and white spring ghouls and all that pretty quick and now it's a bit more of a fight. I'm glad the game is becoming more challenging and giving players more of a fight. This might sound insensitive, but I have no sympathy for the people who put their camps in places enemies spawn or spawn near and are now complaining about getting killed in camp. You've placed your home in a hostile area, you can't be surprised that when the game scales them up to adjust to your level, you get murdered by them. Dont put your camp in a hostile area ya ding dongs
---
This is working exactly as it states on the card, so why would you think Bethesda should be made more aware of it?
---
I get the fact that something actually working as intended seems a little odd for FO76, but here is proof occasionally they can get things right.
---
Deal with it....
---
Yeah, it's so horrible ! Lol
---
I mean this is a Fallout sub. This game has dumbed everyone down because you’re not required to think at all.
---
As someone who isn't max level yet, I was already having a tough time with certain "beefy" enemies. Typically Yao Guai, Radscorpions, and Deathclaws take a lot of cheese for me to kill, because with what perks I have, I really only can do damage with my shotgun and rifle.
---
Now those enemies are a death sentence, because they're all level 32 and have scaled HP/armor that just feels impossible to chew through. Leaving Crater yesterday, I ran into a pack of Yao Guai. I already never engaged more than one of those things at a time, but for some reason I tried taking a pop shot at one while sneaking with my rifle (so far I only have Rifleman 3 and some sneak damage perks). I did *maybe* 1/30 of its health with that shot.
---
Nope.
---
This did happen to me on PTS once (out of maybe 15 ops runs), the bar just would not progress any further. Seems to be a (rare?) bug so just leave if it happens. When site b is done you have to fight a group of enemies and a final boss at another location, but I guess you already know that by now :-)
---
So many Dwight Shrute's in here saying "False" without even trying or investigating. Or even saying anything different from the other "Shrutes". So, as it turns out, it DOES work with a melee weapon equipped (this game is magical, isn't it?). So, what did the Shrutes learn today?
---
Ammo factory and the regular ammo perk make ammo literally fall out of your butt lol idk why you think ammo is hard to get unless you're just not using the perks intended solely on boosting ammo output
---
Sometimes if your really struggling higher lvls will help. I've had low lvls see my 325 character and message me asking for a handmade or some ammo and i try and do what i can, for the most part the fo76 Xbox community is more them willing to legend a helping hand.
---
I saw one about 10 minutes ago. (I think) i didn't stop to use it.
---
[Here](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=c589c64&amp;d=xa2x72x83x01x20xe0sb2s22p01eo2ek1eu0e00em0c12cd1ce0ic4ib3s12ir2a72as2sd2so2sp2pc2lu2la2l12cf2&amp;m=51c29fb6i&amp;am=182a32-102732-182735-172a31-172731&amp;wp=w9&amp;wm=1a2934)
---
Ah fuck.
---
It's not just new players. I run Bloodied (surprise, I know), and now if a Mole Rat pops up and bites me, I swear I can barely tank it, and since I have a Bloodied Gat Laser, by the time it spins up they're digging again! 
---
Guess I just have to remember to equip Blocker if I know I'm going to Mole Rat territory xD
---
What?
---
Shush! Keep that to yourself or a white knight will get it fixed, you hear me?
---
I have/used F/E LMG, I/FFR (Magic) Mini gun but I have settled on the 50 cal.  
---
With all the perks you can make 900 prime rounds a time now. I have F/E, TS/E, V/E and F/FFR.  V/E is by far the best, with the F/FFR for nuke zones or places where there are a lot of melee enemies (heart of the swamp event for example)
---
I don't do Bloodied or Junkies
---
I just bashed some radroaches to death, so.  They were lvl 50.
---
Technically you only have one choice, heavy gunner, due to ops. 
---
Great game. 10/10.
---
Extractors  ;)
---
J and B are still the kings
---
I had a spear for this when I didn’t want to waste ammo ☹️gonna have to hang it up in my camp now as a reminder of what once was.
---
Rubberbandimg has been an issue for a while.
---
its true .but its there for long time. i always shot two times to make sure npc die. Also as shotgun player rubber damage is in almost every shot and first shot has 80% chance to miss. :(
---
Really does feel like his loot table needs to be expanded on in some way. The 1 friend I run with now refuses to run earl, now that he's gotten all the rare items. 
---
I have them all too, but will continue running him for varieties sake, but I suspect that many more will just start to avoid him now that they've gained his entire loot table.
---
Especially now that there are easier ways to farm for ammo.
---
Needs a certain something that will give him more weight against the SBQs loot table.
---
Maybe some sort of rep item that can be turned in to any faction, or a chance for plans from rare events or rare outfits from all over the map. 
---
Lore wise can play it up that the wendigos have been kidnapping people from all over Appalachia.
---
Could make bloodied variants of some of the more popular cosmetic outfits. 
---
Wendigo variants of some mele weapons perhaps, or even just skins to apply to current melee weapons. And up their rarity to ensure that he stays in rotation.
---
Now this is helpful dialogue. Learning new things to try tomorrow!
---
Painful ain't it..with the new Legendary perks I've put on level 1 ground pounder as I felt no difference between 1 and 2 but it's a bit...we know what legendary star we'll be looking for even more now eh
---
Thankyou so much for making this chart!
---
Why wouldn't you just gun bash
---
I shouldn't have to Google optimized builds to play. Fallout very much since the first game has been about making the game work for the build you wanted, not forcing you to build your character a certain way. Making things bullet sponges isn't content. This overhaul has vastly altered the way the game has been played for the last two years. I'm not going to spend 15 levels trying to respec my shotgun build. I'll just move on to another game to spend my limited time on.
---
Related question but how does the excavator PA thing actually work? I tried Lucky Hole wearing a full set (normally don't use PA at all) and came out with a similar amount of ore as normal - This was pre patch, am I doing something wrong?
---
Yes it will.
---
I don't know what I would've done if I couldn't farm low level areas for mats. I was stuck during Rose's quest cuz everything was through the Divide and guarded by those god damn charred ghouls.
---
If I didn't have shit mobs to grind I have no idea how I would've progressed.
---
I mean i was pretty clear on what i plan to do about it. Look nobody wants to walk away from a game they invested time and money, but sunk cost fallacy is a thing fellas...
---
2000 from my investigating black powder.
---
I havent played yet, but I fear the worst for my bloodied shotgun build. Its going to be tough to stay alive.
---
A L I E N

BOOP BEEP BEEP BOOP BEEP

The daily ops are supposed to be challenging.  You have to use a bit of strategy and play differently in them than in any other part of the game.  If you're looking for a relaxing event that you can wind down with, maybe they're not that.  Maybe give events that pop up around the map another look instead, you can actually get good exp from the kills now even in the forest region.
---
Is it an Atom shop purchase or a reward for something?
---
you're right, the shot looks like it was made just below Codsworth's flames
---
It is...the void time streach is endless 😶
---
No, that's unfair, fallout 1st players already have giant stash space advantage than us with the scrapbox, ammo box is just taking the piss
---
Very easy for me, didn't die once.
---
I got so frustrated with this one level 65 that must have thought I was turning the sonic generator off entirely every time I silenced it. 
---
He actually angry emoted me the 3rd time he had to bounce off his catwalk to 'fix' the sonic I just muted. I just shook my head and went about the slaughter.
---
I watched people bring up game breaking issues in the first couple months, like commando receivers only getting damage perks from rifleman and they got shot down. You read that right. Rifleman. Only. On commando receivers.
---
Yeah I would have personally still saved them but I’ve got so many duplicate animated that I would actually be able to get rid of them, feels like a waste so I’m going to end up with a massive stack of them..
---
The rubberband hp still happens with my combat shotgun but in vats it kills one hit...maybe 2 .i put on legendaries and upgraded them also.i was avle to add more damage out put especially with bloody mess and tank killer maxed with all the maxed shotgun perks.
---
Reward for Season 2 that started yesterday, you could get it very early on.
---
Shotguns were the second least affected behind legacy explosives i believe
---
Neat that you're ready and willing to bend over for Bethesda, but I'd prefer to actually get the perk coins I earned.
---
I dislike the system greatly
---
Honestly i just want to see them give a hoot about their IP... the quality of this game has been notoriously bad, and for some reason it quieted down after Wastelanders... it should NOT have, it is just as broken as before.
---
They refunded my Atoms but ignored my request for a refund for Fallout 1st. It took over 3 weeks and 3 tickets to get the matter semi-resolved.
---
Ok so that makes your final figure of what you think you're owed inaccurate. X = points I could potentially use to buy cards. It is made up of Xa = points I've earned - Xb = points I've used to respec.
---
Who are you to tell anyone how they should play the game or do an event or run their build? People aren’t going to not hit the boss so that people like you can wipe it out and take the xp and rewards. 🙄 Everyone can work together and do what needs to be done, be it hitting the boss, dealing with the mobs, or stimming people.
---
Came Here to say this, so many of these posts complaining about things have no idea what those of us who've been playing since beta have dealt with. Is it a perfect game? No. Have they made a lot of great improvements? Most definitely.
---
Wow, literally nothing worth getting. 
---
Nice.
---
I guess I’ve never noticed it with melee before. I typically one shot everything before the nerf.
---
If it actually registers your hit, it will kill them.
---
That was the original idea: animated cards were meant to be worth more coin.  A lot more.  However, since we didn't know they would be worth more, some players may have simply used them to upgrade rather than upgrading the animated card.  Feedback from PTS killed off the idea.
---
I maxed out hack and slash.
---
It was a bit underwhelming but does proc often.
---
Tho only really leads to maybe 1-2 more mobs going down occasionally in tight quarters. 
---
Is kind of hilarious seeing the ragdolls being launched to the stratosphere tho. Even more so if a buddy is using an explosive weapon too.
---
everyone expected post like this 🤣 .. actually when you read or try something yourself , you can do new content easy (even without changing build). But no, better is cry here.
---
Use the ammo factory perk and level it up.makes tons of ammo.also stack with ammo smith to double it.
---
This will definitely come in handy in a pinch when I'm pushing my max limit with just general items, etc on my character. Good find and thanks for the heads up!
---
I just became a stealth sniper today (thank you, legendary agility for allowing me to finally get those perks), and I wasn’t having a problem with super mutants in the bog, divide (Huntersville) and mire at level 260 something.
---
I know I’m doing less damage, but it’s still tolerable. My headshots are still managing to one shot the mutants, even if I do need to be relatively close to them.
---
Jumping around near the uplink, not engaging works for me. Marsupial+ strange in numbers = boooiiiinnnngggggg
---
To be somewhat fair. Flying creatures break my melee build because I cant hit them. But yea they kind of ruined stealth builds completely. And a fair few things in daily ops goes against stealth players (most builds will have something to complain about) but i don't see the need for no stealth at all in these.
---
They actually won't die till you hit them. One bump with your rifle is all it takes.
---
Only looked around for a little bit after updating but really enjoy the legendary perks and the mob levels, love the extra challenge. I actually failed an event yesterday and haven’t done that in AGES.
---
Only con is I’d moved my camp somewhere low level so it wouldn’t get too damaged without any turrets but that’s moot now so I’ve had to put more on than usual 😂
---
Oh no! Did they kill his soooothing voice?
---
Don't know why your getting downvotes, fallout 1st players are too soft, they get an unlimited weight free scrap box and still want more. 90% of my stash weight is scrap.
---
You’re not, I promise. The loudest folks are always the unhappy ones, for whatever reason they’re unhappy.
---
They did... only if we complete the Armor Aces board 🤬
---
Instigating is a magic effect for shotguns, and im still oneshot most mobs with my instigating combat shotgun, what im doing wrong? Why lie about 8 rounds
---
We have talent points. People like you are telling us where we have to spend them. What’s the point of giving us a choice of how to build our character if there’s actually no choice?
---
Thanks! Very helpful indeed mate. For i am using pretty much the same stuff. But may i ask: I guess you're using an UNY SS set. You said you're almost as durable as a vanguard build. Are you using a cavallier set over a sentinel one then cause you're moving around so much?
---
Hopefully, else I’ll need to try and get one off of someone as I’m pretty sure they’re tradeable, at least to vendors
---
System? 
---
At least on PS4 I never got the feeling it was a race to kill. Just aim my exploding handmade at the ground and open up when they drop. I'm not trying to tag all of them, just clearing out efficiently. 
---
I glitched the event personally about 4 times and ran it another dozen or so the last month and nobody ever tossed a single grenade or used a tesla either. 
---
Maybe I was just lucky.
---
the best kind of correct
---
This isn’t the main bos update though, the roadmap says this is just like the start, the main story comes out hopefully before the end of the year
---
Let me make this clearer for you.
---
I. HAVE. NEVER. USED. ANY. POINTS. TO. RESPEC.
---
No shit if someone else out there has used their points to respec they'd need to adjust the formula to fit their situation.  I have not used any points.  I'm still fucking missing all of them anyway.  Just admit you fucked up when you decided to chime in that perk points can't magically turn into perk coins and walk away.
---
Usually have problems with people stealing my bone chimes, tricking me onto thinking I had a bit of build space when I shouldn't.
---
Noticed they were gone again today and was going to just use that space to place the mew weight bench down.
---
But alas that budget space was gone. Or is the weight bench over budgeted?
---
Hopefully sorta itself out in a couple days.
---
Unequip and reequip your stealth perks
---
I feel ya. I grinded to level up so I can one shot enemies. I don’t want to have to go into area that’s once had low level baddies to find a level 50 radroach. I don’t want a constant battle.
---
Umm... where is the minus calculation to account for the perks you've slotted into your build? 
---
It doesn't suddently balance the amounts but between your potential for switch up specials and the bug that makes you lose duplicate cards from packs, that's at least within the ballpark of where you should be.
---
Most of the complaints just see to be "game too hard now, Im uninstalling" lmao I'm genuinely confused. I'm happy everything will be more of a challenge and am looking forward to getting into it all. Idk why people want it to be so easy
---
Well, that doesn't have the satisfying feel of: I brought a knife to a gun fight and won.
---
yeah. did it solo in 8 minutes from 2nd try just after server went up after p22 release (that was camo blood eagles in the gallery). Of course, i ran with T65 set with emergency protocols + bloodied gauss minigun (still providing ok damage output after rebalance) and it was very-very easy (but keep in mind - you should act very precisely - after activating event go strictly to one point, activate and defend, then strictly to another, also defend, always stay in proximity to keep objective progression on 1x speed, then go to kill marked creatures, kill boss, --&gt; profit. Dont waste time to deal with enemies on the way between objectives, dont leave objective to kill hiding enemies, dont get lost into location - and you will end event in ~7 minutes or so). If there is no unkillable-with-ranged-weapons robots - everything is soloable very easily, and even if such robots are there - its managable: tested with the same build ~hour ago - just hold on and tank incoming damage (with emergency protocols and nerd rage active + lone wanderer - even stack of robots cannot kill you enough quickly - eat stimpacks once in 20-30 sec, or use some vampiric weapon and everything will be more than ok), damage robots with minigun, kill with supersledge if they going to close combat, skip if they are staying in range - completed ops in 10 minutes because just lost in burrows tunnels. Actually, i'm even never dropped below 10% hp (which is actually half of bloodied HP pool) and never died using setup described above.
---
Glaive Plan?
---
Yeah that is true, but having to stay alive is where my worries is. For sneak builds its easier cause you are hidden so you take no damage anyways. But as a shotgun build ( Yeah not a sneak shotgun build, because the gauss shotgun cant be equipped with a sliencer ), you have to tank all damage.  Ill still probably do tons of damage so that doesnt bother me too much. Its just having to stay alive when a level 100 mob all shoot you at once. To me it already was tricky when i was doing runs at West Tek. Yeah i tanked a lot of their shots, but they did do some amount of damage that made it tricky to stay alive.
---
I feels for them, haha, not really. I maxed that perk out and spent about 200 gunpowder with the corresponding mats, got about 6.5k 556 lol.
---
I always thought max Rifleman would be all 3 perks, maxed out.
---
Rarer than the regular ones

Yep, same here, only it was on the first booster. I'm starting to think for Every new feature there's at least 1 new bug.
---
So ranged weapon bash in vats is a thing, right? In any fallout game?
---
If you're going to setup straw men, at least make them convincing ones. Bashing in vats is an extraneous feature.
---
Well, I can’t take all the credit. I heard something slightly less fleshed out awhile back regarding this involving a nukashine reset system. I just spiced it up.
---
I had a lovely 3 star anti armour combat knife. Loved roaming around the forest with that. Even treated myself to the gold skin for it. 
---
Just logged in for the 1st time, first thing to come up was path to enlightenment. Great, an xp boost for score to kick things off. Out comes my trusty knife. The ghouls? A few extra stabs but nothing too hard. Along comes a radtoad. Or two. Never thought I'd see the day I nearly die in that event.
---
Looks like I'll have to find a space on my wall for my knife. Was fun while it lasted.
---
not bloodied. But never cared if others did it. I saw how much stimpaks bloodied ppl use and I just never wanted to fight like that. As a stealth melee build, I doubt I’ll be playing this game anymore.
---
Agreed, it's the best thing they could have done and I haven't seen any of the usual bugs reappear like is the usual way of Beth updates. Absolute 10/10 this update.
---
 The red scout armor skin looks great!
---
I don't think downvoting is nasty if it's sincere, but I really think some people just do it to downvote as many posts as possible.  It would be great if I were wrong.  
---
The question on unwinding vs. new game difficulty....   what's the "something else" we can do now?   Cook plants?  Make adhesive?
---
This is why Bethesda is able to get away with it.
---
I honestly haven't seen a change besides the cards and the fact I can have more luck and strength and stuff
---
Its not a lie if hes not using vats which since he mentions rubber banding he likely isn't.
---
Yep. 
---
Just like the bag controversy was game killing. 
---
Just like Outer Worlds was going to be the 76 killer 
---
Just like Wastelanders delays was game killing.
---
Just like FO1st was game killing. 
---
Just like not deleting duped weapons was game killing. 
---
Just like convenience items in the AS we're going to be game killing. 
---
Just like not having single player offline was going to be game killing 
---
Just like adding a Battle Royale Mode was going to be game killing. 
---
Fun fact. You're part of the 76 Reddit community who thinks far too highly of themselves. It thinks they are the player base and not the sliver of it they actually represent.... And they're almost always wrong.
---
Ward v2.0
---
Like you said, you chose to be a glass cannon in favor of high damage output. You take on the responsibility of knowing how to play the build without dying.
---
Plus, it wasn’t just Bloodied that lost damage. Damage went down pretty much across the board as a result of the swap from multiplicative damage modifiers to additive. It wasn’t a targeted nerf (that’s how I define a nerf - a targeted reduction in damage or benefit of a specific weapon or armor). It’s essentially a side effect so they can make smarter changes moving forward. 
---
You still do outstanding damage per second. You’ve learned how to work the build. Now it’s time to adapt to a new damage calculation that’ll make the game much more healthy moving forward.
---
Yeah we definitely need a better chainsaw. Can they drop as legendaries? That would be neat. So you can finally Rip and Tear, until it is done
---
Oh screw the mole rats,they were already annoying begore this paych,well time to farming levels switch to PA heavy gun build,goodbye,my stealth rifles build!
---
Its alot do do with the fact that everybody played the same thing and until they have someone to copy off they won't enjoy it because they're not as OP as they were.
---
This event is such a great one now : great challenge, great rewards, really fun to play,  overall really well balanced.
---
Really liking it since the patch
---
Bloodied is still the top for dps in all categories I believe. All the builds got nerfed a little, but my fps is far better in big fights.
---
So far I like everything about this patch.
---
Now I don’t have to play the “Resilient” Ops I guess. Hopefully they aren’t frequent
---
Can confirm armor bench is still by Prime. (If I’ve got my location right. It’s 3 am.)
---
That's what I thought looked to clean for fallout 76 I assumed a re purposed texture.
---
I played for a few hours today, and I am enjoying it. The new perk cards the higher level enemies. I am still melting enemies with my flamer like a match on tissue paper. The Daily Ops today was fun as shit. I do kinda wish there were a bit better variety for PA legendary perk cards. There is already mysterious savior and a leg mod that does what two of the legendary cards do. Overall much fun.
---
I couldn't agree more. Been playing since beta and today i didn't feel like i was just going through the motions, it was actually fun.
---
A single bash finishes them off, it is kinda annoying though. First attempt solo just barely missed 12 minute mark.
---
And you know what’s worse? Several of the perks don’t even work properly.
---
Well, that escalated quickly.
---
*mass damage nerf puts his hand on your chest*
---
I don’t think so buddy!
---
Fallout 4 is the first time I remember bash, and I used it quite often to finish off enemies. AFAIK I had no problem bashing in vats.
---
Well enemies scaling to your level is a pretty massive change lol not finding low level mobs everywhere and shit like that changes pretty much everything.
---
You're at the level where the game got hard even before the patch though. I remember a period between where you are and probably into the 30s where i got my arse kicked everywhere I went. Its where your damage ability/lack of perks in a build lag behind enemy scaling a bit. It did get better though. It does sound like they need to make some adjustments though with damage at least because I think maybe the lag got bigger by the sounds of it.
---
I have a really high-powered shotgun, so I can still one hit most enemies with that, but all my other guns feel next to useless. It sucks because I felt like I’d found my long term game, but now it just feels like something I want to put down. And I get that they could fix it, but I’m left wondering if putting in all the time and work is worth it if at any point they can just ruin the game like this, and potentially for good. It’s put me off the game pretty hardcore.
---
I'm enjoying that I can wonder the entire map and get decent xp anywhere I go.  I'm leveling up faster now than ever before.
---
I ended up not fighting them and just respawning just to run to the objective and die in 2 seconds to get some progress. Boss fight was hell on earth.
---
There should be armor down there in the planner too. 
---
I use bolstering for 2 of my pieces, 2 pieces have unyielding and the last one saves me if I die. To negate much ap loss from jumping and using vats I have 3 effects that give me +5 ap regen each (plus action boy and im always well hydrated)
---
Bless the hearts of those that can’t work the damage calculator themselves
---
You know this update is because of people one shooting enemies.. and I personally think bloodied was the most affected because I run AA with 3 full commando perks and my damage is the same.
---
I'm mostly ok with this patch so far. 
---
It's still early days. Maybe give it a week and see what people think then but so far, other than missing the ability to go into autopilot and farm low level areas for junk, I think it's a solid patch.
---
Do you have Woodchucker equipped though?
---
Edit: nooooo someone made that joke already.
---
Bloodied is a not a glass cannon, try barbarian and think again. Also, 2h melee still oneshoting most mobs
---
Plot theory : Bethesda wants us to buy repair kits from the shop....
---
Other theory : welcome in new vegas.... I seriously considering Gunsmith over Démolition Expert even tho i´m using TSE just for that reason, even if Demo expert is great with New damage calculation.
---
On a more serious note, RP wise it makes sense that a gun that shots 2 rounds instead of one and explosive ones breaks faster
---
Well, that’s certainly one way to do it. Kudos to you!
---
Just legendary agility was enough to give my PA rifleman the ability to sneak, which as much as I didn’t want to do, realized I’d have to in order to keep my damage competitive in this update. It worked wonders, and for the first time, I can be a strange sneaky medic in solar armor who sometimes is in PA.
---
There are only three perks in my build that don’t directly affect my damage or the damage I take. My build is heavily optimised for my play style. This patch has taken my CBT kink too far, and actually cut my nuts off.
---
It's still in the PTS, no date yet
---
Level 73, left the forest... Got ass whooped. Came back to the forest, holding my own but with more broken guns and ammo use than I'd be able to hold out for more than a week of gameplay and before that my stims runout as doing some farming runs is no longer viable
---
Same Got a full sneak set fixer and perks but still Get detected 🤔
---
*Me loading up on popcorn hoping he responds*
---
Besides seeing lvl 50 instead of 20. My guns still melt them. I run commando AA
---
My Gauss pistol breaks when I leave the workbench!
---
I noticed this too. Not sure if due to enemies being so high leveled or if stealth nerf. I’ve done the whole re equip thing and played perks different orders. But nothing seems to happen. I’m getting dangered from even the simplest molerat.
---
What you should do? Dont use exploits next time.
---
Or dont join trolling friends that put exploits in your camp.
---
Not all of us are so hard core we know how to build a character to optimize. Some of us are casual players who can’t enjoy the game now, I’ve been playing for over a year btw. This is not fun
---
I'm experiencing this also, went into maintenance with about 5~% free, post patch left me over budget, deleted a few things, still over-budget. Sad times.
---
That's pretty cool
---
Agreed.
---
I'm level 109 and was 1 shotting any Scorch with my Grognak ax as it's +30 damage to Scorch. 
---
Now power swing takes them down to 1hp, forcing a second swing needlessly is annoying. I'm not complaining about damage nerfs or enemies being buffed, but this arbitrary 'no 1 shots' rule that appears to be snuck in is a bit frustrating.
---
For me I consider it a good and bad thing, on the plus side it’s got more replayability and scales well now, but on the downside I’ve now wasted hundreds of hours on a build that does less damage than my lvl 40 pistol character. 
---
I know some builds needed nerfed but to make my rifleman go from hitting for 3k to 300 is a joke, I can no longer 3 shot enemies let alone one shot them, and my stealth seems almost non existent now for some reason.
---
Learn how to apply logic to your argument. You're not "debunking" anything. You're just typing "debunk". Instead of using EVIDENCE to make a point, you are using a personal experience. That's not evidence, that's an anecdote. Which is exactly what I did...
---
"it feels like". Can you read?  FEELS LIKE.  It doesn't matter if you had PROOF of fairy farts. How a person responds to something has almost nothing to do with facts. That's why evidence is required when someone makes a claim. For example, if I was a total fucking idiot I could claim that there is no pandemic, thus I don't need to wear a mask. I could claim that, but evidence and facts do not support what I would be claiming. However, if I say that I THINK there is no pandemic and I don't WANT to wear a mask, no one would be able to fight that using facts and / or evidence because I'm not making a factual argument\*\*. So, when I say Daily Ops feels like it was built for, I'm not wrong and trying to "debunk" that, even if you had facts to back it up (you don't), would not matter. 
---
Instead of being an asshole, you could ask why I feel that way. You didn't, you went straight for the attack. Not armed with proof (because how could you), but armed with savagery held aloft by your disdain for someone that does not agree with you. One wonders who the real drama queen is.
---
\*\*If you find yourself in a situation where you are arguing with a nutjob about their conspiracy claims that there is no pandemic, the only proper argument you need to make is hitting them upside the head with a shovel.
---
my 3* Junkies/SS/+1 str sheep staff had a base damage of 693 before the update. Now its like 370. Thats a huge drop for something I had to work my ass of to get.
---
Unfortunately it's not only seen in game though, it's something that plagues mankind as a whole. There's just too many people that can't think for themselves and just flock like sheep to whatever is "in" at the time.
---
Thank you.
---
Yeah, today’s was literally the most demonic set possible. I’m very glad for my tanky melee friend who dragged me through it for... whistle in the dark (same effects as the survival weapon, just as a plan and with a fancy paint. Not worth it.).
---
So it’s just blooded that has been penalised ?
---
Bloodied is still the most ammo concervitive. Not like it was though yes i do have secret service vanguard and unyeilding sets.. Bloodied is a glass cannon and it shouldnt of been nerfed.. those who complained obviously never could swing it. 😂
---
Yes. I’ve found equipping a handmade or combat rifle with bayonet and the bashing mods as well the gun bashing perk along with squad maneuvers make cake the bots.
---
Bethesda Fun Police: "You are enjoying the game.  Any stars are good stars.  Buy atoms.  That is all."
---
I definitely would have been onboard for more PA legendary cards too, and I stupidly picked brawling chemist or whatever thinking the chem would give damage bonus and not melee damage bonus only so I'll have to switch it but I'm definitely super happy with it so far either way. I did a fog crawler horde event and they fucking deleted me and I laughed because I was happy they weren't so squishy and they were smacking the hell out of me. I'm excited to fight mobs at my level lol
---
Stealth is terrible right now, I ll try reequip perks as I get home, I hope it get better.
---
&gt;But they should of buff all other builds
---
It's far better to nerf a few overperforming builds than buff everything else, mostly because those buffs will likely end up leading to cases where new builds are massively overperforming via unintended consequences, and then you're back at square one.
---
Nerfs are, in short, far more controlled.
---
Ideally you want performance for just about any reasonable build to be at roughly the same level. There are always going to be outliers, but not to such a degree that they render every other build completely obsolete in comparison, which is the problem we had.
---
These nerfs to exponential multiplier stacking are a step in the right direction; they greatly reduce the performance gap between builds.
---
The biggest problem facing game balance now is enemy durability: If the enemies weren't bullet sponges, I guarantee you we would not be in this situation.
---
This is especially bad for new or low level players, because they, by definition, do not have a build. They find themselves fighting enemies with durability rapidly outpacing their own potential damage output. The game becomes exponentially more difficult as they level up, and they lack any sort of counterplay.
---
Awww it never bugged for me, and I am still grinding the settlers, I hate ward
---
Angry Turtle’s voice and accent is *soooooo* soothing. I watched one of his pre patch 22 videos to calm me down after the disappointment set in.
---
The mobs of enemies are still easy too kill. Sbq, Lord Williams and daily ops are a bit harder. Sharing team medic has helped out massively in events. Revenant and mysterious savior can help with some of the damage nerf if u don't already run it.
---
We have had loadouts for quite some time now, I can tell you it's awesome! /#pcmasterrace
---
Yup vampire gatling plasma. Then hope the dude with the hammer runs at the horde that has no health left so I can stop wasting plasma cores. I know I can gun bash but my god it is really unreliable.
---
Not sure if I agree that they should be gained from quests, but I agree with the main point!
---
All that delicious xp and it's everywhere instead of having to grind xp in certain areas. I'm loving it too
---
there is no reason we should ever have to fight a level 50 or higher rad roach. Certain enemies should have a max level cap even with this one wasteland crap.
---
Same, Level 20 too. I started just a few days ago and I’m out of ammo for all of my weapons in just a few hours since I’m burning through ammo faster than I can craft it... Everything just takes forever to kill, even Mole Rats.
---
I don’t really want to be forced into a build either. I liked how the game felt a day ago where I can play casually. I hope they do something about the bullet sponge everything soon
---
Sorry to hear, all I can say is I had no issues at all with a group and there was no communication as they were a random public team I joined. 
---
I think there’s a good chance they didn’t decide which one would be first and it’s randomised just happened to get a bad roll. I doubt they would have someone picking everyday.
---
I personally find it a lot more enjoyable than most of the other events. I might give it a go solo to try and grind some XP but I doubt I’ll be aiming to finish it.
---
I'm not done yet. Have you accommodated the 112 perk coins locked into SPECIAL by virtue of pre-existing card allocation?
---
If you've never respecced then I assume you use the same cards constantly?
---
He gave me free rep and I still hated him.
---
So he's not telling whole truth, so he's not lying, right?
---
&gt; Fallout 4 is the first time I remember bash 
---
Again... in VATS. Using bash in VATS.
---
You want to give it another go?
---
Did you try unplugging your stealth perks and plugging them back in?
---
Why can't we use this mod instead? Is it bannable? I didn't know there mods for 76 tbh
---
Can see your point just seems now everything is bad and the worse build are worse and the meta build is still meta just needs more ammo. Hopefully, they sort it out.
---
If they wanted to please everybody, a good solution would have been to add this additive system in, but double the damage on all weapons so that the nerf wasn't as harsh
---
Move your camp then?
---
Weapon bash also counts.
---
Oh i wasn't aware you can include armors on the nukesanddragons build planner now. Didn't scroll all the way down, sry.
---
A fine set you got there. Before the patch, the bolstering effects kinda didn't make a big diffrence against UNY pieces in my testings. But with the enemy scaling now they probably have an actual use with bloodied builds.
---
Thanks for your time and for sharing.
---
Same. Used to get 500-600 on a scorched beast now 150-200 and it takes a LOT more bullets. Not fun when you spend two years grinding gear and weapons to then have the game devs shit on you because they’re too stupid to play their own game.
---
If you dont use VATS you barely notice the accuracy différence while the damage différence is Huge since the nerf
---
The poison one the ammo one and 4 special cards. Pretty much meta right now. If your a stealth build then follow through is also good. Good thing about the poison card is that the rank 1 version is all you need.
---
Yup I’m the second one. I’ve played a lot time, and this newest version is not fun. I don’t crunch numbers. I did just fine with my stealth build, now I can’t use it and still be effective. I want to play my way and this isn’t it.
---
someone wants to roleplay Doom Slayer?
---
If you can get a nice unarmed weapon [this build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3666aa&amp;d=x43a72am2a42a12la2l71lt2lu2ee2eu0i12ir2s92sg2ss2sf2se2ce0cu2pe2aa2cd1x62ek1x80x10xe0xb0ej1&amp;m=c2feghb36&amp;am=18-18-18-18-18&amp;wp=w0&amp;wm=1421) has not given me any trouble.
---
Low key i was really sad to lose my ammo factories (blueprint glitch). I had a monopoly on selling 5mm and never ran out of 556
---
Same... I don't think I'm coming back... Especially since daily ops basically eliminate stealth completely. What's the point?
---
No all weapons and builds have been affected by said update. I just think the bloodied ones got it worse
---
Sorry about me spelling I used voice to text in the first post. I was to angry to be able to type calmly and I’m still am feeling cagey that’s 12 months just wasted grinding because of this update give me back my 12 months of gaming or my damage points back
---
Daily ops and legendary perks are cool. Didn´t even notice the damage nerf, I was playing a relatively low damage build, full hp with mostly anti-armor/instigating weapons, and honestly I feel stronger than before :&gt;
---
Its the same reason.... Its cool to have an OP beam splitter laser rifle but its like firing 5 projectiles
---
I'm glad they are making people put in the work for everything a bit more. I get liking to be able to farm junk in low level areas cause it's definitely nice but it just makes more sense to have them scale with you and to make you fight to get what you want. Just my opinion though
---
I know I wish I had invested coins in ranking up in something else I wasn't paying attention
---
I can't see myself doing events that take 10K rounds.
---
I’ve found it the opposite way around to you tbh, my lvl 40 pistol character now hits for hundreds more than my lvl 120 rifleman, I feel even using a legacy or god roll I can barely hit for 600 damage with all the multipliers where as before it was an easy 3-4.4k damage and am I the only one who’s noticed stealth seems to be screwing up on this update? I’m getting spotted miles away and escape artist is so slow to trigger now
---
I agree
---
Yeah. Even tho they're level 50, they still have low stats
---
Edit: Except super mutants, fck super mutants
---
And you are now indoctrinated into turtles army
---
Have you tried unplugging your stealth perks and plugging them back in? 
---
As for your rifle build, what kind was it? Bloodied? Junkie?
---
It's in foundation
---
Hahaha ... that's epic. 
---
Dupers going to have a field day and the event hasn't even happened yet.
---
Converter not factory, smh
---
You need to move point about so it works for some reason even though you have the points now it only takes I to account what you have with out legendary perks.
---
Shame. As a super casual player who is still in Mistress stuff and just finished her Excavator armor, I am pretty disappointed. I was looking forward to trying the new events and perks but I’m not going to get my ass handed to me any more than I usually do. Guess it’s time to uninstall 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
It's exciting isn't it! Seriously, I don't understand why people get so upset when challenged on stuff like this. One great thing about the mathematical approach is that if you can validate your position against challenges then it strengthens it. No idea why he started swearing, just immaturity I guess.
---
Not having to constantly switch in/out lockpocking and hacking perks are making things a lot smoother, and that’s before I start on about the new ammo Smith legendary, I’ve only made 1 load of .308 but with the ammosmith and super duper on it’s amazing. Saves so much lead it’s almost a crime not to get it.
---
Seriously, this!  I had so many cards unrelated to any build or respec I might ever contemplate, not to mention all the duplicates or under--ranked cards like Hard Bargain where you would never possibly have a need for anything but the fully-ranked card.
---
Soooo much cleaner now!
---
Yeah I rode this one for quite awhile. Sorry no bug, no vital equipment Wardy
---
They don't drop fusion cores and plasma cores, same thing with the wendigo spawn at APC. Daily Ops is great for farming fuel for my Explosive flamer though, I leave with more fuel than I came in with.
---
So this isnt a popular card but what gives me the drop on enemies is Pain Train! I just CHOO CHOO right into them stunning and knocking them down(does not work on bots) and then cook'em with my furious flamer. I even have the Thomas the Tank engine song playing through my mic input when I charge. Combined with reactive plates and plague walker shit just dies.
---
I was fighting level 50 and 100 super mutants at west tek. Power armor heavy gunner, and I was using my 50 cal. I had never seen a level 100 enemy before so it got pretty hype about that lol.
---
I took my knife and added to my rifle.
---
hated it for about one hour but now i love it lol just solo’d the daily ops with 10 seconds to go and got the disease cure thing and it was awesome !! finally this game got my heart pumping again :p
---
Its still the best at damages.... And its better to do daily ops at full health than low health for example.
---
The downside isnt even that great as its just springs farming when needed
---
That handmade skin and some emotes are cool but I'm more interested in grinding for the perk card packs
---
Truth. My stealth build is shit now. And the game isn’t fun anymore
---
The great thing about having the skin is you can’t drop or accidentally sell it. It won’t allow you. I worry that I might accidentally sell my fixer all the time lol.
---
The ultimate problem is that TTK is way too high for most builds, and the recent changes doubled or in some cases tripled TTK for builds that use High damage/Low ROF weapons.
---
This is Rifleman builds, Gunslinger builds, VATS crit builds, Melee builds, Unarmed Builds.
---
Commando and Heavy builds are largely unaffected, because they just have to hold the trigger down for a little bit longer. They're already heavy DPS focused, so they aren't really affected all that much unless they were stacking damage multipliers.
---
I'm pretty happy with everything being harder to kill and having to to change some strategies from the goog ol' kill 'em all
---
I’m gonna un-equip every card as something seems broke, and I was a bloodied build however my weapons are TSE so it shouldn’t have hit me as hard as it did
---
I just use my ts grenade launcher to launch groups of trash mobs into space.  Even after the update it still one shots most things so the only real difference is I get far more experience when I launch mob rockets to the moon.
---
This is great news, some of the best drops I've ever gotten were from uranium fever but they were lvl 40s
---
True, but like I commented earlier, im not too worried about the damage output. Im more worried about the damage ill be taking when facing higher level enemies.
---
I only had an hour to play today so tried to knock out the daily event challenge by doing Tea Time - Nearly failed it - My usual VATS single tap became a two tap, sometimes a proper full auto burst.
---
Also tried a Westek run for comparisons sake and noticed i was averaging 8 shots compared with 4 - 5 to kill a mutant.
---
I agree with you on the stealth issue, ok the daily ops stealth dosent work, but line in the sand too?? Really?? Ended up switching to my full vanguard SS so I didn't get killed by a random ghoul.
---
Now i am happy i just quit this shit
---
Trust me, i did this i became so much more happy with the end results with my second build than my first. Don’t rush it. :)
---
Anyone know if there's a way to still do the ammo factory glitch? I had 5 of those babies set up
---
Ugh, dang now I need to keep farming cores at white springs.
---
Bethesda doesnt play their own game.. they couldnt be bothered to test the damage nerf on any of the event bosses or the queen... they couldnt put the daily ops quest in a radio station or have it pop up as a quest automatically. Its a damn shame.
---
I get you. 
---
For me, I'd like for some areas to be distinctly low level. Not like Lvl 6 mobs but like a max of 20-25s or something like that. However, also have areas that are distinctly hard like consistently 60-70+ regardless of your level. Maybe like the forest for the former, the bog for the latter and everything in between is as it is now with One Wasteland.
---
It's still to early to tell but I get the sense that this extra level of difficulty that scales with you, as small as that may be, could get draining after a while.
---
For me it was TZ map markers, not the map itself
---
Thank you. I was hopping it would get a fix quickly, but I was expecting a few days. This is great news.
---
Yeah can see why they are having problems. I'm heavy shotgunner build but at minute im far too heavy with weapons etc I cannot use any damage buffing perks in strength lol 😆. Thank God for magic shotguns.
---
I’ve even tried using the Chinese stealth armor and they just run straight towards me now
---
Buddy i'm on PS4 and i'm not running cheated or legacy weapons. Here i share how i get success with my Bloodied v.a.t.s sniper, my Bloodied Commando and Bloodied Heavy Gunner. I'm sorry if i irritate you, but it's true...some bloodied builds should stop watching build videos and they should start doing their job.
---
You don't need to hyper focus on the Scorched Beast Queen to get the loot...especially if you are running a Bloodied build. Bloodied Snipers and Bloodied  Commandos are mostly running v.a.t.s build or have enough Perception and Agility to v.a.t.s the whole battlefield to see if enemies are sneaking around. 
---
Bloodied Heavy Gunners have a lot of troubles when insects are starting to harass them.  You actually don't want Heavy Gunner to stop shooting the Queen or Earl.
---
I mean, on my Sniper or my Commando, i so don't give a s%&amp;t, this is extra xp. Let me tell you heavy gunners aren't harassed for very long...Then when my v.a.t.s is spoting nothing, i'm going back on the boss.
---
Agreed I’ve been putting an Evil Dead Ash Williams character build together for a few weeks. Sadly the build requires the use of a chain saw. Buff it.
---
Any idea of Pain Train perk will allow you to just sprint into them for the kill?  Im planning on moving a few perks around with the new legendary perks they added.
---
Besides ACP being lvl 110. I haven't sense one but I also only played 20 minutes
---
Yep same.
---
High level means less than ever lol
---
Wait until people realize that nuking different areas is fun!
---
It is stangely refreshing to not just murders everything in sight and have to think about engaging enemies.
---
I noticed this as well. My thought was the card is just added damage similar to bloody mess. Albeit after the first shot.  And that the card doesn’t pop up for the effect.
---
I have an i40p40p baseball bat at 315 damage that 1 shots most the robots in daily ops, unless it has taken damage then it does less than ¼ damage??? I have no melee perks. I think a bug with instigating power attack weapons. I havent had enough time to test it out tho.
---
As a bloodied stealth rifleman build.. Bethesda has killed me, even with an explosive tesla legacy my damage has went from 3.5-4.4k per shot all the way down to 360-380 and my god rolled lever action now feels worse than my first pipe rifle
---
I solo'd it but was a minute or two too late and got paladin, not elder. But I didn't feel like doing it again to try and beat my time and no one was joining my ops team :( I'm super excited for the ops and for enemies scaling and legendary perks and everything it all has me pretty hype lol it gives me more desire to play for sure
---
Did you not read the last line of the post you responded to?
---
You could try to find a horde event, guarantees a legendary. The wolf one in the forest always seems to be triggered.
---
To be fair It's a fucking awful attribute and all my friends hate it
---
honestly, i have been fuming about this patch since i was playing with friend last night. im not a new player, my original build is close to level 90, but my friend and i thought it would be fun to create new characters and play together. it was going great until the update yesterday. my second character hit level 30 last night and i burnt through so much ammo for no reason, on stupid shit like radroaches and bloatflies. and it definitely did not make playing in a group any more entertaining. we failed an event we regularly do because of how ridiculous the enemies were to kill. i think one wasteland sounds like a nice concept on paper, but in practice, with a lower level build, it's just frustrating and rage inducing.
---
Go back to the way it was. As an rpg we should be able to play our way. I shouldn’t have to rebuild my character in order to kill a level 50 rad roach!
---
Next time just say vats still one shots and if he says it doesn't then you got him in a lie. Then when you accuse him of lying it will be lying instead of ignorance.
---
It popped up automatically when I travelled to Cranberry Bog, at the same time as heart of the enemy so I'm not sure what you meant there.
---
I’ve still got you capable doing around 1400 dps with all the right cards and sneak/chem buffs even with additive. (I don’t know what gun you’re using. I used a fixer in my calculation.) Let me know how it goes and if it still doesn’t get high enough I’d be happy to try to help if that’s ok.
---
They  cut down the damage just to piss everyone off.. they claim its balancing.. it feels like it but they absolutley overkilled it.. if i wanted to use hundreds of rounds in 5minutes i would just go play the division 2 😂
---
I hear you on that, but the episodic and slow drip feel works a HELL of a lot better for us gamers on a relatively low-hour, casual gaming budget. At least on my wife and my opinions, we like this update really balances between immediate content (mostly with one wasteland making everything feel new) and long term content.
---
Totally game changing for me too - and in a very good way. Really happy with this, other than the grind it's going to be to do these over my 3 chars. It's not very alt friendly.
---
And Master Infiltrator (even 1\*) ... wow, talk about a QOL improvement! Hacking and Picking with no perk swapping!
---
So sad to see double unyielding and concentrated fire get fixed. The rest of this stuff sounds awesome tho
---
I had 5 factories and used to pick a random type of ammo to farm and give away for free in my vending machine each day I played. I used to never run out of 556........
---
Hey bro if you’re on Xbox send me a dm with your tag and I’ll be happy to donate what you need. And don’t feel bad, I’m 642 and this update sucks for everyone.
---
60% of the map was useless to anyone over level 40
---
Yea it is but shocking since this prevents people from spending atoms.
---
you shouldnt have to fast travel there to get the notificationm it should pop up from the moment you spawn in.
---
Yeah, I don't like it at all. Jumped into a Uranium Fever event and was immediately attacked by level 60, 75 and 100 Mole Miners. Did Fly Swatter and it was a level 50 Vertibird. I'm probably just going to avoid events now. I thought this was supposed to make things easier for low level players, but it seems like it made the game harder for everyone.
---
Huh? You're not forced to respec. Let's take a look at your build ([https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks))
---
I just remove my fallout76custom.
---
Secret service with Barbarian,blocker, fireproof, lone wanderer, evasive, dodgy also nerd rage and serendipity if your bloodied. Mutation grounded. Backpack that increases DR. If you have all this on you’ll take very little damage. I run a bloodied gauss shotgun build with all this on and I feel like a god.
---
Well when your higher level ammo factory max that shit out in the legendary cards.
---
There's a whole subreddit that showcases camps, maybe you can peruse it to gain inspiration!  
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout76settlements/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout76settlements/)
---
However it also means no more low level legends we can freely give to new players.
---
They don't even load in anymore.
---
Position I'm in now needs to be criticized, and so does such tool - it's part of the growth, both mine as toolmaker and tools as community resource. I am already grateful for our interaction - apologies for something you're grateful for are not neccessary :)
---
I'd gladly walk through all the problems and dillemas I faced building it and hear your perspective on them. I don't suppose I found the best possible answers each time, but there's a lot of thought put into it already. For example, the 'Price Rating'. The way it is now, I can change one number (i.e. pcDemand parameter of bloodied legendary effect) and impact prices of every single bloodied item. Because of that, and because of how often numbers are tweaked, any "price rating" that I would display would pretty much be referring to old price output -&gt; it would be logical to either put it into 'historic rating', or to hide it -&gt; imagine dropping a rating to come back next day and see this item wasn't rated yet -&gt; "F#$%#n' scammers!"
---
I don't feel comfortable with putting ads into website and making it a monetized project. The ~300$ I pay for it yearly I can pay for the lessons it teaches, but if I were to store not only all the data used for calculations and the price feedbacks, but also an extensive version history for each of the hundreds of thousands of item combinations, and the ratings they received in the meantime, I'd have to increase the costs noticably, and agree for compromises it doesn't need as it is now.
---
You'll find our discord at https://fed76.info/discord
---
You don’t have to respec
---
Listening?  lol I guess I missed the part where they raised the daily limits and implemented a new trade interface.  Bethesda is radio fucking silent on a lot of things...
---
No, its your type of people saying they dont want to look at their build and tinker it. You know what kind of build im playing on all my characters? Food build, how those tryhards call it, im a hoarder. I got every weight perk, except strong back, shotguns weight and armor weight. I have only 3 points in damage talents total, every rank 1, like 30% rifle damage total, with blood mess, tank killer and nerd rage (or not, if im on junkies char). And im doing FINE. There is always to much fuking crybabies, bitching about everything, downvote all you want, i dont give a fuck about your internet points, game is now closer to survival mod, its a harsh wasteland, not a disneyland
---
Ah yeah, I did think that too as id already done a daily op before I ran into that. It would have been better story wise that you can't do one until you've met him, otherwise it doesn't make sense. Not only that he didn't acknowledge that I'd done one and wouldn't let me proceed with the dialogue until I do another.
---
That sounds great! I won’t be able to get on until later this evening however I’ll let you know how it goes regardless
---
You know what, I guess I didn't. My bad.
---
I don't think that's right. Firstly, not my recollection (at least in vanilla). Also, if it was in 4, you'd think it'd be in 76. Like all the over features and bugs that were carried over wholesale from 4.
---
Isn't is supposed to be introduced as a big DLC like expansion called Fractured Steel? At least that's what I found when I searched for it. Its coming right after One Wasteland
---
Gladly, cause I know the person that fired them aimed them at me rather than shooting and spinning around without aiming
---
Thanks. I thought I'd wasted a huge amount of perk coins.
---
Mac Kelly monument will be such a scary place with scaled ennemies....
---
Don't forget super duppa for a wee bit extra munitions,
---
But being low level that'll be rather hard to level up ammo factory the amount of perks required to get to level 4, I'm lvl 145 I've cleared out all of my unwanted cards and just made it to a lvl 4 card, Now think a low level won't be getting ammo factory for awhile.
---
Still just under 400 lead now make 12.000 .5mm rounds so I'm set for a bit &amp; 300 lead made 5.000 .45mm rounds, I have become an asset to my friends due to this perk now while they level their damage perks lol.
---
So i could use help, I'm a bloodied rifleman, i'd need to send my specific build, but i was thinking of running full health commando instead so i can use the new rad perk.
---
I have a quad fixer and an aa explosive 10mil sub and a vamps ultracite 25 25 rifle.
---
Think it'd do well? And maybe lend me a hand building said full health? I already have the vangaurds armour farmed and a chameleon piece for stealth
---
i did it with some friends 3times and got the big tube that clears diseases. .. we did the same thing.. ended up goin to em after we did it multiple times.. we will do it later ... actually complete the quest.. lol
---
are you sure? because I don't think you can even join a daily ops without opening that window...
---
LOL I've been pointing out the respec perk coin problem for months and get downvoted every time.
---
My best friend barely even *plays* the game, but he is on every night and has been for over a year. 
---
He's around level 130. 
---
He loves the ambiance, the sounds and the feeling of comfort he gets from nothing more than sitting in his camp. He's a builder, constantly rebuilding from scratch whenever he gets a new idea. But he rarely ventures out of his hidey hole, unless he is in dire need of material. 
---
He doesn't enjoy the thrill of the kill, the adrenaline rush from surviving against all odds would drive him insane. So he plays this game more as a wilderness building game and avoids danger as much as possible.
---
Exactly. It’s not fun anymore. If I wanted to play dark souls I’d play dark souls
---
I only have 1 build and it's a PA heavy gunner. If I had played longer I'd probably be able to help more but I get help with my builds myself. Maybe post that as a question to the whole group? I'm sure someone should have a solution for you. The enemies definitely hit pretty hard and you have to be able to get in close and melee to finish them off. I wish I could help you more man, I'm sorry
---
It’s great. Not sure how the experience would be levelling up, but with a max level character it makes everywhere viable to farm xp again. There is actually a reason to do events like Leader of the pack, tea time, back on the beat etc now.
---
Or completely get rid of PvP in Adventure and only leave it for nuclear winter cause of all the toxicity been going on
---
Interested
---
I haven’t spotted the skin yet, is it a season 2 tier reward? Thanks
---
If you're talking about exploding palm, don't worry; it is mediocre at best. Melee's advantage over unarmed is meant to be the ability to use PA. How that stacks up in-game, I am not sure as I do not like PA.
---
Have you ever played an online game or MMO? Things change, adapt and stop your bitching.
---
Yes only one reward from each tier
---
I ran out of breath just trying to read this. 
---
Have you checked the news about Legendary Perks? There might just be one that tickles your ammo fancy. :)
---
Basically bloodied builds got taken down a peg or two and they're not happy for it.  
---
Given how long it has been the meta, you have lots of people miffled about the changes.
---
Use a Ultracite Gatling Laser on enemies to get nuclear waste. Melt the Mirelurk Queen at Quarry X3 and the deathclaw at the nearby substation for gears. Then take Monongah and Thunder Mountain power plants. The workshops give you the rest of the materials to build fusion generators to power the fusion core producers. Then grab the cores every half hour or so.
---
The workshop defense events were a bit of a pain, but I did one today post patch 22 and the 3 waves of liberators I had to kill spawned like a glitched Line in the sand. It was all over in about a minute.
---
huh? what does pvp have to do with it?
---
I interpreted what I read as "at some point during the One Wasteland patch cycle, they'll trigger the intro to the BoS for both daily ops to make sense and to build into the next update". Probably coming in a minor update in 1-5 weeks
---
I tried earlier, they all reccomended me their builds, or ruining my own build to force chem buffs into mine.
---
No it’s from season one. Season two doesn’t have any combat rifle skins i believe
---
That'll be included with Fallout 2nd, for an additional $10/mo fee.
---
I feel this is the first time they have actively lostened. Thank you Bethesda lurkers!
---
I never even thought of this..... Ants can be mean lol
---
it's most likely unintended lol
---
ahm very tough to stay alive with serendipity and emergency protocols
---
It's all a lie anyway you can have 8000 items of 0.1 outfits in your stash but only maybe a 100 heavy weapons. Doesn't make sense. If the server can handle 8000 different items in theory, there is no way a small increase would hurt the server yeah might be laggy but still. They should make it item limit not weight limit
---
Edit I know im going way over the top with the 8000 but it's is possible by their rules.
---
Ahh ok thanks 👍🏼
---
nope
---
Answer is: you can kill resilient enemies only with melee attacks.
---
One wasteland does nothing for me personally.  I play solo, extra time spent killing stuff due to being weaker has negated any minimal xp gains, plus it makes nuissance monsters (mole rats...) much stronger, which I really hate.  It's a somewhat but not massive negative change for me so far.    
---
Daily ops seems like a good addition, but the resilient mod lead to a mostly unfun experience.   Won't be doing ops with that mod again.    
---
Legendary perks seem pretty cool.  The ammo one might help me actually use my plasma flamer regularly, which I would love.  Nice to have a reason to cash in those perk cards.    
---
More weekly score challenges are nice.  Should be able to max the pass playing 5ish days a week, which is at least an improvement.    
---
Damage nerf:  Hate it.  Damage adjustments should have come with an overall combat revamp, not just as a blanket nerf.  Just made the game more tedious, without addressing the imbalance between weapons and affixes.
---
oh you mean melee.
---
i had a few 1 shot on level 75 and 100's last nite. GUNS
---
Considering how good the level scaling has worked out I can overlook this minor flaw, which is nothing compared to the usual fuck ups weve had to endure previously, but it is definitely something they could have put that extra 5mins of thought into.
---
yes it stacks, but "only" up to 100, not infinitely
---
So much for stealth being dead. I thought I'd be rebuilding too. 
---
I maxxed Follow Through and still one shot the average ghoul on my Instigating. Went to West Tek and engaged the forecourt- definitely used about five times the ammo but these were 100's?! I didn't know muties got that strong. Still, all dead. Zero damage received. Roughly two or so shots to kill anything below 100, and three to five for the higher range. Again, these are massively high level critters. 
---
Im not talking daily ops however. Different story. I feel for overland though there's some serious overreacting and it's only marginally tougher.
---
Ill be interested to run a silo... 100 robots could be interesting...
---
Yea definitely. I mean everyone will be running around with 1100 carry weight and be doing 10k damage with melee weapons. Sure this will be patched fast.
---
Be lucky IRL.  Just get the good weapons bro it's easy as that.
---
Yeah, I am aware of those. Best time I ever jad farming cores from the work shop was.one wave fell under the map so it never completed. Could collect cores and didnt have to deal with anymore protect events. 
---
Hitting the Sentrybots and then server hopping yields alot of cores quickly 70-89% charge cores.
---
lol
---
I was aware its blocking my legendary perk menu and was ok with that for now because i don't even know what to pick anyways.
---
But i didn't know its also blocking that reward screen. Because i did try die daily ops yesterday solo with my stealth commando, but wasn't able to pull it off.
---
Little question on the side: Is stealth actually deactivated in those events? It seemed like they always immediatelly found me after respawning.
---
Would have been nice to test that sort of thing out and alter it... on the test server.  Dunno, maybe that's just me.
---
Yes it's a lil bit harder, the meta is probably about to change a lil and we just need a lil more time to adapt ourselves. Hyper-focuced dps builds may take a lil step back to add a lil more survivability. It's a lil harder for everyone and power armors may also become a lil more praticticle in certain situations...etc, etc. It's not the end of the world. And here i was talking about Bloodied Snipers and Bloodied Commandos. If you aren't running one of these builds, you aren't concerned by my comment. Beside Junkies and Bloodieds, we unfortunatly don't expect much from the other builds. 
---
But if you run a Furious build, you are basically forced to play with a maxed Adrenaline perk card to really maximise (optimise) the potential of this legendary effect...and honestly it's already a pretty big hint there...you gotta kill adds if you wanna optimise your dps...for a dps phase 😐.
---
Yesterday I completed “Line in the sand” solo and was able to finish. Today I tried it solo and was killed 6 times in a row by scorched before I quit realising it was futile to continue.
---
Running unyielding armor and blooded melee
---
I am level 38 and the game is no fun anymore.
---
Still..100+ hours for 40 bucks is a good deal.
---
 Going to play something else for a while. Cyberpunk 77 not far off now:-)
---
Companion would be awesome
---
have you done all the tadpole and possum challenges? also the one to photograph all different types of creatures is pretty time consuming too
---
uhh yes
---
This patch is bullshit. I’m taking a break from this game after just coming off the one week break before today. Not sure if it’s really a break though as this patch has really put me off toward the game. Life is tedious enough. I don’t need the fucking game I’m playing to introduce more tedium into my already chaotic and hectic life. Who’s the dickhead that okayed this?
---
Like everyone else said, you don't have to respec. I think your issue is that nobody else has posted something for you to copy off and be a one shot one kill god at all times.
---
I accidentally equiped one to see the effects. Ran out of coins and now I'm stuck with the stealth card. Feelsbadman.jpg
---
Dude, I think you ran out of punctuation. Here have some of mine “,,,,,,,,,,,,,,”. 
---
Always keen to help a brother out.
---
well with this they certainly is going in the same direction as Eso so one can hope \^\^
---
VATS Commando is my build, have only played a little bit since patch but doesn't seem to have changed a whole lot so I'm thinking it's a decent option.
---
grinding settlers is suprisingly easy in comparison to raiders, cause you get a lot of chances to actually get settler rep from raider dailies (like convince raider to join foundation and whatnot)
---
Anti Armor is a really good option nowadays. I saved a couple of AA guns for this occasion and I'm really happy with them plus they're pretty useful against the robots during DO
---
I removed the tz map, tz map markers, improved health bar, and better inventory and it worked. Thanks.
---
lol, but they could have just nerfed bloodied instead of everything.  Bloodied is STILL better than everything else.
---
Also every other fallout has been a single player game, they don’t have to worry about how OP you are because you’re the only one in game. (I know this game isn’t exactly balanced but it’s definitely more limited than previous entries)
---
Honestly this game was just 1 hit 99% of enemy in the game, it needed a change. Also you don’t have to “google optimised builds” use your brain and specialise your character into a certain weapon type and you shouldn’t really have a problem. 
---
Though if you’re not enjoying it there are plenty of games out there so moving on might be the best option for you. In general I really like this update, made it a little more interesting for me and unfortunately there aren’t really any games that give you that fallout feel. outer worlds is good and actually plays a lot nicer than 76 but it’s still missing a lot of things that make fallout unique and it’s single player only.
---
Does turning HDR on make your game crash more on PS4?
---
Wanna meet up and trade outfit for plan?
---
Yeah it's been like that for a couple months, should've seen it when it was 90% instead of 60%.
---
Conversion to stealth commando shouldn't be a problem to you
---
Not worth the xp(get much lower xp than doing random kills in world now...imho). I will try in a group tomorrow and see how it goes. I promised I would never play an MMO again, because of the many raid fail frustrations. Now this game is taking me exactly there.
---
Same here. They didn’t need to nerf or that stupid leveling system no one wanted or asked for
---
My SS Left Arm broke pretty up every daily op
---
Pre-patch I would find 2 minimum each Westek run, today I ran it twice and found a total of 1 - could be coincidence/bad luck though.
---
Silo robots can be killed from stealth and range. 
---
I did NOT have fun in the daily ops. Robot. Melee kill required. I can’t stealth.
---
lol nobody is going to send nukes anymore, the robots always had bullshit damage resistance and overall hp, this just made it 10X worse, you simply can't send nukes anymore if you don't have a specialized build
---
Same. No one asked for this and it’s not fun anymore. I cancelled my 1st. Time for a new game I guess
---
That’s true! I just hate how forced I feel into the commando build, it’s like Bethesda hates rifleman and wants to drown it out
---
I wish I had read this 3 minutes earlier, just solo’d an elder victory while my troll teammate stayed afk dancing at spawn 😭
---
I know the feeling, friend. There were some of us on the PTS who vocally and repeatedly warned Bethesda about this, but honestly, this round of testing there was a definite air of "just test what we give you, we have no plans to change anything" to the proceedings.
---
&gt;squad maneuvers
---
why though? *None* of the movement speed modifiers stack, so you hit cap on speed demon alone
---
I'm just happy to be over encumbered with gum.  No more do you want to open that pack messages.  Haven't spent all my level ups yet though so still get that message.
---
Have you tried using other weapons/playstyles?  This update changed things dramatically for a lot of people so now you might have to rethink outside of the box.  Shake things up, try weapons you normally wouldn't have.  Who knows, you might find something you like even more.  
---
I ran through quite a lot of weapons and builds and respecc'd a lot before I found what I liked.  And then later I found what I liked even better and respecc'd again  😂
---
sounds terrifying lol
---
Exactly. The point of rpgs is to play your way. If I can’t play a stealth build it’s no longer fun
---
Your second paragraph is pretty much making your entire argument looking kind of pointless.
---
Agreed. I’m 642. Been playing on Xbox since beta and spent almost two years maxing my bloody stealth commando build. Guns feel like they’re shooting potatoes.  Enemies feel way too tanky especially super mutants and mole rats ( damn those hidden bastards ). I shouldn’t feel like a level 40 at 642. There should be a feeling of power when you’re my level. It should build over time as you level. This doesn’t feel like that anymore.
---
Lol this^^^
---
Double edged sword as you can drop and destroy it. 
---
I lost my best minigun like that. I thought I had alt-tabbed and tried to type something in discord, but what it really did was drop my minigun and confirm the deletion message. 
---
I’d rather rename my gear with “zz” so it’s at the bottom of the list, but be able to pick it up from the ground if I accidentally drop it
---
Take nukashine and get back to your base using only gear you find on the way
---
You got downvoted but I don't understand why? I used lone wanderer all the time until public teams then switched it out - My play style hasn't changed (just do my own thing) but the perks from being on a team (and mutations too) seem to massively outweigh the benefit of lone wanderer unless I'm missing something...
---
Well... It depends why your doors are locked. If they’re locked and they have workbenches behind them, you’re a prick. If it’s locked just because it’s your bedroom or there’s switches you don’t want people messing with in there then you’re good. Either way, it needs fixing.
---
Well, armor is a bit different. I am not playing melee spec. and I dont have any perks to increase duriability / decrease duriability drain. My armor was fine, did not notice any change. Gonna try my melee toon to find out how things are :)
---
I appreciate your suggestion, and I have done most of them. I am mostly looking for zany off the wall stuff.
---
Ohhhh, i forgot you have the option to destroy it. Yikes!
---
It's so frustrating that we spent that time, for free and out of love for the game and community, and they just completely ignored the feedback we gave.
---
If you on xbox bring me the mats ill make you some with my ammo factory perk got it to 3 level. So will give extra 100 percent.
---
Is there a guide or walk through anywhere on how to treasure hunt in 76? I’m really interested and genuinely didn’t know it had an update the last time I dug up treasure was a couple weeks after launch
---
dont know what it is but with my lvl 25 with a lever rifle, its back to "normal" i can sneak around almost one hitting most things with 1 rifleman at max and one at 1. but it did suck abit up until i could use my lever rifle.
---
Yup. I cancelled my 1st. Long time player. I’m out
---
I don’t run speed demon at all. I don’t find it as useful as everyone else does. Two points for a small movement over having to eat/drink more is far more enjoyable for me.
---
How do u load black rifles with 300 rounds... Asking for a friend :p
---
Kill a certain amount of enemies with a terrible weapon
---
What a beast, I knew someone would do it
---
Now do mine
---
Once again, Reddit does not disappoint.
---
I've seen suggestions involving the likes of playing as a full blown alcoholic and downing any alcohol you see as soon as you pick it up, no addictol for the unavoidable addiction either. Or play as support rather than focusing on your own damage output. Honestly with this game the sky's the limit, even maining a weapon/legendary effect you normally wouldn't look twice at is a simple yet effective change of pace and you may even find you like it more than thought beforehand.
---
It's your build, I have a bloodied build that can tank legacy gat plasmas and any in game enemy.
---
of course they cant fix anything they fuck it up even more..
---
while you get a lot of backlash for this post i feel like you are right in a way.
---
Overall im not hating the new update i kind of like it as it makes the gameworld more challenging and its not as hard as some people make it believe, but
---
and here comes the big point, 
---
until they do what they promised and further balance things,
---
they narrowed down your options when it comes down to character builds.
---
The meta is more important than ever
---
fun and wacky builds are not really possible anymore. 
---
Every weapon that was weak and underutilized is even worse now
---
for example laserrifles. they are weak and dont have a lot going for them but you could make them work. Now its even harder if you want to use that weapon
---
and while a big argument here is that not every weapon can be equal and there will allways be "the best" weapons out there, i feel like its kind of crazy with this game.
---
it took the devs 2 years to adjust the damage of the alien blaster, and not only was the increase of 30% damage simply to low to make that thing viable, but it also came at a point where every other aspect of the damage calculations changed and therefore those 30% extra are just enough to make the alien blaster exactly as "effective" as it was before.
---
i totally get behind the reasoning of the damage changes but imo they should have:
---
1) not release those changes together with one wasteland
---
2)the standart perks like slugger/rifleman/gunslinger etc should still work like they did before or lower their perk cost 
---
3) released the patch with those "further balancing adjustments" that are promised, allready included.
---
overall i feel like this patch served the hardcore fans of 76 very well but completely screwed a large proportion of casual players and newcomers.
---
if the pope is disappointed with this game then it's news to me
---
Could it be, stealth isn't working at all in those events? There was no sneaking past anything in there.
---
How many atoms did that cost??
---
At this point I think there is someone with clout on the team who wants the game dead, honestly. Very, very few new players are going to persevere much past Flatwoods when they have no ammo, broken gear, and lack any sort of knowledge of how to advance properly.
---
But why...
---
Haha, I just didn't have the patience. I wanted the gun game, green house, and numerous other items so I just said screw it...
---
All I know is that after 2 years of playing this game I finally got myself to where I could 1 shot everything in Fort Defiance A WEEK AGO and I now do less damage than before my ghoul slayer legendary and finally realizing what bloody mess does.  I don't know all the fun lingo of games and I do know I'm not technically doing less damage it's that they have more HP or whatever, but you can imagine how irritated I am. Especially since it only used to take 2 shots for a wendigo and it now takes 6. I'm a solo player. So, this part of the update does nothing for me except make me suffer lol
---
Actually it was stolen from god.
---
Quad fixer is fantastic. I use mine instead of junkies for most things now. I'll hit maybe 600 sneak headshots with junkies vs 400 damage with quad, which reduces reload 4x, super worth it.
---
I still run low hp for the adrenal and nerd rage :)
---
Early game is going to be even harder, going to use 2x the ammo or more for less experience over all(more per mob, but your killing way slower, 90%?).  Before it was best to hunt mobs below your level that you could one/two shot kill very rapidly.  Now every kill is tough and nothing is below your level.
---
Now they only need to keep listening to us and increase gold and scripts limits, camp budget and stash space.
---
Fix the atom challenges bugs and those would really be some really nice fixes. :)
---
Do you even lift bro?
---
Totally.  I still run it too but I know going in to be prepared to work to finish.   It’s always been a challenge but there is a point at which the work ruins the fun.  I see dead players and I just know they’re stuck in a 60 second respawn, so it’s work and dull. 
---
If they put a chance for Forest Camo Jumpsuit to drop everyone would be all in.  🤪😊🤪
---
Lol why not
---
Well i was thinking of swapping completely away from bloodied.
---
I find the increase in food/water consumption negligible, definitely better than spending perks on running speed, as a matter of fact, you could take the same amount of points into  [Slow Metabolizer](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Slow_Metabolizer) and be better off with speed demon than squad maneuvers
---
0.15% drop chance from all Messenger and Savage Divide events in fact, but who's counting?
---
Just enter the Konami code mate
---
Same. I’ve been playing a long time. I’m done.
---
How in the world would that be superior to being able to cash them in for legendary perks? Who would ever do something so foolish and shortsighted even if it were possible?
---
Inb4 hurr durr original thinking, and trial/error is too hard for me. wah wah.
---
I love sniper skills and always choose this style in every game but if you think about it, it shouldn't be the right build to fight mobs. I think in my hunting rifle more as a side weapon to harm or kill really distant enemies and in my Fixer (that also works for snipping) as my first option for close combat
---
Instigating 2 handers may be the new level up meta
---
[https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/daily.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/daily.html)
---
I am love the update
---
Lv 47 here. Completely agree with every word. Now I need more ammo, more resources for repairs, more food too, because it takes more time to kill anything. 
---
Before patch you could go to places with low level enemies and farm a bit of ammo. Not anymore. Ammo has become more issue than it was. Goyd luck farming more junk and avoiding mobs. 
---
Classic bethesda
---
Just like in real life!  
---
..... I assume.
---
u/ladydevann why do Bethesda hate us builders?
---
Unironically supporting a fascist super soldier army to own fictional commies is a next level take.
---
Bows have taken a really bad hit :'(
---
No hate on OP, glad someone can give us a review, but didn't they say there would be two week gaps before you could purchase season rewards or was that exclusively for season one?
---
Exactly. I feel the same. And I’m level 170 something. Stealth build. I could never one shot a level 50 super mutant. Now it’s going to be impossible. I’m done
---
Well that’s hacked lol, you cannot get explosive gamma guns
---
Equips rank 4, builds massive camp, swaps perk to something better.
---
Never gunna happen man
---
No. I liked it before. Not now
---
They got rid of the gap for season 2!
---
I did a test on the PTS of my two meta builds (Bloodied Heavy PA and Junkies Shotgunner) and my less-than-meta stealth pistoleer who wears the Garb of Mystery and using a TSE .44 Revolver to show the stark difference/gulf between playing meta and playing something fun/different/casual, and most of the comments were people complaining I had somehow unbalanced the test and thus it wasn't sound.
---
Here I stand, sadly vindicated, because it turns out they just couldn't seem to comprehend the point I was trying to make.
---
I hate it too.
---
all npc have a very high perception in Daily ops: you can stealth, but they will see you very quickly
---
Start a new toon. You can only use the commie whacker and grenades. You can't use legendary armour. You can only use food/drink/chems you find. You can't craft or cook anything.
---
That’s fine. We are all different. I don’t find speed demon useful. And during something like daily ops I’d rather give my whole team a speed boost and assume they don’t have speed demon. Which I would have no way in knowing if they do or don’t. And if they do. That fine too. Given my play style squad maneuvers gives more options to work with.
---
Hacked weapon I’m afraid.
---
Yep, discovered this yesterday while.being the only person on an ops team doing ops.
---
That was originally the plan, but they released last week that they were allowing rank up immediately with update 22 roll out.
---
Oh no no, I never meant all of you. Just some. Because there are definitely some bloodied builds out there, crying themselves to sleep over the nerf.
---
I was wondering the same! I was under the impression it was released today but apparently not.
---
Now what are you going to do ingame for the next few months?
---
I'm jealous lol I was wondering where a lot of the plans for those new items were found when I saw them earlier
---
There was a lot of nastiness in players who just wanted their pound of flesh, even if it damaged the game. The irony is that Bloodied is still king for casual killing/farming.
---
Ah I hate this, Ive done it more than a few times and I'm still tempted to rebuild, Ive been putting it off because I'm fairly happy with what I've got and a few guys on this sub Ive helped out along the way have complimented it. But still I always find somewhere that just makes me want to drop that damn camp down and have at it, it's a curse man.
---
If you do move it, take photos of your current one first. Its cool to have a collection of your builds show up as loading screens, and you'll have a reference if you want to go back to it. One of my favorites I had a rooftop bar and facing away from the camera with the sheepsquatch head on, doing the wave pose it looks like I'm downing a glass of whatever alcoholic beverage you'd like to think it was.
---
They were too busy shitting in the woods to comment.
---
If you have a ranged weapon when you bash into them, it wont count, if you have a melee weapon equipped and you bash them with pain train then yes.
---
Play the hell out of it. I just broke my leg in 2 places, and crushed my ankle at work, so I'm going to have plenty of time haha
---
As a 304 player i really love the things in the state there are.
---
Its the smoothest greater patch that i ever seen in this game tbh.
---
That would be great! I love to run around with a clown outfit, pint sized mask and a flaming chainsaw! It was relaxing in the forest.
---
Only 3\* legendary enemies can drop 3\* gear and they have a 33% chance of doing so. When considering spawn chances, in my experience, when finding a random spawn, 45% of legendaries are 45%.
---

---
Nothing.
---
Did It solo in 9 mins, felt quite easy
---
I think that's something on your side buddy. Me and my friends have no issues at all joining public teams.
---
Please add gloves to the Revolutionary General’s outfit. The bare hands throws it off.
---
Nobody needs text chat
---
Thats a hacked weapon , im pretty sure Gamma guns never dropped with explosive , that might explain it lmao :D
---
Ah right, to the scrip machine it goes
---
i am level 101 and my casual generalist loadout got completely fucked; the only thing that does any damage is my instagaining combat shotgun, and somehow a fucking molerat survives a shot to the head? what the fuck, is this what balance means?
---
Sucks
---
Thing is, lvl10 legendaries are worth the same scrip as lvl50 and that's where most of them wind up anyway...
---
Shhhhh
---
I can't use them yet, but found it in the perk menu (Y on pipboy for Xbox). It's at the very top, so go up from your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. then select. A lot are a 10% chance for enemy to explode. Personally can't wait to hit level 50 and use them. Already scrapped loads of shit card pack perks that I'll never use in preparation.
---
Are you using explosive perks with it or just a second crowd control weapon?
---
Even if you do, it’s only for that session. The last thing I did was removing something and put in the fireplace door. Then I’m almost twenty walls over budget. My garden is now way too small.
---
Ahaha, sorry. :(
---
Congrats, but please don't make a post tomorrow complaining that you are bored and there is nothing to do in the game now that you finished the season...
---
Instanced events are teams based, so it kinda makes sense... Just have to get better friends I think xD
---
It's below 20% health, and my health is 78 at 20% plus all the damage mitigation perks makes it not to bad.
---
Oh geez rest up dude hope you heal quickly &lt;3
---
Those too are amazing. I saw.one where the OP then tried to argue with every reply calling them out. It was like watching someone try to fist fight their way out of a zombie apocalypse.
---
They're annoying in packs, especially when they just keep dipping underground and teleporting around you.  And they are a CURSE upon your camp
---
They dont want people to be able to 1 shot anything in the game, not even radroaches.
---
Yeah, seems like Bethesda didn't really succeed with this update. I wanna roll back the game to pre-yesterday-updates... (LVL 104 player here)
---
"It's nerfed. Plain and simple." These words sum up the whole patch. Never better said.
---
Ain't got to worry about that, I'm only level 47 first character, so I have plenty to do haha
---
Lol not anymore
---
With your math, you’re saying you should be able to max 6 legendary perk cards at level 474? That isn’t even close to being right, I’m level 610 with every single perk card capped and scrapping everything else and I can barely cap 4 cards working into a 5th. I could likely level the other 2 to cap but I’d have to completely get rid of every single capped perk card but my minimum loadout.
---
From my math you should have around 1507 perk coins, not 1818.
---
They will censor the text chat... like its goin out of style...
---
Appreciate the kind words bro, means a lot 👍🏼
---
I see. Damn, thats some crazy perception then. I thought im running perfect stealth.
---
But i must admit, i can't stealth thru whitesprings clubhouse anymore bashing surrounding ghouls without them finding me eventually.
---
I rly was a ghost to all enemies before.
---
I never said I was a one shot god. I never copied anyone. I’m not a hard core player and don’t crunch the numbers like some. And because I don’t crunch the numbers this game has become not fun. Don’t tell me to git gud or something. I’m a casual player who has been playing for over a year. I use a death claw gauntlet that did 160 damage and a lever gun that did 130. So don’t make assumptions about players. Not everyone is hard core and plays with 1000 damage weapons. Jerk
---
u/LadyDevann
---
Amazing, thanks!
---
I want the same for the Drill, and some mods. I wanna roleplay Bob the Builder.
---
As someone whose main character is level 350 or so and has multiple high-level legendary perks, allow me to vigorously disagree. Lots of absolute game-changers here.
---
There are other events in the game which are also team based... You dont get kicked randomly while doing colossus problem event. Your argument is invalid.
---
Really nice dude. And here I thought the fo76 community was a good one. Don’t got to be an asshole because I’m a casual player.
---
Sometimes they reply, but they will notice it. These are the only 2 I know of on here. 👍
---
Damn it. We were almost a day through without any reoccurring bugs to speak of.
---
Mirelurk Kings and Cave Crickets were my nemesis until I got 3 armor pieces with poison resist. Now they're just a nuisance. Screw Colonel Gusties though. I wish they had a plasma pistol like in the previous Fallouts instead of this armor shredding miniature assault rifle.
---
Stop whinging and be better at the game.
---
It was far too easy before, now it is much better.
---
Asshole. And no I’ve never played an online game before. Maybe stop being a dick face
---
I respec'ed my main yesterday and intend to monkey around with others this weekend. Getting used to the 20 new perk points. I slotted some qol perks and felt dirty, but then it was easy to swap in my Encryptid setup to do daily ops.
---
Oh crap
---
I had one man army in yesterday on sbq which has 12% cripple chance , I'm using tse 50.cal and she wouldn't land until I stopped shooting she, so not sure what the deal is.
---
I noticed that too 🤔
---
I have no patience to explain every overreacting player about magic damage, so many crybabies downvotting lmao
---
YW bro 👍🏼
---
if it was too easy for you why not just intentionally make your character shit instead of ruining it for everyone? (this will get no replies)
---
As long as they notice it and pass it on, that’s good. I just finally have good stuff to sell and now I darent put my vendors on, I’m so glad the player that noticed it wasn’t an asshole or it could’ve been a different story
---
How much atoms it cost you
---
I'm getting more than a little annoyed with how ammo hungry low level areas/events are now. Used to be fun to zip through the pack leader event, mod up any decent drops, and leave them near the wayward. 
---
Now I'm stuck \*reloading\* in the forest, which just feels odd. And maybe that's the point, but I don't see why it's a bad thing to let players 'slum it' for a little while in low tier sections.
---
That’s just it. I’m casual, but a long time player. It’s not fun anymore
---
Wait, Harpers Ferry had a vendor bot?!
---
Come on man this is Bethesda lmao, I was expecting something. At least the fast travel bug has been fixed though ayyyy? /s
---
Was this in a nuke zone.?
---
No legendary explosive perks, but I have rank 2 demolition expert equipped.  It's my fun weapon I use when I feel like not giving a shit about overkill.  Nothing is more satisfying than lining up a perfect shot in the middle of a crowd of mobs.
---
Hey bud, I'm from the UK. Sometimes on during the day but always on at night time and play abit more at the weekend. Most my buddies left a few updates ago, I've been here since beta and no a thing or two.
---
But that’s it. It’s an rpg. I shouldn’t have to change my style.
---
The DR you would get from barbarian (+80, but only if you have 15! str) is not worth the investment imho, if you mod the scout armor with polymer you will be already in the range of diminishing returns. For special occasions like the robot ops or silo runs, a set of troubleshooter armor works wonders.
---
If you struggle with AP, get 2-3 pieces with AP refresh and mod ultralight. Using Rejuvenated rank 2 instead of sun kissed would boost your AP too (if you keep hunger/thirst full).
---
If you aim for more crits, luck at 15 is the treshhold (does not matter if from special, gear or buffs). 15 luck plus critical savy rank 3 = crit at every 3rd hit (not shot, mind you). Next step for more crits would be luck 33... Maybe a good idea to fill up luck with serendipity to help with survival.
---
I have the blue print but have no need to use it and my camp places fine.
---
I'm level 219 bloodied unarmed since launch. Not having any issues killing anyone or anything
---
Fair enough but your whining says otherwise. There's more than a few casual/new players from here that I've helped get a good start to the game that would say otherwise and frankly you didn't come off like that. If you're not enjoying it anymore don't play, but why whine about it here if that's the case.
---
Yeh I'm gonna close camp because if it's happening with vendors then it can also happen with the punch bowl and a few other items.
---
No, it isn't invalid. There's a difference.
---
In the Daily Ops only your team can access the instance you're in, which means that as soon you're no longer part of said team, the game kicks you out. Because only members from that team can be there.
---
Are you sniffing glue?
---
(this is a reply)
---
"oNlY BlooDiEd pLaYeRs DoNt LikE ThE UpDaTe"
---
🤦‍♂️
---
Yep. I made one of my characters a dedicated Ammo Factory, cranked out 10K 5.56 and 5k .45 like it was nothing. Quad FFR is the way of the future.
---
Step 1: Post your build 
---
Step 2: ask for advice
---
You will get more advice then you need from the people here
---
Step 3: swap a few cards and add some new ones (NEW PERKS)
---
 job done
---
See I couldn’t even one or two shot level 50 mutants. The highest damage weapon I did have was like 130 lever rifle. Sigh
---
Ah fuck I forgot about the display shelves and things doing it too
---
Just did a breach and clear, my right leg was crippled killed everything my heal came back wait a few minutes after as you normally do with healing limbs but nothing but crippling depression
---
So now it basically worthless. Used to work in combat along as out of sight and in cover. They took that away and now it doesn't heal limbs great.
---
that was a shitpost not a reply, just like i predicted
---
Which is?
---
So you want him to take 10 minutes of his time to read up on how to easily craft thousands of rounds of ammo? Maybe another 10 minutes to watch a youtube video on how to have a halfway decent build? How dare you?
---
Pretty much
---
I was really hoping for fallout 76 to be redeemed but it's not looking good.
---
&gt;Everyone who expresses an opinion contrary to mine is being paid to do so
---
After 3300 hours in, do you know how many cards disappeared due to duplication. Deal with it. Quit whining like a bitch.....
---
I got to rank 3 by just doing the challenges, so I purchased 97 ranks which costed 14,550 Atoms. You end up getting back 2,000 Atoms through out the board + 500 Atoms for making rank 100. So all in all about 12,500 Atoms.
---
It is pretty much the same thing, dont try to defend this stupid mechanic.
---
Bloodied commando still works, even with only nerd rage, bloody mess and a bloodied rifle.
---
You melt everything still but you're using around 2-5 extra bullets.
---
It appears that none bloodied commando and heavy gunner builds are a lot worse and that outside 2shot explosive are struggling against a lotta the scaling enemies from user accounts.
---
I'd say its made bloodied more needed than ever.
---
The issue is not for high level players with God rolls.
---
The issue is for low level players having to spend all the ammo they have on a group of mobs, where that ammo takes hours to grind back.
---
It never healed limbs though? I don't remember it ever it. I wlats got crippled by the sbq wing attack and walked with a limp.
---
don't forget the +40%~ average grom duper duper.
---
tbh it looks better than a guy in cow outfit 1hitting everything and everyone. But you got a point here cuz PA has no legendary effects
---
I noticed this to make sure you check the storage tab. For some reason it turned my two bunkers into copies of three bunkers there plus the two already on my site. Erased the extras and it went back to normal.
---
It's the weapon.  I was a crossbow stealth sniper.  I was regularly doing 900 damage per bolt in stealth.  Tried it out in PTS, I was getting 300. 2/3 cut in damage was complete garbage.
---
Just tried my Instigating Gauss rifle as a replacement.  Head shots are 1400, body shots 700. only one 3 card rifleman perk used.  If I used them all I'd be one shotting no problem.  The level 100 Supermutants can be quickly taken out with a  full charge body shot followed  with a quick follow up (you just need a couple hundred more to chunk out the mutant).  Double Tap.  Full stealth, non meta, just stealth maxed out. they still can't find me easy, but blow your cover, run like hell and return.  All enemies are more powerful than before and I usually die because I don't factor in the extra damage they do from the huge nerf and don't use my Vampire's weapon soon enough.  Handmade Vampire's suck... Going to try my Vamp's shottie that was my go to stimpack machine.
---
Good idea hmm
---
It's not a single player game. Its an online game they change all the time if you want a single player rpg where you never have yo change go play FO4. 76 is an online service there will be changes there will be things people dont like. But to cry about it being an rpg I shouldn't have to change is a dumb thing to say for an online game. Again adapt to the change and stop your bitching.
---
For all you rude ppl. So much for fo76 community being nice. I’m not a hard core player. I’m a long time casual player. I have no clue what mobs are or meta. And just found out a few weeks ago what bloodied was. So before you spout hate and rudeness at me, I was just venting about an rpg not being an rpg. But I guess you fanboi jerks can have your game.
---
Vendor glitch?
---
Yep. My shotgun needed repairing 3 times in radiation rumble, I can usually do at least 3 of those events before needing to repair
---
Forest jump suit where, how and give me lol 😆.  I'm in
---
Players can take stuff that’s in your stash through vendors and display cases. I’m shutting all my shit down
---
That sounds pretty amusing I will have to see about the whacker I don't have one.
---
where's my atoms from the last 3 months of fallout 1st, bethesda?
---
I like this idea, but it may be a little more predictable to be like "Forest caps at 15. Valley caps at 25. Divide caps at 35, etc etc"
---
That way you don't need to adjust to party makeup, since you know Manhunt can't go over 25, and the Tea/Canary events can't go over 15.
---
As harsh as you sound you're right, it's people's build that are messing with them, not the nerf.
---
No?
---
What is the name of that weapon and can you craft it? Where can I get it?
---
I'm not defending anything, I'm just explaining why this happens.
---
And it's pretty much the same thing as what?
---
I agree that it sucks that it kicks you out, but at least there's a valid reason for it, it isn't at random.
---
this. I just tanked everything with auto stim, not killing anything.
---
I’ve been doing fine, honestly. I play as a PA rifleman, so the new perks finally allowed me to grab the agility I needed to have sneak away a valid option. With that in hand, my damage output is frankly better than before the patch. Everything was fine, though I hope the next mission type for the ops is something less speed based for the stealth players and riflemen out there. I don’t think shutting down an entire play style for the daily ops is the best move on Bethesda’s part.
---
My man, I would literally jump off cliffs just because I knew my legs would be crippled but healing factor would take care of me.
---
Legit me with a Furious Cultust Dagger, KURVA!
---
Ohh well Cursed Pickaxe will be a godsend against the lesser high levels now, But yes rather poxy now.
---
Your build must be bad. I'm melting lvl 100 muties and not even a bloody build.
---
Just spam stimpacks and you will literally never die.
---
I didn't have much of a problem with the new update till now
---
how long did it take you to melee a bloodbug last weekend and how long does it take you now?
---
Okay then. Looking forward to your review.
---
And this probably includes some of the folks that are voting for Joe Biden who can't remember the beginning of the Constitution...
---
[Heavy gunner build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=d246d6c&amp;d=ic4ir2s12a72a02s71l71lu2la2lt2c62ek1sq2s32sr2s22s01sb0xa1x91x61x71x41x81p72p10ck0ce0ig2ii0l12e31es1&amp;w=l22ls2ib4p02pe2&amp;n=Heavy%20Gunner). I've only invested into the legendary specials but I'll be moving points to charisma as I rank them up more
---
1 hit?
---
Total game changer on my commando, went strength and my carry weight is so much better now :) to be honest my heavy gunner not so much as the only ones I was missing was agi and per but I had enough in charisma for the essential ones and only need enough agility for adrenaline and action boy as I don't vats much with it, went luck in the end as having one gun army and luck of the draw together is really nice ;)
---
What is the point of a post apocalyptic RPG that has no dangers in it?
---
Now we must work harder to survive, in my opinion that is a good thing.
---
Perhaps you should play Mario or Animal Crossing.
---
Terribly harsh update for new players. I am lvl 24 and it is just not fun. Try to go do a mission and I am out of ammo after the first few trash mobs I encounter along the way. Don't want to go back to my camp anymore to repair (if I can even keep enough resources to do that because boy am I going through them) because I know what is waiting for me there every time I port back. There is simply no respite from it. No time to catch a breath and no way to replenish the resources used simply trying to get on and do something productive.
---
It almost feels like I am back at lvl 1 and hitting things with a stick again. Yeah there are all these cool weapons but you can't afford to even think about using them because it will take more clips than you can possibly make before you are out of lead/gunpowder .......so it is back to the stick for you my lad.  
---
I am trying my best to be positive about it because I do really like the game. I really don't understand why it had to be like this either. I have played ESO from the begining and 'One Tamriel' made the game seamless and inclusive overnight. Hence I was not at all worried and even excited for the new patch yesterday. 
---
I hope I can adapt and find a way to make the new system work for me rather than against me. Maybe one day I will get to the point where I can access he cool stuff and retire my stick for good. If that day ever comes I am so going to put my fire axe on a display board and use it as a reminder of trying times :D
---
Thanks for the recommendations! Would serendipity be really worth it considering I run a full-health build? I don't really want to spend much time below 30% health as panic sets in around there ;)  
---
As for armor, AP refresh is pretty expensive which is why I don't have them (yet). Probably need to wait for SS armor plans and craft them and hope for a miracle.
---
I put a point into infiltrator, freed up some perk points, and finally took the time to add bloody mess and the last 3 ranks of the applicable weapon damage perks. Now doing 45% more damage, I feel weaker than I have in maybe a month. It's making me want to skip engaging with other players for events, because I chew up so much ammo. Which I guess is offset by the ammo legendary perk, but in that case.... Why?
---
Am I excited/enjoying making 70 rounds at taking 7 shots to kill things, versus making 35 rounds and 2-3 shots to kill them? Are bigger numbers just supposed to be "fun" here?
---
So around $125 USD if you had purchased the atoms
---
Perhaps you should play a game with perma death.
---
I moved back up on Seneca rocks lol, no enemies there 😁
---
tbh you don't know the inner workings. Maybe it was affecting servers in a negative way. Maybe there was some obscure exploit linked to it that was an actual problem.
---
My Camp is right up against Clancy Manor, so I don't get random spawns and the enemies that spawn at the manor aren't close enough to attack my camp. I still have to go over to my brother's to update though, since we live far outside town and have a data cap.
---
I think many others feel similarly. It's not anything big but a bunch of small annoyances from dedicated players.
---
I found a perk in charisma that dose 5% more damage after hitting enemy
---
Imagine how much unarmed damage you could do if you were strength 100 and drank a vintage nukashine.... maybe kill the queen in just a few hits
---
If you had the patience to get to 100 strength... That's impressive. In a sad way, but still. I absolutely used the bench x3 at a time, but that's enough to make my carry problems disappear for a half-hour.
---
\+2 strength is a big bonus but the animation takes long enough that it's not worth grinding too much for a bonus that isn't going to last.
---
The blaster still needs a faster way to obtain its unique ammunition, though. I’ve also heard that the damage output still isn’t great, but I can’t confirm that since I haven’t tested on my gunslinger.
---
what system do you play on?
---
&gt; If something isn’t changed about this (i.e. an opt in/out system) I’m most likely done with FO76 for the time being
---
Okay? Good for you? Goodbye.
---
This seems like a really pathetic hill to die on.
---
People with poor builds and a lack of skills are the only ones complaining.
---
2 atoms have been deposited into your account.
---
Playing game is not only shooting enemies, it's also about planning, combining effects and putting effort to it.
---
I got healing factor to save on stimpacks so it's just a big off.. I still play hopefully the turn this one around tho
---
The game barely changed. I’m bloodied on two characters, lost a very small amount of damage. Still easy to kill everything. Melee got reset to where it should be. Too bad, so sad.....
---
Seriously, you need more practice.
---
I fully understand what you mean... Like I used to have a back up weapon but now it just feels like a waste of my resources to even put in the effort to use it. It just feels like that game decided "oh you chose that stick now use it you can't use anything else without crippling yourself.
---
Whilst melee is weaker now, it is still very much a viable choice. So far, the best prefixes I've found are Instigating and + power attack. Both of those together can one-shot most trash mob enemies.
---
It's a death tambo, I think it's craftable, but I'm using a legendary version with 40% faster swing speed. And I have all 3 legendary melee explosive and area of effect perks equipped.
---
Definitely
---
Your not supposed to be 1 shotting level 50 + creatures, even radroaches. Unfortunately everyone is used to doing that so certain types of people are going to whine.
---
Hell yeah, enjoy hiking thru Appalachia!!! Without that season stress weighing on you you’ll heal up right quick
---
Daily. 
---
Sorry lol. I had to. I think it’s 24s from when u did it
---
I like your style.
---
Yes...   :).  "Went to a nuked Morgantown today"
---
don't forget that if you kept lockpicking and hacking perks on  you, that's 6 more free points with the Infiltrator perk.
---
Oof - was kinda counting on getting the plans with my heavy and handing it down to my lvl 50 melee alt...
---
I literally just beat some mole miners to death with a fss bone hammer and I run commando
---
This. Exactly. As a mainly solo full health stealth, no bloodied, no junkies and no PA my not god rolled handmade that used to get me through the game without much trouble is now burning ammo and resources to be repaired a f* lot. At least they could have increase ammo capacity. Not fun when you are ass beaten from all sides and well, 25 ammo are gone and your character reload painfully slow.  By the way, daily npc requiring npc to be put down using melee is a joke.  As if we can freely switch points all around to adapt builds.
---
Edit: This is my opinion and I totally understand people who are enjoying this new update.
---
I dumped my Secret service and went back to the full UY scout armor with shrouded/sleek and ultralight.   Seems to be doing the trick.  My  B/33/ms Handmade went from 1100-1200 to 250 a shot on the same level range, the b/50/15v Lever gun went from 2k+ to around 600.
---
Been a really kick in the ass of my build though I wont lie.  Feels like I spent all the time building it up only for it to be made null and void.  But im giving it a shot or just might get another character done.  Might just move on as it seems a real kick in the joules.
---
Did your legs heal over time or was it instantly? I've jumped off cliffs as well but healing factor never healed unless it took some time to walk normal again. I always stimmed after I got crippled.
---
Yeah, I have a level 265 bloodied build with a couple of nice rare guns I got lucky on finding. Since the patch, I have seen my ammo use jump up, but the new legendary ammo crafting perk should balance that. 
---
All combat is more difficult but manageable with my build and gear. However, the one thought that I have kept having since this patch hit has been "damn, if it is this hard for me, how the f*#% is someone without an optimized build and good gear going to do this?"
---
I may start a new character next and not pass any gear or resources to it to test things out and see if I can find any advice to offer.
---
Whats all in the "bundle" for the last reward? For me there is no preview pics :(
---
Well, my bad then. for me everything  that can be worn is kinda an outfit but i guesss you mean stuff like the Brotherhood-Uniform and comparable items. Also, you might have gotten lucky with your three drops for that item. I cant even remember how often i punched the lights out of poor Earle and i still didnt get it yet. So, gratz :p
---
One thing i do like about the higher levels, naming is fantastic. Scorched annihilator sounds amazing 
---
 . . .for something just wielding a wrench XD
---
Just seems like a lazy way to increase time spent in your game (money for beth)
---
It was always a minute or so after my heal fully recovered
---
That’s just such a waste of money XD
---
this ops will require people to adapt. maybe a suit of power armor or a set of troubleshooter armor and an auto pistol with vampire effect may help you.
---
I’m ps4
---
Do a daily op bare fisted (huge advantage: your fists never break...)
---
Cause most people have 5 intelligence just laying around.....🤦‍♂️
---
No that much. I was running with 30+ Strength and doing like 29 damage to Earl with food buffs. I’m guessing this will put my damage at like 100 per hit? 😂
---
I like your thinking 👍🏼
---
I get that, but that feels so arbitrary. What are we building toward then? Also what’s the real difference between a one shot and a two shot other than an annoying artificial barrier?
---
Did they not buff the extractors at all? I kind of assumed they would be buffed to respectable levels, like turrets.
---
Dude I'm level 100 plus now on several characters and it feels the same. Even the crazy high levels like 300 plus must feel something different
---
As a bloodied rifleman pretty much endgame I feel you dude, I tested on a behemoth all my damage numbers before and after the patch, and my BE25 Tesla alone has went from 3.4 with all multiplier to 370-380 which is a joke, yes the game needed readjusted however my heavy feels stronger which makes no sense and my rifleman is hitting for non legendary weapons levels of damage, it’s a joke. 
---
This patch did a lot of good for game balancing and readjusting however I don’t think it’s fair how some builds have had maybe 5-13% damage reductions and yet others have had 68-78% damage reductions.
---
Yeah, same for me, level 124. I hopped on this morning to check out the patch and went to fight some Scorched. Ended up burning through most of my ammo on different guns, had my armour broken, my guns broke, had to use stimpaks every 10 seconds, I even died a few times. Seems strange when fighting basic enemies which I usually fight everyday. Not even going to bother with fighting higher-up enemies anymore. Might actually end up quitting the game due to this update, which is sad as I've been playing since the beginning.
---
I similarly have gained many levels through crafting, and less so from events/quests.  I have my camp near the lighthouse in the forest, as it was a 'safe' place to scrap and build, without it constantly falling victim to scorchbeast or similar attacks.  
---
While there are spawns nearby they were easily taken out by my turrets before.  Yesterday, after the update they were level 50 scorched and protectrons.  I ran through a bunch of 45 and shotgun rounds just to clear the area.  
---
Whilst it was fun at first, it is going to become a grind.  They should have either levelled up the enemies (but still no 50 in the forest) or reduced ballistic weapon damage...  not both at the same time!
---
Haha thx
---
non-fallout 1st members aren't even a thought at all for beth as they don't contribute free money on a monthly basis
---
There's also a theory that it resets at the same time that the daily challenges do.  I guess we'll see tomorrow.
---
I’m enjoying it so far. Chewing through more ammo so an ammo storage chest would be nice, but otherwise good so far
---
Armor Ace Eagle Stein, 500 Atoms, Armor Ace Game Board, Ace Full Assault Player Icon,
---
Ace Full Assault Power Armor Paint.
---
It’s an online rpg
---
Who cares about the extractors...MAX LVL DROPS!!! Lol. No it does suck having to repair them more often but hell, when I silhouette I just let one die anyway
---
There is literally nothing hard to kill in this game. Get gud.
---
And you could be nicer buddy. It doesn’t hurt ya know.
---
I was thinking of investing in the legendary luck perk to be able to use more vats crit cards to improve lost damage albeit not with every shot I fire
---
Save as evidence and hack the shit out of the game. When they ban you throw this in their face
---
Apparently even Bethesda doesn't read their own terms and conditions.
---
Triple. That's what it would take to compensate for the crappy weapons.  They won't do it, they are so stingy with the buffs, but liberal with the nerfs.
---
paid bethesda shill: BUT IT WAS SO EASY BEFORE!!!
---
Isnt that kinda illegal?
---
Ok good to know I shouldn't save these up and should go ahead and cash them in as I get them.
---
I've got 80 or so and was waiting til I had 200+ before even checking!
---
Cyberpunk has nothing to do with 76 and they literally listened
---
Fasnacht will be so much fun. No more worries about explosive bait, one single super mutant tossing molotov will take out the entire bunch in no time.
---
I was looking forward to the Halloween skin on my fixer but nope, that skin is bugged.... kinda numb to all the bugs in this game now
---
I tried full health commando with AA/25/25 handmade on the pts. Don't fall for it. This build is much more less effective then bloodied. You losing a lot special stats and damage for nothing. With legendary special perks you can be nearly immortal even on low health.There is more then enough extra points for defensive perks without losing any damage and QoL perks. With weapons above you will deal absolutely zero damage and any bloodied automatic rifle even with 1 star will give much more impact. The final choice is yours, I'm just trying to make your game  more efficient and easier.
---
the point is that you have to spend way way way longer in the game to achieve anything so that they can boost their numbers
---
Exactly they constantly change if you want something that never does go play. A single player rpg.
---
Nah power armor isn't needed. But not all builds will be viable in the daily ops. When I do the daily ops now I take off all sneak perks and put on damage and survival perks. Like I got 14 agility and put on 5* adrenaline 3* dodgy 3* gun fu 3* enforcer. The only other survival perk I got is serendipity but it's more than enough to tank multiple Mr gutsy anti armor shots and robobrain rail gun shots.
---
What build diversity? Most players was bloodied and they remain, wow such a diversity we had before
---
Yeah if I would of had to spend the money strictly to unlock the ranks, I wouldn't of done it, but I had a little over $250 in my Microsoft account for months now and decided to use some of it 😁
---
Holy poop, gonna have to take all me things down now
---
If 100 is a high level then I guess I'm a high level but I don't have a god roll weapon and I can kill just fine, just actually takes more than a few shots now which makes perfect sense. If ammo is your only issue there are plenty of ways to get ammo and perks to increase amo output on creation so unless you're too lazy to make ammo, ammo shouldn't be an issue, like ever.
---
I am one of them! And I'm glad that I have something to do with my character, it didn't make sense before, as it wouldn't change much in a fight.
---
So I have to take me display case down too.?
---
With this season one my mind missing a few days. Nothing really seemed worth it.
---
HA! JOKES ON YOU! 
---
ITS AN ENCLOSED SPACE AND I'M A MELEE BUILD!
---
FINNALY MY TIME TO SHINE!!!!!!
---
It depends on the “mutations” that the faction has (in this case robots). For today’s they had the resilient one which means they have to be killed with a melee attack and also piercing gaze one the which grants greatly enhanced perception.
---
I’m guessing the higher perception is allowing them to negate the sneak build somewhat though hopefully the next ops might have a different mix of mutations that will allow different builds to have an advantage/disadvantage at different times.
---
Take it down completely! They just told me that they could still access my vendor even with no power to it
---
Either this guy is on beth's payroll or he should be...jesus christ
---
I’m sure I didn’t get that stupid window.  I figured the mechanic out in less than 5 minutes, but it is not fun.  
---
Hi we require you to invest 15 stat points to a gun so it does any damage.  Melee required, good luck.  Gun bash is so effing slow the mobs are dodging.
---
We have to level to change builds.  Bethesda’s: Hi we made your build irrelevant and gave you no method to respec builds and now we added a stupid mechanism to an op that is a daily.
---
I liked the game 72 hours ago but now it is a dumpster fire.
---
SS armour sounds bad out of context
---
damn consoles 2, fuck
---
I’d recommend it for the time being
---
As long as those darn mutants stay off of my lawn!  
---
I imagine a lot of areas are now going to be hellish to set up camps.  It's a real shame if you picked a great spot and have been set up for ages.
---
It’s almost like the enclave have been the bad guy twice in the fallout games... some people enjoy being part of the assholes not everyone wants a happy wasteland
---
Of course, they nerfed the meta buffs.
---
speaking of that do you know what the name is for that one card that gives I think, a 30% chance to recieve double of the item you crafted?
---
It’s Fallout not Dark Souls.
---
I was looking at a luck card that repairs your weapon. Anybody use it?  If I have to rely on my lever action it's going to break every 10 minutes
---
I'm off for the night. But I'll do first thing in the morning.. can this happen with the collectron or  mining hoppers??
---
There is also legendary perk for sneak damage
---
Thanks for info just going to lock all my doors etc. No doubt id put the case away and the auto scrap will use some of my items to craft stuff.
---
Oh ok I guess I never let it regen on it own.
---
If the game population is less than a certain amount (like 22 or sumn) then it starts automatically at a later zone
---
Well I am level 45 now on new char and I find this patch really good, my legs are now powerfully how they supposed to be. I'm happy with these changes.
---
You Know ir demolition expert affect too the legendary perks?
---
If it's any consolation it is also interfering with my calm at level 54.
---
I feel like an overheated sentrybot right now.
---
All door missions are spawning full level for all enemies and with a full map, with 30% or so being boss level enemies. When I was level 24 I was cussing about the F you  charred ghouls that spawn everywhere at level 68, and lots of 40's and 50s but mixed in with even level it was tense, though often annoying. This is a whole new level.
---
After getting scrubbed repeatedly I tried switching up tactics 
---
I switched to running stealth, no joy, whole map get's magic esp. (And no, for the peanut gallery the were NORMAL missions, not the new OPs. Everything is now a bullet sponge. 5 clips of 5.56 to the head w explosive rounds to drop on guy. Thats with 2 levels of stealth, and cameleon parts in the armor set.
---
Try to get strategic? no joy, using a syringer to debuff damage resistance appears to have made them tougher instead of weaker.
---
Get them below 1/2 heath? they run off and then 3 seconds later glitch and run back at you at full health. One map spawed 4-5 mirelurk kings. Even separating them and taking them one at a time, took about 50 hits from a +++ legendary RailRoad gun, most of which were headshots, many of which were steath crits, with better criticals, covert op, etc.
---
Literally 2 days ago I was soloing over level scorchbeasts with less ammo then I'm now wasting on scorched, ghouls, and bugs. Nothing drops even a quarter of what it took to bring them down. Half my guns are worn out, half my armor is broken, and I literally wasted an hour trying to round up enough scrap and caps to just replace the stimpacks and Railroad ammo I burned through.
---
Gonna sleep on this and try again tomorrow, but this was not a good first impression for the new season.
---
I like it overall.
---
As a bloodied I kind of like the new scaling I’m not just one tapping 90% of things. Now put me in the ops and I’m running 75%+ hp just so I don’t want to blow my brains out. Half the time I’m perfectly lined up for my resilient finishing weapon quick melee and it doesn’t connect. 40 stims later and a participation rank I likely won’t try that again solo. Lol
---
monotonous was an answer to the fact that the endgame was essentially grind, now it's still fucking grind, but you spend 10X more time killing enemies, woopie
---
You silly goose
---
I wanted the Platinum icon that was datamined. It's not on the board. Welp, no SCORE grind for me.
---
Snowflake crybabies dont like the challenge, be rdy for downvotes lol
---
Visual bug, restart the game or view it on their website
---
Agreed. Only the building flamethrower trick patch I regret deeply. Guess all my camps are legacy now.
---
I do feel sorry for all those low level players that are now in desperate need of ammo though. Seems like BGS made a mistake there.
---
But yeah, overall a good patch with some clear indications that they take our feedback seriously.
---
Oh thank you.  I live near Berkeley Springs!
---
Like the buff to the alien blaster +30% of a low number is still a low number. Should have doubled in damage at least
---
That's the problem BGS created. They slavishly cater to bloodied. I dont' want to play bloodied.  I want to play stealth sniper.  Any build should, at it's peak,be equal or only fractionally better than any other build at the same level.  That' s true RPG.  This is just lazy as hell balancing that will make this game unattractive to new players. I have 7 alts and the first 50 levels sucked until you unlocked starched genes and access to higher level weapons. I can't imagine what taking a lvl 1 to 50 would be like now, definitely not fun.  BGS just killed any new players from sticking with the game.
---
Definitely. Theres been changes made beyond purely effecting dmg multipliers being additive. With an Instigating lever action, 2.5 multiplier and body shot on a max lvl (68 or whatever) supermutant, I was previously able to 1 shot (that's with no other multipliers, to offset the additive change).
---
Now, with the same Instigating lever, 3.5 multiplier, head shot and lvl 50 supermutant (low level thats been scaled to my own), I don't always kill 1 shot.
---
That's meaning with this scaling to level, that supermutants defence has to be like that of a lvl 150-200, but its lvl and its experience gained is that of only lvl 50.
---
Once, me and two other dudes pulled out tesla rifles for this. Got like 20k XP and a slideshow, but it was so much fun.
---
Yeah more p2w for fo1st please (no). Maybe infinite stash also???
---
This. I'm a Bloodied Sneak Commando build so I just slot out all of my AGI perks and throw in Evasive, Dodgy, Adrenaline, Moving Target, Action Boy and pick up a Bloodied DCG. Worked out better than expected.
---
Must be nice.  My load time is longer on older Xbox.  By the time I load from death they are already on top of me and I am at 50% life.
---
Yes lol might not even play through this one seeing the new patch for myself
---
I'm trying to work out what perks are now worth spending points on with my rifle sniper, and I found that with an instigating bolt action I can ALMOST kill level 100 super mutatnts (what ive been testing on) in vats head shots.    
---
I've been seeing that a lot of my perks are just... kinda useless quite honestly.  Sneak attacks for some reason are doing less damage than vats headshots, Bloody Mess adds like 10 damage... Right now I'm trying to focus more on criticals, but honestly I don't see a ton of extra damage there.  A lot of stuff feels really pointless, and there's really not anything to replace it with.
---
Wait.... It's open? Like for free to look around? Damn night shift.
---
I still think its worth it for the 11 script.
---
This is your second thread in 10 minutes about this, I’ve been playing melee since I started a month ago and I one shotted things before the patch and 1-3 shot them now. I’m bloodied so one time while on my way to capture Dolly Sods workshop for the daily challenge, I encountered a level 100 Yao guai that one shot me. Instead of making 6 threads an hour on reddit about it I thought “cool, there’s finally a challenging enemy in the regular game” and played tactically sneaking up on it. The distant calls of irradiated life masked the sound of leaves crunching softly underfoot whole the moonbeams glittering overhead. With the sneak multiplied power attack I was able to kill it in 3 hits before it could hit me. There was the hiss of a jet engine, the crack of a bear skull, and the mire fell silent. I got a ton of XP and thought wow that was sick. In addition to legendary perks, melee  just got a huge indirect buff in the form of the workout bench which currently can give you something crazy like +40 strength if you use it for the whole half an hour.
---
Oh man, I didn't even think about that.
---
I hope they have the sense to scale the Robots too, but these are the Fallout 76 Devs we're talking about...
---
Thanks for your contribution
---
Bloodied still does way more damage then any other build, just not unrealistically. I'm a full health unarmed character (mostly), my damage output has also reduced by about 30 percent. But with the new legendary perks I can compensate it roughly. The gameplay has got more exciting for me since the update.
---
Maybe try a different build? There has to be something else you like? If not, give them a try. 
---
I play without using weapon/armor perk cards, just the ones that give you extra stimpak health, carry weight, etc. and have enjoyed trying to find what works best. It just takes some time to figure it out.
---
They need to buff all the weapons ASAP. Low cadency weapons are useless right now and every player that starts playing will get burned out soon wasting 50 rounds of ammo to kill a single mob.
---
Real good players go play csgo to fill the time
---
Yup. But I got hate for dating say anything bad about 76. Not that I haven’t been playing the game for a long time too. Not that I wasn’t invested in the game too. Being told to stop whining. Nice folks on this game. I don’t play any other online games because ppl are assholes. They didn’t use to be on 76. Now, not so much.
---
shit that is correct so they would roughly be half of that then so around 2 K
---
Same build. I ran Daily Ops and a few assorted Events yesterday with a BSS Gauntlet and I'm not spec for melee. I had a lot of fun. Why are people saying Melee is dead I don't know
---
Yeah I’ve used it but only with the first rank and it did seem to repair often so worth a shot.....pardon the pun 😅
---
Gonna be at the Atom Shop at some point.
---
Tenderizer?
---
They should change it to item space. So you can put so many items into it not weight.
---
Cause in theory at present you could have 8000 outfits in your stash but only 50 or so heavy weapons. That doesn't make sense, if server load is the actual reason.
---
No the enemies keep trying to fall back, so when my incredibly slow-mo bash comes out it whiffs.
---
I have two bloodied characters. The nerf is barely noticeable, if you run blocker, serendipity, and have full SS unyielding armour. Takes three shots to kill stuff instead of two......
---
I don't know but I put Grenadier (double explosive radius) on just in case
---
You dont have to explain, mate :) I was building my toon since the launch, trading for the best possible items :)   
---
I am solo player too, I completely feel your pain and frustration :/
---
When we talk low level-high level i would say above 50 is high ish.
---
But having a shotgun at level 1-50 before you would usually 1-4 shot mobs.
---
now we are talking 10-15+ shots for 1 mob
---
making mobs bullet sponges does not make it more fun and challenging, just more tedious
---
I think you overlook a lot of things:
---
-You don't *need* to kill anything until the last wave, you just need to stand close to the device. Of course killing npc make things a easier (because they can't try to kill you once they are dead ;) )
---
-You only need to do 1 melee damage to kill them, when they have the resilient mutation, you don't need any melee build for that
---
-It's a team work.
---
Well, it is a 'shit-hits-the-fan' perk not only for bloodied builds and seems to proc reliable. I have a full-health gunslinger and commando and both use at least rank 1, if you want to up your crit rate and need more points in luck anyway it would be a good choice.
---
Armor - are AP refresh pieces in player vendors so expensive nowadays? I collected mine over time so I can't tell.  If you are already close to SS armor, it is probably better (cheaper) to not invest too much in upgrading scout armor.
---
Yeah it seems right after every update the Beth defenders come out in full swing and shoot down any and all criticism of the game claiming you need to go play other games or "le git gud". You have to understand for them this is their entire life and they will not accept someone attacking their precious baby.
---
I think I can be of help my friend as we have very similar play styles.
---
okay, the rest is quite legit, but article 1.2 is going TOO FAR. Can't believe they'd try and sneak that one in.
---
Yeah, so many downvotting soft crybabies today, its p2w already, no need to be even more unfair
---
RIP my Instigating, swing speed combat knife. I even bought you an atomic shop paint and gave you a name (Needle).
---
You will be missed dearly.
---
Very strange. I play (depends on situation) on low/full health using Uny SS armor, junkies weapons (auto rifles). 
---
Yes, I have adrenal reaction &amp; use Nerd rage with low health to a) increase dmg; b) increase resist. Yes my Special is much better on low health taking into account +3 on armor
---
Sometimes (bosses) I use PA replacing some perks to heavy weapons (JE GatPlasma or Mini)
---
But I don’t have any problems to kill any creature on Wastelands. Yes. I have to use 3-4 shots instead of 1-2, but legendary perk for ammo crafting covers all my needs
---
Go back to playing GTA online? The only damage that’s grossly lacking rn is to Earl (I assume the queen will be similar). Sneak is pretty useless too but I think both of these will be balanced eventually.
---
Wah wah wah, why do you feel so entitled , stop being a cry baby. The game is scaling properly now. Im farming Westek and the level 3 Super mutants are level 100. I used to 1 shot these things.. Not anymore! Now its a challenge, and thats fine because it was a joke before. The items they drop are alot better also.
---
It always was for me
---
its okish for trash mobs... but its dead for bosses now.
---
if I wasn't plagued by the goddamn respawn bug then I wouldn't have an issue dying in the wasteland but since that one has been ignored I might have to stop playing. Nothing more frustrating than losing loot and time spent after you die once in an event and are stuck looking at that God awful respawn screen
---
Match I just joined had 24 so we just made it to a normal size map.  Haven't joined a match in weeks for the challenges either and forgot to turn off team fill.  I apologise to the two people currently on my team while I sit in this bush. I'm just after score but I feel like a jerk.
---
Damnit you're right, humanity is just a a repost of God
---
Agree an item limit would be more effective then a weight limit.
---
🤞
---
He’s telling you we don’t all play melee bruh
---
Yes sir. I forgot the name and im not on atm
---
They're just a bunch of silly goose
---
The difficulty is as artificial as the "content" this game gets.
---
He responded to someone talking about optimised melee builds
---
Collect a full set of Troubleshooters armor and you will be golden. I wore 5 pieces and it helps a ton. I do that in the silos too. I did the ops once today along with one other person. We did it in just under 12 min and neither of us died. I highly recommend troubleshooters armor for hoards of robots.
---
levels used to mean nothing, now they do
---
Main character is melee with a tenderizer,  a few extra hits for some things but its really not adding time to my play through.
---
Solo'd the daily ops at 16 minutes,  will just get faster go and dont piss fart about with a lot of bots.
---
What do I need to do to avoid this? Is it people buying everything from my vendor and that gives them access to my stash (so set a few 30k cap items and I’m ok?) or is just having a vendor making me at risk?
---
You don't have clearance to read their updated terms of service.
---
I like the most how we can now switch between different builds more freely. Such a breath of fresh air.
---
You get 50 perk coins for reaching level 50. Any further coins you get are from scrapping unwanted perks, they're not automatic.
---
I f I remember correctly normal fire is half charge
---
Your vendor and display cases, I think there are other things too, best just to store everything
---
Lmfao don’t worry if they’re regulars they know you’re a filthy bush Wookiee and are going to win without you
---
The balance doesn't bug me unlike the silly and arbitrary ops challenges rules. 
---
Perceptive I can see ... give them scanners and bright lights. The must-melee-to-kill is hard to rationalize and seems entirely focused on griefing VATS gunners.
---
Otherwise I'm seeing some efficiency loss but the qol from legendary are letting me be a bit more generous with gear to carry.

This is fine when using your gauss rifle, really you would want at least lvl 1 versions of all 3 heavy weapon damage perks when using the 50cal.  If you are running a full health build, anti armor , vampires , or junkies is what you should be searching for if you want a tad more killing power / survival. Are you hoarding so much you need all the weight reduction perks in strength? I use a chemists backpack to keep my chems light.  There are better perks to be had in that tree like blocker.  Might want to consider serendipity in luck and dodgy in agility.
---
Get follow through legendary perk card. Adrenaline makes your damage increase after kill and follow through increases the damage the longer the  contact. Gun fu also helps from using vats. Idk what they did to vats costs but I can't test it cause I can only vats hit enemies like 3 or 4 times before I run outta ap now. Before the update I could vats all day but the perks I mentioned help with damage and ammo conservation.
---
Vats actually works less than it did before the patch, and I didn't think it was possible to make it worse. Leave it to bethesda
---
Might be more of an issue in that the game was supposed to be playable w/o power armor on most maps, and with a variety of builds. Now, only superbrokenmonkey builds in full PA are tolerable and everything else is barely possible, or just not possible at all. We all shouldn't have to play broken builds to play at all. Also try to remember what life was like before you unlocked every single perk card.  Not all of us can reconfigure to match the new brokeness with the slotting and cards we have on hand.
---
Gonna give them a few days to take a look at whats happening with this patch, and issue a mea culpa.
---
Build something stupid and unimmersive, like a doll house or pirate ship or skyscraper! Or something very small when you wait for that true inspiration. 
---
When I get the urge to build something new, but I like my current camp, I take over the Tyler county dirt track and do some practice builds and test my ideas. Also I do a lot of camp hopping and look at what other people have build.
---
Entitled because I paid for the game.  You still don’t have to be an ass fanboi
---
I did it yesterday with a (non sneak) gunslinger, key was a set of troubleshooter armor and a vampires western/plasma flamer. Incomming damage reduced by 75% and the vampire weapons kept me healthy, around 9 minutes solo. We will see how it works out with another enemy type...
---
do you have a masters degree? you should try history.
---
There’s been some improvements to the game, placing multiple items in camps and workshops I’ve noticed are a lot smoother the game doesn’t have to think about it too hard now, the daily ops are great my only issue is what were low level areas where you could go to and just explore and have a chilled session you can no longer do I feel as though casual players will stop playing the game all together I’ve had to change my play style completely and it will take some getting used to but it’s got to be worth giving it a chance though.
---
I know its economy can't work without someone having to be enslaved or oppressed in some form. No thanks, Free States has to go. Looking at China right now, I know it's pretty awful. The collective, always lacked three things: freedom, ownership, identity. Vendor Bot Wallace wasn't really practical even for a vendor bot, still used capitalism to sell people plans.
---
WAAAH HARD GAMES BAD EASY GAMES GOOD EFFORT BAD INSTANT GRATIFICATION GOOD YOU'RE NOT MY REAL DAD.
---
To clarify, I don't run a "build", I just have Heavy Gun perks, standard crafted armour, standard weapons, zero mutations, zero addictions, zero anything else, and the game is fine.
---
Stop whining just because you actually have to press buttons now.
---
Awesome, what's your GT?
---
L352 here. Ran it for first time with a rando L7 still in his vault suit and party hat and hunting rifle.
---
It actually worked okay. He got a lot of the robits down to where they were red, and I could one-hit them with my DCG. I’m bloodied so he was actually tanking for me. :)
---
It took us a long time but I didn’t mind that for a first run. Reasonably good experience overall.
---
Seems that way. I’ve played the game for a long time too. I’m entitled to criticism on something I paid for. Sigh. Oh well.
---
yeah i'm a casual player and i'm just going to do the daily challenges from now on and that's it
---
What don't you like about it? We can now scrap redundant cards for legendary cards- that's nothing but helpful
---
I was looking for a post like this before I made one.
---
Mostly relief, yes.
---
The rewards are lame. Except the greenhouse, which is dead LAST on the board. The one thing I want.. 
---
Last season I started kinda late and busted ASS to get as far as I could. Ended up buying the last few levels with earned atoms... but the amount of time and energy I had to spend to grind that shit out... changed my entire playtime for over a month. Was not fun.
---
One glance across this board and I knew immediately the rewards are not enough to convince ME to grind score this season. 
---
Hopefully the greenhouse set is available somewhere else later... but if not I've already decided I dont care.
---
Oh ok, thanks, played many games, never seen that before, I assume like most people they stopped once they finished the legendary run, and that must be why there are less players
---
Aw umad :(
---
That hurts, son.
---
The amount of cards needed to scrap and that it punishes anyone who ever moved oerk points
---
Only took 10 minutes
---
No, YOU go clean YOUR room.
---
Last I check there is a bug with vendors and displays atm anyways
---
Noone did that even after lvl 10 before, now they do, cuz those scorched give nice exp and spawn in waves. Its a harsh wasteland, not a Disneyland, where distracted dweller can afk near to molerat
---
I literally wrote this on my on my guilds discord today. I've been a sneak sniper from day 1, then I got pushed towards needing to be a sneak commando in world events and sniper in general adventure, now I can't even be a sneak sniper in adventure and daily ops means I cannot sneak at all, I have to be full commando, but I've got no points in strength/endurance, so im just a pile of jelly.
---
They are shoehorning people more and more into only a couple viable builds.
---
Ask your mother.
---
Games should be accessible for all so everyone can enjoy them. But go ahead with your elitism.
---
Unarmed really doesn't take strength into account with attacks any more since the damage calculations were changed. There was a big post on the PTS about it.
---
I kept several weapons to work on those damned "kill 1101 robots with a fishhook" type challenges, every time I FTed to Vault 76 I would kill 6-8 level 1 liberators with a trash weapon to help with that.  Sad times indeed.
---
And all that people saying "I'm still doing it pretty well, I don't get the complaints", go play something else that isn't your commando build, and then we'll see if you still have the same opinion.
---
You baited me hard. Came here expecting negativity :)
---
First I've heard of it. It's not in the patch notes.
---
Reading most of the Thread ;D 266 Comments atm. 
---
But you are all right, most of the Players don´t read the Description.
---
I start as Melee in the Beta (still around 250, leave the game a long time) and switch today back to Melee from my Heavy Build (God-roll Grognak Insta + SS + 1S) and it cuts the Gustys like Paper solo, Slugger Perks only Rank 1 and 3 in Armorpen. 
---
You can teleport your Mule/Trader into the Ops (Mule at around 1500kg) stay at the entrance and get the rewards as well :D
---
But the Burrows are to long to get it Solo in Time, 10 tries best time is 8:13 Solo or i need a better Gun the Shredder the Boss faster. If you like to kill  the mobs do it if you like to stay passiv activate the Transmitters go to a corner and hit them with Vampier Melee (faster = better) - MedX and or get a Anti Robo Armor -75% Damage if you have a full 1Star Set the Gutsys can´t kill me and im not playing a Min/Max build.  
---
So as Endgame Content it feels to easy if i can Solo it by only killing a bunch of bots or staying passive around 95% of the time and pumping Stims inside my character its not a challenge, and if you have a full team full of Chars like mine the Boss melts in seconds so its only a pathing challange like dont get lost in the burrow. 
---
Wave Defense, no re-spawn with rewards by Time Survived and more Damage over Time or more enemy's will be a nice idea for the future.
---
Lol now that means instead of coming home to a nice little lvl 1, 5 group of bots,  ghouls or mutants while camping near wayward you come home to 5 mofos the same level as you yikes lmao.. They're going to wreck my camp.
---
Same here and the final Boss got glitched into a machine where I couldn't hit but once every 100 or so swings. Fortunately, it helped me stay close enough to kill it. Took me over 30 minutes and many deaths. Was not fun, lol.
---
I would like to see scrip daily totals go up.
---
Do you use legendary damage perk? For 40% damage sneaked?
---
No no, he’s not. My friend played a full health sniper. Viability = 0. He switched to Bloodied commando and even that isn’t viable for the resilient bullshit we have here.
---
I agree with you, yet not in this case here.
---
What beth did was bait &amp; switch. First they let bloody/uny get out of hand and now they've gone and nerfed it, to a point where some builds are no longer viable in solo-play.
---
Right now they are forcing team-mode, and do it again only half-assed. 
---
I like the nerf, even though I got nerfed about 80%, but I really hate the forced-teams w/o a chat. The built-in pigshite of a voice-chat does not cut it, especially when you can not select a different audio device for output. It's 2020 for crying out. Shit, even in the 90ties we could already choose a different device for voice.
---
It's vastly improved
---
I understand that. And would really like it if there was was a real faction opposition in the game. But there must be something about rewards distribution, so important rewards must have a neutral distributor and faction faction rewards must be tradable. So everyone could join the side they like and smash those they don't like.
---
That would also be great like a limit of 200 scrip so you can scrap 5 3star weapons
---
see you've got the right idea. The people praising only a few new additions and not seeing the other debilitating ones are in for a wake up call.
---
It's ok...we actually have another 999 working osmosis kits. 
---
It was just the principal...
---
Why is it always the left arm lmao, mine does the same shit.
---
Am I going crazy or has the camera distance in 3rd person changed? My guy is now smaller than I'm used to no matter what distance my camera is.
---
Anyone else been inside vault 94? It’s currently open
---
Well, I'm still a couple of thousand bullions short of a full set of plans, but I could basically buy leg or arm plans with both mods right now. Maybe start with ultra-light mods for weight reduction and AP and try to get decent legendaries?
---
Scrap your perk-cards you don't need, that'll give you 2 coins each.
---
Within ten minutes they ended up in my lucky bush with me but then I felt bad when the level 1 revived me so I tagged along with just my fists for a while.  Need to start remembering to turn it off again.  It took almost 10 minutes to find a match though.
---
Should come out with 400+ coins. My level 288 melee character had 430 something I believe after I scrapped all my duplicates and unwanted perks. Guesstimates
---
Good for you. Still have 12 hours to go. Had to stop the download because of home office video conference. Maybe I can play tomorrow.
---
Start with the basics. Make some crafting benches and a place to sleep. The rest will come to you over a few months piece by piece.
---
What happens if you unequip a ranked up card? You dont lose the rank ups I hope
---
At level 50 or less, there is no escape. The woods hold no refuge. All you can do is hope you have enough sneak to try to ninja loot enough floor junk to repair your gear, and build some ammo.
---
A humiliating insult to people who had already stopped picking up trash cause their stash was full up already. If you want me to feel bad all day while I do nothing but pick up recycling, let me at least do it in the real world where it will make some kind of difference.
---
Yes :)
---
No but in all seriousness ,I'm a lower level player so I have a lot of other stuff to do.
---
For veterans ,well ,I wouldn't know.
---
Yeah, i cant respec my character anymore lol
---
Yeah a group with bloodied unarmed is definitely the best way to beat the current daily op. Me an my buddy beat it under 10mins after we got used to it and learned the locations. Switched to public server and got a guy using the new unarmed "gauntlet" so it was 2 dcg and a gauntlet an we beat the daily in 7:32min.
---
Basically requiring players to get the legendary ammo factory perk to keep up in bullets because now the original ammo perk isn't going to be enough is going to do more harm than good. Who is bethesda listening to when they release these updates? Seriously theres alot wrong here.
---
Did they patch the ammo factory blueprint glitch or something?
---
Well that's what a good company would do, this however is beth
---
&gt;  But now what was a spawn point for level 6 wolves now spawns level 50 sh-t. 
---
I'm seriously considering moving my camp for the same reason: the L21 Deathclaw and L5 Scorched/Mole Miners are now all L50 and my turrets can no longer keep my CAMP intact long enough for me to go off and complete a mission.
---
thanks for posting this.  Good to know
---
They do seem to be a good long term investment as of right now.  While a good portion of the other perks are more situational, you can always use more special stats and perk points in your build.
---
It doesn't go past 8 sets for a total of 16 str for me. Even then, each set has its own 30 min timer. So it may say +16 str 30 min what it means is, the last set I did has 30 mins left, the first has maybe 27. Still pretty awesome.
---
This. The level scaling is great. Nerfing all the weapons horizontally so only 2 or 3 high end builds turn out to be viable is horrible. I can't understand how they didn't think about buffing the base damage of at least the worst performing weapons.
---
All the Americans are asleep, glad u got a taste of camaraderie though
---
Smells like bitch in here.
---
No idea. But with everything that needs tweaking and fixing, if they prioritized this change it must have been causing issues.
---
OR just make it a fucking option, do you want to play with level scaling or not. Of course bethesda doesn't know shit about decent game design though.
---
You get the number of perk slots depending on your level, up to a maximum of 6 at level 300
---
Match I joined only had 28. I took second hanging out in a bush
---
Wait until the next day when the OP changes. It’s a “daily op”
---
I've been playing the same as before the change and hardly noticing a difference. Stop being a fucking drama queen.
---
There wasn't
---
Supposed to be fixed in patch 22.
---
I'm liking most of it.
---
I'm not liking lv60 Ticks eating my camp and taking 4 swings from a ski sword to kill.
---
Yup, fractured steel is the next season where “the brotherhood of steel return to Appalachia”
---
[Roadmap](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/6uGykyguCRz6hvvNUhZ5f0/61fd56348e4350f5ca4eb3106752fd13/F76_2020_Roadmap_FULL-SIZE.png)
---
I'm a 44 too and just dropped the entire robot horde at the drill 6 or 7 with my fixer and I didn't go through ridiculous amounts of ammo. Same with spawn hordes at my camp my costume combat shot was flaming them in 3 shots. Like 4 level 44 ghouls. So far I'm not seeing a real problem with it. It's seemingly different between every player.
---
THIS
---
It was fixed, listed in patch notes
---
But 99% of this sub will tell you to research into all the many builds and level up  and spend your every waking second thinking about this game and literally nothing else (just like them)
---
yes thats because your build sucked in the first place. And thats not a drama queen post, it's about tactical adjustments to the nerf for players who know how this game is played.
---
Wow, you're right! I'll edit that now...
---
No you're not the only one, then again thanks god Reddit isn't that a mere 1% of the whole game population. Nor is the first FO76 community out there.  
---
With my clan we enjoyed every single bit of the update, the Daily Ops are great and now big fights needs a bit of thinking and strategy. I don't feel anymore a warmachine that one shots everything, in some situations yesterday i had some genuine impression that i was not gonna make it, and it happened alot.  
---
So yeah, it's great. The Wasteland is supposed to be an harsh place of death and sorrow, and now it gives me these vibes.
---
Why couldn't you have both perks on before?
---
I did not change anything tbh , just added some legendary perks. Switched to Junkie from Bloodied 2 months ago , wont go back , I still runt 4 unyielding cause its a ap refresh set so i will never get a better anyway + the added ap points is nice if i take a beating cause i mostly use vats (bad at aiming in this game lol) 
---
Still not had any troubles but yet to try SBQ or Earle after the patch.
---
Currently using a J2525 Fixer and JE25 Fixer + AA2525 Fixer as main weapons
---
I had an instigating cheap+accurate vats pistol I named The Fly Swatter that was for this
---
Now the flies swat back
---
this happened to us yesterday as well, just gave up middle because it was impossible for our stealth based builds....
---
Intsigating Gauss is the only semi-auto stealth weapon that feels decent now, bolt action/drawstring weapons are non-players at this point.  This patch eliminated all single shot sniper stealth weapons except the most powerful.  As someone who avoids bloodied and junkies, doesn't do the food stuff, and doesn't use enhancement drugs, this nerf destroyed 2/3 of my builds.  I'm having success with freakish combo experiments as of now from PTS experiences.  My stealth heavy gunner (sounds nuts w/no suppresor.. but not bad) is hella fun to play, but I keep killing myself from my own weapons splash damage in close spaces.  Just a gameplay adjustment issue.
---
Edit:
---
Here's what prepared me for the patch. This was the test run of my stealth sniper with  a VATS instigating crossbow in patch 22. Not very fun or economical.  This is NOT an OP weapon, but was very viable and SUPER stealthy: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q\_rKOuy9R98](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_rKOuy9R98)
---
not great. The legendary perks and free fast travel points and even level scaling aren't the problems though, its the ways they were implemented
---
But you’ll also level quicker getting 70xp not 2xp for even liberators.
---
Just ran the aueen with a small group of randos and we took her down in the same average time I've seen for the last 2 years, stop crying, this update is fantastic, small enemies are finally slightly more challenging, and the big stuff is about the same, and im seeing fuller servers, you crybabies are definitely in the minority compared to the full player base.
---
even their fucking ToS is buggy. lmao
---
They will stand on the edge of your lawn just far enough away that the turrets don't aggro and shoot up your base.
---
I’ve never used perk load out but is it worth it? Can you play NW with it?
---
I didn't know what was going on so I ended up soloing today's OP. I did finish it, but wtf that was rough.
---
Thanks for giving him a real answer. OP you just have some sort of UI bug going on. They updated the Code of Conduct a couple weeks ago, might just be a glitch with the new update interacting with that since you didn't logon when it was originally updated. If relogging doesn't work I just recommend you Google it and also report it as a bug.
---
Someone who actually uses grenade launchers?
---
Hey are you on pc I need somewhere to dump all these grenade rounds I keep accidentally acquiring
---
It’s not scrap though... if anything it would need to be scrapped down to acid and cloth
---
get used to dissapointment.
---
Miss adventure has once again stolen defeat from the jaws of victory...
---
I was motor boated to death by a flock of bloat flies last night. 😂
---
We had the same issue and left after 45 min fighting off hordes of robots. It didn't complete but we had great fun with the event. I went in with 2k rounds of 5mm and left with 11k. V/E/90 Gat Gun goes bambambam
---
According to Bethesda, yes. We don’t know when though.
---
Well technically it’s a bat. But no, I see your point. Nobody else does though.
---
My wife has a Disney theme going
---
Um....
---
If it's as bad as I'm reading I will cancel mine and play NV or Res3 until they make it right.
---
No. Only 80
---
He was imprisoned there by The Man. We must free him.
---
Damage has been recalculated across the board as part of this patch.
---
Lvl 72, robots take like million shots with a shotgun now. Hate it.
---
How is the greenhouse set? Did I see roof pieces in there as well?
---
Thanks, I preferred to know beforehand because I might need to hold back on doing events so complete a weekly by the weekend or sacrifice dailies to not finish the weekly early.
---
But if it isn't doubled then I just waste score that week. I would prefer it of it was almost every week because I'm heading back to uni on Monday and will have a lot less time during the week anyway. Doubling all at can on the weekends would be my best hope
---
Bloodied is still op anyways, the only enemy I've found that is a bitch to fight is regular scorchbeasts as they are all level 75 for me now and refuse to f**king land
---
It is not a story a Zenimax would tell you...
---
How do you figure it’s elitism I’m a casual player that plays maybe 10 hours a week and I had no issues with the damage curve yes I die more so what. Am I having fun? Yes. Good that’s what a game is supposed to be
---
two shot explosive weapons seem to be doing suspiciously better this patch
---
But neither is stable flux???
---
No. You get coins by scrapping cards. Everyone gets 50 coins when they turn level 50. You get a perk slot every 50 levels.
---
Just wait until you get the battle brew recipe and find you have a sudden need for reliably getting wendy vocal sacks 👀
---
armor is breaking faster
---
Anybody get dungeon door?  
---
Hows it look?
---
It was never mentioned at all. Even on the PTS forums.
---
Facts aren't fanboyism, ya need to learn to tell the difference. At any rate, that's a more reasoned argument (that I disagree with, but to each their own), though you already lost credibility with your earlier reply, so it's too little too late. Just because something fell hard with YOU, doesn't mean it fell hard overall. Again, ya gotta tell the difference between facts and your opinion.
---
Same.  At lvl 202, reallocating 10-20 points in build that will get weaker as I change it.... ugh.  I got about 8 levels banked.  May just stack up/grind out levels to do it all at once.  I swear I'm missing most V.A.T.S. shots, bloodued Gauss Rifle &amp; Power fist.  Idk anymore.
---
Tame the mole rat 😆 new pet until it gets killed also.
---
My problem is that i'm only level 74, so i don't have that many cards to swap with yet :p
---
Launched 3 nukes and crashed on every single one
---
yup
---
Yeah, but it shows a warning. But it's easy to accept past the warning and destroy important items
---
I suspect that after maybe a week or so that people will figure out the new intricacies of the damage changes and that things will normalize again. 
---
But will still become an issue of whether those players who carry the server decide to opt in. 
---
I think something is up too with the perk cards needing to be refreshed in peoples lists.
---
I recall earlier today getting wrecked over and over again as enemies turned around to 1 shot me and all of my defensive and stealth perks failed  to kick in at all. But after moving things back and forth trying to optimize my approach that eventually I felt back to my old self.
---
Minus having to abandon my favorite 1 handed wrapon.
---
You are correct, there is a roof piece that works on any structure. I've done turned my back room into a sun room with a glass ceiling. This greenhouse set is looking like a slam dunk. Review coming soon👍🏼
---
Level 30 on a second character. Deleted my level 50something shortly after launch.... came back with wastelanders... not hardcore or optimized, but have been having a lot of fun.
---
Tonight I logged on, and hung out in my camp... perused the score board (disappointing)... built some things... 
---
During this time my camp was attacked by a pack of mongrels 3 different times...
---
Using my only good weapon, a 2 star, modded handmade....
---
I burned 200 bullets. In camp. In a hour or so.
---
Made ammo, found an event, died twice, out of ammo again, logged out. 
---
Does not bode well.
---
Was probably swapping out starched genes to put on super duper.
---
I always swapped my better criticals for it because it was my only rank 3 luck card...
---
And I would always forget to swap back when done crafting.
---
I agree to a point. Damage adjustment was definitely needed and now opens the door for real balancing. I’m not a huge fan of level scaling as it seems to take away any incentive to really level up. Sure, legendary perks are now a thing, but that doesn’t really make up for the feeling of a lack of progression IMO
---
Most people when they play a game they just tend to focus on the bad and what can't be done instead of appreciating the good things and when 76 came out last year everybody hated it for its glitches but when I played it I found the glitches to be not that bad and I found the gameplay to be phenomenal I really enjoyed every single moment of plate 76 and I personally think that any person who berated or hate this game really doesn't play games right because you play a game to be must you don't play a game for perfection and I've played every single Fallout that there is even New Vegas and even New Vegas has its glitches and it's little bugs even Fallout 4 has its glitches in its bugs but that doesn't stop it from being a fantastic game Bethesda is a hard-working company that works hard in an extremely competitive environment and they pull off what they do giving the game is a fantastic role-playing experience it might not be the best game out there but it sure as hell wasn't fantastic experience and it's just one of the reasons why I am in love with what Bethesda makes and I appreciate the game some people in life just turn down things because it's bad when you can just actually try to see the good in things and enjoy it
---
Lol be ready to fight level 15 hordes every time you fresh spawn in or fast travel home.
---
Guess I can take those osmosis kits out of my vendor now.
---
that's a No for Nw...
---
I had a collection of bloodied swing speed knives that could one-shot super mutants. I loved those weapons😢
---
...
---
...can I borrow the car?
---
That’s awesome, so stoked. Being able to watch a nuke or a radstorm...I’m a start stocking up on glass shards now
---
I'm just hoping they dont turn around and nerf the SPECIAL legendaries into +1/2/3 per level; because as it is, these are a godsend for being able to run a scavenging run without completely gutting my fighting capability
---
Which is important now that even ghouls in Morgantown will try to eat my ass
---
I didn't use knives but I had a junkies explosive pipe rifle. Figured I'd use 38 instead of ultracite 45. Goodbye pipe rifle.
---
I just spent about an hour getting enough legendary perk points to max level all of my cards, I had 300+ available perk cards.
---
So time consuming though
---
You can't use stealth in daily Ops. Due to a mutation enemies have, Piercing Gaze.
---
Riip man, same thing with my friend, he was a pure bloodied build
---
The few quiet spaces with no spawns just became prime real estate. Now molerats can eat your whole bunker in a moment, even if its the vintage one made of asbestos. Walk over to tend the garden and your house is gone.
---
I can see where you are coming from this game does need more in the way of progression and the level scaling I enjoy it to an certain degree to me it should have been each zone had a cap of level.
---
Beta character too. Didn't find out about Super Duper for awhile
---
Yeah honestly the possibilities are endless with this greenhouse set!
---
All “uplink” ops have the piercing gaze which means you cannot sneak
---
I'm curious as well. I took a break from this game because of the issues I had with it. Not going to get into discussion about how Bethesda handled FO76 but I am dipping back in to see how much has it changed. Since I missed out on last season to unlock the ammo converter I wonder if it still possible to unlock it?
---
Yeah I always swap better criticals as well 👌 does the extra +1 stat in legendary perks stack with current stats? Like can I go over 15 in luck for example?
---
Double score is normally just for daily challenges. That being said I've no idea if they intend to change that.
---
initiate dodge wants us to fix relays for him so he can reconnoiter "hot spots" of enemy activity. so he can presumably give that info to the incoming brotherhood detachment. 
---
future ops will probably have a different mission structure, like elimination, asset acquisition or horde defense.
---
This will mostly solve itself as people play them more. Text chat would still be good, but it's the first day, there's always going to growing pains with new stuff.
---
I'm gonna refund that freaking theremin if they actually did this. That was in no way a necessary change and not at all what we bought youre right!
---
i dont think so you can only swap to commando for some time and pray to god they will buff riffles

Yeh..so the "piercing gaze" mutation basically disables stealth by giving the enemies enhanced perception.  And while the other modifier [e.g. today we had "resilience," aka: must kill with melee] will be random,  my understanding is that piercing gaze is fixed.  So yes, myself included, we stealth builds will need to bring additional tactics to this dance.
---
Womp womp.
---
🤬
---
Speer I should be clear, I don’t think weeklies will be doubled.
---
I gotta say chief, if you’re not noticing a difference then your build wasn’t optimal. Bethesda have nerfed the living shit out of all damage so you’re either lying or didn’t have an optimised build.
---
The guy who tells you about them literally says "we are doing this to prep for the brotherhood's return"
---
Did you fall asleep during his conversation?
---
Apparently "piercing gaze" will be a mutation in every single ops. Unfortunate for me as I too am a stealth build
---
Just wanna throw it out there that the people who *actually make the game* and the people who make decisions like "I don't care if there's major balancing issues it needs to be out by Tuesday!" are not the same people.
---
Chances are people did see things and want to listen but had to deal with shitty bosses and the many ways working in the games industry is busted. It's not that youre being ignored it's that my bruh capitalism sucks ass
---
Soo no in game reason then
---
Exactly the same as I play before the update, except in daily Ops. I use my full heath build.
---
You can't go over 15 unfortunately :/
---
I never tried this hard at 20.
---
If you're on PS4 I have a level 25 vampires swing speed fire axe that I got with my low level. You can have it if you want.
---
Oh man, I just realized how hard some of these quests are gonna be if no one else shows. I used to love doing Distinguished Guests by myself, but the enemy spawns can get super annoying. They were gnats before though. Now I'll just die and fail lol :( Wish they would have fixed more of the enemy glitches before doing this. 
---
Guess it's back to farming tp make chems while listening to audiobooks for me.
---
Edit: a freaking bee swarm...2 shots. That's just dumb.
---
I'm gonna do it for both the bunker and theremin. Op has a point and none of the issues this update has caused should go unheeded.
---
Well if you could break that down it would spoil
---
We still cant use more than 15 points in cards even with legendary points right?
---
I have 11 in agility and would need over 15 to get all cards I want.
---
Go to watoga, it is explained
---
Stable flux is scrap?
---
I went in with full Unyielding armor and decided to use the unstoppable monster (bloodied Deathclaw gauntlet with increased heavy attack damage) and got fucking thrashed. Not to mention sneaking does absolutely nothing since it's nerfed, I couldn't even sneak up on the dumbass robots. If this effect pops up I'll be skipping daily ops for the day for sure.
---
Shits and giggles.
---
Quad tactical with +50 limb dmg onboard here.. It's only level 40 but it still shreds most stuff. I've got a magic bloodied gauss shotgun as well but I don't use it as much..:P
---
Sadly it's always that way.
---
They want everyone in power armor, spamming stim packs in order to create a value for them in the economy.
---
It's seriously depressing that they open Daily Ops with this mutation. I haven't played in months and I come back with my Heavy Guns locked and loaded and I have to... melee the enemy swarms with either gun bash or bringing a power fist to the mission. I hate using melee (especially with some hits not registering), I just want to shoot my guns.
---
There is no rush! Everybody is racing to complete content but this is Endgame content. You will get there with a bit of patience. I had to spend a bunch of banked levels to pick up some new cards so even I wasn't optimized for Daily Ops. Finding a good team to run it with helps too. I ran yesterday in a group of 4 sneak commandos using melee weapons. It was a lot of fun
---
Not actually sure, I think it is. The enemies normally have 2 mutations, Piercing Gaze seems to be a default, then the other random. Changing each day.
---
I think at the end of the last one the weeklies were doubled too, I was getting 2000 and 3000 for some of them. If they aren't doubled this time then I won't worry about it as much
---
You mean guy from atlas that disappeared again? Or that random messages during daily ops
---
I'm level 300 and 210 and couldn't make it through the whitesprings golf club without dying last night. So it's not just lower levels.
---
Same actually.
---
 I had around 500 perk coins to play with after scrapping extra cards and using a few perk points I had stockpiled.
---
And I still have 100 perk points saved...not too shabby
---
No, not really.
---
The last time I was there I was given a blue screen just before I could reach the dropped legendary. 
---
Nothing for me except a lab coat?
---
I wish my bloodied gauss shotgun would 1 shot enemies. Has a magic effect too far as I can tell.
---
Feels like the bullets are purposely curving around the enemies most times out of spite.
---
Exiting and reentering VATs fails to fix it 4 out of 5 times.
---
Nice! We did 2 runs in a team of 4 last night. First time was 7.46 (we had a PTS player with us) and another run later with a slightly more intelligent approach and got 6.27. All in all the new ops are a lot of fun
---
specific location? Or in wotoga I will get radio massage?
---
I just passed out trying to read your post aloud.
---
I noticed that my stealth shotgun build now takes an extra shell.  Before it was one shot and they are dead, now it's one shot and health regenerates somewhat to where a second shot is needed. Tested this at West Tek and Huntersville. It seemed like the game forced health regeneration after the first shot. Trying out my alt level 5 tonight to see if stuff scales to level. I figured it would be a shit show at first. Just waiting for an enemy to explode (bloody mess) only to have health regeneration after. Definitely record that
---
So he didn't really say anything special about being bruted into it, the intelligence option sounds cooler. But goddamn he's not so bad after all, poor dude.
---
about tree fiddy.
---
It's because it's low level people don't have the ammo to deal with the enemies that should be their level. Not overleveled enemies. But what was trash mobs to them before is now taking several more shots to down, and they are getting drained of ammo because it's like this every where. A harder challenge is fine, but it's been tuned too much into one direction that it's forcing people into melee builds.
---
I agree wholeheartedly.
---
I had 2 in 35 min
---
Play the same as before and this nerf is NOT a problem. Lvl 578 bloodied commando/bloodied heavy (with legendary perks). It takes a few more shoots than before but nothing really important. I don't even understand why there are so much crying about the nerf. Bloodied is fine...
---
Ok, I'd finished the run by that point. I personally don't see them doing weekly double score until the last week or so again. I hope I'm wrong.
---
Go to watoga and a new quest will appear.
---
You can always access unpowered vendors, just not see them on the map
---
Thanks for info 👍 yeah I figured I read it correctly just wasn't sure 😁
---
I think theres something going on where we need to unequip out perks and  reset them otherwise their just not procing at all making us feel far weaker than we really are.
---
Who wanted one wasteland? I don't recall complaining about being too high level for the starting zones. I'm fine with the way it was before.
---
You’re completely right. I used to go to high level areas and use all my ammo and just get through it. It was cool going somewhere new. Then afterwards I’d return to a low level area, do stuff there, and melee then whole time, collecting my ammo back up again.
---
Now I’m constantly out of ammo with no where to re stock it back up.
---
I really don't think people want to waste time and caps to get whole sets of armor just for a daily ops mission.
---
Don't bother the lowbies with their max charisma builds and no damage perks are just confused that they actually have to know how to play the game now. At least we won't see these shits at ACP anymore.
---
I could be wrong, but im pretty sure people confused a skin for the power armor station for an actual display.
---
Read the instructions and it tells you why stealth doesn't work.
---
To be honest I did not really feel that big of a difference, tried a group queen aswell and it went down really quick, will keep using bloodied, I love the thrill of being at low health, will probably get the strength legendary perk for bandolier and pop my PA for solo op, the resilience buff is a pain in the ass, loss of stealth is fine just for those missions, but having to bash in the middle of 3/4 gutsies, argh.
---
maybe if more people speak up they'll actually notice how game breaking it is. Stupid that thats what it takes but this is what will make me stop playing because now more than ever I'm dying left and right
---
I disagree, I definitely think mobs doing now damage and taking more hits is challenging and is how it should be, but that's my opinion. If it isn't a radroach or something like that, you should have to put in effort to kill it instead of just 2 or 3 shots doing the job. I'm very happy I don't just blast everything out of existence fast as hell and they actually take some shots now.
---
Some people just don't get it lol
---
Why would i lie?? I'm a heavy gunner build i lost like 3-6pts off of my main guns, its literally nothing.
---
Yeah, my pure bloodied build is done for. I have 30 perk spec points saved but i want to use that for the legendary points.. God this system is stupid
---
I’m freaking loving it...not sitting back with my feet up on the Ottoman anymore.
---
Haha, ngl though I'm dreading the freeze every shot and invisible robots.
---
I love how they  added new ranks for higher level enemies, like the skullbreaker mole miner, but didnt do anything to radroaches.
---
It should be named like: XxXPussYDestroYARXXx radroach
---
I have a green hood for free  but I'm on ps4
---
Not soon enough.!
---
Akright thanks for the heads up there, Sounds like you had a bad day lol.
---
Not sure why you’re getting downvoted, I agree with you
---
Sad times
---
Someone remind me what magic effects shotguns have
---
I know blocker armor is what's giving me vats buff but not sure what traits on shotguns I should look for, or if other armor traits are important or if blocker stacks at all
---
How the hell is what he just told you not an in game reason??
---
Thank you. all these posts are the ones who see the real issues looming on the horizon. Whoever is saying they're enjoying the new challenge and are grateful for the new legendary perks and daily ops haavent quite taken off their rose colored glasses. Once the allure wears off they are in for a surprise.
---
My Furious Handmade still burns through enemies. It doesn't feel like I'm taking more rounds to kill something than before the patch.
---
Yes low health is still mandatory for me, I will use it as long unyielding isnt nerfed, but I'm thinking about which kind of weapon to use with it.
---
Your build is now putting out a reasonable amount of damage, in comparison to other builds, bloodied was always putting out more damage than intended. You'll now have to play a strategic game rather than walking in, one shotting everything, collecting the rewards. Like the rest of the players have been doing.  I'm sorry you feel that hard done by and quitting after 15 minutes play. Maybe you should just uninstall FO76  so it doesn't ruin your gaming enjoyment.
---
Me? I fucking love the changes, the new Legendary perks have increased the enjoyment I get from the game tenfold. Random exploding enemies, getting my power armor charged by enemy laser fire, running through Blackwater mine to get my daily 1400 caps used to be something to get out of the way first thing, now I have level 75 Mole miners to deal with, it's fun. Running through the golf clubhouse has random level 100 ghouls, hell, the random eyebot event where it's playing a tune and followed by radrats made me laugh so hard when the first rat I shot exploded and sent the others in different directions, can't wait to see this happen in Colossal Problem.
---
Same game, different attitude.
---
I used the armor bench that’s outside of that metal shed by V9 couple of hours ago
---
This update is the fallout 76 equivalent of the Star Wars Galaxies 'Combat upgrade' patch. Good effort Bethesda but I think you should have focused on this earlier in this live Beta.
---
Not sure how anyone is still playing.
---
I'm new what is the Bug ?
---
I just shredded the health bars with my gun and then smacked em in the face with the stock lol didn't make much of a difference. It seems like they are just randomized extra rules to make you think about your approach to the challenge. I didn't mind it.
---
Nice thanks.
---
I tried. But on my pc it only shows a warning when i try dropping unfavorited items with an atomshop skin or gold buillion items. If i click drop on items i have equipped or favorited it does nothing.
---
Sneak would just botch our times anyway moving so slow.
---
I know right? Who would've guessed it!? But seriously though, we now have guys actually spec'ing into specific roles in our groups and it is really paying off. Power armor users stepping up to provide cover to our less armored allies, drawing fire. The less armored allies running high sprint speed, that one moving target one that dodges bullets, etc, smacking enemies with quick melees. It works so well.
---
No problems homie. Glad it helped
---
Tried it and my hits never registered. Died 5 times then said to hell with the 250 score.
---
this is the most likely answer but unfortunately, bethesda has a tendency to do stealth patches or not list the full changeling with big updates, which tend to fuck stuff up
---
I'm really hoping we can expand the interiors when inside, like a hammerspace. It's because I want to make what looks like a tunnel entrance and just have this crazy ammo depot/bunker base.
---
Oh man, no wonder none of the bugs get fixed, I bet their entire code looks like this
---
Tested some, be laser is still op imo, my b2525 handmade felt still very fine, the one that lost some was my be fixer and the bss super sledge
---
B gauss shotgun still one taps everything and I truly agree, if they don't touch the unyielding effect all is fine
---
What fundamental difference is there between gunpowder and junk; Why isn't gunpowder just a type of junk instead of being Misc despite it being a standard crafting material like every piece of junk is
---
If it were junk I'd be able to stop having to worry about that sneaky Misc weight too
---
There were no changes to the nuke materials drop chances, so for every HRF, you'd still get 1.5 GM and 1.5 HM on average.
---
Did it today as bloodied without power armor, used alot of stim packs and had to be picked up a couple of times but is doable. 
---
My lvl 20 newbie friend went in with power armor tho and survived quite well. Prevented us from having to restart the final boss. XD
---
My weapon damage dropped from 168 to 137 last night, this isn’t a legendary weapon either, just a basic fixer
---
I’m seriously gutted. This means having to fire more rounds and a faster weapon degrade.
---
There are PSA posts warning of this. It may be a bug but its doubtful it never worked on the PTS for sharing and as post below says Bethesda Never acknowledged it.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/isn5xq/psa_legendary_charisma_does_not_allow_you_to/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Maybe write to support and say its a bug maybe of they get enough of those or enough suggestions they may change it.
---
What is the theoretical charge you can make on a player crafted fusion core
---
it is based on your intelligence at the time of crafting right?
---
I like roleplaying and playing around really casually, so I never worried about optimizing my high level character, I don't have a great gun or a great build, but I still had fun. Now if feels like a serious, ammo draining chore to do even the easiest dailies.  
---
I had also started a bow using alt character just because I thought bows were fun, but that character is unplayable now. ):
---
Man! Meet Week + Primal Cut events is gonna be brutal, because of this Update. Heck! Even future holiday events &amp; Faschnat will be brutal
---
Exactly. Its a rough place, a literal wasteland. You shouldn't be able to just one shot enemies really ever in my opinion. People got too comfortable when they got an overpowered build and now that the challenge is coming back they don't know how to deal with it.
---
I have a [Bloodied Commando, Bloodied Rifleman](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=6d643f9&amp;d=pg2ph2pi2p00pp2a72am2a31eh2ce0c62ir2ic4sf2s01sg2sb2lu2l71lt2l11la2l20eo2x03xb3xa3x73x83a04au1&amp;w=cu2s72an2ar2ao0&amp;m=05c29fe8b&amp;am=13-18-18-18-18&amp;n=Bloodied%20Commando%203*) (which are essentially the same build) and a [Full Health Commando](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=8c256e9&amp;d=p00pp1a72am2a32lu2lt2l71l12s01ic1sf2pg2ph2pi2s61c62ce0sg2lg2ee2eo2sb2a04xb3x03xa3x63x83cr0ib3&amp;w=p72p10pe2ii0ij2if2iq2lm2i92c31c52ik0sa2sv3s72ag2ej3&amp;m=05c9fe8b3&amp;am=10-1620-16-1720-17&amp;n=Full%20Health%20Commando%203*). These links are for target state, based on figuring out what works for me. I don't have enough to level up all the Lego perks and my main is lvl252 so only have 5 slots.
---
I'm planning on changing my Bloodied Rifleman build to a PA Heavy since I picked up some good Heavies in the sale. Can't decide on Bloodied PA or not though.
---
I'm also moving away from stealth as it doesn't work in Daily Ops - so figured I might as well get used to that full time.
---
I run variations of Fixer and Handmade/Assault on all (no god rolls though). My full health also has a TSE Combat Rifle, while my rifleman also has a Quad Lever (which still melted a lvl100 3\* Super Mutant last night - no reload and killed before health regen kicked in).
---
All seemed to still be effective last night, even without reaching my target builds, but I haven't done a Daily Op yet.
---
Oh no, you can’t oneshot nearly every single encounter in the game anymore?
---
Not a bug, by design.
---
Was asked and answered many times last night
---
I am a single shot bloodied stealth and did at least 2500 dmg per shot. Now it says 145
---
The changes didn’t affect my main 340+ much at all but my smaller 2nd and 3rd characters took the hardest hit both are under lvl 60 so I see why a lot of people are angry. My lvl 30 is nothing more than mule for my main. But you can bet hacking cheating and players abusing the shit outta glitches will increase ten fold now lol can’t say I blame them either.
---
No for NW but there are mod managers that can easily switch between allowing mods and playing NW.
---
Aside from that though, very well worth it. Especially if you find yourself switching out picklock and hacking cards a lot while adventuring.
---
he also shouldn't be forced choose perks. A fully optimized player should be allowed to go god mode in the wasteland. A partially optimized one should still be able to survive. Now neither can do that with the new update.
---
I have no idea if it's rare I just want one
---
Just to keep you playing
---
I have been using this mod for over a year.  Have not been banned.  Just have to turn it off for NW.
---
Just want to point this out to you, they do actually have that outfit in the code with the ATX tag on it. You might've seen the tank crew helmet in the scoreboard. The ATX one has it in their actual colors like it is with the board, but also with the suit. I think I also saw some outfits for the minions of the commissar or whatever his name is. So yeah, does seem we will see other stuff.
---
Collect acid and cloth and make as much as you need when you go to make ammo!?
---
Basically all endgame content is a grind. What do you want, a new game experience so start when you’ve finished the game?
---
Well i almost felt the need to uninstall lol, but i will give it a go again and rethink my strategy, i play the game since day one. Honestly i don't even know how to build my character now.
---
2 atoms have been deposited into your account
---
As I've told everyone else with the ammo excuse, ammo factory and the regular ammo perk both make ammo production the easiest thing in the world. Before I could make ammo at a massive rate, I used the conversion machine. These resources are still available to them, and it isn't hard to make ammo even without the perks. If you're too lazy to make your ammo, the only thing "forcing" them into a melee build is themselves.
---
If you already got some legendary modules to craft the armor, sure, why not. You can always upgrade them later to buttressed once you have that plan. 
---
I am not sure what is 'decent' after the upgrade, though... heh. I ran a mix of -15% damage from scorched/mutants/mirelurks/robots/ghouls on my scout sets for a long time with various modifiers like AP refresh and weapon/ammo weight reduction, but your priorities may differ (stealth). Oh, and if you get (even 1star) troubleshooter pieces - keep them for the robot daily ops, makes it so much easier.
---
I completed it in just under 12 minutes with one other person for my first play of it. My partner had done it once earlier so set the plan for us to run through and not kill if we didn't have to. Only killing while waiting for each objective to complete. I wore a full set of troubleshooters armor and my partner had a few pieces. Both junkies but I used a non junkies melee weapon. He just bashed with his gun.
---
Also key for robots is pulse grenades. It shorts them out and takes their health down to the very lowest. 
---
For the boss we both used our heavies. Mine is a junkies explosive LMG. Neither of us died though health went low a few times. You can tank the bots with troubleshooters on. And then just book it to the next objective. We had no problem running past the robots. Though I admit that there are way too many robots at once. Then you start getting lag.
---
At least fast traveling to foundation and crater ar now free
---
when you're fully leveled and at peak optimization on a build, Id wager you should be allowed to do that.
---
I have 3 in my vendor on xbox - 10 caps each I think.  
---
They're one of those items i tend to pick up when I see because I know people will buy them. Kinda makes me feel like I am helping? (That sounds strange even typing it. Oh well, I am weird)
---
Never took off my adamantium skeleton long enough to realize that mutation ever affected broken limbs.
---
Same dude;)
---
Hmmm a box for gunpowder....sounds like Fallout 2nd would be viable here for a small monthly cost of 17.99
---
I wonder how long will take now to kill a  wendigo colossus.
---
BadBoyBrown420. Level 320 and level 225. Playing on xbox in the UK. Always looking for good groups to run with 👍
---
It's r/fo76
---
If I had £1 for every post that WASN'T someone bitching about some element or another, I'd have enough for - maybe - a McDonalds Happy Meal.
---
Lol Right? Bethesda lit the fire under our asses and I'm glad. People got too comfortable one shotting everything and now it's getting rough like the wasteland should be and all of a sudden they can't take the heat
---
Oh nice what your gamertag
---
Lol come on everything ain't need to be 1 shot anyways I'm only 45 and my custom fixer eats robot mobs and mutants and ghouls
---
Yeah. Far from optimal. I lost 80% of my damage.
---
My QE Harpoon still melts everything in front of me, and life is good
---
I missed the first 3 weeks so I took did as much as I could and tried to level up almost every day. If it wasn't for the double weekend I probably wouldn't have finished it
---
You can mod it to use fusion cells.
---
You think it would be included in the description of the legendary perk no?
---
I sent in a support ticket requesting they switch the perk to the luck stat for me.  Hopeing it works out as this is my main and only high level character.  I already lost a ton of points with respecs and such. 
---
Not trying to be a bitch but this one may make me quit and fallout 76 is the only game I play.
---
My AA/40P/90 Tenderizer does the sameXD
---
A few things that changed for me since the patch that I’m not happy about:
---
I used to have several different weapons I could use for different areas of the map, thereby spreading out condition loss and also being able to do things differently. Yesterday I used my two big hitters and that’s it, everything else was too meepy. No more “fun” weapons, goodbye flaming pitchfork, rolling pin and golf club. It was fun while it lasted
---
I used to mess around with any weapons I found that seemed good but weren’t part of my build. I’m specced for melee but if I found a 3* Gatling or lmg etc I’d play with it for a bit before deciding to sell or scrip. I wouldn’t bother swapping perks, just burn off my excess ammo having fun who cares if it’s not doing max possible damage. Now I’ve got ungatz with those weapons, gotta swap back before I die
---
Casual long time players did kinda get screwed and I had a few people on my friends list that were 100+ levels but really never went to the higher leveled areas because they didn’t have the resources or skills but they were still fun friends to play with. I’m betting at least one will stop playing. 
---
RIP my teammate who was doing a no legendary play through. 
---
The good thing I like about the patch, even tho my damage got nerfed hard, is that I have to be tactical again. No more cutting through low level events like butter. I’m still tanky af but there’s now a real danger in trying to solo certain events and that adrenaline rush of being a low level melee build and getting surrounded and having to bust my butt to stay standing is back and I kinda like that. 
---
No more worrying about one shot killing legendaries at events. No more switching to lower weapons, boosting health etc. just swing away! No more oops I didn’t mean to kill that, my bad. 
---
At least for now the novelty of level 100 mobs is kinda cool. I feel a little accomplished for beating them. Like I got skillz or something (trust me I got no skillz)
---
I started a little newbie character just for the seasons to level up and it was fun running around Whitesprings as a level 4. Today I’m taking him to the bog, it’s like a test drive. I can mess around with him anywhere I want. 
---
Unfortunately I think a lot of my casual friends are not going to have a good time. Before you could just avoid high level areas or events, now it’s all of them (near as I can tell). What about the teammate who deliberately specced into crafting so he could mod or build everyone’s equipment? Or the role player who just wanted to run a B&amp;B? Or the one with super bad luck who never has legendaries worth a damn? For me it’s still fun and not hard unless I go looking for trouble and I’ve already been min/maxed since forever. I can see why people would be upset. I don’t have any answers tho. I agree with your points and the tougher enemies have always been bullet sponges now they’re everywhere with no areas for relief. This is definitely going to turn people off especially given that it’s big changes made suddenly. 
---
I know some people just say git gud but believe me, dear sweet teammate “K” isn’t ever gonna git gud and they’ll take their time and whale money elsewhere. 
---
(Sorry for the super long comment)
---
That's not my issue, my issue is that it's unbalanced, the enemy is wayyyyyy too strong while i throw potatoes at them. xD
---
My bloodied knuckles and bowie are now sitting in my stash along with my assaultron blade. Still using my sledge but it's no longer the hand held mini nuke it used to be. Such a piss off. I loved gouging things with my knuckles and bowie.
---
I guess I'll be un-modding my spare Fixer (Hunter's) from .38 now...
---
unfortunately you and the other small handful of people who somehow manage to praise this update are the only ones bethesda with listen to to help reinforce their decision making on this new release. I doubt balancing will actually happen for some time. Since when did fully auto playstyles become the only way to survive?
---
I run a junkie's heavy gunnner PA build. I haven't noticed a significant difference in time to kill and personally I've been enjoying the lvl 50's at events like mama dulce's and the prison now. 
---
Seems right now the biggest balance issue that needs to be addressed is the disparity between the higher and lower rate of fire weapons.
---
Honestly, the nerf wasn’t that bad even. My BFFR plasma flamer takes like, a half second longer to kill stuff. And my BE combat shotty still one hits super mutants with a headshot.
---
Love it😍
---
Thinkin about that person who made their camp up in the sky using the tram lines
---
I bet they're looking down upon us, laughing
---
Gunslinger main here, using this build

AAE25 10mm pistol kills a lvl 100 super mutant with 4 sneak head shots, 3 if i use a crit, 2 if i have adrenaline maxed and use a crit. Not having any issues at all, have made no changes to my play style. Tank killer and fallow through are awesome. Also have zero issues killing shit with my revolvers, although the 10mm is alot easier since you can utilize stealth + fallow throug. Once i max taking one for the team, it should help out the revolvers a bit.
---
 People said handguns and semi autos were dead  on pts.... obviously they dont know what they are talking about/ over exagerated.
---
Yeah it's far from game breaking but it's definitely not a step in the right direction.  Hunting low level liberators with obscure weapon types for the many, many robot kills needed for those challenges suddenly became a massive chore instead of a fun diversion.  It's a bizarre sight seeing hordes of adds at Line In The Sand being level 100 while the monstrous Scorchbeast flying overhead is only 75.  Cleaning out Harper's Ferry went from one of my favorite ways to kill time, to a headache that I won't bother with any more.  I could go on.  Not stopping me playing the game, One Wasteland may have reduced, rather than increased the fun parts of the game, but the daily ops and other things make up for it.
---
I have a level 25 as well as my main And i dont see why people are upset. Enemies can do more than just die for you now. The wasteland isn't meant to be an easy going place where you can easily kill shit and skip through the flowers. Its definitely no excuse to cheat, hack, or abuse bugs lmao hopefully they get a ban if they do. This update makes the game more of an actual challenge and is nothing to cry about like a lot of these people are doing.
---
I accidentally became Meta with this patch.
---
Heavy Power Armor with a TS Gauss Minigun and Instigating Super Sledge. Been using this build for months and now it's better than ever.
---
Yup me and the boys all around 200s with non meta builds had a blast last night. It was the first time since a month into launch that we had to really work together. Good times are here again
---
Yup, and some chameleon + sneak armor. Level 50 liberators see right through.  Was just doing "feed the people".
---
Can't say that I do. I've got a concise build so it's not really hurting me. May not be an A10 anymore, but I'm still shredding like a Huey with a Vulcan mounted. I'm confused by people having problems with this update....what are ya'll using Nocturnal weapons?
---
Stable flux breaks down to pure flux which breaks down to raw. How is that scrap? Its an item you have to construct, much like gun powder.
---
Be me, running around with magic quad db shotgun and instigating gauntlet, looking around like "I was nerfed??"
---
I can only fill my gauss mini gun. All the ammo I can carry
---
thats kind of nice, guess I gotta check some workshops if I don't lose sleep over this new update
---
I was worried that this might happen. I suspect it's in part due to those people who have massively optimised builds (bloodied with god roll weapons and armor) complaining that the game was too easy.
---
Hurrr durrr le bloodied build
---
Sorry to hear you were upset, but allow me to fill you in on the current lore. So Vernon Dodge ([https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vernon\_Dodge](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vernon_Dodge)) whose backstory can be found in the link, was a former BoS initiate back in the day, one of the few last surviving BoS members of the Appalachian chapter who is now found at Watoga Towers. After hearing the now cleared up BoS transmition regarding their return to Appalachia and plan to set up at Atlas, he sets out to help you, the player, prepare the area for their return via the Daily Ops. In the daily ops you are task with establishing radio signal uplinks and clearing locations, in the hops that the Expedition team can use the signal boosters you're establishing once they arrive.
---
But as for when they truly arrive, oh trust me, you will certainly enjoy it.
---
My berserker is going to have to find some armor and a good weapon (though I think she has a Vampires 50 Cal or LMG at the bottom of her stash -- someone gave it to me so I could break my armor but I never bothered to do it). I'll have to make her an alternate build for these ops. Will be easier as she levels up and gets more legendary perk slots. We are now in the post patch 22 era - tweaked build time.
---
I'm at the crossroads just north of Watoga... Hoooo boy
---
Excavator should give you +4 each time instead of +1. 
---
Beyond that, with the right mods you should see a significant increase to carry weight.
---
are they not 100 for 3? I thought I saw that on the pts. 100 per is too much...
---
Yeah I get that but what I'm saying is isn't it just easier if we were aloud to store fully constructed gun powder? All the same, just more convenient.
---
I wonder how nuked whitesprings will be if you want to farm materials by killing bloated glowing ones.
---
Only works when your crouched. Not quite the same. The assaultrons can run and attack when stealth.
---
Probably, i was just excited by this specific feature, I read the notes before hand and wanted to share my excitement, this subs just full of assholes looking to downvote people for actually enjoying things I guess
---
Honestly my weapons might read lower damage scores, but in terms of gameplay they actually have been killing faster.
---
My head canon is that the wasteland is rallying against the 76rs who pushed them to the brink and   now their fighting mad to push us back out.
---
Just in case some of u hadn't yet, try resenting your perks by unequiping them, seems several arent procing at all till you do making them feel far weaker than they should.
---
My high health build with AA and Vampires Weapons is fantastic.
---
With Ammo Factory now, I am swimming in ammo. And I have over 700 Improved Repair kits to burn....
---
Agreed. There are so many design flaws with inventory, menus and camp building UI that needs tidied up IMO
---
"melee is dead for bosses *now*"
---
Yo how many stacks of Strange In Numbers did you need for the jump height to use melee on SBQ 🤔🤔🤔
---
hey look, more endorsement of broken exploit weapons.
---
This info really could have been in the OP somewhere. Just calling it a Perk is a bit confusing.
---
Yeah same here, it’s incredibly disappointing that Bethesda has made them apart of daily and weekly challenges for TLR without even letting everyone try them first.
---
Nah water made you and everything in the world wet since beta without ever being wet itself now its actually wet
---
I think Bethesda are big fans of slowing everything down. Their logic is the longer it takes you to do anything, the more time you'll spend playing, which means the more likely you are to buy something from the shop.
---
It seems to be a fairly common misconception with game developers, but Bethesda seem to be leaning into it more than most recently.
---
I mainline a VE .50 and a TSFFR UltraGat, with a QE90 Flechette Harpoon for giggles. Also run full health, it's been a blast!
---
Bloody Mess is bad enough without adding these to the mix - hard pass on those perks for me.
---
had the opposite intended effect
---
Sorry but I still feel like too little has been done to fix the biggest fuckup in gaming history.
---
Who needs ammo when you have devops, doubled my shell in 5 events... i had 1000 before...
---
As a filthy casual I would say don’t sweat it too much. 
---
It definitely feels like I reverted back 40 levels in that I am back to having to kill things with 5 to 10 shots instead of 1 to 3 shots.
---
However, I don’t think this is going to be such a huge issue once I have reacclimated to the new normal.
---
Do you legendary perks help as well. I don’t even think the legendary perk cards are that great, but The ones that allow you to add extra points to strength, charisma, etc. are very useful, because now I actually have the room to run some damage buff cards for my weapons that I didn’t really have room for before.
---
I highly suggest getting the perk for automatically opening locks and terminals, because that alone ranked up opens three perk points in perception.
---
I have my camp in the ash hip, nearest spawn point for super mutants and cave crickets and mole miners, and I have not seen a large uptick in camp damage, but to be fair it has only been one day.
---
I don't see time just playing the game as earned or effort, sorry.
---
Agreed. Take my upvote. It's a post apocalyptic wasteland, it's not supposed to be easy.
---
Again, these are *new* players. Level 1, level 20. They do not have as many resources or understand the game as well as others. They do not have the ability to upkeep their ammo depletion. This was supposed to open up the world to them for exploration, but now trash mobs are taking *more than double the amount of ammo it took before* to kill them, in areas that were once safe to them. This isn't just "things are harder now" this is an over tuning that is resulting in the opposite effect that this "One Wasteland" patch intended.
---
I mean considering that it’s literally the exact same model as the power armor **display** from FO4, it’s hard to *not* assume its supposed to be a display.
---
they tried "fixing" it. The floor made sense, so things won't hover anymore. But seriously? The walls did not have to be made hexagonal. They were actually fine and not at all hard to work with.
---
I'm a full health junkie's heavy gunner and haven't noticed a significant difference in time to kill honestly.
---
Haven't tried out SBQ or Earle yet tho.
---
Now that's fancy
---
the process is
---
tag-wait to land-bonk on head.
---
no jump
---
Fixed. I upgraded mine last night.
---
And bought Ultralight limb mods too.
---
I'm a heavy gunner and Beckett gave me an instigating FFR less vats cost Gatling, tried it out to compare it to my standard junkies and was horrified when I saw it sneak attack a full health Ghoul and only do 1/3 the health bar. My junkies mini on the other hand, while being a bear to feed, has the ROF to just mow shit down still
---
My friends that I've been playing with for most of the last year hardly ever actually team up any more.  We have a party chat going but we're all usually on different public teams, in different worlds, working on our own individual goals for the night. Kind of the best of both worlds.
---
One hell of a long and bad time
---
Not
---
agreed it does get buggy:P
---
As they've said in the patch notes, all the up link daily ops have the piercing gaze mutation which kills stealth. The fact is that this is a good thing since the point of up link is to just sit in the area for a bar to fill, while enemies are rushing you. Now imagine that scenario with maxed stealth. You wouldn't even need to fire your weapon for most of the op otherwise.
---
How much did it cost atoms wise? Or did you pay with integrity?  XD
---
1
---
Yep, end of the day and I can confirm it’s not my imagination, I repaired about 6 times in one play session, which is crazy to me since I have only had to repair once every couple of play sessions before, rip my precious ballistic fiber 😑
---
Weight bench is +2 strength, not stamina.
---
When I first traveled  near Watoga,After the patch, I got a mission to investigate a note at the outskirts of Watoga.
---
I guess they need to sell those repair kits somehow
---
You are correct, thank you for pointing it out. Correcting typo now👍🏼
---
Don't let the door hit you on the way out, adapt and change or just uninstall. Bloodied damage gets regulated to normal parameters and y'all just complain on reddit about it. I see no problems between my 3 characters.
---
I was curious to see how far it would go +70 strength is all I could gain since I have all unyeilding SS armor so 100 strength is the max it only took 40 minutes not long at all. What sucks is it resets when you leave the server instead of just staying active until the 30 minutes is up like food or chem buffs.
---
I just want the game to  be piss easy so I can one shot everything with my weight reduction build 😭😢 
---
/s
---
Add the Assualton Head and Harpoon Gun to the list. They list as displayed but model doesn't show.
---
Taking everything off display and closing store until we know more.
---
As a full health heavy gunner junkies build, im having a blast, just ran the queen twice with a few lower randos an we wrecked her, it was super fun, im seeing a minimal drop in damage like maybe 6 points across the board, but im having more fun, need more stims since earle wiped me out though.
---
I always forget to put it on
---
I still have a vampire's revoutionary sword (lvl 40) that got me to level 100 on my first character a couple of years ago.  I have snapshots of me with with my sword and my newly purchased bone raider excavator armor over a pile of ghouls at Whitespring.  This thing is garbage now. But will be hung in honor once I delete something from my CAMP.
---
Oh, we can't have text chat because "it would be hard to moderate" or whatever, but I can walk into someone's camp and see that they've written "peepee poopoo" on the wall and that's fine. Smdh.
---
(this was a real camp I came across. It was hidden off in a side area so it felt like an Easter egg lmao)
---
There’s “more challenging” then there’s completely fucking killing the game. This is killing it. Because my build was heavily optimised, I lost over 80% of my damage. If I took the right buffs in PvE, I was dealing over 1500 damage per shot. Now I’m lucky if I manage that in 10 rounds.
---
Anyone who sees "I wanted a little change but they changed it too much" and responds with your kind of post, is just actively looking for an argument.
---
True I don’t support cheating in anyway nor do I partake in it. I myself like update it’s what this game needs a little tweaking here and there (vats needs tweaked) but overall the game is better now imho.
---
You should also try pulse grenades. See if you like that better than the dynamite. It shorts them out even if they're not too close to the blast.
---
I based one of my alts on my dog. If something can be consumed I eat it as soon as I see it. I mean, someone else could come along and eat that thing before me! The horror. Must consume now! Your aid tab should have one item listed: stimpaks. Otherwise if you find it you eat/use it. Bathroom floor drugs? Yummo. That bag of 100+ spoiled meat left at the RR station? Chow down. Vomiting on the rug is optional.
---
lol its gonna be
---
You deserve much gold for this, too bad I have none to give but you deserve it!
---
Yeah wallace
---
Yes on the ammo box
---
Actually just create boxes for each 'group' in the inventory ... instant stash boost across the board. Scrapbox showed this is possible.
---
Now when is my sweet Double Barrel getting a skin?!
---
Leader of the pack level 10-15 encounter?
---
Nope, your sneak rifle build now takes 6 shots from instigating lever gun for wolves.  The second weakest mob in the game takes a level 85 with full rifleman perks 6 shots to kill.
---
Really I tried it earlier and it didn't work
---
Haha, I've yet to find anything that can be purchased with integrity any more 😂. So after you factor in the 2,000 Atoms you get in return from ranking up the board, it was right a around 12,500 Atoms.
---
so far horrible bullet sponges back on the menu + forest and urban scout are not the same set by bethesda standards...
---
I was under the impression that serendipity didnt work in PA, has this been changed?
---
Yeah you'll get a new quest pointer, it leads you to a note and the rest is a walk in the park.
---
It should have ended that day, but evil was allowed to endure. Isildur kept the Ring.
---
I just put walls up, ive got an extracter 9n the concrete deposit so I can fix them when their potshots eventually hit them, and turrets if they get brave
---
You can solo ops to the first 2 ranks.
---
did you read my post? Its about adapting to the situation, I didnt complain in a single sentence.
---
Last night we had two Earle fights and one queen fight. And all three went down with in ten minutes. Pretty sure ppl used magic weapons but it can still be done. And I have the ammo legendary perk maxed. So with that and the other ammo card and super duper I get around 100 per craft of 45
---
I really don’t understand why Bethesda would add this whole new dimension to the game and shit on one of the most popular builds in the game. I am also not a melee build and that meant I had a really shitty time running that op by myself yesterday.
---
COT DANGGIT!!
---
Does 1 piece of chameleon armour make a difference with stealth? I run full Uny/Ap/Sent with all the relevant perks and haven't spent much time checking since the update.
---
Just go play something else
---
They fucked with the camp budget values again for some reason.
---
I've died more in the less than 24 hours than I have in the past month. My guns are like BB guns now. I am going to have to respec now but I'm getting my ass kicked so easily im going to be out of stimpacks by the end of the week and scraping to survive. I know this game is set in the apocalypse and all but fallout has never been a game where you struggle to find aid and ammo to the point where there is a risk you can run out of both and be unable to progress. I wasn't prepared for this update at all.
---
Yeah, I was aware of the assaultron head, but had no idea about the harpoon gun. Probably there's more.
---
Haha
---
Ah cool not that bad really.
---
Im happy too the game feels more challenging and i like it
---
FYI the bench bug doesn't actually reset the timer. I had some fun boosting my strength to like +40 buff and at some point later was hit with "you are over encumbered!" and saw that the buff was down to +16, which means that each stack of the buff had its own timer rather than bring refreshed. This makes the bug way less busted since its not like you can just have semi-permanent absurd buffs to STR; You gotta keep applying them
---
I suspect that's because the main reason for these changes was to slow the game down. It's the same reason most of the newer additions have been massively grindy and timegated - they believe that the slower they make player progress, the more time people will spend playing, and therefore the more opportunities they'll have to buy things from the shop.
---
Which mod manager please? Does it switch to a new settings file too? I have personalized camera settings for adventure, but these settings are blocked for NW and I have to manually switch between the two files.
---
Also noticed strange in numbers wasn’t working when someone on my team was sharing it. I had to equip it personally for it to work.
---
You’ll be fine... Just don’t tell the truth here *too* much or you’ll lose a lot more than 3 comment karma.
---
Im level 76 and im loving the new update
---
You and every other shit bloody build is out here complaining about their damage, if you can't figure a plausible way to continue then quit. You don't need to switch guns you need to switch how you play.
---
The enemies in daily ops drop ammo for the corresponding weapon being used. You can farm some ammo there.
---
Yep, and they will be as good as dead if betheada doesn't do anything about the budget. I bet you instanced camps will still take up our general budget
---
Bloodied stealth cammando and yea I went from 2k headshot crits to 250 headshot crit I was all for a rebalancing and I dont need to one shot everything but they reduced my damage by almost 90%
---
This game is basically a Greatest Hits of bugs, glitches and exploits since its inception, what would you expect?
---
Great timing. I just hit a point where I feel like I can finally quit doing their daily missions because I own every single plan I wanted from them.
---
LMAO they turned the world into Eos the 10 years after Noct on ffxv came back high level monsters everywhere
---
This daily ops forces me to do melee. So I just totally skip it.
---
Hmm 🤔, good to know. I'll update that info in my OP. Thanks for letting me know👍🏼
---
Surprising us with the enemies that need melee to be finished off didn't help this either. 5 Mr gutsys together were a death sentence before this.
---
Thanks for the detailed reponse! 
---
I suppose I might do without some of the strength perks, but without FO1st and a lot of stimpacks, I kinda feel like I could use it. It's kind of a luxury choice I guess against a more useful one but I feel like I could at least give it a try. I currently run the high capacity backpack, might have to run some calculations and see if the chemists would be better. Sturdy Frame seems to be the one I could easily lose though and change for 2* Blocker. I'll keep that in mind.
---
Thanks to the Perk Loadout mod I should also be easily able to swap for a heavy weapons build during events or somesuch, where it doesn't really matter if I'm over my weight limit or not. Swapping in some heavy weapon cards shouldn't be a problem.
---
I guess I'll kick Fire in the Hole though and put the point into Charisma for one more level of Bodyguard.
---
I'm also thinking about kicking out Thru Hiker in Agility, could easily change that for Serendipidty and see if my weight isn't affected too badly and still change back later on.
---
In the end the most important part for now seems to me that the SPECIAL points are roughly at the right amount so i don't have to switch them out too much and can still experiment with some alternative cards in the meantime.
---
The cost is too much for that imo, there's never usefull thing to picklock and when the load outs will be a thing you would just have lost your perk points...
---
Too late for me - RIP 150 perk coins 😔
---
I am enjoying it very much, only complain is I experienced a couple off odd crashes today, question, did they fixed teslas?  I encountered them in a couple of events (daily ops and earle) and it didn’t sucked that much, I am praying that did fixed them and it’s not just random luck
---
Bloodied melee is trash now. Everything else is nice
---
The perk loadout will come at the end of this year more or less.
---
And the PA to favorite wheel well..... Always wanted but I never hear bestes Bethesda talking about it. Sadly...
---
They've not made the game harder though. They've just made it slower.
---
It's the supplies that are the problem. Sure the game does allow you to craft stuff but none of us were prepared for the fact we are actually going to fully run out of stimpacks and have to come up with a new way of not letting basic enemies destroy you.
---
Yeah but at least now theres two more free fast travel points for general convenience. I feel you though, could have come with the wastelanders update, at least after you've gained a certain reputation level with them.
---
i run regular heavy gunner (using instigating, furious, Suppressor's Vampires etc) and my damage has barely changed at all
---
These builds are not spray and pray, people have taken many hours to perfect these builds, hitting at the right time and dying many times to experiment with them. Bloodied was stagnant for sure, some people have to virtually start over again, not everyone is into that dude.
---
No stealth during Daily Ops. It's deactivated. So enemies know where you are, you are constantly attacked and there is no sneak multiplier.
---
While the damage balance is obviously having an impact, on it's own I think it may of been fine, but add in the scaling enemies, and Beth have done what so many have done before them and over-compensated in the other direction.
---
I didnt complain. And I dont understand this attitude towards bloodied builds, I guess it's some kind of inferiority complex.
---
That's what I didn't like. I couldn't care less if it was animated or not because it makes no difference but it was worth 5 times more. I liked it that way but 2 per star is still pretty good because it boosts the regular cards at least
---
Can verify. Though, some of the higher level creatures I am seeing now need two shots from the magic shotgun instead of just one. Also, maybe it’s just me, or some other weird thing, but I feel like my action point regeneration is lower since the patch Or maybe that’s is using more AP?
---
Would like to have some video proof, there was to many false trade/vendor  rumors in the past
---
I use bloodied AA gatling.  My damage doesn't seem to have dropped all that significantly, but the enemies are now sponges.  Everything has become tedious.
---
I was getting random ammo from my EE handmade. Wonder if it’s because melee does the dealing blow?
---
Struggle is a good word here. Fallout games have never been a struggle. There are plenty of survival games where you do scrape to survive but fallout was never one. If was a fun apocalypse. This change has made the game slower and difficult. Avoiding a raider camp because you don't have 10 stimpacks to spare isn't what fallout should be
---
I think I came across you... Weren’t you the level 160 dude who charged me and killed me while I was staggered for contesting your workshop? I found it hilarious because the Thomas the Tank Engine theme was playing.
---
You sure it's not legacy like explosive laser weapons?
---
I'm using maybe two more rounds per enemy than i was pre patch on non bloodied heavy gunner
---
fucking what? Lol thats so backwards. If its says three next to it the logically that means you're getting three for whatever price is next to it too. If they want to out a cap on availability then actually type it out. "MAX ALLOWABLE 3 PER DAY". not fucking hard.
---
Just accept...looks legit to me!lol
---
for the community the bitches endlessly about bugs exploits and cheaters not to completely endorse broken weapon exploits just because some amphibian made a video.
---
this sub is full of absolute hypocrites .
---
right? ONE lunchbox for half a days grind of gold??
---
Probably depends on your build. My bloodied build is still doing just fine, over all it seems like a 10-15% damage decrease at first for me but with follow through my sneak attacks to 40% more damage now so I actually gained 20% more damage overall from the update. But enemies are higher level so naturally they will take more shots to down I mean a level 110 super mutant butcher is almost twice as resilant as the regular max level of 68. Some build have it hard than others I hear bolt action rifles and melee builds have it the worst.
---
Good thing the better skin works...amirite?
---
How would you allow stealth builds to use stealth without just cheesing the whole thing and skipping combat until the boss?
---
I'm not in PA... Neither am I spamming Stims... Just using born survivor.
---
This dude tells you about a sniper build doing 130 sneak damage to basic enemies with like over 1,000 HP and you're saying that this is acceptable? I don't think it is.
---
How could you?
---
Even worse how are we expected to change from a now crap build?  Get 45 levels to adjust? Can’t kill, how to level?  
---
Start over? Nope. New character is harder to play than high end with patch
---
I feel ya and I'm level 97.
---
My 50 cal, x2 Shot, Sting Mag with all X3 Rifleman Perk cards maxed and all the goodies stealth perks.... And my rifle is acting like some level 2 hunting rifle I picked up a few feet from the vault.
---
My x2 shot, increased damage per consecutive hit combat shotgun with sting Mag and harden receiver isn't much better.
---
Just did the Radiation Rumble event and while in full stealth and point blank, it took x12 shots from my combat shotgun to drop one snallygaster.
---
Note that this is a stinging mag holding x10 rounds and x2 shot per round... And had to reload to finish the damn thing off!
---
That's x24 regular shotgun rounds!
---
Without the hardened receiver, a maxed shotgun Perk card and stinging mag, it would have been even more than that.
---
What the sweet hell, Bethesda?
---
Man take a chill pill or something. Ranting like a grouchy toddler with shit in his nappy.
---
Out of desperation I've had to use the lucky break perk today in the hope my armour lasts. I don't have the supplies to constantly repair now that enemies are surviving much longer to land more hits on my gear. Ballistic fiber was already a difficult thing to find
---
Yeah, this is where me hoarding my levels instead of choosing cards helped. I had 15 to do with what I wanted after cleaning up the useless cards and could swap some out. You can pick and rank up cards you already have maxed now, if that helps.
---
I don’t like it.  A giant mechanic to having levels is to become a greater level than enemies in some areas. Overpowering some areas. Now leveling up has nothing to do with the game anymore other than getting Legendary Perk slots.
---
I came across a level 50 eyebot in a north west area of the map. I killed it in two swings, but I was like, this is dumb. He should be a single pistol bullet.
---
The map is cut up into sections. Each section should have different maximums for enemies. The forest area, that eyebot should never go above level 10. A ghoul should never go over level 25. 
---
Then cranberry bog, crank that up. It’s a high level area. 
---
Just saying it again, there is almost no point to the leveling system anymore. 
---
I kinda want them to put it back already. 
---
It is also nice to help low levels with high quests. I didn’t mind the stranger asking for help on a quest and tearing through it with them. I assume low levels are just going to see eye to eye with all enemy’s now. Which if I were in their boots, I would not like the fact that the challenge of being a low level has been removed. It’s fun to be an under level scrub and come out on top! 
---
I think this update was poison to this game.
---
Also, I didn’t remember anyone asking for this? Or is there a explosion of requests for this change somewhere I missed?
---
Yes, but he was a pain to find unless you knew where to look.
---
Eh my stash already is insanely laggy. Maybe increasing it by 200 every year and doing play testing around that to see wats to improve the lag
---
There was no build diversity before LMFAO
---
&gt;  I’m dreading the daily from the overseer that sends me to the Colonel Kelly monument for a pic....
---
You don't need to aggro the mobs at that location. Just take the pic from where you spawn after fast traveling. Same with the Blackbear Lodge: don't move, take your shot, done. 
---
You are sh!t out of luck when you get the camping site, though, as you'll have to walk into whatever mobs are chilling there. Max lvl floaters for example. Yay...!
---
Have you ever taken the time to nurture a Bloodied build? You don't just walk in, kill everything and collect rewards bud, there's a bit more to it than that.
---
Maybe, just maybe, I'll follow you lead. I give a few weeks, to earn some ranks by my self, but after that, I may buy the ranks. Atom-shop does not offer me much, and as a F1st member, I have a lot of atoms to spend.
---
There seems to be some thing about this, you may be right. I noticed that my AP regen was really slow, but then I did a bunch of stuff loading up my legendary perks, and when I unequipped and then reequipped action girl, it seem to go back to normal.
---
I think fallout 76 would be a better game if melee vs SBQ looked more like when a cat sees a moth
---
Two hundred dollars on a dupe glitch if they released one!
---
Am also hoping for a fix for this. I get that technically one is Urban, one is Forest and then there’s the Vault 94 variants, but at the very least the Urban and Forest should work.
---
Yea it pissed me off to no end half of the biulds in fo76 rely on stealth but let's add a new feature that makes them all obsolete. And dont get me started on damage nerf. I'm all for a rebalancing and I dont need to one shot everything in the game but my bloodied cammando took an almost 90 percent cut in damage. Went from 2k headshot crits to 250
---
I searched but couldnt find any. Apparently my searxh skills suck on Reddit.
---
If you haven't bought the game yet simply dont buy it. Before it was a grind after level 50. Now it's fucking mount everest to get to level 50 just to start bullshit grinding on daily limits. Its pretty damn insane how hard it is pre 50 now. 
---
If youre casual it might be time to decide on something else to do as youre cucked.  Its honestly not that bad as long as you have a focused build. You can't just have random perks. Also gonna need to get good equips. This will require you to be less casual just to keep your damage relevant to the game in some capacity so you dont die to dumb things like radtoads. 
---
If youre hardcore. I guarantee you whatever damage nerf youre feeling it is infinitly worse for casual players.
---
As a stealth bloodied commando.... it's no fun either
---
Where is this wotoga located? radio massages sound intriguing and I'd like to receive one
---
My flaming pitchfork! How can I feel like an angry villager without the requisite flaming pitchfork?
---
I had a bloodied 10mm. It was basically worthless against anything over lvl 10 but it gave me a way to use up any 10mm ammo I picked up and saved my stronger weapons for stronger enemies.
---
An ammo box and a place where I could store chems would be nice as well. We can all dream I guess.
---
Yeah I do purchase stuff from the Atom store pretty regularly, but I had well over 6,000 Atoms already just sitting there, so it wasn't really that much to get the rest needed to hit Max rank. Best of luck with it my friend👍🏼
---
hahah reference!!!!
---
Please tell me how I’m supposed to provide proof.
---
Apparently you have angered the big gun meta builds. Don’t know why people are down voting this, your comment was a perfectly reasonable response to this complaint.
---
Jeez. I just took a break to start playing horror games since Halloween is coming up.  Now I’m glad  I did since I’m only level 35.
---
You must have been brilliant at hide and seek as a kid , genius
---
Oh, I'm aware, I just thought some people might get a chuckle out of seeing this.
---
Aye, my backup is an bloodied mole gauntlet with swingspeed and it showed about 2k with mutations perks and buffs and about 800 now. But it dosent feel much different imo either! Thanks for sharing your build and thoughts :)
---
Tank Killer affects shotguns?
---
Yep. I’m only level 39 and having to shoot 15-20 5.56 rounds in to every enemy now. Broke my sword after the 2nd enemy scorched. I don’t feel powerful at all.
---
tHiS CoMmUnItY iS aWeSoMe BrUh
---
Honestly it felt like dealing with mobs went from easy-breezy to actually putting some effort and strategy into it. Overall I'd say it's a step up because farming xp had started to become boring without any real challenge.
---
I feel the same way 3 outta 5 of my characters rely on stealth and none of them can run daily ops... so basically we are back to being forced into Pa heavy biulds like the very beginning of the game.
---
Nice summary of options.  Unlike others ITT I appreciate your report.
---
It's the 2 shots to take out a bee swarm for me
---
Ultimately, it's now weapon selection and ammo cost.  I trended towards ballistic gatling for ammo cost/damage on my heavy, it's still holding even after patch 22.  just converted a stealth sniper to stealth heavy gunner, kill myself a lot (splash damage), but otherwise a playable character.  My Gauss sniper/Vampire as back-up works, but not exceptional.
---
Yeah same with my rifle and melee builds. Most damage doesn't seem to even register half the time.
---
When its accessible for all, it cant be good for all. Some people prefer some challenge in games, others like god mode 1shooting boring fest. But go ahead with your communism
---
The timer visually resets but in actuality each stack of the buff has its own timer that is seperately counting down, so you cannot keep max STR going by coming back every 30min
---
Why dont use a i can use anything build:

---
Harper's Ferry is liable to be the Free States base of operations if they come back. We never did see Raleigh's body after all...
---
I used my bloodied commando for my first play through.  I didn’t even look at damage numbers. I Went to west tek.  Yea it look a couple more bullets but shit died easily enough still.  2-3 shots.  
---
Out of sneak requires little more ammo dump but again, not really an issue.  4-5 shots.  
---
It can prob use some more tweaking in the future, but the game feels better IMO.
---
It's for daily ops that are uplink missions, so for now yes it will be always there but when they add more mission it won't always be on each one.
---
The main issue I have with the bloodied build nerf is that we are already at a disadvantage by having less health. Does it not make sense that bloodied builds should have a higher damage output than the other builds seeing as there is the huge disadvantage of greatly reduced health? 
---
All this has done is force players to change their build now, which doesn’t do anything to “balance” the game, instead it just removes a viable build from the already tiny list of viable builds.
---
Thanks,  I feared it was just RNG
---
I'm bloody vats commando and sometimes swap to rifles. All day today I played commando and while my damage number is smaller I still melt almost everything.
---
OPs for example today was a rough one for first day live because it was bots, burrows, resilience(hardest faction, worst map, worst mutation). I Just swap my sneak for dodgy remove most of my rads and throw on some power armor and did fine. 2 of us shooting 2 of us melee did ops in 6 min 20 seconds. Not super min/maxed types on my team either. Ops are fun require teamwork and adapting. At first I was mad about stealth not working but realized after a few ops runs that if stealth did work I could just sneak past everything repair the stuff and then kill the last group and likely be done in under 5 min with maybe only every taking some of their blind fire. Honestly sounds boring.
---
Also did an earle with a friend 2 man he's a vampire heavy gunner we took out time to farm windegos my shots on earle are about 60-70 each more if I hold crit and charge my adrenaline and gunfu off windego. Not sure if I can solo earle now but I mean if you ask me queen and earle shouldn't be solo should take a team last a bit and be fun.
---
while I still melt everything else and Because stealth seems to be working really well again enemies are not a concern. Even scorch beasts still go down in a clip or less from my fixer.
---
Also played my junkies heavy gunner for a little he seems fine still. Ran a queen in a random lobby she still went down in about 13 minutes.
---
Numbers got smaller but game seems fine to me. Did a bunch of events too like project paradise and radiation rumble now just actually have to make sure I don't get cocky but its still easy mode.
---
Before this update my stealth seemed broken I would get found a lot which seemed to get worse every update since wastelanders(was fine pre wastelanders) but now after patch 22 it seems good again didn't get danger at all today.
---
Also lowest level I see now is level 50 so getting much more XP which is amazing I can enjoy all areas of the map and get decent XP instead of a handful of locations. Easily best part of the update.
---
If and when I get tired of my build this is probably what I will try! Thanks for sharing :)
---
Bloodied Unarmed here and doing just fine. Obviously I’m not one punching Scorchbeasts anymore but it didn’t really feel like I should have been doing it to begin with. Ran about 7 Daily Ops and came in under 8 minutes on all of them.   Really enjoying the challenge.
---
Don’t let the Down votes fool you, that is exactly what they are mad about.
---
As messed up as this is going to sound...I think it’s got to be said. This is usually how difficult MMO’s are for players starting out. Fallout 76 is a Pseudo-MMO as it’s missing the massive part, but it’s got all the other stuff. For example, the massive grind. My advice would be to ask a high level player for some help if your having trouble, or look up some strong builds online. It’s not easy playing these types of games casually. This isn’t Fallout 5 single player. It’s clear Bethesda is trying to up the difficulty for team fights. Which is probably why players are able to tag along with higher leveled player now.
---
Getting help from higher leveled players is what I had to do in ESO, WOW, BDO, and Final Fantasy Online. I’ve been playin this game since beta. So, I didn’t have the luxury of getting help from higher level players. New players now have that luxury, and this community is very helpful for the most part. Don’t be afraid to ask if your a new player. Join those event and casual teams to for the sweet xp boost. 
---
This legendary perks (champion points) system is also going to be very helpful for new characters that get created. So, new players should focus on getting to 50 quick. New players hoping for the Fallout 4/New Vegas experience, are going to be very disappointed by this patch. Once you find a great group of friends, this game gets really good. Really hope Bethesda thinks about adding a guild system. It’s really needed, especially to help new players.
---
All the same armor type:scout, marine, secret service..etc
---
292 bloody stealth commando
---
159 bloody heavy
---
142 junkies heavy
---
3 characters and no problem with damage or survivability.
---
Seems to me like you need to visit nukesdragons.com
---
I'm out though, gonna go enjoy the update and my new perk cards instead of complaining that my damage got regulated against enemies with new max levels and new resistances.
---
Main missions generally are your quest missions
---
um why would you use a shotgun against a turret..? no wonder it kept killing you, that's just dumb. Like no offence but a little bit of strategic thinking and maybe you'd have an easier time. Take them out from a distance where they can't get a shot on you and you'll be fine.
---
The trick is that if you find yourself in a story mission you’ve inadvertently went to far and ended up in fallout new Vegas simply backtrack to where there is no mission and you’ll be in 76 again
---
The presidential guess rifle skin would actually fit in pretty well here, seeing as how this is all about American Patriots vs communists, too bad its only in the dev rooms
---
Duh, record a video and post it here?
---
I tried moving my camp once, after a week of rebuilding I opted to move back and  uilt it back a hundred times better after the 5th attempt 2 weeks later.
---
Usually about a 3 day affair for me.
---
But now when I get the itch to build only choice I got is to build for newbies or slum it in a workshop.
---
Instanced camps and mannequins cant get here soon enough.  Theres just no space to play with these new items.
---
Pretty sure the OP was merely pointing out that since Bloodied isn't that much stronger than other weapons, it opens up weapon/playstyle options that we may not have considered before.  I didn't take it as crying at all.
---
The coin part is true, the slot part is wrong, you get a Legendary Perk Slot at level 50, 75, 100, 150, 200 &amp; 300
---
This patch definitely feels bad for people who aren't max level and don't have fully realized/min-maxed builds. Hell, it may possibly feel bad for people who *do* have that.
---
All I know is that it takes 3x more ammo to kill what I would call "standard enemies" anymore. Your basic pipe-gun wielding scorched can take a half dozen shotgun rounds to the face and still come back for more.
---
Don't even get me started on enemies that I had trouble with *before* the patch. Things like yao guai, radscorpions, or deathclaws were already difficult to kill. Their HP and damage output compared to mine (a level 33 now) were through the roof, so I often had to pussyfoot around and find cheesy ways to kill them. But now I just run away from them, because I don't have enough shotgun ammo to put them down (especially if they come in duos or more). And don't even get me started on assaultrons...
---
I actually had to make a new marksman rifle with a .38 receiver just because it's the only ammo I had in abundance. And with no way to respec outside of whatever weird method they made up for people who are above 50, I may as well just spend every cap I have on ammo.
---
my instigating supersledge with the new AoE vats legendary perk has been a blast, i upped it to 5 stars right away so i have a 50% chance to do an AoE vats attack and it rocks.
---
When you open your Pipboy and look at your Quests it will say Main, Side, Daily. Anything in the main section is the main story.
---
Oh no, nine bullets, the humanity, oh the humanity.
---
My meta bloodied commando has no issues killing things or surviving.
---
Yeah. My current armor pieces are a mix of -15% damage, Weightless and one piece of Chameleon gear. Originally I wanted Vanguard, but oh well. Second and third attributes are basically everything except AP refresh and weight reduction, go figure... that is basically my luck in this game so far :P
---
Record a video of what? Someone taking shit from my vendors? Or me taking shit from others?
---
Delete record tapes and other vanity items, should decrease the lag a bit
---
I‘m used to downvotes if you comment and don’t agree with „everything is bad now“ or „please give me everything for free with no effort“. Also I gotta Test snipers, but right now I need less shots on a junkies build at the moment than what is being described here on a bloodied. So for the moment it’s just a big (x) from me.
---
Thanks though :)
---
And my next few months are ruined
---
Oh yeah, but people don't seem to be nuking the Whitespring as often these days.
---
was 1 shotting the level 72 robots with an instigating supersledge (sadly i dont have something with armor penetration, but itll do)
---
I might actually try my luck with my modules and hope for a good gauss minigun! Atm I have a 50 cal AAE wich I roll with. What is a good legendarycombo to look out for?
---
i'm rifleman, done ops multiple times, APC, RR, and overall some minor wandering, testing guns and stuff.  
---
and i can tell **its fiiiine.**  
---
pre-patch you could get away with literally any weapon, if you had proper legendary effects on them and a decent build.  
---
now you have to look for more optimal weapons, and hunting rifle is not one of them. the base damage, firerate, mag size. its not viable for any serious events. like for example on my rifleman i have BSS40 shovel. and just on strength from uny set, adrenal+nerd rage i could annihilate mobs without even looking which way i'm shoveling. now i can only scratch my butt with it. B10 AR died too, BFFR gauss rifle suffered a lil but still kicks shit out of enemies, lever and railway are too, still can provide decent damage output.  
---
dont complain, adapt:)  
---
and slap that awareness for a day or so, coz some emenies now got increased defence stats, making armor penetration even more important
---
Great point!  However, some other games companies do listen to feedback much better than this.  I know you're not saying otherwise, I'm sure the devs at the coalface are all cool guys and gals, but let's not give the company as a whole any credit it does not deserve.
---
Nah, bloodied is still a glass cannon even with every damage reduction perk in the book.
---
Also thanks for sharing you build! :)
---
None of them compare to the power of pre patch builds !!
---
Absolutely. I remember being overwhelmed with it when first starting out. Good luck in the Wasteland man.
---
Follow through is pretty good
---
50, 100, 150  = 300 total
---
I'd like to see scrip notes so Bethesda can still have their daily limit for "balance" or whatever.
---
With scrip notes I could just scrip everything, clean out a few hundred pounds on my mule and then also not worry about all the extra scrip past the 150 if I have a long play session.
---
Yeah, it would be *SO* fun and interactive if stealth would work. Sneak to the first objective and activate it, sneak to the second objective, activate it and wait in the shadows till the progress bar is full, sneak to the third objective, activate it and wait till the progress bar is full (without any kind of combat till here ...). Then sneak to the last objective, take out the enemies without getting a shot back and kill the boss without being noticed. YEAH, not stupid at all ...
---
I'm playing a sneak commando myself, by i can comprehend, why they made this. Sneak builds are the top tier of builds out there. Risk-free, high damage output, ammo conservative. It would be way over the top, if you would make those Ops effortless too. So, stop whining, get a group/change your playstyle/man up and just do this. Or let it be, i'm not your mother.
---
From a sniping hunting rifle?
---
"Oh no, you spent 20 seconds of precision shots killing a single mob in a group of 3-5"
---
I don't understand why you're being like this.
---
I'm trying and thanks again
---
Probably because you have  a "magic shotgun". These things deal massivly more damage in vats due to a bug and are therefore on par with other weapons
---
Instigators / junkies / medics / infiltrators / 33% vats hit chance / 50% limb damage / extra bash damage on it maybe?
---
What I want to know is
---
If you level up a legendary perk, then unequip it, will it still be leveled? Normally you'd think yes, but it costs a coin to unequip them so I'm not confident
---
Apparently Master Infiltrator's auto bypass doesn't contribute to lockpicking or hacking challenges so leveling it up potentially has a lot of issues
---
What platform are you on? I might be able to help you out.
---
Great, thank you! Do you think it’s worth maxing Master Infiltrator?
---
Novelty stuff. I don't really want any of them, not that many are useful, but I guess I could get them.
---
Nah you don’t lose them. It’s the same as un equipping a normal Perk Card.
---
I've heard that's because a stash box is in the near of your vendor. 
---
Is that the case for you?
---
We're not all upset. The only people moaning are sad fucks that masturbate over weapon stats.
---
Sucks that the Halloween one doesn't work yet, but I'll take Dark Matter for now.
---
oof forgot about that
---
This is so true lol
---
Oh and for the record, I don't play mutations, bloodied or junkie. I prefer to have full health for when I need it and relied on my stealth tactics.
---
I can't do that anymore because I can't stealth like I did before, because my weapons shoot nerf darts and just piss enemies off while they try and find me.... Tactics are out the Window and have to start lobbing nuka grenades at the mass of bad guys coming at me while I run away.
---
I suspect you will get most of the way there logging oncer per week. That's what you're thinking right? The way Bethesda wiped our arses last season to help stragglers indicates to me it would be possible with spending some atoms at the very end.
---
They went from multiplicative to additive..thus this kind of extreme build went like 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 to 2+2+2+2+2+2 much less at the end ...
---
I'm on xboc and while I reallllly appreciate the help l, I thoroughly enjoy the challenge and the grind.
---
I think it depends. For me personally on a high level ,optimized build, with best of the best gear and a few maxed out legendary perks its an awesome change and im loving every second of it.
---
However for low levels/ inexperienced or more casual players its a different experience entirely.
---
From the sounds of it, the low levels are the ones really struggling now, since damage is down things take a lot longer to kill for them. This means more resources have to be farmed constantly just to repair gear and make ammo. Folks that arent optimized or are still learning the game cant even fall back to low level areas to farm thag stuff either For alot of folks thats going to take the fun away, make it feel like a chore and discourage them from playing.
---
So for me its great, but total undertstand why some players are upset. I hope bethesda considers this when make more adjustments in the future.
---
nope, I have just the card, so I can still open everything, just have to do it manually.
---
save the coins for one of the other cards
---
I,m glad this is here, I was so bored easily wrecking everything in the wasteland, and I'm just a pa heavy weapon build and it was way to easy.
---
Taking away my safe haven of the forest is really gonna put a damper on my chems business. Lol
---
Agree, I’d be fine with reasonable nerfs if it didn’t turn the enemies into fucking bullet sponges.
---
Because normally I'd chuck 2-3 grenades at it and call it a day if I couldn't kill it (before patch) this used to be very effective, even if they were higher level than me. 
---
Now, post update. I spammed 6 grenades and it was still at 80% health. All my other guns did so little damage to it that each bullet did a couple ticks of health. To be fair on the damage nerf, my build is not specialized in any which way. Because this was a pre patch character I was scraping by. 
---
Also I was level 30. I didn't really have the option to many guns or ammo. I had 5 guns on me luckily but the only one that did noticeable enough damage was the shotgun. I guarantee you me dying over and over was still faster than if I sat back and tried to take pot shots at the damn thing. I would've ran through hundreds of bullets for a turret my own level.
---
Quick edit: for reference as well. I did the event communing with the mothman. You know how they have radtoads? They're fucking bullet sponges too. I literally can not take on even radtoads without wasting a ton of ammo. Before patch these were low level and died in a couple hits. Now killing them is literally a waste of ammo/time. It's more to my advantage to ignore these mobs that really shouldn't be an issue at level 30. But one wasteland makes them fucking tanks. Absolute units. Behemoths of the wasteland.
---
Bethdron- bethesda fans here will tell you to "le git gud"
---
👋👋
---
Ah okay! Might max What Rads instead then... what did you go for? I’m a solo build too...
---
Agree, and i mostly use instigating, but my furious flamer absolutely tore shit up in the daily ops today.
---
There are always more sides to a story; I can understand that people who play like 4-8h a day since launch with maxed out gear feel like the end game content is lacking and Im sure they love to show off that gear now. I totally get that. And I think somekind of level scaling for low level areas was needed. But than there are also people who play fo76 more casual and just want to roam around for a few hours per week and Im pretty sure they do not have great gear, maxed out perks and dont want to deal with constant repairs after 5 encounters. And lets not forget the people inbetween the casuals and hardcore consumers; they too do not have a perfect build even if they try and I would count myself to those inbetween and I honestly never had any issues before roaming the mire or cranberry bog but now; yesterday I basically almost died to a group of lvl 75 Molerats more than once and I did die against some feral guals 4 times in a row. And honestly that wouldnt be such a big deal but that I have to repair my gear every 20 min sure is an issue and it realy does take away the fun at leas for me and I can see it does for others too. #nohate if you enjoy it but I think nobody can deny that the buff in level scaling was set a bit to high considering how fast gear breaks. cough\* energie weapons cough\*
---
I was getting wrecked yesterday and one shot instantly from stealth from behind the enemies.
---
I believe theres an issue where perks need to be unequipped before they start functioning properly. 
---
Making it feel like we're way weaker than we actually are.
---
After some time moving perks about setting up my legendaries it all started to feel more normalized. 
---
So will attempt a full blown refresh of them when I start up today.
---
The shooting gallery should have boosted critical shots or vats accuracy for a set time.
---
Looks cool though so does the train model set however without a larger camp budget, i probably wont use any of this stuff. A 5% budget increase would be appreciated but its probably difficult to implement without causing issues.
---
I'm half tempted to learn how to do texture modding just to be like "TODD I DID THE WORK FOR YOU"
---
Yknow, assuming I don't suck ass at it :^)
---
I have had daily crashes, usually more than one, for a long time now. Long before this update. And I haven't used a tesla before so I'm not sure, but I hope so.
---
Junkies mini is a magic / bugged weapon that does way more damage than it should tho.
---
But yeah, I'm also running a magic mini and the patch is fine for me. my gf's sniper build has serious issues tho.
---
If you are on PC you could use Perk Loadout Manager, available from Nexus, unfortunately if you are on console you will have to wait for Beth to include perk loadouts in a later update.
---
As to the PA on favourite wheel I would doubt it.
---
Even the flies and mosquito things are level 50 now. Why? To make you waste more of your ammo so you have to play the game much more to regain that ammo of course haha silly question!
---
To be fair, Figuring out new options is a far more reasonable response than the whiny rage quitters I have been seeing all over this forum.
---
That's the one I was most happy to see that they were including. I've always hated swapping hacking/picklock cards in and out. I'm so glad that they actually listened when we asked for this.
---
I’m giving it a try....likely use another SPECIAL.
---
Yeah I went from a be 50 cal to a anti armor ffr flamer and it smokes everything but everything is also smoking me
---
And Fallout 1st is required.
---
Honestly that's a fantastic idea, and something I would of loved, but it's just a interactive decoration I'm afraid.
---
yes be out, and next time shut up in the first place if you have nothing to say.
---
It........ just......... works.
---
Don’t be a square, man. /s
---
I'm bloodied too, level 250, tried the daily op without even using PA.  Maybe a dozen stims, few hundred rounds, and 3 deaths, and I'm not a great player by any means.  I don't know why SS PA is giving you so much trouble,were you trying to solo it?
---
I'm fine with them being this level of challenging.  The problem in my view isnt the daily ops, its the regular game world, which *isnt* challenging, but is now very, very tedious.
---
Scaling to your level should have never been a default setting by the sound of things.  
---
They should have either made a new mode that opens once you reach level 50 where everything is nearly maxed all the time, or they should add a setting in options that controls the scaling to make the game potentially more challenging.
---
Ammo factory is good , far flung fireworks would be good to too if it worked more consistently.  Sometimes it does sometimes it doesn't,  I mean as in damage . Sometimes it damages other targets other times it doesn't
---
Yeah, totally digging them. I actually don’t even care for most of the specific legendary perk cards, but the unlock terminals and what not frees up three slots in perception, and then I can finally add more points to my under developed categories.
---
On the plus side, Conan Exiles, Isle of Siptah will be out soon.
---
I was there gandalf, 3000 years ago
---
Wait, what?  I missed this somehow?! 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
And butchers bounty doesn't even work with them anymore. So, you put in all that ammo and time with 20 ticks for 5 tick blood.
---
I could hit behemoths for over 10k. With the same gear I am now hitting 800s or less. Now the prior was exrteme (if you consider stacking chems, food, specific armor and weapons extreme) but this is extreme in the other direction. Even my non bloodied instigating build got a 50% damage nerf while enemies gained more HP.
---
I kinda did. Events like “one violent night”, campfire tales”, and “uranium fever” are much more desirable do for higher level players now. As the legendary enemies scale with our level. So, we get max legendary weapons from these events now.
---
I'm fine with enemy scaling but they should have enemy scaling bases on player and region I don't want to go to vault 76 and be met with 5 lvl 50 liberators
---
Bloodieds were OP anyways, they shouldn't have let bloodied builds get as powerful as they did
---
This right here.  Loaded up my Bloodied commando and didn’t even look at damage numbers.  Went straight to wes tek.  
---
Yea, people crying are being drama queens.  Yea I felt the power difference, but things died just as EZ.  Couple more shots.  Watch out. Its the end of the world.
---
exactly, theres workarounds and one big topic i havent heard of yet is that there still are areas and new farming locations that have a level 50 cap
---
so once people realize they dont need to run westtek and the whitespring resort anymore but rather focus on locations like helvetia and morgantown, things will get better.
---
Even with a casual character level 50 enemies should be killable but i totally agree that theres a large amount of players that wont even sufficiently take down level 50 ghouls.
---
Time will tell how hard this update hits us and one things certain, the game got more tactical 👍🏼
---
It was tough challenge on my Bloodied, Stealth Melee character but I got it done.  At one point I thought it was impossible to kill the boss at the end, somehow managed it through a flurry of aerial attacks. 
---
I enjoyed the game being hard for the first time in a long time.
---
Oh yeah lol turrets. I had a bunch of raiders who had a turret mounted on the back of a truck near watoga.. fuck that turret shredded me xD
---
my agi was 9, so i went with the Agi card, missing 40 coins before i can get the last point in it, but that'll boost my Agi to 14 total, going for the adrenaline card and maybe more Action points, but thats just me ;)
---
It's ridiculous. **Some enemies just need to be easy to kill.** Shit like radroaches and mole rats (the standard ones, mind you, not the glowing versions) should be able to be killed with one or two well-placed bashes. I shouldn't be using ammo of any kind to kill this kind of stuff. I never asked to get 62 experience for killing a radroach. I ask to be able to smash it thoughtlessly.
---
You doing something wrong then
---
Agreed. I sorta expected more from ops, it's cool and all but as far as time invested vs rewards gained, there are way better alternatives.
---
Even running West Tek is better than doing the daily ops in terms of reward. The XP gained from it needs a big buff tbh.
---
Whining on reddit instead of playing around with your perks to find a viable solution isnt gonna help you, bethesda isn't gonna turn around and un nerf builds because you can't 1 shot an enemy anymore. Stop bitching about the update and figure your shit out for yourself.
---
I'm not talking about their appearance, I'm talking about their functionality. They're about as easy to kill in 4 as they are in 76.
---
Look at PTS forum, they aren’t listening to anyone.
---
In the new daily ops, all the enemies drop ammo when they die. The ammo they drop corresponds with the weapon you’re holding. Even if your teammates get the kill, you can still pick up ammo!
---
Nuke is yourself, like i do, simple 😉
---
I feel you, because it is difficult to adjust to new normals, but also, that amount of damage is just stupid compared to what most other builds are putting out.
---
That’s kind of weird, when I play on my MacBook the text seems to read fine,  it then when I play on the 48” tv the text is harder to read
---
As far as the Assault Rifle showing up as invisible when placed on a Weapon Display; that bug actually started with Wastelanders. Really messed up my gun display. 
---
In addition I have a Pickaxe with Atomic Shop skins that also shows up as invisible in a Weapon Display.
---
do you have demolition expert and grenadier? If not that will help your cause quite substantially for that. double explosive radius and up to +60% damage i think. Lvl 30 was always a rough part of the game though, step back a bit and level up then move on and you should have a better experience. Whatever it is you end up doing, best of luck.
---
A lot just seem to be upset because they can't mindlessly one shot everything and now something like ops will actually require a bit of planning and teamwork.
---
I'm a bloody vats commando so no stealth in ops for me and all I did was take off some rads replace sneak with dodgy and did fine in the op. We had 2 of us shoot and 2 melee and we got done in under 7 minutes and had a blast. (Both our melee users were not spec for melee as well)
---
Mine is missing the magic limb damage or bash damage. It's dramatically lowered how often it "magics"
---
other than that i think 1 card will be the poison res legendary, just have to make sure i have the same type armor on, which isent that easy
---
eh I'm still pretty much one shotting most regular enemies. Went through Whitespring yesterday one shotted everything even level 100 ghouls.
---
It is a two shot gauss shotgun though so would that count as two shotting them? lol
---
Well keep it up. It will become easier. I am on PS4 so I can’t be any help but finding ppl to help you isn’t hard. The best advice is to join a public team. You get boosts from them. Casual is the best way to level up because of the intelligence boost. Intelligence directly effects the amount of XP you earn when doing anything.
---
Bloodied deathclaw feels fine to me. But at 3 perks verses my bloodied faster swing speed cultist dagger it is barely doing half the claws damage for an Investment of 9 perks and a loss of several defensive letks to boot.
---
I plead that they look into rebalancing pistols and daggers next now that the new damage system is in place.
---
I love that dagger and cant be parted with it for too long.
---
I’ve got the build, I have the armor and I’m using the weapons. Pre nerf (because that’s what it is, a mass nerf), I had no trouble. Not even in PvP. Now, I can’t kill anyone well geared, and they can’t kill me. PvE has also gone to shit, needing a whole magazine for a mole rat in the forest.
---
Woo? There's a huge backlog of stuff Bethesda has ignored for almost 2 years now.
---
They're actually not but ok xD
---
Not likely considering the daily ops locations and mutations are the same for everyone and having everyone on different timers wouldn't work for that.
---
I recently changed my whole build around to a bloodied stealth commando and after I got my first bloodied fixer from purveyor and then got two more. I used all 3 and loved the damage I was doing, but as you said. I got on last night and I was still one to two shotting enemies. The first server I was on a guy launched on Earle, we went down and took him down in ten minutes, then we launched another two and fought Earle again then the queen. None of those fights lasted forever. It was fun it was different but I def don’t think it’s as bad as they said it was. I mean now the regular scorch beasts actually take a little more to fight unlike when I could kill them in two seconds before. It’s not bad, ppl just believed it was the end.
---
Take sandman,  better criticals, eagle eyes mutation, tenderizer,  tank killer , Gun fu and every damage perk. Gauss rifles are pretty good if you can work around their buggy vats problem.
---
See I would love the idea of making the game more difficult so higher level players can keep enjoying the game (I’m a level 149 now bc I managed to level up twice yesterday, usually leveling up takes me about a week and a half!) but what I didn’t enjoy was nerfing every weapon in the game and making daily ops part of TLR without letting everyone try them first. 
---
Now because the enemies have been buffed I can’t step outside of my PA without getting absolutely shredded, even high level enemies before this patch weren’t able to do that much damage to me, plus now my weapons aren’t as effective. Daily Ops absolutely wrecked me, and don’t get me wrong I love a challenge, but when literally everything swarms me at once I don’t stand much of a chance. If they want to make the enemies tougher go right ahead but they shouldn’t nerf weapons to make it even harder on the players.
---
Oooh would love to roll a 2 shot Gauss shotgun, have got a furious one with 50% limb damage
---
It tells u when I last completed it though is why I said that.  I’m not 100% sure
---
&gt;every other game has a respec system...why not this one?
---
because beth wants you to spend more time in the game leveling characters from scratch so it boasts their game numbers
---
*The truth is you never had the guts to help.*
---
Yeah, I don't think the supplies are the issue. The problem is this new system seems to be based around helping high level players, and really hurts low level players. I usually have tons of ammo, stims, food, drink, etc. These supplies are generally managed very well, and I used to actually gain as I play. Today I pissed away 75% of my ammo, most of my stims, broke most of my weapons, had my armor broken like never before, actually almost ran out of the 185 purified waters I had on me, and managed to complete exactly 2 quests and walked part way through vault 94 (to see what was in there).
---
Trust me, it has nothing to do with supplies, and everything to do with the fact that I can not get weapons powerful enough to take on the enemies I need to take on. Not efficiently, anyways. I recall one fight that actually made my blood boil, and that's an accomplishment coming from a video game. We got surrounded by scorched, a place I have been many times before. My wife was doing ok, given her weapons were close to mine and she was a slightly lower level, so she was good. I was 4 levels higher, and the only weapon that didn't just scratch them was my power fist, when it actually decided to hit.
---
I got absolutely spanked by them, and that has literally never happened before. I died in that one area probably 10 times, lost the rest of my ammo, broke more gear, and I actually rage quit. I lost more in that one fight than 5 hours of gaming any time before, which as I said before, is not caused by lack of supplies. It's by over buffing enemies and over nerfing of weapons and builds, which in itself is poor game design.
---
Maybe if they want to make a challenge for higher level people, either have this system only affect people past level 50, or make it opt-in, because a lot of people seem to be against this change, and honestly I can see why.
---
Either way, I guess it doesn't really matter for me anymore. This has finally pushed the last bit of fun out of the game for my wife and I. We may return some time in the future, but until we see the game reach a state we feel we can find enjoyable, we have given up on it, and uninstalled the game. Life is too short to be wasting it on a game we don't find enjoyable anymore. To those that enjoy this game, I hope it doesn't get any worse for you. I'll come back when mods and private servers are a thing. Until then, I hope you all enjoy it as much as you can!
---
Edit: I would like to state that this update isn't the only thing that steered us away from this game. The guns don't always switch when you want them to, they often still switch unloaded (when I know I loaded it beforehand), there's this issue with the screen jumping forward when I turn (not sure how else to describe it other than it looks like it's skipping frames), which is disorienting and annoying, a lot of disconnects, weapons often not working, glitches from Fallout 4 that were fixed by the Fallout 4 modding community are back here, building limits suck, stash limits suck,  enemies rubber banding in both health and movement, having multiple of an object, bit not being able to place them all sucks (such as multiple scrap bots), only having a companion at base and only allowing 1 (which was a total letdown when they announced companions), and the list honestly goes on, and on, and on. You get the point. I'll go back to Fallout 4 and continue adding mods on. I'm at 366 now, shouldn't be long until my computer is on fire.
---
Yeah, it could help the devs to fix it, if it really persist, if you can reinproduce it. As i said, there was alot of rumors about trade glitches, which was proven to be false in the end
---
I did a fun challenge run for Fallout 4 a while ago, could be fun for FO76. 
---
After you complete a quest (main quest or wastelanders), you must strip yourself naked sell everything you have (stash the tradeble stuff).
---
 You must start your next quest fresh, but you may use any quest rewards from your previous quest. Searching around for a basic gear set and tackling quests this way a provides a unique challenge, you have to rely on every random thing you pick up.
---
Another random element you can add to this kind of playthrough is using a random number generator to choose what skill you pick when you level up. Instead of trying to aim for a certain build, you have to improvise your build as you level up.
---
Adding bullet sponge enemies doesn't make the game more challenging, it makes it stupidly hard for no reason. Im not having a good time wasting all my bullets on spongie enemies only to do it again on the next enemy i find.
---
the whole idea behind resilient enemies is just fucking annoying, to begin with, especially with the melee still bugging and doing no damage occasionally great job beth.
---
I like this new one wasteland, fighting stronger enemies means i can use my 1500 stimpaks and over 50k 5mm for once
---
You would think but these are the people that look up meta on YouTube and cookie cut a build. If they could think for themselves this problem wouldn't exist in the first place.
---
OK, now quote a line where I whine or bitch. And on a side note: You have obviously no idea why people use online forums.
---
Food, warmth, housing... (/s)
---
Im 100% we wont see any rebalancing in near future
---
It's fucking awesome, right. I haven't really noticed any substantial added difficulty either, took out a Grafton and Flatwoods monster at LVL 100 each just as easy as when they were peaking 40, I think the Flatwoods might have been higher but I only encountered him once before, I was surprised asf when it showed up today again.
---
Hopefully this just weeds out the complainers and this sub won't be a whinefest.
---
I wonder if the stationary bike gives a buff now too?
---
As a semi-new player, how the shit does stealth commando work? Shouldn't it be impossible to continuously get the sneak attacks, considering you're firing in full auto and the enemies could surely see and or hear you? Thanks for any help (:
---
I've got not a single issue. The daylie ops are cool and a little more challenging, but I've almost done it solo to elder (40 seconds late)
---
Agreed. One or the other would have been manageable, but not both changes at the same time.
---
Again, I got x3 star legendary Sniper, Combat Shotgun and an Assault Rifle.... All are x2 shots with varying other abilities. My focus was sneak bonus damage + maximum damage per shot so I could save on ammo and drop tough enemies quickly before they snapped my puny stealth suit character in half.
---
Now they're all out putting about 1/3 their original damage, at best.
---
How are lower level players without legendary weapons and little ammo supposed to get by?
---
I actually helped a level 23 guy defend a workshop from a wave a gouls an hour or so ago. When I arrived, he was going at them with a pipe pistol and swarmed. I'm guessing he ran out of ammo for his other guns. I came in just in time to save his ass, but I still had to unload a full x25 round clip from my assault rifle into one goul who was smacking the crap out of him.... A goul he already plugged with multiple rounds into.
---
Before the patch, it would have been easy to swoop in to save the day and be a hero. Now I'm gimped like I'm back at level 5 and barely made a difference.
---
I wouldnt max whats rads. 1 point is sufficient.
---
It will not stop the rads of a nuke zone even paired with rad shield and ss armor. Dont waste your points man
---
I had a lovely little 1 star anti armor western revolver, it was trash for fighting anything above level 15-20 but it felt really good one shotting things with that big boom it made. Looks like my Dirty Harry days are over for now.
---
Because Bethesda obviously fucked up. Not by nerfing in this patch, but that they never intended that particular build to produce that much damage. It was essentially a glitch and now it has been fixed.
---
That would be my best guess, my friend who went in pure melee was getting random ammo, while my friend who went in using a Gatling laser was getting 5mm ( makes since, doubt all enemies would drop fusion cores ) we were just get the bots down to low hp and letting the melee take care of them, either way it’s something that should be addressed for that one since the whole point is to help you recoup some ammo used.
---
Learn to build round camps. There’s an old YouTube video by a guy named Jug that teaches you how to make these really easily. There’s also a lot of variety once you learn some building tricks such as the rug glitch, floating items, sinking items, the flamethrower glitch to merge items, building underground camps, using interactable items to warp people through walls, using power armor to make things float, etc. There’s so much to learn regarding building, but you gotta do research and then just practice for days
---
I like the update so far, but it is legit killing my durability on my weapons.
---
I'm mostly unfazed. There's New Stuff so I'm happy about that. There are certain growing pains I'm affected by too but for the most part my play style hasn't changed any aside from enemies being tankier and hitting harder- the latter I'm not actually that bothered by since I am now up to &gt;100 of both normal and super stimpacks and oh my God the chemist backpack can't even save me send help
---
They're definitely very nice indeed. I've 2 fully upgraded so far and one rank to go with the agility perk.
---
 I'm still torn on which perk to take for the 6th slot (it's between reboot, sprinter or the absorb one) but I'm loving what rads maxed out as that just repairs me on the move without needing to find an arch and I can basically move around with a near total disregard for radiation.
---
The survival chem perk is highly useful too, thats an instant reset on the hunger and thirst bars and disease cure into the bargin. Claws back a nice chunk of aid weight.
---
I love my 3 star bloodied faster swing speed cultist dagger!
---
Goes so great with my character's silent hill nurse aesthetic. 
---
Why it pains me that its little more than a French tickler now.
---
I plead that Bethesda next look into rebalancing pistols and Daggers to make the perk investment more balanced to their Deathclaw gauntlet equivelants.
---
P.s. Her name is Lisa.
---
I know right? "Oh no I can't 1 shot all the enemies bethesda you ruined my game" lol
---
Players became weaker and enemies became stronger. Great, right? Well not really. There are no real meaningful "rewards" for killing enemies in this game. 
---
Could this force more teams? Sure. But there is no shared proximity experience in teams. And despite the nerfs people with "broken" weapons are still killing enemies in 1 hit.
---
I ran an adrenal instigating character and enemies still took two punches to kill until adrenaline started working. Now I am having to hit enemies 3-4 times as a melee character while they unload miniguns and other automatics into me, which was already a problem when I could 1-2 shot them. Is it unplayable? No. But with there being no real reward to grinding experience I can't call it enjoyable.
---
That’s why I really don’t understand all the rage whiners. In two days some Youtuber’s going to have a whole new set of optimized builds and desirable weapons which everyone will flock out to duplicate as closely as possible so they can continue to swagger around the waste land as if they somehow earned that power.
---
Preston 3.0*
---
You can only get one rate reward per day if I'm not wrong.
---
It could be your ability to earn rewards possibly. But I think the location and things will change for everyone same time.
---
Meaning let's say at daily reset it all changes(faction, location, mutation) but you got elder that morning and got elder you can't get elder until the next morning. I hope this is not the case. I hope reward and daily share the same reset like settler daily where I can turn it in 15 minutes before the universal reset then turn it in again after.
---
The update would have been fine if weapon damage was doubled across the board.
---
The fact they didn't make it so molerates and other trash enemies weren't bullet sponges is so fucking pathetic, I have 0 hope in anything betheseda does anymore.
---
Thanks man! Appreciate it. So what would be the best option to rank up, I guess SPECIAL stat cards?
---
I have an alt that does that. As a fellow stringellow, Here's some options:
---
What I found viable:
---
First try:
---
Stealth Commando, BUT... an Instigating Gauss rifle as primary (Rifleman perk maxed, everything else commando) weapon and a Vampire's full-auto weapon (explosive is a major bonus) I have both radium and handmade. Both kinda suck, not fast enough. A vampire's pump or combat shotgun is a better option for max health regen. The shotgun is such a powerful Vampire weapon, it's a stimpack machine. It won't kill anything effectively, but heals incredibly well.   It lets you get away and reduce the enemy to regain stealth for the gauss when you get mobbed.  Most of the time I can get through with just the gauss, headshots are 1400 (in stealth) and 700 on body shots.  Never have to do more than double tap normally. If you get a three star, you kill everything else and then sneak up and headshot him. 2 headshots properly spaced is enough (unless, bugs...). Criticals are specatcular.
---
Another sniper alt:
---
Stealth heavy gunner (I know...).  Once OP Quad Explosive harpoon gun (amazignly good long range weapon with flechettes) as a sniper, and an Vampire's  MG-42 explosive light machine gun as a close in weapon is unbeatable in most non-end game arenas.
---
It is? My understanding was that no matter what you only needed one? They stack?
---
One of my characters runs a TS/25/DRWR/ Gatling laser, and a AA/25/ Gatling laser and I’ve been shredding everything. Bloodied is definitely not a requirement to kill things. Most people just have to tweak their builds. High leveled players that are struggling, should really post their builds on here. Maybe some of the players on the reddit can help them tweak their builds. I suspect a lot of players have too many QOL perks and it’s hurting their damage numbers.
---
No no. It's beneficial to the players. Hotfix tomorrow.
---
Solid effort bro, that's no easy feat.
---
Bloodied builds have never interested me, I have never seen the fun in being overpowered, but on the edge of dying if a random enemy smacks me with a shovel. Ok, the 'one shot' remark was a little  bit of hyperbole on my part, apologies if that offended you. But people complaining they now have to work a little harder does come over as a little annoying to those players that have always done good, but not outstanding damage in fights, hearing 'Oh my god! No more 1000 point damage hits! I only get 130 now, which means I have to hit 8 times now, oh this game is awful!'  When the other player holding a shotgun is used to putting half a dozen shots in hasn't noticed much in their playstyle at all.
---
Yeah but if you're doing gun bashes be aware of how much damage yours in particular does because lol I sure did fail to knock out a few enemies when trying to bash with the troubleshooters tesla rifle I brought because they weren't at exactly 1hp and apparently I have weak elbows
---
What damage I have to repair maybe 1-2 pieces of armour about once a month and I tanked sbq 3 times yesterday, my pa lasts forever without perks?
---
Well I wouldn’t even know where to start, I’ve not exploited it myself. I just had a nice player tell me that he could take stuff from my vendor
---
Nope!
---
The big reason they did this nerf is to shrink the power gap between builds and weapons; no more 7k damage bloody builds. They had to give the queen a huge health buff because people were killing her too fast. I'm hoping they can do an enemy rebalance now that there's a more reasonable damage range of players.
---
I stopped switching to a melee weapon after a few times, bashing proved to be much faster. So couldn't tell for sure.
---
With regular ranged weapons + bashing I got the correct ammo. Also, robots brought down in HP by me and finished off by another player, gave the correct ammo for the ranged weapon I used on it.  
---
(NOTE: this reply is about other ranged weapons, and not the Fancy Shotgun)
---
I've mostly run past the enemies since I can't do much with an Comando build, had later on finished it with 1 friend at 7:06
---
I run. 15 - 3 - 4 - 4 - 9 - 7 - 14 but I'm heavy / melee main and use  lvl 1 rifle perks for fun once in a while, it doesn't work great on rifle but good enough. 7 point seem like the sweet spot for an off stat , though legendary perks change this now
---
Thanks for this reply, I’m starting to fear my english is kind of wrong by the level of aggression i receive here for my posts.
---
I’ve been using full secret service, but I never seem to have issues with poison damage anyway... thanks for the help man! Think I’ll invest into a SPECIAL stat
---
Tbh it would make sense.  I just run them for the ss armor.  I’ve farmed a few decent chest pieces that way
---
Ah been experiencing the same  ow that I think a out it. I wonder if plague walker might start to shine brighter in this situation.
---
Yea it's only a few extra bullets not that bad in terms of game play but I'm a numbers person and to see the numbers change that dramatically is kind of a bummer
---
I run the same build. It kinda sucks, but playable.
---
You actually believe that two shotting an enemy with a sniper rifle was never intended and that sniping should be a 30 second battle of an enemy walking left and right trying to figure out where it's being shot from? I mean if you believe that sure, fine. I can't prove you wrong because you're already assuming what someone else meant to do in the first place.
---
Rinse and repeat 400 times to level up. Very intended fun lol.
---
What build do younuse? I went with
---
Max ammo smith
---
Max fallow through
---
Lvl 2 taking one for the team (maxing this next)
---
1 in funky duds
---
1 in whats rads
---
Havent unlocked slot six, im lvl 274
---
see the majority of people complimenting and praising this patch are exactly what you describe.  Optimized builds with above adequate weaponry and defense.  Most people don't pay that way.  If they need more content for the end game whales then do be it, but don't punish everyone to appease a small minority
---
I did the same only spent 150 on charisma though.
---
I am really annoyed with it.
---
Not everyone shared kills like you, wish they all would have but no
---
1 shot from tse fixer to head vs 50lvl glowing mongrel in forest, sneaked with vats. And im a *food* build how try hards call it, alot of weight perks, only 3 commando perks, rank 1 each, bloody mess rank 2 and nerd rage rank 1, and tank killer. Yeah, whole magazine. It might be 2 shots with other weapons
---
Yeah, cool bruh.  You can totally respec in this game in 10 minutes.  Go home meathead.
---
You make a valid point, and each thing you mentioned is infinitely more important than this game, but I can not purchase any of the above mention things with a Microsoft balance. I wouldn't of purchased all of the ranks if I didn't have a hefty Microsoft balance to play with.
---
I have a scortched killing handmade, a whole 12 lbs 1 star, that I've been carrying for way too long. But it was nice to see a challenge like "kill 10 scortched", pop over to the airport, and whack 10 scortched with 1 .556 each. OH well.
---
But thats the thing I haven't even gotten 1
---
Melee dealing last blow gives you random ammo. Every team I was on no one would use melee but me. But I would get every Ammo type. Surprised after 3 daily ops I got all ranks. And I still ran in as a bloodied build with no protection and just my death claw gauntlet. Best time was third time and got 730 with only two other ppl
---
I use shotgun/sniper, not the most efficient but it’s fun! Does follow through work? I’ve heard it may be bugged... I think I might put into strength for shotgun perks/carry weight! I’ve only got 350 coins or so to use.
---
Hooray for the buy/sell stuff daily challenge, I guess...
---
Both the SFE and Perk Loadout Manager mods have now been updated to be compatible with Update 22.
---
Aaaaaaand I'm dumb as hell. God damn it.
---
Also a friend claims to have gotten 2 today
---
Same, only had one elder completion and 2 2nd tier and no new plans.
---
Maybe you have something at 0 caps price
---
Definitely not
---
Cool, I'm not offended, it's just there is so much more to a Bloodied build than people think, a fair amount of maintenance. My issue is sneak, something is wrong with Covert Operative... A Bloodied sneak build is doubly hard to maintain, not only do you have like 10% health but you also need to walk at virtual snails pace. Now that sneak is crap, many people don't know where to go with it all I guess.
---
I think it's important to remember that every build/every player is now having to shoot the enemies 2-3 times more to kill them.
---
This is having a really noticeable affect on players below level 50 who don't have complete builds and on the slow firing builds such as non automatic rifles.
---
Players who use fast firing weapons such as heavy guns/automatic rifles aren't feeling the pinch as much. The good news is that you can convert your build over to automatic rifles (9 perk cards into commando instead of rifleman) or just wait for the inevitable damage buff that will be incoming.
---
You definitely don't need to go bloodied, you can try furious/anti-armor/two-shot+explosive(two shot lowers your hit chance btw). Or try instigating and aim for their head.
---
There's two problems. 1. all enemies have more HP due to level scaling and 2. you got nerfed. Even if all you had was two of the weapon damage perk cards you got nerfed. 
---
Anecdote time. I maxed out ammo factory thinking I'll prime my weapons since I can make so much more ammo. I can craft 900 50 caliber with ammo factory and ammo smith per violet flux. 
---
Pre-patch I would have done it in a heartbeat. Now, with how many shots things take, I'm not sure if it's worth the extra farming I have to do. How insane is that? 
---
All we can hope is Bethesda will either up our damage or reduce HP scaling on mobs to being it into a bit better balance. I don't mind farming for good stuff but if I have to private server nuke whitespring every other day to farm enough to make flux for ammo....
---
Thx mate
---
Lol I don't care I'm just saying that people are lucky they didnt recieve bans/suspensions for exploiting/cheating in that game.
---
Take my upvote.. yeah I'm loving the new updates as well.. I kinda wish they'd make it even harder to be honest. Fallout 1 and 2 and tactics were brutal, the wasteland isn't supposed to be easy its suppose to be dangerous and deadly.
---
I"m very used to not even bothering to play during patch day - for any online game.   And waiting for the hotfix the next day or two.
---
I was pleasantly surprised at the quality.
---
Played for about 3 hours yesterday - and 0 issues.
---
Was the event over? If you die right after the events over then it defaults back to you dropping your junk I've seen this many times with the queen fight after shes dead someone dies while looting her and their junk is left there.
---
Hot dog! I hope it's anything but resiliant today so I have a chance for elder haha! Was a bit ruff honestlyeven though I ran melee... shouldn't have run with bloodied then but oh well!
---
Fallow through works just fine for me.
---
Part of the problem is they changed damage calculations and did the one wasteland schtick at the same time. Like both are good, but now we do less damage on often higher level enemies. So now its 2-4 shots with my two shot sneak build, my durability is terrible now. 
---
This may improve now that can narrow down things that need to be buffed now that it is additive and they can see whats underperforming, we shall see.
---
It's totally alt un-friendly.
---
I have 3 chars that I actively use most days. It's rare that more than 1 of them will be levelled-up in a day ... actually, during the last season I intentionally made sure that at the end of my session at least 1 of them was set-up for a guaranteed level-up the next day. I'm pretty sure I will never max out more than a couple perks per character.
---
I get the desire to do this to try and avoid people cheesing the system, but if its tied to a character then introduce other ways to earn additional perk coins. Gold bullion maybe?
---
For me I used my lever action for trash mobs and faster weapons for boss fights like the plasma rifle with the flamer barrel
---
I don't think the issue is that bloodied was going to be bad after the update. It's still one of the highest damage builds at the moment but the issue is that other builds/weapons got nerfed that didn't really need too. A lot of guns that weren't really used before hand have become basically useless amongst others with this nerf. Many of the changes have altered the scope and basically funneled users to playing a certain way. Many pistol, melee builds are cooked now because of it, making it far more difficult than what it's worth.I love that there is a bit of challenge to the game but the main issue is there are only a handful of guns that don't make the game feel more than tedious now.
---
Just to clarify, I don't hate the challenge that one wasteland presents but more of the issue it raised with other builds/guns that haven't been considered with the new approach to shifting the gameplay
---
The names plissken..
---
https://youtu.be/ACXOhRIe-s4
---
lol you all have decent weapons and equipment and assumingly optimized builds. I have spent good time doing the same but I'm not gonna sit idly by while the people who are being negatively affected by this get shafted. They made the game more of a chore to play all around. No amount of additions of new content will save it if they keep taking one step forward and two back.
---
I've been doing the run all day, and all but one of my runs has been elder rank. And I still haven't seen a single rare item
---
Nah I had died a good 5 minutes before it ended, I only noticed when they took my stuff after while I was collecting things. I had seen other people’s junk bags lying around throughout the event too but just figured people had been dumping the shitty legendaries they’d picked up
---
That, or, you know, the fact that there's like ten billion different specs we can have, to say nothing of our gear and all its effects..... but hey, yeah, clearly I'm just lying. /s
---
I feel the stimpak pain lol I moved a bunch to my alt a while ago and still ended up selling shit tons of them too. I'm loving it so far though, im ready for the next op. Literally ust finished this one with elder timing. Curious to see what the next will be.
---
I'll try to answer a few.
---
-Pipe pistol/rifle aren't really meh, as they stack with both pistol and rifle perks (not sure if the recent patch affected this but I assume it didn't) 
---
- yes weapons and armor max at either 45 or 50 but either is considered max level just the same 
---
- angry turtle, captainoob, and lone vault wonderer are all youtubers you can get more information from. Lvw made a comprehensive armor guide, etc.
---
- pistols in general are less sought after but also many of us long timers have a pistol character in our roster, too. 
---
- I can agree with 85% of what you said, so yeah you understand for the most part
---
My advice.  Switch from rifle to commando perks and try to get a decent bloodied combat rifle or handmade 
---
Use a automatic receiver. And play like it’s semi auto.   You can use trigger control to only shoot 1 bullet.   I use vats on head and kill most enmities in 2-3 shots in very very fast semi auto fire
---
I switched to a bloodied heavy build just prior to patch 22 go live.   But I still use my bloodied combat rifle to stealth kill allot of mobs.  Even with out commando perks
---
What's this about crafting them? I didn't know you could do that
---
This is my planned build. The update is still downloading for me haha. I used some of the legendary perks to boos some places where I was lacking, and will try to max out luck so that I can avoid some damage.
---
[There ya go :)](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=d433daa&amp;d=sd2sp2so2sb2p00pc2eh2ck0ce0i12ib4ir2s12a72a80a04a30l12lu1lt2l71x03xe0xl0su0eu0x60x83la2lg1x70&amp;n=Bloodied%20Gauss%20Shotgun)
---
I tried some vanguard pieces for a while and they were... underwhelming (at least for my chars/playstyle). It's all fine and dandy to have a high DR, but when you actually need the DR because you get shot your health will plummet and with it the DR bonus, leading to even more damage and so on. I very much prefer -15% flat from X now. 
---
Anyway, I wish you luck with your crafting attempts, I hope you get some perfect 3star pieces :-)
---
That's great when you run rifle builds but every build was nerfed 40-80% of their damage, including melee builds. I take several bullets just to get to one enemy. When I was hitting them once or twice (power attacks with 60% adrenaline) I was going through stims like crazy, now I need to hit some up to 4 times while they unload into me. With 650 hours farming the perfect gear and build I liked, this probably shouldn't be applauded.
---
Isnt quite what I was expecting.   Given the provable difficulties in mounting a headless monsters head I would have thought that making its arm into a lamp or umbrella stand would have been ideal.
---
Think those old school elephant leg umbrella holders or ash trays.
---
I definitely don't agree with that lol enemies would just go right back to being squishy. No thanks
---
The entire game is ruined constant bullet sponge enemies are not fun having to use all your ammo for encounters that offer no reward, beth never listens to any feedback its pathetic
---
I dont need to one shot everything I'm a bloodied stealth  cammando and I used my 10mm auto pistol most of the time (unless in private world) and only use my B2525 fixer on queen and really strong enemies, but this nerf hit us alot harder than you think. I had an almost 90% reduction in damage
---
Agreed. Hopefully they fix it. Doesn’t seem to be working as intended.
---
Finally! I don't know how many times I have taken the wrong turn in Harpers Ferry trying to find the vendor in the back alley.
---
You know what is a minor update I would thoroughly appreciate?? How about when you’re allies with Crater and Foundation, they STOP talking shit to you every time you’re around?! Is that too much to ask?  A little gratitude for all those water cooled bone saws, assassinations, and radio vacuum tubes?  I mean, seriously.  Should Ward still be keeping and eye on me?  We all know you are just cranky from missing out on your naps guy.
---
I'd advise giving junkies a go. I'm a rifleman first and foremost, and I've found the junkies gauss rifle to be pretty decent damage dealer post patch. One or two shot most mobs, I mean. 
---
I do acknowledge that getting your hands on a junkies gauss may not be a quick job, though. You'd have to vendor hop with a pocket full of caps.
---
That said, if you can get the gun, the penalities from being addicted are not really all that terrible. Most drugs are -1 special to two stats. You can spread the penalities out pretty evenly with the right addictions. With public groups your can always be in a group, so taking the herd mentality mutation (+2 to all specials if you are in a group) pretty easily offsets all of the addiction penalities.
---
Remember to be starving and thirsty when you get high! You'll get addicted faster and it won't take as many drugs.
---
thats probably a good choice :)
---
Yeah can't even craft a legendary one?! Like wtf I have to pervayor up one by luck?
---
Not soon enough!!!
---
Initiate level is crap performance and we both know it.
---
Daily ops has specific rewards. How do you propose obtaining them with your cunning method?
---
I’ve never noticed gold perk cards lol
---
Look up cloudy's mod manager on nexus.
---
You don't even need the mod manager really. Just rename your ini file with the mod changes in it and that SHOULD do it I believe.
---
Does your foosball table have persistent audio after you’re done playing? My buddy has it and we both jumped on it. Afterwards the audio from the foosball game never stopped. We fast traveled, interacted with other audio CAMP items, and died. The sound still haunts me.
---
Also, it’s frigging pinball audio. Now I want a pinball table.
---
Yes.  Happens almost every single time without fail.
---
I even emptied the vast majority of my aid tab and it is still happening.  Other people I play with have this issue as well.
---
Edit: Although it's been happening to me since long before the update.
---
You don't get scrip from cards tho.....
---
So basically  its 4.5X more ammo compared with no perks.
---
"I'm so sad the game isn't easy anymore" lmfao I use a commando build stop crying.
---
Can confirm, having infinite boneshards, glass and wood scraps breaks the game.
---
This update will probably make me stop playing. It's not enjoyable anymore. Everything is bullet sponge now. To be clear my build was not a one-shot everything build... It was balanced, I spent a long time getting my character where I liked it, and I enjoyed playing because of it.
---
These changes aren't a matter of some small tweaks or added challenge. It's just grind and bullet sponge.
---
I'll see how the next few weeks shape up.. see if they tweak things a little, but without that I'm probably just leaving
---
They don’t want stealth because it’s meant to be a quick charge in guns blazing bun fight with you being swamped , that’s it’s purpose and how it was intentionally designed. So it’s a take it or leave it , I’m stealth commando myself , if there wasn’t the piercing gaze players like me would just play hide, seek and shoot in the head WHICH IS NOT WHAT THIS IS FOR
---
You know what problem is?
---
F76 isn’t hard, never was
---
Even with the new update it’s not hard or challenging
---
I'm level 97. This isn't even like back at level 20, because even back then, if you were running low on resources, needed to repair or just needed to chill a bit, you could go back to the lower level spots to farm resources again. 
---
Or build a camp in a low level area so you could relax a bit while crafting without the worry of a deathclaw or scortchbeast tearing shit up.
---
But you can't do that because now you got level 50 eyebots nuke lasering your base or level 50 mole rats teleporting through your roof and biting your ass from behind.
---
I'll have to fk'n move to Foundation and live with the settlers just to get a moment's peace.....
---
.... Oh, frigging Ward just spotted me. Now I have to go find his damn desk fan some raider stole.
---
Right .. sorry .english is my 4th language
---
What? You use exactly what I said in the first part of my comment? Awesome. But I was talking about the problems with a melee/armor build. One that actually tanks hits.
---
Ohhhhhh noooo. This just made me realize: I wish I would have worked on the killing enemies with different weapons challenges. Have only done the rifle ones, fuuuuuuu. RIP all those atoms I'll never get without redoing my perk cards for each one. I hate myself and Bethesda right now. lol I'm so bummed.
---
Holy run on sentence use a period for Tods sake!  (Good point though)
---
I'd say no I got 12 fluids 33 hard mass and 20 glows yesterday?
---
A radroach that isn't "glowing" shouldn't require *any* ammo to kill. A standard ghoul should just require a few shots, not an entire magazine. I'm pretty sure no one asked for yearling radstags to require 7+ shots while stealthed to kill.
---
I'm all for a raise in the difficulty of the game, but balance doesn't come from lowering weapon damage across the board **on top of** raising health and armor stats on every enemy. That's poor design and hearkens back to Fallout 3 when anything above a certain level took 15 magazines of plasma ammo and 10 stimpacks to mow through.
---
Do it once and do it right. 
---
Edit: do the ops once and get elder reward.
---
Sure, which is of course why I say 'Bethesda' as a blanket term as opposed to the poor boots on the ground who are likely just being given marching orders. That said, there was plenty of time to run some balance passes, as it was in testing for a month and we were warning about these issues from week 1.
---
It is still used more while a actually playing and not while I am sitting in my camp, but I do see your point.
---
I am so pleased with the update. Went to bed last night and thought to myself, “let’s see what the fo76 community thinks. Surely everyone will be happy about it.”  Boy was I wrong. I have come to realize this subreddit is just a complaint bulletin board and not just that, but absurd complaints at that.
---
Daily ops is really poor but apart from that it seems great so far. Not noticed any new bugs or performance issues as of yet. Seems pretty solid.
---
Hmm 🤔 def sounds like a one-off bug, because I can't get mine to replicate it. I would suggest not just storing it but scraping it, then rebuilding a new one and see if it resolves the Audio but issue.
---
Of all the things to waste money on, my god. If you're that desperate to waste your money at least give it to me.
---
I reckon you are likely correct, as well as making Repair Kits actually temping when it's that or farming all day for Ballistic Fiber just to keep an armor set repaired. The main issue for the future of the game is I really don't see many newbies sticking with the journey to 50; there was already a rough spot mid way that was miserable to get past, as enemies got tankier and you didn't have a solid build yet, and now the entire journey is that period.
---
It depends on which area. In the forest enemies should absolutely scale to him but in others there is still a minimum and maximum level for that area.
---
I have had the exact same issue since patch 21. Every single time I try to join someone else’s game Fallout 76 freezes and says “Cannot retrieve friends list. 
---
Forces me to quit the game to do anything.
---
no worries, opens up for some bonus perks. I've been running this build for the past year, worked well although I guess it could use some tweaking:  
---

---
Upvoting you buddy! Don’t understand why you would get downvoted for what you said.
---
Yeah you HAVE to min-max your build not to not be wasting resources every fight!
---
Which is a good thing since us PA users can‘t rely on backpacks or legendary armor.
---
Ha! Wee bit of an insult to Snake tbh!
---
Everything you just said. Everything. My condolences.  I am literally beside myself in disbelief.  I had just finally leveled up to 45 and finally felt like I was getting somewhere in the story.  I started to feel confident going into higher level areas and looked forward to testing my mettle against some higher enemies.  But last night I put up my game feeling defeated beyond words.  I went to every easy place I could think and blew through my ammo and after 3 spots my regular armor was completely shot.  I died 4 times and used about 10 stimpaks so I wouldn't die an extra 3 more times in various easy areas.  Against liberators outside the vault, mole rats near water treatment and a pack of wild mongrels.  The mirelurk house in Summerville.  What?!??  These were one shot kills before.  I'm hoping, beyond hope, that once I get past lvl 50 and I can use new weapons that this will change somehow. But right now, I'm like: 😱😱😱
---
It was very satisfying (and surprisingly time consuming) to clear out the majority of them.  Did I maybe scrap one I cared about?  Who knows but with the new balance to baddies levels, I level quite a bit faster (level 182) and got almost 2 levels just doing some random running around yesterday.
---
As a man I can confidently tell you I also don't read the instructions
---
Haha nothing but love this time around
---
The OP is suggesting not doing them, even once. My question remains.
---
As a bloodied stealth commando, the part of the update that has affected my build the most is actually the fix for concentrated fire. The damage calc and one Wasteland hasn't actually changed much, other than taking an extra shot to kill things and making the big stuff actually challenging.
---
Yeah
---
Gun bashing costs more ap and takes longer than changing to a melee weapon and swing!
---
So much this.
---
I have a level 60, using a far from optimised stealth build because I'm nowhere near having all the perks and legendaries I would need.
---
But now with the damage nerf every fight takes considerably longer, and that's basically the only change. Its not harder to kill things, it's just tedious.
---
Can I complain about your usage of the word hear?
---
I don’t think 1 perk coin is asking too much.
---
Thanks for your experience! Good to know, so I know what to look out for. If push comes to shove I still have a suit of Excavator power armor in my inventory, but I really don't want to use that except in emergencies.
---
i guess my biggest problem is that i play this game to relax, and the fact that now i have to waste huge amounts of ammo just to kill shit that doesnt need this buff is really infuriating. like, okay, level match the ghouls and super mutants and whatever. but what the fuck is the point of giving me a level thirty fucking radroach that takes me six shots to kill point fucking blank. that's unnecessary and ridiculous. theyre meant to be shit enemies, they don't need this bullshit buff. maybe that's a stupid hill to die on, maybe im a whiny piss baby, like okay. but some of this shit just seems like mega unnecessary. i know they said theyd make improvements based on suggestions, but it just makes the game more infuriating to play as a low level character that doesnt have any set build in place yet.
---
I’m a full health PA heavy weapons build and it maybe takes 1 full second extra to kill mobs even at a higher level but I actually appreciated the damage they were doing to me. West Tek was actually more fun yesterday for this reason. I am 110% happy with the update.
---
You knew what OP meant, tho.....
---
Rofl!!!! Guess I hit a nerve
---
That's a really nice build although Bullet Shield is almost useless when you're using PA. You could replace that with Blocker or Lock and Load
---
What kind of build do you run? Seems most complaints are from semi-auto users. Definitely some balance changes needed to bring those builds up, but for me personally my main has seen little change other than getting to fight lvl 50 enemies in the lower lvl areas now (full health Junkie's heavy gunner PA build) .
---
Honestly. I saw posts last night calling out “typical Bethesda bug” because they couldn’t kill the robots in daily ops with their guns. Swear sometimes people need to stop being so stupid and just read what it says.
---
I might be wrong, but I think that’s only during public events, which are free to fast travel too. Those are the ones that have an ! in the hex icon on the map.
---
"OkAy kArEN" rofl
---
Sounds fun!
---
\*Deinstalls\*
---
Radiation Rumble is a Public Event.
---
I could be wrong, but I think you have a 40% chance to get a rare item the first time you complete it under 8 mins. This only counts the first time you do it. So if you dont manage to get a rare reward the first time, you will have to try again tomorrow. The first time you try, you have a 40% chance. After that, the chance is 0%. Again, I could be wrong about this, but this is just how i think it works after seeing some posts about the same thing happening to others.
---
If I look at my tv screen in game I see a reflection of outside trees etc, but there is only a wall there to reflect......
---
I played for about an hour and a half  last night and I am really enjoying these new perks.  I had a ton of cards to scrap so I was able to level a couple of them up.  I still have a ton of cards to open so that's cool.  I went with the sneak, legendary strength, perception, agility, ammo factory, and luck.  I don't feel like I will be running into weight issues any more.  I also did not really notice a big drop in damage.  Running bloodied commando still killing stuff pretty easy.  I should have more time to play tonight and I am looking forward to it.
---
Oh no dont get me wrong, this update is bullshit, they should have held off one one wasteland until after the damage change to sort out damage and weapon durability.
---
Doing both at one was a poor decision in their part.
---
Two shot is absolute dog shit. Anti armor is better. *Anything* is better than two shot, ever since they nerfed the shit out of that one too. And I can see melee being viable as well, especially with this new weight bench. Hell, that weight bench is my new favourite camp item until they nerf that too. But what with all these damage reductions and enemies being your level it’s so much harder now. Builds like yours weren’t hit as hard, because they weren’t optimised war machines like my build was.
---
I went through 4 of my characters today and took them for a walk around fissure prime and up to ABT here are my views from fighting of normal mobs and SBQ’s
---
Shotgunner .. not really noticeable 
---
Bloodied unarmed .. still 1 hitting most things (1200 damage seen)
---
Bloodied Commando, maybe half a mag difference against large mobs
---
Junkies Heavy Gunner.. noticed a difference against Leg SB but not too bad
---
To add to this, last I checked on the pts, urban scout and forest scout are considered different armor types.
---
Refined? 
---
The game mechanics are less refined than the original Super Mario Bros...  It's a shit game and I honestly don't know why I still play... But I know I'll be back.
---
It’s an 80 percent chance to get a rare reward. You probably were in the 20 percent :( what platform are you playing on? I have the hood and I could part with it. I don’t have the outfit, but it’s something.
---
The cow gives fertiliser.
---
Actually not . Have no clue what you are referring to.
---
There was a specific circumstance this happened last time, something the vendor owner player did. Can anyone remember? Might be useful now
---
5 tick blood? How did you get so much?
---
I know the feeling 😆
---
I hadn't died in months and I got downed 3 times in daily ops. It was a refreshing change to have some challenge again!!
---
Disconnected 4x yesterday.  Last time this happened was months ago, anyone else seeing this?
---
yeah ik i want the plans to make the pen for it
---
I feel like they have been heading in that direction for most of the year. Don't forget just how hard Covid has made development when they're all stuck working remotely. This year has been a dumpster fire, but I think Bethesda have managed to pluck FO76 from it.
---
Grafton is so much more fun now!  Somehow when I fast traveled in for a SM Horde event, there were fifteen of the big green chungus boys on the roof of the police department. It was actually a bit challenging but so much XP, lol.
---
For now yes. Developers hate stealth builds.
---
As far as I can tell this is a me problem but any issues with hits not registering when firing full auto?  My commando is taking 1 or 2 more shots to kill things as expected but only if I tap on the trigger basically using my weapons like a rifleman.  Works fine.
---
Hold the trigger down though and only like every third shot is registering as damage.  Basically it's taking me a full mag to kill a high super mutant when firing in auto, or like 3 to 5 shots when tapping the trigger.  Tried multiple public servers with the same results.  Private servers seemed fine though.
---
yeah its confirmed one of my friends had this exact shit happen i removed the door to my little shop and put a wall there its going to be like that till Bethesda fixes their fucking shit
---
Uh, the Elder strat for this op is to sit on the uplinks for the boost signal speed bonus while tanking the enemy fire. HFR vampire weapons allow you to do just this. And with the Ammo Factory LP ammo isn’t nearly an issue. Stand in one place and get free heals off an unkillable enemy then rush B. You’ll have your Valley Galleria signs in no time.  
---
Unless of course you’re too stupid to read a line of text with instructions.
---
I hate how true that is lol
---
Yeah not sure where this idea is coming from but I’m a full health heavy gunner as well and I don’t notice a difference hardly at all. Maybe takes 1-2 seconds longer to kill an enemy. It seems like bloodied builds are the only ones feeling any pain from them this tbh.
---
It’s not a fallout game anymore
---
I chucked a quad 44. revolver I had on me into the old scripper the other day; I'll never need ol' ivory grip and its 7 hour long reload again, sadly.
---
Sigh
---
Ah, good to hear.
---
There are people who are now arguing that a sniper should have to hit an enemy 9 times to kill it and that it's a good thing. Discussing things seems pretty pointless with people like that. I mean I have bought Fallout 1st but I can't understand the mindset of defending this. Although I am probably going to stop paying for it today, just because this update didn't really add anything to keep me playing.
---
Some things definitely needed a nerf, but instead they re-calculate how damage is dealt while raising the enemies HP. It was a bad way to go about it. There are actually builds now that can't kill enemies in a reasonable amount of time (10 shots from a sniper, come on).
---
Yeah, scrolling through here it seems like I'm one of the only people who isn't having any trouble with this patch.
---
Takes a few more bullets for me and that it.
---
Had a little trouble with the final boss of the daily op, but I was by myself and didn't expect that beauty to come running at me.
---
Still, been seeing people say lvl 50 molerats are killing them and so far from my experience I'd need to put down the pad and make a coffee for thst to happen.
---
Not explicitly but op has a point that daily ops is not worth repeating once you get max rewards for the day. 
---
So my answer to you is that we do it once and get max reward (hopefully).  :)
---
did you really spend atoms on that? man seems like a waste
---
No No not since the patch as I've often gotten the glitch over the past year &amp; is not limited to quad weapons iirc,  As example for a week once had my quad Single Action Revolver with like 500 .44 in it, fitting it was named the Hold Fast as in like it was a final stand weapon but the stand never ended as it had 500 rounds in it lol.
---
It's a strange bug when you switch from a heavy weapon to say a rifle an end up crap load of ammunition in it, another example switched from a gatling gun to my trusty combat rifle an had 400 rounds in it was like ohh not reloading for awhile I guess.
---
I guess a few more are starting to notice it a bit more now.
---
I'll have to try it on a private server when I get home I know I died yesterday during an event and didn't drop my junk.  Hopefully this isn't a wide spread bug...
---
I saw her coming and just laughed out loud at how fucked I was. Thank Atom for Vampire's weapons
---
i die a little inside knowing someone really spent 125 usd on that
---
If you are playing in a team wouldnt it be a good idea to have someone with a ripper? Ya know because its a fully auto melee weapon?
---
The problem i have is bethesda hasn't acknowledged it and it didnt say it im game that I wouldn't be able to share perks. I knew what the legendary perks where but never actually read post that it didn't work the way it should. And I shouldn't have to go to a third party site to find this out.
---
Yeah there's not a single Perk card that is specifically good for my stealth character. Ammo? I already have the regular cards that give me plenty.
---
I'm using the special cards for Perception and Agility so I can use more of the normal cards.... Which is good still.... But the unique ones are a bit disappointing.
---
Nah, my hunting rifle is level 10 and was doing ok for a lot of stuff. my combat rifle is level 20. Armor is pretty meh but I was doing ok until this.
---
Less ammo rewards, no unique daily ops rewards..
---
I was a rifleman/commando, I tossed my tse lever action rifle in my stash box so i'm  strictly commando now (tse handmade, be 25/25 handmade, b 25/25 the fixer) so let's see how we roll. To the be the fixer I accidentally scripted yesterday.... so long friend, it was fun while it lasted.
---
I actually went back and did that and it did help a lot. The legendary perks did make it more bearable as well.
---
???  
---
You’re the ‘OP’. Original Poster. 
---
We all know what you mean when you say ‘scrap cards’.   You get perk coins. That is their ‘scrap value’. 
---
Lewilewi knows that’s what you meant. A single letter typo doesn’t change the meaning of your post.
---
While that sucks, simple solution store your junk before you go out in public
---
I'm enjoying it so far. Much more challenging but also rewarding!!
---
Got 3 great drops yesterday from random mobs so I think the scaling is nice.
---
Daily ops are fun and don't seem to be a ridiculous resource drain like the old vault raids.
---
Legendary perks are great but I'm still thinking them over before I drop a ton of points.
---
On Console :( but I would rather have it in game and not 3rd party ap
---
I agree too. I have played 4 times the daily ops today. I don't have melee build but i can complete them under 8 minutes with a group of 3 or 4 players and i am 172 lvl. 
---
I have so many things to do in the game now! Daily ops to find the new items, legendary run and legendary perks!! 
---
Everything is awesome right now. I like the one wasteland update too. 
---
I spent more ammo now but i have better xp, loot and challenging fights.
---
Great direction for the game!
---
Edit
---
From my 4 runs in daily ops i have collect so many ammo!! I don't play with heavy guns and i have 1500 5mm bullets!!
---
Two? Isn’t that too many, sir?
---
I was doing ok with the lvl 10 hunting rifle and a lvl 20 combat rifle and some lvl 5 armor.
---
But if I have to keep upgrading everything to keep up then we're just in an arms race and man, that gets old.
---
Know that rads isn't as good as it seems you'll still need pa or rad suit in Nuke zones
---
I've been warning people since the beginning of this system being tested but no, obviously I was just a fear monger who wanted to easily one shot everything!
---
No I just wasn't a selfish prick and knew this would screw over the early game players.
---
It's funny because this was meant to make the game -- or more specifically, certain higher level areas -- more accessible to us sub-50's. Yet now I don't want to leave The Forest for fear of running into radscorpions that would soak up 20 shots from my shotgun (for which I have 3x shotgun damage, not high enough to have the expert ranges I don't think) and live to dismember me. 
---
Why would I bother going to places where the enemies are even harder than that?
---
Honestly I usually only get tick blood in 1/10 ticks...
---
Had a couple hundred sitting in my Microsoft account for months now, so naw I didn't really waste imo. And after I finish all my reviews, if it either helps someone decide to/or not to pursue a particular item they were eyeing and it helps them, then I'm 100% ok with that.
---
I think I managed in 9 minutes, but I'm not an optimized build by any stretch, so it's definitely possible.
---
It does when you have 200 more pounds of space for weapons and whatnot while for the rest of us that is taken up with scrap
---
Do events and take workshops. It’s a common reward.
---
Go in WhiteSprings and find a corner you can 'defend' then attack a bot. Time how long you survive and then try to beat your high score using various weapons/armor combos. 
---
Get whacky outfits or strip naked, turn your mic on public and wander the wastelands ranting like a mad man. Whenever you see another player rush over to them and wildly tell them about the purple alien that is chasing you, or that the mothman really caused the bombs to drop. Then run away zig zagging or doing pirouettes (jump and spin in the air). Everyone love the radiation sickened madman! 
---
In case you didn't know, you can get a trophy for being at Ground Zero when a nuke hits. When you enter a blast zone before the nuke hits, you'll see a radiation symbol on the compass. Go towards it until it starts to spin around and just wait to get melted. Take off armor to avoid it being damaged. 
---
Dont' Starve! Head to vault 76, once there allow your thrist and hunger to bottom out. You can only eat or drink what you find as you slowly make your way back to your camp. 
---
Build a community garden. Take a workshop like The Gorge or Dibney and plant row after row of corn, tato, razorgrain etc. with signs alerting that all are welcome to take as needed. I came across one of these once organically and it was really nifty. 
---
On a semi-related note, I recall a thread here where someone turned their camp into a corn maze, for Halloween. Perhaps you could do something similar.
---
Power armour with AA50 and a vampire fire axe.
---
Its my time to shine baby!
---
Can I nick a chip?
---
forreal, man. big fuck up all the way around.
---
Are you using the whiterun duplication glitch from skyrim, a single player game, and claiming its from ESO?
---
You must be fun at parties, if you ever get invited.
---
Which is a completely different point from OP. OP isn’t saying to run Daily Ops once or until you get the rewards. They’re dying don’t run it at all. 
---
They might update and clarify their point, however.
---
Between me and my partner we both got kicked once. In a three hour play session. We just crashed to home screen. For me it was in watoga I assume because it was loading in the city. For my partner it was while loading in a players camp.
---
But neither of us got the respawn or fast travel bug. So at least that's fixed.
---
\*\*pulls out vampire faster swing speed reduced weight combat knife\*\* still worth it
---
Muh precious.
---
They probably would, but why? It's a game rated for adults, you can dismember people and set them on fire, but can't say fuckbollocks?
---
I totally agree with what you're saying but the OP is a very bizarre apples vs oranges comparison.
---
Microsoft balance? doesn't Microsoft reward you for using bing.com?
---
Same here. Also hopefully it will stay when you move your base. Like you just place down a cellar door wherever and it will take you to your saved instance
---
You can also hide stuff you don’t want to focus on right now via your pip boy
---
The reason why this update was release wasn't to wholly nerf everything, but to make it easier on Bethesda's part by preventing bugs with weapons and make coding easier.
---
If double damage doesnt work for you, they could at least consider buffing the slow rate of fire weapons like the lever action rifle, hunting rifle and pistols, because right now they are being outperformed by full auto rifles.
---
Use your brain. They’re ranged enemies, unkillable by ranged, in a timed mission that requires teammates to stay close to the uplinks to connect faster. Meaning no running off and melee striking or looting shit. How do you do this efficiently? Ignore enemies. How do you not die? Vampire weapons and not sucking like 99% of the people in this thread.  
---
I did this in under 6 minutes (5:36 at the quickest) with ransoms three times in a row, and soloed it in under 8. Spend your time understanding why you suck and how to get better instead of yelling into the void about how professional game developers are terrible because you can’t figure out a simple puzzle.
---
it really should only be implemented for after lvl 50. it’s just too hard for lower level players
---
I'm on ps4 but I'm only looking for the body piece. Trying to make a outfit from a different game. I just did another one just now making 32 ops with no rare reward.
---
Take all of my upvotes
---
Yeah uh you can totally respec in 10 minutes if you are over a certain level and didnt waste every point on useless perks. But i feel like saving some points for things like that didnt cross your mind right?
---
I have to disagree. I run a full-health Stealth Commando in Secret Service armour, and while I notice a clear increase in the amount of ammo my main guns use (AA/+50 limb dmg fixer and Furious explosive Handmade), the only troubles I have are the same things I had trouble with before. The Daily Ops are very tough solo (I can't complete them solo), but they're supposed to be.
---
Praise the lord and pass the ammunition
---
Well that doesn't sound right I've talked to people who have gotten more than 1 rare reward
---
Back? It never got patched! It's been in the game for MONTHS!
---
People like to whine. My junkies explosive commando still rips through enemies
---
Medics is definitely not magic,  also 15% block armor makes all shotguns and weapons with 200 fire rare magic.
---
Two shot and explosive double the effective fire rate for this calculation.  It is also server dependent and 150 to 190 is close enough sometimes (lmg , laser gatling base rate )
---
I didn't either until the set up a different point value for them on the 1st test servers..you would get 15 points for a 3* animated and 6 for a normal 3* ..that leaded to some complicated maths to get the better value. The prod version is simpler and you get to keep animated instead of destroying them all.
---
True. But if it’s loaded then maxing then rank eventually means not having to play the lock pick mini game. Eventually you’ll have enough perk coins to do that.
---
k, brb
---
While I definitely appreciate the item I really wish they would increase it to one hour instead of it being 30 minutes
---
That might be the final option but before you do that, try removing the Alley object and replacing it. This will trigger a respawn once placed. If that don’t work, move to new location.
---
Exactly how I did this in 5:36. No amount of logic will get these people to understand. Tank the shots from the ranged mobs, heal with vampires, and rush to the next point. Ez Elder
---
I just got to the point where I buy stims and blood packs from whitesprings and still only sell the stims for 10 caps a piece. Making negative caps off them is easier than farming tick blood. Keeps my caps from maxing too though. So, it does serve an extra purpose lol
---
Heavy gunner PA build is my main, alt is a stealth rifleman
---
Awesome work, thanks :)
---
Out of curiosity, do you have a "Beyond max Budget" CAMP? And/Or are your Vending Machines right next to where players spawn in?
---
The most common cause for Vending bugs like this are when CAMPs take a long time to load. If the Vending Machines can be reached before a CAMP loads in properly, the glitch can sometimes occur.
---
I'm glad people with full builds, good equipment and a stash full of resources are having a good time.
---
But not everybody is in that same boat.
---
To prevent this they could really do with having the stash box be separate from the vending machines and make you have to put them in from your inventory, but the problem with this would lie with bugs that remove weapons from your vending machine.
---
What is a “Magic shotgun”? I know about the “magic” weapons (from the turtle videos) but they rely on a combination of certain legendary traits and fire rate. The shotgun is nowhere near the rate of fire required. 
---
To my mind there is a difference between weapons with high damage and “magic”, specifically. 
---
Can someone please explain where I am wrong?
---
They do, in the form of rewards points that can be redeemed for gift cards. Takes a little over 9,000 points for a $10 gift card, so I can assure you thats not how I accrued the balance I had/have. Now the $500 Microsoft gift card I got this past Christmas could def allow for a balance capable of being spent however I please.
---
Top prefixes post patch 22, two shot , antiarmor , bloodied (best damage), junkies.
---
Explosive weapons also are slightly better with lvl 5 int perk and sought after
---
Wouldnt surprise me since the clearly rolled back stuff like the slower thrist/hunger speed and the amount of time before needing to repair armor/weapons.
---
Not that bad? 
---
That's like $120
---
Thankfully I can farm stims and diluted stims easily enough directly, but man I used to craft so many from tick blood in the early days.
---
Don't be. The update is shit
---
I had a few disconnect issues when wastelanders first dropped so i’m thinking that it’s the update that wither brings a lot more player traffic or just a wobble until everything is sorted
---
try to avoid Legendary Charisma as it does not let you share more cards in the team at the moment and also Legendary Endurance if you are a Bloodied build as the extra health from +5 Endurance glitches out your health after joining a server and you have to take rads to fix it
---
Same here. I’ve tested all my arsenal today and even though the damage numbers are lower (I recorded them before the patch), combat barely feels any different. Did a few Scorched Earths and the queen melted just as quickly as she did pre-patch.
---
You mean like the fact that ignoring enemies and tanking their damage by getting infinite free heals off unkillable ranged mobs with vampire weapons, while focusing on the only metric that matters in daily ops (time)?  
---
Yeah, funny how some people can’t seem to solve a simple puzzle and then start calling everyone else idiots. Dunning-Krueger in action.
---
That doesn’t include the helmets, correct?
---
I put a comment on another post a while back about this and used ESO as an example. In ESO you pay gold (the amount of gold depending on how many points you had allocated etc) and it gives you all the points back to reallocate as you want. That's also an MMO that values end game players and wants people to carry on playing and having a reason to play every day. Sometimes I feel like Bethesda puts these weird restrictions on the end game players (including scrip cap and other caps) as if it would make everything too easy and we would get bored if we had so much freedom but it's the total opposite and ESO gets it. 
---
I dont wanna spend time levelling a new character where none of my known plans or achievements carry over and we dont even have a central bank to share items between characters....
---
You absolutely hit the nail on the head.
---
I guess so your scrap box doesn't explode?
---
But seriously make this a thing!
---
Oh, my brain must have suppressed one of those zeroes.
---
I'm an artist not a geologist. 
---
XD
---
Thanks for the alert.  I stopped vending because of this kind of stuff. I live in extreme areas of the map and simply didn't do well due to the travel cost of other players, so  I never traded a lot , due to geography. This hopefully will clue in BGS t hat  this needs to be fixed immediately.
---
WE ALL weren’t upset!
---
Have a read through the sub, most of the comments were positive.. anyone who watched any of the PTS videos from non click baity content creators knew what to expect.
---
Right - that's why I mentioned the Death Tambo for finishing shots with a bit more power than just a bash. Pre-nerf I would just solo AWOL Armaments with it. Don't think that will be practical at this point however.
---
re:ammo
---
with the lperk you get +150% on top of ammosmith. more than reason enough to go prime, because the amount of ultracite ammo is unbelievable.
---
edit:a word
---
a powder horn would be nice :)
---
Because I do not believe it is ‘intended’ that players should visit others camps to perhaps use their vending machines and become wanted for simply opening a door because that player was at max caps and locked the door to their ‘shop’. That seems like more of an oversight than an intended feature and thus the dev’s should be made aware that this is a potential consequence. As it stands there could be significantly less footfall to people who’s vendors are indoors behind doors as this consequence becomes widely known and for the griefers out there another weapon in their arsenal to pull people into PvP. I for one will not visit indoor vending machines atm if I have that perk equipped and I stand by the decision to highlight this ‘issue’ to Bethesda.
---
I saw a scorchbeast get goo piled at the SBQ today, too. So that's been reintroduced. :(
---
Maybe I was just being sarcastic proffessor
---
*He’s a defector from a group of defectors.  Let him live with his misery and dishonor, with naught but the ghosts of his failures as company.*
---
It’s 80 percent chance to get a reward on the first time you beat Elder for the day. You gotta wait until the next ops (probably noon) for another chance.
---
Game development can be a lengthy process.
---
I hear that.
---
So, I have kept my unopened perk card packs for no reason then??
---
Yes, yes it can.
---
Love the sarcasm lol
---
This is sums up the entire fallout community. Want it easy, no challenge.
---
It’s actually fun I believe. But I’m sure you where one of those ppl that said game was shit at launch too. Or you have given everything you have for a b2525 fixer or legacy and now you don’t like it. I fought Earle twice and queen once last night and they all went down in ten minutes. Every other enemy was still easy.
---
Managed to complete it in 6:02 with a decent team, ignore everything and know where your going, I wasn't using power armour and running a full health junkies, stealth commando. (Stealth means nothing in there)
---
I've never known an online game that would let you change level scaling and still let you all play together. It would give an unfair advantage on getting items.
---
Huh?
---
I wasn’t aware (haven’t read the patch notes) that enemies were leveling more now. I’m currently lvl 82 and was curious as to why lvl 50+ ghouls were spawning during Defend Poseidon workshop event instead of the usual canon fodder. I don’t remember there being that high of level enemies that close to the middle of the map. Makes sense now.
---
Yeah, it's pretty sweet. I was trying for a Bloodied but after about a half dozen attempts I got the Two Shot instead, it's only a one star but figured it was good enough and frankly I was just tired of the grind by that point.
---
Checkin all the boxes there eh? Grumpy much? And noone wants a bethesda game to be challenging. It’s fallout, not Dark Souls, elder scrolls and fallout are all about feeling OP, not punishing and challenging squirrel shoot em’ ups
---
There will always be annoying naysayers man. Just keep trucking on!
---
oh i didn’t realise it was that common. thanks :)
---
I mean power armor has been in need of something new and good, so as a PA build im more than happy about these perks
---
I recommend shotguns A good legendary shotgun like a two-shot vampiric explosive shotgun is like having as many stimpacks as shotgun shells.
---
Bethesda HATES him! Become a GOD of Fallout 76 with THIS one simple TRICK!
---
I'm at a higher level than you (46), but still trying to finish the main questline, as well as the Settlers questline from Wastelanders. Last weekend I tried to complete "All That Glitters" and managed to get through the miners and the robot swarms, and almost cleared the Atrium, except for that one boss Sentry Bot, and ran out of ammo. So the plan this week was to collect 2x ammo, and try to level to 50 so I can wear some Ultracite power armor.
---
I played for about 4 hours on the new patch, and at the end of the session had no caps, no ammo, and no food. You can't farm a location for resources, because the return on investment is negative - it takes all your ammo. And there is nothing of value on the kills. Why is every ghoul carrying just a scalpel now? And why is every file cabinet and desk empty?  Not only were the enemies boosted and the guns nerfed, but it feels like they removed 90% of all the in-the-wild resources.
---
I'm pretty sure I could have 5x the ammo as last weekend, and I won't get nearly as far into the quest. And leveling up won't help, since the enemies will level up as well. Is everyone suppose to play Daily Ops just to have enough ammo to... play the next Daily Op? How do you progress the questlines now?
---
Yeah your frustration is very understandable.
---
I enjoy the ops, i can actually melt the enemies with my flamer, and still leave with more ammo than I spent. 800 fuel for 2 matches. Yes it is annoying to have to melee gutsys, especially the robobrains when they runaway. Overall though, ops is a good addition to the game, a solid farm, and completely beatable. I don't have a specific build per say either.
---
Hey Dwight 👋  didn't know you played 76
---
Cazadors?  I'll have to check after work.
---
but at low levels not having any ammo being limited to only usung melee is not fun.
---
Low levels gather ammo at very low rate, but spend it at 10x the rate now due to this update.
---
No I just know how weapons work lol
---
Anynone know how much it will cost??
---
Article 1.2? Please remind me of that one.
---
bullet sponge != challenge.
---
The game isn't more challenging, It's just more grindy.
---
I didn’t have many concerns. I figured, at worst, I might have to adjust my tactics. 
---
Actually, not too much. I have to take cover sometimes while reloading. I can’t just stand in the open and one shot chain everything with Gun Fu. But my non-Bloodied/non-Junkies Shotgunner build on my main is doing pretty well. Same for my level 47 mule with no legendary gear. 
---
This is a good balance. And a nice XP bump as well.
---
I think the original plan was to have the strongest enemies cap off at your level, but that somehow got translated to "all enemies are now at your level".  This move was a major mistake as most enemies in even the early areas now tank weapons that weren't made to last many uses.
---
All my gear seems solid still...and it's nice to get higher level gear from legendaries. Update wasnt bad at all.
---
Yeah I don’t like the burrows as I still get lost and joined one in progress and was in stealth until I went Doh , stood up , put on my light and ran past the baddies  to join the team 😂
---
Join a group if possible
---
Ikr. Tbh if its a bug and they patch it im gonna be so sad 😥
---
 Happened to me yesterday half way through Scorched Earth, don’t know if it was a one off or it’s an old thing that’s returned
---
These guys should try play on console where the framerate and controls are the biggest challenge.
---
Had their spawn point right next to their vendor while glitching their camp to go over budget, causing extreme delays between FT to their camp and their camp actually loading.
---
Could be, ive PvPed a few times with this build. But that was months ago.
---
I wish we could just move them out at will without paying a coin.  I had enough to max out 7 cards and 2 of them I would like to swap in and out quite often but the fact that there is a cost stops me from doing that.  I'm sure this is their intention though so I doubt it is unlikely to change.
---
When I get to play, I plan to just pick up the first level of that. It's a +3 to skill even at 1-star, so it should let me at least *try* to hack/pick everything in the game, and I don't have to swap out regular perk cards anymore.
---
This game was designed with the trash mob usage for annoyance.  Now instead of a relaxing pioneer experience every battle is essentially Street Fighter 3 battle for your life vs roach....go!
---
You can get more than one or you might get none, but once you get elder tier for that day you won't be able be eligible for any rare rewards until the daily reset
---
Thanks, I actually think I already have the Blocker perk active. Power user has also been replaced but cant remeber with what, might be more demo expert or gunsmith. Ive never bothered with class freak, is it noticeable?
---
I'm right with you there. It's unenjoyable, and frankly there are other titles that will be getting my money at this point
---
Lol same here. Ever since getting the Fasnacht beer stein I immediately wanted to complete the collection...which means grinding all the way to rank 100 across all three seasons.
---
Well I'm glad your bloodied build is still fine..... My stealth rifleman non mutated build is fk'd.
---
My x2 shot increased damage per consecutive hit combat shotgun takes x12 shots to kill a snallygaster at point blank with a Max shotgun Perk card and all my stealth perks.
---
That's with a hardened receiver and stinging MAG, so I had to reload to finish it off.... That's X24 regular shotgun rounds at best.
---
Before the update, it would have been 3 maybe 4 shots with the same weapon if I didn't get detected.
---
The rubber banding health doesn't help things either.
---
People say VATS stops the rubber banding, but I don't have enough AP for x10 shots, so there goes that. 
---
Now by the time I get it close to dead, I gotta reload and they've detected me, so my sneak perks are useless and I'm getting thrashed.
---
And now you can't regroup back to a low level place to repair and get resources because everywhere is level 50 and up now.
---
I quit after the third task in that daily task shit because I was running around with 8 level 60 respawning robots on my ass with no idea how to get to the next objective.
---
My build performs the exact same after a few perk adjustments, and the higher level XP means I'm leveling up faster. Love it!
---
Low level content is currently hellish
---
IMO having permanent stealth detection was the bad move for Daily Ops. If it's one of the mutators, fine, but this negates a large portion of player builds. It's bad, just like if they made a modifier "Instantly kills players with 50% or more rads" or "Immune to heavy weapons" or "Instantly drains all fusion cores".
---
I'm fully aware that I can change my build, but it's borderline impossible without shuffling stat allocation. And I don't want to move stats everytime I want to Daily Ops, especially now when we have perk card scrapping. The issue is that stealth build realy on stealth for defense. I have endurance of 1, which sucks hard for any non-stealth encounter.
---
If stealth detection was only on the rotation, then I could skip only some days. This way the Daily Ops are impossible for me as solo. All I can do is to join group and rely on them to tank the damage...
---
Nocturnal is the shit. You one hit everything in your path. Get the rolling pin and then take the chef, expert chef, and master chef for bonus damage. Get the foundation backpack mod for lower food weight and then stock up on ingredients. The more raw food ingredients you have the more damage you will do. Just remember not to fight during the day. You are a dinner chef only as that gives you the most murder potential.
---
Same here...
---
It is a possibility then. I don’t think I was particularly aggressive because I was still running a rifleman/melee hybrid a few months ago.
---
For some reason I thought this update was supposed to cut down on the min maxing and let use have a greater variety of viable builds but I feel it’s the opposite with patch 22. If you’re not equipping every single dmg perk you can, it’s game over
---
The resilant mutation is brutal. Every other one will be much easier I'm thinking. Though the cold touch might be. A pain running from onepoint to another
---
These people are probably using vampire weapons on unkillable mobs for free heals. Because the point of this op is to finish it quickly. Not farm xp. Which means standing on the uplinks for the bonus speed multiplier and not worrying about the enemies will get you Elder with a large margin of error.  
---
And the people dumping ammo into an invulnerable imposter sheepsquatch are probably getting their tag in before someone one-shots the boss, so they can actually get some loot.  
---
At a certain point in your life your knee-jerk reaction should stop being “these people do something different from me. They are idiots” and be more like “why are they doing this? Am I missing something? Am I the one who was stupid all along?”
---
Sighhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
If only.
---
I don't know, the season isn't even 24 hours old
---
I've got to second Xanny's comment, below: full-health stealth commando, and it takes maybe 3 extra bursts for most non-robot enemies. Haven't run into a sheepsquatch or a deathclaw yet, but so far my trusty fixer hasn't let me down. I did pick up a Vampiric flamer for Ops and 'bots, though...
---
Your right should have put some 😂😂😂 after post , not meant to be grumpy, I spend ages at work doing just that on my phone instead of working 👍
---
Ugh this mean they’re going to take vendors down again? I rather buy my ammo and last time they went down was for weeks.
---
Do you happen to have a handful of those small Atomic Shop Vault Tec Generators? In the prior patch (21)  Bethesda increased the amount of C.A.M.P. budget those generators consume.
---
RIP everyones ammo and repair kit reserves
---
Thanks for the tip 👍
---
How how did you do it so fast wtf
---
Only you MrWhipple
---
I can finally just wander and farm kill anything no more living at Wes tec. Love it.
---
This!  I use this build and one hit Earl
---
Nice, I'll build one now since I run a meelee build. Can never have too much strength.
---
Well thats at least what i have done :v
---
That's scary af.  I'm scared shitless of Fog Crawlers again after these nerds.  I gotta sit down &amp; figure out wtf I'm gonna do.
---
Depends, what are your mutations?
---
You mean it doesn’t add carrying weight like fallout 4? It’s been like that for me for a few months now.
---
Instigating, swing speed cultist dagger here. It's a shame it only fits on a large display.
---
Yep. Earl is totally weak to food based bonus damage. That guy is always starving.
---
I only picked two legendary perks that weren’t special ones. Maxed out ammo and two starred the ranged sneak one and I picked strength, luck and intelligence. Luck is now all most maxed out. Strength is at 10 and intelligence is at 6 now. Once I get more cards to scrap I will be using them also.
---
Are you sure it's 76 or is it just Todd?
---
Does the shooting gallery or the foosball table provide any buff from use like the weight bench does?
---
I could see the foosball improving agility and the shooting gallery improving perception.
---
I think right now it's the best time to create a new character. Enemies will scale now to your lvl which means you will not meet lvl 68 super mutants or lvl 50 Mr.gutys while you walking around with lvl 20 and doing quests.
---
Just make sure you know what kind of build you will play in the future. So you can choose perks from the start which you really need later.
---
Really? I’m finding stuff does just as quick sometimes maybe 1 bullet more...
---
Personally I love one wasteland, I can just roam and kill stuff at my level, no need to avoid areas incase I get a good roll on a level 10 legendary
---
LOL hes saying he has difficulty dealing with regular enemy and you want him to go THERE where i killed more than 50+ level 60 robot that i could not finish with bullet  
---
daily ops is not the solution to bullet farm for low level people
---
that's true, but thats a rich mans problem, im still only around lvl 170, so for now the coins are better used elsewhere ;)
---
Yeah I get that, but when some events are on a countdown to start I tend to just go there, sometimes there isn’t enough time to bounce back to camp to stash and then drop into the event. The answer to this shouldn’t be just don’t take junk
---
Shhhhhhhhhh don't tell anyone, enjoying my quad double barell for some more time.
---
Not that I have discovered. Simply decoration I'm afraid.
---
If you're on PC, find me in-game (Lamorak\_2000). If you have something to trade, I might have one available. DM me here...
---
Careful man, people pick locks al the time at camps.
---
really nice build but where is starched genes?
---
is this an error in your build or am I blind
---
If you’re not enjoying it with the old character.  Start a new one and build from there. I always enjoyed building new characters and the new player struggles. If that doesn’t work then you won’t waste your time trying to force yourself to enjoy the game.
---
I HATED mobs when I first got the game , learned to be a bit more strategic with them
---
My biggest gripe... they gave Ward his stuff back and now I actually have to go find it again everyday, rather than just pretending to care lol
---
The only thing Bethesda brought to the table is the audacity.
---
(Joke, even if it's rooted in more truth than it should be.)
---
I love it so much. Definitely a lot more challenging
---
Did you get the Ammo Converter from the old Legendary Run event? If so, you can trade those in for points towards other ammo that's actually useful to you.
---
Still worked for me last night
---
What's the absorption perk do? I missed it while picking out ammo factory and the one that replaces the need for lockpick and hacking perks.
---
Stop it , can’t eat my lunch for laughing 😂😂😂😂
---
😕 I have a legendary anti armor sniper rifle and I notice a huge difference.
---
Are you using a mod that saves loadouts for you?
---
So far it really sucks.
---
First- 99.9999999% of us dont or dont want to play with low levels or anyone else.
---
Second--  the daily op really really blows but time will tell if non robot melee ops are less miserable
---
And finally the legendary perks just allow you to undo the damage this update did to everything with 76 hours of work to unlock more coins,  which are another bs currency we get to ever so slowly gather
---
I feel like Bethesda nerfed builds. You get punished with less damage for having damage cards and modifiers to boost your damage. It just feels like diminishing returns on damage modifiers. I still dont understand how damage is calculated in this patch. Last patch made sence to me. Did I feel bloodied was a little op, yeah because you have to be on death's door. I thought a nerf for bloodied and junkies wouldn't be bad. Just decrease the damage each prefix does, 10% for junkies and 15-25% for bloodied. At this point I would take the old way of damage calculating with bloodied only boosting 40% damage. Or change it so bloodied only increases damage under 50% health but every 10% health is 20% damage. So it does less damage above 50% health like nocturnal effect during the day. I just cant stand burning through rounds like this. If I didn't have a good stockpile of 556 I would have been screwed yesterday. I went through 17k 556(half of all my ammo) yesterday in a few colossal problems/SBQs and 3 daily ops. At this point a bloodied gun(current patch) is the same as a non legendary gun(pre patch) with my build. I cant imagine how other builds are feeling since their damage will be very low but they were not hit as hard as bloodied so they might like it.
---
It's really not "harder" than it was, it just takes more time for the same rewards.  I die more, but death is so toothless, I don't even make an effort not to die.  I feel weak, I don't feel like I can get any stronger without just making an entirely different character, and I guess that's it.  I don't get why it's more fun for anyone.  What's more fun about it?    
---
Maybe it has something to do with what your guns are... I dunno.  As a stealth sniper   
---
 i'm not having more fun I can tell you that much.
---
But now lvl 60 ghouls are scaled to them so it evens out
---
Its very good. I love one wasteland and being able to fight lvl 100 mole rats and use my OP legendary perks. Just wish I didn't have to completely respecc now because my melee is useless. Really sucks
---
What platform are you on? If PC, I can craft you up a solid set of armour.
---
Also, post your build. Use Nukes and Dragons character builder, post a link in your OP.
---
Edit: You're on PS4, and I'm as blind as a bat. XD
---
To start...u need to collect 500 frogs...
---
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again , if bethesda ever removes his protective status his brains are going to be decorating his trailer
---
😂😂😂😂so random 😂😂😂😂so brilliant😂😂😂
---
Why just leather, may I ask? Why not Combat or Marine?
---
I  have my camp at savage divide and never had a single enemy spawn on it.
---
I guess it's because there's a blood eagle camp just next to me and  a normal enemy spawn point on the south so maybe that mess with the random spawns making them unable to appear.
---
Yeah but if they get a wanted level won't it pop up and I can just back out. Or does it not Inform me.
---
You are acting like making it to where you have to think about your build to do good is some big sin they are commiting
---
I hope tomorrow has a much better roll for the Ops I know a lot of people were frustrated with today’s one. I missed out on a lot of XP because I had to just stand on the points and not kill anything because they all sit back and shoot you and you had to finish them with melee. 
---
I managed to get a rare reward though I have no idea what it does, the other rolls weren’t the best but I think I just enjoyed something that was get from point A to B and no having to really defend anyone. I actually really like the riding shotgun event and would have loved for this game to have missions more like destiny strikes, bit more interesting than the events we get.
---
don't forget full sets of Power armour
---
Try doing it on 5 characters! :)
---
Imagine some poor new player unlucky enough to stumble onto this post 😂😂
---
Ahh but op does imply that repeating burrows vs daily in term of experience and rewards is better and less painful for him/her. 
---
Lastly, I don't see op saying we should disregard daily ops entirely. Yet. 
---
I feel that OP's point is that spamming popular locales is superior than repeating daily ops. I probably would agree.
---
Do a daily Ops or two. You get a staggering amount of ammo from it. Used a shotgun. Went in with 100 shells. Came out with nearly 500.
---
Also, don't weapons degrade slower now? If its really an issue for you, take the luck skills that repair them on hits. My deathclaw, laser pistol with splitter and shotgun hasn't needed repairing in almost 300 hours of play.
---
I've been holding off from junkie's because it seemed OP before patch 22. Luckily, I've saved several junkie's weapons that were promising (or so I think...) for use when the time comes.  I have an alt ready to take this build on.  I kept all the bloodied exposive I've found (never purchased) as a doomday option. This  is not it.  
---
Thanks for the tips I'll try it with this build.
---
I'm pretty sure the free collectron bot in the store right now collects ballistic fiber. Place it in your camp and collect it as it comes in
---
i know shills from non-english speaking countries are cheaper but come on now beth...
---
Optimize your build then. I can 3 shot lv 60 super mutants and 4 shot lv 75 ones at Wes tek with a 2* bloodied handmade or one hit them with my bloodied death claw gauntlet. Handmade isn't even explosive and only does 167 damage under 20% and my dcg is under 500 damage. Don't even have to equip the unarmed perk for 20% more damage. I'm also rifleman not commando.
---
Maybe, all my other characters camp out near the Wayward or New Gad and the surrounding areas, while this one was so far away from any marked location it's no surprise I never get a message of not being able to place my camp.
---
I asked some friends who said they're getting constant radscorpion spawns now
---
Enemies are a lot more dangerous now they more efficiently make their way to you because of their perception ability. 
---
They also last longer than normal enemies so they get more hits in as well, there is also more of them than in a normal fight.
---
Gotta day, it’s nice to get rid of a lot of useless cards. Also I love the legendary versions of the SPECIAL attributes! I love being able to invest into a SPECIAL that I didn’t have enough points for! Also for only 1 point to swap out legendary perks! Great call!
---
I maxed it out, most of the time it does nothing for me. I get the exact same damage numbers on enemies when hitting them with with sneak attack from my Fixer. Sometimes it \_seems\_ to work but I'm not sure if that's just Adrenaline kicking in, have to do some more testing but yeah it's bugged for me.
---
Shotguns have a extremely low rof not really an issue but thanks.
---
yup I also use my stalkers rolling pin as a backup..it's pretty OP
---
Preferably cazadors that have the perception buff like in daily ops.
---
Took my stealth sniper down there and got brutalized because I couldn't stealth and I had to go weapon bash the dudes I got to 1hp.  Felt really tragic for a character build that I honestly dont think I can improve. lol.
---
Same here, I'll be lucky if my Bloodied Bowie Knife with FSS hits for anymore than 30 now :(
---
I use the loadmout manager mod and its a dream, ive decided to just not get rewarded for daily ops instead of play without it (although i did take off my mods to sort out my legendary perks then they went right back on again)
---
Interesting..I didn't think of trying that. Thanks
---
I'm a counter to this argument, I'm level 31 and yeah everything lower level is harder and I use more ammo but i'm not scared of leaving the forest anymore, I joined loads of events last night I wouldn't usually attend, I don't have to worry about a random Lvl 70 Glowing Deathclaw popping up on me
---
And to top it off i easily managed to get an extra 3 levels whereas it'd usually take me a week of casual playing to get a level
---
You seem like the kind of person that expects 3\* legendaries for events in the Forest.
---
I've only been playing for 2 months;  admittedly, I'm level 310 already.  
---
I did not play on the PTS at all. 
---
I'm also a shotgun build.  (so not melee).
---
I ran 2 daily ops.  One, I had no idea what I was doing.  Another guy from my group (level 250) joined up with me.  I had already wasted 3-4 minutes running around.  We finished it in 10 minutes total, neither of us dieing.
---
I then joined another public ops group - a team of a mid 50, mid 70, and a 120. We finished it in 8 minutes and 10 second... with me &amp; the 120 doing most of the work.  While I think the lower guy died once, we didn't die at all.
---
So... if anything, it felt really easy to me.  With my power armor on - I was just kinda sitting this absorbing hits.
---
I had decided to switch from stealth sniper to power armor heavy just before this, currently in the process of leveling to pick the cards a i need an then move them, only 50 some odd levels to go......
---
Yeah a system to actually repec would be nice.
---
I've already played enough to know I'd come back too early. Gunna play some fun games while Bethesda figures out how to even spell fun.
---
I don't think gutsys alone are worth doing a build just for them although i reckon they're the worst group of enemies for a bloodied build, that's why I always avoided awol event they do need some kind of nerf because they deal more damage than the SBQ or Earl
---
As a junkie heavy build it didn't change anything for me either, things melt just as fast as before.
---
Mutation serums are fairly cheap at the right player vendors
---
...6:45 on the clock, final bot shows up...my hole team gets discoed.... not a big deal though...we came right back and finished in 6:35!
---
Doesn't matter what your ROF is. Beth have added ammo dropping hordes into the game with Ops and Earles Wendigo. Combine that with Ammosmith and the new legendary ammo perk, and you really should be OK with ammo.
---
See. I can never get rid of all the ducks I have. Wanna Duck? All the girls then think I wanna sleep with them, but no, I just have pet ducks I need to rehome.
---
That’s because it’s not a straight up 60% damage increase. It’s an additive 10% increase for each kill. So lets say I ran a bloodied weapon and had 50 damage before Bloodied took effect. Then say I get a 50% damage increase, for running half health, making its damage 75. If I had Adrenaline active, I would have a 60% increase on 75, so it’s now 120. But since it’s now an additive buff based off your weapon, you’re now getting 10% of 50 added with each kill up to 6 kills. This is just a simplified version ignoring all your other damage increasing perks and drugs, food, drink etc.
---
Thanks for the kind clarification ,I didn't know that acronym.
---
Thats how I did it with my level 570 character that saved up a lot of perk packs and levelups:
---
1) stay in your camp and equip Happy Camper perk as this may take a while
---
2) scrap all non-animated perk cards
---
3) open all perk packs (you can cancel the animation)
---
4) again scrap all non-animated perk cards, duplicate animated cards or animated cards you don't want (did this in batches of 20 perk packs)
---
5) get your desired perks and upgrade your collection of animated perks
---
6) take your levelups ... best way to do it is choosing a 1-star-card like "Green Thumb" (as then you can avoid the perk upgrade prompt) and just spam the button
---
7) scrap these perks (did this in batches of 40-50 perks)
---
8) stop when you reached 1800 perk coins as this is enough to upgrade all 6 legendary perks to the highest level
---
So my build now has mostly animated cards and 6 legendary perks (although I just upgraded two until I know which legendary perks I want to keep).
---
After this process I had 50 levelups left that I keep in case I want to move some specials or get new perks.
---
Testing the legendary perks will cost again some perk coins for switching, but I plan on using the scrapped perk packs (like the season rewards) for this.
---
Well you get 50 when you hit level 50.but other than that, yeah just from scrapping
---
Or they could electrify it and have you lose health and AP while you sit on the fence.
---
There’s a global notice that ‘player x is now wanted’ but it won’t say why or where, so you may not even think to check if you even happen to see that message. It sucks. I usually change the door to a wall to be sure. And make sure if you have windows that people can’t look in to be in range to use a crafting table or similar items that’ll pull them into your house.
---
Its not the only way to play but it sure is a popular one, but let's not fool ourselves and say other builds were that much more viable before this patch, my secondary used to be a stealth sniper and it always felt underpowered and slow, if you shoot at range (sniper) your damage drops off dramatically, it was never a good build in this game. Pistols were and still are trash . 2 hand and unarmed are still good and one hand is still bad. The meta hasn't really changed just now everyone is a little weaker. 
---
At lease now everyone don't one shot everything if you have a half put together build and now you can feel accomplished when taking out a really tough enemy. 
---
I'm not saying the change is perfect but its not the end of the world , think of it as turning up the difficulty because the game was getting stale having everyone run around as superpowered one shot machines. It isn't that fun.
---
But as always thats how I feel and other feel different and that's OK too.
---
Bummer. Hopefully they change that in the future.
---
With queenie you sometimes never actually join the event. So you can kill her, loot the queen but get no flux. You have to check if you have got the event listed as an active quest.
---
Did my first ops solo at lvl 169 as full health unarmed tank (600+ Dr and er) . Worked just fine 😀
---
there is definitely something going on if you are using 50+ round of shotgun to kill an enemy around your level. if you are level 20, maybe your equipment is old, maybe you are trying to take more than you can chew. personally, i noticed the nerf and the buff as soon as i logged in, it took about twice as much bullet to kill scorched ( and you can feel that even more on big creature ).  
---
i feel where you are coming from but you also need to understand that the patch will not be reversed or cancelled, you will need to adapt, however you can.  
---
the fallout community is usually very helpful and i'm sure you could find someone to help you with some gear or xp farm. I will be doing my daily for the next 70 day at around 8pm  (GMT-4), contact me if you play around that time : UED Darkgamer
---
Is... is this sarcasm? If trash mobs are scaled to them and they are having issues killing them, how will higher level things being scaled to them help? They will still be harder to kill than the trash ones, so... 
---
This is sarcasm right?
---
No, it's just more accurate now since it'll take you four or five shots.
---
I agree, def wasted potential
---
Hey use the shredder barrel for minigun you'll thank me later
---
Yep, there's a mod for it (though it hasn't been reworked to account for this update yet).
---
It was originally out very early in the game's lifespan. Every day that passes is another day I'm disappointed in Bethesda.
---
Maybe it's more your playstyle than anything else. It's possible to kill decently levelled creatures with appropriately levelled normal non legendary weapons.
---
You just have to be a little smarter going about it, like taking on only 1 or 2 at a time instead of 6.
---
Just do that until you get better gear or can purchase better gear. That's assuming your build isn't the problem.
---
No I expect to not kill a level 50 mutant and get 2 steel 3 .308 and a hunting rifle for the 20 shots I pumped into him. But I do expect you to be a self absorbed jerk but thanks for the useless comment.
---
TBH I'm too afraid that I'm so much of a butter finger I'll accidentally drop it and lose my best gun. Keeping the skins off for the moment :-)
---
Tbh I thought it would be as horrible as One Tamriel for ESO.
---
But! It's really good. Ok my Bloodied unarmed build is now really not worth running around with anymore but I switched to a heavy build and shredd everything in a few shots.
---
Even the first daily was solo possible just with an vampires swing speed fire Axe. It's overall more challenging right now but I noticed I can play with various other legendary effects right now not only with bloodied. Vampire is my new favorite, but also Anti Armor and even suppressor weapons are now viable to use. I really enjoy it so far. Also the daily ops are an insane way for XP farms lol
---
Will do thanks for info ill just build a wall and store it when needed .
---
Oh the early post-B.E.T.A days, a shitstorm I’d pay money to have back
---
Well its about 5k Caps each. I dont know how to make that kind of money. Im about 100 lvl and my max was 3k
---
I would do it by making stealth not work while within an uplink area. So you can hide and help your team by shooting stuff from stealth, but the Op is going to be completed slower because one player is purposefully remaining outside the uplink area.
---
Seems to give at least one but I've not been keeping track other than looking at rare rewards.
---
It's made crossbows actually usable. They did bring that bug back with ground pounder and power armor where the reload speed is base level until you unequip the weapon.
---
The forest isnt low level anymore, so why shouldn't we?
---
Funny thing is with the Wastelanders patch or maybe the one after, there was a patch note that read something like “removed misleading ‘increases damage’ description from heavy barrel” and now a few patches later they must’ve realized it was a completely useless attachment. 
---
I only had it on because it looked cool and then I noticed my auto grenade launcher was now showing more damage than my M79 (normally they’re the same)
---
Yesterday I died just after SBQ died, but before the event completed (damn u sneaky mirelurk king) and... I couldnt respawn, before that I had to try and fast travel 10-15x from the silo (was bad whole evening, with atleast 5x trying before fast traveling, but from nuke silo it always seems worse)
---
so yeah... good job fixing that, and fast travel bug is worse than ever it seems, but hey atleast they fixed that we cant put crops on fireplaces anymore...
---
I mean they added no new content except 3 new dailies where are the new quest lines? 2 years and all we got was wastelanders which should have been the base campaign. A whole new battlepass how do you level it up with NO QUESTS? the same dailies and weeklies you’ve been doing for months? oh and sorry 3 new ops that are bugged and just repetitive
---
Somehow it still works since 3 updates. Even as the glowing ore, lockpick and better inventory mod.
---
You’re welcome man. I learned all this the hard way and don’t want anyone else experiencing this crap.
---
Yep! Read the patch notes on Bethesdas website or find em on Facebook
---
Proof ? Are you on console or pc ? Was your stash near the vendors ?
---
Tried a few times solo last night and was repeatedly eviscerated
---
Oof. If you're pumping in 20 shots into a super mutant, there's something you're not doing right. It should be more like 3-8. Maybe 10 max.
---
Its not about the ammo its about the loot and risk reward factors. Is it worth it another words.
---
It feels like the game is running smoother for me now too with less laggy moments, theyre still there, but seem to be a lot less frequent so far
---
No lol, some players will sell the serum anywhere from 300 to 100 caps each
---
Now try playing the game from the beginning with no legendary perks or legendary weapons!
---
You will see the unfair slog the game has become!
---
I’m level 91 and personally I find it a bit inconsistent. Some enemies I can blitz through them others melt me even in power armour I can rinse a liberator in a single hit with my super sledge then the next one I come across rinses me before I get a chance to even look at it and they’re both equal levels
---
Thatll take way too long! Damn man
---
Fair enough. I was thinking once you had activated an object or enemy, all enemies within a certain distance would be alerted to your presence, a lot like real life. If you somehow slipped past a dozen soldiers on a military base for example, and tried to steal a car, starting it would alert everyone in the area.
---
considering the word build hadn't really crossed my mind until you guys mentioned it, it's likely that it is a problem as well. Also the appropriately levelled part is a huge issue as well.
---
Many mods change stuff that doesn't need to be updated often, but this one needed a fix for Legendary Perks (with the mod on, you can't see the legendary perk menu).
---
I can't believe it was so fast, but I just went to check and looks like the update is up. I'm impressed.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/ has a build planner, but it doesnt have guides into particular sets of builds.
---
Adrenal and speed demon
---
I think rough is relative. 
---
If by rough you mean more difficult because you have to go to old areas for certain reasons and can no longer walk through like a god, then yes.
---
But that's the point in it, the game is now more challenging for everyone.
---
Being fair the crop glitch is way older than the respawn bug
---
Sell access water, stimpacks aid etc to the robot vendors daily to get some income
---
All melee, rifles and pistols are trash now!
---
Have to pick a card sadly. Its a big pain
---
He also explains magic shotguns. Basically if you v.a.t.s. hit every bullet of the shotgun hits the same spot on the enemie, creating the same effect as in magical fast-fire-weapons. You are looking for the same perks.
---
I'm right out by the bat on the bottom right border of the map, Cranberry Bog way. Haven't seen any mobs attack my home. Last night, I had 3 mirelurk King thingies, 2 vengeful mothmen, and 2 ghoul packs. It was a bloodbath haha! I now have 6 turrets on my roof, and I still died.
---
I'm fine with it, it's great fun. But it's out me off taming anything for my home now, which is a wee shame. I've wanted a Sloth as a friend for ages.
---
Tell me about it, Doing them solo is a nightmare
---
I tried playing with a handmade yesterday, was my good "all around" gun besides my shotgun, but now my shotgun feels like a god teir and my handmade feels useless. I guess I need to hope for good legendary drops now. At least getting scrip is easier than ever, though I wish the Daily Ops had actual legendary *enemies* for the daily tasks and weekly tasks.
---
Ah sheet for real?!? Man I have so much rare stuff in my stash that I just felt comfortable to put back in there! What a joke!!
---
any clue what range ps4 servers fall in?
---
I've been working on slimming down (running about 1350, 455 carry weight), but, not there yet. So, I'm in Excavator PA. I'm not a PA spec'd player, more a stealth commando/noperk rifleman. Instigating .50 rifle, and various autos: Fixers, Combat, Handmades.
---
So.... I head into the Burrows (which I don't have memorized) to be nonstop swarmed by wave after wave of robots. Until I changed my tactics, I probably died 20-30 times. I was not amused. Then I tried just ignoring them and just getting to the quest points. That worked better, but, still had lots of bots, was sucking down a lot of stimpaks.
---
Finally got to the end, to fight the BIG BAD. Found an area up a bunch of ramps, office type huts, and was able to whittle her down, with only two deaths.
---
Over the course of 46 minutes. Phew! Repaired my Troubleshooter Handmade, 2-3 times. Other weapons I used were AA auto Combat, V Handmade, and grenades. Used about 2k 5.56, maybe 1k .45, 30ish grenades. Many deaths could be attributed to trying to weapon bash and finish them off.
---
Piercing Gaze and Resilient were an overpowering combo, I think they should limit them to one mutation, otherwise I think I'll skip anything with this combo...
---
Mobs were dropping 'correct' ammo, but, not enough, and besides with the never ending stream of enemies I was not looting a lot of corpses :).
---
1 card = 2 points.
---
The thing is, I’ve been hearing this update is great and I’ve also heard that enemies are basically bullet sponges. I don’t even know what to expect right now
---
To change build a lot of people would also have to waste potential Coins for Legendary perks. I totally agree with you on the matter of stealth being totally nullified. It's a quick and dirty (dare I say lazy) fix to make their 'objectives' easier to manage; they don't have to worry about someone stealthing unnoticed in one of the 'capture' zones. However, as you note, it makes things difficult for a massive portion of the playerbase to give themselves an easier time. It would have been much smarter to give enemies a cone or zone of something akin to a 50/50 chance of spotting people in stealth and so give us at least some chance of playing tactically.
---
Phat stacks of Atoms, ey ;)
---
Does the foosball table support 2 players? Or only 1?
---
I honestly don't know what to do with my character.  Like there's nothing to improve it.  I'm just kinda weak.
---
Ding ding some common since lol thanks
---
I really don't like to say "I told you so", so I'd rather say this was what I was afraid of. 
---
Meticulously crafted meta builds with hundreads of levels in (except I'm sorry for all the unarmed builds) didn't take that much of a hit, now I have to shoot a mutie twice in the head to kill instead of once, and some bigger enemies take about 5-6 bullets more, but that's not a problem for me.
---
The problem is that everything else went to heck and stayed there until this gets sorted out.
---
Exactly. Using more ammo doesn't make it more challenging, it just makes it a resource sink.
---
yeah having to bash the bots was annoying and there were loads of em, but it was still really easy to get the elder rank imo
---
They were always out performed by full auto rifles, just they're completely unusable now!
---
Did you die to flamer? That's the only weapons i use on that character.
---
I think it's less low levelled players and more novice players.
---
I started over and currently have a level 15. The difference is quite stark between how things were just before and just after the patch but it's perfectly manageable.
---
The biggest issue for me was to avoid being swarmed. I use to have no fear approaching a pod of 5 or more enemies. Now I'm a little more cautious.
---
You see under your perks 12 boxes for loadouts. Then you choose for example all mods for hacking,lockpicking or everything for crafting,campbuilding,ammomaking and hold shift-# (nr of presetbox) and it saves that perk loadout. So if you want to change your perks you go to your perks and just press 1 or 2 etc
---
Not correctly at all. With an outfit, there is just the outfit to keentravk of. Nothing else.
---
With weapons, the game has to keep track of level, number of legendary effects, which legendary effects it has, and mods. That puts way more of a load on the server and you can even visualize it on Xbox whenever you have a lot of weapons in your stash because it starts to lag
---
Im happy for the changes really.. Just walking around one shotting everything made the game boring for me personally. Now I seek out team members and strategy ideas for the party to take one spec ops or boss events. I get to roam around the map with that slight fear that my next encounter will present a challenge. I get to redesign my builds with more perk cards then before (legendary SPECIAL cards open slots). I can now hunt down weapons that may not be anything to another.. But work well with my build plan.. Its hella fun
---
I've only been able to test it by myself, so hopefully I'll have a answer to that soon
---
So all Vending are busted ????
---
Collect crap and sell to vendor for caps you’ll soon build up some cash , join teams and go vendor shopping , no god tier weapons and armour but there’s some decent bits to be found
---
I forget, is that "home defense" perk thing an INT perk? I forget which one gives you all the turrets. I can juice it out because I just stop leveling up after the cap and I get all the perks I need, and with the new legendaries I was able to ditch needing lockpicking skills and hacking skills, I actually bothered to equip Precision Shooting or whatever it is that gives me full VATS use.
---
And then add in, no safe area. It's basically survival mode, every minute, every day, everywhere.
---
There are plenty of viable builds that don't require bloodied, or commando.
---
I'm on a diet.
---
Carrot stick?
---
So you're only measuring this in DPS then.
---
Yeah, a flaming Thomas the tank engine killed me from above. I think it might have been a power plant. Some time in November last year.
---
oh yea I agree. I think they need to be harder overall, but this is not representative
---
I friggin LOVE this update! The game is  challenging enough now where it actually requires a few brain cells to do things. Theres still alot of stuff id like to see done but this is most certainly a step in the right direction. Gg beth
---
Im waiting for the resilient perk to change, hate it. As soon as i reach those sweet sweet explosive blood eagles i'm gonna grind the shit outta it

Did you have one of those ammo factory things in your camp? If so, you deserved it.
---
When you can’t one shot radroaches in a fallout game that’s a problem.
---
The premises should have insurance or they are being irresponsible owners.
---
Why are you assuming that I meant he go in alone? Maybe he can get some higher level friends to help him, make a Reddit post asking higher level players to help him farm ammo in daily ops, or he can make a daily ops team and wait for higher level players to join. It definitely can be a solution, if they ask for help. The one thing most low level players do not do in online multiplayer games, is ask for help (IMO). Asking for help and making friends can alleviate so many problems for low level players. Many don’t do it though. With one wasteland, playing as a team has become more important. As is asking for help if you have none.
---
I like carrots. I will buy them and eat them on the way out of the supermarket. I get weird looks sometimes...
---
... oh god, I just realized my camp that's right next to a Vile Tick spawning point is going to need more turrets.
---
The only way they deleted camp is if you had an ammo factory. Did you have one?
---
I'm going to use it as a mobile storage center. No more having to slowly walk to my camp (top of map near Crater. Like the resource nodes), or tent by Foundation after clearing Uranium Fever or West-Tech!
---
Yeah I understand that but in theory there is nothing stopping me putting 8000 outfits in my stash were as a few decent heavy guns will max it out quickly my point is it be item amount based not weight based. 
---
If that's case why can I have say 800 legendary reduced weight item that still need all the tracking etc on but only say 50/heavys weapons. Same situation as you say above.
---
Question. Where the hell IS the weights in the build menu. I looked for an hour with no luck after unlocking it
---
Yeah I had 130 and like 30 perk packs. Took awhile to get threw everything
---
There are dozens of us, dozens!
---
Yeah, that could work too.
---
Because getting specific Legendary combos is not as easy as "just get one."
---
I been on my level 25 for a few days trying to level up and yesterday was a breath of fresh air.the day before the update I bearly was able to solo uranium fever but last night uranium fever was a breeze.no God level weapons just a level 15 mutants handmade and a level 20 mutant combat rifle. Low level requires some strategy for me
---
A few are but not all, it's just like as if all your enemies are now as tough as the enemies you used to fight st your level. Cause now they are all your level.
---
Switch to commando....? Just swap out rifleman for commando
---
If you have caps, go do some shopping at the player vendors. There is good stuff in them and some players sell cheap. Also you can buy ballistic fiber from robot vendors. If you needs caps, loot everything, collect purified water and sell them to robot vendors.
---
Take a look at your perk cards and if you want outsider feedback, post them here like the others have said.
---
There's something really fucked up when this is now the only viable way to keep ammo good unless you can really hoard materials.
---
Once again, not the burglars fault. Ok bud.
---
Are you using an external hard drive? I remember I lost all my saves once on 4 and could only recover them by transferring the game from external storage to internal. Ik it's a different game but maybe it's the same principle.
---
I really cant
---
This. I can deal with the stealth-cancellation, I found a map of the burrows online (level 156 and had never been there)...but that BS of having to get up close and personal to finish off mobs that all look the same? I'll learn to adapt, but really - fuck RESILIENT!
---
Someone had an ammo factory. Lemme guess. “My friend placed 20 of them around my camp without me knowing”. Psh get out of here. I hope you had an elaborate and very creative camp and now you have to rebuild it from memory.
---
Ammo factory is where it's at tho. With super duper, ammo Smith and ammo factory I'm making 500 - 5mm a pop. I made 20k without even realizing it.
---
OP admits that
---
Now that animals/creatures scale to your level, you should be able to get a high level tameable for some defense
---
Better be a free item. It'd be a bit wide to make us pay something that should've been here since day 1. But watch em make us pay for it
---
Unless you're a low level who can't afford to craft ammo yet!
---
What kind of build are you and which enemies are difficult? Use VATS when combat is difficult. If that's still difficult, ask about how to fight. There are many people who are good at fighting on this reddit. If you build properly, you can actually defeat Level 50 enemies in one or two shots.
---
Damn, that’s a next level fuck up
---
Oh wow, that's shi.... very unfortunate 😒
---
Best update since wastelanders EASILY and may be the second best update ever.
---
First, wasn't a glitch. Where is the glitch in buffs being multiplicative. Is as valid as having additive buffs, is just a design choice.
---
Second, just shut up.
---
Getting only two coins each is a bit shit... 
---
Takes 150 coins for the 4th level on the cards.
---
Where can one go about acquiring this said "stalkers rolling pin"?please do tell
---
Borderlands 3 has dynamic level scaling, cooperation and co-opetition loot. So enemies scale to your level, and you can either have instanced loot or shared loot
---
It will still be useful against the resilient enemies in Daily Ops. One of my friends was using a faster swing speed knife of some sort today to finish off the bots and it was making short work of them. The faster you can finish them off the better the time you get. Im keeping my eye out/hoping to get a faster swing dagger myself and regretting all the ones Ive probably scripped or sold
---
No, all unyielding.  Agility is so high you don't need it or sneak perks, escape artist is good for breaking contact.
---
It doesn't matter for you at all then
---
What legendaries did you go for and any good ? Working late yesterday so only had a quick half hour to dip into game before bed but seemed ok
---
let's wait till we got a freezing modifier. this shit is annoying af.
---
Nope sure don't.
---
I'm really starting to wonder if the issue is enemy *armor rating* scaling too high for enemies like Mole Rats. I can understand them having more HP, but if they're getting armor on top of that, it might explain why people are having so much trouble dealing with things that shouldn't be so difficult.
---
Ayy, welcome in the demotivation club. Will not touch fo76 again until Beth gets her shit together. If it dies eventually, it dies, nothing I could do about it. I invested so much time and energy already in games that were utterly destroyed and eventually shut down by their developers or publishers. If fo76 survives and the endgame becomes actually enjoyable in the long run, I may return, but Bethesda even drained me of my fucks to give about this game.
---
Here's my jumbles mess of cards. I wanted to go for damage with non-automatic rifles, like how i've always played other fallout games.
---

---
I didn't say it was. I'm not inferring here. Just making conversation
---
I have fully kitted builds of every major build its just the simple fact that it I kill a higher level enemy the loot should be better and just like when you went to the cranberry bog or mire before to loot better resources they should now have better resources for high level players everywhere now including event rewards.
---
Do you care about the crops bug? I dont, let people have fun with their camp builds, having to pull up the map 10x every time I want to fast travel, that does 'slightly' annoy me
---
And if were going by time, the flamer range bug, that when u have a long barrel and most damage nozzle, the range resets to short range every time you login because of the nozzle, that bug has been in since release of FO4, ... No eta...
---
That's gonna be so fun lol
---
Even then, it's a wash. I have the new Ammo Factory perk maxed out, and while it's nice to make hundreds of Ultracite 5.56 rounds at a time, I'm also using hundreds of rounds in boss fights.
---
Hoh, damn.  Hope you got Workman's Comp for that.
---
They're on the 2nd floor. The quest is supposed to give you markers, if it doesn't, unequip it an re equip it. One is all the way in the back on the 2nd floor in a store.
---
Now THAT would be dope
---
I dunno... When I built 120 at a time in Posideon I’ve noticed the occasional stutter when I was in the area. But then again, the game stutters more than the Tourette’s kid with a lisp.
---
I checked yesterday evening and i still see the 12 presets AND can still save them. Maybe this game update uses the same memory adresses as a few updates ago?
---
Yes I am! I have an external SSD because it cuts the load times in half. So if I transfer game to internal and then back to external you think that would work?
---
Momma has all the rolling pins. She is a real foodie at heart.
---
Some are laughing that there are so many complainers and it is good that this will get rid of them.  Seems like a strange business model.
---
That's what happens when you institute a blanket nerf like dmg multiplication without actually buffing anything. This patch changed nothing at all about the "endgame", it just made the game even harder for people not using meta builds.
---
I’m skipping Daily Ops today and every other day when the enemies have stupid and lazy mods.
---
Hold up there, buster. The Free States aren't Communists. 
---
If anything, they were secessionist Americans who disagreed with how the government was handling things. They were afraid that the U.S government working with Vault-tec would lead to no good. (And they were right)  
---
You fell for the propaganda campaign staged by the U.S government to make it seem like the Free Staters were commies. They never had an inherent political ideology because they were so few in number. 
---
The Free States were one of the last bastions of protection from the wasteland after the bombs and many of those who spoke against them would come to them for help. They secured Harper's Ferry and raised a militia to defend the town. 
---
We can even see evidence of the Free States hating the "Reds", as well. We come across a Free States Gutsy who tells us that "When the Reds come, you can rely upon the Free States." 
---
Case and point: Free States aren't Communists.
---
If you get hit with energy weapons you have a chance (based on perk card level) to recharge your fusion cores
---
I've got bloodied knuckles I keep for the resilant mobs in the new daily thing, I soloed it in 25 minutes dying at least 40+ times thankfully its only a 3 second respawn time. My bloodied explosive minigun still takes down most mobs but with a few extra rounds needed. Problem is everything hits me more so I die often. Gotta figure out what the new build meta is, probably sneak
---
I did it yesterday for the first time, and didn't make initiate, but I still got a 2* Zealot Grenade launcher.
---
So I had a good time with the update last night. I run solo the new daily ops just with an vampire swing speed fire Axe several times and in general I'm a heavy gunner with no trouble. Just put together a solid build and you will have a smooth time. 
---
Lil tip from me. Heavy Explosiv weapons like the auto grenade launcher, rocket launcher ect are almost zero effected by the 'nerf' because they didn't really benefit from anything beside demolition expert (perk). My two shot auto grenade launcher still one or two taps most mobs! Didn't work against the raid bosses but everything else get nuked.
---
Shit if it was PC that was probably me.
---
Yes, nothing would be stopping you, in fact getting a set of unyielding (or even a couple of pieces) could offset any negative effects from your addictions.  You just have to deal with the smaller health pool, but it will work.  Nothing in Bloodied prevents you from having addictions.
---
Absolutely. First time I've ever had to deal with workman's comp, so it's def an experience
---
The Free States presided over the most prosperous free trade town for over seven years. Not "the day they left their bunkers".
---
I'm a junkies pa heavy gunner. Went with follow threw, electrical absorption, and luck all maxed out. What rads at r3, and sizzling style n funky duds at r1
---
Edit, ment taking on for the team not follow threw
---
they should also get a 30days ban.
---
I mean, you've played encryptid before havent you? Should tell you all you need to know about some of the people who just blindly show up to events with no clue what they're doing! Why did we expect anything less!!?
---
The resilient mechanic still is shit though regardless. Such a lazy way to add difficulty to the mission. The daily ops seem pretty disappointing. I'd take even the vault raids over this any day. At least they were more interesting than just, go to place, press button, wait
---
Thanks. Ill focus more time on the 2nd floor.
---
The primary purpose of Daily Ops is to get the Daily Op reward.  I’ve never seen anyone suggest that repeating Daily Ops is a good way to gain XP.
---
My furious 25fr 15crit .50cal and anti armour 40b 25vats gatling gun would suggest otherwise
---
I only use my bloody 40b 90% .50cal when I'm under 50% health
---
Fuck, haven't touched the game since week one of season 1, as I don't like the battle pass at all, but hearing stories like this make me want to return even less lol.
---
It’s not the only “viable” way. Ammo Smith plus ammo factory plus super duper can get you a lot of ammo depending on what you use.
---
Upvoted for the obscure song reference!
---
What economy? Once upon a time, an economy *might* have existed. But beta dupes destroyed it before your time.
---
Tonight 4 lvl 50s Mutants in 10 min. It is a joke. You are supposed to be able to use your camp. Build a home blah blah blah. Now it seems I may just say screw it scrap it all and go somewhere new. Yes I knew this was a possibility as I am in a busy area. It is just a pain in my butt
---
Free States town is more likely.
---
Time to get good lol. You should of played at launch like most of us 😂😂🤣. (What a baby)
---
I agree. It’s a clunky point, but I think we get their meaning. 
---
I’ve just yet to see anyone say that repeating Daily Ops over and over is a good source of XP.
---
Heavy guns and commando are viable, nothing else is!
---
Oh no! I also did that event with 2 other players level 36 and 48. Each of us were downed at least once by the large wave of rad toads. Which was lovely for a “very easy” event!
---
I use to play it from time to time but it's a seziue inducing nightmare with lag so I tend to skip it.
---
Usually there's already 50 bug reports about it by now. The reason you're still waiting is because they extensively tested it on PTS, which I didn't even hear bugs about on there. Any new content new to the game is improving it over time, are you saying you don't want this game to ever get am update again? I think Bethesda deserves praise for any step in the right direction especially when people are shitting on them so hard
---
I see I see, Im def going to be grinding for unyielding so I can switch to a full on bloodied
---
I downvoted you just because you asked for it. You’re welcome!
---
should there not be a cost to respecing..?
---
okay thank you, I am running a sneak perk so I guess I will change it out now.
---
I got down to 1 enemy he spawned stuck in a wall. No more game for me. Wasted an hour and a half, 40 stim packs and more ammo I can count
---
#DownVote
---
A fast Knife is good to have for daily ops that require melee to kill the enemies.
---
As a berserker main going for life saving could work but since you’re very very squishy you’ll go past the threshold and literally die before getting downed in most cases. Unless they make the damage more than bloodied even with the nerfs berserkers would struggle
---
Seriously, I've hardly noticed a difference,  queen seems easier now, only problem I've seen is a guy killed a teammate and i without either of us attacking him first, just shot us in the back and took our loot 🤷‍♂️.
---
I thought the same thing earlier but then I realized how many chems I carry around and don’t use. The only chems I use are stimpaks, radaway, and disease cures, everything else goes to the vendors. Beneficial to those that use tons of chems or carry around 100 stimpaks, but I only carry about 20 stimpaks 10 radaway and 10 disease cures at any given time.
---
I welcome death but I don't think many will stick around if cazadores were added now lol
---
lvl 75 assoultrons? I’m deleting the game this is too much
---
The thing about Valley Galleria that screwed me over a number of times thinking the quest marker was broken, is that the quest marker actually is around the corner to the left as you go inside in that long extension of the building. Except when you turn that way it seems to be marking the door you just entered and it used to confuse me thinking it was directing me back outside again.
---
It works, but the juggling kind of sucks in my experience.
---
Didn't have much time last night. Played for about an hour.
---
Joined an ACP event. Used more ammo than before but not THAT much more.
---
Level 100 enemies out wandering the world. Pretty awesome.
---
Killed some level 50 mutants in the toxic valley. Super psyched about that.
---
Bloody melee was hit pretty hard but since I don't use any melee perks I wasn't expecting much.
---
Didn't get a chance to mess around with legendary perks. Got 250ish level ups banked. Gonna take a decent play session to level up and scrap cards.
---
All in all... Pretty happy with patch 22.
---
Tip: You dont need a melee weapon. Just bash them with your weapon when they have just a slither of health left.
---
Totally in the same boat as you. I’m a new level 20 player too, and I now find it so odd that a clean sneaked headshot from a sniper rifle won’t kill anything my level. Way too punishing and honestly way less fun than it was.
---
I seen this happening before before the update a couple times and i thought it was pretty cool to randomly see that many mobs fighting eachother and me getting involved felt like a "wild wasteland" type of encounter.
---
Yes i can imagine that after the update it will probably be a nightmare but still cool and quite of a different experience than what we used to. Why would we have to just run and mindlessly kill everything on sight? Stuff like this would make us think before engaging...it might worth it or it might not and that is pretty cool IMO
---
I haven't tried without but I feel just having 1 chameleon does alot to you stealth.. I can bump into wendigos and Earle/SBQ without being noticed
---
The other day I died with Earl. Spawned all the way out to bum fluff nowhere. Traveled back and one of the two players of had taken 3 of my flux plus junk like what was found in the event so not much. I went to both their camps and they had clear signs that neither was in need of flux or junk.
---
Ammo factory is going to make it that much easier for anyone with ranged weapons to go to ultracite. 900 5mm/.50 per batch, what’s not to like?
---
Lolol ok.....
---
can somone tell me what they did exacly  ? higher lvl enemies are beefier ?
---
If no one can see you, you don't need fancy atom shop outfits. This makes Todd angry....
---
What are you talking about? Stealth's been Bethesda's firstborn for the like last 2 years and we were doing like 5k damage per headshot with a full auto rifle till yesterday
---
Sounds peffect for you , I’m opposite build bloodied commando no power  armour ( never have liked wearing it in any fallout because of the helmet display)  , think I’m going to go for extra special points so I can swap around weapons when I feel like playing with  a 50cal or a shotgun or guass mini , I’ve muled a few junkies in the past because I’ve considered it but that unyielding armours just too good
---
Sir, you can no longer place any blueprints containing the ammo factory sir!
---
Guess I know what my third legendary perk is
---
This happened to me when wastelanders released. Unfortunately I have not been able to get anything back.
---
That... Might have been me. All but 3 locked with level 0 locks and the “master” terminal locked level 3?
---
Bug fixed in the update yesterday!
---
Go back into atom shop and re check your emotes, had this happen a couple of weeks ago myself. No idea why it happened though
---
I'm glad I did a little homework before spending my precious perk coins
---
I have had all of my emotes suddenly unequip before.  Head into the atom shop, go to emotes and enable all of the ones you own, should be a check box on them if they are enabled.  If they are enabled already then idk.
---
I didn't say anything about the daily ops. I read the side panel before entering so I knew exactly what I was expecting.  Talking more like, Whitesprings and Westek
---
Because having 800 reduced weight weapons is unrealistic. Nobody’s gonna have that much items in their stash, most people probably have at the most 10-20 reduced weight items, at that point you’d have so many normal items you’d have to use a mule.
---
When I say I'm in the middle of nowhere, I mean nobody knows my camp spot almost. Theres nothing near it. Just a look over The Mire.
---
You might try the Free States Vendor at Whitesprings, as well as the other vendors there, too.
---
All they gotta do is tweak the explosives prefix to something else an apply it all current weapons in the game that is energy and has explosives on it. Not that hard to do really.
---
I just want everyone to understand t hey don't care about us one bit. 2 years is time enough to prove this for most people.   
---
I noticed about a year or so ago, this sub became insanely defensive against any and all criticisms mostly due to how bad the blowback was, repeatedly for a year straight. But it's still shocking to me when i see - score on posts, with very valid complaints.   
---
It's clear to me that in all things in life, ALL THINGS, people CHOOSE to remain ignorant on things. It's not a comprehension problem so much as cognitive dissonance and it makes me literally ill lol.
---
I think this patch is the best patch of the game so far.
---
Probably not but then life is not black and white and its perfectly fine for people to like something yet still have issues with it. I'm happy with the update too. Does that mean I think daily ops is well implemented or a fun challenge - hell no. 
---
The people that blindly defend everything in this game are just as bad as the ones who moan constantly. The ones that defend Bethesda against criticism are way worse than both though.
---
Love post patch days on here. All the drama!
---
You’d only need 20.
---
And do you have any proof of this?
---
This is where I was stuck. Thanks!!
---
I hadn’t considered the atom shop unequiping them, thanks!
---
I have a bloodied commando, and ran West Tek yesterday - I still was able to sneak around just fine and kill most in 1-2 shots (more for bosses or legendaries).  Even the dogs couldn’t really detect me.  Also did fine in a run at Fort Defiance against the ghouls. 
---
Perhaps the robots had a buff?
---
Sounds interesting! I might have to borrow your idea.
---
I hope so. I'd check that they're back before you transfer back over to external but fingers crossed!
---
I had something similar, but only the emotes from the atomic shop were missing. The default one were still there. Had to go in the atomic shop and select them. After that they came back
---
Everyone deserves that not just fallout 1st
---
"I have so much ammo, why can't I sell it?"
---
"When will they let me exchange ammo for the ammo I want like in NV?"
---
"They didn't fix the game, they just made the enemies harder to kill by being bullet sponges. Now I don't have ammo!"
---
This sub over the past few years. Gamers are so dainty.
---
In my defense you never said what weapon you used. Now that I know it’s a Gatling laser I can more readily help you. You can farm fusion cores at the three different power plants on the map. These locations will have a fusion core generator, that will generate up to three cores. I forget how long it takes though. I just buy my cores off of players now. The perk power user will also double the ammo capacity on your cores when you use Gatling lasers. It’s in the intelligence tree.
---
Lol, another Fallout 4 core game thing unlocked in 76! I still do not think it will help Melee builds ATM.
---
I don't think you guys realize how small the studio is that works on fo76 compared to how big the game is. The campfire glitch is probably way easier to fix and higher on the to do list because its been there since release. Do you even consider they're probably working hard on the respawn glitch but its so complicated and their engine is so bad its taking them some time? You all act like bethesda can wave a magic wand and fix anything they want to, while in reality fallout 76 barely gets support from main bethesda and theyre using an engine thats like 10 years old. Bethesda isnt just deciding not to fix gamebreaking bugs to hurt you, they probably just cant at this time.
---
Stealth should only be impacted in the Daily ops, outside, there should have been no changes.
---
Exception, higher level enemies having the perception leveled up (This is normal) but with the new higher levels they can get to, that might cause stealth to struggle.
---
ive been saying that too,
---
I don't care if someone uses the crops on fireplace trick, or the flamethrower trick to mesh things together, this leads to interesting and really nice camp builds, but no, that's what Bethesda spends resources on... why?
---
while yesterday, I had to retry fast traveling 5-15x each time, really fun having to pull the map up 10x on average and losing 5min per fast travel, its a lot worse for me than before patch... and at the SBQ, I died just after her, but before the event ended (damn u sneaky mirelurk king) and I couldn't respawn.... thought they fixed that?
---
Just have fun and do what you want. You don't need to worry about items til lvl 45-50. 
---
The only thing you might want to do by lvl 25ish is figure out what type of wepons and play styles you like the most, but it's not a requirement.
---
Ah right, that may have been the case, il make sure to check if it happens again, thanks for the heads up
---
Good point.  You also made me realize I can finally move my survival tent.
---
You sure you were in the event? Sometiems you don’t register and are there but not in event. Has happend to me a few times at SBQ and the strangler heart event in the mire.
---
I had recently tweaked to a weird hybrid high S/P model where I can swap between Shottys/Rifles/Auto Rifles pretty easily.  I wasn't one tapping too many things but could drop things reasonably quick.  It's definitely a noticeable difference from the bit I played yesterday.  Super Mutants were definitely extra annoying. I didn't try any Robots or SBQ/Earle to have an idea there but I definitely felt nerfed.
---
The only counter I will say is that roaming lower areas definitely was a bit more satisfying to actually have to pay attention to kill some things.  The Tea Time event with two people was actually a bit of a challenge.  That being said, I see why they added the legendary ammo card as it'll be a necessity for anyone that's not melee at this rate.  I hope there's a bit of an adjustment.
---
I wonder if they fixed the shotgun bug with this update.
---
And they fix part of it every update
---
My non bloodied build thats unarmed can still kill scorchbeast in about 10 hits.
---
So long and thanks for all the fish
---
Some no-brainer suggestions that'll give a good boost without changing much of the feel of the build.
---
* Start over with rifleman perk. What you want is 1 rank of each rifleman card, not 3 ranks in one. You basically left 10% damage bonus on the table for no reason.
---
* Same as the above with shotgunner and gladiator
---
* You're probably better off picking at most 2 weapon types to focus your build on. The game now especially doesn't favour a jack of all trades
---
* You have a lot of dead weight cards. Some include:
---
   * Sturdy frame
---
   * Strong back
---
   * Dromodary
---
   * Ghoulish
---
   * Aquaboy/girl &lt;- how often do you encounter irradiated water you can't easily navigate around
---
   * Either cannibal OR good doggy (pick 1)
---
   * Lone Wanderer (you should be a part of a public team for the bonus XP and occasional shared perk card, even when solo)
---
   * First aid
---
   * Armorer and Scrapper (whilst in combat)
---
   * Can Do
---
   * Good with salt
---
* Cards to consider as replacements
---
   * More weapon damage perk cards
---
   * Tank killer for AP for rifles
---
   * Blocker
---
   * Max rank senendipity
---
   * Bloody mess if you can afford it (should be picked last over main weapon perks)
---
   * Stealth perks if you use sneak attacks
---
It's not a comprehensive list but it should get you further along having a viable build
---
I said essentially a glitch. They’ve said they didn’t intend the damage to stack like that and now theyve fixed it. End of story. Go cry in your pillow.
---
Or it went from completely over powered, to properly powered...🤷‍♂️
---
That is a game with online play but it isn't an online game as far as I'm aware.
---
Found the vid, many thanks
---
If only main bethesda would give them a little help and not use a 10+ yr old engine
---
Say for instance you did build it in your camp. If you had one on the roof for example, the game would not allow anything in your camp to be placed and force it into an unplaceable blueprint. It’s unplaceable because it *contains* an ammo factory. Same applies to the blueprint of the ammo factory itself.
---
This is what I do. Junkies commando but I keep low health for Adrenal reaction, nerd rage and unyielding boost.
---
Even my zappy tesla gun lost it zappyness...
---
I like your discussion skills, just like talking to a carpet
---
150 atoms :P
---
Since multiplicative damage is out the window bloodied builds are now resorting to multiplicative exaggerated complaints because in 2020 if you can’t one shot everything a game is “too hard” or “too grindy” for them. On the bright side, if they switch over to a still-viable full health build they might get to experience what it’s like to not die from a one shot themselves. There’s a whole new game out there if you stop crouching and start fighting!
---
That's good to hear. I knew about the instanced interiors but hadn't heard the other part. Thanks.
---
The game needs a loot corpses in an area command.
---
Haha yes!
---
Lvl 17 here, you should've seen me yesterday near riverside manor. Came across a pack of 6 wolves, took out my trusty 40mm launcher, shot 5 or 6 in the group and at least 2 direct hits... Nothing, it barely dented their health. Now there's 6 wolves running at me while i'm panic jumping and running trying to switch to my 7 feet long suppressed pump action shotgun. Anyway, i almost died and got lock joint.
---
Not going to lie. This scaling of the enemies probably will kill this game for me. It's just not enjoyable anymore going to the forest and killing the same high levels in the bog region.
---
Rip fun.
---
The number of people crying that their super OP build in now just really strong is insane.
---
Huh, didn’t know about that perk, will get that as soon as possible!
---
radio silence
---
Trying to get people to play more when they have to farm more mats for ammo. 
---
I wonder what is gonna be most duped next dupe wave lmao ...
---
you'll have my ehternal gratitude...
---
You expect Bethesda to make a good balance change, not gonna happen sadly.
---
I have seen a few shotgunners around but I suspect they are there to cripple more than anything
---
 I'll have to spec my shotguns in for a try again I've got a bloody double and an instigating combat I haven't used for months
---
I have been mostly running around with only 1 heavy gunner damage card on except for SBQ and other tough fights. ( Probably an indication of the power of heavy gunner and the 45% armour ignored with stabilised) given how much armour enemies seemed to gain
---
The enemies in areas like the forest are still weaker. I defended Gorge Junkyard and my turrets did all the work for me, compared to other areas where they can’t handle the enemies.  Shoot, ghouls will even say “Weak” ghouls
---
So the risk of a level 50 in the forest is not the same as the risk of a level 50 in say, Savage Divide or Mire
---
Im on 698 rad resist with What Rads and i inky take 12 rads in the nuke zones. If i have power srmor on i heal rads.
---
Well it is clear from both Bethesda' resources(patch notes), developers comments(on balancing) and the community that a major nerf just happened not much of a discussion there. Its fact.
---
Don't feel bad. My food build alt can barely feel the damage nerf. It's just that npcs are stronger now
---
I know where you are. Was wondering about that  area tonight. I know near the hornet is a camp which had super mutants which instantly put me off
---
300's is the new top. One hit is done. Retired my lever action, it was my go to gun. DPS is king now.
---
I had a lot of fun yesterday. But I already played a multi weapon character.  Anyone locked into one role was not having much fun.
---
ops change daily so every op that day should be same
---
I'm sure at this point you aren't going to start using PA all of a sudden, but the helmet display can be turned off in settings.  It looks just like using regular armor except adds a fusion core meter next to the health bar.  I don't like the PA hud either.
---
Xbox? Pumping out 5.56? Hopefully you enjoyed the free ammo.
---
I'm with you a hundred and 10 percent. I think all the enjoyment went away with the enemy scaling. 
---
They straight killed the fun. Level 100 mutant hound? Like ohh fucking k bethesda..
---
You do realize that the way you phrased your comment that the clueless lips refer to yours?
---
Are you on xbox? I can help you do it.
---
Yeah, as a stealth sniper I got absolutly ruined.  I was lucky enough to get into a team with a guy running a gatling laser to carry me, but yeah, I won't even try any ops with that must kill with melee mod.  It's horribly unfun, especially for a slow shooting build like mine.
---
The magic glitch is intact so shotguns only just work, but only in vats.
---
Magic heavy kills faster than it ever did pre nerf!
---
So no nobody who knows the game is finding they do more damage today.
---
The people suffering the most I feel are the jack of all trade and the ones that went all in with the food build with max carry weight
---
That and no matter what they fix you all complain anyway, they fix crops you bitch about "more important bugs", they fix important bugs and you bitch about "the huge backlog of bugs since release"
---
As much as this sucks, this event would be broken as hell if you could stealth through it and ignore the enemies while the uplinks fill up.
---
There are definitely situations where other builds have gotten shafted, too, like melee when the SBQ never landed. I think it's helpful to have different loadouts for different events, and for Ops, you may need to figure out some more survivability. Maybe bring a Vampire's weapon.
---
I think OP is admitting as much. With “I know I did”.
---
This doesn’t make sense to me at all. The enemies are scaling to their level and that level is so low that the game is not expecting them to be even remotely set up with perks, etc. 
---
I’ve seen several low level players praising one wasteland so I’m not sure where this is coming from.
---
i have no idea but im up voting for more visibility just in case
---
Top of Seneca Rocks is the answer 👌
---
8:39 myself . So close. If I didn’t over shoot some of the mobs right before the end boss I woulda had it. Instead I jumped too high and fell in the water underneath and took me forever to get back up. I like it so far. I think the nerf was way over blown. I didn’t even have to adjust my perks that much. I died a lil bit more than before but was fun. I’m bloodied unarmed btw
---
well thats good. lol
---
Now *THAT'S* a good question...
---
I ment taking one for the team not follow threw. It's a great all around perk and I would highly recommend it
---
I’ve had “relocating” markers in that area for awhile.  The marker would even indicate I needed to leave the building, then it would send me right back in.  When I would go down the off hallway and go around the second floor the marker would switch to the correct spot.
---
wait its my cake day?!?! yaaaaaas
---
You could submit a ticket.....
---
[https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10)
---
This will bring it to their attention.
---
Glitching through walls is easy. I'd take down the vendors.
---
You'd think so! And with the level scale up of enemies, their stealth detection has gotten better. The key is using suppressed weapons to stay hidden, and because the fire rate is so high, you can usually unload enough into enemies to kill them before they figure out what's going on.
---
tbf how many shots of a gun do you think it would actually take to kill a whole SWARM of bees? Yeah I like totally 1-shot those bees...
---
I'm not impressed. Everything is lvl50 minimum, but I haven't found anything crazy high level yet. And from these higher level mobs the loot doesn't seem like it's better as they promised. Plus they didn't release the perk loadout thing which would be super handy for this perk system change. The score system also didn't improve much as they promised, there's one extra daily (but the levelup task gives half the point), so the only change is the extra weeklies, inexchange thanks to One Wasteland, I'm sure tasks gonna be harder to do overall.
---
if this get wooshed can I be blue?
---
Everything about this update was an improvement.
---
Im not sure if its strong or not i just tried to 1 hit kill a beast didnt work it was like 5 hits
---
Ok, that’s kind of what I was hoping.  I’ve been avoiding farming nuke zones since I’ve gotten so comfy with my Backpack &amp; WR legendary armor.  Switching to PA or Hazmat and I move so slow and lose other benefits it just didn’t feel worth it. 
---
And worse case, What Rads will help with my endless ghoul hunting
---
Feeling sorry for the players who were effected the least, lol
---
Probably won't get fixed. The game looks at your base CHA stat for deciding how many Perk points worth of cards you can share. The Legendary CHA card doesn't change that base stat, it just adds on top of it like a temporary buff.
---
Another English teacher on reddit. Thanks for the comment. You do realize your comment makes it look like you have -1 in Perception right?
---
I hear you on the bloodied stuff. I felt like it was too strong relative to the other builds so I never really dipped my toes into it. Honestly the damage wasn't outlandish until you pair with the the frickin potentially 15 special points to all categories from unyielding. IMO that was the OP component.
---
Full health junkies is nice though. You can get find reasonably priced tanky armors to augment the good damage output. Really versatile across all of the content, since you can stand up and fight if sneaking isn't going to happen.
---
Good luck!
---
Junkies is magic in itself so you're wrong...
---
Yeah I understand it's just in theory. Look im house bound unfortunately so this is my only outlet. I adore this game, even though it drives me mad at times.  There a ways to improve the stash limit that have been suggested loads of times. This is just a theory that they could if they looked into it I appreciate you thoughts to thank you.
---
Dont eat the food! It was to be In your inventory to count as bonus dmg.
---
They don't stack, he's wrong.
---
Except that enemeis are dying dramatically faster now than they were before, taking doen level 50 enemies in 2 or 3 shots instead of 10 to 20, its a very dramatic increase in damage or a decrease in enemies damage resistance
---
Is there? I havent ventured around it much
---
Yeah the only weapons I have that are worth a damn anymore are a Bloodied Fixer and Furious Flamer but they aren’t really my build. Sucks. I don’t wanna change everything again.
---
It's an artificial type of difficulty that's punishes players for either having the wrong build (or, in a lot of peoples' case, being too low level to have enough damage adding perk cards) or not enough ammo.
---
This kind of thing might work if perk cards weren't gated in the way that they are. When I'm only level 33 and wanting a heavy weapons build, all I can do is add points to STR and wait for the perk cards to eventually come to me, occasionally getting random cards from the perk packs you get.
---
I get what they were going for with the perk system, but it just feels like it doesn't work with the new level scaling system.
---
Xp farm here I come
---
As a tank build with just the core damage perks and take one fore the team maxed out, I'm having zero issues killing stuff. It really did not effect my damage at all. Yes the enemies are tougher but Is nothing crazy at all. I also mostly use AA weapons. My friend who is a bloodied build did get hit harder but even he was like yeah makes sense and is still destroying stuff with ease. Even the daily ops which was a hard counter to bloodied stealth builds he just used a melee weapons with no melee perks and finished enemies off and we completed it on the highest tier no problem.
---
Reading these posts about people struggling just shows how easy the game was and that, at least half the players on reddit, are really really bad at the game. I've been playing since the beta and watched as the game became trivial. Now its a bit better, just be lucky for you all they didn't bring PvP back then it would be like the old days.
---
Its a wasteland folks not a hiking trail, adapt and survive. Natural selection is back in fallout!!!
---
Five minutes in a workshop and it was mine.
---
Thanks for the tip 👍👍
---
I thought TSE was doing better then bloodied right now. Angry turtle did a video on the new damages.
---
What's a shame though is I like seeing what combinations people come up with but I guess that's the plight of RPGs really, do you for looks or for stats? Lol
---
I have an executioners explosive Gatling laser and apparently I missed the memo about them carpet bombing stuff
---
cuz they aren't doing like any damage lol at least I can still melt almost anything still fairly quick
---
Yeah, i don;t wanna ditch stealth, but I really don't think that it really does anything.  My sneak attacks to less than vats headshots, and I get detected even on adventure servers almost constantly, so what exactly is the point?
---
Doors can be glitched through without picking locks. I assume it's still present in patch 22.
---
It took me a while to kill boss with my bloodied mole miner, and I one shot most other robots. A while meaning more than 20 hits maybe ? The issues I had as bloodied melee was dying so often xD  
---
However on my PA Heavy I absolutely smooshed big boi boss with a 2shot Limb gatling and am sad I missed an epic fight. He just crumbled and then I tickled him with my super sledge.   
---
Also switching to melee to kill an enemy thats on 1hp but still shooting me and stumbling etc, is really hard to do as an aussie with Im guessing 280 ping. Favourites menu isnt cooperating with me haha
---
I’ve tried it with a couple of builds, it didn’t feel that bad.  I was doing ok.  And after watching Angry Turtle, looks like I might bring back some of my explosive weapons like my TSE shotgun
---
Did my very first one solo with just a single piece of Troubleshooter armour. It was 'interesting' especially when the L100 Assaultron Dominator Boss opened up with its guns and laser with almost no respite. 
---
Now Im always carrying at least 3 pieces so if a team mate starts the event I nolonger have a panic attack. Looks like a lot more SS crafting to get a full set before I solo again vs bots.
---
yes the actual prefix but I was referring to actual builds
---
Taking one for the team is a must have imo. All extra damage is welcome
---
Absolutely. It was nice being able to chill in the forest one shotting everything when I wanted down time away from high level stuff. This change is bad. There should be exceptions for lower danger enemies like rad stags and small bugs/vermin.
---
Not even for the weight bench?
---
Gauss works almost as effectively as it did before the additive change. They are still my favorite rifle by a large margin. Semi-automatic Railways that are not instigating were...never that great. A BE, sure, but JE? Not even if you primed it. Quad Automatic Railway is where it's at!
---
Context: Full Health Junkie's Super Hybrid Build: 12-12-9-9-13-15-11
---
I haven't noticed that myself. Honestly I often do tap shots to the head in vats for most things, so I probably wouldn't likely notice it anyway. With a run of daily ops I didn't notice anything either, but again with the resilient modifier I wouldn't really be counting shots. When I get home I'll see if I can reproduce it.
---
Non meta builds are the ones hardly affected since the change was damage modifiers and not damage directly. Builds with a lot of damage modifiers (bloodied) are the ones seeing big decreases.
---
They didnt change enemies DR in one wasteland while scaling but this in no way negates nerfs or makes enemies die faster than before they still have much bigger health pools.
---
What are the daily ops? And how does one find them?
---
They don't. You have to finish them off melee but the way you bring the health down to 1hp is up to you. Basically, shoot, gun bash, done.
---
Someone is still playing NW? Kudos for the dedication, my dude.
---
I've just put walls all round no doors now if that want in that badly nothing I can do might swap everything to a different character so all.my outfits are safe.
---
Considering junkies just requires getting addicted to 5 things... yes
---
I can think of about 3 balances/buffs  over the life of this game. So no, not really.
---
yes but we still dish out the highest dps of the builds
---
The ammo crafting perk. Making 400 308 at a time was a surreal experience
---
Oh i love the new content. The only thing i don't like about this patch is my bloodied mmg went from 1440 damage to 440. Other than that yeah its great.
---
If you have a friend and rad sponge you can easily survive in a nuke zone now.
---
I had a 2 shot explosive 10 mm and a bow that was super fun to mop up those low level mobs but both are basically useless now. O well all the other balance changes are very welcome.
---
I think you need something like 4000 or 5000 rad resist to get the 60 rad/sec in a nuke zone down to the 6 rads/sec that you can heal with What Rads. Since RadShield stacks with itself (or at least it used to, last I checked) this is technically possible but may not be economically feasible since you'd need to swallow around 11-12 RadShield to get there, including all the other sources of RR that you mention.
---
Need to change it back, fuck this enemy scaling bullshit. Bethesda listen to this one..
---
Oh no??
---
Giant thumbs up.

---
I use a level 40 Dragon to open the fight, most of the time with a VATS critical.  
---
Then I switch to my non-legendary Hunting Rifle with a .50 cal receiver.  
---
I use the Chinese Stealth Armor with the Escape Artist perk means that 90% of the time I'm doing 2.5x crits with normal shots from Covert Operative and almost always being in stealth from the suit.  
---
About 1 in 4 shots my crit meter is full and I can switch to the Dragon to do massive damage.  
---
For the "fodder" enemies I just scope head shot them from a distance or use VATS if I can't get far enough away.  
---
Hopefully the RNG gods will let me get a beast 3-Star but so far nothing great.
---
Adapting to bloodied shouldn't be the only solution for players though. There were options before for viable full heath builds for players to be able to do be just as effective as bloodied players at killing mobs outside of events. There just isn't that availability now
---
I guess lol
---
I’m with you, but then again I’m a casual player who was always too lazy to stack dmgs. I played for a couple of hours yesterday and had fun. I noticed a few of my guns took more bullets, but it wasn’t that drastic for me and I have so many ammo perks that making more is breezy. My main weapon is still a beast, so I can’t complain there. I don’t have much opinion on the lvl scaling right now but I like the XP it gives me. All the stuff they’ve added makes up for the nerf, at least for me.
---
Chicken coops makes fertilizer too. I think they added it to the gold bullion vendors since it was a score reward from last season
---
New event, basically a randomized dungeon quest. Open the map, press up on the dpad and you'll find one. The location, enemy and enemy mutation changes every day
---
Well anyway im probably going to change back to rifle
---
They complain when they don’t get their way they complain when they do
---
Lying liar of the lies.
---
Yes I had one, exactly one^^ And a quite neatly thought out camp, that took me a few hours to rebuild yesterday. On the upside: I managed to fix a few glitches that happened during the first building of my camp, so other than not having that god ugly ammo factory (that barely produced any ammo to be relevant since I play .50cal) it also improved my camp layout, win-win :D
---
FYI, if you have the quest and the item in your stash, take it and put it back, apparently that counts. I just took a portable power pack, then the quest updated to “returns Ward’s crap” then I put it back in my stash and turned in the quest
---
Direct Deposit ftw
---
Again, they didn't fix anything, they just changed the damage design. They were no longer happy with the multiplicate buffs? Alright, I can't say anything if they think that's a change for good, but that wasn't a glitch. They chose to made it that way in the first place.
---
Back to my pillow.
---
I am running 1 damage card for heavy gunner 90% of the time and still destroying everything (probably due to stabilised) I took about a 40% hit to my damage vs the queen with my furious .50cal from 17 per shot to 10 with this patch. guess I better find an anti armour .50cal to try
---
1. happy cake day
---
2. assaultron intimidator would like to have a word with you
---
Follow Through and Ammo Factory.
---
Unarmed half or full life is great still
---
yeh but we still dish out more damage
---
Except that it's not a rotating mod, you can't EVER use stealth in ops, you get that right?  SO people who built their character around stealth are never going to have a regular time at OPS.  They could have designed it so stealth characters had a role to play but couldn't just walk through it, instead they just permagimped a whole playstyle, one that wasn't really that relatively strong to begin with.
---
I'm a full health, Heavy Weapons/P.A build dude and to be honest still no issue with high lvl  mobs. Loving the legendary ammo perk - now I'm swimming in .308/5mm/flamer fuel and .50. I'm lvl 316 if that makes any difference.
---
Same. I just miss the big numbers. Mine got hit hard with an 80% drop in damage against super mutants at west tech but it’s still combat effective.
---
Doesn't sound like more of a challenge to me.  Sounds more annoying.
---
I'm a pre-beta player with nearly 2,000 hours into the game.  I don't even want to log in and try this patch.  I liked the game better when it was a barren oddball of an experience anyway.  Now I have to redo my build AGAIN because they changed shit around AGAIN without giving us who've worked so hard on our builds a free respec AGAIN?  
---
Feels like it's pointless to put time into this game as a longterm thing.  You get your build right and get the right weapons and the right armor, and six months later they change things.  Now you need the weapons and armor that you sold along the way, because your current stuff is nerfed.
---
Wake me when they add story content instead of events and grind.
---
the butt of my gun wants to chat also
---
So it only works during pvp. Besides your point, if i turn off scorched earth event after joining i can still pvp while in it. I'm there but no participant
---
ok lol
---
Noticed this too.
---
Yeah, you are misunderstanding. It wasn't 'my' roll, everyone gets this one; swarms of Gutsies backed up by swarms of Robobrains who won't die til you give them a love tap with your melee strike, with no possibility of stealth or tactics. I wasn't even all that mad, outside it nearly turning my friend off even trying them again in the future, just noting it's really bad luck this was the first one the community was exposed to.
---
I’m assuming noon eastern time with the challenges. Or at least that’s when I’m checking. I ran yesterday’s about a dozen times. Resilient gutsies and robobrains got a little tiresome. But my best time was 7:44. Average was about 9 minutes.
---
Go to nukesdragons.com and map out your build for us. Makes it easier to help
---
Glitch-stacked items will prevent the placing.
---
Damn kept a low level combat knife on my main for the same reason, can't remember the effects it had on it, nothing special but I ended up using it enough that I actually used atoms and put a skin on it
---
Yeah I put the one star on just so I can pick lock and Havk with out having to go to my perk cards. Will probably end up getting a different card eventually though.
---
I kept bobbing and weaving between natural cover and was fine.  I don't even wear PA.  Even then I didn't even bother fighting them until the last part,  ran by most of them.
---
I always have a rank 1 infiltrator just to free up the 6 perk slots, thinking of getting funky duds and what rads on all of my builds just because of how useful poison resist is 
---
I went for legendary endurance on my melee character just for the bonus health, but might go for luck on everything else
---
do you run a sneak card?
---
You need to take almost all out of strength and put into perception and knock a few out of endurance and luck to try and get agility maxed out as well
---
yepp. just runned into leader of the pack. was a bit surprised to encounter a group of lv50 wolves in the forest...
---
Cool thanks a bunch. I think with a lot of these perks i had no idea what i'd get next so i just leveled in hopes i'd eventually get something good and equipped whatever i had because I could. There was no real reasoning behind it. I'll keep an eye out for the good ones, and work on that rifleman redo (I just thought leveling it was best policy) I pulled an all nighter trying to figure this out so i'll sleep on it and get back to it tomorrow. Hopefully i can salvage this character ahaha
---
reasonable reply - have an up-vote for what it's worth 😊
---
yeah i’ll have a look cause they seem pretty cool :)
---
I don't mind coins. At least there's something to do now. I had 36 levels stored up, never used because I only rarely want another perk at this point. And it gives us something to do with all the peek packs we get from the season.
---
maybe I'll finally get my wish and bloodied will become unpopular not everyone is the same buid as me
---
Pretty certain there wasn’t any glitch stacking in the blueprint
---
\*whimpers\*
---
...no. W-why would you ask that? It's somehow worse isn't it?
---
Enemy scaling sucks, I don't care what way you sugar coat it. It absolutely took the joy out of the game.
---
I personally enjoyed having my high powered weapon at the ready to do damage in the bog. Still challenging at my level, fun, very fun. Then come back to the forest with my relaxing fun weapons and just kill stuff. Now wtf is the fun in going to the forest to have the same level as the bog? Fix please.
---
Scorchbeasts should never have been something we could one-shot, they were supposed to be one of the apex predators in 76.  We should have needed a handful of hits at worst to kill them.  Seems like it’s where it’s supposed to be now.
---
Just be aware that What Rads? won't allow you to run around in a nuke zone unaffected. Power armor, hazmat suits, and the stealth suit have a hidden 90% radiation  resistance.
---
It's great for the healing though!
---
I dont see how you come to this conclusion. Go do uranium fever now and tell me its less of a risk. Go do a low level mob event and tell me its low risk now...
---
I have yet to experience any of these issues, drop in frame rate or crashes and I run on an original PS4.
---
Watoga is mostly laggy when you're up on one of the buildings with that mayor for a day quest.
---
One level is nice. Seems a bit much to max it
---
&gt;Even a west tek run is tedious
---
Yes, Lvl 231 here and I got whooped by the mutant doggos... 3 times. They used to be so easy to kill. Now, they're actually a threat.
---
another gimmick from FO4 found its way into apalachia...
---
It'd build dependent but a pool of decent perks are:
---
* Hack and slash
---
* Ammo factory
---
* Follow Through
---
* The poison and fire resist ones (mostly the poison one)
---
Also, whatever relevant special helps fill out your build in a meaningful way.
---
Except Charisma. Screw that guy and its inability for it to affect the number of cards that you can share in a team (hopefully a bug and not an intended feature).
---
haha miniguns as limbs go brrr
---
Sounds like you have an older version of PLM installed, update it then you can see it on the map.
---
These last times I've experienced not getting noticed no, I forget to switch for my ammo card 😅
---
I feel like they can afford to nerf the high level enemies a bit
---
Proofs?
---
I've always hated level scaling in areas in any game. Whats the difference with a fight between a level 4 player with level 4 enemy and a level 100 player vs a level 100 enemy? Nothing. Same challenge. It essentially negates leveling entirely.
---
is it really more of a challenge? I'm not using more healing/stims, I'm only using more ammo and time.
---
Bullet Sponge is not challenge.
---
This still isnt the DEVELOPERS fault. You say no one wanted it fixed but someone on this same thread is bitching lmao
---
How did you die at all, I ran it in excavator power armour with reactive plates, 1 weapon damage card, no defense cards and didn't die either time.
---
Both in groups admittedly but I shot them then bashed them to finish them, first run just over 8 mins, second just over 7mins
---
So far mostly positive although there have been a small number of WTF! moments - first encounter within 60s was L50 Molerats than nolonger dropped dead when I looked at them, and the L95 Behemoth at Solomon pond has been upgraded to L100, no biggy except my 4K Instigating Stealth one shot kill Headshots now rack up a mere 700...most enemies are pretty much as before, maybe one or two extra bullets occasionally but no panic. 
---
My very first loop of the the south normally yields 1, maybe 2 legendaries. I got 7! Unfortunately RNG hasn't improved as 2 of the first 3 were Beserkers Gauss rifles, followed rapidly by 2 concecutive M79 grenade Launchers.
---
Lol, it actually isn't as bad as most are making it out to be. I've been a bloodied build on both my main characters forever and yes I took a hit on damage but it isn't game breaking. Just takes an extra bullet to kill something, not that big of a deal. Especially with the ammo drops in the daily ops and ammo factory perk
---
It bugged for me too, we had it too good for too long
---
Perfectly fine bloddied guy here , no need for moral support actually this update allowed me to get some quality of life perks that my build was missing 😃
---
I'm still on the fence about the damage perks, but I put points into ammo factory so fast ha ha. What a huge QoL improvement. I also grabbed master infiltrator and legendary luck. Though endurance is a great idea.
---
Yeah--all of my camps are now defunct.  I wasn't surprised, and I figured it would be taken away at some point...but I wasn't prepared for all of my camps to be taken away.
---
Ok well you are either extremely lucky or you dont play much. My gf has the same issue with freezing on wheel and then disconnecting on a different console(one s) my brother has the same issue.
---
Thank you for the comment I originally just mashed everything into strength based on carry weight being so limited in the game and now because I have the trash box it seems pointless hahaha
---
BAJONETTS. I just say BAJONETTS. never used the bashing with a gun before. luckily i had a bajonett on my gatling gun today...
---
Good to hear!!
---
I'm someone who likes to just casually enjoy the game. I hate this update and will probably not really play at all anymore. I play to unwind from work and life and this is not enjoyable game play for me. I feel like it played similar to the previous games and that's what brought me to play 76. Not everyone wants to be constantly challenged. More time for other games I guess.
---
Dude.... they're scary as fuck now.
---
Your trolling me right?im sorry if your not.i rolled that level 15 hm this weekend 1star for like 10 scrip or something like that
---
I certainly don't have any magic heavies 😥
---
Still using mine.  It's my highest overall damage weapon.  Not by a ton, but still.  Seem to be reading that the worst bloodied builds are still very effective.  Mine (non auto rifle) was never all that great, and my character overall is fairly weak now, and there's really nothing to improve it other than just rebuild the character as something else.    
---
New and low level players are flailing, many already meh non meta builds are weaker than they already were, but at least we pwned those bloodied guys lololol, oh wait they are still doing their thing.  Oooops.
---
Had the same question lol
---
Have you tried the power attack mechanic?
---
Actually my hammer from meat week is better than my blooded unarm weapon.  If i max out those cards i might be in 400
---
Yeah any valid criticism gets downvoted, It’s ridiculous.
---
They haven't figured out what will happen if the game suddenly loses a lot of players yet (i.e. profits drop and support/new content drops right with it or Bethesda makes panic changes to convince people to stay/return).  Of course, maybe nothing happens.  Time will tell.
---
It's fine. They should focus less on the size of their number and more on what they can do with it.
---
They can moan and groan all they want while they're still perched on the top of the build meta.
---
The people that really need a check in are the all-in food builds and the jack of all trades.
---
Oh yeah? How so if you don’t me asking? What perks did you drop for them?
---
Will do not on at the minute but soon as I am i will map it all out on that sight and repost
---
Are you running a bloodied build?
---
I've been running into way more legendary creatures also.
---
Feel better soon!
---
Biggest problem would be strength is too high and perception is too low. This would be cheaper for you if you were willing to commit to go sneak melee instead
---
Everyone was being over dramatic. My Bloodied build is doing fine. Takes 3 shots to kill stuff instead of 1. Not a life changing update
---
An nothing on the walls?
---
I’m rocking my bloodied well enough still. It’s been great for daily ops, but can’t handle bosses at all now. I can’t do squat to Earle or SBQ now. More pissed that Bethesda had the unarmed calculation not working in the PTS and somehow still released that bug after over a month of testing...
---
Same as that. I can't even get close to the robots to melee them before they kill me.
---
Ranged explosion perks, ammo factory, 3 special perks
---
hahaha my health bar goes "o shit"
---
Just swap out!  You don’t have a gun to support it, and there’s 15 levels of perk buying...
---
Eazy peezy
---
Yeah time &amp; resources wasted, It’s frustrating.
---
I get there with my powerfist but I can’t for the life of me get mods for it. Yeah I’m on Xbox
---
Ah, you need the ultra secret 'Ubermensch' code. You'll need to not move at all for 3 months, not at all, never leave your room in vault 76. The vault bots will feed you automatically. Just make sure you take note of the date you try this, you move one pixel and you gotta restart completely. It has to be 3 calendar months too, just dont move at all.
---
See you in three months buddy!
---
👍👍😂😂🤪🤪
---
Yeah same, full health rifleman build/heavy weapons, im hammering out damage now like theres no tomorrow
---
 I mean... My bloodied dcg hits for 380 now while the aa version hits for 330... There is rly no reason to hunt for bloodied melee weapons now, aa and vampire's are much better. At least uny is still good.
---
Ha, I do that type of thing all the time.  Why the heck am I not doing good damage...oh yeah no bloodied mess equipped
---
I use to carry my 10mm quad explosive for groups of mobs and I upgraded to a beautiful Tesla rifle
---
Yes it was taken away even tho I saw the blueprint still was there just had to get rid of it. I thought we would get more ammo from enemies this time but that’s just with daily ops
---
👍
---
haha my health bar goes haha troubleshooter armor go haha no damage
---
Oooohhh, I dunno, maybe a weak feral ghoul shouldn’t be level 50?
---
Setting aside that you sound like a pretentious douche not everyone has a vampire weapon and given that a lot of the people firing endlessly aren't standing near the objective people are probably not going to draw the conclusion that they're secret geniuses that nobody understands. That's great that the vampire strategy is working for you however.
---
As for Encryptid you only have to hit it once to tag it. If they continue shooting it without grabbing any of the pylons for 20 minutes should we again conclude that they are secret geniuses? These are not difficult events to complete.
---
At a certain point in your life your reaction should probably be to stop trying to condescend to people to sound intelligent, it doesn't sound that way to anyone but you.
---
I did Uranium fever yesterday (duo’d with a friend),  yes it was a bit tougher but the 3 supervisors that spawned (all level 100) now dropped max level legendaries, where before they would cap out around 40.  That extra risk was worth the reward of possibly getting items that I’ll actually use, rather than being upset that I got a level 35 legendary that would have been great if it had been max level. The bonus XP was also wonderful, as doing it with a casual team and getting the extra XP I got the 10K weekly multiple times and went up a rank just from that. 
---
Leader of the pack was still stupid easy, I still basically one shot ever wolf and collected 15 scrip worth of weapons with practically no effort.  
---
What little increase in risk is turned into extra XP.  Extra XP = extra SCORE for faster season rewards and extra levels for more perk coins.  Not all the rewards have to be a “physical” item you equip.
---
Please don't assume that I am not reading the complaints. I'm not your average angry mob reddit user. What I'm saying is that I've seen some lower level people saying "Hey this is a sick update I'm enjoying it, not any harder for me" and then I'm seeing other people like what's being reported in this thread and the varied experiences don't make sense to me. I'm wondering what's causing it.
---
I didnt use any special perk cards yet .  I got 4 slots though
---
Wtf is it with these post trying to shame bloodied builds. 
---
Bloodied builds are just fine for fucks sake.  
---
Yes we got hit hard on damage, but shit still dies fast.   I have made no changes to my bloodied build and I went about killing shit just as EZ.   
---
Bloodied is still one of the top damage makers.
---
Hense the reason i asked if other people were getting this, someone else just commebted that they are also noticing their heavy build is killing a lot better then before
---
It is near a mineral deposit. It has a caravan trash park.
---
Bloodied still works just fine. Sure, maybe I have to use three or four more bullets, but my plasma flamer and combat shotgun feel just about the same now.
---
I am a stealth sniper having way more fun. The legendary perks make a huge difference, and farming ammo in the daily ops makes it easy to maintain. It’s not like level 50 enemies are a challenge. I did tea time yesterday and I still one shot everything. I just got way more xp and better loot for it.
---
After reading a bunch of replies, I'm really curious if this is a bug or not. I played a little bit last night and I was having a good time. I was 2-3 shotting enemies with my sniper rifle and my 10mm was taking down ghouls in 3-4 shots, which felt right. I'm level 27 to compare and I know other people around the same level are reporting wildly different experiences.
---
Is everyone who is experiencing the crazy sponginess on a regular server or are people seeing it on the private worlds too? I'm wondering if it just isn't scaling correctly if initially triggered by a higher level player or something like that. I'm going to be able to screw around more today but in my initial test, it was okay for me.
---
I am getting mad stuttering now though but that's another problem.
---
Yeah, that crushed my soul when that happened to me. He probably had a 1* trash for me.... but it could of been something good. I'll never know.
---
I can only imagine how challenging it is for low level players now. I logged in and had to completely rework my character with legendary perks and end game gear to make playing viable. As an end game player I enjoy the patch , but I would be frustrated as hell if I didn’t have everything I do at my disposal. Rip new player base .
---
Yep. In a team, Rad Sponge is clearly the way to go. When solo, stacking RadShield is the only way I know of to get RR high enough.
---
I can finally avoid Cranberry Bog and roam the much better areas without feeling like I typed in IDDQD to the console.
---
Not that I know, [here](https://imgur.com/a/BNVwIk4) is the full blueprint (before I saved it)
---
Yeah, I'm gonna have to move now too. I'll have to check out Seneca Rocks as a location.
---
Awesome 👍
---
Do you see the irony in that statement? :)
---
If you put points in another s.p.e.c.i.a.l. you can move them to charisma and then you can share perk cards.
---
Again, these are for low level characters, when they really can't specialize into anything yet. They especially can't respec if they don't have the perk cards to give them the bonuses they need now. And with everything taking much more time and effort to kill, that next level up is going to take even longer.
---
Probably not by much. I died 14 times before I lost count. Then a PA random joined, and we finished the op. My take-away? Non-optimized builds can't solo these. Not surprising, as they're supposed to be a team effort.
---
Eletrical absorption
---
Master infiltrator
---
What Rads
---
Take one for the team
---
Legendary Endurance and Agility
---
Anything Junkies or Instigating especially if you can mod or boost the damage up to 200+. (Magic!) Doesn’t even have to have a good secondary perk if you can snatch up one of those. 
---
Bloodied, if you’re into that, but Two-shot Explosive with Demolition Expert is gonna rock.
---
you can run down ther is a diffrent way down after it is done. left a bit off the blocked way same as you use to run out
---
I had no problem staying alive, because V/E 50 cal makes you basically invincible.  I'm just questioning the decision to create a timed mission that requires standing in a small space AND enemies that require a melee hit AND who won't close the distance and just sit at range shooting you.
---
The timer for the 8 min, while solo, basically requires that you stand and take it.
---
And reread my final sentence.
---
Yep exactly someone who noticed lol.
---
Lmfao . 99 glitches to debug to from the code , 
---
99 glitches to debug , take one down patch it around,  120 glitches to debug
---
Thank you! I knew there had to be an answer.
---
If someone knows there is empty space behind I believe you can glitch through walls. Just FYI!
---
He didn't have a bounty
---
And they still can't kill you if wanted unless you attack first
---
Angry Turtle just showed how to deal with a load of perks and perk packs at the start of his latest video.. t
---
You forgot the ammo under chemistry like regular fusion core
---
ty =)
---
I have the feeling fire (burning) damage was buffed, at least my ultracite laser with beta wave tuner seems to melt stuff faster now. Might be just imagination, will test it later with/without.
---
No if you hit elder you unlock all 3 rolls for a rare reward. But it's 5%,10%, and 80% for the for rent ranks
---
Ive also found my Lever Action to be suddenly wanting - admittedly its only a Mutant Slayer but it still hit hard and fast until now. It remains useful for Line in the Sand now the Tent Exploit is (probably) history and other mass attacks but I have fallen back on my Instigating 50cal Sniper, slower firing but that bigger first round damage effect is now reborn in general rifleman mode. Elsewhere against bosses its a Bloodied 50cal MG now the LA is weakened .
---
Can anyone on PC confirm?
---
Super Duper. It’s in Luck!
---
Daily Ops are really fun. Loved them on the PTS and I love them on the live servers even more.
---
The contextual ammo system is a god send. No longer am I getting annoyed that shredding mobs with my LMG drops .38 or some other shit. 
---
Enemies no longer dropping underlevelled garbage is amazing. 
---
Higher level mobs = more XP. I'm closing in on level 600, I need every single bit of XP I can get. 
---
Legendary perks. The exploding whatever ones are all hot fucking garbage, Retribution is useless, the rest are fine. Some of them are actually incredible for PA users. We have no backpacks. We have no legendary armor to buff our stats. Some normal perks don't work with PA. It's good to finally see us not getting the short end of the stick.
---
In the end, Fallout 76 is fun again. Thanks Bethesda, keep it up.
---
I heard melee got hit hard too, sounds like a double whammy for you.
---
Yeah I had similar experience on low health enemies
---
Earl and the queen seemed fine with certain times it didnt work
---
Fair enough. I can respect RP reasons: I wear a Silver Shroud outfit on my main, and my alt is going full Mistress of Mystery.
---
300 keeps coming up as the melee damage number. Something feels off about this...
---
There's a big divide between lifers who number crunch and don't actually play the game for narrative or immersion and those who are semi casual and/or enjoy the experience of the game world itself.
---
Uninstalled and haven't played in 3 months, what new update?
---
My Vampire Double Barrell Shotgun still drops all standard enemies with a standard Double Tap. Legendary Enemies take a little more work than they used to but that's ok.
---
It will take me some getting used to.  I did leader of the pack last night and it still caught me off guard having to use several rounds of 5.56 to down just one level 50 wolf rather than just 1 or two lol.  But all in all the update (for me) is great.  I did the daily ops 4 or 5 times and while I never made it to Elder it was still fun once everyone seemed to get he hang of where to go and what to do.  The fastest run I think I had was 8 minutes and 7 seconds.  Personally I hope the meta changes and bloodied builds are no longer the go to build.  Would be nice for people to not feel like they have to choose from only 1 or 2 builds to get good damage output in this game.
---
agree they was talking about all caraters was going to help out with it if I dont remember wrong
---
Jup \^\^. They all kill themselves before I can get to them though(wtf). I mean, i'm sharing revenant, so get revived.
---
It must stay levelled ffs.they cannot expect a 300 levels for every swap.
---
Lvl 17 here, started for the 1st time a week ago but i've played the shit out of previous FO titles, so i can only speak for myself but i can say for sure that the combat is noticably harder but not too hard. I can see however how a fresh out of the vault newbie could hit a dead end wall by running out of supplies. If i can give one advice, stay far away, engage the mobs with long range weapons and try to at least keep one solid object between you and them.
---
It got hit harder than the scorched that are no longer here, or the gouls ands bugs that wouldn’t leave me be
---
I had either a vampires baseball bat or a AA swing speed supa sledge and they were fun to use buy I had to switch to a B axe to do dmg
---
That's because it's heavily implied this is just the first big step in a string of changes they're going to make. It really seems like this whole thing was done to scale bloodied builds back from being able to kill everything in the game with one shot and I'm kinda glad because it just seems like a corny, non-fun way to play the game. Having to stealth kill everything and avoid being hit more than a couple times can't be that engaging.
---
 I think they're taking steps to chop them down from their insane damage numbers so they're close to on par with the other couple viable builds in the future when they hopefully do a fat balance pass on damage resistance and numbers across the board. I run full health PA heavy gunner and my damage seems entirely unchanged. I still kill high level mobs pretty quick and I'm maybe using 10% extra ammo overall.
---
Heh.
---
I run a pretty tight PA build, with Adrenal Reaction. I equip Demo Expert 5, Stabilized 3, Heavy Gunner 9, Grenadier 2, and I throw in some extras just to keep it spicy
---
With my perks I do a solid +60 damage, plus an additional +50 explosive damage. Suppressors allows an additional +45 armor penetration, which is great for bosses. I also have Adrenal Reaction, and a few hundred toxic goo on me at all times. The goo allows me to create a temporary bloodied build, for varying amounts of damage.
---
My weapon of choice is a VE gat plas, which allows me to have cripplingly low health while not dying. As long as I keep hitting, I can't die. Before 22, I could keep a trail fireworks on me and my GP reload would be insane, but they patched that too, rip.
---
On a good, atypical day, I can run with 12-15 damage per pellet on SBQ, with 5-8 pellets per shot. This, with Suppressors, ensures I can do massive amounts of damage in very short time. My base weapon damage before the patch was 127 with 40% health, and it remains 127.
---
Make a new character. Try it yourself. I've seen anecdotes from players that have level 300+ mains who started new characters to play with friends before hand, and are level 30 on those characters who have seen the impact first hand too. I've seen more people mentioned the ammo issue than I have seen people saying it's been great for them. In fact, where are you even seeing people say it's been great for them? Even in threads talking about the overall greatness of the patch, people mention the "One Wasteland" aspect of it not really achieving its intended goal. Love to be proven wrong.
---
Please enlighten me the dozens more coming with this update. I haven't heard or experienced 1. Im not denying its glitchy im just tired of seeing people antagonizing the hard working devs when it's not their fault at all
---
Go look at post there’s a whole bunch of stuff that came. There is one wasteland where every enemy scales up to you, there’s daily ops where it’s like dungeons, and legendary perks
---
Oh yes because "reading" is the problem here, not the fact that you get auto detected and fucking sniped from 20 meters away ("BuT YoU JuSt NeEd To MelEe ThEm") and you literally can't do anything about it unless you are running a power armor full health build.
---
Did it ever occur you that maybe most people actually run a meta Bloodied build and that you basically getting auto detected is just stupid?
---
People defending straight up terrible design choices is always nice to see.
---
Giantpunda's right, even with crappy gear, something as simple as moving perk cards around can be easily the most beneficial. if you happen to have a good cluster of scrap to use, it may be worth spending some on the hopes that you get an effective weapon. Also it may not hurt grabbing Tank Killer as soon as you can under Perception, since that card applies to both autos and non-autos. Also Bloody Mess under Luck is nice for that 15% boost in damage (at max of 3)
---
Heavy gun user here 
---
If the mobs are together it more of a spray to weak them tactic , most of us also use heavy gun out of vats so can’t see the HP bar
---
I think when the enemies leveled up, so did their stealth detection. VATS and stealth were already so janky before the patch. I ended up switching to a STR build yesterday. No more situational damage for me.
---
Thank you. Funny how many people are just pissed that I DID'NT read the memo LOL
---
Oh fuck, I was looking forward to daily ops.
---
Hopefully that number comes back to something more reasonable once Beth fixes the dmg calcs. At least the daily ops don’t require too much dmg to kill mobs
---
Well im new to the update just updated today.  My next best weapon is a anti-armor plasma flamer that melts enemies
---
I think it’s a feature tho so I’m happy but if it turns out being a bug that’ll suck
---
I ran a bloodied rifleman/comando/bow hybrid (all 3 share the same perk bonus and you only need to switch 3-4 perks on perception everytime you switched weapons) and the only bloodied build that the new update fucked up are my rifleman and bow ones. The damage of them is still "good" but being slow weapons and not being able to one shot anymore with them has put me on a few difficult situations were I died. 
---
Comando is still rocking, intead of 1-2 bullets to kill normal enemies I need 4-6 but isn't really a problem. And for daily ops I just switch a few perks to defensive ones, remove my radiation and run a shotgunner tank build instead.
---
Hahah, the healer role in an MMO is always challenging.
---
Grab a vampire's weapon. It will kill a little slower but should help keep you up.
---
It's in the PlayStation Store:
---
https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1003-CUSA12057_00-PFDENT0000000000
---
Here's the NA version.
---
Thank you, no I missed that bit of info
---
Thank you
---
Ahhhh oke. Didn't see options for legendary yet. Gonna play with those on my old lvl 282 tonight. Thx
---
I will, thank you
---
Nice!
---
No they commented that they are not struggling in fights not that they are doing more dmg. Everyone is doing less dmg than before just to what degree depends on builds.
---
earle was hell. I went in with my magic mini and blew 3k rounds, barely got him to 60% solo.
---
fyi. just managed to complete burrow with unkillable robots in 7m55s (after \~5 tries with  time from 8m1s to 9m30s) :) had to leave power armor while moving between locations, not used ranged weapons at all - just "danced" around walls and baited robots to go melee , then - just killed with super sledge (V/25fss/1str). Almost not used stimpacks - most time regeneration from vampiric weapon is enough to be sustained. Burrows still too complicated for me and maybe i used not optimal routes (because way between point beta and bossfight location took around 30-40 seconds even without PA), so time could be improved, but its definetely possible to solo even this (i think its worse possible ops combination) ops combination.
---
Hey happy feet 
---
make a new character and experience what the low lvl are complaining about then report back
---
You're right - and have been flamed for that!
---
Incorrect.
---
You can get up to 3, one for each rank.
---
I have a two shot one hehe
---
Carrots are amazing, not gonna lie. Carrots and celery. Top tier crunchables.
---
Also waiting on it!
---
People shouldn't have to pour ammo into bloatflies and rad roaches. Everything is a bullet sponge now. Yes, ammo conservation, back up plans (using melee when you need to), and survival is all what 76, and games like it, are about. But the *whole* point of the One Wasteland aspect was to *open* up the game more to players, but if this is the case everywhere they go, how will they be able to go anywhere safely? They can barely survive in places that were once safe, how will they be able to explore if they aren't making any progress? 
---
There is little to no choice in their builds now. The ammo drain is so significant, they are relying on melee, when before that was a choice to do.
---
Yeah, like...what if I wanna save that Perciptibobble card for use one day. I haven’t used it in over a year but still /s
---
It seems mostly the same to me, except I'm weaker, and it feels like bosses are now basically something I would offer little to no help with.  I've got the legendary perks that up damage, and they don't impress me at all, my average headshots to max level super mutants are like 500.      
---
Ammo was never an issue, that was one of the biggest perks of being a non auto rifler, I've got like 5k .45 ammo on me already.  I never said they were a challenge, I even said it's not really harder, it just takes a bit longer.  At very best it's a lateral move, there's nothing here that makes anything more fun for me.
---
Yes. Your junkies will benefit from the bloodied synergy package (adrenal reaction &amp; nerd rage) but once you sort out how you feel about it, I'd pick either one or the other.
---
In terms of damage output, 50% health is where junkies and bloodied are about the same. Go any lower than that and you may as well be a bloodied build as junkies doesn't get much stronger (other than the bloodied package mentioned above).
---
So what is your point? 
---
* The enemies in different areas still have different challenges even when the same level, which means that the risk is not the same from one area to another. 
---
* The enemies may take a couple of extra shots to kill, and your compensation is a much higher XP reward and legendary creatures now can drop max level legendaries. 
---
* The enemies in an easy event, such as leader of the pack, are still 1* because it’s still “Babies first legendary event”.  Enemies in harder events can now drop 3* weapons.  
---
* The enemies in easier areas are not going to have better pools of gear, and they shouldn’t, because they are still easier.  The forest is still going to be where you get pipe pistols and hunting rifles.  And that’s right.  It’s still the easier area to farm with less risk. 
---
It just seems now that you think the enemies in area such as the forest are level 50, all of a sudden they should all be dropping 3* legendary items, high level weapons with multiple mods for maximum junk scrapping, despite the fact that they really don’t take much more effort to kill than the did before.  Unless your build is horrible.
---
Yeah combat knives with swing speed are always a good time. I use one as a main weapon, non-stealth. That thing has poked plenty of holes in the SBQ’s face.
---
You get hit by a energy attack and it has a chance to recharge your fusion core and heal you so it’s very powerful in daily ops at one point I was just standing there looking at 16 mister gutsy’s 5 potectrons and a couple of eye boys l just shooting me and I kept getting health regen for about 5 minutes it’s a really good perk
---
I experienced exactly the same
---
Yeah unarmed seems to be bugged atm
---
I still haven't run it with a 4 member team where we got in under 8 minutes.  I just now though got my last piece of Troubleshooters armor.  This is making a big difference.
---
I also run one level of born survivor and one level of serendipity,  Those both help too.
---
But man, when you get 4, 5 or more Gutsy with their pop guns in a room, that shit can be hard.
---
I'm enjoying the challenge!
---
I’m really thinking about going full bloodied, go big or home
---
I almost had a heart attack because my legendary fixer disappeared. Turns out it’s still in my inventory, but now is just called The Fixer, and not for the perk in front of it. What’s that all about?
---
did you know you can change it to show the normal HUD while in power armor?
---
*picks up decayed ultracite nugget in Ash Heap*
---
*gets swarmed by five L100 Scorched and a L100 legendary beast*
---
*has to do this five times for each crafting pull*
---
...hmmm...
---
Hell yeah.
---
Too many on this board only care about level 300-400 superbuild experiences. They're too up their ass to realize this isn't working for most people.
---
I'm failing to see everyone's problem with it, I'm a level 120 pa heavy gunner build, still coming across level 100 enemies and tearing them down in two shots of a plasma caster, 5 of an AAE Gatling gun, one thing is the damage taken increase is noticeable, but a few more stimpacks being used is a minor problem, but hey, that's my opinion, even if it was more challenging, makes it a little funner to play, people one shotting enemies seemed a little dull to me.
---
One glowing+legendary+brood mother @50? Sure, maybe. But normal variants, absolutely &gt;20.
---
No. Bethesda came up with a fix. It's just that it couldn't stomach the loss of revenue and backlash by doing so.
---
So then how were you a bloodied unarmed that was one shooting scorchbeasts or are you just trying to make yet another “look how snarky I can be” post?
---
Fuck celery. I hate that.
---
Bunker - Has anyone seen any complaints on an official forum or anything regarding the bunker walls having been curved?  I would love to know where they got the idea we wanted it changed.  When I submit my ticket, I intend to suggest they put all bunkers back the way they were and instead take the new design and make it a variant of the Bunker, so the few people who want flat walls and less floor space and would need to redecorate ANYWAY can opt to use that.
---
Theramin - my best (wild) guess is this was a legal thing.  Either something as simple as finding out they didn't have the rights to the Theramin synth sound they used... or as complex as using Bob from Accounting who is Really Good with a theremin but not in a music union, then getting slapped with one grievance fine per union musician used in ALL music throughout the game, akin to when Cryptic needed to stop using any and all non-SAG voices (people in the office) so SAG would let them record Star Trek cast members.
---
Taking one for the team, ammo factory, master infiltrator. I’ve got ammo factory maxed already and really wish I didn’t max far flung fireworks
---
Ah, so glad it’s not just me!
---
I'm glad to see that not every event caters to stealth builds.
---
I took on lvl 62 charred ghouls at level 20.
---
Wasn't easy and I died a few times doing it but it was an accomplishment afterwards.
---
This. This is just bullshit.
---
450 .50cal or 5mm is insanely satisfying
---
I found my bloodied Gatling gun takes a few more shots than before and my bloodied .50 cal is still decent as well. I enjoy the challenge a bit more but it’s too early to tell lol. Once I start running out of ammo I’m sure I’ll hate it
---
It's not too lazy to stack damage. Downloading spreadsheets isn't what normal players should be forced to do.
---
idk man you might deal a bit less DPS but a full hp Heavy Guns PA build is now an unstoppable juggernaut who literally doesn't die in 99% of scenarios because energy weapons are basically godmode hacks for him, and if he does drop there's a good chance he gets back up...
---
He said all you need for bloodied to work is to be "irritated all the time" so I guess he is running a bloodied build.
---
It’s fun I played it 3 times and third time got 730 so I got elder only got vault 94 outfit plan tho but it’s fun. There is damage nerfs but still not bad I like it
---
I know, i made 25k ultracite 308 the other day in one go and oh my god i love the lmg this update finally made this thing useable
---
Happened to me about 2 weeks ago. I deleted a pic to make room and poof they all disappeared.
---
Here’s another reply for you to downvote. I hope you feel better.
---
I still need elder rank... Can you run it back to back to back?
---
Okay, I haven't played yet since the update, but my boyfriend was playing most of the night and here are some takeaways (since we have a pretty similar playing style):
---
1. How the heck do you have such a comprehensive update and not even consider making the font-sizes more readable?!  We have to get within 2 feet of my giant tv just to read most of the text.  PLEASE FIX!
---
2. A lot of these updates sound fun and I'm looking forward to trying them, but:
---
3. This whole scaling thing is breaking the game.  Why would I want to encounter level 50 robots at the fertilizer factory--I want to walk through that place on my way to other places, not stop for a fight that wastes a ton of ammo.  I've seen my boyfriend (at level 102) be killed by the same group of level 50-70 robots five or six times in a row trying to do the new "daily ops" this morning.  Also, trying to make it so people can go to any area of the map at any level sort of takes the fun out of leveling.  I get that some enemies will still have max/min limits, but I don't think that my level 12 character should be able to beat the same enemies as my level 45 character...it feels like a cop-out.  I continue to level my characters because it opens more places I can safely go--when I can finally take the ammo factory workshop, it's an accomplishment, not just a standard.  And when my boyfriend's 102 level character CAN'T take the workshop he's been taking since he was level 60, it's demoralizing, not fun.  He's ready to quit--and he's one of your biggest fans.  Rant over
---
4. Why did you think we needed enemies that can only be killed with a melee weapon?  I don't usually even carry melee, let alone use it frequently.  I know, it's just the last blow that has to be melee, but seriously, it doesn't make any logical sense and it feels like the game is just trolling you to make you have to waste carry-weight on something you don't want to use.
---
5. I'm sad that all of my C.A.M.P.s were completely deleted just because I had ammo factories in them.  I'm sure you guys didn't do that on purpose, but it still kind of sucks.
---
6. Bethesda--you've Bethesda'ed the crap out of this update...I hope you have a few patches to fix some of the things that look like they might make the game unplayable.  I still love you, though.  I'm not mad--just disappointed.
---
Cheers!
---
Thank you for the kind words, def means a lot!
---
I'm level 142. PSN createbeauty
---
I shit myself reading this 😂
---
lmao I don't know. That part was sorta funny to me
---
Bro yeah I need to pull my LMG out. I loved it normally but keeping it stocked even primed was hell
---
It's not the same freedom of plopping down wherever you want in the wilderness like 76, instead it's houses and properties. But design wise, it's instanced which means the largest properties can hold like 700 objects you place, 10 NPCs or animals you place, and can hold I think 24 other players. The lack of collision detection in building can be a huge design tool that allows some awesome builds by using existing pieces of furniture in new ways.
---
It is a bit of a shock from 76 and honestly I didn't much care for it when it came out a few years ago but it has improved significantly.
---
Nah don't take them too seriously. It's either they are running an extremely shitty build or just exaggerating. They rant to talk shit about Bethesda
---
Yeah, I have the elder rank on I just wanna do it again with players
---
No. They’re containers and don’t connect to your stash unless you pack up the CAMP in which case the container dumps into your stash.
---
For me, the initial rank of infiltrator.  Opens up the ability to open up any lock or terminal without having to swap cards (or even have the cards).  To me it’s the most generally useful card.  
---
Otherwise I agree, I’ve been thinking of maxing out endurance, because, as you said, there’s a lot of good cards in there but they just were as good as say Bloody Mess, Weapon Damage Perks, etc.  But now I can get a bunch of extra HP and get 5 more perk cards, I might actually take something like the Chem Fiend so I can have my chems last 2x as long
---
Haven't done that yet but am guaranteed to forget at some point lol
---
I'm just happy most people lock their bases with level 3 locks
---
They did it so you can actually put stuff on the walls now. Like posters
---
Niiice thanks 2 more
---
I use my 2 shot automatic explosive Tesla rifle! It kills me too though. 😒🤯🤬🤬
---
I think you only has the chance of getting one by your first elder playtrough per day
---
This is why I love the update.  It allows for more dynamic builds and put more prefixes to use
---
Its extremely practical now and was one of the least nerfed guns! Extremely satisfying to use definitely recommend
---
It's not even right to call it bullet sponge if all they're soaking is an extra few bullets.
---
Different story with SBQ but even that ended up being about the same as last patch. You need more sustained firepower but you can also bring her down to the ground quicker and keep her there, so plus one column, minus the other one.
---
you get one "rare" card per booster (Every 5 levels you get that booster pack)... so for every 4 regular cards + your picks between four levels, you get 1 "rare" animated card.
---
so yeah, they are kinda rare, 1 in 8 or 9 cards if you pick a new card every level  (sorry my INT is kinda low...)
---
Nearly died in Sutton last night. Sutton!
---
Lone survivor, fire proof, blocker, dodgy, serendipity, born survivor, you don't even have to make a meta build  to get these perks work together.
---
And most bloodied build are stealth commando/rifleman build or PA heavy gunner build, former usually combo with unyielding armor set, which granted significant sneak bonus, latter with emergency protocol  which make Excavator as tanky as T-65. 
---
The so called 'high risk high reward' is basically a joke, I've been playing bloodied builds for over one fking year, never in a slight second do I feel 'high risk' before patch 22, I can stay in caution during SBQ fight, tanking her blast, using rad shields to deal with radiation, let born survivor deal with the fog, and deleting her with my BFFR Fixer. My Bloodied Prime Gauss Rifle used to one shot SB, MLQ and Behemoth, and their friends didn't even know what was happening, makes me question why the hell did I even need those survival perks if I was not going to kick SBQ/Earle/IS's ass, I should have changed them to QoL perks, become a food build, and I could still wandering all around Appalachia, one shot every mob without being in danger like i was playing stealth archer enhanced by the Golden Triangle in freaking Skyrim.
---
So no, the sacrifice you thought you had was never there, even if it was, it can be fixed by tons of methods. If you died a lot with a bloodied build, it's not because it was supposed to be 'high risk', it's basically because you, my friend, don't want or don't care to let your character live. 
---
Come to think about it, does death in this game even matter that much? The only two major problems of death in this game right now is not able to loot Earle and that respawn problem, right? Not to mention both are bugs that still exist, now that's kinda sad.
---
If we had another primary modifier I would've made it.
---
.....and Mirelurk hatchling. Brilliant idea. 5 thumbs up 👍👍👍👍👍
---
How do you kill them though?
---
I got one you can have and lmk if you wanna run the op.
---
I don't think I did though. The perks are there for a reason, if you use a weapon type it only makes sense to equip related perks. Also there's literally weaker creatures earlier in the game, not by level anymore but physically weaker. Focus on them until you're more equipped/strong enough to take down something bigger. If you can't understand that then there's literally no hope and you can just keep dying to the same thing until you give up.
---
I was wondering about that... so I rather keep my animated cards and simply scrap those lame ones...
---
I saw a ghoul with a S on his chest....
---
I ran....
---
I'm glad you did too.
---
I guess I fucked up when I was excited for a 14hr download to finish and instead of jumping on reddit I read the descriptions of each perk in detail trying to be careful and not nerf my character but I guess I screwed the pooch.
---
I am glad it worked well for you though.
---
Psn?
---
It wasnt quite as bad as I had expected, though my damage did drop from 440 to 260. But I can still one-shot most all enemies with a sprinting power attack (plus instigating).
---
Taking One for the Team is pretty sweet and helps a lot, cuz enemies always start shooting at me while I'm charging them, which (I'm pretty sure) activates it so I get that sweet +40% damage when I slam into them. I maxed out TOftT right away.
---
They definitely deal more damage and while I can still deal with them, it feels even more breakneck to run from enemy to enemy trying to dispatch them and ducking into cover sometimes. With Legendary Endurance I fit in Lifegiver with Rejuvenated to get as much HP as possible, and am on my way to maxing out Endurance.
---
I'm level 74 and have burned through more ammo in one day than I do in a week usually...this is not fun.
---
We'll be sure to keep you in the loop.
---
Or just reduce the weight by 90%
---
I'm having the same experience as you described. I have a level 117 and level 17 going. The game is a little more challenging for my 117 but feels better than me one shotting every enemy including high levels. Meanwhile, I am able to visit areas I couldn't previously with the level 17. Overall I'm happy with the changes. I started the new character because the ease of the high level was getting boring. Daily ops are another story. Those resilient bots are something else.
---
Too bad plasma rifle ballistic dmg reduced :(  92&gt;73
---
Nope, I'm pleased as punch.
---
The game was too easy, and I'm not even a min-maxer and I don't run a bloodied/junkies build.
---
Daily Ops are great - it requires you to change things up and sometimes have a bit of group co-ordination.  
---
Events that were fun, but low level, are now worth doing.  I noticed participation in events was way up yesterday.
---
I think yesterday's patch is a huge improvement.
---
Stealthboy
---
QoL, the lockpick one is amazing. No need for bobby pins, no need to swap perks.
---
The SPECIAL ones are great for flushing out your build with a couple extra points in areas you were deficient in.  My Sniper with only 3 strength was always quick to get over burdened, now I can get it up enough to get 4 ranks in Strong Back.
---
Great.she gives me nothing but these garbage fixers and explody handmades...smh
---
So far, I've taken time to scrap a ton of what I deem useless.  I think I have almost 700 coins.   
---
 I've also selected three perks and only one level of each.  I chose luck, power armor reboot and taking one for the team.  I am holding off for now to learn more before making any further decisions.
---
man i setup my camp there 2 days ago lol, yay me!
---
TSE has 4 (!) chances to trigger Luck of the Draw per shot. Maybe you wanna give that a try.
---
Was OP AF before patch. Now I'm only OP. Games feels more challenging and it's good.
---
Hovdogjay
---
Just a personal observation, but after the patch I found the leveled up enemies have much better sneak detection now. Kept getting spotted after killing a few enemies in a group. Couldn't hurt!
---
What's your psn? I have a lot of max level legendary armour left over from the purveyor sale you can have your pick of. I have a weapon or 2 I can donate too
---
Maybe there is new lag in the system? I mean I've always noticed a delay from a shot to a mobs death. One reason I had wished there was an offline mode tbh..
---
Also with the new Follow Through perk I've also noticed a horrible delay between  your shots and the time it takes to register the debuff. Like I have to shoot, wait a full second before I notice the increased damage. Really quite useless for a fast stealth commando build.
---
Specially for the ops yeah,but i can't get my friends to get it because they say they die fast and blabla. Being the moron who waste 300 points for others, feels exactly like the card name.
---
Looks like some kind of weird font issue. Are you running the game/platform in a non-English language?
---
Username checks out
---
See that’s the thing, I’m talking about normal supermutants lvl 68 or even simple feral ghouls now take multiple shots from an endgame build at double their levels with superior gear, against large bosses it takes me awhile to wear them down which I’ve never had an issue with, but the fact a charred ghoul can now tank 6 TSE shots before going down defeats the purpose of running rifleman as opposed to commando , my real gripe with this update isn’t the damage, it’s the fact riflemans pretty much being made obsolete where commando where the true dps lies is still reigning supreme
---
Yea. Only problem is damage
---
Use heavy guns and most of them are energy  , before I didn't have space for batteries included , before I didn't have space for gun smith either , now I do and yes my dmg is lower but now I can carry ammo no problem and my guns don't break so fast , some other minor changes are that now I have 9 charisma and can share team medic rank 3 really useful perk for daily ops imo
---
What about gutsies tho? They really ripped me apart before the update. Kinda worried of what they will do to me now
---
Bloody melee which was really the only viable build took a 70% damage reduction in patch 22 from my testing. I wouldn't get too envious about the melee legendary perks. Also one of the skill is for VATs melee which isn't really a think as far as I know
---
Question:
---
So I am level 30 now.
---
I'm trying to get a keycard at a certain janky tower, but the first time I tried it, there were like level 50+ assaultrons in there that decemated me, and that was at like level 20 or so.
---
With this patch does this mean I now stand a fair chance of beating those things on my own?
---
Edit: yes, yes it means this .
---
Finally! I can take on assaultrons!
---
Although those little commie bots suddenly being level 30 is annoying!
---
The fact that boss actually feels dangerous is fucking awesome though. I actually had some "oh shit" moments when I fought her solo.
---
Jumped in today at level 17 and got my ass handed to me. My weapons kept breaking, and I can’t reload the shitty early game weapons I have very fast. I would have given anything for a combat shot gun... or an assault rifle that does more than 30 dmg. 
---
I tried to do a daily op solo (out of curiosity and for the xp), but I noped out after the seventh or eighth time I died. Then I encountered my first Mole Miners... died immediately. Further down the road trying to find the last of the Overseer’s Journal Entries, I had a random event pop up with a Sentry Bot, and he murdered the shit out of me. 
---
I had been doing fine this past week as a new player, but after the patch today I had to make some pretty big adjustments. Weapons and armor break every time I leave my CAMP to complete a quest. It would be all good if I could find enough adhesive to repair these items while I was out completing quests, but it seems like the game really wants me to blow my Atoms on repair kits instead of providing enough of the one resource I need. All in all, it was an embarrassing shitshow trying to make those last three levels in order to continue the Overseer’s questline... especially since I’m endgame in 4 and basically invincible. I’m here for it though; this game is fun as hell.
---
I wasnt really following a build, I ran full health unyielding bloodied, more for when I got into those “oh hamburgers!” moments my damage and resist would go up. Still takes 3-5 swings to down a resilient Colonel. But I gave up on first OP because even though downing resilient robots wasnt too bad, it was just never ending. Whats the point? Dungeons need a point, not just endless waves
---
Your build is bad and you should feel bad.
---
This is nothing, people waste their money on all kinds of shit
---
I never did quests. I got to level 100 by camp building and low level events alone. I just died while getting the Billings workshop against mole rats. I really don’t wanna make a new character because I collected the majority of the camp plans on that one account. I get it helps players who have run out of stuff and whatnot but it sucks I can’t play how I did.
---
A simple PA foot kick animation (like gun bash) would be a great addition if it sends the vermin flying... maybe add an impact splash if you hit an obstacle. Well, not gonna happen but one can dream.
---
Join me on my private
---
On my private
---
Well, legacy plasma was always good, im curious about regular one
---
I believe the tricentennial was only available if you purchased that edition of the game . Could be wrong but that’s how I got the exclusive tricentennial add ons .
---
Edit: that edition I purchased was in 2018 so things have probably changed by now .
---
Wel the fast travel bug was alot worse than ever before, dying and not being able to respawn hasnt happened in along time for me, while yesterday it happened, while its supposed to be fixed? And i havent tested every aspect of the game since the patch yet, but have seen a couple others reported here, also, im not saying its the devs themsleves, their trying their best I believe, im saying the company should pour some more resources in it, but that would take away from profits so yeah...
---
As a stealth commando, punched in the dick with a power fist.
---
I heard! Thankfully I hadn't planned on spending any coins on it yet
---
It's all one piece, hat &amp; mask built together. Picture Below
---
[The Subjugator Mask](https://i.imgur.com/bJfWSQ8.jpg)
---
Probably near the same, but I'm unsure. I have a TS33 I can pull out
---
As a sniper, I was a little perturbed by how many sneak attack shots it was taking to kill basic mobs now.  2 ranks in Follow Through has corrected that considerably.
---
If you’re xbox, you’re welcome to join my friend and I. We had 2 useless randoms too, but managed to finish with 13 seconds to spare!!
---
If we get load outs in the next big patch it could negate master infiltrator
---
Is there any incentive for these other team members to actually participate. Like do they get rewarded if you put in all the effort and complete the op on your own without their help?
---
If so, this is a Bethesda problem, not a player one. Same with all the other public events that have a very high failure rate like Project Paradise or Radiation Rumble.
---
Those glitches aren't specific to this patch so i really dont get your point.
---
I agree. As much as I miss one shotting all non boss enemies in the game, One Wasteland actually provides a challenge to high level players outside of Earle and Queenie. My only gripe is that I've found the update to really force me away from a general stealth build - I've really had to marry my Bloodied Lever Action just to deal half the damage I was before.
---
its in the store of your platform
---
I'm reserving my final judgement until I've hit the military camps around the Cranberry Bog. Let's see how fights vs Assaultrons and Colonel Gutsies with armour piercing rounds go - experience at AWOL Armaments predicts they'll be tougher than sturdy leather.
---
2*
---
I solo'd it in 7 minutes 32 seconds as a non-bloodied non-junkies non-chem vanguards food build with a q/50/25 railway rifle.  I really don't understand how people are having these vastly different experiences.  Maybe it comes down to play style more than build?  I mean, sure it was challenging, but I would just take cover and peak corners when a bunch were after me, then rush out when they were all 1% health and bap them.
---
Multiple mutations seem to be broken currently, I’ve noticed a lot of people saying healing factor no longer heals your limbs as well
---
It is instanced, and while I don't love loading screens, I have a loading screen everytime I fast travel so what's the difference. Instanced also would allow larger camp budgets as less would have to load in environments. I will take a much larger camp budget over out door any day. They keep cutting back areas we can build out their anyways. 
---
And vendors? Yes, I have a personal merchant at my house, and a personal banker. The big player to player stores are done at cities or hubs, think train stations. But all that is a moot point as ESO has 1) a mail system that you can 2) send and receive items and 3) send and receive items and have cash on delivery which is essentially just simple selling.
---
1. Depending on the other two effects on the wooden leg, it could still be useful for a stealth build, since wood has that whole “dark mod”
---
2. My experience from other games is that matchmaking doesn’t do anything to make the other players useful.  WoW was the worst offender as people would join and then try to just leach and or just go afk.
---
Gonna test myself at home after work, i was watching some pts videos where gat plasma dmg was like 70-80% lower, than live servers (lasers too). But some ppl said it just a visual bug
---
Foundation won't let me build one.  Oh well, guess I'll stay soyboy.
---
Ok then, u have a nice day, bb
---
I think it can drop as a legendary yeah. like other weapons that required plan learned for legendary to drop
---
I don't think it's any stronger than a Super Sledge, is it?
---
Pain train, mate :)
---
I can't do anything let alone ops. I've  attempted to do riding shotgun 3 times and everything I disconnect. I think its time to put this game down. I have plenty of other grind games to worry about.
---
i'm also happy with this update. Game now feels... idk... fresh. I like training approaches to solo ops - its hard (pretty hard to solo this exact combination - with unkillable-from-ranged-weapons robots in burrows), but possible (managed to beat it in 7m55s from like 5th try) even in my full bloodied build. I like ops rewards. I like new - more challanging - enemies in the world. I like legendary perks. Even previous reputation grind now looks rewarding (because previously no mattew which weapon you used - you could vaporize anything, now - new gauss weapons looks just stronger than others except my precious b/fss/1s power fist, and even this power fist have very limited space for usage right now - only openworld activities without bosses). Honestly - this is the 1st time when i cannot say than i don't like or i neutral to implemented features. Good job, Bethesda. Very huge step in right direction.
---
And? Melee is pretty bad since the nerf, and power armor has always been bad. They need buffs the most. They give you guys backpacks and a fucking jetpack and you guys are still complaining
---
Yeah, I think most of the bullet sponge complaints are from people used to one shotting everything and now they have to pull the trigger twice.
---
u idiots forget this is a post-apocalyptic world, u deserve those monsters at ur camp
---
Bloody pistols hate you all :((
---
My pistol build totally unplayable with that patch
---
was just about to say that
---
I didn't know they did this with ESO. A lot of MMO's have a similar system in play, but none of them are nearly as punishing as this. I think the major issue is the ammo economy and how much damage your equipment takes compared to the reward you get for killing an enemy.
---
Overall, it's pretty alienating for characters who haven't gotten to 50+, because they don't have access to as many damage+ perks or unique-feeling weapons.
---
Half life, full auto/melee, PA, AAE will be king of ops. All the old builds work just fine outside of ops and do a little more dps.
---
I have to sit and change almost all my perks dependant on my builds and each time I’m wasting 5 minutes fiddling about trying to get ammosmith and super duper on etc to make bullets for queen then swap it all back after I teleport for optimal dps, if you could have even just three perk loud outs you can set my life would be complete in the wasteland
---
I end up with way more ammo than I start with from Daily Ops.  Ammosmith seems pretty pointless.
---
My vampires melees do exactly the same damage as before but I really dislike that every enemy now tanks 10+ hits.
---
My fingers are already hurting. Whish we could just hold the key and the character would hit nonstop.
---
Also weapon repair is really excessive now
---
Definitely agree. There are more options now, but not enough to be warrant multiple weapon builds without switching out a handful of key perk cards, which is just too annoying to be worth running more than 1 build.
---
I just wish we had some cap sinks in this game.  Something “good” to spend my caps on, that’s repeatable.  Best I have right now is buying gold bullion then using it to buy lunchboxes.  I’d rather just buy lunchboxes.
---
Well the SS just stands for Secret Service and in-game would SURELY not use that abbreviation hahaha.
---
I get where you’re coming from a more new Vegas styled reputation system with faction vilifying you for working with another but it’s what we’ve got so far
---
Pain train isn’t what he’s asking about
---
Or the ones fixated on numbers and are crying about their number going from thousands to hundreds while devastating everything around them still.
---
I'm glad my melee weapon is an instigating piercing bear arm, it's still chewing most stuff up with no melee perks. It's just a shame so many situationally useful melee weapons are just useless now because that situation is gone. :\
---
It sounds plausible, but I'd have to see it in action
---
Wasteland football. Kicking vermin all over the damned shop would make this game even better. :)
---
Just disable grass in the .ini and presto issue resolved (plus more FPS)
---
It just takes like 30 seconds to a minute. Just healed a crippled leg.
---
Thank you - I did not see that at all
---
It confuses me, soooo is this just a power grind now because actual gameplay is harder? One shotting super mutants for years to all of a sudden being a limp noodle is not much of an improvement tbh. The fun is gone for me
---
you have options alright: junkies, TS, AA. TSE or AAE will do even better.  
---
instigating now works better for melee in combination with 40%power attack damage
---
Crap.
---
OP just reminded me i need to grind for rep and gold so i can get the ammo-bake-oven for my camp.
---
I fought some handys that I believe were gutsies. Felt that I survived a bit better. If you’re still worried, perks like ricochet are going to be much more viable now
---
I’m on console.
---
10mm SMG is nice in terms of DPS and dmg, no scope or silencer tho
---
Borzoi villager... :-)))
---
Honestly I’m done. I finished the legendary run a couple weeks early and took a break. Last night I did the ops and had absolutely zero fun. Having to melee something to kill it while the hit detection is garbage is about as fun as pulling teeth. I realize it’s just a small part of the game but I was already burnt out
---
Works on pc. But unfortunately not for consoles.
---
I am on Xbox and saw the train set at someones camp last night.  It visually looked pretty bad.  There was not much detail to it and it all looked pixelated and blurry.  I will say that is probably  was not all the way rendered in because I only looked at it for about 15 seconds or so.
---
Then by the same token, gunpowder should be classified as junk and can be dropped when you die. Seems only fair.
---
Earle had a stroke trying to read that and died. Can I weaponise this comment please?
---
I’ve found myself feeling like a piece of parchment paper, as a stealth rifleman my stealth seems to no longer work, and I can’t lose detection for minutes even with escape artist and because of this I’m getting insta downed or getting charged by enemies so fast my own explosive rifle kills me
---
I am making assumptions and that is... My fault! Big apologies console brethren!
---
I’m gonna personally save this and remember this for next time i’m online cause man i hate trying to do the new ops as a bloodied stealth rifleman/commando.
---
Fair enough, I don’t run it myself but I’m glad to hear it’s working!
---
There goes vendor disabled for a month.
---
I carry a max level Instigating swing speed knife for such occasions (such as for the meat week cookout).
---
Definitely one of the best updates only update that is probably better was wastelanders but its nice to see how far this game has come
---
I’d also recommend actively pursuing daily and side quests, as well as exploring and taking workshops. Doing these along the way will help keep your level appropriate to the difficulty of the main quest.
---
I remember just grinding the main quest, and getting very frustrated when I found myself way overmatched.
---
Hey /u/urnamesucksbro thanks for the report. Sent you a PM asking for more details.
---
I'm afraid that Pain Train does not allow me to play wasteland football with vermin. :)
---
I don't think it's that dramatic. I don't think players won't have a choice. It's literally been day ONE of One Wasteland, where people will complain about the slightest things when change is brought into the game. New players will not see the difference compared to new players before One Wasteland, but those players before OW will definitely complain, meaning their opinion on the matter can't be identified as complaining or an actual problem. Now, the opening up the game to players did happen but there is always gonna be consequences involved. Obviously, you're a level 5 and somehow end up at west tek, you have more of a chance to survive now but... won't...in most cases. THAT was the idea of OW, having a higher chance. Being more useful in teams. Giving the player a difficulty and advantages that are more fair, improving the game overall. There's not real way how to make the game like you're explaining OW was supposed to be like without making it boring and even more easy than it is rn for all levels in the community.
---
I wasn't bothered with the enemy damage [rescalling.It](https://rescalling.It) was a bit ridiculous
---
Destroying my build is what has seriously pissed me,and many hard core Fallout 76 Gamers off.
---
Pandering to a mard arse minority, at the expense of a huge majority.These players now trolling Reddit.
---
Let us not forget those who are in love with this Patch.Have been incessantly whining about OP builds for weeks..Screaming its not fair.
---
Now they accuse others of thinking the game is too hard ............the irony.After not having the mental aptitude to create a half decent build to grief others with. Thats the crux of all this.Mard arses who could not peffect a half decent build.
---
We all get to suffer for a few snow flakes.
---
I give it a couple of weeks and there will be empty servers,.
---
A Few  Camp builders and those in love with Ammo sapping Bullet Sponges.The novelty will soon wear off when you are having to 2,3 shot every in game enemy.
---
Events will be Cherry picked because of ammo issues.High ammo events already given a wide berth by  many,will be empty.
---
No one thinks the game is to hard.
---
The issue here is completely destroying a build.
---
The problem was never bloodied [players.It](https://players.It) was those using exploits to inflict insane damage.
---
The Queen still dies in seconds ffs,whilst now you have to use a Mingun on a Mole Miner.
---
Not sure why they would do that, but cool story.
---
We need a stranded riverboat casino!
---
Chameleon armor is completely useless. It's only a visual effect
---
I think it sucks personally. I mean Christ the workshop events are already a nuisance and now I have to fight off level 50 everything to. I mean it’s bad enough they get stuck outside the workshop area and you can’t find them but now they take forever to kill as wel.

In terms of sneakyness, 30 agility is still good. Whitespring or Flatwoods, it is the same.
---
Wait you choose that box over collecting screws???? I can't remember the last time I ran out the mine. I just pop my stealth suit at 10 seconds left and you don't die from rads. Technically the game removes you from the instance but it doesn't kill you. It's a good way to farm screws just run around w a shotgun you'll get 25 to 35 shotgun shells for one or 2 shots.
---
Ok thanks for the confirmation ! Was only Available through buying that game edition at launch but looks like a add on purchase now . FYI for anyone interested the tricentennial paint only applies to the laser rifle not the ultracite version unfortunately !
---
....the boss didn't need to be melee attacked?
---
Never kill a Mirelurk Queen in water... Done it twice with plamsa and could not the gloop
---
I had a faster swing speed, AA cultist dagger that was amazing for this. Now it's not even worth the 1.5 lbs that it takes up. Sad day.
---
I killed a level 60 scorched doing 50damage per shot in 8 shots, these high level enemies seem weak now
---
Wondering if *any* weapon I use is still usable. I'm afraid to check.
---
The one problem I found was in the daily op while playing with my gf, I use power armor so I managed to survive getting shot by multiple robots as long as I had a stimpak but they kept piling up behind us, the moment she died once she had to cross a pile of 10 1 hp robots that kept staggering her and couldn't be killed from range. Now I know about the melee weapon + grenade trick but it was pretty ridiculous.
---
I was getting 8:20 and 8:30 doing it solo, I joined a team and it took us 4 tries to get it under 8 minutes because they wouldn’t stand near the damn thing
---
It’s nice to have, but I was running the V94 raids with my buddies on voice chat only (Discord, but that’s basically the same thing).
---
Thank you. When I logged in it hadn't yet been updated. That solved it!
---
Gambling gets weird.  Even if it’s all with in game currency, some countries prohibit it, so game designers just don’t even bother with it (Look at Red Dead Online as an example) would otherwise be nice, i’d love it, but I understand the logistics nightmare of including it.
---
Thanks for the notification mate. Upvote for awareness.
---
I had heard about the shotgun glitch, but what is magic about some of the others? Please ELI5, thanks!
---
I believe so but I've noticed armor like cavalier's still says other players, not humans.
---
if you haven't any Damage perks for weapon types you might want to consider adding one and seeing if the 10% boost will make a difference. I'm assuming your Level 20 is meeting level 20 enemies in the forest?
---
your build looks like mine. I didnt solo it but completed it several times with just another player. elder rank multiple times.
---
I swapped no card, didnt equip any armor (I only use a chest piece, no arms or leg armor) and to me what made it simple was swapping my junkie handmade for a vampire handmade. simple as that.
---
that are many solutions, you found a great one, I found one that works for me. 
---
but some people are complaining before even trying to solve the problem.
---
I feel like most existing groups for daily ops when entering a server have already done it. I'd join a server with a nice amount of people and wait till you see that someone formed a new daily ops team as they are probably gearing up to do the mission.
---
It seems weapons with high base damage is taking this 'nerf' better than other weapons
---
It felt those pistol Gutsies in the Daily Ops did less damage than I'm used to from their type.
---
What's certain though is that Slayer's legendaries do 1% less damage than Anti-armor now. I hit a lvl 75 Super Mutant with slayers Gatling Gun: 95 damage - Anti armor GG: 96 damage. Before, slayers did 10% more damage than AA.
---
If you read all the other comments you'll see that it's not but thank you for taking time from your day to show a little intolerance.
---
Yeah that def sounds like a rendering issue, and being that this is fallout 76, its not hard to fathom there being rendering issues haha. I can only speak for myself, but the Electric Train Set I built in my camp looks pretty nice imo.
---
I would assume it’s like the fixer and bear arm, once you’ve learned the plan the game will start dropping legendary ones.
---
Don’t quote me on this though i’ve barely been able to do the new ops as a bloodied stealth rifleman/commando, let alone actually trying to get a team together for the ops.
---
Is it? I get a horrible delay before it procs and by then my commando has killed them anyway. Was hoping that extra 20% would save me a few rounds but for even mid squishy level enemies like bots and super mutants they still die before the debuff kicks in.
---
Though obviously for bosses it does have time to kick in. I wouldn't recommend it for people who are still questing and exploring though.
---
He's Only LVL 40 so he can still LVL up really fast and it's not that hard to find a decent handmade 😎
---
You’re gonna need a lot of levels
---
I have to agree, this is probably the most fun I've had with the game since Wastelanders
---
You’re absolutely right, didn’t consider that.
---
Enemies spawn in when another player visits your base too by my observations. It sucks, I came back to 4 level 50 mole rats eating all my turrets. This game doesnt know what it wants to be anymore
---
If I am frank I think, Bethesda should have a small team of devs addressing QoL things like this bulldoze and what not. Because honestly it's fantastic we are getting new content and what not. But yeah there's lots of features that need polish to make life happier
---
Same. But that has been going on for a few weeks now. Not everytime though
---
Not until you mod it.  
---
The flaming mod is probably the best to use on it, as near to no enemy has a resistance against that type of damage.
---
I haven't seen anyone else mention this problem yet and you probably would have noticed it right away, I know I did.  I have only done one daily op that I soloed this morning and even the bash damage to finish the bots at one hp would sometimes make me have to hit them 5 times in a row before it would register.  Kept taking damage during the op that gave a melee hit sound as well with no enemies anywhere near me.
---
I'm going to try switching from wifi to wired connection to see if it helps later. The update has caused some strange issues for me though for sure.  No issues with my network I have seen otherwise, but it sure seems like the server and my client are not in sync anymore when it was fine before the update.
---
It really is hard tho
---
I considered that, but I was hesitant to sacrifice my junkies damage bonus considering the nerf. 
---
But for sure there are multiple solutions, all work well. People will complain no matter what. A lot of folks aren't willing to adapt to changing situations, which is silly in an evolving online multiplayer game haha
---
Except that you could take over a workshop with a safe, lock it with a level 3 lock, then quickly disable the trap under it again and again and farm treasure maps, rare-ish plans, and 7-8 caps at a time... I've heard.
---
Oohhh ok thanks man. Damn why did they do it like that instead of finding shit from exploring
---
Again, not that it’s a bad idea.  I would LOVE some NV style gambling, but I know they get weird.  They could implement it, they just need to make sure the know where people are logging in from to limit access to it.  
---
Even if they brought back pails/Christmas presents but in a way they couldn’t be duped (or didn’t have caps in them) I’d probably buy them up.
---
I don’t even have a build
---
Poor Zap-Zap isn't going to get any use now. I kept an Instigating laser rifle on hand for my jollies through the Forest, but it's beyond useless against anything more than level 30-something.
---
Anti armor isn't affected by the nerf. Only weapons where the damage gets percental increased. This was changed from multiplication to addition. That's at least how I did understand it.
---
That's fair.
---
Honestly, a ton of weapons have mods that deal Energy Damage, and should do Flame damage now that it's differentiated.
---
I can only get so erect
---
What extra unlisted thing?
---
I think I actually cause more damage now with Follow Through
---
And i knew that ! But nothing ever spawned near me, ever. The very few times, it was when i arrived from fast travelling and i was immediately made aware of their presence. This time i guess they spawned when i was joining daily ops left and right
---
This, but without the irony.
---
I'm level 100, and don't have a build beyond rifles, and then mele at close range.
---
I'm afraid to check the game.
---
I'm sorry, what is "PA"?
---
I have been seeing this for a few months now.
---
I’ll try, thanks ! DaGuerre only has a 10mm lol
---
Its a long story really.  I didnt know about unarm builds could be so powerful until after i was a rifle build so i wanted to be the strongest i can be.  I got screenshots of of making my weapon 2k damage but im not trying to be like what you said.  The fact of all this is im just disappointed how much its nerfed .  Or 'changed'
---
It still unlocks rank 0 locks.
---
I only lock my raider ammo crafter thing and collectron really. It doesn’t bother me people looking around and what not. In fact I encourage it.
---
Same rewards? You get more xp and loot is always good. I have a stealth rifleman that's only level 25 and I can still kill with ease and stay alive
---
Waaah! Waaaah! I cant 1 hit the hardest non legendary enemies in the game anymore waaaaaah!
---
I dont know if “stand here and kill endless waves of Mr Gutsy” counts as a dungeon though, I give it a C-
---
I am sure that's what it was.  The screen shot you posted looks much better than the one I saw myself.  I am excited to get it.
---
A ridiculous amount of heals which happen whether or not your fusion core is at full.
---
Even if you’re not a melee build, always carry one with you. Save your ammo. Even if your strength isn’t 30+.  You can still kill insects and mole rats with 3-4 hits depending on the weapon. 
---
Get yourself a gauntlet or power fist. Preferably a 90% reduced weight if carrying capacity is an issue for you. 
---
I’m level 389 and honestly I’m happy with the fact that now radroaches are level 50 and up. Because now they give me about 90-100xp. Unlike before when they would only give me 3-5xp and we’re just a waste of my time.
---
Then it is as it should be.
---
"Hey I didn't get what I want, this game sucks !!"
---
I’m waiting for tonight to run through on private server to do workshops I don’t feel like pvp just for a challenge
---
Not bloodied, just regular unarmed here, but also doing well here still. Wasn't too much of an adjustment. I can still one-shot level 100 super mutants - after adjusting my perks a little lol (edit: added adrenaline). It's nice that they're doing more damage and are more of a threat now though.
---
The damage bug where you hit them and nothing happens is still there though, and wow it's still as annoying. Especially when it happens several times in a row.
---
&gt;This update will probably make me stop playing. It's not enjoyable anymore. Everything is bullet sponge now. To be clear my build was not a one-shot everything build... It was balanced, I spent a long time getting my character where I liked it, and I enjoyed playing because of it.
---
&gt;
---
That's disappointing.   I stopped playing because the higher level enemies were bullet sponges.  Its disheartening to hear that instead of removing or mitigating the bullet sponge effect, theyvjust gave it to all mobs.
---
Yes it exists. They are normally high RoF (200 plus) items with specific legendary mods.
---
Nah they made it thru fine , instigating stealth riflemen got kicked in the teeth tho
---
My hunting rifle begs to differ.
---
Meanwhile I’m considering deliberately maxing it out for the instant bounty.
---
As I was attempting The Path to Enlightenment this morning, battling level 50 Radtoads, I thought to myself "damn, even the easiest events are now a bit of a challenge." 
---
The game is better than it's ever been, and I love it.
---
I’ve got 2 - mutant marksman’s pump action shotgun and two shot hardened double barrel shotgun. My drops are terrible and it seems people don’t sell legendary shotguns a lot so these are the two best I could find at reasonable prices.
---
As someone who just reached level 33 this morning, it's a mixed bag.
---
On one side, it's nice to get appropriate experience per kill.
---
On the flip side, most enemies take a **lot** of ammo to kill. Like 3 to 5x as much as it normally would require. And my stuff breaks *very* quickly. I've begun to run out of repair materials and materials for making ammo. I actually had to build a new Marksman Rifle with a fucking .38 receiver because it was the only ammunition I had. I do considerably less damage, but since my only other option is to buy ammo (and usually vendors only have a few of any type), I don't have many options.
---
More risk of dying with a bloody build.
---
my bloodied knuckles and meathook are useless now lol
---
Does the Bayonet change the bash animation?
---
Yeah, that and the fact that she was different, felt like effort had been put in.
---
Now we need Bethesda to use the mixed robo guy in nuke launch control....love a protection with a assaultron head haha
---
Birthed? Is that a new feature or have I just been super lucky?
---
Instead of one-shotting everything I’m now two-shotting everything. No biggie. Loving the update.
---
I love how as soon as the One Wasteland idea was implemented, people went from endlessly shilling it to outright hating it. This community is perpetually pissy
---
Im not whining im just dealing with it but want the word out.  But you sir are very rude.
---
Well, relative to all other options that really is the easiest quickest option....odds are op will have some of those cards already from the 8 perk card packs they will have recieved
---
This helps.  
---
Has your playstyle changed much especially damage? I know this patch is so new but I'd like to know as much as I can. I do think I have the .50 cal receiver for both the Sniper and Combat Rifle. I have the ammo maker so I can start cranking out .50 rounds if it means doing more damage.  
---
My 2nd is a Shotgun only with 3 different shotguns and still do a good amount of damage. I'm a non-PA user as well.
---
I still use my two shot explosive submachine gun. It sound like a murder machine, but i don't think I could kill anything with it. 
---
Its the best for tagging that one legendary ghoul in a mob of 7
---
Where is the option for hybrid builds? My main is a hybrid bloodied Heavy PA/food build.
---
Well I'm a bloodied explosive user so the melee requirement is hard for me
---
I got on my alt, a level 20 rifleman and got to level 25 to see if I could see from your POV. Didn't take some massive toll on my ammo, didn't die, and had a lot of fun doing it. All these people downvoting must not have actually tried it for themselves. Ammo is no issue as I said as I know what I'm doing and can craft ammo much faster than I'm expending it. I'm loving it and can't wait to make another character with a different build and actually have it scale the whole time.
---
Im still doing fine, less damage but doing fine. (Im a bloodied power armour heavy) im not dieing any faster than I was and I think the game is more balanced now with me facing higher level enemies and not 1-2 shoting everything now 1-4 shotting most of the time
---
I don't like One Wasteland at all. I can't capture a low-level workshop as fast, I can't rush through certain areas fearlessly. Now everything hurts and take time. :/
---
It hasn't been 24 hours yet but im assuming it will reset at daily reset (same time as daily challenges)
---
Magic weapons don’t exist. Poorly coded bugged out perks do though.
---
I did it tonight. I need to find a weapon that smacks robots. Not my strong point
---
Agreed, especially since it has a long "rally at the point for a boost" section but you have to run away from the point to melee enemies to death else you get completely swarmed. Seems counter-intuitive.
---
The fast travel and trade glitch are still as annoying as ever.
---
This was my biggest surprise logging in yesterday for the first time. My camp usually has some random mobs spawn that are level 5. Queue my surprise of finding level 50 super mutants trashing everything
---
I use to have a generator go down every now and then before patch last night I went back to camp and my red rocket garage was destroyed lol. And every time I was there building level 100 super mutants kept showing up. Keeps me on my toes and now I will actually use defense turrets and stuff again. I stopped using them being they didn’t do nothing but shoot each other
---
Yeah I'm shocked to say that it is one of my favorite items of all of them. It's just low key, the sounds it constantly make are borderline soothing, and non-intrusive.  I'm going to do my "Brotherhood Field Station" review here in just a few, but it's hands down the coolest item I've unlocked to date for my camp. It's badass!!
---
This entire update is a PA heavy gunner circle jerk
---
Agreed. I played this game because I love Fallout. If I wanted a constant challenge there are plenty of other games.
---
And what have we learned...?   lol
---
I wish I hadn't sold that Junkie's Deathclaw gauntlet although it was only 1 star and weighed 18.
---
I am having serious issues doing melee damage w/o a good weapon.
---
boohoo
---
My Instigating automatic Tesla rifle used to melt scorched packs. Now it tickles them.
---
I have an alt that was level 20 and it's doing fine. Got to level 25 with no deaths and didn't take all my ammo. My main doesn't have a god roll legendary. Just seems like everyones crying because they have to actually work for shit now lol
---
40% of the sub has already made the same post. Im sick of it
---
Bless your heart.
---
Buildless build. Where we pray for perk loadouts to hurry the hell up so we can swap to whatever we managed to find ammo for now.
---
Oh, maybe because you can 2 shot everything and the NPC dont do shit because they cant see you.
---
Am i missing aomething? Im on mobile and when i click vote it goes to the create a pole page and says "Sorry, the question is closed for voting."
---
This patch is good if ur char is 150lvl+ preferably fully meta speced. Keep on grinding...
---
I will be sure to check it out.  After Halloween I plan to build a Trading Post museum of sort and this will go perfectly with that idea lol.
---
As i remember for angry turtle test, enemies do take increased damage from all sources including you.
---
NO, really?!
---
Some friends and I did our first Daily Op yesterday, and it was BRUTAL. We were all flipping out and laughing at how completely wrecked we were getting. Lots of us still had our bash key bound to a random out-of-the-way keybinding, so we were struggling hard.
---
But, it was still a lot of fun. By the end we were all like "Ok... so we just experienced the WORST possible Daily OP in terms of difficulty" and we were ok with it. We got a glimpse of the hardest combo, and still were able to complete the Op and had a good time despite all the deaths those robos handed us.
---
Time to start saving those Troubleshooters SS pieces lol
---
Well I mean when your game is a total flop the best way to get more positive reviews is listening to the community while also staying reasonable
---
Haha amen to that, thankfully I’ve got thousands of ammo. I never get rid of it, I simply use it when one gun runs out
---
It's sad that developers still think that longer fights = harder fights.
---
Games like dark souls got popular because the difficulty is overcome by getting better. Not because you have more healing items to chug through.
---
I'm a tank unarmed build and I have to say, not alot has changed honestly.
---
Not the legendary perks, no😉
---
I did the same... What's this trash box you speak of?
---
honestly not noticeable on my non-meta characters. 
---
outside of the level 100 mirelurk queen, my stealth assassin barely could pick off health off of her so i'm guessing i'll finally need to go commando on them.
---
Level 180 with a decent stockpile of 5.56 and part way through exploring Vault 94 I almost died because I ran out of ammo.
---
The more powerful your build and weapons were the bigger the beef.  It’s less noticeable the closer to base damage you were.  Unfortunately Bethesda is once again reward cheaters and by comparison the legacy and magic weapons are even more powerful relative to legit weapons.
---
Bro what happened?? Hope you’re doing okay, take it easy and rest up.
---
I’ve already petitioned for a nerf due to the enemies being impossible to defeat due to the broken level scaling
---
I don't have a level 300-400 superbuild and I don't have any god roll legendaries. Still did fine. My alt was level 20, got to 25 with no deaths and no unrealistic drain on my ammo which is easy to make anyways. I'm hype to make a new build and actually have it scale the whole time instead of from 20 onwards. People just want something to complain about, mad that they can't just play mindlessly and actually have to put some effort in
---
From depleted Uranium. :-)
---
Protectrons have become almost invincible.
---
Shame we’re on different platforms, I would have given you a fresh loadout. Fallout has a friendly community so I’m sure someone will definitely help.
---
I'm just happy I can finish the main quest A ounce of prevention. I was able to analyze the blood finally.
---
i’ve been calling it the veteran update, it’s really good for higher level players, who have had the game since launch like myself (i’m only a level 60 but i didn’t play the game for 18 months shhh) and it’s good for over lvl 50 players to get leveled loot they can actually kill enemies with and just better pve in general because it’s harder. instead of having levels for areas (therefor if you are low level you stay in the forest, higher you stay in cranberry bog.. which means it opens up the map for everyone and doesn’t restrict like it used to, makes the game feel more fluid) but fr i think they should have kept the old system for less than 50 cause everyone’s been complaining it’s tuff
---
Seems to me people with meta builds are fine, people with normal (ie not legendary) weapons or still leveling are the ones who are struggling.
---
A moment of silence for my camp which had a meeting with the floaters who used to be level 1-7 but are now 35-40 :/
---
Im a junkies heavy gun build so yah, you do know that the only thing you have to kill is the final boss?
---
I haven’t had this problem untill the new update I guess that’s just me though
---
It wasn't that playable before the patch
---
Good news is, your build still sucks and meta is still better!
---
Lmao!
---
I was on my private server last night and even though I usually have a decent stock pile of ammo, I chewed through all of it part way through exploring Vault 94.
---
Now that's a neat little addition I must say.
---
Edit: typo
---
I didn't even bother updating the game or trying this new update.  I knew it was a terrible idea from the start to have high-level enemies everywhere just to cater to a tiny but loud portion of the playerbase that min-maxes everything because they watch youtube videos.  I used to love running through Camden Park and doing the daily there but I knew it wouldn't ever be fun again with a bunch of dumb bullet sponges everywhere.  This was the last bad decision in a string of terrible decisions for me.  Uninstalling.
---
really that I did not know
---
Well then I’m glad I saved you the heartbreak. The are for buying additional ranks of the legendary perk cards. You get the first rank free, then it’s 50 coins for the 2nd, then 100, then 150, then 200.
---
This is upsetting to read as a *not* new player. 😑
---
Survival Shortcut basically removes the food and drink mechanic from the game entirely, even at legendary level 1.
---
It gives you a syringe just often enough that you never get low on food or drink, before the next syringe arrives for you to use and fill the bars full again; even with Speed Demon mutation.
---
I’m getting killed quicker because they’re higher level. That’s only to be expected. But when I have to pump two or sometimes even three magazines into an enemy because it’s got ridiculous DR, and I’ve lost 80% of my damage that’s not acceptable. I’m a meta build and struggling like fuck so I can hardly imagine the pain a high level casual is going through. Try going up against a level 100 Mirelurk Steelshell with a sub-par, possibly mediocre legendary weapon and a mediocre to good build and tell me it’s ok.
---
The fault in the logic here is if you have access to all the things that you should be able to have all the things built.
---
It's like the people who want passive perk cards of anything that isn't combat related.
---
This is an RPG (of sorts). Choice and trade-offs are a core mechanic for such games. Pick and choose within the budget you have.
---
2nd this. Foody here.
---
You have a 5%, 10%, 80% to unlock one from each tier moving up. If you finish in under 8 mons it rolls all 3 chances
---
I recently crushed my hand while at work- I’m a reserve firefighter and it happened in the back of the aid car-but my main job is a steel worker. It was the first time I’ve ever had to deal with work comp and it sucked so hope everything works out for you.
---
I didnt even noticed.  I literally just updated my game a few hours ago and noticed something was wrong with my damage.  So i decided to see if others going through it.  Then after that i went to go look at the patch notes.
---
You mean besides vault 76, foundation, crater, our camp, teammates camps, and any survival tents our team has?
---
Cryo mod's slowing effect is better IMO. I really want to grab one with faster swing speed as soon as I can.
---
I'm with you. Part of the enjoyment of leveling up is the idea that your life will be easier everytime you go back in earlier zone. Not having to worry anymore in parts of the map was the reward for me.
---
I really enjoyed quick and easy workshop captures in low level areas, easy kills for challenges and events. Some might argue that they found the game 'too easy' but it was a sweet spot for me.
---
Now like you said, it's bullet sponge all over the place. Things take longer to accomplish...
---
Daily Ops have potential but the one I tried yesterday was unfun with the resilient robots (meleeing is freakin' bad in this game), I didn't even get one single rare reward despite reaching rank 2.
---
To top that, as I was working on a few challenges I just realized I was not enjoying it. Season 2 arrives too soon, I needed a bigger break from the exhaustion S1 gave me. I was more happy having my mind at peace not worrying about the game than I was playing it lol
---
The perk was bugged for automatic weapons and doing bigger jumps in accuracy than it should have been after each shot. It got fixed yesterday.
---
Yeah dude its the one where zenimax.... Bethesdanet............
---
I think it must be similar to the mechanic where the SBQ spawns random Scorched under her. I was expecting some normal Scorched with pitchforks to spawn 50 ft away, not this. Maybe there was another player's survival tent nearby blocking a spawn point? Either way, completely took me by surprise.
---
Cursed Pickaxe? What exactly is that, because I've never even seen one or heard of it for that matter
---
My camp was still there, but they fucked up the sizing of my bunker
---
All those with 90% less weight shovels are really smiling right now.
---
Wow, that sounds really unenjoyable, obnoxious, and stupid. I'm legitimately scared to log in since this update, as I don't want my base that I spent hours and hours refining to get flattened while I'm out. I even canceled Fallout 1st, as much as I didn't want to.
---
As someone else has said, this game doesn't know what it wants to be any more.
---
Hell yeah, that's a neat idea. I love the camp system in this game, even with is many quirks, but I truly do enjoy it.
---
Daily op was pretty cool. Didn't see any issue with it at all myself, and I enjoyed it. I'm glad the game isn't just people running around one shotting everything anymore. The apocalypse and the wasteland are rough, and should reflect that by making survival an actual fight to survive, not overpowered god people decimating anything standing in their way.
---
I was still using everything I normally used for my bloodied stealth commando. I got elder with two other ppl after doing it twice before. I just put my gun away and use my death claw to kill enemies. Yeah I die a couple times because ppl won’t put away their guns with this op. But I got the time to 730. I guess I I would want to do it solo I will keep this in mind
---
I mean if you’re a solo player half of those options are gone. If you dont have fallout first that option is also gone.
---
Thx, I'll give it a go.
---
Cheaters went really wild some time ago, so I stopped playing, but will definitely check out again.
---
You can loot Earle? Every time I go up to his corpse even if I have shot him repeatedly there’s nothing.
---
Welp, looks like I'm moving the ol' water farm
---
It basically saved my will to play; allows to switch from PA HW build to pvp melee on the fly (and many other subbuilds)... Great stuff.
---
I hope Bethesda adds an different way to earn perk coins via a community event or something
---
no, you can add 1 Life Saving piece if you want outside of it you should get only unyelding
---
Your camp, vault 76, the crater and foundation are free fast travel points. 
---
You can also join public teams and use the players on it and their camps as free fast travel points.
---
This.
---
Here's hoping they follow suit with how they made Combat Rifle skins work on the Fixer!
---
Same, everyday I'd just walked in and he just know I had they're missing property.
---
I gotta find someone to mod my two vampire radiums being I didn’t realize that I barely have anything unlocked for them. Lol I might have to use those guns more often
---
I miss headshots, I’m a low level and my rifle is nothing special yet but seems dumb that a raider or blood eagle can now take several shots to the head, even with the stealth multiplier. Depends on your play style I guess but if you like stealth the update seems to have ruined the game a bit.
---
I use that as well and it's a great card to have. I think it's a bit more effective on something that fires faster, though. I have a semi-automatic handmade that really benefits from it. Regardless, if you're doing a sneaking build, absolutely take it.
---
Yeah, those builds are virtually unaffected by the balance update because of the lack of overall buffs they are losing out on.  And more importantly, the debuffs on enemy target (stabilized reducing their armor) have remained unchanged.
---
That said, while the damage calculations haven't effected heavy gunners much, the legendary perks sure are.  I just crafted 1800 rounds of ultracite .50 cal yesterday at the cost of one stable flux using the ammo factory perk and super duper.  It's a good time to be a heavy gunner.
---
I dont know what you just said but im angry and its someone elses fault
---
There was legit one public team in my server yesterday 😂
---
low level is right now unplayable
---
The meat week hammer is 400 damage
---
Actually they were pointing out how the system works as a mechanic and it's psychological \*fallout\* (hur hur).  What they posted is quite accurate.  
---
They also commented that the loot system doesn't overtly affect their gameplay.  
---
I personally agree with the OP's statement, but the one you just replied to is also correct.  Pointing out how a game mechanic is designed doesn't mean that they are defending it, they just explained how said system is designed.  
---
Accepting how something works and defending that something are two very different things.
---
That's a smart plan! I'm going to re-evaluate my legenary card choices based on that.
---
No! You get 10 thumbs up!
---
My instigating stealth sniper got hit so hard I’m having a hard time even wanting to play , went from a adrenaline reaper combo that one shot everything to 5 shots a mole rat and stealth being completely pointless , I’m slowly dying inside
---
Yes it does, i own several heavys that i have tested and it works. I also have a build built around 3 magic shotguns.
---
You solo it at 50+ level? Should a level 33 like me not bother doing ops teams until I reach above 50?
---
It also did big jumps for non auto weapons too prior to the patch. I'd often see the numbers jump from 60ish to 80ish to 95.
---
The bug fix mentioned in the patch notes is different. I know that one too and this issue isn't it.
---
The mellee hits from nothing are just a bugged sound i think from the gutsy robots that penetrate your arnour
---
Revenge is not a bug.
---
You don't actually have to team up to be on a public team.  Just join one for the stat boost and free fast travel, then go about your business as normal.
---
I'm a casual player and haven't done any special builds, so I didn't get nerfed like most people.  The main impact has been no longer having any safe places on the map.  Every enemy is high level and I'm burning through ammo, repair resources, and stims really fast.  I've got another 1-2 weeks of daily missions before maxing my rep with the raiders and getting plans for the ammo factory.  That can't happen fast enough.
---
Rigging a heavy piece of equipment, and the chain we were using snapped one of the links. Come to find out that one of the other guys on the job had welded that link back together a couple of weeks back, and let's just say he's no damn welder 😔
---
Don't think so, and as far as I know, Ripper isn't available as a legendary neither.
---
No rip and tear allowed on the premises.
---
I mainly say this because i hate doing a quest that gives me 30 caps or so and it causes me to fast to said location for like 15 caps or so. Whats the use of getting paid if you dont get the full amount
---
I'm on level 45 now, did daily ops yesterday and I burned all my ammo on this dungeon. Basically I lost everything, that I stockpiled during last month on one dungeon. This is bullshit.
---
honestly those turrets have been super perceptive for awhile now from my experience with a tendency for some enemies also just knowing where you are like the legendaries in uranium fever (at least if you're soloing).
---
but yeah didn't notice any changes myself
---
This needs more attention.  AI in NW have been buffed and should absolutely NOT be.  They also ALWAYS run in for the attack, giving away positions and wasting ammo.  It wouldn't be problematic if they weren't buffed.  I emptied 2 clips of a combat rifle into a radscorpion yesterday, as opposed to 4 or 5 bullets previously.
---
In a game mode where ammo, meds and weapons are supposed to be a scarcity, this isn't ok.  Especially in the final circle with the scorchbeast, multiple random mobs, and other players converging, it's just ridiculous.  
---
u/Valseek or another CM, do you have any input?
---
lol o I agree.
---
That sounds like a personal choice. I join random teams to look for fast travel points that suit my needs. Doesn't mean I'm not still a solo player.
---
But my lone wonder perk card 😭
---
Yeah, AI were buffed in NW. Assultrons and Grafton monsters can one-shot you, and radscorpions are tanky. I don’t yet know if I like this change or not. It’s annoying to be attacked by AI in the middle of a fire fight, but I do like more danger.
---
We will fight up close, seize the moment and stay in it
---
It's either that or meet the business end of a bayonett...
---
If you're a god tier build then I'm not surprised you don't think it's a challenge. You can't make a build that's absolutely ridiculous and then expect a fun challenge. I definitely use more meds now than before as enemies are higher levels and hit harder. Its not just "bullet sponge" lmao
---
The tse 10mm is super strong right now, it was massively buffed this patch...
---
Its just a thought eso has them so why can’t fo76 (edit: not right now of course but like maybe in the future when they fix how caps work)
---
This. I’m lvl 400+ and the nerf was really rough on me: bloodied + rifles + sneak. Beth seems to hate rifles anyway. DPS doesn’t exist. Now my weapons don’t hit hard, I’m not getting much of a sneak bonus, and thus I’m not capable of killing things in mob settings before they kill me. 
---
I liked being sneaky, and being strong, because I liked being able to help people out. To be able to get to them quickly if they needed it, or bail them out by helping with mobs, or whatever. I can barely help myself now. 😭 I play 76 to destress and enjoy myself, but honestly yesterday was such a stressful gaming experience.
---
Because be a heavy gunner PA build or go fuck your self that’s why -Bethesda- 
---
I’m dying inside, my instigating stealth sniper is now completely pointless 😭
---
When I solo, since I cant really kill the enemies unless they're in my face I just hide in the doorways with my vampires shotty(extremely useful in dailies btw)
---
thanx I have a full set of unyielding 3 SS pieces and two throw away's when I finally roll the last two I need.
---
Lol I’m kinda a low level, so if there’s one enemy it’ll use up a clip of my ammo and I can kill it with no problems, but if there’s two??? Nah I’m dead
---
I would venture a guess that eso has a lot of features FO76 doesn't have.
---
I had that as my first daily op and it was really frustrating but my damage didn’t change much so I don’t have much to complain about
---
Ah that would make sense!
---
I was starting to wonder if I was the only human who played full health, stealth when possible.
---
I don't want a build beyond "I like rifles." 😐
---
The healing will probably be patched, don't get that perk unless you REALLY have problems collecting fusion cores
---
Quick ?? The perk card that gives you + to your special is not to add more regular perks like strength =cant add  strong back but would add additional strength 5 per point
---
Agreed. This would help plenty, and would be a nice incentive to do the new content as well.
---
I’m lvl 130 and this still gets me all the time why there isn’t any respec option for say gold bullion / caps / scrip etc. Almost every modern game that relies on “builds” lets you respec and extend the game time by trying new builds at a reasonable cost.....except 76 where if you want to respec just go ahead and be a lvl 200+ player with excessive level ups unused, or just play another 20+ hours farming XP to get the levels needed to swap SPECIAL around and max out cards. And now they almost can’t introduce respec because it would piss people off to no end knowing they wasted levels changing special when they could’ve put them into legendary perks before a respec’ing system was introduced. Beth-Austin is unbelievably good at shooting themselves in the foot constantly.
---
I find it bad you can't rank up animated cards with non-animated ones. I just decided to ignore those.
---
I mean, who could be mad at a train set. besides the BoS bunker, the train set seems pretty hype. also how is the BoS Bunker, it is the one reward I really care about but I am concerned that it might turn out to be like the Chinese bunker where it looks cool on the outside, but the inside is very small
---
Ye,that &amp; the fixer being able to have “some” skins applied to it,where things I wasn’t expecting cause I didn’t see it anywhere In any notes...
---
But they’re both welcomed while unexpected changes fo sho!
---
Oh nice!

---
None of the things you mention caused me to waste 5 times more ammo and die 10 times more frequently. FO76 was already a grind, I remember wanting to give up many times until I got over level 100 and then I felt I was rewarded for all that struggle. Now they are just saying screw you, we can take away your advantage at any moment. I did just cancel my xbox live and I guess I'm off to Cyberpunk when it comes out. Will play some other games I haven't had time for because of the massive grindy time suck of Fallout 76.
---
On the test server I got the Liquid Courage plans on my first try, and that was for finishing in the second rank.  I did about 9 runs and got good enough once I knew where to go to finish a few times under 8 min and also got a plan for some signs.  I think with practice, and depending on the enemies mutations, it'll eventually be easier to get below 8 min more consistently.
---
I'm a sniper who busts out a mele when rushed, and I am *not* feeling good about this.
---
Grind the event, the same way you get any rare rewards.
---
I want to get the one for opening locks and hacking. I just can’t justify it because I don’t have the slots.
---
If your not sneaking you need PA, your going to get shredded if it's multiple enemies
---
You obviously need to go exploding palm some enemies
---
Thanks for the kind words and encouragement my friend. Yeah this is my first go around with workman's comp, and I'll just say that it isn't streamlined what so ever. I've got good BCBS insurance, but the company's paying for this one and I ain't letting them off the hook. I will say that my employer has been great to work with, and the only hassle has been the company my employer uses for our workman's comp. I also know that my employer is scared to death I am going to sue them, but I'm not that type of person. Only reason I would even contemplate legal action is if my care and rehabilitation isn't up to snuff.
---
I heard from innosurvivalist  that it’s the strongest melee right now after patch so when someone gets a legendary one it will be bad ass
---
Same IRL
---
Make it a M.I.R.V
---
And death will come quickly to your enemies
---
unfortunately for you, now you HAVE TO use power armor, at least on daily ops, at least if you going to solo it (like me). A'm also full bloodied heavy/melee (previously used minigun as primary ranged, now switched to gauss minigun. using power fist as overall main weapon, and vampiric super sledge while in PA), and you know - it still works pretty well. For openworld - i can, as previously, use power fist (yes, now it doing \~600dmg instead of \~2k, but that is enough for anything which not legendary), if i'm going to some bossfight event - i'm just putting on my T65 with emergency protocols and switching to gauss minigun - it providing best possible survivability for bloodied and very competitive damage output. If i cannot use ranged for some reason (like in todays daily ops) - i'm just switching dmg perks from heavy to 2h melee, adding Incisor perk and yeah, now i'm able to kill robots in 1-2 strikes and keep almost sustained without using stimpacks. So, bloodied melee/heavy is still very competitive build and can beat any potentially soloable content in the game (i've beat burrows with robots solo in 7m55s), of course - with right mutations, correct perk cards and smart approach.
---
Bloodied builds were definitely far too powerful and everyone flocked to them. I'll be happy if that changes too. But I also did leader of the pack and was happy as hell, events like that are actually worth doing now lol
---
You get 100 coins per 25 levels if you do nothing but scrap your cards. I don't find the grind to terrible. I'm level 380, have switched my build twice and probably lost a fair amount of perk cards due to the card deletion thing. And I have been able to max 3 cards and take a fourth to r3
---
Is the Berserker statement correct?
---
It does :')
---
Yeah, I felt godlike just mowing down low level mobs with my weapons... now everything is a bit of a challenge.  I mean ... yay?  But still, makes day to day stuff a little more involved than knocking them out fast.
---
Unarmed, with "exploding palm" and "hack and slash" is really fun right now. I went from a bloodied stealth build, to a tank that still one-shots most enemies. Although, even with almost 600 dr, I still get two-shotted by yaoguai. I'm overall happy with the update. Higher level enemies = more xp.
---
Don't you only get the rewards for elder once and every other time just gives you the bottom tier rewards
---
I think you're on the right track.  Level caps for different classes of enemy.  Sky is the limit for legendaries.
---
I just carpetbomb low-level enemies with my two-shot MIRV launcher and two-shot automatic grenade launcher. Granted I usually end up knocking myself down at some point(mainly bloodied build when not using explosives) in the process, which is why I give like 200 stimpaks a day to my playing partner so he can pick me back up. I'm pretty confident this method will continue to work with scaling, as it's something ridiculous like 2500 damage per shot. Two shots kills my pet behemoth every time.
---
Yeah, they took that ability away from us a while ago. Back when Wastelanders dropped or a bit before then, perhaps? We used to be able to do it with that or Unyielding armor. :(
---
Yeah except they never listened before
---
Yeah I do wanna do that but it will cost me 1 coin every time I switch so I might hold off being I barely use locks or computers
---
I am quite literally rocking full uny with a je lmg and a j2590 gauss mini gun. Build is heavy/commando. If you want perk loadout suggestions i got you. It is very viable just bring lots of stims to the ops
---
Yeah I basically have never gotten a good drop from anyone haha. Got all I have from trading ( except of course the gauss shotgun ). So you are a full health build?
---
I've read that a lot of the things we're seeing in this thread were brought up in the PTR and largely ignored by devs. I'm hoping now that the patch is live, they see how this type of scaling is alienating lower level players as well as higher level ones with builds not optimized to the new norm.
---
I tried an event where i had no sneak i died 3 times in 5 min.
---
10mm smg needs sights
---
Honestly, I would only add one more; the Rusty Pick.
---
With all the other free fast travel points we've got now, it makes no sense that an important place like the Rusty Pick still costs to go there (and costs quite a bit, as there are no other common landmarks or useful locations in that general area, unless you're camped/tent'd near there).
---
Sure. Then why ask them to participate when their existence there is enough to be rewarded? There's zero incentive for them to do so, especially if they don't care about max rewards.
---
Concentrated fire was meant to give a large % boost to non-automatic weapons and a smaller % boost to automatic weapons, the perk was bugged and has now been fixed.
---
Yeah I can see that, you don’t really get the best weapons you can get until you’re 45 or 50 and don’t have access to full stealth perks etc. Good luck!
---
It is the issue.
---
Auto weapons were giving 1%,2%,20% jump per rank of concentrated fire. Its was only supposed to be 1%,2%, 3% and they fixed it with this patch.
---
Semi auto weapons on the other hand have always functioned as intended.  I beleive they are 5%,10%,15% per rank of concentrated fire.
---
Did you just say Stealthys became useless?
---
I am pretty sure that they start the quest when they enter the zone though
---
What about the overseers house?
---

---
You get both the benefit and the perk card slot if you pick a legendary perk skill.  It caps out at 15 though, so you can't force your Luck up to 20, for example.  If you already have 15 points it's maxed.
---
i have a non blodied sneak niper with two shot legendaries, i went from 1 shotting super mutants and normal scorched to 3-4 shots for most things and my weapons always being broken. I like the update, but man this just sucks a bit.
---
yea its been a few months since I played, I think I was getting it confused with adrenal mutatution.
---
Rest in peace vampires swing speed knife.   You will be missed...
---
Okay it seemed really brokenly op so I assumed it was a bug lol
---
Inspirational is a pretty good alternative.
---
I just found it lazy. There was not thought into it and there is no challenge to completing it (except remembering to exit vats to bash the robots!) Its literally, go to an existing location, Hold down x a few times and then kill that assaultron at the end. No other mechanics, no puzzles, nothing.
---
Agree with you that I do like the balance changes though. End game was waaaay too easy before. Dont mind doing less damage and ive enjoyed going hunting for the newer higher level versions of all the enemy types!  Also not getting level 35 legendaries from Uranium Fever will be nice too!!  I just hope it doesn't negatively effect lower level players too much before they start adjusting and tweaking in future.
---
How exactly did "stealthys" become useless? Because of one 8 minute activity where it doesn't matter if you are in stealth or not?
---
I'm not a minmaxer, just an enthusiastic casual player playing since beta, only just made level 145. I've got no god-rolled legendaries, but I could hold my own for the most part in most fights, and help with mobs in big challenges, like the SBQ.
---
Now, everything I have is a pea shooter, so much so that I can have trouble surviving in the forest. Honestly, don't know what I'm supposed to do if I want to keep playing and have fun; my whole character went from fairly rounded to critically underpowered, and I feel like I'd have to change the whole way I play the game just to not die every other minute. It's discouraging, to say the least.
---
But the ap refresh and the dmg resist 😭
---
I’m not quite sure what you mean by this.
---
If you mean how you used to be able to inflict multiple stacks at once, that isn’t possible. You can extend the duration by repeatedly hitting the same enemy, though.
---
cope harder foodbuild
---
Feel better dude, also how many atoms did it take?
---
I managed to enter daily ops with no instructions or reference to what is going on, and 2 or 3 times in a row.
---
The exploding enemies one is obnoxiously loud and jarring. I’m not sure the stealth one even does anything because stealth is f’ed and the ammo one works crazy good , other then that I’ve gone with specials and they seem to be the move
---
It’s still high base damage. It’s taken a significant hit in damage. A decent buff to range will even that out.
---
I’d love too but I can’t rn
---
People won’t like to hear it but I feel it’s a combo of three things: people who are too focused on their numbers and aren’t think about how their damage “feels” which isn’t much different, people that were always having issues taking down enemies leveled to them, and melee cause melee definitely got hit a bit too hard.
---
oh fuck my instigating power fist is gonna be shit. fuck
---
It’s a great perk. Any stealth builds struggling with daily ops should change their stealth perk cards out for dodgy, evasive and ricochet in luck - little more protection.
---
Yep, I spent hundreds of hours building settlements in Fallout 4.  I am a very creative person and have always loved games that let you build, create or design things however you want.
---
Bloodied all star baseball bat
---
its a nice forward thrust with the weapon
---
Infiltrator is a must have. Six perk cards that no longer need to be equipped or swapped out, and all level 0 locks open for free even with just one level of it. That's gotta be the most powerful card in the game at one star, effectively giving you six perk points plus a bonus ability.
---
especially when you get dropped in camp with two broken legs, halfway in a hillside (works 50% of the time, every time)
---
Bro they don't understand. Of course they like it they all had the best guns. Me a lvl 45 with no great weapons other then a handmade I was lucky enough to find. Basically there are two camps: players who are endgame builds with shitton of supplies love the update because Now at lvl 56767 there magic weapons take two shots to kill something with their 5 star legendaries. The other camp is casual players who didnt have meta builds who hate the update because now its impossible to acquire any resources or feel like you're getting stronger at all when every enemy is the same as you
---
Because it seems the boots have no soles on the feet. How else would you explain getting hurt by a punji board while wearing buzz lightyear size steel shoes?
---
Melee is fundamentally broken in Fo76 and that includes gunbashing too, both just do not work 50/50 
---
I had to gunbash the same pistol gutsy 5 times yesterday for it to register when we were both just standing in place right beside each other. I ended up dropping multiple times as a result of the game not registering my bashes, and it was genuinely a miserable experience.
---
I got to play 3 times yesterday and everytime a team member went I joined. First time got 13 minutes second 12 then third got 730. Got a couple cool weapons not to great but I did get the vault 94 or whatever outfit. Yay lol I want the camp items
---
I have a low level alt, got from 20 to 25 pretty quick thanks to the scaling goving more xp than before and ammo has never been a problem and still isn't, it's super easy to make. My stims actually have a use now. Still didn't die once. I'll be making a new character soon I'm sure when I want to try another build, and I'm eager as hell to do so. Fallout games were never supposed to be some walk in the park. Its the fuckin apocalypse bud. It should kick your ass. And it kicks your ass now but it's survivable. I've played low and high levels, and still am super happy with it. So, there you go. Low levels complaining aren't putting in the effort, and therefore are crying about the game being too hard for them lmao. "I had to use more than 1 bullet this is hard I quit" ok bye good riddance
---
Give the enemies low detection at a range, but high detection up close. That way, you’re forced to kill some in order to stay undetected.
---
I did it solo in a full set of unyielding,and ultracite power armour.
---
It was horrible.
---
Really not fun atall.
---
I went through like 60 Stim packs.And i dont really have many,being level 400 i had no previous use for them.
---
No idea why anyone at Bethesda would think the player base would enjoy this event on the back of a 50% Nerf on bloodied.Huge Buff on damage with Gutsies who were already difficult to kill,and now protectrons.Armour in this game is pretty much pointless.Starting to wonder why i even bothered grinding it all out.
---
I was already struggling with the damage Nerf,i couldn't even go in to Stealth either.
---
If all that was not bad enough you were constantly  swapping from Heavy weapon to Melee weapon to finish them off whilst 2,3 other Gutsise are ripping you a new arsehole with depleted [Uranium.It](https://Uranium.It) was near on impossible.
---
I completed and killed the big Boss and got a few rewards.
---
I wont be doing it again though.
---
Some are saying it is best to run through the event avoiding all confrontation.
---
Not even sure this is possible because they horde group all the way through,and spawn relentlessly.Even using 60 Stimpacks and dying a few times i was constantly needing to hide and take cover.
---
The thing that bothers me is that I get the feeling that the base damage from which all these bonuses and buffs are calculated off is the raw base damage of the weapon unmodded.
---
You'd think the most logical thing is whatever the overall weapon does, that's what you calculate all the other damage bonuses. I don't think that's the case.
---
If only there was a way to acquire materials in this game.
---
I'm a 43 stealth build VATS sniper. Most even level enemies drop from 1 .50cal headshot, maybe 2 if they are more resilient., like Super Mutant Enforcers and such. Legendary's take a bit to down but not an insane amount. I use the Chinese Stealth Suit so I'm pretty much always in stealth and are constantly critting.  
---
For Assualttrons and other heavily armored baddies, I'll open with a VATS crit from a Dragon black-powder, then it's 3-5 hits from my hunting rifle.  
---
Is it tougher than last week? Yes.  
---
Is it impossible? No.  
---
Actually makes the game more fun to me since I'm not just steamrolling enemies and you level quick as shit since pretty much anything you kill nets you a decent amount of XP. A radroach that used to give 4 XP now gives 82 XP. Should hit 50 by this weekend and can start doing Op's
---
Loved my shotgun, wasn't great for high levels but fun for one shot around the forest and of course exploding cars.  Now just need my axe.  Also think they should maybe lower the way jobs level as I'm 111 and now the lowest I see is 50.  Don't feel safe being a single player anymore.
---
lmao. good thing i only really planned on having the base level of it.
---
Wow, that's scary. One guy's attempt at a quick fix could have killed someone. Glad you're ok.
---
Perfect what's your gamertag
---
I'm seriously considering ranking up the SPECIAL perks over the niche ones.
---
Yeah kinda killed the game for me. It works in eso because there is oodles of content in a massive world. Not so much here
---
Don’t speak for all of us, please. :) Clearly not all of us are happy with it. It has some nice stuff, absolutely, but I for one do not enjoy the One Wasteland aspect.
---
Yeah, same. Gonna be sad to pack up my water farm. I've been farming water there and selling it to White Springs for a long time. I just can't take it anymore lol
---
You seem not to understand my point. Why complain that they're not participating in the daily op when there is no reason for them to because just by entering, they get rewarded.
---
Pisdoffpizaboy
---
My favourite part about the single player Fallout games is this: If something was in the game, then *that was how it stayed.* None of this “Oh, we have people whinging and bitching about Bloodied, we need to take that down a peg”, or “holy shit, melee is too powerful, let’s neuter the fuck out of that.” Absolutely no bullshit, if it’s good it stays good, and if it’s trash it stayed trash!
---
i hadnt considered that medic builds might be of use now. very interesting. maybe the tsffr flamer will be worth using in daily ops to heal your team
---
Five shoots to kill something = useless for a stealth rifleman
---
A reward from the A Colossal Problem event, prior to P.22 I got one an gave it to a melee friend an he was doing up to 8k damage, I'll get back to you with the post P.22 damage but it's A reaally good 2H melee weapon.
---
They are not yet in the game, we will post an update in a future Inside The Vault when it goes into the game.
---
Right. I have to rethink my whole build.
---
You can't grind the event like SE or ACP. It's completed once a day and resets. Only common rewards are given after elder is completed.
---
Anyone know if the tesla coil mod for PA counts as melee? Will it kill them?
---
That's ruff buddy
---
nice, I still didnt get even 1 unyelding SS piece
---
My friend we had the same worries. After being excited about the bunker bundle that came out a couple weeks ago that came with the fence, and getting burned by it, I was metering my expectations pertaining to the BoS bunker. Well I'll ease your mind and tell you that it appears that Bethesda actually quality tested the BoS bunker. It doesn't have the floating issues what so ever, you can easily place it, and it's honestly kick ass. Just like the garage, it has the option to directly hook power to it (3 power required) and that allows the whole bunker to radiate power to your other objects you put in it. Also when you hook up power, it causes minimal amount of fog to dispense around the door. There's sets of buttons that open the door on the outside/inside, and unlike the Chinese bunker, the doors separate and go into the walls. It honestly was worth the Atoms just for it.
---
I moved camps and stupid tree is coming through my red rocket garage. I can’t seem to get the building as the bunker red rocket garage, blood eagle structure , and train car to sit flat to have it look decent. I will have to move the whole camp again because it annoys me seeing my building floating in air. So the bulldozer would be nice to fix being I only used it once during launch when they added it.
---
I got the ammo factory perk. I need ultracite plasma cartridges so this helps me greatly.

---
No its literally artificial difficulty same with earle. They're just bad at making real boss fights i think.
---
Yes, always. That combined with power armor, dodgy,  empath, protocols,  power armor reboot and electric absorption makes me almost invincible
---
Maybe in next couple of years 🙄
---
Yeah we're a lot alike then, because I could spend all day setting up/rearranging my camp and be just fine.
---
No clue. Could be an issue with redditpoll vs. mobile browsers?
---
Looks like rain to me, with some sunlight reflecting off of it. When I was playing last night, the rain caught my attention too. Couldn't put my finger on why it seemed different, or if it even was different.
---
I'd recommend turning off some of your active quests for improved experience - the wall of text on the right of the screen would stress me out, not to mention all the markers they'd put on the compass. I tend to keep it at about 3 max, and if I'm on a quest in a maze-like interior, I'll turn off all of them bar the one I'm doing.
---
Edit: try turning the volume up next time you see that screen effect, the rain also makes some low-volume noise, but I only really pick it up when I'm wearing headphones.
---
you’ve felt free to complain about things in the game that weren’t balanced to your liking. don’t gatekeep others expressing their experience when the game changes to imbalance them, just because you are fine this time.
---
I struggled with the defending.
---
Having to Swap a Heavy Gun for a Melee weapon to finish off a Gutsie,whilst the res of the Gutsiest are shooting and shredding your armour is a nightmare.
---
Definitely no good for a bloodied build.
---
I see what you mean, but increased shouldn’t mean infinite. Even if it is better for the next one, cases like the mole miner supervisor are still an issue. You are indefinitely targeted until they die.
---
Ah so if you don’t get a rare reward when completing the first 3 tiers, repeating the daily op any more after that won’t drop any at all?
---
it does. it's the bread and butter of commando builds. although concentrated fire has just been nerfed/'fixed'.
---
Dodgy and lone Wanderer could help
---
Yeah nah. The game was far too easy and I wasn't some min max build with a god roll weapon. Now enemies hit harder and take more damage and give more xp. Win, win, win. Events like leader of the pack are worth doing now as you don't get level 5 or 10 legendaries but appropriately leveled ones. Bloodied builds shouldn't have been able to be so powerful to begin with anyways, and I'm glad that now that they aren't as powerful people will branch out and try other things for once. If your bloodied getting nerfed makes you upset enough to quit, you didnt enjoy the game, you enjoyed deleting everything you looked at and being essentially a god, which is stupid. Update made the game feel more fresh, and actually have some challenge to it. I'm very happy to see it.
---
I'll raise this and see what's going on.
---
I had my zealots fast swing speed cultist dagger. I called it the “Prison Shank” and it worked wonders
---
i just want a reflex
---
Look who's in the pocket of Big Geometry...
---
I hope we see this posted all day today.
---
Build underground

---
 &gt; I'll raise this and see what's going on.
---
It's not a solution, it's bullshit. I went to do daily ops yesterday and now I'm with 0, ZERO, ammunition for my weapons. Now I need to quit the game, because I lost everything, that I farmed past last month. Shame, because I was so exited for new season.
---
Correct. Gotta wait for the reset.
---
Well not catering and rendering useless are two very different things imo.
---
You are absolutely correct, and praise God I was far enough back that my leg was the only thing that got caught. Thanks again for the kind words
---
I 100% agree Uvtha, I play rifleman/stealth/Vats critical build I used to do 2000-3000 dmg per shot, now I do about 400 max, molerats and dumb things take longer to kill for the same reward.
---
If you need to disable a key mechanic (stealth) for your game to play right, then there is a fundamental problem with the game. Why are players who invested time into a stealth build being bent over?
---
To be honest this update sapped all the enjoyment I was having out of the game, I'm considering quitting for good.
---
Even if you complete the 3 tiers and don't get a rare rewards repeating them that day will not let you roll for more. You only get the 1 chance per tier
---
My gauss rifle sniper build can still one shot super mutants. Just have to charge more
---
Basically, no point in even being stealth after the first shot with the way it works currently
---
Something like that. In terms of code, it would be making the decay of the effectiveness of their detection decrease at x^3 or x^4 factor instead of x^2, assuming x^2 is default.
---
You do the same my friend, and you have a good day as well!
---
Wanna take a shot every time and die of alcohol poisoning together?
---
I'm not a PA Heavy Gunner build, and my build is just as viable, if not better, than it was before.
---
Im a handgun build, with an aae 10mm , i kill lvl 100 muties in 4 shots. 3 shots if a crit is used, 3 shots with full adrenaline (rank 1) ,2 shots if a crit is used and adrenaline is up.
---
You shluld be doing more damage than my little 10mm. I beleive my pipboy damage is only 63? Not 100% sure would have to look after work.
---
: )
---
Wallace? He's my favourite little anarcho-capitalist straight outta Harper's Ferry is he not?
---
Shafted :\
---
And let the rest of us put it in the stash.
---
I know , it’s a sad day my friend
---
I just shot until the bar was empty, ran up and gun bashed. Worked well enough for me. I liked that the ops have modifiers to make you reconsider your approach and debate how you're gonna go about doing it.
---
They were playing the game before the update. They were level 30 before the update and having fun without their overpowered weapons. Now, with the update, they noticed a significant change. 
---
I don't understand why it's so hard for people to accept that maybe things aren't tuned exactly right and you think people are just bitching because "game is too hard." Not only did they change enemy levels, but they changed how damage is calculated too. Why is it hard to say "Maybe they went too hard in one direction and need to fine tune it more." No, it's better to say people are just bitching. 
---
Yeah well, if people don't play because of this, that's lower player numbers, and less support for the game in the future.
---
I got a too many layers popup. I didn't have an ammo factory setup. Not thrilled.
---
Much appreciated.
---
You only need one to complete the quest.
---
Yes thanks, I’d missed the shotgun one &amp; the second heavy gun one was to reiterate about fire rate being a factor, that’s where I became confused when people said “magic shotgun”. 
---
The whole damage thing is broken, the numbers mean nothing. Shot a scorched in VATS nearly killed him, shot him again not VATS, healed him to near full health!!
---
Thanks for clearing this up for me
---
I question why they even did this ... who actually wanted enemies that match your level. It’s never been a feature that Bethesda fans have wanted, going way back to early Elder Scrolls games.
---
It’s like the developers take two steps forward and one step back constantly. Just as I was ready to praise them for the turn around with Wastelanders, they throw out something that ruins a major part of the game.
---
Correct is was a bug present for 2 years. This is bethesda after all. 
---
I am not confusing the % damage.
---
Well, load outs are kind of hard to have in a game so focused on builds, where we choose perk points over the course of 50 levels. 
---
You can’t really jump between a type of build as quickly as you might think.
---
I'm on PS4, first real opportunity to play since patch went live... 4 server disconnects trying to load into game, another 3 while actually playing.... All within an hour... Might come back tomorrow, see if servers have stabilised....
---
I still have a bunch of those 'kill a bunch of scorched with a crossbow' and pistol and whatever quests waiting to be finished up. The level scaling is going to make that a lot harder. 
---
It's also going to really suck for low level people who happen upon an area where a high level person has already spawned all the baddies, unless they are literally going to scale them on a 1:1 basis.
---
After playing quite a bit last night, my instigating lever action can hold its own, taking down about anything level 75 or less with a sneak headshot. Though it is much harder to stay hidden after this update.
---
lol my cousin that I party up with gets mad at me all the time because I move my camp weekly.  I cant help it tho, there are so many great spots to build I cant imagine staying in one location for more than a couple weeks.
---
I'm in a similar boat. But I at least have shotty to fall back on. That still does adequate damage if I can get close enough.  SBQ lands more now so that helps and honestly, the SBQ event I did yesterday was amazing. It was the chaos that is everything I love about Fallout.
---
considering it's bolt rifles he's talking about, yes. autos are dealing essentially the same damage and are, well, fully automatic. literally no reason to use bolts if they can't even one shot enemies anymore.
---
Either way they’ve cut my balls off so I’m running away from Appalachia. I’m going to DC, maybe someone there will appreciate me and won’t cut what’s left of them off. When I’m bored of DC, I’ll head to the Mojave. Makes you wish for a nuclear winter.
---
PvP people abusing it was such an unfair advantage when the opponent can’t move or fight back
---
On one build?  Try stealth commando. Works like a dream
---
My TS Gatling gun is doing decent work tbf
---
Thanks to scaling, high-level players will be the only ones doing them. Campfire Tales in particular is a killzone now for anyone below 150 and/or without a meta loadout.
---
Hey! You get 3 rolls a day. 1 for each tier. 5% for Initiate, 10% for Paladin, 80% for Elder. So technically you could get 3 rare rewards but if you hit Elder already you gotta wait for the next day. 
---
It tells you if you’ve already completed those tiers before you join. You’ll know if it’s new because it will be a different location you’re fighting in.
---
I think it really depends on the build. In PA, I would highly recommend Electrical Absorption. It is crazy OP. What Rads is a great one for non-bloodied. I haven't used radaway since equipping it.
---
I don't plan on taking the SPECIAL perks on any of my builds. In order to max them out, you need to scrap perk cards, so if you want to get the most out of them, you might not even have any perk cards left to equip beyond what you are already using.
---
The Whale is strong in this one.
---
damn I had always ignored them cause I figured they were probably too lazy to do another animation, maybe this would make bashing easier. My bad Bethesda, guess I underestimated you.
---
Always assumed all three were needed.
---
Ahahaha, good.
---
Are legendary cultist daggers legacy? Or am I thinking of something else?
---
Question, for when you get around to it - what’s the difference between the new gauss pistol skin and the normal one? I legitimately can not tell.
---
I definitely wouldn't do them before 50 unless you can take a good bit of damage, and I'd find a team. I only solo'd as I couldn't find a team and when I solo'd I got the 2nd tier rewards and once I got a team we did it so I could get the 1st tier rewards. The enemies were level 75 for me, idk if they scale in ops like every where else and they hit pretty hard. (The ops do change tho so you never know the next one could be easier I'm not sure)
---
Shotgun damage calculations are currently bugged. Shotguns are supposed to divide the total damage of your shotgun among all the pellets, each one flies out to the target with the potential to miss or hit different parts of the body, and then calculate based on armor penetration &amp; other bonuses to determine how much damage they do
---
Right now, when used normally, the pellet's damage display is bugged. The game initially drops your target's health meter as if each pellet were doing the **full** damage of your shotgun, but then the server realizes "Oh hey, these are shotgun pellets" and divides them appropriately. This causes the target's health to drop and then go back up as it recalculates, but it's just a visual glitch.
---
However, in VATS, it's bugged so that each pellet gets the **full** damage of the shotgun and *does not* divide the damage back down. So every pellet which hits does the full shotgun blast of damage, and they **add together**. Which basically means each shotgun blast is doing 6x damage in VATS, letting you one-shot lots of things.
---
**tl;dr** let's say your shotgun shows it does 300 damage. That is supposed to get divided among (I believe) 6 pellets, meaning each pellet is supposed to do 50 damage. In VATS, those six pellets are doing 300 damage **each**, for a combined 1800 damage to your target.
---
....Yes it does?
---
I mean the daily op yesterday was nothing but stabbing things. Or smashing them with a hammer in my case. There will always be a place for stabbing things in 76
---
Best mention what platform you're on, for PC the mod **Perk Loadout Manager** is close to this, still need to click into the perk card page, no hot key within game screen.
---
my luck has run dry as of late and the SS pieces are okay but not assume rolls but none the less they are uny
---
Lets be honest its already to late to fix it... This update is death sentence for the game soon we will see huge drops in players.
---
&gt; Bethesda actually quality tested
---
now that is a phrase I have not heard in a long time.
---
and that BoS Bunker sound well worth the grind. I can not wait to unlock it. I am only 69 ranks away. lol.
---
I can't wait to turn my camp into hidden valley, and when personal bunkers come out, cant wait to make that into my entrance
---
It goes against the style of play in the rest of the game. It’s overly resource intensive unless you just run away from everything. It lacks any real narrative or point for the main game. It’s bad game design, it’s not fun, and it doesn’t add much to the base game. Use your brain.
---
I like the new level scale. We will have to adapt to it but will result in a funnier gameplay.
---
I don't get it haha
---
You get downvoted for saying 'I saw a post' as apposed to 'I saw some conclusive, irrefutable evidence'.
---
TS was uneffected by the patch in terms of solely it's effect. However, the accuracy ding is still too major for me to use.
---
Ive had that happen, or lately ive paid for something and it won't show up in my inventory or something disappears entirely, ive been saving up 5mm ammo finally getting over 1000, just for my 2-star legendary Gatlin gun to disappear when I moved it to my inventory. FML I can't even find another one
---
&gt; To be clear my build was not a one-shot everything build... It was balanced, I spent a long time getting my character where I liked it, and I enjoyed playing because of it.
---
This game has always been harder if you aren't willing to totally min/max your character from one extreme or another.
---
I don’t think the Queen was effected , my Gatling plasma does more damage to her after this update when I swap in my cards for it
---
There was a post about this last night, unless that was you (can't remember the username) then that's a real let down on Bethesda's part. It might be a pain in the ass, but try find your bank transfer from when you purchased it before getting hold of Bethesda, that way they can't try denying that you ever had it. Best of luck clearing it up with them.
---
I thought throwing a grenade was part of it?
---
Haven't done that. But I was in PA in a nuke zone with that full perk and I was not gaining any radiation at all.
---
Huh. I wonder if that’s a bug, since that’s almost as bad as four bears spawning at your camp at max level to attack it.
---
Took a look at my Vats Unknown blaster after the patch as well as a vampire pipe revolver in my stash. The damage numbers were 33 and 56 without parks for both lvl 50 weapons. A gun made of pipes does almost twice the damage of a gun made by aliens, even after it was buffed.
---
I honestly am wondering if things have less armor. They don't take much longer to kill, after all. It would explain why youd be doing more damage too
---
do score rewards go to all of your characters ?
---
Cool, thanks
---
Ever heard of disposable income? Lol
---
It's amazing isn't it?? I got 300 pts out of them and I was being super conservative, too. So nice to not have it cluttering up my deck!
---
I hate your guts yet want to kiss your mouth at the same time I’m so confused about how I feel right now 😂
---
Lone wanderer if you’re solo but new daily ops and ect make that impossible. Dodgy is good but require AP to use and useless in high fire rate enemies. Also if you’re berserker having both will only let you live off 4 hits max if you’re building defensive. Not worth it and the only reason to invest in it is if you believe Bethesda will buff it
---
If what you say is true, then it renders the perk card mostly useless after Rank 1 for autos. I may as well just engage a little closer and start shooting away then. Could find better uses for 2 perk slots than a couple of meager percentage per shot.
---
You also can't display Fixers.   And the legendary ones are having an identity crisis.   They are all now named The Fixer.  At least the legendary effects still work on them.
---
I’m a newer player and I’ve received a handful of legendary cultists daggers.
---
I was only mentioning it because SBQ can be crippled now so she's on the ground more which is great for shotty.
---
Now? Boi radical tussle been the event for awhile now
---
I still have no idea if they actually do any damage or not to nearby mobs. I can't seem to find anything about it. Seems like nobody bothered testing that on PTS. What Rads you can't pick for a bloodied build, right?
---
Is that factoring in the fact that you're constantly losing rads from What Rads? At that level of rads do you think you could do something like kill ghouls at Whitesprings without a ton of radaway?
---
Hey bro I'm down. I've always been told that "it's only gay if the balls touch" 😉 hahaha 😂
---
Should be*
---
Really now. I do have some solid vamp weapons on mule. May have to break those out now. Thanks for the tip.
---
I used a shorty to get the enemies to a sliver then swapped in my melee to finish them off.
---
It was chaotic hilarity!!!
---
Only the perk cards from level will give you 500 points plus packs. Id say its worth the time.
---
I'm so into it!! My only complaint is I wish they would fix building and stop taking away the bugs that allow for creativity. But other than that, this update is great!
---
I have a separate character that is heavy guns PA build. My rifleman has weight reduction under strength making it impossible to swap over to a big guns on the fly.
---
Either way, it's not just bullet sponge lol. Enemies scaling to you means fights will actually be fights, not just walking through the open not using cover and one tapping everything, eating bullets like is nothing
---
What platform? I keep my vendors in a lil saferoom but it's a pain to move everything in there
---
My weapons arent magic and i still kill things either only slightly slower or a little faster. Maybe one wasteland doesnt actually up their resistances and it goes off of what the base enemy would have had.
---
That's surprising. I started a couple months before Season 1 and definitely was able to use guns fine. I had multiple guns mind you, and sometimes I would run out of one type of ammo, but generally had enough to use my others until I got more. I wasn't swimming in ammo, but I could play the game just fine.
---
Also the extra xp and rewards from completing it id say are worth going and collecting a mere 25 ore for 1/4 completion and once you hit that it spawns some harder (more xp) enemies
---
what do you mean "activate?"
---
Not near as terrifying, but very unexpected and awesome...mongrel horde in the ash heap last night, of course they’re all lvl50+ I think the alphas were 60...but anyway mangling mongrels right along and I saw it. Alpha deathclaw rumbling at me. Granted it’s still just a deathclaw but it was a total surprise
---
Like, just slap power user in intelligence, hop into Power armor and call it a day? I tried yesterday but It was still pretty bad, but I'm ready to accept that It was user error
---
Jesus Christ, the Fusion Reactor is overkill already...
---
Wtf are you trying to power up??
---
New Gad? Its west of White Springs in the dried up river bed that is east of the powerplant and south of Vault 76.
---
Mine are still there.  https://ibb.co/NsDntSd
---
You’re thinking of something else because recently got a legendary cultist dagger a couple days ago
---
Ugh, same. I get why people would do it, but I was so disappointed every time I showed up and scorched were raining.
---
Oh my rifle was nerfed from 998 to 638, not terrible,  I think I have it better.  I also tried a full health AA gauss rifle against a Super mutant demolisher,  level 75 Scorchbeast and Mirelurk queen. 
---
http://imgur.com/a/tn0QFP0
---
If you're xbox, I can give the AA one for free if you like.
---
If your already a tanky type build just go bloodied PA with EP. 
---
I ran ops and the gusty was only dealing 3 to 4 damage to me per shot.
---
I’m a heavy weapon user and use taking one for the team. 
---
Sneaky with follow through is pretty good as well.
---
Automatic would be the best for dps while single shot is better at conserving ammo.
---
Unyielding would be he best to use period if your a bloodied.
---
*Smiles in literally just re-naming any gun so it stays at the top*
---
I mean does it work with shotguns i have it on 4 stars rn and i use stealth with shotguns.
---
Just be on the lookout for people using the power armour trick to come in through a window or through a window if you have a bench too close.
---
What build though?
---
And as my previous post shows you also get downvoted for calling out shit stirrers for being the inadequate plankton they are.
---
The game is a lot more realistic.
---
Now i need 3,4 shots of an explosive 50 Cal Sniper Rifle to kill a Ghoul at Path to enlightenment instead of 2.
---
I gave up and just used a bloodied Deathclaw that also needed 2,3 swipes to kill a Ghoul.
---
It was amazing have to shoot a Sentrybot 20 times,instead of 2 with a 50 Cal to make it explode.
---
Protectrons and Mole Miners are now Aprex predators in one wasteland.
---
Uranium Fever was fun,everyone firing Heavy weapons
---
Xbox has its own selection for it. It’s not the greatest stuff I rather buy the other stuff like raider and settler pack If you don’t have it. I got all the packs as I preordered the 85 dollar one back at launch. I used the Uncle Sam outfit for maybe a week then never again
---
It exists as a 1* drop from monster mash, because that pool hasn't been changed since launch. But that was as of a few updates ago so it *could* have recently been changed
---
This is Bethesda’s middle finger to its bloodied players.  We essentially killed this build, now flood the market with bloodied weapons!
---
Ahahahahahahaha!!!!
---
On console, yes. There are a lot of us, you might be surprised at how many people are still in lobbies.
---
This was the first any evidence other than some dude said was presented. If you opened with this, we wouldn't have gone so deep.
---
I'll check out the PTS discussion on this issue. Thanks.
---
Literally not the point.  I'm having no trouble surviving, I completed the CHORE dailies and the daily ops a number of times.  My TSE handmade is capable for firefights, but it's now my only viable gun.  The point isn't that the game is harder, the point is that it's different.
---
Sounds like the best solution.  Rank 2 of ground pounder or glow sight may be a good filler.
---
That's something I missed being low level and not having good gear.
---
I used to use mines alot. 
---
I would see a group of enemies, look around and guestimate their pathing. Lay out mines in places I think i could get them to pause, essentially laying out an ambush. An start it off with a hunting rifle, switching to different weapons as they closed in.
---
Before the nerf, once I got a high level, it was a double tap from my rifle and they were dead. Will have to see if that style returns, only did daily op yesterday and that was not fun, was just annoying.
---
If you were one shotting things before and you're a "limp noodle" now, you're 100% one of the people these nerfs were targeting. Sorry, but not a lot of sympathy.
---
As a big gunner I have barely noticed a difference in damage outputs. Some of my AA guns are better than they were before actually.
---
There's an Armor Ace rap?
---
Well op isn't the only one to say that... Seen a few comments and posts about the update, sayin
---
stealth and bloodied builds went to shit and/or useless.
---
Yes because Bethesda’s patch notes are always accurate and they never break new things when they patch. 
---
I hope you get vendor ganked.
---
I got one plan for elder yesterday and it was the vault 94 outfit plan. Wanted the camp items ugh
---
Just going to blue print and store the whole lot for now hopefully won't use any of me items from stash when crafting.
---
This made me sad
---
I think angry turtle did a bit of testing and has a vid on it. Believe it's number 4 of his testing vids.
---
Yeah what rads would kill a bloody build since it constently removes rads
---
I made a new character a Stealth rifleman build, at lv50 only have 5int for demo expert. Hopped into some t51b took bunch of stims and I was able to solo it easily. Did many runs as a team and got it under 6mins.
---
I saved the perk cards I could add to my builds and depending on the character, still have 250-300 perk coins. Electrical Absorption seems great for Daily Ops the burrows but you don't fight robots all the time so I am still on the fence about that one. I am pretty much able to max one legendary perk per character and pick 4 other legendary, thats why I was thinking of getting SPECIAL for one QoL card like fast travel. My builds never have those cards equipped all the time.
---
Yeah you can still kill shit with those numbers , the lever action hits like a bb gun now
---
The perk applies a debuff so the first shot wouldn't have the bonus damage and depending on server latency the second shot should if enough time has passed to register the debuff on the enemy.
---
I just said it was good....?
---
I'm not noticing them being spongy, just hitting harder
---
Glowing behemoth that spawns in that pond is usually lvl 95
---
I don’t run PA at all. Don’t like it. Never have.
---
He’s not singing. Not quite a rap but whatever he’s doing rap would be the closest explanation
---
I mean I still destroy everything with a few shots. I think people are mad just to be mad.
---
Why dont you talk about acid, lead or other valuable items, which fo1st members can have in thousands? Or hundreds of stable flux, they use to trade with (it common to trade like 200 stable flux for a gun, when caps have no value)
---
Could be so that the lower level enemies get easier while the higher levels only get a bit harder. I suppose Bethesda cared to make sure that enemies werent massively bullet spongy
---
Well yh cause that would be way to op for builds and  crouching maked it balanced
---
There is a big change in damage, but not significant enough to be unplayable. It's offset by the fact that even level mobs means more XP.  
---
I used to be able to one-two shot most non-legendary baddies. Now I can still one-two shot most weaker baddies (Scorched, regular Muties, bugs). Takes 3-4 for the more heavily armored ones (assaultrons, strong muties, heavy animals). Legendary's take a bit of strategy and about 20-25 shots. I dropped a 3-Star Sheepsquatch near the Welch Station. Took about 5 minutes of hit and run tactics and about 30 shots between the Dragon and Hunting Rifle. Cleared Welch of the Mole Miners for Black Titanium and most of them were one shot kills.  
---
This is assuming that I start on my terms, if I'm not paying attention and get ambushed, I run and utilize Escape Artist then set myself up to take them out from Higher Ground (It's over Anakin) if outside or from the corner of an adjacent room/hallway if inside. The Stealth Suit is nice but it makes me a very squishy glass canon.
---
I got the glave today just seems bit pointless running multiple runs for no rewards. Unless helping friends.
---
My luck -1 at this point
---
Idk if that's the case here or not, it was just something that came to mind when I saw it. I myself don't mind gradual progression either, mostly quest based though because the levels just seem to find their own way up, but there's no rush to get anywhere in a game super quick and the more spread out the longer you can enjoy it. I definitely prefer having scaled enemies though, that's a certainty it's the best thing they have done yet.
---
It was, and then it wasn’t. It seems like they have fixed the frame issues when there are tons of meat piles. At least, I didn’t encounter it yet. Prior to that the event was pretty rough on the frames.
---
I guess? I would assume so since my shotgun seems to have an easier time killing things now.
---
nothing stopping you from being a bloodied heavy gunner. PA is actually the only way you'll be truly tanky as a bloodied build, thanks to its hidden damage reduction bonus and emergency protocols. outside of PA you should definitely be sneaking, yes. regular armor won't cut it unless you have some esoteric build. but keep in mind the sneak multiplier won't trigger in groups, or rather, if your target is in combat with anything else, player or mob.
---
unyielding is usually the go-to and a lot of people say it's op. yes, the bonuses are really good. but I think it's more like every other prefix suck, kinda. and people don't really know that creature-specific armor is better than vanguard and bolstering, which are actually useless in most builds. chameleon specifically is a lot better for just sneaking than unyielding, too. depends on whether your build needs the special bonuses or not, and if you want to prioritize sneaking over everything else.
---
bolt rifles also got nerfed hard with this update, if that's what you're asking. commando used to be the way to go, now it's the only way to go. I suppose you could use a semi, but at that point no reason not to go full auto.
---
This is not what I asked but ok? 😂
---
There needs to be better ways to start daily ops with people. We had a daily ops group of 4 last night and me and my partner stood at the start doing the “come here” emote for about 10 minutes and they didn’t come. I ended up kicking them from the group. No idea why you’d be in the group if you’re not going to join, just wasting space for other people that may want to group up.
---
It's hard to nerf 1 dmg per hit?
---
Pretty sure the devs dislike fractions, so enjoy your "relative damage boost" 😁
---
I still do it w/ my AA SS +1S Combat Dagger. I just shifted my Head RP from being Rambo to being a Ninja.
---
I've read it real quick last night and wasn't 100% sure I completely understood how it works. I am gonna check Angry Turtle's then. Hope he did test on the explosive cards.
---
Shhhhhh quite, or they’ll nerf those as well!
---
I use a AA fixer and Instigating shotguns (gauss and combat).
---
The way things are going, ill make some adjustments to fit It in. Have you tested? How often does It proc?
---
So now it's even less likely that people will actually go out to collect ore?
---
Its an old trick but find a static critter spawn of like two roaches and build on it , you will have just them to deal with not all these crazy spawns. I moved back to the tick shack right before the update and just have my tics to kill which my ally does easily
---
Good to know! I'm telling ya I learn something new about this game every day and I've been playing it since it came out. I'm going to try that today, thank you!
---
He did. Pretty sure it was in, legendary perks tested part 4
---
*Laughs in Two-Shot*
---
It is taking me 3 shots.
---
1 st shot takes about 50% enemy health
---
2nd shot enemy health jumps back up to about 75%.
---
3rd shot kills some times
---
Although i have need 4.
---
Seriously hate this update.
---
Ironically bloodied minigun still shreds the Queen.Bethesda need to sort this out ASAP sarcasm.
---
I think so!
---
To be fair I never play like that anyway. I could see how this would be annoying to rush in tank builds but I'm always sneaky. The fights aren't different, they just take *slightly* longer and a bit more ammo. It's not more challenge. 
---
For example FO4's survival mode was more challenge, enemies were a threat. Or something like FO4 Frost. This is just math tax.
---
People are saying ammo Smith (for those who burn through ammo, such as automatic and heavy gun builds), master infiltrator (because lock picking and hacking is tedious) and I personally would add survival syringes (with rejuvenated, I can have 70% disease resist, faster ap and more max health, full hunger and water frequently enough where I don’t have to even upgrade the card, and an emergency heal if I have to).
---
Of course, all the stat ups are good. My PA rifleman just learned how to sneak thanks to legendary agility, and it’s made his damage output much better.
---
PA recharge is also excellent for anyone in PA due to the healing, and reboot isn’t terrible either since it uses nothing and has no cool down.
---
Brawling chemist, though... I did the math, and assuming I’m right on strength giving 2.5% more damage perk level, it’s only a 2.5% boost over using a psychobuff. For melee (which got quite a bit), it’s solid if you make a point of using chems, though I wish they changed the +30% melee damage to just regular damage, which would allow every build to use it.
---
It didn't ruin stealth lol my stealth build still works great and is doing noting but getting better. If anyones getting screwed it's bloodieds and I'm okay with that. Bloodieds have been gods for too long, just deleting whatever they make eye contact with. If you quit over a good patch, all I can say is good riddance lol
---
So yesterday on Xbox we fought Earle twice and queen once. We all finished them each in ten minutes. The damage numbers def aren’t high like they where but you can still do it. I doubt we can solo it tho. Don’t know we will have to wait and see. I’m sure ppl used magic weapons last night also being their health’s went pretty quick. But it’s nice to see the queen actually landing more being we can cripple her
---
Seems to be the same as my characters normal waist, I think that it's just more noticeable than normal.
---
Man, it took 2 hits each with my Bloodied Puncturing Power Fist to kill wolves in the horde event.  I think I might turn junkies build so at least I can have a health bar.  Weeks reallocating points &amp; buying perks, days rolling secret service pieces( &amp; caps spent but that's nothing).  I'm scared shitless I'll get in a new build &amp; Bethesda goes " Hey, people hated it, soooooo here's some of that damage back."  I mean, I get the nerf, I shouldn't be hitting in the thousands, but there needs to be some pros to running at 20%hp.
---
Definitely the ally to defend your camp
---
Ah. The theme song on the scoreboard, I assume? If so, I concur that it's dope, gives me classic G.I. Joe vibes that I haven't felt... well since I watched those cartoons 😂. Honestly I'd love for Bethesda to expand on Armor Ace and friends, like the Unstoppables.
---
I can’t even download the update yet, but I’m not looking forward to seeing how my base behind the Helvetia post office does since every time I spawn in every scorched in Helvetia rushes my base...
---
(I have a feeling Gilbert, my level 30 pet mirelurk king, is going to die first time I load in.)
---
Yes,it was complete bullshit. Especially when I had no idea how to get to one of tbe objectives.
---
One: I said if you’re thinking about deleting or not playing the game because it is now “unbalanced” then you should do it and not comment on reddit basically begging for attention, which I stand by. 
---
Two: Im assuming you’re referring to me complaining encrypted was unbalanced which by the way is completely different because that is 1 event not the entirety of the game and Its not like I don’t take my own advice because I purposely didn’t play encrypted purely for the fact that its was unbalanced so. So next time don’t be so quick to be a justice warrior and read the comments and/or post before comenting👍
---
I always happy to see them, that acid and springs, they can attack my camp how much they want (they never do 😑)
---
I have been somewhat regularly playing the game since launch, so I don't have a "newbie meeting the Chad high lvl player" story, but I have met people of every lvl donating supplies to each other. I was walking around in power armor for a while till I saw a guy trapped inside the Charleston Fire Dept by a sheepsquatch. I start doing damage to the sheepsquatch and we both eventually managed to kill it together. He gave me his only fusion core and some junk as thanks. I ended up giving him some meds and ammo as thanks for the core and junk. He didn't have to give me anything, but he took the time to thank me for saving his life and helping him kill his first sheepsquatch.
---
Oh I think it’s the cultist blade I was thinking of
---
Isn't that a setting per toon?
---
I just used a surpressor's flamer to down the boss easy lol
---
Honestly I'm in the same boat. I'm not the best at the game and was just starting to go to higher level areas. Now I'm getting the crap kicked outta me in the starting area because everything is level 50... =.=
---
Correct. You can get stats over 15 but you can’t equip cards over 15.
---
Try dropping worthless notes.
---
Is that factoring in the rad loss per second or just what it says on your screen?
---
This is probably my favourite thing about the update, it makes low level events now fun and worthwhile. Level 50 supermutants at Manhunt. Level 50 ghouls at Back on the beat. 3 level 50 legendaries at Leader of the pack. It’s fucking great.
---
Its free on gamepass on Xbox One so I didn't buy it.
---
Haha bug go squish
---
I noticed this even with my legacy flamer. there's definitely something up with the sneak multiplier. it's triggering, but it's not dealing as much damage as it should.
---
I didn't get to test it much, but I'm guessing either covert operative isn't working or became an additive effect as well. which is stupid considering other multiplicative effects remain, well, multiplicative.
---
First hand accounts from people using a service that I’m asking a question about would be the next most reliable source of information.
---
You’re clearly having a bad week, I hope things get better.
---
I tried it on the PTS, it doesn't affect corpses too much. Not as much as an auto grenade launcher at least. The real reason I didn't use it in the live version is simply that it's not that useful, it only procs on a % chance and you won't often have it happen on enemies that are close enough together
---
I fought SBQ last night as well. Definitely was a magic user handling the damage. My numbers were only leaving dents. Earl is definitely going to need a full team now though. No more random nukes events on monongah :/
---
It is very weird. A level 400 that joined wasn’t even helping
---
Not yet. Ghillie and camo so far.
---
No, my logic is thus: Fallout 76 is 2 games in one. Right now, they need to focus on polishing it's build sim BEFORE integrating it into their open world rpg. 
---
Because of their "release before next quarter" devs are forced to cut corners to release new content at expense of quality. This is because theoretically new content brings in more subscriptions than fixing old content. 
---
But Bethesda has expanded past the acceptable glitches and bugs tolerance threshold for most gamers. Bethesda may be obtaining some profits in the short side, but in the long run they are losing out on even higher profits from a steady base because they are marring their franchise just to meet the expectations of 1 fiscal quarter. 
---
I understand that stocks control business finances sometimes more than the actual product itself. But that doesn't mean you can slack off on that product to make a quick buck. 
---
Look at what Toyota did to revolutionize the car industry. If it weren't for Mr. Toyoda, Toyota would never have set the high quality standard that the Toyota Corolla imposed on the entire car market. Toyota is a rich company with a loyal generational customer base. Ford and GM on the other hand, their stock's share price has been slowly declining and that is because they lost their customer base, due to their mentality of making a quick buck and cutting massive corners even in terms of safety. 
---
This is one of many examples that the product, not just perception, IS still important especially in the long term.
---
Another example is today's AMD. Once they unvealed Intel's poor pricing, AMD share price soared from $20 to $70 in a week. Intel's stock dropped considerably and were forced to make changes to their business model. 
---
Once the facade of a "perfect company" is gone, share price will plummet.
---
Good to know.  Thanks, I appreciate it!
---
There's a difference between making enemies more punishing and making them able to take more punishment.
---
Owner rewards you for being careful and playing well. The other rewards you for reasourse management.
---
I feel like all that happened to me is I need to spend more time looting and crafting.
---
Now if only traveling to White Springs was free...
---
Unfortunatelly it was not released yet. Waiting for it too since it was datamined
---
Welp time to close up shop
---
ive seen that its something with the launcher and i can launch it with via the exe. file and need to uninstall and reinstall the launcher would that work? (edit i launched fo76 thru the exe. file but it says i played on the free trial and i need to purchase it but ive owned it for over a year?)
---
NP bro, stay safe in the wasteland!
---
Thank you gentlemen.
---
Okay, slight mistype on my end - I meant to say except the final group at the end.
---
Essentially, if you have stimpacks and PA, you should be able to easily tank everything and just stay in the area for the uplinks, and not worry about spending ammo.
---
I don't think I have picked a lock or hacked a terminal that's higher than 0 in months.
---
Every build does less damage now, stealth wasn't affected. Im a bloodied stealth commando and I've only noticed about a 30% drop in damage. Sneak is still 2x or more with perks.
---
You set your PS4 in rest mode while it's downloading, right?  That often times speeds up the process.
---
I still have 3 perception in heavy gunner build... now I use glow sights.
---
Did y’all at least fix the terrible issue with the rocket sledgehammers where swinging in a rainbow motion doesn’t hit anything except for the pin that’s in the spot where your looking?  Because I’m a melee guy and it pissed me off when y’all upped the range on lvl 69 charred feral gouls to at least 3 feet from there 4 foot arm.
---
... Wat.
---
Ok, so how should I have phrased that then? It’s as basic a question as ever. You spend way too much time on Reddit, there’s not a single thing that would indicate it’s a complaint.
---
I know what you mean. Im one of the lucky players because I've got my bloodied build set, so tackling content still feels somewhat easy but have to be more considerate of things now. Unfortunately I know a lot of people that don't have optimized builds well struggle far more, especially those near the level 50 mark and bad rng luck. It's sad because in some ways I feel like the one wasteland is a good idea but without the proper consideration into balancing you only begin to see the cracks in the implementation where they overlooked things. I believe they should have put more time into the pts fine tuning it all and making sure aspects of the games loop accommodate the new change. Hopefully it only gets more balanced down the line but overall these things should have been covered in the pts.
---
Im very sorry for your loss, but also as a low level this update is the best thing to happen to me. Now i wont have to worry about being randomly mauled by level 50 charred ghouls.
---
it's Bethesda's version of that WoW pandemic.
---
Oh ok, that sounds like a good way to level up quickly.
---
Well when the scrub kids werent there with tesla rifles it was fine
---
I went from 1 shotting to 5-8 shotting, doesn’t help when their health bars keep rubber banding too
---
Stealth doesn't work at all in the Daily Ops, by design. Otherwise stealth works the same, but the damage calculation change means that the sneak damage bonus is much smaller than it used to be.
---
A lot of the time mobs would just be too high level and take too many bullets. Just was not fun at all. 
---
The first assaultron I ever had to kill I thought it was an impossible task because I only took 1/80th of its health off per shot I landed on it. I just gave up trying.  
---
My duo partner, however, was easily able to solo their assaultron because it spawned at the appropriate level. And they're terrible at FPS games... I was so confused.
---
With all due respect that is a load of shit.
---
Everyone of my Bloodied weapons damage output has been slashed by a minmum 50%
---
All of them.
---
Running with 10% health to get just 220 damage out of an explosive bloodied 50 Cal Sniper Rifle.I was getting 440 -500
---
Bloodied Gauss Rifle gone from 1000 - 500.
---
Bloodied 45 Pipe Rifle gone from 300- 150.I need 3 shots to kill a mongrel Dog.
---
Inb4 this genuinely good idea causes a dupe exploit
---
Gotta have it on to show btw
---
Haha, i'm unlocked rank 100 even before loggin into the world when servers went up yesterday (hate grinding while i'm limited in time to get rewards - in my \*and only my\* opinion - better to pay than worry about will i able to unlock all rewards if i'll decide or have to not play for couple of weeks or not). Can confirm everything in the main post. Also transparent (glass) walls are awesome - finally i can add some not ugly windows to my camp! Unfortunately - except of described things, other rewards are not too interesting, at least personally for me. Lv100 PA skin is ok\~ish... but nothing major. Consumables, like perk card packs, lunch boxes, currency - yeah, always useful.
---
Waiting for armor (end especially power armor) displays and crossing fingers for bethesda not to force us to store PA parts separately into stash while putting them on display.
---
The next reliable source to whom?
---
My guns now take 2-6 more bullets to kill, my melee build still kills in 2.
---
Dark souls is a difficult game.  Imagine if they made you repair your armor every 15 times you did a dodge roll.  There's a difference between difficult and grindy.
---
Making enemies more tanky and nerfing stealth approaches isn't making the game more difficult, it's making it more resource-intensive and more fast-paced.   As I said, this is fine, but it's different.  With a full health build, TSE, and Marsupial there's literally no reason for me to ever die if I use even 10% of my brain stem, and that hasn't changed.  But I miss the game I was playing.  I wasn't playing that game yesterday.
---
My god I wish I had your problem.
---
As for your question, always auto. DPS is king in this game and nothing even comes close, other than a better auto weapon.
---
Stealth or not stealth is a playstyle choice but stealth gets you sweet damage bonuses for little effort.
---
Unyielding is a no brainer. Around +30% XP bonus, +45 carry weight, almost being able to stealth at max ability with no stealth perk cards, among other things.
---
Will most likely be MTX
---
My teammate was spamming a tesla, then I ran around finishing off the bots with my sledge.  Wasn't difficult at all.
---
I could probably do the whole golf club before needing radaway. If I had ghoulish I could even heal from the nukezone so no more stims.
---
But yea. Even rank 1 rad sponge would mean just casually walking around a nukezone with a buddy.
---
Ill probably get list in this long thread but here goes...
---
I took a 2H melee down with my friends using heavy gunners.  As they lowered the gutsies' health to almost nothing I ran up and melee'd.  I was showing damage numbers of 300 or so several times but the gutsies didn't always die.  They would rag doll   when i hit them but they didn't always die.  Sometimes the hit wouldn't register at all.  Seems broken.
---
Wheres the data mind could someone link? Thank you
---
Yep, the 30% boost was laughable when it’s a peashooter in the first place...
---
Have you talked to the b.o.s guy in watoga?
---
Travel to watoga, find the note, talk to dude.
---
I'm up for a laugh
---
paying for swapping perks is a nono IMO tho
---
Unless I’m misunderstanding OP I think he means people being in the group and not coming to the daily ops at all, not about not turning up and not helping.
---
This was a problem for me last night too, there’s no reason to be in a daily ops group if you’re not going to join the daily ops and it takes space for other people wanting to group up. There should be another way for people to matchmake so to speak.
---
Arguably this is more casual than it was before. Damage being leveled across the board, the ability to get rid of old perks, an ability to increase your specials if you need a lil boost. To me seems like they're making it more accessible to a wider audience, I'm level 110 and can now bring my level 10 friend into my CAMP in the south without fear of him dying to a stray bloodbug
---
I play on the X and have had zero issues at all with anything. Not sure if I’m just lucky or this is the norm though.
---
I play on xbox one x and daughter plays on xbox one s. Neither of us have ever had a problem playing this game.
---
People complaining about it just seem to want to be able to one tap everything. They claim they don't do enough damage because they can't dish out thousands of damage in one hit.  The update makes a nuclear wasteland actually feel like one. Tough enemies and more challenge and I'm all for it. Definitely a game changer, and only for the better. Actually feels a bit more like a fallout game and not a "one shot ever enemy" simulator
---
You do realize you are literally doing the same  thing? Watch your build get nerfed too, and next you'll be the one crying. People worked hard for their builds, all of their armor and mods and weapons centered around it only for it to get chucked into the wind because a bunch of people like YOU whined enough for this to happen. Bethesda hasn't made an easy way to change your perk cards from one build to another without leveling up twice per card if you need to also move perk points. These hate posts of being tired of people whining about their builds are ridiculous. All you're doing is now becoming the person who whines about people whining, do you not see the irony lol? Then to rub in people's faces that you "don't die". Tell that to my Explosive Laser Rifle 😜
---
Nooo, I love lever action! Except how insanely quickly they break!
---
wasting twice as much ammo truly is fun.
---
Yea there was 8 people in the rumble I did last night....I was still the only one who hit ore...I have just come to terms radiation barrels are not in my future... put it right in my hopes and dreams with a simpack diffuser plan.
---
The source, which we have already established after years of playing that it is not reliable information. 
---
The patch notes also said at one time that they fixed the auto complete issue, which the community pointed out they had not.
---
See how that works?
---
Well... sort of. You would get more exp for killing all of them, obviously, but especially when we have an op with resilient or cloaking, it’s much safer to just not bother. If I can’t see them or I have to leave the uplink to kill them, it just isn’t worth it.
---
OK, then make it a stash box upgrade.. so it isnt a new item, but it lets you put all ammo/explosives in your stash box for 0 weight.
---
My Junkies FFR 50cal started behaving like it was magic yesterday and it never used to. It was weird, but I could watch the health bar on the assaultron boss in the daily ops just go down when I was doing it solo and regular enemies would just suddenly die while their health bars weren't even half empty. I'm wondering if the framerate issues people are having are making the magic effect worse.
---
Same for me never happened untill today
---
No one ever said they would be released. They exist in the data as of this patch now, but it could be months before we see them.
---
TBH I'm lvl 75 and I don't care about the extra XP, I'm here to see the world and the stories and then I'm probably done. At this point I already have all the perk cards I really want. Not sure why high level characters care about leveling tbh. And are they really doing more damage? I haven't noticed that. Idk, could be I'm just too good at stealth.
---
Point is they are rebalancing things cause a few builds kill too fast but instead of nerfing those builds they are buffing all enemy HP and resistance which negatively effects people without those over powered builds. It's a one fits all bandaid approach that isn't ideal. You may be fine with this sloppy approach but you don't have to get defensive on Bethesda's part, they can handle a bit of criticism don't worry.
---
Exactly, these people are either now just doing normal damage and needed to be nerfed or they're doing something really wrong with their build
---
If you run blocker and serendipity(if bloodied) your risk factor drops a lot.  Melee is still very good as far as damage is concerned, though.  Some of the strongest food and chems, some of the highest base damage.  I feel like it's in an okay spot now, with the proper considerations.
---
are you saying the unarmed damage may be fixed in the future? my commado build is still dank but my unstoppable monster is only doing 1/4th the damage it was doing before. the unarmed damage especially bummed me out because i just finishes speccing that alt out to become my new melee toon (ran bloodied melee since 3 months after release date and only recently changed my main to a stealth commando.)
---
You are one damn good player if you pulled it off with a pistol
---
Yea it doesn’t seem multiplicative, seems more like it additive now
---
Yeah, stuff like the rubber banding and vats hit bug don't help any.
---
What rads removes 6 rads per second and gives 300 rad resistance.
---
I have all my perks in automatic rifles. All I know is it's pretty much useless to me now without low level enemies. No big deal. Good to know it's buffed maybe I can get a good amount of caps for it then.
---
Ah ok I just assumed they had released it with this patch
---
Mummbles is too busy selling rolling pins and broadsiders to be any assistance. 😀
---
Add instigating snipers to the list , we got nerfed so hard a kid with a BB gun does more damage
---
I just logged on to see what's what. It felt more difficult but I am only level 47 rifles build.  All the enemies are scaled to my level and it feels like I am doing less damage.  Head shots just got more important as well as meds and food
---
I'm still bored of the game. Glad you're enjoying it tho op
---
I chose Ammo Factory, Master Infiltrator, then Agility, Perception, Endurance and Luck.
---
The real legendary perks are in the ability to equip more ordinary perks, IMO.
---
it said 11 rads. but I could see the bar taking a little bit longer to show my increased rads every now and then. I’m assuming it was the rad regenaration kicking in. 
---
bjt since I was taking lots of rads couldnt see it properly.
---
the nuke zone was at whitespring. I walked, didnt run, from the station until I reached the bungalows, killed two ghouls and walked back. 
---
so, with armor and one drug radx or radshield I guess it’s very possible to survive in the nuke zone without PA, stealth suit or radsuit.
---
Yes, thank you, exactly! As somebody who sunk hundreds of hours and multiple play-throughs of Fallout 4's survival mode, I'm all for anything that makes this game a lil tougher =)
---
Mobs give more exp, nothing changed for majority of players, only crybabies complain here, while players just play (fuck everyone who downvote in advance)
---
You’re probably right, might just be a new meta of being ab “all rounder” approach. Just quite jarring having played a particular way since beta to find you suck (me, I suck lol).
---
For neither me, nor my gf the patch is a problem.
---
My minigun still shreds, and she takes 1-2 bloody shots out of her combat rifle to drop every normal enemy. Killed a level 75\*\*\* supermutant with her account without having to reload, so I guess everything is fine.
---
We are using optimized builds tho.
---
Me too, I enjoy exploring but I'm crap at killing and now almost die walking around the forest areas.
---
That's an awful lot of words for "Those fucks who robbed me of loot by one-shotting SBQ aren't laughing now, and it's glorious". 😎
---
As a non-anything build, in standard gear, with a standard PA, using standard ammo, I'm loving it. 😁
---
i also have the option to install it on steam could i just download it on steam and play it?
---
With the damage Nerf,and enemy damage Buff,it feels like a 75%  move in favor of enemies.
---
I have played religiously since launch.Not even going to bother today.
---
I feel like this patch has totally killed  every aspect of my game.
---
I suspect many others feel the same.
---
Sure one or two are very happy.
---
In the bigger scheme of things i think this update will prove to be a game killer.
---
The update has killed the joy for end of gamers. Who earned the right to have OP builds after putting in the time and effort.
---
Give it a few weeks most events will be empty.
---
The only hard game players left will be the Modders.
---
This game shouldn't be easy for everyone, though. A casual player with crappy gear and builds shouldn't have it as easy as the hardcore players with decent builds and gear, otherwise, what's the point of grinding, trading, and refining said build and gear?
---
Y'all want this to be easy mode all the time without putting in any work.
---
Fixed it a while ago
---
Its not about the game being too hard. But for me as a camp builder.. It simply sucks that every camp is now in the cranberry bog, even if it is close to Vault76. We already have a very limited build space and now I have to fill it up with tons of defense stuff.
---
And I really hate that every opponent in every region now just feels the same. Yes! Its way easier to level up even with the nerf (LVL 271 Stealth Rifle glascannon here - hit hard concerning damage - but ok lucky draw gave me a TSE Fixer I can make it work as commando now) But the world lost atmosphere..  Although I like Patch22 in general I have agree with and quote [u/BurgerCombo](https://www.reddit.com/user/BurgerCombo/)  "it's not the game I've been playing for 2 years " or in my case not the world I loved for 2 years.
---
So it's just shit stirring and I shouldn't worry ?
---
You probably don't want to. Australians in their 30's or above would be the only people that upvoted.
---
There's like a 45% chance anything you post on Reddit gets instantly downvoted to oblivion
---
I did hear that. So I feel better but at the same time I don’t believe them. They aren’t exactly known for having their shit together. They might realize how OP it is and change their minds
---
Yes, player accounts of performance about things in a game from a company famous for their lack of quality assurance and poor community support is important. 
---
You seem like you really need this “win” today so I’m gonna go ahead and say you’re right.
---
Have a nice day!
---
Its possible it spawned at a higher level than you'd be able to handle. As I understand it, before One Wasteland, some enemies did scale but they scaled at spawn. And if there was someone higher level that caused the Assaultron to spawn, it would have been too high for you to even try to take on. If it despawned somehow and you came back through and you were the one to spawn it, it might have been a different story. 
---
With One Wasteland, now there's that calculation done so it's sort of done client side in addition to server side. On paper, this is great, but I think it's been tuned a little poorly in its current state hence all the trouble low level players are having with *all* enemies, not just traditionally high level ones.
---
Nothing says innocent question like immediately responding and getting into it with every response.  Just relax and play the game - find out for yourself if it works for you.
---
I have done that mission, didn’t get a rare reward from that either like the wiki says it should I think
---
My build got hit pretty hard, stealth included. Stealth is now additive rather than multiplicative. At westteck I would do around 1600-1700 dmg per stealth headshot. I now do around 300. Still combat effective but I now have to double to triple tap each super mutant.
---
I have rank one of the card. I believe I had to have spent coins to use it, correct?
---
then you're probably not paying attention. even my legacy flamer is taking roughly 3 to 5 times as much fuel to kill bigger game.
---
Dude, you do realize that people spent a ton of time into building their characters. Of course they're upset about being nerfed. As am I. Bloodied shotgun build, I am a level 141 and it's literally like I'm back at lvl 50, it's pretty bad. Just watch, you never know, your build might get nerfed too and you'll be just as upset.
---
I crashed and burned hard in the ops lol. Soooo many Gutsy’s
---
Very true. I really hope not though since I maxed it right away lol
---
I donno what you do man, but I am a heavy weapons build.
---
I use all 3 2h weapon perks, and the one that makes melee ignore armor.
---
I can 1-2 shot almost all normal mobs using a vampire super sledge with 40% attack speed.
---
So what is the problem that you cannot 1 or 2 shot bosses?
---
Thanks, haven’t played since early August
---
you can just use the mod that highlights flesh piles
---
Ask if your phone plan has some amount of data for hotspot. Mine had 50 gb per month and that shit is much quicker than my home internet. Like it was downloading between 10-50 mb/s at all times, closer to 25 on average.
---
I went from 1.8k to 360, what’s worse is I had just gotten to that damage
---
Thanks for your input/assessment my friend. Def helps others who might still be on the fence about paying to unlock up to the item they want. Overall I'm like you in that I'm not overwhelmed by the camp items and wearables, but I do like a majority of them. I agree that the level 100 power Armor skin isn't Earth shattering, but there's just something about it that I really like. Don't get wrong, I liked the black bubble Captain Cosmos level 100 PA skin from last season, but there was just always something about it that would make me change to another skin very soon after applying it. I really love the tropic lightning handmade skin. I've always disliked the junkyard look of the handmade but this skin I absolutely am digging. Honestly makes the handmade look like a A1 M-16 I used to carry in the Army. Plus the reflex sight with the circle co-witnesses with the front sight in FPV, and I totally dig that!
---
I'm defending it because it's good, and many other players are super happy with It and are enjoying it. And if you don't plan on playing long anyways as you say, it really doesn't matter to you. People want to stack levels so they can respec if they want, which is pretty obvious.
---
Lol what? Just don't scrap the cards that you plan on using.
---
Might have been the server , we killed a few Queens yesterday and they popped for sure. Only reason we killed her
---
Just keep adrenal, the lost healthpoints are so low...\^\^
---
GDI
---
At events, I feel like all I see is energy weapons anyway! Is that what Bethesda wants of me?!
---
Until perk loudouts on console, this is my favorite legendary perk since I already waste a lot of time swapping cards when crafting/selling
---
TTK is a tiny bit slower for regular enemies on my main, I did two SBQ and I didn’t notice a difference.
---
On my new character it’s a lot harder though, enemies hit hard. Taking the Morgantown workshop was a tough fight. Really gotta up your equipment game.
---
&gt;I should be able to stop on that garbage.
---
lol, I agree. We could stomp roaches in Fallout 4 if we used Melee in VATS and if we were in PA.
---
*Not sure if you are serious.* I started messing around with the legendary perks last night and here is what occurred.
---
* I am now doing 40% more damage on each target in sneak (max Follow Through).
---
* I added an additional special point to luck which allowed me to max out Serendipity.
---
* I put another special point in perception to gain 10% energy resistance.
---
I am not even done yet!
---
Normally it shouldn't work because the fire rate doesn't get high enough to hit the 'magic' number, at least according to Angry Turtles video. But since it's tied to server lag, it makes sense that it would sometimes happen on those weapons that are just on the cusp.
---
I haven't noticed a sneak nerf except in the OPs. Although I definitely feel you. A few days ago I finally got around to doing some possum scouts quests like using specific weapons. I mostly stuck to the forest but it was a fun change of pace to use a guitar sword or flamethrower that I would never be able to use against lvl 50+ enemies. Sucks for people who aren't going to realistically do those quests now.
---
Oh ok, cool. Well I def appreciate you sharing that Knowledge with me. You da man 👍🏼
---
Whoops.  Misread - sorry!
---
There are a lot of console players
---
Yep, same with me. I went melee and my partner was commando. There was times I was hitting enemies and doing damage numbers but it wasn’t finishing them.
---
How about an item that when you use it gives you a +2 Strength buff for 30 mins?
---
Funny thing is, game is still super easy lmao
---
Edit: whoever downvoted me, thanks:) and also thanks for probably assuming I only play super meta bloodied. Sure I do have a bloodied toon but I also mainly play a lazy food build that doesn’t indulge in legendary gear and he’s surviving just fine out there in the wastes. Quick tips for people having trouble, aim for the head, be strategic and tactical, use food buffs, take advantage of PA from time to time, if you’re getting mobbed take cover, crouch, move, jump, anything. This game is easy if you have any common knowledge about these enemies and know how to work around them in any situation. I feel like the people crying about the game being too hard or enemies being too spongey just don’t even like fallout and this game is not for you then. This isn’t the The Sims camp builder 76 it’s fucking fallout you have to kill shit and be creative just like you did in every other fallout. Stop complaining about hard combat in a game that’s about fucking combat!!! I’m sorry but that’s what fallout is, it’s not about building and collecting stuffed animals that’s all just extra bonus stuff that I like too but i like popping heads even more that’s why I play the game. That’s the end of my rant, if anyone has any questions or seeking advice on how to survive better shoot me a message I’ll be glad to help I love this game and this patch is amazing I’m glad things are a bit more challenging now everything is completely doable and still fun without being ultra meta builds, just please people stop complaining about normal things just because you aren’t good at shooters I’m sorry but this isnt the sims
---
Hmm, gonna have to do more Queens to be sure then.
---
Well, think about it - if the enemies scales to player level, that means they’d be doing much more damage to the pipes at tea time and npcs would flounder and die extremely easily, right? So how would they avoid doing that?
---
Simple - by keeping a ‘natural’ spawn that only players are scaled against. However, based on my testing above, the damage resistance of enemies is unchanged, so to me, it seems possible that the damage they deal is also unchanged with the shifting of levels. The easiest way to test (which I can’t, mostly due to time constraints) would be to get a level 5 and a level 100+ being attacked by the same forest (or other region) super mutant with no armor/perks and recording how much damage it does. If it’s the same, then it likely isn’t scaling.
---
Yep. It's like Bethesda listened to my complaints and did the exact fucking opposite. It's even more difficult now than it was before, and that's saying something! Unless you're a hard core player I honestly don't think you're going to get much out of the game any more.
---
Thats what happened to me i was at 1.4k now I’m at 470
---
You don't need to take down enemy from 100% to 0% with bashing/melee. Shoot it to 1% and then bash it once with your gun.
---
oh, im sorry then
---
I’m loving it, so much QOL improvement. Only did op once and didn’t like the melee-kill-only robot idea, it doesn’t make any sense. Make them level 150 I don’t mind, but telling me my machete does better job than my gatling gun is totally immersion breaking.
---
I didn’t even voice an opinion about anything I literally asked a simple yes or no question and then if there was anything else from the new patch. Only one guy has even answered that question. 
---
I’m not following you at all here
---
They sure do.
---
The stealth thing is fucking ridiculous, Bethesda devs have a hard on for PA heavy gunners and it shows.
---
Well I am a firm believer of "everyone is entitled to their opinion".... Even if it sucks balls. Have a great day in the wasteland!
---
Am I the only one that is noticed if you die during an event you don't lose your junk?
---
I think you're confusing my logic here. Yes, technically, it will be easier for them in areas that were considered high level areas in the past. But those tough enemies will still be stronger than their standard enemies, even though they will be scaled down to them. If they are having problems with the enemies that weren't given them problems in the past, what makes you think the tougher enemies scaled down to them will be any easier than the normal ones? It doesn't matter how much easier the higher stuff is now if the normal level stuff is causing roadblocks with the current tuning.
---
I took my perks off for one second and learned that they now give me a total of +15 more damage
---
I also agree no more solos it will take everyone working together. Earle was already a freaking rank. I think I might of hit almost 100 with my bloodied fixer
---
Definitely feels like 70%
---
Weaken using guns; defeat using melee. Seems obvious, no?
---
Everything is a freakin sponge now, you did well for a bit but it isn't fun anymore. Later bethesda.
---
Having played both, I highly recommend going back to heavys. I love them
---
Hey, I’ve been trying to do some camp renovations and it appears the merge trick no longer works for me, is there a limitation on what can be merged with what?
---
I was really unsure and concerned up until it actually released, I’m loving how quick you can gain xp
---
I understand that part. I had trouble getting bash to work with them at 1hp
---
ultimitaly it wont matter to me in months no, but hey just having a convo on reddit about a game I generally like. Sad to see it change like this but I'll live.
---
I know plenty of people like the changes, there is also plenty of people who don't. Don't take it personally.
---
Exactly. Casuals bitch about meta, meta gets nerfed, we create a new meta and the casuals bitch about it again because *~HigH LevEl pLayErs sHoulDn't bE aBle to dO tHat mUcH damAgE~*. What's the point of grinding for gear and refining our builds if Bethesda is going to spit on our hard work? What's the point of even trying to have a semi decent build if casuals are going to bitch and complain until it gets nerfed?
---
Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy some aspects of this update. But Bethesda doesn't seem to care about its OG player base at all.
---
I use a deathclaw and it's gimped. The 1 sneak hit is now 4 or 5 plus they notice me way easier now. 
---
It's making me redo my character and who the f likes that at level 200.
---
Everyone is missing my point of the post. I never said I could not inflict damage with my melee... I am speaking about the damage taken vs damage output with this update.
---
Ya getting more XP is awesome Bc I don’t have to go to my usual farm spot
---
are you sure another person in your team has mutations? I’ve actually had some unmutated people in my public team yesterday.
---
This is what we did...4 man team I was devoted melee.  Worked ok.  Buddy spammed stims with team medic on.  Melee hits are sketchy.   At least they were for me.  Either failing to connect or showing 300 damage to a 1% health gutsy without killing him.  
---
We did under 8 minutes twice out of 3 tries.   Only killed what we had to and tanked the rest.  Can't say I loved it but ill do it for rewards
---
Yeah it works well if you’ve got some people shooting to get them low then other people using melee to take them out.
---
🤷‍♂️ if it happens to me. It happens. I won't publicly bitch and whine about it. It's  Bethesda's choice. They've only changed the damage right now to then improve and perfect the damage system.
---
 They said other things too, and that is all I can remember. I can understand you're sad but like, do we need to see every post on this sub about it? No. We don't.
---
Its been that way for a while now but it's definitely nice
---
Would be cool if we could have our own little housing units underground in Foundation or the Crater.
---
One wasteland is fine for people with decent builds but a nightmare for people who have inefficient builds on higher levelled characters.
---
It’s not a problem. If I ever see you around, you’re entitled to 3 stimpack diffusers.
---
Op had spare funds from a gift card sitting in their microsoft account. Dont be jealous that someone else had a couple hundred bucks to spare.
---
Damnnnn ok cool thanks for the information, this is the first perk I'm maxing out lol
---
Haha well there's always a silver lining in everything, just got search hard enough to find it 😂. I appreciate the kind words, and honestly I would much rather be at work not dealing with this, but you play the cards your dealt and push forward👍🏼
---
Regarding yer second edit:
---
I always pick up gunpower in containers/mobs as I find it dramatically cuts down my need to find acid.  
---
Also because I explore enough I often pick up enough lead in my day to day that I rarely have to go to the luckey hole
---
Not related to the exact same issue, but my long time, time consuming Raider camp is right in the blast zone of the new event where everyone is nuking the mine :(
---
 Yes mine took a big hit. I miss my big numbers. Went from 1600 dmg to 300 dmg on a stealth headshot. Doesn't really effect my combat effectiveness as I just double tap things rather than single shot. However, multiple 300 dmg shots just doesn't feel the same as 1600 dmg for my ego.
---
That's an even bigger waste
---
Were you trying to do it in vats? Bash doesn't work with it. Also, if you have multiple enemies meleeing you you get interrupted / knocked back. Don't let them swarm you.
---
Heavy gunner got a little punch in the arm rather than getting king hit in the nuts.
---
and bobble heads and magazines. It was very noticeable doing extra 25% damage with unarmed after popping a bobblehead
---
PA users have been getting shafted on perks, it's about time we got something.
---
My TSE Lever is better than before
---
Its a new reward from season 2, you get it really early on.  Just do a few score challenges.
---
Damn dude that sucks. I guess i got lucky in only getting a tesla user a quarter of the time. Sometimes i got lucky and had someone with an explosive one and id stand in front of them so they down themselves with the damage. It didnt work everytime though i guess some people have the sense to use fireproof
---
This post really feels like a not so humble humblebrag.
---
You’re being obtuse and condescending because you clearly don’t get it.. Got it.
---
Not a bad idea, but it's also worth noting that Season 2 rewards offer: 
---
* one Perk Card Pack (#4 cards) at rank 15, 26, 35, 45, 55 and 65
---
* two packs (#8 cards) at rank 75 and 85
---
* three packs (#12 cards) at rank 95
---
That's a total of 52 cards for the season (or 104 points). It's not so generous as to rule out daily rewards, but I expect some players will get more cards from ranks than from leveling over the season.
---
Yep. Can confirm that worked well in the one run I had time to do last night.
---
Reads my comment, first thing that pops in his head is "sucking balls". Have a great day too buddy 👍
---
I noticed a bug since the last update that my new character which I created in the release day has all stats (special) are reduced by 2
---
Sure, I get that. But as I said to another user here why continue to shoot when they are down instead of helping me? I don't particularly want to be the only one using melee when that's the mutation modifier for today. The guy in PA at the back continuing to shoot instead of switching to melee is as much use to me as wooden armor in a rad zone.
---
That would be my guess too.
---
Stealth rifleman are useless now , the commandos keep saying they are fine but they also run full auto with a stealth build so.....
---
No hot-swap.  Go to a Red Rocket and change your loadout.  Remove your armor and all but one of your rifles, strip down to the food and chems you will actually need.  It might sound like a PITA but you will find that it actually keeps you honest about what you actually need on your person and what you are just pointlessly hoarding because it weighs less on you than it does in stash.  If there's something you keep loading and unloading, without using it... sell that shit.
---
I run a similar [non-sneak bloodied commando](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5d449ab&amp;d=p00s01pp2ir2ib2a30lt2lu2la2l71eu0sg1eh2a04pg2ph2pi2s12c72a71a41&amp;m=051c249f8a&amp;nw=p1p7pci2aal3l4). This doesn't reflect the 2 extra points I have in AGI, LCK, or CHR with the legendary perks.
---
I'm able to solo the DO in under 10 (9min 20sec), but I haven't beat the 8 minute mark yet.
---
I just swapped out my old uny/sent BOS pieces for SS, and I haven't gotten any sentinal pieces yet, so I'm still squishy to gutsy AP. 
---
Use cover to heal. Stand inside doorways to avoid shots, and funnel mobs to be easily bashable.
---
Weird I tried yesterday and it didn't work so I gave up lol.
---
Do you have strange in numbers? If not someone may have been sharing it with you before
---
That quest is supposed to be cut content.. ~~They apparently have activated it.~~ Need to go check it out :) [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Magnum\_Opus](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Magnum_Opus)
---
EDIT:  Vincent May-Lilly is there for me, but doesn't react to me in anyway. Not starting a quest.
---
ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!! Honestly was worth the Atoms to unlock everything, for it alone. I was worried it was going to have the floating issues the Chinese bunker that came out couple of weeks ago had, but it's shockingly flawless compared to what Bethesda usually releases. It has an optional 3 power hookup that releases fog around the door consistently. It's worth the grind no doubt. I'll be posting my review of it here shortly.
---
Great input- and I'm sure I will adapt and inevitably keep playing.  I'm just going to miss the slower, lonelier Appalachia.
---
Yeah, it is very good, and the rad resist is the cherry on the top.
---
can you swap out the tame perk once you've tamed an animal and sent it home?
---
I'm pretty cool with it. I like legendary perks, daily ops is fun, one wasteland gives me more xp, and honestly didn't notice the damage nerf much.
---
I am running into some odd bugs that may be server lag. I did breach and clear yesterday and every container was empty. I've had a few mobs that I killed that should have had loot also with nothing.
---
Haha well played sir.... Well played👍🏼👍🏼
---
Do you have Strange in Numbers on?
---
Level 390 junkies pa heavy. Also loving it. Have ot at r3 currently it's pretty amazing. Though I was going to get some rads to trigger my uny for speech checks and was like oh f*ck.did need it anyway haha
---
Guys is this true? I mean, anyone else test it? I have many display cases in my base and vending machine, should i remove everything?
---
Guns to get them to low health, then melee to finish off
---
AND WE'LL ALL STAY FREEEEEEE
---
I didn't want to drop them either, but I eventually got fed up, dropped the notes/tapes and server hopped. Like ripping a bandaid. Could probably get someone to hold them for you to make sure it helps before committing.   Switching views and using hud instead of pipboy might alleviate the lag some.
---
Cheers 🍻😁
---
I get what you’re saying. I don’t mind the premise of finishing them off with bash but I find that it takes 2-3 attempts before I connect. By the time you hit the button and the bash animation happens the enemy has moved. The only thing that works for me is to fire from a distance then charge using sprint then bash. For some reason when I go toe-to-toe that’s when I seem to not be able to connect.
---
Oh no.
---
Im gonna be real with you for a second. Get a magic heavy and ride it till the wheels fall off.
---
No they didn’t. My sneak attack build works fine. Even in daily ops I can do it with a team. 
---
People are straight up lying about the game on this sub. It’s bizarre.
---
Yes. I CLEARLY don't get it. That's it. Thanks.
---
Yea I had a nice 3* bloodied pipe wrench I used for this. I still can but it’s not as fun as before. That’s the one thing i don’t like about the update is you gotta use ur best stuff most of the time now. I feel really bad for the archers or rifle builds. But we all will adjust and figure out how to make it work. I have faith in the community.
---
Melee needs to be one hit though. You die very fast if you can’t one hit as a melee. I shouldn’t be doing 200 damage with a weapon that usually does 500 damage as melee. Maybe I shouldn’t be able to one hit deathclaws with melee but most enemies I should be able to
---
Don't let it ruin the game for you. I want to build a new one myself but haven't got it in me to tear down my current one so I sorta know the feeling. You'll get a good idea eventually, just gotta let it come to you.
---
I might actually try this, thank you !
---
It’s different every day . You most likely won’t have to melee it today
---
Please post pictures when you do! I am most excited about this one! So many possibilities...
---
Rare drop tho. You have to get a good time on the event and roll well.
---
Why are you so salty?  If you dont like my idea, thats cool but you dont need to be rude.
---
I also have FO1st but I have tons of ammo -- so much, in fact, I had to mule it over on a new character.
---
Yes, so bad that I think I need a new build now, and at level 200 fuck that. I'll just quit the game. Took me a lot of levels to get my shit and now it's all fucked up. Still freaking bugs from day one and glitches with quests but yes gimp it all to hell because that's so much fun using so much more ammo now.
---
My bloodied/as/+1s is now doing 1k less damage then before the patch.
---
It does
---
I’m considering taking a break as I don’t want to burn through resources while Bethesda figures shit out. I have been playing one character since beta.
---
'Good bye, you won't be missed' part 1 and part 2
---
Guess i need to find a reliable team. Neat
---
Is it possible to toggle the perk on or off?  
---
Like, if I want to go back to bloodied at some point, am I condemned to have my rads heal up, for all my characters?
---
Shouldve kept the forest low level
---
Yeah putting something on a rug then sliding where the destroyed object was and rebuilding it. Might have to look up some others.
---
Yeah I noticed that when I tried the OP. My stealth build isn't going cut it for those. It'll take me a while to build up perks to counter the Ops so I'm probably going to be ignoring those for the foreseeable future.
---
Thanks for clearing that up for me and you are absolutely right about the whining. And must say I really like the changes . Will put my stuff back up again. Wish you a GREAT day.
---
You for one is what you’re saying?
---
Played a few Ops, and completed them okay. But got nothing but floater grenades and a few trash legendaries.
---
Not really worth it, imo.
---
I don't use PA, and run &lt;20% health and no sentinal/cavalier pieces. I don't have any problem soloing it.
---
This was a very calm, with no whine response to this patch. The folks who are going to respond with “crying” and “whiner” are people who haven’t had their build severely nerfed at all or in awhile.  I understand where Bethesda is coming from, so many builds were bemoaning the rare one shot A hole at events taking all the kills. However, they should have balanced all builds as now TSE and Tesla rifles have unfair advantage
---
Guess this is an oppurtunity to try and make friends.
---
Good call, almost panicked when I logged in and it wasn't in my stash, thought I dropped it, then remembered this post. Was just further down the list
---
Yep im at 36% and can only download at night. So ill be on at friday for the first time!
---
33 VATS Chance
---
Bash Damage
---
*Maybe* Limb Damage
---
Any of these will make the shotgun "magic"
---
Alternatively, get a Fancy Pump Action Shotgun. Also considered magic.
---
You could have read those patch notes in the time it's taken you to have this pointless argument.
---
For me, once I encountered an out of place high level mob like that, and knew how the system worked, I just relogged into a different server and that fixed it. 
---
I also had Fallout 1st for a bit, and having my own private world *definitely* fixed most of that for me, so that's why I didn't run into this problem often. Either way, as long as things were my level, I was still able to use guns just fine. If you kept running into these higher level spawned enemies though, I can see how that might have hurt. 
---
My duo partner and I ran into a legendary mob much sooner than we had any right to fight it, but had an advantage in terrain and just unloaded *all* of our ammo into it to kill it. Was it worth it in the end? No, lol. We barely got any reward worth the massive amount of ammo we wasted.
---
I’m not disputing that bloodied was OP and nowhere in my post did I say that. I’m stating that a 20% health melee build is unviable. 
---
Bloodied took a 75% damage hit. I’m not bloodied on my main but one of my older characters I don’t use anymore IS and I saw numbers drop significantly. 
---
The original poster though didn’t mention bloodied, either, and I can also verify through other full health characters that melee took a larger damage reduction hit than other weapon types. 
---
Yes, enemies got stronger, that isn’t the point of his post. Or mine. If Bethesda wanted to balance the game, that’s fine, but to essentially do so in a way that makes the only viable builds either commando or PA/heavy gunner really limits the scope of everyone. 
---
And it wasn’t just melee builds. Entire groups that were just getting by - those using pistols or non auto rifles or archers or any of the other wide diversity that was - as of two days ago - an option, just aren’t viable anymore. 
---
Hate on bloodied all you want, IDGAF. My main is a commando build and is doing fine. But I feel for those who now have no option but to completely re-spec their entire character because they wanted to be an archer, or a sniper, or whatever.
---
Would also be a nice incentive to use PA more
---
Bethesda needs to apologize, not you :P
---
Is that true? I thought it was a fluke when I went to Foundation yesterday. If so, that was a kind gesture from the cap economy devs.
---
Neat
---
Ok so the only thing I have done with the greenhouse set so far, is implement the different pieces into my main camp structure. It's sick having glass roof in portions of my camp, just sets it off. I will put it together like a "typical" greenhouse at some point today, and add my thoughts on it in my review section in the OP
---
One magic shotgun in VATS and I'm just fine.  The only 'build' I marginally have is just using some perk cards that build up some damage resistance and SS armor.
---
Game is still very playable without going the whole meta build route.
---
But if they ever fix magic guns, I'm quitting.... ;)
---
I don’t think we’ll be seeing that of the next big story until next year. Regardless infiltrator at least to me is a great alternative and if you do e d up leveling it up you can just instant unlock doors and terminals.
---
I like the extra exp, and the slug buster melts everything so I'm good &gt;:)
---
That's what I thought the theory was, but if you have a look in your inventory each time you tap a node I think you'll find it's only one ore for each button press and you don't always get four presses when wearing the PA. I'll have to try it a few more times but I have a hunch the "Excavator trick" isn't actually a thing.
---
I also cleared my stash. I think it's a memory issue. I usually had a couple minutes before the problem started, but once it did it wouldn't go away.
---
👍🏼
---
I thought he was funny.
---
One liberator actually thought out his build, the other...
---
I have 13 hours left, don't feel bad just find something to do! Unlike me who is pacing back and fourth checking time every ten minutes.
---
I feel the opposite, the game was so easy that I didn’t enjoy it at all and I pretty much didn’t play the whole summer . This brought be back and the daily ops are a dream come true
---
For 1 coin you can unequip the perk.
---
Edit: Also, the number of perks all your characters have is based on your highest one, but actual perk ranks and selected perks are tied to characters.
---
It's nowhere near unbeatable, and the ops are not that bad lol
---
Me too, I went from a "practical, modular" building to a full on Happy Thoughts Gulag. Couldn't be happier with my rebuilding.
---
They needed to replace their blasters, even after they got buffed
---
Haha are you high? Bethesda loves no one, I'm just a sucker for cosmetic and camp items.
---
When we did it and got a good time. One guy was melee and rest guns. We all shot everything and moved on. The tanky melee guy did clean up duty. This is my advice playing the event only 2x
---
Because we can get them to 1hp and then use the butt of our weapons to kill them
---
Agreed. Ive been buying every plan in the game just so I dont hit cap limit from my vendors. I like collecting plans so it doesnt entirely bother me but I really dont need or want like, every mod for Raider PA...
---
you should tell Bethesda your ideas. all we can do is just have an opinion about them.
---
I was bloodied with no power armor but had some dmg resist perks on. More importantly though like I said I did this solo, no team so I didn't have 3 other people helping me like you did.
---
I was just using it this morning with no issues. I’m on Ps4
---
The only thing I dislike are the legendary armor perks that require a matching set. It's like Bethesda doesn't realize how tedious it is to get a matching set with the right base effect, much less how it's nearly impossible to get the exact effects you want.
---
And then you just get crap loot for killing a level 50+ enemies
---
If I’m not mistaken you can swap out the perk card with another at any time. So that would turn it off per say. Just be careful putting ranks into it since it’s 50 coins each time and you can’t get those back.
---
Yep. This morning, I retired my Chinese Officer sword. It was a sad feeling indeed. I can no longer use it to save ammo.
---
Turn all crits into a confetti animation like Bloody mess proc and 2/4/6/8% to get bubblegum into your inventory
---
Commandos made out way better then riflemen, being a riflemen is pointless as of the update.
---
The last thing this game needed was easier fast travel.
---
Daily op was fun, and I enjoyed it. Solo it is very easy to get done, with a decent team it's also not too hard. People just really like to complain
---
The enemies feel more
---
Like fallout 3 now that damage has been slashed , the AI gets to randomise more behaviour the longer it exists / per enemy/ i think is made it more alive and makes u have to play against it in a way that was lacking
---
I thought I would visit the forest last night, lvl 213. I was unceremoniously taken out by a level 50 mole rat! 😂
---
Loot always sucks, it always has.  If its not legendary all you get is some ammo, maybe a few caps, and possible something to fix your gear with.  That's all maintenance, not fun loot.    
---
The xp bonus reward is minimal, and it takes a longer time to kill things, so it's probably not as big of a reward for time spent as you might imagine.
---
I'm all for everything but the enemy scaling. I think it's bs every where I go now I have max levels. What fun is roaming in the "quiet" forest anymore. All just became worse of a grind than it was before.
---
As someone just starting out their build it’s a nightmare. I used to be able to kill enemy’s with a couple of bullets, now it’s anywhere from 30-50 bullets(even with gun perks +10% damages). I’m sure once I spec everything out and get it good I’ll be fine but I don’t like that dogs are now leveled with me, those should be the critters and remain at cap of 5.
---
Personally I've already maxxed 6 perks on my main and taken Funky Duds and Taking one for the team (I hate stingwings and I like being able to contribute to the public events - am usually in PA for SBQ, ACP etc. anyway) and 4 x Legendary SPECIAL (increasing STR, PER, AGL &amp; LCK). The extra 20 special this has added has given me a true 'all in wonder' build and I am very, very satisifed. I've got all the perks I want, and would previously need to switch between. Was able to switch to armored backpack as I can easily run Thru Hiker, Good with Salt and Travelling Pharmacy without compromising on my other perks. Its not for everyone, but this allows my 'main' character to do everything very effectively and I am no struggling at all. We greased the SBQ in 3 mins, Earl in 5 and Imposter in 34 seconds last night - no issues at all with the damage 'balancing' and the higher level enemies are great and were much needed. I will note that my 'PA Heavy Gunner' loves the three PA centric perks and its a fun difference with those on. I did take Ammo Factory and maxxed it out, but on another character I don't often play on, so no issue with using up all available points on that one. Have transferred over flux, steel, acid, lead and cloth to that character and now it can happily make the rounds for my other ones, freeing up more 'quality' legendary perk points for general play. I seriously considered taking all 6 legendary perks as the 'SPECIAL' ones however did want to make a few tweaks, and being poison immune in my PA is so, so good!
---
There's actually a threat of losing events now. We almost lost Tea Time despite having 3 level 250+ PA heavies there lol
---
Though I will definitely miss just decimating low level mobs for sure
---
What is the point of making the corpses explode anyway
---
As a walking nuclear armored battle tank, I agree.
---
Once there was a vendor issue and vendors got taken down then they returned and then there was a vendor bug where those who had glitched camp budgets and under specific circumstances could have stuff stolen. There was proof of both of these.
---
Since then however it seems every update within a day the rumour mill starts and you see a post or 2 claiming a vendor/display bug allows people to access your stash and take stuff and then all we hear for a while is posts like these "a friend said"
---
Time passes and the mentions of the bug fade away and there wasn't any proof ever provided... 
---
Then the next update hits and we repeat this stupid cycle.
---
Is it possible there is a exploit or bug sure, but until someone drops some proof I doubt it.
---
Im just happy we got a work around for lockpick/hacker
---
Poppa Woody says “ dump those legendaries on someone and make them your bitch “
---
My friend maxed out ammo factory asap and can craft like 900 rounds of ultracite 5mm per batch for his gatling gun - not including super duper. It's absolutely fantastic and he basically switched over to ultracite exclusively.
---
He had had a couple fluxes on him and turned it into like 5k rounds.
---
Incorrect. Proximity has no bearing. 
---
The most likely cause is whether or not Strange in Numbers was also active for that player, either inherently or shared.
---
I’m happy with it. I like it. It’s made the game more exciting on random encounters and events. I was getting bored to be honest.
---
My only thing is the Colossal event is very hard. As bloodied but not fully optimized, my DPS on Earle drooped to 1/4 of what it was before. I’ve returned to Wendigo mop up support after a month of grinding out better gear. But it’s cool. End boss I guess should remain as such. I just worry I won’t be able to complete the event often until I’m with players better set up than I.
---
Pain train kinda does it.
---
God that’s disappointing to hear. I thought the point of the update was to discourage crazy builds and to encourage balanced builds. I’m 0% interested in playing a game where you have to min/max to even survive. I already work with Excel spreadsheets on my day job.
---
I don't but in case I scrap by mistake I have way too many banked levels lol.
---
Forgot about that effect, I wonder if I still have my Vampiric gatling laser in my stash.
---
I hadn't used that one personally so I didn't test it... it should still work like before unless they changed something about one of the objects. What were you trying to do it with out of curiosity?
---
Yeah it says right there Bethesda.net...Elder scrolls Online.............
---
My 2\* AA Gauss shotgun (limb damage)  with 5\* Explosive card and a few shotgun perks does really nice damage per shot, well over 600 I believe, and I'm not even a max shotgun build.  It looks like explosive weapons whether they are AAE, JE, BE are doing nice damage even after nerf.  Angry Turtle had a video recently on explosive weapons after changes.  If you take that same damage number and then start adding 5\* adrenaline for mobs... :)
---
There were a LOT of positive changes that are being ignored. But such is life.
---
Rule 10, head to r. /m. A. R. K. E. T. 7.6 but without the periods
---
Now I can travel anywhere and graduating from the forest is just meaningless. Hitting low level mobs just kind of made sense.
---
I shouldn't have to use 3-5 rounds to hit trash mobs.
---
I get that, I know about the rubber banding issue. I’m talking about one shot in VATS reduces targets health to less than 15%, waited a few seconds,  shot again not in VATS, target health goes straight up to 95%. Two separate actions with seconds (maybe 10 seconds,  was testing) in between.
---
It’s a .... rare reward
---
My successful elder run really only called for teamwork in and splitting up relay style. One activates, three go to to signal boost. 
---
 Then when the guy that activated gets there its 4x. Getting close to the end of boosting 2 split for the next one to get it ready.. You really only need to fire your weapon at the end.
---
But you'll lose all that sweet ammo from the bots though
---
I’m not a hardcore player but I’ve been around since public launch day. My top character is level 250 and my other two are around 115, so I have some hours in the game.
---
I have to admit I was a bit concerned, reading all the comments, news, opinions and bug reports. I finally had a chance to get on last night around 10 pm with my wife and a couple friends and get a feel for the changes. 
---
I am a low health (35-40%) junkies build. I run unyielding armor with a mix of sentinels and cavaliers. My main gun is a prime full auto JE25 HM and my backup is a prime full auto J2525 Fixer. 
---
My wife’s current character decided to try “bloodied light” (running around 40%) about a month ago so I lent her some equipment and she runs UNY/Cav with a BSS DCG (she is primarily melee) and her backup is a B2525 fixer. 
---
Based on what I saw on one of my secondary characters and read here, I was most worried for her since both bloodied and melee got nerfed pretty bad. Damage dropped 75% for bloodied melee while enemies in every region got harder. My commando build suffered much less; I estimate damage dropped around 25%.
---
My initial thoughts for my own gameplay is that, frankly, it’s kind of cool having a bit of a challenge again in the bog. Top enemies have moved up to level 100 and actually take more than a couple shots to kill. A swarm of scorched at a fissure site, defending a scorchbeast... that was fun again, and took a bit of time and actually a few stimpacks. What used to be one shot kills were now taking whole clips. As far as my build goes, I feel the difference but it isn’t a game ender for me. I don’t have to completely respec my character and I’m thankful for that. 
---
I know a lot of people put serious time and effort into building out efficient killing machines and their builds - but more importantly, the characters and the stories and memories and everything associated with those builds - essentially became obsolete overnight. And that sucks. And yes, people can re-spec and try something new and can adapt. But I understand the heartbreak of having what you’ve worked so hard for and that you’re so proud of just... destroyed... overnight. And it’s doubly frustrating to have half the community seemingly relish in your destruction. 
---
I watched my wife play, and around the ash heap, forest and savage divide, things were pretty much business as usual. The damage that she still puts out (around 330 currently with a level 50 FSS DCG) is more than enough to one hit or two hit most creatures. Higher level Sups and swarms of creatures gave her some issues but for how she normally plays (rather casual), this won’t affect her all that much. 
---
Then we decided to do daily ops. 😂 
---
First off let me say that understanding the Op is essential in the success of the mission. Every robot needs to die with melee so you have to deal with it. For me that meant bashing, but also half our team was running melee and half was commando so working together meant our first run-through was completed in 10:58. 
---
Secondly my decision a couple months ago to build a backup set of troubleshooters armor now seems in retrospect like a brilliant decision. I’ll probably be assembling a set of mutant slayers next, and assassins (presuming that effect now applies to NPCs the same way the weapons effects do). I did not die once at 30% health and used two stims for the entire event. 
---
Third, I watched my wife die over and over. And over again. It was actually kind of comical. But, robots that would have been one-hit kills two days ago were taking two or three hits to take down, and once she was swarmed, she would die. I can’t imagine what someone at 20% health would be dealing with. Probably more dying. 
---
Finally, the event was a blast. It was a healthy challenge, the fact that you could finish the event and then go back to collect your ammo and loot the bodies, the fact that rewards were put directly into your inventory instead of being things you needed to loot.. I feel Bethesda did a great job building a fun event. Kudos to the team for this one. 
---
If there’s a downside to any of this for me personally (I understand there’s a huge downside for a lot of you), I would say that frankly I enjoyed having an easy go of things in certain areas. It was nice to go to flatwoods and just wander around picking up some resources and not worrying that the ag center was suddenly going to spawn a swarm of level 50 Mr Handys. Like, don’t get me wrong, I think the fact that events like Leader of the Pack are now somewhat challenging? sort of? is cool, but really there’s no place you can just go and BE. *Everything* is trying to kill you now, and for those who had a camp in the forest because they wanted a place to go and just relax during gameplay.... well... that’s gone now. Any stray pack of ferals wandering by aren’t level 3 anymore. They’re level 50, and they’ll kill you while you try to put things in your vending machines. 
---
Conversely, I’m really going to miss starting a new character and truly feeling scared entering the cranberry bog for the first time because you legitimately were going to die if ANYTHING spotted you. Like... that is GONE now. And that sucks. 
---
In talking to a few other friends, it sounds like Tank builds are doing ok. Power Armor/heavy gunners seem fine. Full health full auto is a safe way to go. It also sounds, second-hand, that Bethesda didn’t mean to bonk Melee as much as they did (it seems bonked straight across the board, not just for bloodied) and so maybe there will be a correction to that in the future. Someday. Who knows. 
---
I still have mixed feelings about all of the changes. I was never a hater of massive bloodied builds that could stack up to 25000 DPS or whatever. I’m grateful my main character is still a viable build. I’m sad I will essentially have to retire one of my other characters (bloodied low health melee). And I’m bummed for my wife, who no matter which character she plays, she runs melee. 
---
If there’s anything I do know for certain, though, it’s that first, people will find a way to build meta characters within the given parameters, and second, Bethesda will keep changing things. I don’t think that things needed to be nerfed nearly as much as they were, but I’m looking forward to what everyone comes up with to stretch the boundaries of the new rules and maximize their damage numbers. 
---
Say what you will, at least this isn’t boring.
---
I’ve noticed they detect you way easier now which is BS. How’d that get involved with a damage nerf?
---
I think lead is always a sparse commodity. I don't think anyone with a ballistic weapon isn't in need of lead all the time. That's why it's so hard to find the stuff lying around. Screws also seem to be on the endangered list. Adhesive you can farm once you get to a good spot with your CAMP.
---
I wish I had better news I suppose. If you're on PC, come find me (DiscoLando) and I can use my perks to repair your gear to 200% at least, so it lasts a little longer. Good luck in the wastes.
---
Is it definitely intentional then? Where did you hear from?
---
I can we why they stopped unyielding charisma from doing this as it was far too easy to share rank 5 perks, but if I've invested all those perk points for 5 charisma, it should act like real charisma?
---
Yeah, I understand *why* it’s done that way, but it does take away one of the key benefits from Charisma - it is intentional. So yeah, best bet is to just move perk points and then take a different legendary effect.
---
Hmm. Maybe you could have expected that attacking content meant for four people with mixed roles might be tougher when you do it on a min-maxed build where your primary damage avoidance tactic is removed.
---
Try it in a mixed group of fighting styles. It’s a lot of fun then. 
---
Or would you rather go back to one shotting everything and decrying the lack of challenge and endgame content?
---
&gt;and then I tickled him with my super sledge.
---
You didn't hear this from me, but if you want to level up a low level character without an insane ammo grind *I'VE HEARD* you can build your camp near a spawn point and put 3 points into home defense so you can just stack 10 heavy laser turrets on your base and kite enemies into it after 1-tapping them with a round so you get xp for the kills. 
---
I mean I just heard this I swear I would never do such a thing
---
I did end up doing it for the Daily Score requirement.  My dislike for that mutation is not based on its difficulty but rather how it feels over all.  It just felt more like a gimmick that sucked the enjoyment out doing the OP for me.
---
So if required I will do them or to help my friends, if not I will be doing something more enjoyable.
---
And that is the gist of it for me.
---
I'll look for that, thank you!
---
Home Defense perk is under Agility, and yes that perk allows you to craft higher tiered turrets.
---
we play the same game? you know that every time they delay, fracture steel probably go to end of winter.
---
Did you just correct your own comment above?
---
Said animation is even in fallout 4's trailer
---
What do you think of the red viper skins?
---
I don't really wanna take shots at anyone, but it's starting to actually feel that way.  Have people just gotten so used to being unstoppable that they forgot how shooters work?
---
I'm more interested in what time do people stop asking this question
---
I’m not complaining, I like the fact that even the forest is more of a challenge now it’s just that the revolver is too slow to take on more than 1 or 2 at a time and as my character isn’t set up for pistols it’s just a waste of carry weight now. I scripped it and converted the ammo into points. It’d only be good for tagging legendaries now.
---
A build where you have basically no health shouldn't be a melee build to begin with. It should not be one hit. You are putting yourself in that situation and I'm glad they made the changes they did. Sorry the build isn't a god tier one hitting build anymore, but it never should have been a god tier one hit build in the first place
---
I didn’t speak to this myself because I’m decently set up and it wasn’t my experience yesterday but I am worried reading posts about level 20s struggling. And level 40s without good gear struggling.
---
damn bro, thats exactly what my friend was building, RIP
---
agreed. I've still not checked handmade skin because i'm heavy/melee, but seen multiple people are excited about it (and yeah - reskin from AK to M-16 should be good, because, at least, thats a bit strange to not have US-origin weapon in post-nuclear US). About PA skins - thats totally depending on taste - personally i before patch always used T60 with BOS paladin skin and minigun with BOS skin from NW rewards. In my opinion - we are lacking "serious" skins - maybe faction-themed, maybe with some realistic (as much as it could be appropriate in not-realistic semi-science fiction game) approach, because like 70% of PA skins are something star-striped or something crafted from junk/trash/scrap and technically cannot be used in battle. But other people could like it more than i. Overall, i'd rate this season rewards as B- for lack of unique and narratively-connected with ingame stories rewards and majority of things which noone will  ever use (like skins for T51 Power armor or some super-casual communists uniform based on late-USSR military fatigues).
---
Where did you read it was intentional? Patch notes? Not doubting you, I just want to be 100% on this in case they fix it after I respec!
---
Yep, I've always been an anti-armor heavy build and nothing else (Final Word user). I'm not noticing anything out of the ordinary with the patch, maybe 1 o 2 more bullets per enemy? Hard to judge as most of them are higher level now. But It's better balanced now IMO.
---
Before the patch I could solo Radiation Rumble pretty easily, and right now it's impossible, but ghouls have gone from lvl 40 to 50+, and there are quite a bit more of them now when you solo it. It really makes more sense now, I think the change is good for the game.
---
Some treasure notes would be very cool too.
---
I’m likening it.
---
I don't particularly care about the hacking, tbf, but I routinely use lockpicking for Forbidden Knowledge while I'm out and about.
---
I signed on yesterday for the first time in months (other than to grab my free BOS stuff, didn't waste time with ATLAS) just to see what's the deal with these cards. I'm lvl 190 and now have 3 legendary cards at rank 3 and 1 at rank 2. Not too shabby.
---
\*fixed it.
---
I use the HUD all the time instead of the pip boy already.  I think you are right I just need to bite the bullet and get rid of them.  I guess I could put them on my alt account?
---
Well I do miss some of the lower level easy kill stuff to knock out daily challenges. I like to do leader of pack and wolves used to die one hit to any crap weapon. No sir not so much now. But overall it’s cool I guess.
---
See, that's an actual valid complaint lol I can agree with that.
---
Wow, I thought it was a common chem for junkies. How much does it weight, sounds like an useful card for me so I can leave food/water behind and not worry about it. I've never actually paid attention to the hunger/thirst penalties but I am always carrying stuff to eat/drink.
---
Yeah, that's what I've got slotted in now.
---
I've been playing for about a month and had 3 mole rats kill me in Flatwood. Definitely harder for the newer, casual player.
---
And I think there are some people out there that are too quick to brush aside legit criticism because they think "lol just git gud."
---
Yep I finally actually had to get the stuff last night too lol. There goes my free ride.
---
This has been all over the PTS forums. (and yeah if you don't read them how would you know :)) Unfortunately I don't think it will ever be useful as an actual Charisma card. This is more.....here get better rates EVERYWHERE. [PTS Forum Link!](https://bethesda.net/community/category/312/fallout-76-pts?language%25252525255B%25252525255D=en&amp;language%252525255B%252525255D=en&amp;language%2525255B%2525255D=en&amp;language%25255B%25255D=en&amp;language%255B%255D=en&amp;language%5B%5D=en)
---
Everyone here seems to be echoing my experience playing, which is cool, but if the reports of emptying "dozens" of shotgun shells into a level 20 scorched and only doing 50% damage aren't exaggerated, then it definitely seems like it's a bug for some people.
---
People are saying that it's ruining their game and it seems real weird that a slight increase in difficulty would cause that level of vitriol, but maybe I'm wrong!
---
Thanks for the explanation. Took the post down so there won't be any other people panicking.
---
Ah, okay. I'll probably be back online later, I'll let you know if I see anything similar.
---
Or he gets better, like rest of the community (and you should), 1-3 bullets to kill and you tell this game is dead lol
---
I honestly don’t think the legendary stealth card is working at all , hard to tell with how bad they nerfed us but I’m seeing nothing as far as the next enemy taking more damage even with reaper
---
While I personally don’t mind the update, I think it will really turn away casual players. They will be forced to spend time working on their builds that they’d rather just be roaming around the wasteland.
---
Merge workbenches, I did it ages ago so it could’ve been changed in previous patches. I know I could merge my camp unit with broken workbenches last patch though and that doesn’t seem to work anymore.
---
Yes, thats one I was thinking of getting in all characters. But you need to max it in order to auto pick or auto hack lvl 3 stuff, right? You still need to carry one bobby pin? Lol.
---
Not saying your wrong BC I don’t test anything but it says on the card more stats if your close to your teammates and less if you’re not. Plus I’ve heard/read it was the +2/+3 scenario, which is why I took it. +2 is great no matter what. It is 100% likely I got wrong information tho
---
Personally I'm loving the changes. If anything my biggest gripe is it's a little  disappointing they still capped enemies in the Forest but hey ho.
---
 Any time there has been a serious issue in the past people have been pretty quick to investigate and record what's happening.
---
 You have a good day too dude.
---
That's the damage calc bug I was referring to. You have to keep shooting in VATS for the "magic" damage. Otherwise, your normal shotgun blast goes right back to the weird rubber-banding of the mob's health display.
---
I felt that way too but we found a work around with one person being PA melee. We did damage and that person finished everything. Got into a rhythm by second attempt. Weird challenge that is immersion breaking.
---
Yes get all of them.
---
They may be at zero health, but my Vampires UGL is still healing me if I shoot them.....
---
The update is great but they did kinda nerf damage and buff enemies
---
Ah, finally noticing my 3000 gunpowder after a month of being overweight.
---
Probably not worth to have bashing damage. Bayonets aren't a bad idea though, since suppressors don't matter in uplink and bayonets have a much faster bash/recovery speed than just bashing
---
I mean it works alright, but there is only one potential bonus for stealthers in this whole thing is the legendary perk which honestly should only apply to boss fights, not day to day fights.  I think that's fine (havent had an occasion to try it out), but when you consider the massive damage drop we got and the fact that you cannot use stealth (and thus can't sneak attack) in Ops, it's really not worth the pay off.
---
3 star bloodied cultist dagger for me.
---
My camp is under a power line tower across from Summersville.  I loved running down in to that creek and shanking all of the level 5 mirelurks that spawned (not to mention all of the Super Mutants in New Gad).  Now I have to run away to my camp and get help from my turrets.  Oh well, I guess I can at least get some scrip for it.
---
It's a great perk for both utility, survival and dumping a bit of medical maintenance. 
---
You can eat or drink whatever you want and wade through wherever with a near total disregard for radiation, safe in the knowledge you'll never start glowing in the dark again. I say nearly because Radiation Rumble does soak up a lot of juice so I'd still keep a radaway or 2 on hand for emergency situations like that.
---
I have not yet dropped into an ops yet. Question, probably dumb question, but can you damage resilient enemies with ranged and then finish the job with some melee-fu?
---
I noticed that, i one shoted level 72 creatures with my level 25 instigating double barrel shotgun, now it takes both shots to kill one (the first take 75% or more health), it affects me, but not alot.
---
I switched to crits perks.  I am like you, Bloody mess isn't as powerful as other options now.
---
I believe TSE is back on top in terms of damage... At least this is what people have been saying, I have yet to test it out myself.
---
Im level 65, cleared out a bunker to launch a nuke and all the robots were also 65..I must have killed 200 of these mofo's and got 3/4 of 1 level after a couple of hours of running around in there -I used to get about 112-160xp per kill in there  (killing level 42 bots minds u) now im getting 9xp per kill.  :(  
---
 i dont even feel like logging in anymore
---
You've won!!
---
Nah, it did the same last season. It's just a bit of a visual glitch, you're rank will still be where it should be.
---
Edit: Yes it's caused by buying ranks.
---
Sorry I went for a build that wasn’t an op heavy guns build where I one shot everything in the game. I actually wanted to do something with stealth and they can’t even do it right lmao
---
Same.  I've got a terrific pair of brass knuckles (faster attack speed, anti-armor, and increased strength) that I loved for anything in the Forest, even though I'm specced for stealth commando.  It was a ton of fun in Morgantown to jump and fly around like a superhero, drop down on some unsuspecting ghoul, and knock it out with one punch.
---
They're going in the stash box, I guess.
---
I doubt it.  BE would probably be better.
---
The one gun that you can't go wrong with is the .50 cal.  Even the non-legendary version can handle the almost everything except the SBQ, Earl, and encryptid.   Ammo is easy to make.
---
The legendary versions helps with ammo consumption because of the added damage per shot.  Furious and Hunters works well against the SBQ.   Vampires is almost a necessity for encryptid and Earl.
---
Also, if you can, get the new Ammo Factory legendary perk.  You can get up to an extra 150% ammo from it, 250% in total with ammosmith equipped.
---
Even daily op or not, i always prepare a knife. Not op but necessary
---
I couldn't disagree with you more. Weapon loot is one of the easiest ways to obtain crafting materials. Obviously a lot of loot is going to contribute to maintenance and ammo, what kind of god tier loot are you expecting from basic enemies? And I'm definitely leveling much faster than before. The patch is pretty great and it's making the game feel more like an actual fallout game
---
I'm finding it takes \~10 shots to kill super-mutants now with an AA stealth commando build. It's really noticeable that I'm only getting two kills before I need to reload, which is rough when taking on larger groups of enemies at close-to-moderate range.
---
I've played since the beta and when I leveled up I did melee until I was able to  create ammo well and only used a gun if I needed range. I didn't become a heavy gunner until I got my first Gatling gun as it drops a low level and is great on ammo. Not to mention I also had to deal with PvP and camp destruction. People newer to the game don't realize how over time, they made the game trivial. This update was just a bump back to making the wasteland scary again and having to actually survive.
---
Its a wasteland, survival is almost like another enemy your constantly fighting.
---
If someone is having issues they should re visit their build and also just simply ask for help. Its a co-op game now so everyone left but me is nice and wont try to kill you. Going it alone you are making it harder on yourself.
---
I haven't logged onto my Gunslinger or Stealth Sniper yet, but I've got a little bit trepidation about their damage output lol.
---
My main character (non-meta/bloody/junkies unarmed) is fine though at least.
---
I can't confirm, but I did see a post here earlier this morning claiming the bug was back.
---
Has nothing to do with 1st members being soft and everything to do with how Reddit will downvote a comment on one post into oblivion and then upvote the exact same comment on another post into the heavens. Myself and a friend both have 1st and really wish a lot of the features in it were available to everyone. If Bethesda wants to make money so badly, they really ought to put the scrap box and forward tent in the main game and put skins for that stuff in the Atom Shop. I can't remember the last time I saw someone running around with the default backpack skin.
---
I don’t play heavy guns.  My characters include:  Non-Bloodied Unarmed build using a Deathclaw gauntlet, High CHA Shotgun build using a TS/+10% aim, a sniper using an instigating weapon, and a bloodied commando whose not even using a bloodied weapon, he’s just using a bloodied build - he’s using a Mutant’s Handmade which is only 10% bonus damage.  Nothing is destroying any of my characters.
---
&gt;In 76 we seen the same thing. Past a certain level you become an almighty force to be reckoned with.
---
The problem is that your power in this game isn't really tied to level so much as gear. If you see a lvl 400 one-shotting things, it's not because they are lvl 400, it's because they have god-roll gear in all slots since they've been playing so long. Seeing a lot of posts right now where even level 100+ players are having issues because they are casual players that don't worry about min/maxing their build, but now they *have* to.
---
So they've made the game more balanced for people that are already god-tier or close to it but the people still working their way up and learning the game are getting fuckin' shafted right now. I can agree that the level scaling is pretty cool for the most part but I just got done putting 20 rounds of Final Word .50 cal into a friggin Tick before it died, so there's still a lot of tweaking that needs to be done. I'm handling just fine but that's because I've already got a min/maxed build. Not everybody plays Fallout like that and I feel like this update totally ignored those people.
---
Don’t hang up the knife yet, with the daily ops there is one of the mutations that makes the enemies unable to be killed with ranged weapons, So if you are normally a ranged player, you need to finish them off with melee, because no matter how many times you shoot them they will only drop to 1 hit point. But when they are dropped to 1 hit point they light up red, so you can swap over to a knife and run over and finish off everything in red.
---
Never underestimate knives. I never kept those for trash mobs but my melee character can even tank the Queen with a vampire's. And I use a vampire's mr. Handys too.
---
It’s not thin, just inside of the deep-dish 45s, imo.
---
Based.
---
When u get to lvl 50 choose survival shortcut as your legendary perk. Lvl 1 works great for me so far. No more food/water/disease issues. Best card imo.
---
Or your team might not be mutants
---
Weird, I remember working my ass off to get enough caps to buy anything worth in that dlc
---
Ghouls at white springs, cultists at point pleasant, scorched in the ski resort at top of the world, and enemies along the way. Call bullshit all you'd like, the patch is solid. Makes a fallout game actually feel like a fallout game and not a one tap simulator. Didn't hinder my ammo supply, and gave more xp then I was getting before for quicker leveling. I'm hype to make a third character soon with a new build and experience it from the very start, and even further disprove all the people crying because the game isn't just handing everything to them now and they actually have to fight stuff. So sad :(
---
I like this idea. 
---
I literally made a character over the weekend named “Ammo Mule” so I would stop dropping missiles and mini nukes. I really don’t want to lose ammo I looted fairly and I want to use these for fun later.
---
I have fallout 1st. I can make the ammo, but the cheap side of me hates wasting things I find.
---
Yeah, that's wrong.
---
I'm only commenting on your first paragraph.
---
Being casual doesn't mean you put all your perks into weight reduction, lockpick, crafting, camp building, etc.
---
Casual means that we just play the game for fun and don't take things too seriously. It means we'll make our build able to do the best damage we can without having to maintain a bloodied or junkies build. We don't feel the need to constantly farm legendaries, do every event that pops up or be the one doing the most damage. We don't have to have instigating, explosive weapons or ones with magic effects.
---
Being casual means having a good time and contributing to the overall effort.
---
This would be great if you could actually break down gunpowder you pick up into the original components but you can’t. 🤷‍♂️
---
I have an instigating bowie knife that I don't really think I'll use anymore - it would be *awesome* for a stealth melee build but my character's a loud heavy gunner. I don't have room in Strength for melee perks but it was great for dropping those low level scorched - guess I'll hold onto it for old times' sake or maybe give it to an alt but it was fun while it lasted.
---
Edit: actually, come to think of it, I might hold on to that knife for those certain types of enemies in daily ops that can only be killed by a melee hit. Bashing with my heavy gun should work just fine on one or two targets but if there's a large group with low health it'll be handy to have a quick melee weapon on hand.
---
I just generally go the “loot everything and sell to vendor” route. If they run out of caps? Just wait till their caps replenish and continue. And then of course the dead money dlc you can do a glitch to get all the golden bars
---
Bloodied still has top listed damage but the gap has come down quite a bit. Will have to go shoot some stuff and check numbers I guess.
---
Misc I think? It took me about 10 seconds to find it, I can't remember what category.
---
4 intelligence?  I have 14.
---
ass
---
assassin swing speed?
---
Ok good to know 👍
---
22 year old me easily spent that at the bar just about every weekend.
---
I didn't think you need to be stealthed for it to work, but there's some posts that indicate it never worked on RoboBrains or SentryBots.  Still, if it works on Gutsy's, it might be worthwhile.
---
I have been dealing with this for over a year.
---
I figured out they were targeting my fusion generator, and had built several concrete walls to protect it that they would constantly demolish.
---
   Since I moved it into a red rocket building, it’s been peacefully quiet.
---
No mole rat attacks, no pistol sniping super mutants, it’s awesome.
---
Just have the 3 gasbags to contend with now.
---
We split the duties. 2 heavy gunners wore them down and 2 melee cleaned up.
---
There's not much they haven't managed to fuck up at some point. Kinda impressive lmao
---
Yeah they should not listen to brain dead crybabies. Most players have no problems and enjoying the game currently, servers are full, only vocal minority came here to cry. gAmE iS rUiNeD
---
Oh the enemies are through the roof strong. However God it's good having to be *careful* in Appalachia again.
---
I feel my damage is on par- it's the dang monsters that are causing misinterpretations imo. They would have been tough BEFORE the damage calculation/multiplication (etc) rework, being Level 100 etc.
---
You don't need a glitched gun.  Smh.  Plenty of good regular guns.
---
With Electric Absorption I think most Energy weapons are gonna be poo against us now. I'm tanky enough to walk up and stab people tbh.
---
I guess we are in the stage of the game's life where they need metrics and engagement to justify its continued existence- and thus intentionally make the game into as much of a fucking chore as possible to keep you in it.
---
I got better shit 2 do.
---
Thanks for the tag and the report! Sending you a PM to ask for some more info.
---
I've had one problem with the Daily Ops involving Protectrons hitting me from long distance but haven't had any other problems overall. This is a great update so far.

 &gt; Thanks for the tag and the report! Sending you a PM to ask for some more info.

No, I’m always about at 75% health. Not on purpose, I just always find myself that way.
---
Not Earle.
---
Price of a:
---
mMmERmPH!!!! *double rear kick*
---
*0 cream* : 10% build budget
---
The realization it’s not worth it: priceless.
---
I don’t think their much use in ACP. After they join they leave in like 1 to 3 minutes and waste a spot that could have been a better player.
---
They then get on here and complain why they do no damage to mobs when there is already plenty of info out there.
---
Idk if you know this or not but you get perk coins by scrapping unwanted regular perk cards
---
This is happening to me as well.  Very annoying.
---
Different wendigo colossus. Not Earle. Just ordinary rare'ish (10% chance i believe) nukezone spawn.
---
Wanna see something funny?
---
[My perks loadout. ](https://i.imgur.com/cg4KVWD.jpg)
---
You would be hard pressed to find a loadout worse than this.
---
But guess what?
---
Using a level 45 Excavator suit, and with just one legendary weapon - Final Word - and ZERO addictions, mutations, or other stat-affecting statuses, I stroll through most places with absolute ease.
---
The game isn't hard. The game was never hard.
---
It's just not easy for those who abused builds anymore.
---
That doesn't make any sense.
---
that's why you need something  explosive to get a few shots in. every round was 1.5k xp with my normal grenade launcher
---
You can only carry 5 of them at a time at R1 (increases to 10 at R4) but they weigh a paltry 0.1lbs and I just realised when I checked that they actually do 200% to your thirst bar and food gets 100%.
---
5 may not sound like a lot but something's going badly wrong if you're using more than 2 of them an hour tops to fix your bars.
---
It also heals u.
---
Why post here, instead of the trading sub?
---
Laughs in quad crossbow
---
Fun fact - you can get the Wendigo Colossus &amp; the Queen to fight each other....just pull him out of the Forest.
---
It's epic to watch.
---
I want to know if it keeps the level when you unequip it. Don't really want to waste the coins to find out.
---
Always been like this. They upped the spawn chance to 10% when season 1 came out. I actually fought him there about ten times before colossal problem came to consoles. Everytime I get done the queen I run over most time he’s not there. But when he is there I wave ppl over. Other night after queen ppl actually showed up unlike the other 8 times most came was one other if any body. But if he isn’t there I will check back every 15 minutes sometimes you get lucky
---
They’re typically trade only
---
Meaning, being casual is enjoying the game for what it is, a game, and not a job.
---
Im mid 400's level wise and a max effort vats build. Its takes close to that in ammo im sure. I ran the tests before and after.
---
I think you’re describing a bad player, not casual.   It’s a different circle on the Venn diagram.  Some players who are casual are also bad.  Casual can just mean the amount of hours you put into the game, how seriously you take the game, what your end goals are when you play the game.
---
I would consider myself casual, because I don’t spend a ton of time on the game, I don’t take it seriously at all (I don’t bother going out of my way to trade with players), and yeah, I’m ok with wearing ghoul slayer armor when I plan on going after ghouls.  My end goals focus more on building up a camp and just relaxing and enjoying the atmosphere.
---
I got 16 strength from it.  It was great
---
My buddy said: oh fuck one more bug thanks beth
---
Ehm yeah just read instructions your lazyness isnt bethesdas fault
---
Welcome and I hope you can get this resolved!
---
We survived and adapted TS nerf, explosive nerf and we will survive this. They want god mode enabled and put zero effort. Game is closer to fo4 survival now, which is great
---
Yeah it works nicely, I think. Enemies are always shooting me while I'm sprinting at them so I should get that +40% damage when I plow into them with a instigating power attack.
---
Cuz as I understand, *everyone*, including you, gets the damage bonus on that enemy as long as a) you're on a team, and b) the enemy is attacking you.
---
All my perks together only boost my damage by adding 15 extra dmg
---
Hardly. Loss of durability, potential loss of items. Radiation damage/traps is a quick killer. 
---
And now the game has changed enemies do not go down as fast. So even more risk.
---
Thanks for the info! Didn't know that :)
---
Close, try "the gear i grinded for months to get is now pretty much useless and does less than 75% of what it used to and now I have to totally respecc"
---
Well, in my case anyway 😃
---
Yea I knocked it down to 1 with good salt 1 and ricochet 1. I have same bulld. With serendipity of course. Might just take it out completely for ricochet 3. I need more defense than offense from luck.
---
Why is anyone that doesn’t play like you do a bitch? The game is harder for casual players. Players that used to be able to log on and just play for a bit and not have to worry about constantly grinding for ammo, mats, etc. We need a large group of all kinds of players to keep this game going. If most of the casual players give up and move on and only the diehards remain the game dies. This is coming from someone that plays almost every day.
---
Good to know! Thank you.
---
As a sniper/commando my only complaints are :
---
1. I can no longer headshot everything. Ok, some things should be able to take multiple hits to the head, but not humanoids.
---
2. Bugs, flies, and other insects are too beefy. Yes, I can take them out. It should take 4-5 bullets to obliterate a bloatfly.
---
3. On Daily Ops, not having any sneak is OK but not great. If I'm invisible due to chameleon and hiding in the dark of the mall, and my gear is suited to making me invisible, I feel I should at least be in Caution or something. I don't need full sneak, but \*some\* sneak would be great. Right now my whole build is shot in Ops. Thank god I'm \*fast\*.
---
Otherwise, I enjoy the challenge. I actually have to think about combat now and I realized as a full health build I didn't have to before. I find myself sneaking around more for a better line of sight and hesitating before attacking.
---
Junkies isnt a magic weapon my man. If it was they be doing alot more dmg then bloodied which they dont. And magic weapons from my knowledge need  a couple of effects to make it magic
---
ive seen this tooi was trying to place some stuff for the daily but my camp budget was still maxed out even though i had scrapped like 15 things
---
i would assume that this has something to do with them removing the ammo factory exploit thing
---
i really hope they didnt reduce camp budget
---
With the new Hack and Slash perk and just get two people with fast melee weapons to be Cleave builds and you're good. I'm gonna whore myself out every time I see Resilient now cauae frankly it is insanely fuck.
---
Rip my instigating cult dagger with swing and strength 😭
---
I'm all for everything but the enemy scaling. I just don't find that as fun killing all the same level things now. They are making it more and more grindy and are losing their fallout roots.
---
I haven’t been able to download the update yet, But from the sounds of this post I’m not gonna like what I see when I finally get on being a Bloodied Stealth Commando and all...
---
(Worried my B3325 Handmade, B2525 Handmade, and B2525 Fixer are going to be useless now.)
---
Imagine. 0.001fps, junk everywhere, server crashes. Forever.
---
I both agree and disagree with this post, no disrespect but I consider myself a casual player as with work and life in the way I can only play a few hours here and there, but just because I’m a casual player does not mean I’m not end endgame with a fully set up build or two, furlough gave us plenty time to sort that. 
---
Just because someone like me plays casually does not mean we aren’t set up builds dedicated in the roll we picked and pursued, now on my rifleman alone dotting to and from over the years I’ve played at least 500 hours on him and to see more than three hundred hours worth of grinding go down the drain and now do less damage than my barely lvl 30 pistol character it’s a bit of a low blow, the game needed changed and readjusted I’m not complaining about that, just some of the damage nerfs are too extreme dependant on your build, my weak ass heavy guy now puts my other set up builds to shame, any RPG game regardless of platform or company should not condemn some of their player base just because they don’t play it to the same extent as others, it just leads to an unenjoyable experience.
---
On what weapon?
---
Then those people aren't casuals but just plain old idiots lol
---
I mean no offense to some of us, I can be pretty dumb too. But there's a plethora of information out there for people to take advantage of rather than coming on here to complain.
---
Bloody power fist
---
Well good for you 
---
Nerfing my AAE handmade by almost 10% dmg is bullshit.  My B2525 primed handmade took a similar hit.  Haven’t checked my other legacy weapons but all I have to say is FU to the whiners because once again you got your way.  They rarely buff anything in this game but will always oblige at nerfing - including stealth jobs.
---
Ok after a couple minutes of research you are correct it’s +2 in a group -2 solo, so strange in numbers is probably the culprit. So you win this round Enclave scum. /s
---
They need to do what Control just did - add sliders so the player can choose if they want to be stronger, fight bullet sponges, or somewhere in between.
---
Level 230 here, hot knife through super mutant butter.
---
Yeah you’re probably right. Honestly I myself am trying not to follow meta rn and just do whatever makes the game more convenient for me. But I may have to get myself some of those extra special points now that everybody is mentioning it.
---
Thy Lady is on it ppl!
---
TS shotgun operates the same in vats just takes more ammo to drop things.  Double maybe?
---
Commandos made out way better then riflemen 🤞🏻you are ok hopefully
---
Thats because you do zero damage and still do zero damage lol
---
Exactly. I work a demanding job and at the end of my day I want to have fun. My idea of fun isn't logging on and doing the same dailies day after day while farming the same areas for legendaries all while having to maintain a low health build. No thanks.
---
Are you also using nerd rage? If you havent tryn n also invest in the armor plated back pack mod.
---
I also run 75 posion resist n helps in situations very well.
---
Food and water aren't hard to get.
---
Good to know. I hate weapon bashing. Half the time I end up tossing a grenade, the other half I flail wildly and miss the target I was trying to bash completely. Is there a perk that makes weapon-swapping faster? I think that was a Fallout 3 thing.
---
How dare you play the game in a way that isn't how I play it. You really should change that and start min/maxing your build or just stop playing.
---
\-OP probably
---
I get his point not specifically about your post but it does seem alot of people like to complain and grief about this game so hes just taking a defensive posture
---
Shush you pa hater ;) seriously though about time pa got some loving, no backpack perks, no underarmour perks not to mention legendary armour effects and perks. You surely can't begrudge pa getting something
---
All that steel and concrete grinding together would create a spark!
---
Really bloody annoying, they really have zero idea about UI design.
---
Feels more like a "Fallout 76-2" goal than something we can expect any time soon.
---
Agree it would be nice. I'd like to check challenges, new atom shop stuff, etc --see what is available today in general without having to log on and load up the game. 
---
The ability to manage my vendors in a non-pipboy interface would also be nice. Don't get me wrong, I like the pip-boy aesthetic. Game menus in an in-game item was neat back in Fallout 3. But it become kind of slow and cumbersome over the years. Would love a better way to manage inventory. Even in a companion app.
---
lmao yeah
---
I was trying to be respectful to OP but dude really just seems like a dick to be honest.
---
Talking about the legendary perks in this instance
---
Hmmmm I did those two events yesterday.... don’t remember if they dropped max level gear.  Are they supposed to now?
---
Ha. Except for that for me it's +2/0 because of class freak.
---
Wrong

My daily driver is an AAE handmade with powerful auto receiver.  I went from 121 dmg per hit to 111 dmg per hit.   That’s almost 10%.  
---
So it wasn’t just bloodied
---
Yeah I love it. I was able to take out Lead Belly and squeeze in Lifegiver (since stuff does more damage), and any rads from eating are just whisked away.
---
Not to mention I take zero rads in the nuke zone now (with the stealth suit).
---
I have done that and still can't share more then the 1 I could before. Guess it's a bit broken.
---
Her rolling pin production cannot be stopped.
---
It's the worst of everything all put together:
---
 - Stealth builds are turned off, which I know is a constant but it still hurts to be told I can't use my build that I've had since day 1
---
 - Resilient, which is unintuitive unless you read everything before you go in, and isn't fun gameplay regardless
---
 - Robots, which means Gutsies who ignore your armor *and* the weirdness of hits from Robobrain Tesla Rifles (feels like you're being punched out of nowhere, as if a NW hacker is around)
---
 - The Burrows is a maze; even though I've been there a few times, it's super tough to navigate
---
Definitely doesn't make me want to try the next Daily Op when it changes today, that's for sure.
---
Truth. You rely on a magic eventually you're getting king hit in the grapes too.
---
What level
---
Seems like they're the way to go again

With update 22, I'm noticing the health rubber banding more. I used to be able to take out any muties with a vats hit from my Instigating Pump Shotgun. Now it takes two hits to kill level 100 muties. However, under optimal circumstances, I take them down to ~1% health on the first hit but then it bounces up to 5-30% health and it takes another one or two hits to finish them off.
---
That being said, I'm better off using my Vampire's +33% VATS Combat Shotgun which can still take out level 100 muties in 2 vats hits.
---
Gotcha. New Vegas is arguably the best in the series so I would recommend playing that.
---
Do you happen to know if legendary endurance works to boost health points?
---
Just that buffs from food and chems that boost END don't seem to increase health so I'm wondering if the perķ might not either. Similar to the charisma thing.
---
Yup! not a glitch they made it this way :)
---
Use the gunpowder you have. Bank your acid/cloth
---
Exactly. I feel that’s a really well put explanation for how a fair few of us are feeling at the moment. The game isn’t too hard, or unplayable, it’s just really different. In some ways, dishearteningly so. I was expecting the “damage nerfs”, but I wasn’t (at level 117) spectacularly powerful. I was expecting level appropriate mobs but didn’t realize it meant the area level caps were moot and the “chance” of running into the highest level was becoming a guaranteed, no matter where you are. 
---
I’d never even been to the bog until the daily op yesterday, no joke, because I stayed in my lane while trying to keep up with the score run, events, building and vending, and trading all while learning the weapon and perk system. Everything does feel rushed all the time lately, but I’m gonna hang in there and take advice and adapt.
---
I stuck to the areas of the map with level caps because I knew what to expect and had time to prepare for venturing out into the more “late game” areas. My camp is in the forest BECAUSE it’s peaceful there, because I didn’t want to have to be fighting off max level everything the moment I log in til the moment I log off. 
---
To hear people respond to your completely reasonable commentary on the game with callous, snarky remarks is really disheartening, though. I’m not a min/max build, but it doesn’t mean I’d devalue their complaints (or the weeks and weeks of score auto complete complaints). If you’re not of like mind and you can’t empathize with the situation, scroll on. The post clearly wasn’t meant for you. But I’m with OP, it’s not the same game and that sucks.
---
*edited for spelling
---
Did you mock someone for being bald?
---
For me, everything is good, but - one wasteland made weak as F. My auto rifle build is useless, creating gauss rifle build.
---

---
But what is that challenge GETTING you? It's the same exact enemies in the same exact areas with the same exact loot, just a lot more difficult to kill now. What "problem" is this solving? If high level people were bemoaning the fact that there are a lot of areas that just aren't relevant to them anymore when it comes to wanting a challenge, then GENERALLY the solution to that should be to add more areas/enemies/quests/etc to the game to satiate that need. All this is doing is just making the same exact stuff you've been fighting forever now take more bullets to kill. ........ok? Short term that may seem like more "satisfying" combat but at the end of the day what does it matter? It's all still the same stuff.
---
Also for all the ultra high level people who play this game in that way there are surely PLENTY more people who play the game the opposite way; people who level/play gradually and aren't really interested in having EVERY SINGLE FIGHT be instantly noticeably harder than it was before. Fallout, for many people, isn't about combat. It's about world exploration, scavenging, just doing mindless daily quests, things like that. This game just became so, so much more of a chore for those people and like I said, there are a lot of those people.
---
I get that the game needs to continually add content to keep the end game people happy so they have new things to do. They absolutely do. But this is not "adding" content. This is just upping everything you fight's HP to require you to constantly use more bullets and stimpacks. That's the ONLY thing changing here. What's the point? That doesn't feel like a "reward" to the people who play the game endlessly, it feels like the most basic way possible to get them to be quiet. And for those of us who prefer to pick and choose when we're in the tougher fights, now that's every fight. I just don't see the point.
---
Also I now need to wear my power armour all the time, before I saved it for fighting tough legendaries.  I liked not having to wear it and show my outfits off.
---
Yup.  I suppose if I got a magic gatling plasma than maybe, but I never want to use any other weapon again.
---
I get what you are saying but it is kinda dumb to implement a damage nerf and an enemy buff( if you are a high level player) at the same time. The game was never hard you are right, and still isnt very hard.
---
I’m a Vamps Heavy build but my one star Serrated Vampires Combat Knife is the secret sauce of my Vamps build. It’s the most faithful backup weapon I’ve got when everything else is broken. When need be, I can tank swarms of ghouls at white spring without breaking too much of a sweat. It is the AmEx of the Wastelands. Never leave CAMP without it
---
I'm a generalist. I take each of the initial 3 10% damage boost perks for each weapon type so I can have some variety in my gameplay.
---
I've had no problems mowing down literally everything, whether it be using a powerfist, a pitchfork, a lever action, gauss rifle, heavy weapon, handmade, etc.
---
The only exception is pistols, which have always been lagging. However, they perform better in this patch for me than in previous ones.
---
If you're having a hard time, post your build, and get constructive criticism. **If you're having an issue, you're doing something wrong.**
---
Well if you dripped a robot it make it go critical and explode 
---
If you want to avoid this don't use perk cards and legendary effects that cripple.
---
Yes, wait til the magic weapons go bye bye and then the non metas will all start crying.  Some don’t even know they’re using magic weapons, but they will!
---
One of the best perks for high health non-power armor builds. Personally I don't use it since my build is a high health power armor tank, but I can see it being useful even with that build.
---
I can see where they are coming from but this is an online game, they evolve all the time. 
---
I guess people would not be as angry as they are if Bethesda had given everyone a one time free respecc option to change builds.
---
Incoming scorched underwear!!
---
Can someone point me in the way of info for maxed out bloodied builds I haven’t been on in a while and I just want to see how disappointed I might be when I log on
---
I agree I love the patch even the damage nerf being now it’s like playing fallout 4 on the hardest difficulty. The enemies that are supposed to be strong are actually strong now. I have 3 bloodied fixers and got them all from purveyor and it was fun for the two months I had them to kill things quick but now I feel I gotta prepare for stuff better and actually watch out for the strong enemies.
---
Thank you and thanks again.
---
When I started reading I thought 5 is more than you actually need. But how 200% of thirst bar works? Is it like when you fix a weapon with weapon artisan? It really seems to be good for me as all my characters have speed demon. Thanks for the nice tip. I would never try this one if you didn't tell me.
---
If they do it a Fallout 1st item, it will make worth paying the subscription, but i would like it to be an Atom shop item, it would be cool tho...
---
I think the more people play and get used to that you’ll see it happen like you described. Very efficient. It always takes a little time. I remember encryptid being an absolute shit show but after a week or so people got the hang of it. On day one some people expect everyone to be perfect in the rush for the rare drops and I don’t think that’s realistic.
---
I’d agree they needed a buff but making stealth completely useless in the process was idiotic
---
... yes. But I am talking about un-equipping and re-equipping your cards to reset the other bonuses. Sometimes I have to take my armor off and put it back on to get the unyielding bonuses as well. Thems is just the breaks
---
Fr that may be my next one
---
I can still one-shot lower level Scorched and Super Mutants using my Instigating Lever-Action Rifle and stealth. It may be that this limitation is exclusive to melee.
---
I’m still going to keep it. My knife was a two star assassin’s combat knife. My friend gave it to me shortly after launch when we didn’t understand legendaries and thought 50 damage was amazing lol
---
I don't generally run Utricite because the game has been so easy but, I have not fought the queen since patch 22 maybe I'll have to make the switch.
---
I'd be one-shotting things except I have to bash them after.
---
What nerf?
---
Jut tested, it still exists.
---
Whole reason I have not had vendors up in months. Do not trust the vending system as it works currently.  Not being a fear monger, but just too many post not to have some merit.
---
I was just beginning to suspect it was broken.
---
damage reduction &gt; hp &gt; damage resistance (assuming you have at least around 300 dr/er)
---
I usually run with 8 end if my build can spare the points, for fireproof, lifegiver and radicool.
---
In Misc, far right menu.
---
When the season is over and it's replaced with "Why aren't there any daily challenges anymore?" questions.
---
Adding the fixer plan only helps get drops from events and it only really helps if you don’t have any other plans read. 
---
For example I have my secondary character at level 63 and he has only read fixer and handmade plans. That’s it!!! So When I do boss events like queen or EARLE I actually do get more of those. I will say from experience that it does not feel like it works when going to the purveyor,  although I have read it is supposed to. 
---
Note. 
---
This only applies for plans you have to learn. I also get drops from plans preset that Bethesda automatically gives your characters.   But it gives you a way better chance of fixer/handmade drop.
---
Great change! I guess I’ll be setting up my survival tent outside the Overseer’s house for Davenport’s daily mission lol
---
It is misc.
---
you won't be crafting more ammo since the legendary perk about doubles the ammo amount you crafted before
---
I’m aware of how it all works. What I’m saying is that your suggestion would be brilliant if only gunpowder could be broken back down.  I am constantly making ammo so it isn’t an issue for me.
---
Is it normally empty or can you join other players in this Daily Op? Because the first time I did it, I was the only one there and would've appreciated a little backup.
---
That does 58 base, so 20% should be 11.  Assuming you have just have iron fist, that's sounds about right.
---
Should change your title. Don’t change/leave your group if your in daily op while solo.
---
The way I read your title is that your team was leaving you in the dust in daily op.
---
Same here.
---
And even the weapons/armor.  That stings.  Because we don't have the stash space to keep every God-level weapon we come across, so we end up selling some.  But when it later turns out that we should've kept them, that burns me up.
---
Maybe just scroll through the posts from yesterday, best advice.
---
That’s a fair point too, though. I’m glad we at least got the ability to trash perk cards we never use. Now it’s quicker to throw on Ammosmith and Super Duper at my camp when I’m trying to make ammo. I wish we got perk loadouts already
---
soloed at exactly 8 minutes yesterday. goddamn bashing.
---
I just don’t understand why not a single AAA game can’t just release a game and leave it. So many games I loved got ruined 6 months later for no reason.
---
Still happens. If you are moving fast enough and drop in just the right way you don't get the "power slam" effect. This has always been this way.
---
I also experience this on PS4.
---
Well i can tell you this unless you blueprinted the ammo factory and stashed insane ammo on a mule the risk to reward isnt there anymore. For what it took me to drop a 75 scortchbeast or mirelurk queen has honestly times by 5 at least. Before patch was 1 mag and done with my j2525 hm. Now its a complete waste of ammo. Ive found myself running from enemies where i used to kill them. You ask why its simple, ammo. Im in the mid 400's level wise and dont care about xp so why waste materials on non legendary bullet sponges for trash. This game is ruined.
---
I have more than just iron fist also I deal 360
---
Yes, but bugged can refere to a much broader term. I.e. a weapon that can't be reloaded is bugged. A weapon like the gauss rifle that just doesn't hit in vats is bugged. And a weapon that screws up the damage calculation formula is also bugged - with a very specific kind of bug. And that bug was named by angryturtle to a "Magic" bug - because the weapon "magically" does more damage than it should, without there beeing an explanation for it. 
---
So, I'm going to continue using the magic weapon phrase to describe that behaviour, because it is a phrase that has been coined for this specific bug and everyone who reads the word "magic weapon" in fallout 76 can identify the meaning behind it (or google and find out) - since there is nothing else magic related in fallout (besides the eldrich horror questlines)
---
I really doubt we can blame it on a 15+ year old engine...lol your probably very right
---
I only have done two but I really enjoy them also
---
Nice! Took me a couple tries with a team to get it too. I love the ops too, it's nice to have content that is actually difficult for endgame players
---
Yeah, I chose to just speed run it to the next uplink and recommended everyone did same, worked a charm 
---
Exactly 8 mins solo? That's impressive bro
---
Serendipity, Dodgy, Nerd Rage will help and bolstering armor
---
If you haven’t done so already, consider carrying a shishkebab as a melee option.  The energy damage has been converted to fire, which most enemies are much less resistant to, and you can use it to heal allies with the Friendly Fire perk.  It’s must have for events like Project Paradise, especially now.
---
Cheers bro 🍻😉
---
The only difference I've noticed after 50 is I get a lot more XP now.  Getting 142 XP a kill at Tea Time with no buffs etc. is hilarious.
---
I'm a below 50 player too. Tried to do a 'easy' event with super mutants. I got rekt hard. I was using an entire clip on their head just to kill one. I got overrun and killed half a dozen times before the event failed.  
---
Ammo consumption is an issue now too. I main 308 and 45 and I can't net positive anymore. I ran out of 308 and have 250 45 ammo left.
---
Oh for sure!!
---
Follow Through
---
Didnt sneak get that 40 percent damage buff card? They definitely blitzed poor bloody commando in ops though those robots were ruthless yesterday yo the sneak character
---
Life Giver also
---
Um... Ammo factory? 250% ammo?  450% ammo with ammosmith.
---
Again your only looking at it from the point of high level not low levels as well. Your entitled to your opinion. It just seems high level players are moaning cause they can't one kill and are dying more.
---
Very interesting! Thank you for sharing.
---
You managed to get Elder?
---
Because every other Fallout game made that shit optional
---
Thanks. Did that but just turns into a “Bethesda sucks” or “good update” conversation. Was looking for some more concise takeaways since I haven’t played for a while. Appreciate the response though.
---
Keep it for daily ops
---
Is it really that god for a PA? Should I get rid of the electric absorption or whatever perk for it?
---
Yeah, Hotspot is what I'm using. Like $130 a month and I get 15 gb of Hotspot before they throttle down to the megs
---
What extras do you get for achieving the timed ranks?
---
Omg, he WAS. 😢
---
I just started an unarmed build, what foods are you using?
---
I'm not expecting god tier loot from basic enemies (though you DO potentially get the best loot in the game almsot exclusively from legendary trash mobs, but that's a whoooole other topic).  That's the point, though.  The loot is nothing, and now we have to work harder for it.  That's not fun.    
---
These monsters SHOULD be fodder to high level players.  The problem with this game is that there was never any kind of real difficulty progression.  Partially because the setting kind of naturally precludes it a bit, and partially because they simply didn't have a good handle on balancing an online game.     
---
We essentially have on a scale of 1-10 level 1 (scorched, ghouls etc), level 2 (high level ghouls, super mutants, stronger mire lurks,) , Level 3 (Mirelurk Queen, Assultrons, cryptids) Level 4 (Scorchbeasts, Sheepsquach) Level 8 (Imposter and Earl) and level 10 (SBQ).  There's no levels 5-7, (and ideally something a bit harder than Earl, but not as hard as SBQ), progress just jumps from things you can kill by yourself with minor difficulty to things you need a party to kill.  We need MANY more high level monsters designed for mid and high level solo/duo players, more encounters with a party in mind, and more sever level threats.  We SHOULD feel powerful fighting trash mobs that are just there for progression to the real stuff, and to farm for resources.  We should be powering up to deal with big unique to fight threats.  OPs are actually good, they fall in the like 6-7 level, so that's a good part of this patch for sure, cept for pushing out stealthers for no good reason.      
---
Instead of nerfing the shit out of everyone they should have tweaked the problematic affix and perks, actually fix the broken weapon issues, buff up the unused weapons and filled out that challenge meter from 5-10.    
---
No one disputes that this game was in DIRE need of a rebalance, in fact people have been calling for one almost since the game started, but this was just bad, and lazy, and didn't make the game any more fun to play.  It just made people weak so things take longer.  That's just not fun.    
---
As for making the game feel more like a fallout game... what fallout game are you talking about because I always ended up basically a god of death by mid game no matter what I did.
---
Ammo factory. Single shot builds are done for, automatic builds are pretty much the only thing meta right now. 
---
I also enjoy far flung fireworks, it makes me laugh
---
Correct, as well as armor penetration and faster swing speed
---
&gt;Free education always leads to lower standards for education.
---
That's just wrong. Many countries that offer free education, consistently rank at the top of internationally ranked education systems. Many of them rank significantly higher than the United States. 
---
Even education in the USSR was fairly well respected, though not without some significant issues, mostly related to doctrine and oppression.
---
I don’t think it’s fair to say “a bit less dps”. In most cases we’ve seen a 50% or more nerf to damage across the board. I’m not saying it was or wasn’t necessary, but you can’t play it off as “there was hardly a change to damage”. There is no question everyone is doing significantly less damage, some more than others.
---
I went from 1 shotting to 1 shotting with 0 damage boosting perks equipped.  \*shrug\*
---
Pretty sure mods are taken into account.  Just not other modifiers.
---
Yeah but from what I've seen atoms don't carry over, they're based on the launcher you use. How they justify that if the character transfers over i have no idea.
---
Bloody tank build
---
Fast travel is still broken
---
Well I can still kill enemies pretty quickly so I would say it's not really THAT bad...
---
It does increase HP afaik. Charisma seems to be the only one not giving us all their benefits. And you'd think Charisma would be ALL about the sharing! lol
---
Yeah, so 15 does seem pretty low.
---
Deathclaw welington or deathclaw steak, yogie ribs, mutton chops, glowing meat steak, mutant hound chops, 
---
I also use nuka darks, using cola nut &amp; party boy perk u get 6 times the benefit.
---
Well, there's a LOT to unpack, because a new season AND a complete re-working of gameplay hit yesterday. We're still adjusting to the new way of doing things right now.
---
That being said, in my personal opinion, the game is better than it has ever been.
---
Considering that there’s a power armor display with an Armor Ace theme, I’d say it’s safe to expect that one to drop in the next month or two.
---
I can almost hear the screechy aol dialup noises in the background
---
Ah so TSE got a buff? I used a TSE Handmade before switching to my B3325, how’s it compare? I still have my old TSE Handmade.
---
Internet is fast everywhere but through Bethesda launcher
---
Two seconds.
---
What rads, infiltrator, and ammo factory are so good for my full health, heavy gun junkies build
---
I meant that after recent nerf Strangler PA really lost its perceived value; I stopped using it in both pve and pvp. If some high-lvl mooks are vulnerable to acid, it might lend some usefulness to it again.
---
I dont know if you are aware but it is not mele only, you just have to bash them with mele to finish them off.
---
You're thinking of cultist blades I believe, cultist daggers to my knowledge still drop legendaries. Cultist blades are the 1 hand medium attack speed variant, more like a short sword.
---
Dude, I've died like 50 times today, it made no difference.  I didn't need to repair anything, and if I did who cares?  I can repair shit all day long.  Any high level player can.
---
Damn it, my best solo time was 8:08 after a few tries. Could have had sub-8 but ended up dying to a stunlock from two gutsies in the final fight. If it's exactly 8:00, does that still unlock elder rewards?
---
There is nothing that can be given.  Losing 15 AGI switching in to PA is enough by itself to make it a bad decision and that's just the tip of the iceburg on what you lose.
---
I’m downloading now so looking forward to seeing some of the changes. Thanks again
---
No, it isn't that a crippled bot is self destructing, because I get the pop-up of items on their corpse, which indicates they are truly dead.  THEN sometimes they explode.
---
I don't bc i have to check on it several times an hour to make sure it's even still downloading at all. Just tried it though to see what happens. Hopefully when I flip back over it hasn't stopped 😅
---
I moved a point from agility, so now have 6 cards in charisma (8 points total) and I can only share one 1* card.
---
This compared to 200 poison resistance or 5 perk points, 250% ammo?  Not worth it imo.
---
Let me reach into the Bag of Moronic Responses. There’s gotta be something in here.

---
Ignore my other post, I didn't see this one. Lol
---
It should be the cultist blade. 👍
---
I only run 6
---
I'm not sure how I'm only looking at it from the point of high levels.....I'm talking about both scenarios. 
---
I certainly don't consider myself "high level".....I'm level 65 and everything I said above applies to me just as much as someone who is 165. The point I'm making is that no matter what level you are, level 10 or level 100, what's the point? This change isn't getting you anything other than EVERYTHING requiring more bullets/stimpacks to kill. I'm just not really of the opinion/belief that a huge # of people are playing Fallout primarily because they crave difficult combat constantly and even if they were, adding combat like this as a solution to that adds the combat yes, but with no reward/incentive to go along with it.
---
No, it's still just visual, is my understanding.
---
before the update you could shoot anywhere and oneshot stuff. now players with consistent good aim get rewarded way more
---
I think the odds of BLM burning down his house are about as small as that migrant caravan of doom from 2018 burning down his house. Is the caravan here yet? Still waiting... zzzZZZzzz

Here's the "Red Viper" paint on my leather armor. The paint does look different depending on what armor your wearing, but this will give you an idea of how it looks on leather, and the shade of red it is.

---
So, can take out an engine block, but not a skull ?
---
Yeah, that’s a nerf.
---
I think he has the same problem as me - bashing just isn't connecting with the target. You think you're in range, but the bash misses for some reason. So you back up or get closer and keep trying to bash until it works. Is that the problem? If so, I totally feel you, I hate gun bashing.
---
Brother ive spent 2 years trading for the best of the best for a reason. That reason is to melt everything. Ive been cut in half damage wise. Even after mags bobbles amd chems i can barely hit my old base damage. How the hell is that fun? Thats trash. The game was ruined because people like yourself who werent max damage dps dealers. You wanna have a food build good for you. I wanna melt. And a 50%+ buff is crazy the game is ruined. It gives no reason to even play.
---
I'm surprised theres no energy resistance legendary perk.
---
I was just thinking how nice it would be to just be able to kick rad roaches, because now they actually can take a shot, and what a waste of ammo.
---
I'm on ps4
---
The only thing stopping me from doing that with my junkies 50 cal is having to harvest up the high radiation fluids in large numbers. I have some at the moment, but these always seem to be the hardest to gather up.
---
Curious what rank are you? Me and my friends are rank 400 and we can only max out 2 legendary cards
---
Whats your armor amount?
---
Agreed.  My outlook is simple:  It doesn't matter what Bethesda does, and it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks, I'm not going to let it stop me from having fun.  Like any MMO, it's gonna change, and I'm ready to change with it.
---
I was about to say this. My guess would be script machine.
---
Probably just for the scrip machine.
---
Looks pretty cool thanks!
---
Happened once to me then did it once again and was fine
---
I'll see how that goes, but I don't expect the increase there to cover extra bullets used.  I have to use my main weapons way more often then I did before.  I can no longer switch in something to use up the junk ammo I have collected to kill low level enemies.
---
Much more wear and tear for guns and armor was my (brief) experience last night.  Plus lots of extra bullets used.
---
In regards to the Legendary Perk Card...it does feel a bit silly now that an ammo perk card is now considered required in order to not suffer erosion of quality of life.   I feel sorry for the players that are around 50 having to suffer through this and having to make the decision to level up the ammo card or something else.
---
I, too, have noticed a sneak nerf. Every enemy seems to have higher perception now, not just Daily Ops robots with special mutations.
---
I personally think more stuff like this would have been a much better answer than a damage nerf.  We NEED more stuff like this.
---
Nope
---
So much shit not fixed and still no basic text chat but sure they have time to fix the ammo factory but not add anyway for us to sell our useless ammo to vendors I'm done with this shitty game
---
Level 65 here and pretty much same.  I played in the beta then finally bought the game for Wastelanders.  I'm a filthy casual and don't have an optimized build or weapons, was just starting to work on figuring out "good" builds/gear and then starting the grind to actually get them

 I had been just sticking with whatever decent gear I had and switching up based on what ammo I had on hand, but now  I am just burning through ammo.  I just recently started feeling like I could hang with higher level enemies so I can't imagine trying to fight through lower levels.  Previous to this path anything within a few levels of my own was a slog, but now that's all you see.
---
I think your assessment is spot on my friend. I couldn't of summed it up any better 🍻
---
Correct, explosives seems to have gotten a buff here - or maybe they just reverted the ridiculous over the top nerf. I think they may have reduced that second stack of explosive resistance every enemy had. Bloodied is still the top prefix despite everybody complaining about it
---
It’s only 90 perk points per 25 levels. I do agree tho as a higher level we are at a disadvantage because it takes more time to gain levels. I suppose one wasteland helped with the xp issue though. At level 355 I was able to rack up ~690 points which would really only let me update two perks. 
---
I understand that the legendary perks are suppose to be an end game grind, but as someone who plus a few hours or more every day I think that’s about as end game grind as I should have to do.
---
Relog and see if that helps! I find that relogging also solves mods not taking effect in Secret Service armor, perhaps this is the case as well? But so long as you have 8 actual points on Charisma WITHOUT the Legendary one equipped, you should be able to share a 2* card. relog, make sure you aren't already sharing something and see if it helps!
---
Personally mine is set to 2, mostly because i'm going for a stealth build. But your best combination would be Serendipity and Nerd Rage if your health goes low fast. If you are bloodied, and if you are willing to sacrifice special points you can go with Bolstering armor instead of Unyielding as the last one doesn't boost END. With legendary perks out already, you can also boost your endurance with Legendary Endurance perk.
---
Guess I’m going to a workshop to drop every atom shop thing I have
---
Luckily my camp is out of the way enough that nothing attacks my camp. It's on the East side on the road between New Gad and The Deep
---
It’s a lot easier for a card text to be wrong than it is for the mechanics to be wrong. 
---
Example:  [This is the link to the Fallout Wiki that explains this in detail](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME).
---
That’s labeled wrong. But the link works as intended. ;)
---
No prob bro, hope that at least answered your question somewhat. Have a great day!
---
Nice, I couldn't get under 8 solo.  I tried a few times and it was all between 8-9 minutes.  I lose a little bit on time on the 2nd site having to move away for a few seconds to kill enemies to bring fresh enemies in to proc vampire and didn't melt the final guy as fast as I needed to.
---
Don’t you still have 24 minutes to complete the event? Here I am the daily’s resets at 1800.
---
Great idea! Is adrenaline back to working now?
---
Shame nothing new for content. I can't keep running around doing same thing, to get bad rewards. I want to see repeatable dungeons, WoW style. Not whatever they did with vault 94
---
If a friend knows the plan they can just build it in your camp for you. It is not locked like an atom shop item
---
If anyone's curious, you can still be that power armor tank mowing everything down.
---
It was always like that for me. You just have to play hide and seek and find the vertibot on ground.
---
Sentry Bots and any legendary robot will explode after about 7 seconds after they've been killed. Any other non-legendary robot exploding without any audible whine, I've always considered that as a bug.
---
I didn't experience that myself last night. Only time bash failed for me was when robots slapped me with melee = interrupted my attack.
---
You got it my friend. Just added my BoS Bunker Review to my OP, with multiple pics of it. If there's a pic you want, just let me know👍🏼
---
I’m a casual player meaning I’m not optimizing my build to it’s fullest potential or keeping up with exploitable tricks or magic weapons. I just want to go murder some stuff, and once I’ve had my fill murdering it’s nice to retire back to the Forrest for a little RNR on uncle sam’s dime. 
---
Like I used to love running around and murdering things with my bloodied death claw gauntlet. I’d get in the mindset of a death claw and just rampage, but now that thing does 300 damage and I don’t feel like a death claw anymore. :(
---
Yeah, I thought the shooting gallery might boost AGI like the weight bench does STR. Oh well.
---
Yup.  I mean I prefer vampire's but bloodied does more damage.
---
I'm also complaining because I think the design decisions are just 1) dumb (a balance was needed, this all was probably one of the worst least player friendly ways to do it) and 2) not actually helping solve the issues the game has, just covering them up in a way that doesn't add to the fun quotient.    
---
Like I'm still playing the game and looking for what I should do with my character (though I really don't know) despite all that, but it's just so depressing to see shit like this be the solution they pick to the problems we have.
---
Hmmmm haven't have had that happen to me yet.
---
I will take note.
---
You too man, get well soon!
---
I had it on doing an ops with a squishy commando last night was pretty funny me blocking the door gandalf style whilst knifing any robot that got close as they popped away definitely helps out
---
So I just saw this post, applied super duper before crafting the SS chest piece with 3 legendary modules and got 4 chest pieces, 2 of them 3 star!  And one the 3 stars is Unyielding 😈
---
I think this is it. I've seen a few others posting about it on here. Folks who were used to being able to use stealth to choose when to fight or when to sneak/explore now have to fight a lot more. This isn't a good thing, it's forcing a different gameplay experience.
---
I did it yesterday and had 8 seconds left I nearly shit myself having to run up and punch that robot lol
---
Same here. I noticed a considerable increase to how much budget my caml was taking up, even though I hadn't changed or added anything or done any exploits. I'm guessing certain camp items just use up more budget now???
---
Oh sorry I forgot we all have the same guns, builds, legendary effects, aim, and enemies. No discrepancy between players and builds right
---
I think I’m going to also finally go back to my beta character and actually do something with them. They’re only level 10. My main when the game launched is now 325 and I did same. I scrapped all perk cards I had so I could max out ammo legendary perk then I got luck strength intelligence and perception legendary perks. Only other one I got was the sneak legendary perk. Ammo is maxed out and intelligence went up 3 ranks and luck went up 2 strength went up 1 or 2. But all those cards I scrapped and that’s all I could do. But I’m a bloodied stealth commando and just recently switched my build to this about 2 months ago when purveyor gave me my first bloodied fixer. I mean I still do damage but I might just finally build my other alts up. I have 4 alts and they’re all level two except beta one which is 10. And I can finally get that last achievement for siding with raiders lol
---
Yeah couple minutes of research lead me there, like I said I don’t test anything but the more you know...
---
Now tested an AA and bloodied lever as I don't have a bunch of spare Fixers. Until you get below 20%hp the AA is now doing slightly more damage but bloodied overtakes below 20% but it's not by a huge amount.
---
Craft a throwing knife and use that to finish them off
---
Liberty Prime has approved your post.
---
No, melee attack was required last night to kill the bots, so ranged players can use ranged weapons to drop a bots health but the player must strike the bot to kill it. I could drop those health but the game wouldn't allow me to bash, punch or attack them with my shishkabob. I could shoot it but that won't kill it. I could just stand there looking at it while it killed me.
---
I pray mine keeps going while I'm at work!
---
Level 50 enemies are hard?  Did I miss the memo?  Feels like a hot knife through butter, but that xp though.
---
I ran through it solo with my vamps bashing mini. Stuck the blades on the barrel for good measure. managed to finish it under 16mins. Was less annoying than I was expecting.
---
found both those plans in a player vendor.. gotta shop tell you drop lol
---
Woo, talk about last second lol
---
I have bird bones on and before when I jumped off the roof of my 2 story camp it would do the power slam. Now it doesn't? I've tried different servers, coming out of PA and still doesn't revert. I'm on PC, dunno if its maybe a bug?
---
Edit: it appears it still happens but the distance I have to fall from in order for it to happen is 4 story (camp height)
---
No worries. That’s what this sub is for. To gain and share information. 
---
*Unlike some traitorous scum I could mention, we seek to share the knowledge we... acquire to better* **all** *Americans.*
---
Man that sucks. What company? I thought Sprint (now merged with TMobile) was bad, but I get 3 lines for $147.5 a month for those 50 gb of hotspot data before throttle. My hotspot is not unlimited after throttle though, so I got to be careful, how about you?
---
If anything, ask a parent or sibling on your plan to share some of their data if they're not known for hitting the monthly limit.
---
Currently, or in the past, did you have any ammo factories built?
---
Maybe you should try a bloodied build. Maybe you wouldn't die so much.
---
Definitely dislike the scaling- I don't play for a challenge, but I guess Bethesda doesn't care
---
That's what I suggested. Increased damage and better crit damage
---
Bloodied commando here. It’s not that bad at all. Just a few extra bullets. A BE combat shotgun will still pop a head off a mutie with one shell. A BFFR plasma flamer still melts everything.
---
His rewards is trash, I think he gave me a few bottles of water and some ammo
---
I try and keep around 5-10% open for new things. But I also tend to put in things that if I have to delete, I don't mind. But that's me in real life. I switch up my home from time to time to make it fresh.
---
I mean... they did add a lot of content. Daily Ops, new settlements, legendary perks, tons of new CAMP items and weapon/armor skins in the Legendary run for free. If you wanna dungeon crawl "WoW stlyle" maybe go play WoW?
---
it does, thankfully. and I was closer to 8:01 so it doesn't care about milliseconds.
---
the resilient assaultron almost ruined it for me.
---
Thanks bro 🤜🏼🤛🏿
---
i only played for like 20 minutes, tomorrow and friday off! havent earned score in like a month lmao
---
Seriously whats wrong with you thinking you are allowed to spend your own money any way you please. The nerve of some people... /s
---
That's just weird lol.
---
Fallout 76 is the Dark Souls of Fallout MMOs
---
Ah, my bad friend, misread your post, thought I only saw the increase in critical
---
No electrical absorption is better than what rad with the added healing
---
I got crashed to the desktop. No warning, no errors, just the game was gone.
---
Daily ops and the new perk that heals you when you take energy attacks while in PA already make it a lot more popular, I've seen a lot more people using it.
---
Either the height you have to fall has been increased dramatically and/or it is a thing with bird bones. Never used to be able to jump off the roof of my camp without it happening, now it doesnt. (I'm on PC btw, so perhaps could be a bug)
---
It's a stupid bug due to the stupid limitations that are put on building mechanics. Most of the time if you get out of build mode then re-enter build mode, that bug is gonna stop for a bit.
---
Ammo, poison, maybe fire, but slightly less useful, EA in power armor, and specials.
---
No I didn’t
---
Np man
---
What about a 400+ damage bloodied explosive handmade build ??
---
That's nice. The timer seems to run for a few seconds after you get the kill, so at least it's a bit generous in that regard
---
You could always just use it if you need a lot more of it....
---
can't feel sorry for you.
---
It's funny, I've noticed things taking more shots to kill for my stealth commando, thought maybe it was time to try rifleman but looks like they are even worse.
---
I'm definitely using more ammo now but other than that it's not too bad. Feels like Ammo Factory is mandatory now though. Weird change, don't like it tbh but I can work through it at least to see all the story and quest content.
---
It's only a permanent mutation in the Uplink Daily Ops, just FYI.
---
I know he serves a purpose, but what, idk
---
I have a quad explosive single action revolver I used for low level areas and events, tried using it in the tea time event and had to pretty sharpish change my weapon because it was doing practically nothing to the creatures ☹ and we nearly lost the event.
---
Tea time used to be a cake walk, I could do that event with my eyes closed..not so much now...one wasteland has made simple events deadly affairs...honestly dreading radiation rumble lol
---
A recent post on this subreddit said throwing knives while having melee equiped does the trick. I'll edit once I find the post to give credit but that makes a huge difference if you don't want to move from the area to keep the timer going.
---
Yeah, I didn't have a great build or gear yet so I don't mind the nerf but the level scaling is a real turn off.  What even is the point of having levels if everything scales with you anyway?
---
Dodgy is agility.
---
yeah, im just going to tell you now, your build probably got fucked the most.
---
If you can, you should maybe invest in some heavy weapons, so you can spend 1 million rounds on a radroach cause that's the meta now.
---
I would recommend claiming the commie stuff just in case they ever allow us to get target dummies that we can put armor on. Then you can use them for enemy target practice. Or to dress your Ally in it and shoot them in the face if they give you quests or rewards you don't like. 
---
I'll have to use them whether I like it or not just to get this damn ghillie look off my scout and secret service armor sets. Lol.
---
Murdered stuff befire the patch, still murdering stuff after.
---
Casual player since Beta here.  All you need is a good gun.  I run with a QE Fixer and have no problem even after the nerf.  Need to fire a few more shots, but no big deal.
---
Yep. I am a melee build with high strength and perk cards and went from dealing 1200ish damage per hit to mid 400s. I need to do some more research but I've been getting my ass handed to me now and need to adjust.
---
Verizon. They fucking blow sometimes and are costly but the only company that actually has cell signal in the more backwoods-y places I frequent.
---
Got it in 6:15 yesterday with my two buddies, was very happy with that
---
Obviously there's still plenty of use for other things in the game. My solo runs for the op today were all with a vampire's explosive handmade. But it's just funny seeing people complaining about how bloodied is trash now as if they've never tried anything else
---
Take 3 points off something and invest legendary perk stat into the stat you decreased.
---
It’s the only way.
---
No casual play available in FO76 anymore
---
You get to choose from melee or commercial ammo production
---
I honestly don’t think it works , I’ve got It maxed and it seems to do nothing
---
They need to add repair kits that shit especially with the melee modifieres fucks up my gear.
---
We can all be heavies, it'll be great.
---
True,  but I've used up several perk points for food/water and always bought disease cures...now it's a one stop shop with survival shortcut, and I can drop some weight/ reassign points. Nice card.
---
Saw a fight between lvl 100 death claw and 100 scorched beast last night. Was very cool. They both lost to me though 😆
---
First Op yesterday, dealt with all the melee, got to the boss, get it halfway defeated, and the game crashes, BSOD (PS4). Out 20+ stimpaks and the cost of the melee weapon repairs. 
---
BGS, consistent as ever.
---
I'm going to have to agree with what some of Demon is saying, like weapon type + perks = success. I'm only level 13, but I stumbled onto a pretty good pistol and have the +20% damage increase from Gunslinger, and I'm still shredding things at my level. Maybe when I get to a higher level it won't shred anymore, but right now it is.
---
Yea I’m totally fine if they make an area that all projectile weapon would malfunction so that we have to fight a boss with melee, that’s acceptable approach. Let us bring robots’ hp down to near zero then require us to finish them off with a melee is just too forced drama.
---
Every patch there's always a rumor that turns out to be just that, a rumor. Keep your eyes open for proof but until then business as usual
---
I do have a BE handmade with a prime auto receiver. Hardly even notice a difference honestly. I mean, there *is* a slight difference. But not one that’s big enough to make me stop playing. Still fun for me.
---
Then maybe u/KoreaRiceBox hit it on the head.
---
I want target dummies too. But not for the same reason. The opposite actually. The Party will not be denied.
---
&gt; Did you always ignore completely the damage increasing perks and abilities in previous Fallout games? Dis you cry because you wasted too many bullets on a deathclaw in Fallout NV? No right? You sought the best weapons, gear to send them directly to hell. So why is it different in 76?
---
The why is simply answered.
---
Because the best weapon in this game got their possible damage cut and the mobs got a higher level. You just can not compare this.
---
But to call others to stop being casual is also not the solution. There are people who love this game but can't and wont spend more time.
---
And no, I am not one a complainer. Even though I lost about 80% (not 40% like Beth said) of my damage, I am still going strong. But only because I had enough cards stored to up several Lperks to max.
---
Anyways, this patch is good for the strong toons. My bloodied rifleman is now a bloodied Commando and Heavy gunner. Thanks to legacies, it can now melt everything even faster.
---
Nah thats fine, Im mainly just thinking loud here seeing if someone agrees or if what Im saying is to niche
---
Doesn't make a difference.
---
I don't have a legendary charisma perk, I just moved one from agility after getting legendary agility.
---
Water is free, killing brahmin takes two seconds, no chance of disease with carnivore.
---
Happened to me last season too. Used to be frustrating trying to do something like opening the map etc and have to press multiple time’s for it register because it’s too busy levelling up to 100 constantly
---
What's your plattform? If PC, maybe we can get you fitted with a decent weapon.
---
Yeah, I was surprised when I realised the roleplay team buff didn't allow.sharing either!
---
I hope it does too!! Funny story, took my console to work yesterday hoping to borrow the wifi to download quickly. Hooked it to a TV in the bar. Fucking tv wouldn't work right.
---
Capturing the munitions plant can be a hassle if already owned by another player. And it doesn't help the tedium of having to spend much more time to kill enemies that shouldn't be this tough to begin with. The game is more fun when the wilderness is populated mostly with easy-to-kill fodder. It makes running into Deathclaws or packs of Yao Guai much more nerve-wracking and exciting. Now, everything you encounter requires a fight of some degree and makes exploration more of a tedium than an experience.
---
OK so it probably isn't necessarily a patch 22 thing.
---
I had this happen. All my teammates that were 100+ did not have a single mutation once.
---
Agreed . Always sad when they limit us in our creativity. I play mainly for the camp building and each patch I die a little inside
---
Yeah, how's that ghoul slayers weapon working for you?
---
I hate using Power Armor, but end game, it's pretty much a requirement.
---
That would be amazing
---
I haven't noticed stealth being harder except obviously in the Ops where the enemies are tailor made to be antistealth. In the open world stuff I'm fine. Half the time I play in the stealth suit, the other time I just play in my regular armor with about 3 shadowed pieces. It doesn't feel too different than from before.
---
Enemies definitely take longer to kill and require more shots. I'm not a meta build tho, it took me about 9-11 shots from my handmade to kill a standard super mutant with body shots. With them silenced it's still pretty fast though and easy to keep stealth, just sucks about the extra ammo. Feels like a mats tax more than anything, Ammo Factory is a required perk to keep this up.
---
So annoying
---
Dont project your experience to others, its very ignorant
---
Thanks, but I’m Xbox lol
---
If your camp can't be placed and you stay on the server then you mess around with your items that are assigned to your vendors, that can cause it if I remember correctly
---
I don’t know what the hell this is, but I am not creating an account for something presented in a lazy, half-assed way like this without real explanation.
---
You’re supposed to bash or melee their final bit of health.
---
The rework in damage modifiers was necessary so they can make more predictable and smart balance changes. (Which means one is probably coming.)
---
If my options are cachung cachung cachung cachung cachung every step or just not play I’m probably just gonna shelf this game , after 2600 hours I’ve got my money’s worth
---
I love that now I have to think about how I’m going on enemies instead of running and gunning. Leveling up is easier now just doing everyday stuff. The added tension is awesome.
---
I personally use my T-60 all the time. Sure it’s no T-65 in terms of numbers, but I don’t need to sell my soul to buy the set and the mods for it. I don’t have any issues whatsoever with using my T-60 in daily ops or anything of the sort (end game bosses, daily grinds etc)
---
I did pretty much the same
---
The legendary card.  Google it.
---
That's what I might do yeah, it's not something I'll do right now though, I'm gonna invest in better perks first but when I run out of perks I'll buff my luck and respec luck into charisma I think.
---
if you're nearly overcumbered then its always best to just fast travel to the closest vendor so you can fast travel back to whatever you were doing before
---
I died about 50 times trying to figure out what was going on and if I could get around the robots to just not fight them. The game would just spawn them on top of me if I ran. I feel your pain. Run try to fast travel and one spawn in front and one behind and you can't kill them.  How I got out was I went AFK to write this post and died at least twice then it spawned me in AFK and the bots didn't spawn in next to me so I could get out.
---
I’m very pleased to put the foosball table and train set in my camp. Already cleared out room for them. The rest of the stuff is eh
---
Sch, sch, BOOOOOMMMM
---
I like to play non-meta builds all the time (I have an explosive-based character lol), so it's really slow going for me atm. I have a feeling that it will be a little rocky right off the bat, but once they get some data in on the new damage numbers, hopefully we will be seeing some buffs across the board for some weapon types. They have said these changes will make things easier to balance in the future, so let's hope that rings true, and things like explosive launcher weapons and pistols will get some love in the near future.
---
They're all synths. They all say the same three things and wear the same four outfits. It's creepy.
---
I feel like even if it's only +10-15 damage, it's still better than not having it at all. Any added damage is good.
---
Exactly, there are tons of perk points in the Season
---
You have to.melee them for them to die. That's today's mutation.
---
Dont worry. All us melee players will cry when the freezing mutation comes around.
---
Seasons help a lot.
---
It works for me. The first shot is always normal and then every shot there after gets the bonus.
---
Not sure how it works for the shotgun since it shoots more then one bullet.
---
It’s 50 coins to rank a card. So if you dump coins into ranking a card, you’re not getting those back if you unequip it. So say if you put 200 coins into What Rads. You lost 200 coins if you unequip and don’t use it anymore.
---
No problem. Be sure to read the daily ops screen on the map to see what the enemies and mutations are so you don’t go in confused for the next one.
---
I tweaked a little bit on my build yesterday and plan on running 2 or 3 special boosting legendairy perks to further enhance it, Im not getting totally messed up so Ill think Ill manage, but I am putting alot of hope on a damage buff some time in the future
---
Somehow I only notice when it's the supers.
---
My character that always use PA has that double fusion core perk because hes energy weapons heavy gunner and I am always full of fusion cores. Plasma not so much except for ultracite ones. But it would be more useful if I get a vampire gatling laser.
---
I don't sorry on PC and when I'm getting 80 fps and great ping my regular lmg are slightly magic on public servers (based on behemoth bullets to kill) in power armor vs with 15% block piece on
---
Yeah it does make the usual events a little more difficult... but why don’t they just start scrapping the usual events like “leader of the pack” “manhunt” “swarm of suitors “ and start making new ones?
---
I’ve always been a fan of fireproof so I would have said 3, however if you’re into melee you’ll like having a point for radicool, and also 2 points in revenant is useful...so my new answer is 6.....
---
All paid for by a legendary perk though - I couldn’t justify more than 3 previously
---
It gives me something to do in the game, which is nice. I enjoy playing the game, but launching a nuke at earl or the SBQ and killing it over and over gets tedious if that is all you do. I realistically only want like 3-4 things from the season, but I also just enjoy making “progress” on something
---
My mirelurk king, Elvis went from 30 to 60
---
Something tells me youre not a nocturnal build 🧐
---
But what are these "rewards" you speak of? Nothing has changed. All of the loot in the game is the same, there are no new areas, etc. It's just the same enemies who are giving you the same stuff. 
---
I guess if this is how you want the game, then this is how you want the game. There's no "wrong" answer. The game is harder now, that's definitely true. If you prefer that, then so be it. I would just prefer to play a game where there are certain places/points at which I can have access to that higher level of difficulty if I want it rather than it being EVERYWHERE, and for no real tangible reward. It's just tougher combat for the sake of tougher combat. No one is saying they want to "play cod on the easiest difficulty." That's a pointless exaggeration. All I'm saying is there are ways to add difficulty to a game and to just blanket make everything in the game more difficult is a lazy way of doing it plus you're alienating everyone who plays the game that doesn't want much tougher fights CONSTANTLY. 
---
I enjoyed being able to go to certain areas and scavenge, claim workshops, etc without feeling necessary to ALWAYS be stocked up on ammo, stimpacks, etc. Having every fight feel like a high level fight is, to me, not enjoyable in a game like this. But I guess for people who care about combat and nothing else, it's great. They're certainly not required to cater to me and if this is how it stays, then I'll just move on and play something else. Plenty of choices out there.
---
yeah, if they added more ways to get perk coins instead of just scrapping your perks. it would go a long way. similar to how they added more ways to get gold bullion with the score system
---
Why do they need to scrap them? They can add new ones without scrapping them.
---
My best one is 7:42
---
GG bro
---
I still don't get why they didn't just address bloodied, and the the general low health perks and mutation meta.  It just needed to be tweaked down.  Do that, buff up the useless weapons, actually fix magic weapons and other exploits and not only is everyone basically happy, but there would be new things for people to try out in newly buffed weapons.    
---
 I also don't get why any time I say that I get downvoted.
---
Guess it depends on what level you are, today.  But for each maxed out special card, you're only gaining 5 card slots (or not gaining 10 perk coins through scrapping).  Its not trivial but, if you're chasing the legendary run, you'd earn 18 coins in 5 days (5 levels plus perk card pack).  So it'll take a bit longer than using the imo weak other legendary options, but well worth it.
---
Right? I found steel scrap in someone's vending machine for 1c a piece and I had to pick it up cause I was almost at cap limit.
---
The changes they made are fine for anyone running a properly geared build that's some combination of PA/heavy/bloodied/junkie's.
---
They're not fine for everyone else.
---
Two seconds every time I come across a safe adds up
---
I had six slots, so plenty of room for other cards...the explosive ones seem silly to me. Which ones did u choose?
---
Nah its good
---
I'm only counting 9,027. Get your facts straight!
---
Because my melee is trash so its easier to charge while shooting soi can bash than sit there for 20 minutes stabbing a robot
---
Exactly where your stealth perks are then...
---
I feel like it's been that way for a while.  I've been debating just dropping stealth for some time.
---
Hahaha! I did this too when I first started. I was constantly over encumbered and I couldn't figure out why. Then I noticed I had 5000 gunpowder and it weighed A LOT! I was so happy to have that weight back! Then I started collecting legendary weapons and armor....
---
It’s the ppl that want to get ammo back. I personally am the only one on my team yesterday that put my gun away and just killed them with melee and mind you I’m bloodied so I barely have any health and still didn’t care
---
I use a full set of T-60 or T-45 just because I prefer the look of them. I’ve not had any problems taking on the tougher enemies or the end game bosses.
---
Actually am lol.
---
Done some testing, one VAT shot, one normal shot waited 4 seconds between each; 
---
Out of 10 scorched, 2 increased their health above where the VATS shot left it, following the normal shot . 3 out of 7 Gutsys did the same.  And when I say higher I am talking significantly, VAT shot to below 25%, none VAT shot takes the health (of the same foe) back up to 95%. 
---
I would say it’s not just aesthetic.
---
I'd have no problem with this.
---
No sadly, I only have a T-51B set because I’ve got the nuka cola paint and I’m gonna put it on the power armor stands when they come soon. Same with my X-01 quantum paint set. 
---
I rarely even see low levels playing with PA so lower level sets may not really be worth it unless it’s an alt with access to a lot of FCs and mods and stuff for it. I know I never made any other sets.
---
- edit - Oh AND because excavator exists. Excavator having the inherent weight increase is great for low levels.
---
My stealth build is a no go for the Ops. Will have to tweak it but I'm only lvl 75 so it'll take a while to get some alternate perks.
---
Otherwise the open world stuff is fine. Stuff takes longer to kill but the game doesn't feel harder... more like a mats tax, just gotta craft more ammo. Something that took a burst of 2-3 bullets now might take upwards to 10. Still maintain stealth and don't use extra meds or stims but ammo on the otherhand...
---
I just wish some of the smaller vermin and animals weren't also scaled. Lvl 50 baby radstags that take 10 shots from my 10mm submachine gun? lol com'on
---
10 shots to kill a wolf? what weapon are you using?
---
Best thing to do is play people, the game is harder solo now the new daily ops require a team for high chance of rewards
---
wait, i read it wrong, you're a stealth COMMANDO?
---
WHY?
---
Turrets in camp now scale to your level. Put one or two down and watch that floater get popped.
---
preach brother, amen!
---
Haha damn, then you have nothing but respect from me, keep murdering!
---
Much easier to post a complaint on Reddit.
---
It is like that most of the time when I go to it even before this patch. Have to turn up the volume and listen for the sound of the vertibird, then go find it on the ground.
---
Yeah man, I don't get why people can't understand that more tedious doesn't equal more difficult.
---
Seems like almost everyone is upset about not being able to 1 hit trash mobs in low lvl area's anymore, but personally i kind of like the fact that now i can go to any area and any event and have all combat in the game actuall require my attention/engagement instead of just pointlessly mowing down everything in my path with absolutely no threat/risk.
---
I don’t mind the harder baddies or dying more often, I’ll be overhauling my build over the next few weeks.  What I mind the most is the wear on my weapons and armor.  I have weapon artisan and fix it good and my equipment is still breaking very quickly after not much gameplay.  Any ideas?
---
From what I understand the explosive legendary effect was unchanged so it's a "bigger" buff now, which makes BE stuff even better. Two Shot might be the same but I'm not for sure.
---
And I've lost my TSE handmade apparently so was unable to compare with bloodied myself, going off other people there.
---
Stop being casual  guys
---
Weird that fake gambling is a problem, but actual gambling with lootboxes isn't.
---
I had this theory about using a Vampire's Buzz Blade in the Resilient op.
---
Unlike other melee weapons, you could just keep it held out as you run around with it, which would make it a lot easier to finish off 1 HP enemies that are weakened by someone else.
---
I like being able to scrap unused perks.  I really need to take some time and go through them all
---
I liked being a god among mobs...get tickled damage wise to return the favor by turning them Inyo thick red paste...now I get the shit beat outta me :( good change of pace tho!
---
I’d say.
---
Me as well cheers!!
---
On a side note, seasons gives around 50 cards, it's a little boost.
---
But I really don't think this should be taken as a grind at all. It's a very long term goal, things happen when they happen.
---
If you are on xbox i can build it for you as thats the first daily ops item i unlocked.
---
Another thing that doesn’t make sense with PA are diseases like how the hell am I getting rad worms wearing a tank suit???
---
I thought bloodied builds die all the time?
---
Or aiming at ennemies. Why is it it the middle of the screen?
---
I was in a group that almost failed Tea Time, of all things. Rad Rats, Ticks, and Mongrels taking up my whole AP bar for each one where this was an event I’d just casually plink away everything with 1-2 shots each using VATS. 
---
Had to swap from Rifleman to Commando and after just one evening have ripped through all my ammo. While I get this makes for more of a challenge, it seems more like it just made everything more of a bullet sponge, and I may need to stop giving away free ammo and so many stims to low levels. A high-powered rifle round to the face of a human or dog shouldn’t just cause a stagger.
---
 It's dangerous to go alone. It's dangerous to go in groups. It's just dangerous out there, so stock up here.
---
Yes it should lol. You can die instantly as that build. High risk high reward
---
That’s been a bug for awhile
---
Not sure, maybe it's your build. I played ESO prior to one tamriel and hated it, came back after they introduced it and played around 600 hours. Only had trouble on a few bosses when I was a higher level but eventually got past 'em. I don't think I had the trouble you did because I started fresh after one tamriel and my build was made accordingly in the new system. Zero issues with it. 
---
In 76 I am using my same bloodied melee build and having no issues taking down enemies like some report. The only thing I have noticed post patch is my character dies a lot easier which can be frustrating but no issues with damage output.
---
do you know if it's like power user, and works on all cores, or just in power armor? (i dont use PA, but do lug a gat plas)
---
Well you received the pails or could buy them and had to craft them with the base pail you received to get the reward
---
Yeah the update just hasn’t been the greatest. For 20 GB (for me that is) not a whole lot was added to justify the update. Yeah season 2 was released and it’s cool, but was it worth the update? Daily ops are alright, but honestly something similar should’ve been in the game at the very start. And what I don’t get is instead of figuring out how to solve the hacked weapon problem they decide to nerf all the legit players. They also promised the start to the new BoS quest line, but then walked back on their promise (if you consider it being on the one wasteland promotional material as a promise or not). Overall, I don’t see this update justifying all the hype and the size of the update all that well.
---
I agree, but like I said last night I think you're going to find plenty of people here who disagree with you. Plenty of people here are consumed with combat and want every fight to be really tough I guess. This isn't even talking about how every fight is now tougher and there are no real different tangible rewards to go along with it. Everything is just a bullet/stimpack sponge now. That's all that's changed. 
---
This may satisfy the hardest of hardcore players who want never ending difficult combat but for anyone even resembling a casual player.....I just don't see how this is fun. I play a game like this for combat to an extent but in general to me, Fallout is a game to explore the world, scavenge, and just kind of do quests/complete challenges at my leisure and when I want that big time challenge, I know where to go for it. Now, it's everywhere. Just not for me.
---
Actualy there is a way to spot the ones that have 1hp left, they have an red-orange glow and they don't take damage when you're shooting them.
---
It's working, but it doesn't show correctly in the Pip-Boy.
---
Reload the game, and look at your effects. It will look like Class Freak isn't doing anything, but if you look at your SPECIAL, it will be correct.
---
This was happening to me last night every time I gained a level, it would go through each rank. I heard it happened last season to people but I never experienced it then.
---
Same, just dying more lol
---
I think it’s just the fusion core in power armor
---
Ok.  I’ll pay attention to the drops more today lol.   I’m bleeding unwanted scrip, overweight, maxed out on all forms of currency....I’m not even caring anymore what legendaries drop.  Thanks for the info!
---
Okay, just correcting a slight error.  It's not my fault.
---
there should be no need to nerf Bloodied the correct solution would be to make other builds not dogshit. now you almost need Bloodied to not waste 20x times the ammo
---
bolt rifles are worse than pistols now. even a gauss is barely tickling enemies and takes several shots to kill.
---
Thank you for this.
---
Damage output, using a furious fixer so semi fire would take longer to get the damage up, before patch I could one shot trash mobs and use around 20 bullets to kill a scorchbeast (if my aim didnt potato completely on me)
---
What error was that?
---
99% of games release in a finished and largely bug-free state. Not two years later after X number of patches and after charging $X for microtransactions and subscriptions. What's Bethesda's excuse? Why do they get this free pass?
---
I don't think Bethesda deserves praise for releasing a $60 beta and then trying to turn it into a finished product over time.
---
Yes, or let it break it down into it's constituent components. Picking it up at this point is a liability if you're not equally stocked up on lead.
---
I havent tried it but now I'm considering it if it works
---
Right? So either the Institute was founded before we thought or they are using time travel... lol
---
Explosives are still multiplicative, is why.
---
How would food spoil 200% slower? It’s like the foods condition getting better while it’s in the fridge. 😂
---
It should be like the luck perk that reduces spoil time by 90%.
---
The ammo box you mentioned would be amazing to have. I have so much ammo and that would be very helpful. 50% to 90% would be very good. No weight on ammo is not a good idea.
---
Unarmed melee here.
---
Full set of SS armor and a friend with a full set of SS also we both have What Rads at max rank and we can waltz around nukezones now.
---
In not saying the loot had changed im saying you get more level appropriate loot. Nothing worse for a low level to kill something that's reasonably hard use loads of ammo and stimpaks to get a weapon or piece of armour 20 level about your level. I image its the same the other way round, nothing worse for a high level to kill something that uses lot of ammo to get rewarded a level 5 pipe pistol. I'm not saying it all perfect, but I'm struggling to see how level appropriate loot isn't a good thing.
---
I love the new challenge they have given the game. I’m bloodied build, as a ton of people are as well.
---
I’ve been experimenting with vampires stuff now as a bloodied build and it’s really fun actually.
---
My recommendation to anyone that’s pissed about the game: try new stuff. Get out of your comfort zone. And have fun.
---
they were just better versions of normal guns/melee weapons
---
I like the caps for buffs idea
---
You could play and find out! Raids have been gone. There are new daily ops and colossal problem is fun imo
---
that's nice for newer characters.
---
Logging out isn't a guaranteed solution.
---
They are somewhat comparable if you're in the low health mode to begin with, although Bloodied is still king.  Running full health with AAE isn't comparable to Bloodied.
---
I have an AAE Handmade and a B/50 Handmade.  I suppose it's not inconceivable that the former may overtake the latter if I invested in max Demolition Expert, but that's pretty expensive for a SPECIAL stat I don't generally need.
---
Yes it scales on a 1:1 basis. This update changes exactly what you are stating. It used to be that a low level 25 player would happen upon a level 65 glowing one because a level 240 player had just been there. Now, that ghoul may still be a glowing one, but it will be scaled down to level 25 and be a bit easier to kill for the low level. The high level player, if he were still there, would see the same ghoul, but he see it as a much higher level, probably 100.
---
If you want to complete those challenges for atoms, best bet imo would be to just make a new toon with a new build and work on it that way. With legendary perks available for new players (if you have hit at least level 50 with another toon) and everything else, I feel they WANT people to start making new characters and experimenting more.
---
Hmmm... yeah, sorry man... they might have changed something there. Not sure what to tell ya, it still works for a lot of things but I can't speak to that one.
---
This actually brings up a interesting question.
---
Does Bethesda understand this as well that people don't understand they are separate teams and want to revive the reputation of their company since everyone at bethesda is being held responsible?
---
Maybe McMacHack is onto something.
---
Generals steakhouse upstairs is one.
---
Nice one! GGs
---
Of course they do. Just not 50 times a session.
---
My melee build has been hosed by this update.  I will have to come up with something else I guess or cancel Fallout 1st ;P
---
That’s a hilarious image. 
---
*Mr. Handy Blade go brrrrr*
---
Exactly. It's like you're playing tabletop D&amp;D and goblins and zombies keep leveling up with you. How does that even make a lick of sense, much less remain engaging? Part of the point is graduating to new enemies.
---
That is impressive!! I'd be on here bragging about it if I was you xD
---
anyone got a pic?
---
That’s really sad if they took away his personality. :(
---
It’s been around a month since I’ve last played. Never got to play a vault raid that’s why I’m asking.
---
I have a stealth rifleman and a heavy gunner, both perform well. Tons of people are loving it. But be wrong if you wanna, sorry if the game making you actually put in effort is a bummer for you
---
Even ghouls and mirelurks explode, robots go kaboom is expected.
---
When i got to the event boss i literally yelled out "Holy machine gun hands!" and had a flashback to the end boss from the original wolfenstien game.  I'm loving the daily op and cant wait for the refresh.  Took 5 tries and some team help to get Elder rank.  Solo is definitely tough. Thank you Beth for the new challenge.
---
Loved that in Fallout New vegas. When you had a certain amount of Strength points you would just crush smaller insect enemies when walking over them without them putting up much of a fight.
---
The issue is more that Bethesda decided making enemies bullet sponges was easier than adding content or fixing actual broken issues in the game.  I know this update is polarizing, but many dislike it because of what it signals (that Bethesda likely has little plan for more large content updates like wastelanders and is merely trying to get a return on FO76 before it dies as an idea that was good, but just not executed well.
---
Bethesda should be fixing the game, not doing minimal work to maximize the mileage they get out of it.
---
I’m thinking they have a plan to add a raid type thing to vault 51 since they made that area a no camp zone and said that they plan on doing something with it for future content.
---
you need to do like 1% damage to him
---
Yes, for cost effectiveness and DR.  The T-51 is one of the best sets in the game in terms of ease of use in obtaining, and repairing.  The one downside is the lower rad resist.   I’ll mix and match pieces of T60 to give me some more resist.  Works well.  
---
There are several guides detailing the + and - of them.
---
(And as far as I’ve read, this type of build out competes Ultracite).
---
Ok I heard back on this. Creatures in NW should *not* have changed difficulty with the One Wasteland changes, so we're going to investigate and address this. Thanks to all for the reports and /u/Mo0kish for the thread!
---
There can only be one.
---
"Should change their stealth perks cards out for dodgy, evasive, and ricochet in luck." It makes it sound like they're all in luck.  Not a huge deal though.
---
No it shouldn't.
---
My thought too. I didn’t think this was seriously obtainable... just something else to work on in the background.
---
I've been playing for a long time but I am decidedly low level.
---
I've noticed at the core of the posts here by high level players are very specific things for OP players. 
---
I've also noticed dedicated high level players are down to grind and will meet crazy expectations - if there were a challenge where you had to do a double back flip in the last blockbuster video store in north america, there would be at least 10 folks completing it within 3 days of announcement and one guy who managed to do it 10 times when it was PTS only. 
---
So, the thing I can't seem to understand is the dissatisfied players who have been essentially given more game to play. The ceilings been raised, there is more to achieve, more to do. It's human nature to keep wanting more. 
---
I mean, I get it, but I really don't - ESP if the player is the type who has a mountain of materials to make ammo, a mountain of perks and unredeemed points to flip into legendary perks. I can't tell if the gripes are real or if the gripes are related to not being top dog anymore. 
---
I think I'm just weird in that way. I'm only LVL 65 and still very much into the game but also finding that I miss the constant sense of danger where simply wandering into an unknown area was instant death.
---
Asstron is nearly unbeatable in less than 10 minutes solo
---
Hoping it is solved, but I guess we should find out soon enough.
---
Honestly we were just happy to get paladin on it because it really was difficult. Whether it’s completed in 7:59 or 6:15 the end result is the same
---
I don't think so.
---
Compared to other perks, it's negligible.
---
Oh really? Well that's good news! Have any of the other ops been on the PTS? Or did Bethesda confirm it's only permanent to Uplink?
---
it's gonna take me a few days of leveling up to grab dodgy and ricochet but I'm gonna try this.
---
Yeah, I maxed ammo converter. Added 3 agi. Poison would be nice, but I dont commonly encounter it, so could swap it in. I'm thinking about the electric one since turtle showed it to be OP, but I think that one is bugged. I mean actually gaining health with an assaultron blasting you?!
---
Plus finding a prime reciever for it isnt essy. Ive been looking.
---
I noticed that too. He'll probably show up later
---
Was hoping my damage wouldn’t have been cut this drastically, I accepted it was happening and needed to happen but my damage is 25% of what it was. My build isn’t perfectly optimized with armor, need more ap refresh and strength drops, but it’s almost as if the bloodied build isn’t even viable anymore
---
I don't know if it's just me but I feel like stealth isn't working as well as it was in general before this update. I'm always getting detected and put in danger when before this update I was always well hidden. I have all the necessary perks and a stealth suit but I'm gonna switch to a bloodied build and try that out.
---
One of my arguments for the damage change is pre patch I did a run of West Tek during the day with a nocturnal hunting rifle and killed everything in one or two shots. 
---
I honestly recommend having a nocturnal weapon as an extra as they do great damage at night without all the hassle of addictions etc. The whole build with night eyes etc is a niche thing but I like trying out all the random perks that mostly get ignored.
---
Okay, so you know it heals you as well, right?
---
So it’s not like last season?? Ok thanks.
---
If you got Elder, you get rare rewards I got Paladin and it didn't give me any rares
---
well i guess its time for you to look for new game they wont fix it anytime soon
---
Sometimes downed robots also continue animating, with either electrical sparks, or Mr. Gutsys'  jets staying lit, but that seems to be just a visual bug, not an indication of anything.  &lt;sigh&gt;
---
I wish someone would answer this.
---
YES
---
I have 2 points into end, lol
---
Stealth build trying ops?
---
Bethesda claims the health is on purpose.
---
Not a bad idea. I hate power armor though. I miiiight consider using it now though, after hearing that the healing effect of Electric absorption is actually an intended effect.
---
Can tank a lot of damage lol
---
Sorry right, meant elder
---
Oh no doubt. I like the way they are designed.
---
Bingo.
---
I'm a bloodied PA heavy and I could definitely solo the Daily Ops yesterday. Though having to bash the enemies to kill them was just the worst. I had to take off dodgy cause I didn't have enough AP to bash the bots.
---
lol people really hate the commie stuff but that red color scheme is really nice.
---
I have a VATS Stealth UA build.
---
Something more fun and useful is better, in my opinion, and Luck has a lot of those cards in it.  All of the flat damage perks are underwhelming now.  There was, like, a whole 15 damage points of difference between all three Rank 1 Commandos and all nine Rank 3 Commandos for me.  It's silly.  Not worth the extra 6 SPECIAL at all.
---
I happen to like watoga underground.. and the deep would be another excellent location.
---
Just my anecdotal evidence, but it always makes me feel better if others are going through the same thing. Then I know I’m not the crazy one. Take care
---
Yeah, same, its different and all about speed and overcoming new challenges
---
That was the other modifier I believe.  Perceptive.  If it's like resilient, it will change with the op and stealth will work again.
---
Who knows, maybe there will be an op that punishes you for being detected in some way.
---
Whos the real coward? The one who will personally ask you why youre a PoS or the guy too afraid to reply? Hmmmm
---
It looks like these are currently changing at 1pm ET (about one hour from this comment.) We are looking into adjusting this timing going forward so that Daily Ops will change one hour earlier (at 12pm ET each day) to be in line with other aspects of the game that change regularly (Challenges, Atomic Shop updates, Double XP Event start/end times, etc.)
---
I did this exactly I just stood by the uplinks I from od all the bots tanking damage (I have 4 pieces but it’s a set of solar armor so I was getting heals too) .. I plan on doing the same with super mutants.
---
I wouldn't call it rap, more like a chant maybe
---
I’ve changed my camp a bunch of times. Every time I feel bad but like the new one more and more. I wish we could have multiple camps and just select which one we want each time we play
---
Can the botherhood field station fit under a power pylon?
---
it also doesn't remove mutations (at least in my test), so if you go make a alt you can pick up some and let the passive removal keep your rads down as well.
---
Colossal Problem is great-it’s a nice alternative to the SBQ and less players, which can be a good or bad thing (depending on who you have in your instance). The rewards are okay but neat nonetheless.
---
The Vault 94 raid is still off the table, but you can actually go in and explore in Adventure mode now. Daily ops seems to be the focus now-they seem to be much more stable than the raids were at the moment.
---

---
Ya in the patch notes they modified class freak. They may have inadvertently did something they didn’t mean to.
---
Didnt see that. Thx. That may be one I'll use especially after a painful solo of yesterday's daily op.
---
This update sucks.  I can no longer hit up the places to get lead for ammo, I have to fight 50+ level creatures now.  Plus, there is no fear of the unknown areas anymore.  It's all the same.  It's like giving all the kids participation trophies.
---
But that's also part of my point....yes it's "level appropriate" loot, but is it really DIFFERENT loot than what you've already been getting when you were in the high level areas before? You get more of it now, sure. But it's still all the same stuff over and over. It's not like they added a large amount of new weapons, armor, etc to go along with the fact that now you're fighting high level stuff everywhere instead of just certain parts of the map. 
---
It just feels like such a basic way to satisfy a complaint by X% of people (and again, I find it very hard to believe the majority of people playing this game wanted this,) that there isn't enough difficult combat. As I said before, that complaint should be addressed. Absolutely. For people who want tougher combat, there should be updates done to add that in as the game goes along. But to just do a blanket update and up the levels for everything without changing ANYTHING else....I just don't see what problem that solves. Plus it creates the problem of the people who don't want that being frustrated that now everything they fight takes a hell of a lot more bullets/stimpacks to kill than it did before where those people knew if they wanted a challenge, they went to X or Y location. If you like the change, then that's fine. But me personally, it's just not a game I started playing with the desire/expectation to have difficult combat everywhere.
---
Angry turtle on YouTube. He tells you all the legendary prefixes that are affected
---
That daily op in particular really was anti sneak as well so everyone was suiting up to at least nab up the 45% DR. Future ops will be more sneak friendly so PA wont be used as much.
---
Also I believe that legendary perk is bugged and that's why its healing as its description does not mention it should do that, I expect a fix for that.
---
Several levels ago I could not get my weight down to save my life. I pulled everything out except for aids. I had a random 50 (?) I couldnt seem to drop. 
---
Stimpaks are 1, supers are 1.5...how even...
---
I haven't done any daily ops yet cause it just updated for me, would you say it's fun/good?
---
I have 1 END.  Lol.  So many ways to mitigate damage through other perks.  Being a stealth build it just isn’t necessary.  Even when I switch to my hybrid shotgun/rifle, I still have 1 point in it.  Why?  Because we just don’t have enough special lol.
---
I only have one and I haven't had a problem
---
The full sets I was taking almost no damage. It’s the same set I use for the imposter
---
It switched at 10 AM PST/1PM EST yesterday.
---
No idea why it's not an hour earlier like the Daily/Weekly Challenges are.  Maybe they aren't accounting for Daylight Savings or something.
---
My bloodied build feels just as powerful as before.
---
You know that trailer with the safes just SE of Tyler?
---
A pack of vicious, level 50 mole rats ganged up on me and gnawed my face off before I could stop them. I felt like the school bully in a superhero origins movie who gets thrashed in the 'just got my new powers' scene. 
---
How did this all go so wrong? My AAE pipe revolver used to mow them down like weeds. Now it's a dinner bell.
---
I didn't die once.
---
Wait... it heals you?! Sh.t... I promise not to quickly read things late at night. I gotta read them all again carefully this time. If it heals it is a MUST for that character. Thanks!
---
 I know, look at me sounding all entitled... I'm what's wrong with the world today 😂😂
---
I really like it. People are saying it's way more difficult but it's really not that hard, just the same as before, I just get more xp from scrub enemies. And that legendary ammunition perk card is a godsend
---
Yeah deffo, all in all ESO is just not for me, tried making my own build and tried guides but nothing really clicked, tried it again now with greymore but I find the quests and grind so tedious, ESO has alot of content but I find it to be a quantity over quality, which probably sounds stupid considering how much I enjoy fallout 76, cant explain why but 76 hit my vibe just about right every time 
---
But backing up a lil, ESO combat is fine, last I played I used like 5 attacks and then most trash mobs would die (maybe more maybe less hits I honestly dont remember but cant be far off, Im a tank and also use sword and shield skills alot which are not dps anyway) and thats fine, but when a vampire fighter and a mudcrab takes the same amount of hits something just feels shitty, its like getting invested in a game and finding something breaking the immersion kinda 
---
Im not sure since Im no bloody build, but I would assume bloodied players have an easier transition into this patch instead of other types of builds. I am using a furious fixer, the damage there was never amazing, and now it is simply worse, it still gets the job done but I think overall I spend between 5-10 more bullets on certain tankier enemies and if theres several of them, reloading between each kill feels pretty shit
---
Sorry for lenghty rambling!
---
Edit: spelling and 5-10 bullets**
---
Cant have everything in life. Play what your dealt. I mean we just got a huge update that's significantly improved the game for just about everyone, come on now.
---
It... doesn't say it on the card.
---
Yeah, and for it to work it has to be something I can’t get as a drop, which is why chems don’t really work.  Otherwise I could happily buy things like Fury or Overdrive to get some extra damage in, especially with the changes to damage.

A great buff would be to emulate a legendary effect for a period of time - for X amount of caps get time where all your weapons having Vampires or Furious, on top of normal legendary effects.  It’s easier to balance and can easily be a great way to drain tons of caps out of the economy, as people try some amazing Bloodied/Junkies weapons.
---
Stop using exploits.
---
At L244, Excavator is still my goto PA.   Provides suficient protection for my needs, quite durable, and relatively cheap to repair.
---
One of my regular teammates (L235) always uses T51 (cheap to repair), and another prefers X01 (L240).
---
I really think that is super cool, Im not really into bloodied or junkies as Im thinking «what would Ive liked to have if I was in the wasteland» no mutations, full health and furious for me thanks, hah
---
The first one I joined, I was late. By they time I got through the tunnels to the end, the other people on my team had already dispatched the boss. And they did it in about 7:30, so I rode their coattails to Elder status. 
---
That didn’t sit right with me so I found more people to run it with and pushed through to help as many people finish it as possible. I think I ended up with four Elder runs and two Paladin or Initiate runs.  
---
There was the one that took 22 minutes because I forgot to repair my shotguns and had to rely on a backup weapon, but we’ll move past that one I think.
---
Wow, that sounds great about the ammo. I haven't had a chance to check out the legendary perk system yet.
---
Now you’re talking :)
---
If you don't see the vertibird flying around but the event is still active it means it has landed somewhere. Just need to figure out where and destroy it on the ground. There is a red rocket station that's a common place to find it if it's in the event radius. There is another place I've found it as well, but the location is eluding me at the moment...
---
All daily ops are anti sneak (they all have piercing gaze) and Valseek confirmed the PA heal to be an intended feature. Daily ops against mutants and robots are much easier to do in PA as well, since those mobs can deal out a lot of damage, fast.
---
Don’t complain when a new dupe pops up.
---
Thing is if you have a bunch of alts you play with, you have to chose which character to redeem them on or to spread them. It would be nice if there was a way to earn them per character.
---
Maybe if we could spend gold bullion for example on perk card packs or coins directly.
---
It is somewhat noticeable against bosses.  
---
I typically use excavator for the carry weight as it's basically fine for general defensive purposes, and I can run colossal, scorched, and encryptid well enough in it, but running with my t65 or strangler heart gives me more breathing room, and I find myself needing to heal less.  But this is of course, the higher end of the damage range.
---
Radiation in a nuke zone shows similar effects, though with what rads, this is now a moot point for me.  Environmental and food radiation (haven't check emmet mountain yet) does nothing to me, in fact, with ghoulish it heals me.
---
yeah the legendary attribute perks add to your points, up to 15 total.
---
It won’t really change until you get a god true weapon as perks now do almost nothing for damage.
---
This happened to me. I’m next to crater. I’m 100+ and drawing a lot of aggro from distant lvl 50 super mutants.
---
Reading the wikia, lazer turrets have greater distance than rocket turners and 2nd level machine gun? Gonna test this out. But if anyone knows would greatly appreciate
---
Yes, the points you add will let you equip more cards, but it maxes out at 15.
---
I haven’t played or read patch notes in two weeks and was a little surprised I wasn’t one slashing enemies RIP
---
Lol. Ok thanks
---
Have you done the new quest in Watoga? You probably should, if the BoS matters to you.
---
And from limited playtime last night, it seems like health rubberbanding has either stopped or decreased significantly and I didnt have any issues fast traveling.
---
And as far as some initial reporting goes SOME magic effects have been nerf'd.
---
Even if one wasteland hurts like a mofo to your dps, its still a pretty great patch so far.
---
Yea my bloodied ranged weapons took a 40% nerf meanwhile all enemies are 50+ levels now. The pace is different because each enemy takes longer to kill. On the brighter side Ammo Factory is great in compensating the ammo usage.
---
totally agreed. i was unsure if i should try the daily op overall bc im a bloody commando and its not my dream to have to bash dam gustys. public team leader started it and i thought, why not. it was really fun and we worked quite good as a team with no communication. took us 14 minutes but it was a blast. also, im glad that i still down something :D my shitty 2* b33 hm does 170 dam now but its ok, i rather have to take 4 to 5 shoots for a lvl100 super mutant than one shooting everything.  
---
-&gt; awesome update!
---
Electric Absorption
---
Is this confirmed? So you are saying if I spend 300 coins to level up a card, unequip it (for i assume 1 coin)  but then later decide to reequip i will not have a level 4 card but instead a level 1 card? That makes no sense. I would assume the card level remains even if I unequip it.
---
Yup, cloudys is the best. One button to turn off mods.
---
I think we are both missing the other persons point, and that’s ok. Cheers to you
---
Let me be clear: they can be extremely easy. I can solo it with my vampire Commando, which is practically immortal. I remove one of my unyielding pieces and replace it with a troubleshooters sentinel one. I use maybe two, three stimpacks. I haven't tuned myself to min-max the event, but the only reason I can't reach the third level (elder) because the bar doesn't move fast enough when I am alone.
---
If I take a good set-up, I get rammed by robots. If I equip my Tesla Vampire, it's God mode. 
---
Now, it shouldn't be necessary to do that. Plus, it is hard as fuck to bash anything successfully.
---
Dont need more treasury notes have over 1k already
---
I swear I heard a Brahmin laughing at me yesterday!
---
Im kinda thinking the same, cause using ESO as an example again, a vampire assassin or whatever should not be on par with a mudcrab resilience wise
---
Why'd you have to go and remind me of that? I fuckin' hate that mutation!
---
This is maybe the best suggestion I've seen on this forum. Excellent idea
---
Yeah, even at rank one (free) it's op.
---
LOL, spend less time coming on to me and more time learning how to play, noob.
---
The point is so that low-level players won't be running into ridiculously high-level enemies because some level 300 player just strolled through the area not too long ago. It was really annoying to go to somewhere like Whitespring while any kind of low level because it was all just level 60+ ghouls, or going somewhere in the Ash Heap and finding all level 40 Glowing Mole Miners. At least now a level 25-30 player can head over there and at least kill some stuff and get some loot without getting destroyed.
---
It also makes more events throughout the map relevant to everyone, since legendary rewards will be scaled now as well (3 legs from Leader of the Pack, Horde events, etc..)
---
You also have to remember that they just released the changes, and haven't made any appropriate buffs to weapons to compansate, which will hopefully come soon. They stated that the main reason for the damage calculation changes was for better balance overall. Hopefully that means that more and more weapons will soon become viable (explosives, bows, pistols) without making things like Bloodied and Junkie build able to 1-shot SBQ.
---
Awwee looks like you need to go back to school kid
---
With legendary perks I have minimized switching out to only Intelligence perk cards. I can already how load outs will help, like having a repair set, crafting set, etc.
---
Yes it will at max rank give you 4 more points but if you’re already at 15 like I am agility I can’t go higher. So like you I switched my build around couple months back when I got a bloodied fixer from purveyor. I knocked my strength down to 8 I think so I got that perk card so I can use some of the ones I couldn’t and I also boosted my intelligence being I dropped that to 3 for just nerd rage I’m now at 6 with another rank to go. Just plan it out being it costs a lot to rank up and to change it out it costs 1 coin. I’m level 325 and with everything other then the 50 level up I have I scrapped and only could max rank the ammo one and get to rank 3 on one and rank two on 3 I think
---
You have to be more flexible with stealth now though.
---
Obviously, the Daily Op doesn't let you do it, but with Public Teams, if you're near your teammates, they can influence your personal sneak status and make it so you no longer get the Sneak Damage Bonus when you're in \[CAUTION\].  It's a dumb mechanic, and one that's never properly communicated to the player.  People associate \[CAUTION\] with still being in Sneak, but it gets silently overridden by this.
---
Stopped playing and only do the dailies now, gg bethe$da
---
I don’t have this problem. First time hearing about this kind of bug.
---
I used to hit up the prison for the lead in the exercise yard to make ammo.  Well, everything is level 50+ now and I died trying to get lead.  This update sucks.
---
M a x i m u m.   O v e r d r i ve.
---
EA man, it's over powered, but don't tell Bethesda.
---
I found your reply very interesting.  This was my experience last night.  To get through quickly you need to stand next to the uplink.  All the time you spend running around using melee is a waste.   Tanking damage seems much more important than dealing damage.  
---
Besides, for every robot I killed, one or two took its place.  You can’t get ahead with brute force. Tanking seems key.
---
It may reset when the patch went live yesterday
---
Maybe I just suck then because I can't get the assaultron at the end below half health.
---
I think the issue is that if the enemy doesn’t  die in one or two shots they will detect u after that and alert all nearby mobs - sneak isn’t broken it is just a byproduct of not being able to kill things fast enough anymore for sneak to be as viable as it was pre-patch.  rip ...
---
I died multiple times because I kept opening my inventory trying to get out of vats
---
Man, its definitely not to run alone! Worst for me that I am standard stealth bloodied commando, I died 5 times in a row without did one single step cause respawn under a heavy fire. Its definitely not a fun game! In addiction, no matter what kind legendary weapon you have all performe almost same damage. I dont know if I am alone, but I am upset with One Wasteland
---
It does look amazing, although I'll miss running through the forest with a vampire's MM gauntlet, one-shotting and healing like Wolverine.
---
It ain't bad at all and that legendary ammo perk is sweet!
---
.45 furious fixer, thats all I needed, occasionally popping a psycho now and then but mainly just using that one gun
---
Bummer. I had heard from a couple of people they were valuable. Maybe they just meant scrip. Oh well. The gesture was the important part!! Thanks for the info.
---
Yeah, makes sense. I actually only play one toon on ESO and it's a high level vampire lol. I have a gold set geared towards vampirism and magic. As for the mudcrabs, I almost think it's a bit of humor from the devs maybe not intentionally who knows? There was apoint when I also found I had to use a lot of hits to kill a mudcrab but now one shot them. 
---
This was all after one tamriel. So, either they have high armor post one tamriel because they're crabs but when lower level it did take more hits than I expected so I avoided accidentally tagging them. As I leveled up it was no longer an issue.
---
One thing I like about ESO, which I wish Fallout 76 kinda was like was being hub based rather than one map. It'd be cool to have 76 in small hub open maps of various places along the east coast or something. Quests do often feel the same though.
---
Gods work &lt;3
---
I saved about 30 of them but yesterday I opened them and all the duplicates you have will just be that. Then you have to scrap them 1 by 1. Unlike before If you got a duplicate it would delete it I believe
---
Not much, but it is.
---
yes. most assuredly.
---
It's a good thing you can take multiple perks then, eh? ;)
---
Sorry EA?
---
No, but I do live in a region where English isn't dominant. This probably is just a regular font issue, though.
---
I ran a full set of troubleshooter as a semi-bloodied build (\~40% hp) and a vamp combat rifle was more than enough to keep me topped off - I was taking very very little damage and that was solo.
---
I'm working on getting a super mutant set too, although I'm not as worried about super mutant damage as I was robots.
---
How much did it costs you?
---
The only time they auto completed for me was while I was logged out.
---
My first thought too.
---
Oh excavator?
---
Oh I totally meant to test that yesterday... whoops. Needs to be melee damage
---
heavy guns and command are the only 2 build that are playable right now with heavy guns beeing by far the strongest
---
Just killed my first LVL 75 scorchbeasts since the patch. Took about between 30 and 40 hits
---
I'm running a BE lever action, all max rifle perks, max tank killer, nerd rage , adrenal reaction, eagle eyes, taking one for team rank 2, tenderizer and prime ammo.
---
So todd knows how people are managing without all of that! 
---
We really need a buff to rifle base damage I agree.
---
EDIT: I forgot to mention, this was a 1 star legendary, so it did benefit from a health boost. 
---
But still, it's far too difficult now, it feels like back when I was rank 20 with no legendary gear! Or prime ammo!
---
MODUS is having a field day.
---
Would be nice
---
Ye and bloodied unarmed have taken too big of a hit. My meat hook has gone from around 900 damage to around 300. They really need to even things out sooner rather than later.
---
But i dont know if automatic needs a buff tho. Maybe just Bolt action and semi-auto in the ranged departement.
---
Yeah, I was going to add it is noticeable in more extreme circumstances. Some of it can be circumnavigated with perks but as a general rule trying to tank in Excavator is a bad idea lol.
---
https://i.imgur.com/8D7kE0u.png
---
Ah, just logged in to see Robots in Burrows.. was wondering when Daily Ops would change. That's 18:00 for the UK.
---
Must have on your alt newbie characters.
---
No one knows, because on FB they reference a reddit post and that post points to an anecdotal post in which a user was warned "by a friend".
---
So nothing concrete as of yet.
---
These posts are hilarious. Massive fail, OP.
---
Turrets scale to you now. Just build a couple for workshop events. They will mow down the enemies no problem 👍
---
please tell me this is satire..
---
otherwise i suggest you learn to read.
---
I only did it once last night and I was doing it wrong so I had a hard time. I knew about having to punch the robots but I was too focused on fighting them and not pursuing the objective. For tonight, I will probably remove my stealth perks, and add in some different ones and try power armor, which I don't normally use since I'm a stealth commando. If I am not mistaken, there should be different enemies today, but overall I think I'll approach it the same way.
---
This, master infiltrator, and ammo factory
---
Edit - the survival chem one is good as well, super stim healing, full water and food, and disease cure
---
Heh, yeah I figured that out about half way through. Wish I had your comment from the beginning!
---
Who has time to read T&amp;C these days, amirite?
---
~~/s for legal reasons.~~
---
Yessir, they fixed it in patch 21
---
Thanks for the info I’ll head to Watoga and see. I’m not too bent up about the damage nerf, just more so about how the content and the patch size compare to each other and how they are still releasing content that should’ve been there from the start and acting like it’s amazing.
---
Exactly, we don’t play the game to feel like a job.  We play an hour a day if we are lucky.  So stripping out build away can take months to fix.
---
Its on purpose. You have to melee them to finish them off. Its not a bug.
---
It's not a bug but a feature. You need to do the kill with melee attacks.
---
I't one of the random mutations that have the daily ops.
---
100% it's a bad ass perk with that added effect. Other than taking one for the team and absorption most were kind alike I guess sill take that
---
Yesterday there was a ghoul horde boss there that never showed....killed the horde, no boss.  Waste of time
---
Gun bash them and it will kill them. Resilient modifier on enemies means they can only be killed by a melee attack. So shoot them down to a sliver and bash.
---
Game was shit but had fun moments now it’s shit and boring
---
Noticed same thing, it will shift people  to using faster melee... instigating Axe is only taking 90% health off most levels.  Going to be an issue with mobs.
---
I also was worried but first run with two ppl we finished in 13 minutes second run with two ppl did it in 9 third run also with two ppl we got 730 then I just went around the map. I am a bloodied commando and I was scared but after first run I just put gun away and used death claw. Team members kept guns out to get the ammo but I know it’s pointless because no matter what you gotta melee then. I will make up ammo another way I rather have the rare rewards
---
if you open the daily ops tab itll show "enemy mutations: resilient, can only be killed by a melee attack"
---
Same.  I was like "Ok, less damage.  Should be fine."  A little later "Damn, these robots are killing the 20% of hp I have"  Then 24 minutes &amp; 6 deaths later " OH MY GOD THATS A BIG ASS ASSAULTRON!"  Luckily it got stuck in a wall, &amp; 60 Bloody Gauss Rifle shots later &amp; finish with an anti armor guitar sword, but not before forcing me into Power Armor &amp; not able to use my Bloody Power Fist and killing me a dozen times.  Conclusion: Maybe switch to a Junkies build.  At least I'll have HP.
---
Yes. It is nice not having to scroll through 100 cards to get to Super Duper.
---
Oh I did not know that. I'm never a fan of alienating an entire playstyle so that modifier should rotate not always be there so the sneak people can have their fun. Also, even though I'm a full time power armor tank, that makes that perk incredibly OP as the healing is a lot. Before that perk existed I could solo the imposter sheep so I don't see the reason for it and why would they give something a major perk like that and not list it, just weird.
---
But thank you for the information I stand corrected.
---
Yea I had that happen to me too, now I limit myself to 500 gunpowder and leave the rest.
---
Tse on a shotgun is terrible, TSE is in good place compared to other effects
---
How long does it take for it to work again? This happens to me sometimes but it fixes itself after a few seconds
---
Nah, just buff demo expert to 100% to make the fatman valueable again
---
It is working as intended - read the patch notes.
---
If it makes you feel better, a lot of other people are also having a hard time reading the instructions.
---
It's a bit of a bummer eh? I tried a few times yesterday, to my disappointment.  
---
Still, it makes getting around easier at least.
---
I haven't started a new character since the update though I will be at some point. I don't understand how the game could be more difficult? Guess I'll find out.
---
Just here to say I prefer the rewards to not be automatically collected through the season. Collecting them manually helps manage your character as you can choose which one receives the rewards (scrap kits wise) and unlock them depending on how much weight you have available.
---
I finished mine 2 days before the oatch was fixed. Never doing it again, 2 dailies and ecents across the map should allow for Rep increase for doing them.
---
I was going to do this same thing today, but I didn't want to be the guy playing video games at work. DSL is the fastest thing where I live but in town they have much faster internets
---
I agree, I was so upset too 😭 I barely finished the event and constantly died. I think is awesome all the add on, but also I feel really hurt by the update.
---
Vampires Cultist Dagger. It was such a handy wapon to go around and poke those pesky lower level mobs to death without spending ammo or using my bloodied Grognak Axe.
---
I got lucky and never got it last season on Xbox and I for the most part played during reset most days unless at work
---
No. Esp not for high number weaponsnlkme shottys. Keeping the whole game in oneshot territory is paramount
---
One Wasteland brings higher level enemies right to your door. Every time I fast travel back to my CAMP, there are a few LVL75 mole rats waiting for me. Your CAMP may have been similarly visited.
---
Same. People are saying shit like "you could've spent that on food &amp; shelter" as if it's the deposit for a house or something
---
I'm a bloody commando, level 404. Just ran it for the first time now, no one else showed up, even though I was on an ops team? How are we supposed to get other players together?
---
Anyway got my ass handed to me but finished it in 18 minutes and probably 8 deaths. Yikes. Switched unyielding out for bolstering armour and used a vampire explosive combat rifle. The vampire effect helped A LOT. Knocked their health down while healing myself then finished them off with a gun bash. The boss was a pain in the ass.
---
Anyway I don't think I want to try to solo that again. Need a team in there.
---
But I know all the right angles.
---
Same here. Never ending enemy spawns were bs.
---
Pre patch my shotty was doing work. Idk what you’re on about with “TSE on a shotgun is terrible” because it wasn’t pre patch.
---
Yes, I buy them up from vendors because of that reason 👍🏻
---
So you're upset that you actually have to play the half of the game you were ignoring?
---
Gotcha.
---
Yeah that sounds familiar
---
I do the same, I still collect all the acid I can get my hands on but I sell it in my vendors.
---
Vault raids where gone way before a month ago
---
Which I'm fine with because it's what I already use.
---
Ok, so it's an investment not a total loss. But yes, you are right that it pays to be careful even with the initial leveling due to this. Not everyone has done god mode and has tons of coins to burn. Perhaps at some point t they will allow us to sell legendary perks back at half the investment cost in case we decide months down the road to try something a little different.
---
Shouldn't there be a scaling option somewhere in your TV's settings?
---
They made it more of a grind so people play their shitty game longer
---
Works fine for me and works a treat coupled with Adrenaline 5.
---
Regular perks don't, so these wouldn't either.
---
Fate indeed.   I need to go look for another pet - I can’t count the times I’ve come across the same random encounters in the glade for the Messenger, Raider/Foundation guy who needs ammo, Cultists, Herder w/Sasquatch.   
---
The issue is that there isn’t anything video evidence out there.  If you had documented it, then we could unequivocally know.  But just to play devils advocate, your saying YouTube is wrong, and your “word” on Reddit is correct.  This is why we have a lack of information, as well as empirical evidence to support it lol.   
---
On a side note, after this feed I removed one point from CHR.  So glad I did.
---
33% VATS accuracy makes it magic. Bethesda has done nothing about it, so honestly I wouldn't worry about it. Shotguns are weak otherwise.
---
I know. I got it in my head that they were coming back but I think I just misheard it.
---
Not all of is have more that 5 hours to grind everything
---
Now, how about a shotgun fix with the rubberbanding health?
---
They absolutely hate me and my legit Bloodied build but then they’re more than happy to kiss their own assholes and sing their praises when they’re using glitches to outdamage the likes of me.
---
With Electric Absorption 1\* and Take one for the team 2\* so far, adrenaline 2\* the damage taken was replaced faster than receiving. I do sometimes get crippled (critical-ish hit from robot?) just throw a stim.
---
I can tank the bots pretty much but if I just stand and take everything health does degrade, my armor is getting damaged so going to try White Night, haven't used that before on this build.
---
Gauss shotgun is putting out 393 base without charge or adrenaline etc.
---
I loved being able to pick a lock and not HAVE to swap cards out! Such a small thing gave me so much joy that I picked every lock I saw. Even went out of my way a couple times to unlock a level 3 locked safe just cuz.
---
Well then I feel like you will be happy once you grind to them. The foosball table is neat, and imo the train is top 3 best items in this seasons rewards
---
Hi all, 
---
We're actively working on a fix for this issue right now, and have temporarily disabled the Weight Bench in the meantime. You can still earn it as a reward from the Scoreboard, and can still build it in your CAMP, you just won't be able to use it for the buff while it's disabled. 
---
We have a thread up [here in the Bethesda.net forums](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/428366/), and I'll update it as soon as I have more info. Thanks for the report!
---
I literally only had 20 mins during lunch to pop on and I was eager to see the new content.  I just popped in and it seemed pretty straight forward.  Should have certainly took a closer look.  I apologize for my ignorance.
---
I don't think it starts off that easy. I have also grinded and put a lot of hours in to get to where I can casually walk around and enjoy, and I don't want my experience changed to take that away.
---
Do you know what is useful in yesterday's daily ops? Shoot and bash. Also Anti-Armor flamer against the boss.
---
Next years fashnat should be better if you dont have all the damn one shotters and everybody will be able to get a hit on the sloth with this update.
---
Yeah maybe when you heard about daily ops being like raids or dungeons. They did bring vault 94 back as in we can explore it. But like others said vault 51 is going to be something one day being you can’t build there anymore
---
Part of the problem is that the damage changes that were made were also made to the nw versions of the weapons and mods so they are all doing additive damage instead of multiplicative.
---

 &gt; Hi all, 
---
 &gt;
---
 &gt;We're actively working on a fix for this issue right now, and have temporarily disabled the Weight Bench in the meantime. You can still earn...
---
What build are you using? Did you max fallow through?
---
I saw on your other comment you have a significant amount of  playtime under your belt. Maybe some tweaking is all that is needed to get you back on the right track.
---
It seems like somehow Bloody commando builds aren’t hurt to bad, most of the folks saying it didn’t make a big difference seem to be full auto builds. 
---
Bloody Rifleman builds got wrecked, in my experience. My bloodied .50 cal feels like a bone stock, non-legendary now, can’t even one shot a mole rat from sneak.
---
Yep it sucks. Unfortunately you either need to fully optimize or just respec even though the respec system is complete dog shit.
---
Hmm 🤔 give me a min and I'll go get an exact floor space size for you.
---
How did you not know this was coming? It has been THE discussion point for the last month on this sub.
---
You can’t get a better build. The changes are not bloody specific. Every build has been affected to some extent. Bloodied is still top damage dealer.
---
There are the SPECIAL legendary perks that let you take additional perks.  I'm not sure what your build looks like but there might be some additional charisma/luck/int perks you can take now that you didn't have enough perk points to get before.
---
Definitely electric absorption and ammo factory.
---
But i just joined the game after having been logged out and i just joined and only half of it got destroyed
---
TSE on shotgun has always been terrible since the first nerf.look at your accuracy stat
---
I think overall damage from guns and stuff is gonna be a little rough for a few weeks, but hopefully they will bring some buffs to the underwhelming weapons and make more things viable. That's what they said the whole update was for, after all.
---
Also switching perks for specific events might be more of a thing now. You said Campfire Tales? Try putting on Exterminator then.
---
pretty sure they did change damage calculation to additive across the board. that being said i feel like my covert operative maxed out was adding like 100 damage lol
---
Why? I have a jump boost. There is no stat for jumping.
---
Collateral Damage is good in theory but leaves a lot to be desired, it procs so little that usually the last enemy in the group is the only one to explode. Still fun though
---
The whole daily operation thing is a bad call. it seems like theyre trying to do destiny night falls but we didnt have to grind for heals and ammo.
---
I did change servers
---
It sounds like you set yourself up to be upset by purposefully not claiming the prizes in hopes they would be auto collected. Submit a ticket and learn from it. Btw.. Everybody else dealt with the same board issues.
---
I've been preparing for college and have a social life. I dont have all fucking day to look at reddit.
---
I'm a bloodied PA heavy/2 hand on my main, I took a biiiiiig hit in damage like everybody else but found it wasn't too difficult to overcome. 
---
I've got other characters and build styles tho, haven't tinkered around with them yet. One of them is a pistol-medic and I suspect he might be done-zo. He was just barely viable before against tough enemies. They are everywhere now and he won't be outputting as much damage. I've also got a berserker rifleman who pays his bills with stealth. What made him fun was I could still do major damage with him, I'm kind of skeptical it will be worth it now. 
---
All that said, playing the Op with my main last night was the most I've enjoyed the game in a long, long time.
---
I’ve only been to the burrows 3 or 4 times and I got 8 minutes 30 seconds in my first run, 8:20 on my second run. Just go watch a video, once you know what you have to do it’s easy
---
^ took the words out of my mouth
---
So thats 1 hour after reset right?
---
Mine is fully optimised, so your saying i gotta respec
---
TSE on heavy and rifles is still good, never messed with TSE shotguns pre patch( asuming you are talking about the explosive gun nerf from like a year ago if you are referring to the one wasland nerf, I though they were trash before that). Ngl id enjoy my TSE handmade being buffed again but I don't see that happening.
---
I agree with you on the one hand. I sank 700+ hours into my character and now mole rats are scary again. Hooray, thanks, Bethesda.
---
On the other hand, those big end game events now feel like big events again, and I think that's good. The SBQ and Earl should be a bit difficult for a group, let alone someone playing solo.
---
So, half and half. I think the rebalancing is unbalanced, but that doesn't mean it's all bad.
---
I’m a sucker for model trains in real life, ngl. I’ll never be the type to have a setup at home, but the hotel by my parents place has one set up as a Christmas village every year, and I love it
---
And when you play long enough you’ll have the exact same experience and will get bored. No offense but a game shouldn’t cater to new players at the expense of everyone else.
---
There were plenty of new player friendly areas ... now it’s just a mess with bullet sponge enemies and no real reason to keep playing unless you want to stock up on ridiculous amounts of ammo and stimpacks at higher levels.
---
Its 100% facts not ignorance
---
I died then i noticed i wasnt doing the most dps (no sneak) so i stim spammed, unequipped my gun and punched all red robots to finish them. So much fucking fun :))))
---
depends on your skill and build.
---
Enemies scale you your level now. But the way damage is figured has been change so in general you do a good portion less damage. So yes, its a good chance its will be challenging for you.
---
There were some pretty significant changes, though most of it is in the background so you dont notice it as much, like all the combat mechanics.
---
Or the legendary perks system which likely also has a ton of behind the scenes code in addition to the new ui and cards.
---
And vault 94 getting readded for ops and exploration.
---
Still beats 70-90 GB Modern Warfare patches, or when your update corrupts the game file and you get to download the whole 77gb game again before you can access your alt bank, that was me last night.
---
sorta.  things like cosmetics/camp items are unlocked universally across all your characters.  consumables (repair kits, lunchboxes) only go to the character that "collects" them from the board
---
Did TS get a buff or something?
---
short answer.. yes
---
Melee is fine, yesterday I did a Whitesprings lap to get started and my TTK was exactly the same as before the patch: one super sledge to the face, down goes the (now) level 75 ghoul. Only difference was the sole Glowing One I encountered, but they should be far more difficult to take down.
---
The reports of panic and problems are greatly exaggerated, especially for low level characters. 
---
Most of those that are bothered by the change are players with characters min-maxed to be able to one-shot virtually everything in the game short of bosses. Instead of having ‘Easy Mode’ 99% of the time, the have it only about 90% of the time. It may take an extra shot or two to finish off the harder enemies. But it’s not taking a while clip to kill one radroach. 
---
As a level 15, you can still run in the Forest for now, and since the enemies will scale to you, you’ll get more XP for only slightly more effort. 
---
I ran Grafton yesterday and the SMs were higher level, but still very manageable.  And I got a lot more XP than I normally would there. 
---
Ignore the doomsayers. The game is still pretty much the same for sub level 100 characters.
---
Interesting so not point killing the bots unless you want the xp, for soloing just tank the damage and run to next link.
---
Its just angered me so much, I grinded so hard, sorry to hear you sank so many hours man, youve suffered more than I have
---
Yeah, the accuracy is bad but that’s why you use skeet shooter. That’s literally the point of that perk. I’m a shotgun build I know what I’m talking about.
---
Why couldn't this be a simple tweak to help make a better experience for lower level players to be able to play side by side with higher levels. It's not realistic (as others have described this change) to always have everything be a much higher level to match yours. With experience comes the ability to kill some enemies more easily. And there still needs to be places where you can breathe a little and enjoy some simplicity and other areas where you go for varying levels of combat challenge. While the thought was this would help get more players to events, it will certainly not help lower level events - the ones that higher levels would take on solo, as nobody else was there, to farm or for the simple fun of it. 
---
My main char is lvl 233 with a versatile build for heavy guns and rifles. Normally this works well for me. No matter where I go, or what I do, everything is lvl 50 or higher. No matter how the enemy spawns and attacks, I am facing a higher dmg challenge - giving and receiving. With VATS still broken it makes it worse. And, for those with Parkinson's, VATS is necessary as you can't exactly aim all the time - one of the key reasons I have been able to enjoy Fallout games. I can't believe that a tiny horde of 3 ghouls could kill me when I am packing a TS plasma caster.

Seems 1pm est is the time.

---
The enemies will scale to your level. So far I like the idea, but I also want to try it with my low level characters to test out what people are saying is true. We all going to level up so much quicker now, the challenge is nice. I don't do the big events so can't comment. It's not perfect and probably going to be a little annoying, we going to have to work a little harder and be more creative. Gives me a little fo4 survival mode feeling, I like it so far.
---
Great advice! Also, use troubleshooters armor.
---
1pm ET. 12pm is the future goal
---
Dang mate sorry to hear. I mean yeah I agree that there can be a significant number of disconnects, I hear PC gets the worst of it, but there is a lot of cheating and abuse of the code that occurs on PC. Now granted, Bethesda has a long way to go to get server stability, but I believe if they use I standing more and allow for instanced interior camps, we could see better server stability. I know one thing that causes crashes is when dupers enter worlds with thousands of not tens or hundreds of thousands of items, it causes major strain on the server you’re loaded in. People who are exploiting within the server also causes crashes or server lag. With how easy the engine itself is to manipulate, you can start piling up all the root causes, but even then, with every update we see bugs addressed, but even more develop or reoccur. So yeah it’s a slippery slope this game, but this update is miles better than 21, surely you can agree there.
---
then why the fuck are you on here now.
---
or rage quit. you seem like a rage quitter.
---
I think I know what your asking, but to clarify... Are you asking if it shorter than a Power Pylon? I don't know how you would get anything under a pylon. Please elaborate good sir
---
Pretty much was, sure there was some other 1% bugs that a few people got hit with. Even Bethesda doesn't know what causes it, but logging out at least gave you a chance for it not to occur.
---
Find a set of Troubleshooter's armor. Bonus points if it has Sentinel's as the 3rd legendary effect. Then stand there and laugh at those robots. Except the Mr. Gutsies - those still hurt and need to be killed ASAP.
---
Go up..
---
If they buff hunting rifle to 300-400 range than the damage nerf won’t be as noticeable because I can maintain adequate distance. Right now it’s pretty rough to use anything other than a lever because of too much damage drop off.
---
I tried to make a stealth build. Without the special sneak armor, I was noticed immediately any time I did anything around an enemy I was noticed. I barely did any damage even to enemies that are beneath my level by a large margin. It didn't work at all and it was really annoying because it is generally what I like doing in both the earlier Fallout games and Skyrim.
---
I kept a 1 star instigating switch blade just for that
---
Still a call out to let people know since some might think that and realize no; they really should though.
---
Wait, aren’t animated cards just given via RNG?
---
I soloed it last night and ended up using tons of ammo and around 35+ stimpacks because it doesn’t tell you to run away from enemies and hide. If you fight your way through, it takes forever and uses way too many resources. It’s just poor design without a payoff.
---
The Colossal Problem quest is an example of something with better design and story tie-in. I enjoyed teaming up for that because it tied into the narrative.
---
I’m convinced the Daily Ops are meant to attract COD fans and non-RPG players. Same thing I really dislike about ESO.
---
Could you please delete this?
---
My melee is absolutely fine. Are you using bloodied? If so, that’s why.
---
It's pretty cheap to test them out (only 1 perk coin to unequip and you start with all of them) so I'd play around to see which ones suit you. As a heavy gunner myself, I enjoy the sprint AP reduction in PA one and ammo factory the most. I've found the "exploding enemies" ones don't quite proc as often as they should (could just be RNG) and don't do much damage anyway. If anything, they make finding the body to loot that much harder. And of course any of the stat ones if you find yourself really wanting to use a card that you don't have room for. 
---
Honestly it's mostly personal preference, none are game-changing but many bring good QoL upgrades. I'm not a bloodied build so I like the "what rads?" perk because it means I almost never have to use my decontaminator or any radaway.
---
Never had any specific build. Just played with what I had and enjoyed the game for the most part. Now, not at all. It's fine. Lots of games are releasing soon and gives me time to play them. I may come back to 76 in time. No way in hell do I want to have to grind through another scoreboard with the game as it is right now.
---
Sorry..I meant the NEW legendary perk. My bad.
---
Right in the patchnotes stickied under "hot post"
---
Game development? More than half of the games assets were recycled from Fallout 4, and the rest had all been added to the atomic shop. They literally don't need any more money than what they've gotten at launch. Have you ever heard of Monster Hunter World? That's a good example of live service done right, and they didn't need an in game cash shop forced down your throat 24/7, they didnt need gameplay influencimg microtransactions or lousy subscription based bullshit just to get features that should've been in the game to begin with. Face it kid, the devs of fallout 76 are just greedy and manipulative and they've caught you hook, line, and sinker.
---
I liked Yao Guais. They were nice and easy to kill. Mole rats were the little cunts. Now they’re big cunts.
---
Why?
---
My point is devs are being overwhelmed to the point that they produce more content at expense of quality. And that is bad for business.
---
If you're not satisfied with your build yes. Your build isn't completely trash. It just is extremely niche and one of the toughest builds to stay at now. 
---
From a pve design it makes sense. Doesn't mean you aren't allowed to dislike it. But lets be real it makes sense. You shouldn't be dealing massive amounts of damage with low health to the end game boss as a melee player. 
---
Earle also isn't worth the risk/reward for you imo at this point.
---
At first I was just bashing enemies to kill them. I did realize I could shoot a bunch of them down to 1 hp, then swap in a knife and run around and finish them off at once
---
I run 4 characters, the only time I got hit with it was when I missed the log out deadline, I was probably lucky, but I definitely had 2 occurrences where it happened and it only happened to me when I forgot to logout.
---
My issue was that I couldn't get the event active -- when you go into Pip Boy, it's not even an option under events (or any of the others). And I did a pretty good search radius around the fast travel point. But I'll be sure to check Red Rocket next time, and if you remember the other spot please share. Thanks.
---
Can i ask a serious question....over 400 levels and I didnt even notice some were animated whats the difference?
---
It’s in the [Patch Notes](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5cRE8qhGB6BrOuJBnPhNGO/fallout-76-update-22-patch-notes-september-15-2020).
---
Only if you have a melee weapon equipped.
---
To me, casual is playing for the fun of the game.
---
Casual is not all about 
---
 1.  power leveling (missing out on the lore and stories) 
---
2. stressing over acquiring  god tier weapons/armor.  I can take out high level enemies, I just cant do it in one shot, and thats OK.
---
3.  hosing someone else day by killing them over a workshop (yea, I know, part of the game mechanic), 
---
4.  Being first to complete (whatever) 
---
5. Spending all playtime launching nuke after nuke.
---
Casual  is about 
---
1. taking my time doing all the missions and quests. ....and enjoying the time doing it.
---
TS combat shotgun here, and I’m not one-shotting everything.
---
or system settings.
---
there are many solutions to this
---
Is that regardless of whether the event is active?
---
So what you're telling is that all the people who got hit with the bug even though we were logged off at the reset... should have done what, exactly? If that was a guaranteed solution then we shouldn't have been hit with the bug.
---
Probably didn't expect enemies to go from level 1 to 100, but to scale up a little... calmer?
---
Right I only said lose them because if you’re not a super high level with perk cards galore to burn, you’ll pretty much lose them. I know I couldn’t spare 200 coins stuck on a card I might never use again.
---
So it costs a coin to unequip them?  I didn’t notice or actually try yet.
---
Different strokes for different folks. Everybody is bound to have something that is more meaningful to their personal QoL. This one is great for me because it shaves a lot of time off of a nuke run without having to fudge the process, but Ammo Factory is also an awesome must-get.
---
Thats dumb but tracks with everything bethesda has done tbh
---
1pm east
---
You get 2,000 Atoms back throughout rank 1-100, so after you factor that in, it was right at 12,500 Atoms to go from rank 3 to rank 100.
---
none of those are legendary perks
---
If you have explosive you're definitely OK.
---
That being said, I also have a Quad Lever and was able to take down a Lvl100 3\* Super Mutant before their health regenerated. So that's good too :)
---
Yea I was assuming it would be like challenges, it resets at 5pm daily, but that doesn't appear to be the case....
---
My bad, I misread
---
I feel the same. It would be a welcome change but I dont feel it is really necessary. Also, thanks to ammo converter (wich still kinda sucks) and ammo factory perk I wont be needing to craft ammo in a loooong time.
---
If you want ultracite ammo do a Daily Op or Wendigo Colossus and farm ammo!
---
It's not easy to do that at lower levels - I was building a shotgun build...didn't get a single shotgun perk until I could choose my own at level 50. Until you hit that level 50 point you're entirely at the mercy of random chance.
---
I'm still sticking with bloodied. These new perk cards allow me to add even more cards for dmg/energy reduction, gun damage cards and some utility because I can!
---
OMFG do people know they can read other posts? This has been asked 10 times in the last hour.
---
Yes and no, am a no mic player, there other ways to communicate like with discord
---
I'm gonna miss going to the carnival and stabbing everyone I see.
---
F.
---
I said it on my other comment but I'll say it here too. It makes sense in a pve aspect. You're not being punished for walking around with low health. If bloodied is now too hard switch to junkies. 
---
My damage was never insanely good so the change was pretty minimal for me. Instead of one shotting things I now occasionally 1-3 shot depending on the enemy level.
---
You can open up all your packs. There was never a reason not to, unless you had every perk at every possible level.
---
Yeah I run a tank, debuff buff build and my buddy I play with is a sneak bloodied so he is going to be very disappointed with that news. But yeah I don't like like sneak is just written off like that, not fair to you all at all.
---
And I agree, watching angryturtle use it I instantly said that it was broken because it worked to well and was not in the description but if its intended then it will get nerfed. I was already invincible before the update no need for more toughing perks at this point.
---
We have something in common then, because I have always been infatuated with model train sets. You will love the "Electric Train Set" reward for sure
---
Yeah i know. Still got the shaft. Bloodied was the best. Not any more.
---
I personally think the old game was too easy.  I have not had a lot of time to check out the new patch, but I am excited to give it a go and have a better challenge presented.  I was intentionally nerfing myself and running with a pistol build for fun.  I don't know who enjoyed being an OP powerhouse, it's not fun.
---
No... Because this is the math for the Maximum number of coins possible. I would have a set of max legendary perks and absolutely zero regular perks.
---
Saying "by my math" and then showing no math doesn't help much does it?
---
There's absolutely no way anything will convince me you can't slip 2 fingers through a meat hook grip. The powered suit will give you plenty of grip.
---
Thanks brother
---
All of this comes from the decision of Bethesda to change a product operation for a sum operation. This is called nerf and it's the root of everything. For the rest I think it's like any other patch, but the guy who decided the balance didn't take in account that everyone would be affected. More difficult enemies with the same damage values as patch 21 is OK but stronger enemies for a damage reduction from about 50% to 75% is not what people is asking for. So yes the game is currently hard or even harder than before and it's not fun.
---
Hope you've a good balance left - that's the new Xbox Series X for free right there.
---
OMFG sometimes I don’t have the time to go and read a ton of other posts
---
I would also like Confetti explosions. Watonga Forever.
---
Hooray! Thanks for the report 🤘🏼
---
Every game needs the Dead Space "just die already" stomp
---
Wow, thanks for the update on this. But that’s 4 months without a 1st sub and I’m not coming back, ultimately a loss for Bethesda. I know they won’t change their ways over this, but I hope it adds up.
---
Ive been transitioning from bloody melee to a heavy guns build,  ran the op using a vamps minigun, the final word .50 and kept my trusty bloody fss grognak axe in my back pocket. Tons of fun
---
Yeah, my heavy weapons guy carries an all rise and a power fist so I have a melee in and out of power armor. After yesterday I'm probably getting rid of them
---
I have no idea what you are talking. 
---
"The Fault in logic here is if you have access to all the things(,) "that" (then?) you should be able to have all things built." 
---
What does this even mean?
---
I'd deffo like an option to change to a ghoul, or supermutant, or something else and have that become your character.
---
The way the story begins, you kinda need to exit Vault 76 as a relatively healthy human, so I think what you've set out might be a nice way to fold in that character change in a way that makes sense.
---
To become a supermutant, maybe you'd fall in the vats of FEV at WestTek - You come out with increased strength, and lower perception/agility... Or something, I don't know.
---
This effect was a great idea. Gives me the Wild Wasteland perk vibes.
---
The difficulties of having no significant other or offspring - had to start the update when I got home and it took all night.
---
I'll look you up tonight.
---
1pm ET.
---
I personally don't buy people were logged off, they likely were saying they were logged off or got the time mixed up. Go thru all the threads where it happened and 99% of the people were logged on. As I said, there likely were some other variables it happened, but most of them could be solved by logging off. People SHOULD still log off, we KNOW the bug will likely never be fixed, that is what I am saying.
---
So do you yourself take less damage as well as your teammates?
---
But apparently you do have the time to post a new thread. Weird!
---
Fly swatter event? I'm not sure I really only go to that area when the event is up. Just every time I join it there is no icon but I can hear it.
---
I feel feel a little cheated since I've respected a character multiple times by now.
---
Thanks for the info but sure looks like a waste of money. Personally, i don't like anything else except the bench and the bunker.  OP must be new and got excited about the camp items
---
No difference in animated cards over normal ones.   
---
Early version of the legendary perks required scrapping of animated cards for more perk points I believe.
---
Join the overencumbered in gum club
---
I see your point. In contrast to previous Fallout games, 76 story is much more linear, meaning your options for changing the experience on new playthroughs is mostly just build. Without the legendary grind, there's no end game.
---
My point is more that "Fallout" historically has been about your choices, and the lasting effects on the world. It builds the atmosphere by making survival a challenge.
---
In 76, the story is 99% linear, the world doesn't really change, and survival is guaranteed (death is a trivial setback). I could concede that until level 45-50, survival/scarcity is true... But after that the game is something else, not-Fallout.
---
The grind for ever-better RNG-guns/armor, and tweaking your build to max your dmg and clear time more closely resembles Borderlands than Fallout. I love both, but for different reasons.
---
To summarize, yes I agree, Legendary grind is necessary for any sort of end-game length. It just changes the experience from "Fallout" to "Mmo Borderlands with base-building".
---
Because Bethesda will nerf it to be additive.
---
Yes!  Ammo sink and resource sink (repairing equipment way too often with max perks)
---
You mean does the most damage? Depends on the situation.
---
It's mixed feelings for me. Overall it's good I think, but it would be nice to have a safe haven to explore and gather without being on guard all the time.
---
On the ops... As long as I was moving or shooting I was good. I get lost easily in the labyrinth, always chasing a floating diamond 95m away. I will be better once I learn my way around, it was just a frustrating intro to the event.
---
As an Xbox user, :(
---
Some people are reporting that they are one shooting bosses with TSE’s and Tesla’s
---
I opened all 40 of mine last night and it was fine then took 94 adamantium skeletons from pick a perk and scrapped took me about 15 minutes to do it all total.
---
They added the content every veteran player has been asking for , a fun/challenging/repeatable instanced event . 
---
As for “making enemies bullet sponges” idk what y’all are talking about . I played my pistol and my melee character last night . My pistols took 3-5 more bullets than it used to and my melee character took 1 extra swing using 2handers . Unless you were a bloodied unarmed using 200 different  %damage modifiers than it’s not much difference
---
Yes, at least this was my observation. Most important is stay next to the uplink, NEVER move away from it.  I learned this observing a random player that joined me and my two friends.  The three of us were clueless.  But this guy just stood there.  His actions seemed pretty deliberate and I just followed his lead.  
---
Oh, four players standing next to the uplink means it progresses 4x faster.  So maybe three next to the uplink shooting while one team member runs around dealing final death blows.
---
You misunderstood me.. if you planning a shotgun build , don’t pick a pistol perk when you lvl up ? Having problem with ammo? Trade resource or buy from other player?  Join a public group for the bonus?  Etc etc the game is still playable but you have to realize that it a different experience now
---
I’m bloodied unarmed thinking of changing
---
Not from where I'm standing.
---
Why are you so rude!
---
I have the Spanish version of fhe game and the Armor Ace tab has the name "Marcador" as a replacement which means "Marker" or a place to put something else. 
---
It's kind of really nigguh?!?!
---
Exploding ghouls?  I don't think we are playing the same game!
---
Took me id guess about ten or fifteen seconds to drain it and then I just gun bash it.
---
Good point
---
They should do 5 coins not 1 
---
And they should also give 1 per daily quest 
---
If you really think about it.. a lvl50 player could build up 10,000 perk coin and it wouldn’t make a difference because you have to unlock slots!! Lol so it pointless gate limit the perk coin gain
---
I agree with your first part absolutely .. we know the game is ridden with bugs, no one can argue with you on that. 
---
And no I don't agree with your second part at all, knock yourself out and stay logged, just don't come back here and whine about it when you were still logged on.
---
As I said, I run 4 accounts, I should have been hit at least one time. I generally only play at night and was not hit once if I logged on at night. I only got hit when I forgot to log off. I know for a fact it does help to log off and I am not the only one that can confirm this.
---
i came back to this game after playing modern warfare intensely for too long and needed a break. i came back because it was relaxed. i could run around to explore, and not be high intensity all the fucking time. i dont have that anymore. 
---
ive never had to make ammo as i buy it from vendors, but cant see many people sell ammo for caps anymore. not 45 or 556 at least. everything is breaking quicker. the score is a chore. the game isnt relaxing anymore and is turning into a job with each update.
---
Not too long, but yet too long!    It probably takes 30-60 seconds.  Enough for me to just stand there and get killed in the uplink event.
---
The op was extremely easy though, I'd hope there is something more challenging in store. 1st run going completely blind thinking I could only melee for the 1st half we still got the 2nd highest reward,  2nd run knowing what to do but getting stuck with an afk we did highest rewards with 30 seconds to spare, i think we'd easily break 7 minutes with x4 on uplinks (we were a duo)
---
I agree, that is pure melee and was definitely overlooked by Bethesda. Then again when you only have like 4 people working on a game they are bound to miss things.
---
Most people are restoring A.T.L.A.S.
---
Must admit that the patch is astonishingly stable, but the nerf made the whole patch feel like... something has been removed from the core game.
---
I didn’t consider that aspect.  What level are you?
---
You can buy gold with caps?
---
I got that Ammo Factory perk and maxed it out right away, thinking it'd be a great boon. Look at the sea of ammo I can produce! Then I spent the day playing and had to come back and make more ammo a few times. The insane Ammo Factory increase isn't insane in a game that now requires automatic weapons to do good damage, and that makes all enemies bullet sponges. It barely provides balance, even.
---
Don't expect to much sympathy from me about it, this is EXCATLY how us players who enjoyed the original adventure mode felt as PvP and survival elements slowly got taken away. I played the beta and liked what I saw but over time the game turned into a co-op everyone be nice to each other wander fest so I'm glad the game is harder bring it on, I'll survive and thrive like I always have. Just the next time you see and angry PvP player maybe you all with sympathize with them instead of just downvoting.
---
Yeah. I did mention extra crit damage. That would work nice for it
---
As a bloodied build I disapprove.... the rads resistance caught my eye but then when I found out that it removes rads I was like nah uh
---
slightly more effort is a huge understatement. Try playing a new character for a few days its impossible to farm the amount of ammo, stimpaks to continuously fight enemies. this update turned diffulculty up by a lot for low level players who aren't min/maxing. All my weapons: .44 pistol, sniper rifle, handmade gun. all are basically useless now. with my .44 doing near 90 damage it takes 2-3 whole clips to kill one mr farmland. its not fun its just aggravating if you don't alreasy have a perfect build
---
i got an instigating swingspeed powerfist and its mad fun with the explosive palm, explosive kill and cleave perks
---
Ok cheater
---
Luckily for me I never conformed to the bloody train as I choose to be a drug addict and it still melts and I have a good health pool
---
I'm not sure if I consider myself long term casual (600hrs since BETA), but I have loved the changes. The difficulty bump in most areas has made it actually fun and take some effort.
---
This. They should have made a mini ammo factory you can place in your CAMp. Im going to spend my day looking for lead and acid to make ammo now.
---
Yeah my fav leg perk by far
---
Or they could have left it like that. Some stuff is still multiplicative. Hiding something is not helping anything.
---
The diehards will determine a new meta.  Just give it time.
---
Consider the chemist backpack, it has the same effect as lv 3
---
You aren't understanding.
---
I want them to create a separate new game dedicated to expanding upon and polishing build mode.
---
Once they finish ironing out the bugs, then they can think about expanding the game into an open world. 
---
Fallout 76 needs to be redone from the ground up and it needs to be done right.
---
Yes because typing three sentences is much quicker than looking through a forum for who knows how long
---
I’m thinking it will be part of the BOS dlc. The BOS will probably think ZAX is an abomination and try to destroy it
---
No! You get 20👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
---
SBQ still seems to draw a pretty big crowd but ACP has been a ghost town for sure. I'm on the casual side and I guess I've lucked out that I always seem to get thrown in with other players capable of doing massive damage while I try to defend them from the spawns. Only lost one time in 2 or 3 dozen goes.
---
Stars don’t correlate from the mole miners to the gear. A three star miner can drop a one star item you know...But I did it last night and my drops were either level 45 or 50 where they were usually 35 or 40
---
Doesn't reset until 1 pm eastern.
---
They added 25? Perk cards to each character to make them stronger . If you choose to put 5 of those into ammo/lock picking that’s your problem . You can damn near have every special at 15 now
---
what does it look like? do i type "green hood" in google to see it?
---
If you’re running with a team, I’d recommend sharing one rank of the charisma perk that shares stimpak healing (team medic I think?). It’ll likely do the whole team more good than bodyguards, as any time someone stims you’ll all get a heal. Be sure to check your DR/ER too, you start getting diminishing returns once you’re over 350 or so. You have several perks that boost those, so you may consider reallocating some points if your resistances are high enough. And I assume you already know this, but percentage based perks like dodgy and ricochet are typically more valuable for defense than the DR/ER perks are
---
I've done the event with no legendary before. It has a high chance of procing a three star at the end, but it's not a guarantee.
---
Or fast travel.
---
Or the friends list bug.
---
Smell ya later
---
It's turning into Fallout 4 where the higher the enemy, the more ammo it takes. I used a mod called "Better Locational Damage" and it made FO4 infinitely better. Crits should always do more damage while armored bodies shouldn't. Ot's just more spongey enemies and that doesn't mean challenging, just means more annoying crap to put up with. Especially with VATS saying "95%" and missing 6 shots in a row.
---
I’m starting to wonder this myself. I mean don’t get me wrong, in an open world game with this amount of content I’m definitely down for and expecting traditional Bethesda glitches but some of this stuff is ridiculous. I was excited yesterday to read in the patch notes that they “fixed” the interior problems with the communist bunker, but what they didn’t tell you is that they just created a whole bunch of new problems with it since all my power connectors were inaccessible because they were now ghosted behind the new diagonal walls. I ended up having to scrap most of my camp and redo it for 6 hours.
---
That feels like it should be fixed, but something tells me Zenimax isnt gonna let Bethesda slow down to fix things
---
Bloodied heavy guns is still good
---
One tap builds aren't fun, melee or not lol I'm glad they nerfed them. Too many people use bloodied and nothing else
---
ok.
---
Ah ok gotcha thanks!  I thought maybe they fixed it so that a 3* would drop a 3* lol
---
In an earlier iteration on the pts i think they did give more.
---
Explosive weapons will look a lot better now since very few perks actually boost explosive damage. So in general the additive change will effect them the least.
---
Damn so they're an hour behind the daily reset?
---
That would be nice
---
Yeah I got the first rank of electric absorption, I didn't kill the protectrons or brain bots and they kept zapping me to full health and my vamp minigun was icing on the cake
---
Also level 50 glowing rabbits. What...
---
There were a lot of people at line in the sand. But I also imagine spending their time with daily ops.
---
Are we supposed to be feeling sympathy right now
---
Yes but it's not worth the amount of menuing and having to keep track of how much you actually have to turn in
---
It's a neat item in theory but the usability is such that I'd rather drop or gift ammo instead
---
Also interested to know.
---
Is there only one Daily Op "flavor" per day? Both times I played yesterday it was just Burrows uplink with resilient bots.
---
And that's awesome and I'm glad they did something to mitigate the endless bullet farming aspect, but it doesnt change the fact that dumping 500 rounds into a anglerfish is boring as fuck.
---
In addition, the power normalization means no matter what gear you get or armor you get, you never actually get stronger since the enemies scale with you.  I used to go through low level areas to farm meds and ammo becuase enmores were pushovers and I could net a profit in resources, but that sounds unviable now.
---
I think this will keep everyone from crowding their camps and minis around foundation and crater to get the free travel. Now we can all crowd around the Rusty Pick and V9 instead.
---
What is the daily op for today?
---
Ahh ok, i thought you ment like critcal hits you use in vats. Definitely be nice if no vats users could have the extra damage aswell.
---
I have no position on this. I was answering your question on why they guy asked to delete it.
---
Yes. /u/valseek mentioned they will be changing the Daily Ops reset time to 12PM EST in the future to be in line with the challenges reset.
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
I've never once been at line in the sand without at least 3-4 other players showing up.
---
For now, they said they'll be changing that so it's the same as the challenge reset.
---
Wish I could give you a 100 upvotes, that was what happened to me last night. I was getting 8 20 as my time last night not bad with how lost I get in burrows and figured 1 or 2 more people doing uplink should smash it and saw a team of 2 high level players and a 120 high op team. However even after waiting 10 mins for them whilst trying to emoji and message them to join i gave up. Luckily the 120 came to the rescue and we just managed it with 5 seconds to spare. Not annoyed with people doing their own thing but don't do op parties if you don't want to do them
---
And why should they?
---
No regerts here.
---
I definitely agree with what he is saying as well in some aspects but it also ignores a ton of the issues. 
---
For example lets use your level 12. Yes, you're using perks to help pistols. That's good. however you're kinda locking yourself into using pistols very early on for a couple of reasons. 
---
1. respec in this game is just god awful. In the future if you find a better gun or overall want to switch builds its gonna be a pain if you fully stacked your build to work well on one gun type. When I say in the future I do not simply mean late game as that's a whole other thing.
---
2. You're using perks early on to focus on damage which isn't bad but theres less chance for other QOL or fun perks because you immediately need those better perks to survive. Every perk you use has a very good chance of getting tossed later because your build might inevitably change cause of how RNG works on purveyor.  
---
3. In the lower levels ammo and guns are already a massive pain. You run through ammo quick, yes you can farm yes you can buy but its almost guaranteed you're using more than one gun. Before you could carry a couple guns all of different ammo types so the ammo seemed slightly less scarce. 
---
4. Enemies scale with your level now. The "lower level creatures" are your level. 
---
5. Even if you're shredding things its pretty much guaranteed they're shredding you. 
---
Just wait until you have to do the main quests. They got noticeably more difficult solo.
---
\+33% vats hit chance is a magic effect for shotguns in vats.
---
As a casual player this is a adjustment. It is nice that fights aren't ended within a breath anymore but a few events really kicked my ass solo and boy was I unprepared. The Brahmin escort mission blew my mind, a pack of what felt like a hoard of level 100 dogs just melted the poor brahmin before i could even drop half of them.
---
Just gotta relearn some things and adjust.
---
Okay. Hope they do it soonish haha. Thank you for the info
---
I don’t visit the purveyor until I’m close to max script, or at least have 500 to get all the modules. I visit the legendary vendor multiple times per session to get rid of the weight of legendaries I don’t want.
---
Yeah, eso has its faults but I like it just wasn't Skyrim, same engine etc. just online. Kinda wish 76 mixed things up more than they did, because for me; much of the end game is just not engaging. Even if all the quests in ESO are the same in many ways, there's literally so many I feel like I am doing new things. I have put in over 600 hours in eso and never finished the base main game. Where as in 76 how many times can you photograph black bear lodge and the crater or hear Ward whining "Finally someone with the guts to help out." And I thought the Division's end game was redundant.
---
Still another 15m to reset...
---
How do you even complete that shit? I tried with myself (290lvl) and my boy who is (647lvl) we died constantly.
---
Exactly how I felt
---
It opens the map up, too, if you're low level that 36 cap travel fee gets onerous.
---
Charisma legenday perk. I thought I could share higher level perks. I was wrong.
---
if it let you stack different types of chems it might not be too bad, like no you can’t stack two different psycho effects, but two different ones could be nice.
---
I'm getting "This Item Is Currently Unavailable For Use", anyone else?
---
You're made up numbers sound.....well made up.
---
Full bloodied with 2h doesn't 1 shot anymore with all the perks you state plus bloodied ones yet you do it without?
---
ghosts of tsushima is a masterpiece
---
Damn bro, it's doing you no favors in life and or your health, to be this salty/bent out of shape pertaining to someone else's actions (especially someone you don't even know). But since you decided to throw the ball in the court, I fell obligated to respond to your assessment of my decisions. So in the same breath that you are expressing distain towards a stranger spending his money on "imaginary train sets", you too are obviously way to concerned with said "imaginary train set". As a matter of fact, I would argue that your uncontrollable desire to belittle someone for what they enjoy, exposes you as the one with the bigger issues. It wasn't enough for you to just see my "imaginary train set", you had to take time out of your day to tell me how my desire to own the "imaginary train set" is a poor decision... So from my point of view, I would seek happiness in other avenues other than trying to degrade someone else's happiness. I guarantee you will have a much more fulfilling life having that kind of mindset. Hope you have a great day, I sure am... Cause I got my Imaginary Train Set... 💣💣💣 drop the 🎤🎤🎤
---
I got level 3 Ammo factory as well, now ultracite ammo looks appealing.
---
anyone test this while not in PA and a nuke zone.  taking a radshield along with this perk, how long can you run around in a zone?
---
yes, from Smiley at the Wayward
---
I love the patch. Could the damage use some more balancing? Yup. The point here was to get things to a baseline. The Daily Ops are fun. I did it with friends and p/u group. I like the Legendary perks. Not much to complain about. Everything was going in the right direction.
---
Its been like that since Wastelanders came out. Not sure they know how to fix it. Or, the change to additive with the damage stats was the first step in being able to figure out how to fix it. idk.
---
[You abused a bug then are now complaining that the bug was fixed and you are getting shit on for abusing a bug.](https://youtu.be/0lzqRVuRqN0)
---
No regerts
---
Ate a milky way first
---
I tried my shredder build (bashing with an empty minigun).  It didn't work well vs robots that have armor pen.  But it will likely be great vs everything else, high hopes because it's the most fun to just be a lawn mower with an anti armor bash damage minigun.
---
It’s not a guaranteed 3*
---
Ah ok.
---
Your pretty high level.just read over your post but didnt see anything for swapping perks to change perk build.if you change your build around say 20 times 1 point each time you would be short 40 points just thinking on how this works
---
How many cards do you have that you havent scrapped because your maths seems to be based on scrapping 100% of the perks you have ever gotten
---
Well that would‘ve been 49 minutes ago.
---
oooo i like that: 1% wasteland.....im gonna start using that
---
Yes, you can open all packs and lose nothing. Just as always.
---
Commando is still #1 imo . Crit headshots are the name of the game
---
Exact same situation, brother
---
Well, wasn't quite headshotting everything, but I definitely empathize lol
---
i chose P.E.A.L legendary special perks, im loving what rads, though i am a smidge disappointed with survival shortcut, due to how easy it is to get survival stuff as a carnivore and knowing where to hunt for disease cure ingredients
---
2 people using junkies and 1 with AA it took 15 minutes. I recorded it.
---
Naw I'm not that new, but I am impatient in many aspects of my life, Fallout 76 being one of them. Truth be told, the $500 Microsoft gift card balance that I haven't touched since I received it was begging to have some spent.
---
It all depends when you stopped opening card-packs.
---
Until not long ago, duplicate 1* were removed when opening packs.
---
That has nothing to do with anything I just posted other than that you also used numbers...
---
Same with action girl.
---
Are you accounting for levels that you moved special points around and did not collect a perk card? Granted, I don't think you did that 200 times, but still, it could account for some discrepancy.
---
It's possible I was in fact looking at the wrong listings now that I think of it. Will have to check better at some point.
---
The other question is: Does it keep if you leave the server and come back to the same via player joining?
---
Bloodied melee builds are dead now
---
They needed a buff before. Now with One Wasteland they're almost unusable.
---
Did you ever move any ability point around instead of taking a perk card?
---
Not going to bother reading all that, but I can confirm that all of my perk coins were awarded correctly, and Bethesda did not **** me out of anything.
---
Well go back to your social life/college you will enjoy it more it seems, you are not helping your cause.
---
Damn that's deep
---
Im so pumped to beef up my char after work. I know now what my leggo coins will be for... Everyone getting inspirational today :))))
---
Absolutely.
---
And hear was my dum exited ass thinking it was a power amour hud or somthing
---
1pm
---
Now that update 22 is here.. It cost us perks points to unequip or change perk cards!!
---
Weight bench disabled as of 12pm 9/16.
---
I miss the NV deathclaws, the power of the 50cal sniper rifle and my bro Boone.
---
😂😂😂😂
---
It’s not uncommon for games that have a addition system to have some things multiplicative. 
---
The longer people hide this rather then be open and make a stance that some things are better at being left multiplicative the more Beth will do their own thing.
---
I understand that but, how do I only end up doing 200 damage when I’m going all in? That’s not balanced. Is my build just not meant to do Earl? It’s fine in any other scenario, though I have tried the queen yet.
---
Oddly enough I found the gutsies no bother - 2 or 3 swipes of my deathclaw gauntlet and they were done. They weren't hitting me hard.
---
It was the protectrons that gave me grief - took a lot more to kill them and they do more damage up close.
---
A round expended in auto or semi auto have the same ballistic data. This should be how it always is.
---
So I now think I see the point of this post as I've just run an ops with some clowns that ignored the objective while fighting adds while the clock ticked away. The moral of this story seems to be never underestimate the limits of human stupidity.
---
No they won't. It's not a dupe. They never took the vendors down before because of people losing stuff. They sat on it until the dupe went public, then they actually took them down.
---
goddamn that is going to be a monumental grind. I noped the fuck out of the Order of the Tadpole quest because I actually do have ADHD which kind of makes it hard to focus and follow with through some quests. 
---
So, first I have to finish that boring quest to get the full size pack, then I have to grind in other areas to get the bullion as well as grinding to get the proper reputation...I'm a lazy goddamn wastelander.
---
Why do people think level 100 molerats are tough? 
---
They are not. 
---
They are still weak and give you more experience.
---
I've already shut my machines down because I was getting caps for things selling, but no notification in the top left corner. It seemed odd and may be nothing, but I closed shop just in case.
---
I read the instructions and I didn't feel they were clear. It said kill enemies with melee weapons, but trying to kill them with Melee weapons alone was a recipe for fucking disaster. I died dozens of times trying to kill them with a selection of legendary melee weapons alone and it did exactly shit most of the time. Thank god for the other player in there wailing on them with his plasma gun or we wouldn't have completed it. As a level 135 there was no way I was going to kill all of those robots, (and it was a lot of lvl. 50 plus robots) with a super sledge, shish kabob or any other melee. First you had to wear the bullet sponges down and then give them the final whack with a melee weapon. no where in the fucking instructions did it say you had to do this. I agree, a little clarity would be helpful, I shouldn't have to google that shit.
---
I’m gonna miss playing whackamole at the air port with my furious super sledge
---
Oh no...
---
I believe those people just had bad builds, I run a tank build so I only have the basic damage perks with bloody mess and I kill enemies just fine so I don't know what they are talking about. Even my friend who is bloodied said yeah they hit me hard but really it only takes an extra bullet to kill in most cases so he is fine with it. He uses a fixer.
---
Regardless of what weapon you use, you should have the basic damage perks for that weapon. If not use AA, that will maximize damage with low base damage.
---
I fully support this OP.  Would also like Improved repair Kits to be added to the rewards more often.  To both the daily ops and earle events.
---
1pm est. Valseek stated it would be changing to 12pm est in the future to line up with other daily resets.
---
yup if i didn't have my VE .50 cal I would of died so many times.. and I run full health vanguard heavy build for my pve character
---
Upvoted for freaking justice, also I think you get an extra Perk Card pack before leaving Vault 76.
---
Bethesda is just being lazy, the only things they really can't account for is SPECIAL moved with the ''Move a Point'' option and Perk Coins lost by swapping a Legendary Card for another one(this didn't exist before update 22 tho)
---
If I changed my build one hundred and twenty times that would be something I would have remembered and mentioned.  I have not.  I have a fairly straightforward stealth sniper build that I've used since the game came out and wasn't planning on changing a thing to respec until after the dust settles from the damage changes and to compensate for legendary special cards.
---
Wow. Just saw angry turtle's video. It is A MUST at lvl 1.  Procs a lot even with 10% chance and robots can't kill you. Not even assaultrons. Thank you very much. Gonna pick this one in all my characters at lvl 1.
---
Yeah, it's mainly a theorycrafting process to consider if it's actually worth investing in those perks.
---
Team medic is actually very clever, and way better then 24 resistances I think. Thanks!
---
You never moved a single attribute point the entire game?
---
Ive been using shotgun vats since beta, i guess i never noticed the bug. Although it does seem like my shotgun does much more damage after one wasteland. Even out of vats
---
K.
---
Well no shit, but its a video game. So there ought to be a balance.
---
This was my immediate thought.
---
No problem!
---
Lol. Dude...
---
TBH I've been running a vamps mini and 50 for awhile now. My LMG is still bloodied for things that absolutely have to die though. Everything else was bloodied for messing around outside of PA with sneak but the only thing left that still rips is my handmade :(
---
Yes!!!  Was so happy yesterday sacrificing all those useless cards.
---
Give it time. Bethesda will see the numbers and adjust eventually someday.
---
I was ready to come back this season for the new changes but 2/3 of my characters are the hardest hit types (bloodied unarmed, vats sneak non-auto) so back into the vault for this game.
---
My 3rd character is my 1st and the most boring of the 3 so it's a no brainer for me personally.
---
Considering most builds and weapons got nerfed, that 15% is a must, if you can afford the points.
---
I only take it off to equip ricochet in daily ops.
---
&gt; On a related note, thank you to those true wasteland heroes who sell ammo in their vendors for 1 Cap. 
---
1 cap for everything except 2mm, which is what I use. 100 caps for full fusion &amp; plasma cores; partials dropped in bags around the camp, though with PA becoming more of a necessity in ops, that might change.
---
No. Just a plain old guy with most of the sniping perks. I really don’t want to have to be bloodied or a junky or anything in particular. I was doing quite fine before this update. I could go to the east side of the map when I wanted to be challenged or stay on the west for some casual game play. I could have understood some balancing but it seems way off now, especially for some of us more casual players.
---
What are the rate for it? It is straight gold or the notes
---
&gt; The high level player, if he were still there, would see the same ghoul, but he see it as a much higher level, probably 100.
---
That's the bit that I have a hard time believing will work. It's not going to essentially clone the stats to keep presenting it as a lvl 100 to the high level guy and a level 25 to the low level guy. 
---
Consider all of the bugs in the game that would be trivial to fix that they haven't done, and then consider how hard that would be to implement this scaling feature correctly. There is no way it actually works correctly.
---
Yes gunpowder should be junk!
---
Ps4
---
I don’t do math, it’s not real. ;)
---
The point of the math is based on theoretically scrapping every single card, it doesn't matter because the values should still match up and the problem is that they don't.  Even if I leave all my core perks unscrapped I would still be missing coins from all of those missing perk cards.
---
I run Nerd Rage+Emergency Protocols in PA and I could stand there and let the gutsys go ham and never die.
---
Yes, just one per day.
---
God, are daily ops going to be an everyday challenge for score now?
---
That's a lot of fucking missing perk coins.
---
I like the true survival aspect now. It feels exactly as you say but I'm enjoying the death at every turn better now than at start of the game. Because now I have legendary armor and weapons, ammo, aid, plenty of perk cards to switch up, and now Legendary Perks to boot. It feels authentic again. I appreciated your post but I have to say the change is welcome after 2yrs of being top of the food chain.
---
Why spend 10 seconds looking when you can just hop on Reddit, make a post, and wait for someone to spoon feed it to you. Works every time.
---
Are you sure you’ve accounted for the cards you currently hold in your deck?
---
Edit: nevermind, you did.
---
I’m level 370 and I have been playing since launch. I don’t think I’ve been hit that hard but can’t really tell until I count my perk cards.
---
Yeah my two shot MIRV is hitting considerably harder and it feels fucking awesome
---
you read it that way not my problem . Go buy some tampons seems you need em.
---
Well said - I’m finding this new One Wasteland a struggle to enjoy.
---
question: have you actually played to see how you like it?
---
Cause a while back it was stated here that animated cards give more points
---
I feel your pain. 20 hours in and was at 18% downloaded 😥
---
Over all I really enjoyed the scale to your level enemies in all the zones. However I do wish there were more of a mix of leveled enemies, such as say a couple higher level and a couple mid level and a couple lower level when you encounter mobs. Having every enemy be your same level can be a daunting task at certain levels. Same goes for the daily ops, there should be an option to do event as part of a team or solo, with the amount and level of enemies adjusting accordingly. I tried to solo the Burrows daily op and got my butt handed to me, I realize Bethesda intended for this and most of their dungeon content to be done as a team, however I think there is a significant amount of people that play casual/solo and these event are almost impossible for those type of players. Overall I think this patch was a huge step in the right direction and hopefully Bethesda will continue to improve the game so players of all levels and play styles will have an enjoyable experience.
---
I'm currently playing a level 15. It's not crazy hard but it's noticeable. I'm no slouch in terms of knowledge &amp; ability so you can imagine how it is for those that would have already struggled in the past or are slammed with a high level, really inefficient build that was barely able to get by.
---
I was anticipating this patch to balance the enemy levels on a scale, so that enemies who were originally like, level 1, would then balance to something like level 15 against a lower level player in the mid 30 range, so the challenge was slightly increased but still reasonable, keeping in mind which areas are meant to be easier. I was not expecting every single enemy in every part of the map I visited to be level 38 because my character was level 38. Suddenly jogging through Morgantown is like accidentally turning the wrong corner in Whitesprings.
---
Everything in the new patch feels exclusively tailored to higher level players. Daily Ops are for 50+ players but have taken over part of the SCORE challenges that used to be doable by all levels, so lower level players are at a disadvantage to gain that SCORE, and the new balancing system makes every part of the map feels unsafe. 
---
Some of the low level quests were already difficult to do because they would send you into areas where the enemies were grossly overpowered, but the way this is scaled means that every part of the map is almost too challenging if you get mobbed. I played with a friend last night who was level 30 and despite the "balancing" we were both getting completely wrecked in previously unseen ways.
---
The problem is this game is all trash mobs. So instead of adding interesting events or mobs, they just make everything tougher and less of a trash mob. 
---
Granted, I haven't tried it yet since I see no reason to play still. There still isn't anything to spend gold on, ops made it so stealth doesn't work *and* don't give any rewards worth going after so it's neither fun or rewarding, same with Earl.
---
Same boat as you.
---
Probably just everyone doing the new daily ops quests. Once the newness of that wears off, people will spread out again.
---
I like the scaling, but legendary mirelurks are scary as fuck
---
One counter for vendor reset
---
One counter for scrip machine reset
---
One counter for gold machine
---
One counter for daily challenges
---
On counter for daily quest
---
And now one other counter for daily OPS
---
Bethesda really want stay connected players connected 24h
---
Seriously, players want global reset of all counters and they add another one.
---
I went from head shotting everything from a distance on sneak as a sniper to now getting steam rolled by rad roaches. Thanks.
---
Wait whats a scrap box? You mean I don't have to be storing everything in my stash? I maxed out that 800 lbs so quick. I just got back into the game.
---
I’ll use your name anytime I like. It’s a public discussion forum. I don’t answer to you. 
---
You’re exaggerating the impact of the update and failing to make minor adaptations. 
---
u/Jack_O_Blades, you’re a panicker and alarmist.
---
Keep your ‘boy’ comments and their racist undertones to yourself.
---
True, however I was interested in his take on the damage balancing which came in patch 22. He said it wouldn't really affect instigating stealth characters and he was right. I have to two shot supers mutants now until adrenaline kicks in. I spent most of last night rebalancing for legendary perks to add demolition expert, gun fu, and grim reaper. So am looking forward to playing when I get home as I can swap between stealth rifle  and explosive commando
---
I havent been able to play since the update. This small update has my hyped.
---
The weight bench won't even let me use it at all, and I've been gone: do I need to store my vendor again?
---
but this is what everyone wanted.?
---
Level 41 rifle main and went from one shotting most enemies to taking maybe 2-3 shots each. Honestly not mad at the update! I always try to keep Fallout feeling a little dangerous by not maxing out my damage perks, using op armor/weapons etc since those make the game to easy imo.
---
I stopped opening perk packs once I found this out
---
I think the suggestion is that the fingers are too thick from 'palm' to 'back'.
---
It doesn't explain why you can still use a keyboard though.
---
I’m having mixed feelings.. 
---
My Einstein-level spooky-cripple-at-a-distance shotgun no longer works to stop mobs in their tracks to be dealt with at my leisure
---
 I’m burning through ammo like it’s going out of style: in two hours’ play 2k 556 and 1.5k 45 that would normally last days
---
Soloing Swarm of Suitors used 12 stimpaks 
---
Then again, beating the event required actual engagement not just one-shot everything
---
Nearby spawns my CAMP turrets used to farm easily are now demolishing my outlying buildings 
---
And I fear the game has become an ammo grind— very happy to have a Lead collector in my CAMP and nearby enemy spawns for collecting weapon scrap
---
Still, today I burned through more ammo than I collected supplies for making more.
---
Loving the legendary perks though, was able to max out a few SPECIAL to add a few helpful perks, and never never need to worry about locks or terminal hacking again.
---
I feel you, my internet sucks and can download at most 10gb a day. Doesnt help that my internet has been going off and on all week, so itll probably be a week until I can play :((
---
Shredder on minigun did not work for me last night
---
Also curious. Need me them solar panel plans. Lol
---
Any time! I’ve only run a couple ops so far, but it saves stims and lets you focus more on dps (less healing animations). Pretty good for a 1 point investment
---
It was so fun. I am actually stoked for this update. I know they aren't done; (too many casuals hurt by the update). But for the time being its like hardcore team mode. Did an earle, struggled [👍] and won!
---
No idea what you're looking for, my dude.
---
I'm sorry but this made me laugh, only because I've been there and that was *before* this update lol
---
Anyway I'm looking forward to starting a new character soon. The challenge seems interesting.
---
I'm in love with Absorbtion and Reboot.
---
Praise Todd!
---
I am neither and you can't accept that this update was horribly optimized for people who dont spend 100 hours a week playing this game. The amount of other low level players sayong the same shit as me is enough to tell anyone im not exagerrating shit.
---
It's more of a vanity thing and they are rare vs normal unanimated, but sure go for the people just want free stuff argument.
---
Instigating stealth rifleman
---
Not all new content is going to be easy. Daily ops were designed to pull players out of their comfort zone. Dont be afraid to try new things with your build. With damage cards being less powerful people need to focus on survivability more now instead of just mowing everything down. The electric absorbtion perk helps a lot.
---
Yeah I understand what to do, I just kept going in circles and stopping to get a couple off my back was death.
---
I think I got first booster done in about 4 min but never did find the second. I need to make myself a hand drawn dungeon map like it's the 80s lol.
---
I have been used to playing 76 where you don't really have to worry that much tbh.
---
There is. Semi is for better for people who are good at aiming. Full auto just spray and prey.
---
Also we've never played or spoken much nut I see you lots in chat. Looking forward to shootin up WV with you someday bud.
---
😂😂🤣
---
What builds?
---
I don't think anyone knows. Haven't seen any posts about it.
---
Feeling the same way.  I'm around level 160.  I was primarily a super tanky melee build through most of those levels and it worked great for me but last few months with wastelanders I've been trying to slowly re-spec myself to a stealth bow/rifleman build (while still holding onto my strength to melee when things go south).  I've been FAR from optimal, but I've still enjoyed toying around with range more.    
---
Log in last night, take over my usual camp of Dabney Homestead for a defense "event" and I get rushed by level 100 mirelurks and die about 6 times to a Mirelurk King that just owns me over and over.  I try range, and I'm just doing NOTHING to them. I switch to melee and I get eaten alive after a handful of swings.   
---
I end up spending well over 30 minutes struggling with a damn camp defense hiding on the roof of the barn getting a couple pot shots in before I'm spotted and then have to re-hide till i'm back at "caution" state.    
---
Now I feel like I need to respec back to my full on tanky melee spec to be able to play the game or something, but I don't have anything close to needed levels saved up to do it.
---
Because they are rare cards and not normal, tell me this is a holographic card irl worth more than a regular version?
---
V9?
---
I've got to say, you're probably the first person I've seen on here that ran bloodied before the nerf that ISN'T just coming here to complain. 
---
Congrats on finding something new that works for you and thanks for sharing. Have an upvote.
---
My idea is have some sort of algorithm that takes into account the map level cap (and turning off enemy caps at lvl 50), the total combined party lvl, and distribute the enemy lvls for more variety, i.e., your total party level is 500( a lvl 20, a lvl 80, a lvl 150, a lvl 250) as a lvl 250, you get 8 enemies, one being an area boss....and let that boss be a boss, like lvl 100, and split the other 7 by 400.  For anyone under 50, the enemy cap applies and it scales to your lvl. If this were the way it was done...you’d have a lot more high lvl players bringing in low lvl players to pull along.  I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been in a high level party and the lvl 25 guy gets booted.
---
Right now...it’s a shit show.  I defended a medium level workshop yesterday and there were 2 waves of anglers....14 in each wave...all lvl 50. Make one real area boss and some scrubs.  That’s just my thoughts.
---
I feel like this would be a lot more useful than the like 2 treasury notes you *might* get, which are then added to your infinitely growing pool of notes you're getting too fast to spend
---
aaaaand we have THE SAME UNKILLABLE-WITH-RANGED-WEAPONS ROBOTS, but in vault 94. Good job, Bethesda, good job...
---
Yeah, its getting like that and it's super appealing
---
I always wanted one haha If I had thought of it earlier I would’ve tamed one right before the update
---
Honestly a instigating guass rifle might be able to 1 shot slot of enemies. Would love to know
---
This is probably asking a bit much since we don't want the engine to shit itself any more than it already does, but fast travel cost should be calculated between the destination and the nearest free fast travel point.
---
Damn I didn't think about this. RIP bladed knuckles
---
Dude it’s day two. Obviously it’s a valid question now.
---
&gt; It would be discouraging to an inexperienced player. 
---
It's discouraging to me as an experienced player.   I died twice trying to get rid of the protesters at Grafton.
---
How did they ruin stealth? Follow through legendary perk makes the damage nerf not much noticeable. I kill stuff in 2 shots before and still kill them in 2 to 3 shots.
---
Yeah, I'm very talkative lol and WV?
---
Good for you?  You're either a fairly new or fairly "low leveled" player and wouldn't have been hit as hard by the bug that ate perk cards.  That or you're just very very lucky.  Your luck shouldn't override anyone else getting fucked by this.
---
Yes they are rare and I've actually gotten one outside the normal gold card slot before.
---
I am very glad that you’re enjoying it. Seriously,  no sarcasm. But I don’t like repetitive challenges, like leveling up daily, and I really hated yesterday’s Daily Op.
---
I think its 3 or 5 minutes.
---
Yes. I used it around 11:15 with no problem. After 12pm I got the same message.
---
They don’t buff weapons in this game 
---
Nerfs for everyone
---
Not on older TVs. And console scaling options don't always work. Until I get a new TV, if the game itself doesn't offer scaling, I just have to accept I'll be missing the very edges of the screen.
---
There's a question in the title asking what's the current deal with stealth sniper builds. That's literally it. I see people talking on here saying they suck now but other people say they're still fine. So I'm just left wondering who to believe.
---
I'm more of the mindset that xp &amp; loot is directly tied to successful completion of event. If event fails, you get nothing - no xp, no loot. Nothing. Watch how quickly people will be invested in successfully completing the event
---
That is some faith. Will they address it, and will they not shit the bed when they do? The track record is poor.
---
I feel that since things are harder (more time consuming) and cost more resources, the rewards should be better.
---
I keep bugging my tattoist to write 'No regerts' on me but so far they've refused.
---
Critters can be as high as level 5 now, but are super rare to find as a tamable spawn.
---
It’s the 1* only cards that you are missing
---
You’ve been playing this game for a week. You aren’t past the basic learning curve yet. 
---
At level 45 your build should almost be complete. Post your current build and let’s see how much you’re wasting on QoL.
---
I’ve got a stalker’s gauss and it’s working decently well still. Would love an instigating one though.
---
Are you on xbox?I can help you out to start you off.i started a new build and it's way better now than a year ago!
---
Haha alright I’ll check back in and see what’s up
---
Well, higher level enemies have stronger poison resist. However, in the forest, toxic valley and ash heap, they shouldn’t have enough to negate it.
---
Except ghouls. Ghouls have 500 for some reason.
---
No.  I think I would have remembered the time I respeced my character one hundred and twenty times.
---
I’m a level 92 and I ran though yesterday with my bf (lvl 112) and a rando lvl 70 and we finished in just under 16 minutes. I had a 3* troubleshooters power fist, he had a super sledge and wore power armor. 
---
I have a 2* perk that stims my teammates when I stim, so that was extremely helpful for everyone because I have a lot of stims to blow. I also had incisor 3* and martial artist 3* to help with my melee. 
---
You die a lot, but there are also a lot of walls and large objects to hide behind temporarily while you stim up. 
---
Anyway my whole point of this comment was to ask if you’re on Xbox and if you and your friend want to do a run through with me. I’m not THAT good, but I don’t have anyone to play with right now and it would be fun.
---
 "stay in the area of your lvl range "
---
have you actually played the update?
---
1pm ET. It has reset. It's robots again. Melee kill again. In Vault 94 this time.
---
Life is short, waste some money.
---
Buttressed is the best
---
Perks?
---
mfw my level 25 instigating double barrel shotgun can no longer one shot level 82 enemies :,v now it takes boths shots
---
The Jet Pack IS the mod.
---
I'm 100% with you, I like the scaling so far. I run a power armor heavy guns or shotgun build with no specific legendary requirements such as bloodied etc. Its been a nice change of pace having threats everywhere again.
---
Its absolutely garbage, "hey guys here's unlimited enemies constantly spawning and the last hit has to be a melee to kill them. ISNT THIS FUN!".
---
No, its boring and obnoxious. I got stuck in a room, trying to find Bravo because I didnt get two fucking seconds to look around and think because I was constantly spammed with enemies.
---
I recommend to get buttressed
---
Better yet, give us access to script out everything with no limits. They also need to increase the bullion limit as I am backlogged with both legendaries and treasury notes for simply and casually playing daily.
---
&gt;I am swimming in rounds
---
do you use heavy weapons? because they beg to differ
---
I wish you could turn on/off the scaled pve because its pretty balanced because with scaled pve you'd get, less xp, shit legendaries, less corpse loot, etc.
---
Instead of ANOTHER skin for the handmade, could they just straight-up replace them assault rifles with the R91 design?  That’s on the top of my mods for fallout 4, as I could never get over how ridiculous and cartoonish the AR looks.
---
Bethesda, please just universally reskin the assault rifle.
---
... if you wanted to replace the combat rifle with the service rifle, I’d buy two more copies of the game just as gratitude.  PLEASE.
---
I saw a post last night early morning about something having things taken and being message by said player and yeah I can get on it but not off it.
---
You can get another with increase resistances
---
fucking drop the resilient thing already goddamn it
---
Ah ok. Thanks for the quick reply.
---
 Vendors, display cases, and the punch bowl form what I’ve heard.
---
Im on pc if you want you can kill me im on right now
---
Thanks I knew I could add two things but was not sure what the other was. There are two entries for mods, the “buttressed” plan is what I was looking for.
---
Keep in mind that this is a service game  so long term is the goal so it an issue they had to address it
---
I love it. It gives it more of a fallout feel now that you can be killed by something anywhere. The ammo factor never bothered me and I run anti armor anyways because I’m too lazy to bother with upkeep for other builds.
---
West Virginia. Lazy typing is what it is.
---
Im chatty as hell too buddy! How's your camp holding up with new enemies around?
---
You would think explosive vents would do this...but nnnnooooo.
---
Are you guys so poor you can't even afford the 30 caps for fast travel?
---
EDIT: Yes downvote me, you poor poor people.
---
I had the same thing yesterday. There is a 5 min countdown from the end of the op. I haven't been to the burrows so got lost in it after fighting the boss and didn't read the report. Had to go thru my footage to see if there was a countdown.
---
I was hoping for a proper rotation on the mutations, shame
---
I hope its not random and we got the robots Alain. Dont like the robots.
---
I'm hoping things are balanced because I agree with you, if you're not running an OP bloodied build or have magic weapons or smt you're in trouble.
---
ive been searching for a place like that. thank you
---
Lets hope the health regen is in fact intended. I'll be really dissapointed if they change it now that i have invested so many perk coins into it. If they do I'll do what I have always done adapt and overcome.
---
Zero difference in vats as far as accuracy, recoil becomes irrelevant aswell. Vats cant benidnores because its a core mechanic of the game.
---
With that said vats makes it about fire rate and than AP cost to damage ratio vs
---
Auto costs half as much AP points and puts out twice the DPS before stealth,crits and headshots are figured in.
---
You end up doing like 4x the DPS using auto and when done right its 1-2 AP per bullet vs 10-15 for semi. Meaning nearly endless vat n use
---
You know. I asked a question that might have some validity to. As in, some of your missing coins could be accounted for that way. 
---
But I guess being shitty in response is what you like.
---
So I’m glad you got screwed and Bethesda isn’t likely to do anything.
---
Yes yes and more yes 👍🏻
---
OPS changed locations (Burrows to Vault 94). It didn't change enemies (Resistant Robots). 
---

---
Tried that first. Wet kitten farts didn't work unless they were literally at 0. Swapped to melee in the hopes of having a bigger margin, and it worked except for when it didn't and they ignored a few swings worth of damage (to be clear, they did the damaged animation, but no loss of life). Between that and having to chase each one down, when they all spawned in different directions... yeah, nah. Waiting to see what today's is.
---
Yo the way you worded this reminded me of drake and josh with josh's gamesphere.
---
Spherical. Spherical!
---
Lol
---
It is a magic one.3 star quad ammo cap with faster moving while aiming and 40% extra bash dmg.
---
Its more pwerful than my fully modded 3 star quad cap guass shotty.which was at 504 dmg and now is 176.boo hoo hoo.still with those setups and my perks et,i have not seen much difference.only in my rifles.
---
if you camp loads slowly, players can get to your vendors before the doors have loaded.
---
Just move them to a higher floor so the whole camp has to load in.
---
Because people wouldn't shut the hell up about the added bonus, so Bethesda is taking it away.
---
I dunno, I feel more like Rambo when my knife explodes everything in my face
---
Because whales are bad.
---
From your link:
---
&gt;You may find that some games still seem to be cut off on your screen. At this time you'll likely want to adjust the UI parameters within the game's menus. Not every game offers this feature, but some like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt do.
---
If only FO76 were like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.
---
Daily Ops are a lot of fun and the world is certaintly a more intimidating place now.
---
People got the nerfing blues so you might see some whiners but overall i think the latest update is awesome.
---
I would have preferred this option, because as a lower level character without a fully realized build and just terrible weapons, this new "one Wasteland" is like playing Dark Souls. It's not "hard" per se, but it's time consuming to mow your way through even small camps with limited time and resources.
---
If you gave me the option to play normal server until I reached level 50 or higher, and then I could go to a One Wasteland server, I'd do that no questions asked.
---
I wasn't complaining. I finally have time for Ghost of Tsushima. 😭 Been waiting so long to play that.
---
The best part is that they warned about this in the patch notes. Dude could have logged on and made a new blueprint but he missed his chance by not reading.
---
A- ammo factory...?
---
I can see the devs reading all these complaints saying “why don’t they put on troubleshooter armor?”
---
Does the robot hacking perk actually work?  Might be great for this. Never bothered to try since everything dies instantly.
---
Wonderful! Thanks.
---
Isn't red dead and gta online because you can buy in game money with real money so it come under normal gambling laws In each country. Red dead one had online poker and I dont remember any problem because you couldn't buy in game money with real money. I would think fallout it ok as you can buy atoms for the atoms shop but you can't buy caps. Anyone know if that correct or if I'm well of the mark.
---
I wish the section you bolded surprised me.
---
Yeah sounds good DM me
---
Both bloodied.
---
Interesting that they don’t give you a countdown. 
---
Well, it was already a great game when you quit, and it's 10x better now.
---
You really are the world's okayest dad. Keep doing gods work ✊
---
I think any enemy that takes less than 6 hits to kill is nothing close to tankey. 
---
Only bosses are bullet sponges.
---
Idk 900 .50U rounds/craft  are kinda nice
---
Why would I use vats when I’m so far away it will miss almost everytime when I can free aim and put 2 in the dome.
---
It was something new for console, but now we got robots and resilient again. Hopefully they rotate tomorrow. I can imagine it becoming repetitive quickly otherwise
---
This. I stopped playing F4 because immersion is broken when an enemy, let's say, a raider, can tank eight or ten bullets to the head. High level enemies translated as high level sponges.
---
for the lulz
---
Which sucks since we have to close the distance and we’re taking damage the whole time, that arbitrary second hit makes mob control a real pain as a melee build.
---
did gauss shotgun get nerved that hard?
---
Well at times I share my screen to friends to show them the funny animations of some of them and it's like normal card collecting to me in a sense and I eventually want to have all my perk cards in their slots animated. Additionally, I swap my perkcards very frequently to optimize base on situations so I look at them ALOT haha.
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
Stop fighting all the robots and focus on the objectives. Don’t get bogged down in the mass combats.
---
Why must *every* game be difficult though? I understand making it so that everything isn't a pushover, but leave the really difficult stuff as optional content for big rewards. I don't want to always have to treat every fight as a tedious struggle.
---
So it's 1pm EST. Got it, thanks!
---
No, be happy for me. I'm free now. One day maybe you'll have the courage to let this game go as well.
---
I have noticed a bug of 'sneak attacks' not going through in vats.  Or at least I don't see the little message pop up.  Have you tried sneaking out of vats?
---
I played 2 sessions yesterday..
---
the first session felt good.. lower damage of course and some vats issues as well but it felt ok..
---
second session about an hour after the first.. I could swear adrenaline and gunfu were not working..
---
in my mind after killing 1 mob(in this case a scorched at Camden park) the next shot the damage should increase due to adrenaline and or gun fu.. but it was going lower
---
this happened everywhere I went in my second session.. of course I checked reddit right away and nobody was talking about it.. so I can only assume I'm going crazy...
---
I had a full auto vampire's pipe pistol on my rifleman/heavy. It was fun, but with no perk points it's not going to be doing much now.
---
No just rifles and pistolas.lol.sorry.
---
I have a shotty/non auto rifle build.magic shotty,guass shotty,explosive handmade,fixer.
---
Adding bullet sponges is a sign of bad game design. Please shill for Bethesda harder tho
---
Because people wanted harder content. When you get to a certain point in the game very few things are a challenge really
---
But now Vats feels more clean when breaking limbs with Modern Renegade and Tank Killer.. Just shoot some limbs and take a photo with your new friends
---
Furious suppressed combat rifle
---
Yes, this!!!!!
---
After patch logged onto my level 200 and thought the update was decent.  Needing of some tweaks but overall okay.  Then I logged onto my lvl 12 and was ready to quit the game.  So far imbalanced for me that it's not even playable.  All my ammos and aid gone very rapidly.  This is not the way to attract and keep new players Bethesda!
---
One for your ally daily quest also
---
No kidding. I kept a set of knuckles or otherwise lightweight unarmed weapons for every enemy type. Even though my instigating power fist was always better at stealth one-hit butt punching.
---
Pretty much. I think the animal perk that gives you more meats and bits when searching them will get you 2tick blood instead of 1 as well
---
Because the game needed more challenging content, especially for higher level players. Daily Ops are not meant for everyone.
---
Piercing Gaze is a PERMANENT modifier for Daily Ops.  There are two modifiers each time, and Piercing Gaze will always be one of them. Notice how it says (Default) next to it in the list. Bethesda very clearly does not want people to use stealth in the Daily Ops.
---
i notice you edited the part of your previous comment where you said "not on consoles", which is the part my posting of the link was in response to. why is that?
---
After the huge download yesterday I just had enough game time to get my challenges done and go through the daily op solo, my non-bloodied unarmed build is still doing decent damage, all the whitesprings ghouls went down in one shot except the lvl l00 bloated glowing one, 4 more builds to test though
---
Run daily Ops... I end up with a fuck ton
---
Ps4 but thanks
---
no. unpowered vendors still work as normal, they just dont show up on the map.
---
Wow, look who gets their feelings hurt easily.
---
Ppl come back after big patches and this game has alot of toxic players in general so you'll just see more
---
I guess so
---
I'm sure it's satisfying to the players who crave constantly challenging combat but I think they've grossly over estimated how many people are playing this game with that mentality. 
---
Those people should be catered to as those tend to be your "hardcore" audience, yes. So something should be done to keep them happy. But there's no way in hell the majority of people who are playing this game think this is a good change. Not a chance.
---
Ohh lol 
---
Holding up fine as always lol what's your PSN?
---
My stealth rifleman is doing fine. Stealth Suit and Escape Artist and I have not had an issue killing mobs. I'm not even going to bother with this weeks Op.
---
To better reflect my meaning.
---
Why is it always people who use long ass complicated maths to try and expalin that in thoery they have been fucked around are the ones who have these problems, yet everyone who simply scraps 10 cards to get 20 points doesnt have an issue.  
---
Scrap a card, watch your counter, if you get 2 more points then cool, tge system isnt broken, if you dont then raise a ticket with bethesda.
---
This so much... Stand at A... Stand at B... If you're not working toward the objective you're working against it...
---
Is it? I guess it sounds nice...but the whole doing no damage thing isn't.
---
I was way past the learning curve before this patch came out. Just because I just started playing doesn't mean I haven't had friends playing it since launch. I've also been playing bethesda since morrowind. I have one character my build was half Qol/Rifleman. It was great for my play style. Now its useless. like not slightly nerfd but completely useless. It really sucks I feel like I've wasted the past two weeks. thats why I'm so upset with this update. and lots of other casual players are too. I have no great weapons or armor. before that was fine now its a resource death sentence.
---
Bloody is super useful, dont use ts shotguns, it fires one more pellet, not one more round. For shotty id use junkies or instigating, maybe antiarmor will be good now, havnt tested it. Furious is good for bosses since each pellet counts as a hit.
---
I saw it briefly as a quest but it didn't stay up.
---
Because I’m not going to break it out when I don’t know what you’ve done wrong. I just know looking at it napkin math it’s completely wrong. You’re trying to say you’d have 1,818 coins at level 474, enough to cap 6 legendary perk cards. Something I know Bethesda would never allow and what I’m personally seeing as a level 611+ character.
---
Also that final bit is not what you’ve been saying your entire rant, you’ve been saying I should have 1,818 perk coins! while calling for Bethesda employees to come figure out your math for yourself. At level 50 you’d have 35 perk points to convert to coins meaning at level 50 once you’ve assigned all your points to the available SPECIAL you’d only have 70 perk coins to dole out, plus the 50 Bethesda generously gave you.
---
I’ve heard this feedback as well on other posts, seems the scaling they did has really hurt leveling.
---
Thank you so much for this response! You probably singlehandedly saved my interest in starting one of these builds. I'm not a crazy numbers person and I don't mind if some enemies take more than one shot to kill...though one shots would be nice!
---
I'm sure daily ops are a mess for stealth snipers but like you said, I'd just put myself on bashing duty for sure.
---
By the way, as a stealth rifleman, do you know if single shot rifles and bows can be run side by side? Or do the bow perks take too much away from the rifle perks?
---
I was going for a bloodied since the damage is good but im getting my ass kicked lol
---
Of course my build isn't perfect but it has some good damage
---
You can't generalize the amount of hits needed to kill. Need 6 shots to kill a roach? -&gt; It's tanky as sh#t. Need 6 rounds to kill a deathclaw? -&gt; It's made out of paper.
---
I highly suggest tjat mod I use if you are PC. A literal game changer and makes the game not only more challenging for your character but also allows the enemies to not be walking around clueless and do less damage. I love it.
---
Vault 94 was way faster. Objectives were closer. Troubleshooter armors ftw.
---
With all the points in strength taken up, am I sacrificing perks like bandolier, etc.  I want to do this build as well but keep my weight down
---
did you get the SCORE? If so, then no, that is not the auto-complete glitch.
---
Yeah, if I wanted to play Destiny where it’s impossible to feel powerful with enemy scaling, I’d go play Destiny.
---
Power fantasy is a big reason people play games like this, they want to feel god-like in certain zones.
---
I imagine it would also make stealth melee much more difficult.
---
6 shots on a hunting rifle or 6 with a lmg?
---
Ironically my example is course to the same lol
---
Are you telling me not a single thing on this list makes you happy? If it's just one good thing, it's a good update. One Wasteland helps me play with friends, it is absolutely not fun **at all** to play with my lower leveled friends, who just watch me decimate their ghouls for them.
---
My unyielding armour set used to allow me to share rank 5 cards despite me only having 6 charisma back before they nerfed it. So its definitely possible for them to allow legendary charisma,  Coldplay team charisma, or even magnetic personality perk charisma to add to perk sharing, just depends if they want us to share perks so easily with each other!
---
that would make you go through the game faster and thus log out faster as well, this would not go well on the game engagement reports for the shareholders

The new war glaive weapon has insane base damage. Rivaling even legendaries with a standard one
---
it was the perk i was most excited about
---
&gt; I think the issue is that if the enemy doesn’t die in one or two shots they will detect u after that and alert all nearby mobs
---
I feel for many players this is user error not game error.  If we use the spot light example.  When you hit someone and they don't instantly die. a spot light goes up on your location.  The size and intensity depending on your agility and sneak cards.  If you continue to stand in that spotlight, of course the mobs will find you.  But if you move into the 'darkness' again (and have the card so your movement doesn't make noise) then they will have  MUCH harder time finding you.  
---
I have had no noticeable issues with my stealth. (Outside of Anglers but they were always nasty) in the new patch.  
---
&gt;  a byproduct of not being able to kill things fast enough anymore
---
If anything its more that you can't overpower your way through bad habits anymore.
---
They aren't, but for some reason bethesda has given us to ot that take a melee to kill fo two days in a row. The most complained about combination in the PTS. Everything else is a breeze.
---
Dude i can taste the salt from your post here, your a spoilt brat who doesnt like that cheating sometimes has negative consequences
---
Block works you just gave to server hop after.  It doesn't ermine them dromm the server if you are already on the same one
---
I just didn't want to waste my time if the build was completely ruined by the update. For the most part, I play the game the same way.
---
Anyone else getting "This item is currently unavailable for use" when trying to use it today?  Worked fine yesterday evening for me.
---
Tried moving it, storing it, scrapping it and placing a new one but still same issue preventing use.
---
Secret service can’t be shadowed.  That’s the one drawback.
---
full of hot takes today, are we?
---
Yes.it did.but it still hits really hard.
---
So instead of 2 shots it takes 4.
---
git gud and learn to one shot robots with melee
---
I’m going to smash my head into a wall
---
I’d put money on the Radstag getting killed by the Snallygaster, and the Mirelurk finishes the Snallygaster, but only just.
---
When a level 50 wolf takes like 10 shots to go down you can tell the update is BS.
---
Oh no, you're definitely not petulant, that's why you were so eager to jump in and shit on my problem with how awesome you are.
---
You should check your own math because unless you just opened every single perk pack you've ever earned recently you've DEFINITELY been having perks disappear without ever noticing it and are likely out at least a hundred perk coins at your level.
---
But hey, maybe you like getting fucked over and won't bother checking just to spite me or some weird shit like that.

Red Dead online has premium currency but that isn’t what was used for gambling (and unless things changed there is no way to convert gold bars to money), but it still was region locked.  That was one of the biggest complaints was people being upset that real money wasn’t even being used.  
---
Probably a bit of regulators not necessarily understanding video games and simply saying “no” rather than bothering to, and it not being worth the time of the developers to fight with them
---
I’m bloodied and it’s not too bad. Just can’t one shot cars now lol
---
I managed to find full set of 1-3* heavy combat armor troubleshooters (chest was actually sentinel) from my scrip legendary mules :) Doing great job :)
---
It’s only hard when the FPS drops into single digits.
---
Sneak and crit are additive now.
---
Unless you're instigating as well i doubt you 1 shot anything.
---
Edit:oh wait, are you commando?  That stealth still works
---
The weapon displays don’t display the super sledge
---
Absolutely. If you plan on getting Fallout 1st, you'll have unlimited scrap storage. You'll still run into issues with the stash box limit but that shouldn't happen until you're at least level 50+
---
Quit division too soon to relate, end game wise I agree though, also sad some of the random quests you can find is just a one time thing in 76
---
But just the pure exploration aspect in fo76 is the best imo
---
Or, just don't do the ops. There aren't any rewards, and it's just a resource sink.
---
Seems like it
---
How is the update? Are the nerfs making it difficult?
---
Don’t Ghouls get healed via radiation? Could add health regeneration when exposed to radiation, but of course this would also increase your rads so you couldn’t exploit to get to full health as you’d have rad damage.
---
I haven't had as much fun playing as i did last night since the beta launch when everything was new and exciting.
---
yea, it's fucking hard to deal with the robots if you are a stealth sniper build, so what, do your best, let the guy with the deathclaw guantlet finish them off and you can melt them down.    the freeze version is going to suck for the mele guys, and the chameleon sucks for everyone.    i love the fact that it's challenging and you have to work together.
---
i do kinda miss being able to go to the forest and one-shot everything with a pistol, but honestly, being able to get maybe useful stuff everywhere is a worthwhile payoff.
---
Yeah my build isn't complete and it isn't perfect. I also don't have godtier weapons
---
i want to get a better feel for one wasteland and my damage output before i jump back in to SBQ/ACP. i've done them both so many times pre-patch anyway... how many more cursed pickaxes and ultracite plans do i need
---
Comparing this to the previous v94 vault runs bring a part of a team for daily ops is super easy. You join a daily ops squad and you can join their instance of the op at any point they are active. That's a big deal.
---
Second, it's more about staying near the objective and staying alive. Killing should be less about clearing a room and more about staying alive. Hide behind things and shoot to survive. 
---
As for it being hard, I think that's the goal. It's hard but it's not pressing like v94 was. Ive done daily ops a dozen times in PTS and twice since its offical launch all finished at max rank. There is a way through but it takes a build worthy of it along with team mates who do the objective.
---
Yup. I think i may have to be more of a hermit now. During covid. Damn
---
At what level and context/gear? I kill them in 2 swings with my sledghammer.
---
The thing is, countries that ban gambling in games and/or a 'monetary transaction friendly' loot box system for reasons other than religious, often have some sort of gambling commission. They are tasked with regulating real life gambling, in casinos and otherwise. I wouldn't be surprised if their higher ranking employees would be enjoying some kickbacks for cracking down on that stuff in games.
---
Your mom paid...120$ just so you can show off on a social media?
---
Man those kids nowadays.
---
Tomorrow you'll be complaining about how there's nothing to do in this game.
---
GG!
---
The fact that you still think it’s hard to gather ammo and Stimpaks shows me you’re not past that curve. 
---
I have a character at around your same level with only 1 combat perk and no special gear. He’s had no problem since the update. 
---
I have a level 12 that does have some combat perks but no special gear either. No issues on that character either. 
---
The only character that I’ve even noticed any challenge difference is my main. 
---
So if my low level characters aren’t having any extra difficulty but my highest level main is noticing some mild extra difficulty, then my experience supports my position. 
---
Again, post your build to get some advice. Or are you having more fun complaining than you would playing the game with more skill?  Which ‘game’ do you want to play?
---
Big if true
---
Definitely lower Intelligence as that’s a common penalty for Super Mutantization.
---
That's not a magic legendary effect. Get yourself a +50 limb damage or a piece of armor with the "reduced damage while blocking" effect. 
---
That triggers the magic.
---
Damn, you caught me
---
Yep mine just stopped working, think it's because there was an exploit with it
---
I’m a sniper. Why would I try and get close to enemies with a long scope. The entire point is to kill from range. If I sneak up there is no point of being a sniper.
---
Pleeeease pleeease please don't start asking them to nerf the new ENDGAME content already.
---
Those of us who have been around since beta, have all the god tier gear, need content that is *not* trivialized.
---
Without difficult content, this game is at best a pointless grind.
---
I agree with you, the only time I had this happen to me was when I got home from work approximately 4 hours after the reset and hadn’t been on since the night before. Logged on and my challenges were autocompleted (all but 2).
---
I find that hard to believe, my bloody is doing at least 50% damage it was.  I hit the Yaoguai outside of Dolly Sods, in stealth with 3x and a crit it took 3 hits. A basic 1 * scrochbeast I found on the ground took at least 10.
---
I just got a mental image of four Yao-Guai with Ace Ventura hair running at me yelling, "Allllll-righty-then!"
---
You would have to swap between perk setups to run both effectively.  I don't think any of the cards overlap.  My perception is maxed at 15 because of all the cards I needed to take.  I don't even run some because I ran out of room.  You can avoid the sway card but slapping stabilized on both your arms.
---
And you're just flat out ignoring everything I said so you can ran to yourself.  Well I can ignore you too, there's even a button for it.
---
The gauss shotgun is going to take you a while to reach ally status with foundation, so that helps a lot with your priority.  I would then focus on earning the gold to craft the secret service armor from Regs (and then the mods) first.  Then hopefully you will be able to get the gauss shotgun plan from Samuel in foundation and craft that, and then get the mods for that weapon
---
PA and Vampire's Minigun worked for me. Also threw on The new energy absorption legendary perk for health regen when fired at with lasers. My 2nd daily ops was solo, 7:42.

---
This is a bug so ingrained in this game that I honestly forget about it. My subconscious just knows not to tab out when loading.
---
All in all though, there are other bugs that I'd hope they address before this one (looking at you, fast travel bug).
---
Combat shotty with bayonet. Your welcome.
---
Ok, so it was unlikely that it would be the same enemy AND mutation on back-to-back days...but it happened anyway! We want to give you all something else to dig into today, so we're going to manually reroll today's Daily Op to a new mutation and enemy type. Hang tight!
---
As a note for the future: The location won't be the same multiple days in a row, but randomness does allow for that to happen with mutation and enemies.
---
I love hard games. Bloodborne and dark souls are my favorite games. But those games are balanced by being FUN and the difficulty feels intentional and rewarding. The difficulty in fallout 76 feels strictly like a mistake. There’s no reward. Just more grind and everything just gets worse and worse lol. It’s absurd.
---
Does luck of the draw III work well enough to never repair?
---
I figured it would be Per and the Foosball would be Agi.
---
Yep, you can thank everyone who had to run on here and post about it
---
They seem to have disabled it to keep people from stacking it for infinite strength
---
Rip your gains
---
Dude, I’m not even being disrespectful. You’re simply mad because your math doesn’t work out and someone that has direct experience and is your senior level by nearly 200 levels is telling you is wrong yet you still won’t listen.
---
Absolutely childish behavior.
---
I'm interested to see if the meta changes at all. I do doubt it, stealth commando is still pretty strong. It's a good excuse for me to put down the stealth commando build for now  and play with some other stuff.

---
It's more frustrating that today's daily ops also has the resilient mutation.
---
Just like yesterday...
---
Yeah we would shoot them down to a sliver. Then bash with a gun.
---
Edit: also we learned to ignore as many as we could. They are a time sink. The real deal was just staying alive to uplink the transmitters. Then kill the boss.
---
I want to be able to put ammo in vendor for a fraction of a cap like 3 rounds for 1 cap or half a cap each if Bethesda is taking suggestions.
---
Daily Ops more like Daily Op
---
Says the guy that argues he still 1 shots........with a fatman.
---
Back to your cage troll
---
Did Uranium Fever last night. Saw a 3* level 100 glowing mole miner and got a nice max level 3* Junkie's weapon. 👍
---
You mean you don't love talking to Jack at the Pumpkin House and having level 75 mutant hounds chew on your ass mid convo?
---
Or being chased by level 50 radrats strolling thru the forest..
---
Or having your leg crippled by a surprise molerat nipping at your balls?
---
But yeah, I was given a vampire mr handy buzzsaw. It was much more fun before One Wasteland to use. MUCH more fun.
---
Shh don't tell them they might nerf it xD
---
it's a little late now yo..
---
This turned out to be untrue lmao
---
I was hoping (or at least going under the assumption) that RR was similar to other DR.  Where you basically take 50% less rads when you have a resistance equal to the value of the attack.  So if 1000 rads equals 60 rad damage, then 1000 rad resistance would reduce then rad damage to 30 (which isn’t survivable of course) then you get into the diminishing returns.  I simply don’t take a lot high rad damage for me to even test it that often.  
---
I’m starting to think to, that What Rads could be fine if I don’t feel like wearing secret service, and more likely better to rely on Rad Sponge &amp; Ghoulish with my friend.
---
I hate this. I am having 0 fun, but at least most people like em.
---
Im a veteran fallout.player.i started a new new vegas run through.i know better,but i always avoid sloans quarry.lol.i run all the way around it.
---
I swapped to a forest right arm, and the resistance popped up. It needs to be all matching 100%
---
I do the same for Stimpaks.  I'll have to go on a run to see if its changed all that much.  
---
I use a 10mm silenced automatic pistol.  Its a nice break having a truly silent weapon and just wandering the low level areas.  I'll have to see if it's still viable...
---
Fair enough, you've sold me on it. I'll just have to suck it up and get on with it then.
---
It's op af once it pops
---
It took me 23 minutes.  Didn’t get any rank
---
I just learnt how any why it happens yesterday. It’s a bitch of a bug.
---
Go play something else then. Fallout universe is harsh, you think this is hard? Go play the classics. 76 is a walk in the park in comparison.
---
Do you not understand that it’s impossible to not nerf everything when you change multiplicative to addition? 
---
It’s a much needed change wether you like it or not. I don’t know about you but when I work with numbers addition is so much easier to work with.
---
With the legendary perks working multiplicative along with nerd rage still giving a 20% to total damage damage didn’t decrease that much except for melee but I still see people in ops one shooting robots with melee so nothing has changed except you have to build smarter.
---
The damage calculation system was changed to make it easier to adjust, stop treating it as something more malevolent.
---
Why is it I can show you exactly how many perk coins I should be able to earn with the math to back it up but you'll just take someone saying "Nah, I got enough" at face value?
---
That isn't "long ass complicated" math.  It's really quite simple and I went out of my way to annotate it to make it as easy to understand at each point as possible.  
---
If I scrap all of my unused perk coins right now I'm STILL going to be several hundred short.  I'm not going to have over two hundred coins just pop into my character as I'm scrapping perks.
---
I can finally move my camp where I want to have it, and not feel like I need to keep it in the lower savage divide for the sake of lower fast travel costs. 
---
I can live in the forest in peace (or at least with the level 50s instead of the level 5s...)
---
I’ve been trying to download since last night and I’m only on 24% so I know how it feels. Shitty internet is frustrating. I said I’d give this update a try but I’m really not that excited anyways though
---
I’m with you. I have 2 characters over 100 and it feels fair on them. That’s why I said low level, like enemies shouldn’t level up to you until you’re higher than level 20
---
1 chance per day so if you already got it earlier re running just gives normal rewards
---
I mean, they gave that to us. It was the original storyline of the game. Then they gave us more content with wastelanders. And will again with the BoS storyline when that gets here. And we are getting all of that stuff for free. Between the original story and wastelanders, we have gotten more than $60 out of this game. And if they wanted to call it a day and focus on other titles, I’d be fine with it (disappointed, but I’d understand).
---
If you don’t want to bother with the seasons, then take a break. That stuff exists for those that want to continue playing while they make the new content. If that isn’t your, come back when the BoS storyline comes out. I did that for the two months prior to Wastlanders. Played Borderlands 3.
---
Its been in the PTS since atleast august 27...
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2aiPcVQCFBeQvR8QXp9blD/inside-the-vault-one-wasteland-preview
---
Ok so bethesda revert changes and also not going to add anything and leave it lake that so you can get bored in month and stop playing sounds fun right lets do it
---
Create an op team, wait 5 minutes as people will join, then start the op with a team.
---
Sentry bots explode, Crippled bots explode, and Legendary robots explode after death. 
---
Something I have noticed is sometimes while fighting non-legendary enemies I get the "Legendary enemy has mutated" notification. So I'm assuming (if its not marked legendary) that the game is recognizing them as such for some unknown reason and that's why they explode.  
---
My friends base was right outside of Watoga and we noticed this happening more and more frequently so just avoid any dead robots for 5-10 seconds..... sorry can't help more. Do you get the audio cue when they are about to explode?
---
I'll admit, I have no idea what I'm doing in this game.  I just picked it up last week and have about 35 hours into it.  Firstly, I love the atmosphere.  I'm a sucker for anything post-apocalyptic, and have always enjoyed the Fallout series.  When I read that they added more of a campaign to FO76, I was immediately interested, did some reading, and picked it up.  I really, really dislike PVP games, so I had avoided it until now.  
---
Levels 1-15 were incredibly fun.  It was a challenge, but not frustrating.  I didn't feel inept, but capable within the limitations of the environment in terms of ammunition and the like.  Then I fired it up yesterday, and I feel like I'm utter trash.  Fights that would have been a challenge two days ago are nearly exercises in futility.  I died five times at some Blood Eagle or whatever camp.  I hadn't died five times in total up until that point.  My weapons do virtually no damage anymore and I burned through 25 stimpaks over two gaming sessions of a couple of hours each, but in reality it was entirely through a few minutes of combat.  I abandoned that battle and logged out, losing whatever junk I had in my inventory.  So I decided to go back to the areas in the map from the earlier missions and explore things, maybe get up some levels.  I'm presently level 21 and getting my ass kicked by similar level enemies.  It went from being fun to being very not fun.  I'm sure that my gear is underpowered, though it served me just fine the other day.  I assumed that maybe it had to do with hitting level 20 and the game just becomes more unforgiving.  I have a bunch of stuff stored, that I got in levels 10-15, that require level 25 to use.  But even my level 20 weapons do diddly squat, it seems.  Even with perks.  The only way I do significant damage is with the sneak bonus, and it will still take most of a magazine to kill even regular Scorched.  Almost all of my armor is busted after my last fight.  I chew threw all my ammo at a ridiculous rate.  
---
I just tried to do the event where you repair the power plant.  That was a joke.  The turrets, level 21, annihilate me.  Clearly I am not playing the game right.  Now leveling feels like a huge grind, and I really dislike spending so much of my time finding junk to repair my shit.  One fight with more than a couple of enemies utterly trashes my armor.  I take loads of damage.  I can't craft shit because I haven't found any worthwhile plans for decent armor or guns.  I flat out suck at this game.  It's hugely frustrating, which sucks because I was having a ton of fun with it and even dished out full price to gift a copy to a buddy so we could play together.  Now I wish I hadn't.  
---
Oh well, I guess.  Back to Total War: Troy...
---
I'd say get a gauss minigun from the crater and use it as a 50 cal. Good damage, doesn't eat bullets and ally status from crater is fast and easy.
---
First time I saw the confetti it instantly reminded me of grunt birthday party from halo.
---
Ummmm...............I'm not sure I understand your accent, did you mean 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👎👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👎👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👎👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👎👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👎?
---
Yeah I got the score, just confused me
---
Unfortunately that a rookie mistake.. lvl1 to lvl50 the perk card unlock by your lvls so if you lvl up and there no perk that doesn’t benefit you , then you rank up a card or you save your lvl til you unlock a perk that does
---
Very frustrating that it doesn't work that way.
---
Yeah on fast firing weapons is a lot harder, the gatling gun is just nice cuz of its slow ROF.
---
I plan on using ultracite on my gauss sniper for the same reason - I don't go through it very fast... though I haven't logged on him to test his damage yet lol.
---
&gt;You just gotta play harder and adapt periodically which is rejuvenating this game imo.
---
I don't really disagree with anything you said, I just feel that certain weapon classes needed buffing in the face of an overall drop in damage and increase in enemy levels before they made this public, however a rejuvenated game implies there will still be a healthy playerbase by Christmas once everyone starts running out of scrap and ammo and it's the third time in one session their ballistic fiber hungry armor has broken.
---
If your other weapon has a magic effect and you use shotguns in vats then that would explain why. An AAE shotgun will underperform a magic shotgun in vats.
---
It wouldn't be so hard if they weren't resilient. It's so infuriating because I never bash nor do I have any kind of reliable melee weapon
---
it would be nice if these items gave buffs as well
---
Shooting Gallery - Perception
---
Train Set - Intelligence
---
Foosball Table - agility
---
Of course they are. Anyone who thought they were suddenly going to get to tag enemies that everyone instantly turns to focus fire were more than a little optimistic to say the least.
---
It was the after-reset run.
---
I want Fallout 5 to be the last Fallout, and I want it to be the greatest Fallout that has ever existed. BoS vs NCR. Takes place about 12 years after the events of Fallout 4, a wiser and stronger Elder Maxson vs the president of the NCR, who has advanced Pre War nuclear weapon research. The Brotherhood wants to seize the technical data because the NCR is corrupt enough the data may well reach the wrong hands. They’ve also been brutal against the smaller presence in the West, public executions and the like, giving Maxson even more of an incentive to go over there and kick their asses.
---
Great thanks I'll just slap that on my laser rifle
---
Do you run stealth at all? Commando is good for getting your damage per second up; adding stealth can double it further. Covert Ops + Sneak + Unyielding armor/high agility can add some damage to a commando build.
---
Thats actually a good idea. It would take almost a year to get a max rank legendary perks just from daily OPs. 
---
Or maybe 50% chance you get 1 coin, 25% you get 2, and 25% you get none. You should average 1 per day but if you are lucky you get more.
---
Yeah I agree as well. At least the weight bench gives a +2 Strength buff for 30 mins.
---
Then it'd be impossible to not rage quit
---
That sounds great.  Feel free to message me if you have any other questions about how the build should work with perks cards, armor, weapons, or even just stealth mechanics.
---
Yes a long while back in the public TEST server, things chmage. They also had it so non animated cards gave 1 coin. They all now grant 2.i think that is a much better system.
---
Mmm...Next time for Monongah Mine, try to access the event directly in your map, you can do this from anywhere in the map. If you're doing this for the Queen, make sure you're on your Power Armor or a radiation resistant suit. Best of luck! 😊👍🏻
---
Yeah,  he's grumpy,  and a coot, but he's beating himself up over things. He probably doesn't respond as interestingly to "brute force" cause those options are a little closer to how he's  been treating himself. Very confrontational... same reason the INT options have him snapping at you, you're trying to logic out his situation. His own logic doesn't add up and dudes riding some survivors guilt HARD.  He doesn't like you pointing that out to him.
---
than they will hit you with their website and you will just come here and cry about it sounds right
---
Yes but you can just select them while leveling up. They have no added value
---
It's a great perk for full health builds, and an absolute must-avoid on low health builds.
---
I was in your boat, however I plugged in max born survivor, max chem fiend, and wore a power armor.  I popped pyschobuff and just ran through the stupid burrows.  I didn’t engage as single bot, just let them hit me.  The Asstron was my only real issue, but someone recommended the glove from foundation.  That’s my next purchase
---
You sound immature. Stop it.
---
My motto, if you feel too seriously about a game, you might need a break
---
Power armor massively boosts rad resistance, but you’ll still need Radaway and some rad-x wouldn’t hurt.
---
I was fine with it until I got to the end boss.   Where'd all my stimpaks go?
---
I dunno, I had a pretty bad time doing Radscorpion Horde... nothing like 6 level 50 Radscorpions and a level 100 legendary jumping you.
---
yeah, its the hard and annoying mutation, but still managable. Personally i've completed burrows today like 5 or 6 times (to learn where actually i should go to reach objectives in time) without dies in bloodied build, as result - i've find out how to complete it in less than 8 minutes. Just use PA with emergency protocols + nerd rage + lone wanderer if you want to solo it and everything will be ok. If not - just group with someone, i'm sure if i managed to solo it on "elder" - 2 characters will be able to deal with it much easier. Yes, i understand that have no ability to kill enemies with ranged weapons is frustrating, but just vaporizing everything using gauss minigun every day would be too easy. So yes - just use some melee weapon. I'm using vampiric super sledge and its ok - killing everything in 2-3 strikes, allows to keep almost sustained without stimpacks.

There are plenty of ranged weapons that look like they'd be difficult/impossible to use in power armor and the game allows you to use them all so this is a weak excuse.  Even still, there could easily be a mod for those melee weapons to allow for use while in power armor or even some way to permanently weld them to your arm.
---
So only 20 days. Your point?
---
Hi, level 373 here (yeah I know, I've played too much.)  Here's a good tip for you and for anyone else struggling with the Daily Ops (and it really shouldn't come to this), but my advice would be to find a good Vampire's weapon.  I see people are having success with PA.  I'm not a PA build, I don't mind PA, I just don't use it all that often, I run Bloodied Stealth.  My first attempt at the daily op left me wondering WTF?  Then I looked in my stash box and saw a beauty - Vamps explosive 50 cal, with Ultracite rounds it packs a nice punch (my demo card on 5 helps with that too.)  2nd attempt- done in 10:08, 3rd attempt- 7:43.  Done solo.  Now I understand not everyone has a Vampire's explosive 50 cal at their disposal.  And this amongst a whole bunch of other issues with this new patch is a major problem.  I remember yesterday wondering about lower level players and how they are fairing with all of this... come on reddit... and sure enough, post after post from lower level players feeling depleted and frustrated.  But yeah a good Vamps weapon can definitely reduce the amount of Stimpaks you'll need and will keep you alive- didn't even die once on my 2nd or 3rd run and maybe used two stimpaks.
---
It's mostly the same with more content less bugs and more balance. You can respec perks so I wouldn't worry too much about starting fresh.
---
PA and a Vampire's heavy weapon. Take cover when possible, only worry about killing enemies close to you when defending the two booster and then the final wave. If necessary, practice your pathing outside of Daily Ops.
---
That extra strength sure would have been great for doing things like, say...... melee killing unending swarms of homicidal robots.
---
I'm enjoying it also!
---
Ok, I thought red dead was the same as gta, my mistake, do you know if there's any countries that have banned gta but not red dead.
---
Do you have a link to your actual build?  What mutations are you using?  What is the level of your weapon (is it actually max level)? Etc.    One of my characters is commando build using a mutant’s handmade and he does fine, he stealths around with his “bloodied” mutation and he does fine.
---
Why do you feel that it was sensible for Super Mutants in the Forest to intrinsically and invariably be drastically weaker than Super Mutants in the Mire? How does that make sense within the world or the lore?
---
Certainly, there being more dangerous creatures might attract stronger individuals or weed out weaker ones - but not to the point that one Super Mutant dies from a single bodyshot with a 10mm while another takes a dozen rounds to the head.
---
And while you wouldn't know it from the discussion here, One Wasteland still has a noticeable variance in enemy strength between zones - it's just not as ridiculous. 
---
Don't posit this as disagreement between people who care about lore vs those who don't.
---
There are places I am having more fun, and there are places that are just batshit stupid.   The robots at The Red Rocket have an asinine amount of damage + fire rate.  2 or 3 of them at the same time is almost instant death. They kill me in seconds, yet I can face tank being surrounded by 10 or more level 100 scorched?  This is stupid and not balanced.   There are mobs whose damage output are just absolutely ridiculous.    Having player damage output be nerfed and having some mobs that are overpowered is pretty lame, especially when trying over and over to complete an event.
---
BTW: I say this as a level 300 player with full set of modded secret service armor.  This is supposed to be the best armor in the game and 3 robots drop me like I'm nothing?   Stupid.
---
Just because I'm complaining about this one particular area, I am also aware of 3 or 4 other places that I went where the mobs were more difficult, but not too much, and the exp for killing them was a lot better than usual.   Running across level 100 super mutants at the Grafton Dam Event for capturing Mad Dog Malone was quite fun and much more interesting.  So they have the ability to get it right, they just need to get it right in the places where people are dying over and over and over again.  Maybe they should actually be evaluating the data of what is killing people repeatedly and check it out.
---
I only have the small backpack and I’ve heard you can’t put mods on it. Is that true?
---
Idk about numbers but I changed my stealth sniper/commando to bloodied a couple of weeks before the update so I am a bloodied noob. But don't see that much of a difference for bloodied that people are complaining about. They are still op and I am still not running out of ammo. So far I really like the update. Except perhaps for only one thing: the changes to the communist bunker. I refunded it anyways so it's ok.
---
This. If this was coming, it needed to come with Wild Appalachia or before Wastelanders. As it is they have fundamentally changed the way the game feels nearly two years into it's life and just after it (kind of) won over an audience who liked how it felt. The game almost had a reputation for how relaxed and slow-paced it was and it's more casual feel. Whelp. That's gone now.
---
Totally agree; I've finished all the Souls/Bloodborne type games myself. But the thing to me with those games is that you KNOW what you're getting into with those games, they're meant for that "hardcore" or whatever you want to call it challenge from beginning to end. 
---
With a game like this, you're talking about a wide subset of players and some of them want that big challenge, some (and very likely, the majority) aren't looking for that. They want a game they can go in to and progress through the quests/areas, see what it has to offer, and if at some point they decide they want a consistent bigger challenge, they know where they can go for that. But to change EVERY area in the game to be much more of a challenge than it was before in a game like this.....I just don't get it. So much more cumbersome for no real reward/purpose. I can't see myself continuing to play it if this is how it stays. I'm hoping sometime soon there's a weapons buff to go along with this to make level 50's easier to kill but even then, what's the point? These are just changes for the sake of changes that don't really "solve" anything other than making everything you fight require more bullets/stimpacks.
---
Oh, fuck.
---
Looks like you are way above the specials limit?
---
Edit - you maxed out legendary cards.  Got it
---
It doesn't even show up for me
---
Go melee. Its a blast. I loved it before and even more now.
---
I really like it. I’m almost kevel 300 tho with a fully kitted bloodied commando build so if they nerfed it by 75% I’d still kill everything in two shots. From what I’m reading snipers got heavily nerfed. No more one shots
---
Is respeccing new(ish) what about SPECIAL cards? Is there a way to acquire them all at this point? I remember when the game was new what you picked leveling up is what you had for endgame, or maybe I’m mixing it up with another game?
---
What a nice, meaty update.
---
I haven’t played the game in ages but one wasteland seems to be a complete game changer
---
Thank you for the upvote 😂. I expect people to be sour about the reality of the game. I still try to show a path forward.
---
Mmm... Either Gauss Shotgun or Minigun with their respective mods, after that Secret Service armor with jetpack and mods. However, if you have a good legacy or powerful weapon, you can go for the Secret Service armor first (not the power armor). 😊👍🏻👍🏻
---
Well thats just great /s Stacked my STG up to 100 last night, still couldnt get 1/3 of my previous melee dmg and it doesnt even reset for all lifts so after 30mins itll start decreasing by 2 every 30secs, hardly a sustainable boost. Was it broken? Yes. But with everything else thats broken was it really an immediate hotfix priority?
---
You win this one beefy
---
I’m so happy you’ve mentioned this because I was going mad thinking how am I going to find time to collect 2500 caps this week?! Lol thank you!!
---
Lvl 123 w/bits and pieces of SS with no mods. As a commando with a double shot explosive handmade it was super easy, 2nd try finished elder with 30 seconds to spare as a duo, could easily get under 7 with two more. I really don't understand how people are struggly so much with the op.
---
Scrap box is an unlimited storage bin for junk items that comes with the Fallout 1st membership :)
---
I think you're just too used to stomp enemies with your main character. I think you should be happy they're not lvl15 or 20, 40 or 60 levels above you.
---
Everything has had a big dmg nerf. I say big but it’s not that big. You’ll find enemies will tank a few more bullies than usual. Bosses being the bigger issue dmg wise. Perks are now additive as oppose to them being multiplicative as they were previously, being one of the biggest reduction factors. 
---
There are legendary perks now which may help you with further dmg increase. I’d recommend looking into those. In terms of weapons, if they were okay before they will be okay now. Perhaps look into a build change if you still aren’t comfortable? 
---
I am a bloodied sneak build and i don’t find too much of a difference dmg wise, more so on the defensive side with the consistent low health. 
---
Overall, I don’t find the update did too much reduction, however that’s because i already had a strong build.
---
Thanks all!
---
I don’t mean to be an ass but wasnt the fact that it was asked that those on the pts create a new character was to see how one wasteland worked for low levels? They asked for this specifically to see how it would affect them and the fact that every low level is now getting mega screwed seems like something that should’ve been brought up. It sounds like those would’ve been very prevalent and could’ve been mentioned so it would be fixed before the update released. Irk maybe I’m completely and they ignored it.
---
Thing better be a damn light. Gimme a lantern already Beth pls
---
I’m a sniper and it works for me.
---
Exactly what I’m thinking, you’ve just said it better
---
I was up north of nipton when this happened. I though I was safe but I wasn't.
---
I’m loving the update, the game is now much more challenging
---
What you mean elder bonus hasn’t reset?
---
I use my Junkie Deathclaw with weight reduction
---
Yeah just give me a perk that makes me immune to diseases inside PA.
---
I've been using an instigating grognak's axe and I seem to do ok on balancing weight and damage. If you're into the daily ops the War glaive, if you can swing it, is pretty good too. I've also had good luck with a tricked out instigating baseball bat too, but I like the axe a bit more.
---
&gt;At this point,
---
Lol it took you this long?
---
Anyone else got a problem where trying to use the weight bench just gives the message “this object is currently unavailable for use”? Ive tried moving it around my camp and for whatever reason my character just refuses to use it
---
Oh thank god. As a bloodied build I got my pudding pushed yesterday
---
So your highest character sets the bar for what slots your lower level has? 
---
How about if you have one at 150 and another at 200? Do you just get the 200 guy’s slots?
---
Oh no, high levels can't hang around the forest anymore for easymode faceroll gameplay. In exchange low levels can actually venture outside the forest without being killed by mobs 50+ levels higher then themselves, and people who actually want a challenge can have non-boring gameplay on most of the map.
---
Don't even need to be a melee build, made 0 changes to commando build, you just shoot them (they melt) and one tap bash to finish them off. This sub is making me realize how bad the average player is.
---
Was about to type something similar here but you beat me to it. Thanks!
---
It will be worse then bloodied, you won’t die as much tho
---
Where is the harm in asking nicely for a small change? Its better than sitting getting salty over people's suggestions and pretending to be some life messiah preaching about how to take bad things on your stride. You don't ask you don't get, Salty McSalterson.
---
Nope no crickets unfortunately, I do miss the raids, do all three challenges and then farm acid. You could could walk out with like 800 plus
---
How viable without vampire? Best weapon I have so far is a 2 star quad explosive handmade. Will definitely set the next few level ups to pick up dodgy and ricochet though. Gonna take a while but it'll be interesting to see what this build can do, I like the sound of it!
---
Good god could these clowns not finally put in a check on a purchase to see if the item being purchased is REALLY supposed to be for sale or not?  There is a flag for that, just do some damn error checking for once, Bethesda.  This is a ridiculous bug to have to keep dealing with it.  
---
Make a completely different inventory list for items that are for sale.  Moving items to a completely different list breaks the link that you guys keep screwing up.  I shouldn't have to take down my vending machines and then put them back up and waste all that time reloading them just to deal with your reocurring piss-poor inventory / vendor management.
---
412 is still much more than most weapons...
---
I don't know how to link to my build?  Is there a website for build planning?
---
Weapons is max Lvl 45
---
The two mutations I have at the moment are marsupial &amp; speed demon.
---
you get extra rare loot when you finish under 8 minutes once per day but i didnt get any extra loot when finishing the new map under 8 minutes. it still says that i have already claimed it. shouldnt that timer reset when the map does?
---
I realize trying to lose weight seems a lot harder than it looks for some people.
---
Not too many people know about this, but my mom actually was referred to this [site](https://www.foreanylimited.com) by her best friend.
---
She literally lost 15 pounds in 30 days, by eating whatever she wants and never exercised. Hopefully this can help you.
---
I think you’re a senseless contrarian lol
---
Lol. You’re being too serious. Are you his friend? Lol is this your second account so you can act like someone else?
---
Well, Super Mutants, for example, die in 1 or 2 hits from my super sledge with all the perks and my 15str.
---
Not sure what mobs you talking about.
---
And they ain't made up.  1 to 2 hits on average, sometimes 3 to kill them as my melee build.
---
When i first read the updates on their website I thought there was going to be a hard cap on levels for lower level areas, which since that isn’t the case then i think your suggestion for modifying leveling areas below lvl 20 to be lower in average level compared to the player would be a great idea.
---
I never said min/max. I said post your build so *any of us* could give relevant advice.  The fact you don’t want to share any of that suggests you haven’t learned a good build design. That’s another indicator of not yet being past the basic learning curve. 
---
You can’t have the game you played two days ago. Get over it and move on. 
---
Sorry the challenge level got too much for you. I hope you find something easier and more suited for your playstyle.
---
*Edit: To reflect your edit, if you’re not able to keep up with your ammo demand, then you need to learn where to farm the components. If only there was someone that could give you an easy farming route that can alt you get over 6k 5.56 rounds in 30 minutes.*
---
try hitting locations that have gyms (valtec u and the launch silos) when you need lead.  go in with stealth armor, grab the weights, then hit the nearest bench to scrap them.  it's an easy way to get lead quickly.
---
If that's the case they need to ensure that vending machines are the last thing that load in on a camp.
---
I could of been out of regular ones but I do have 20+ super usually on me at a time and they work whenever out of PA.
---
I know my damage will go down, but the only reason I was okay having such low health is because of the insane damage. Without guaranteed one shots on most enemies it’s not worth it to run around with enough health that a level 10 super mutant could take me down if Serendipity didn’t proc
---
The Elder bonus has reset, you can get new rewards, it just has the same enemies. Either a bug or sheer coincidence. Both are plausible.
---
Edit: u/valseek has confirmed that it was coincidence we got the same enemies. Not a bug.
---
no, you most definitely are not. felt like clawing my eyes out when I saw that we were getting resilient, again.
---
I find it super fun. Forced me to strategize and do more than just mowing down everything in front of me.
---
It did reset today. Sometimes you just don’t get the rare plan. It’s only an %80 drop chance
---
It was more exciting and got Solo Elderly on the first try with 5 seconds to spare. The layout is way better than The Burrows'.
---
(Excavator, Medic Pump, VFFR 50 cal on mobs, F10 Prime 50 on the boss. Even yesterday, the robots didn't feel threatening, more like annoying.)
---
I am more elegant and floofy than your average villager
---
With +60 strenght i went from 400 to 700 not that much of a big deal to be honest and they don't really stack up very long the first time hou hit the bench, the bonus stays 30 minutes and by the time i did it +50 times the first times effect were starting to fade away
---
Far from it. You just need to adapt to this new environment by rethinking your perks etc.. Keep using your low health build and just equip troubleshooters armor set (even 1\*) and vampires weapon and nothing, and i mean nothing can kill you in there.
---
You’re a shitty bot, how much more descriptive could I get?
---
that is what i still enjoy
---
How does it spoil 200% slower?  Example:
---
Norma dog meat spoils in 1hr.
---
100% slower, would mean it takes double the time.  So it would be 2 hours.
---
200% slower, would mean it takes triple the time.  So it would be 3 hours.
---
(The above is an example, I do not know the correct times)
---
I don't care about the reduced damaged - that isn't so much my issue as I'm burning through ammo at an unsustainable rate.
---
5.56 is rarely dropping from enemies for me.   I can't believe that they intend for me to literally just farm lead &amp; steel non-stop.  As it stands I'm not even sure a supply run will net me up ammo.  Hence my conclusions something is wrong with my build.
---
Oh good! Sounds like the change took effect faster than I expected. Exploding Blood Eagles it is!
---
It is annoying, but you just need to finish them with melee, with a team with melee characters it can be done fine.
---
What does that same weapon do at full health?
---
Yep, good shout.
---
Never said it needed to be nerfed. All I did was ask a question as to whether anyone else was experiencing the same. Clearly not. But I don’t have all the ‘god tier gear’
---
If no one tried it a second time, it wouldn’t be caught (or they noticed it, but chose not to bring it up *because* they wanted it to go live, speaking more to people on the PTS)
---
We're going to have some growing pains while they tweak things.
---
My weight bench isn't working it says unavailable why?
---
But up to this point it hasn't been this way. It's been a casual, enjoyable game and then suddenly they released this update, making it the opposite. Chill the fuck out.
---
\*T51:\* high ballistic, low energy and radiation. \*t60:\* high average in all 3 aspects. \*X-01:\* Basically the opposite of the t51, high energy and radiation. low ballistic. Ultracite is basically a T-51 ripoff: got more rad resistence than the t51, but lower in ballistic and little lower energy (compared to the T-51), and the T65 is a better t60 (t65 is the highest average). The Excavator got the worst ballistic and energy resistance, but got the best rad resistance. (People use the excavator for the carry, even on fights.)
---
Viability:
---
Raider&lt;T-45&lt;T-60&lt;T-65
---
Ultracite&lt;T-51 (technically is the same, the t51 got more ballistic damage and a little bit more energy resistence, but lower rad resistence than the ultracite)
---
Ultracite/T-51=X-01=Excavator=T-65 (The difference is barely noticable between the Ultracite/T51,X01,T-65. You will receive more damage with the excavator, but it's viable in high tier players (more capacity and bonus resources when you excavate.)
---
(This is all level 50 armors)
---
The difference between levels in power armors, is kinda meh, but of course the level 50 is better than the level 30/40 but its not full priority.
---
Idk if i answer your question, or make it more confused or answer another question xdd
---
Im a Ultracite PW armor main (because it was free) but i also got the X01 and excavator
---

Just answered my own question with a "duh.  Power Armor"
---
Don’t comment when you don’t even know what you’re talking about
---
Im a long time player.i really have no problems.i still turn everything into tato paste.just takes a couple more shots.but the ops is stupid ridiculous.resilient can only be killed with melee?who's the asshole that came up with that bandaid?
---
So i have to shoot with my weapon until they get all the way down,then pull out my sheepsquatch burning club to hit them for the last 2 points of hp to kill them.meanwhile the robots kill you super quick.in 4 shots.just plain lazy bethesda.i mean the 100 lvl super assaultron was much easier to kill than the damn crappy bots.wth?thats so stupid.
---
After figuring everything out.i realise this new system is actually great.i did some adjustments to my perks and legendary perks and i just ran an op in v94.it was very challenging but not op.i really enjoyed it.
---
Daily Ops, suprisingly. Every time you complete it, you get roughly 10-20 stimpaks. Not to mention the enemies will commonly drop stimpaks, diluted stimpaks, and super stimpaks. If you can limit your stimpak use, you can usually make a profit out of daily ops. I myself have gained around 40 stimpaks since yesterday after running daily ops twice.
---
Honestly, thank you. This was exactly the information I was hoping to figure out. Looking forward to starting this build once I get bored of pistols and shotguns. I'll hit you up for sure if I need help with the build, that's much appreciated.
---
Given the complaints I've seen, my criticisms are are not alone.  It doesn't suck for me, simply because its just a game and I'll move on to something else ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
It’s not even that they banned the game, just that the option to do gambling is region locked.  I’ll have to see if I can find it, but I never touched GTO
---
as someone who also maxed out focus in warframe: can confirm, current grind is unreasonable as hell. it should work similarly to ESO's champion system with account wide progress. there also needs to be non-card ways to get perk points.
---
similarly, there needs to be a way to full respec a build that doesn't require leveling one at a time to do. make it like 2k gold bullion or something to full respec including card choices. it would be a serious investment and would allow players to fuck around without needing to worry so much while leveling.
---
They should just make a reskin of bloody mess that does this, but you can’t stack it with bloody mess
---
there's no strategy involved in pressing alt and hoping you have some ap left.
---
~~I'm wearing some unyielding armor~~ \-- not really running the sneak package...I'll look into it.   I've saved up like 12 level ups so I can move points however I need to.
---
EDIT: Strike that -- I upgraded that armor piece and forgot
---
But there's always like a billion adds and my gear gets fucked beyond comprehension because of it, shame cuz it is a fun game mode.
---
I hope you have fun being WAAAAYYY better at the game then me. Does that make your ego feel better now?
---
Is this ps4 only?
---
I like how bethesda can spin controversially implemented items for the 2+ kinds of players they have in their games.
---
"Fast travel ia game breaking or ruins my immersion, also who needs these maps and compasses?" Oblivion.
---
"You're saying I can use my resources to make the game easier for me or prettier for me?" Horse armor.
---
Now the game can cater to the many, while taking in the financial support of any.
---
Ive had a few melee builds. I wanted to try and make pistols work, though that may be hard with this patch.
---
On my heavy guns like mingun procs a lot, will have yo get back to you on my flamer
---
Announced is the same as being in actual play testing now?
---
It was also announced in the Roadmap on May 14, so thats a little closer to 5 months since it was announced?
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/CIO182qn66xKBXx84CG06/2020-roadmap-free-week-76-seasons-and-more
---
They just changed it. If it hasn't updated try again. Its now explodes on death. Which sucks for melee.
---
I love you OP. You’ve bought so much salt to the table lmao this is great. People are seriously butthurt that the game is just slightly harder than before haha. Any true fallout fan loves this new patch it’s seriously the best thing that’s happened to this game. Anyone complaining about this patch just needs to play something else and maybe consider not playing shooting games anymore? Because as far as FPS if you have any skill with guns in games 76 is a walk in the park then and now it’s nothing special to have to use some more bullets get over it. You’re spoiled? Entitled? Idk what it is honestly but I can’t figure out why people are so upset unless you just suck at shooting games and before the patch if you sucked ass you could just waltz by everything and enemies would just drop dead that’s how easy it was even for the laziest food build. This game is MILDLY challenging now and it is for the better.
---
I’ll pass, thanks.
---
Ah yes, the classic "just bash it bro, git gud" argument. 
---
Bashing is a fucking mess and should have never been in fo4 to begin with. It cant hit anything unless you are literally touching it, its a slow animation so if you dont quickly turn with the mob running away youll miss. Then theres the whole side of these robots do SERIOUS fucking damage, so enjoy trying to close that gap while they shred you to pieces if youre not in pa. 
---
Single damage type to harm/kill an enemy is lazy game design a three year old could have thought up and seems like it was.  Idc if its melee, ballistic or energy, do not tell people they MUST play this way or uninstall.
---
I will never do another daily op that has resiliant. Its not fun and not even close to worth the rewards and frustration. Whoever thought this was good game design should be fired and never allowed to work in the video game industry again.
---
I noticed that Wallace was missing from Harper's Ferry, last night.  Really pissed me off because I had a ton of weapons to sell and no robot to buy them.   Also there was no hint at where he left, so Bethesda just moved him without actually putting anything fun indicating where he went.
---
I really dislike this new mechanic.  Are there also mobs that can only be killed with bullets and not melee weapons?
---
I don't miss it. Got a friend playing the game and having to wait for them to get a hit on each mob before I one-shot them was getting old. Mowing down low level mobs by myself was OK (if unchallenging) but running through a low level area with a low level player *sucked*
---
Adapt.
---
Never seen someone get so upset over such a minor thing. You gotta learn to cool off god damn
---
They changed it. Its now "enemies exode on death"
---
You say that like it's even hard though.  Just bash 'em to finish them off. nbd
---
How do you only have 19 hp? Your base max should be 255. Also are you running Serendipity, dodgy and other defense perks? I have 0 perks in unarmed and I’m able to run through enemies with a 1 star B Deathclaw gaunlet without talons mutation. Link your build if you need help
---
Oh thank god, I just logged in and legit had an audible groan seeing what it was today
---
Right on.
---
Well I just wasted 10 minutes of my life getting a melee weapon from my alt 🤣
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
You can build your character here, then get the link and share it, it also lets you tell us what mutations &amp; legendary perks you have selected (at level 90 won’t be many).  
---
You can also let us know what armor your wearing, for commando, the armor doesn’t matter as much, but can still be good information.
---
Imagine getting a double kill by kicking a tick in to a low level scorched running at you.
---
Again, it's rare, but not impossible that 4 people would all roll the 20% chance to not get something. Then again, everyone in this game seems to have awful luck with everything, so I don't blame you if it really was bad dice rolls.
---
Im everyone's friend man. Nope: main account.
---
Also that response was exactly why i said immature. Im not worked up i just think you should remember a game is a game.
---
but now you can enjoy the entire map with your friends equally..
---
Haha. Would be great to drink that special nukashine and we just wake up in vault 76 with no recollection of how we got there and now we can visit the doc and respec our stats. It would provide for some funny banter with the bots down there.
---
It's been around for a while, becomes available after 50 I believe. It lets you either swap a special point or pick a perk card every level.
---
My main is 216. I have 5 slots on a brand new character. New character will probably be my main now. The progression is awesome. Besides, nothing really changes after 100 anyway.
---
The daily op mutation combo was a real kick in the jimmies for a stealth rifle build.
---
Nice. Way to keep the same shitty Op as yesterday. The RNG in this game is spectacular
---
I am to. Thanks.

I am a bloodied heavy power armor user and I was able to get the second rank (paladin?) in my third attempt. Of course my main weapon of choice is a vampires explosive Gatling gun so that may have made it a bit easier for me. I do think it’d be a hell of a lot easier on a team though as gun bashing enemies to kill them after I got their health down was annoying, I ended up removing the dodgy perk card as I kept running out of AP to bash with.
---
Running with a partner, staying close, sharing Rad Sponge level 1 or level 2 can keep even the most intense rads at bay.
---
I have it.
---
It doesn't cast any light at all.
---
It has a burning effect similar to a Campfire, but doesn't cast light at all.
---
I can only believe (assuming your math is correct) that you recieved the exact sum your equation provided until otherwise evidenced.
---
I already am doing that.  But getting there has burned more ammo than I'll get from those weights.
---
My bloody swingspeed barbed walking cane might see less use now also
---
Ran it twice with a bloodied commando.  Step ur game up.   It’s doable with bloodied.
---
you'll need it again eventually
---
Bloodied is still top of the heap. The heap is just smaller. I run bloodied on my 155 main as a stealth commando. I die a bit now. I cannot just blow into an area expecting to take on anything that comes my way, but I think that they've laid a good foundation for adjustments top be made in the near future.  
---
What's your build? I presume that you're using Nerd Rage. Nineteen health seems a bit low. I usually sit 40-60 with Nerd Rage active on my build. Remember that you only have to get down to 20% health for Nerd Rage to kick in.

Solo Elderly on the first try in V94. No rare rewards. Got a 3\* pipe Stalker's Pipe revolver.

My mom paid $120 so I could show off on social media? Honestly a comment so based in ignorance doesn't deserve a comment, but I'll educate your ignorant ass. I honestly can't remember the last time my angel of a mother paid for anything for me, but I know it was at least prior to 2007, because I was on my second tour in Iraq defending the freedoms of little know it all bitches like you. There is something truly wired wrong in someone's brain when the greatest accomplishment they are capable of fulfilling on a daily basis, is trolling people on the internet they don't know from Adams housecat. Fire starting, know it all, smarter than everyone else shit stains like your self epitomize the essence of why our society is in the shape it is in, because instead of lifting/building someone up your first instinct is to spew negative bullshit towards someone you don't know whatsoever. Your desire to antagonize people for pleasure may not have repercussions behind your Superman keyboard, but there will come a day that you pull internet tuff guy hardass while not being on the internet, and the real world hardass guy in front of you is going handle your candy ass. I would find pleasure in other things outside of trolling people, because trolling is only safe looking through a glass screen on a device.
---
It's an 80% chance so it looks like you fell into the unlucky 20% category :-/
---
I almost soloed it on my first try before they rerolled
---
I literally had a super mutant walk through me at west tek and didn’t notice me. Stealth seems fine for me, at least.
---
It seems the Resilient Robots wanted to go for round two, but we put a stop to them and manually re-rolled Daily Ops for today so that you all can experience something different since the feature is still so new. In the future, enemies and mutations *can* be the same on back-to-back days, though.
---
Daily Ops should now be Volatile Blood Eagles instead. Good luck!
---
They haven’t been fired because, when measured on the investment VS income scale, this level of quality is acceptable to Bethesda. I think it’s obvious by now that they are literally learning how to use the creation engine on our time.
---
Work on your survivability
---
Bang your knee with it
---
I don't disagree with you, but they clearly made this decision with the "hardcore" player in mind who primarily cares about combat. We'll see what happens but if this is the way it stays then I'll just move on and play something else. Plenty of games out there to enjoy, no big loss and I've already gotten more than my money's worth out of it. 
---
I had the same mentality though; I was enjoying the way the game was and I even powered through Season 1 for the last month or so and got all the way to rank 100 and was looking forward to Season 2. Turned it on for about 20 minutes yesterday, felt pretty disappointed in how much more cumbersome EVERYWHERE on the map is now, and turned it off. Can't see myself going back much if at all unless something is changed and like I said, no big deal. Plenty of other options out there.
---
You're right though. I don't know why you're being downvoted. Troubleshooters help and vampires weapons will keep you alive.
---
Ur welcome. Initially i had the same thought lol,  but luckily i found easier way to do it.
---
Not at all.
---
I had the same happen just now, reached elder with 6,5minutes and no special reward
---
I agree and have been saying this since yesterday. All I get is people saying: post your build. Completely misunderstanding why low levels hate this update. To be fair though there are quite a few high level players that understand how hard it is now for lower levels who don't want a perfect build ive been called a panicker and alarmist for bringing this up.....
---
Friends list one is infuriating. The hoops my friend and I jump through to play together is stupid.
---
We’re not tho.
---
was super easy, I recommend you think about gitin gud and trying again.
---
I play solo...
---
Yeah I found it to drop my framerate terribly.

Elder doesn't guarantee a rare reward. It's a 80% chance. You just didn't hit the jackpot.

I got a rare plan with a 15 m 45 s finish when the odds were only a 5% chance. There is always RNG to contend with.

---
 &gt; Thanks for the tag! We've manually re-rolled today's Daily Op so that you can experience something different from yesterday. Should be Volatile Blood ...
---
Why does Todd hate me
---
Honestly, I feel like having all the enemies match even at level 39 is too much. Before, I could usually handle a swarm of level 20-25 enemies that felt somewhat challenging but not like I was going to be massively beat up. Now, I haven't seen a single enemy that isn't level 39, and me and my friends keep getting completely trashed doing quests that are intended as early game quests. From posts I've seen, it looks like the scaling makes way more sense for high level characters? It looks like there is variety in the levels they're seeing? So I don't understand why there are no opportunities for me to fight anything but enemies who are my level, who will def break my face in if there are like, more than four of them.
---
This really needs to be upped to the same amount of time as sleeping / playing musical instruments.   1/2 hour is too short.  Great little short term buff, but would be so much better.
---
Exactly. 
---
SN: I almost soloed it at Elder before they changed it. This is gonna be super easy.
---
When doing the Op there is a chance of enemies gaining a random perk. It will tell you what it is at the join screen of the Op I belive. The one I had today said they had to be killed with Melee.
---
Exactly this. And one major problem I'm having is missions that require kills with specific weapons. I have to kill 6 different types of enemy with a specific level 1 sword. I've run out of things that I can even damage with it and I have 2 enemy types to go. They really need to figure out how to balance damage with this update. So far I just feel like they took out freedom of play style and just replaced it with perpetual grinding.
---
Lol I’m not going to feel bad for a elitist bloody build asshole I was yelled at and kicked off a daily op team for not being bloody so no sympathy from me sorry.
---
Ps4 cant use it anymore too lol I posted at the same time
---
Mad because bad, the robots do neglible damage to anyone that should be trying for an elder run and there isn't one damage type to harm enemies, just to execute them. The whole point of ops is to create more challenging content and this is supposedly one of the toughest rolls. Going in completely blind to ops and the maps I was able to beat elder with 30 seconds to spare on a 3 strength 1 endurance commando build, people are seriously exaggerating how difficult the op is.
---
Yep - gotta keep moving 👍🏻
---
I have been as well...actually almost since this game has launched. I'm hoping they implement something for this soon.
---
I only started playing last week and just hit level 21 on Monday.  I knew the servers were going offline yesterday, but as new as I am to the game I wasn't tracking patches and the like, which I would normally do.  I have a mere 35 hours in the game, and while I am very familiar with the franchise, have absolutely no clue what I'm doing in FO76.  Yesterday hit and...well, my entire experience changed.  I assumed that it had something to do with my hitting level 20; maybe the game was set to become more difficult.  But I went from having a blast playing this to having absolutely no fun at all.  Again, this could be because I just don't know how to play it yet.  The game was challenging to me, levels 1-15 or so.  Then I started to feel like I had a handle on properly conducting engagements.  I still had to contend with watching my ammo and decent positioning.  But I felt relatively secure.  Yesterday, I died five times engaging some Blood Eagle guys or whatever they are.  Just now I fought a bunch of level 21 Scorched as well as some ceiling gun turrets in the power plant, and it felt like I was throwing spitballs at them.  I feel utterly ineffective and it is just not fun to me.  From the feedback on this subreddit, it seems that a lot of folks are enjoying it.  That's great.  I'm not one of them.  I barely got into the game and with one patch my experience changed so radically that I wish I hadn't just purchased a copy for a buddy so we could play together.  I love the atmosphere, but my real life has enough futility and frustration that I don't need to feel that way in a game in which my .45 caliber bullets, aimed directly at a humanoid's face, remove less than 1/20th of their health.  I think I'll probably pass on the game for a while.
---
Did daily ops yesterday with my bloodied commando.  No perk changes for the update. 
---
Paired it with a power fist and I was able to power attack most of not all robots with 1-2 hits.   Only thing helping me is the talons mutation I have on that toon.
---
Ok. Now if I only didnt have a full set of wwr armor due to my stash being full for the last 2 years. Ive got too much stuff to put it all on the wheel.
---
I hope  they tweak something.  It would be great to have a toggle like they have for Pacifist mode... turn it on if you want the challenge or off if you want to chilax and play.
---
Approaching full build, in daily ops, I spend 10 bullets on each mob, get 4 back.. hardly a farm.
---
i also see no problems in this mutation (deal with it on a 1st try with 7m time), but random mutations every day are so random right now :)
---
And yes, i'd prefer to shoot enemies to the deats instead of bashing them
---
This would be the main reason.
---
Not actually. I've leveled a gunslinger/guerrilla for this patch and even though I didn't test gunslinger yet, guerrilla is working even better now. The tank killer perk applies to pistols now.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Legendary_Run_(season)
---
Well they aren't getting that from me. haha
---
Even add it as a legendary perk option 1* rad roaches and ticks, 2* mole rats, 3* ants, 4* plague rats
---
Deathclaw Island now lifes up to its name a bit more.
---
The level 50 aren't too bad.  I just need to remember that the forest is no longer a cake walk.  The level 100 enemies do give me pause.  Not sure how the scorched can kill me in one hit, with a hatchet.  No, I'm not bloodied.  I'm level 176, full health, rifleman build.   Damage resistance 400+, and I was one hit by a scorched.

I understand what your saying but it’s easier to just say reduce spoil time by 90% which would make food last 10 times longer while in the fridge.
---
It's fresh off the presses
---
What about bows? They have all of the damage downsides, but you throw in the fact that sometimes the arrow just doesn't go straight.
---
Very true
---
if by "tons" you mean 2 rank 2 legendary cards for hitting 95 then sure.
---
I feel bad because there's nothing that can really be said (at least respectfully) that'll make you want to keep playing. But if I can offer one piece of advice...get your friends to play. I'm just saying, it makes a world of difference when it's not just you shooting at an enemy but 1, 2 or 3 of your friends.
---
Don't let people make you think that you need to ridiculous build to be good at the game or that because you choose exploration or crafting related perks that you'll never be good enough. But it doesn't hurt to at least focus on one thing and pick *some* perks related to that. The urge is strong to carry multiple different weapons but the perk system just isn't built for that.
---
I hope you find something that brings you back to loving the game again. Best of luck to you.
---
Lol its not just impacting low/mid levels. SBQ took like 3 times as long and used proportionately more bullets. The games just a little bit different now, harder? Maybe spongier at least. 
---
I played the opposite way and was way underlevelled for the area i was in. I was in endgame space when i was your level and yes me and my wife died all the time and we had to do things over and over. Whitespring golf club at mid 35 was an experience and a half. 
---
This patch brings that back for me and im personally not too salty. Its kinda fun being wary of a deathclaw or a scorchbeast again.
---
Beth gives us exactly what we will fight. 
---
Explodes on death - fireproof perk
---
Robots - troubleshooters armor
---
SMS - mutant slayers armor
---
Raiders - assassins armor
---
Guess I did it while swapping off of one of my heavy weapons , never heard about this glitch and I’ve been playing since launch , didn’t find this subreddit until a year later though lol.
---
Specials are worthless due to the large amount of perk coins required to make them useful. 1 point is pretty meaningless.
---
Ran past it once and got chased to RepCon. A tense start to what would be my favorite playthrough.
---
Hats don’t count, I have the poisoner one (imho better than the fire one if you run fireproof) and the 50 poi resist shows on my character tab regardless of hat.
---
Sorry it was a bad experience for you- my early level stuff pre-update was definitely challenging, but largely predictable as to where the challenges would be and where I would have an easier time.  Pretty ironic that this update was couched as making the game more balanced across all levels and yet newer players like yourself ended up hurting from it.
---
Yep. [Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d5tamj/the_comprehensive_creatureanimal_taming_guide/) the taming guide
---
bash them with a gun
---
Well, sorry. I was mistaken, because you said "is it too hard?"
---
But your gauge on the difficulty was a solo attempt at endgame content. Of course it's gonna be difficult for you. If a lvl. 73 player was able to solo it on their first attempt...it's too easy.
---
I find it well balanced. 
---
I, a lvl. 315 player with excellent gear, can solo it and get it done up to paladin tier. That's because I spent a long time refining my perks and I built a troubleshooter/AP refresh/sentinel armor set that works great for this situation. 
---
You could certainly complete it, at elder rank, if you team up with 2-3 other people and focus on the objectives.
---
I would call that balanced, personally.
---
Sure, but what I'm saying is they haven't exactly been doing that. Massive bans for dupers, over turned. Legacy laser explosives, never dealt with. Just two examples, plenty more available. They may get to it. They may not. 
---
Just reading on here it still seems 50/50 between people who are cool with the changes &amp; those who are not. Ofc you'll never get 100% of the people 100% of the time, but I am rather jaded at this point with their overall treatment &amp; can't say I hold faith they'll bother, frankly. 
---
If they are telling the truth, and the new system is easier to adjust, as long as they listen &amp; actually balance that's great. But they didn't really even try to with the previous system from the players standpoint. Can't go a single patch on COD without weapon changes, not a huge fan of Activision but the effort they put out is at least obvious.
---
Ran the burrows in 10 minutes solo with a bloodied HG
---
Tried it a 2nd time and died 5 times before I noticed I had no stimpacks :)
---
It's numbers, Deathclaws need to spawn in packs.
---
It was after the reset (i did it with resilient), they just changed it.
---
This is actually a perfect example of true RNG, once you start adding "ifs" then you no longer have full RNG.
---
If you're having the same problem with VATS that I used to--it exits/turns off at random for no reason--equip Gun Fu; saw a post about it the other day and it works. Since I did I haven't exited VATS once.
---
It's a crappy workaround but at least it does work.
---
Nerd Rage, Unyielding arms (tried to make more but no luck), Adrenal Reaction and like a dozen other mutations
---
Vault 76 -&gt; Overseers house = 8 caps irc.
---
If you use the new fast travel points / public events. Its pretty easy to travel anywhere on map for under 15 caps.
---
I’m not worked up either. If you want me to accept that then you have to be willing to accept what i say.
---
I legit asked a question that could explain some of it. His response was rude. 
---
So I called him out in that. Pointing his rudeness, isn’t me being to immature or childish. 
---
Same goes for your comments. The first thing you say is stop being immature. 
---
Seems you don’t like following your own advice.
---
Just because YOURE a "sniper", doesnt mean that gun has to be used in that manner. Guns should be balanced with all game mechanics and their full potential in mind. Im telling for a fact vats increase your damage output by a significant margin weather you personally choose to use it or not.
---
If you can take the same gun and deal the same damageper bullet but at half the AP cost and twice the fire rate with the auto version as you can the semi auto version than it is not balanced. End of story. 
---
Can you solo earl with youre sniper build? I can with my 10mm pistol build... ya know why? VATS + auto receiver! Would not be able to do it otherwise. (Well havent tried in patch 22 with the  new damage formula. But in patch 21 it was doable.)
---
Use the rooms. Hide in corner of door way. They’ll funnel in slowly. You should have enough AP since they’ll come in one by one. Plus you’re close enough to still speed uplink and you’re covered so you don’t need to run around causing you to take less damage. I run with Dodgy and never run into AP problems. Figure out what sucks and figure out how to make it better... my first runs were dog shit 12-14 min and  I can run 7-8 solo now. But then again Daily Ops isn’t met for anyone. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Now to think back to of all those Troubleshooters Melee weapons I script in the past.
---
Get anything that can be dropped as a legendary, so weapons and Secret Service armour.  Ignore the mods until you have all of the base plans.
---
Start with the Secret Service armour plans and then get the Gauss Minigun and Shotgun when you reach Ally status. Ignore the helmet as it doesn't drop as legendary. 
---
The other items like the backpack mods, farmable dirt tile, etc. are cool.  But it takes a while to build up bullion and armour and weapons plans are the most costly.  You'll have plenty to spend down the road and you can pick them up then.
---
In the mean time, use your scrip to buy legendary modules.  You'll need these to craft legendary secret service armour, etc.
---
Sounds promising.  I going to do some testing on my mains to  see if I want to run low health or not.
---
Just doing Dailys in general. They almost always drop Stimpacks... The other option is the Pharma Farmer perk.
---
V9 is the bunker by Fissure Prime
---

It doesn’t suck yet it warranted a post complaining about the changes 🤔
---
It’s really not the only way to play, you have to step outside of your comfort zone and use different weapons and change up your build. These daily ops are a really great way to learn new skills and improve the skills you already have. Put on some new perks and come up with a new strategy
---
I edited this to take out a few words that didn’t make sense
---
after the enemies changed we did another sub 8 minute run but all of the bonus loot still showed as COMPLETED before doing that, even after restarting the game. maybe ive gotten those extra things and just completely missed it. lets see if some other people have the same issue. thanks
---
If you want extra proof then check the math against your own character?
---
Unless you're low leveled, started playing after the bug was fixed or have the luck of the gods and never opened a single duplicate single ranked perk then your numbers should not match what they should be.  You might not be missing over a hundred perks but you'll definitely be missing something.
---
Right, thats why with full hardened ss armor,  max rank serendipity and dodgey with the auto stim under 20% perk i died before i could hit another stim when coming back after a respawn. Meanwhile my pa char is able to tank 10 of those things with maybe 2-3 diluted used.
---
If you do not have pa you are not allowed in daily ops at this time
---
Based on this knowledge I'll be converting all my locks to lv0 for subtle trolling.

You on xbox? Need any kind of junk or ammo?
---
Bethesda is removing an unintended feature that people were tripping over themselves to post about
---
Or your ammo pool.  It's so much less efficient to have to fire so many more rounds to achieve the same result.
---
Junkies took a huge hit. I was so happy with my full health junkie build. Now I'm not really sure what I'm doing. I've sold literally dozens of guns I wish I hadn't now. So many TSE's I wish I could get back...
---
I'm definitely mourning my Junkie build right now, no doubt about it. I had such a nice combination of firepower and tankiness before, and it seems totally gone now.
---
If they have that perk then you have to melee to finish them off
---
Aww shit you mean to tell me if I would have just kept doing reps it would have just kept stacking +2 strength to my character? And I completely missed the chance to actually enjoy their mess up... lame
---
How much did you rank it?  I did one rank and am pleased at the moment with it.
---
Agreed - I've been enjoying the more casual aspect of the game as I got to higher levels, but yesterday after dealing with level 50 molerats outside of Flatwoods the game just isn't fun.
---
personally, i'd be fine with it as a long term goal if the progress was account wide. it currently is not. i'm not gonna "long term goal" a bunch of characters, i'd only ever bother with one, at most. you may notice this is counter intuitive for the game as it offers a wide array of possible builds and playstyles AND with the new daily ops it encourages having multiple characters with multiple styles rendering legendary cards effectively unobtainable.
---
Better question: why don't you read the instructions when you're starting an event?
---
Most MMO's have leveled-regions specifically for players like me. Because a lot of people play these types of games like that.
---
I can't pick and choose fights if almost all the gameplay/events are combat focused. Exploration is combat focused. The entire game is combat focused. Pick and choose fights? What's to pick and choose?
---
No game MMO/online game, repeat none, should start out *ridiculously* hard, and then get easier once you reach higher levels. Optimally, it should be a steady, even difficulty rate, or, like most others, easy-ish with opt-in challenges (like raids etc.)
---
I shouldn't have to grind through the starting/tutorial levels just so I can get some cheesy perks to final become even with the swarms of high-leveled enemies.
---
Agree completely. I shouldn't have to be in the fight of my life just to get back to my house and repair my armor.
---
But to max level 5 cards I'd need more or less 500 levels, without counting perk packs on the scoreboard and each 5 levels.
---
And people still don't know how to play it LOL

Hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the new Levels for turrets only add 2-5 points of damage versus the old Levels, except the Missile Turrets, which do a whopping 25 more points.

Takes 25+ Missiles from a Level 50 Missile Turret to kill a Level 100 Molerat.
---
I got an outfit today. Not even a plan for it.
---
Criteria* is all your perks dedicated to your main weapon of choice and playstyle. It makes sense if you're a melee build specialized in melee you should be garbage with guns. That's the point of the patch that has been outlined for over a month. 
---
Youre supposed to specialize your build. Unfortunately if you dont enjoy your build post patch the only choice is respec. 
---
I used to use a power first and sniper rifle pre patch on low level creatures because i didn't wanna waste ammo on my main gun. Now they're practically useless as I'm not a melee or sniper build. So I just threw them in the garbage where they belong and completely respect to fit a magic weapon i had rolled.
---
Alrigit. I see i offended you..
---
Op is immature as fuck but seemed unaplroachable. Im messaging you contrarily.
---
I thought using baby voice text was immature. Still do. I dont want to be rude so im sorry that was rude.
---
I accept your perspective.
---
Did the ranks reset for today also?  I did the Op earlier when it changed to Vault 94 but was still the bots and it said that the 3 one time ranks were already complete but I hadn't done any other Op's since last night.
---
Forest camps FTW!
---
I preferred the old system as well as it meant it gated off areas of the game until you were better prepared. 
---
It gave a better sense of progression, and really made you feel like you were in over your head when you wandered too far in the wrong direction.
---
Yeah it makes no sense. This update only really helps people above level 70 who are still interested in leveling for some reason. Oh. The overpriced legendary perks? Sure I’ll play a completely broken game for those. They help /so/ much.
---
To be fair, they were complaining only in regards to the Season. I'm sure they're more than aware of other Atom Shop Pistol skins if they're a Gunslinger.
---
go back to your hole
---
nothing I'm doing in the daily ops is new or fresh, nor did I have to change my build around.
---
the only thing I'm doing different is spamming alt and repairing my guns twice as often.
---
I'm on PC. I know the name's confusing, but Xbox has a Gamepass for PC, called Xbox Gamepass PC.
---
But thank you, I really appreciate the offer!
---
Well issues with resources is that you're either using too much like not doing enough damage, or you're not reciving enough in loot. Look into things like stealth, concentrated fire for consistent head shots and perks like tenderiser. Also think about what kinds of ammo you're picking up. If you're using a lot of 556 but picking up stacks of 45, you might want to pick up a combat rifle or fixer instead. I often carry a pipe rifle as well as a handmade for animals and scorched as they tend to drop a lot and is less valuable to me then my 556 is.

If a blood eagle explode does that make Fried chicken?
---
If only there was a Fallout game made for people who wanted to play solo..
---
As an Over lvl 100 primary SOLO player this update (22) has given me several OP perks.
---
Whelp like I said. It’s not for everyone 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
wow your so much better then me
---
Nothing is forcing you to do the ops if you don't like them
---
Good point. I'll add that to the post
---
Its like they don't want us to play the game haha. I've never been more deterred from playing than from Patch 22.
---
Instead of just letting us pick our own difficulty level at the cost of xp gain like in other Fallouts, they just force HARD onto everyone and turn everything into a bullet sponge. That's not how I play Fallout 4 or 3, and that's now how I play this game either.

I read somewhere that this happens when sorting by condition, try another method
---
The 50 bloatflies/radroaches aren’t stronger. They still have max stat values, they just display as 50 so any legendaries you get will be max level.
---
I believe the reduce weight of chems and such perk on armor negates the need for the third perk point.
---
All very fair comments. Basically, what you're all saying is, adapt :)
---
Looks as if I'll need to make a few changes to my much loved build, armor types and perks. 
---
I'd like to say I'm happy to do so but I'm pretty "grumpy" after getting royally trashed on my "first" outing.
---
Weapon classes need serious rework to make them distinct. There are other ways to be "powerful" that aren't straight dps.. current game doesn't have any mercy for non-optimal builds.
---
Way back at the beginning I wanted to run a bunch of Single Action Revolvers... But then discovered they are worse than Western Revolver in every way...and that crit builds are terrible... Then discovered that rifles are better than pistols in every way... Then that commando is better for my playstyle then stealth sniper ... The game is easier now... But I don't get to play the way I wanted...
---
This is the reason everyone was given 50 free perk coins upon reaching level 50. To make up for those that may have been lost respecing a character.
---
you have to focus farm focus (heheh) the simplest way is to run elite sanctuary onslaught with saryn loaded with an eidolon lens and max range, efficiency, and a good amount of strength. you run in, spore something, break the pods or kill it and then watch everything die, just make sure to spore things sometimes cuz occasionally you will kill everything and lose some uptime. also make sure you get all the efficiency stimulus on each map to ensure the maximum focus-orb-buff time and kill shit as hard as you can with saryn while it's up. it's still a slog, but it's nowhere near as bad as just playing normally to get focus.
---
I wasn't in a team
---
Ammo factory legendary perk had been super helpful
---
As a Over lvl 100 primary SOLO melee player this update (22) has breathed fresh life into this game.
---
vault 94 explosive eagles
---
Agreed. Game was practically a typical Fallout game for me with an online side to it which is all it needed to be. Now it’s not. Bullet sponge enemies, immersion is broken, and it’s no longer a chill enjoyable time.
---
I may have imagined it, but I’m sure something along these lines was mentioned as coming in the future.
---
Whenever I fast travel to a large camp and it takes forever loading, I like to jump into the middle of the structure .... sometimes I get locked inside by the time it’s all loaded. NBD though cuz I can fast travel out. 
---
Locks are pointless.
---
I love getting absolutely murdered even when wearing full SS armor, all because I have to run up to every single robot to bash them
---
Yeah same I was gonna just swap to it while in nuke zone but Bethesda HAD TO FUCKING MAKE IT COST POINTS TO SWAP -________-
---
My stealth rifleman is fine, people are being very overdramatic
---
Ammo legendary perk more than makes up for that if needed.
---
Apply myself to more repair kits and resources I guess.
---
I’ve gotten a decent legendary but no drops.
---
Just google "Fallout 76 Reload glitch" You basically fire the gun you want full, empty the mag or chamber then in the reload animation switch to a gun with lots of rounds and back really fast. Some folk have a lot of trouble getting it working but there's some youtube videos about it.
---
Yeah I know, that's a huge pain in the ass when it's all of them and you're alone and not a male build and stims don't work
---
I played a few hours every other day or so. More during events. I just like grinding through stuff exploring etc. I like a challenge but I also don’t like getting swarmed by level 50 mole rats while I’m trying to secure a workshop. This has made the majority of the weapons I used obsolete and I apparently don’t have a large enough stimpack supply. Pretty disappointed in the game as it’s become more of a combat game now and less exploring and survival. That’s just my opinion though. You guys doing any better?
---
One rank is good to never have radiation again, however if you want to roam around in a nuke zone without power armor then you need max what rads.
---
I seriously wish we could. I’d love to have ‘Bulk .38’ as an option to sell. Like, make it 50 rounds in each bulk package and I could sell it for 19c.
---
With this new legendary perk (the first one I maxed out) I’m generating insane amounts of ammo. I might have to start giving it away to those in need. 
---
I’ve started listing .38 Fixers for cheap in my vendors along with a lot of the ammo. I’d love to sell ‘packages’. A Level 20 .38 automatic Fixer and 500 .38 ammo for 200 caps.
---
I finished on Knight and received a rare reward, if I finish on Elder do you know if I can receive another reward or are we capped to 1 a day?
---
Tooltip is wrong for some people, it's 94/exploding/eagles
---
It's okay though - they gave **everyone** 50 points because some people had to respec cos of broken perks and nerfs and lost duplicate perk cards, etc. That means that now the people who moved perk points aren't *any* worse off than the people who didn't, right? Right??  
---
😐🤦‍♂️
---
What receiver do you have in your handmade.
---
Idk man. Maybe it's because I've always been a Power Armor pilot, but I'm having the exact same difficulty that I had before this patch came out. Are you a bloodied build? I can see that being untenable in ops.
---
I did first try elder difficulty both days. Guess I'm unlucky..
---
Yes but for players who have been playing since the game first dropped this isn’t as much of an issue. 
---
I’m saying there are certain parts of the update that are aimed at helping lower level players (One Wasteland/leveling up faster) and certain parts that are aimed at rewarding higher level characters (legendary perks).
---
The leg. perks aren’t meant to be maxed out quickly. They’re supposed to be something you continue to work towards.
---
Not impressed with Daily Ops so far..might be my new NW as far as daily challenges go..appreciate the challenge in needing different types of damages to finish off mobs, but in this case, melee hit boxes are fucked and pairing that with fucking robots is even worse. On top of that, EXP from mobs is obscenely low for this, and some of the building layouts are just atrocious. It becomes all the more frustrating when you're trying to find where you need to go, while dealing with a never ending supply of trash exp mobs. So I'm pissing away tons of ammo to beat the mobs down to a manageable level for me to finish off with melee, only to have point blank range misses and then get completely blasted by the other  mobs that have just shown up. Yeah, so far, not a fun experience. 
---
To be fair, ive only been doing these solo because it seems to be difficult to get others to join, so i will continue to give these a go..for now.
---
I run a junkies build.  Honestly you don't need bloody or junkies.  Just find a good shot or anti-armor weapon set and you will be fine.
---
I was in the same boat. I played at launch then quit until a few weeks ago. I've been having a lot of fun with the changes. The new content from wastelanders has been keeping me busy. I just jumped back in with my old character. 
---
The main issue right now, in my opinion, is the new balance update. They changed how enemy leveling works so now all enemies are leveled to you. That means everything is basically an equal challenge to fight. Previously low level enemies take way more time and ammo to kill but previously higher level ones will be actually killable at any character level. For me this has killed a lot of enjoyment. Leveling just gets you a new perk, no strength increase in terms of game play since when you level, so do enemies. My best gear always feels like it needs upgrading now, a radroach takes 3-6 direct shotgun shots. Granted, the update just came out and I'm sure will get a lot of tweaks, but at the moment I'm finding the game to be way more of a grind than I enjoy.
---
If you're far enough to have a decent build ~ lvl 100 then its fun/easy/new. People are being drastically dramatic about how difficult it is, if you're remotely decent at the game you'll finish the tier 2 rewards the first time when you get the lay of the land and easily get elder the next try. I had about the absolute worst build for it (stealth commando with no S or E) and it was pretty easy, just slightly more difficult than the base game content. Hoping they add tougher challenges with better rewards.
---
Well then I’m sorry you don’t like it. Try a different playing style when you get resilient enemies if you don’t like gun bashing. There’s a million different things you can do in this game, try something new.
---
It's so freaking nice, all the legendary perks give some major QoL improvements and it's great!
---
It's not like making money is hard.
---
cya
---
I got ptsd. I twitch when I see robots, even the ones at Charleston fire department.
---
Shop at player vendors to get your weapons. You're more likely to find a halfway decent weapon for your build than complete blind luck from the purveyor.
---
At mid-70s, I was in a position where I was finding the lower level areas a bit too easy (but great for safe farming), and other areas still posing a notable challenge.
---
Since the update, I've found that every area now poses a risk. I died a lot more than usual last night, I ran through much more ammo, and my guns and armour broke far more frequently. On the other hand, the increased exp did help me level up more quickly.
---
I reckon that until you hit level 60+, your build probably isn't super important, but having perks that fit your playing style/weapon load out probably do help. I reckon a key thing might be to try to make sure you're levelling up your weapons and armour as you level up. Also, applying the upgrades you find/learn to strengthen those weapons and armour is probably important too.
---
I'm also a pretty casual player, and I don't like to spend big chunks of time tweaking builds and optimising weapons and armour.
---
Overall, I'm enjoying the additional challenge, but I do feel under-powered a bit too often now (flipping level 50 Radtoads). I think I still need to work out a way to approach the game after the update that works for me.
---
You can mod the small backpack, still working on the tadpole quests as well and i recently slapped the raider chem mod on it. PA is now a no go for me tho as the weight of 200 stims and all my other chems rockets me way past my PAs carry limit real fast so stash accordingly
---
I triggered your ego I see.
---
So...you're a hero for killing women and children in a foreign country?
---
Thank you for your service I guess.
---
The funny thing is you can run over sand bags while in PA
---
I'm good. I know what I like.
---
Oh my god thank you for saying this about food and drink. I always ran Lead Belly because I'm so OCD about rads but now I don't need it woooo!!
---
Bro, please go play something else then because that is a ridiculous claim. You can absolutely still play casually. The devs made this change to improve the game and it has improved drastically just after one day. I understand enemies are a little tougher but don’t say it’s the opposite than before dude. It’s not like it’s dark souls now. Go play any other mmo rpg and if you play an unoptimized build you get wrekt unless you play on a team. That’s just the nature of the genre.
---
I don't mind this mutation, but when it's EVERY ENEMY it's a total pain in the ass and not fun. A variety would be good
---
The game was too easy before, now it is a battle to stay alive. 
---
(just as post apocalyptic wasteland should be).
---
Perhaps you need to respec your build and tactics.
---
I am a Bloodied Commando and I still tear through enemies.
---
Now just needs 3 bullets instead of 1.
---
Happy days
---
Are you really this mad at me? I feel sorry that a disagreement about a video game means you now feel angry enough to have to insult me every chance you get. kinda seems like you're the butt hurt one
---
Exactly. They went through all the effort into making it more like a traditional Fall Out game. Private Servers NPCs and then just threw that all away.
---
Can confirm. Im from south africa and the casino slots and tables arent available in GTA
---
I always wondered why using the bed and the mr fuzzy rides made your camera stationary but playing instruments and shit you can spin the camera.
---
You get 3 chances, one for each rank (5%, 10% and 80%). If you finish as elder you will roll all ranks at the same time. So you don't need to do initiate first, then knight etc.
---
Critical shot bonuses would be a passive ability for those particular weapons. Sniper rifles and the likes should have the ability to kick out some serious damage when aiming for headshots/critical spots
---
I'll have to go to a quarry and try killing a queen tomorrow.   It was already difficult enough for me.   (not perked out to the max)  
---
I skipped Line because I was afraid of as much from the SB's.  Gonna have to suck it up and see for myself personally, but I am completely with you on considering it ruined if we have to go back to level 50 in terms of performance.    
---
I can't bring myself to the do the Uplink event at all.  I hate robots.
---
Ive been playing for like 20 days and I've gotten 40% extra sneak damage lol. I love this update
---
Daily op wasn't very bad for me at all, as a heavy gunner PA build lvl 100 just shoot em down and bash em
---
The biggest gripe for many players was the game was too easy.
---
AS a result they get bored and quit. 
---
Now veteran players who stuck around on easy mode are now saying the same thing.
---
I will dust off Strangler for sure and try it out ;)
---
Early rewards can be great profit when traded to others......
---
You can't make this shit up.
---
I am really enjoying Weight Bench Wednesday
---
22nd
---
I see your point with balancing but at the same time it gives players access to higher level content which is cool to me, I loved it when they did the same thing in ESO, it basically allowed me to explore and quest wherever I wanted which I really enjoy!
---
76... It's all in the game.
---
 Nope. I've gotten elder a decent amount of times and got 2-3 uncommon rewards in total. :/
---
It hasn't been fixed!
---
you mean like pain train ?
---
I think they may be addressing these issues in teh future along with perk loadouts etc.
---
I used up nearly 30 stimpacks and about 20 fusion cores trying to do the vault 79 raid and I died over 14 times. Sunday I would have died a couple times and would have used a few fusion cores. The game is way to difficult for solo players now. To the point a lot of people are going to quit
---
Really need circuity.
---
Not only were it the same iteration, I also got no rare reward again for doing it under 8min. I kinda expected to look at the clock to see it be the 15th Sep again.
---
I play fallout 76 solo and I have no issues
---
Actually, my Sneak Rifleman build literally can't do Sneak attacks in VATS anymore. There's a few major broken codes to do with Demo Expert, Sneak Attacks and TS at the moment. 
---
I shit you not, my ADS headshots will do the sneak multiplier and hit for 560 with my handmade, 
---
My VATS headshots never state "Sneak attack" and do a measly 340 damage.
---
So far my biggest disappointment is the communist bunker. I had a great setup, but now it's all sunk into the walls, and won't fit if I move anything... Were people really having that much trouble with wall decor? My walls were covered in stuff, but now, again, no room for it.
---
I know you're being cute and all but if you missed what I just said, I've had no problems soloing daily ops.
---
my problem is with brain dead 'strategies' like spamming the bash button which only serve to inconvenience the player.
---
Yeah I agree; I looked at it the first time and kept scrolling the mouse wheel like "Uhhh, zoom out please" lol. It's definitely too far in.
---
If you say so. I’m just more willing to adapt and learn than you appear to be.
---
Literally tells you everything you have to do and what to expect, it has done for weeks... C'mon.
---
Thanks so much for the info
---
It gives PA an edge it's never had before. I'm all for it.
---
Oh, you know the one. It was a hot topic, not too long ago.
---
Essentially, its describes the consequences if

Haven't gotten to try yet.  Slow wifi+boat repairs+10 hour shifts+1 hour commute each way. I'll probably find out Saturday night or Sunday.
---
I'm in the 210s and the majority of those levels came from crafting chems.
---
Agreed, they could have just added it to the list. Oh well...
---
Ironic thing is that, with the One Wasteland shit, it's probably going to cost just as much ammo as for the raid.
---
It does, I get that.  I've already maxed out Ammo Factory in anticipation of that.  I just feel like it shouldn't have to.  a 500% increase on output of ammunition does not make up for 150% increase on input with production.
---
You can still solo... you just need to work harder at it and change up your newbie build until you get to a higher level.
---
Maybe go full melee until you get your hands on more consistant ammo.
---
Also Fo76 is an online game that encourages you to buy off other people and interact with them.
---
Not interacting with others  at all is not part of the design of the game even though you  can still play that way if you want, it just obviously makes it way harder.
---
Does not work with Gatling laser. Only works with equipped fusion core in PA
---
They're supposed to hum leading up to the explosion when dead, but sometimes they don't.
---
is there an average pricing for legendary weapons when it comes to player vendors? i can’t tell what price is acceptable for end game weapons, for example i came across a player vendor with bloodied weapons (i think it was some rifles and melees) for 5-8K each. is that average price or ridiculous?
---
That’s exactly why you were in there alone. It dosent fill like collosal problems, you have to be on a team to have teammates in there with you.
---
You are over reacting. 
---
Did the change hit bloodied hard? Yes. Did the change hit other builds too? Yes. Is bloodied still the build that will produce the most damage? Yep. 
---
So why turn away from bloodied if your issue is the amount of damage. No build will give you more. They will only give you less damage for a different set of negatives.
---
I'm not even doing dailies. I have no motivation for this season, I don't feel it's worth the effort especially not with these changes. I'll be signing off for now and giving attention to another game
---
You must make 0 attempt at using cover/angles. I did my run with 3 pieces of SS with no mods and some leather armor to fill. I used like 10 stimpacks and probably found 5-6.

If it helps, I couldn’t play anything all last week. My Internet was out do to fires in the area, but didn’t have power or water either so didn’t matter as much that the Internet was down to👍👍be patient it will get better😁
---
Oooh there's a place I should go now true
---
I'd at least give it a whirl!  The whole achievement thing is just weirdly setup more than it is difficult to accomplish a lot of the challenges.  There's some tough ones if you want to get all the unlockables and the Possum ones are more of a pain but the backpack is definitely reasonably achievable.
---
You don’t need an optimal build.  My sniper character is not optimal.  She is not using any great mutations.  Her gun is a 1* instigating sniper rifle.  She isn’t wearing an amazing set of unyielding (yes, I have a character like that, but this is not it). She’s doing fine. She was not hit that hard from the “nerf”.    
---
My Shotgun build Medic has 15 Charisma.  I play him mostly as a character who goes in and shares his perks, he drinks a lot of booze to get buffs,and otherwise does his best without even having more than 2 shotgun perk cards. He is able to survive.  
---
Of course my optimal builds are doing just great, but even those aren’t fully optimized. My commando is using a Mutant’s handmade, that’s not optimal for a bloodied build.  My Unarmed guy is using the Unstoppable Monster - but he’s not a bloodied build and never even went down when I tired the daily ops yesterday in a group.  
---
There’s having an optimal build.  Having a sufficient build. And not having a build at all.  It seems you went down that last path.  I can’t tell you of too many games that let you actively nerf yourself as you have.  You don’t have to be trying to be optimal to choose perks that deal damage.  
---
Go check out Flatwoods, there are basically no enemies there but there are weapons, materials, and stuff that you can pick yourself back up with.  Go to the motel and get yourself some lead, if you can’t even deal with the single rad roach that spawns there, the issue is far more than the nerf to the damage.  
---
I have a single level 200+ character, but I love one wasteland.  My lower level characters, even my pre 50 character are surviving.  I’m using weapons that “should” be fun.  They aren’t meta.  Shoot, I love the floater grenades that drop despite so many other people saying how much they hate them.
---
Did you learn the plan the first time you got it? Or was is just in your inventory when you got the duplicates?
---
They should have reset, yes. If they haven't that's a bug we will need to investigate. If you're able to log back in and check again, are the reward tiers still showing as complete for you now?
---
That's actually a good suggestion.
---
Too bad there isn't a similar mod for the double-barrel.  I have a quad FFR.
---
I think that I have a few legendary shotguns sitting in a closet in my CAMP.  I'll have to dust them off.  
---
(Opens closet door)  Ewww...  is that a radroach....
---
man my mum is downloading first and she has 10 gigs,so 10 hours, to go. i haven't downloaded a single byte lol
---
Anytime, good friend
---
spot on, and by the end of that you may be close to settlers rep.
---
Nocturnal is not a great legendary perk. I would be trying to get something better than that ASAP. As others have said, sneak is great for a commando build. You want max special points in Perception and Agility and as much in luck as you can.
---
For ammo, use Excavator Power Armor and go through Lucky Hole mine and farm all of the lead nodes there. Excavator gives 4x bonus to ores mined. When crafting, be sure to use the Super Duper perk, preferably rank 3, to maximize the output of lead from your ores. Ammosmith rank 2 is a necessity as well. There is also a new legendary perk that boosts ammo production. That will probably be a must also. All of this will help maximize your crafting output.
---
I would also work on getting a second auto rifle that uses a different ammo so that you have something to use when farming materials.
---
Just get them down a bit then use the cross bow or whatever for the final hit
---
I tried all 3 ranks of pain train and it still did like barely any damage, hardly ever knocked an enemy over, and on top of that would hardly ever trigger, completely worthless imo
---
I seem to remember that as well. If I come across the source I’ll share it. I think it was in an ITV. 
---
Those are great sources of information. I just wish it was easier to navigate through them or they were indexed.
---
Your lvl294 the whole map is open to you... I was addressing the low lvl player who are having trouble adjusting
---
The game is now lvl sync but there are also lvl range per area.. flatwood area cap at lvl50 while they southeastern nuke zone cap at lvl100 
---
So a lvl24 will be better off killing the lvl50 (lvl sync lvl50) then compare to eastern area where they are above lvl50
---
You should try bloddied unarmed! My meat hook dropped from around 900 damage to around 250-300. If you get detected by more than 1 enemy youre dead. They need to make some adjustments and I really hope they do something soon.
---
oh what a shame
---
Well I'm sure the majority of any balancing they wanted to do was heavily sidelined by damage control through bug-fixing after release to get the game to a playable state. Then content like Wastelanders, etc. taking up a lot of development time as well. They also probably realized that they needed to do some necessary groundwork to the overall system (one wasteland) before doing any specific balancing otherwise they'd just have a bigger list of shit to undo. They're not going to just leave the game as it is currently.
---
One Wasteland may be rough for some players right now but I think it's a much needed foundation for some good balancing to come down the road. But I also think it's a crossroads for how some people would like the game to play vs. what Bethesda wants their game to be. I know some people want this to be a stand-in for Fallout 5 but at the end of the day it's a multiplayer game and being able to one-shot literally everything because of extreme number-cheese is not conducive to a healthy game balance in the first place.
---
As a PA Heavy Gunner, I also have a stealth rifleman alt that literally still works fine. Still can kill and it doesn't take long at all. Everyones just pissy they can't one shot or do shit tons of damage without a few extra bullets. Stealth builds aren't useless, you guys are just complaining because you have to work a little harder.
---
Not only do we not want to change everything again, but we have to ask ourselves:  even if we change everything up, will they just change/nerf everything in six months so that the new positions are worthless and we have to go back to what we had or onto something else?
---
I tested my bloodied as well as a ts gauss and while it was definitely effective I just....hate them lmao. Settling into that commando life. It’s odd because I feel I’m doing more damage post update with the switch. Daily ops burn the ammo though trying to stay alive with a vamp’s weapon
---
I think that is the rarest reward
---
Your chances of getting a rare drop are 95% tier 1- 5% tier 2- 10% tier 3- 80% if you complete it after reset and haven’t done it that day all the rewards stack on top of each other. Have a awesome fallout!
---
What about the fact that Demo Expert and Sneak attacks in VATS literally are broken and do nothing now. 
---
My Crit Build is dogshit now. 
---
Like I've got these cards that are essentially meant to do something, and because a fundamental part of the game IE: Sneak attacks in Fallouts most famous system (VATS) literally does not work now I am essentially completely redundant.
---
&gt; Oh no, high levels can't hang around the forest anymore for easymode faceroll gameplay.
---
I literally explained why this was an issue *to me* according to my *completely subjective tastes* two posts above. Do you always have this bad habit of ignoring what people say just so you can be a condescending smartass?
---
They could have applied One Wasteland to everything else *but* the forest for a middle ground.
---
Groups of enemies are harder because they have more chances to attack you before dying since each enemy takes slightly longer to kill. 
---
You see this enemy group difficulty in daily ops.
---
However end game groups of players will still wreck shop.
---
They said they wanted damage more predictable/balanced not that they were trying to make the game harder..that's just the consequence of balance.
---
Why should some scrub who just entered Appalachia get the same perks as some lv300 dude? New character = New stats.
---
My bloodied limb damage Gauss shotgun dropped from 2400 to 1200 without adrenaline
---
I agree, bulking is the way to go I reckon. Just add a "Bulk Ammo" section to the Tinkers workbench and bulk it the same way you do with broken down scrap. 
---
I'd also like the chance to sell this to Vendor Bots. You'd probably need to set it so that you don't earn many caps from the Vendor Bots for bulk ammo to avoid further breaking the currency system, but I tend to find that Vendor Bots tend to pay relatively poorly for items anyway, so it would probably be in keeping with that in any case.
---
If the developers are catering to a guy with 300 hours in the game that is having trouble playing with his 10 hour in wife ... I feel like they’ve lost site of their core Fallout audience. Why don’t we just make it like Fallout Shelter and automate everything. 
---
Let’s switch it to a FarmVille model and make everything based around a bunch of timed dailies and limits on ... oh damn.
---
Find some armor with the reduce damage by 15% while blocking effect and your new shotgun will be magic too.
---
I got the Burrows signage yesterday, but nothing today.  
---
It's a bit of a downer, especially since today was Vault 94, but that's how it goes.  
---
Better luck tomorrow.
---
Ok wasnt aware of have far into it they are going i thought it was only when you could us real money buy buying in game currency. That's a bit disappointing for people in those region.
---
oh, I wish they'd fix so many things.
---
They think they should be able to one tap everything and it's ridiculous lol they're complaining because they have to work a little harder now
---
I am aware, however if you reload your Gatling Laser when it's low and put the near dead fusion core in your PA and let yourself get shot with laser weapons it's basically free ammo.
---
You can buy?
---
I’d like to see 1 and 2 star legendary power armor. I don’t think 3 star until weapons and armors get 4 or 5 stars. Also it would sweet if set bonuses were added to all armors including p.a. It doesn’t have to be extreme, just like +10% movement speed or reload or something.
---
Everything about this statement is incorrect
---
Not only is there a Sneak nerf, Sneak attacks in VATS literally do not work anymore.
---
Easy, its melee to KILL. 
---
In the times ive run it on my own and with others, we all shoot till they have the sliver of health and then bash with the gun. 
---
The only hard thing about the operation was the number or robots
---
Let them go... let them go...

---
That was one example, they want players to play the game together. IT's not supposed to be a anti-social single player experience.
---
They want balance it for people who want to explore together as well as having solo as still an option.
---
I've learned it the first time and had the spare in my inventory, then got it again today.
---
You mean when zenurik was just a passive? The trees haven't been that big then :D
---
😆
---
Use guns till they dont do damage, then gun bash. 
---
This one was insanely easy.
---
I think there's been some odd misunderstanding here - your comment reads fine to me.
---
I'm in the same boat as you...lvl 110, solo player, and prefer open world exploring without constant combat.  I'm waiting for a week of playtime before I pass judgement on the new update. I'm trying to figure out a way to adapt my play style to the new reality.  So far I'm not digging it...
---
I would like to see a honeycomb bait mine.  Just for bears.  Gooey, bloody mess.
---
At least A Colossal Problem allows stealth to be an option. While not particular practical for group play, I’ve stayed in camo and taken potshots with a silenced weapon. No way to do that in Daily Ops.
---
# 😢
---
who cares, just play the game. we had a huge REBALANCE going on, no one cares the numbers written on a gun.
---
ya they are BOSS FIGHTS. bosses have always been spongy af you aren't supposed to kill them with one clip
---
Just to let the OP know in the patch notes was a line that the issue of items floating off the ground inside the communist bunker was fixed.
---
Don't have that item so don't know if actually fixed but its something to check out.
---
But it also heals you. You can just stand in an Assaultron's laser and your health stays topped off.
---
well that sucks.  especially since the description says it does and the picture appears to show it casting light. any sound effect? thanks for the reply
---
Yes that could work, but to me it seems like to much of a hassle lol.
---
The ops have made it so stealth no longer works in them.
---
During radiation rumble, save your radaways and use the rad shower in the middle. This shower is only on during the event.
---
Powerful Auto
---
I also absolutely love that the selling point was supposed to be that you can play with your friends anywhere regardless of what level they are. What fun! Go enjoy the Wasteland! But then they also added a bunch of new quests that are 50+ only, No Babies Allowed. And then you go to the starter areas and events that are supposedly for you and get walloped anyway. I was doing Campfire Tales with a ton of people and we bombed it because everyone was too busy trying not to die to keep the campfire going. I've never seen anyone fail Campfire Tales before.
---
So really, the whole game kind of feels like No Babies Allowed after the patch, and as someone who has played on and off from launch and always ends up making new characters, it's really not very welcoming. The community is usually super warm and friendly, it's the game itself.
---
This is exactly what's going on. People want this to be a single player Fallout God mode simulator and that's just not what this game is.
---
Have u even tried shooting anything yet?  
---
I didn’t look at no damage number. Loaded up yesterday and went straight to west tek. 
---
100lvl mutants dies just as EZ.  Couple more shots. No biggie
---
That’s about right, my BE Gat went down 40%. It’s all about spray and pray now. Ammo Factory is very useful.
---
If you’ve had no problems then it must not have been much of an inconvenience 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Imagine thinking it is ok for bad game design to lead to you hiding behind a corner to draw enemies in for extended periods of time during a timed event. 
---
Of course I used the walls to los the mobs, stop assuming everyone who doesnt like this game mode/has issues with it is stupid. I am fine with the damage being the way it is and would have never voiced a complaint if some thirteen year old intern hadnt suggested that ranged mobs who ai tells them to always increase the distance between themselves and the player can ONLY be killed by one specific thing that most players dont do very often if ever. Its bad, lazy game design and as a result has ruined that entire game mode for me.
---
You Sir haven’t haven’t met my indecisive ass. Heavy gunner? Yes please...wait I want pistol now. Happens all the time.
---
I agree. I just think it's funny it happend literally 2 days after finally maxing my rep.
---
And you can cycle out fusion cores into your PA to top them off.
---
The illusion of content. Make enemies harder so you work more. Now go back and buy some more atoms for uncle todd
---
I wasn't truly free until I dropped 112 lbs of known plans. Just lean into it man. You can do it.
---
If they allowed this to be sold to vendorbots, I’d honestly think they’d need to ‘revalue’ Mini Nikes, Missiles and 40mm grenades.  Those drop a lot and have a way higher inherent Base Value than I think makes sense.
---
*Nukes, not Nikes, lol. Can’t have Nike shoes in the Wasteland. That breaks immersion.
---
I didn't realize the chainsaw could even be crafted? That poor weapon has been so neglected. So have a bunch of weapons really.
---
Kinda funny it's such a big part of one of the other games published by Bethesda and it's so worthless in this game.
---
I was actually excited about several of the rewards this season, but I'm not sure I see the point in logging on even just to grind out the dailies anymore either. Why waste my time earning cosmetic rewards for a game that doesn't feel fun or remotely rewarding to progress in anymore? When I was actually enjoying playing the game, earning those items felt worthwhile, but now, not so much.
---
Bunker was bugged already. Everything floats in it and I had 1 spot it would let me put things on the walls in it, the rest didn't work. So I'm not surprised considering it was already in the shitter
---
you know how quickly fast traveling can add up in caps? I've spent hundreds a day doing my day to day shit. it gets ex-fucking-pensive
---
Some of that is already present.
---
What Rads legendary perk applies to both PA and non-PA.  (Level2, and I take no rads when hit by ghouls Ghouls)
---
As a byproduct of STR, you can carry more ammo.
---
Motion assist servos on the torso (+2 STR), marsupial mutation....
---
legendary STR, WWR by Bear Arms, Ammo WR by both bandolier in STR for ballistic and batteries included in INT for energy ammo.
---
You arlready know about Stabilized in INT, and there are a couple other heavy weapon perks in other categories....
---
Oh, and the new weight bench gives +2 STR bonus for either 30 min or 1/2 hr, I forget which.
---
Could be to make it less laggy but yeah it does feel a bit to zoomed in.
---
That sucks... damn.. I was hoping that we wouldn't get duplicates, especially so if we learned the plan.
---
I just love it when my Hack and Slash perk triggers and those molerats learn to fly. Other than that, I expected worse, I can get by pretty well.
---
Yeah that's like the best thing you could have gotten though. If I get it today I'm hopping right over to the trading sub 😋😋😋
---
This. A full reset should of been in the game from day one. I’m a huge fan of Bethesda’s past work(meaning I played Skyrim) and all those games to my knowledge had a full respec. It adds so much replay-ability.
---
Also I don't see the markers for myself and the subjegator (spelling?)
---
On the old season, Dr zorbo had a little space ship.
---
You can only get one rare reward a day and it is random what you get.
---
Edit: I stand corrected, read replies.
---
Bloodied effect (5% dmg for every 5% hp loss) caps out at under 5% health. Nerd rage and adrenal reaction are capped at 20%.
---
Sorry, can’t believe I forgot to add that it was explosive!! 🤦‍♂️
---
I felt exactly how you feel, last night.  I can tell you that before you give up, because I kinda secretly wanted to also, that you just adjust course.  I'm trying to do that myself.   Thinking of how to approach things differently.  When I first started playing I felt so frustrated (coming from a level 95 FO4 character).  I constantly had stuff happen to me, broken weapons, no armor, feeling lost and also having jerk players trying to kill me and break my camp. Literally level 1-18 was hell on earth (flat wasteland earth). Oh and VATS didn't work for me at all!  It just started working about 10 levels ago.  But I met someone that totally helped me out and was just like a light shining in the darkness and made me want to play again (put game away for 3 months) and in the last month I've gone from lvl 18 to 48.  I also had two other kick-ass people just randomly give me stuff I absolutely needed at that time without knowing it.  It was the resolve and the encouragement from that awesome human I found in a game and those kick-ass strangers after having been met with so much toxicity that helped me keep going.  So, look my PSN up, I will gladly be that friend if you need. Always pay it forward.  At the very least, we can absolutely loath dying to wild mongrels with a new friend. Haha.
---
Yes, new alcohol recipe that makes you immune to wendigo colossus fear.
---
Its very generous with the 5mm ultracite.
---
With the 2ec each enemy drops 4 on death. 
---
They don't drop ultracite plasma or ultracite fusion cores. 
---
Seems as though if you're rocking a 5mm gun you'll never run low on ammo
---
That is exactly how I felt,  it I gave up in the boss when I realized how little damage my weapons were doing. I ended up in that same office and thought I could whittle her down. But nah, I unloaded almost all of my .308s from my ***vampire mutant heavy machine gun, and her health bar had barely moved. When I died and came back to find her full health again I was freaking done and peeved. I agree, that mutation combo is too much for me.
---
Praise the Lord and pass the amunition.
---
That was a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ityr64/i_was_about_to_reinstall_this_game_but_update_22/g5hj5c0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3) post to Miller like an hour ago.
---
Check to make sure you’re not tagged as following me or something.
---
Using a vampire-sledge as melee I dont realy noticed any difference so far. Neither in normal gameplay  nor in operations. The incoming heal is still ticking nicely.
---
Yes. If you finish as elder on your first run you get 3 rolls. If you finish as initiate you get roll for that, then you still have a chance to get a reward from knight and elder.
---
It depends on the specific weapon of course, but 5-8k for a good weapon that you'll be using lots is an alright price. You will eventually get to point where you'll be looking for ways to offload excess caps anyway, so I wouldn't worry about over paying if it's for something you truly want. Remember, you can only ever have 30k caps at a time. You can also look for trading communities, but speaking of such things is not allowed on this sub reddit. There's another marketplace sub that rhymes with r / par k et 76 you can try.
---
I'm not saying you do. Just... for those who feel this game has been ruined for them to play solo, maybe it's time to make friends.
---
It has a very faint, somewhat static-sounding, but constant "burning" noise.
---
I thought the previous season grind was a bit much. With the current update there is no way i am putting myself through all that again
---
Ah damn, that’s pretty much the only thing im low on unfortunately. I burn through circuits repairing mainframe cores!
---
Yeah I didn't really notice a difference either
---
I need Nv on the switch.
---
I was kind of unsure about getting Ammo Factory before the patch because I didn't understand how legendary perks actually worked. I thought I'd be limited to one and I was really liking the look of Master Infiltrator. I was blown away when I found out I could have up to *four* equipped (presumably because of my level 150 character unlocking a bunch of slots) so it was zero hesitation to put that sucker on right away.
---
Maxed out rifleman, but the hunting rifle is still too slow and doesn’t do enough damage anymore even from sneak, and other semi-autos expend too much ammo.
---
Tried a laser rifle, I thought my game was bugged when it took half a clip to kill an ant
---
I thought you can get more than one but it's just a lower chance?
---
As a fellow casual player just broke 100 a couple weeks ago. I have a sneaky rifleman build as well. I finally got dmg numbers close to 500 and even then I was no help during SBQ fights and blew threw lots of ammo. I don't even see the point in logging on just so the boring ass scorched that spawn near my camp will clean me out of ammo and stims. I mean if they are gonna make the game harder then they should up the legendary spawns and guarantee 3* items from 3* enemies. They literally keep turning this game into more and more chores, it feels like a job I have to clock into everyday or I'm left behind or losing out. I don't play games to add to my stress I play them to relax and have fun. That's not what 76 does for me anymore.
---
I've been putting them in my vending machine for 0 caps, sometimes I get cleaned out, most times people just take what they need.
---
To be fair I only have a day playing it so I’ll give it some time for sure. I had to go with the Ammo perk as I was tearing through ammo almost right away.
---
I had trouble at first getting killed. A lot of running around helped. Also helped to get the room down to 0 health than equip a mele weapon and finish them off. If you are efficient enough you will have a few seconds to regroup before the next wave.
---
Yeah, unfortunately Bethesda reacted surprisingly fast now.
---
I haven't been able to get on since the new update!! Help me bethesda!!!
---
Yes, done a few events - the most obvious is low level scorched, used to be 1 shot, now 4 or 5
---
Ammosmith should only be equipped when actively crafting ammo, just like you do with Super Duper. Those 2 points are better used for other perks when out fighting.  You will want to maximize damage and combat perks and minimize quality of life perks and swap in situational perks only as needed.
---
No. You have a chance to get a plan from each rank. 5% chance from initiate, 10% from knight and 80% from elder. If you finish your first run as elder you will complete all ranks, and you get 3 rolls with the %'s i wrote above. So it's possible to get 3 rewards from the ops loot list, but you would have to be pretty lucky.
---
EDIT: All cards are worth 2 per star making all this wrong. Keeping for the work put in though.
---
Here is some information:
---
* A Standard card is worth 2 points per star.
---
* An Animated card is worth 5 points per star.
---
* You get a pack every 5 levels containing 3 Standard cards and a single Animated one.
---
Using an unoptimized method, of 21 points per 5 levels, you can max out a Legendary card (300 points) in ~71 levels.
---
This can be optimized by selecting cards in the individual levels to rank up the last Animated card you got from a pack to max.
---
Doing this increases the value of the Standard cards from 2 to 5 a star. When ranking up cards, as long as one of the cards is Animated the resulting card will be as well.
---
With the optimized setup it will only take ~55 levels per max Legendary. Using this method you will be able to almost max out all equipped Legendarys by the time you have all the slots available. (level 300, 6 cards)
---
Edit: Fixed Math and Formating
---
I got the WitD plan and you can craft it, requiring 2 legendary modules
---
Who is whining? If you're implying people that recognized how absolutely cornball bloodied builds are and thought it was kinda dogshit that they could show up to events and kill mobs so fast that others were literally unable to benefit from the event are "whiners" then I think you have some self-reflecting to do. It was a common occurrence to see mid-level players actually just give up trying to participate in certain events because mobs are killed so quickly that they don't even realize where they spawned at before they're deleted from the map.
---
That is a HUGE problem in a multiplayer game. If you want a solo god-mode experience Fallout 4 GOTY is over half off on Amazon right now. PS. A 10% damage nerf is hardly "bullshit." That equates to what, maybe 3 extra seconds of shooting?
---
It's not though. There are no worthwhile rewards. Just the same junk as anything else. Ooo, a new toy for a camp...meh.
---
Not when there’s a timetable involved. ;)
---
Well spotted, I don't see the two characters either.
---
I just did one with exploding blood eagles.
---
PS4 doesn’t have high frame rate, so it’s not consistent to depend on magic weapons right?
---
actually bashing with the rifle butt works fine
---
Wow you are toxic af.
---
gotcha. i was unaware there is a cap on caps, great info. i appreciate it!
---
Daily Ops ARE repeatable dungeons.
---
Oh well I’d hope I’d at least do that much at level 33 but whatever haha
---
I don't find that true at all.
---
I usually only play one character in that kind of game (mainly because I don't enjoy replaying a story), and I choose to not fall in that "exclusive build" logic. I keep what I do with a very versatile setup, and I swap my perks when I need to, between Heavy Weapon, Rifleman Sniper or Melee. 
---
In fact, the +SPECIAL legendary cards actually facilitate versatility a lot.
---
I played a lot on the PTS and I never found myself blocked by anything.
---
Your AP may have stopped regenerating because that's a side effect of being shot by robobrains.
---
I have a jffr gauss minigun and I never felt the magic effect, am I doing anything wrong?
---
Aside from that, I'm enjoying the new content. 
---
I'm enjoying the Daily OPS.
---
I'm enjoying the Smooth improvements of server optimisation due to less conflicting coding.

I'm even enjoying having to put a few more rounds into enemies.
---
But when Sneak Attacks in VATS, Demo Expert, and many more features literally do not even work, Bugs still remain, and those beautiful 1-shot methods still exist after countless hours of PTS work done by many of us, it is somewhat concerning.
---
I put 4 in ammo factory, 3 in take one for the team, 1 in electrical absorption , power armor reboot, and str. No regerts whatsoever.
---
I had so much fun running around low-level areas with weak weapons and just popping off enemies! That's been taken away from me, as is the peace of my camp!  
---
I intentionally kept my camp in a low-level area so I never had to put too much thought into defense and now the level 50 enemies are messing up my shit and I had to scrap a TON of my camp to afford the defense against stronger attacks.
---
I have felt no difference, infact using my main guns it feels the same or better.  Ammo usage is about the same also.   
---
However I do not play a any rifle builds so yeah. My melee feels fine, my gunslinger with the QoL from the legendary perks feels improved, my two heavy gunners (one is pure energy the other is a ballistic only) really see no difference. My 5th toon is a fuck around toon with no focused build living with only pure QoL no +damage perks I haven't touched yet.
---
You know as soon as you min-max yourself into a specific build, they'll think of a way to nerf or bug that, right?
---
I'm a sneaky stealth build using silenced automatics and mainly Chinese Stealth Armour and I absolutely LOVE the changes.  It's fun to play again.
---
Still running bloodied just fine.
---
See there you go again, spewing vile that you have no clue about. It's apparent that you honestly don't have a clue pertaining to the things you say/type. Your response was "so your a hero for killing women and children in a foreign country", so please do tell how you know what I or any of the other top notch soldiers did while on tour? Apparently you have direct knowledge of Intel from within the combat zone, to make such a bold and pointed comment about killing women &amp; children in a foreign country. Matter of fact in order for someone to have such direct knowledge pertaining to events while on tour, that would insinuate that you were or are a U.S. service member, because that's the only people who have even a remote clue of what is done in a combat zone... I'll give you a hand... We both know you haven't done a single thing honorable for your country, as well as we both know you simply leech off the sacrifices brave men and women lost their lives, limbs, sanity over. Ultimately I don't you whatsoever, but it only took a matter of less than an hour to explicitly see that your greatest attribute is apparently attempting to tear others down. It's also easy to see that you truly don't have a clue about the things you are making heavy accusations about (doesn't get heavier that accusations of murdering women &amp; children), as well as there are no limits as to the amount of vile your willing to simply up and say to someone. There's no point in continuing this conversation. Have a good day
---
Sorry to bother you but: is sneak broken? Not for daily ops for everything else. I have over 30 agility, 4 uny armor 3*sneak card and 1*escape artist. I cant stay hidden with Anyone on my team in "danger"....
---
The rebalance hit some of us hard but sneak may be the hardest hit. Ty!
---
He is mistaken. You have 3 chances, one from each rank.
---
They’ve made it more like Borderlands now, which does this exact thing - gives you enemies your level.  
---
You can choose what you’re fighting.  If you get your hands on a ghoul slayer weapon, you’ll be more effective vs. ghouls.  Then you can prioritize areas that have mostly ghouls and do far better than against other enemy types.  If you are wearing Raider armor that has higher ballistic damage resistance than energy resistance, so take on things that shoot or punch more than fire lasers.  Again, this isn’t about min/maxing, just just doing what makes sense for what you have.  
---
It is not ridiculously hard - not all my characters are even level 50 yet, one is still in his early 10s.  It’s fine.  At rank 10 you don’t even HAVE a lot of perk options, but I travel smartly and focus on things that will get me XP and resources.  
---
This game *was* intended to be a multiplayer game. You should be trying to work with a team to accomplish things
---
Explain to me how a dog cripples a giant metal walking tank 😂
---
I always wanted a reason to use gun bashing and bayonets more often. Guess I have it now.
---
seems like the easiest fix would be to remove frog legs and the gauss shotgun. add in marsupial as a mutation.
---
I used my fixer and did ok. I did a lot of running around and hiding while bringing the room down to 0. Than equip my bat and cleaned up. Hide again and regroup and repeat. Sitting in hallways or single entrance areas made it easier to bring down to 0 health on multiple bots at the same time.
---
What would a fraction of a cap be called?
---
I have fire proof and a vampire flamer my health never dipped below 90%
---
I LOVE the changes!  Level 100 radtoads right outside my camp.  Amazing!
---
It isn't impossible as a Bloodied build. I ran in a Team of 4 Bloodied Commandos last night using melee weapons. Just need to perk up
---
No, it’s fine! I’m running some numbers to see how high you can still get. 
---
I’ve got it set like this: 
---
BE Fixer with Hardened, Perforating, and Suppressor mods.
---
Player health at 19. Not sneaking (turning this on would of course do more damage.)
---
Cards: All weapon damage cards. Bloody Mess. Demo Expert. Tank Killer. Nerd Rage. Covert Operative.
---
Adrenal Reaction mutation. 
---
Buffs: Psychobuff, Small Guns.
---
Without sneak: 212 damage per shot. 3.3 hits per sec. 702 damage per second.
---
With sneak, no Covert Op: 425 damage per shot, 1404 dps.
---
With sneak, with Covert Op: 531 damage per shot, 1755 dps.
---
Of course, a revive buff from Revenant would help too.
---
Yes, the Faction vendors (such as Mortimer) sell them 100 bullion each.  It’s expensive, but is at least something do with bullion once you have what you want for gear.
---
Lvl 50 now I assume as well.
---
&gt;Because it's easier living in the Forest area than the Savage Divide, where they gave yao-gaui and floaters? This isn't hard.
---
Was reading my post hard?
---
"Certainly, there being more dangerous creatures might attract stronger  individuals or weed out weaker ones - but not to the point that one  Super Mutant dies from a single bodyshot with a 10mm while another takes  a dozen rounds to the head. "
---
Living somewhere with mutated bears doesn't explain the drastic, completely illogical different in toughness between a Super Mutant capped at level 10 and a level 65 Super Mutant. The idea of a level 100+ player returning to the forest and enemy bullets being barely noticeable even without Power Armor is not sensible or lore-compliant. To pretend otherwise is to either be disingenuous or willfully obtuse.
---
&gt;And no, everything feels very samey now, like there's no consideration  about who exists where and any sort of mounting difficulty.
---
I'm not terribly interested in how you "feel"; I'm more concerned with the demonstrable fact that a level 50 Super Mutant in the Forest is still easier to kill than a level 75 Super Mutant in the Savage Divide.
---
Moreover, a level 50 yao guai in the Divide is still going to be more dangerous than a level 50 wolf in the Forest.
---
&gt;It's definitely a problem between players who don't care about the game  and use it as a platform to just level up and those who see it in terms  of role - playing, etc, and lament those last vestiges disappearing.
---
Spare me the melodrama and patting your own back, thanks.
---
Yes, but at the cost of everyone who has invested time. If you remove the edge or challenge for new players and make it more and more of a drain to kill enemies at high levels, I just don’t see how that rewards players or makes it more fun for those who are invested. I understand their reasoning for doing it, I understand that many players like the change, but I personally don’t agree with it and don’t think it makes for a better player experience.
---
I thought it was a pretty neat fight. Then again, I wear a full set of Troubleshooter armor on a tanky heavy gunner. The end boss was the only time I really almost died.
---
So I can indeed repeat it and I'll eventually get something?
---
Im in a similar boat as you. Level 250 and I finally just started to feel like my build was Allmost perfect. Just needed a specific secret service armor roll and it would have been complete. Jumped on it today and it is trashed. These changes are horrible. I play to have fun. Not grind for ammo or spend more time grinding for decent gear.
---
Honestly Between the avengers game, cyberpunk,the pokemon sword dlc and the mario all stars collection im set for games for a while. Maybe ill check back when the brotherhood dlc drops but probably won’t stay after beating it. Unless Bethesda does some major improvements my interest in this game is pretty low. So excellent job Bethesda. You probably just drove away a decent number of players
---
yes, added with the patch yesterday you can buy from the faction vendors (such as Mortimer) lunchboxes for 100 gold each. Expensive, but better than nothing to use your gold on once you have anything else you wanted.
---
Why not turn on pacifist mode so they can't start combat?
---
Damn dog, 2-3 extra shots?!?! What a difficulty spike!
---
This is starting to get ridiculous. These posts complaining about shooting 2 extra bullets or losing literally TEN points of damage on a gun causing people to leave the game reads like satire...
---
Then you realize these are legitimate complaints. This shit is asinine.
---
Edit: I don't mean to sound like an asshole really but it's just wild to me reading some of this feedback. To respond to your min/max comment you could also argue that this patch does the opposite of catering to min/maxers because most people that follow that path ended up doing bloodied builds for the ridiculous damage numbers and they are the ones that got hit the hardest. Rightfully so in my opinion.
---
Probably cos they realised people just bought 1 round 3 times
---
Oh really, I apparently missed that part but it's good to hear that they fixed it. Thanks you for the knowledge👍🏼
---
Sure explains why I was selling so much stuff. Don’t think I lost anything but lots more visitors
---
But them in your vendor for 1 cap each. Someone will buy. Or start a mule and drop them all there
---
Since a lot of in games instances are tied to level 50, I think Bethesda could look at it again and tie the level matching to level 50 and above. 
---
I also see it being highly discouraging to new players.
---
I’m glad you tested it out as an experienced player with a new character.
---
*bRo*, I know when I tagged you. It was **an hour ago**. 
---
You really want to start up again after we parted ways amicably?  You already had one post deleted by mods.  
---
If you want to start up again, you’ll do it on your own. I’m not getting into a pointless argument and risking a tempban from the subreddit. If you want to push it, it’s all on you. 
---
I’m done arguing with you.
---
*And you deleted your other comment while I was typing this up. So who’s playing games now?*
---
***And now you’ve deleted THIS ONE!  LOL***
---
Have a good life, kid.
---
UGH....too late. that was one of the first things I went for was higher charisma. Very frustrating that they can't get it together enough to make the extra legendary charisma points work like normal ones.  What a waste.
---
I hear ya. Appreciate you asking though
---
I didn’t even use legendary. I just crafted one. Gave it the most range I could and went to town. Legendary one would be even better. Hopefully you won’t get mass fps drops like I was.
---
Mine too brother. Unstoppable Monster ..so sad.
---
Yeh today was prolly the easiest of all combos, whereas yesterday the most diff. Compared to yesterday, I solo'd this in 7m 30s. Yesterday I couldn't make enough inv space and ran it solo overencumbered at 9m 58s :( granted I didn't have much time to play and couldn't retry
---
I definitely notice a difference when covert operatives is off. It's the one I take down to put up Ammo Smith. So, I sometimes forget about it and wonder why I'm only doing half damage.  I don't know how all of them really matter now, but it did make a difference lol
---
Edit: idk the exact damage difference, half was an exaggeration
---
I did a lot of running and hiding and did ok.  Using my fixer and usually a hallway or a single entrances area I could bring down multiple bots to 0 at the same time. Than equip my bat to finish them off. So basically run/hide/attack/bash/regroup/repeat.
---
Right? I’m laughing my way through elder on this. But I’m fine with that after the hell we had yesterday
---
I went from 1700 to 330 on my stealth commando.
---
Ditto, PS4 as well. I thought maybe it was just a once per day buff or something.
---
Wow.   I saw that pop today and wondered how it was going to go.   Thanks for letting us know.
---
SNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKE!
---
Idk why the downvotes. Electrical absorption is a MUST HAVE for PA users. Turns enemies like the Imposter Sheepsquatch into a walking super stimpak for you. It's OP and I frankly hope to see it nerfed but they won't because people have spent hundreds of coins on it.
---
This is how I play, too.  I want to keep my rads down and my health up.  I prefer rifles.  But I'm now completely out of .308 ammo, and down to about 100 .45 for my revolver rifle thing.  I won't be playing again any time soon.  The couple of hours I played last night and today burned through my entire ammo and Stimpack stockpile and all of my armor is broken.  No thanks.  Hard pass.
---
"Don't play stealth". 
---
Gee, thanks champ.
---
anything is a joke compared to robots + resilient. bashing is so infuriatingly inefficient and robots are exponentially stronger than humans or super mutants.
---
You make a good point, the sad thing is that I've been playing since release and I couldn't get to lvl 200 yet xD
---
Yes exactly!
---
Yes, shoot them and just bash when the health is at a sliver. I have only done it twice (with a decent team). Finished the first in 8:40 and the second in 7:10. No deaths. Hardest part is just finding the right room quickly in the maze-environment.
---
How is your armor holding up with all those shots? Mine is getting eaten alive. Which pisses me off because ranged get more bullets so they can just use a gatling laser like its a hobby. Where as ill have to ebay some dupers balistic fiber if i play a moderate amount.
---
Yes I have two. Dm me so we don’t get in trouble
---
Ive said all the same things and got flamed. Now everyone is agreeing with me 100%. The game is ruined i have no reason to waste ammo on bullet sponges for nothing. Its honestly trash now. Ive burned double the stims and way more than that on ammo for what?
---
I would be pissed if they nerfed it. Especially after them saying its working as intended.
---
just change the doorway to a wall. We already got that feature back (in exchange for losing the flamethrower trap method)
---
Might I recommend something more like [this](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1d445fe&amp;d=s01pg2ph2pi2pp2e31ek1cu2ce0ir2ic1a72a04l71lt2p00ar2ao0an2lv2lr2lk2x00xm0xa0&amp;m=5c2f87ba).
---
Note that Strength is being boosted by the Legendary perk. The thouhht is I'll be using this to get more QoL weight reducing perks as I go. Legendary Intelligence can also be used to get Demolition Expert into the build if you use a rifle with explpsove bullets.
---
If you prefer not to run as a bloodied build, Nerd Rage can be swapped for more Gunsmith and Revenant can be traded out for whatever suits you more.
---
A couple more rounds, hell even 10 more rounds, to kill something is not an ammo sink stop being ridiculous. Try other FPS mmos like destiny or something and then we’ll talk ammo sink.
---
Dopeee
---
in my defense i always used to just give my plans away, but then i read this random post somebody made wondering if just maybe the Brotherhood might have some sort of Scribe set up to turn in plans.... ever since that day i just have been holding out hope :-O
---
There is no realistic explanation as to why you shoot something in the face 8 times with a shotgun, but it doesn't die until you melee it. I play fallout for immersion, and this variant of daily ops makes it feel more like an arcade game.
---
Ignoring SCORE is a lot easier than you'd think. The only thing you'll miss this season is the greenhouse kit.
---
The challenges for daily Ops changes, I think they made a poor choice for the first live one. But two people shooting, one or two people killing the low health mobs works, even with random group members.
---
I'm gonna correct something. The damage nerf wasn't designed to make the game more difficult. One Wasteland was.
---
The damage nerf is a change to damage calculations changing from Multiplicative into Additive. The nerf wasn't even a goal but rather a side effect.
---
Most of everything else is true. Bethesda has said this is a step towards rebalancing. All we have to do is hold out and make sure that gets implemented next.
---
Weirdly the first op I did had camouflaged Blood Eagles which were a pain in the arse as I was on a vats toon. I think humans will come out weakest but I'm curious how mutants compare. Multiple miniguns would be problematic.
---
Yao Guais are the real end game bosses.  Especially when there is a group of them
---
Have to tame one of those bad boys now that they scale I think that will be a huge boost to camp defense right there
---
You can get the cores as rewards
---
Turrets don’t heal, only laser weapons, is that correct?
---
make me. I'll complain and try to exploit mechanics to get ahead of the curve until they pry legacies off my cold, dead hands.
---
subjectivity is a \*. I disagree 100%. and a ton of people struggling to kill even the trashiest of mobs would agree with me.
---
That's why I'm never moving from my current underground CAMP. No way people can get to vendors when the entrance to my CAMP hasn't loaded yet.
---
ANY sneak build currently that utilises VATS is completely redundant. As Sneak attacks in VATS does not work anymore. It is as they say "Broken".
---
Demo Expert does not work on the explosive prefix as it should, as well.
---
I dont think anyone struggling with the mode is stupid, they just don't understand basic shooter gameplay patterns which sort of understandable as a quasi-rpg that didn't have any content requiring tactical thinking before this.
---
*nose-wrinkles*
---
I agree, but you don't have to boop me.
---
No thanks.  I'm not a social person and have no interest in interacting with people I don't know in games.  I only bought the game last week because I read that they expanded the "campaign" story line and it was viable to play solo.  Which was true, and quite fun, until yesterday.  I did buy a copy for a friend, seeing as I was having a blast, but he'll be in the same boat as I am at level 21.  I should tell him to refund it before he even plays it.
---
I was never able to one tap anything before i was always having ammo issues before and this has literally made the game impossible 1 Mr gutsy shouldn't take a whole fusion core out of a laser gatling to kill.
---
yeah i deleted th because we did part amicably and I realized I was starting it up again. Sorry its been a rough couple months my emotions are all over the place I deletes them quickly because I didn't want you to see and start all over again. im not playing any games with you im just trying to not get in another argument with someone who I would probably like irl. again hope we meet in the wasteland as friends
---
Yeah man today's was an absolute breeze
---
There are tons of magic shotguns! I have a two shot limb dmg double barrel that one shots most standard enemies with no perks in shotgun dmg. Great secondary weapon for heavy gun users
---
I mean my lever is dealing out 256 damager per shot atm, along with 380 for my gauss rifle, which isn’t terrible.
---
However, automatic will *always* have a higher dps than single shot due to the ammo usage. Those are the pros and cons of each weapon. If you have single shot rifles do the same dps, there will be absolutely no reason to use automatic over single shot.
---
100% with you. My gf used to play on my profile and she woulda been the awesomest casual. Not an option now. Sony and bethesda missed a sale on this choice
---
Edit: we were gonna get another system and play together. She is no longer interested lol.
---
Im addicted so ill be here til that wears off (started)
---
Its great now, before it was just a barren world with skeet shooting. Kinda funny seeing all the Melee/Unarmed people cry about it.
---
It is not a bug. They have came out and said it is intended
---
I maxed it out, and I am not regretting it.  I use it with vanguard solar armor so its easier to stay max health now.
---
So what you're saying is that if we give them the benefit of the doubt for the umpteenth time, for this one of many, many deficiencies, we will eventually have a functional product?
---
I paid full price for this game over a year ago. Why am I still waiting for it to be ironed out? 
---
Why do people still excuse this?
---
-edit- Adding to this, they've had the time for their coding team to figure out how to add mannequins for displaying power armor and clothing in camps, something monetisable, but they couldn't figure out how to make shotguns or laser rifles not garbage?
---
I guess maybe it's a new group of players playing now, I've been playing since barely the release off the game I was a month shy maybe. 
---
Along with fallout 3 to present 
---
They actually used to be called unique weapons when 3 started
---
It's intended.  It's meant to even the playing field between power armor and regular armor and I think it does a good job.
---
You were also at 100% health, and had a vampire weapon and other things I'm sure.  It's not op, just good.
---
Prime Automatic receiver paired with Ammosmith and the legendary perk Ammo Factory makes a TON of 5.56 per craft. Much more than crafting regular ammo.
---
Running through Lucky Hole Mine with Excavator power armor (for the 2x ore yield from nodes) combined with Super Duper will net you about 1200 lead per run on a decent run.
---
What you looking to do?
---
You can be tanky with a bloodied build, i played it solo without any problems with my standard unyielding set and my b33 fixer.
---
To get tanky with a bloodied build you need: Serendipity+Ricochette, dodgy, blocker, lone wanderer, scaly skin, grounded.
---
I’ve always used this setup for my bloodied commando and I’m thinking about adding suppressor.
---
If youre still having problems add rank 1 of born survivor(works with diluted stims) or use a vampire weapon.
---
Moving a few perks around can take care of that problem...and remember to join (Or create) a casual team (bonus INT=more XP) - almost every team I’ve joined rarely runs together - everyone is doing their own thing, but getting the benefit of the team bonus. 
---
  Add the take one for the team perk (+10% dmg per rank). Add bloody mess if you don’t have it already.  Those two together will likely serve you better in the long run than the bonus from lonewanderer3, especially if the team is sharing good perks.  Lunchboxes.  Team binding + lunchboxes can give you up to 100% bonus XP.  Really nice when running WS or other areas with high value critters (get more than 220XP per kill from the ghouls).
---
  Yes, there is the downside of not being able to meander through the forest unbothered by anything, (can’t fully relax), but that is also offset by being able to gain much better/more XP, even on the “easier“ side of the map  (read : easier to get the 10k XP score bonus when in the west)
---
Order of Mysteries is my fav quest in the game.
---
I agree this is update was intended for more veteran players opposed to the newer lower level players.
---
"Stable flux is not scrap as it is constructed"  slow down there, if you keep bringing that kind of logic bethesda just might make flux a misc item then
---
Biggest complaint is the increase of reloads I need to do between enemies
---
Just responding to OP saying its now impossible for lower levels because he runs out of ammo etc. 
---
I wouldnt use the word harder either, its funner/ more challenging than it was.
---
Whilst i didnt mind being able to just stand still and melt things that couldnt kill me i definitely dont mind having to plan ahead, use the terrain etc again
---
I don't want then to nerf it because it's bugged, because it isn't. I want it nerfed because it's stupid OP, and there's no arguing that it isn't.
---
Bethesda said “this wasnt meant to be a nerf” but it was. Im in a similar boat as you. Because i had a solid foundation of gear and a ton of perk cards ready to burn i was able to setup a very strong build utilizing legendary special cards to add even more damage output.  
---
If this really wasnt meant to be a nerf (which I honestly doubt) then all weapons base damage, or an equivalent like increased % on the base perk cards, needs to be adjusted to make up. Unarmed weapons, single shot rifles, and pistols especially.
---
It does feel slow. I’m at 244 and I got a lot of xp but to level
---
Min maxers broke the game? This is not a single player game. You don't get to be a god. You need good gear and a good build. That's how games work.
---
They improved VATS u/SlackerDao, Why yes, they made it so Sneak attacks in VATS no longer work at all. 
---
It's a "Feature" xD 
---
in all seriousness though, it's destroyed my crit build :/
---
So your build for where you are isn’t too bad.  But a couple of suggestions:
---
* Under Endurance, when you can, switch over to Ironclad (if you aren’t using PA) this will give you a bit extra DR
---
* Try to get your CHA to at least 4, this way you can take Lone Wanderer, this will give you straight up damage reduction and AP refresh.  Damage reduction is much better than DR since it’s a straight cut from damage, rather than any diminishing returns. 
---
* Intelligence you can probably drop down since you don’t need to keep armorer and scrapper equipped all the time. (You can move some of these to CHA)
---
* Agility - you probably want to get rid of Ninja, since that’s only for melee attacks.  
---
* Luck - You are going to want to get Class Freak so you suffer less from mutation effects. 
---
If you can get yourself a Fixer (doesn’t even have to be legendary) that can help too, it has a built in legendary effect even as a non-legendary version, so you can use that to be a bit more sneaky sneaky through areas.  I’d also get some more mutations, shoot I have all the mutations, with class freak the disadvantages aren’t that big an issue.
---
I know the feeling. And I'm very much in the same boat except I made new characters for each build. 😅
---
&gt;It's FUN to feel strong. Games need trash mobs, games need difficulty progression that makes you feel like you are going somewhere for some reason.
---
Nooooo, I want to have the best gear in the game, be a grizzled veteran wasteland survivor, and have to put effort into killing the most trashtastic critters in the wasteland.  Where's the fun in using your big ass weaponry to one shot scrub mobs, everything should be a struggle at the highest levels of awesomeness.  That ghoul should soak bullets like a deathclaw, because level scaling is fun.
---
What does time invested have to do with anything? They are not allowed to fix this game because you spent time on a build that is still the best?(Bloody/Unyielding)  
---
They didn't make your build useless they just balanced things.That is assuming you used the same build as everyone else because there was no balance to the game and everything even with subpar builds was too easy.
---
I’m done... the daily ops were the last straw for me.  It is completely unrealistic... magic creatures that can’t be killed by bullets... it’s ridiculous.  Also, having to play multiple characters to level up legendary perks... it’s absurd that I have to replay over and over the same missions, and now with different characters.  Or my favorite spending hours a day, like it is a job, earning game gold only to have the plans glitch and disappear... then dealing their maddening customer service that is really just focused on wearing down customers until they give up their complaint.  Hey Bethesda, setting up your business to siphon money out of your customers and then not providing good customer service is a great way to go out of business.  #garbage
---
What do you mean? Are they not balanced around everyone’s own level? I’m a commando build but I threw on slugger and incisor, wore PA (never do) threw on medic, so did a my teammate, used a 2* troubleshooter/pa sledge hammer and completely destroyed those resilient fucks, I literally only used 5-6 stims mostly just to heal my teammate. Didn’t expect PA to run so smooth. it’s definitely not too easy, like we get it you’re good at the game/have a nice build but in reality everyone knows it’s more of a challenge and I think it’s pretty perfect. I’m only 112 and I’m enjoying the hell out of this update, you can really tell who was just relying on shitty stacked cards before this haha (not talking abt you obv)
---
I made a run yesterday and came out with 412.  I’m guessing you just got unlucky.
---
What kind of armor are you running ? And you do realize each point in str is a 5%(?) in melee damage so that’s a 25% buff with 1 legendary perk
---
eh. I find hard to believe that basic math eludes them to the point they can't possibly balance the game without nerfing everything to the ground in the process.
---
I mean, multiplication am I right? how the hell does it work?
---
Maybe it was too easy for the higher levels. But as someone who just started a couple days ago the difficulty increase is very noticeable. Any sense of getting stronger is gone and I’m struggling to keep up.
---
Every fight drains me of more and more materials for health, repair and ammo and the only way to get those supplies are to keep pushing through but I’m burning more supplies than I’m earn.
---
Interesting. I did not actually know that! Thanks for the tip! Still I’d recommend running it at 20% now simply because you’re not losing a whole lot of damage now due to the nerfs and also because OP is dying more often now.
---
you summed it up pretty well imo
---
when the changes where announced everyone was happy to see that the meta wasnt as powerfull anymore and people said this will make it so more build diversity will be seen.
---
All it did imo was making optimized builds more necessary than ever before.
---
Elite players can easily adjust to the changes, but casuals and newcomers where really left behind.
---
The fancy pump shotgun you get from pleasant valley claim tickets is always good too, AA limb dmg and 12 round per cartridge
---
Sorry to hear you’re having issues. But you don’t have to be ‘min/maxed’ to do well. 
---
I have a level 12 alt that has no issues. I have a level 47 mule with only one combat perk (Commando 1) and no legendary gear at all and he’s doing fine. 
---
Post your build if you want some advice.
---
And for as many people on the PTS that complained, there were more that did not and actually liked the change. 
---
You can adapt. I have faith in you.
---
No thanks. I use Diluted items
---
Its not you. The update just killed the combat in this game. I just jumped back in after a a year or so. I was level 25 and was enjoying it until they updated it. I just hit 35 before it updated and now I feel useless. I enjoyed not having to constantly worry about the quality of my gear or amount of ammo and health supplies but now that's the game. I'd just recommend waiting for a few patches and seeing if they undo any of this update.
---
No, they aren't.  I'm at 10 or so right now, I'll be at max soon.
---
If they really wanted a social experience, they would've added a chat and guilds/clans. They don't care about social aspect of the game, they just hate that people burn through their content which means they arent around to buy shit in the atomic shop.
---
That's why the game is a bullet sponge fest right now. All mobs are little zombies and for some reason i now i have to put more 6x the amount of lead it would take to fill this suckers brain. It's lazy.
---
Fair enough. Have a good day.
---
I'm a melee build and I had a great time. 
---
I'm sure the Freeze mutation will give me trouble at some point, but I think I'll just adapt over wanting a challenging feature removed.
---
i mean i have a rifleman stealth build and i use two shot lever and hunting, and its just not fun to play, i kill stuff, eventually, but my weapons break after going through west tek the radar array and the golf course. kinda sucks, which is why im in the process of porting my whole build over too heavy power armor build.
---
Power armor for the win.
---
All my stuff up stairs you can't get to it with out the stairs and they always load in last but I know what you mean. I'll just store the displays,
---
regular armor already sucks in comparison when it comes to defenses.
---
You specified leather armor for the troubleshooter set - is it actually better than, say, combat or scout armor for energy resistance? &gt;!I would say something about ballistic Gutsies potentially being a problem by tearing through leather's low ballistic DR but, hey, they do that with any armor anyway.!&lt;
---
Been disabled bc you could stack the buff
---
fair point
---
I stand corrected, thanks for letting me know.
---
Nice!!
---
alright cool.  ill probably grab it because i feel like exploring with a torch haha.  thanks alot for all the info
---
Upvoted to combat the inevitable downvote from those that think you’re lying about your experience.
---
Good on you for being able to adapt!
---
The moment you say bullet sponge is just makes me think you have no idea what your talking about. Only boss like enemies are bullet sponges.
---
Things take more than 2 hits to kill now? Not really an issue for anyone who wasn't using bloodied before the update.
---
Ok, if YOU don’t think it’s an ammo sink with your destiny expertise, please address the constant equipment repair.
---
I’d be perfectly ok with that legendary effect on the robots if there was one less spawn or if they just spawned a little closer to the uplinks. Getting sniped from down the hall by a gutsy... it’s dirty. Doable, and a fun challenge but dirty.
---
I feel like the robots had the dumbest mutation ever, it made it so hard to do the op for people who use gun, aka 95% of the games players
---
Using the correct turrets should make a difference to as I remember during a previous patch they made they're damage scale with your cards.
---
Heavy turrets = heavy gunner
---
Shotguns = shotguns 
---
Missile launcher = demo expert
---
Etc.
---
It should still work like that unless they nerfed them somewhere which I don't see happening considering if you dont have a spot that prevents it the enemies will just stand outside the build circle and shoot. Too bad they didn't buff camps since everything else has been
---
Eh. Sniper was good, now heavy gunner is.  Big deal.  All I'm saying is that I'm happy they're buffing my playstyle
---
Does anyone know if I store my displays don the items I store with them or so I have to display ever thing.
---
While i haven’t had much trouble With the new normal, it does seem to make leveling pointless in that if all enemies scale to you then you’re never really getting better or making the game easier (arguably the point of upgrading/leveling.)
---
Kinda... Yes...
---
OK, I like One Wasteland. After charging through the Capitol building, getting the 'level up' score, it dawned on me I can now hunt anywhere to level up. That's frickin' awesome!
---
But, I do think basic insects, mole rats and wolves could have been capped lower than 50. Especially in the forest.
---
This is a survival game (of sorts). Survival shouldn't be as easy it was, I guess. But if you wanted a more chilled playing session, you could bumble around the forest, Grafton and the Ash Heap without being alert at all times. 
---
I really enjoyed the forest events before 22 because they were a nice, slow, casual bumble. Now, it feels like I'm always on, and the games always intense. Holy heck, Tea Time was stressful last night, haha! 
---
I'm sure they'll balance things out a bit as time goes on. I know Beth have a reputation, but they've done so good this year. I'm hoping they tone things back, just a bit!
---
I got the War Glaive plan on my 2nd run with a group today.. Yesterday it was a plan for some wall signs
---
SS helmet is one of the best in game. No perception loss, air and water protection and bright headlamp
---
Ammo is so easy to produce. I can kill a gutsy fairly quick, it does not take a whole fusion core to kill lmao. You are either being super overdramatic or your weapon is just awful or something because there is no way in hell. I have done awol armaments and the daily op, both swarming with gutsies and neither were too difficult to complete or took all my ammo. Optimize your build, get a less shit gun, or stop being overdramatic.
---
Well, for instance, the moment you need to switch to a Hazmat suit in order to go into a nuke zone, you're screwed since you can't equip the broken armor pieces again until you fix them and break them again. Every. Single. Time.
---
Only in power armor though.
---
depends on who you talk to. My game hasn't been buggy or laggy ever. And if you turn on Pacifist and stay out of Workshops, then other players cannot hurt you.
---
Quite the contrary. Unless you're bloodied, melee is now useless.
---
Wait, why every time in eventi there Is someone wirh an explosive shotgun killing everything ?
---
What freaking weapon are you using dude? I took my low health off, went full health, grabbed a non legendary assault rifle, not even a friggin handmade, to make myself completely vanilla aside from typical weapon perk cards and I was still killing max lvl super mutants with, idk I’d say about 8-12 rounds depending how many headshots I landed. What about that is bullet sponge? These are genetically mutated super soldiers we’re talking about here. All you guys that aren’t happy with the new patch are kind of blowing this shit out of proportion, like it’s not that bad dude. Some of these comments I feel like people are just making it up because they’re salty about not one shotting everything now.
---
Thanks man
---
This hits home to me as a 100 level.  Much of my build is focused on experince, not combat. A lot of perks/armor for weight/hording management.  I did some food build.too, so I could try to stay alive in battle.  Have not tried the queen, but everything is taking more and I was not looking for that.
---
I guess they decided a new end game task to occupy the super soldiers was not feasible?
---
Is there an optimizer faq you would suggest?  I roll tse or furious exploaive rifles when I can.  Do have rifle perks.
---
You can enable Pacifist to not worry about 99% of PvP.
---
Games still buggy and laggy but it definitely improved a ton after the last few patches.
---
If this was last night at Monongah and you're on xbox, I think I saw you lol
---
I got the suit and helmet as a reward for completing one daily ops with the elder rank
---
YOU DON’T HAVE TO BE OPTIMIZED TO DO WELL
---
None of my character are optimized, my builds are fun, I’m doing fine.
---
Or maybe the game has become nearly impossible to play for people who have invested time and money into the game.
---
Well to be fair when their are only like 2 viable builds in the game and everything else is utter garbage, then they need to rebalance things before they nerf everything into the ground. From what I've heard them say is that this damage nerf will help them balance things in the future but they should have balance it before they release the nerf. Also need to fix things that have been broken for years first such as melee hits not registering, vats broken, sneak broken etc.
---
Take one for the team will help compensate for your lost damage.
---
Improved. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise, they're just babies. There's some bugs, yes, but not near as much. Power armor bug was fixed, cause it used to be the worst for me and now it never happens.
---
As far as I know.. I haven't ran a silo to test that one out yet myself, but that was the case on Angryturtle's PTS test of the perk. I am also curious if Assaultron face laser effect it as well.
---
it is. and it probably always will be. not as buggy mind you, but still infuriatingly so.
---
pvp is all but nonexistent. just enable pacifist in your settings once you reach level 5 don't take over workshops and you'll never have to fight anyone.
---
Same with xbox. It works consistently on regular framerate but on bosses an intense areas it gets a bit iffy
---
I’d rather stimpack than die and lose out on time during the daily ops.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/itdy9y/psa_for_those_that_dont_know_about_electric/g5dr0j8/
---
From Valseek confirming this is intended behavior.
---
Enemies with marine or power armor don’t die in one shot from my experience. I use the shotgun damage perk, skeet shooter, and demolition expert along with the explosive bobblehead. I don’t charge the gauss shotgun, however, unless enemies are far away and I’m trying to snipe. Are you assuming a charged gauss shotgun? I’ve never actually paused during a game to examine weapon stats; I’m always moving.
---
I’ve been gun downed almost instantly in power armor while under med-x from a handmade. I’ve seen someone kill 5 people with one clip in about 2 seconds. Are you taking into account bobblehead and chems? The handmade is OP for commando builds.
---
Thanks! I can see why some people wouldn’t enjoy it - I’m only level 85, but I can still feel the change. It’s not for everyone, I know I really liked the feeling of being able to go into most places and one shot all the enemies. But this actually makes it challenging (a perk for me), and better loot is always nice.
---
The only reason I care about hacking is the Challenge for the atoms. This L-Perk makes it so much more easier to do it. Lockpicking I don't mind, but Hacking has been a chore since FO3.
---
I’m so glad to see positive posts about this! I think the update is great! I’ve been excited about for awhile and it didn’t disappoint me :)
---
In daily Ops, with robots, I burned through my usual 10-20 stimpacks in no time. So die and respawn was a bit easier, haha.
---
Its op! Ok let's just nerf it to the ground...
---
Its a legendary perk just roll with it should be a solid perk
---
Unless your level 40 lol
---
Why am I still getting the resilient robots? I keep seeing posts about today’s ops and I’ve done three runs so far (after daily update) and still getting the robots.
---
That's awesome. Do you have a link? Wish they'd add it to the description. I want to upgrade the card, but not if there's even a chance they will nerf it.
---
Eh.  You don't really need to lock pick or hack anything.
---
I think the Season challenges are literally making them do the Ops if they want the rewards. However, the beauty of daily ops is that everything is changing so the challenge will be slightly different. However if you just don't like the structure of daily ops at all, just avoid it like I do NW.
---
Chemist and Super Duper go a long way together, in my experience. Pharma Farma doesn't really give as many stimpaks as one might hope - mostly Radaway or chems.
---
No Electric Absorption, new legendary perk
---
I only had to leave this up for 2 minutes before someone inevitably throws out the "post your build" crap. My build was absolutely fine before one wasteland.maxed rifleman with maxed tank killer full sneak dam and whatever the perk is that does more sneak damage at night.
---
why do I have to repeat this? Im not a broken record. I dont want to play bloody, but after OW thats the only viable build.
---
Electric absorption, new legendary perk
---
Just FYI, I don’t think ‘Resilient’ is exclusive to Robots.
---
Just you I still haven’t encountered anything outrageously annoying where I’ll just give up mid fight. 
---
Everything still feels the same gameplay wise except it takes two shot gun shells instead of one to kill the raiders outside my camp since they have scaled in level.
---
Same here. Love the game but it has become a second job. I play games for fun and not to do chores on a daily basis. But that's just me
---
don't think it's possible any longer. your best bet is do events or grind densely populated areas.
---
That was my method with a rifle.  I also learned sometimes you just need to run to the next area and not worry about clearing.
---
Instead of a nerf across the whole they should have balanced the legendary effects. I don't like bloodied or junkies. I like my PA Anti Armor build. It's no max  damage for melting the SQB or Earl. But it was still fun and powerful to take on anything.
---
I used to kill a level 60 glowing ghoul with a quick 2-3 sec burst with my Anti Armor Plasma Gat. Now it takes a short 6-8 sec burst on the same enemy type and level. Effectively increasing ammo usage almost 3x more. So If I farm mats to make more I'll head into the negative and eventually have nothing to use. It sucks cause I don't even have much time to play. And ammo upkeep is costly, even with the ammo crafting perks.
---
Yes, they are. 1 point lets you use a 1 star card *sometimes*. Requiring a significant (read: literally all spare cards at 150ish) to level up to max. Which then removes your ability to "respec". 
---
Even then, it'd be quite a bit more worth the while if it added to a special above 15, which it doesn't.
---
Yes, but you can't take all of them.  If you take all the mediocre ones, you leave no room for the good ones.
---
I'll never understand defending horrible game design choices just becsuse they CAN be worked around. Resiliant is awful, its not fun and should have never existed.
---
How about: enemies take half or quarter dmg from ballistic/energy/melee. How about enemies have double DR/ER. There are countless better choices than "lol ur not melee? Get fukt kid"
---
Yeah, five pieces of Sentinel plus Serendipity and double AP for longer Dodgy use, plus insane AP regen and coreless VATS and Jetpack are really shit /s
---
As a stealth commando build, I can deal with stealth being disabled and vats only working half the time. But being forced to use melee to kill things when it doesn't work half the time is bogus. Today's with the resilient modifier was loads better than yesterday.
---
that sucks, man.
---
I made the same mistake.  Sigh.  What a joke.
---
They patch the game every 1-2 months though......
---
Can you stomach this for a month?
---
Stop scaring me!  I'm gonna cry if you don't stop!
---
;)
---
Wait, do you get more exp from higher level mobs? I noticed it's the same
---
Is this a new weapon ? How does it compare to the power fist ?
---
What a bitch, why won't they fix it? Oh well, will have to get into the habit of short bursts and keep holstering 😒
---
Thanks for info!
---
Also, is this before One Wasteland? I’m assuming the damage change also applies to NW, so maybe chems and bobbleheads aren’t as good as they were before.
---
I got home from work at 3:30pm yesterday and started the download which didn't finish until 9:30pm.  I had about 30 minutes to delete a hundred perk cards and work on my legendary cards.  Today I will get to see what all the bitching and whining is about.   kingsites12 look for me after 5pm - GT:  Send Me 4 I Am
---
As long as bethesda doesn't address the root of the problem it will never be fully fixed because it is too complicated to fix on the way it is set up now. It isn't a matter of code, it's a matter of things like player connection to the server and lag. For the easiest and laziest fix they would have to somehow deactivate the vending machines and stash boxes for a few moments whenever you or someone loads into any camp so that the camp and all the assets load properly and even then i doubt it would 100% fix this.
---
The way vending machines work is that they pull out items you marked for sale directly from your stash therefore whenever a problem occour some unintended items might end up for sale there or worse when it gives other people access to your full stash. The only way to properly fix this would be to make the vending machines a completely independent container where you have to manually take items from ur stash and put them there so that it doesn't have access to anything that isnt already there. This isn't rocket science but Bethesda seems to like wasting resources creating many small improvised fixes for the same thing under the false presumption that minimal work is efficient  instead of addressing problems directly since it is a bit more complicated but highly effective.
---
Agree, I did Tea Time solo and went through 500 rounds what usually took 50.  All for 2 Treasury notes!  This is forcing solo players to either leave or team up which defeats the solo part.
---
I got infinite stims(super, diluted and normal) i refuse to die all the time
---
In fallout 4 you could stomp them. It was an animated movement, like a distant headshot.
---
I’ll do that when I get home. I don’t doubt I probably have a bad build as I went with quite a few QOL perks and only a few damage ones.
---
was excited for harder enemies... until you got them.
---
ReCoiL is Just HumAn coRRecTiOn

---
&gt;This isn’t Fallout 5 single player. It’s clear Bethesda is trying to up the difficulty for team fights. Which is probably why players are able to tag along with higher leveled player now.
---
I bought the game last week solely because I read that they added a more comprehensive single-player "campaign story" mode type of update a while back.  Despite loving the franchise and the atmosphere of other Fallout games, I had avoided FO76 like the plague because I don't do MMOs, PVP, and am not a very outgoing or social person.  "Asking a high level player for help" just isn't something I'm going to do.  While Bethesda certainly didn't intend it, it sure feels to me like I fell for a bait and switch.  I bought it SOLELY for the single player elements which, from my reading on the subject, was robust enough for me despite that not being the purpose of the game.  I was very pleased and impressed that I'd be able to play a campaign on the newest iteration of the Fallout universe.  Evidently, that was not to be.  Up until yesterday morning, I was having an absolute blast playing this game, despite not yet fully understanding all the "build" nonsense.  I was having fun playing it the way I wanted to: By myself, using the weapons I wanted or had.  After yesterday's patch, it feels like I'm playing an entirely different game.  I certainly didn't feel "powerful" before, but I also didn't feel completely impotent.  It was challenging, but not frustratingly so.  Now?  I have enough frustration in my daily life.
---
Thanks! That’s good to know!
---
Completed it multiple times but it’s not a “fun” event. Seems like something I’ll only do until I learn all the plans and won’t do again. At least the robot one. Still holding judgment on the other variants
---
Yes, but I also stood there for nearly 30 seconds in my perk screen tanking their attacks.
---
Yes they nerfed xp. You get way less even though the enemies are higher level now. No mention of it at all. They even said we would be getting more because the enemies scale higher now.
---
My first was this as well, much easier, breezed through elder as a duo, then did the robot one and needed 4 people, vampire guns and still a lot of stims to complete. Had one guy running pure melee while we whittled them down. It definitely was an interesting dynamic.
---
I just completed a daily op that had exploding blood eagles and it was way more fun than the robots with the melee mutation.
---
Finished on elder with a two player team. Got the Brotherhood special ops mask and the suit as a reward.
---
A capette?
---
Agreed. By the end it was tedious and I'm surprised I finished as I took a break toward the end. Just burned me out with the same dailies over and over
---
I'm pretty sure that most people who spout that line never actually tried a bloodied build.
---
https://streamable.com/svtgyn
---
Oh wow. Finally. That’s a beautiful thing
---
That's awesome, definitely going to upgrade it eventually then.
---
There are unique rewards and plenty of resources.  I leave with more ammo than I started with every time
---
The legendary perk for energy absorb has made me a god against the stupid robots!  It’s so nice to be OP once more
---
I understand where you’re coming from, I agree
---
No it’s not nocturnal is just as strong as bloodied and junkies at this point. 
---
You’re complaining of spending 50 rounds on a radroach yet your builds fine?
---
He only asked you to post your build so he could help you and give you pointers so you could adapt it to fit your style more. Don’t be a dick when someone’s being helpful
---
Yep, I don't mind the level 50s in Flatwoods but having nerfed my melee weapon really takes the fun out of it.  It was 320 damange and now 260 and I don't play bloodied.  I hope they change some damage back to the way it was for non-bloodied builds.
---
Yeah that level 1 sword mission was semi annoying before, probably impossible now.
---
The detection of weapon used is super laggy after the kill though, i think you can use another weapon then switch to the sword quickly after death and it will count.
---
Hi. Non-bloodied heavy gun boi here. My build is viable.
---
VFFR Tri-barrell Tesla Capacitor Gauss Minigun with all heavy gun perks, Stabilized, Demolition Expert, Bloody Mess, and One Gun Army. 
---
Not even counting any buffs from chems...1312 damage per second. 
---
Imagine what it would do against a Queen with the Prime mod. Or if I used Glow Sight at Whitespring.
---
But... why don’t you share your build? Maybe there are some things you can tweak that don’t dramatically alter your play style.
---
Brotherhood related.
---
Meat week is coming back around Tuesday. That’s my plan for my new toon.
---
Destiny sucks I’m definitely not an expert I stopped playing because how bad the ammo sink is. Guns break dude idk what to tell you, it’s minuscule resources and there’s perks to make repairing cheaper, repair kits, collectrons that collects weapon repairing resources etc. it’s not that bad bro you guys need to stop blowing this out of proportion
---
Because in 76 all boots are made out of gingers.
---
Im just here to agree, in general these changes were overboard. I feel like they need to buff some things now to make them fun again. I used to love using my bloodied knuckles but its not even worth it now.
---
Do they use explosives, or explode when they die or something?
---
I wonder how well it works vs ISS
---
(PC) Whenever I use a bench it sometimes pauses and when I exit I'll be stuck for a few seconds before being given back player control. Unsure if you can still take damage during this animation but I don't wanna find out. Just hope it gets fixed.
---
You're being fairly hostile, and need to calm down realistically. If you dont enjoy the update, do the real world thing and stop playing, and also stop crying about it.
---
maybe I just love trains
---
Resilient was not that bad, you're all being so dramatic lol
---
I have never played other FO games, so in earlier FO games enemies are a lot weaker?
---
Perhaps not, I thought they did but I could be wrong.
---
I'm 200+ level wise and honestly didn't feel a big difference  from the change. Biggest difference I saw was that my two shot auto-grenade launcher somehow became even more deadly. 
---
I think One Wasteland was a good idea. That said, based off of what I've heard and read the real issue is that they didn't do a proper re-balance of the various builds to make sure they were all still viable. Hopefully they start buffing some things sooner than later for all of you.
---
Exactly I play with 80% quality of life perks just to carry loads of stuff on me all the time and the command cards to buff my nocturnal Tesla rifle I’m in no way optimised and I can still play fine
---
Still works for me.
---
I have a BSS Bowie knife that is pretty good for this. I was using it in today's daily op because it was working better than gun bashing on my commando build for all but the final boss. Took some hits on each enemy (like 5) but it worked.
---
The mobs around my camp in the forest get one-hit by it though.
---
I think I'm going to do a melee perk loadout just for that daily op though, because right now I have no melee perks at all, just UNY armor, 8 base STR, and radicool.
---
They should add a perk that speeds up gun bashing though, or a weapon mod.
---
Bravo!
---
Still the best build, it will just be harder to survive certain events like radiation rumble now that ghouls are doing more rad damage to you.
---
I use a vampire weapon, you dont need to kill anything before the final boss fight so I just used my vamp weapon to tick away health. Vamp weapons are way more viable now than before, get one with explosive and you'll never die. I found myself with 70 stimpacks and started the day with 10.
---
I never die. PA Electric Absorbtion forever. Alot of enemies use energy and haven't done one op where I couldn't just chill in one spot and complete solo under 8 minutes easily.
---
not for me. It was 94/melee kill/robots
---
Poor guy just trying to supply mama mumbles
---
This update is really highlighting the problems of potato builds. The game was braindead easy before.
---
So I guess it's close to 14:52 E.T, I still see no change.
---
I'm right there with you but I'd rather have faith and be optimistic than not. Otherwise I'm funneling time into a game I have a vendetta against and that just seems silly to me.
---
I have the perks maxed out and I’m constantly having to find benches to repair everything.  It’s not being ridiculous or blowing anything out of proportion, just stating a fact “bro”
---
Simple.  With additive stacking, if you introduce a 10% damage buff, your damage goes up 10% of your base.  
---
With multiplicative stacking, your damage goes up 10% of your base, plus 10% of your gear, plus 10% of your perks, plus 10% of your food, plus 10% of whatever else you happen to have going on at the time.  For one person, that's a 10% increase in their base, but for someone else it may be 15% or 25% or 100% or more of their base.
---
So if you want to gently nudge, say Berserker's builds, to make them more competitive, it will boost the damage a completely different amount for each player if you're using multiplicative math.  With additive math, 10% is the same 10% for everyone at a given base damage.
---
Yea same way i mean ops will destroy ur supply
---
If you need any help buffing out your build, I’m happy to help, if you’d like.
---
Still keeping my Junkies Weightless Cultist Dagger for fireflies at the lighthouse lol. Although the radtoads may be a bit more difficult now!
---
bloodied still has the highest damage output out of any build, rightfully so. so if you change to, say, junkie's, your dps is gonna suffer even more.
---
having said that, the difference between bloodied and junkie's is also a lot less noticeable now. so the trade off may not be worth it any longer. depends on you, really.
---
riflemen got hit pretty bad though, so if you're not commando, may want to consider trying an automatic handmade first.
---
Can confirm just got it from the daily ops today.
---
Some friendly advice. 
---
Add some paragraph breaks its hard to read a block of text.
---
Quite the contrary. Junkies and bloodied damage gap is closer than ever. Instigating now does significantly more damage than bloodied on a full health power hit. Vampires is situationally useful for missions where low-health bloodied melee builds aren’t viable like daily ops. You have a workout bench at your base that gives you +4 melee damage every time you use it (unless your strength is below 15 in which case it will give you more) stacking up to 30 times. Melee builds who had low intelligence to maximize damage and health can now skill legendary intelligence to use level 5 makeshift warrior which is a huge quality of life buff. not to mention I’m literally hitting people till they explode and cleaving waves of enemies in VATS. Yesterday all my instigating and vampire melee weapons that had been sitting in my shop all patch 21 sold in one evening and threw me way over my caps limit I’m actually kind of salty at how good other legendarios are now.
---
I'm still working on making a build so I dont have any outstanding perks with guns or melee. I started with 30 stims in daily ops, used them all and died about 20 more times while doing solo. It literally took me 45 minutes to do the daily ops quest solo 🤧
---
Adios, enjoy playing something else until it gets an update adding challenge and you quit
---
If the chainsaw can be dropped for legnedaries, im changing builds. Period
---
It’s still the same daily op. They just manually changed it because they didn’t wanna do resilient robots 2 days in a row. Don’t worry. It should reset again tomorrow at noon.
---
&gt;Now, I’ve never been the guy who drugs/food stacks/sneak crits the queen in 1 hit
---
I think a problem is people who watch these videos of a bloodied build go solo the Queen or Earl and pop like 10 meds, bobbleheads, magazines, food and other bullshit to stack their damage up to kill them in 10 seconds and they think that bloodied needs a nerf because its too op. Obviously its one of the best builds in the game right now but nobody puts that much effort and preparations in constantly fighting mobs. I think Bethsedas problem is they need to fix things that have been broken for years such as vats not working, melee hits not registering, sneak being broken and perk cards not working instead of a damage nerf across the board which made all but like 2 builds nonviable.
---
Where am I supposed to store an extra 60-100lb set of armor and weapons for different enemy types? My stash is gonna be a lot smaller now that I also have to start really stockpiling meds/chems, ammo, and basic scrap such as steel and lead.
---
I don't know what type of game Bethesda is trying to make here, but all these different mechanics just, don't work well together. You can't drastically increase the rate people use up ammo and repair weapons + armor without also increasing the amount of scrap people can store/get.
---
While yea, before the patch, I would have to throw out extra scrap and ammo a lot, now it's a complete decline to the point where I literally, **literally** have no weapon/armor-related scrap left.
---
And trust me, I've played most the borderlands at higher difficulties. It was *not* this bullet-spongey. And the starting areas still had consistently low-level enemies
---
Same problem, I just closed the game. I’m not enjoying the new game.
---
There is, the armco ammo plant you get from max rep with raiders. It generates free ammo and it can be placed in your camp
---
Why did they change from multiplicative to additive if the intent was not to nerf.  Is there any other possible outcome?
---
Do you have this copy and pasted 😂 nothing wrong with it I support it
---
This does not work for me or my buddy on ps4
---
This is no longer true - all cards are worth 2 points now.
---
Tse minigun is a monster
---
I'm not frustrated about not being able to 1shot most things anymore. I'm talking the reduction in damage for a SNIPER RIFLE modded for max damage, range, accuracy, etc. on a 3 Star Two Shot that now does 90 damage WITH perks.  
---
Headshots do more damage in most. Armored is a huge deviancy even if it only has one piece of armor and  you're hitting unarmored body parts.  
---
I haven't played today but I'm dropping the shotgun I had as a back up as well as the melee. I'll take a look at what I have and maybe bounce awround to player vendors and see if I can get lucky.
---
nobody knows
---
Short answer: 100% up to you.
---
Long answer: As a former bloodied guy (shifted last year - not after OW), I know that Bloodied isn’t just a build. It’s something you have to work at and manage. It’s not for casual folks. So if you still want it, you’re gonna have to figure out if figuring out how to buff your survivability is worth it to you.
---
If you do, I have 100% confidence in you.
---
not saying you're wrong but there are several ways to work around that without breaking every build in the process. a simple 'not stackable' flag comes to mind.
---
I have the same problem I leveled so the game wasn't a absolutely breeze, and until they fix it I've had to change my perks over to use some auto weapons till then. I honestly hate it I just wanna do my rife stuff, and not be like every other explosive auto build.
---
&gt;You're being fairly hostile
---
Please understand, any time someone brings up the major problems with OW people spam "post your build" like somehow the issue is with the perk cards I have equipped. Thats not the issue.
---
Really glad we were able to get this one in for you guys!
---
Level 100 radroaches are easy to kill.
---
Dude right?? This mentality is wild.
---
Yeah, but if you have the shotgun, you can one shot them.
---
Most people run at just enough for nerd rage to kick in. The extra damage from bloodied is usually not worth the loss of those hp.
---
Right, just badly nerfed.
---
Wow bud, great feedback smh.
---
Stealth doesn't work in the current Daily Op, so I'm giving a tip for how to adjust. You're welcome.
---
My concern is mainly characters below level 20. Who should be a higher priority anyway if they want new/more players.
---
Do you know if there is a timer after you kill the boss when it kicks you out or does it only kick you out after you view the after action report? Wondering if I have time to go back and loot everything
---
Alright, will do.
---
I completed the first and second ops solo with robots and blood eagles. Blood eagles only took me 2 tries because I am unfamiliar with vault 94. People still be sleeping on the fact that electric absorbtion nullifies basically any energy damage by healing you and filling your cores. I basically just stand by the uplink and do nothing the whole time besides the end boss part.

---
 &gt; Really glad we were able to get this one in for you guys!
---
I'm still pissed that we have to pay in the first place. This hasn't been a thing in any of the other games so why add it?
---
Sounds like your girlfriend should be playing animal crossing instead. 
---
Not fallout's target audience you just roped her into it.
---
Same. I maxed it out just to see mobs go fying
---
Enemies should be hard to kill. Otherwise what’s the point of having them around. If people can’t kill a mob that scales with them then maybe they need to adjust their build. This is a survival game after all.
---
I went to a silo to recharge my cores, but no proc and I almost died standing in crossfire lol, but robots’ lasers do work. The assaultron-ish boss in daily ops couldn’t melt me with its head laser so I guess it worked too.
---
Most diseases I just ignore.  A few, like dysentery and parasites, I either eat a cure immediately or get to Whitespring ASAP.
---
I still stim when I can, but death comes so fast now, even with crazy legendary resistances, that I often miss my opportunity and wind up eating dirt.
---
I’m a rifleman man sadly. I loved the build and it worked very well for me and it helped me ammo wise. I may have to do like you’re saying though and go to a Commando Build. I just don’t have a lot of junk or materials to constantly make ammo, especially Ultracite ammo. Thanks for the info as well!
---
U know shit is fucked up when it’s tough to even kill the god damn wolves lol 🤦🏻🤦🏻
---
Why are you trying to do it solo? They even said that they were designed for two people minimum
---
To be honest I feel the patch was just lazy. They could have made a new high level map or a hardcore mode. This is why I feel like they're just trying to weed players out and abandon the game. 
---
We had survival mode before so it definitely could have been done by tweaking that and rolling it back out it really wouldn't have been that much of an issue for them.
---
I haven’t done that event yet after the patch, but I imagine it’ll be rough lol.
---
Fair point, like i said overall its a really good system, it just needs fine tuning, like the scaling could ramp up as you level or just tone down the hp of lower level mobs.
---
Don't make a new character.  Sub 50 is a nightmare now.
---
Hitting level 68s in zones a bit east isn't so bad compared to a level 25 radroach taking 8-10 shotgun blasts to the face.
---
Ammo economy is shot unless you grind ammo all the time and perk up to make it, 2 things you cannot do at lower levels.
---
Bethesda literally slammed the door in new players faces.
---
But hey, you like it so why does it matter if this game stops selling.
---
Robots were hell because of the Colonel Gutsy's insane armor penetration or whatever the hell they have that makes them chunk your armor each shot.
---
I love it too. I've only been playing for about two months but feel like I must've really optimized my build as the regular enemies still seem pretty squishy even without a junkies or bloodied build.
---
I was doing the chow line and lucky mucker and still managed to one shot the level 50 radroaches roaming the park
---
Yeah but's annoying to VATS something ... then have to exit VATS as you can't bash in VATS, etc.
---
Mechanically that is un-fun. Doable, but un-fun.
---
Get plaguewalker and then you’ll be happy every time you contract one
---
You start with one type of enemy and eventually get better gear so you can tackle more than one enemy type.
---
Sounds like Beth nerfed the wrong part of the game
---
May I ask what your build is? I'm trying to find something that works. I could take down the robots in about 8 melee strikes and a death in between in Daily Ops but I'm working on a build that has high damage. I have a stealth melee build that I'm working on, but now I feel as if its pointless
---
I was using a Quad 10mm pistol with powerful auto receiver and quick mags to clear WS clubhouse today... worked great. I was hitting for 175 per shot using no pistol damage perks, just rank 3 of the armor penetration card. 3 round burst and they're down.
---
I still didn't do my legendary perks either, so it will be even better after that.
---
The last score thing i did from the start and ended up completing it a few weeks early without spending any atoms. Now there is even more weekly quests and reward than last season it will go by even faster.
---
Something I've done when stuck-in-a-rut CAMP-wise is to just pick a random point on the map and explore. Find somewhere with an interesting feature (waterfall, cave, vehicle pileup, etc), or a great view. You can probably get by without extractors, so find some off-the-beaten-path location that has something fun, then try to build around that.
---
Find a waterfall? Make a CAMP that is built on both sides of it and uses it like a water feature.Find a gorgeous view somewhere? Have 2 floors where you just use the little wooden fence with a wide-open side facing the Forest.Enjoy explosions? Find a high point facing Monongah and set up some chairs on the roof.Feeling sneaky? Try to build a "normal" building that has a secret staircase/door to some really weird design.Uninspired? Find some existing buildings and try to build something that fits in with the aesthetic. (Mr Messenger events usually end at one of these locations and can really help)
---
Or if you are feeling imaginative, try some themes. Make a 4x4 stack, and each floor is a new theme (Fasnacht-&gt;Meat Week-&gt;Halloween-&gt;Christmas; spring-&gt;summer-&gt;fall-&gt;winter; stoneage-&gt;bronzeage-&gt;modern-&gt;future; etc). There are lots of possibilities, but if the creative juice isn't flowing, you can try the r/fallout76settlements reddit as suggested above, or just keep wandering the Wasteland until something piques your interest. You never know what you might find out there, especially if you avoid the common locations (train stations, Whitesprings, Wayward, resource deposits)
---
Havent been able to do it yet, but I have the card maxed out and will let you know if I get the chance. But i'm hoping pretty good as any other Assaultron is basically just a medic beam.
---
Im a stealth Marksman, never used bloodied. I use to kill supes in 1-2 hit "Vats Headshot", now its 5 headshots. Completely stupid. If i go for the body its above 8-9. If i want to kill a molerats, i have to spend my entire VATS to maybe kill it. Any game where you cant kill a normal mob with a headshot from one of the most powerful single shot weapon is bullet sponge. Thank god for people with cheated weapons. They bring balance back into the game.
---
Thank you! Yeah, I’ve put too much time and work into it to just quit. I’ll keep at it! I might need to re-evaluate my perk cards a bit, but with only 5 levels free to toy with, that may be hard. Might have to grind again and level.
---
No, it’s not. 
---
- My 250+ main is neither Bloodied nor Junkies.  He has had to make only minor adaptations, and that’s just in the approach to combat, not the build. 
---
- My level 47 mule has only one combat perk (Commando 1) and the rest are QoL.  He has no legendary gear at all. No changes have had to be made yet for him. He’s doing just fine. Also not Bloodied or Junkies. 
---
- My new level 12 alt is progressing very quickly.  More quickly in fact than my previous characters because I’m not running into level 1 scrub enemies anymore. Oh, and guess what?  This one isn’t Bloodied or Junkies either. And doesn’t have any legendary gear yet as well. 
---
That’s a variety of styles.  And none of them are Bloodied or Junkies. Only one has legendary gear. And only one has had to make minor changes in playstyle, with absolutely zero changes in build. Actually, my apologies, there were some changes. I added the Ammo legendary perk and maxed it out and then added the legendary Intelligence, Agility and Luck, all at just level one. And that let me add the game-breaking extra perk cards of Scrapper, Light Footed and Dry Nurse.
---
You make a good point. The gutsies do hit the hardest, and they're ballistic.I actually use a mix of scout and heavy leather, which I feel gives me a great balance between the 2. 
---
Leather is good against the protectrons and robobrains, as well as the boss assaultrons laser.
---
In all honesty, even just having a 1* troubleshooter set of any type is gonna help immensely in this challenge. Throw in 1-2 that have sentinel...it's seriously a cakewalk. I was shocked at how well my *stealth* build was functioning as a straight tank.
---
*For context purposes, I have been playing since Beta and use a level 433 character with a mix of Vanguard, Unyielding, and Sentinel for a high health/resistance build. My weapon of choice is an AAE laser rifle with ultracite rounds and the specialized perks for automatic rifles.*
---
With all that said, I absolutely love Patch 22. The legendary perks, the balance changes to the enemies, daily ops, everything. I love the season objectives, so it's a really good time for me on FO76.
---
My first time playing yesterday under the new patch was a SBQ. The engagement itself took 12 minutes with a dozen or so wastelanders fighting the good fight. I didn't really feel the difference to much, even when the adds engaged.
---
I was thrilled to run into enemies ranging from 50-100 at Westek this morning. After implementing three legendary perks (Follow Through 4, Perception 1, Luck 1), I discovered that most kills took three well placed rounds. Some took more than others, of course, especially when there was a group of them.
---
My sneak and evasion are high, and my entire run was more than manageable, so I do not understand your feelings toward a spike in difficulty. Perhaps you could expound on it and offer details on your build, etc..
---
Are we playing a different game? I played for like 6 hours straight yesterday and only repaired my weapons several times. I went around killing everything I saw to get a feel for how the new damage calculation is working out and how the enemies lvl scale. I was very surprised with how much smoother the balancing feels. As far as repairing though I didn’t notice much difference. And why do you have to mock me? You’re making yourself look immature and toxic for literally no reason we’re just talking about a game here.
---
Just dont get too eager with your scrapping of them and scrap your weapon artisan perk and have to spend 3 levels getting it back. Like I.... my friend did.
---
To be fair,I brought you toilet papers during spring but I guess holding a gun is essential too.
---
Yep - diseases can be a bit annoying (maybe more so with the latest update where a lot of us might be taking more hits and catching them more frequently), but I normally have a decent amount of disease cures on hand to use for the more harmful ones.
---
What would 76ers do if there wasnt a reddit to bitch and complain on all day?
---
I haven't tried the new update yet, but honestly it sounds awful.  I'm so tired of them taking the game into territories I don't like, and giving far too little of the story-driven stuff that I do want.
---
I've already cancelled Fallout 1st.  I'm thinking I'll just shelve the game until they add mod support.
---
Yeah I think that's a good way to word it. I think it's some of that mixed with some people still really fighting for this to be a solo game and I think if Bethesda tries to please both it's going to tear the game apart. Imagine if Wow balanced raids or dungeons so they were soloable, ya know?
---
I am back at work, but I can send you a PM later tonight when I log back on and let you know if you'd like.  Thank you.
---
Damn straight! “I swear I didn’t dupe, some guy came along and dropped all those weapons”. Something along those lines.
---
Boop
---
What do these modules do ?
---
It was never mentioned. The slots are shared between all characters. If you have 1 char at level 300(all 6 slots) then every char has all 6 slots unlocked
---
Ah yes infinitely respawning enemies from all sides that can phase right through any doors so any sense of strategy or tactics are gone and give a middle finger to anyone that dared spec into stealth are super fun.
---
Ive always believed junkies was better even before the patch.  Now it's even more relevant to bring up.  
---
Junkies builds do almost the same, if not more dmg, all while retaining a full hp bar and having the ability to use chems and food to boost DR and dmg output.  
---
I have been having great fun with the new patch and only scratched the surface of legendary perks.  Ive only maxed ammo factory and intend to max legendary endurance next.  Once I finish up with that I'll be moving into intelligence for 3 points just to get demo expert to finally see the max potential for my JE LMG.   Only downside I've noticed about junkies is the rarity of drops, but once you get 2 or 3 that work well for you, it's fantastic.  
---
I'm sure there are plenty of viable builds to come in the future, but for now,  junkies seems to be the most OP.  This is just my opinion and I'm sure plenty of people will disagree or offer valid counter arguments.
---
Daily Ops are basically run.
---
They shall spontaneously combust upon death.
---
Well, idk what to say. Clearly you feel you got robbed.
---
I just cashed in 157 baked perk cards, and was happy I got 314 coins. I also scrapped like 200 worth yesterday. 
---
I'm not sure on your math, but file a ticket I guess. 
---
Or, be happy that legendary perks are out. 
---
Idk man/woman.
---
Good work! If you need someone to bounce anything off of to try to figure something out, feel free to hit me up any time. Running numbers is fun for me in this game lol
---
It is a bit of a jarring transition and puts the game in an odd place after this last update. Prior to one wasteland unoptimized builds could still keep up with 90% of the content just fine, hell I would occasionally run non-legendary gear just for kicks when I wanted a challenge. I've been an unoptimized food build playing for over a year this way as it was just easier to run a ton of weight reduction perks and not have to spend so often cleaning up my excess inventory weight. My main weapon for 90% of my time has been a Bloodied handmade so added damage perks really weren't that crucial, but I guess I may have to finally bite the bullet and get a proper build. Anyone have food build to killing machine conversion guidebook? Lol. 
---
If One Wasteland had been offered as a new hardcore mode alternative to adventure mode I suspect the player split would have been about 50/50 this first week and over time dwindling down to probably fewer than 20% of players choosing it once the novelty wears off (and then eventually killing it off like survival mode). I'm still not really sure what they might do to rebalance for those struggling. Adding new legendary perks would screw the people that used all their coins to reoptimize already. I suspect they will go with targeted base damage buffs to weaker weapons classes and letting the nerfs to commando stay permanent.
---
I noticed similar, so I just drop the Born Survivor perk entirely and use things like Dodgy and Serendipity and keep moving - Healing Factor mutation will only kick in when you're out of a fight but that will save you a stim or two / sleep after combat. Thanks to Nerd Rage I can just about get by if I keep half an eye on the health bar and only use stimpacks when I need to, and make sure I'm always stocked up with food, corn soup especially.   
---
Aside from the farming suggestions below, another technique if you really need stimpacks is to go take out as many Blood Eagle camps as you can - they always drop plenty of stims.
---
Bethesda switched it, when they realized it was exactly the same as yesterday.
---
Well any donations are greatly appreciated, thank you
---
Understood! Thank you! I may switch then. Hopefully it’s a bit better, because I’m struggling lol.
---
Well the wiki has also updated to match this. I feel this was a bad decision on Bethesdas part. My math is now irrelevant and wrong and I now agree with the OP.
---
At first I was a bit meh about the scaling. But now I need to watch my ammo. And mats and actually be more careful. It is nice.
---
This is the second time I’ve used it but I think I will have to save it since it will be relevant and hopefully useful &amp; helpful in the coming days.
---
Todd frantically jumps on his alt account and starts polling the people on reddit in a last ditch effort to save the game
---
I run currently a bloodied sneak rifleman build. First daily op had modifiers to let the enemies see me always and they die only on melee. At least there is no penalty for dying every minute.
---
Not at all. There is a lot of range and the game becomes more difficult the further in you go. That said you still run into low level enmities in places you expect to see them. Having not played FO games before and only knowing 76 I would understand why someone would not understand why some people are upset by this latest change.
---
It was inferred but never stated.
---
A lot of my issues with the system now would be softened if we leveled up the slot and not the card.  It’s too costly to experiment with this system.
---
&gt;I'm going to listen to a PR desk jockey that's paid to lie to our faces
---
I mean
---
if that's what you want
---
of course multiplicative bonuses results in more damage than additive ones. that's the whole point. what I said is that it's most definitely not that much harder to balance things around multiplicative bonuses, it's clearly just an excuse.
---
Have an upvote
---
Will do! Thank you so much for the help! Definitely love these kind of interactions on this page!
---
That's exactly what I was hoping for!  ;-)
---
For me it's completely revitalized it.
---
Yeah, That would be nice. Although people that jump around like a bunny would hate that.
---
Hilarious. Thanks for answering
---
Ah must have done mine prior to that
---
Which is why Bethesda is evening the score with this update.
---
Ah, I saw that in demo, but I dont use PA...I'm reworking my alt to use it.
---
Because it would reveal the flaws in the build and give us an opportunity to give some advice. 
---
People like this don’t want help. They want to complain.
---
GFYS
---
I hope it's resilient tomorrow so you all cry more. Its not that hard to shoot the health down and then gun bash. Its not rocket science
---
Unarmed was nerfed ontop of the rest of the Nerfs, around 70% dmg reduction on all fist weapons
---
Mine was a bloodied 10mm lol. I used it for the forest area since 10mm ammo was so plentiful.
---
Yeah man I don't understand everyone's problem. You can't expect to have meh gear and a bunch of qol perks and do well. This is an mmorpg not a single player game
---
i don't know anyone who pick locks or hack terminals beside of provoking pvp at someones camp or nuclear winter. If you want to use it in Nuke Silos, there are faster and legit ways anyway.
---
either way, no location or quest or any other activity needs to hack a terminal or pick a lock. pretty useless if you are not farming specific items where most of them are also found somewhere else not locked up.
---
Well said. 
---
Feel like not enough people are paying attention to the added time sink of this &amp; the timing of the new Legendary Run. 
---
You can no longer go through a few things with friends in a short amount of time. The unintended side effect is going to be losing a large portion of the player base who just don’t have the extra time. 
---
Many people play this game to feel powerful, or at least do the run daily. They’ve changed enemies in F76 into The Division style Bullet Sponges, &amp; despite what people say I believe it’s less about the player experience than trying to encourage spending.
---
So true. I thought I was progressing after playing for a few weeks, the easy targets were nice to coast through a bit without stressing too much. Now everything is set to 11 constantly. That's no fun for some casual game  play. I'll stick around a bit and see if they fix this but I'm looking for a new game for sure.
---
Rebalancing from their standpoint. It wasn't easy to tell how damage stacks, so they flattened it out (harshly IMO) to mold it back up to normal damage. We don't know when everything will be at normal levels again. 
---
Also the reason two friends had the exact same Special Stats, Perks, food, chems, armor and Bloodied meathook and one was doing more damage. It didn't make sense.
---
"He's bloodied I'm Junkies"
---
All I needed to see. Wow you have great armor and weapons, guess what 99% of players don't have that stuff and probably never will. Cheese builds remain cheesy while everyone else suffers for it.
---
heh, too late for this
---
I would check if you can do it a second time, then, and earn the full rewards.
---
They give 5 points max.  So 15 total.  15 is pretty significant
---
Weeping sores disagrees
---
you're welcome! enjoy the game!
---
I will look for you most def. it’s not as bad as ppl make it sound believe me.
---
Floating was annoying, so I'm glad it's fixed, guess I got lucky on the walls or something, because they worked fine for me. I only had mounted heads (including sheepsquatch)and small things though. I think they should have made 2 seperate versions, like they did with the greenhouse dome.
---
There are no plans available to craft it ..... it has 4 mods: 3 bar mods- Dual Bar, bow bar, and Long bow Bar. And 1 "scope" mod: Flamer.
---
You can learn dual and bow bar, long bow and Flamer have to be purchased. They were rare vender mods at the start, but are pretty common mods now.
---
Thanks. We’ll give it a go.
---
Catering to new players rather than allowing the game world to be challenging in parts and easier in others is a mistake imo. Investing time to level up and take on those challenging areas is part of the fun. If everything levels with you, then you never really progress or feel a sense of accomplishment. That’s why investment of time matters ... to level up, to find the right weapons, to get the right perks ...
---
Yeah, it’s just I’ve always been a commando since day 1 of Nuclear Winter. I’ve always been a PVP commando in Adventure mode as well. I’d hate to change my whole play style because of 2 weapons.
---
doesn't sound like you encountered any bugs.
---
they don't make that much damage  on themselves, and considering how much stimpaks they drop,  you should be fine  in your power armor
---
I think it’s alright, not every slot has to be a home run. Camp objects and skins are alright. Love the lunch boxes and nuclear key cards. Junk is always welcome.
---
With one wasteland I finally have my old farming locations back, I was so sad when they were nerfed like a year ago
---
This comment would have a chance to be taken seriously if we could back to 2 years ago. We've stuck around this entire time. You think a lack of content is going to stop us? I have 2000 hours in this game and over a 100 of my levels came just from crafting chems. This update just pushes people like me who have helped keep this game alive for the past 2 years out of the game. You have photo mob and the HOA to thank for single handedly keeping this game alive just for you to make that comment. Lol
---
Thanks man! One more question, is it dependable if it doesn’t work on boss consistently? Because I don’t need magic on normal mobs
---
I disagree, actually. Having the animated cards was something fun. The system is already *bad* but it would be far worse if it were optimal to throw out rares.
---
Also, it would just add another layer of screw in that sometimes two animated cards get combined, which would "burn" extra perks. Or, you'd end up with a 1-level card and can't upgrade it.
---
" Thank god for people with cheated weapons. They bring balance back into the game. "
---
Wow what a stupid statement.
---
The game was boring and unfun since ALL weapons WITHOUT bloodied were killing enemies to easily.
---
Let alone with bloodied.
---
It's the sole reason my veteran player friend quit the game, since the enemies died too quickly he never felt like he was in danger outside of boss battles.
---
He is loving the new update.
---
Now groups of enemies are more dangerous to you while single enemies by themselves are relatively still easy to handle.
---
oooo good idea!
---
Two days ago Bloodied was called Easy mode.  It didn’t matter that your build or armor sucked because you were destroying everything anyway.  Now it’s different.   And we will adapt.  
---
Now, more than ever,it’s important to maximize your damage in a single weapon class.  A low health stealth comando still works, but takes some effort.  Use the adrenaline perk to boost damage before engaging the big boss enemy, for instance.   
---
Bloodied is all about time management.  It’s all well and good until you start taking damage.  At that point you’ll need a plan in place.  Knowing in advance how to react is going to make all the difference.  Ultimately, running bloodied will make you a better player (or, at least, now it will.)
---
Yeah floating isn't fixed tho
---
Considering us melee users are usually shafted I welcome the buff
---
I'm actually really pleased with the update right now. I've seen the argument that the update isn't a big deal to people over 50, it's the beginning that's "terrible" now. 
---
As somebody who tried to play ESO a couple times in the past, I can tell you that this One Wasteland was implemented 10000x better than One Tamriel. I was really worried they were gonna make the same mistakes. Even with the overall blanket nerf that we all got from remastered damage calculations, it still works out fine (as fine as Bethesda can get anyway.) 
---
If they had done Fallout the way the did ESO, then yeah, everybody over 50 would have to pump thousands of rounds into a rad roach to kill it. Not fun. 
---
Now ... if we could just get the rubber banding health issue fixed so I actually know what kind of damage I'm doing and not the magical VATs damage.
---
I don't personally know, but this exact question has been asked many times in the last 24 hours, so there is probably a lot of good info in one of those threads.
---
Let me get this straight, you're upset because your character can't be permanently stealthed?
---
I think a lot of the confusion displayed in the negative responses is that they don’t understand what “casual” means. I play ESO and F76 casually, primarily focused on building and decorating because *it relaxes me* and *engages my creativity*. I also really enjoy exploration, taking in the scenery, using photo mode, and the plot line. You know, all those things that are hard to follow when you’re chased miles away by things with claws and fangs.
---
I do the bare minimum of combat so that I can get the materials I need to indulge my favorite parts of the game. That said, combat in ESO is definitely much easier, because you can regenerate mana &amp; stamina. You can’t regenerate ammo in F76 by running around for a few seconds in combat or drinking a potion. You can regen AP, so guns are sort of like ranged weapons that require two types of ammo to fire (in VATS, anyways). 
---
And stimpaks? I used 20 in my first two hours of play today. I’m down to 20 caps at level 43 because I’ve been trying to find player vendors that sell stimpaks cheap.
---
I’ve full-cleared Borderlands 1 &amp; 2 solo, but haven’t finished B3 because the combat is *too easy* and I never run out of resources, because they regen on death and are cheap in the vending machine. So comparing F76 to any Borderlands game is a false equivalency.
---
I would say the biggest problem isn’t the fact that the combat difficulty scaled it. It’s THAT THE RESOURCE GENERATION DIDN’T. I’ve heard that ammo is supposed to drop more frequently, but I haven’t seen that in-game. I’m on Xbox, and in 2 hours of play, using a 10mm gun, I’ve had exactly 10 10mm bullets drop from enemies. Don’t know if that’s a glitch or “working as intended”, but I do know that I don’t like it. No sir, not one bit.
---
Edit: Also, non-casuals keep suggesting “improving your build”. If the build worked fine a few days ago, why should we be forced to change it because of a decision from the developers? We paid for a game where our build was fine; the game changed, not our build.
---
You're not wrong.  But putting a band-aid on the situation isn't the most efficient way to go either.  It's stupid that the math worked the way it did, that's a rookie programming mistake, and the *right* thing to do is to fix it.
---
What they should have done was boost all base (weapon) damage by X% at the same time, to help cushion the changeover.  Well, a *full* re-balance would have been better, but I fear that's asking a lot from them.
---
Honestly though, I haven't had any real issues with things, and I even dropped my vanguard gear for unyielding int to boost XP (without actually going bloodied), and I'm still able to kill things easy enough.  But I'm well-equipped, for the sub-50 crowd and those still gearing up, things look pretty rough right now.
---
You might want to read up on how the Ops work; they are randomized.
---
The resilient buff on mobs forces you to melee kill them, this is the intended way as stated by the pre-mission brief.
---
Are you using sneak multipliers? If not you should be. With Covert Operative, Silent but deadly (+50% damage for silenced weapons at night, and the new legendary perk Follow Through, I would hope you can still take out most enemies in just a few hits. My problem with low RoF rifles is getting swarmed.
---
That's what the resilient mutation is man....
---
Same boat!
---
If it’s not the issue, then post the build. 
---
You know why you’re reluctant?  Because if anyone else with the exact same build (or very close to it) isn’t having the problems in One Wasteland that you’re having, then you’ll ***actually be right***. 
---
The build would be fine... *so then what could be an alternative cause of your problem?*
---
Bah. I'll check it out tonight, but this is not encouraging.
---
You know what? I would love to get a better weapon but idk how I'm supoost to that considering I used every single fucking resource i had in 1 mission. I'm not being overdramatic I'm also mid-low level and you are level 100. Face it the update did the exact opposite of what it was intended to do and is going to make the game umbareable for lower level players. They need to find  a middle ground for helping low level players and making the game harder for higher level ones.
---
some tips, as I despise gathering mats for ammo myself: use handmades or assault rifles, 5.56 is plentiful and you can always hit west tek for more. I know the rep grind sucks but the armco machine from the raiders produces 5.56 faster than water.
---
focus on agility, sneak, escape artist and covert operative if you haven't already. this way you'll be wasting roughly half as much ammo. similarly, invest in critical savvy, better criticals and eagle eyes. with unyielding armor or a 15% faster crit fill weapon, you can get a 2:1 or even 1:1 cycle, which also helps your ammo consumption.
---
Can't relate as I'm capable of aiming on my own
---
The patch note actually say  "You can take on Daily Ops alone or in a team of up to four other players."  Recommends level 50+
---
If you leveled instead of complained, you'd probably have some big boy perks by now
---
Wait until you see what's coming out of the daily ops...diseases are going to matter very little any more.
---
If the only problem you had was storing scrap, the subscription completely solves that.
---
Daily ops are actually awful
---
Oh you haven't tried the disease build? Heh... No. I agree, I rather see more in-game ailments like frozen/burning effects. Maybe they can add a mod to the syringer to sleep your enemy for X amount of time.
---
The moment you realize you can no longer run Leader of the Pack for low level legendaries to drop in gift packages for new players. 😔
---
That's simple not true. 
---
Can't be so difficult to make a game challenging for high levels AND playable for low levels. What here happend wasn't a good "level scaling"
---
Yea, I'm totally with you. I was level 28 before the update, and am level 32 now. While I may be gaining way more exp, I'm honestly just, not having fun at all. I've **completely** run out of scrap, ammo, and almost caps. This simply isn't sustainable. All my armor and weapons are totally busted.
---
To think I was considering buying Fallout 1st before this patch.
---
You can take it on alone, but ITV they have said if you want to earn rewards you’re better off on a team.
---
Two secs and I’ll just check what perks I’m using
---
I played all the fallout games, i would rather a single player game to be made like everyone else.
---
However i am not naive and think that this ONLINE game should NOT be catered to casuals who find any kind of challenge a bad thing.
---
The game wants you to play together or at least encourage it.
---
Same. I went from 363 to 366 yesterday afternoon. The only buff was well rested and canned meat stew. 
---
During the last season I had to server hop west tek 6 or 7 times to get a level for the daily level up. yesterday I did whatever the hell I wanted, it was great.
---
no, TSE is dead since Bethesda nerfed it more then a year ago.
---
Even IF TSE does more damage on paper, the accuracy and durability sucks and is not better than anything else. I would rather play non legendarys since i would hit and don't have to repair every 10 shots. Don't believe everything someone said somewhere online.
---
You basically craft legendary weapon-armor by using them.
---
I built a bunker using underground glitch. Good luck getting to me now!
---
Have you tried reading any of the 8273 posts about it since yesterday?
---
You mean it is considered a melee attack?
---
That would change everything for me in a good way.lol
---
Used not shared.    
---
Your highest determines how many slots you get and for me I have 3.    
---
Each character gets 50 perk coins aat 50 or if they are past that they are added when you log in. Each character must Scrap their own cards to get Perk Coins. Be very careful in what you equip as it costs 1 con per Unequip per slot.
---
I agree. My issue is that I want more little camp items and the like
---
They are mediocre at best. In about 2 weeks, nobody will participate.
---
honestly a lot of people who complain about the game being too easy don't have all their facts straight.
---
I just started playing but agree. It’s been relatively flawless.
---
That is SHIT (literally, caca in spanish means shit)
---
That’s what resilient means. It’s a mutation. The daily ops summary tells you that.
---
this is true when it comes to special events and actual end game content but not for walking out of my camp to collect some herbs.
---
Im also frustrated because i got my ass kicked in there.but i did it solo.
---
What do you mean, is 12 vintage nukashine not good enough for you?
---
Mutants swing speed switch blade with strength , paired with martial artist was like being in prison and stabbing the biggest guy in the yard your second day in so no one makes you thier bitch by the 3rd day ,every time i encountered a super mutant .-fhp fhp fhp fhp- Whos the bitch now ? *spams the crouch button over super mutant*
---
I got the Symptomatic last night. Bye bye diseases.
---
That makes me sad. I got through a lot of levels with my bloodied lever action.
---
piercing gaze is permanent. yay.
---
Dude, that looks like... [crap](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iu2696/behold_the_caca_chinese_advanced_combat_armor/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf).
---
Pop you food in them and they keep it safe from getting squashed. Usually held closed by 1 or 2 small clasps and made of hardy plastic.
---
That’s a plan you can’t trade unfortunately.
---
This also means that you cannot outpace another player unless you are simply leveling faster. So I suppose it wasn't such a bad idea.
---
They could have hit the middle with 3 per star or as OP suggested add them as rewards for other things. Only time will tell now.
---
These changes did nothing to stop people with the cheese builds that made the game into a joke, it actually boosted them further above everyone else. Bloodied and Junkies are just fine and thriving while everyone else got dumped on. It's a joke.
---
Not enough budget. Even after I destroyed several items. Budget bar didn't move anything. :(
---
Yeah, I played ops blindy before coming on reddit since I didn't want to know the meta run and I easily got elder with an afk on my second run making 0 changes to my stealth commando build. People want everything to be too easy.
---
I made the switch from rifleman to commando a while back, when it wasn't as big a change as it is now.  It is SO much easier once you get set up, and you really only need to change your 3 agi cards out.
---
Personally I'd look at junkie's, but if you're already invested in bloodied gear you should be OK.  Bloodied is still a ways ahead of junkie's in damage, I just personally don't like dying every time I stub my toe :P
---
Every veteran player i talked to thinks its great since they all found it too easy in the past even with subpar builds.
---
I only find any pushback on the reddit/forums.
---
Lol that "still"
---
You know that commando ist the best build and will be soon more meta than ever before?  Of course you tear trough enemies... Try rifleman and you will see what people are talking about
---
Daily ops are painfully boring
---
I just did one with exploding eagles and one of the team had no anti-explosive. It was sure entertaining.
---
Hahahah!
---
Oh my god, this just keeps getting better! &lt;3
---
I don’t know what other bloodied players are using, but as a bloodied player diluted is great. They weigh less and heal the same as normal stims. And diluted radaway works better if you get too many rads in a fight. Heals just enough to maintain the damage output.
---
LMAO good job Bethesda... fucking wow.
---
It's ALL still stupidly easy, even with the nerf. It's just more time consuming. That's the bottom line with bullets sponge, it doesnt make anything harder. Now i have to spend more time gathering resources and managing my insanely limited inventory. This game is all about time block and limits. For an Open world game which is supposed to give you freedom, it feel like a job i have to punch in.
---
All so they can get people to connect daily so they spend money in the Atomic Shop.
---
Me laughing even harder as my fixer melts everything around you before you can reload your second set off 4 bolts😆😆😆
---
That would have been the smart thing
---
how can you expect to learn anything from reading posts? making you own post, that's where true knowledge comes from.
---
it has been over 3 months since I have played fo76. i will for sure have to hop on and check this out along with the recent patch!
---
Doesnt mean a game needs to be balanced around them.
---
People would get dysentery and diarrhea in the post apocalypse more often. STDs would be more common. I think a char who has dysentery would both vomit and shit himself/herself giving him/her a  unique buff and debuff to enemies.    
---
In fact, if your char had it too long they would stain their stuff getting a debuff which would be cleaned using 2 Abraxo, a washing machine, and 10 Boiled water.
---
On generic mobs outside of daily ops, vats and stealth are still viable. With adrenaline and crits and sneak, melee or ranged (haven't tested melee, but did sneak shotty closer ranged fine). Definitely depends which build you have, but this patch favors high strength and/or agility, high RoF, vampire's, explosive (demo expert), anti-armor, instigating, and whatnot. Going from bloodied to half-health and suffering five addictions, save unyielding and an autostim piece here. Haven't had much trouble build-wise and running QoL perks too. Power armor and vamp weapons are my solo ops combo. Explosive, antiarmor combat shotty on mostly everything else. Melee? Power attacks
---
Totally said this same thing last time this happened. I know it is about extra storage, but they just need to make it happen so issues like this aren't likely to occur again. Ofcourse, anything is possible with Bethesda, so I won't say for sure it'll fix it.
---
An option for higher difficulty with higher rewards, seems like a win-win for everyone. You'll have a difficulty option for people who want to build-chase in their masochistic spreadsheet balancing, and an option for casual players who just want to have fun
---
Yup, the objectives are so unimaginative
---
The problem is the nerf hits them the hardest because you start with pipe weapons pistols and melee. Mats aren't very accessible to low levels especially not when high levels are going to regularly clean out the low level zones making mirvs is pretty costly at low level and they're heavy without much carry weight to begin with.
---
They're going to be more reliant on events like meat week and so on. Best advice they can get right now is open up a building team straight out of the vault. Hopefully someone will at least jump in and share inspirational
---
yeah, you best bet is hopping into PA or securing a set of troubleshooter and mutant slayer armor.
---
Follow Through, Taking One For The Team and anything that fills gaps in your SPECIAL
---
I haven’t used that one! Good to know :D
---
$$$
---
Vault 94 was always a well designed dungeon, especially with the sections that would randomly change each time and you'd have to take a different route through. I wish they had kept some of that because it would have added a layer of complexity to the daily ops that it doesn't have now. The problem with the raids was the server lag and unrealistic time limits that dragged it down and having no matchmaking was the nail in the coffin.
---
Punchy punchy boom boom
---
Oh legendary module used in crafting ok ok this is not bad since getting the right mod with powerfist is indeed more difficult with the rng, how did you get it  ?
---
Maybe a server lag/bug issue because the circle of effect is actually pretty large and there's no need to be on a team as far as I've experienced.
---
I have been lucky when starting one so far, either I join one and see my team doing it or I start it and encourage others to follow
---
how is that build going for you? i am currently a bloodied but since theve nurfed damage ive become quite week and die lots so i am looking for a new build.
---
It brought me back to the game and the addition of daily ops is just icing on the cake
---
Oh, geez, I thought you knew that and that was an intentional joke. 
---
Sorry if my other post seemed out of context then.
---
If they were gonna completely trash a build you'd think they would pick the actual cheese builds like Bloodied or Junkies.
---
Stealth would make the whole thing trivial. Just sneak to the objectives, then sneak to the boss and take it out. Everyone would be soloing elder every day.
---
I would just love to see the non min/max builds people are complaining won't work any more. I run a vamp gatling that did 198 damage before the update and now does 172 damage after the update. I run a ton of QoL perks. My build is just as viable now as it was pre OW. I still 1-2 shot many enemies. And now, with the legendary perks, I've gained even more survivability.
---
Another slap in the face from bethesda. My build is shit now  while people melting down bosses with magic and hacked weapons.
---
got news for you, the actual problem builds already do that and they did nothing to stop it but somehow Stealth is a problem.
---
Yup, up to a point anyway
---
No wonder things felt weird!  What a bummer :/
---
Once per character per day
---
Unfortunately on of many builds made less viable, it needs a total rework.
---
I think it would be fine if they did *either* the multiplicative/additive fix **or** One Wasteland.
---
But both? That's just too much. An enemy buff and a player nerf in one patch? How did this pass playtesting...
---
Oh dang thank you anyway
---
I disagree.    
---
My Stealth Sniper took a hit and I'll probably find a fix but my Shotgun char is still rockin' pretty good.
---
Makes me wonder what their metrics are telling them.  Are people staying with the game for shorter and shorter periods?  So - appeal to new players because the future of the game depends on them, because longer-term players are leaving and not coming back?  I hope that there's a game in here for EVERYONE.
---
I must admit this was a concern I had about one wasteland. When I was leveling up the first time, the hardest part of the game (and the hardest time of my fo76 career so far) was between levels 25 and 35. At level 35/40 your damage goes up, your resistances go up and you have enough perks and perk points to start making a build work. 
---
I suspect the same is true for one wasteland but now there is 'nowhere to hide'.
---
What I did then, have done with my alts, and I recommend to you now is that you find a location you are comfortable with (it was westtec for me), grab some cranberry relish, Berry mentats, well rested and unyielding armor (if you have it) etc and just grind through 5-10 levels. Also, you will need to decide on a build (if you have not already) and start working on that (forget all the qol perks - they can wait) .
---
I'm sure that Bethesda will balance the gameplay for the 25-35 range at some point but it won't be any time soon.
---
Oh and as others have suggested, grab yourself a fairly fast swing speed vampires melee weapon to same on stims and ammo.
---
I have a stealth rifleman, the nerf is not that bad. All this crying and moaning is ridiculous. I can still kill easily in a few shots, if your complaint is literally just that you can't one shot anymore then I don't have any sympathy for you, stop replying on one shot kills to make you think the game is fun
---
LoL dude i had no idea! :D
---
Anyways friend you and peter pointing that out just made this much more funnier.
---
did my 1st daily ops today with a team, all i did was invite everyone on the map and spam 'follow me' emote while doing the ops
---
I mean the giant almost eifle tower power pylons around the map, the large red and white ones, would it fit under one
---
No 100 per lunchbox
---
Dude me too. The entitlement is UNREAL
---
Not after level 100.
---
Yo, ikr, Sunny at the Foundation sells them like 9c each or smth.
---
Well i use it to obliterate it regular mobs and it does work on bosses but not alot. I get it enough on bosses for it to be worth using though and im on xbox so
---
Nice! I haven’t done today’s yet but I hear people like it more than yesterday so I’m excited to try it.
---
This i totally understand but I think it will adversely impact the games longevity. If they can honestly connect with their player base there is hope but i think i see the end is nigh
---
There is a whole world of grey between your black and white view..
---
I’ve heard some whispers of a persistent creature kill even on log-in bug. Where no matter how many times u relog the bodies will still follow u
---
Me too! Preferably functional ones, but with the BGS its always a bit of hit and miss.
---
Different zones have different max mob levels, but yeah, they'll be as close to you as they can be with that restriction.
---
How do they do that of no one can sneak?
---
You could do the daily ops like the rest of us and get exp as well as rewards... it’s better exp than the way they were before.
---
New player here, only level 14 so far. Just played for about a half hour today for the first time since the update, and it was awful. 
---
The fact that enemies respawn so regularly wasn't so bad before considering the decent amount of backtracking that I tend to do, but now that they're all scaled up to my level, just going anywhere takes forever and a ridiculous amount of ammo. 
---
Like I first cleared out this Clarksburg 8 levels ago and it was a fun challenge then. It's okay for it to be easier now that I've already done it three times. I don't need to use all my bullets and wear out half my guns fighting my way into the town again just so I can spend 30 seconds reading a terminal for some little side quest. 
---
Every single feral ghoul that I run into doesn't need to be a significant project. A headshot with a rifle  should just drop them, like it usually did before the update.
---
I did this, coming back after like a year off. My pistol build was already weaker than i remembered.. now I'm a junkie commando.
---
Thank you very much.
---
I like being able to explore vaults again, but it's been awhile since we got a really creative and unique vault. The atmosphere of Vault 94 was super creepy and Vault 22 esque, but I was disappointed to see it was populated with just mirelurks. I was expecting spore carriers or something different when I saw the atmosphere.
---
I get it's supposed to be used for another event so maybe they just couldnt fit in a mirelurk queen at the end or some wild ending to the vault.
---
Uplink will have that mod, not every single ops mission that's introduced. If you want to be useful in Uplink, change your perks before you go. The complaint is "I can't use stelth here". And my response is: so?
---
I keep seeing the same dumb arguments being made.
---
If it's all too stupidly easy then you should have no problem with the nerf.
---
Contradicting yourself much? 
---
Saying there is no challenge is dumb because it's not about making it challenging for 1v1 enemy encounters with a level 100 rad roach.
---
Nor should anyone have sympathy "because it takes longer".
---
That's just you being bad at the game.
---
The update doesn't really change my game play that much at all enemies now take 1 or 2 extra hits.
---
It's about  making it more balanced to have high level fights be challenging for daily ops.
---
Stop trying to ruin a good update for those who actually care about balance.
---
IF you think a  specific weapon needs to be boosted the dev team has said they will be further adjusting things now that the foundation for damage boosting is more predictable.
---
So make a thread and suggest what your weapon damage should be for a specific weapon on their official forum.
---
This is something they were actually asking for since they know not all weapons are where they should be.
---
I have a low level character too dipshit I played a few hours on it today and didn't die one time. Never ran through as much ammo as you did. Nothing. My level 20 got to 25 with ease and will continue to progress. When I make my third alt it will be fun as hell starting from scratch in a more hostile environment. Sorry the heat is too much for you I guess lmao but it's nowhere near as bad as you're making it out to be, and I'm speaking from experience
---
Now that everything is nerfed, I plan on showing up in my underwear, using my bare fists.
---
If they are going to remove Stealth from an entire mode then future modes should promote Stealth and make everyone else adapt like we have to now. It's only fair I think.
---
Also it's already possible to stealth an uplink if you're careful so it didn't completely remove that aspect. You'll be under Caution but it's possible. Takes a lot of luck though so it's not really skill based.
---
Sorry for my bad english, i meant how did you get the gauntley plan did you buy it ? Is it a reward given by foundation or crater ?
---
The gauss does one-shot marine perked out, handmades don't.
---
The gauss has a large blast radius, handmade require presice aim.
---
A gun that requires precise aim should kill much faster than a weapon with a massive blast radius. If explosives can one-shot, precision weapons should one-shot too.
---
Yeah this would be ok or let us have our private servers toggle it on and off.
---
I do the Science Scribe's Outfit with the Raider Skinner Hood.  It's odd enough to make a cool Sniping Outfit.
---
Why isn't this in this game? So much was already pulled from FO4, why not this?
---
You said it man. I said my peace in this subject a good amount today. I'm rather disappointed in the scaling. I never found the game to hard after level 50, that's subjective but after level 50 everything starts to open up. 
---
Now what's the fun with every enemy in the whole wasteland being scaled to an insane level.
---
Lol, really? I now Merde(i think thats how you write it) is mierda in spanish.
---
Wait, I thought you had to still have the lockpick/hacking perks active and this just made it so you auto-hacked them? Does it remove the need for having those perks active entirely?
---
I do the Science Scribe's Outfit with the Raider Skinner Hood.  It's odd enough to make a cool Sniping/Marksman Outfit.
---
Alright thanks, y'all. I ran into it with my son because he said he needed help so I didn't pay attention to any briefing.
---
Yes I believe it’s around 4 minutes
---
Just did one and I got a couple.
---
I heard that daily ops was gonna be tougher so I dropped the stealth perks, threw on dodgy, born survivor, and PA with emergency protocols.  Was never in any real danger, although the survivor perk procced a bunch of times the cooldown is only 20secs and that was more than needed.  I looted more stims than I used and thought it would be harder actually.  
---
My biggest problem was getting lost in the burrows...
---
to make 8 mins you gotta just run to each node and I don't know that place well.  Plus I'm easily distracted.  Been conditioned to kill everything and then loot, it pains me to run past mobs.
---
Glad to hear more people being realistic and happy!
---
I use an explosive lever action rifle with all mods + maxed out rifle perks 190dmg; lvl 75 molerrat takes 4 body hits and 2 head hits to kill; if its a group its possible you die cause you only have 5 rounds before reloading and those insta spawn near you; btw super mutants on the other hand arent a problem at all because in general they dont come close to you.
---
You need to get out of your little forest man cave.
---
So do we need to delete our display cases too or just vendors?
---
This I can understand more
---
They need to fix the sneak. It's totally broken since the patch.
---
As someone who solo's as much as I play with my wife, I wish there was a toggle for One Wasteland. It makes sense for group play with a large level gap (would be cool if it kicked in automatically when people grouped up), but it's little more than an ammo/weapons sink for anyone above 75 who does a few daily events/quests.
---
If I can ever convince my buddy to pickup the game, it'll definitely feel like a welcomed addition, but I wasn't thrilled having to deal with level 50 mole rats or scortched in Camden Park when I strolled through to do the easy daily yesterday.

I was getting flustered tooo with the dailies and such .... long time fallout fan here !! That sucks to hear ... i took a break for a couple of weeks then came back and played how i wanted , if i want to do dailies then i will if not just want to have fun bam done the way i see it is its my game it will be around for a while you really don’t get QOL improvements from it (irl) but i do like the patch all in all
---
You know , you don’t have to do the dailies lol. I stopped playing for the majority of the summer,came back the last week of season 1 and still got over 50% of the board
---
Oh so you don’t know, huh?
---
As long as 2 are loaded you can spam them indefinitely in VATS. Now I’m really laughing 😂
---
It was also to help force a natural cap drain to prevent inflation, just like the 10% sales tax.
---
Shoot I dont care. Anything that'll give me exp to level up. Sorry I'm hella late on the response had to talk to my pops for a bit there.
---
they wish
---
Explode upon death
---
It will not change, you can't cheese the daily ops with stealth.
---
I think people are too entitled and have a narrow view of the world if they think they should cater to either new or old players based on a subjective standard of "time invested". 
---
Every player has a different experience.
---
Did one run in vault 94 with 2 randoms , it was actually fun . We got elder with 30 seconds to spare, had never visited 94 before despite over 2k hours playtime lol
---
Hear here
---
That’s one wasteland, he’s talking about the change in damage calculations
---
You a high level? You enjoy everything being scaled? Even in the forest? Eh I'm all for everything but the scaling.
---
Yeah, but how hilarious would that be?
---
**You’re on a Casual team, just browsing through some vendors...** 
---
*Ooh, 20 stable flux for only 50c each?  Yes, please!  Let’s just push that purchase button and select how many we want, which is ALL of them of course!  Huh?  Wait, what’s going on?  Why am I in a loading screen?  Where the hell am I?  And when did the team get changed over to Daily Ops?  I heard about that, but haven’t read up on it yet, what is it? Who the hell is this ‘Initiate Dodge’ asshole?* ***AND WHY ARE ALL THESE ROBOTS ATTACKING ME AND NOT DYING!!!  AHHH!  GET ‘EM OFF!!!***
---
Im not reluctant im just at work. I said im not a broken record once already, but here I go again. **Nothing was wrong with my build before OW**.

If you can find a B FSS weapon of some type, I recommend it highly for the resiliant effect.  I was dying constantly by running my bloody sneak commando, but then I brought in my B FSS mole miner gauntlet and ripped through the robots super easily.  Even tried the event solo and did decently well.
---
Just fix the Tyler county fair and make all the mini games cost caps but give out only few tickets for some exclusive decorative items
---
It's a good change. And will continue to help the game to get better.
---
Are you on PC and Steam?
---
Also I didn't even have melee perks equipped and did well
---
I’m mainly using quality of life perks (e.x bear arms for reduced heavy weapon weight and scatter shot for shotgun weight reduction) 
---
The only damage perks I’m using 
---
* = level of perk
---
Strength - 15
---
3* bear arms 
---
3* pack rat
---
2* sturdy frame
---
2* ordinance express
---
2* master shotgunner
---
1* shotgunner
---
1* scattershot for slight reload speed buff
---
1* bandolier for ammo
---
Perception- 11 (base 9 + 2 with legendary perk)
---
3* expert command
---
3* master command 
---
3* rifleman
---
1* concentrated fire to target limbs
---
1* green thumb for farming I just don’t replace it
---
Endurance - 2
---
2* Vaccinated
---
Charisma - 9
---
4* lone wanderer when solo for damage reduction + ap regen
---
Or
---
*1 strange in numbers if you use mutations like me
---
3* team medic {I’m medic for my team)
---
With either of those choices I finish with
---
1* travel agent for cheaper travel
---
1* suppressor card to reduce enemies damage output
---
Agility - 5 (base 3 + 2 legendary)
---
3* enforcer

---
Luck - 8
---
3* bloody mess
---
2* class freak
---
2* starched genes
---
1* lucky break for random armour repair 
---
Or If I don’t care about gaining\ losing mutations
---
*3 one gun army instead of starched genes and lucky break
---
Thanks :)
---
you do not have to be casual to find it annoying to repair your gear all the time or to craft ammo for 10 minutes. Its not about the challenge it is about how they did not align the gameplay around it.
---
I'm only rank 105 I think so im not too great yet
---
A lot of people do have to adapt- every bloodied build that ran low health no power armor everywhere in Appalachia now has to get in a suit or use some rad away, everyone that uses guns have to adapt to melee for resilient, everybody that uses melees has to sit in a particular zone while enemies outside the melee range hit them. Taking a step outside ur perspective can open a world of possibilities like sympathy, empathy, and other imaginative tricks that make u better at connecting with people and seeing their point of view
---
The post is kinda unclear. He's saying that you can get to R&amp;G Station for 4 caps. It is "a train station" so you can vendor your legendaries. 
---
Once you discover both Foundation and R&amp;G, you can fast travel to Foundation for free from anywhere, then to R&amp;G for 4 caps.
---
Nah.  It's a decent challenge.  You're just a wuss about it.
---
Or kick down locked doors?
---
Took them half a year lol. What a joke.
---
Even at lvl 170 I still carry my instigating combat knife &amp; I love it for low level areas. Also kinda like the flippadeedoo animation when you equip it!
---
 I'm severely disappointed with the bloodied nerf, my instigating explosive crossbow is almost as powerful now as my bloodied MMG. I'm just annoyed because my entire build, including armour, is purely based on being bloodied &amp; now I feel I need to change everything. So disappointed. 😔
---
I logged in last night and went straight to the ops - hey it's new. I don't follow patch notes, I just do what I want (I'm a rebel that way /s). No one else was there. It was hard. I was frustrated. I feel like my controller doesn't register "PUNCH". I got (an still am) so frustrated by the whole thing. After leaving ops, everything just felt so hard and tiresome. I, like you, was already feeling burned out - so maybe that's the issue. I don't know. I just know I did not have a good time with the new ops.
---
And I'll say this (before my husband comes in here and responds): I know it's not always going to be punching, I know it's not always going to be solo, I probably shouldn't have jumped into it right off the bat... But here's what I said to him: WHATEVER! I do what I want! lol Just kidding. That's not what I said.
---
over 40 times
---
I really wish they'd make it more useful, honestly. Put the world events in that same menu, for instance.
---
Bloodied players make me want to put my arch right in front of my vendor.
---
I get it, you shoot big ouch
---
Wait you can buy lunch boxes?!?!?!
---
So far the only good thing is that I get lots of ammo back from the bots. Otherwise it is a frustrating experience,  even in PA.
---
*quivers with melee-build anticipation*
---
how do I know what friends will troll me tho? also you are no help
---
Damn I didn’t even get a chance to do it yet
---
They need to remove the scaling...
---
you mean everyone pissed about it -&gt; just grind for 200h to get better gear \*facepalm
---
&gt; This is just for QOL.
---
Agree 100%.
---
My assumption is most of those disagreeing do not have fallout first.
---
heck no! i wanted them but i knew they where not legit
---
Combined with x01 I don't think I've even taken on any rads it's amazing
---
You see a problem.  I see an xp farm of sorts for melee builds not afraid of dying.
---
I agree. Sometimes I wouldn’t mind having a harder server like one wasteland. Sometimes I just want to relax and loot and shoot things.
---
Her wings can be crippled now, making her land much more.
---
But how do you just "grab" yourself an "OP-legendary weapon". I appreciate your response, and the fact that it's so much kinder and more understanding than others, but everyone says to grab a this or that legendary weapon or armor. I have like, 30 scrip. I can't grind legendaries like the Uranium Mine event because I have no ammo or anything.
---
For people who weren't already set up comfortably with optimal builds and legendaries, this patch is impossible.
---
Really enjoying the scaling and am really hoping and looking forward to better gun balancing.
---
But I do feel like a god with my power armor and junkie limb damage ultracite gat.
---
Yea shits annoying as fuck. The scaling needs to go!
---
It's true I've been praising the update while sitting comfortably at 135, with my build fully cemented and my weapon of choice in hand, but I do have a level 13 gunslinger I play on the off. I do hear what you're saying.
---
I haven't logged on him since the update, but I expect things to be a lot tougher and... more interesting for him, though I'll have to wait till tonight to see for sure.
---
Or you make the best of what you have...I needed damage perks to get by and the only ones I had were pistol perks...I went 50 levels!!!!! without a shotgun or heavy weapons perk, not even a bloody mess.
---
I took pistol and rifleman because I needed to up my damage and those were all I had. I could save up 20 or 30 perks to level 50 and then I spend 20 or 30 levels struggling through even some of the weaker areas.
---
Oh ok so sneak commando builds are not using bloodied or junkies.
---
You do not have a clue what you are talking about.
---
Ah, nice lol.
---
I do not complain about enemy buff because they give way more XP than before and this is good LOL and it's way more challenging dues to the higher level enemies (ultimate tier enemies maybe?) appearing like Demolisher Supermutants at level 100. Think that I'm a bloodied melee/rifleman build so the nerf just hit me where it's most painful
---
Ore too.
---
Just for Uplink. Change your perks before you go into uplink, or stay out of uplink, or go in anyway and try to be useful. It sounds like a lot of people were counting on being able to stealth *everything*. Here's something you can't stealth.
---
And do you know *why* it's disabled for Uplink? Because stealth would make Uplink ridiculous. You could stealth your way to the first three beacons, and just sit stealthed for the progress meter to fill on the last two. No fighting would be required until the first three objectives were completed. The whole point of Uplink is to keep you in combat the entire time.
---
Would you like the event to simply present you with a "success" button? People are talking about this like they *want* the game to be broken in their favor.
---
Man people whine so much
---
Not only they didn't fixed vats, stealth is broken with more than 1 person, and they broke concentrated fire, calling it a "fix"    
---
Try to use a TSE weapon for more than a minute without breaking it.    
---
Have I mentioned queen seems to be bugged and won't drop repair kits?  
---
Damage nerf was nothing compared to those
---
Define “fuck all.”
---
I think it's great. Afew extra swings and that's it. And daily ops is fun too.
---
ps4
---
At which point did I say it was harder? fucking read man.
---
"You're just bad at the game" lol, really? this is Fallout 76 we're talking about. NOTHING is hard. Nothing requires you to be good at anything. You think way too much of your ability to play an easy game. 
---
I'm complaining because this game offers NO challenge, and instead of making fights fun, they simply extend them. Not making them harder, adding mobs with different abilities to force you to think.
---
The priority of this game is clearly the Atomic shop. We can wait weeks and months between fixes and balance, but ho ho ho, the atomic shops get a very healthy daily checkup.
---
Patch notes may have some info for you.
---
you are on pc right? on xbox, there is nothing popping up. when i open the map, its just in the lower left corner, expandable with up on dpad. very strange they implanted it in different ways on the plattforms.
---
These decisions are being made to maximize profit for Bethesda, as several other players have pointed out. Stretching out the game loop so you need more bullets, more stimpacks, take more damage, need to repair items more often ... either people are forced to invest more time or spend $ for repair kits and other items.
---
Yes, Bethesda is a business ... but making a good game should be the priority out of respect to all players. I don’t believe the One Wasteland patch did that.
---
I’m not saying their isn’t but with this old game engine I’m not sure what people expect it’s the same engine The elder scrolls games were made on. I use this as a comparison because I feel it’s appropriate. 
---
When you fight a giant in Skyrim and you whittle it’s health away while slicing its knees you don’t question it being a sponge or why it’s taking so many slashes you enjoy the fight with the massive meat bag that can send you to the rocket with two hits. 
---
That’s basically what fighting the harder enemies are like in this game high health/damage opponents that put up as good of a fight as you
---
They could turn it into a questline as well for more content.
---
Drop a tiny entrance somewhere on the map, leading to an underground facility with some crazy advanced experimental machine that gives you longer lasting buffs in exchange for a solid number of caps and various components depending on which buff you want.
---
In order to even find it, here's a new questline.
---
Want to unlock the machine that does the buffing? Another questline.
---
The machine now works, but unfortunately most of the recipes were wiped in a hacker attack, you'll have to find the different ones in various places around the map - quest for each one you want to unlock.
---
Got them all? Great, turns out each formulae had a small part of a top secret super soldier serum (yeye, Captain America rip off, whatever, just a placeholder idea), temporarily boosting all your SPECIALs for a few hours.
---
Even if you manage the questline, cost of each application is expensive as fuck, so you'll only be able to use/see it used very rarely.
---
Bunch of new content, all because of needing a caps dump.
---
Also, I suggest the initial quest starts in a entrance hidden beneath an outhouse. Wade through the shit to get to the good stuff.
---
Or just jump in to PA and walk around like normal.
---
I use excavator PA and a Vampire 308 and have not gone down once in Ops.
---
Then you still need to account for that in your equations. Between the bug that ate dupe cards and spent points, you're going to find that you are just out those remaining "50". Bethesda gave 50 coins up front to "helps" and tho it isn't enough for all situations, that's most likely all we will get.
---
For highest levels (100+), they’ll be the highest possible level for each area.
---
For some unknown reason i kinda changes back to my old built recently today actually it bacame easier
---
It’s working fine for me - are you in the Daily Ops?  Piercing Gaze is essentially impossible to do stealth with (for good reason). I went in there today crouched and a Gutsy saw me from across the sewer. Out of the Daily Ops, though, stealth has worked just fine, including Escape Artist
---
should have been bitching about it and getting down voted into oblivion like I was for the last 3 months if you cared so much..
---
it's too fucking late now..
---
I didnt say it was hard. Its just an annoyingly inconvenient mechanic that doesn't fit well with the nature of the task. The robots basically stay out of the uplink area the majority of the time which causes the player(s) to leave the area and not be able to secure the objective. Its counter-intuitive.
---
Either way I really hope it doesn't return tomorrow and yes I will be one of the ones crying!😫
---
I see your point. I think this comes down to a gameplay preference as I enjoy the added toughness. Weapons being weaker isnt great but also they were honestly broken and the damage calculations were bizarre.
---
As for ammo i wasent saying you'd use less i just meant that I always had an abundance before(granted I am not a heavy gunner).
---
I can also say that I don't think I'd be pleased if they caused the game to uninstall on everyone's system, that just seems sadistic.
---
It's true, it's now a more balanced game where people are not running around one-shotting everything.
---
Cant sign under this, srry. Im lvl 400ish and my legacy plasma gatling still goes brrrrrrrrrr and everything vanishes....should probably ditch the gun, cause the game is not fun this way...srry, im Not looking for pity, just how i feel recently....
---
All I know is - I've been playing since early July.
---
I'm in my low 300s, and I have:
---
3 - level 1 legendary perk cards.  No perk coins spent - but all 3 are still very helpful.  (infiltrator, what rads, and ammo)
---
2 - level 4 special cards (strength / int)
---
1 - level 3 special card (luck)
---
about 5 perk coins
---
and 120 unspent levels - which would more than let me max out luck.
---
So at level 300... I could have 3 maxed cards.  That doesn't seem so bad to me.  Still something to play for.
---
I’m on PC and mine is as you describe it as well- I play with controller tho
---
Correcto!
---
I'd love it if they didn't regain health each time I shoot a mob.   That pisses me off so much.
---
100% fine with it. I want the devs to be able to make predictable balance changes so they can make said changes the best possible
---
Yeah, I was not happy about the charisma one. I was all psyched to finally share a level 2 perk and have party girl and inspirational on at the same time. So much for that. I'll probably replace that one when I start honing these perks.
---
Caca means poop in Spanish. Just wanted to throw that in there.
---
oh. then its even more strange :D
---
TBH it's unreasonably hard for all levels. I shouldn't have the fight of my life with a pack of liberators when I'm just trying to go buy some shotgun ammo out of somebody's vendor. It's ridiculous.
---
I lost about 15% firepower.. why was this necessary? Forcing me to shoot twice as much because they raised the hostiles' levels.
---
The ammo factory exploit would bypass the camp budget system and cause EXTREME server and client load problems and was devaluing ammo out of intended balance. It was also obviously an item that was not in the camp build menu, you had to purposefully do it.
---
The double wall was was just building two walls facing each other, using the camp building system as normal. We didn't even know it was a bug till they told us it was a bug. It was pretty surprising that it wasn't intended to allow us to do that.
---
Same with building walls overhanging roofs. Why would anyone ever assume that building a roof that's extended from their house like a porch roof and then adding two end caps to it to make it look like a real porch roof was a bug? The pieces snap to each other! To say someone using the house set to build things that look like normal houses is an exploit is... I can't think of a nicer way to describe it... boot licking.
---
True nuff- I heard west tek was messed up too and iirc west tek is a daily ops location
---
Edit: jk I’m dumb it’s not but I did read west tek was fucked up but also read from someone else they were getting more spawns at west tek- seems like spawns are a lil unstable in general rn
---
That’s what they get for fixing the line in the sand glitch
---
More reliable than a 20m westek clear?
---
I’m not saying their isn’t but with this old game engine I’m not sure what people expect it’s the same engine The elder scrolls games were made on. I use this as a comparison because I feel it’s appropriate.
---
When you fight a giant in Skyrim and you whittle it’s health away while slicing its knees you don’t question it being a sponge or why it’s taking so many slashes you enjoy the fight with the massive meat bag that can send you to the rocket with two hits.
---
That’s basically what fighting the harder enemies are like in this game high health/damage opponents that put up as good of a fight as you.
---
Also it’s not only junkies and bloodied that are only viable you can use nocturnal more effectively now on par with these prefixes now
---
Me no like squish food
---
What mutations are you running?  Because I don’t see Starched Genes.
---
Most MMO’s have a single player campaign, but these campaigns are usually in the game so new players can have a way to level up within the flow of the game. Wastelanders did a a more “comprehensive” story to Fallout 76. However, they’re trying to add more difficulty to an online multiplayer game. I bought the game with the understanding that it would be a Fallout Universe, where I would need my friends. 
---
Before this update, I hardly ever needed them for anything. Now, some of these older events have enough high level enemies swarming where I actually need them. I detailed in my post that what I said may sound messed up to new players. I’m really sorry that your experience has been diminished in this game. You have to understand though that being social in online multiplayer games, is kinda of the point. At the risk of getting downvoted again, maybe waiting for Fallout 5 or returning to many of the other Fallout 4 games would be a better experience.
---
As you said, being social isn’t really an option for you in this game. You purchased the game to enjoy the story mode, alone. Keep in mind that you’re trying to play an online multiplayer game by yourself. It goes with saying that it would be more difficult. If you played with at least one more person, you’d probably not be having as many issues. Again, I’m sorry but the issues your having seem very indicative given the way you wish to play this particular game.
---
I give it away for free if I don't use it.
---
Honestly almost all of my complaints would be voided if they just gave us a proper respec system that doesn't take an eternity. These could be so much more fun changing up builds if it were faster and easier.
---
U can stab 1hp mobs in daily ops Mr Rambo.
---
Mine is about the same, but then again, mine wasn't super optimized to begin with.
---
Oh I already know.  I've wanted a sympt-o-matic  the whole time.
---
Yeah, existing in different areas would account for why monsters are less organized or not as good as in other areas,the same as why human characters are stronger in those areas. It's bassically Gygaxian realism.
---
And, yes, there's clearly two different populations in this sub and who use the game. One is the group this change suits, because they are divorced from any role playing element and just use the game like a shooter.
---
Or that but that ganna cost you a lot more then you think.. after lvl50 any lvl you waste on rebuilding is less perk coin you can get for legendary perks
---
To further my point. 
---
Radroaches, crickets, rad ants at scorched earth. 
---
Gutsy's armor piecing rounds
---
Assaultron's spammed head laser
---
Daily ops Gutsy's armor piecing rounds and you have to take them down by melee.
---
This would make a great elder level reward.
---
&gt; PSA: It now takes no more than 4 caps to fast travel to a train station, from anywhere on the map
---
So... 2 loading screens still?
---
I tried that event yesterday with the robots, the new one... couldn't even get past the beginning. It was a death loop. Insta dying every. single. time. Kept respawning right in front of insanely powerful Gutsies. I ended up quitting. I was incredibly disappointed. My awesome bloodied MMG is basically worthless now.
---
Thank you ❤ I can say that one of the good things about the patch is that I can level up a bit quicker so I can finish up my build. I have another question as this is my first time using mutations. I have a crap ton of mutations and starched genes on. Some of my mutations are effecting my build. Is there a way to get rid of specific ones or do I have to clear myself of mutations and restart?
---
To put where ? Camp budget is the same and on this season board we have like 8 or more camp items. 
---
Some people can never be grateful for something that is free.
---
Not sure how a guitar strapped to your back breaks immersion but ok... you apparently never played NV.
---
The fact that people complain about yesterday's ops shows you how bad a lot of the players are here. The fact that they added a piece of content that wasn't braindead easy (still a cakewalk) and it got everyone up in arms bitching is just sad. I dont understand the point in wanting to play a game that doesn't seek to challenge you in anyway.
---
It really wasn’t even an issue but alright
---
I wouldn't expect that much but hopefully this whole C.A.M.P. underground shelter will cover that.
---
The resetting to caution without line of sight has always seemed to be buggy for me.
---
However since this update being a stealth build my stealth seems to be working better then ever.
---
Before patch 21 my stealth was alright then every update since 21 my stealth seemed to get more broken like being spotted into danger when I should and so on. then patch 22 and now I'm back to bumping into mutants and they don't notice me.
---
If you're issues with stealth are in daily ops thats because stealth doesn't work in them by design.
---
“It’s totally fine if you spec into these specific builds!” 
---
“Why should you be able to use a high level gun to one shot a low level enemy from the bushes?”
---
“Everyone should use the same guns &amp; build! Legendary versions of a high level fun gun that you love to use should be useless!”
---
“Being effective in combat your way is dumb!”
---
Feel like that’s most of what I’m seeing right now.
---
Anyone else getting ESO 'One Tamriel' deja vu?
---
&gt;The first is because this is long term solution.
---
there is no long term solution if majority of your playerbase has quit the game and your new player experience is so shit that you wont have no players...
---
Not sure why they just didn't nerf Magic, Bloodied, and Unyielding.  It would have fixed most of the unbalanced issues as well as fixing quality of life issues for the playerbase as a whole.
---
I’ve been wanting to build a new camp for about a couple weeks now but haven’t bit the bullet because of this exact reason (Good news is blueprints exist, but I’d need a ton of them just for the base)
---
Wait, we're not getting treasury notes from daily ops?
---
Damn..
---
I like it :) I might need to craft more D.cure now. Got Shell shock, Rattle something, bleeding stuff and what not. Can’t remember I was so much sick before. Have you noticed this?
---
Yeah it does piss me off, but bethesda fixed a respawn bug that i've had since beta, one that prevented me from respawning without fast traveling somwhere that required a loading screen first, so the game is playable for me (a bloodied build, but not minmaxed, I really choose the perks i want) to play without spamming stims and staying away from fights because i'm scared of dying.
---
yes, spamming alt is definitely a fun and engaging challenge.
---
maybe for my screws seeing as how I have to repair my stuff every other op.
---
I do agree with you bro but that nerf damage made a bit of damage to our weapons in general.
---
Except there's a "small" difference between 75 and 300 rad resistance :)
---
The same way everyone else does... player vending and / or the sub we are not allowed to mention here but begins with the word market followed by the number 76. But for your needs just server hop, search all the player vendors, server hop again etc.
---
Or if you REALLY can't find one the there is a quest in the burrows (I can't remember the exact details but you'll be able to Google it) which rewards you with the gutter which is a one star vampires assaultron blade - that would do until you get something better.
---
ppl in the pts forum vocald that. It's Bethesda who simply won't listen, because they are dumb. But now, that this system is live, they will see that enough casual player aren't happy and have to take some action
---
vampiric auto-tesla is good for sure. 
---
another alternative is vampiric plasma rifle in flamer configuration, this thing can tank final assaultron while destroying him in seconds (aim for head).
---
as of perks - dodgy + serendipity + ricochet + suppressor should be enough to tank anything even with full Uny armor (I am using SS though + armor backpack, it have high DR/ER) and at 20% health while flamer is damaging something.
---
Burrows server hopping used to be best with West Tek being a close 2nd, and it would still be that way, but because of the issue with interiors not consistently cleaning up and respawning enemies, there is no viable location or combination of locations I have seen thus far.  If someone has a location I’d love to test it.
---
Misc items
---
This sucks. I literally just picked up a Junkies vats one for like 400 caps. :(
---
how do you play with an energie weapon while having fun? my 3\* laser rifle basically breaks after 2-3 encounters even though I repaired it to 200%
---
I’m on Xbox bro. Add me I’m level 30. I need a Vet to show me the ropes. GT Trojanboieazy
---
Those perk point ones are the hidden gems. I used INT and CHR and could finally run full nerd rage, stabilized and battery not included without sacrificing my other points. Just be aware that the CHR one does not let you share perks you wouldn't be able to before, which stinks. I'll probably swap that with AGI so I can run stealth, action girl and adrenaline at the same time.
---
Do you have mods installed?
---
Not that I’m aware of I usually just play Russian roulette with mutations and radaway. you can use rad-x to suppress the effects of all your mutations though for a short time
---
Maybe try unequipping it exiting the game then equipping it again, though i feel it is broken now to
---
whats up with tesla???
---
Damn that's actually a pretty substantial QOL improvement, especially for new chars.
---
C.A.M.P shelters might increase camp budget (if not straight remove it) since this is instanced.
---
Ohh that sounds beautiful.
---
Hold onto it. They may make adjustments. Cross your fingers!
---
THEY DID WHAT NOW?!?!?! I haven't played in months but it may be time to hop back on.
---
It is. Lvl 8 scorched are now 15. Level 68 ghouls are now nearing 100. What took one or two pops of my powerfist to kill is taking 4-5. That means my weapon will break twice as fast.
---
I'm in the camp of this being ok. I think with legendary perk cards, regular perk card adjustment and armor changes it'll be ok.
---
What platform do you play on?
---
You bet your sweet ass I am. Level 278. I had to use a StimPak during Campfire Tales last night, fucking legend.
---
Not in Ops. Was trudging through the mire and running into the issue. Not sure how long it's been going on for.
---
Id rather pay extra for 1 less loading screen tbf
---
Regular bloodied but with stabilized and emergency protocols
---
Thanks.

Xbox

I dont use PA and this is what works for me: 
---
Rank up heavy gun damage perk cards and get Serendipity, Blocker and/of Dodgy, and Nerd Rage! Any DR boosting cards help; Bloody Mess is a must, and Radicool will give you +5 STR as a Bloodied build. Add Adrenal Reaction mutation with Starched Genes / Class Freak and Adrenaline if you got the points!
---
All of the above + UNY armor (preferably Secret Service) is what ive been running today, and tbh the nerf has barely affected my killing power! Melee weapons suck but my Bloodied explosive prime 50 cal and LMGs are still wrecking everything!
---
So far, just Melee, and it’s only in the daily op, and only sometimes, there are multiple different mutations that they can have.
---
Could you kindly explain what this prevents or how it stops someone taking say, three items? Genuinely curious, I'll admit I'm a little worried.
---
Nerd Rage, Serendipity, and any straight damage boost perks
---
I only see two non-bug issuess in this patch.
---
The first is stealth.  The way it works has always been dumb.  Half of the time it was bugged out in some way or another, and it was always overpowered when it was working as intended.  It's less op now but the game design problems remain.  My suggestion is to rebalance all "sneaky" weapons and stealth damage itself to be dependant on time and hit placement.  The combat advantage of sneaking, imo, should be simply to deal well placed hits while not initially being in any danger.  A stealthy bullet to the foot should deal little to zero bonus damage, but a sneaky headshot should be devastating (maybe a guaranteed cripple or crit?).
---
And bonus damage from stealth, aside from follow through's debuffs, ought to fade away over time on each target, as the point of stealth should be to ambush the target, not just to magically gain lots more damage because you crouched.
---
The second issue is level 50 enemies minimum at all times, even in the forest, for high-level players. It's just inconvenient and disappointing.  Makes things like farming tick blood a pita when it just doesn't need to be.
---
&gt;Quiet-ish, flat location suggestions welcome!
---
There's a decently sized area surrounding most of the train stations where enemies don't spawn. Plenty of flat space near Charleston, Morgantown, and Grafton, and they're in an area where the spawns are still capped at 50 regardless of your level, so you don't have to worry about level 75 liberators or level 100 bears attacking your home.
---
True - but you have to get to 50 first, yes you waste a few cards but honestly if it makes getting there much more do-able then you do it.
---
Remember we're talking about lower level characters - most of these are going to be newer players. I've got 5 characters, 3 up around 120...I don't get to play much but I've played enough to know what's coming up when I level, new players don't have that.
---
All of this is why I think it's important to remember that the trip from 1-50 is tough enough with low damage going to be much more common. I think a level 20 scorch for a level 20 character is much more scary than a level 70 scorch for a level 70 character, that level 70 has the luxury (usually) of a much better build with much of what they want to boost damage and probably at least a few legendary weapons/armour to help them.
---
Sorry, I must have missed the part where there are mutations for stealth rifleman. Eagle Eye is useless because im maxed per.
---
Nice board friend
---
too bad, on steam it would have been possible to avoid the second download. No idea for ps4
---
If We’re ever on the same time you can jump on my private world to play gt is dizzydeaths
---
Pain train? That exists.
---
Not in Ops. Was in the mire hunting mobs. Weird...I guess I'll just deal with it for now.
---
Just separate vendor stalls from our stash already holy shit.
---
I run 15 points on endurance, use all endurance perks that give more life. I typical one shot all monsters and walk around with 500 - 600 hp at any given time. I'm also running all sentinel / ap refresh armor. I used to never run endurance, but now I've seen all the positives of it in action.
---
I made an half stealth commando / half heavy PA explosive build and... I destroy everything lol. Seriously, the nerf is not bad for me, a bit more challenging and that is good.
---
*Choo chooooooooo*
---
We must agree to disagree. I think shotguns should be more devastating than automatics at close range since shotguns have a  heavier damage drop-off penalty. Playing a shotgun build requires you to get up close, so it's riskier. A commando build can just perch somewhere up high.
---
Veteran 3k hours and I love it too !
---
Serendipity,  dodgy , then ricochet/blocker for max survival
---
Now THIS is a fantastic idea
---
I like that I don't need to place my tent on the ohter side of the map to have a "hub" to get closer to areas to lessen the travel expense. Foundation and Crater are well-positioned to keep prices lower by being closer to your final destination.
---
samuel from the foundation sells the plan, you buy with gold bullion.
---
You should I save it I might
---
Only thing I think should be balanced is having the number of enemies based on the number of people participating and refresh them every couple of hours rather than once a day.  Once they add more types of Ops there will be something for everyone.  A lot of the hate I think comes from the weapon nerfs plus forcing people to change their entire playstyle (no stealth allowed) and adding it in all at once.  
---
Like for me.  I am (was) a Stealth Rifleman.  They nerfed the hell out of my build essentially forcing me into using Commando.  Now in Ops they took away stealth.  They also forced you in yesterday's to get into melee range.  Adding all that together for me means I will not touch those particular Ops.  I do not like being within reach of an enemy.  Period.  If they can reach me then I have failed.  I can work around the no stealth issue but it is still IMO dumb as hell to have all the enemies with Perceptive.  Some for sure would be great as a challenge and for different tactics but not every Ops.
---
If they add more types of Ops, for instance ones where they force you to use stealth and tactics then I will enjoy those.  The people who will lay on the hate for this type would be all the people that enjoy rushing in and not having to plan and think.  For these people, they can do the current type.
---
As for everyone expecting the highest tiers of rewards then no, everyone should not be able to get them, not without planning and work.  People are too impatient these days.  It will obviously be easier for people with friends or who are lucky enough to be able to use voice chat  in public groups but that is to be expected.  Solos should be able to do it as well, it should be difficult but not impossible.
---
unfortunately it's not possible :(
---
Imagine not violently exterminating players in the wasteland and needing to ask permission to kill them.
---
really? haha!
---
I love it personally
---
What if I was alone? Is there anything you can do?
---
Thanks for the advice
---
Would be nice if we could use bullion for perk card points as well like 1000 bullion for 50 or 100 points
---
Oh ok thank you very much
---
Still beat day 1 first time with no issues with my new legendary perk. Electric Absorbtion. :)
---
You can apply the chemist mod on the small backpack, no need to bother doing tadpole quests for it.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Small\_backpack](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Small_backpack)
---
They always have Piercing Gaze.
---
I posted this comment before I played the new patch myself. I definitely understand why they moved him now, considering everywhere you walk is now a war zone.
---
Every time I walked into Harpers Ferry pre-patch, it was swarmed by high-level scorched or ferals, so I could only imagine how bad it is now post-patch.
---
np :)
---
I added master infiltration for funsies. I got the special strength and agility and thus far used the added points to max up barbarian and Evasive I think it was. As a bloodied sneak I never really needed those extra damage resistance perks but with the map now full of higher level enemies that can spit and kill me, it’s quite nice to add them on.
---
Looking forward to it. Didn't get a chance to clear a silo last night.
---
Only in Uplink
---
everything involves piercing gaze I'm afraid.
---
Maybe they'll have a hide and go seek mission in the future for stealth players.
---
piercing gaze is a permanent mutation I think
---
Restarting the game seems to 'fix' it. But I'm unsure what triggers it, same as yourself.
---
They have said that in future missions it might be a different permeate mutation though.
---
By mission I mean how this one is up link, there should be different ones in the future
---
I doubt it. Only one can be placed and I'm not sure anyone would do that if it's even possible. Good luck to you though.
---
You're welcome to add and join me anytime. I should be on daily (save for the 18th-19th of this month) for the coming weeks while I grind out season 2. I run events, do daily ops, build, participate in nukes, and just generally wander around to collect supplies. 
---
I don't always have my mic on though, as my urge to talk to people comes and goes lol. Still, you're welcome to join and team up with me, I'll help with whatever. I'm level 103 so far on my new main. PSN ID is ToxicFluffle
---
Atleast you didnt tear down you camp, than two blueprints cant be placed because of a cant be supported bug, and have to add all the items you want to sell again to your four vending machines, and replace that one building to show off all the stuff you can build. I FUCKING HATE VENDING MACHINES JUST MAKE IT SO WE CAN SLOT STUFF WE WANT TO SELL AND IT PUTS IT IN ONE VENDING MACHINE ITS SO SIMPLE NOW I HAVE TO REDO EVERYTHING AGAIN but atleast I dont have to worry about my stash stuff being stolen cause THE BUG IS BACK disable ur vending machines btw :P
---
Ik it's not exactly 'free' but I leave my survival tent outside the Whitespring just to save some caps
---
Honestly I think this game has always had balance issues from level 20 until level 40 or so. The enemies just scale in power (especially HP and DR), much more quickly than players do... so if a player was focusing on exploration perks the game becomes pretty grueling in mid levels... one wasteland exasperated this issue because now you can't just find lower level enemies until your ready to take on mobs your level.
---
Nerd Rage, Blocker, and Serendipity are going to be must haves. Don’t turn your nose up at Chem Fiend either, to boost your damage and DR during fights. 
---
If you use Power Armor, get Emergency Protocols, but more importantly if you use Power Armor...Get. Electric. Absorption. In. Legendary. Perks. You won’t regret it.
---
Have a Vampire weapon handy for Resilient enemies in Daily Ops.
---
It is an interesting mechanic that encourages team play.  Ranger knocks the health down with melee finisher cleaning up.  Online coop games need some challanges to actually need teamwork.
---
I dunno, I’d love to see volatile super mutants
---
Oh gotcha, yea in the beginning their concept was that the map was indicative of enemy levels, Forest region is kind of the safe zone for fresh vault dwellers, and easy place to farm materials for experienced players. This level adjustment is really a double edged sword. Low level welcome it because they can walk safely in Cranberrybog, the happiness ends at level 50 and the struggle begins anywhere they go. Lots of players complained in the past that their level 20 toon can’t farm WS safely, now they get to enjoy it but aren’t quite ready to deal what’s coming after they’re above 50.
---
wait for lits 2.0
---
did the explosion really do 0 damage or is it just me ?
---
Most likely as ill have a totally different build in the next week
---
But you can cheese it with the same tired builds that cheesed everything before. Great design, Bethesda.
---
yes, for 100 gold each from faction vendors
---
Yeah, my no perk bloodied melee weapon did ~500 and now can barely reach past 300 damage. Lucky I don’t run melee when the nurf hit. I’ve been grinding for bloodied and have only gotten explosive, but I still do tons of damage and can solo the daily op in almost par time.
---
Ever heard of "punchline, setup"? :p
---
I felt nothing from them. But that might be because of fireproof r3
---
That's exactly what the complaint is. They *want* the mission to require zero effort.
---
"Creatures will receive one of the following mutations in a given Daily Op, in addition to “Piercing Gaze,” which will apply during all “Uplink” Daily Ops:"
---
Thats kinda the “problem” with the game for me, its a fallout that isn’t designed with the main fanbase as its target audience its a fallout designed around getting as many new people to the franchise as possible so it can 1. Continuously make money over a long period of time and 2. Keep the rabid fans demanding a new fallout at bay. Why make a new one when this one is still current?
---
I... shit you not 😁
---
[See for yourself](https://mobile-dictionary.reverso.net/french-english/caca)
---
Volatile will always be the easiest it really did nothing
---
Bloodied Legacy is still good, I lost just about 80 ish damage. Now it takes like... 5 shots to kill, but that's is daily ops which is all I've done
---
it takes more shots to take down the enemies but I found it more engaging and definitely more rewarding when you kill the enemies instead of one shotting them all the time period i launched a nuke on The scorch beats Queen and after going through the silo I died a couple times and I realized I have to be precise with my shots and not always relying on vats as the first shots usually missed
---
I like resilient one as melee :/
---
HAHA my BE Plasma Glatning go Brrrrr
---
Correct, piercing gaze is permanent in uplink. When we get another variant of daily ops we will see new permanent mutations.
---
Well if one did grant access to stash to buy stuff at the games set prices.  By having a 30k item would make the person not be able to clear the vendor out to then get to the stash.
---
Man zachy chan has it right though it’s online game can’t make everyone a god or no one will team up to do stuff. And it’s not only two builds I’ll copy and paste what I’m using and show you my build that allows me to two shot 80% of enemies with my level 35 two shot vats crit pump action?
---
That's a shame, so i have to create an entire new character then? I sided with the settlers and did the vault raid be4 i knew of this device.
---
I don’t think so. I hope they figure out how to save your spot on a server in the same way so you can re join that way. I’m always in a public team for grinding reasons so I’ve been pretty lucky
---
good to know. I already have the small bag. thanks!
---
Personally love the update switched to vampire weapons in my bloodied build now for easier daily ops im still doing good damage it just takes an extra shot or melee swing so it's not a big deal they pretty much needed all the overkill damage so it seems balanced right now
---
Its like i wrote earlier...alot of the most casual players that like this game for the same reasons as OP is gonna quit after this weapons "balance". They dont want or need meta builds/gear. But if it gets too difficult to even roam and  explore/collect recources they will quit, cant be good business for Todd.
---
I'm really happy as well. I have recently started a new testing character, just to do some initial quests over (still want to finish them on my main character and needed some context). It made me realize how fun it was to have a real challege, fighting enemies of higher levels with the little resources that you got, and how satisfying it was to finally beat them and become better at it :)
---
I took what they said in the Dev Dive to mean, during Uplink all enemies will have Piercing Gaze +1 Random Mutation from the list. From that I gather Uplinks default Mutation is PG and different missions will have different defaults
---
Same. Exact same situation. I'd be fine f they allowed us to build little ammo factories in our CAMP but now I'll spend most of my time hunting for lead\acid\and gun powder because all enemies eat my ammo. I'm done.
---
Edit: Just cancelled my membership.
---
Oh snap, learn something new everyday
---
I know, Had issues yesterday, first run I did today was a cake walk. I’d just love to see all the explosions though. From Muties rocket launchers and volatile, even the far flung fireworks. Just all the explosions
---
Im glad its noticeable all round, i love the scaling with every enemy its a blessing but levelling up does feel very very slow, OH WELL the pros outweigh the cons we can’t have everything :’)
---
I didn't even bother punching the level &gt;10 they just died to my AOE mutations,
---
There’s a mod for this on PC
---
So... only good when using an exploit got it
---
The thing is your bloodied fixer is still good. You just have to be prepared for other types of fights now. It’s add strategy to your build now. I have 1k+ hours and I love the update. Can’t wait till the BoS gets here with some cool shiz
---
I popped down to Flatwoods earlier for some snaptail to make sugar and as per usual I got a warm reception from the farm hands... thankfully they don't shoot 5.56's or else I'd have been a dead man. I never thought I'd see the day when I'd need my TSE Lever Action in the Forest...
---
well it’s new as of yesterday, so not much after it was released!
---
Anti-armor now outperforms slayer's. Max level enemies take longer to kill but they don't hit as hard as I remember. Daily ops in Vault 94 is fun, I run it twice solo and finished under 8 minutes both times without breaking a sweat. I'm lvl 754 in Excavator PA.
---
A weapon in your inventory is a weapon not being used. Armor in your inventory is armor not being worn.
---
You mentioned red dead but look at gta
---
No, you can still get max rep with the Raiders, have to do their dailies, you can still get the ammo machine.
---
Resilient + Robots is probably the hardest combination for ranged weapon users, which is probably the majority of the playerbase. Also the Blood Eagles and Supermutants are a joke compared to the robots.
---
Hahah! 
---
This is amazing, you guys made my day! 🤣
---
if your point is that this could change in future missions, I wouldn't be so sure considering sneak would trivialize the whole thing.
---
Yea, I did that, but after I got them down to bash damage, they were all grouped and I couldn’t run in quick enough without instant death.
---
Thx for the info!
---
Same here. This game has made most events un doable and unfun in solo. Whatever happened to making it so you could mostly play it solo as well.
---
A tip for all the players suffering because of this update invest on shotgun perks right now most shotgun with magic effects are 1 shooting lvl 70 and 2 3 shots lvl100 good luck don't give up
---
Now that'd be nice
---
Boss Hog?
---
Can't get a pick of it now, but the Gattling gun with the drum mag uses the box mag reload animations in PA regardless of skin.
---
Overall, good.  
---
But the mistakes they made had a heavy impact, but I don't think there are many.
---
The moment I saw the town, I thought it had just as much promise as Quincy from Fallout 4. The walls are fully intact, and there is SO much protection offered from pretty much any direction of the town.
---
I *really* wouldn’t want it to become a BoS settlement, though. As much as everyone likes them, I do not. They’re basically a much more organized form of Raiders in power armor with a ‘code of ethic’. Ignorant. Selfish. Conceited. Not compassionate or thoughtful of others.
---
I’d personally prefer a Free States revival, or even a new establishment for the Settlers. To each their own. This is why I love these discussions, because everyone has a different paradigm or idea. 😊
---
Almost level 400 ..and am just too gutted to even complain about the over1200 hrs of grind and caps thst I've put into a build, weapons and armor that's now piss weak and trash..keep watching videos of these Uber experts to get tips n tricks and make changes but it just doesn't work out like it does for them.. maybe I'm just shit at it.. honestly feeling very lost &amp; deflated with it, hope it gets better as it's like the only build now is tanky PA heavy gunner..the complete opposite of what I've enjoyed for so long..
---
I too want to start with a new character now that update 22 is out. Too even more challenge myself i plan to not use any legendary gear or weapons. My build is a pretty standard and boring Heavy PA Build but since i pretty much not use PA on my main EVER i thought it's nice.  
---
(main is a Lv. 276 - Bloodied Stealth Commando) and still can one hit a lot of the enemies :D) But they definitely hit harder than before.
---
Did you read my post I know the experience you’re looking for it’s what my fallout 4 plays like. I have weather changing mods that make it misty. I crank the raiders up to max with weapon mods like modern firearms so I there’s a wider arsenal of firepower fighting me then I’ll use raiders/gunners/mutants/synths of the commonwealth to change scaling so that they’re always on par or above as well as damage tweaks to ballistic and energy damage types
---
Also with things like Dark Souls and Bloodborne most enemies are almost as flimsy as you or weaker and then if they're a health sponge they're balanced by being slower. The difficulty in this update is entirely artificial with it only being tied to damage and health increase and lacking any nuance.
---
Yes but you still need to fight enemies with them, use melee hits to actually finish them off etc. If you could stealth the place you would only have to kill the last couple enemies, with well placed stealth crits. Everything else could be just sneaked by.
---
If you watch the dev vids, I think it was the one were they streamed fighting Earle live. They talk like One Wasteland and the damage recalc always walked hand in hand, and were two sides of the same coin.
---
Yea i knew that, but i didnt know you got the word "caca" xd
---
With the damage changes i’ve been buying up bobble heads and magazines to layer an extra bit of damage in, so it’s be possible i did
---
Ah you know reddit, if you don't submit to the majority they downvote you into hell haha. Thanks for being civil with me!
---
I thought mutations and enemies are randomized. I guess to your point they could have seeded something less annoying.
---
Apparently everyone kept fast-travelling to it thinking it was a station, but I never had that problem. Once I registered that it was a raided station, I never went there again.
---
I have not had that bug in months though. So I assume it’s not that important until it starts to affect a lot more people.
---
Actually its not that good anymore. You can burry bloodied weapons when a two shot deal double damage.  
---
B/25/25 fixer has pretty much half the damage as my TS/E/15r fixer, ah, and that is without demolition expert. However it breaks twice per silo run  
---
We will enjoy the new TSE meta while it lasts, because the damage is sure a bug. May never be fixed tho
---
That is a direct quote from the developers. It says Piercing Gaze will apply during Uplink Daily Ops. Uplink is not the only Daily Op, it is 1 of a few. If they had ommitted the word "Uplink" from their statement I would take that to mean PG is active in every mission but if we're to take them at their word in the article, they seem to be saying PG is only default in Uplink. Unless it has been otherwise stated somewhere and I've missed it?
---
I was a rifleman once.  Those days have passed.  Do you seriously expect a bolt action rifle to perform as well as a machine gun?
---
It adds the difficulty to daily ops, I like how they started off with that to get a sense of what we’re going to have to go through
---
Not to mention the burrows, if it was in valley galleria it would be much easier to navigate me thinks
---
I think the main reason was to remove some caps from players.
---
This reminds me of that episode in spongebob "P.O.O.P."
---
Oh I was just talking about the link you provided
---
Power fantasy is for people who don't like to play games. They're not diving into the experience.
---
It feels like a completely different game. I'm level 107 and I used to farm the shanty town in the middle of the dried up river near Charleston by killing the super mutants; I'd farm for .308 round and gunpowder whenever I was nearby. 
---
Anyway I tried last night and they're all level 50. To clear it out it took me at least 250 5.56 rounds. I have a stealth build, using a semi auto rifle usually, and my two-shot AR was only doing 60 damage when hitting their heads. 
---
To add insult to injury, my stealth crits just simply were not working in VATS and all the VATS bugs prior to this update are still prominent. It's all the more noticeable now with ememies all being tanks.
---
I have a persistent audio bug from the football table. Kinda like the gun fire bug at the SBQ! Anyone else on PS4 get this?
---
Get follow through legendary perk. It makes a big damage difference if your a sneak build type or do sneak attacks in general.
---
I dunno, I tend to have plenty of Disease Cures on hand. I think I had 14 in my pockets last time I looked
---
Same differnece
---
I got a 3 star lvl 100 charred ghoul doing monster mash, was awarded a 1 star stalkers board. Its going on the wall with all my pool cues and walking canes won from the Sbq and encrypted events. Happy Days
---
Yea this pretty much it FO4 was pretty good at it. The lower in the map you went the more difficult it became. 76 the same and I get opening the map up for low level players but now once you are past 50 there doesn’t seem like any “chill” place. Sometimes you just want to farm materials or explore some buildings. I already had to move camps because the mole rats I usually dispatched with a few shots from a revolver that spawned near by are now a serious threat.
---
I'm a level 237 shotgun build with a gauss shotgun and SS armour. I am little more than casual, I try to play a little every day. I am by no means some level 700 bloodied death machine.
---
But my first bit of playing yesterday, didn't really notice a HUGE difference. Fast traveled right into a level 100 Behemoth, somehow he didn't notice me, 4 shots and down he goes. Tried the daily OP solo, would have been one-shotting the robos, but for the melee kill requirement. Not something to do solo, I learned.
---
But other than seeing mobs being higher level, I am not finding anything all that much harder to kill. Maybe because my build isn't all that specialized, outside of being geared for a particular weapon and I took 5 legendary stat perk cards, again boosting me in a more general way.
---
I understand how this update would be harder for low levels, I am curious how it goes when my son (level 20-something) logs in for the first time. But I can see how the update would suck for lower level toons, suddenly EVERYTHING is WAY stronger than it was. Once you're level 100 or so, it doesn't really matter. But at anything under about 50, the world just got a lot scarier.
---
What if youre stealth doesn't work (not daily op). I cant stay hidden now. Sigh.
---
I was constantly getting lost today :) luckily I was on a team
---
I mean the point is to stay as close as possible, and you can watch the status bar update. Sometimes I was wondering if there were other ways to speed it up (solo), like moving back and forth next to it, killing more of the mobs? Otherwise I didn't find much confusion about it, despite getting blasted by a small army of gutsies yesterday and me only shooting them to heal. Today they were the pansy blood eagles that exploded. Tomorrow they could be freezing super dinguses. Even in a group where not everyone is staying close, this instance is not always optimized for melee anyway. Everyone was saying the gun bash wasn't working too great, but it was just as idiosyncrastic and fine for me.
---
They have changed their language to it applies to all “uplink” daily ops
---
I say it is your character and play it like you want. Run one of the two META builds and enjoy.
---
I personally believe a more balanced approach is also fun. 
---
I do small chunks of damage yet I run around in Vanguard Secret Service garb switching back and forth from my Vamp/Explosive 50 and my Furious Gauss Mini.
---
I go into a SBQ full health, fight for 10 minutes, Leave SBQ full health using 1 or 2 stims. Still manage to drop maybe 1-3 thousand damage on SBQ and loot multiple corpses.  
---
Same rewards XP and benefits as META builds, without all the respawns.
---
I ran burrows last night for xp. It's the same. I have done burrows a lot even before legendary board game. The difference now is the leveling calling means 68 ghouls are now higher and give more xp. Just go as normal and enjoy!
---
And you can convert down to diluted, but not up.  Get the full strength and a water and with Chemist you have 4 diluted for 1 full strength, plus you can super duper it for a possible 8.
---
Even if you are bloodied and need the lower concentration, you come out ahead, and that's if they half the reward and you get 1 full strength instead if 2 diluted.
---
Force casuals to quit, and only those who want to drop cash to grind with repair kits can compete. Even high end builds with the best gear are having trouble with gear breaking. This update wasn't to make the game easier, it was to try to force more micro transactions for repair kits.
---
It really needs to be done with other people. Best thing I figured after a friend joined me was to speed run to the objective, throw nades to take their health to 1 trickle then 1 hit them with melee to finish them off. Definitely nades help. I use Nuka nades with Demolition Expert tier 5. You might still die running to the objectives but if you clinch your butt &amp; grind your teeth hard enough, you might just make it! 
---
We never finished the event in time to get any rewards 😔
---
Oh yeah. Stealth armour doesn't work because of their increased perception 🤨
---
I feel like something easier should have been put out for day 1
---
Eagle Eye also increases critical damage, not just Perception.  And when you say you’ve ‘maxed Perception’, do you mean at 15?
---
- Marsupial for extra carry weight and maneuverability. Could help you get rid of Thru-Hiker or Travelling Pharmacy which frees up some points. (side note, backpack mods could help you get rid of the other one as well.)
---
- Speed Demon for maximum speed reload and movement, *even while sneaking*. 
---
- Grounded, assuming you aren’t using an energy weapon?  Because why not have +100 ER?
---
- Herd Mentality. +2 to all stats all the time. That makes a nice difference in a lot of areas 
---
- Carnivore or Herbivore. Why wouldn’t you want the ability to double the bonus from your preferred food buffs?
---
That’s SIX mutations that benefit a sneak ranged build, either directly or indirectly.  Faster reloads, movement, greater tactical maneuverability, bonuses to stats for more carry weight, HP, AP, XP, etc. More energy damage resistance. Higher bonuses from food buffs. 
---
*But, yeah, there aren’t any mutations useful for your build.* 🙄
---
\&gt; My suggestion is the mobs should only be leveled up to you after about level 20 
---
I don't think it's the level scaling exactly that's the issue (some mid level players are also struggling)... it's that enemies gain too much HP and DR as they level relative to players.
---
As someone with what sounds like a very similar playstyle to you on a higher level character (125+ I actually can't remember exactly what level I'm at currently) I'm sad to say I don't think it will get much better unless they make some major changes or make One Wasteland optional or something. Even if you manage to be able to progress, it just doesn't FEEL like progression anymore. I was pretty underleveled when I first placed my CAMP in the Toxic Valley region, and it really felt rewarding when I got the point where I could one-shot enemies that I used to have to sneak around or get decimated. I've still been able to hold my own, but it feels like a massive step backwards. 
---
It's not even a matter of being too difficult, it's just that everything feels so, so tedious now. Since I made my "build" based on what weapons and perks were actually enjoyable for me to play rather than the meta, there were still plenty of areas and enemies that were a challenge for me if I felt like challenging myself. But most days, I just want to log on and have a bit of relaxing fun exploring and knocking out some dailies. Events like Tea Time and Feed the People used to be my favorites - they gave decently useful if not super valuable rewards, and they were easy to solo or fun if a larger group gathered, and a quick way to complete an events-related daily. Now those events and every other part of the map feel like a slog.
---
I do get that some people were getting bored and wanted more of a challenge, but it just feels like the kind of thing that should have been optional. Or just create a new character and/or work with a less optimized build or something. Either way...I'm really not having fun anymore, which sucks because I actually enjoyed grinding out the first season quite a bit and was really looking forward to this one.
---
Damn. That is shitty. Thanks for posting though. Hopefully others will read and store their vendors
---
Someone else posted about the same issue earlier this morning. I can't recall what system he was playing on, but I play on Xbox and luckily haven't had that bug show up yet. Have you tried scrapping it (vs storing it) then rebuilding it, and seeing if the big went away?
---
Nerd rage is still multiplicative so it’s not that bad. My bloody build still kills scorched in one shot and 2 to 3 on other mobs.
---
They may have disabled it because if a glitch with it causing people to be able to get 100 strength
---
I understand your pain.
---
As a level 209 wood armor main, who is using legendary wood armor pieces that further improve survivability. And now after the one wasteland update i'm getting smacked hard by some level 50 weak feral ghouls...
---
Feels bad man. Hopefully bethesda will make the game a bit easier for low level players again. Like it used to before the One Wasteland update.
---
if someone thought the game was to easy its there fault they are the ones who like 90 % of ppl use the same build basically and the same guns basically
---
you want a "challenge " pick up a pistol and go full health the game has no balance for builds or guns thats why they are all the same not because they want a challenge but because they want to be strong, they want to kill things fast and move on
---
Yup.
---
Shitty
---
I killed a rat on my way to Uranium Fever that took at least 1k damage before dying.
---
you're reading too much into it. I doubt piercing gaze being the chosen permanent mutation is merely a coincidence.
---
and the reason being that sneak would trivialize daily ops. imagine uplink, but with sneak: run to point A, use escape artist and a chameleon set to stay hidden until the timer hits 0. repeat. maim the boss with little to no resistance on their part. done.
---
Yes my Bloody fixer is down from 1800 to 180, added with the higher level enemies I am using a ton of ammo and fixing the gun constantly. I like that the game is more challenging but detest that it is creating more grind.
---
New player, currently at level 14, can confirm that it's discouraging and not fun. I played for a little while today, tried to do a side mission where I needed to go look for something in a house in Clarksburg. 
---
I've already been through Clarksburg and cleared it out a few times. But today just the first few feral ghouls on the outskirts were a huge hassle since they were all the same level as me (I think before the update they were around level 5), and as soon as I got closer I had a few robots shooting the hell out of me and wrecking me before I even knew what was going on. 
---
After a few minutes, almost all of my ammo was gone and even if it wasn't half of my weapons were worn out and inoperative. So I ran away from the town and logged off.
---
The two guns hit the hardest for me are my Gauss mini which went from 407 to 224 and my plasma caster which went from 524 ballistic and energy damage to 302 ballistic and energy damage. My other stuff doesn’t seem to have been hurt much. (Except for melee, which I’m not specced into and pretty much just carry so I don’t waste ammo on trash mobs, ‘course with the ammo factory legendary perk that might not be much of an issue anymore.)
---
They better not nerf it
---
Yes. It seems to me that certain enemies are just not dying in one hit when they probably should be. I experimented last night on trying to kill levell 100 Super Mutants, some legendary and some not, and it usually took two or three hits.
---
After doing some optimizing, including using sneak, I was taking then down to a sliver of health in one hit (in vats) but then the health would bounce back up to ~10-20%. It really seems like they *should* be dying in one hit.
---
Has anyone come up with a surefire way to kill them in one hit?
---
Instigating on a stealth sniper isn't optimized.......if you say so.
---
Plus you listed off 5 characters. Most ppl have 1 and are sub level 200.....
---
I got initiate on my first attempt. I think it’s more about being annoying than too difficult but point taken.
---
Nerd rage is still multiplicative. Tell me if you find anything else that is.
---
I got like 10 berserkers in a row yesterday, honestly, it was so random I don't even care lol. I'm also having fun with it, and completely agree that the enemies don't feel like wet paper bags anymore.
---
Personally I think they should have made one-wasteland a Toggle.
---
Worked fine for me on PC except my character disappears while the iron pumps itself. Still get +2 Strength for 30 minutes.
---
I was wondering the same thing. Hope they fix it soon.
---
Are people still calling seasons a battle pass?
---
ESO also has more then one map.
---
I agree 100% you can tell me that the people who have designed all these cool power armor skins etc. were happy with their hard work just becoming an atom shop skin. I should also mention I enjoy this game its fun it has it ups and its downs but the main reason I’m still salty about this game after all this time is its like bethesda promised a ride into town on a bullet train, when i got there i found out there were never any plans on making a bullet train at that station, disheartened i began to walk up to the normal train on its normal tracks, still fine just a bit let down, upon boarding i find out that the ticket bethesda gave me was actually to a steam engine thatd be pulling up an hour from now
---
IDK why you got downvoted. Yeah, they're asking for something like Pain Train, but it sounds like they want it without running, and without it taking up perk slots.
---
Rad rats are no joke
---
Same, this update has to be one of the best
---
The issue it's the damage alone, it's the massive blast radius in combination with the high damage.
---
Radrats always have been bullet sponges. Laser rifles do trash dmg, would recommend using ballistic guns like  hunting rifle
---
I hopped on yesterday to see what it was like and I burned through my .45 ammo so quickly. I stayed on to complete the "Kill creature" weekly; I joined the Swarm of Suiters event and ended up just shooting each Mirelurk once and letting others kill them cause I just didn't have the ammo to finish the job. My stealth build feels completely useless and with no simple option to respec I don't see any fun in playing.
---
Yeah tried that. Even had more people come to my camp and try it out: all got same audio issue. Have to log out to remove the eventually horrendous sound. Some how picked up the black screen bug as well after patch 22. Never had that one.
---
I heard it clears diseases. Camp item.
---
Is EA worth it at level 1?
---
I only 5 slots at the moment (222) and went for funky duds instead .. which I sort of regret doing daily ops but not in the bog, already swapped out The Ammo one for taking one for the team... basically made bad choices.. bit like life really!
---
Nice XD
---
I did a Mr. Messenger event about two weeks ago, it was in the divide just at the base of ski slopes to Top of the World...easy right? The mob spawns that attacked were all Yao Guai...every single one. 4 mobs of about 5-6 yao guai. That was the toughest event I've played yet in this game, worse than any SBQ fight, worse than Earl.
---
The only saving grace was that they were a bit lower level than I was at the time...next time they'll just rip me to shreds...going to be interesting.
---
Keeps getting better.
---
It's quite a rare drop, don't know the exact number. It is a camp item that heals diseases
---
True true but like i said it was just a thought nothing more nothing less
---
I have a background in training, learning, and development with a focus on UI.
---
I ran a few daily ops last night with randoms who didn’t understand that they were supposed to be in close proximity to the uplink. With a mob full of Gutsies hammering down their health bars and smoke grenades going off, the small text at the top can easily be missed.
---
Even a simple banner in the middle that says you are contributing would be helpful.
---
I get what your saying and I had a bit more fun too but the scaling up of enemies has a direct impact on resource management, ammo production, armor repair, etc. Spongier enemies = more resources required. In turn, this could skew play time from combat to constant lead or steal or ballistic pouch runs just to stay serviceable. Would be nice if they buffed drops for ammo, etc. Otherwise we will be chasing scrap instead of scrip or tnotes.
---
I am a level 350+ player and I completely agree. I did not have a perfectly optimized build - I had a build that allowed me to be a jack of all trades and play with all kinds of different weapons and styles, and that is completely ruined now. Frankly, I have the perks and the high-end legendaries to cope with the new changes, but it’s not fun. I don’t want to be forced to play with one particular gun all the time. Not to mention, the legendary reward of Ammo Factory seems largely negated by how much ammo is now required to function. Basically forces AF as a legendary perk instead of it being a choice or a high end reward. 
---
I know I could get my build optimized for maximum damage, but I don’t want to - I enjoyed being able to play casually with all kinds of stuff. I never did as much damage as an optimized bloodied build, and that was ok. Now, it just makes the game tedious.
---
You can wear them down to 1 percent health with a ranged weapon, then bash them. The problem is that you have to stay near the transponder, because if you move away from it  then your time  suffers and you don't get the elder rank.  You will often find yourself standing next to the transponder and being shot at from a robot 20 feet away.  If you move to where the robot is so you can melee kill him then your time suffers. The only real options are to spam stimpaks or to use a vampire ranged weapon. I use my vampire Gatling Gun.
---
This. Stealth rifleman especially, particularly with VATS still being broken.
---
I'm not though. I'm hardly reading between the lines. I'm taking what was said at face value. You're saying sneak would trivialise things but that is speculation. I'm using the Devs own words to inform people that Piercing Gaze is specific to Uplink. And since nobody has played any other Daily Op, can you show me where a developer said PG will be a permanent mutation for all Daily Ops and all missions? Not trying to be an ass. Just going off of the information in front of me
---
I started a new character last night. Specifically because of these claims. My 2 other mains are 150 ish. 
---
Hit level 16. It was an absolutely more difficult, but also enjoyable experience. 
---
I ran a good ol' serrated Machete and pipe gun through the first chunk of levels, with crafted leather armour. 
---
Loved it. Couldn't just waltz through encounter after encounter. Fled a fight or two. Much more tense. Made sneaking more fun, like it actually mattered. 
---
I like difficult games. I like a challenge. I like being punished for stupid decisions. 
---
The early game experience, and dying 3 times, was a nice change. 
---
I went into my main to run some daily ops, and My bloodied rifle build felt much less satisfying as I murdered robots a plenty in tandem with a bloodied DCG.
---
Ohh I did hear about that actually. Probably a common reward then since it didn't seem like people were too pumped for it
---
Yes. Ammo factory is like committing a murder and your beloved stack glitch is a petty theft. Don't matter how you sugarcoat it, theft is a theft. Don't expect anyone outside your building circle to respect your exploiting
---
build it at your camp to heal diseases. [this shows the datamined droprates](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ite4rn/daily_ops_guide_and_datamined_complete_rewards/) (idk if there are other lists around)
---
The solution shouldn't be exploit a bug....
---
Yeah annoying is a better term
---
Because he's a good boy.
---
Shotgun build? At this point I honestly can’t tell if my shotgun is magic and the decent VATS damage is what’s bugged, or if everything else is broken and the enemy HP when it rubber bands outside of VATS is showing me the real damage numbers. The lack of consistency and the lack of knowing is most frustrating.
---
How's it working out?
---
Makes it feel lore a chore tbh
---
I got the liquid courage plan in my first time doing it , I did it solo n took me little over 10 minutes witch not bad at all I think 😃
---
So I never liked railways in this game and then I got a furious explosive vats chance railway. I learned the automatic piston which is the only gun the does higher damage with a mod instead of prime. That thing is amazing. Is good give it a try, get the piston mod for it and you will love it
---
Fed76 is utter and complete trash. Do yourself a favor and never visit that site again.
---
It’s strange because the term battle pass is accurate, but a lot of the challenges don’t require any combat
---
Power fantasy is literally the reason people play RPGs and work to become powerful. I don’t understand your “diving into the experience” comment at all.
---
They broke stealth with wastelanders, no clue if intentionally.
---
Btw chameleon armor does nothing for stealth unless they changed that in the last months
---
My first drop from daily ops was a 1* Stalker's Shovel, I won!
---
Guys that’s too many thumbs
---
I wish I could agree, but the game has become easier for me. Originally you'd step into an area and half the time lvl 68+ mobs spawned because done high level was nearby and the difficulty curve was a rollercoaster.
---
Now? It's all smoothed out.
---
Running out of ammo? Do a sneak melee build. Or just melee in general.
---
Power armor breaking? Repair it at a station silly! What's this repair kit nonsense?
---
Look man, things are different but complaining won't change it. Shit or get off the pot. I don't know what else to say, you're not taking anyone's advice. And everyone who doesn't agree with you gets downvoted.
---
Edit: Downvotes to the left I guess, Better you all be salty here than take it home with you.
---
Yeah today's daily op was so much better. Was able to solo elder the first time I went through it.
---
I am a casual gamer and play this game 3 or 4 times a week.  It seems like the game is a time sink now.  Grinding for everything.  I liked having the easy zones to run around in when I wanted and the harder zones when I wanted a challenge.  I guess I may put the game down and look for another.
---
Get a room 😂 
---
SBQ is still a joke even after the damage nerf
---
I’m running around with my bloody build still 1 shooting scorched and 2 to 3 on others.
---
The only big difference is mirelurk queen and the other mini boss type mobs.
---
Magic and hacked weapons is pointless to use when you actually know how to make a build.
---
In addition now there is follow through legendary perk which is a big damage buff.
---
I also still see people in ops one shooting mobs with their melee weapons.
---
Don't expect to get all your ammo back for free
---
100% (as is Funky Duds so don’t regret that!) literally stood on top of the offices at the Radio Array and let a laser gun-wielding super mutant shoot me and recharge my fusion core and health. Then I stole their life.
---
What's that perk got to do with food build?
---
I believe berserkers is more risk than bloodied.. and therefore deserves more damage.
---
Its basic economic theory...
---
The melee modifieres are the worst
---
I’m loving it so far. The challenge is much needed.
---
by itself, no instigating is not optimized. I would do more damage as a bloodied sniper stacking the bloodied effect with adrenal reaction.  Instigating is only extra damage on the first attack. With the changes i’m not 1 shot killing enemies, it’s taking 2-3 shots to kill things, more for legendary or bosses.
---
But i’m still doing fine.
---
And my number of characters has no impact to the discussion. legendary perks aren’t shared, it’s not like all the extra coins from my 200+ character we something could spend. She’s no different than any other level 52 out there with the gear she has found and over time traded for.
---
Welcome to online games. Metas change. Build viability changes.
---
My bloody rifle build was not fully optimized pre patch and the game was a breeze. Post patch it's more difficult but still only requires a few additional shots on most enemies.
---
Love the train set. Plopped the nuke lamp on the hill above the capital building for aesthetics.
---
I always get about 250 at the end+ those what enemies drop.
---
I like it . It’s weird but you and the people like you are the new pvp community , it sucks to be the minority
---
EXACTLY dude its just all over the place i love it but I’d say I’m definitely still not satisfied with how everything is going
---
english is not my first language so forgive me if I butchered it, but that's my point. you can't take what they say at face value. *it's not like they're known to bs us or anything*.
---
and it's hardly speculation. with uplink specifically, you could literally just run from point A to B and remain hidden while waiting for the timer. that's infinitely easier than dealing with the resilient chaos head on.
---
Kind of a stupid mutation if ask me considering the points charge faster with everyone on them but someone has to run out to kill these bots....
---
That's also shitty lol. Ty for updating me though
---
First time running through the daily after an 8 hour download and I got blessed with a Handmade v/e/15v.
---
Railway rifles can be fun. I have one that I made auto to use with my bloodied commando. It hits like a train but its useless outside of VATS because of the recoil. Also, being auto, I spend a lot of time reloading it (only holds 10 spikes). The choo-choo is quite amusing though.
---
Furious may be useful if you can keep it on target. With things taking longer to kill, I could see Furious getting some love.
---
Thanks, I’ll see what I can swap out, or I’ll grid out 78 levels ASAP
---
You don't even need an OP legendary weapon. 
---
My LVL 45 1* Bloody deathclaw gauntlet still tears up enemies. Just needs a few extra swings.
---
I know but it's the only solution there is at the moment for those with the nerf issue because no matter how much we complaint about it bethesda is not going to revert the update I'm just trying to give some info that could help other players enjoy the game again
---
[Current Build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=96655be&amp;d=su2sg2x92x72x50x10xq0sd0so0sp0p02pc2pq1pe0eo2eh2c72ck0i12ib4as2a04a32la2lr2lv2lu2l71&amp;m=051c9f)   
---
I'm not having a heck of a lot of problem, I'm a bit more squishy, but it's not particularly overwhelming. Main weapon is an executioners Gauss Shotgun, I'll switch to an instigating lever action when I'm conserving ammo. I still have a weightless anti armor deathclaw gauntlet for when I want to forgo ammo and switch around my cards to do unarmed.
---
Also annoying is that when you are in PA frequently it is impossible to switch to your other favorited weapon. Nerfing the damage isn't fun either,  lost 15% firepower...
---
What they said.
---
I know! I hope they dont adjust this.its a solid power armour perk.non power armour already has some solid perks too.smh
---
the term is power creep.
---
It happened in Everquest, it happened in WoW, it happened in Rift, It happened in Anarchy Online, it happened in Guild Wars, it happened in Planetside, it happened in Lineage, It happened in Dark age of Camelot, it happened in  The Old Republic, it happened in Neverwinter, it happened in .......
---
Every RPG goes through this that lasts past the first expansion.
---
I use antiarmor because I don’t have to do anything other than shoot. I have a lower level power armor heavy gun build and its a lot of fun. I feel like weight isn’t much of an issue since heavies with bear arms weigh like 2 pounds.
---
Edit: I should add that unarmed is an extremely fun build. I prefer using instigating weapons and switching to executioners if need be, but from everything from punching ghouls to the SBQ, I had a blast using it.
---
Survival Shortcut.
---
grants 1 unique chem each 30min's up to 5 in total. 
---
Satisfies Hunger 100% and Thirst 200%, removes all Disease and restores Health.
---
Even without any upgrade, this Legendary Perk gives you more of this Chem then you'll need. no need to eat or drink anymore except for buffs.
---
They just want to play 1st person sims and that’s why survival was eliminated
---
I don’t see why they wouldn’t want them repairs, it doesn’t pause the clock. Though i can see not repairing so all the mole miners funnel to a single extractor
---
Ohhhh that makes more sense about why I didn't know
---
Yup. Like, I'm supposed to be a tank.  This is a tank perk.  Leave it that way.
---
If you say so.
---
In your eyes your setup/situation is similar to when you first played the game before hitting level 50?
---
They are directly comparible?
---
No clue. The mole miner Legendaries spawn faster if their repaired so their just idiots.
---
If their just there for exp then there are better alternatives.
---
To OP ignore them and play regularly.
---
I figured but the daily rewards are tied to the account so I was hoping otherwise
---
The soyboy writer at bethesda has too much empathy to write something creative for the lore  other than secret evil robco general atomics military experiment#321414123 cliche
---
To become powerful and being able to one shot your way through the entire experience are not the same thing. 
---
Go play FF6 and use the Vanish Doom combo, tell me how fun your experience is. 
---
Talk to me about why people play RPGs lol.
---
Inplay RPGs because I want to immerse myself in a setting and story. I want to be challenged during that. Not to waltz through the experience with ease.
---
I love how your reply is less than a minute after the post, showing how long a Google search doesn't take.
---
I'm not sure if it's still happening, but the Chameleon armor prefix and Escape Artist kept breaking sneak when they're equipped together. Not sure if that's still an ongoing issue...
---
Thank you for your intelligent and well crafted argument.  You truly are a team player.  Instead of being the douche who says “get gud” or “shut up and adapt”, you see how short sighted this shift was.  I don’t see this lasting long with players
---
^right as paximidag said, 3 maxed Rifleman cards
---
RIP the dream, I pumped iron 10 times before my daily op yesterday and really enjoyed the extra 40 melee damage
---
Yeah for the first daily op ever you'd thing they would want to ease us into it and give us a bit to figure out and have fun with it, but instead every op I did was a deadly shoot out in the sewer hoping not be be overrun
---
This has probably been said but the daily op requires no ammo to be sponged
---
Food build is Fallout 76 term for casuals. Not someone that goes around eating stuff
---
&gt;ZedNott\_
---
How about we have the game balanced instead?
---
So Anthem, which has tons of problems but I thought was really fun to play, has a lot of mechanics like this and that's exactly what is done in that game. There is a colored area that you need to be in to get the bonus for multiple teammates being near the objective.
---
They could have added a way to use stealth in order to sneak up to a terminal to disable turrets, or turn them against the mobs for example.
---
But they are right o prevent it from being a way to just instantly sneak to the main capture points.
---
What is happening? When I logged in after the reset today I had "melee kill/burrows/robots". After completing it and getting elder rewards this changed to "melee kill/vault 94/robots" and again I could get elder rewards. After a while this changed again to "exploding/vault 94/blood eagles" and it was shown on the world map as "not completed". But after doing the operation I got no rewards as now it showed that I already gained all rewards.
---
Is there any intention of lowering the healing value for the perk?
---
Should i close my eyes as well when i play? maybe tie one hand behind my back? 
---
Jesus fucking Christ, do you guys even read the shit you write?
---
I did say its ALL easy. No matter what build you use the game is fundamentally easy. If you take a weaker weapon it doesnt make the game harder, it makes its lengthier. There is a difference even if you don't understand it.
---
Especially with a lot of these quests that require lots of back and forth traveling, it’s just annoying. The cap rewards usually don’t even make up for the traveling costs either
---
Cant wait to do it agn and beat my first solo time :) but then agn i am a psychopath
---
Ah sorry
---
Did you watch the video I linked?
---
Yeah like I'm finding that every encounter is just a pain . I'm a sneaky sniper type but cos I'm level 40 and not fully finished my build is a little weak.  Plus my gear is somewhat under leveled. So I'm finding its taking 5 shots with my sniper to kill anything. Even scorched and gouls and of course I'm getting bum rushed the moment they see me . Meaning I have to switch to a close range or faster firing gun . Which I soon run out of bullets for . And then my armour gets broken and I run out of stimpacks. So I'm there finished with the collection of gouls ,down most of my ammo , pockets filled with weak under leveled weapons and no gears or screws to upgrade them . And then the dreaded [caution] sight perks up and it's back to the grind . 
---
It's really killing my enjoyment of the game . 
---
Hell I struggled to beat mole miners before but now even mole rats are a concern . 
---
I've all bit given up protecting my workshops as that's just a complete recourse drain and a slog to beat the invading creature .
---
Pa is great
---
Fuck all is it means nothing
---
At least you got weapons, I keep getting armor pieces.
---
It also makes the rando factor a pain because what of you have a whole team of ranged builds? Wasn’t a problem this morning because I started on my Unarmed toon but good lord
---
😇
---
did they fix the wrapped cap?
---
Yes. Missing six consecutive hits with rank three Concentrated Fire at 95% is just unreal.
---
Guided meditations solo all over agn
---

Well you need to pay monthly to get that. :/
---
I think is worse having to pay real money.
---
Wow nice!
---
Nah they can’t think of their own creations so they just use old assets *cough*cough* ‘BOS’.  But literally creating the region specific factions in FO76 but just going “oh they’re just dead now.”
---
Once a day. If you miss the roll today then you have to try tomorrow. Playing 8 times in one day won’t work.
---
I have full set of unyeilding secret service armor and 3 pieces with sentinel.  DR is insanely good now too, so with the armored backpack I’ve got about 600 DR and I agree ricochet is great esp for the robots.  I can tank the assaultron boss with 1 point into born survivor and just focus on shooting.  If anything, assuming you have the gear, bloodied is tanking than ever...
---
&gt;Why do you feel that it was sensible for Super Mutants in the Forest to intrinsically and invariably be drastically weaker than Super Mutants in the Mire? How does that make sense within the world or the lore?
---
This hasn't changed.  Super mutants are still weaker ( level 50 max) in the Forest vs their cousins in the Mire.
---
on pc, im just fine with randoms, maybe try that too
---
Ya that’s the only reason I can think of but I still find it pointless imo.
---
I've not seen what the other missions entail yet, I may have missed an article somewhere. Sure Uplink would be infinitely easier if PG wasn't active. But presumably we don't know much about the other missions so we can't say for sure what to expect. My point is that the use of their word Uplink seems to be quite deliberate and I've not seen a reputable source claim all missions will contain PG, only Uplink. But as I stated, I may have missed something so if there is an article out there or datamined information that I may have overlooked I will happily concede my point in the interest of ensuring I don't spread misinformation.
---
I died in my T-65 armos like 10 times. Bravo Bethesda. Loved the ammo drop though.
---
It seems about 11 am central, when the Daily challenges reset.
---
I think it's only 80% the first time you get elder on the op, subsequent runs no longer have the chance.
---
OK, going to mod it and give it to my Bloodied Commando. Take it for a spin and then go ask Earle what he thinks of it - figure a bigger target should help with the aim.
---
Yeah and most who play the game are ranged builds
---
I would say probably the END one for sure since the Unyielding doesn’t boost END. Don’t know that you could use any of the other stat ones because it says they cap at 15.
---
Can you post what damage cards you had active, was the weapon legendary and if so what type, as well as if the shots were close, mid or long range?
---
I’m trying to gather as much data as possible. Thanks.
---
I totally agree with you on one shotting everything. Same page with ya. But, there should be zones where you can go and feel god like. If everything is difficult, then what are we building toward with our power levels? Why are we playing? Just for new cosmetics? Know what I mean?
---
i do agree for one simple but major problem, you have to LEAVE the hold points to kill enemies. maybe in future modes, say a horde wave, it will work better but in this mode it's actively penalizing the players just by existing "well you can lose time for the better rewards to kill us or waste stimpaks to heal up all this damage we're giving."
---
This shows had bad the playerbase is.
---
&gt;useful. It sounds like a lot of people were counting on being able to stealth everything. Here's something you can't stealth.
---
Stealth is more than just "get around things without being noticed". It's for damage, and also only affects the individual, not the group. Most people run PA Heavy. 
---
The idea that stealth is used for stealthing things in this game is hilarious and quite naive.
---
&gt;And do you know why it's disabled for Uplink? Because stealth would make Uplink ridiculous.
---
You do realise there are other ways to deal with this other than making a build un-usable...yes? 
---
&gt;Would you like the event to simply present you with a "success" button? People are talking about this like they want the game to be broken in their favor.
---
No no, I get it. You just want people to not be able to do a thing on this game because the devs are too stupid to figure out a way to make it so stealth still works but someone can't just sit afk on the points.
---
T65 with EP and a VE Gatling gun, don’t have to kill everything, just the marked enemies.
---
At least u got 8 mumble rolls
---
Yea actually the very first thing happened to me after the patch was exactly what you described. I walked into my camp and a molerat jumped in my face, I took a shot at it and went to sort my stash. Normally a single shot from a gatling is more than enough to handle a level 10 molerats. Not any more, this level 60 rat didn’t die and bit me in the ass and killed me lmao. There really isn’t a chill place any more and maybe this is more ‘realistic’ in a wasteland setting. From level 50 to the level a player can make a shit ton of ammo for their good weapon there is a big gap, and most players fall right in there.
---
Ok thank you! That would make more sense.
---
If I remember correctly they are working on interior camps for a future update. I don't see it too far fetched of an idea they'd have vault like objects if they did this.
---
Daily ops are awesome, just wish the chance for the rare rewards would increase, I’ve been grinding and barely getting any
---
I was able to solo the Daily Op today with just TS armor....it's a godsend.
---
i've never heard of that term yet, tho i play since early beta...
---
It's good to be home.  
---
It's weird that certain sections are blocked off or outright removed, but all the same, I am so happy to have it back that I immediately moved my tent back into its old spot.  
---
That said: fuck the Mirelurk Kings that live in there. I didn't miss'em before and I don't miss'em now. Innsmouth-lookin' bastard!
---
Same happened to me, after already doing "melee kill/burrows/robots" and "melee kill/vault 94/robots" with full rewards it changed to "exploding/vault 94/blood eagles". But I got no rewards for it even though it is shown on the world map as "not completed".
---
Oh nice, that sounds interesting,  I'll have to look into that
---
have a  feeling that down the line they'll add  some meme faction like the  responders back or something just so they can sell us a responders bundle or something
---
"Hey, your build isn't usable, so here is a tip: Run a completely different build". That's you. That's not a tip. 
---
LPT: Water is wet.
---
There is nothing wrong with balancing the game.
---
If a side effect is that things take  longer because of it, that doesn't make it automatically bad.
---
I consider the game better from the nerf since enemies like level 100 deathclaws,  are far more dangerous and intimidating.
---
Everyone i know outside reddit likes this change.
---
Why should they consider players who don't like the change over players who do like it? There needs to be more substance to the argument other than "it takes more time" or "I invested more time than other players".
---
Every standard you present is based on opinion and has nothing to do with actual balance.
---
The game doesn't feel any more grindy than it did before the update since i am leveling up faster and i get more rewards for killing higher level enemies which guarantee me level 50 legendaries since the reward scale up.
---
In the end i will end up getting my items faster and my rewards faster and leveling up faster.
---
The fact that they scaled rewards up at all completely destroys any chance you had at convincing ANYONE the game was trying to be more grindy.
---
So you do only have a chance at getting a rare reward once a day? Or only an 80% chance once a day? And what about the uncommon?
---
I’m not a sneak build just a bit easier doing the challenges heh. I’ll get through them with my usual tactic of just running in swinging.
---
Overall though I’m loving the update.
---
That’s actually a very good weapon.
---
Yeah I just got the plan 5 mins ago and it’s per character.
---
Prolly some dumb idiosyncracy, but they did modify it for the ops cuz i got lost at the end the first time and thought i had to find a door upstairs past where they blocked a side that is open during normal burrows. Turned out i had to thru the more cavelike part lol
---
Well, if you’re doing no damage, I think there’s an issue with your cards. Do you mind sharing your build with me so I can see about helping you out?
---
Yes, after taking, quite literally all of your perk cards. It's not significant if you have to invest everything to use them, and you're left with nothing. 
---
Specials are pointless.
---
Ty for the official term name
---
Go with the opinion of the crowd,
---
All those upvotes, oh so proud!
---
Say what they don't want to hear,
---
Then it's downvotes for you, I fear.
---
Opposite. I always start roleplay so ppl wont join and they still do lol
---
Can’t handle the girth?
---
For some reason it didn’t reset the same time as daily challenge
---
The rewards should have scrip, gold and notes on rotation. 1 day scrip, next gold, next notes. Something like that would be beneficial for everyone.
---
Are they not here yet? I've not had time to explore but I thought the brotherhood were here now, otherwise what's the deal with daily ops?
---
Player-owned Instanced Shelters will be here in 10-13 weeks I think
---
Yep, made that mistake the first time trying uplink, i thought being in the same room was enough, but nope, it's a smaller area than I originally assumed.
---
Whatever you heard, food builds don't have anything to do with consuming stuff specifically. Think of it as a QOL centric build that don't min/max. Like carrying much stuff, building stuff, charisma builds that benefit teams, and so on
---
these fucking wolves in the black water mine that somehow have like 2k health, fuck them
---
It’s a precursor to the interior instances, ur camp can’t handle it yet but in 10-13 weeks you’ll have a big underground room to put it in
---
Also ignore the mobs when you’re on the move from point to point.
---
You can play daily ops as many times a day as you want but once you unlock each tier you can no longer get the rewards for that tier. So for example if you play it three times and unlock each level progressively you get the same rewards as though you played it once and unlocked them all in one shot. That's how it seems but if it's wrong and someone knows better please correct me.
---
Ty for the unfortunate news amigo
---
&gt; from a relatively close distance
---
In CQB range the damage drop off due to distance doesn’t come into play.
---
If you can try taking long range shots both in and out of sneak I’d be interested in the outcome.
---
You're not alone!  Logged in yesterday and went straight to the new Ops, solo.  Took me 39 minutes with my commando build.  Thousands of rounds of ammo.  Broken guns left and right.  Vampire's handmade was my only way out.  Still fun, sort of?
---
Damn. Thank god for speed demon cause I am running away from them like a little bitch.
---
without spoiling too much, there's still someone left
---
Some players don’t even give you the chance to revive them. As soon as they get downed they kill them selves.
---
I pick up bottles, oil containers for my molotovs...at Crater/Foundation and many train stations. Always have dozens on hand to tag enemies.
---
I started equipping the basher perk and bayonets for the resilient enemies yesterday, never thought I’d see myself actually using bayonets with my commando build lol
---
I had 1 with me the first run and had 2 people with me the second run but I was doing most of the killing one of them was speed running the objective,  the other was just finishing them off with melee
---
They should make sub level 50 players to take 50% less damage.
---
So at least people would still play to 50 before giving up
---
I kinda wish they have a bit of free caps
---
Tbh I would genuinely like to see a resurgence of the responders or at least what could seem as a new version with wastelanders doing the tests and tasks to become a volunteer. However having them as a primary faction something similar to the brotherhood would feel off. I could see them as a faction helping others so they would be more of a medical unit instead of a fighting force.
---
It has nothing to do with real item values. Even the creator has admitted that the prices don't reflect the correct prices people use to actually buy and sell. The numbers you see there are very VERY rough estimates. Prices are decided between buyer and seller, based on demand and supply, not some stupid outdated website.
---
That was a good one, Beth. Now can you please increase the daily and total limits of scripts, gold and even caps? Also increase camp budget and stash capacity and fix the atom challenges bugs?  Most of players struggle with those bloody limits. :(
---
I am hoping we get some nice damage adjustments with patches as they stated it will be easier to do with making all bonuses additive.
---
My idea is to make damage perks scale differently to incentivize maxing them 
---
1 star 5% 
---
2 star 15% 
---
3 star 30% 
---
Would make for more actual decisions when picking perks
---
Its dumb to let extractors stay dead, then you run more risk of failing.
---
Could you still get 1 elder reward and uncommon ones though?
---
Just logged in for the first time in a few months. Was this patch the one that nerfed/fixed the Gatling gun firing rate in 3rd person or did that happen awhile ago?
---
I’ve had massive lag spikes to the point of nearly unplayable. On PS4 as well.
---
What ever weapon you have equipped is what ammo you will receive. 
---
When you end the mission with Gatling gun and leave you get it’s ammo.
---
If you kill the boss with the Gatling gun and switch to another weapon you will get it’s ammo after you open the score screen.
---
Gatling gun is amazing in there. I get 10 to 60 ult ammo per kill. It’s a insane way to farm ammo. Currently at 11000 ult 5mm
---
So does that mean you couldn't get any rare rewards after that? I assume you could still get uncommon though, right?
---
also,  let me clarify the "soyboy writer part"
---
Just look at how BoS were essentially potrayed as total nazis in fallout 4 because ???
---
look at the railroad, what a dumb fucking faction that was.
---
Think of it what you will,  to me it just seems they are going to end up making the BoS into the enclave
---
Last I looked mine was 54 hrs and climbing back up to 99+... who knows maybe sometime tomorrow?
---
Great, thanks - I’ll compare mine but I defo don’t have bloody mess or demo expert equipped.
---
However, your legendary armor effects don’t translate into PA effects.
---
I got them all day one and still have perks left, not a big deal if you're high level
---
I got into a group of three last night with two dudes mid 600s level and we ran half a dozen in about an hour. Wow. I can now navigate the burrows blind.
---
But the first red dead redemption online did have gambling or the gambling games. :o Why RDR2 doesn't?
---
Yes the whole point of nerfing damage was to make sure you don't kill enemies as easily as you done before, thanks for stating the obvious.
---
Don't see it as a bad change since all weapons even weaker ones did too much damage and the enemies were too easy to kill.
---
If you don't see a difference in challenge make a fresh character then come back to me.
---
You will be whining it's too hard cause you will have to deal with more of the game mechanics than your used to.
---
I feel for you. I played last night and while my main character took a big hit in damage output, like everyone else, he's going to be fine.
---
Tonight I'm going to try a few of my characters I'm less sure about. I've got a pistol medic I'm pretty sure is going to get absolutely cornholed and a berserker rifleman who may not be able to output enough damage to offset the aggravation.
---
Imo archery should be a free perk you get in your first 10 levels and just let them suck . Then buff the fat man to where it should be
---
Also the damage they do is laughable. In previous games, when you found a Fatman launcher, you were OP as heck and no one could stop you! You in PA and a Mini Nuke launcher, you felt like you were an unstoppable tank of destruction and devastation!
---
Check the [patch notes](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5cRE8qhGB6BrOuJBnPhNGO/fallout-76-update-22-patch-notes-september-15-2020).
---
Hint:  It’s not legacy.
---
Ugh.. I shotgun the roaches, the nope-nopes, the 'oh-gawds' and the "WHAT THE HELL IS THAT!?"
---
So far, I'm learning tolerance for the roaches.  The mega-wasp is another story though.
---
yeah we call this kind of build "PvE Pensioner"...
---
Probably just the same voice actor, like how that guy collecting junk at Atlas is the same voice actor as the raider punk.
---
You're better off throwing on the SS armor during daily ops. Stealth is literally impossible since all ops have the Piercing Gaze mutation.
---
What??!
---
you're not spreading misinformation, I don't think there's any official source indicating that piercing gaze will be in every mission. but I was making a point that maybe you're relying on their statements a bit too much, specially considering their track record is far from spotless. I mean, it took them months to 'officially' acknowledge magic weapons. they clearly don't have our best interests in mind. you'd have to be extremely naive to take anything their official reps say at face value, half the time they don't even know what's going on themselves.
---
what's more, it'd be really hard to design a mission in which sneak is not an option, but without blocking it through piercing gaze. because with escape artist and chameleon, you literally just have to crouch and done. you could be sprinting with a Mr. Gutsy on your tail and he'd instantly lose you. but even then, if they did manage to come up with a solution that didn't outright throw sneak out the window, then it's still not that much different from piercing gaze, is it? because they'd still be making things harder for sneak builds on purpose. bottom line is that sneak does trivializes daily ops, for better or worse.
---
Right. I used to carry a revolver with explosive on it and that was enough to take care of most annoying little bad guys. Clear out som ghouls mole rats etc. now it’s not even worth having on my. It has to be a heavy gun which I have but I don’t feel like spending all that time farming steel and making ammo. Just a frustration. I’ll give it some time I Suppose.
---
It's not about doing damage, but about staying alive. Go defensive. Stimpacks, drugs, food.
---
I enjoy it. Would like a buff to range for snipers, but all in all it’s slightly more enjoyable.
---
Are these results in close to mid range? Ie inside of West-Tek?
---
In sneak or out?
---
Have you tried an longer range shots both with and without V.AT.S.?
---
No scrip or cap limit increase either. Shame.
---
Rose Sounds like the same voice actress as Moria in FO3 I do believe. Meant to be Annoying and Nasally to set the tone correctly.
---
There's already a stomp animation in FO4 if you kill one with a crit or vats with melee. It would be cool to see it in this one
---
It's a damn good effect.!but it's not legacy just yet..there was a change in the damage scale so some say quad might ne more sought after along with anti armor and some others .quad because of the large magazine size...
---
Some people just can't be pleased. By the looks of things a lot are giving up, which is good for this sub as it won't be constant complaints about something they couldn't do themselves. They didn't make the game and aren't putting out anything of similar quality so should either keep playing but shutup, or stop playing but still shutup. Either way there's too much complaining about something that they couldn't do anything about themselves.
---
It is difficult to imagine my sneaky toon, as I'm swapping clip after clip in an ever-increasing mountain of spent shell casings.  &lt;no one can see me, just empty another clip&gt;
---
Put on medic perk, shit saves all the randoms
---
You can also earn Possum points by doing the Campfire Tales event and Stings and Things.
---
Bows use the same SPECIAL as rifles, so you can easily respec into commando or rifleman without losing perk coins.
---
Yes. Just remember to claim stuff like caps and gold on the character you want that stuff to go on.
---
Ok yeah some kid on Xbox told me that their friend sent them a screenshot from their pc of patch notes saying you couldn’t get it anymore but wouldn’t send me the pic thanks for the info and I’m about to send this to them right now
---
Try the ops. Seriously. I was absolutely swimming in ammo and meds last night by the time I was done. Don't go solo, join a public team. I think the ops are what they were talking about with increased ammo drops because it was crazy. And I wasn't even using a gun! I had my hammer
---
No we call them food build and survival shortcut perk don't give them depression
---
That's good, u pull trigger and bullets come out
---
&gt;You shouldn't have to sneak for a rifleman build to be viable.
---
 This.
---
or use V.AT.S.
---
I heard that mission was bugged for more than a month and I completed it like few days before players got the bugs. :o But what happened?
---
Shhhhhhhh
---
I hate that I can't chill in the forest. Does everything have to be an epic battle? WTF!? level 50 tics and bullet sponge super mutants. The One Wasteland part of the update sucks.
---
My issue are the rewards. Why would i waste 500 or so rounds on a 2 star enemy only to be rewarded with a 1* assassins rolling pin? Buff enemies,  fine.  Nerf damage, OK. Leave the reward structure intact,  no thanks.  I skip events now not because they are hard,  but because they arent worth it.
---
I ran full health commando for 255 levels. Switched to bloodied and love it. During the queen or earl I just run half health to i dint die. Its easy to manage and makes the play a little more exciting.
---
Probably a similar story for Heavy. I use a VE handmade a lot to.
---
I’m normally at mid to close range in sneak. Have also done the same out of sneak during ops.
---
I’ve done some non-VATS long ranged too, which seemed fine.
---
Seems basically fine so far.
---
Nope, and believe me, I lubed up.
---
Only Gatling gun can get more ammo then you use on kills from what I seen. 3 shots to kill something then you get 10 to 60 back. 
---
I use ultracite ammo. I started with 9000  and ended with 11000
---
You get a chance to get the new plan/outfit rewards only once a day per rank. Repeatedly doing daily OPs after completing the elder rank will only give you grenades and the random legendary reward
---
I know about this! I'm super excited for that as well :)
---
Its like a lot of other changes and fixes they made on this game, it's should've just been like this at launch
---
That's what I'll do eventually. I'll transfer perk points from another SPECIAL to Charisma and use that legendary slot for something else. I just wish I'd have known that before I invested in 3 levels of the legendary Charisma perk.
---
Yeah I got the vault 94 stash again today, hate rng.
---
Depends on how you play it. Bloodied damage is still up there as the best itself but you can’t use that damage if you keep dying as a glass cannon.
---
The Queens were originally in the Atrium and the Strangler Heart used to be a boss of sorts was part of a section that's no longer in the Vault.  
---
I suspect having people walk in to meet two acid puking Queens would've turned'em off pretty quick to the place these days, so they pulled them.
---
Ive been talking to a few different people that use varying builds (omg not all bloodied, ikr) and they're doing just fine. Its got less to do with that and more to do with how far along the spectrum they are, since they evidently can't adapt to change very well.
---
Maybe.  Instanced interiors would have to be huge to handle it.
---
That's kinda painful to read.this last patch really gimped the rifleman class.i would try and go with commando it's the closest thing to rifleman ..its really your call but a bloodied or junkies hell even a anti armor fully auto rifle would do you well.i only use 3 damage cards for commando since fully ranking them up doesn't really make it enough damage
---
Just got super reactor plan from daily ops its huge nearly 2 and a half times the space of the fusion reactor, and needs a really flat open space to look right, so I was sad when I realized it only made the same amount of energy as the fusion reactor 100 energy anyone else think it should make 200 for being twice the size or at least 150
---
I understand where you’re coming from where they hated everything non human or anything to far of a mutation.
---
With the railroad they just seem like a crackpot faction barely doing what they think is good with nearly killing the synths mind with the wipe. 
---
With making the BOS into the enclave it would surprise me with how the recon leader who has been dispatched to Appalachia sounds she already seems like an extreme dictator making her team into somewhat of a brotherhood outcast group.
---
I'm not exactly in need of ammo myself, I just crafted 2500 ultracite plasma cores yesterday
---
I really like it too, makes doing the events I'd normally ignore (Back on the beat, Tea time) worth the time from the exp of the enemies I kill. Plus Daily Ops is great and Im liking the legendary perks system.
---
Currently a bloodied stealth commando but the new patch has me wanting to switch, plus I'm getting burned out
---
And here I am unemployed and hiding from a deadly virus while jonesing hard to play Tony Hawk. Wink wink. Lol.
---
gotcha. I’m still trying to find my playstyle. Usually i would have low health and charge in, but i’ve been hanging back in fights now
---
Must of been nice not ever having to move a single point the entire game.  Guess you just let someone else figure it out for you then took the cookie cutter and punched it out.
---
And that game still happens in the creation engine with the same mob design with non existent AI and broken pathing. Like i said, not in any bit harder, just lengthier, means now instead of having to spend 10 seconds to gather the resources i need to kill the mob, i need to spend 25 seconds. I understand the difference can be complicated to simple minds, but it's there.
---
"Hey, I'm gonna be an asshole and complain about your suggestions because I only have half a brain and nothing better to do". That's you.
---
Seriously like what is wrong with you? This is what worked for ME. I had 3 totally useless cards in my agility tree, because, like I said, stealth doesn't work. So I suggested 3 different cards in Agility to replace them with that make surviving a hell of a lot easier.
---
So you can't even get uncommon plans from multiple runs?
---
Thank you for the kind words friend. I just want to see the game thrive and grow. Hoping more people will realize this in the coming days. 
---
I may take the time to put together a video essay as well. Never done anything like that before, but I feel it may be necessary.
---
I have said this every time it comes up, berry mentats should make corpses glow blue. It’s already in the game files.
---
haha I was basically doing the same, wow this lever action isn't doing shit, pulled out the gatling plasma to mow down regular mobs.
---
I agree they should add even harder mode since a lot of players keep saying the game still isn't challenging still.
---
On the upside to the damage output nerf, we have the incoming damage nerf. I hardly have any survivability perks and my gear is mediocre at best, and I no longer get ripped apart by Mr. Gutsys or Super Mutants with miniguns. I feel like it’s a fair trade, but that’s just me. I can see understand both sides of the coin.
---
That’s true. Ammo is really easy to get now especially with that new leg perk, but I was just stating it was possible to gain ammo then lose if you run with a particular weapon.
---
wonder why they can't use at least some sort of voice changer so at least they do not sounds too similar lol
---
Cause my girlfriend got a lights plan and a posters plan yesterday I'm confused as hell haha
---
Also raise the damage cap from 110 for pvp so they can be viable, semi auto shotguns and melee all need that raised for pvp
---
Nah you’re good man. You’re only missing a tiny bit of DPS. It really only makes a difference in boss fights. Even then, if your squad is built right, you won’t notice a difference.
---
I’ve done a bunch of queens since the update and haven’t noticed too much of a difference overall. PvP-wise, nothing has really changed either.
---
You picked a good time to come back. The game feels really good now with lots of shit to grind.
---
Damn.now in that case I would read the patch notes!I know that quad doesnt drop on certain things anymore..check the notes though I wouldnt be surprised by anything anymore at this point
---
Yes, correct
---
Different voice actress. Fuzzy Brenda has the same one as Amethyst from Steven Universe. I don’t think Roses has been in much aside from 76.
---
See vault 88 in fo4
---
Aliens
---
Nice, man
---
Shame you're on PS4.
---
It's just a Covert Ops debriefing. Move along, nothing to see.
---
\&gt;  With making the BOS into the enclave it would surprise me with how the recon leader who has been dispatched to Appalachia sounds she already seems like an extreme dictator making her team into somewhat of a brotherhood outcast group.   
---
where is it mentioned?
---
you don't have a sense of scale, do you?
---
Bethesda could.fix the mobs by making it easier to cripple them.
---
You just need a decent build
---
My ts limb dmg double barrel is still op, should try to find one of those
---
Mine are on a third floor at the top of the monorail by watoga and spawn on the ground
---
You understand that it's not lengthier overall since you get rewarded more. 
---
More experience, garunteed level 50 legendaries, more junk,etc.
---
They have made progressing through the game even faster, you can even use legendary perks at level 1 from your alt characters.
---
Your entire argument is dumb.
---
Not if you got elder on your first run. 
---
Each rank has a percentage to get one of the new items. You can technically get 3 of the new rewards after a new run, but it's highly unlikely. 
---
You only get 1 reward per rank per day
---
would love them to do that but im not holding my breath
---
Hahahaha .... I'm not saying it was aliens ... but it was aliens.
---
Haha, yeah I’m a full health commando and I died so many times it was just funny 😆
---
Oh shit man I’m sorry that sucks
---
Wat? XP is nerfed in daily ops. It’s crap. Also global xp is nerfed so a level 100 enemy gives less than it used to when it was level 50+.
---
that's all well and good but there are builds that require exclusive setups.
---
"lost duplicate perk cards"...can you elaborate please? Ive seen other posts mentioning this as well, but how did/does losing perk cards work and how would i know if I lost them?  I had many duplicates of many cards, some i even had it where i had a level 1, 2, and 3 for certain a perk, just in case i wanted to try something different.  I also dont understand peoples complaints about respec either. My main has been All Strength ( Heavy, shotgun, and melee), had him all Perception as well (Commando and Rifelman) at one point. I didnt lose anything, that i know of. Now i am playing as a Commando build, which just means i scrapped all the other " build/combat" cards that i have used previously. So i still got the coins. Does that make sense? Where in the process did i lose perk coins?
---
All this complaining from new players makes me want to reinstall and start from scratch to show everyone how it's done. 
---
Couple tips:
---
* Craft Fire Axes and scrap them until you get the armor penetration mod for them. Then make one for you level. These things do MASSIVE damage with power attack headshots. you'll be one to two shotting max level ghouls. Power armor will save your butt while in melee.
---
* Heavy weapons are where it's at. Gatling Lasers are garbage end game, but in the mid game they are great. very easy to get fusion cores and you can get a lot of mileage out of them. .50 cal is amazing too but ammo is more difficult to come by early on for it.
---
* You should absolutely prioritize at least one set of combat perks. Just go with 2h melee and power armor for now. It will carry you until you get access to better weapons / perks.
---
This^^^^ 
---
And if not a Google search takes about 0.3 seconds to load. I don't think some people understand the internet very well.
---
You might as well go full health since the SPECIAL point dispersal favors a higher health build.
---
Nooooo! I loved collecting them and leaving them around my Brother's camp, I thought it was way better it was misspelled.
---
Played that event 100 times, never seen people do that.
---
Eh true. At least it is free
---
OP, I would go with this suggestion, yeah, you're going to have to grind it a bit, but say you're currently 15 in Perception, you would just need the necessary maxed out cards (either rifleman or commando, 3 max on each), concentrated vats on 3 and tank killer on 3, there's your 15, and say you have none of those cards yet, it's 15 levels ... opposed to doing another 84...
---
Really hope they don't.
---
See these types of glitches worry me, I haven’t tried any out on players camps myself but I’m wondering if someone might attempt the photo mode glitch to get in
---
Thank you, i def did not want to waste 30 levels to change my build, i do like it. The last time i played was when human NPCs were added in. Technically i last played during that whole gameboard type thing that went on.
---
Switch, use a vamp gun when low health, or all the time.  My bloodied does about 40% more than my vamp, but vamp still shreds
---
From my experience since legendary perks launched,  this is 100% accurate.
---
Top dogs before, are still top dogs now.  Not just because of gear anymore though, but because we didnt waste our perk points to jump back and forth between different builds all the time.
---
If you were smart enough to keep your perk points, not waste them, then you are still sitting at the top of the pile.
---
For example.  I am sitting at lvl 413. In my entire career playing, I switched perk points around once (went from PA to Commando) when I was around lvl 140.  Havent touched them since.  Because of this I was able to max out 4 of 6 of my legendaries, with the remaining 2 at 2 stars each.
---
Did bloodied get nerfed.  Into the ground.  But I can still one shot headshot Supermutants with my lever in sneak.   Commando takes 5-6 shots instead of 2-4.
---
The difference now is I can jump into PA and throw on a heavy gun without having to swap all my perks around.  The added bonuses from legendary perks also helps a lot.
---
Endgame has changed, its now not just what perks you have, but what legendary perks you have, and weapons seem to be normalized,  no weapons are considerably better than the rest now.  Bloodied is still on top, AA seems to be running second.  Quad is more sought after now as well.   I did a bunch of tests with a bunch of fixers and found that Bloodied does about 15% more damage than the next in line which is AA.  Its not double the next guy like it used to be, but still top dog, and still viable.  I didnt have a furious to experiment with, but i tested an Exec, Bloodied, AA, Vampire, Mutants, and Mutant slayers.
---
You have to be smart about what you do now, its not just vats, dead, vats, dead, vats, dead like it used to be.
---
Basically, if your not running around with capped legendary perks, full SS armor, and top end guns, your not endgame yet.  Which is most people that play.   This is normal for online RPGs.  Only the top 1% stay the top 1% when a massive overhaul is done.
---
As long as you're doing dailies Bethesda is happy that's all they want is players logging in daily
---
And can take a ghillie skin if you have it
---
I agree. It feels like I can go back to exploring instead of just grinding the same old spots.
---
In fact, just took out some level 50 scorched at the Wixon homestead lol
---
No worries, I was just pointing out that they are basically the same thing from what little we know from the devs during their development.
---
Saying the damage recalc is mutually exclusive to One Wasteland, is the same as calling level scaling or the increase in mob levels mutually exclusive.
---
As far as we know, they are all pieces of the same puzzle.
---
How long till I get board this season?
---
Legendary perk coins would be useful too.
---
The point of one wasteland was so every one was more or less on an equal playing field. If they reduced enemies levels for a higher level player, that enemy in turn would die much faster thus leading to issues that were had before the patch. You are basically asking for a revert for certain players who aren't happy about the changes and I doubt they will give it to you.
---
I’ve tried AA on a few ranged rifles but I don’t have an AA lever action.
---
Have you tried and longer range shots?
---
If only he knew his radio was on.... He might still be here today.
---
God roll bro
---
Bloodied isn’t dead!
---
Check your build, perks and legendary perks you probably need a bit of fine tuning
---
Thanks for the response though! :)
---
Sure you can just drop em the stuff to scrip
---
also,  from what i  know, BoS doesn't kill sentient ghouls, might change  with fo76's character's seemingly low knowledge of how ghouls work  (in vault 79  raid you can convince on of the secret service agents  to shoot their ghoulified  engineer). The rest of the  things is  completely justfied if you ask me.
---
You're gonna have to learn how to actually play the game now =0 
---
bloodied still does more damage than any other build. adapt.
---
I had a 9 hour download and then did a uranium fever
---
Ammo factory 4, take one for the team 4, electrical absorption, power armor reboot, legendary strength. Loving it so far
---
I’ve been getting a mix
---
Thanks. I still want to try for Junkies but this one is still probably my best so far.
---
Hes showing you the source and answering your question. What a shit post.
---
Someone showed me how to do one way in the silo and I’ve been wondering if there’s any players that use to get into camps.
---
Sure, it's just much less dramatic now. A level 50 Super Mutant in the Forest does a meaningful amount of damage to a 50+ character now, whereas before a level 10 Super Mutant might as well have been a mole rat.
---
It is. I think people think I was being sarcastic tho
---
Gauss shotgun with blocker armor?
---
My sneak commando used to do upwards up 2k damage. Now I’m lucky to get 500-600 with Adrenaline fully stacked. Pretty crazy but still the strongest damage output that we know right now.
---
I think Vampire’s, Junkie’s and Quad effects will slowly become the meta.
---
Is two shot double damage now? It never has been double it’s always been less I thought
---
Only the best from Todd himself 😋
---
Correct
---
Better than another bad weapon
---
Bloodied is far from death mate. Maybe yo should consider keeping your shotgun for close range and combine It with an automatic rifle for medium and far ranges
---
I appreciate what you're saying. You're making all valid points. I took my question to the dataminers anyway just to see if they could shed any more light on this. It seems Uplink is the only mission in the files and nothing else has been added at this point. Even the people with close links to the development team haven't seen what other ops are in store. But there are a couple of unused mutations that haven't been advertised publicly yet so that's new information at least. The consensus seems to be that we simply don't know what is in store and there is no confirmation that PG is permanent in all missions. The points you made highlight a problem with sneak and it would of course be overpowered in Daily Ops but until the Devs say more, the conclusion is that there is no concrete information the solidifies either of the points we're debating. I hope you're wrong, I hope PG isn't in every Op and I hope they find a way to implement it without making it too easy. Hopefully we find out more soon.
---
Some bloody don’t wear PA because it makes them over weight due to backpack reducing weight and plus on food or chems from its mods.
---
Not to forget the extra str from unyielding
---
thx and PLS Fix this Fast Travel bug
---
It's really anoying to  "travel" 3-4 times before it works.
---
It's not a revive so it doesn't trigger revenant but it's super good like a secondary auto stim
---
Idk what you’re doing but for me weight is the only issue with my heavy gunner. Now that I got ammo factory I had to lose 2/3 points of a heavy gunner perk just to be able to run
---
I am genius
---
Yeah. Lever seems to hold up pretty well at long range. I also have a hunting rifle and a gauss rifle that seem to do great.
---
Oh, from what Ive been able to do so far, 100%. Is why I was so bummed to not be able to play for very long... Been playing 76 since Beta and have enjoyed seeing the gradual evolution of these game. Seeing level 50's in Flatwoods was a bit of a surprise, though... Lol. Well, swing them everywhere, really... Nice to get level 100's though, the challenge has somewhat returned. 😊 This new resilient enemy type is also good, throws a new mechanic into the same that finally makes use of all those weapons with improved bash, lol.
---
Oh wait, let's do the math here.
---
I now need 3-5 times more bullet to kill the same mob, but that mob only drops 1.5x more items... Oh an wait. Does it drop the items i need to make more bullets? no, it doesnt lol.
---
Yeah if youre doing really bad after this update it's you and your build not Bethesda lol I'm a pvp guy with a sent assassin leather set and the game is still easy in pve when I switch in some pvp perks for sneak2, covert op3 and (that one rank card that helps enemies lose you) it's just as easy before update just a few more ammo
---
Oh I do exactly that. Well aware of the Piercing Gaze effect the enemies have. I'm just talking about regular PVE.
---
Remember the game is more balanced now than before the update! So we are almost there! 
---
If they balanced weapons more around fire rate we would have a winner.
---
Cant they locked the door on me
---
With the right loadout, you're literally tankier at low health than full health.
---
good
---
If they did that, we wouldn't be able to buy caps, which you know they want to implement in the future.
---
Oh so you can't admit there's nothing wrong with the double wall or hanging wall they patched out so you're back to the only one that was an obvious exploit, the flamethrower glitch. Fair enough. I'll live with people thinking I only have columns supporting my two level balcony because I'm a bad person.
---
Reading the comments below and I think a lot of people are missing the point that West Tek is supposed to be a dangerous place.  I think a lot of people leveled up very fast, perhaps too fast and now they are over level 100, but really have not acquired better gear.  You could mow through enemies, because you outleveled them.  A non legendary level 45 or 50 weapon destroyed those level 10 mobs.  Now those level 10 mobs are level 50, which is the same level as your gun,  so you should be able to take them, but not super easy.  
---
Now you go to West Tek, and those SM are level 75 or 100, which outlevels your weapon.  So in order to compete,  you need to add those legendary effects to the weapons,  or min/max the build, or stockpile Stimpaks (This is my method of choice)  I added some runs into those level 50 mobs to collect the stimpaks that I will need to use at West Tek.  I do NOT have a magic gun, and I am NOT going to fall in with the Bloodied glass cannon build that is, or at least was the meta.  I still use my sneaky sniper rifle build. 
---
I have NOT found a good instigating sniper rifle, so I have to shoot shoot shoot to kill, instead of the previously satisfying, if not a bit boring, stealth head shot kill.  I have shifted what I find fun about the game.  It was never really fun to do all of the defend this workshop from trash mobs (made worse from the mobs that hide!)  in the first place.  I can say that I have earned more XP than I ever had before in the two days since One Wasteland, mainly because those dudes in the forest are level 50 now and GIVE a bit of XP.  Those defend the workshop missions are more rewarding now, at least to me.  It does seem that vamp legendaries are becoming viable again and that is not bad to me.  I made a new alt to experiment with the early game stuff, and it is more challenging when those level 10 scorched level up with you.  With a few guns to swap and use the various bullet types, or knowing which mobs are safe to smash with a melee weapon to save bullets, it is not much more difficult.  
---
But I agree with op, at least one of my silly weapons that I used on trash is now hanging in my Nuka-Cola themed shack.
---
It's actually easier to kill bosses than regular mobs now.
---
Not having that issue personally
---
I was just offering a very quick low perk point cost way of switching out a few perks to go from rifle focus to something that would allow them to level up to change out build
---
I’ve done this by accident before, I get itchy fingers and usually hit the ground running as soon as I can spawn, and I ended up behind the walls locked in with a bunch of slocum joe vendors
---
I run a bloodied heavy guns PA build and I love it, even with the recent patch I’m still killing most things with ease so I’d definitely recommend it.
---
“I don’t need to beat you. I just need to outlast you.”
---
Idk I’m pretty sure vanguard makes a big difference. Especially with What Rads now
---
I mean we still have bugs from fallout 4, but sure whatever you say.
---
Is this the enlightenment we worked towards these past years in the Palace of the Winding Paths?
---
Fair point, but excavator armor can give +200 lb of carry weight compared to +75 from unyielding +120 from high capacity backpack
---
Yeah I think I recall Angry Turtle doing a study of that. It doesn't hurt though. Definitely doesn't stack.
---
For me it’s just the audio files ( the BOS distress signals) or from what I remember her saying and sounding like.It’s most likely me thinking of things that aren’t real. 
---
But with that chapter for me thinking it will become something like the outcasts of at least some sort of splinter faction. Also her disobedience to Roger Manson by ignoring the messages he is sending her and Roger sending them on the expedition makes me think she is going to Appalachia for her own personal gain.
---
The items should store separately
---
Oh and Stealth was working much better in Patch 21 (Wastelanders).
---
Quite the opposite for me. Every enemy I've encountered has been giving more XP than before. Leveling up daily is going to be a breeze.
---
It doubles the pellets, you can see it if u shoot in a wall
---
I'm doing the same thing. Power armor is getting its moment in the sun
---
Ah yes forgot about that PA set. There is also the mod on backpack that reduce chem weight or food. It can be a massive amount of weight if players don’t have the room to switch out.
---
Lets do the math here:
---
You can save the most time by not playing the game.
---
Joking aside:Enemies taking longer to kill doesn't really bother me. 
---
Especially when i am getting faster levels and better leveled legendary rewards which is arguably way more important than a  few bullets or seconds.
---
Vg Junkies Commando is very strong. I rarely die. I don't do the damage a Bloodied commando does but I make up for it with 100% uptime. Only down side is well rolled Junkie Handmades and Fixers are expensive...trade only items, but that's the case with bloody commandos as well. Also, with a Vamp weapon you are near immortal.
---
I say don’t bother until you get the ammosmith and legendary ammo factory perks
---
Then it’s real handy
---
Also it’s mega strong against sbq so yeah worth
---
A lot of people don't realize or even consider chem and buff stacking like you mentioned, I've been accused of hacking on Xbox because I take a bunch of buffs and all serums and stackable chems in pvp and they can't kill me. Really good bonuses out there. Even overdrive and blight soup super easy to get a lot of will increase vats crits or headshots significantly. I think a lot of people just don't want to put an extra 5 minutes into crafting buffs.
---
Build a stash box at the workshop so you can offload before you leave next time, i generally do.
---
I do have Gun Fu equipped. The problems I have are a less that 10% chance the shot will hit despite a 95% shown. as well as the magic auto-heal of the target. Overall, I need to fire 3-4x as much to hit anything, regardless of gun,  even before this update. It's been like this for me since the first patch after Wastelanders.
---
I think it depends on the weapon and how often you are killing scorched. I decided to go for it on my handmade and went to automatic in the process, thanks to the bullet sponge enemies and the new ammo perk card.
---
I ran the new one in vault 94 with a level 155 and a 56 and we did about 4 in around 40-min, I was impressed on how the level 56 handled himself  and how we got under 7 min each time.
---
Be nice to build a Sentry Bot companion again...
---
At level 219 and have 99 level ups so this would be nice.
---
Follow Through has been the gift I imagined it would be.
---
The point (supposedly) was so that all areas were accessible to all levels, and you wouldn't get smeared when a high level player walked through and spawned high level mobs.  Basically anyone could play anything with anyone.  They sort of accomplished that, but really just made all areas equally exhausting for low levels.  
---
But you are correct in that they'd never revert, unless the playerbase shrunk to nothing, which this update won't cause.
---
That floats, lol.
---
Had a blast with my stealth vats archer today.
---
So if a normal shotgun shoots out 8 pellets would a TS shotgun shoot out 16?
---
Did u used to use the double unyielding  trick?
---
Im saying they fix bugs every update, you can't deny that.  Its not their fault main Bethesda gave them the same old flawed engine
---
Well I have any armor as ultra light since I’m usually in power armor, I use bandolier to keep ammo weight down, 5mm weighs nothing when you have 2 star bandolier. And calibrated shocks is a must in power armor for me
---
Yeah, I remember you would just pop it within a few minutes of a mission and then free energy forever. Then some time before the plains, they decided nah let's not have that
---
Finally got to play today and my quad/ffr/p is 10 times better than before the patch. Still have to double vats every now and then but I'm loving it. 2 shotting behemoths instead of 18
---
I am leveling faster than before since enemies grant more experience. They only take like 1 or 2 extra hits to kill in comparison before update.
---
Do you know the exact numbers you used to get from most enemies? Because I used to get over 3k from sentry bots, now it’s a little over 1k. Ghouls was 350+ now it’s low 200s. Mutants were 500+ now I’m getting 300s. And these are all enemies that have had their levels significantly raised.
---
The people I play with have all noticed.
---
Oh got all that lv 400 and was the first perk I maxed out on my legendary perks XD was just surprised at the tiny damage increase
---
Yeah, lots of people have posted about it.
---
Maybe you’re on double secret probation.
---
I have the grocer’s mod on my backpack and have to equip thru-hiker when I get in PA. No biggie. The PA suggestion is a valid one. A few teammates and I figured that out last night during Uplink.
---
I have a vampiric explosive fast crit fill railway I use as my healing
---
Yes I have the same issue with two of my fixers all 3* ones anti armor and the other is a suppressed but they just say the fixer
---
I only downvote aholes. No issue with actual discussions/healthy debates. We're good. Just not having the same experience. Lol :)
---
Never been in the game
---
You can do the same for armor mods, though the chance of learning a new mod appears to be a good deal lower.  I get maybe a mod per 20 armor pieces scrapped vs a mod per one weapon scrapped.
---
Another trick to keep in mind is to build low level copies of the gun you want mods for and then scrap them.  Expensive, but for guns like the handmade that don't show up all that often as drops, it's a good way to keep improving your crafting.  (and yet I still can't learn the damn supressor mod for the handmade!  I must have crafted a dozen of them!!!)
---
Why'd they do it that way?  Dunno.
---
"You can save the most time by not playing the game." Thats the first intelligent thing you've said in this entire conversation.
---
you missed the point. 
---
if ppl wanted the game to be harder then they would not all run to the same high power build with the same high power guns 
---
off topic example please try to fallow 
---
you are given the task of breaking a glass window you are shown 5 tools, a screw driver, a knife, a spoon, a shovel and a glass breaker hammer. you pick the glass breaker hammer and complain that it was too easy in fact 90 % of ppl pick that hammer. but the difference is that they have the good sense to not complain about **there** choice 
---
yes the devs should balance the builds out so that all the builds are viable but as i said im not holding my breath
---
Oh my god you’re right! This is honestly a perfect time to farm ultracite ammo.
---
Those numbers sound like a boosted weekend.
---
I mean, I'm running an unarmed build on my current main character, and I don't have anywhere near optimized gear aside from having a nice one star instigating power fist and I'm level 112. Before the patch, I was killing things in one punch usually thanks to my mutations boosting melee damage. After the patch, I'm still killing most things in one or two punches now besides really large creatures like Sheepsquatches and Scorchbeasts. I even solo ran the Daily Op yesterday and was like 20 seconds off of Elder ranking on my first go (Didn't run it a second time but that's mostly because I had other stuff I wanted to check out). I am going to be getting a friend back into the game though, and I'm going to somewhat use him as a test bed for how the game is for newer players now post-patch, as well as seeing how well teaming between a high and low level character is.
---
Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Fool me a thousand times, well, I must be a fan boy of &lt;insert game/company/sports team here&gt;
---
Thanks for the answers was about to buy thinking you can so i guess there is a visual bug with the arm then
---
I was rolling with an anti-armour gauss shotgun that had a damage output of 701 with all the Shotgunner (STR) perks maxed and active as well as maxed Demolition Expert (INT) I also have Adrenaline (AGI) maxed out which would bump my damage up to 1010 after X amount of kills for 30 seconds. Post update the best I can get out of it is 689, and that's with Adrenaline. Furthermore it has a range of 120, I literally have to be up close to stand any chance of hitting anything. I'm pretty sure the range on my Lever Action has been affected also. 
---
I can work with the damage reduction (it was certainly noticeable, beneficial even during Uranium Fever where everybody was able to take a shot at those legendaries) but range and accuracy are absolutely shot to shit, particularly in VATS.
---
They don’t though. I’m willing to bet you don’t remember the numbers you used to get.
---
One of my friends has 1 str and uses the chemist mod backpack for his chems. He went over 600 pounds heavier in PA
---
What’s the color coding mean?
---
I'll tell you how but I won't say it here dm me
---
Just rename it
---
Nice. Best advice I’ve got is ignore the mobs until the end. Thanks to Turtle these ops are easy.
---
Doubles the pellets but they are a at a lower damage level.  TSE Shotguns are still behind the Magic shotguns (assuming they were not nerfed)
---
I had my super xp-farm character be a bow build for 220 levels and it was one of the most rewarding things. Bows are basically useless outside of being bloodied, but when you started learning the aiming curve and when to use the crossbow versus bow, it became very fun
---
Same. PS4
---
It depends on if you wanna put time into farming flux.
---
Nope. Just a ton of intelligence, brain bombs and cranberry relish.
---
I've started leveling up much faster personally. Wolves giving me 150 xp, super mutants around 300.
---
It’s almost like that’s why I’m asking for advice =0 
---
My entire build was based around going in and getting out quick because I had to play on 20% of my max health. And now I can’t do that due to my output being cut by around 60%. So unless you can offer real advice besides “git gud” then kindly don’t reply.
---
Thinking about doing the same. I havent played in almost a year but I made a fair bit of content for 76, and I kind of want to make a new series showing these guys how to succeed in 76. My main is 420, and I have several 120+ alts. pretty confident I'll breeze through the leveling process, and with a bit of luck get a 1\* bloodied heavy weapon to carry me end game.
---
Are all the notes changed or are there legacy notes?? I loved the old version!
---
The game lets progress happen faster than before and gives you leveled legendary rewards that are level 50+ consistently 
---
By every metric the actually matters ...game progress has gotten faster, the only downside is that enemies take a few extra hits and boss enemies don't die in less than a min. anymore.
---
Not compared to power armor
---
Thinking about it, you're right.  The fact that someone who's high difficulty and someone that is low coulds fight the same enemy, would effectively make anything easier to kill for both the low and high person.  Oh well.
---
Everything, just about, took a hit
---
Pretty much the conclusion I came to, fuck I relate to this character a lot actually. Replace the bloodshed and running away though with my ex by legal definition kidnapping my kids and holding them on the other side of the globe.
---
Yeah if you spend time in what used to be lower level areas you’re going to level faster now. That’s not the point.
---
Oof. Hate to hear it, you've got my sympathies.
---
If i solo i will let extractor C fail so I only have two points to run between, and then just repair the last one before the event ends. Someone told me that all 3 have to be working for the best rewards.
---
Yea... I've been playing since the beta and had my build planned out even before that started.  It's not like figuring out a build is that difficult, well maybe it was for you.
---
adjust to a bloody sneak shotgun build and use a silencer. 
---
try this out: [https://www.falloutbuilds.com/builds/gilgamesh19-bloodyshotgunsupertank1/](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/builds/gilgamesh19-bloodyshotgunsupertank1/)
---
adjust the build based on what works for you and how you play. and to be more sneaky use the legendary agility card for +1 A, get escape artist, and replace dodgy 3 with sneak 3.
---
Yea exactly, any enemy anywhere can be life-threatening, this is the new reality of the wasteland. I miss the days when a bunch of level 1 scorched stand close to each other, I fire a single shot at the ground in the middle, they all die and motions completely synchronized like a ballet performance, won’t see another level 1 any more lol
---
Got my stealth vats archer went from lvl 99 to lvl 101 today. Didn't notice an xp nerf.
---
I remember the numbers I was getting before, and they were lower than the numbers I get now.
---
I assumed the same thing. Morans!
---
They fixed that months ago. Maybe this patch Undid that? Now I’m curious too.
---
Yes. Just get there. 8 minutes doable with 2 people today in the vault if you stick together. Also don’t waste time looting unless you have to. Wait til the end.
---
All of them, I think. I had a few saved in my stash and they were all corrected.
---
To be honest was thinking of getting most of it from ops drops like candy ;)
---
calling them "racist" is a bit silly considering what the circumstances are,  dont  you think?
---
I'm genuinely sorry this has hit just as you were getting into the game. All I can say is that some of us on the PTS really did try to argue for the new players, the casuals, and so on. I have two meta builds with godroll weapons and such, but my first love and main is my stealth pistoleer dressed full time in the Garb of Mystery who uses/used a TSE .44 and the Blade of Bastet quest reward sword. It's about as far from optimal as you can get.
---
&gt; I seriously can't progress any more. I'm out of ammo, out of scrap, all my guns and armor are totally ruined, my newly acquired Power Armor is trashed (I suspect this is done purposely to encourage people to buy repair packs on the Atom Store). 
---
I'm almost certain it was done to sell Repair Kits. Our advice about how bad for the games retention of new players, your exact situation, was pointed out repeatedly (along with many other points) and was conspicuously ignored. My theory is 'the team' were given their marching orders to make Repair Kits more desired, and the game being largely relaxed and casual friendly, with many low-level farming locations, wasn't in-line with that.
---
&gt;  Just to add, something I've noticed. Almost all the posts praising One-Wasteland are from lvl200+ players who are deeply committed to a good build. It makes sense they would enjoy it, as I imagine it added some challenge, but not enough to totally ruin their play style. 
---
These players in my opinion lack foresight, not considering what happens once they burn through their repair kits and less numerous scrap (ballistic fiber in the quantities needed to fix full sets of lvl 50 armor, for example), and/or in the honeymoon phase as happens with every patch where the constant and permanent grind/monotony that is doing anything now hasn't really registered yet. I've used 4k .45 since yesterday on my still somewhat overpowered Bloodied Commando while doing my SCORE challenges. So if I can use that much while 2-3 shotting every enemy then I feel for anyone who uses more bullets, even with the changes that help out with ammo retention.
---
One you have is Magic but the Anti-Armor versions of the Magic shotguns seems to work the best.
---
Do you know exact numbers from before and now? Because I do and so do my friends and they are much lower.
---
perk coins should be rewards and new legendary perks should be part of new story content drops from here out imo
---
Hey I have that maxed out too, but I don't see the perk effect pop-up on screen. I have seen it do so on PTS videos. What about you? Any pop-up when the perk triggers?
---
It’s just one of those weapon mods that have been teased in ATX photos but never implemented. It’s rather infuriating. There’s a user that compiled the missing/fucked up weapon attachments and what not. Similarly missing and fucked are the 10mm subgun rear sights.
---
Dang!
---
A nice thing is, in daily ops, if you use a ultracite weapon, the enemies will drop ultracite ammo
---
No it is the point. Wolves previously gave 50 xp. Now theyre higher level, they give 150. By what you're saying they should give under 50 xp. I am over level 200 and if im able to easily level in the forest I think this is a you problem. Id check to make sure your xp modifiers are all in order
---
I played it five times yesterday. I started with 600 shotgun shells and ended with 2900.
---
Colors just the type of plan like mod or weapons and such
---
Downed teammates keep the uplink speed. Shouldn’t release.
---
Full ap refresh/unyielding/sentinel THORN armor? How in the world...
---
You're welcome. If you use a Two Shot Explosive gun, specially it it's a shotgun, you will notice an obvious increase in damage, but also that the gun loses a lot of accuracy and durability. Also you will recieve constant harm from your own bullet's explosions wich you can avoid with dense armor or certain perks
---
Well there goes my sanity
---
So I’m just pulling numbers out of my ass even though I played last season well past rank 100 and meticulously set up a max xp build.
---
Sorry buddy can't help you on that.
---
You are quite right just had in my mind to the comparison of them being nazis and I think you can understand from there.
---
WHOS READY TO HAVE THEIR ASS KICKED
---
With my sneak, I get 2.3 more damage, using a bloodied  50 cal Suppressed Lvl 50, medium range.
---
Edit. My lvl is 179
---
Sadly you only get 3 rolls a day, 5% for easiest 10% for middle and 80% for elder.
---
So it is not a 100% drop, just keep at it!
---
Interesting. It makes sense when you consider the insane amount of hp and dr higher level enemies had even before the update. For example, the average player leveled with SBQ wouldn’t be able to solo. I think that’s true for most players under level 50 with regular scorchedbeasts even
---
Lol sorry I tried to help.
---
Was gonna do the same thing do my gatling gun heavy gunner  the return on 5mm is amazing
---
Would u say a TSE combat shotgun would do more damage then a BE combat shotgun?
---
What the fuck are you talking about. Most high level people have multiple characters, and they play plenty of builds. ALL are easy.
---
And your argument about breaking a window would have value if this weren't a survival game with resource management and a limited inventory system. Taking the "hard" way means spending more resources, means spending more of my time resource gathering instead of playing the game how i want.
---
Again, what you think is "hard" is just lengthier.
---
Oh I agreed most definitely. I’m a lvl 251 shotty build and the game is much better for me. I’m sorry to the newbs, but this seems sorta like a gift to the vets.
---
No, but should there be one? Isn't just a recalculation of my damage?
---
Why should I admit there's nothing wrong with an exploit? I'm really not getting the thought process behind this. Think we have very different standards and backgrounds so don't think further conversation will take us anywhere. You go ahead and exploit all you like. Bethesda will decide whether they let you do it or not.
---
I just got the Valley Galleria Plans.
---
Man that was an EASY OP today! Everything just exploded
---
Why should we let you guess when they published patch notes that explicitly state this is the first stop on rebalancing weapons and not the final state of weapon damage?
---
You're not using a max xp build without uny
---
Honestly now you are not supposed to random PVP it is a silly show.... Imagine you PVP someone they due but keep coming back and die and die and die but keep selling revenge.... Now if they whine you are ban! FO76 is so dumb
---
Failed EIGHT TIMES IN A ROW TODAY!!!!!!!! I AM NOT DELETING AND RE-INSTALLING AGAIN. Jesus people, is it really that difficult? Maybe out-source bug fixes to someone who knows what they're doing? Crazy , I know, but this is making the game so not fun. If I hadn't spent so much already I'd bail like so many others. Just so dis-appointed in you.
---
I got the Gutter plan on one character and a BoS outfit on another. Maybe a legendary or two.
---
Can you get more than one event reward a day?
---
I'm on PC and I just got one. I'll trade you for a solar panel plan?
---
Does give them an excuse to kill something that isn't making them money though.
---
Exactly I have shotgun shells falling out my ass
---
Level scaling is bad and breaks the power fantasy of leveling. This has been true in every game I've seen implement it. A large part of the fun in leveling is to run into a mob 20 levels higher than you and get one shot, come back 20 levels later and have a great fight, then come back another 20 levels later and crush them.
---
I got a BoS hat and the 94 stash box yesterday. Always wanted that steamer chest.
---
Is that only your first attempt that those percentages apply?
---
Yes, how awful being able to sneak so perfectly!
---
Seriously, does anyone read the patch notes or is it easier to run over here, complaining, and come up with conspiracies about our “evil corporate oppressors”. No wonder they keep putting Communist Bundles in the Atom Shop.
---
Im saying it doesn't but a lot of the other stuff they added do completely break immersion, so why not add this.
---
Yes.  I’m a casual player.  I can count on one hand the number of times I’ve launched a nuke on all my characters.  I have never cleared a colossal problem.  I have only once legit cleared Encrypted.  I have never completed with any real rewards Project Paradise. I haven’t even touched Radiation Rumble.  I only have a level 200 because I found that farming Fort Defiance Ghouls was a great XP farm during a double XP weekend and pretty much just farmed it for a whole weekend (along with trying to level up in NW which gives caps and XP in adventure) and went from level 45 to 200 over the weekend stacking various XP buffs .  I don’t trade with other players so any good gear I have has been found through dumb luck.  What money I earned tended to go towards just trying to upgrade my camp.  
---
With the characters I have, I have come to realize characters didn’t come into their own until you were in your mid 70s early 80s, a point where now you are simply tweaking your SPECIAL points and now starting to pick up some other perks that didn’t help you survive getting to that point.  Even the first few levels after 50 might still be picking up additional ranks of the perks you can’t even select until later levels.  
---
None of my legendary Urban or Forest gear has any mods since I need to buy them, and not even worth it since I’ll eventually hope to upgrade.  Two of my characters haven’t even started the Wastelanders stuff and don’t even have access to any gold and any events they do is worthless.  
---
I came into this game with what I *thought* was a good understanding of the system because I played FO4, but even that proved costly as I attempted to pursue gear and a build that I *thought* would make me basically invincible to ghouls based on how FO4 did damage calculation only to find that the damage calculation was different.  That was a lot of wasted time and caps. 
---
Sure, some things I’ve learned - like just earning caps through purified water, but I’m sure there are people who are better at the game who think my purified water farm is not efficient in getting me my caps, but it’s still works fine for me. 
---
Since day one I’ve gone against meta.  My “main” (even though he’s not highest level anymore) was a 15 CHA build that was going to be dedicated to healing and buffing the team with Empathy mutation.  People didn’t care enough.  Bloodied builds didn’t want me coming in with Rad Sponge to heal up their rads.  No one cared about my Medic Shotgun.  It only started to become useful recently with public teams and things like Daily Ops now coming out.  
---
So yes, I’d say that my situation and setup is not much different. I don’t “twink” my other characters out with drops.  My sniper character as an example, only has about 140 sheet damage with her rifle.  And it’s a regular sniper rifle, it’s not even the highest caliber gun she could have.  Her armor is a hodge-podge of zealots, bolstering, cloaking (which apparently doesn’t do anything against AI), weightless, and troubleshooters.   Her DR is only 141 ER 113 and 17 RR.  Her only mutation is Chameleon but that’s pointless with me wearing actual armor.  
---
I played her a few hours yesterday, it was fine.  I was in a casual group for bonus XP but wasn’t getting any other benefits.  No, I’m not touching Uplink with her anytime soon, they’d see through her stealth.
---
They should have rebalanced it to be useful when they "fixed" it, as it's pretty damned bad now.
---
You are 100% correct on everything. Enemy scaling across the entire map is a terrible idea with any game, nevermind one with already so many issues. The only people who disagree are the ones running the optimized meta bloodied build.
---
I’m doing that right now with my prime Gatling gun
---
Comparing those two weapons directly, its really close to Double. My b fixer having something like 180 damage while my TSE has near 300 without demo expert
---
the point was that regular armor is terrible in comparison to PA when it comes to defensiveness, not sneak. that's what the clip is illustrating.
---
but even then, you don't need bloodied armor to sneak effectively. chameleon is better for that, in fact.
---
Wait until you start stacking lunchboxes exp bonus with gold bullion rewards. Insane gains.
---
That’s what I was thinking. I’m saving my level ups so I can take y’all’s advice on here. Thanks a lot!
---
~~Where are you guys getting these numbers from?  You get a perk card per level (2 coins), plus a perk pack every 5 levels (8 Coins), which makes 10 coins every 5 levels.  That would mean you get 250 coins if you scrapped every perk card you got during those 25 levels.~~
---
Edit:  This is what happens when I try to do math at the end of the work day, lol.  I immediately realized after posting this that my math was completely stupid.  It's 90.
---
A lot of vault steel and legendary modules lost to the void of RNG
---
I have full.
---
Yah I use the ammo crafting perk card plus super duper and I’m half way through maxing the legendary ammo crafting card but I still burn through ammo.
---
Yea but if you u have your bloodied equipped all weapons get shown a damage buff from bloodied with their additional buffs
---
Right now tse is doing more damage as long as you have demo expert equipped. Seems to be a bug. Will get fixed at some point. The trade off is durability since accuracy matters less on a shotgun.
---
Yeah almost every event is worth it now, atleast those that legendaries are possible at, hello leader of the pack much?
---
I had the same problem but after jumping servers multiple times, it seemed to unbutton it just once and finally let me finish it.
---
You basically have to equip your TS to see the real value
---
I am Bloodied heavy PA and love it. Out of all builds, the nerf is the least noticeable with heavy.
---
it was a snide comment, but holds truth. too many people are running around with bad builds but a good gun, this worked a few days ago, but now the importance of a good character build along with a good gun that works with the build is quite clear. try out an anti armor shotgun if you can get your hands on it.
---
Rifleman and melee need boost.
---
I used to spend my caps on rare plans and give them to noobs, but that was on my Xbox account and I switched to PC so now I’m the noob.
---
use 40% health instead maybe
---
You literally said on another comment never
---
That’s what I’ve heard as well. So I’ve always done my best to simply try to max out the bar, but I could see the advantage of not worrying about Charlie and letting everything come to Alpha and Bravo
---
my level 40 what?
---
Can you link a build?
---
it negates all damage just like serendipity.
---
I however am on PC and I'm happy to throw you some supplies. I have an alt swimming in stims and water and such. What weapon do you prefer to use? DM me your game name and I'll add you as a friend.
---
Hahahahahahaha 😂
---
Ugh I just got rid of some junkies and vampire weapons too. I’ll look into some Vampire builds and maybe Junkie’s cuz I have gotten some solid stuff in the past with those weapons. Thanks!
---
I have similar level mains as you. I posted in other threads that I made a new toon last night. Ran till about level 16. 
---
I loved it. Not being able to waltz through mob after mob, having to actually flee 2 encounters, dying twice? 
---
It was great. It was more tense, more challenging, more immersive. I ran the classic Bladed Machete and pipe guns with crafted leather armour. It was challenging but not punishing. 
---
The two times I did die were because of my own stupidity. Leaving cover to just now down guys out in the open like pre-one wasteland. 
---
And another where I tried to rush a couple scorched after being just below health from a previous encounter.
---
Your opinion is just that, your opinion. I've played Destiny since day one and they always nerf. Like Bungie, Bethesda knows they're going to nerf, when they release meta-weapons. It's called the business of gaming, but it sucks, it's not good and the majority get angry. I started playing this, because Bungie kept ruining Destiny. Now, looking for another game...... Call me felicia, you'll be playing with yourself if they keep this up.😉
---
THANK YOUUUU!!
---
I had no idea why this happens to me sometimes and that makes total sense.
---
Been happening for a while, sad they haven’t fixed it yet.
---
It avoids damage, and reflects back (But that part is pitiful) it's a decent survival perk but was rarely taken due to lack of perk points, I could see it being worthwhile now if you have enough perk points and can invest in one or more of the legendary special cards.
---
I wouldn't say sledgehammers need a boost, but one handed and unarmed got kinda shafted a bit.
---
gold bullion rewards?
---
Im a junkie rifleman. Things still die but it takes 5 shots now instead of 2 or 1. Dont know what to do yet.
---
I'll have to check my inventory, but the reward screen only showed the suit. No helmet. Don't recall seeing it when I did the photoshoot either.
---
Thanks for the offer, but I'm PS4 and haven't gotten any of the plans yet.
---
If your health is low enough and you equip adrenal reaction mutation and nerd rage perk bloodied will deal more damage, and your gun will be more durable and accurate
---
Holy snowflake!
---
This has been a problem for a while now. I was hoping, that with the addition of patch 22, the rubber-banding of health would be solved. Alas, it has not.
---
Yes, with the new legendary perk you can make 10K of most ammo in less than a minute.  Lead, gun powder, flux, and ultracite requirements are the same.
---
I had this problem before the patch I use quad double barrell it lowers health to the 0 than it bounces back to half
---
Mine isn't that good (I have a few points I don't kbow what to do with) but there are a tonne on YouTube. Tyr has a good one if you can get past his narcissism and his Aussie accent.
---
End game currency.
---
After do the vault raid quest and you can get treasury notes for gold bullion as end game currency from doing events with a "!" on it. 
---
You also get treasury notes from faction quests that you do for settlers/raider faction quests and davenport daily camera quest.
---
Amém for that 🙏🏼
---
Why is it really,really, worrying him making a valid point ?
---
You being really really worried is actually  really,really weird.
---
Do You think that noob really need that nocturnal rolling pin or some 1 star wood armor piece?  
---
Jokes aside though, I find the best gift someone ever gave my low level alt was a minimum level hunting rifle, with a long barrel, a hardened receiver, and a long scope.
---
I was getting over 400 per ghoul today at Trancendental Meditation, used to get around 250.
---
Leveled up 6 times since the patch, 216 to 222 which is much more than I expected.
---
I'm not asking what gold bullion is, I'm asking what "gold bullion awards" are that give an XP bonus like you said.
---
Yup, as long as i have stealth I'm ok still, but piercing gaze in the daily ops means if i try to use berserkers i die super quick.....  Had to switch to VE handmade to make it through it without dying every 2 seconds... With VE handmade i only died every couple minutes..
---
Its based on your base receiver damage, not the modified receiver damage.
---
Try it with an unmodified receiver.
---
I’m not the best at perk building but that’s why I’m here asking questions about what to do. I appreciate the advice I’ll see if I can find something like that!
---
I use a power armor from ages now, I changed today from low health in to full health. Damage is not so much difference now and I found myself better with explosive effect. On the paper I'm sure that bloodied dealing more damage but after update I think Bethesda want to put in line all types of build - what's make sense with new adjustment
---
You’re comparing a level 10 wolf to whatever they raised them to now. I’m comparing a level 50 enemy. Apples and oranges.
---
I've considered it, just something I started mulling over. Regardless I'd still probably bounce back and play the character again if I do create a new one
---
Don't worry. I did about a dozen total today and yesterday thinking the same thing, got none, then just saw this post.
---
I was able to buy the paint and add the mod to an arm like 2 weeks ago. I would bet you still can but it will be a gamble
---
Hmm 🤔 sorry your dealing with these issues, luckily I have avoided any since Patch 22. Hopefully you can work around these bugs.
---
Second shot yesterday, had a 7 min 10 sec run with 2 players. It was all business and very little wasted time. Get to objective and activate, kill while waiting, move to the next objective. Used a lot of stims because we had piles of 1 hp gutsies at the outskirts.
---
Do you have any particular legendary gear that makes it feel worth it?
---
Lol. Are you then forced to Roleplay and the situation just gets awkward?
---
I'm having Rubber-Banding in BOTH directions.
---
Sometimes I shoot something, and it loses health, only to gain some back.
---
And sometimes I shoot something, and it takes almost no damage, but a few seconds later, they lose a large chunk of health.
---
I'm thinking to take a few levels of ironclad.   Then my damage resistance will be almost as high as power armor, and I won't lose ~150 lbs of carry capacity.
---
The good thing is I was working on an alternate build beforehand with heavy weapons so I’m not too far from getting a bloodied heavy. I’ll see if that’ll help, thanks!
---
Why you gotta take away his awesome Todd slam?
---
That's a good idea with the atomic lamp, I'm def going to give it a try 👍🏼
---
The issue is you can't just rush in and gun everything down any more. You can't just stand out in the open and now down mobs.  And some times you have to run away. 
---
It makes for more difficult encounters yes. But also more interesting. 
---
On my new toon made just to test this "unplayable for lower levels" idea, I quickly found that cover and positioning are your friend.
---
The truth is do you really need that 2k damage? 500~ damage is enough to kill a lvl 100 scorch in one hit.
---
If you include follow through legendary  it’s a big jump in extra dps.
---
Bloody will still be the go to for the best dps. Nerd rage still works multiplicative.
---
To get a lvl 40 god roll, youd need to be lvl 40
---
Lol where did you learn to do math? 
---
25 levels = 25 perks = 50 perk points (2 per card)
---
1 perk pack every 5 levels = 5 perk packs. 
---
5 perk packs = 20 perks = 40 perk points (2 points per card)
---
That’s a total of 90 perk points (40 + 50).
---
Your outcome of “10 coins per 5 levels” would only equal 50 perk points per 25 levels. Lol how did you even get 250 from your own math?
---
Yao Guais and Charred Ghouls are the 2 things that seems to beat my ass. Sheepie too I guess.. but I don't really run across one that often.
---
Charred Ghouls tho, 1 stumbled punch and suddenly I'm half health and my legs are broken. No idea how. Yao Guai I expect to hit like a truck.. but a Ghoul. Dang.
---
Oh my god. Please read your own post. You said enemies are giving LESS xp than before now. If this was true and wolves gave 50xp before that means theyd give LESS than 50xp not MORE.
---
and probably better than bolstering armor would be sets specific to areas you are farming like mutant slayer, ghoul slayer, zealots or troubleshooters. don't be surprised if these armor types gain in popularity. people are already finding out how useful a set of troubleshooters armor is in the daily ops with the robots of death in them.
---
"You don't need a *legendary weapon*, just use a *legendary weapon*"
---
I don't, what. Do ya'll even read what you comment? Unless I'm missing something by what you're saying.
---
Ive done pretty much the exact same thing except i cashed in my
---
Ricochet perk not thinking of how valuable it is compared to bloodied mess nowadays, (level 500+)
---
Ill be able to rebuy it probably sometime next year 😖😭😖😭
---
The base damage on a fixer at max level is 48.  20% is 9.6 (let’s say round up to 10). The difference you stated is 11 points.  As there could be something else behind the scenes I’m missing (some other small modifier in there somewhere) the difference seems negligible enough to worry about it.  The bonuses are additive now, not multiplicative.
---
yeah, but OP and his friends are seeing lower numbers, so you are wrong.
---
I mean, with a survival tent you can travel ANYWHERE for free from the Hornwright Estate safe room, if you dont mind 2 extra load screens.
---
The two show component is +25% damage, so bloodied could be under or over, but how most people run them it would be higher damage (bloodied)
---
OH!
---
 Lunchboxes are a gold bullion item you can buy that gives you exp bonus for each one you open and a random buff effect. 
---
You can stack them. i had 100 exp bonus for all forms of experience last night and getting double experience for everything.
---
 IT can go higher than 100. It gives you 25% per lunchbox.
---
I sent a msg via Xbox to an unkind gymnast. Did you get that Or was it someone else? They were a few.
---
it’s like serendipity and also works when wearing PA
---
Yh or a perk that generates ammo and the time and amount would depend on what gun u have equipped like let's say a 50 cal produces 100 rounds every hour and at rank 3 to 25 minutes ot makes 150 rounds
---
The correct answer is that after the patch yesterday, you can still put the camo jetpack on an arm.  You need to have purchased the camo armor skin for T-65.  You need to know the limb plan and jetpack plan from Rex.  First thing I tested after the patch.
---
No the trick to double your stats. You don’t even understand what he asked.
---
I guess I'm lucky to get them both at once.
---
I had to shoot a Leggo SB down last night, he never landed for my Bloodied Unarmed guy, only one level 100 scorched spawned.. maybe the mobs are a little smarter now, too XD
---
This is true. After I fixed up my build I’m killing stuff in one hit still. Except super mutants which is 2 to 3
---
Shredding Minigun anyone?
---
Not mentioning that preventing RAD-X you avoid supress positive mutation effects
---
if you wanted a challenge nothing was ever stopping you from playing with a nocturnal weapon. no reason to ruin it for other people.
---
His point is not valid, yet he says with confidence without second guessing himself.... that's what worries me.
---
Shouldn't be balancing around a subjective standard that only applies to SOME players differing experiences.
---
I'm only complaining because I still cannot romance my collectron.
---
As if dr matters compared to the flat damage negation pa gives
---
No. I'm sticking to my standard gear with damage reduction, high agility, fire protection, and other bonuses. PA is cumbersome and ugly and I'm not wearing it just because someone else demands it.
---
Hell yeah!
---
That weight bench/buff is epic too. Wish it was an hour in duration, though.
---
God speed to getting your power back!
---
guess we're gonna fucking find out. :/
---
If only i waited i just bought the ss jetpack instead
---
I just did the ACP event and holy shit the damage is terrible... Usually only use about 300 rounds or so and I blasted through 1k Ultracite .45
---
I’m more concerned with the boss fights and not the world exploration.
---
Both of my Main's builds took a damage decrease.....
---
I'm fine with it. I had to shoot things a few extra times. And have had to use some stims.... Gasp.
---
I can already solo SBQ with a paddle ball... This game is not hard by any means if you have +2 perception
---
You will have to run around the Wasteland with a Big Stick whacking enemies.:-)
---
I am getting in the practice with the crazy BOS shoot a Gutsy/whack a Gutsy .
---
Ok dude ... Not like I’m the only one that has issues with this patch. Haven’t noticed any amazing new loot dropping but I’ll keep an eye out.
---
Well, everyone that wants to do good must still use pretty much the same Guns. TSE and maybe Instigating
---
A level 100 or whatever it is now wolf gives more xp than a level 10 wolf used to. That’s your point. Not mine. Again, if there were level 50 wolves before, they would give more xp than the leveled up ones do now.
---
I got the BOS special ops helmet and the suit after completing a single daily ops.
---
Thats still not a max xp build
---
Yes, a 1/2 hour just isn’t enough IMHO.  By the time I have the buff, and fast travel to where I want to be, I’m already down about 5 minutes at least.  Though I’ve started using time tracking apps to warn me so I’m not suddenly encumbered.
---
Its not hard, per se. More than anything Its tedious and time consuming. And I'm done with it, i liked how it played before, and i DESPISE bullet sponges.
---
I guess we got to the point where they need "player engagement metrics" to justify its continued support, so like all devs in that situation they make the game more tedious  and require more farming.
---
I wish they didn't just give us a bunch of differnet colored skin rewards for different power armor/armor types like last season. They should just be in a slot by themselves.
---
They didn't even bother to give us the blue jumpsuit the "good guy" characters were wearing.
---
i feel like adrenaline and gunfu arent procing properly.. but nobody else is mentioning it so Im assuming I must be fucking crazy
---
Correct. Impossible to deny +60% dmg
---
Before, I got 160 from the ghouls in WS, now 180. Mutants in WT 240, now 260.
---
Edit: w/o any xp-boosting.
---
this build is not geared towards vats, but adding concentrated fire 1 should work.
---
The SBQ is still an easy kill. 
---
Earl is much easier if you have 2 people with follow through and taking one for the team.
---
With those 2 debuffs active you wouldn’t notice a difference compared to pre nerf unless ofc your one of those people that stacked melee damage and get 50k attk damage
---
Or they could just fix the ammo converter so its fucking convenient to fucking use.
---
On the bright side, the ammo converter is still a pain in my ass.
---
Surge has it
---
Thank you, that cat 2 fucked us up over here in pcola, we have a bridge out, trees and fences down, off work for a couple more days but they will be a waste if i cant grind daily ops! 🙃
---
Lunchbox?
---
You get downvoted but you're completely right. I don't understand, its like people don't want to take the time to make a good build.
---
No? I retried 3 times to test that and she didnt drop it any of those times.
---
Yeah well, that dream has passed.
---
Yes. It seems like it is in the live version too.
---
The camp objects are all pretty cool. The inundation of commie junk and generic US military crap has absolutely zero interest to me though.
---
This sub:
---
"Make Deathclaws terrifying again!"
---
One Wasteland drops
---
"Took 8 shots to kill a scaled Deathclaw. Badthesda breaks the game again. Cancelled FO1st"
---
I just hope they take out “complete a daily op” as a daily.  I don’t think I’ll want to do those everyday.
---
Yeah man, I feel ya.
---
No i kinda think theyd give the 100-150~ they have now. Actually having done free range in the past i can confirm that. Level 50 wolves *did* exist back then.
---
No, just my running around the wasteland build
---
Also with my bloodied deathclaw gauntlet with iron fist X3 it does 611 damage. Without Iron fist it does 597. That’s not 20% either. Why bother using that perk?
---
Daily ops
---
This is many lower levels problem right now. They stand out in the open while a mob swarms them and don't get why they are dying. 
---
Started a new character to level 16 last night. Cover and positioning make huge differences. Was difficult but not punishing.
---
Level 60 cave crickets..... With dead possums scattered around
---
Absolutely my experience also.
---
One last question, do you think the damage is big enough to compensate for basically 20% health? Or would a little less damage but full health be better?
---
Damn lost my camp spot at Vault 51
---
What are you talking about?
---
No one said the loot drops were"amazing" they just improved the rate at which get exp and rewards so it makes it easier to get your best weapon faster since you will never get a god roll legendary that is level 25 again.
---
Because of the increased rewards you are now making more progress faster towards your goals, which is the exact opposite of making things more grindy.
---
All that is changed is that enemies take a few more hits now with increased exp/rewards.
---
I agree this is a nice QOL but as a lvl 167 i will keep my patience and switch those perk card every time I nees it.
---
BTW: I saw that will be possible to just add mprr perks slots woth legendary cards... What would be the difference to imvest directly on Infiltrator or add morr perk points to perception?
---
That’s what I would have like to seen just more balance. Like keep those lvl 10s that you can one shot but, maybe in that group there is a 60. Or around the corner. Idk I have no idea how that all works but so far I’m not digging this.
---
Ok thank you for answering my questions:)
---
Yep, got the BOS suit on my first run with only Initiate. However, nothing since on several runs. Really want that liquid courage recipe.
---
“Any build dedicated to a specific category does fine.”
---
As long as that weapon category is heavy weapons.
---
Corrected
---
Hmm so it may be worth trying to do free range in the mire now...
---
If you like to sneak then heavy guns are not an option (loud = danger mode) since you would have to bulk up your defence and survivability (lot of perk switching). Stick to shotguns or switch slowly to commando. If you stick with shotguns try to find even better weapon or try to maintain sneak to hit more sneak shots to one enemy. You can probably buff your stealth with armor mods and perks to stay undetected :)
---
Edit: do not rely on magic or bugged builds i.e. blocker armor and 33 vats shotguns since they will get fixed sooner or later
---
Show us on the doll where the evil bloody player touched you.
---
This is the only reason why I did it solo. I just wanted it done, but the score points are definitely not worth a solo run
---
Platform?
---
Yeah, I ran the new one 4 times. Elder on each one and received nothing.
---
Grab a full set of Shadowed Wood armor, try for any legendaries that give harder to detect while sneaking, and/or weightless pieces (if you’re not already under the 5lb armor threshold, you should be. You get a significant sneak buff if the combined weight of all equipped armor is under 5lb)
---
Be sure Agility is maxed at 15 (Agility helps you sneak) and don’t forget about the Sneak perk card.
---
Snag yourself an Instigating Hunting Rifle with the .50 Receiver. (Instigating is still Multiplicative with Sneak/all damage)
---
I’m still able to faceblast the Super Mutants in one headshot through West Tek.
---
Lunchboxes, OK. Still have 20 of them from Season 1, yeah they're awesome.
---
Stay safe out there friend! We have smoke and wildfire on the west coast! 🖤
---
Exactly the same thing happened to me.
---
There's a difference between an OP legendary weapon and a decent legendary weapon. 
---
A 1* DCG isn't OP even before one wasteland.
---
They followed you home, watching you every step of the way, just to ambush you. Rookie mistake, Wastelander.
---
Vampire Weapon
---
Maybe thats the plan
---
Sorry to hear about your Lucy. Losing a pet is the worst
---
No, I’m getting more XP.  With max buffs I was getting about 218 XP per ghoul at fort defiance.  I’m getting 300+ XP with the same setup there now, since the ghouls are level 60 &amp; 100 rather than 42 and 60
---
I know but he said the forest.
---
Yeah but let’s be honest Armor skins this season is better then that ugly ghille suit from last season
---
The damage increase on paper doesn't really reflect the boost against scorched and scorchbeasts. As long as you can maintain the flux it's totaly worth it, simply because you get a massive amount of ultracite ammo vs regular for the cost of 1 flux and a few more of the regular mats, especially with the new perk.
---
For example, with Ammosmith and max legendary ammo perk you can get 900 rounds of ultracite 50cal per craft (with a 30% change for a couple hundred more if super duper procs) for the cost of 1 violet and a bit more of the regular mats.
---
I feel like Bethesda doesn't understand that there are games waaaaay better at being combat focused looter shooters . I just like exploring and occasionally plinking off some baddies.
---
Sorry I couldn’t get the link to work so I put the names of them on
---
Can i play with u
---
That wold be great. Would help a lot to quickly find what is affecting the weight the most.
---
Ok so even for uncommon you only have 3 chances?
---
I said the forest because the only place level 10 wolves spawned is in the forest you donut
---
Yeah not a single useful weapon skin, a bunch of red armor with combat armor stars, and rehashed free states paints when I already had at least four blue paints already.
---
There's not much there and I bet the green house stuff will end up in the foundation bullion machine after the season ends.
---
I'm really liking the SPECIAL ones.
---
Yeah, if you're bon Xbox I can place them in your camp till you get the plans.
---
Thanks 👌
---
Same, Liquid Courage, the Solar Panel, and the Caged Lights are really the only ones I want and I continue to get nothing, and the fact that you only get really one attempt a day has started to turn off the Ops for me
---
Ye, like I don’t mean to be super nitpicky but getting shot like six times with my scout armor on only to get crippled and die kinda sucks when I’m trying out the new daily ops
---
I don't use Gun-Fu but Adrenaline has been working fine for me.
---
other notes: For the heavy gunner conversion swap evasive for action boy/girl 3. Ironclad does not work in power armor so can replace and adamantium skeleton can be replaced with fireproof 3. The build only has 3 INT, using a legendary card to increase INT will allow for stabilized to be used adding anti armor to the heavy guns. this should make the build work as either a power armor heavy guns build or a sneaky shotgun build without swapping points around just the cards.
---
I think the best way to handle this is to either adj the buffs to guns as a whole or and I'd even say also add in a hardcore adventure server that scales everything to the max and have reg adventure be for everyone
---
I found today's Op 1000x easier than the one we had yesterday.
---
He runs Stabilized on a Stealth Rifleman build.  But he didn’t think his build needed any help...
---
I agree generally, but I'm not interested in PvP.
---
I've seen some people mention that but for me the popup numbers at least check out.
---
Sure, already beat today’s, so just follow where I go and we can finish fast. 
---
Gt Bandos exile I’ll be on in an hour or 2
---
I hate the scales enemies. 🤷‍♀️
---
Yeah, sorry, we tried on the PTS. If it's any reassurance the team was getting all our feedback.
---
Yeah I was solo-ing the majority of “heart of the swamp” today (people came in at the very end when the boss showed up).  I can no longer handle mirelurk/ghoul hordes with my build.  I even have adrenaline maxed and I’m seriously jumping up to the cliffs to recoup and come back at them.
---
Without any boosts from lunchboxes, food, or team bonuses I'm getting somewhere around 900xp for a WS sentry bot (depending on my health), which is pretty much the same as it was pre-patch.
---
Lmao this shit reminds me of the Sims honestly. The weight bench and train station are sending me 😂😂
---
It’s actually not accurate. Battlepasses require you to buy into them.
---
So dogs at bog town should give you 300+ xp then since they used to be 50 and that’s what they gave me. Willing to bet it’s not even close.
---
I felt like this was happening with sneak attacks with a shotgun, but to see the numbers to go with it... its just not right.
---
I built a giant floating spaceship. Maybe lower your expectations.
---
Sometimes I watch the 2-3 ants completely destroy the deathclaw that spawns at the relay station north of watoga... damn ants taking one down.
---
Did you buy everything
---
I usually drop one or more of the following: a fully modded pipe rifle, 300 .38s, 10 stims, 5 rad away, 10 purified water, 10 Salisbury Steak, a full set of deep pocketed leather armor, a power armor frame, 3 fusion cores, and a hazmat suit. Plus whatever decent level-appropriate legendary I've picked up. Lol
---
Best thing I ever dropped for a low level was a level 15 TSE pump and level 15 Raider PA with Jetpack and Calibrated Shocks.
---
nah my AA .50 makes the health rubberband up and down
---
Hundreds a day is still nothing when you get 1400 caps just from vendors each day
---
Very true actually. There were technically fires already happening, but that set off a chain reaction and then the winds came. It’s been Smokey for like a week now:
---
[Seattle Three Day Ago](https://imgur.com/gallery/FraGjMY)
---
You may want to trad that suit. All the rarer items are pretty valuable rn and will probably be worth a lot less in the next few weeks
---
Having level 3 Fireproof also really helps 😂
---
IF and that's a HUUUUUUUUUUGE IF they were to ever do something like this there is no way in hell they would make it the way you want it where you could farm ten coins per hour for as long as you want.  It would need to work the same as essentially every single other system in this game ans have built in limitations i.e. instead of granting 1 coin per run that can be farmed as many times a day as possible it would need to be a larger reward tied to one of the daily ops tiers that can be redeemed once a day.  Or if it isn't  a once a day reward having there be a cap on how many you can earn in a day.
---
You're going to say "But only getting X more a day would still take too long to max out a full set!" and that's the point... legendary perks aren't supposed to be something you can just easily acquire, they're supposed to be long term goals.  Getting even just five extra coins a day wouldn't be a match for being able to spend an evening farming fifty of them but that's still a fully ranked perk every two months just for doing the daily ops you were doing anyway and independent of whatever else you're earning from leveling up and opening packs.
---
Nice! I just had a look at all the new plans, and they look pretty nifty. Cant wait to try for more
---
Yeah if they're the level 100 ones and your xp modifiers are good enough id reckon theyd go for 250-300xp
---
Greenhouse pieces do nothin' for ya?
---
Can someone explain why players bull up the fixer. For me it's proved useless. My 2 shot combat rifle is much better. Please advise how I can maximize my level 50 fixer? Forgot to add. I have a rifleman build.
---
The only reward that changes is the amount of nuclear material you get. The higher the gauge, the more you get at the end. 
---
That said, the amount you get from the event reward is tiny compared to the amount you get from the actual miners, so it's not really a big deal.
---
I am now excited
---
With my unarmed im doing 400+ damage without perks but have mutations bloodied etc. I would like a slight damage buff around 100-200 extra damage as for rifles they seem fine to me i either 1-2 shot them on headshot consistently but yes compared to heavy and Automatic rifles the dps seems lacking
---
I mean... Is it waterproof? It has a looot of holes and gaps so I really don't think so.
---
Ah I gotcha, I misunderstood you there.
---
I wish more people felt this way
---
here's what the heavy gunner conversion would look like without adding legendary perk cards to increase agility or intelligence:

---
From your fingertips to our heavenly Toodfather's eyeballs, my friend. Well said, and appreciated as a *proudly* unoptomized FO 1st toon owner.
---
I was about to ask the same question! My handmade was breaking after every event I finished and that was with the 200% repair card! I had to fix my rifle 3 times in around an hour. It almost broke after the swarm of suitors quest and that's just a couple handfuls of mirelurks! 
---
Side question, anyone questioning whether the range sneak attack perk is proccing? It never seems to add the damage over time after the shot while it says sneak attack up top?
---
Oh gosh what a shame, i know it was an accident but it was a stupid one, are they facing criminal charges after that?
---
I've played since BETA, my expectations are very low but every time I have a good CAMP something breaks it, every time. Stuff sunk into the ground, the roof or the budget seems bugged. I don't know, when you spend a couple hours making what you think is a great CAMP only to have it bug out etc. is very tiring.
---
dont make friends with bad people? dont put random people to friend list... Common sense? something like that?
---
Different glitch, same effect.
---
This time it's for the T65.
---
37 extra damage with a high-powered weapon for 3 perk points. on a sneak attack nonetheless.
---
it makes no sense. sneak ***multipliers*** are inherently multiplicative.
---
It would be fun to run around the wasteland with Plumb bob over our characters head. 
---
Bethesda, give us this instead of stimpacks and radaway..
---
Well damn I learned it right away thinking no one would want it. Lol story of my life with guns and outfits the first year a half that I never paid attention or followed this reddit. I swear I had legacies and just dropped them or sold them to vendors being I didn’t have ammo of the damage wasn’t shit back around launch. Hate to truly remember everything I did like that without knowing how valuable it all was. I’ll just craft a bunch and sell to ppl
---
This is the issue with Bethesda's and Fallout 76: The multitude of endless bugs and issues that plague the player base all lead to one road: "It's YOUR fault. Submit a ticket. Deal with it." 
---
The buggy game board is NOT my fault. Neither are the multitude of bugs we endure each day in Fallout 76 to find some semblance of normality in the game play. 
---
Removing the board after it's laggy performance and not auto-unlocking the rewards upon completion is a poor design choice especially when it's just as easy to leave it in the game. A simple option to access the S1 game board within the S2 game board interface seems like a simple no-brainer. But like I said in my OP, after nearly 2 years of the same ol' shit from Bethesda, why expect that kind of forethought? It has to be retro-actively smashed into the game like everything else (if at all),
---
To be at this point in the (de)evolution of F76 is astonishing to me. To normalize the poor state of it's quality to the point we blame each other for not easily navigating through it's endless pitfalls is heart breaking.
---
You don’t use traveling pharmacy or bear arms?
---
Ahhhggg. You got me! 
---
I wasted time reading your post. Bravo 👏
---
It's a SURVIVAL game. If you can't survive it go play something else....You are a level 30 OP... When you gain more levels things will get easier. Nobody is forcing you to play. I love the update and wish the game was a bit tougher upon it's initial release, no fun 1 shotting everything...it is for a little while but gets old...Im lvl 792. Tighten that belt and get back out there.
---
Have you tried a Gauss rifle ?
---
Since the patch I've just been using an Instigating Fire Axe with 40% Power attack. One shots almost everything, even in the ops.
---
Why use Bloodied when everything takes one hit? *taps head*
---
Jokes aside, I'll probably shift to a Junkies build, eventually.
---
and for power armor try out a set of T-51b with calibrated shocks and emergency protocols. really strong and relatively easy to find mods for.
---
I recommend looking into some survivability
---
I think that'd be interesting, though it'd be nice to just be able to craft them. Even just a crappy version. Make it only repair up to 50% or something, weigh 10lbs, I don't care. It's weird to not have a solution for durability outside of your camp.
---
I was actually thinking back to when I used to play a modded FO4, and remembered this one mod in particular: [The Mobile Mechanic](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/18262). I thought it was a really nice solution as it allowed you to have the functionality of crafting benches, but the trade-offs were that they weighed a lot, and you didn't have access to workshop materials so if you wanted to make repairs, you needed to have the materials on hand. Beautifully implemented.
---
Got the BOS special ops outfit and the helmet in a single daily ops.
---
Could it be multiplying off the weapons base damage?
---
So you are using the same foods now?
---
I haven’t played yet so what do you mean about staying alive at camp? Is everyone just hostile af now?
---
It’s XCOM ;)
---
Customer support says they won't do jack.
---
I'm trying to get a confirmation on the official forums as to whether its a bug or intended.
---
If its intended... damn
---
This would be very helpful! Sometimes you forget about ores or something, or in my case, fiberglass spools, and it's time to do a purge
---
How much intelligence and what buffs?
---
Honestly, with the fact that simple game breaking bugs haven't been fixed, and it's being made orders of magnitude more difficult and time/resource consuming, that's how it seems. They have lost a fuck ton of money on this game because they released something that was lipstick on a pig. The game engine is both old and not designed for a multi-player environment. Their servers had issues which have improved. The moment the game was lost to me(even though I kept playing, mostly) was when they backtracked from "Only cosmetics will be available in the app store, not functional items" to adding repair kits, scrapping kits, and collections, along with adding on FO1st. Stop trying to claim one while doing the other. They're trying to make people spend on micro transactions, and when it didn't work they turned up the difficulty/spunginess to cause gear breaking more, and mats are significantly harder to get so you burn through more stuff to get the stuff to fix your stuff, so the allure of a magic fix-it becomes stronger. It's actually quite plain to see, when looked at through the lense of modern gaming being micro transaction and pay-to-win driven. There's no such thing as a quality skill-based game experience that's single player anymore. It's either true MMO, subscription and all(which is fine), or base game that's unplayable without extra expenditure.
---
So I should just take the commando perks and use something better? Damn just changed my whole build around two months ago lol oh well back to how it was during launch. Just using whatever and dying and not caring.
---
I’ve played since beta as well. Watch a YouTube video on the ins and out of the building system, once you get the fundamentals you won’t have those issues.
---
Now this, this is a major problem. :-/
---
Sure. But also not as... thoughtful(?)
---
Idk. Just something about dropping good level appropriate weapons just felt good. Rather than dropping 100 scrip worth of legendaries.
---
I’m on Xbox I don’t know if I just have to restart the game but thanks
---
Nice what’s the enemies today? I see it’s in vault 94. I’m just getting off so I don’t know
---
If you’re just aiming for completion, there’s nothing keeping you from playing the same way you always have. As with everything, if you’re trying to speed run something, it requires a more tactical approach. And it’s endgame content, coming from an update that has given a major resource boon to all players. Even if you don’t have Ammo Factory, it has still resulted in flooding the player shops with more available ammo. If you want more of the same and are angry that they’re making challenging content for players who are getting burnt out, then you can always go back to fallout 4.  
---
But for what it’s worth, I got a 5:36 time with no deaths, carrying my wife, who is level 20. As far as endgame speed run content goes, this is pretty forgiving.
---
Still looking for help?
---
Can you repaint it after you apply the jet pack? I’m fairly opposed to the camo skin long term.
---
I too love the gauss rifle.
---
Oh yeah that’s not great
---
Man what a shame, this is the real nerf... Why change this???
---
I got vault 94 plan first time getting elder
---
Lol best rule of thumb is if it’s an outfit and the drop chance is below 5% for it then someone will pay a premium on it. I guess when you own every legacy and high powered-weapon, a cosmetic that will drop value fast isn’t a big deal
---
No.  Game just got rebalanced.  It’s a bit harder but new cards will help.
---
I can understand that. Then again who doesn't like taking a spin at the purveyor ya know? It's like getting cash for your birthday
---
As a power armor user holy shit this would be amazing
---
Best fight I ever had was me and one other guy, certainly harder but it was by far the most fun
---
I believe they’re referring to the lost opportunity to pick a card to then scrap, instead of moving a special point.
---
Enemies scale to your level.  So if you are level 100, mole rats attacking your camp will be level 100.  Also they NERFED bloodied, Junkie, and stealth builds.
---
Lol May as well. I already gotta keep my Sim- er sorry- Vault Dweller's hunger &amp; sleep (for xp) up and build up my house.
---
It's post apocalyptic sims. 
---
Just waiting for the bladder bar and to have to relieve my character every 15 minutes 😂😂
---
I would rather say it is very good to have it at basic level but level up it only when you leveled up your other perks. This is what I am planning to do.
---
Especially when it hits you while your 10 feet in the air, leaping over a hoard.
---
It was crazy first run
---
😩
---
I’m going to revamp to a full shotgun build from a rifleman/fixer build pretty soon.  When I actually get time
---
Right, it’s like popping meat sack balloons
---
This is fallout, we should be able to play however we want. There shouldn't be a meta like call of duty or something. I shouldn't have to "change my play style".
---
It's Better Inventory. Any UI mod needs to be updated I think, I removed Save Everything too to be safe
---
I've noticed that recently and it's not just prime weapons.  
---
It works fine when you first log in but breaks soon after.  
---
I only have 2 weapons and both are favored. If I try switching from my Dragon to my Sniper, it just pulls up my fists. Fist to Dragon works fine.
---
It's annoying since I use the Dragon as an opener and immediately switch to sniper to start VATS crits.
---
I have the fundamentals, I can do double sided walls, I know about scrapping wires before the object and most other issues and tricks but you can't stop the game when it sucks something into the earth randomly or into the roof, gets the budget bugged for some reason etc.
---
Well I usually only use Radshield and Rad-X diluted if I need it, but it seems like I won't need anything like them ever again.
---
Twice that I spawned in at my camp I got slaughter by ticks ... TICKS!!!! before I could make it thru my front door and I only have one turret facing the spawn location but is also blocked by a tree. I can see maybe one tick would give me enough time to pull out a weapon but three? And on the initial log in your person isn’t even equipped with a weapon yet until you select one .
---
It's additive of the base damage now. This means the more damage increases you have, the less overall return you will see.
---
ie. (Using round numbers as an example with a base damage of 100)
---
A 50% increase to 100 is 150. That's a 50% overall damage increase.
---
A 50% Increase to that 150 is 200. That's a 33% overall increase.
---
A 50% Increase to that 200 is 250. That's a 25% overall increase.
---
A 50% increases to that 250 is 300 That's a 20% overall increase
---
16%
---
12%
---
ETC.
---
When you add stuff like the STR bonus, weapon card bonus, legendary bonus, bloody mess, adrenal reaction blah blah blah things that say "increase damage by 20%" are actually no longer 20% of overall damage, but a much, much smaller amount.
---
Yeah well guess even after two years of playing still learning. Thanks. I’ll make sure today to trade whatever plan I get. I mean I still have a tendy plan being I know meat week is coming again but if ppl don’t get it that time it will be even more valuable. 😁
---
Lol I guess.
---
My explosive combat shotgun breaks while I'm fixing it! This patch sucks!
---
And my stealth build isn't allowed in daily ops.
---
It feels horrible even for a high level build. Everything is so painfully slow and sluggish. With the right defensive perks enemy damage can be mitigated, but this just turns the fights into a snoozefest where you stand in front of some blood eagle emptying whole mag or two in his face. I don't know, may be the real goal of this update was to force everyone to switch to stealth commandos.
---
Yeah I love the change.  It's nice to play horde events  where the three star boss is no longer dropping level 35 gear in the cranberry bog (which is supposed to be a high level area).   When I kill super mutants in Grafton, I am getting a lot more XP.  I haven't noticed any real difference at all, honestly, but I am a level 481 non-bloodied build. I am power armor/ heavy weapons and mostly use instigating explosive Gatling gun and Quad Plasma caster for every day use. For the queen and Earl I use Furious Gauss minigun or Final Word, usually.  Some of the legendary perks are pretty amazing.  I ran a missile silo today and didn't see any difference really.
---
I ain't downvoting ya! But the sub seems very downvoty today.
---
Almost everything got a reduction in damage as a result of the damage modifiers rework. It wasn’t just those builds.
---
Ok. I'll try removing those two and see what happens. Thanks!
---
Not even worth it at 1 star.  There are other perks you can just swap in for it, it does nothing special
---
Not a nerf and not build specific
---
ricochet works well enough, just don't run it if you are using an instigating weapon as the reflected attacks will damage enemies health
---
Sure, but in the forrest every enemie is lvl 50 (when you are ofcourse above lvl 50) Some variation  would be welcome.
---
it take two seconds just for the pipboy to load
---
Pretty sure they are like magazines , so randomized spawns
---
[Exploding Blood Eagles.](https://imgur.com/a/vyZhW3Q) . It’s fun watching them blowing up all over the place but keep practicing that social distancing because all those exploding eagles down you fast
---
maybe, I think the math checks out. although it could be just a coincidence.
---
but it's still far from the expected flat 2-2.5 multiplier, though. I should be dealing 452 damage, not 301. might as well nerf instigating too.
---
They changed all multipliers to be additive instead of just unyielding as they said in their notes.  Possibly a future patch
---
Neither of those will interfere with it. The culprits were mods that altered the HUD, Event notifications, improved healthbars, perk loadout manager, chat mod. 
---
Event notifications, improved healthbars and perk loadout manager have been updated, the chat mod is still being tweaked. Since chatmod has to be run last, it's the weakest link with how the files work together. Liyalai will have it fixed eventually. 
---
You still get the rewards, it just blocks the report from coming up. So you can fast travel to your camp and you'll still get the rewards.
---
Technically can't you chose to take a new perk card, the pick something you don't need and then scrap that? It's kind of a pain, but so is scrapping perk cards from perk card packs too.
---
That's nice and all but does it still crash the game? I haven't been able to play in months because of a shit save point after fast travel.
---
Yeah that’s great for optional end-game content, not baseline gameplay.
---
Exactly however the bloodied mini gauss I was awarded definitely made it easier
---
Well shit. I genuinely didn’t know this, now I know why my teammates were spamming the follow me emote whenever I wandered away to loot
---
Random chance of being a magazine.
---
The exemptionis Grognak and the ruby ruins which is found at Grafton dam.
---
Have you read the plans?  Or are they still in the notes section of your inventory?
---
I think it was always torches and pitchforks, and they just combined them.
---
I enjoy quite a lot of the changes, but the level of enemies seems to make fights a little more of a turn off. I can still 2-3 tap most mobs with my instigating pump, but the amount of damage they can put out and the fact it feels like they spot me from a mile away means I'm stimming quite a bit, even with 400+ resistance in all categories.
---
The update has also renewed my burning hatred for Gutsy and Assaultrons, which before were both manageable, especially the assaultron. Now that they're level 75 I'm fighting the highest possible mob variant these guys can spawn as, and they come close to whooping my ass when you've got a head laser melting you and Gutsy plinking you from a mile away. I have a feeling any higher up engagements may end up slowly sucking resources away faster than I can earn them back in order to fix all my gear. Maybe I just need to hunker down and refine my playstyle to work around the changes? Who knows, we'll see..
---
The cammo AR10 like, handmade skin looks good (putting apart the well known issues this skin has) but I'm with you, I was expecting more in this field
---
Nice I can’t wait I’m going to try solo tonight
---
Did a run earlier and one of the group evidently had neither dense armor or fireproof. That was hilarious.
---
Do you read? He said OP, a 1* is in no way op and very easy to get.  I sell 1 * weapons and armor for 50 -100 caps at my vendor.
---
If you’re higher level, they’re gonna be their highest possible level, which is 50 in the Forest
---
I agree, Camp budget sucks.
---
I know, a little embarrassing for sure. I'm just glad I was on my own, nobody saw.
---
Those are sweet drops for noob care packages...
---
Have a word with yourself ffs.
---
Players not diving in to the experience ?
---
YOU ARE PLAYING A GAME SUPPOSEDLY BASED IN A POST APOCALYPTIC WORLD.
---
Only the strong would survive by finding the best Guns and armour.I would say that is part of the reality.
---
But snow flakes have a problem with this.
---
it is not fair...............why should higher levels have OP builds because they have more levels in the game...........why should i have to grind out to be equal.
---
Lets all be Commies and run around with the same Pea Shooters so Karen dosent lose her shit because she cant compete.
---
In a post apocalyptic World only the strong would survive.
---
But here we are,killing a build to appease lazy mard arses.
---
And you have the audacity to accuse those players of not embracing the Fallout experience.
---
I’ve read them, I can build the chest piece and arms I just can’t find the plans for leg pieces or helmets
---
it was never just unyielding, though. it was all effects. except inherently multiplicative ones, like instigating or, one would think, sneak. armor calculation, too. it remains the same. so why not sneak?
---
Yea kinda stinks, altjough fallow through definitely helps make up for it.
---
Well, Double damage was exagerated, but still significant damage
---
https://m.imgur.com/gallery/uYlg7e5
---
I need to compare TSE to BE but i dont have a BE on me right now
---
Yes, but the jet pack still has a camo look (the limb will change color though).  It does not look to bad on my shadow prime skin or plague rider skins, but it is definitely noticeable.
---
Still.  It takes essentially no effort.
---
First off, whatever the game was or wasn't intended to be, for 2+ years, that's the way it's been, since I played in beta. So to say that a casual jack-of-all-trades playstyle doesn't fit this game or isn't what it's meant to be feels very bait-and-switch-y at best. I'd also argue that the jack-of-all-trades playstyle is meant to be a valid one, because this is not a hardcore RPG. It's an RPG-lite. By nature, jack-of-all-trades does not do maximum damage like a specialized build- that's the trade-off, and one that many people are fine with.
---
Second, no, not any build does just fine. When I said I had a jack-of-all-trades character, I mean that with a little tweaking of my perks, I can do ok with any type of weapon, which is what I enjoy. But that character's specialty has always been stealth rifleman, and the build is actually completely optimized for it. I just don't play it all the time, because it gets boring to do the same thing. Pre-OW, with my rifleman build loaded, I could one-shot a max level super mutant or gutsy with my main gun. Now, with the same gun, same perks, all things being equal except OW, it takes me 3-4 rounds to put down a super mutant, and even more for the robots. Between OW and the damage changes, that's an effective 60-75% nerf at least, which is insane. 
---
Nobody's arguing that purpose-build loadouts shouldn't function at a higher level than casual ones. The issue is that first, the game is all but unplayable now if you don't have a specialized build, and second, even many of the specialized builds are functionally useless, and only a few (i.e. heavy guns) allow you to play with any degree of ease. Which, in a fairly casual game, is not particularly fun.
---
Random
---
I’ve been playing on and off since release
---
I only just finished the collect all games atom challenge YESTERDAY 🎉
---
tbf he said you dont need an OP legendary weapon. OP weapons are legendary but not all legendaries are OP.
---
Ripper or chainsaw?
---
I don’t know actually, I’m sure there’s gonna be a LOT of legal fees and lawyers involved. It’s supposed to clear up by Friday.
---
Portland has been worse with an AQI of 500+ (we hit 270ish in Seattle the other day)
---
Same. My favourite was myself and this other guy after everyone else decided to not fight and leave. Was great fun!
---
This is so surprising, did they not test this for anyone other than 100+ level meta players? My wife plays with me occasionally and she had a hard enough time with how it was before, I can't see a casual player putting up with even more bullet sponge BS.
---
Really sad they felt like the only way to nerf overpowered builds was to nerf EVERYTHING.
---
Yes but that’s ok with me because I’m still burned out from last season. My trophy this season is the super sledge skin and then I will throttle back.
---
Hmmm... I will do this when I get on later
---
Different strokes for different folks I guess.
---
I like it because this is the first time I am even using melee weapons in my playthrough. Necessity to play differently than usual is rather plus for me.
---
It's not as good as Season 1, but I wouldn't say it sucks. The camp items are pretty cool and the PA Jetpack is awesome.
---
Do you have Pacifist Mode turned on?
---
I don't follow: you say you want versatility. If you trap yourself in an exclusive setup it's on you, not on legendary perks.
---
Last night I visited someone’s camp and in their vending machine they had 982,615,806 fusion cells for sale. How is that possible? I mean I’m scrapping things I want to keep just so I can make room in my stash to sell more stuff, but this person has 4 million pounds worth of ammo in theirs? I’m less concerned with how he got all that than I am with how he has space to put it all in his vending machines.
---
I'm same totally agree I used to walk jacked to the max all my damage perks on. Able to kill anything and everything. But I started to play more and more and the time gating made me have so many legendary's my stash and my character we're maxed so I started to turn to a food build 600 carry weight and loads of stuff on me day to day and a magic shotgun was all I needed. Need to fight Queen or Earl jump in power armour and swap in my heavy damage heavy gunner perks and just run overweight till event was over and swap back. My biggest problem was I need the perk loads out to swap quickly. Now I've just had to make another character dump everything on to it and just have nothing but the bare essential on my character at all times.  So I can keep my elite build on constantly.
---
I haven’t played my melee characters yet, so I can’t say from personal experience. What I have heard from other players is that instigating and anti armor feel a lot better. Sneak is basically a must in order to get the build to work effectively now. I would say following this build is still about the best you are going to get. Legendary perks kind of ignored melee so hopefully there will be buffs to bring it back in line with commando and heavies. As long as you still plan on being high health this build is going to be just about the max damage you can get. Remember that you can always tweak it latter if you don’t need as much damage output or want to be tanker.
---
TLDR: Yes
---
They increased time to down enemies but also increased rewards. If you require a lot of stimpacks and whatever...so what?
---
It's already very easy to get tons of ammo and stimpacks, i am swimming in them. 
---
So no it's not made to be "grindy" the increased rewards show you that.
---
What build do you have?
---
I hate the bugs more tbh - I could deal with the budget if my CAMP didn't bug out every other time I tried to change a few things. A bigger budget would definitely help though.
---
idk about you dude but being 300+ I had alot of perks to sift through. I eventually stopped moving cards around and ignored anything over level 0
---
and that was with 50+ perk packs unopened. could only imagine how cluttered it would have been if I opened those too.
---
Until recently if you had every rank of a card and then got that card from a pack it would delete. It’s been in the game since launch
---
I know it’s atom shop but I’ve been swingin this giant torch around like nobody’s business man😂
---
Aqi= air quality index?? Measure how bad the smoke is?? Yeah ive seen pics from both places thats insane, id hope the people responsible feel bad about singlehandedly adding to the chaos of 2020....
---
One thing that I really want them to change or increase is stash storage. At the beginning of the game, you feel like you have a lot, but later on you start getting more gear and junk, and that stuff is heavy. Just 800 isn’t enough. Sure they added the scrap box, but that’s only for fallout 1st members, and I don’t exactly feel like paying $13 a month when they could just add more space for free. I can barely do anything cause my storage is constantly full and my character is super close to being over encumbered
---
Lol I remember the grind/struggle so I try to make it just a bit easier for others. Granted, I don't do it every time I see a level 5 about. Just when I've got the time and am feeling a bit generous.
---
Like I said, not really seeing a significant increase in the quality or value of loot yet ... but maybe I will.
---
Glaive can't be traded, dropping it will destroy it, like the plan. It looks like they gave it the same flag as the bullion items since you can buy mod plans for it from the bullion vendor.
---
Damn that's really unfortunate.
---
God, I already hated floaters. 😓
---
I too am enjoying this patch. Honestly I like it better than the wastelanders update. I was hit hard by the new damage calculation on two of my characters but  i won't be getting under leveled god rolls anymore. Its nice that as a low HP build I can get use  out of weapons I likely would have fed to the grinder previously. Looking at you Vampires and Anti Armor.
---
the update required a change in gameplay. I (too) was getting bored of one shotting most and just waltzing around everywhere w/o a care in the world.
---
Now I am not even able to take out a mirelurk queen w/o dying 15 times.
---
The first Daily Ops I did -- first two, I didn't have a melee weapon worth beans and the mobs were the type that needed that... AND I didn't understand that the first time through, I just thought geez I'm gathering quite a crowd -- until they mowed me down.
---
Going through the normal grinds of whiterun and all now seems challenging again, no more one shotting the level 91 deathclaw matriarch anymore.
---
I understand what is being said about multi player. 
---
But I should be forced either to play in groups that's why I had (cxld subscription) today fallout1st. About to uninstall as we speak. I have Been playing for 10 mo. Only this game. 
---
Like you said I enjoyed my Stealth build. I didn't have to go home for days. I will forage for my food, Explore,raid and go home create More ammo. I could crouch next to a gulper and I would be safe  until Last night had to put all workshops machines on top of preexisting building near Nuka plant. Stay out of reach mole rats at least. Schorched tore my Camp up. So I did not even entertain the idea of fixing it.
---
Guns were broken. Had run out ammo and stimpaks forced to go to CAMP or workbench to constantly fix my guns middle of missions. Go back enemies respawn. Run low ammo,fix guns, fix Armour. Fight whatever is in your CAMP. Nerf of stealth and my shotty is been deadly to my character. And my other account didn't even bother opening Last night. Ended turning off. Got my money back from Fallout1st and uninstall. Nice ppl I've met here. I am literally holding back my tears here.   But I will not be playing this game in this condition.
---
Yeah I noticed my E fixer tanked a little as well.  I always used a backup shotgun anyways and would charge into situations a lot more lately so I’ll just switch.  I did notice that my shotgun is having a little more trouble after the patch as well so hopefully giving it a boost with perks will help.
---
2 shot Fixer  &gt; 2 shot combat rifle &gt; non legendary Fixer.
---
It's the faster movement speed while sneaking.   Plus I think the damage might be slightly higher than a combat rife.
---
What build would you recommend now?
---
Wow so if you want it you essentially need to have good luck?
---
Kind of a quality/quantity thing. There are less things I'm excited about, compared to S1, but I'm excited about them more than I was the things from S1.
---
I do that, but sometimes acid or plastic is needed. I didn't have much free space.  
---
Do you think this is acceptable?
---
More details, please. What type of attack did they use?  Did you have Pacifist enabled?  Do you have any AOE mutations like Electrically Charged?
---
don't know about that. I focused on the special perks so I don't have it maxed, but if adrenaline is anything to go by, I was getting nowhere near the expected 565 with max adrenaline. more like 400 something.
---
unless follow though is applied differently, it's still a massive difference.
---
I've seen a lot of lower level players now crying the Blues because their level 20 character is now facing off against level 20 mobs &amp; not super low level trash that can be used to build up reserves....lmfao. Be careful what you ask for!
---
Yeah, just look wherever a magazine spawns ot may be a game, also no player can hold duplicates so you are unlikely to see them traded.
---
Indeed it is. You get near-immunity to damage from robots in exchange for the loss of attribute points. After dying two times (and coming close about half a dozen more) in today's op against the raiders, I consider this more than a fair exchange.
---
Nah screw that.
---
I want a Duke nukem animation with a full face kick.
---
I just found out I have a fancy AA, limb damage and it's magic
---
Um.....are you stupid?
---
Didn't i just tell you how the rewards are increased?
---
 More experience and guaranteed level 50 legendaries instead of getting level 25 ones because the enemies level was lower. 
---
You saying you are not really seeing a significant increase is a bit daft. 
---
A significant increase would be imbalanced. Snowball effect.
---
Fireproof 3 and it was easier than collision course. Did it in 7.49, solo. Vampire shotgun and Unyielding Marine.
---
To be honest, with the upcoming adjustment to thirst/hunger having no negative effects, it’s not as useful in my opinion.  And Disease Cures are pretty easy to make and stock up on.
---
It’s a nice convenience perk, but not my cuppa.
---
In a way if you tend to wonder off into high level zones where you shouldn’t and die a lot pre-wasteland
---
I’m experimenting with using it and taking Starched Genes off, since I’ll never need to use radaway or an decon shower ever again.
---
The game is flaky af in many ways. If i have anything i dont want to lose in my junk, gotta make sure it gets to stash asap.
---
Heavy gunner/power armor
---
It was named Stab ‘N Jab. It’s favorite pastime was one shotting the Blood Eagles outside my camp. Now the bastards are nearly immune to the blood letting effects of it’s mediocrity. RIP Stab ‘N Jab. May you rest now it the rusted metal arms of the Protectron Vendor at the Top of the World train station.
---
I feel the same way!
---
wait 6 months for the bug fix?, dunno that sucks. respec heavies for a while
---
Just came behind and assault rifle or fixer shot me from the noise I do have charge on but that didn't proc as there was no melee or effects from it as they were a bit away from me
---
I don't think "easier" is the right word. I would say more efficient, from my experience anyway. 
---
However, my experience is limited to level 40-50 and upwards. But in those ten levels I found that experience was tailored to me, no matter where I was. Instead of taking Sunshine Meadows with the ghouls being level 1 or 14 and giving shit experience while being boring (hunting them down and one shotting them) I have to put a little more effort into making sure I don't alert all of them (stealth sniper build) so they don't gang up and kill me... So in that aspect it's a bit harder than before, but with the experience gained from enemies that match my level I have found I was leveling a bit faster.
---
This is just my experience though. I'm sure it will change depending on your play style
---
I beleive its applies differently since its more of a debuff. I have it maxed but didnt record numbers before and after equiping it. But i should be able to test it later tonight if you would like.
---
Time to scrap them, problem solved
---
Yep, the resilient high level gutsys shredded me, after 4 deaths I managed to reach the signal repeater to start the op, after another few deaths without even being able to find the next uplink I gave up. The new one with the blood eagles, I solo'd fine, zero deaths and 9.30 time. Very different experiences lol
---
Still haven’t done a daily ops - I am a stealth build and haven’t converted into something else yet! Legendary perks are very nice, I’m hoping for more as time goes on, as the selection is pretty small and seemingly not that “legendary”
---
10 minutes? and you think that's a good time? I was soloing him in under 5 without really trying the previous patch.
---
I also hope you were both sneaking, otherwise follow through won't trigger.
---
U lucky b****d, those are the rewards I'm after
---
That’s weird. Mines is instant almost.  Like a one se nod felt
---
I just think they should have added it as a new weapon for the bos update and made the ammo 7.62 for it since that ammo was excluded for some reason.
---
I had a feeling you weren’t the one that did it lol. That’s why I didn’t name you specifically. A lot of people are on here complaining about the new patch, which is understandable. However, these same people aren’t even asking for help either. It seems most people just want a super easy game to play casually I guess🤷‍♂️.
---
From the guy who stated “Every player’s experience is different” ladies and gentlemen ...
---
there's your answer.
---
It’s a raid boss. The fuck kind of raid boss lasts 5 minutes. Earl was a major joke pre nerf due to insane damage we could get.
---
Um, what?  You can have duplicates of holotape games. 
---
Or am I going crazy?
---
Might have been a mod you read and not the actual plan.  Like light weight marine legs might be the mod, marine legs are the actual leg plans.
---
If not,  then i have no idea.
---
None of that stuff is that hard, and you don't have to carry alot on you at all times anyway.   Other perks are so much more useful....  like the SPECIAL ones that can allow you to equip more really excellent, regular perk cards.
---
Yes. Exact same setup as before. Also forgot to mention we always have rank 3 inspirational up.
---
It was already way too easy, when I got the game I hit level 100 in 2-3 weeks, way too soon. Granted I was off chops at the time due to relationship issues and staying up all night while the kids were asleep, no I didn't do any of the stereotypical raged up junkie shit I still have a solid head on my shoulders and love my kids (and ex, at the time) too much to let it affect me like that, but this update has made the game so much better and if it takes more effort to hit 50 then that's a good thing.
---
Had no issues completing the mission itself. Never died once, even solo. Got Elder no problem with a team.  
---
However getting under 8 mins seems impossible solo, the nodes don't fill quickly enough with only one person there.
---
The main problem I have is the rewards. There... aren't any? Even with Elder rank I got nothing noteworthy or worthwhile. Is that supposed to happen?
---
Unfortunately the casual market is not where Todd gets his money from. It's whales and obsessed daily players that are the money makers so they are the percieved target audience from a marketing perspective.  
---
It's just further proof that the people making decisions on major implementation don't actively play the game.
---
that would be nice, yes. thanks. so you're saying it's more like tenderizer instead?
---
😂 
---
That title lol 
---
I can't help myself thinking of a dude, steady in front his screen, the mouth wide open...
---
That title, a lil bit late on the news, gave me a good laugh, thank you lol 👍
---
I truly enjoy it and believe I feel the need. I literally changed my whole build around two months ago when purveyors sweet ass gave me a bloodied fixer. But whatever it’s just like when I played at launch, I’ll use so many different weapons now. I swear back then during launch I never got perk cards for weapons or paid attention to that stuff. I would use weapons that showed highest damage or if i had the ammo. I dropped legacies back then and prob scrapped so many god rolls because I didn’t know I didn’t follow this Reddit I didn’t watch fallout YouTube videos. I just played and I didn’t know legacies would be taken out but who cares. It’s fun and now instead of using the three fixers I got from purveyor I’ll dust off other ones and I got plenty. I’m usually maxed on stash and carry weight and 4 alts also. So it’s fun and I’m enjoying it.
---
&gt;Yeah, existing in different areas would account for why monsters are less organized or not as good as in other areas,the same as why human characters are stronger in those areas.
---
Just saying "it accounts for it" isn't really an argument. You haven't even attempted to explain why living around bears would explain such a dramatic difference between Super Mutants.
---
The reality is that both of these systems are contrivances of gameplay: imperfect approximations of an experience. In a real world, the most powerful monsters or enemies wouldn't congregate in specific areas or be confined by largely arbitrary boundaries. That is purely a gameplay experience. In reality, any given area would have monsters that were less and more dangerous.
---
Would some places be more dangerous than others? Of course; but the idea that Super Mutant Warlords completely avoid the Forest despite its bountiful resources is not realistic or "immersive".
---
&gt;And, yes, there's clearly two different populations in this sub and who use the game. One is the group this change suits, because they are divorced from any role playing element and just use the game like a shooter.
---
Setting aside that neither system is realistic...
---
This is a false dichotomy similar to the idea prevalent in many TTRPG circles: the idea that everyone is either a "min-maxer" or a "role-play", ignoring the way those two archetypes might overlap or intersect. Some players might only care about game mechanics and others might only care about role-play, but a great many fall somewhere in-between. One of my players is predominantly motivated by role-play and story, but she still enjoys the mechanics and wants her character to be effective and fun to play. She builds her characters with a balance of role-play and mechanics in mind.
---
I *am* a role-player. Not only do I enjoy the lore of Fallout, but I make backstories and personalities for my characters. When it came time to divvy up the gold in Wastelanders, I split it between the two factions, despite it being detrimental to the rewards I wanted - because my character would want to maintain a balance of power between Foundation and Crater.
---
But I do also care about gameplay. I can and have played games solely for their stories, but I prefer for the systems to be engaging and enjoyable. A role-playing game is still a game - and I want to have fun with it.
---
You can thank eBay and RMT. Expect all future weapon and armor additions to the game to be untradable .
---
ripper
---
Doesn't there have to be some type of attack on your part though like shooting or aoe from charge happening though? They didn't melee me and wasn't close enough to trigger it
---
I didn’t like that as a lvl 15 the game (rose) was sending me into areas full of max level enemies.
---
I run bloodied unarmed and have a fairly solid build, I was just running up and 2 hits later, they were exploding in my face, no issues whatsoever, then sprint to the next one. Ran it twice only used a stim once.
---
Absolutely loving it while my team mates were hiding and trying to shoot them and avoid the explosions with full health 😂
---
Does the galve plans act like the Gauss shotgun and Minigun? Crafting creates random legendary effects? Havent gotten the plans so im curious
---
Can someone explain how the displays allow players access to your stash? Whenever I walk up to someone’s weapon rack, magazine rack, or display case, I cannot interact with it. 
---
I get that the vendors are wonky, so I put them away... but idk why the displays.
---
It’s technically more efficient, but can be more challenging. You won’t be wasting time on level 1 scrub enemies giving you minor XP. But while you’ll get more XP you’ll need to be a bit more tactical in my opinion. 
---
YMMV.
---
What are you talking about? 
---
Everyone's experience is different because they have different goals and different things that make them happy. 
---
You are comparing apples and oranges.
---
Interesting
---
now imagine that with cave crickets. challenging content is fine and all, but remember that not everywhere is populated by ticks.
---
Shit was too easy Bro cmon, literally 1* full uny with a Lvl 40 mole miner gauntlet I was one hitting every enemy at level 50. I didn’t even have knowledge of cards then either I had straight food build cards, now ya gotta actually have a little skill (lol barely) and strategy, hopefully the whiny boys all leave the game since it’s so hard lolol , u really mad because your shotty isn’t doing 1200 damage anymore? My commando sent/ass build demolishes still I just gotta reload more now

They were just trying to help you upgrade your new legendary perks. Now you can turn that rank 3 perk card into 6 perk coins. Thanks for pointing this out. That's one more change I need to make to my perk load out. I definitely assumed a multiplier was still a multiplier.
---
Oh you thought, as a Bloodied build, you got hit hard? You have no idea, I have always run full health with TS and AA weapons and am chill with the update.
---
Are you out of fusion cores?
---
I think you’re onto something, I just checked out a leg piece I found and can add lightweight to it
---
If you are on xbox, I can give you the legs and helmet plans....for 2000 caps.
---
How do they access your stash through the displays?? I cannot interact with other players displays.
---
That sucks. I have a 98 Stealth UA that uses the named deathclaw gauntlet and she still just wrecks shit.  
---
Hopefully my sniper build will doesn't get weaker the higher level I get.
---
Both, unless I’m defending a spot, then I’ll remove traveling pharmacy for bullet shield or heavy gunner
---
 I just kept swapping to a light as hell melee weapon after shooting them. 
---
Thanks for reminding me that gun bashing is even a thing.
---
I've 1 hit them, too. Still annoying if there's a group of them, though lol.
---
I usually DM the lowlevels in my public teams and leave the plans in a suitcase at a train station
---
Shit i agree but send me a clip of that I call cap😂
---
Thanks.  It’s certainly more challenging.  Not looking forward to SBQ tussle.
---
How do they access your stash through displays and punch bowls?
---
I'm level 99 and I'm struggling a little. My weapons are just not good enough.
---
Did it solo in a similar time.
---
I'm not the best to ask, but if you're a struggling stealth sniper like I was, there's a few options you have:
---
- try a stealth-bloodied hybrid. find a bloodied lever action with some bolstering armor and you'll find yourself doing pretty immense damage.
---
- find an instigating lever action or gauss rifle, and pile on the "Follow Through" legendary perk. You'll find yourself still one-shotting or two-shotting enemies on the regular, just not as much as you used to
---
- switch over to a stealth commando build. find an anti armor or bloodied/junkie handmade or Fixer, and acquire all of the perks to boost full-auto weapons. you'll burn through more ammo but the time you spend killing higher-level creatures will be down over 50%
---
just my first few ideas. i personally am going option #2
---
the same kind who lasts 10 minutes? I mean, is there an official metric or something that I'm missing? Earle isn't particularly more 'raid-y' now than he was before. the only difference is that we have to waste a ton more resources to take him on.
---
Yeah that's understandable, but in all fairness the Savage Divide isn't really for lvl 15. They should have waited to give that quest until you're higher level, not cause unnecessary frustration.
---
Yea just like tenderizer, enemy receives 40%, youre not dealing 40% more.I beleive thats from all sources aswell. 
---
Im wondering if fallow through and taking one from the team are contributing to the explosive effecting seemingly being more powerful now. But havent done any testing and am just theorizing about that
---
No amount of spinning the drum will win me over to using that piece of crap.
---
Hi, was hoping for a response if I replied to you. I equipped max rank "what rads?" And I'm getting the same amount of rads I was before in a nuke zone.
---
Yep I’m on
---
Well I got elder twice yesterday and today ..finished it under 8 minutes 6 times ...nothing...
---
It does affect project paradise but I'm not sure the animals are notably bulkier at all
---
Normally do the same but I'm on a private server. Just got a level 25 in here so I'm fixing to make it rain for them. Lol
---
See my post above, better inventory and save everything are fine.
---
If you're on PC I'll give you a bunch of 5mm or weapon to compensate, if you wanted.
---
I was in one of those rare public teams last night where all 4 of us had mics. I had one guy begging to get revived after he went chasing gutsys and died in the water at the very edge of the circle. I told everyone else to stay put in the circle and told him to just hang out until the timer expired and forced him to respawn. Of course one of the other dude decided to ignore me and went out to revive dude #1, getting himself killed in the process. I told them the uplink gauge still shows 4 people in the zone and that they should just effing stay there and conserve ammo and stims until their timer runs out, and they finally got it. 
---
We ended up finishing that run in like 8:45, which was a bit infuriating knowing it could have been successful if they listened. I guaranteed them we could do it in under 8 minutes if they did what I said, and sure enough we ran it again and nailed it in just under 7 minutes.
---
Literally entered the vault, immediately in my stealth mode, walk down the stairs: Hidden...Danger...missile to my face...dead
---
Lol def cap on that
---
Maybe a legendary perk card swap for more strength and traveling pharmacy are in order!
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
It would be nice if you did because so far no one has seriously taken me up on the offer to actually check the math or their character to prove or refute anything I've said.  I have no clue if my numbers are right but instead of checking most people settle for "live with it" or accusing me of respecing my character a hundred times and forgetting.
---
“They increased time to down enemies but also increased rewards.”
---
And yet everything takes longer to kill and drops the same loot as it used to. 
---
Except yes, legendaries which I run into once an hour or more are higher. 
---
Glad you’re enjoying it.
---
100% agree! I have every perk that can benefit a stealth rifleman and good weapons, etc. None of that has changed, only One Wasteland, but between last week and today, with OW, I've experienced an effective 60-75% nerf. That's just insane. And I can kiss all the casual "fun" weapons I was using goodbye. It's heavy guns or nothing if I intend to get through any event or gameplay in a timely manner.
---
Ppl who do this are total scum bags... does the perk have to be leveled up all the way?
---
I'm enjoying the game more than ever. So many things to do and the feel of constant grinding is gone
---
No more carrying water to sell in order to replenish the fast travel cost :)
---
No if you pick up a duplicate it just disappears. So I have 6 of 8, but leave any that I already have for other players.
---
So since i had level one, two, and three of, lets say action boy/girl, then if i got it again from a pack, it would have been deleted? Not let me make two threes, or two twos, or just another 1 hanging around? Guess i should have paid more attention.
---
Ever since VATS got broken I've moved toward a stealth commando build; I was originally stealth sniper using an instigating lever-action to headshot mobs, but the unreliability of VATS (and hitboxes in general) have shown me that it's just easier to huck lead at something than try to take it out sneakily.
---
Probably why I see so many heavy gunners in this game.
---
I personally have a few Pipfall’s and like 11 Grognak games.  I think I have a duplicate of the nuka tapper that I bought from a vendor as well so it does happen
---
Well yeah from a more technical standpoint I still want my pipboy to sort out things better too instead of having all my foods and meds clumped together.
---
Me too!
---
It's only the first one of a daily event, I'm sure you'll find ones you enjoy even after a rocky first impression.
---
Had this same issue and some angel from heaven posted that if you keep some regular ammo on you, same ammo type as your primed weapon. So regular.556. Just need a few bullets. It should work when you switch to your primed handmade now.
---
I have a primed fixer and handmade, and I keep 10 bullets of regular.45 and.556 on me. And the weapon switch hot key works every time now. 
---
So you won’t pull out some crappy golf club the next a level 100 comes storming after you...
---

Appreciate it. I still think of her often even without this ill reminder. The day I found her was actually the 13th of this month in 2014. A little black kitten on Friday the 13th 😂
---
Wait what, I got the same damm robots again same rolls too.  But yesterday was the burrows today was vault 94 today.
---
This! I was telling the same to my partner. More armor paint, useless picture poses and player icons. The only thing I'm playing for is the greenhouse set and it's at 99 unfortunately. Ill use none of the other things on this board.
---
After you beat it on Elder the only rewards are the things in the upper left of the screen: stims, radaway, ammo, and assorted legendary stuff.
---
Saw 2 in a vendor that were just called The Fixer. Didn't buy it,  felt like a rename. Guess i should have biught it.
---
If you have been feeling this way since about tuesday this week....
---
You might want to read the patch notes, your in for a hell of a ride.
---

---
I’ve argued for this as well.  Like.  If I can go for free to 76 and then cheaply to the fairgrounds.  Why charge me full
---
Price to go direct?  It just either makes me waste caps.  Or waste my time to do two loading screens.
---
Amazing for starting a new build and quickly getting it going
---
you understand the concept of subjectivity? before you could always just use a nocturnal mole miner gauntlet if you thought the game was too easy and wanted a bigger challenge.
---
now I have no option **but** to use the equivalent of a nocturnal mole miner gauntlet, because everything hits about as hard in patch 22.
---
Seriously? I assumed it was an intentional joke too! I've caught a couple of misspellings &amp; grammatical errors on a few tip screens and once on the news banner (I wish I'd screenshotted them), so maybe it was an actual legit mistake they fixed instead. How disappointing. Proofreading is important.
---
Yes, a known bug and affects more than just prime weapons.  Been with us for a while.
---
*scorched leader
---
you say that but if i recall in the forest you run into 2 if not 3 of the main enemy types right off the bat, so youre saying he should only fight scorched and run from robots and animals? sounds a bad way to tackle the new mechanic
---
Yeah this one was pretty manageable. Good fun.
---
I'm way late to this party, but I'm having the same issue. I got a couple compound bow plans, read them, learned them, but they don't show up on the weapons crafting bench.
---
thank you for taking the time to clarify &amp; i appreciate your explanation.
---
in ref to 1W (1wasteland):  while that may have been the intention, it may be that the level 24 needed to go fight level 1-5s before doing stuff even at their own "appropriate" level.  addlly, seriously asking: should players fresh out of the vault be able to fight/contribute on Scorched Earth?  idk im inclined to say no, but its def open for debate
---
in any case, i remember a dev from division 2 saying they like to over-tweak things in order to fine tune from there.  we will see how this plays out, but im certainly not enthused to see more bullet sponginess from the enemies.  (and these Daily OPs, yeeesh and oy vey i says!)
---
This update is just what this game needed. A lot of people are salty because it was a across the board damage reduction instead of just a meta nerf. This change is a good thing for the future of the game if they continue tweaking weapons.
---
Lost cabin. I have been getting all sorts of Marine plans there in the room with the bed next to the armor workbench. Just add it to your regular rotation. Added bonus chance for scavenger trader and bobbleheads and magazines
---
&gt; This sub is making me realize how bad the average player is.
---
I feel you.
---
Back in the day, when I was going to do my very first silo run, I was shitting bricks because of all the horror stories I'd read. People taking an hour or more in there, using tens of thousands of rounds of ammo, and having all their armor wrecked and broken.
---
When I actually did a silo run myself, I was surprised at how easy it was in comparison to all the stories I'd read about.  
---
I'm not really sure what's up with that - players having wildly different experiences like that. I'm guessing this game is really punishing if you don't have a well planned build and/or are missing a lot of important perks or decent gear.
---
i disconnected 3 times yesterday, one was in the middle of the daily ops and the other two were during the loading screen.
---
I'm mostly unbothered but seeing roaches and eye bots over level 10 is bizarre
---
Base damage is higher in a fixer
---
“10/10 would shit my self again”
---
Excellent
---
Where did you encounter them? My alt is lvl 15 now, I’ve just passed the Fire Breathers exam. Every enemy has been the same level as me
---
Changes are great, don't need to take all the DMG increase perks anymore
---
The benefit of the current setting is good xp anywhere and also max level drop from all places any event, no more level 35 god rolls if you’re above 50. I think this is a huge plus. But no more laid back locations any more, this sucks if player just want to be casual and want to enjoy a wasteland theme park. Death could spawn right inside our camp 😱
---
GL. Let us know how you get on
---
Yea, most answers seem to include switching to commando.  The sniper game just takes so much more time now.
---
If your build is so horrible because you decided to willy-nilly take perks that don’t help you kill things, yes
---
Yeah they definitely need to add more legendary perks, but I'm happy with the selection for now because it isn't too overwhelming. I was thinking a stealth build might be cool if someone were to use a stealth boy and sneak ahead to the checkpoints while the team tears mobs and catches up. But not sure if that would actually work. Hopefully you get a build that's fun to play through.
---
Recently switched to Bloodied PA and i had no problem at all. PA makes the explosion do almost no damage.
---
Woooowwwwwww, many thanks for that heads up that is daft :( just hoping they don't break the perk when  they fix it i maxed out as I'm quite tanky and its nice to help out
---
It's so wild seeing such hugely differing opinions about One Wasteland. Some people say it's completely unplayable and others (like you and me) dig it. I'm fighting groups of ghouls and instead of just blasting them and moving on, I'm worried about crippling legs, etc to gain an advantage instead of brute force.
---
Yes, but previously I could just travel to an area with high level enemies if I wanted to get better loot and level up ... now I’m wasting more ammo all over as I’m just trying to play game missions and wander. This is the difference between an RPG mentality and an MMO mentality. I don’t care if I get to level 400 ... I’m not playing to level up as fast as possible or get to some nonexistent end game. I’m playing to enjoy a Fallout game.
---
I will thank you. And congrats on your time
---
&gt;I’m not gonna go die to get rev perk to reduce the time or anything else that boosts ddamage such as stacking adrenaline with bloat flies. 
---
that's what I meant by 'not really trying'. I wasn't doing any of those things.
---
but my point is that Earle is indeed too tanky after the nerf. that's 5 more minutes than me pre-patch, with 1 more person at that. 5 more minutes of wasted resources.
---
you shouldn't be trying to make a point that Earle isn't tanky or that the nerf isn't too bad considering it took you and your friend 10 minutes to down him.
---
Depending on your build you can use a handmade or fixer and walk out with more than you started with as well. It takes ~6-7 shots with my VE handmade to take down one of the robots, and each one was dropping 12-24 rounds of ultracite 5.56. After a few trial runs I wanted to see how much I actually got, so I did another test run with my buddy, tracked what I started with, and made sure to loot everything I could before leaving the area. I started the mission with exactly 5k rounds and walked out with 5,247.
---
improved health bars did, but it was updated today.
---
Treasure Hunter watch out! Oh God, he’s got his radio on, he can’t hear us.
---
I rarely encountered enemies above my level, and when I did i either popped a couple of chems and strapped in, or I came back later.
---
One of my more fond memories of 76 was just stumbling upon a level 40 Assualtron when i was level 20. Now that was a tough, challenging, and memorable fight.
---
But what One Wasteland did was make everything your own level. So you no longer have the chance on stumbling into areas above your level, and given the choice of fighting for your life for extra loot. Now just, everyone everywhere is your level, and its become a challenging bland slog instead of a mix of low and high levels contrasting
---
Yeah I stopped in after the patch and I didnt do much. I see they fixed the ammo converter so I basically sold a bunch of stuff, got more 5.56 and .45 for my main guns, then I went up to morgantown station to sell my water. Then I decided to have fun at morgantown airport. This is a low level area so I pulled out my .38 gun i use for forest interactions....and then despite having a 3* anti armored explosive pipe gun, it literally took 5 shots to kill ghouls. What gives? Even switching to my main weapons it still took 2-3 shots to kill, which is kind of insane for such enemies. Like I get they're level 50, but I'm use to just freaking 1 shotting base level enemies like they're nothing, even in high level areas. 
---
I havent tried an actual hard enemy but if it scales the same way....uh...yeah, this might be too hard. I feel like my stealth is useless now and it's like killing enemies without stealth again. They're tanky, and knowing how some areas of the game just MOB you with enemies, this might be a bit too difficult at times. 
---
making enemies tanky for the sake of making the game harder isnt really a good thing. Especially given how some areas of the game operate. If I were at whitesprings rather than screwing around morgantown and i got spotted, i'd be in deep crap with this new formula. Even without being spotted my weapons just arent super effective any more. I had to make sure my perks were correct but they are. I really am doing like only 200 damage with a maxed out explosive lever action. I really am only doing 150 with my 5.56 rifle. 
---
Yeah, this kinda screws up my entire play style to some extent. I dont like these changes.
---
If you are worried about ammo... try out the daily OP today - blood eagles with exploding ability. I used vats to aim at heads, put on the fireproof perk to survive the booms, and walked out of there with thousands more railroad spikes than I had when I arrived. 
---
It also was magnificent chaos, most fun I've had in this game for a while, chain explosions are always fun.
---
Okay
---
This is what I did for a brief moment, than realized that I only had 1/2 a fusion core in my inventory. Made me regret being a VATS focused build
---
I like it. Hotkeyed the syringe and I never have to carry food/water again, and with just one rank I can keep Well Fed/Hydrated benefits going most of the time. It's nice having a legendary perk I don't have to hurry upgrading, too...
---
Maybe when thirst/hunger penalties are finally removed I'll swap it out, but I haven't decided yet
---
Also, its not really balancing if youre gonna spam WAY more enemies than before
---
At this Chinese temple, where the guided meditation event is
---
Right, I understand your point.   Yes, I generally play in a public world unless one of 2 specific friends is on and we play private.  
---
I also generally prefer to  play solo, and generally don’t join/create  teams unless there is a specific daily/weekly challenge requiring it.  to that end, I definitely understand where you are coming from.
---
(More often than not, I forget to unequip lone wanderer even when on a random team.)
---
Even in a private world, you can still create a public team - while it will be a team of 1, you will still get some of the bonuses for doing X while on a team - kill critters, take workshops, things like that, just not the random benefits of whatever cards the others are sharing, or the bind bonus.    Pretty sure take on for the team works even if you are on a team of 1.
---
So you are right that it does not benefit you as much/makes it more difficult.  Like me, gotta toy around with the legendary perks to make up for the changes. 
---
   My build is melee/sniper, with high STR and PER, but very low CHR and LCK.   Added the legendary luck card so I could add bloody mess2 for 10% bonus damage.  (Offsets the increased Damage to kill the new higher level enemies.)
---
  Added additional INT to boost nerd rage (b/c the enemies hit harder)    Added what rads to offset the rad damage ghouls do.  (Now I take none.)
---
  Still experimenting with weapons to see if what worked best before still dO.  (Already found a couple that don’t.)
---
Name the perk Curb Stomper.
---
"Hold B to curb stomp radrat".
---
Yeah Im solo too. I mean what am i supposed to group up now? No more avoiding social interaction? Not cool, bethesda, not cool.
---
Yeah,  when i first started playing, i bought a plan and couldn't build the armor.  Then realized that was a mod and not the actual armor.
---
Yea and that’s the balance that’s now gone. If I was up for a fight bring out the big guns jump in the Power Armor and go look for a fight. Now I’ll need that just to go farming for all the ammo I’m going through.
---
I run a Power Armor heavy, no food, no build. PA and perks. It doesn't feel like any change to me, save for i can make a shit load of ammo to feed my guns. Switching between AA and TS gat gauss doing just fine
---
We ran Project Paradise last night. Happy to say we’re no longer sleepwalking through it. Yeah, cave crickets were nasty but so was everything else. Level 100 deadly honey beasts glowing red? Never seen this before and it made the event that much cooler. I died by liberator last night. Not taking any enemies for granted anymore and has increased the experience greatly. Leveled up 3 times last night and hit level 260 just screwing around.
---
Really depends if you wanna run high health id go with a JE sniper of some sort or AA, and if you wanna do the most possible damage id go with something like a BE sniper, levers are very good as well as they are faster and can still be used as a sniper.
---
As someone who has specifically put time into having answers for robots, I did not
---
It was infinitely more enjoyable though lol
---
lucky... I've been trying to collect a fatman with each of the legendary effects and that's one of the ones I'm missing.
---
with the new legendary ammo card I can now run around yeeting nukes left and right without worrying about ammo too much. though repairing is a bitch.
---
I logged into reddit to say how much this game has just changed for the better. If this glitch is back that would be so disappointing. 
---
I legit just had the best few hours playing this game since I bought it.
---
Exploding blood eagles...actually hilarious.
---
7:15 solo today, but I did practice in PTS, what did I get ....burrows signs, thanks :-)
---
Love the update though!!
---
Either keep for future alt character or to sell/trade for better bloodied stuff if needed
---
That’s strange. I compared my damage stats pre and post update and they’re off by maybe 15-20 points per shot? I use AA, V, and F handmades and am also above lvl 100.
---
I think saying they don’t do “diddy” is a bit of an exaggeration. As far as full health builds go (AA, F, V) were nerfed mildly-I do 85 damage per shot with a VFFR Handmade when I used to do 91.
---
This is the kind of daily ops I want to see more of... fast paced, chaotic, fun.
---
They got sick of your posts whining about the Taxi fare. ;-)
---
Ugh, I hate this mentality. Seriously. Most of us here aren't freaking MMO vets who like to go on these long raids with like a dozen other people. We're FALLOUT fans. Most fallout games before this are single player. While having multiplayer elements to this game is fun when you scale the game in a way to screw solo players to force group play, you're kinda alienated much of your core audience. I havent played in months but I did come back given a 18 GB patch today just to see what was changed. I dont like the changes. At this rate I'm far more inclined to go back to 3, 4, or new vegas than this new forced coop model of 76 they're trying to ram down our throats.
---
Ok, consider moving your camp to a non enemy spawn location.
---
I get what you are saying about this being an escape. Yeah for me too. 
---
Look at adding some damage resist perk cards. It's really not that bad with a good build. I  have done 3 daily ops today, and cleaned out whitesprings and west tec, only does once. 
---
If you are sub level 100, then yeah might be a rough ride.
---
Your argument was they made this update to make the game more grindy.
---
I provided proof that they didn't do it for those reasons since they rebalanced rewards to be increased and give you faster progress towards a awesome level 50 legendary. 
---
Getting more consistent higher level legendaries is arguably a good trade off for wasting more bullets or time. 
---
Ammo and consumables are easy to come by.
---
You don't have to be Bloodied to enjoy this game. Am a stealth rifleman with a AAE lever only takes a 2 to 3 headshots to kill if I don't crit. Bloodied got effected the most. Do in theory it should help characters that are unoptimized since bonus DMG doesn't add as much as it used to.
---
Most are just crying because their Bloodied weapons don't 1 shot everything and are too lazy to put the effort in to actually playing the game.
---
Sneak and Perception definitely have problems that started around the time we got the circles for mobs and squares for NPCs &amp; players change on the compass.  There was also a "fix" to Unyielding having to do with sharing perks with effective CHA instead of base CHA that might be related.  There are still a lot of bugs from that time including VATS issues.
---
But the game was always intended to be social, Daily Ops are basically dungeon instances like other MMORPGs.  I think dungeons and raids are par for the course with MMORPGs and I'm glad BGS is trying them out.  Sure they can use refinement, but you can already see them trying the idea of needing different builds on the team to complete the objective, like you need Tank, Healer and DPS in other MMORPGs.
---
If this brings in more players that's good for all of us as it keeps BGS interest in supporting the game.  If you have ideas about how to make world exploration more atmospheric and lonely - maybe in certain areas - send them your feedback!  I agree these NPCs everywhere are kind of annoying.  How many wood piles do they really need to chop away at?  We need variety in the "feel" of different map areas.
---
No there not, not at all. Seriously if your weapon is useless it's because of your setup, not the nerf. My build just got me though the daily op solo, rewarded elder tier to. Not bragging by any means but a good build will still be good, even with mediocre weapons.
---
AAE is probably the best one other than Bloodied
---
Ahhh....ok.. right on.  Thanks mate. Cheers ✌
---
I took 2 levels in three hours and I'm level 400ish
---
Jesus Christ guys is anyone going to tell OP about the perk card paintrain?
---
That barely classified as a bug since they nerfed strength so much!
---
I doubt they're going to fix the broken sneak this quickly...
---
You can sort by weight, might help you pinpoint the issue.
---
Got ya covered chief, I already do
---
Ah. I'm a power armor boy with an explosive plasma gatling.
---
My bow only character is only level 30, and I still don't have a legendary, but for me at least, any enemy in melee range can't be hit by me, even in vats, I watch the arrow constantly fly away from the reticle. And the reticle for bows is terrible for compensating for arrow drop. Basically I carry around a bow and a crossbow, and if the bow doesn't kill it, I have to panic swap to the crossbow, or get swarmed. How did you combat this.
---
I tried again and had a great time!! This time I brought a friend.  I shot the robots down to 1%, he whacked them with a sledge hammer.  It worked brilliantly!
---
I like this idea, I think they should add more FO4 prefixes like the freezing, burn affect, plasma, acid all those fun prefixes could really spice the game up for sure.
---
Because they didn’t want players to have an “easy button” to Max the event every time.
---
Budget is necessary until we get instanced shelters, possibly even then keep somewhat of a limit on it. Out in the open though, larger camps can create some issues, especially with certain types of camp items. This is why we have limits on lights, gens, etc. That's also why these items take up more budget when placed than others (eg. each individual light taking up 1% budget. That adds up quick.)
---
I feel like budget wouldn't be as bad if they reworked some things like displays counting both towards budget AND stash space.
---
There is some adjustment to be made if we are used to long standing builds, everything had changed.
---
Sneak attacks have been broken fore since the patch!
---
I’m still getting the fast travel bug, blue screened once, had server disconnection and also had to restart the game but I played from 2-10 cos I ended up rebuilding my house. Took forever, so not too many issues over the course of my session but they’re still there, so is whitesprings lag. I’m still mostly upset that my bloodied unarmed melee got nerfed 75%. It’s essentially useless at events, just a stimpack disposal system now.

To add to that I thought the public teams was such a great addition. I generally played solo as well but some events I could just never do alone. Now I join an events team, don’t have to talk to anyone and can still play with people that have the same objective as me and accomplish more than I could alone.
---
And locked sneak out of ops.
---
Pa gives better damage reduction and protection, fire protection is a non issue, lol.
---
I got 29 full fusion cores left. Dropped them, picked them back up... Although now that you mention it, it appears a New fusion core can not load into the armor,  not even manually. Not in my other PA's either.
---
Instigating and bloodied, swap from one to the other after the first shot!
---
Amen
---
I wonder. Do you play games that bosses only last like a minute of fighting him? Wasted resources to get loot that specific boss or some event is common place.
---
Besides resources means nothing. I’m sitting on 10k+ ammo and nothing to use it on. Resources are extremely easy to make especially with the new ammo legendary perk.
---
It’s not about how fast you do it. It’s about how fun it is. Everyone definition of fun is different. I rather fight a boss for 10 minutes with some sort of difficulty then one that can die in 10 seconds.
---
Just QoL. And no build. I just roamed around with an anti-amor SMG for lows , shotgun for mediums, and if I happened to come across anything that was even close to a fight my .50 cal. I just scavenge for the most part , not into the whole trying to be OP’d
---
My weapons are doing just fine....anti-armor appears to be better even.
---
I thought the whole idea of the perk card system was to be able to swap them out and run alternate builds without having to create new characters. I understand what you're saying though. It's a pain.
---
8:04 first attempt (killed myself shooting a wall next to me, twice)
---
7:15 round 2 ....burrows sign reward, thanks Todd :-)
---
Yeh I thought I was a bad ass soloing it under 8 minutes but turns out alot of ppl did, still can't understand why people think this update was bad, damage is still good, the game is at points a little harder but I appreciate it alot more.
---
One rare reward roll per day as far as I understand, makes sense I guess. We can farm the ops for xp etc which is nice.
---
The downvotes lol, this sub sometimes.. smh
---
Rifles, pistols and melee have been obliterated!
---
Okay, but the other option is not getting to play it.
---
I think you crossed a "min level-border"
---
Wait what you lot got something different today I got the same bloody robots with same mutations. Just in vault 94
---
So this probably won't be helpful, but...
---
I horde good weapons. When I get a weapon, either through a drop or vendor, it falls into 1 of 4 catetgories:
---
1: keep for my main for use or testing
---
2: keep because it is an amazing roll, just not for me. I store these on mules.
---
3: good, but not for me. I vend these.
---
4: scrip. 
---
I have a nice Junkies collection, and I'm a bloodied build. Maybe someday I'll change. Also, sometimes the meta changes. Bloodied took a huge nerf and AAE is now viable, for example.
---
Dense unyielding SS chest piece and Fireproof worked just fine too.
---
Some areas have min level and some max :-)
---
Would it make sense to complete it in each type of difficulty then so you get 3 chances at the reward with increasing likelihood each time?
---
Much more fun than the last one. Got elder alas two team mates didn't get a reward from it.
---
That seems about, a level 30 scorched isn't hard for your level. it's probably a.crown enemy
---
Once it’s done, you don’t get the extra rewards for whatever rank you got previously, although it’s fairly decent rewards compared to other events and quicker if you get a good team.
---
I wonder what would happen if you drop more legendary items then the dedicated size of the drop pool for daily ops
---
I started a new character using as close to my original build as possible (lucky card draws notwithstanding). My level 12 character cleared Whitesprings easily. My level 42 character still can’t make a dent it it. That’s not indicative of the meta changing, it’s indicative of poor balancing. It should not be harder running the same build to be successful at level 12 and not at 42, regardless of if the game is online or not.
---
I have had people who I thought where good people do bad things to me, It not how the game is its life, you do know that you can't tell if someone is good or bad right off the bat right? you cant make friends if you don't take risks
---
Its goin to say its standard damage when not equipped. Don't even worry about the dps icon on the weapons menu.
---
Absolutely my games room looks forward to them. Totally will finish my Camp. Don't forget the "fussball" table, great addition for Europe, we grew up playing that.
---
I  had enough Coins from deleted Cards.
---
To get  me maxed out  Ammo/Infiltrator and get up to tier 3 with Strength.
---
Then I  run out of Coins.
---
Then it hit me.
---
I had 170 + unused perk card points i had not used.
---
I simply filled up my pack again with other Perk cards then deleted them again.i think the last tier of strength needed 150 perk coins.
---
Yes. If you had all the levels then any dupes would be deleted
---
I mean my power armor and gat laser are still shredding hard and pa feels really good now. Overall I'm happy I just want more than just buffing underperforming weapons damage and I think CC could go a long way.
---
Sometimes I accidentally hit space trying to jump away and immediately die lol
---
Are you over encumbered or using blocker?
---
My heavy gunner struggled with all the bopping needed for daily ops omg. More like daily boops &amp; oops.
---
I feel like we are all playing different games, I am also a casual player, not an optimizer, and I haven’t been feeling that much of a change, sure I now encounter higher level enemies, but they are easy to kill anyway, maybe a bullet or two more (not bloodied or junkie, plain old commando/heavy, not even stealth)
---
You get one roll per rank each day, so 3 rolls per day - afaik
---
Yeah.  And this choice just got me to uninstall the game.
---
what if my intention to play this game was ( esp. now with private servers) solo and use it for exploration and building. and you went for mostly hoarding perks youre now punished for playing it one way and may not actually be able to respec because of how you originally wanted to play the game not everyone is here to put the SBQ down in 10 seconds and have ACP on rotation. some people just wana chill.
---
But think of that half a fusion core you'll save!
---
Because they're working on stealth ops somewhere in the background? Nah, not unless they see this comment, like the idea, and the community doesn't.
---
But the tea time mobs are all lvl 50 now, assuming you’re &gt;lvl 100 player. Shouldn’t they cost more ammo? Played it yesterday too with a two man group and we almost failed it. I liked that risk myself honestly.
---
What's wrong with combat taking longer when they increased rewards? Something being a grind doesn't make it bad.
---
 Also i don't buy the grind argument when you get rewarded more increased exp,consistent level 50 legendaries,etc.
---
Out of ammo? Use a melee weapon.  There are ways to obtain lead and steel that require minimal interaction with mobs.  Do the research.  Improvise, adapt, overcome.  Survival in the wasteland.  Also, the nerf isn't permanent, they will use our feedback to make adjustments.
---
I play bloodied and always seem to get junkies weps, can't find people to buy them fast enough. I decided the other day to dump them on the new character I was making for this season and just turn him into a junkie. People want what they want, you might not be able to sell what you got, so if you think they're good weps, keep them for another character.
---
Relatable.  I like the idea of having other people in the game, but that doesn't mean I want to interact with them lol. I just wanna sell them chems like the wasteland drug dealer I am lol
---
&gt;It’s not about how fast you do it. It’s about how fun it is. Everyone definition of fun is different.
---
indeed. your post reaks of subjectivity but at least you yourself pointed it out. and you know what's fun for me? not wasting a ton of resources or 10 minutes fighting a sponge.
---
but that's just me.
---
you also keep focusing on legendary perks like they're some godsend. you do know that follow through won't trigger unless everyone fighting Earle is sneaking, right? and I'm not clear on their interaction, but I think it doesn't stack with taking one for the team, either.
---
Supposedly the vendor bot at Watoga station can have the leg plans.
---
Only reason why I log on each day
---
A perfectly working detail: if you apply the torch skin to the All Rise super sledge, the heavy rocket mod goes over the torch, so it just looks like a sledge with a wooden handle.
---
That’s lame tho . Why have this whole map if I’m only gunna stay in one spot. It’s pointless
---
Wish Bethesda would do a re designed robot work bench and add it to the game.
---
Fuck the damage, this and Wallace being imprisoned are the real nerfs
---
Thank you! Yes, in my testing it seems much easier for low-level characters. From what people are saying, it’s about the same for high-leveled characters. Please share your observations when your friend gets around level 30-40. From comments, it seems like that’s where the balancing is failing.
---
Does the bar ever fully fill? I’ve had times where no reactors break and the bar still only gets to like 75%
---
I have terrible RNG luck,  but i do the same.  If it's a good roll but doesn't fit my build,  i keep it in case the meta changes.
---
First thing I did was go back there for nostalgia from running the raids all those times. It reminded me how interesting of an environment it was but it also made me sad. I feel like they made it generic and boring by removing all the puzzles, changing pathways and such that made it interesting. It would have actually been cool if they changed it up for daily ops like they did for the raids requiring you to go to different sections each time and making you hunt for the way forward. Or have you keep it from flooding while you're doing it.
---
Or maybe you know just bring back the raids now that we have matchmaking, proper instancing that works and a legendary perk that can make hacking super easy. Maybe without the stingwings though. Those things were the worst.
---
I played with a friend that didn't take any damage perks until we explained how hard he was gimping himself, I imagine there must be people like that on this sub that have nothing but QoL perks.
---
heard there’s a new dupe?
---
Yes, it’s not a bug, they just wanted revenge for their fallen.
---
What system u on and what ammo u use im a hoarder in game. And would like to help
---
Your right.  I have legendary armor with those effects, and I know they don’t carry over to PA.
---
 The items I mentioned are bonuses offered by standard perks or mods - if you have the points to add them.  If not, you would need to add the legendary Sepcial perk to boost a category so you can equip them.
---
I was.
---
It's not a mentality. It's a fact. 
---
It was how the product was blatantly marketed. I'm sorry you wanted a solo experience from a game that was never marketed as such. 
---
Your "mentality" is wrong. You wanted 76 to be something it wasn't. Something it was never marketed as. Get over it. You're wrong. 
---
They used phrases like "A different kind of Fallout experience"....
---
So I used my big ol' brain to come to the conclusion....that this was going to be a different kind of fallout experience. Shocking. I know.
---
I'm a FALLOUT fan. I am also a LOGICAL person. 
---
When Bethesda said "This is a MULTIPLAYER FALLOUT experience"..... Not once did I think "Sweet a new Single player Fallout game"
---
Why would they fix these issues when they can go ahead and completely break Demo Expert and Stealth attacks in VATS? 
---
I'm not even shitting you, try to do a sneak attack in VATS. It literally doesn't work, and Demo Expert doesn't change the damage on Explosive prefix weapons.
---
They done goofed hard.
---
It is, confirmed on this sub by valseek
---
My build spent a year finally got right about a week ago. Useless level 207 sneak shotgun or commando btw have Solar armour as well
---
Being in public teams now all the time killed the whole sneak game play for me anyway, as if *they* see your team mates *they* see you. There would have to be special and separate events for sneak players or change the mechanic so sneak still works in teams.
---
We are encouraged at every turn to join teams and play with others, I have resigned my antisocial ass to it and am slowly getting used to playing with the other kids in the school yard.
---
Bethesda do not want sneak to be a meta, that much is clear, they may as well strip it from the game altogether.
---
Nooope
---
Mix in some Action Hero and Final word to lighten up the bandolaro
---
It does. It’s been tested and I tested with my friend it works for both of us. When my friend triggers his perk ( follow through) I get the bonus and when I trigger mine ( taking one for the team) he does as well as long as the mob is focused on me.
---
The damage stacks and work multiplicative with each other. Angry turtle actually did a test on this if you want to check out YouTube.
---
Melee has not, and I've seen numerous ppl say they are doing good damage still with rifles and who really runs a pistol build, they've always been poo.
---
Maybe that’s what it is. I put a lot of holotapes in my stash.
---
Yep. Fastest time I’ve achieved with a good team that’s communicating is 6:27.  I imagine once people get it down there will be 4 &amp; 5 minute teams or something crazy.
---
Yep, AA is now better than all the mob-type specific legendary effects on weapons as long as you have at least 45% damage bonus from perks, mutations, etc. and you do not have armor penetration from other sources (e.g. the Tank Killer perk).
---
AA used to be slightly worse than the mob-type specific legendary weapon effects before patch 22 (28% vs 30% damage bonus with no other sources of armor penetration).
---
&gt;I’ve been accused of jacking on Xbox because I take a bunch of buffs and all serums...
---
I dunno. You’re probably getting accused of jacking because of background noise in your mic more than anything else. Ymmv, though.
---
And if you did stack to get 50k damage, shove it.
---
I am working on it! Following as I am also very interested
---
-unyielding reduces AP costs and increases accuracy, so I can aim in vats for basically as long as I want
---
-i put the explosive mod on my crossbow so I don't have to worry about not being able to tag enemies. 
---
-when you have unyielding armor, you gain +15 strength (75%) melee damage. This makes it viable to 1-2 shots things with a bloodied 2 hand as weak as a baseball bat without ANY melee perks
---
-stealth is your only friend as an archer
---
-plasma arrows are very visible when in the launchedr. This makes it easy to visualize arrow drop behavior
---
-use marsupial and bird bones. Being airborn helps compensate for arrow drop in vats since you're aiming down anyways.
---
-play in third person. You're gonna have to learn to aim slightly to your right since the character isn't centered but your whole screen won't be covered up by a wooden bow
---
We need to step up to the plate and respeck and change builds regularly.
---
It's specifically a bit less DPS for heavy guns build, it hurts much more for single shot slower weapons like rifles/shotguns
---
Heavy guns which largely already focused on volume of bullets over damage per shot are less hurt by losing damage cause their shots already had lower damage anyway, notable exception being the gatling gun.
---
Is the ammo easy to make? Yes. Will your entire life be scrounging for acid and steel? Also yes. Assuming of course you don't have ammo factory.
---
Even still I had no problem killing mobs. I only struggle against something like earl
---
I've been playing Junkie Commando the last two days and it hasn't seemed that bad to me. A few more bullets for most enemies, but the Daily Ops poop bullets by the truckload so NBD. 
---
I really thought I was going to dislike this patch.  Instead I've been having a blast.
---
I sprint around with my mole miners gauntlet and am sad that I can’t see if I go too far. I just wanna punch some baddies!
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
They just want to make sure you remember them lol. Curious, did they still have their effects? Like did you have to bash or melee to kill?
---
Yeah I found this today and figured it was this. 
---
Good they can do this without shutting off the game.
---
1, you have 6 at level 300. Which you then turn in perks for coins to level them.
---
Okay.  But until I can get another 50 levels that's not an option.
---
I actually did Battle Bot and another player was there yesterday. I've never had that happen. I usually do it because it's a 30 second way to get a bunch of circuits and adhesive but it took a a little work this time and was more fun.
---
I run gunsmith at 4. I usually have to repair my gun each run. Is your laser explosive?
---
I play the game, have fun and not worry about grinding xp.
---
Thanks for the response! I did, but I don’t enjoy playing them because I’m not able to contribute much. I die after one or two hits, and run out of stimpaks fast. I’ve been getting at least 10 stimpaks as a reward for completion and picking up some ammo along the way, but I still feel like I’m leeching off the level 100+ characters that are blazing their way through it. Sure, all the 3 star gear is nice, but I still feel guilty. People have been really nice about it, though, so I feel like some of them already know what mid-level characters are going through!
---
Shotguns are pretty good against most enemies still. Although a level 100 mirelurk queen took what seemed like 4 full clips using an exterminating (bugs) explosive shotty. Fully perked for shotguns.
---
for a level 10-30 it is a fucking grind for leggies that'll be useless shortly and broken to shit. when your only goal is to get more xp to get more cards to get more perk coins sure but sub 50 its a fucking slog if you dont know what youre doing and just want to chill and have fun with or without friends.
---
That sounds like mostly the way I play. I emote wave in passing, pop into events, and visit a few camps, but I usually wander off alone. And I was never overpowered.
---
Zero, unless you scrap the perk cards you get from leveling. You get 50 coins for hitting 50, that's it. The rest come from scrapping cards.
---
You get your first legendary slot at 50, then up to 6 slots in total at 75, 100, 150, 200, and 300. (these are account wide)
---
Oh man, not only did they Nerf everyone, including all the Anti-Bloodied food builds but they also completely removed the ability to do sneak attacks in VATS.
---
And also removed the ability to use the Demo Expert perk card to increase explosive weapon damage. 
---
I mean, at this rate they should just remove weapons from the game in general, armour too, let's all run around naked swinging elbows. I feel like at this rate it'd be more productive.
---
Actually i tried but there is still no sound
---
So frustrated
---
you get them from scrapping perk cards
---
Yes.  I died once thinking it was a standard mob war.  Had to bash
---
Ummm what? 
---
Using a LVL 12 build and assuming it will scale successfully unmodified, is not how you test balance in a system that introduces increasingly effective perk cards and such...
---
That's absurd. Where do you people think up this shit
---
It’s not like what your describing
---
Keep the change, but put up a server for casuals like It was before
---
Sorry about that, I am pretty high so have over a hundred spare perk points, respecking is hard at low level I do remember.
---
And, I can finally get rid of my not animated versions of cards too so you can actually collect animated cards now instead of just having them take up space.
---
It was, until extra perk cards became the currency needed for legendary perks.  These systems should compliment each other and instead they kinda compete.
---
I turned in 50 tickets and got 2. Sold one.
---
Tbh old and new version had their ups and downs.
---
Old: + Passive - You needed to be 5 minute sinto the mission to actvate it. Wich was a time when all non- unlimited missions were over
---
New: + You have it from the start, and it generates even more energy -you need to refresh once a minute
---
I took the Monogagh(?) workshop yesterday and for the “defend” event i got not one, not two, but three lvl75 scorchbeasts. Plus a couple of lvl 60 scorched came out of nowhere to add to the beat down. It took me about 30 minutes to get rid of them because of all the sonic spamming. Used around 15 plasma cores for my big gun. Heck of a lot of fun and I would sign up for that shit again.
---
Ok. I could get that in like 30 min last season. I’m looking for numbers. I provided mine and only one other person responded with theirs. Everyone else is going by feel which is not what my numbers reflect.
---
Yeh, it was slow at times. Especially when the boss arrived but everything was there.
---
Please tell that to the non-working VATS sneak attacks. 
---
Or the non-working Demo Expert card
---
Or the Stealth that seems to not be stealth anymore.
---
Or the thousand Glitched weapons users.
---
Or the thousand Magic damage weapons users.
---
Or the Reload glitch users that still kill Earle in 1 second with 300 Round Dragons and Black Powdered Rifles. 
---
I'm actually not joking about the Demo Expert or VATS sneak attacks.
---
Literally go into sneak, Trigger VATS and then try it without VATS.
---
I knew about this long before the “amphibian” made the videos explaining it. It’s now finally coming to light.
---
I didn’t say it wasnt a valid question. That’s how I grind xp. I just play the game and level up. If I have anything to get a bonus, like lunchboxes or food I take them. 
---
That’s it. XP happens as you play the game.
---
1,2,3,5
---
you get 5 points at rank 4.
---
1 star is free
---
2 star is 50 coins
---
3 star is 100
---
4 star is 150
---
Moments like these, really hit home. I give this post 10/10 cats. Because it didn't cost me anything, I gave every single person here an upvote. Enjoy the patch guys!
---
All the versus prefixes (which includes Troubleshooter's) where better (about 10%) than AA before Patch 22. Now AA outperforms them by a few percentage. The math aligns with my in-game experience.

---
It's way gooderer.
---
So its just a normal crafted non legendary? Well that breaths hope, means Mama Mumbles will have a chance to dropem when ya get the plan learned
---
Almost as though they decided it was easier to just lock out certain weapons and builds instead of making actually engaging content.  Surely we wouldn't notice that.
---
Yep vats is broken. I tried to level up a mule with my high level friend doing the Fort Defiance event and I went oh no I have to rely on actual skill to gain xp before they die.
---
Yeh I have a few I've had for ages but they've always been lacking to say the least.
---
Ah thanks! I was confused when I noticed the pattern. I got R2 right now so I need 250 more coins, hahahahhh.
---
For 2000 caps, my guy I played a month at launch and just got back into it yesterday, I haven’t made money yet
---
It would be helpful to get a small message stating "Corn soup is about to expire". Sorta like the "You take a drink from your vault 13 canteen" from New Vegas. 
---
It's just a quality of life sorta issue but it would be pretty convenient.
---
I would love to have a cap limit problem. I'm always having to sell bulk steel and wood every day to get my caps.
---
Woot, badass legendaries and more shit 1☆ lootz
---
Nothing has really changed. 
---
Aa and tse are relatively better than before so if they were b tier now a tier but still not s tier. 
---
But bloodied still 1 and junkies still 2.
---
Legacies still dominate.
---
Bloodied n Stealth builds whinning...not surprised. They were spoiled for too long anyways...now they are first to die at every encounter 😆....I remember they'd always say "Risk vs Reward"....hows the risk going now? Or how bout those rewards? You have been playing on easy mode for so long you are soft now....you marshmellows
---
You can view the rank progression of legendary perks just like you can with normal perk cards.  To directly answer, yes, rank 4 awards +5 to the specified special.
---
I’ll check it out, thanks
---
I do know who turtle is, obviously. I just wasn't planning on using taking one for the team, nor do I play in teams, so I skimmed over that part. and yes, follow through is a debuff. so it should work for anyone in the vicinity. but to trigger it, your target can't be in combat with anything else. or you need to be hidden, caution won't trigger it.
---
And why should you be allowed to just sit there, in stealth, while other players have to work for it?
---
Level 2 up there?  Go back to the Forest 😉
---
It cost 1 point to unequip a legendary perk card.
---
Man, do people really can’t scavenge scrap effectively? It’s really easy to avoid enemy and yoink some fans and hot plates here and there
---
Yeah but some people want to grind xp instead of wandering the same spots we've seen dozens of times and doing the same daily quests we've done millions of times.
---
good point
---
You got yourself!  Next time don’t put 30k things in there and if you sell something for high caps, leave the world quick.
---
We managed a 5 minute team of 4 today it was stupid easy compared to yesterday's clusterfuck of hardmode.  Sadly not  single one of us got a rare plan however we did when we all got paladin yesterday.
---
depends on what you spend your perk points on. 
---
If you dont swap any special stats, and dont use any perks, then you can get 100 coins for the levels themselves, then another 80 from the perk packs at every 5th level.
---
50 levels gets you 180 coins, or enough to make a 1 star card 3 stars.
---
I too am in the bullet business. And business is surely booming.
---
It's better to try and complete the hardest first as the lower 2 levels get added into the loot pool as well.
---
Sure. I never said anyone couldn’t. I said what I do.
---
Fun
---
Unarmed is worthless now though :( 2500dmg to 639dmg
---
I have a few cards I could probably spare but between screwing up my build between levels 20 and 75 and having a lot of cards for alternate builds I don't want to part with, I'm not going to be leveling my legendary perks very quickly. Which is not that huge of an issue for me at least. I'm pretty satisfied with the changes and new content so far.
---
Don't we already wade through shit in real life already?
---
what a maroon
---
&gt; I question why they even did this ... who actually wanted enemies that match your level. It’s never been a feature that Bethesda fans have wanted, going way back to early Elder Scrolls games.
---
Heh, yeah, I remember [Skyrim had the same problem](http://cdn.themis-media.com/media/global/images/library/deriv/75/75543.jpg).
---
no, but it does cost 1 coin to unequip a legendary perk card.
---
I don’t kill the SBQ that quickly.  I can’t even summon the SBQ on my own, every on my best character, without a large investment of time and energy.  You’re going way out of your way on a game to make it as hard on yourself as you could.  Even with exploring and building, you still needed to go out and gather supplies, you still needed to kill things.  Even playing casually and just kicking back, I still had at least SOME damage perks on my character.  
---
Again, I DO NOT HAVE THE BEST GEAR.  I do not have a B2525 fixer.  My best weapon is probably the unstoppable monster and I only got that because i went out of my way to do that challenge when it was up.  My Medic character (which is a character not designed to go solo, even *BEFORE* this update) is still surviving.  
---
yeah, maybe you need to take a day or two, get a couple of levels, and swap a couple of perks when gathering supplies.  So? Even the traders in the wasteland wouldn’t have gone around without any ways to defend themselves.  You can still chill, you just need to be a bit smarter and adapt
---
I feel your pain, I honestly do, I'm a useless Sneak/Crit Rifleman. Not only are my Rifles doing literally nothing now, I can't even Crit in VATS while sneaking because the feature literally doesn't work. 
---
I mean I'm glad I have an ALT with Heavy Guns.
---
But that's kind of messed up, and degrading to have to resort to "At least I can use this!"
---
The fact that Bethesda didn't even address this through PTS is...
---
well...
---
What the heck is the PTS even for in the first place? 
---
I want to stick my head through a brick wall, I feel like it'd be more productive.
---
Ah shit I’m dumb. I didn’t notice the view legendary perk thing. Thanks Theodore Broosevelt.
---
The Mire. Hands down. Its Far Harbor in 76. I love the atmosphere. The claustrophobic feel of no sunlight to the Strangler Vines everywhere. Second would be Ash Heap.
---
Downvotes are ok. It just means others disagree. doesn't really bother me. If I see a hidden down vote comment I always open it anyways
---
You didnt get duped. You did a rookie large value trade mistake. High priced items like that you place on displays with what they are stat wise. This way you choose when you sell. Or post it to the reddit forums so you dont cap yourself out.
---
Not got anything, I am guessing to get elder is easier if there is some coordination in the team, in that one person gets to the second location ready to start it once you claim the first location. Or can you do two at the same time? 
---
Got paladin easily with public teams today, but still a good few minutes off the time despite running straight to the objectives and ignoring the enemies.
---
Speed runs are going to depend on location, enemy type, and mutations. Resilient is tough unless you've got a dedicated melee tank on your team, and the Burrows has a lot of ground to cover between locations, so yesterday's combo is probably the most time consuming. I imagine explosive enemies in the Galleria will probably yield the fastest results because you can take them out from range and the "arena" is much more compact.
---
I'll have to try that, but I am so far unimpressed with this implementation of the concept.  I took one look at yesterday's ridiculous requirements and took a hard pass.
---
I been using sneak vats and haven't noticed a difference
---
Earl is easy, mobs have been the most annoying part as sneak attacks don't work on them and they're always ignoring my sneak!
---
Only thing I'm interested in are foosball and the greenhouse. I'll just grab those and retire early this season, I thought. So of course greenhouse is 99th on the list.
---
I don't think I can carry all the lunchboxes I'll have by then.
---
I got two rares yesterday, sadly it was same gutter plan both times
---
50 levels is 10 packets. 1 packet is 4 cards so that's 8 coins  , since there are 10 packets that means 80. 
---
Now if purchase a card for each level that would be 100 (50 cards × 2 coins/per card) 
---
The final result is 100 + 80 = 180
---
Thank you for attending Cat's Math Class .
---
Haha. Thank you for the kind words and the good laugh my friend!
---
Lmao I meant hacking
---
I feel guilty moaning about  the Nerf on my bloodied build after reading that.
---
I never thought how bad it would impact lower levels.
---
Last night i did Heart of The Swamp with 2 lower levels pot shotting from a safe distance, hiding behind me and my explosive 50 Cal (Bless them)
---
Going to make a point of looking out for lower levels after reading this.
---
 i was surprised how much 50 Cal Ammo that Ammo Factory,and the ammo perk together gives. with Super Duper.
---
I did a Lead and Steel run on vendors to burn a few Caps and made 20,000 rounds of 50 Cal in 1 session.
---
I mean, yeah, I’m doing that. I’m also wondering if I could optimize a bit more.
---
So far I’ve been re-visiting a lot of the previously low level areas and noticed many of them are now viable grinding spots. Don’t worry bud, I’m having fun, that’s not my question at all.
---
I take everything thats not nailed down. Problem isnt getting scrap, its using it up too quickly
---
Not gonna happen. I can see an increase,but not a total," unlimited cap".
---
Yup, it's called Better Inventory.  A god send for weight management.
---
If 3 weeks of protesting on the PTS forums didn't change it, I don't think the odds are high that they'll change it.
---
I'm leveling faster for sure. I mean everything is 50 plus for me, 75, 100 level mutant hounds.. yea you'll level up quick.
---
The debuff (follow through) worked though even though I was in danger and my friend was in caution.
---
That's the thing I'm just getting wiped time and time again. I can't even go to lower level areas to grab supplies now cos they're all too hard . I'm getting killed just walking to Morgantown . My camp is based near George's scrapyard so I usually grab that and get the junk miner but almost every 5 mins it gets attacked so I fast travel back and get rushed by goons . And we are talking about one of the earliest parts of the forest . None of the vendor bots sell the 308 or 50 cal ammo I use so I either have to make it ( which takes recorces) ammo convert it (which takes time and is a rip off) or search for a players camp who has it (which is costly and not guaranteed) I'm wasting time and caps just trying to get resupplied and getting nowhere . And vats is just a joke because each shot at 95% still misses and gives away my position
---
It's making me want to give it up to be honest
---
Then switch to not-VATS and do a headshot. 
---
I'm presuming you're doing headshots in VATS.
---
Yeah that event has always had high levels and is in a different min enemy bracket area.  Not surprised on that event.
---
With sneak attacks not working and the base damage drastically reduced rifles are just non viable, and with the how badly melee has been nerfed and the enemies getting buffed it just isn't worth going in close anymore!
---
What do mean try rifleman?
---
What is wrong or what right with it?
---
Commando still works for me.
---
For future reference have a trade wall put the weapon display and what they are in short form Like a B2525 or AAFSS1S or whatever then put trade or X caps.   
---
Saves a lot of heart ache for those assclowns that know they are getting a deal and fucking you.
---
I can see EA really going to town on Sims Fallout. Probably have the same dialogue system as Fallout 4.
---
Casual team*
---
He'll yeag
---
When you equip the weapon in the pipboy you should see the damage recalculate on the fly to reflect your addictions and anything else like mutations that impact damage. Once you are addicted you maintain the damage bonus, the only reason you need to take more chems is if you want to increase your damage (from things like psychotats) or to temporarily suppress the negative effects of those addictions.
---
I have been the victim of unfortunate autocorrects, as well. So I couldn’t resist. Thanks for the laugh. XD
---
I'll try it
---
You gotta be fucking shitting me.
---
Dude. Budget is there to stop server( and client internet speed)resources from being overtaxed. Not everyone has access to fiber, my top is 2 megabytes a sec on a good day, and that's IF my step kids aren't hogging what little bandwidth I have with their ps4's and xbones.  That being said, I know that not everyone builds a large sprawling camp. Can you imagine the load  times, if they increased the budget by a factor of 10?
---
Yesterday I was on a team with 2 epic players and we managed to squeak through elder status literally with a second to spare. Today it was me and 3 other casuals and we did great. Finished in under 6 minutes.
---
Fuck eBay then lmao
---
How am i supposed to get that Dirty Hairy/Vash the Stampede feel if they don't put out the damage.
---
I see, I never use Vats so I wouldn't know.
---
If you ever need the ammo hookup, you can hit me up on PC, and I'll sell to you bulk at 0.5caps per round.
---
Lol you as well I would've never caught that
---
I’m a lv 115 and I’m having the same problems
---
Between enemies getting tougher,  my rate of fire and vats missing about a third of my opening shots my bow build is just not cutting it.   Time to hunt for a new weapon to build around.
---
What level/build are you?
---
This patch is horrible. I'm level 150 or so and it's impossible to fight. I never had good legendaries because RNG hates me...literally been playing since release on that character and I've gotten jack shit. Before the patch I could barely dent the Queen...now? Hahaha! Nope!
---
Just kill them or tank damage
---
Problem is without the right legendary it’s going to be hard for a casual player to build now. I’ve been really lucky with my PC character and have a really decent few vampires and bloodied weapons but it’s all RNG.
---
The best optimizing is using multiple lunchboxes, food buffs that iOS your int. Doing events with mobs of creatures can get you like 4000-6000 each creature killed and then XP for the event as well. 
---
It’s more about maximiazing how much you get from doing anything. But the max xp and creature can give is 4000. Some say 6000. Sane for events. 
---
There’s a max cap on how much do anything can give you.
---
Oh gee why didn't I think of that... oh wait, maybe because I cant get a chance BECAUSE I TRY TO STEALTH.
---
Wah , end game level 50 creatures dont die in 1 hit anymore :(
---
Same, Mire is my home. I even kept my camp light with the oil lights and fireflies to keep that atmosphere
---
You crossed into a higher level zone.
---
Well, scavenge more then. Make stockpiles, dedicate some play sessions to junk, junk raids. I can’t really imagine that you can eat up couple hundreds of screws, springs, thousands of iron e.t.c. in hours with any kind of damage your gear gets
---
I personally wouldn't do that and said nothing to insinuate that I would leech like that.  I would rather not bother if that's the only option I have.  If people are going faschnacht on these, it's just proof of highly flawed design if you ask me.
---
I don’t care about losing stealth. My build (bloody commando) is still the strongest one. 
---
What I do care is forcing me to kill with a melee hit, like yesterday. That’s BS right there.
---
Time to change up your playstyle I suppose
---
Lol this was the second daily op.  If you think todays is hard, you should have tried yesterdays as blooded stealth.  Could only kill the robots with a melee hit.  And boy was there a lot.  Mega long course to run too.  It was rough!  Todays was a breeze in comparison.  We did in 5 mins, just 3 of us first go.  Had fun with this one.  Yesterday's was made of nightmares lol.
---
Well I don't know, I get you but at the same time I'm seeing melee do damage myself, and heard ppl say rifles are still viable.
---
Sadly no, but is fine, ill just keep stockpiling my 5mm  until I find another Gatling or Mini
---
How do you know that people attempting to play with their lower level partner / kid / family member / friend / whatever *don't* make up a statistically significant percentage of the audience?
---
I regularly meet people in the wasteland who are playing with someone(s) they know IRL or visit camps which are designed for multiple people &amp; have their initials everywhere, etc.
---
The daily ops event really seem to be designed with team play in mind. I get that plenty of players want to be able to solo every aspect of the game, but i feel that that mindset is counter productive to a healthy online/team based community.   
---
If you prefer pure stealth, try teaming with someone running a PA tank build, they can aggro the mobs while you hide in a corner dealing heavy dmg.
---
To set your CAMP, to wander around, or to battle beasties?
---
I've only placed my CAMP in two places - first on Whitesprings Golf Course, and currently down the road from the Wayward. I miss my humble Whitesprings CAMP.
---
Visually, I like bits of the forest, particularly the view from the middle of that big bridge.
---
The first time I explored Watoga was fun. I remember being on a rooftop shooting at a scorchbeast (one of my first SB encounters), while supermutants on another rooftop were also shooting at it. The enemy of my enemy us my friend, etc.
---
I still get really spooked by other parts of Cranberry Bog and the Mire - I never feel quite levelled enough.
---
My first experience of toxic valley was the nukashine mission. I drank the nukashine, I wasn't really sure what was happening, and then I woke up near Grainger Farm - that put me off the toxic valley for a while, but I'm learning to love it now.
---
I don't spend much time there, but one of my favourite places has got to be the Palace of the Winding Path - it's just incredibly incongruous.
---
I'm at westek about to try it I'll let ya know
---
I see your problem, but that’s not even nearly unsolvable problems mate
---
thanks for the info, ill try gathering tickets then . how much did it go for ?
---
Adapt
---
Move your base. get better gear. look at your build.
---
If you get elder tier first try then it will still do 3 separate rolls in one go so it doesn't make any difference.
---
Vampires is pretty much the meta now. Especially in daily ops. My VFFR heavies now makes more sense than my B2525 rifles
---
With one wasteland I could hold my own as a melee build, now I struggle to kill anything and everything. I hope they revert it.
---
Well, since stealth doesn’t work. They can’t anyway.
---
Problem solved.
---
&gt;Bethesda fucks up a decent build and completely shits on people who use it for daily ops
---
"lmao just change builds."
---
To me, leveled does not mean level 100 enemies, which is the level of the basic enemies that now raid my base.
---
Lol, now i want to change my Psn tag
---
Not for the game mode where you need to stay in one spot. Otherwise you can just enter sneak and afk from uplink to uplink.
---
No, as soon as I get out of the PA I can run and jump and vats as I please. My AP then Show correctly as 169/169. Just as soon as I get into ANY Power armor, my char goes "phew" and breathes heavily attempting to do anything at all, even opening the pipboy makes me pant. Pipboy then goes AP --/-- and stays like that. JohnBrine might be on to something as the fusion cores don't seem to reload anymore
---
Show us your perk build
---
That makes sense. Ty ty
---
I'm hearing loads of reports of early game players just utterly running out of ammo with rifles because it takes so many rounds to kill enemies anymore, and melee isn't cutting it at that point either. The level scaling and nerf has made the early game an unnessarily unfun slog!
---
I'm level 150 or so and it's still brutal!
---
Let me sneak into the uplink circle, stand there hidden and get elder rank on my first try because the game is too easy.  I  used perfect stealth through the whole event and never had to fight anything!!!  Game is a broken mess.
---
😂🤣 weight bench weight...too funny
---
Smaller studios with less man power, less resources, and also working through a pandemic have done way more in a month than what Bethesda does in 6 months. 
---
Also have you seen the amount of bugs they re-introduce while fixing other bugs? They freaking re-enabled an XP glitch that was fixed almost a year ago.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/its0t7/looks_like_the_vending_glitch_is_back/
---
Can you give us more information? Consoles or PC, steam, beth.net. msoft store. What exactly does it do when you attempt to start it?
---
I mentioned this in another thread, but you might find it useful as well. There is a fairly big "no spawn" area surrounding most of the train stations, so if you don't want t worry about your base getting demolished go find a spot near Charleston, Morgantown, or Grafton station and build there.
---
3.6 per level, basic math people.
---
Maybe they do ... but you’re preaching to a different choir since I’m firmly in the camp of people who never really wanted a multiplayer fallout to begin with. 
---
It’s fine to make areas for newer players, but don’t ruin it for everyone by making every enemy a bullet sponge.
---
Also excuse me, but what is a blocker? 🤔
---
Totally agree,  glad they don't have to shut everything down just to work on it
---
Im not asking to be invisible im asking that all enemies don't pinpoint my position simply because I spawned in.
---
You're gonna be missing some damage and you might take a little more but it still works fine in my opinion
---
Maybe this game is not for u
---
This is pretty much what would happen if stealth worked.
---
At least the game didn't crash as it did for me.
---
If you are on PC I would like to help you. I can set you up with good armor, weapons, and give you some bulk materials and ammo. I also can give you some tips on build. I am running Junkie's and my build is pretty unspecialized, but I was able to solo a daily op on my first try yesterday, if that counts for anything. So I have a pretty decent idea of what's good and what ain't.
---
No, if you put it back on it's still max
---
Well I wouldn’t call 100 quid a year free...
---
My bad for thinking that you’d have the bright idea to maybe try something else.
---
Uh, screw off.
---
The game was what it was. I enjoyed it for what it was. I have 200 hours in it and a character that's like level 118. Then they changed it.
---
Shove your forced multiplayer experience up you know where.
---
Am wearing near full chemeleon armor so I don't get detected easily even if I do I can crit headshot them. Problem with earl is that I don't do any meaningful DMG anymore. Better go for commando and try to maximise dps
---
Adapt and learn.
---
Defo not much of a bug.  🧐...broken sneak hey..👀
---
Big brain game design here
---
And my bad for thinking an entire playstyle shouldnt be gimped. WHOOPS.
---
Ooowee. I tossed one of my remotes made it million pieces last night.Oh no Vats haven't been right for me unload all 8 rds. On 95% hit?
---
I was using heavy on and off. I didn't find effective against some targets for (my build)  against let's say level 62.
---
Yesterday was just ridiculous. I uninstall the game.
---
Like you have stated I don't understand why they have PTS and then release Like that. Even before releasing new update they were complaints about the new system. Still pushed out the door.
---
I think they are trying to kill the game for starfield and that loop thing I forget the name
---
Scraping cards
---
It's like, I'm in the desert... And you are complaining about drowning in the ocean dude haha.
---
The least they could have done was given us a free respec with such sweeping changes. The current "respec" system is pretty short sighted IMO.
---
Same here, I'm also excited about assassin's Creed Valhalla and far cry 6. there's plenty of games to play where you know the rules and you try to advance and become powerful rather than having your build completely destroyed. I spent over a month grinding for secret service unyielding armor.
---
You know this is only one of several variations of Daily Ops, right genius?
---
Commando or heavy gunner is nessary yes but with sneak damage broken commando might not get the same damage it used to!
---
Heavy guns the magic damage does even more than it did pre nerf!
---
Sounds like fun until nobody shows up to kill you for 2 hours
---
Almost like daily ops are supposed to be challenging experiences that you have to adapt your play style to. Almost.
---
Hey we boosted rewards along with enemy levels. Here’s 3 caps and some meat for killing a level 100 mirelurk high king.
---
Personally I'm always over encumbered as soon as I enter power armor as I loose my backpack and unyielding buffs alas.
---
And blocker is an agility perk that uses ap to mitigate damage.
---
I don’t remember. I probably tried for 4,000-5,000
---
I generally don’t price my stuff that high. I sell a lot of other stuff players need.
---
Intelligence is on casual now?
---
Before this you could do almost anything solo except vault 94 which sucked and end game events like sheepsquatch and scorchbeast queen, which were more server wide events when they happened. 
---
Introducing all of this extra stuff just makes the game harder and less fun.
---
Almost like it's impossible to adapt due to a shit respeccing system and you basically gimp yourself further in the process of trying to respec due to how slow it is. Almost.
---
Any level.
---
Seems to be working correctly, could be the server you're in idk but it's doing more damage in vats for me
---
I've been having a blast with Vampire heavies. No one can even get me to half health. So I just stand in the uplink zone facetanking everything.
---
Fancy shotgun VATS build here. I’m literally unstoppable pain train now and I’m having a blast
---
I had the same issue. I had to make a new one. Then I was able to mod it to shielded.
---
It was like that for a while then switched to volatile blood eagles, and has been that for the rest of the day so far at least. I wasn't going to do the robot one but this one was pretty easy.
---
Offf 13 minutes running around there surprised you lasted that long. I only did burrows once before this update, hated it never returned. I come back today, got lost for 5 minutes while my teammates were already at bravo point. Yeah we missed the rewards cutoff cuz my ass was struggling with all the f&amp;$;@ tunnels. God i hate the burrows.
---
You fucked yourself up there. How long have you been playing this game? How could you not realize 30k is the limit???
---
I hear you friend. I’m in the 1% of this game as far as player power goes and my heart bleeds for anyone not in the same spot as me. 
---
New players in particular are going to get it the worst. I [made another post about it from my perspective. Bethesda needs to see this. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iu1fx8/im_in_the_1hyperoptimized_builds_for_76_this/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf).
---
Jump into PA with EP. If your a bloody stealth build that’s the only thing that can make you survive. 
---
If you become overweight in PA then go excavator or manage your inventory.
---
Being in PA with a auto fixer non stealth can kill things just as fast out of it if you can’t sneak.
---
There is a reason sneak would make daily ops pointless and that is the reason why it should not work there. Other people here already pointed it out.
---
I use stealth a crap ton normally and still managed to solo yesterday's OP without changing up any perks.  Just removed some rads and went at it.  Haven't tried today's yet but from the posts I've seen its way easier.  
---
Assuming some of the other non-uplink ops they come up with can't be completely cheesed using stealth then they may occasionally have some in the rotation where stealth isn't excluded.  Considering this is the only mode they have so far it's probably staying this way for the time being unfortunately.
---
I'd keep them if you have space. Running the daily ops while bloodied can be a PITA, especially is you rely on stealth or VATS. My main runs bloodied most of the time, but at least for yesterday's enemy/mutation comb I found it much easier to heal my rads and bust out my junkies and vampires handmades. Once we finished running the ops I just too ka little bath in the highly radiated puddle outside Blackwater mine.
---
Yeah or maybe perk coins. I feel yah!
---
Stealth is just outright broken everywhere since the update, unyielding boosted agility doesn't seem to be providing a sneak bonus anymore. And I've not managed to get a sneak attack boost since the patch went live against any enemy!
---
Melee I get instantly detected, ranged I don't get detected but sneak crits just don't proc anyway!
---
I’m running full health builds on 3 different characters, and I love being able to go to Morgantown for endgame grind. It’s a breeze for me on a full health AA sniper, PA heavy gunner and PA assault rifleman. That being said, they seem to need to broaden the curve on enemy scaling. Maybe keep enemies a notch below players at starting levels, until they get a footing.
---
Are VATS and Non-Vats doing Equal damage? Or is one doing more? Because one should not be doing more.
---
In my case, Non-Vats is doing more damage with headshots which makes no sense.
---
If you are on a daily ops team it will show on the team listing if any of the teammates are on a daily ops. That should be their cue to join. Unfortunatey for me i was in the middle of doing an event so i had to bail on my mate. Sorry bro wherever you are.
---
When is the event? Soon?
---
Lol reddit trying hard to make this a hardcore only game.
---
I feel for ya. I am casual as fuck and dont appreciate being forced to fight tooth and nail. I enjoy intentional stress from events, not constant.
---
You get an upvote. Everyone always gets an upvote from me!
---
I’ve had 200 plus camps all over the map and attacked twice in my memory.  Except near the pond at the whitesprings.  Mite lurks attack but I’m there for the fast fry 😂
---
Oh that one went under the radar for me.
---
Secret service vanguard armor tho
---
What kind of defensive perks and armor are you currently using for your junkie? Perhaps I might have something that could help.
---
Sucks a fat one bro...sorry but with all the xmas duped gifts around it wont take long for a level 2 to open 300 gifts and be at max caps...display your item and put the small letters on it..again sorry  man
---
Honestly not sure how you managed but more power to ya.
---
But when I tried they just fucking KNEW what would happen.
---
Honestly worst part is the fact that it's not a randomized modifier but the default.
---
I'm willing to give someone 100 screws and 400 springs for lever action plans.
---
I knew this update would hit new players hard on resources but I never actually thought about the difficulties in getting those resources I was thinking more stash space for non 1st player since builds use more ammo. I feel for new players I cant imagine trying to grind out to level 100 or trying to respec in this update I didn't really notice a change for my main but that's entirely do to being a near perfect heavy gunner build who was a junkie before the update so I was tanky before and can sit through a hail of gunfire for fun even now, that along with being loaded with ammo and being able to dish out mass dps you don't feel super nerfed just like you need to hold trigger for a second or 2 longer. I really hope they lower the entry-level power for new players and hope new players figure out that daily ops is the best bet for them I'll happily let a low level mooch off me and use me as a tank while they take pot shots from the back I'm a power armor heavy gunner it's what I'm good at 💪
---
They already fixed the floating items inside the communist bunker. Surprised you didn’t read through the patch notes.
---
Yup, I'd be happy with 40%. I'm a melee build that no longer feels like a melee build. Feels more like I'm just a random dude throwing haymakers with a basic Bear Arm that I crafted at a work bench 🙄
---
Still searching for ammo converter.
---
The hardest part about yesterday was listening to constant whining of people who couldn't read or possibly alter their play style for 8 mins. I swear some of you would bitch about sex cause there's work involved.
---
Enjoy all of my upvotes guys! See you in the game!
---
Savage Divide, just south of Pleasant Valley, there is a pond with a boat in it. 
---
No random spawn enemies, acid extractor.
---
Tis why my base has been in the same spot since Feb 2019.  
---
Its peaceful and quiet.
---
It made it harder as all the enemies are tankier, do more damage and all our weapons are worse.
---
The rifles, pistols and melee have been hit the hardest and that's all you get the first 20 levels!
---
I fixed it by doing a coullasus proplem
---
Not read 1 post with anyone on here crying because their weapons dont 1 shot everything ?
---
Have read plenty of posts about players being pissed off at needing 3,4 shots to kill Ghouls now.
---
In fact the " 1 shotters" were relatively unaffected by the Nerf.Hence why none of them are complaining.The magic weapons were unaffected.
---
Only good honest bloodied and Melee builds were Nerfed.
---
Repeat runs you’ll just get normal rewards, but with the first time you get a rank every day, you’ll get a bonus (legendary for paladin, extra currency for paladin) and a chance at a plan.
---
Had the exact opposite reaction as a bloodied stealth. They always instantly saw me (because of their perception buff) and they ran so fast towards me that almost every kill meant a death for me. 
---
Hope there’ll be other daily ops that will be more fun with my build. Glad you enjoyed it though. With the right build (and possibly a team), this could definitely be fun.
---
Again. Not my forces multiplayer experience. 
---
It's the experience the game was marketed as.
---
From a pure dmg output stance, yes my bloody 2hnd melee took a serious hit, but since the dmg was so op to begin with I'm not really bothered.   For the most part, i can still kill damn near everything so far with 2-3 swings.   
---
Honestly,  i created other characters to try different weapons and build styles so there would be a challenge again.   1 shotting a sentrybot is fun the first couple of times, but it gets old pretty quick.
---
What does a lunchbox do?
---
My 5mm Gatling does that for me, tyvm.
---
Can we get some pictures of the Tank helmet please. Thanks.

Same. To me fallout should be solo first team second. It seems they're trying to push us into teams. I've been playing steadily since release and don't like the direction it's going. They're shitting on long time players who put the time in to get top tier equipment to cater to all these new players who want to enter a game almost 2 years after release and be close to equal with veteran players without putting in the time or grind.
---
Yes it is, and I probably would have done it if it worked.  But it doesn't, and I played it and finished it anyways by myself.
---
I got the plan for Whistle in the Dark.  Not sellable, even after taking the unique skin off.  Costs 2 modules to craft.
---
Scrapping perk cards you don’t want. This process can take quite a lot of time depending on your level.
---
You know how many times I missed those robos with sledgehammer and excruciating slow. Especially in VATS?
---
I probably have the base plans... and mod plans too.  Whats you platform?
---
The tactical marine helmet plan is an infrequent spawn in the Quonset hut across the tracks from the white train tower as you follow the tracks from big bend to watogo.
---
You have to wait. You get three chances at a rare reward (One for each rank). If you get the highest rank first try then you get three chances at getting a rare reward. After that you only get the basic rewards until it resets.
---
Damn all you people with so many caps feel free to give them to me, I started playing a month ago and am strapped from buying ammo and stimpaks (I know probably shouldn’t be buying from vendors to start with)
---
Its not there at least as of today. Its on the pts but not the live patch
---
So glad we have "bulk"options.
---
Wait seriously?
---
I've not gotten a sneak critical hit since the patch.... It just won't proc at all!
---
Yeah, something is up. 
---
Essentially they both should be doing the same, I run a VATS crit build, and the only time you're meant to see more damage is when crippling a limb, or performing a manually triggered Crit. 
---
In the long run, headshots both in and out of VATS whilst sneaking or even not sneaking, should be doing the same amount.
---
Who gives a **** about marketing?
---
The games 2 years old. You make radical changes to it you poss people off.
---
And if the game was this at launch expect it to be even more hated.
---
Well.  Like I said. I enjoy it.  Same thing that Borderlands did and makes it very enjoyable to me because instead of ‘oh those are the early levels you can’t bother going back there’.  Because you are hitting lvl 5 mobs and getting lvl 5 legendaries.  
---
Opens the whole map up for continued exploration.  Why just make more things (which they are also doing).  Pushing oneself into those new zones only.  Versus keep everything playable.  
---
Anyway.  Totally understand your point as well.  Just sharing that I’m someone who does enjoy it :)
---
How much?
---
Yuuuup!
---
It's intended. They made PA alot more viable outside heavy builds in the new update. Which it really needed. Regular armor already had so many advantages to it over PA. Imo you should be unkillable in PA espcially t65.
---
8:04, that’s so unlucky.
---
It's just that you could see it popping up when it was tested on the PTS.
---
I believe the screenshot I saw was around 1700
---
Oh and I should have pointed out too, make sure you don't have the Bloodsucker Legendary card equipped if you're testing it.
---
Wrong thread
---
I had robots with resilience two days in a row? How did you get blood eagles?
---
I have been getting him 10 pumpkins every single day. They should be lining the road to the Red Rocket by now.
---
That place was a like a blank giant canvas. I remember giving up on it because i just got tired from all the space i had to fill up. Whew
---
Again... on uplink they will always have piercing gaze, which means insane perception, so of course you can’t do it stealth. They’ve stated multiple times that this permanent mutation is for uplink and when they do other modes of daily ops, there will be other permanent mutations.
---
Yeah I see what you're saying, what did you mean by demo expert not working? Damage numbers for weps with the explosive effect or just straight up grenades and mini nukes not getting damage correctly heightened by the perk?
---
So if I get elder on my first run it does three rolls for a rare reward when I finish?
---
If you play on PC, it doesn't matter if it's steam, beth.net, or msoft, we are all together. Would like to see cross play soon.
---
Commando and heavy gunners are fine, the nerf hurt but we can still play as normal, EVERYTHING Else needs buffing drastically!
---
Does anybody use level 0 locks though? I mean if you're going to do it might as well make it a 3 so they have to work for it, not that they're in any way difficult.
---
But muh adhesives!
---
Same, had to delete stuff to come within budget.  I have the raiders nests, using 3 and a communist bunker.  I'm betting either of those now take more budget
---
Yep, been a Fallout 1st subscriber since January for Xbox and PC, cancelled both today.  Nerf damage and buff the world lol that makes sense.  Everything feels like bullet sponges and just made everything tedious.
---
Can’t enjoy the game anymore.  I guess it’s only fun now if you play a specific build or have friends to play with.
---
Except now legendary prefixes dont make a huge difference. Take for example: My junkies handmade does only 20 more damage then a non legendary at full health. The problem here is nobody actually makes builds right. 
---
At level 33 you can have have 2 maxed out commando ranks and tank killer maxed as well. Also perks like concentrated fire are available right away. Vats headshots are powerful even at a low level with a pipe gun. Serendipity is available early on as well as adamentium skeleton and fireproof. 
---
I stand by my previous statement. People don't take the time to learn perks, and their builds suffer because of it.
---
I have the same. I was thinking of doing a good vanguard armor set to finish the build with What Rads.
---
You only get the new plans if they're Level 50 or above!
---
That's an important caveat! I've seen players going into Daily Ops under Level 50, so this is important to say.
---
If you complete a Daily Op UNDER Level 50, you can only get plans for base game Weapons, Armor, Power Armor, and CAMP plans (The ones you would receive from Workshop Claiming/Defending).
---
Well I have yet to come across a magic weapon player post patch yet. Don’t seem there’s too many of them at the moment.
---
Ban Hammer 🔨
---
They do and they did.  I kept getting hit with a melee sound and there was nothing even remotely in my line of sight, not really sure what that was about.  It pays off to have some extra gear around now more than ever.  Slap on a few troubleshooters pieces and take a vampires weapon or something.  The legendary system hands you the tools you need for different situations.  Need to manage stash space and make use of them when needed.
---
Maybe I won't need travel agent haha who am I kidding
---
You're not imagining it, even though it wasn't in the patch notes.
---
Sorry  I am only level 36 and never been there before. What is so good about it and why do people go there?
---
Same here. Until they don't undo this mess not touching this game. Only played this game exclusively. Now I'm at a loss. Literally staring at my t.v. not knowing what to play. There was no other game like this.
---
Nope everyone gets an upvote.
---
Also they added skins to it, but they don't work.
---
Banned for duping or breaking game rules. Sorry pal. 🔨
---
RIP my 3 star explosive anti armored pipe rifle I used for low level areas to save my good ammo.
---
Pheonix Bot in Watoga.  
---
Unless you have all the t-45 through t-60 PA mod plans.  
---
You can dump 100k in just plans there.
---
Give a random buff and +25% XP gain for an hour.  Can be stacked up to 4 lunchboxes for +100% XP bonus
---
Sad day when we want 76 to be as good as Anthem.....
---
Yes  Very good point
---
Quite literally the shittiest interface anyone could have envisioned. Is it too much that it could just have a prompt listing sell all of whatever ammo type for X points, instead i have to spam at varying increments... ugh
---
Right!  Man alive that gave is some trouble yesterday. Not looking forward to that again.
---
I know my fixer took like a 50 dmg reduction. Didn’t feel legendary at all
---
What happened to the level cap for each area? Wasn't there at some point either in discussions from the devs or the PTS itself that areas still had a cap on enemies? I dont think I imagined that. Im lvl 250 and doing ok with the change but I must admit I got a shock when I ventured into morgantown and saw lvl 50+ ghouls and scorched. I was expecting those areas around the forest to be capped at lvl 20-25.
---
I had quad explosive 10mm pistol I kitted out to be automatic with neato hipfire, used it when I wanted to have some fun blasting fools.
---
shame its useless now and will be fed to scrip machine.
---
If you start the OP, on their screen they will get a notification that you have started an OP. It will also show next to your health bar "In daily OP".
---
Your public team can choose "join OP". This adds them to your OP. Obviously being in a daily op public team increases the chances of them doing so.
---
If you hang around in the starting area, it doesnt start the timer. So you can wait for other members to join
---
Could it be you meant dodgy? Either way, I dont have those perks equipped and weight is fine with and without PA. Guess I'm going to have to submit a fresh Bug report 🤪
---
I'm level 23 and will happily team up with you to grind out quests. I'll add you tomorrow when I get online if you send your gt
---
While there are some great changes this patch, let's not blindside ourselves into thinking any of yhe issues magically went away. I'm still getting the respawn bug and I hope all of you do too. Then maybe you'll understand how bad it is to ignore these things and focus on new content instead of fixing them.
---
I run a bloody gunslinger and I still kick ass. Don't get why people are complaining
---
Casual player here too! With work starting back up again, I had no idea about the update and went on to play yesterday when I finally had the time. I LOVED being able to sneak so effectively. I played a similar game to you (seeing how far I could get while sneaking, seeing how many enemies I could take out before getting spotted, etc.) To complete one of my Dailies, I entered an area and upon entering I was spotted immediately. Through multiple walls. With no enemies in sight. I was suddenly set upon by like ten level 75 robots. It was insane. I thought it was a glitch, so I logged out and logged back in only for sneak to continue not working. Nothing I tried worked and I kept getting overwhelmed and killed. I've only "rage quit" once before with this game. Last night was the second. This update completely ruined my character and build.
---
I had trouble with the stash limit before I quit.
---
What else does Fallout 1st offer?
---
I got the war glave. I now have to be lucky and roll a legendary at the preveyor
---
And my armor is breaking a hell of a lot more now that every mole rat and trash mob is level 60-75+, the fun just never ends!
---
Wayt what? You disabled all sound devices so that only the BT is shown and you set BT as standard, yet it does not work?
---
Oh good, and for me they are stuck to the foundation and I can't remove them easy. Thanks Bethseda!
---
I suppose it would from a low level perspective.
---
It is just we a higher levels have the capacity,and resources to adapt better to these changes than low levels do.I dont think it was intended to affect lower levels as much as it has bloodied builds. Unintentional collateral on Bethesda part.
---
Needs addressing as a matter of urgency this is game breaking for new gamers. And will cause some not to play.
---
If Beth took a page out of DE's book, Bloodied would've already been nerfed accordingly.
---
The rare rewards aren't guaranteed.
---
I hope they remove VATS. Learn to aim noobs
---
I have to disagree. Vanguard secret service armor is very strong. And you get a jet pack that doesn’t require fusion core strength
---
What level is the character. You have to be lvl 50 or above to get the new stuff
---
EDIT I dont know why this was downvoted when its a valid question to ask?
---
Also with the Toxic Valley it's literally meat week every week. Idk why they haven't stationed Grahm there permanently, he'd be right in his element.
---
Cant say I have a favourite though, they all have their interesting features and that's why I like the whole map, never a dull moment.
---
Yeah but as I said, I make plenty of ammo now without needing this legendary Perk. I'd only end up with a pile more ammo to toss in my vendors that nobody buys already (adding more weight to my stash and filling vendor slots)
---
And loading a pile of ammo in the ammo converter for half an hour isn't what I call fun.
---
But now with the damage reductions to my character's weapons, I'm burning through x3 the amount of ammo I used to. I can still make plenty, but this also means I'm stuck there at camp after every single trip out in the world crafting more and more ammo.
---
It's all frigging unnecessary micromanagement.
---
Nothing at all or just no rare reward?
---
Bulk them too. Prime cuts gave me so much adhesive, I had to literally drop 100 bulk at the overseers cache in the starter zone, once a day. If you actually want to farm adhesive, take over the steel plant. It spawns those anglers and you will find yourself getting full pretty dang quick, but expect to be ganked by bloodied.
---
Why? That seems like it dumb time gate to keep people doing them.
---
Fuck yay! I love how much more dangerous the wasteland has become
---
They should have left it.  Correcting it shows they were dumbasses mistaking your for you're.
---
Congratulations! Seems like me and the complete majority of other players are just dying because of our own stupidity. Shucks this is so embarrassing, I can’t believe I ever thought this game has problems.
---
Total
---
This occasionally happens to me on PS4 and stays for ages. It's a pain but I just get into the habit of switching every time Iog in for a while.
---
Quad one in VATS is ridiculous, you can empty all 40 rounds and have 75% AP bar left lol. It's just too bad they really nerfed the shit out of getting spikes/harpoons/bolts etc from the corpses.
---
Furious is pretty good for bosses but even after the patch you don't need many shots to kill mobs with a RWR
---
I got the super reactor.
---
Logged on last night for the first time since the update,just to get a feel for the new legendary run and see how the changes affected my gameplay. Looking for a casual and hassle free session since it was late at night for a 187 level. Instantly, have to fight off level 50 scorched as soon as my camp appeared. After that,decided to do some of the dailies for score. Go to the daily event of fixing a relay down in the burrows. High level handies and Protecterons soaking up ammo like a sponge, died 4 times just trying to get a foot in the door, and had one Protecteron finally get down to 2mm in health before putting in 5 rail spikes to finish him,which didn't! And killed me for a 5th time. Said "Stuff This!" and logged off to go to World of Warships. Something that looks like it's gonna be frequent for my team and i if this is the new game play.
---
Bruh its just annoying and perk loadouts aren't a thing yet so its not easy to change over to a melee deck, and then when your done back to a ranged build if your a ranged build. Its not that it involves work, its a dungeon raid of course it gonna need work. Its not fun changing perks to do say 3 run through to try and get some rare items and then back to your normal build if perk loadouts where in the game it probably wouldn't be as much of a issue. Its just annoying when a majority of builds are ranged and we have to go through the process of changing our perks not all of us have the melee perks. We leveled for range, and with the mutation effect of yesterday it makes us need to get perks we will never use for anything else.
---
This is no proper method, but I always find power armors by going around with maybe 1 pound of free space in my inventory.
---
Sealth doesn't work in any variation
---
Yep no more laidback playstyle, every encounter means life or death. I think many players would stock up supplies to counter the challenges.
---
It's a 163.
---
Like I said, I DID know that 30k was the limit before this whole ordeal went down, but I was so dumbstruck by what was happening that it didn’t even cross my mind.
---
I will man. Im angry that i cant be effective helpful or have fun. Games shouldnt make you sad.
---
Edit: 1st time
---
I have other cards unlocked but this is a normal setup for me.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3e414ff&amp;d=x40x70x80xj0xm0sg2pg2po1ph2pi2p02ee2ce0ir2ii0ic0ar2an2ao0a00a12a32a70la2lt2lu2lk0l71li2&amp;m=051c249fe8gh7b36i&amp;wp=w6&amp;wm=142535
---
Feeling same at level 35-40.  
---
I was appreciative of how this game allows you to play a sniper build since it's open world and you can position yourself etc but now it seems everyone takes double amount of bullets to die
---
Hoo boy, lemme tell ya, my Bloodied .50 cal went from like 1,100 to 200. I get that I shouldn’t  one shot a Sentry Bot, but I can barely even kill a Tick without pumping 2-3 FIFTY CALIBER rounds into it...
---
And?
---
Agreed, but Anthem was fun through the campaign, but there is no replay value what-so-ever. Their ridiculous grind was even more punishing than Fallout 76.
---
Omg bloodied dies in a couple of hits wow that's new /s
---
Bloodied been meta for over a year no offence I'm glad it plays more glass cannon style now. The amount of dr in this game at low health is just stupid.
---
Yes the modifiers are very anti range and stealth for that day. Adapt. You'll likely need a friend to help.
---
Bloodied got knocked down this update.
---
People laughed at me for grinding t65, for not going for SS armor. Well one patch made my build meta. Took a year of using it but my time to shine.
---
While many of us have requested a respec option for a long time now, and while I may not personally be having the kind of difficulty others are having, I can get why it’s frustrating for some. There are options, but a respec would be very useful for many reasons.
---
Grenades still get a damage boost, any weapons with an Explosive Legendary prefix does not, which they are meant to.
---
Of course, everyone sees things differently and I respect that, but ill have to disagree man, my B mole miner still puts up heavy numbers without UNY and only melee cards in strength
---
No rare. We completed it on Elder tho....Seems really dumb that not only do I have to complete it on Elder, but I have to both fight against RNG to get what I want and the possibility of getting nothing for my effort. There's nothing else of value in them besides the new plans.
---
Don't worry, Bethesda made sure you don't have to grind if you want to advance in the season.  You can use atoms and advance without the grind!
---
Last night I was thinking of doing an event, but after failing the Ops missions solo I just decided to repair my stuff and logout.  I'll see how much I even bother with this season...
---
Yeah. Also a sneak rifleman/commando. A bit higher leveled than you though. Due to my gear I often would do a good 800-1200 damage with my anti armored explosive lever action I named "police girls like cannons" (hellsing abridged reference if you dont get it). I'd do 400 on a bad long distance shot. Now I'm doing like 150-300 on ghouls at the airport. That's pathetic. 
---
But yeah, this game isnt going in a good direction. It's all grinding and chores. Once you burn through the content there's no point in continuing to play. It's a huge grind and it aint worth it. I kinda quit a month after wastelanders. I log in on occasion and after seeing a substantially large patch i decided to check it out today for the heck of it. Yeah, this sucks. Sorry, it does. They totally ruined the damage formula. I understand they needed to nerf some bloodied builds and crap but this is just so punitive to...everyone.
---
It'd be pretty disappointing to rack up all the 'rare' rewards on Day 2.
---
Ok, I've changed my mind. I kinda like the Dinner Choices. Take it. Leave it.
---
A feature. Todd wants every one to know there’s an invisible ball and chain hooked to that leg.
---
I got a 0 star lv 100 mirelurk queen for mine yesterday :/
---
Good luck, it's hard to get Bethesda to read them.
---
I couldn't play this event daily even if i wanted to.
---
I went through 60 + Stimpacks yesterday.That was just to complete the event in like 30 minutes.
---
Will take me a couple of days at a time to replenish.
---
Just dont really have a need for Stimpacks these days.
---
I just finished manhunt and one of the prison Marshalls got teleported into Earle 😂
---
I had a friend yesterday above lvl 50 who also didnt get anything on his alt character so maybe it works account wide. I dont know
---
Caravan anyone?
---
The ultimate trap camp, just tons of level 0 locked doors lol
---
I wouldn't worry too much about it. It's a public team,  I think a lot of High level players design their builds specifically to carry.
---
Yeah I’ll try and remember that for next time, if there even is a next time.
---
Ain't that the truth.
---
Ive heard that its basically if anyone in your team is detected then you are. So good luck of Mr.PowerArmor comes in  crash landing everywhere and firing his 30lb gun non stop for a minute. It's me, I'm Mr.PowerArmor. Sorry about your stealth :(
---
Wait are you serious about the stealth in vats?! I haven’t been on my stealth character yet. That is totally insane if true
---
I mostly played solo. Only reason I will pair with teams is because I was looking for those plans that I still don't have thru events. Or low on caps go public world for a little bit sale my stuff got enough and go back ASAP to my private world. Fallout1st is just a waste of money now. If I can't solo it. I could but I'm not going to do extra grind.
---
I uninstall both of my accounts that's how much I loved this game. Coming out of FO4 this game was different. By God it is! But I adapted. But not this, is too much..
---
When they balance the game I will subscribe again.
---
   I chose to build in the forest because I want to be able to relax, get out of my PA, and not worry about high level creatures attacking while I was crafting, etc, (or having a roving pack of them destroy it while I’m away...)
---
  Since enemies now scale up to max regardless of where you are, low level, low damage at camp is no longer.
---
(I’m high enough level that Instead of L1 molerats or L3 ghouls, I get max level forest critters - L50)
---
Stealth teams are a lot of fun, had a buddy I would do that with a lot.  It absolutely doesn't need to be solo. PA guys block your vats a lot though.
---
I wasn’t as funny or direct as I thought, it was satire haha but ty
---
Buff rolling pins and sheperds crook!

[Use this location guide](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Power_armor_locations_(Fallout_76)
---
There was a camp budget exploit with generators that has been fixed. 
---
You guys might have unintentionally been affected by the glitch and now it’s fixed.
---
Tea Time is a *lot* more intense and enjoyable now.
---
You should be fine, just be a normal commando when in daily ops. It works decently well.
---
1 rank
---
Could not agree more. This post reflects my exact experience. 
---
I’m level 20 but have been playing daily for about 6 weeks. I’ve been taking my time levelling up by just enjoying the world, building, collecting scrap. Just enjoying myself.
---
I’m now running out of ammo and eventually dying whenever I try to do ANYTHING as all enemies - even bugs - are now bullet sponges.
---
As a new player this patch has completely changed this game for me and sucked out all the enjoyment :(
---
Did it replace your reward? Or is it visual only? Or did everyone get the item? Doubt the latter since Beth would take down Daily Ops so fast.
---
this game shouldn't be impossible to play if you dont have an optimized build. Its an RPG. Meaning the PLAYER gets to decide how they play. That shouldnt be changed just because the meta builds are the only way to stay alive/kill anything. 
---
All builds need to be accessible with the exception of those meta builds being able to one tap and do massive amounts of damage assuming they have optimized and min/maxed to the best of their ability. I actually had no issue with bloody builds before, aside from the fact that they were the only viable hard hitting class alongside commando and heavy. Pistols, nah, shotguns? Barely. And semi auto did pretty great too until this new patch.
---
Why? Why is the lack of power leveling a good thing?
---
Its just 1 rank
---
Wow so 15'000 atoms to rank up the whole board?
---
Or, they can increase base damage and/or adjust monster health.
---
There are supposedly rare outfits that drop but only if all 3 are working. And the drop rate is insanely low.
---
Well I did it yesterday on both characters and got rewards. Also Happy Cake Day.
---
I am thinking this perk alone will make up for damage nerf.  40 percent it nuts.
---
I think they do but the damage numbers don't reflect it in pip boy, using demo expert with an explosive laser is noticeable in pvp in my experience, however Bethesda needs to get on stuff like that. The frustrating thing with this game is that Bethesda doesn't list EVERY little thing they fixed so it's up to us to retest and figure out what's fucked up every patch. I like the game but it's dumb at the same time lol
---
Thank you for so eloquently putting into words what I now feel. I too have been playing since release. Since beta, and no does not mean I’m special I just really love fallout, and I like to sneak and snipe. Just a very casual player. Liked the challenge of the east side and the casual happy go lucky in the west. I would not have minded some balancing but this seems extreme. I agree, it seems to be more geared to the very high level players now.
---
In addition to the information already given, you will receive 50 perk coins at level 50, for each character individually. That’s enough to rank up one legendary perk card to level 2.
---
So we're going with not much fun to put away your good weapons for rando bat, then.  Cool cool.
---
Impressive.
---
I have 1600 to cash.
---
Not even sure what i need now.Have the secret service,Armour,T65 armour /Gaus Shotgun and mingun + Pistol all Dog Shit :-)
---
The 10 round capacity always annoyed me, then I got a QE RWR &lt;3
---
I'm a Stealth Archer and I already actually uninstalled.
---
Thanks, though.  :p
---
You could have been affected and not even know it
---
I agree with you, I loved being able to run around low level places for junk or quick events/workshops and caps, aiding low levels where I can. If I wanted to fight high level enemies I would go to places with high level enemies. This should have been a toggle option or new game mode that could be selected before jumping into a server, not everyone wants high level bullet sponge 24/7.
---
Well, it's because you put your best foot forward.
---
For whatever reason, the poses Characters take in this game emphasize placing the Left Leg forward, so it's the first thing to get hit by most ground-based things, and the fastest to break. 
---
Followed by the Right Leg, then Left Arm, then Right Arm, then Torso, then Helmet. In that order.
---
I've repaired my Power Armor's Left Leg more than all the other pieces combined. Meanwhile, I've never touched the Helmet and it's still near full health.
---
Yeah. Same. I've been playing mostly halo MCC and modern warfare for the last 4 months and finally decided to check 76 today. 
---
The game was getting to be a chore when I quit..which is why I quit. I aint into grinding for the same of grinding. That's boring. I explored every inch of this wasteland, I know every location just about. I did virtually every quest. Im out of stuff to do other than repeatables.
---
Wanna get me to play more? CONTENT. There was a time I was playing this 4-8 hours a day for months on end. At this point it's just...no. 
---
At this point this game feels like life, just this game where you gotta expend tons of effort just surviving and not ended up poor again like you were when you started. it sucks.
---
i wish i could use vats for more then 2 seconds only to have it quit even though the bar is still half filled
---
Yeah, because having to pay 50 caps out of the 30k I constantly have was really dragging me down. Cringe ass post. Downvoted.
---
I think most of the people who don't like it, are the ones who haven't committed to a build. You don't have to min/max to still have a serious build. 
---
I like the update. A lot.
---
If your desperate enough, or you can... Now this is going to sound crazy... But you can also you know
---
      p l a y t h e g a m e
---
oh, I see now. Sorry I thought you were commando.
---
I’m a Lvl 153 &amp; before this update I LOVED this game even despite its stability issues &amp; bugs, but I played for an hour post update &amp; every enemy I encountered in The Forest region was Lvl 50, which is utterly ridiculous. If you want to scale up the Lvl of the most dangerous enemies then fair enough but I encountered probably 8 different enemy types &amp; they were all Lvl 50 &amp; like bullet sponges..... &amp; that was only in The Forest! It’s like the max Lvl in that region was set to 50 so Bethesda made every enemy the max lvl. I dread to think what the levels go up to elsewhere on the map, or will they all be a max lvl of 50 whilst I’m at around Lvl 150?! YOU WILL LOSE PLAYERS BETHESDA, so please change it back ASAP......
---
I’m not sure, I’ve heard of people getting two legendaries from the event, both times we did this the rewards list had one legendary and then the one my friend dropped for me.
---
Look at the damage after you equip the item you want to examine the damage of.
---
So: don't judge a junkies weapon by equipping an instigating weapon, then hovering your cursor over the junkies weapon. Weapon damage display is accurate only for the gun you have equipped, as the game needs to make assumptions about your perks, bonus damage, etc.
---
Tldr: OP, it's visual. Your junkies does more.
---
I'm having this same issue on my bloodied melee. It either isn't taking damage, or, it takes damage but the enemy's health bar doesn't visually decrease.
---
Big brain game design here.
---
Like is that really a justifiable mechanic for you? To just get shafted for your effort?
---
my perk load out is pretty good 
---
i have tank killer and most of the rifleman perks
---
Bunch of serial killers in the making,,,,
---
Lmao, I can just imagine a 3x3 or 4x4 block of floors with every available wall space being used as a doorway, leading to nothing, but all locked. That's mastermind level raider thinking, I love it.
---
Whoa, it’s almost like you’re suggesting an adjustment to the level scaling like I recommended!
---
People are far too sloppy with their nukes for me to put my camp anywhere within the radius of FSP lol
---
For times like these learning the power armor wall clip seems like a life saver
---
Just like season 1, there are a few items along the season2 path that amuse me - buts most are utilitarian, or items I’ll get because I reached the level, but may never use/equip.
---
But I’m also onfident for every player that doesnt like item X, there’s another player that loves it. :)
---
It shouldn't be a requirement now to have the legendary ammo perk card just to keep up in ammo reserves. Everything takes way more bullets now and if you dont force yourself to get the legendary perk card first, you're gonna be at a net loss for ammo
---
It's good. I was mid-70s going into the latest update. Stuff is harder, and some of my progress might be slowed, but I'm enjoying the challenge. I'm also enjoying the extra xp from more encounters being levelled.
---
There's a balance to be had - I'm using ammo and stimpacks much more quickly, and breaking weapons and armour more often too... but I had found that some areas like the forest had become too easy and dull - the game is harder, but I think that's a good thing.
---
I just need to get better at sourcing stuff like adhesive and ballistic materials for more repair work.
---
Alright...don’t play then.
---
of course high power elite players won't feel this one. But the jedi will and I thank you for speaking out against an update that will hinder more than it will help. There are some glaring issues they need to resolve with this one.
---
No that's too good and sensible and this is a Bethesda game
---
I stopped playing this game because I was sick of the constant bullet sponge enemies and I was hoping this update would fix that. Boy was I wrong. Do people find this fun? I mean honestly, why do game developers keep doing this shit?
---
Actually good to know that works well for stash. Thanks!
---
Right. I feel it’s restored a sense of danger and challenge. Using more resources is good because that’s part of the survival game aspected I liked. The resource hunting. 
---
But i always had way more than I could use reasonably. Like I got stimpaks faster than I could use. Never had ammo issues. 
---
Now I have to spend a little time gathering resources, and that is a little more challenging now.
---
I started a new character,  now level 10, it's been actually more fun than my 310 level,  just slowed the game a lot, did get killed alot more than old game.
---
Level 551 - need anything?
---
Ok, I guess I’ll stay bloodied
---
I grabbed a level 49 try hard melee player (my stepson) and the two of us just missed Paladin by seconds on our very first attempt. I'm a non meta PA heavy gunner. 
---
I don't think I have a lot of sympathy for the meta builds complaining that they can't solo Daily Ops. I couldn't solo Vault 94 and very few people cried for me.
---
I like it too, honestly the game just needs a better respec system for people who have builds that are ineffective at this point.
---
I will only pay for 4 ranks or so if i see something i would miss otherwise at the end of the season
---
Yeah INT got moved to casual and building got replaced by Daily Ops team.
---
Ah okay, I'd still wait.
---
Way easier than the last one too, in my opinion today was kinda too easy.
---
I don’t think switching your build is necessary. Just tweak it. My build is better than ever.
---
Ash Heap....been my home for over a year.
---
Low key I forgot about the update and played normally and I was checking my damage on a friend and I got fucking demolished by liberators because I thought I could ignore them hahaha
---
Tbh it makes it more fun, I missed that challenge of not one shotting everything in the game. They added the legendary perk of producing more ammo and that’s pretty nice to counter this extra usage of ammo.
---
I usually make a bunch of starter gear for the new guys and drop it in the cache.
---
I almost respeced to a commando because I heard there's higher damage output. But I absolutely got that reference, that's one of my all time favorite anime, I need to reed the manga still!
---
Haven’t found any yet, but those Mole Rats are no bullshit now.
---
That motto is forever ingrained upon my soul, brother.
---
My explosive vampires fixer was doing slightly more damage than my bloodied against earl last night. I was pleasantly surprised by that.
---
Yeah one time I got the glitch where I had 250 in the clip. Oh boy was that fun. Lol
---
It's leg day
---
You’re welcome. But I’d recommend getting your edit on quickly.... I definitely think you meant newish and not Jewish lol
---
I appreciate that info. I would suggest reading my comment though. 
---
I don’t use Bloodied weapons, nor do I mention them in my comments. Not only that, but the OP is referring to the Furious prefix-and does not say that he is collecting Bloodied weapons at all.
---
I was comparing my non-Bloodied build with his/her non-Bloodied build (we both utilize the same prefixes). We knew Bloodied would be hit the most-there was fair warning of that. 
---
You also know how that sounds right? 2-3 shots is bad? Every other non-Bloodied/Junkies build has had to deal with killing enemies with more than one shot this whole time (now its even more for tougher enemies). 
---
I don’t know what else to tell you. Those are the numbers for Furious, Vampires, and Anti-armor pre/post patch. That’s roughly a 5% nerf.
---
Thanks again for the info though.
---
Weird, for me the arm stays camo coloured no matter how I try to paint it.
---
Thanks friend, I'll try to find a solution or workaround tomorrow. Seems someone had a glitch with cores not reloading and it worked after disassembling the armor, putting the Chassis in the stash, taking it out and reassembling again. He could then put a core in manually... My build relies on that PA, if that doesn't work no more making me miss out on the score and op's, I believe I'll have to quit 1st for good 😕 aint got enough points to rebuild into something Else nor would I want to...
---
If it’s not freaking robots that need to be killed in melee, my bloody stealth commando does just fine. 
---
So what if you spend more ammo? Get the legendary perk to craft more.
---
No missed all shots still at 95% all almost point blank range?
---
I don’t think it was ever bethesdas intention for us to be one shotting higher level enemies. To be fair until one wasteland there was zero downside to bloodied commando and quite frankly there still is. With the exception of earle dying has absolutely zero penalty.
---
I dropped my bloodied commando and respecd into heavy currently using a j2590 gauss mini i was lucky enough to roll. Still able to complete the daily ops, earle and the queen without dying.
---
I do completely agree with you regarding different build options. But then again two-shot, junkies, anti-armor and vampire just became a hell of a lot more usable
---
I finally played One Appalachia today and I loved it.  More of the map is viable along with more of the events that pop up.  Me and a friend duo'd the daily op and almost made the 8 minute mark the first time, at least for myself it was.  Did it the second time and with the same results.  Im a level 120 using a Junkie rifle build with whatever decent armor I could find.  The armor is not remotely close to optimal yet.  My friend is level 250ish and didnt have any type of build.  She ran with power armor and a some legendary Gatling gun she had.  We had zero issues doing whatever we wanted.  I loved all the ammo that dropped when doing the daily.  Have not done any Nuked events yet so cannot comment on that just yet.
---
oh damn. i bought it.  i might have to buy the all rise.  thanks for the tip
---
Because it never should have went live like this.  More than half the weapons in the game are wet noodles.  Don’t tell me you’re not getting sick of rushed, half baked content.
---
A moveable "survival tent" that acts as a foward outpost alternative to camps. It's got a stashbox (and scrap box woth unlimited scrap storage), cooking station, bed, and music instrument, along with free fast travel to it.
---
You also get a monthly alotment of atoms and a selection of free items only for 1st members.
---
You can build an ammo factory.
---
Need Ally rep with Raiders, its 750 gold.
---
Allegedly they are working on this
---
That was the whole point of one wasteland.   Everything is harder.   Enemies are all scaled up.  Cranberry bog is overrun with lvl 100 super mutants.
---
I can respec to commando at any time. It does have higher damage output but you also burn through ammo faster. I have a furious handmade that i use specifically for SBQ runs and other super hard stuff. I dont use it all the time because the ammo costs associated with it are high but we're screwed now, aren't we?
---
I hear ya, sounds like a great idea actually.  maybe even add some "get smart" gates like from fo4 mechanist addon.
---
I think they said theyre looking at it for a future update, but no ETA
---
I’ve been using my automatic vampire Tesla for at least 7 months now, I can confirm that it is insanely good and removes the need to constantly stim while you’re a bloodied build.
---
I know! Well said. In previous fallouts ghoul-sympathy was an underlying theme. Where is the love for the moles?
---
So, **don’t rush** when you’re at another player’s camp. While a confirmation option would be beneficial, this is an easy workaround. 
---
The takeaway is the same as always; use caution when in another player’s camp.
---
I got a gutter plan. Whatever the heck that is...
---
Not poking fun, but have to say this is like one of the best "immersion" posts today.  It's like you just came out of Vault 76 and wondering what the hell happened to West Virginia!  It's a wasteland out there...
---
I was wanted a couple of times. No one even bothered to kill me until I asked one of my friends to end me lol.
---
A long time ago when the game released when you became wanted you were swarmed.
---
My lever action rifle sees alot of rubber band health too
---
I run gunsmith at 5 and no it has a rate of fire multiplier, lowered weight and instigating; I once run it as an automatic and it basically broke in one encounter against like 10 super mutants and 7 scorched
---
Your numbers don’t count enemy resistances I guess?
---
Glad to hear that from someone else.  I've got a degree in music composition, you'd think I can tell if I'm hearing the same thing!  Nice to double check haha
---
But it did so a great job for top level.
---
It also fixed the issue of running into someones level 60 spawned scorched guys when you are level 10.
---
its actually already difficult maintaining resources and having to collect them more often than not. The stash box size directly relates to that. But more importantly its just a big chore. If you dont have first, then it really is more work than play. My brother has stopped playing entirely because he has barely any room in the stash to work with.
---
Lol they wouldn’t be rare if you were guaranteed them, ever see any posts about vault 76 jumpsuits for sale?
---
I hated them even before the update. Now those jumpy, spinny laser gits might actually KO me too
---
The gauss shotgun wasn’t my style, seems glitchy in vats (misses shots). Went back to my combat shotgun.  I now regret buying/learning the plans for it since I get a lot of garbage gauss shotgun rolls from the purveyor.  I’m sure other people have more pleasant experiences with it though and have advice on how to make it work.
---
Who was complaining that PVE was too easy? I kept seeing posts asking for challenging endgame content, but I didn’t see anyone bitching about normal enemies being too weak.
---
Yeah...
---
Again...go outside and learn something new
---
I agree, that's why I want to try to help them. This is a fun game, and in my opinion, getting max level items wherever I go is fucking awesome.. and I want people to have the same fun I can.
---
I've just seen a few that literally have all QoL perks and stuff and I feel like they just need help.
---
Well stabilized under Intelligence is a must.
---
I'm a sneaky sniper build. Level 120ish. I'm an "angel of mercy" with my medic perks and my nurse's hat. I only wear power armor when doing a big event.
---
Today, for the first time ever, I ran out of fusion cores.
---
I ran out of .308, .45, 5.56.
---
My Chinese stealth armor broke *twice.*
---
My Gauss rifle remains useless.
---
I used to do events, see the big boys show up &amp; think "Yay! The calvary's here!" but it took an insane amount of 250+ players to down the SBQ &amp; we almost didn't make it under the time limit. I was stimming everyone I could &amp; burned through my v large backlog. Completely failed Colossal. Just no hope whatsoever.
---
Oh &amp; my gatling of course broke mid-fight there. So that was *fun.*
---
Daily OPs are just terrifying &amp; I honestly feel bad for people who get stuck with me in there because I am running like a chicken with it's head cut off.
---
Oh! &amp; my camp was destroyed for the first time ever when a scorchbeast decided to fight a mirelurk queen and then together ruined my camp. Yeah. So that happened.
---
Bethesda, I've put up with a lot but come on now. Y'all are just killing us here. ಠ_ಠ
---
Tried 3 different headphones,on 3 different motherboards. And I'm not the only person this has happened too. maybe I just need to buy a damn soundcard.
---
ill take one of the new players..
---
Two shot just adds one additional pellet for shotguns and dragons.
---
Protectrons have suddenly become Apex predators.
---
Was weird running the OP event letting fly with an explosive 50 Cal.
---
Watching Bullets pretty much bounce of them.
---
Next Nuke run is going to be seriously interesting.
---
I bet Assaultrons are virtually immortal after this Nerf.
---
Their new dialogue when they see me, will be : " BRING IT BITCH ".
---
I’m sorry you’re having that experience. When I first started playing this game I was happy to overlook most of its problems based on how great the community is. I can’t overlook them anymore. It’s a total bummer.
---
Yeah like don't get me wrong, I like it, I actually don't stop playing it. I haven't really touched any other games for about a year now but it's getting to the point where I'm going to go out of my way to criticise their errors because they've run a PTS, they ignored concerns and now everyone has to pay for it. 
---
Not to mention as you've said, every single darn patch there's a million problems to one of their fixes.
---
This, depending on my mood that day.  Of course a few extra caps isn’t that big of a deal to me as I get at least the vendor daily cap each day.  Not the same for everyone though so I can appreciate this.  Also awesome that Foundation and Crater are free now.
---
You're right - I've got a nice shotgun with some decent perks, and it still takes more hits than I'd like.
---
Same I uninstall. Cxld subscription
---
Help ? :)
---
This is all I’ve seem so far...
---
lol what a crying post
---
Respect to commando, its the same point spread!
---
Check out Angry Turtle's latest power armor heavy gunner build on YouTube, it's a really good guide if you're looking for a few tips or an outline to follow
---
What's it cost to place?
---
Considering it's no more powerful than the fusion generator, trying to figure out what the benefit is other than ascethetics.
---
Ppl are crying because they want "Easy Mode" back....they've been spoiled and thought they were badasses... The update showed them they are marshmallows and weak.
---
Literally anywhere, one of the points of One Wasteland was to scale for XP gain as well.
---
Right? They already have the interface. Treat it like a Sunny bot. Put 1000000 points in the vendor bot every day  Then I can trade in x number of ammo for straight points or exchange points for ammo. That is what is so frustrating. The mechanism already exists.
---
They're supposed to be only acquirable by completing the higher tiers of Daily Ops that's what's supposed to make them rare.
---
Yeah, play as your normally can/want to until there is only a day or two left and then decide to buy ranks or not. 
---
Every rank costs 150, so it’s expensive at first as it only earns you around 1000 score, but at rank 80-99 the 150 atoms get you over 3000 score
---
Have you tried the Follow through legendary perk? 40% ranges sneak damage should put you back in the game.
---
PA isnt as complicated at it would seem. Espcially now with the new legendary perk that recharges cores, def get rank 1 of that and you'll find yourself tanking the ops with the same core by the end at 95/100. Pick up the mods for ap refresh on the legs if you can manage inventory. I run traveling pharm when I take out barbarian, I got thru hiker on agility, and both ap refresh for better gunplay and health management. I believe dodgy works in PA, but even if not, there are times I can just hop in PA without even swapping perks and kick ass with the vamp mini. I play both PA and mid-health junkies/bloodied/unyielding. If you can bump your int up to 6 or 8, you can run nerd rage with emergency protocols, and have lvl 5 gunsmith, scrapper, demo expert, weapon and armor repair max durability. Was disappointed today tho cuz I bought the leg mods to increase carry weight and don't even use it now. So before you drop 5800 caps on that, make sure you remember which perks aren't necessary in pa so you can swap them for the QoL ish
---
get ready for an even bigger surprise when you finally launch the game
---
Yep they've taken builds that are well established in all other Fallout games and just destroyed them. Evidently with this game they're going to tell us how to play and make it really hard for us at every step of the way, not for me I'm out.
---
Still got 100 of each type please hurt me more
---
Probibly the damage nerf is taking affect.
---
It shouldn't be a requirement to build bloodied/unyielding and get a one-shot magic weapon. Building slightly more ammo is 1000x healtier for the game than insane one shot bloodied builds, sorry
---
Upvote for you
---
all fast travels should be free.
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/428366/weight-bench-temporarily-disabled-sept-16-2020?language%255B%255D=en
---
I knew it, but it was A LOT quicker than I thought. :/
---
Are daily ops server based? I tried server hoping but kept getting robots/v94/resilient
---
I canceled and might even cancel Xbox live since this is the only game keeping me on that platform.
---
I like to learn every plan I can find so I am saving up the max 5k and then buying a bunch.  Once I've bought every plan available for gold I'll max out the 5k and wait.  Although didn't they say you can buy lunchboxes now?  I need to go look.
---
I've not managed to get a sneak critical since the update....
---
OMG yes, I was actually able to solo it at Knight and didn't die once. I think the combo of Armor piercing Gutsy's and having to melee them was just too much
---
I thought with the updated I could go everywhere and the enemies where my level lol
---
I've seen some reports of some of the sneak perks needing to be unequipped and then re-equipped to work properly.
---
let's just pretend mirelurk kings don't exist, shall we?
---
I soloed one in under 9 minutes first try
---
Theyre supposed to be only acquirable from completing the higher tiers of ops...something that a lot of people struggled with yesterday if you didn't see the 100s of posts about it being too "hard". 
---
This community time and time again proves that they deserved every glitchy pile of shit that Bethesda has delivered.
---
bye
---
I've honestly given up hope on this game now. I was really holding out hope that the One Wasteland update would bring a level of freshness to this game and made using other weapons besides a small handful of guns actually useful, make regular enemies less spongey but keep high health on bosses and group events (kind of like ESO), but there are now more damage sponges than ever, a lot of weapons are still useless, and worst part is there's no avoiding it now as every enemy now scales to your level in all of their damage spongey glory. This update has just made just about every encounter a drain on my ammo and gear condition and while grinding for ammo was a mild inconvenience before, it's now an outright pain in the ass (I second OP in saying a big thank you to the people who sell ammo for 1 cap).
---
Everything in this game is just grind, grind, grind, for VERY little reward and to make matters worse, the game STILL has a lot of bugs and issues that have been present since the very beginning. If I were Bethesda, I'd push all content releases into Q2 next year at the very least and focus the rest of this year and the beginning of next purely on bug fixes and rebalancing. Right now, that is what this game badly needs.
---
It has happened to all of us at one point, I have lost 5k before, was at a event and didn’t leave.
---
Instigating! Perfect for snipers!
---
Yes! I mean, HELL YES!!!
---
I got the lights!
---
Imagine if the make a new Vagas for ps4? I might go back to fo4, but i can't go back to ps3
---
That's what players in WarFrame said about their God-tier Rivens.
---
As far as I know, it does not affect your relationship at all. I already maxed both of them, tho.
---
Sneak is just broken this update.
---
The numbers still don't add up correctly
---
&gt; I'm around level 30, and was cruising through before the patch, taking it slow and casual, really soaking in each location and all the little quests and world-building. I usually play MMO's this way, ensuring I'm over-leveled for the location, grinding a couple of places before moving onto the next. Because one-shotting low-level enemies is fun for me after a full day of classes and work.
---
Don't need to revert, just rework some numbers. I suspect it is coming, now how quickly that will happen, um yeah.
---
Right. My issue isn't that I can't kill them. I either stay and boost the zone to get a good time while getting lit up or I take a bad time to get kills. Feels counterintuitive.
---
Then whats the point of getting Elder? Just to get a better % of not getting fucked by RNG?
---
While we’re at it, here are some other things that may help people:
---
* Use Bobbleheads &amp; magazines: They aren’t just for decoration. A bobble head that adds +20% damage to a weapon type can really help if you didn’t already have that perk yet (or even if you did).  Magazines can do similar, though usually in smaller numbers.  
---
* Get some mutations:  Get yourself to Emmett Mountain and farm some nice, free mutations (will need starched genes to not lose them).  Adrenal reaction is basically bloodied, and you can get it without needing a bloodied weapons. 
---
* Stack your buffs:  You can have multiple food buffs active as long as they don’t do the same sort of thing.  When combined with a mutation like Herbivore, you can get some decent buffs to your stats (which can in turn help your survival or leveling speed).  Grilled Radstag with Carnivore + strange in numbers will increase your carry weight by 50.  Glowing meat steaks with the same perks gives you +25% melee damage (vs +10% melee damage). 
---
* Join public teams even when you want to play alone.  Other people sharing perks can make you stronger than you were.  Throw praise on the rare 15 charisma character who is sharing something like Adrenaline.
---
I would gladly have taken those over the Burrows signs I got today.
---
Not saying it's hard. It's just not enjoyable.
---
I ran a bloodied heavy gunner power armor build before. Gauss minigun, gatling gun, plasma, minigun, and gatling laser. I went from completely bonkers broken glass cannon to still pretty OP suprisingly tanky. 
---
Loving the public teams, earle, daily ops. Patch well done for my part!
---
I'll try that thanks!
---
Only thing you'll feel then is recoil
---
How you know? You actually know the exact resistances of the enemy?
---
Just get the card again later.
---
The math itself doesn't make sense
---
Fancy Assulatron Blade with Guaranteed Vampire's Effect, more damage, less weight, and painted like Candy Corn.
---
Yes, I would like that very much.
---
You can buy them for caps ingame since wastelanders!
---
You don’t have to change your build. You just have to change your approach. Don’t stand and fight the mobs. Head to the best checkpoint and bottleneck the mobs. Put on Power Armor or a set of Troubleshooter’s gear if you have it. 
---
Focus on the objectives, not the combat.
---
I went a multi build and I’m doing grate if I need to change a build it only take a sec
---
Yeah, and it's crazy because I get that they felt some parts of the game were too easy and wanted to increase the difficulty, but it's like they just did it in the simplest and most brain dead way possible. Just jacking up the level of every creature in the game isn't a good solution. Like you said, it's not increasing the challenge in an interesting way, it's just making it way more work to play. 
---
A level 20 ghoul isn't any smarter than a level 5 ghoul, it just takes more bullets. It's not any more fun to fight, it's just more annoying.
---
What's the difference between animated and not?
---
Stealth is additive maybe?
---
What is a decent build for a level 7 character? Did you even read the title of the post?
---
Just failed campfire tales! With THREE lvl 200+ players. Swarms of high lvl bugs ticks ants that just wouldn't die. What the fuck is this?! 
---
Player community: fix bugs!
---
Bethesda: making changes no one asked for.
---
I can't play this game as I've been playing it thus far. **It is a different game.** I'd need to level 30-40 more levels to turn my build into a tank. And it'd be a slog with all these high lvl enemies. Also, bethesda, while we are ranting what the fuck is it with rats and bugs in all your games?
---
While its possible I would be nice for those who can't solo it due to lack of skill or a build leveled around group work.
---
Ive had inconsistant number before.  Maybe watch health bar.
---
So if Stealth wasn't disabled, you'd just walk to each uplink and kill everything without being seen, getting the best time with Zero effort each time. 
---
Sorry you have to change and adapt a little bit. Get over it, I guess.
---
Ignite the fertilizer
---
This made my day. Thank you very much!
---
It's broken the game and made it unfun for my rifle and melee characters.
---
And made levelling my level 20 alt next to impossible.
---
If that is the goal they are headed in the right direction.  I think you've made a valid point that they solved a balance issue by just making it inaccessible to certain builds, but you seem to think that's good for the game instead of shitty, lazy game design.  That's like if they wanted to balance bloodied, so they just made ops so unyielding gear doesn't apply.
---
What weapons are you using?
---
I am running a standard TS 50 Vats DMG Handmade with a Piercing 10 Shot Mag  
---
And when I whip out my 60% + Unyielding/Adrenal at roughly 80% hp I can kill nearly everything with 10 shots (yao guai need stealth bonus / 2 magazins)
---
Invest some attention to your build, you'll be fine. I just solo'd daily op under 7min with a mid tier low health heavy gunner.
---
Not a bug, you're just extremely unlucky.
---

Specifically the camp plans have a 0.02%	0.04%	0.32% drop rate for each tier.
---
Main areas I remember this happening to my nephew were at Monagah Power Plant workshop, having lvl 30 or 60 ghouls at it and a dirt road right outside Top of the World also having lvl.30 ghouls that were just kind of randomly there.

The mountains/divide isn't a very high level area, when I played I definitely(Lvl.71 character) don't remember there being Lvl.30+ being at those locations when I wasn't near that level.
---
Times have changed.lol
---
It's not hard to make a good build.
---
I don't really have a min max build, but my first suggestion would be to lose a point in intelligence or endurance (I would drop int and just equip scrapper when you need it) and add 1 to perception. Drop ground pounder and add max rank tank killer. Since the damage changes, ignoring armor is more important now more than ever.
---
Edit: i would also change out the dodgy perk for more adrenaline. Also tenderizer needs to be in everyone's charisma tree its extremely strong
---
What platform are you on? If PC, I can give you some items to help make the wasteland more bearable.
---
Everyone I've seen says they don't have the generators affected by that. I myself use one fusion generator and still was 200 units over budget after this patch
---
Yes, launched one but barely, gonna do another one
---
Psn is UltraNut7676
---
Yes but each area still has a minimum and maximum level. So in the forest high level players won't see anything over level 50. But where you were apparently the minimum is level 30.
---
I'm keeping xbox live/ game pass for bit longer see what other games might be interesting. Right now over 100 games non interest me but I'm in same boat cxl it  pass as well in a few Months.
---
Screw Fallout 76! Patch 22 sucks balls. I'm out.
---
Make a free items vendor
---
Be a good person
---
I use Energy rifleman and i don't see no problems. My Plasma works fine.
---
Xbox unfortunately.
---
Finally
---
Done: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f757769&amp;d=sv3sb2sd2s61sa2pd0pk0pl0p80p10pj0p30ej4c71c52cr0i10i30iq0if2a72a02lt2lv0lu2l71&amp;m=c49eg6i&amp;am=1g2030-1626-16-1622-16&amp;wp=w9w5w1&amp;wm=152536-1i-17
---
Help me! My build sucks hard now. Before the patch it was bad but now? It's unplayable.
---
Nah
---
Same happens to me.  I have to repair my left leg 5 times more than all my other pieces.  My theory is I am a heavy gunner with my left leg foward and melee damage is doing it.
---
I don’t like “easy buttons.”
---
Noted. Also I am still plannin on using leggo perks to reach as many 15 level special as i can. Any other noticable things?
---
Yeah it's crazy too because up until this update, I was having a good time with it. I ran into some bugs here and there, and I have some various complaints about decisions that they made, but overall I was enjoying it and getting into it, and looking forwards to having time to play it. But my session today was really bad. In its current condition, it is not a game that I would want to keep playing.
---
I get that they want to make some changes to make the game more interesting to their long-term players, but they apparently didn't spend any time really thinking about what this update would do for the newer player experience.
---
Watoga has 5 PA Spawn locations:
---
-Watoga transit hub behind a lvl 3 lock
---
-On the building connecting to the watoga community center near the vertibot
---
- On the center of watoga near the vertibot
---
- On the roof of the Watoga Emergency Services
---
- On the roof of the Watoga highschool taking the stairs near the train station
---
Lately I haven't seen a lot of people doing events, and it wasn't a big deal because I could solo most of them at 200+ level. I consider myself casual, I run a mixed bag of builds and perks, adjust as I see fit or get better stuff. But, (and I'm guilty of this) I don't do certain events unless I already see someone doing it, then I'm all in.
---
First thing in after update, I join a team, and that guy goes directly into Special Ops, so I follow along. It was just the two of us the whole thing and I'm glad he knew what he was doing, cause I was fuddling around like crazy. We both died quick, switched into PA, then I mainly just followed him around and killed stuff. Those armor piercing Gutsy's are dream killers, and although neither of us died again, I sure as hell was ducking into corners, reloading, and hitting stims like they grow on trees. I appreciate the fact that they drop my ammo, but honestly I got to loot maybe 4-5 of them because I was always about to die and had no time for it. Be nice if you could hang around after the event is over and loot but it kicks you out, at least it did me.
---
I did appreciate it before that I could do some farming runs and just bash things, but that's over. I can still one shot some 50-65 levels in vats, but that was less than half the time. After my one session last night, at this point, it has really changed the game, and no more soloing Tea Team with my 98 damage exploding rifle. Like it's been mentioned, I feel like I'm just starting out all over again. Full teams look like it's the only way to go, and I'm willing to admit to full whining and crying at this point.
---
I do like the legendary perk that let me free up those lock picking cards tho. That's really nice. I don't ever run any hacking cards anymore, which that does away with that pain also.
---
Specced three in that so far. Maybe I’m crazy but couldn’t tell the difference.
---

---
I came up with this on the fly... It will give you more survivability, you have Perception cards you can add with the legendary Perception.
---
I'm assuming you're bloodied commando, which means the fusion core charge is useless for you. Some choices I might not have made, like Life Giver or the VATS perks, just to make room for a few QoL perks.
---
What kind of weapon and armor do you have for your character? I have a bloodied commando with no bloodied weapons, but full unyielding armor, and I do have to shoot a bit more, but there's not much I can't handle.
---
What kind of specific problems are you having?
---
EDIT: Don't know how, but I forgot Tank Killer. I'd drop the VATS perk and go full tank killer. The armor penetration is 100% worth it and needed.
---
Yeah I'm sorry you went through that man.  I didn't even bother when I saw that "only dies to melee" note.  Screw that noise.
---
So ive tried melee for about 2 hours after all my perks were in Riflemen, sniper, and sneak. My god it takes 6 hits from a spiked bat to kill a bloat fly. It takes 25 rounds on a a level 35 super mutant to kill him using a rifle. Pistols are useless and i sold all my energy ammo since I was a bullet build. I am completely stuck right now!
---
Not you but they do slightly hurt other enemies
---
I said it shouldn't be a requirement to have this new ammo card, not anything to do with builds. Once the honeymoon phase wears off you'll start to see what's wrong
---
You get better odds... and a sense of accomplishment. It’s a video game. Don’t take it so seriously. Have fun.
---
All of the games that I'm excited about except for the Nintendo ones will be coming to stadia. That's going to be my console going forward. That way I don't have to buy a $500 box thingy just to keep up with the next generation.
---
I am a dedicated heavy gunner power armour build at level 70 with max builds and weapons available at my level.
---
Yes. Average bloody heavy gunner solo
---
So it's Vendors and Display Cases?  Does the Bobblehead Stand count as a display case?  I took down my Thanksgiving Dressers just to be safe but not sure about the Stand...
---
Scrap something else. Some of the legendary perks work great at rank 1. 
---
And you can always get the card again, especially with perk card packs in the Scoreboard. My wife saved up all of those to open &amp; scrap perk cards she’ll never use to generate perk coins.
---
I love it. Game was a snooze fest before. I actually need to be a bit more aware now.
---
Thank you :) And good to know. As others have said it isnt a guaranteed drop. Its an 80% chance so I guess both you and my friend got the short straw on RNG.
---
Accomplishment? From RNG? I could never feel catharsis by getting good RNG.
---
I am a heavy gunner power armour build. The main issue is not only the insane sponge that enemies have currently but their resource drain. Any combat encounter leaves me entirely draind of heals and ammo. It is really problematic.
---
In my experience right wingers whine alot about things they don’t understand. And place the blame on phantom enemies. Lol
---
Master infiltrator is a waste of perk coins. The free one immediately gives you access to any terminal/lock, and the Mini game lasts maybe 30 seconds at worst. Bobby pins are weightless too, so you're better off putting those coins into any other card
---
At this point, if there’s more than one yao guai I just turn around
---
managed 8 minutes on the mark in the first one, 7:30 with the eagles.
---
Dying from discovery...
---
Like no matter what i wear/equip i can't be stealthy and that causes some big drawback in damage and health
---
Cant stay hidden or get into cautious. 4 uny as armor 1 chameleon.
---
Accomplishment from finishing the Op in a fast time.
---
Yeah I just found that a few minutes ago. The problem i am facing is that i am utterly stuck right now because all my perks are in sneak, rifle, and sniper. Which got basically destroyed. Fuckkk might have to make a new tune and go commando.
---
Crater -&gt; mortimer. And it still sucks
---
I just set up my vendors again after moving camp... a;kha;sldhfa;lfhaskl;flkj
---
Well you see the numbers of how much damage my gun says is 88...but i hit for 82 ,probably their resistance, 82x2 for sneak is 164. 164x2 for a head shot is 328. 328×2 for Instigating is 656. Im only doing 1 damage multiplier so my out come is 164. So I get no head shot bonus and no sneak bonus. Or no sneak bonus and no Instigating bonus and so on.
---
I don't really know what you mean by a build centered on group work, but you should be able to do it by yourself pretty easily.  Go in, flip a switch, stand there, flip another switch and stand there, and then kill some stuff.
---
I think people just don’t like your attitude Zachary.
---
I like the idea it be fun the backpack sounds cool ied rock it
---
I'm probably a pretty bad example because I haven't REALLY specialized in anything and only use global damage perks with junkies, but I was barely getting by before the patch on things my level. Now that everything is my level, combat has become extremely inefficient. I've got 9 cards in global damage perks, and 5-6 each for the things I "specialize" in. Along with the +50% from Junkies, +20% from explosive, andwhatever I happen to get from Adrenal Reaction in combat, it feels kind of wrong to do so little damage when even additively the base damage of weapons is being increased by over 200%.
---
I like the changes brought by this update, but it is bringing some other issues to light.
---
Today just shy of 7 minutes, low life unarmed build.
---
Hopefully you get your money back in entertainment as I have since launch. I fundamentally agree with what you’re saying. Making something twice as difficult doesn’t make it all refreshing for me at all. I think I’ll uninstall and watch for future updates. I wasn’t playing much before, and I don’t really feel like playing anymore.
---
I feel this.  Also, not your main point but I just wanted to point out that daily ops shouldn't kick you out on conclusion- it probably bugged out.  I had 5 minutes to wander the burrow aimlessly getting lost and occasionally grabbing rounds.
---
Unyielding SS Armor with an AntiArmor 10 Aim 90reduce Fixer and a some magic heavy weapons (ts 308/vampire minigun) for harder events.  
---
I dont struggle, but I dont really run 20% hp anymore because you cant stealth kill everything in one mag before, say, a yao guai hits you once and you die.  
---
Also, Daily Ops really shows that Bloodied/Unyielding builds lose a ton of Stimpaks
---
Yeah bloodied 2hand melee build solo’d today couldn’t do yesterday tho
---
One of which was the alien blaster buff.
---
Literally no lol as you’ve experienced yourself, they are not guaranteed, making them rare. Anybody can get top tier lol
---
Last time there was such a dupe, legacies were selling for caps on the other sub. No legacies selling for caps today.
---
My build is utterly broken right now. I am so completely broken i think i might have to start a new toon. I was a rifle/sniper/sneak build.
---
You should spec into just one weapon type, and the build completely changes depending on which you'd prefer. 
---
I'd suggest automatic rifles.
---
Every time you get a sneak attack it says "x2.0 for sneak attack"
---
Yea i dont really like it either.
---
It's probably no problem for some people, but others are going to find themselves struggling to maintain a build for each daily ops variant and save for legendary perks as well.
---
If you're a packrat like me then calibrated shocks on each leg is a must. It gives more carry capacity.
---
There are builds based around getting group buffs from charisma and mutation to get more powerful.
---
Obviously you aren't as good as you think you are because the game isn't that hard.
---
"I don't think molerats should literally do the thing they do"
---
What does that system offer?
---
Two-shot, Junkies, Anti-armor and Vampire didn't get better, they are like the ugly fat chick at 2am in the back of the bar..   If the pretty girls are gone, you might as well take her home.
---
Problem is she still eats all your food and stinks up the bathroom.
---
Trying to help people enjoy the game they want to enjoy dude, not make fun of people. Negativity isn't needed here.
---
Yeah but x2 from what? Base or all?
---
This is exactly how I feel. None of the high-damage weapons (now the only viable ones) feel that great to use. I liked being able to run around with a powerfist or the perfect storm (incendiary 10mm SMG from a quest), but now literally the only way I can do sufficient damage is with a gauss minigun. I really hope Bethesda reverts this aspect of the update entirely or else I'm probably going to stop playing. Like you said, it's an entirely different game now.
---
I have 3 totally different builds. Heavy gun, stealth commando, and a low level shotgun. My first 2 are level 300 and level 210 both totally optimized for their specific weapons. That being said it sucks on all 3 now. It's almost like being back to level 40. Not really what I've been working towards the last 2 years. I say level 40 because I can still kill stuff but it takes awhile and I piss through resources.
---
I agree that having the special be tied to adventure is annoying but I think legendary special as it is works fine for giving you more nw options. You just need to make sure your natural stats are high enough for your nw deck and use legendaries to boost what you need more of in adventure
---
Such a bummer. I've been working on a Haunted House for people to check out but I don't really know how they'll find me without my vending machines out.
---
Or displays can still be stolen from by other players. Some asshole took The Fixer (sneak fast gun) from my camp the other day.
---
I built a sniper. Literally can't play this game anymore. I mean I can sneak around and avoid trouble and take an occasional shot. But can't participate in dailys and events or the new BoS questline because so many high lvl enemies just cannot be dealt with as a sniper.
---
Daily Ops are the same across all servers
---
Ammo perk. With the new update, you'll be at a net loss in ammo reserves if you don't
---
The three toons I rotate through are all dedicated builds. I scrapped everything I won't use on each one.
---
Makes sense.
---
Look up some guides on youtube (angry turtle or what have you). You don't even need great gear to be doing well.
---
It also gives health regen vs energy weapons (whether intended or not) even at rank 1
---
Same. Exact build. Utterly broken. My build is so fucking broken I think I have to start a new toon. All my shit is rifle and sneak and im tearing through ammo.
---
Yeah I grew up in a place with free education. To pass you need a 65 or a D. With the exception of myself and 10 other students in my class, everyone graduated from high school with that kind of grade. Even then North Korean 7 year olds are often smarter in Algebra than your average high schooler. Yet...their country is in absolute ruin.
---
And to be fair the teachers were always the worst things on the planet under free education. It's why I personally skipped 2 years of math in high school.
---
Again I'll stop there but felt like I had to make a comment there.

Which is why leaving it at Rank 1 is viable. And it costs nothing to equip it, and only 1 perk coin to unequip.
---
Doing ammo pissers when everything is a bullet sponge? That's not...great.
---
I have horrible luck with RNG as well so getting any new weapon with a good legendary is going to be impossible.
---
I'd be willing to main shotgun if I had to because I like my shotgun. Do you have any advice if I do that?
---
I got the burrows and the vault stash skin on the same drop
---
Tell that to the shitters who literally struggled with it all day yesterday. Literally like a 100 plus posts about how hard Daily Ops were. Elder rank should guarantee you a rare reward; otherwise, it's just another dumbass time gate. Time gates are literally everything wrong with this game.
---
That's just game breaking, honestly my thought was they should just not have Fast Travel but simply utilised something like the railway lines and such FOR fast travel.  
---
Like how Fast Travel worked in Morrowind. If the company has managed to create an amazing landscape then all fast travel does is get in the way of encouraging people to explore. Let me travel to Watoga but don't let me travel to the Glassed Caverns.
---
You have 80% chance to get rare rewards for elder and if you don't get it you won't have another chance until it resets the next day
---
Leveling up now makes my enemies stronger than it improves my own character. So no matter what I do, I will never outrank any of the mobs in the game now, not even a tick. I run dry on ammo and resources just trying to look for ammo and resources. My camp is now under constant threat of being razed by types of enemies that should be trivial to deal with. And what the scaling says to me is that this problem will only continue to grow with you, and nothing you do will ever set you higher on the food chain here. Part of the fun is becoming superior to lower level enemies. As a low level character (currently at 48), I avoided certain areas of the map where I knew higher level enemies would be, and knew that certain places were relatively safe for me to let my guard down a little and play casually. Now every area is ridiculous. These players that were already really high level may be enjoying this, but I’m finding that it is killing my motivation to keep playing. Fallout 1st might be getting cancelled before my first month is up if they don’t adjust this.
---
New patch could use some tweaks but it's time to adapt.
---
Base Value: 0%  
---
Tier 1: 5%  
---
\+ if Tier 2: 5% AND 10%  
---
\+ if Tier 3 (Elder): 5% AND 10% and 80% to get a "rare reward"
---
tl;dr you CAN get 3 rare, and with a 20% chance, none.
---
also a Rare Item is either 60% Vault 94 item OR 40% "new item" weapon bp, new generator, etc.
---
Way back when, I went through like 20 levels of anger and confusion before I realized mainframe cores.
---
From what I've heard just make sure you don't have any stash boxes near your vendors.
---
I think it's just lazy design on the part of the dev team.  Unable to address  balance issues (or _adapt to_ varied player needs), they chose to lock out stealth.
---
This wasn’t a trade. He was buying stuff from my vendor. When additional caps attempt to enter your inventory after you’ve already hit the max limit, the transaction doesn’t go through because you CANNOT get any more caps. So when a person continues to buy things from you after you’re already at the 30,000 cap...cap, they are still “buying“ those items, you just don’t receive any of the caps they are spending.
---
It's all cloud-based so you can play it on a TV or a PC or a phone and if you pay 10 bucks a month you can access all these pro games for free although with the ones I'm talking about above I'm going to have to purchase them digitally  just like on Xbox.
---
Yeah I love the forest because I grew up in Appalachia
---
Bethesda messed this up
---
Oh ok guess I got hit with the 20% of nothing
---
Worked fine for me when my buddy and I did them last night.  You guys sure you were close enough?
---
They do, it's laggy. Look again, you should see the bonus. 
---
Thought the same thing earlier, but it popped up eventually on my status page.
---
People just don't know what's good dude.  Just because people are struggling doesn't mean it's hard.
---
It happens to me with all my guns.  Side note on gauss minigun and shotgun I no longer seem to be hurting myself after patch 22. Is this just me??
---
This is what I used to do! Farm supermutans. I was a rifle/sneak build Lady Of Death. I 1 shot killed everything because i was farming the low level super mutans for mats and ammo. My build is so utterly broken.
---
Well, I know how you feel (I used some magics / anti armor heavies as backup sometimes).  
---
Have you considered using the plasma caster or the gatling gun ? both are single shot and deal rather good dmg (gatling uses 5mm, and you get a ton of them by crafting)
---
But if you decide to go that route, you know you aren't too teir.  Don't expect to be able to solo things.
---
Now if we could only get the fast travel to constantly work 😂👍🏻
---
Me too. We'll just try again tomorrow
---
If you are struggling I would recommend playing as a PA tank.
---
Base you build around this [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3162345&amp;d=sg2eh2ei2ck0i12a80a12l71lg2xj0xq0&amp;m=97&amp;n=PA%20Tank%20Base](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3162345&amp;d=sg2eh2ei2ck0i12a80a12l71lg2xj0xq0&amp;m=97&amp;n=PA%20Tank%20Base)
---
Use Kinetic dynamo on PA Chest and Kinetic Servos on one leg, you will never die and while damage may be a little less it wont matter. 
---
I have been using [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f1679c6&amp;d=sq2sg2s32sr2pe0eh2cu0ce0c62ib4s01s12a72a04a12lt2lu2l71xb0xj0xp0xq0x83lg2x73i12ip2a80ck0ei2s20&amp;m=0c29fe7b3&amp;n=Junkies%20PA](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f1679c6&amp;d=sq2sg2s32sr2pe0eh2cu0ce0c62ib4s01s12a72a04a12lt2lu2l71xb0xj0xp0xq0x83lg2x73i12ip2a80ck0ei2s20&amp;m=0c29fe7b3&amp;n=Junkies%20PA) on my heavy gunner and its fantastic.
---
Headshots are doing less damage too because they nerfed everything and broke stealth!
---
You got your best in dr/er/rr secret service armour yet? Wastelanders quest lets you grind for them.
---
Power Armor still gives like a 40% flat damage reduction.
---
Sneak? It's not as strong now but still works as a defense mechanism
---
Vanguard isn't great. Maybe switch to dr reduction armour. Get a trouble shooters piece, a slayers, an exterminators, whatever you're having trouble with.
---
No god rolls needed, see?
---
do you have the communist collectron?
---
Yeah, could punch each other with long enough stick (it was in crater next to NPC by the bus), much smaller range than we used before the patch without issues.
---
Bash is much quicker and solves it for me

---
Those are the drop rates, but that doesn't mean you'll always get something.
---
That's perfectly fine by me man. There are some genuinely good and wholesome people in this community, but it's also got it's fair share of Bethesda sycophants....those people can go blow dead dogs for all I care. It was their inability to hold Bethesda responsible for poor decisions that made this mess in the first place.
---
Yeah I didnt get to do anything on a team yet I missed that
---
If they can make rewards for &lt;lv50 players different they can make rewards for higher level players different too
---
Give more incentive to level up by giving an increasing amount of chance and quantity for perk coin drops based on level
---
They're making it so that the people who don't crash at the end of an event can still get screwed over so they can bitch on reddit
---
How about a wider petition to get pet companions, a la Dogmeat.
---
Cats for sure. I want a cat. I love when I find a cat that looks like my late kitty. Why are they so low level? No consideration for their nine lives and general badassery. 
---
I know for certain that I would seek out cat companionship in the apocalypse. I fucking love kitty cats and I can imagine herding those glorious beasts through Appalachia.
---
Don't even get me started on the possibility of Rad Cats to tame for your camp. A. W. E. S. O. M. E.

Its a bethesda legend. Darth todd Nerfeis was a dark developer of the shareholders, so powerful and wise he could use the quake convention to influence the audience to create 16 times the detail
---
Go full unyielding, drop the chameleon armor.
---
I don't know if it's been reintroduced but chameleon armor used to break stealth if you had escape artist equipped.
---
The extra +3 to every special but endurance will help you more than the chameleon will. 
---
And also the extra survivabilty I linked should help you a bit more. Fireproof is very helpful for lots of enemy attacks. Scorchbeasts, any explosive, etc. 
---
Part of it too is just knowing how to get away when bloodied. Have an escape route or cover planned wherever you are. Sometimes you're just boned no matter what if you're seen.. but being able to hide behind something will make a huge difference with a bloodied build. Allows you to reload and re-target and kill.
---
Yeah level 97 casual stealth rifleman, full health non mutation guy here.
---
I finally got my character set the way I liked. I finally found the weapons that work for me. I'm not OP in most situations but set myself up for just enough challenge to make the game fun.
---
Or I did. Now everywhere I go on the map, every fight and micromanaging the repairs and ammo is all a damn chore.
---
It's great the meta level 500 players have something to do now, but them not having anything else to do and OP'd their characters isn't the rest of our fault and we all shouldn't have to suffer.
---
I still have some quests to do, I'm still trying to explore and collect gold for some unique items, which was already a grind.
---
As soon as I have my stealth all sorted to what I liked and things got too easy, I was planning on setting up a melee stealth build for the low level areas..... But that's not happening now.
---
And when you complain about these issues, those not having problems who are level 200+ come along and tell you what build or mutations you should switch to.
---
But not all of us want to switch builds and play like you play. We liked it the way it was.
---
You high level guys like it this way.
---
Fine, fair enough, we all like what we like..... So there has to be some sort of compromise in the middle somewhere, because clearly plenty of players are not enjoying this change..... And not all of us were OP One Shot wizards complaining about needing two shots.
---
My x2 shot combat shotgun used to take 2 or 3 hits on high level glowing ones while with sneak bonuses (much more if I'm detected) ..... Now I'm needing x12 hits with the same weapon while in sneak..... X2 shot.... That's X24 rounds while in sneak.
---
That's a drastic change and includes a reload halfway through fighting with sneak bonuses.... If they detected me right away, my option is to run away now.
---
Before I could go toe to toe with one legendary and barely make it out alive with a few stims..... Two high levels were a challenge at the same time.... Now I can't take on a damn single high level scorched head on without my stealth suit getting destroyed (which isn't cheap to repair) and running through several Stimpacks and a pile of ammo and grenades.
---
Thats not what I signed up for when I worked on this character. 
---
I used to snipe enemies with my x2 shot 50 cal, usually in one hit or two (excluding scortchbeast, snallygaster, sloths and such which took far more) now a mole rat takes three damn hits and by the second hit, they're already crawling up my ass and taking me down to half health.
---
How is that fun?
---
If I wanted to be stressed everywhere I go and have to micromanage my resources and equipment 24 7, I'd go back to playing Rust.
---
True, but if it worked like this you'd be silly to buy one, at least until it got patched, because you'd be bound to end up in a group with someone doing it eventually.
---
Yes I use mostly gatling laser and the minigun. I have moved to rely on the gatling laser more now as I can get the cores somewhat easily via farming a power station, though that is a lot more difficult now due to level 70 mob swarms.
---
It kinda feels like it at times when im being torn up by 2 liberators while im supposed to be a walking tank
---
I hear low levels have it rough too which sucks, ESO did a better job with one tamriel honestly
---
Yes, that's what I said. Upgrading it uses up coins that would be better used in other perks
---
Magic weapons are actually better now than pre nerf!
---
Dude I got my ass handed to me 10 minutes ago by a goddamn bee swarm with bloat fly escorts. Had to use 3 stimpacks because I was trying to melee. I was meleeing because my sneak/rifle build is so broken I used up all my ammo.
---
Ok. Thanks it doesn't sound like a bad investment at all even if you have to purchase digital copy. It's definitely more affordable than having the Pass and Fallout1st
---
Is there a list of all the rare rewards? I did elder twice and got a noct shovel and a one star pipe gun and a ‘caged bulb’ plan which I have no idea what kind of weapon it is, but I also did Paladin twice and both times two legendary items. Is it better deal to do Paladin than Elder?
---
I feel like Elder should be a 100% guarantee. I'm fine with fighting RNG to get exactly which reward I want I'm just not fine with getting nothing for my effort as miniscule as it may be.
---
Well it is a multiplayer game...and some people play the game with friends for fun, and sometimes those people don't have a full group. I still think a option to que would be a benefit so I don't have to join a team and hope everyone comes to the op.
---
I was in every PTS.  PTS players on the first day were saying exactly what live service players are saying now, and were still saying it until the PTS closed.
---
Damn, would of been fun having that last week. I just finished bringing the inoculations 🤣
---
Starting to think Bethesda lives off our salt. Like little fucking gremlins that are fully aware of the shitty decisions they make and are doing on purpose.
---
I run something [pretty similar](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=4d449bb&amp;d=sg1pg2ph2pi2p00ir2a04a32a72la2lt2lu2l71pp2c72eo2eu0ib2s12s01&amp;w=ce0eh2cd1cu0&amp;m=051c249fe8gh7b36i&amp;wp=w6&amp;wm=142535) I don't use VATS as much anymore, so don't Crit as much.
---
Maybe a few [recommendations](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3d444fd&amp;d=x40x70x80xj0xm0sg2pg2ph2pi2p00ir2ar2an2a04a32a70la2lt2lu2l71pp2c72eo2eu0lv2ic1&amp;w=ce0eh2cd1cu0&amp;m=051c249fe8gh7b36i&amp;wp=w6&amp;wm=142535)?
---
You absolutely need Tank Killer in PER, I'd drop ground pounder for it. Adrenaline gives up to a 60% dmg boost for 30 seconds. Especially in mob heavy events (Rad Rumble/Daily ops), I can keep that 60% boost going the **entire** time.
---
1 star of concentrated fire; three stars only gives a 3% dmg (7% total) boost over the 1 stars 4%.
---
Edit: I also switch between a laser, and a BE handmade. I also have 2 legendary points in AGI, LCK, and CHR that isn't in my build
---
Yeah, I agree.  I think a que would be nice.
---
Bro we got our asses handed to us at fucking Tea Time because none of us had any fucking ammo left. We used it all up throughout the day on EVERYTHING IS A BULLET SPONGE enemies.
---
OP post a screenshot of ur build
---
Gauss shotgun is def. Broken after update. It worked fine before, now it misses in vats right next to the target unless you close and re-enter vats. Also headshots do not work at all, they display a damage value tickle the target then hp ruberbands doing close to nothing when bodyshots are 1-2 hits. All shotguns have a strange delay in vats now. You use to shoot k/o and move on, atm it'll keep targeting dead bodies, hp will go down 75% take a moment for last 25% to drop. Triple tapping vats kind of reduces missing 100% shots, but overall they're extremely wonky atm.
---
Happy cake day!
---
Omg i had no idea. Im still hoping for that last leg to drop. I have a 3* scored piece ill sub in anc see if detection is better. I have asbestos mod on chest, is fireproof still warranted? Also if im being dumb with armor you can tell me :)
---
No I agree I tried the wise mothman event tonight and even running around point blanking with a shotgun or railway rifle didn't seem to make them flinch. I ended up dying to a fucking rad toad . On one of the easiest events
---
I’m a right wing guy and this guy is the type of right wing that only enjoys identifying with republicans because he likes to be intolerant and saying offensive stuff for the sake of being offensive. Makes other republicans look bad.
---
Someone posted about it yesterday and a verified Bethesda employee responded that the health regen is intended while in PA. If not in PA if it occurs it’s a bug
---
This lvl matching crap is bull. As well as all the nerfing.
---
I was able to max out agility and give my Berserker commando maxed out adrenaline. 
---
I am effing stoked.
---
It kinda sucks right now. Because I just don't have the energy to restart another game from scratch.
---
It's a bug that seems to not always trigger for everyone in the area of effect. Been around since lunch boxes became a thing. Seems more common since the update though.
---
Just don’t hit the options button until you’re done looting. It will kick you out eventually but you still have a solid amount of time to loot.
---
Also I think people are catching on to the fact that it's more of a thing to show off. Ive never had one myself but I can see it making the game boring taking everything out in 0.2secs as has been confirmed by many a legacy owner.
---
try it with an expensive God roll gun
---
I only recommended the FO1st tent so you can place it by Hornwright Estate. You could then fast travel to your tent and walk to the safe room at no cost. Alternatively you could just put your CAMP near there if you dont have the tent and get the same effect. Also I obviously meant 'free' as in no caps, but as I stated you can just use your CAMP otherwise.
---
It's the same for everyone. It changes daily
---
Checking it out. Are crits no longer useful then?
---
Yeah I prefer doing with a group anyway, it makes it so other peeps can cover my weaknesses
---
It's easy to deal with, I just logged off and stopped playing.
---
I just had the option to add myself as a friend when I went to leave the server. The ui is unbelievable lol
---
I have to spend half my playtime now farming lead and acid so i can constantly refill ammo.
---
So to clarify; It wasnt the "high reward" that was the pool table. You just got a rare "low reward" item.  
---
high rewards have a 5/10/80%chance to drop (and the stack for each other tier)  
---
So you roll a 5% chance, then a 10% chance, and a 80% chance for the "high reward"
---
No I'm on pc
---
A level 100 radroach completely bowled over my camp today..
---
The rewards for these ops are pretty slick, I gotta say.
---
Yeah thats the workaround ... but not good ui.
---
Yeah just run herd mentality and group to minimize negatives from withdrawal also
---
It has always been for all but lets say it was just for base. My damage would still be at 328 damage. Because 82x2 for sneak is 164. Now my gun does double damage if target is at full health 82x2 is 164. That would be 328 added together
---
seems so, i did the new event last night and all the robots got down to a sliver of health by shooting and i bashed em with my gun and they died...
---
Eh.  I did it today solo in less than 9 minutes.
---
Wasn’t he the one that got relocated to Berkeley train station. ?
---
I mean I have 600 resist with it
---
don't think they changed the loot tables much. Now its just more work for the same shitty rewards
---
He's in pervert murmurs old station.
---
XCOM I have a better chance of one shorting a target with a 5-10% chance of hit... 98%, misses about 98% of the time 😂
---
The explosions look boring and flaccid too, they need a little bit of exciting colour to them rarther than the boring fomp of dust that it is now!
---
&gt; doing so makes people like you then bitch that there is no content to play since you have everything.
---
For me this has the opposite effect. Giving me a "None" reward for Elder (twice now, in a row) makes me disillusioned and disinclined to even continue playing their endgame "content".
---
I give up on it, to put it simply.
---
Oh i see, i haven’t learned it yet so I had no idea, thanks!
---
I havent gotten any SS armor at all yet and idk if ill be able to with how fast this game is killing my guy
---
and which DR reduction armor would you reccomend?
---
I aim for less than 8 for elder
---
Are you aware of the hidden 45% damage reduction on power armor?
---
Thanks that’s very helpful!
---
Essentially I literally can not sneak attack from VATS, I can sneak attack while ADS'ing fine, I get the extra 2.5x damage with a notification but if I even dare to use VATS on my VATS/sneak/crit build, well it just doesn't do the extra damage, doesn't notify me of a sneak attack and because of that I'm now a wet paper bag.
---
(My build is literally centred around VATS Sneak Crits, thus, my build is completely broken).
---
I agree.
---
I’m just...done. Make everything twice as difficult and the community is saying such genius Bethesda. I don’t enjoy needless grinds. I enjoy goals to work towards in a game to progress my character. 
---
Oh, that’s right I’ve done that with 2k hours invested overall in fo76 and now my play style is using a nerf gun while hiding in a bush.
---
Yeah, it was my first try.  I bet I could get it down past 8.
---
HERE'S MORE ITEMS BUT LESS SPACE. ENJOY.
---
That’s been broken for while unfortunately
---
Idk man...I know to some it's going to feel good to finish it in Elder, but to me personally it hasn't been a struggle at all. I play with 3 other friends all who have decent builds and the ops just feel effortless at times. I don't find it fun to get nothing. I'm of the mind that you should only get nothing if you fail.
---
That's just my guess lol I'm pretty sure I saw a preview of it but I couldn't swear to it
---
Sounds like a bug that shouldn’t exist then. I don’t prefer to cheat if that’s true
---
It is visually less damage. It take at least 10 shots in the head to put them down.
---
I'm on pc so....
---
But yeah 3/nv are a bit aged at this point.
---
Right. I’m agreeing with you and supporting your position.
---
Ive played for a few weeks. I built up a nice stock pile of ammo from looting everything. ITS ALL GONE NOW AFTER 2 fucking days! I do NOT WANT everything to be my level. Sometimes I like farming low level super mutans for ammo and weapons. NOPE! Cant even do that anymore.
---
Yepyep :)
---
It's bad manners though to encourage people to quit. I can see you love Fallout. Your profile splashscreen is fallout. You've traded more than 100 times successfully. Im sure you've got plenty of endgame gear and the hundreds to thousands of hours to prove it. 
---
There's a passion you have for this game that you aren't hiding. Even your reply to this post is proof. You're upset. You care. It shows.
---
I'll bet you, like most of us veteran Fo76 players, know what has been nerfed and what works post Patch 22. 
---
Please consider sharing that knowledge instead of telling people to play another game.
---
You’re not in the 1%. A lot of us are in the same situation.
---
I personally have no issue with it working out my Build before the One Wastland, but my friend shares tour pain. He was a really bad player before the update and this update he cant kill anything. Not calling you bad, just telling his tale
---
The thought process is that they weren't exploits because they were apparently working as intended.
---
It would be like someone handing you a stapler and a stack of papers with no instruction other than you could staple papers, and then telling you a week later that they only intended you to staple two papers together at a time and then telling you exploited the situation by stapling three papers together just because you could, and then further comparing the situation to another person who used the stapler to perform a gas station robbery.
---
At this point I'm having a hard time believing you're even being serious. I'm sure I feel for a troll here.
---
Yeah, I should of known Bethesda would hit us with another meaningless time gate. I don't know why I'm stupid enough to have hope for them.
---
Fire proof, Dodgy, Life giver, Serendipity are all worth looking into. If you got a matching set of armor, legendary perks help alot.
---
If you're doing a stealth build you really would want the follow through legendary perk, your damage goes through the roof. As for the rest of the build, i might suggest some more tweaks to luck but im away from my computer and will have to check what i am running and if it may be relevant to what you are trying to do. If you jave any two shot explosive automatic weapons they are allegedly some of the strongest weapons post-patch.
---
It says even more in the patch notes if you care to google that shit
---
Weird. Then again I did step away for a shower and an early lunch around 10 am, then returned around 12:30 pm after running some errands, so all I know is it occurred within that time frame.
---
Account wide would be nice, but I’d guess it isn’t in place because it would be farmable. Pushing mats from scrap box to a friend and using two friends to share perks to grind ammo or other crafting production is just one method that comes to mind that is a legitimate/non exploit way.
---
Sounds scary
---
Yeah the ones who feel no change are the elite players who have optimized everything down to the t and have their builds mix maxed out
---
I went outside. Someone asked me why i wasn't wearing pants.
---
lol that’s a good guess!
---
Agree
---
Bruh how
---
You start from the beginning at level 0 with that character with no cards unlocked. However it takes less xp to rank them up so useful if you get the rank up daily challenge!
---
Even with a 3.5x stealth bonus I find myself needing to headshot 2/3 times to kill an enemy
---
Wow how did you get so many?
---
sounds like a fun little addition
---
maybe a tesla armor skin for electric absorbtion
---
It's not a bug, it's been confirmed by Bethesda.
---
Or give me a way to make fucking ammo easily!
---
And they creep up faster now with more humanoids
---
I crafted them.
---
It sounds like you’re playing a stealth build in a no stealth event.  Consider swapping out stealth perks for AP, healing or defense, a vampiric weapon and possibly using power armor.  I use PA with emergency protocols on my commando, swap serendipity for ricochet, max out Adrenaline instead of sneak and use a vampiric handmade.  It’s smooth sailing.
---
No worries. I assumed my point was poorly worded when I saw a downvote. 
---
I wish they'd give a good reason for upgrading Master Infiltrator though. Maybe have extra perks add loot to containers, like chems and ammo
---
Aye, didn't plan on upgrading it. Still trying to figure out which ones I want to use really. Just, clicked on someone's door and went "Hey wait that sai.." Wanted. "..d locked. Well crap. Now I need to find someone to kill me, tsk."
---
I like the challenge.
---
I crafted them
---
Wish you luck 👍
---
I would have to look into it
---
Please help can’t use search bar
---
I have written this post but I didn’t see the answer to it on the front page please help ive tried everything except find a solution
---
(Berkeley Springs station)
---
Was an exploit associated with it. It’s turned off for now
---
Id be fine with all this if they GAVE ME A WAY TO MAKE FUCKING AMMO EASILY!
---
Non-auto rifles might be done, but commando is still pretty viable. Bloody commando was seriously overpowered before the patch, so it just feels even now. I had to switch from a bloodied handmade/fixer 15% health set up to VE and TSE 40% health one. I have to actually think and plan a little before I run into a fight, which seems reasonable. I feel bad for people who feel left behind by the update, but it won't kill you to optimize your build a little more and maybe you'll have fun doing it? It's ok to die in the game, there are no real consequences.
---
Damn... I made Elder on my first op of the day. I wish we would just get a solid three chances instead.
---
It’s not a problem, personally. I don’t stand and fight, even though I can switch between Gauss Shotgun and Sledgehammer quickly. 
---
I focuses on the actual objective and ignored the robots.  A set of Troubleshooter’s armor definitely helped and made the end boss pretty easy.
---
good luck elites, you're gonna lose all your lower level distractions
---
Not sure why you have ammo issue, i seem to leave with more ammo for my weapon than when I entered.
---
I was already thinking about a shotgun build anyways, this will just push me to do it :) I just haven’t had a ton of time to tinker with perks/coins since the update.  I am a little concerned with how quickly my equipment breaks even with fix it good/weapon artisan though...hopefully my resources can keep up with the demand
---
harpoon gun with flechettes put more ammo on the targets body then fired. Not a boss killer but yea.
---
All riflemen did, bloody, instigating, whatever.
---
As long as you pick the right addictions that works just fine, but keep in mind that the mutation only boosts special stats, so you still suffer from reduced DR from things like Med-X and psycho.
---
No one is complaining that it's a multiplayer game. No one is complaining that they are encouraging Co-Op. It's the alienating solo players. It's the making insects OP. It's the level 60 bee swarms. It's the making every single region into a difficult region. It's the losing the ability to freely run around the forest without worrying if a crowd of ticks is gonna kill me. It's the forcing co-op. Plus, as someone with a heart condition, I'm not exactly looking forward to the jump scares of enemy mobs in what used to be low level areas. Not to mention the fact, all of the people who struggle because of physical or mental conditions who play this game. Mainly, it's the abelist mentality for me. Especially for what used to be, aNd MaRkEtEd as, a very inclusive game. Oh, and f off.
---
Exactly! Why put effort into something when I know I can just pick them up from friends or vendors later. Like it takes all my incentive away....especially considering that most of the rewards are cosmetic....
---
You're the second person to say they got 2 rewards. Bethseda! /shakefist
---
I like the newfound fun in low level events. Fasnacht is gonna be awesome
---
I've been running into the annoying glitch whilst using my Plasma Flamer, that after so many kills I'll actually stop doing damage at all, I then have to use VATS just to kill the mob. 
---
Tedious is the word of the day.
---
It was hard to tell if it was our legendary perks or their bomb vests at times! ;p
---
Hmm.  Dev makes ops.  Ops are too easy for stealth builds.  Dev solves this by removing stealth.  Phew, glad we used the easy button!  That almost got hard to do.
---
this is why i'm wondering if you have to use a Vanilla melee attack. Anything that would use a modded attack like "shock" or that sort of thing might be bugging it.
---
But that's another problem as well . Once I die once and drop loot I have to respawn in rush up to get my stuff while avoiding the things that killed me or just fighting them again and dieing again. I did that once and spent 5 mins Search the bushes for my previous bag of loot that wasn't highlighed anymore
---
Bethesda is removing a feature that no one could shut up about
---
Ah.  I get no ammo back from this but that's... well that's not a problem anymore.
---
I don't have it up at all times. I swap it with Grim Reaper's when needed.
---
Thanking Bethesda for removing an unnecessary tax. Wow! Why is fast travel taxed in the first place?
---
I got 7:30 solo with a bloody heavy gunner build. The trick is ignoring all the enemies.
---
No I mean that your own team mate (on a public team anyway) can pvp against you at a workshop)
---
Yes indeed, I agree.
---
In my case, i will not need to craft ammo in a really long time. I main a double barrel shotgun, with this Ops, this happens: I take to shots to kill an enemy, then it drop 18/12/6/4 shotgun shells. Multiply that because there is alot of fucking enemies= *S T O N K S*
---
I started with 300 shotgun shells,in 2 days (doing 2 Ops) now i got almost 800
---
Yeah cuz yesterday when I was near the responders airport and fought off a dozen level 50-80 scorched.... What awesome rewards did I get for wasting half my ammo and weapon conditions?
---
A bunch of level 5 pipe pistols and hunting rifles, as if they were still low level enemies from before the update.
---
Yeah, increased rewards. Fk'n wonderful.
---
Probably explosive bait
---
It'd be different if they'd done something to make things more difficult in a fun/interesting way, but all they really did was raise enemy levels and nerf player damage, which is basically a long way of saying they made most enemies more bullet spongy. 
---
That's not fun, it's just tedious. And then when you start running out of ammo/supplies because of it, it just gets miserable.
---
Yeah they figured it out… That's what happens when no one reads the forum, they just post nonstop about things like this
---
By lube I presume you mean brahmin "milk". It doesn't work. Instead use honeybeast "honey". Works much better trust me
---
I may have upgraded mine.. I can't help it, I hated hacking and now I don't have to constantly stop at locks/terminals to swap cards.
---
I definitely agree with you that other cards should take priority, but for me it was just a much needed QoL perk.
---
Mine was backwards.  After the patch I could share a peek but now I can’t change it.
---
I got 94 stash and BOS Paint skin today. Nice to know I can get camp items. 
---
For the repeatable portion on base tier, do plans drop or only for the 3 ranks? I cleared all ranks today but wonder if I do more OPS now would I get a chance at plans or merely rewards of stims and ammo
---
I just run past them all and tank the damage.
---
I only have it rank 1. It’s upgrades don’t do much to warrant for more rank ups compared to special stat ones and taking one for the team plus some others.
---
I never understood why they weren't free to fast travel to in the first place. I always kept my survival tent outside Foundation but now I'm allies I wanted to move it to Crater. Funny thing is, can't find a spot close enough to place it around there!
---
I am equally concerned haha have started farming tons of junk to keep up with the demand, especially when doing daily ops.
---
Does anyone else come on here just to read the patch notes replies? the anger is so funny.
---
Oh that's frustrating! Least you can share haha.
---
Honestly man those base rewards mean nothing to me. I'm good on ammo and scrip for a long while...Plus there's a time gate on script too so even if they did have value to me it wouldn't be much. I can get all those base rewards by doing 30 other things. Not really what I had in mind when they described them as end game content.
---
Because a “good build” is like 1 of 3 viable play styles and requires a shitload of levels and rolls to put together. If you don’t already have a good build, you’re hosed.
---
Yes- this was already known, tried and didn't work because there might be a bug with modded melee attacks. regardless of who attacks with melee after you get their HP down.
---
Shoot then stab. I'm level 75 on my curtent sneak build and 3 of us finished with only a couple deaths. All around the same level. The new mode has special requirments to kill enemies.
---
I've not gotten sneak criticals to even proc since the update!
---
lol true
---
They should bring back survival mode and make One wasteland a feature for those servers only. Leaving adventure mode for people who want to experience fo76 like it used to be.
---
I would likely do it this way anyways, so I'll let you know how it goes.   I don't have high hopes.
---
Unlucky dude. Hit with ye 'ol ban hammer
---
There were people on the PTS forums that earned 3 Rewards in one shot.
---
Yesterday was the first time ever in PvP that my Bloodied Mingun killed a Dude in a fight with a Tesla.
---
I only found this out  by accident.
---
I normally dont bother with PvP unless attacked.
---
Dude attacked me i reacted on instict and killed him.
---
He went in to the jump/Nuka Quantum mode but didnt have enough to kill.
---
The Minigun dropped him.
---
I actually made a Faux Pa
---
I usually go for the Tesla myself  because it always worked.
---
Now i am curious has the Nerf killed the Tesla i wonder.
---
Is hard hitting fast firing automatic  DPS now King of the Jungl ?.
---
Also i agree with you OP.
---
Reading Reddit you get a distorted view of the opinion Fallout 76 community.
---
I think this Nerf will ultimately  have a long term negative affect on the hard core,end of game player Base.The players that aspire for in game immortality,and always looking for another God Role weapon or Armour think these players are the silent majority.Who will now see no point in continuing..
---
Yeah, the game isn't hard at all.
---
was it modded in any way? Legendary with any effects?
---
Just trying to figure this out.
---
He walked up to me, killed me, and started breaking my walls with a cultist dagger.
---
Bloodied is fine as it is.
---
Level 121, semi auto rifle build
---
Lol.better not buy this for 30k!
---
I am serious: thank you. Ill try to spread helpfulness. I gotta admit ive been angry voting and commenting all day. I was so proud monday i solod earle and i don't want that feeling to be bygone
---
I dont think shotguns have ever worked
---
My one complaint that I hope they fix if they bring it back:
---
I wish the different voices also come with different personalities. The only ones that were any different were the assaultron  and securitron  ones and they were all really bland. Some diversity would be a nice qol change
---
I hate hacking too. But I don't mind picking locks, and there's usually always a lock pick option for stuff behind terminals
---
Ah, that rings a bell. The "Gutter" was a questline weapon drop, wasn't it?
---
Think I ditched that one ages ago.
---
Fallout New Vegas 🤗
---
Yup, run past them and tank
---
Different by system. For Xbox it was Explosive Blood Eagles.
---
I’ve been playing for 2 years pal
---
Oh, strange
---
I've also noticed that while targeting enemies in vats in the dungeon, my FSS deathclaw would only swing once about every 6 seconds (whereas manually aiming would swing about every 3 seconds). Was swing speed another thing to get nerfed?
---
I'm getting new/extra spawns in the DMV too.  About 5 extra, sometimes 10.
---
Yeah, you roll a 5%, then a 10%, then a 80% for your "high reward" all in the same "briefing" if you finish on elder at your first try. You also get 1 set of basic completion rewards as well.
---
Were you to try again, you would only get 1 set of basic completion rewards the second time, since you already rolled your 3 ranks the first time.
---
Also remember that enemies are stronger in general at any location and thus their armor is higher. At west tech, lvl 50 sms are now lvl 75 or 100. 
---
This change is both damage dealt as well as mob resistances makes a comparison of patch 21 to 22 hard to do accurately. You may just have to accept that the damage is what it is and hit a hard reset on expectations.
---
I am hoping some data driven youtubers will definitively break things down for us on mobs that don’t have armor.
---
Theyll fit perfect with my retro diner C.A.M.P on my alt. Are the plans tradable?
---
**It's because you are under Level 50.**
---
You only get the new stuff if you're Level 50 or above. Below 50 and you just get a plan for base game Weapons, Armor, Power Armor, or CAMP items (The same plans you get from Workshop Claiming/Defending).
---
Hmm I havent noticed it much, but also have a shitlist of mutations and class freak max and empath w herd mentality and always on a team, and stranger in numbers in addition cheeses anything that would otherwise be detrimental. But yeah, it is important to note which five are the best to suffer addictions from. I mostly just end up popping psychotats and/or buffout if need be, but for the most part don't even have to bother much with that, even. Idk my toon is all sorts of whacked out lol
---
seems about right to me, though some weapons need a buff to alleviate this
---
Boohoo I may not be able to solo queen and earle or mindlessly one tap every other enemy... and wtf why do ops require strategy and adaption and actually require be to pay attention instead of just rhythmically taping trigger as I lazily gunfu from target to target... /s
---
Okay sarcastic bit done for real though the game feel more engaging and I still auto melt most stuff maybe 1 or 2 extra bullets. 
---
I'm a sneak bloody commando and sometimes rifle because its 3 card swaps for the build... and I adapted to ops did last nights in a team and todays solo got elder both times.... i changed stealth card for dodgy hopped in my PA and shed half my rads and do just great. 
---
Before update I was mad that stealth wasn't going to be a thing then I realized I'm glad it's not because I got to try something new and if it was i could sneak past all the enemies repair everything and then just pick off last group unopposed no challenge no fun just a meaningless grind.
---
I'm glad ops are not just a bullet sponge activity.
---
I love how the game feels now and since the update I've not encountered problems I used to have daily like rubberbanding health or entire clips not registering. For the first time it feels like they really are working on this game
---
I made a fresh account and started a toon and I've gotten up to level 18 just fine. Leveling is a lot faster. Shouldn't be easy peasy! As far as canceling your sub no lost to them. They got plenty of people subbing all the time. Hell, I got two-yearly subs now with the new account. Cheers!
---
Again, this change was NOT necessary, especially with such a big change to damage calculations as well.
---
Are you in pacifist mode?
---
Yeah, I've been trying that one too. Trying to decide if the shot comes along fast enough for the drain from Speed Demon. If it does I can shed more card and inventory. And camp budget from needing corn..
---
Get some power armor
---
well, thats... deep. a little depressing.
---
You mean like a lvl99 woodcutting cape?
---
All jokes aside, I would love to see it happen. Ammunitions Factory could give you a C.A.M.P item, which would basically be floor decoration of bullets/empty magazines. you can put these on table as decoration as if you are filling the magazines (preparing).
---
So I got the Burrows signs and the super reactor plans today...Did I just get lucky and get rewarded for elder on two different ops?
---
Rank 1 and it's all I need right now lol, putting the rest into legendary strength and agility. I used to always run the perk that reduced rads during the day, but now I can replace that since my rads are always going down
---
Naw, fo76 is easy
---
Three thumbs up! I built a CrossFit Box at my camp. Sadly only have pull ups bars and two benches. Not very CrossFit-like. Need more equipment Beth, please!
---
Luckily for me I had a few anti armor melee weapons and one tse handmade that I’m able to use effectively with legendary intelligence
---
At rank 3 I'm always at the capacity before speed demon takes away too much of my hunger/thirst
---
Have you been using escape artist?
---
A lot of people are millionaires too. Doesn’t change the fact they’re in the 1 percent.
---
Sneak multiplier isn’t working in VATs, so you’re just doing base damage crits. Sneak is only applying during manual firing right now. Sucks
---
I was. Not anymore if that's a thing that can happen.
---
I love this idea. It's going to get to a point for me where I have every plan in the game &amp; nothing to spend caps on. When that time comes, and it will, I envisage myself visiting low lvl players, buying all their stuff &amp; then dropping it all back to them so they can re-sell. IDK what else my caps will be good for!
---
Well, they are "hard" on another level, so endgame fits the bill.
---
We get new stuff (even if some stuff is mostly old one time stuff as BP's) for doing this, and its something else except nuking ACP or SBQ or doing dailies.
---
I also swim in trash items, hit my cap when I log in and mostly manage my inventory before doing my challenge/daily/daily ops rotation for a few hours.
---
Yeah, definitely a not a stealth event today lol Thanks for the tips. I’ll consider them next time.
---
Although I have all of the FFR lasers, I won't use them. Why? They are inferior to the explosive versions.
---
Sorry you’re having a rough time hope you work it out
---
Yeah I wear a witch's hat with it and the top part of the mask goes through the brim and shows on top, almost like the brim cuts it in half lol it's goofy as hell
---
They have a game that's solo if your interested. With tons of content at that.
---
Fallout 3/4
---
I have had a few lvl 35 or 40 Bloody 2525 handmades lol so happy for the One Wasteland.
---
😩 it’s really tough to know how well your build is working. Is the “correct” damage pre or post rubber band?? I don’t know!
---
Sneak attacks in VATS don't work. 
---
Don't think all the issues are due to inexperienced players, but some are from legitimate bugs. 
---
But I do agree about the builds in terms of min-maxing.
---
But also, Bugs.
---
I'm not getting any in manual attacks either...
---
This is probably one of the main reasons rifles and melee were hit so hard.
---
If it's ment to play in teams how come the last major main quest line to come out pretty much has to be done solo.
---
Something that should be baseline at this point. I've been using it for some time and don't understand how people retain their sanity without it.
---
I think Data miners have found the conversation lines for that, and it turns out &gt;!The BOS survivors instantly induct him into the BOS just like he wants!&lt;
---
I've heard Super Duper only dupes the base amount and not the amount you get with perks
---
People have talked about this for months and no one has ever provided any proof it’s real.
---
All events with guarenteed legendary will now if you're level 50+
---
Any suggestions for rifle to use? I like the stealth aspects of the game and will have success if I can isolate enemies and take them down.
---
No u
---
It’s a completely different game, and not in a good way. I did optimize my build, and it feels like a slap in the face to me
---
I don't know why people downvoted you. It's true. It's like people complaining how dungeons and raids in ESO require groups. You don't go into a multiplayer game and complain it's not catering to solo players.
---
If you like to still take it nice, slow and big damage, I think the only option left for stealth rifle is charged gauss shots. I was doing 1k+ damage on hits during testing yesterday.
---
Maybe an anti armour gauss or a quad? I tried with quad myself.
---
Dang. That needs to be fixed
---
True, I personally don't regret it though. Like I said, it was more of a personal QoL perk that I wanted. 
---
Now I am gonna probably upgrade Strength as I am currently at 3, would like to get it higher for carry weight and Blocker + Traveling Pharmacy.
---
Boy I hope to never see a Tesla in PvP again. The Fire resist legendary should be great for neutralizing explosive weapons too. 
---
They just need to fix Berry Mentats to see people in stealth and disable Vats when targeting players and we’d be golden!
---
I expected more....but then again...lowered expectations.
---
Ye just thought to tell case anybody forgot or something. And it's 3 free legandarys so 🙃
---
As far as robots go they take more damage from being shot in the chest than in the head. I've never understood why though. Reddit says this is a controversial comment but if it gets downvoted ignore that fact. It's 100% true they take more damage from chest shots and you can test this yourself easily.
---
Wait a sec *(stops throwing legendaries to the scrip machine)* people did that?
---
How about you max out a perk slot and you get a star by your name so everyone can see it. Like legendary enemies
---
For me, lvl 75. In the silos too, some parts they're lvl 15 to 50 but in the launch room they go up to 75. 
---
In that event though, it was a bleeping shock to my system because I didn't realise I'd been nerfed (bloodied.) Normally, 1 or 2 hits would polish off a lvl 50 gutsy but they were all lvl 75 &amp; my weapon may as well have been a toilet roll tube for the little damage it did. RIP Bloodied MMG 😪
---
Edit: Wait until you're faced with a lvl 90 Assaultron. I mean, dayum. Dayum.
---
Tbh I'm not salty my alt can't one shot things like it used to, I prefer this challenge as it's made things rather interesting. Events that used to be a cake walk like tea time and campfire tales are alot more hands on now.
---
What I am a bit bothered by though is one wasteland is turning players into one/two particular playstyles ( commando or heavy) as that is the only real effective way of taking enemies down.
---
Weapons that were only useful at best in low level areas are now garbage and scrip at best, pistols and most melee weapons ( knives etc..). either these weapons need a serious boost or better stats on their perks.
---
My alt used to be a non auto sniper but the damage reduction has made me turn to commando, other teammates are turning to PA builds because of the legendary perks being highly orientated towards that particular playstyle.
---
All one wasteland has done is further reduce players options on builds to cope with the changes.
---
Honestly I think this update was for the better but I think if enemies are now levelled Bethesda really needs to think of upping the weapon/armor cap to maybe 70 or introduce 4/5* weapons/armor
---
I have the video so I'll report it when I get off work...
---
The problem remains, if half the playerbase likes it, it’s a matter of taste, which means your taste isn’t any more correct than theirs. But you’re here, complaining that you’re what... on the wrong side? It’s your choice. Don’t play the game if you don’t like the change. Your opinion isn’t fact to anyone but you.
---
Lever action or Gauss
---
That’s a good idea!
---
Yeah, it's like part of the fun progression of a game like this is carefully fighting your way through a challenging area, and then 10 levels later just rolling back in and stomping everything this time because you've improved your character significantly. And the varying difficulty levels across the world is part of what differentiates those places from each other. 
---
And for the garbage mobs like radroaches and radfrogs that nobody likes killing, I'm not sure why anybody thought the solution to that problem was to make them take even more time and ammo to kill. It's even less fun, and it just eats up your resources and leaves you with basically nothing. 
---
I totally get the idea that the high level players were overpowered and didn't have any challenging content left. But maybe the solution to that is to make more challenging content, not make the game harder for everyone.
---
Easy scrip, and a Wolf Horde event spawns right after finishing LOTP.
---
Man I don't care, they fixed the respawn bug that has made me fast travel to respawn since BETA, i'm so happy!
---
"I remove every modded file"
---
That would be my guess mods are not officially supported and they have said it can cause issues.
---
When many games with mods official or not get updates mods break and mod authors have to then patch their work.
---
I have done this too many times, especially after a crafting session. Running around with Super Duper instead of Bloody Mess.
---
Or when I go to sell/buy stuff from store vendors, hop in to a event with Hard Bargain instead of Tenderizer.
---
I was overburdened and wondered what was make me so overweight. I put my gunpowder in my stash and lost 90 pounds lol
---
Do you happen to know where I can find the plans for the Wanamingo Plushie?
---
Also: base dmg for a handmade is 45 plus some if you changed the receiver. You have a dmg listed are 90. So let’s just say that your perks plus any mods and such give you a 100% dmg bonus. Headshot would make this 200%. Sneak would make this 300% bonus damage. Instigating would make this a 400% damage bonus. So a sneak instigating headshot would do 45 + (45*4) = 225 dmg. Given the fact that the receiver is probably a powerful version but the mobs also have decent armor the 190 dmg you get is right in line with all the bonuses being additive.
---
It’s not uncommon when they decide to increase or decrease budget costs of camp items.
---
That would also be a great addition!
---
u/Valseek is there any reason you guys keep messing with the camp budget values other than to mess with peoples builds??
---
I literally can not sneak attack from VATS. Around 360 damage headshots whilst in sneak from VATS with no notification.
---
Whilst not in VATS I get a Notification "Sneak attack for 2.5x Damage", and it does around 540
---
Which leads to the following problem, 2.5x 360 is NOT 540, my sneak attacks are literally ripping me off.
---
As a Rifleman Sneak/VATS/Crit build this is literally game breaking.
---
Why would anyone play on the harder server? Just being real, most people will take the path of least resistance. Besides, the update isn't even that bad.
---
Is a couple of those charisma pts from legendary perks? I hear that doesn't work for sharing cards.
---
I'm doing 4x less damage on my bloodied fella haha. I use quad auto rifles with adrenal now to compromise for higher ammo consumption while preserving some damage buff and unyielding boosts
---
I've voiced my issues with this damage nerf a bit in the last 24 hours in other conversations, but one thing I haven't brought up is this:
---
When I started a new character, things were a struggle, I avoided certain enemies and areas because I didn't have the right equipment and resources to take on those challenges.
---
By level 20-30, I was in a position where I could explore more of the map and take on bigger challenges, but was still struggling in many areas.
---
By level 60 and up (now 97) I was finally comfortable heading out to take on Scortchbeasts and such.
---
I finally EARNED being a high level and a powerful character. My abilities and damage to enemies reflected this.
---
There were plenty of situations that were still a challenge from time to time, but I felt I could hold my own and help low levels from time to time.
---
Now I feel like I'm back at level 15 on a map where everything, everywhere is level 50 and up.
---
I can't just go back to the forest to chill and get resources to make more ammo, fix equipment or just stroll, because now I got level 50 ticks and mole rats coming after me.
---
I now end up using even more ammo and resources trying to get ammo and resources and going several steps back each time.
---
Now I have to hide in my camp while I wait for my collectron to get resources..... But now I have level 50+ eyebots blasting at my base every 10-15 mins, that now take a minimum of three shots from my legendary weapons to die.
---
Who the Fk thought this was supposed to be fun?
---
Pretty sure this whole post and the main reason he was downvoted was because people are, in fact, complaining about this being a multiplayer centric game.
---
I’ve got a full bloodied and full junkie’s set on a stealth sniper and a heavy gunner, plus a junkie’s PA rifle build, and I’m liking the changes across all 5 builds. Bloody Sniper and bloody gunner before the patch was brain dead easy, game played itself for you.
---
His family died in the bomb blasts, he's most likely what is left of a miner that was working on the day of the Great war
---
Magic damage is actually better now than before the nerf!
---
I want that Grafton mask, that’s awesome
---
What's the point in playing a multiplayer game if you don't play multiplayer?
---
looks good with mountain scout outfit and bog wanderer
---
Yes, I agree. Yesterday’s was, uh, not.
---
It wasn’t, but it depends on how you define a nerf.
---
This made me sad for the knife :( poor knife
---
Magic?
---
And thats why it makes no sense.. Unless they have a valid reason they can be transparent about, it really does seem unnecessary
---
95% of the time, it works half the time..
---
I could buy that, if I didn't have crashing issues surrounding every update... Using the Perk Loadout Manager mod is a new thing for me, I grabbed it about 3 weeks before the end of the first season.
---
Yes. This one was melee kill &amp; they had increased perception making stealth impossible. I joined it solo first time &amp; had no clue what was waiting for me. I'm lvl 170 &amp; I got my butt handed to me. I didn't have time to switch weapons on the fly since I was getting ambushed by 4 or 5 bots from all angles. It was quite impossible to do solo. I don't recommend it solo, that's for sure.
---
Bethesda has proven over and over that they DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING. This is just the latest iteration. It is also the widest, with the deepest cut. Patch 23 will address some edge case of this, but they'll stand by it because of ego and a need to look good to their bosses up the chain.
---
Sure, but now I can put the sign in my dining area of my camp and it fits.
---
Yeah, mine have been “in use” by some ghost since I put it down.
---
Between 5 alts, I can probably stop playing for a week and still hit 150 scrip each in garbage max level legendaries. :(
---
Never needed Leader of the Pack just for the scrip. Lol
---
I feel the same way. The game doesn't seem at all suitable for casual play anymore. I can't even convince myself to boot it up ATM. I played right after the update installed and within about an hour I'd burned thru most of my ammo trying to kill what should be 1-2 hit mobs and my base got swarmed by molerats while I was trying to decide if I could craft stronger weapons (I couldn't, my gear was maxed for my level). I feel like I'm being punished for not being hardcore into the game enough and loving the grind for ammo and scrap.
---
I defend my pistol build religiously. He got nerfed hard but he puts in the work haha.
---
Heavy feels almost like it got buffed, though I know that's placebo from seeing lv 100 scorchbeasts die in a split second from lmg fire.
---
Commando nerf *feels* heavy because they fix vats accuracy buff, but it remains top tier while everyone who owns a lever action seems to be having mountains of trouble.
---
I need to start a semi auto rifle build to see if I can make something that works...
---
"Critter Crusher"
---
Fat people can move quick when they have to.
---
On a serious note we ran the robot/resilient/burrows in 5:50.
---
I mean, I don't think fat keeps you from playing ;)
---
personally im a bloody build and dont like the concept for my character, but i have another character which will be using it
---
Im not mad? I just annoyed i have to put more down on ammo....Im missing a bunch of points of damage its simple math? 82 base damage is what im doing to a lvl 100 super mutant. It would display lower numbers if i was doing less. So with their damage resistance im doing 82 damage. 82x2 is 164. I get 164 for my Instigating. 164x2 is 328. 328 is the mathematical outcome of having Instigating and a Sneak attack. And finally 328x2 is 656. That is with a headshot. So i should be doing 656 damage... but im not i max at 190... 190! Where does this dang number come from?
---
Yup. I just used mine right away cause "oh boy something new!". I'm sure once I get the same plan for a 5th day in a row I'll be cursing Bethseda and my luck.
---
I know man I had goosebumps just typing it
---
I do but sometimes the self-righteousness and conspiracy theory crosses a threshold that makes me hate myself for having such a self-defeating hobby.
---
1-2 tapping max level supermutants with my Junkie’s hunting rifle, so I don’t know about that
---
The game was already in progress before FO4 was released. It's possible that the feature was added after they split the code or just that they removed it entirely.
---
Bruh
---
The only thing I seen in patch notes about camps was a fix to an exploit people were doing with ammo factory.
---
Thats over 200 lbs of inventory weight with perk equipped :'(
---
I just thought if you read it literally, it's a bit funny.
---
I did this on a character recently post wastelanders after 5 server hops i gave up and I used a private server and got the dang thing to come down.
---
If you haven't maybe try someones private if you don't have one. I'm on PS4 if you are too and need to try you can use mine just private message me on here but I won't be on tonight.
---
I think you only get 1 chance at the Elder tier drops a day. I guess if you are super lucky you can get up to 3. But I've only managed 1 a day so far.
---
Almost like a Survival server? Hmmm...
---
Heh. When repair kits were introduced I abd a few others argued they were a bad thing cause they would influence gameplay to be balanced in order to sell them. Seems it took longer than I expected but I guess at least I get to say I told you so.
---
Someone tried to make the case that if I play the game exactly as Angry Turtle on Youtube does, then I wouldn't have any issues.
---
Solo'd in 25 mins. Was not fun.
---
Not all, I don’t want to be entitled. It’s just I completed 25 tier3 runs and so far only got a recipe for liquid courage, by now I expected maybe 2 or 3 rarer rewards.
---
Even at the default rank it is so nice. I don’t think I’ll even upgrade it. +3 hacking and lock picking off the bat and auto unlocking level 0 stuff is honestly amazing in and of itself
---
Bots in parade and even the occasional wild enemy like a scorch beast. It has been like that for I think a year or more as far as I remember
---
Wall mounted displays are broken, my fixer is also invisible!
---
You can switch them out though. Only costs 1 coin, or half a level up
---
On PC, thanks for the private tip though. I'll have to check, maybe just maybe.
---
Anything I particular you did to get it to come down?
---
Because a bunch of whiney babies complained about the lack of npcs and game missing that "fallout touch" or whatever, so they added a bunch of solo quests that are just on rail shooters with a bunch of generic placeholder ai and alot more talking.
---
The game didn't start out that way, nothing was meant to be soloed, they just didn't expect people to abuse multiple avenues of potency and God level their characters so they could solo.
---
See my other reply to you.
---
It’s a joyous time we live in :P
---
Yeah I'm also stealth, full health, using x2 shot 50 cal sniper, x2 shot combat shotgun and also have a x2 shot Assault Rifle.... They're all fk'd now, even with maxed Perk rifleman cards (I'm using all three) and all stealth cards for bonus damage.
---
Before, things were just enough of a challenge to keep things interesting and I'd still die from time to time.
---
Now I just piss enemies off and have to run away if there's more than two enemies at a time.
---
Its OK, no offence taken!
---
Put an Appalachian radio underneath or behind it
---
Oh I'm not going to uninstall, yet.  None of the previous snafus have pushed me this far, though I'm feeling at this moment like all I have left is building camps, with the rest of the game having too much emphasis on grind or straight telling me I need a new build/weapons to play.  That's bogus and lazy design.  Mmos learned a long time ago to balance content so that all classes could do content.  Some better then others, but you don't see a message that says "for this raid all melee dps must respec as magic dps or gtfo"
---
EA is really good imo - have max rank.  Tanked the robots yesterday and the imposter today .  Surprisingly good at westtek too becasue several super mutant use lasers.
---
The build i am using it on is a full health tank build - so he is tanky in many ways , but EA clearly add to this .
---
The Strength perk could give you a punching bag, it would be a alternative version of the season 2 weight bench.
---
Luck could give you a slot machine that you can interact with, even if it doesn't give you a reward. It could also give you a leprechaun styled outfit/backpack.
---
Intelligence could give a Arktos Lab Pipboy skin.
---
Bulk up your junk it lowers the weight ive heard
---
Technically 4, since completing Leader of the Pack activates a Wolf Horde Event with a Legendary Boss.
---
You’re a fucking LEGEND 🙌🏻
---
My VE minigun is sooo good at it. I switched from bloodied commando to heavy guns just for this reason.
---
I think they fixed the bug that caused the SBQ and Earle to outright ignore damage when too many people shot them. My bloodied magic gauss minigun used to never proc if other people were fighting!
---
Yup. Another sneak rifleman here who would farm Mutants in Huntersville and West-Tek. They're so frustratingly difficult to kill now, whereas before they were 1-2 shot kills.
---
How without sneak crits? As those are broken this patch.
---
Same my dude.
---
You're the type of person I literally didn't think existed on the internet, someone who can actually see a debate from both sides of the fence. Impressed 🤙🤙
---
you cleary need to group and leach of players for exp and legos
---
yeah I can out heal most enemies with it from rapid hits so made it nice when I wanted to finish something close that wasn't to threatening or when I was bored
---
Heavy weapons have always been my favorite. Now that the damage gap between prefixes is closer I think builds wont focus so much on that first prefix. I may even dust off some of the TSE stuff and for some situations suppresors stuff may even come in handy.
---
Because everybody a full set of each legendary effect armor sitting around in their stash? As you know, that's why our stashes  are always full.
---
Amazing how I could put 2,140 hours into a game that's pointless for me to play.
---
Two aimed headshots for 700 a piece drops a 75 super mutant easy
---
I found mine in someone's vendor for 3k. I didn't even know what it was or how rare, just noticed it had better damage than my current shotgun at the time. Sure glad i bought it! 👍
---
well I didnt have the luxury of an explosive drop; tho the issue remains that the weapon breaks way to fast
---
In a daily Ops with my bloodied non prime gauss minigun I'm dropping enemies in one to two seconds of firing. Normal scorched beasts seemed only mildly stronger.
---
Perhaps 'just as strong' was a poor choice of words, the build still feels VERY strong. The only real difference to me was having to use more stims maybe?
---
Yes i plugged out the speaker, left BT only. Stills no sound. I cant see others have the same problem. And it WAS OK to use BT. Idk why it suddenly changes.
---
And don't forget all the ammo and equipment conditions you lose while trying to get that ammo and resources to fix conditioning. It's a constant step backwards.
---
Yea that would be cool they don’t have a lot of skins
---
Damn I've not seen anything go over 400 since the patch drop.
---
thats a bargain!
---
I have seen this type of post so many times now that I'm gonna restart and do the exact same thing I did first time around, get a .50cal and a power armour set at level 25 and go hunting level 68 charred ghouls. Then once I hit level 35 I'll get an instigating explosive gatling gun with no perks for explosive damage and I'll hunt scorchbeasts mostly solo till I hit level 80
---
Oh wait there's a problem there, everything will be scaled down to my level
---
Im actually curious to see how much low level play is broken though
---
Have always been killed normally in PvP when using the Minigun against Tesla Griefers.
---
Was it just a coincidence with the Nerf.Or are they done.
---
I think he was more surprised than me.And i looted the f\*\*\*ers death Bag just for giggles :-)
---
There’s a new forced pvp exploit happening involving a legendary perk, if someone starts squaring up with u at ur camp log out
---
My friend is a legend for transfering resources between mules for me.
---
Finally someone with the guts to complain!
---
I'm not a fan. I had a Rifleman build and it went to shit. I didn't have magic weapons/armor so my damage wasn't super great to begin with, but it was decent enough. I'll have to switch to Commando now, I guess. I just need to find a decent gun for it first.
---
Just put on power armor, heal to full, eat stimpacks, and laugh all the way to the end.  Piercing stealth and only killed by melee robots?  Whatever.  Sprint, shoot, bash, repeat, elder.  The power armor doesn't even have a scratch.  Thanks angry turtle!
---
The luck one sounds so funny running around looking for a pot of gold
---
Than just switch out the regular perks instead
---
You know what? Screw this. If Bethesda wants me to work for them, they had better offer a salary and benefits.
---
I realized after i googled it (i googled why can't i mod fancy shotgun lmao 🤦) and read up on it and yes, I got very lucky!
---
That's what mules are for.
---
Use a melee weapon.. LULZ
---
Agreed. The explosive lasers are on sale all the time here on Reddit and Facebook. They are a ton of fun too. ;)
---
It’s a J5015 hunting rifle, I’m hitting between 600-800 depending on the enemy
---
Edit: can’t really rely on the second and third legendary bonuses with broken VATs stealth though
---
Much better to switch out 1 then 3 or 6
---
not sure if you noticed but fo76 wasnt exactly build to be played in a team like most mmos; it makes zero sense to team up with randoms while just roaming around; events and such sure the rest nope
---
I’m semi-casual. I dont mind the balance on damage done, sometimes it was just silly, but I hate being killed every 4 seconds by never ending waves of random creatures. I miss the old way already lol
---
For a perk coin though.
---
I don’t think that boss has ever been legendary for me
---
This is a great post.  Kinda pisses me off that the chill atmosphere is gone
---
Omg you’re so f nice. I THINK I kind of owed you one...or two...prob more like 20 🙃
---
Sneak just isn't working for me since the patch hit.
---
Just wait until they make it so the rewards are based on how much stuff you do In the event. Also, gun durability is alot lower than it used to be it seems, for a nerf on damage
---
I thought you could only get one rare reward a day?
---
&gt;I know it's a little more challenging.
---
More bullets doesn't mean more challenging. It's the same as before, but everything's spongier. I like the Daily Ops, though. New enemy types requiring a bit of variety in gear/tactics, these are going to be good.
---
Trust me, it works very well. 
---
I’m not yet sure about today’s version. That may require a different approach but if it’s still ‘Uplink’ probably not.
---
My 2nd is a shotgun and it does less damage but not but a big amount. 2 shot most things that took 1 (VATS). I have the three types of shotguns with the Double barrel doing the most at roughly 280. It's with regards to the mods for each plus perks.  
---
Headshots with rifles still seem to do a lot of damage.
---
Manual sneak damage is for me, VATs sneak damage is broken on my end
---
How about a lv 100 apocolyptic cave cricket?
---
Yes the update isn't bad. I would be on the hell mode server 100%, not likely they would do that though.
---
I’ve an old trusty Bloodied 50% Crit damage Black Powder Shenannigan rifle I named “Tally-Ho”.
---
I should name it “Tally-Dead” because if I choose to utilise my 300 round Plasma Rifle Flamer to load the rifle up with 300 rounds, and begin firing it in Sneak like an M60 Light machine gun those pesky ruffians known as Earle and the SBQ fall to my feet in under two seconds.
---
Perception loss has been removed from all gas masks!
---
I was always leaning towards a laser rifle build but since they break so fast there is no chance of using them especially not now; btw what perks are you running for your laser build?
---
Nah technically if ur hella lucky u can get 3
---
For sure. Before and after.
---
I imagine soloing it isn’t fun. I’m pretty lucky that I have a dedicated group. We’ve been playing for awhile and fill in each other’s gaps. I’m bloodied unarmed, we have a commando shotgun, and a pa heavy plasma Gatling. Commando shotgun and I finished it as a duo in 7:50. 
---
I hope you can get some buddies to help out.
---
Nope. NOOOoooo, no thank you very much
---
My apologies, I might of come off rude. My main point was just the daily ops and how change does happen, I’m not saying they are headed in the right direction or even doing a great job. I am still on the fence about the newest update and totally agree this game is headed for needless grind just to be able to do anything. Almost like they want people to get fo1st to loot/farm otherwise fighting for loot on public servers won’t get you far.
---
Besides a daily Ops which the enemies dropped in one to two seconds of bloodied gauss minigun I've only done Uranium Fever and the enemies didn't feel much different, the Legendary enemies still got wrecked in a few seconds and I had to be careful to let others tag them.
---
Let alone trying to snipe my customers while charging more. Give me a break.
---
Are you on PS4?
---
Nobody said it wasn't a matter of taste? And that is the question, whether or not more players like it this way. Too early to have a consensus, but that's why people get online and talk about it, to see who agrees and disagrees with you and if enough people don't like the new changes, we may get a rework. 
---
"Don't play the game" is a stupid argument for a game that we already own that has changed midstream. It's totally valid to tell somebody who hasn't purchased a game yet, this is how it works, so if you don't like this, it's not the right game for you. But changing something that people have already spent money on and then going, "well just throw away the money you spent on the thing and quit playing it if you don't like the changes" is senseless. If you like the changes, fine, there's nothing wrong with having that opinion - everyone should make their opinions known and then Bethesda will know where they stand in terms of whether more people are more or less likely to play the game with the changes.
---
I'll look into it - thanks.
---
Would have been nice if the damage was calculated this way from the start.
---
Holy cheese and crackers I did not know that. Thank you 🖤
---
Do you have any diseases, mutations, etc that lower your charisma?
---
That’s where the *critical* tech is stored! :)
---
Yep that was pretty much my reaction when I ran into one too.  Also lv 100 mr gutsys.
---
GET 'EM OUT BOYS, HE DID IT!!
---
So how does the rewards work... I've done it 4 times and got elder each... Got the Galleria signs... Am I done for rewards now?
---
Bastards are using my tinkers bench and I need to make ammo..... like they are actually shooting at anything.  Fucking mole rats ate my power armor station and this filthy wench is playing the same damn riff on the guitar she was 3 hours ago!
---
I know some people would choose the harder server in this what if scenario but lets be real. If something new came out with cool items to get, why would someone bust their ass on a harder server to get it. Some people might for the accomplishment, but the majority will just go to the "casual" server and absolutely wreck everything. This is why this idea won't work.
---
Damn snitches
---
I guess not, lol.
---
You’re literally complaining that the method of play that YOU PICKED was changed by the devs, you do understand that right? They didn’t councidentally change it just to mess with people like you. It’s absolute insanity to think any game dev should have to adjust to your specific whims when planning and making changes. 
---
And by the way, you technically DON’T own the games. None of us do. We own what are essentially access rights. We pay for access to a product that is presented with a specific intent. If you suddenly decide you don’t like the latest patch it doesn’t really matter. You aren’t the designer.
---
This was a major design shift, not just some minor change.
---
As a bonus, with a "Kill 10 legendary enemies" challenge it's way easier to share the kills. Compared to before when they were pretty much too weak not to one shot so you just had to race to get there first.
---
Today I got wanted from using it. Was at someones camp and clicked on a door. "Wait, that sai.." Wanted. "..d locked. Dangit." Then I had to track down a party member to kill me. I may have to take it off to keep me from accidently making myself wanted all the time.
---
Nope, got the opposite. Mutations that raise my stats. Usually if im not in a team my charisma shows 16 pts and 18-20 if im in a team
---
As a new player who started 3 days ago, yesterday was my longest and most grueling session yet. 
---
I’m level 18 and rage quit at the amount of enemies I was encountering and the little ammo I was actually able to find/make/buy
---
I guess up to 3 every day.  Do elder once a day essentially
---
Awsome
---
Aside from having to server hop for a single holotape., I’m happy with it. Though I wish the jumpsuit could just be found in the vault instead of being from the ops, since that is the last item I need to complete my Vault 94 getup.
---
Resilient was trash. The exploding enemies was much more fun.
---
There wasn't shit in this game when it started out. They pushed PvP over everything. That wasn't a team mode. Then survival mode. That wasn't a team mode.
---
Lucky I can't even get manual sneak.
---
Can I just say I WOULD NOT BE MAD ABOUT THIS
---
Any suggestions on shotgunner perk cards?
---
I legit didn't even realize you were the one that commented, lol.
---
Yeah, at a certain point most people will have too few resources to attempt to get more resources
---
A bit louder for those in the back, please!
---
Yesterday Im lvl up about 200 unused lvl-ups... \^\_\^
---
And pointlessly blowing shit up.
---
I didn't catch that info thanks for the heads up.
---
I run both junkies and bloodied simultaneously.  So I'll do bloodied if I can sneaky sniper, then heal all my rads, switch armor, etc if I need to junkyfy for an event or something.  The penelty from addictions when bloodied is a bummer, but the flexibility is worth it.
---
Woah! That looks like something a Chernobyl liquidator might wear.
---
There are several maps online that will show you where all the deposits are
---
Scrap weapons until you can get a supressor  make leather armor and scrap until you get shadowed and sneak kill eveeythinb
---
As someone who started a couple days ago and is level 18, it’s brutal. 
---
I didn’t realize the mistake I was making by trying to claim the Poseidon Energy Plant Workshop.
---
UI says click this button to view rewards **and** exit
---
They probably decided that since sneaky sniper is nearly synonymous with bethesda titles that they'd make the majority of players have a tough time by taking that option away.  It worked. Honestly I can't come up with anything else quickly to challenge that class of player.  You have to admit there are so very many sneaky snipers playing this game.
---
they could have changed the game and not be so drastically about it
---
Treasure Hunter? Is that what those mysterious pails in the tinker bench are from? I must have missed that.
---
What? Why can they get that high?? The only thing I've seen above 50 has been mole miners and super mutants. But I haven't wanted to go to white spring and see how fast I die there
---
nope PC
---
I mean it’s not like drastically more challenging. But having level scaling across the whole map is definitely an increase in difficulty. A welcome one, mind you, but you can’t take any location for granted anymore.
---
I just ran it again solo did it in 18 minutes, it was only easier because these guys actually die. The robots i fought the first time were resilient so I had to punch every one. This time no resilient mobs so I got through faster. I'll keep trying for better times
---
If only there was a legendary perk to increase ammo production even more
---
I’ll get right on it!
---
Most of the maps just show dots on where they are and I don’t just want copper deposits. I need to get a TON of copper and deposits only give around 3 per deposit.
---
[Me](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/431/201/40f.png) over here only using 3 individual rank 1 cards
---
Im starting a new toon now. I was lady of death but they fucked that all up. Now im trying a tank build. Power Armour and Heavy Guns.
---
Yeah it wouldn't\* be for the player that just started, more for the long term f76's. It's like "hardcore" to Diablo, death means death to your character with no gains but it's surprising how many played it.
---
Lol i can't complain, my drops so far have been 3 stars or 1 or 2 stars of good weapons, like i even got a fixer in a drop, now for the first time i got the spoiled meat in front of my vendor, is not my fault i have decent weapons now!!
---
I used a Bloodied Faster Fire Tesla until it got too easy. Also, my main was transitioning towards an Unarmed Unyielding. Had to abort that: punches are weak now.
---
I’m late but I hope someone reads this for their sake:
---
I was using a vampires automatic Tesla and getting all the robots down to their resilient stage, then taking a mister handy buzzsaw to finish them off. Just turning it on and walking through the crowd killed nearly 15 robots in under 5 seconds. I highly recommend it for future resilient daily ops that can only die from melee, it’s extremely efficient, has a great range, and is the fastest melee weapon currently. Vampire Tesla as well, it makes killing groups of enemies nearly effortless while it heals you.
---
Just wait untill you fight cave crickets

---
I've played quite a few hours in ESO and never went into the PvP. But I am in a large guild, did hundreds of raids and dungeons, and join PUGs all the time.
---
I have most of the cosmetics unlocked for R6:S, and not once played anything outside terrorist hunt. I still do them in public matches, with friends and randoms.
---
I have owned For Honor since release, never fought another human player. I don't just duel the AI, I do siege, dominion, and skirmish with others.
---
I've played both Division games, completed all their dlcs, and ran their end game content into the ground for well rolled sets. But over not even so much as considered the Dark Zones.
---
Just because a game has a mechanic doesn't mean you need to play it. But I still play a multiplayer game with other people. I don't do alot of things this game has to offer. But it's still, at it's core, a multiplayer game.
---
They have options for non multiplayer versions of this game.
---
I assumed it was because more critical parts are in there as apposed to some optical stuff in the head.
---
swap her for the astronaut.  she earns her rent.  https://ibb.co/NsDntSd
---
Talking about freedom while locked behind a cage :-/
---
Can’t scroll down to see anything.
---
Oh, man. You're kind of all over the place, there.
---
What type of weapon/playstyle are you trying to focus on?
---
Guess it’s time to sell my furious cultist dagger and troubleshooters Bowie :(
---
I like it too, but the fact that I literally cannot do sneak attacks in VATS with a min maxed Sneak/Vats/Crit Bloodied build is quite frustrating.
---
I’m not even kidding, quite a few people are having the issue.
---
Sneak attacks whilst ADS’ing work fine
---
Sneak attacks whilst using VATS literally are not working.
---
It’s essentially destroyed one of my Toons.
---
I'm level 35 and having no problem at all. Because I have full low level godroll equipment and can feed any resources I need from my level 210 and 300 characters. That being said I can't imagine starting new with nothing.
---
In f4 you could shoot the fusion core to force them out,but here i never tried.
---
Used to live under the bridge north of town. Wallace wAs my Tax free main man.
---
Let's also not forget that while level 80 and 90 enemies get more damage output and health.... Anybody over level 50 are still level 50.
---
Your armour and weapons go no higher and you have to rely on Perk cards and legendaries to feel any higher than level 50.
---
But beyond perks and legendary weapons/armour, a level 525 is = to a level 50.
---
Omg I just realized how dumb I sounded I’m so sorry I didn’t realize what you actually did I have no idea what came across my mind when I posted that reply, thank you for the help, I know I was in the wrong
---
It only works on regular stimpacks alas.
---
You would need to build your camp by them and build an extractor to get the most out of them. There are also 5-6 workshops that you can build a copper extractor and collect while you play.
---
I found I couldn't solo it in under 8 minutes, because the capture progress isn't fast enough with only one player present. It didn't matter how fast I did everything else, the node captures always used up all the time for me.
---
What's your secret?
---
Considering it’s in the beginner region of the game, you should be able to. Back when I started this game I would have multiple workshops going at a lower level than 18. It was challenging to keep up with but now it would just be impossible
---
I get why some people are put out by they update, and there are times where I turn a corner and get completely mullered, but I feel it's mostly good.
---
I totally understand the frustration, I had a fun casual build going but luckily I had the points to revert back to my old op build. They really need to get some adjustments for general non legendary weapon damage, cause I know it's rough asf for them.
---
They just made everything leveled so you'd have to play in groups. I hate leveled enemies, I feel like such a badass whacking off molerats at level 50 now I'm gonna be a torn apart by a small liter of them😣
---
I am not going to move my camp. If you read the description, it says to build my camp. Not to move it.
---
I got two yesterday and none today. Them’s the breaks.
---
Because those tho suggest this crap never actually used it. The damage it deals is so little it doesn't even kill a level 1 weak ghoul.
---
Same, level 110 and now every act is a chore. I can’t even one shot scorched with my TSE Handmade anymore
---
Ah, I didn't realize there was an issue with stealth.
---
Aside from a Chameleon piece, I haven't used stealth in a year+.
---
One minor thing - in testing with awareness, I found that while the health is always the same between enemies of the same level, the damage resistance is not. For example, a super mutant at level 50 in the bog has 25 poison resist while one in the toxic valley has 2. I know poison is a weird example, but I chose this because I saw it have an effect when I used my strangler PA, and it did occur with the other resistances. This doesn’t change the issue that people who weren’t at the best of best when the patch dropped are going to be having significant issues now, however.
---
I pretty much got everything I wanted, am hyped.
---
I did too man he was the fucking man!
---
It’s a little ridiculous lol, I only just went full bloodied commando build a few months ago, It’s not just high risk no reward but it’s also a massive waste of all the perks and points trying to go full dps, and also loosing helpful quality of life perks like travelling pharmacy to do an extra 3dmg now lol
---
Bro I swear he doesn’t deserve this treatment!
---
I think you either need to switch your build or play in a team if it’s resilent. You should also definitely take a look at what went *SO* wrong. Resilent is a bit annoying for ranged builds, but it should never take longer than 15-20 minutes solo if your build is half-decent, in my opinion.
---
For robots also either use PA or Troubleshooters armor (at least mix in a few pieces)
---
Hide around doors so those robots can get close. Use your weapon bash or throwing knives (counts as melee from what I’ve read) to finish those.
---
Don’t necessarily kill everything, the respawn anyways. Use A and D keys (seems they miss a lot more then, might be imagination).
---
Also don’t get upset if you fail the first tries. Focus on doing better next time. Everyone’s 2nd run was already better than the first one, I’d assume
---
You’d think by now she’d learn a new song! But noooooo
---
They need to add the feature to be allowed to wear broken items! How even the other option is to always wear a broken Chinese stealth suit at all times!
---
So if we just focus on Instigating and sneak with a target hit out of sneak and low health for 82 damage. The sneak would make it a 164. The Instigating would also be a 164. 164+164 is 328. The game specifically say x2 damage for sneak and specifically says x2 damage for full health. So in the context of those words that is in game i am supposed to do 328 damage.
---
They tried to push pvp yeah. And quickly realized that either their pvp is broken, or people abuse everything possible to ruin the game for others. So they have backed off that.
---
Given, it was one of the main selling points, I remember the quote "You can be the raider" and that stuck in my throat like a thorn.
---
But at it's core, 76 isn't a team based game, like CoD, Warframe, or Overwatch. But it is a multiplayer game, like ESO, Division, or Read Dead Online/ GTA online.
---
Not killing literally any of the enemies and running straight to the capture points.
---
You could move it for a few days to collect copper. You don't have to build anything big.
---
humanoids?
---
I actually like that enemys have challenge to them now,  I can no longer one shot stuff with an automatic rifle. But vats is still fucked which is annoying.
---
Will copper is found all over the place so you shouldn't have any trouble finding any
---
What Mole Miner event?
---
I have spent 5 hours today trying to build it. I am not moving it.
---
It's weird people in the PTS said that leaving gave you all the dropped ammo, sadly it's not the case.
---
Hey, no problem, I'm always glad to help
---
Let it load fully first.
---
Yeah they definitely seem to just be throwing shit at the wall and waiting to see what sticks. Looking at survival mode (RIP) and NW.
---
It kinda feels like they have 2 opposing design philosophies, one being an open world rpg and the other a survival game.  After two years they decide NOW is a good time to recode how damage is calculated under the pretense that itll be easier for them?  I guess theyve never seen/played warframe, diablo3, borderlands etc. if anything id be willing to bet that the calculations were overloading the servers or the software client itself. Like HP jumping currently and magic weapons.
---
The change is great, it's one of the best things Bethesda has done
---
Did you update your mods? Perk loadout manager only updated for this version after its release.
---
You’re welcome and I appreciate the apology. 
---
Best of luck.
---
This post is to find some because I am having trouble finding some.
---
Everybody is saying it's the same, and eventually it was for me, but at one point today, I was fighting resilient robots in 94. The venue had changed but not the enemy type. This was just after someone else on my platform (on PC, Steam) said that it had changed.
